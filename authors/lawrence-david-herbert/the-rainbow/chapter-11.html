<p>As Ursula passed from girlhood towards womanhood, gradually the cloud
of self-responsibility gathered upon her. She became aware of herself,
that she was a separate entity in the midst of an unseparated
obscurity, that she must go somewhere, she must become something. And
she was afraid, troubled. Why, oh why must one grow up, why must one
inherit this heavy, numbing responsibility of living an undiscovered
life? Out of the nothingness and the undifferentiated mass, to make
something of herself! But what? In the obscurity and pathlessness to
take a direction! But whither? How take even one step? And yet, how
stand still? This was torment indeed, to inherit the responsibility of
one's own life.</p>

<p>The religion which had been another world for her, a glorious sort of
play-world, where she lived, climbing the tree with the short-statured
man, walking shakily on the sea like the disciple, breaking the bread
into five thousand portions, like the Lord, giving a great picnic to
five thousand people, now fell away from reality, and became a tale, a
myth, an illusion, which, however much one might assert it to be true
an historical fact, one knew was not true-at least, for this
present-day life of ours. There could, within the limits of this life
we know, be no Feeding of the Five Thousand. And the girl had come to
the point where she held that that which one cannot experience in daily
life is not true for oneself.</p>

<p>So, the old duality of life, wherein there had been a weekday world of
people and trains and duties and reports, and besides that a Sunday
world of absolute truth and living mystery, of walking upon the waters
and being blinded by the face of the Lord, of following the pillar of
cloud across the desert and watching the bush that crackled yet did not
burn away, this old, unquestioned duality suddenly was found to be
broken apart. The weekday world had triumphed over the Sunday world.
The Sunday world was not real, or at least, not actual. And one lived
by action.</p>

<p>Only the weekday world mattered. She herself, Ursula Brangwen, must
know how to take the weekday life. Her body must be a weekday body,
held in the world's estimate. Her soul must have a weekday value, known
according to the world's knowledge.</p>

<p>Well, then, there was a weekday life to live, of action and deeds. And
so there was a necessity to choose one's action and one's deeds. One
was responsible to the world for what one did.</p>

<p>Nay, one was more than responsible to the world. One was responsible to
oneself. There was some puzzling, tormenting residue of the Sunday
world within her, some persistent Sunday self, which insisted upon a
relationship with the now shed-away vision world. How could one keep up
a relationship with that which one denied? Her task was now to learn
the week-day life.</p>

<p>How to act, that was the question? Whither to go, how to become
oneself? One was not oneself, one was merely a half-stated question.
How to become oneself, how to know the question and the answer of
oneself, when one was merely an unfixed something-nothing, blowing
about like the winds of heaven, undefined, unstated.</p>

<p>She turned to the visions, which had spoken far-off words that ran
along the blood like ripples of an unseen wind, she heard the words
again, she denied the vision, for she must be a weekday person, to whom
visions were not true, and she demanded only the weekday meaning of the
words.</p>

<p>There were words spoken by the vision: and words must have a weekday
meaning, since words were weekday stuff. Let them speak now: let them
bespeak themselves in weekday terms. The vision should translate itself
into weekday terms.</p>

<p>&quot;Sell all thou hast, and give to the poor,&quot; she heard on Sunday
morning. That was plain enough, plain enough for Monday morning too. As
she went down the hill to the station, going to school, she took the
saying with her.</p>

<p>&quot;Sell all thou hast, and give to the poor.&quot;</p>

<p>Did she want to do that? Did she want to sell her pearl-backed brush
and mirror, her silver candlestick, her pendant, her lovely little
necklace, and go dressed in drab like the Wherrys: the unlovely
uncombed Wherrys, who were the &quot;poor&quot; to her? She did not.</p>

<p>She walked this Monday morning on the verge of misery. For she did want
to do what was right. And she didn't want to do what the gospels said.
She didn't want to be poor-really poor. The thought was a horror to
her: to live like the Wherrys, so ugly, to be at the mercy of
everybody.</p>

<p>&quot;Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.&quot;</p>

<p>One could not do it in real life. How dreary and hopeless it made her!</p>

<p>Nor could one turn the other cheek. Theresa slapped Ursula on the face.
Ursula, in a mood of Christian humility, silently presented the other
side of her face. Which Theresa, in exasperation at the challenge, also
hit. Whereupon Ursula, with boiling heart, went meekly away.</p>

<p>But anger, and deep, writhing shame tortured her, so she was not easy
till she had again quarrelled with Theresa and had almost shaken her
sister's head off.</p>

<p>&quot;That'll teach you,&quot; she said, grimly.</p>

<p>And she went away, unchristian but clean.</p>

<p>There was something unclean and degrading about this humble side of
Christianity. Ursula suddenly revolted to the other extreme.</p>

<p>&quot;I hate the Wherrys, and I wish they were dead. Why does my father
leave us in the lurch like this, making us be poor and insignificant?
Why is he not more? If we had a father as he ought to be, he would be
Earl William Brangwen, and I should be the Lady Ursula? What right have
I to be poor? crawling along the lane like vermin? If I had my rights I
should be seated on horseback in a green riding-habit, and my groom
would be behind me. And I should stop at the gates of the cottages, and
enquire of the cottage woman who came out with a child in her arms, how
did her husband, who had hurt his foot. And I would pat the flaxen head
of the child, stooping from my horse, and I would give her a shilling
from my purse, and order nourishing food to be sent from the hall to
the cottage.&quot;</p>

<p>So she rode in her pride. And sometimes, she dashed into flames to
rescue a forgotten child; or she dived into the canal locks and
supported a boy who was seized with cramp; or she swept up a toddling
infant from the feet of a runaway horse: always imaginatively, of
course.</p>

<p>But in the end there returned the poignant yearning from the Sunday
world. As she went down in the morning from Cossethay and saw Ilkeston
smoking blue and tender upon its hill, then her heart surged with
far-off words:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem-how often would I have gathered thy children
together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
not - &quot;</p>

<p>The passion rose in her for Christ, for the gathering under the wings
of security and warmth. But how did it apply to the weekday world? What
could it mean, but that Christ should clasp her to his breast, as a
mother clasps her child? And oh, for Christ, for him who could hold her
to his breast and lose her there. Oh, for the breast of man, where she
should have refuge and bliss for ever! All her senses quivered with
passionate yearning.</p>

<p>Vaguely she knew that Christ meant something else: that in the
vision-world He spoke of Jerusalem, something that did not exist in the
everyday world. It was not houses and factories He would hold in His
bosom: nor householders nor factory-workers nor poor people: but
something that had no part in the weekday world, nor seen nor touched
with weekday hands and eyes.</p>

<p>Yet she must have it in weekday terms-she must. For all her life was a
weekday life, now, this was the whole. So he must gather her body to
his breast, that was strong with a broad bone, and which sounded with
the beating of the heart, and which was warm with the life of which she
partook, the life of the running blood.</p>

<p>So she craved for the breast of the Son of Man, to lie there. And she
was ashamed in her soul, ashamed. For whereas Christ spoke for the
Vision to answer, she answered from the weekday fact. It was a
betrayal, a transference of meaning, from the vision world, to the
matter-of-fact world. So she was ashamed of her religious ecstasy, and
dreaded lest any one should see it.</p>

<p>Early in the year, when the lambs came, and shelters were built of
straw, and on her uncle's farm the men sat at night with a lantern and
a dog, then again there swept over her this passionate confusion
between the vision world and the weekday world. Again she felt Jesus in
the countryside. Ah, he would lift up the lambs in his arms! Ah, and
she was the lamb. Again, in the morning, going down the lane, she heard
the ewe call, and the lambs came running, shaking and twinkling with
new-born bliss. And she saw them stooping, nuzzling, groping to the
udder, to find the teats, whilst the mother turned her head gravely and
sniffed her own. And they were sucking, vibrating with bliss on their
little, long legs, their throats stretched up, their new bodies
quivering to the stream of blood-warm, loving milk.</p>

<p>Oh, and the bliss, the bliss! She could scarcely tear herself away to
go to school. The little noses nuzzling at the udder, the little bodies
so glad and sure, the little black legs, crooked, the mother standing
still, yielding herself to their quivering attraction-then the mother
walked calmly away.</p>

<p>Jesus-the vision world-the everyday world-all mixed inextricably in a
confusion of pain and bliss. It was almost agony, the confusion, the
inextricability. Jesus, the vision, speaking to her, who was non-
visionary! And she would take his words of the spirit and make them to
pander to her own carnality.</p>

<p>This was a shame to her. The confusing of the spirit world with the
material world, in her own soul, degraded her. She answered the call of
the spirit in terms of immediate, everyday desire.</p>

<p>&quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give
you rest.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the temporal answer she gave. She leapt with sensuous yearning
to respond to Christ. If she could go to him really, and lay her head
on his breast, to have comfort, to be made much of, caressed like a
child!</p>

<p>All the time she walked in a confused heat of religious yearning. She
wanted Jesus to love her deliciously, to take her sensuous offering, to
give her sensuous response. For weeks she went in a muse of enjoyment.</p>

<p>And all the time she knew underneath that she was playing false,
accepting the passion of Jesus for her own physical satisfaction. But
she was in such a daze, such a tangle. How could she get free?</p>

<p>She hated herself, she wanted to trample on herself, destroy herself.
How could one become free? She hated religion, because it lent itself
to her confusion. She abused everything. She wanted to become hard,
indifferent, brutally callous to everything but just the immediate
need, the immediate satisfaction. To have a yearning towards Jesus,
only that she might use him to pander to her own soft sensation, use
him as a means of reacting upon herself, maddened her in the end. There
was then no Jesus, no sentimentality. With all the bitter hatred of
helplessness she hated sentimentality.</p>

<p>At this period came the young Skrebensky. She was nearly sixteen years
old, a slim, smouldering girl, deeply reticent, yet lapsing into
unreserved expansiveness now and then, when she seemed to give away her
whole soul, but when in fact she only made another counterfeit of her
soul for outward presentation. She was sensitive in the extreme, always
tortured, always affecting a callous indifference to screen herself.</p>

<p>She was at this time a nuisance on the face of the earth, with her
spasmodic passion and her slumberous torment. She seemed to go with all
her soul in her hands, yearning, to the other person. Yet all the
while, deep at the bottom of her was a childish antagonism of distrust.
She thought she loved everybody and believed in everybody. But because
she could not love herself nor believe in herself, she mistrusted
everybody with the mistrust of a serpent or a captured bird. Her starts
of revulsion and hatred were more inevitable than her impulses of love.</p>

<p>So she wrestled through her dark days of confusion, soulless,
uncreated, unformed.</p>

<p>One evening, as she was studying in the parlour, her head buried in her
hands, she heard new voices in the kitchen speaking. At once, from its
apathy, her excitable spirit started and strained to listen. It seemed
to crouch, to lurk under cover, tense, glaring forth unwilling to be
seen.</p>

<p>There were two strange men's voices, one soft and candid, veiled with
soft candour, the other veiled with easy mobility, running quickly.
Ursula sat quite tense, shocked out of her studies, lost. She listened
all the time to the sound of the voices, scarcely heeding the words.</p>

<p>The first speaker was her Uncle Tom. She knew the naive candour
covering the girding and savage misery of his soul. Who was the other
speaker? Whose voice ran on so easy, yet with an inflamed pulse? It
seemed to hasten and urge her forward, that other voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember you,&quot; the young man's voice was saying. &quot;I remember you
from the first time I saw you, because of your dark eyes and fair
face.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brangwen laughed, shy and pleased.</p>

<p>&quot;You were a curly-headed little lad,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Was I? Yes, I know. They were very proud of my curls.&quot;</p>

<p>And a laugh ran to silence.</p>

<p>&quot;You were a very well-mannered lad, I remember,&quot; said her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! did I ask you to stay the night? I always used to ask people to
stay the night. I believe it was rather trying for my mother.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a general laugh. Ursula rose. She had to go.</p>

<p>At the click of the latch everybody looked round. The girl hung in the
doorway, seized with a moment's fierce confusion. She was going to be
good-looking. Now she had an attractive gawkiness, as she hung a
moment, not knowing how to carry her shoulders. Her dark hair was tied
behind, her yellow-brown eyes shone without direction. Behind her, in
the parlour, was the soft light of a lamp upon open books.</p>

<p>A superficial readiness took her to her Uncle Tom, who kissed her,
greeting her with warmth, making a show of intimate possession of her,
and at the same time leaving evident his own complete detachment.</p>

<p>But she wanted to turn to the stranger. He was standing back a little,
waiting. He was a young man with very clear greyish eyes that waited
until they were called upon, before they took expression.</p>

<p>Something in his self-possessed waiting moved her, and she broke into a
confused, rather beautiful laugh as she gave him her hand, catching her
breath like an excited child. His hand closed over hers very close,
very near, he bowed, and his eyes were watching her with some
attention. She felt proud-her spirit leapt to life.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't know Mr. Skrebensky, Ursula,&quot; came her Uncle Tom's intimate
voice. She lifted her face with an impulsive flash to the stranger, as
if to declare a knowledge, laughing her palpitating, excited laugh.</p>

<p>His eyes became confused with roused lights, his detached attention
changed to a readiness for her. He was a young man of twenty-one, with
a slender figure and soft brown hair brushed up on the German fashion
straight from his brow.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you staying long?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got a month's leave,&quot; he said, glancing at Tom Brangwen. &quot;But
I've various places I must go to-put in some time here and there.&quot;</p>

<p>He brought her a strong sense of the outer world. It was as if she were
set on a hill and could feel vaguely the whole world lying spread
before her.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you a month's leave from?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm in the Engineers-in the Army.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, glad.</p>

<p>&quot;We're taking you away from your studies,&quot; said her Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she replied quickly.</p>

<p>Skrebensky laughed, young and inflammable.</p>

<p>&quot;She won't wait to be taken away,&quot; said her father. But that seemed
clumsy. She wished he would leave her to say her own things.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you like study?&quot; asked Skrebensky, turning to her, putting the
question from his own case.</p>

<p>&quot;I like some things,&quot; said Ursula. &quot;I like Latin and French-and
grammar.&quot;</p>

<p>He watched her, and all his being seemed attentive to her, then he
shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't,&quot; he said. &quot;They say all the brains of the army are in the
Engineers. I think that's why I joined them-to get the credit of other
people's brains.&quot;</p>

<p>He said this quizzically and with chagrin. And she became alert to him.
It interested her. Whether he had brains or not, he was interesting.
His directness attracted her, his independent motion. She was aware of
the movement of his life over against hers.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think brains matter,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;What does matter then?&quot; came her Uncle Tom's intimate, caressing,
half-jeering voice.</p>

<p>She turned to him.</p>

<p>&quot;It matters whether people have courage or not,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Courage for what?&quot; asked her uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;For everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom Brangwen gave a sharp little laugh. The mother and father sat
silent, with listening faces. Skrebensky waited. She was speaking for
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything's nothing,&quot; laughed her uncle.</p>

<p>She disliked him at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;She doesn't practise what she preaches,&quot; said her father, stirring in
his chair and crossing one leg over the other. &quot;She has courage for
mighty little.&quot;</p>

<p>But she would not answer. Skrebensky sat still, waiting. His face was
irregular, almost ugly, flattish, with a rather thick nose. But his
eyes were pellucid, strangely clear, his brown hair was soft and thick
as silk, he had a slight moustache. His skin was fine, his figure
slight, beautiful. Beside him, her Uncle Tom looked full-blown, her
father seemed uncouth. Yet he reminded her of her father, only he was
finer, and he seemed to be shining. And his face was almost ugly.</p>

<p>He seemed simply acquiescent in the fact of his own being, as if he
were beyond any change or question. He was himself. There was a sense
of fatality about him that fascinated her. He made no effort to prove
himself to other people. Let it be accepted for what it was, his own
being. In its isolation it made no excuse or explanation for itself.</p>

<p>So he seemed perfectly, even fatally established, he did not asked to
be rendered before he could exist, before he could have relationship
with another person.</p>

<p>This attracted Ursula very much. She was so used to unsure people who
took on a new being with every new influence. Her Uncle Tom was always
more or less what the other person would have him. In consequence, one
never knew the real Uncle Tom, only a fluid, unsatisfactory flux with a
more or less consistent appearance.</p>

<p>But, let Skrebensky do what he would, betray himself entirely, he
betrayed himself always upon his own responsibility. He permitted no
question about himself. He was irrevocable in his isolation.</p>

<p>So Ursula thought him wonderful, he was so finely constituted, and so
distinct, self-contained, self-supporting. This, she said to herself,
was a gentleman, he had a nature like fate, the nature of an
aristocrat.</p>

<p>She laid hold of him at once for her dreams. Here was one such as those
Sons of God who saw the daughters of men, that they were fair. He was
no son of Adam. Adam was servile. Had not Adam been driven cringing out
of his native place, had not the human race been a beggar ever since,
seeking its own being? But Anton Skrebensky could not beg. He was in
possession of himself, of that, and no more. Other people could not
really give him anything nor take anything from him. His soul stood
alone.</p>

<p>She knew that her mother and father acknowledged him. The house was
changed. There had been a visit paid to the house. Once three angels
stood in Abraham's doorway, and greeted him, and stayed and ate with
him, leaving his household enriched for ever when they went.</p>

<p>The next day she went down to the Marsh according to invitation. The
two men were not come home. Then, looking through the window, she saw
the dogcart drive up, and Skrebensky leapt down. She saw him draw
himself together, jump, laugh to her uncle, who was driving, then come
towards her to the house. He was so spontaneous and revealed in his
movements. He was isolated within his own clear, fine atmosphere, and
as still as if fated.</p>

<p>His resting in his own fate gave him an appearance of indolence, almost
of languor: he made no exuberant movement. When he sat down, he seemed
to go loose, languid.</p>

<p>&quot;We are a little late,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Where have you been?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We went to Derby to see a friend of my father's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>It was an adventure to her to put direct questions and get plain
answers. She knew she might do it with this man.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, he is a clergyman too-he is my guardian-one of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula knew that Skrebensky was an orphan.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is really your home now?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;My home?-I wonder. I am very fond of my colonel-Colonel Hepburn: then
there are my aunts: but my real home, I suppose, is the army.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like being on your own?&quot;</p>

<p>His clear, greenish-grey eyes rested on her a moment, and, as he
considered, he did not see her.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said. &quot;You see my father-well, he was never
acclimatised here. He wanted-I don't know what he wanted-but it was a
strain. And my mother-I always knew she was too good to me. I could
feel her being too good to me-my mother! Then I went away to school so
early. And I must say, the outside world was always more naturally a
home to me than the vicarage-I don't know why.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you feel like a bird blown out of its own latitude?&quot; she asked,
using a phrase she had met.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no. I find everything very much as I like it.&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed more and more to give her a sense of the vast world, a sense
of distances and large masses of humanity. It drew her as a scent draws
a bee from afar. But also it hurt her.</p>

<p>It was summer, and she wore cotton frocks. The third time he saw her
she had on a dress with fine blue-and-white stripes, with a white
collar, and a large white hat. It suited her golden, warm complexion.</p>

<p>&quot;I like you best in that dress,&quot; he said, standing with his head
slightly on one side, and appreciating her in a perceiving, critical
fashion.</p>

<p>She was thrilled with a new life. For the first time she was in love
with a vision of herself: she saw as it were a fine little reflection
of herself in his eyes. And she must act up to this: she must be
beautiful. Her thoughts turned swiftly to clothes, her passion was to
make a beautiful appearance. Her family looked on in amazement at the
sudden transformation of Ursula. She became elegant, really elegant, in
figured cotton frocks she made for herself, and hats she bent to her
fancy. An inspiration was upon her.</p>

<p>He sat with a sort of languor in her grandmother's rockingchair,
rocking slowly, languidly, backward and forward, as Ursula talked to
him.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not poor, are you?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor in money? I have about a hundred and fifty a year of my own-so I
am poor or rich, as you like. I am poor enough, in fact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you will earn money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall have my pay-I have my pay now. I've got my commission. That is
another hundred and fifty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will have more, though?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shan't have more than 200 pounds a year for ten years to come. I shall
always be poor, if I have to live on my pay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mind it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Being poor? Not now-not very much. I may later. People-the officers,
are good to me. Colonel Hepburn has a sort of fancy for me-he is a rich
man, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>A chill went over Ursula. Was he going to sell himself in some way?</p>

<p>&quot;Is Colonel Hepburn married?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes-with two daughters.&quot;</p>

<p>But she was too proud at once to care whether Colonel Hepburn's
daughter wanted to marry him or not.</p>

<p>There came a silence. Gudrun entered, and Skrebensky still rocked
languidly on the chair.</p>

<p>&quot;You look very lazy,&quot; said Gudrun.</p>

<p>&quot;I am lazy,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;You look really floppy,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I am floppy,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you stop?&quot; asked Gudrun.</p>

<p>&quot;No-it's the perpetuum mobile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You look as if you hadn't a bone in your body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's how I like to feel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't admire your taste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's my misfortune.&quot;</p>

<p>And he rocked on.</p>

<p>Gudrun seated herself behind him, and as he rocked back, she caught his
hair between her finger and thumb, so that it tugged him as he swung
forward again. He took no notice. There was only the sound of the
rockers on the floor. In silence, like a crab, Gudrun caught a strand
of his hair each time he rocked back. Ursula flushed, and sat in some
pain. She saw the irritation gathering on his brow.</p>

<p>At last he leapt up, suddenly, like a steel spring going off, and stood
on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, why can't I rock?&quot; he asked petulantly, fiercely.</p>

<p>Ursula loved him for his sudden, steel-like start out of the languor.
He stood on the hearthrug fuming, his eyes gleaming with anger.</p>

<p>Gudrun laughed in her deep, mellow fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;Men don't rock themselves,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Girls don't pull men's hair,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Gudrun laughed again.</p>

<p>Ursula sat amused, but waiting. And he knew Ursula was waiting for him.
It roused his blood. He had to go to her, to follow her call.</p>

<p>Once he drove her to Derby in the dog-cart. He belonged to the horsey
set of the sappers. They had lunch in an inn, and went through the
market, pleased with everything. He bought her a copy of Wuthering
Heights from a bookstall. Then they found a little fair in progress and
she said:</p>

<p>&quot;My father used to take me in the swingboats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you like it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it was fine,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to go now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Love it,&quot; she said, though she was afraid. But the prospect of doing
an unusual, exciting thing was attractive to her.</p>

<p>He went straight to the stand, paid the money, and helped her to mount.
He seemed to ignore everything but just what he was doing. Other people
were mere objects of indifference to him. She would have liked to hang
back, but she was more ashamed to retreat from him than to expose
herself to the crowd or to dare the swingboat. His eyes laughed, and
standing before her with his sharp, sudden figure, he set the boat
swinging. She was not afraid, she was thrilled. His colour flushed, his
eyes shone with a roused light, and she looked up at him, her face like
a flower in the sun, so bright and attractive. So they rushed through
the bright air, up at the sky as if flung from a catapult, then falling
terribly back. She loved it. The motion seemed to fan their blood to
fire, they laughed, feeling the flames.</p>

<p>After the swingboats, they went on the roundabouts to calm down, he
twisting astride on his jerky wooden steed towards her, and always
seeming at his ease, enjoying himself. A zest of antagonism to the
convention made him fully himself. As they sat on the whirling
carousal, with the music grinding out, she was aware of the people on
the earth outside, and it seemed that he and she were riding carelessly
over the faces of the crowd, riding for ever buoyantly, proudly,
gallantly over the upturned faces of the crowd, moving on a high level,
spurning the common mass.</p>

<p>When they must descend and walk away, she was unhappy, feeling like a
giant suddenly cut down to ordinary level, at the mercy of the mob.</p>

<p>They left the fair, to return for the dog-cart. Passing the large
church, Ursula must look in. But the whole interior was filled with
scaffolding, fallen stone and rubbish were heaped on the floor, bits of
plaster crunched underfoot, and the place re-echoed to the calling of
secular voices and to blows of the hammer.</p>

<p>She had come to plunge in the utter gloom and peace for a moment,
bringing all her yearning, that had returned on her uncontrolled after
the reckless riding over the face of the crowd, in the fair. After
pride, she wanted comfort, solace, for pride and scorn seemed to hurt
her most of all.</p>

<p>And she found the immemorial gloom full of bits of falling plaster, and
dust of floating plaster, smelling of old lime, having scaffolding and
rubbish heaped about, dust cloths over the altar.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us sit down a minute,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>They sat unnoticed in the back pew, in the gloom, and she watched the
dirty, disorderly work of bricklayers and plasterers. Workmen in heavy
boots walking grinding down the aisles, calling out in a vulgar accent:</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, mate, has them corner mouldin's come?&quot;</p>

<p>There were shouts of coarse answer from the roof of the church. The
place echoed desolate.</p>

<p>Skrebensky sat close to her. Everything seemed wonderful, if dreadful
to her, the world tumbling into ruins, and she and he clambering
unhurt, lawless over the face of it all. He sat close to her, touching
her, and she was aware of his influence upon her. But she was glad. It
excited her to feel the press of him upon her, as if his being were
urging her to something.</p>

<p>As they drove home, he sat near to her. And when he swayed to the cart,
he swayed in a voluptuous, lingering way, against her, lingering as he
swung away to recover balance. Without speaking, he took her hand
across, under the wrap, and with his unseeing face lifted to the road,
his soul intent, he began with his one hand to unfasten the buttons of
her glove, to push back her glove from her hand, carefully laying bare
her hand. And the close-working, instinctive subtlety of his fingers
upon her hand sent the young girl mad with voluptuous delight. His hand
was so wonderful, intent as a living creature skilfully pushing and
manipulating in the dark underworld, removing her glove and laying bare
her palm, her fingers. Then his hand closed over hers, so firm, so
close, as if the flesh knitted to one thing his hand and hers.
Meanwhile his face watched the road and the ears of the horse, he drove
with steady attention through the villages, and she sat beside him,
rapt, glowing, blinded with a new light. Neither of them spoke. In
outward attention they were entirely separate. But between them was the
compact of his flesh with hers, in the hand-clasp.</p>

<p>Then, in a strange voice, affecting nonchalance and superficiality he
said to her:</p>

<p>&quot;Sitting in the church there reminded me of Ingram.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is Ingram?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>She also affected calm superficiality. But she knew that something
forbidden was coming.</p>

<p>&quot;He is one of the other men with me down at Chatham-a subaltern-but a
year older than I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And why did the church remind you of him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he had a girl in Rochester, and they always sat in a particular
corner in the cathedral for their love-making.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How nice!&quot; she cried, impulsively.</p>

<p>They misunderstood each other.</p>

<p>&quot;It had its disadvantages though. The verger made a row about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a shame! Why shouldn't they sit in a cathedral?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose they all think it a profanity-except you and Ingram and the
girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think it a profanity-I think it's right, to make love in a
cathedral.&quot;</p>

<p>She said this almost defiantly, in despite of her own soul.</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>&quot;And was she nice?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who? Emily? Yes, she was rather nice. She was a milliner, and she
wouldn't be seen in the streets with Ingram. It was rather sad, really,
because the verger spied on them, and got to know their names and then
made a regular row. It was a common tale afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did she do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She went to London, into a big shop. Ingram still goes up to see her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does he love her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a year and a half he's been with her now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What was she like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Emily? Little, shy-violet sort of girl with nice eyebrows.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula meditated this. It seemed like real romance of the outer world.</p>

<p>&quot;Do all men have lovers?&quot; she asked, amazed at her own temerity. But
her hand was still fastened with his, and his face still had the same
unchanging fixity of outward calm.</p>

<p>&quot;They're always mentioning some amazing fine woman or other, and
getting drunk to talk about her. Most of them dash up to London the
moment they are free.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To some amazing fine woman or other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What sort of woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Various. Her name changes pretty frequently, as a rule. One of the
fellows is a perfect maniac. He keeps a suit-case always ready, and the
instant he is at liberty, he bolts with it to the station, and changes
in the train. No matter who is in the carriage, off he whips his tunic,
and performs at least the top half of his toilet.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula quivered and wondered.</p>

<p>&quot;Why is he in such a hurry?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Her throat was becoming hard and difficult.</p>

<p>&quot;He's got a woman in his mind, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>She was chilled, hardened. And yet this world of passions and
lawlessness was fascinating to her. It seemed to her a splendid
recklessness. Her adventure in life was beginning. It seemed very
splendid.</p>

<p>That evening she stayed at the Marsh till after dark, and Skrebensky
escorted her home. For she could not go away from him. And she was
waiting, waiting for something more.</p>

<p>In the warm of the early night, with the shadows new about them, she
felt in another, harder, more beautiful, less personal world. Now a new
state should come to pass.</p>

<p>He walked near to her, and with the same, silent, intent approach put
his arm round her waist, and softly, very softly, drew her to him, till
his arm was hard and pressed in upon her; she seemed to be carried
along, floating, her feet scarce touching the ground, borne upon the
firm, moving surface of his body, upon whose side she seemed to lie, in
a delicious swoon of motion. And whilst she swooned, his face bent
nearer to her, her head was leaned on his shoulder, she felt his warm
breath on her face. Then softly, oh softly, so softly that she seemed
to faint away, his lips touched her cheek, and she drifted through
strands of heat and darkness.</p>

<p>Still she waited, in her swoon and her drifting, waited, like the
Sleeping Beauty in the story. She waited, and again his face was bent
to hers, his lips came warm to her face, their footsteps lingered and
ceased, they stood still under the trees, whilst his lips waited on her
face, waited like a butterfly that does not move on a flower. She
pressed her breast a little nearer to him, he moved, put both his arms
round her, and drew her close.</p>

<p>And then, in the darkness, he bent to her mouth, softly, and touched
her mouth with his mouth. She was afraid, she lay still on his arm,
feeling his lips on her lips. She kept still, helpless. Then his mouth
drew near, pressing open her mouth, a hot, drenching surge rose within
her, she opened her lips to him, in pained, poignant eddies she drew
him nearer, she let him come farther, his lips came and surging,
surging, soft, oh soft, yet oh, like the powerful surge of water,
irresistible, till with a little blind cry, she broke away.</p>

<p>She heard him breathing heavily, strangely, beside her. A terrible and
magnificent sense of his strangeness possessed her. But she shrank a
little now, within herself. Hesitating, they continued to walk on,
quivering like shadows under the ash trees of the hill, where her
grandfather had walked with his daffodils to make his proposal, and
where her mother had gone with her young husband, walking close upon
him as Ursula was now walking upon Skrebensky.</p>

<p>Ursula was aware of the dark limbs of the trees stretching overhead,
clothed with leaves, and of fine ash leaves tressing the summer night.</p>

<p>They walked with their bodies moving in complex unity, close together.
He held her hand, and they went the long way round by the road, to be
farther. Always she felt as if she were supported off her feet, as if
her feet were light as little breezes in motion.</p>

<p>He would kiss her again-but not again that night with the same
deep-reaching kiss. She was aware now, aware of what a kiss might be.
And so, it was more difficult to come to him.</p>

<p>She went to bed feeling all warm with electric warmth, as if the gush
of dawn were within her, upholding her. And she slept deeply, sweetly,
oh, so sweetly. In the morning she felt sound as an ear of wheat,
fragrant and firm and full.</p>

<p>They continued to be lovers, in the first wondering state of
unrealisation. Ursula told nobody; she was entirely lost in her own
world.</p>

<p>Yet some strange affectation made her seek for a spurious confidence.
She had at school a quiet, meditative, serioussouled friend called
Ethel, and to Ethel must Ursula confide the story. Ethel listened
absorbedly, with bowed, unbetraying head, whilst Ursula told her
secret. Oh, it was so lovely, his gentle, delicate way of making love!
Ursula talked like a practised lover.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think,&quot; asked Ursula, &quot;it is wicked to let a man kiss you-real
kisses, not flirting?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should think,&quot; said Ethel, &quot;it depends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He kissed me under the ash trees on Cossethay hill-do you think it was
wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On Thursday night when he was seeing me home-but real kisses-real - .
He is an officer in the army.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What time was it?&quot; asked the deliberate Ethel.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know-about half-past nine.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's wrong,&quot; said Ethel, lifting her head with impatience.
&quot;You don't know him.&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke with some contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do. He is half a Pole, and a Baron too. In England he is
equivalent to a Lord. My grandmother was his father's friend.&quot;</p>

<p>But the two friends were hostile. It was as if Ursula wanted to divide
herself from her acquaintances, in asserting her connection with Anton,
as she now called him.</p>

<p>He came a good deal to Cossethay, because her mother was fond of him.
Anna Brangwen became something of a grande dame with Skrebensky, very
calm, taking things for granted.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't the children in bed?&quot; cried Ursula petulantly, as she came in
with the young man.</p>

<p>&quot;They will be in bed in half an hour,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;There is no peace,&quot; cried Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;The children must live, Ursula,&quot; said her mother.</p>

<p>And Skrebensky was against Ursula in this. Why should she be so
insistent?</p>

<p>But then, as Ursula knew, he did not have the perpetual tyranny of
young children about him. He treated her mother with great courtliness,
to which Mrs. Brangwen returned an easy, friendly hospitality.
Something pleased the girl in her mother's calm assumption of state. It
seemed impossible to abate Mrs. Brangwen's position. She could never be
beneath anyone in public relation. Between Brangwen and Skrebensky
there was an unbridgeable silence. Sometimes the two men made a slight
conversation, but there was no interchange. Ursula rejoiced to see her
father retreating into himself against the young man.</p>

<p>She was proud of Skrebensky in the house. His lounging, languorous
indifference irritated her and yet cast a spell over her. She knew it
was the outcome of a spirit of laissez-aller combined with profound
young vitality. Yet it irritated her deeply.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, she was proud of him as he lounged in his lambent
fashion in her home, he was so attentive and courteous to her mother
and to herself all the time. It was wonderful to have his awareness in
the room. She felt rich and augmented by it, as if she were the
positive attraction and he the flow towards her. And his courtesy and
his agreement might be all her mother's, but the lambent flicker of his
body was for herself. She held it.</p>

<p>She must ever prove her power.</p>

<p>&quot;I meant to show you my little wood-carving,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure it's not worth showing, that,&quot; said her father.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to see it?&quot; she asked, leaning towards the door.</p>

<p>And his body had risen from the chair, though his face seemed to want
to agree with her parents.</p>

<p>&quot;It is in the shed,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>And he followed her out of the door, whatever his feelings might be.</p>

<p>In the shed they played at kisses, really played at kisses. It was a
delicious, exciting game. She turned to him, her face all laughing,
like a challenge. And he accepted the challenge at once. He twined his
hand full of her hair, and gently, with his hand wrapped round with
hair behind her head, gradually brought her face nearer to his, whilst
she laughed breathless with challenge, and his eyes gleamed with
answer, with enjoyment of the game. And he kissed her, asserting his
will over her, and she kissed him back, asserting her deliberate
enjoyment of him. Daring and reckless and dangerous they knew it was,
their game, each playing with fire, not with love. A sort of defiance
of all the world possessed her in it-she would kiss him just because
she wanted to. And a dare-devilry in him, like a cynicism, a cut at
everything he pretended to serve, retaliated in him.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful then, so wide opened, so radiant, so
palpitating, exquisitely vulnerable and poignantly, wrongly, throwing
herself to risk. It roused a sort of madness in him. Like a flower
shaking and wide-opened in the sun, she tempted him and challenged
him, and he accepted the challenge, something went fixed in him. And
under all her laughing, poignant recklessness was the quiver of tears.
That almost sent him mad, mad with desire, with pain, whose only issue
was through possession of her body.</p>

<p>So, shaken, afraid, they went back to her parents in the kitchen, and
dissimulated. But something was roused in both of them that they could
not now allay. It intensified and heightened their senses, they were
more vivid, and powerful in their being. But under it all was a
poignant sense of transience. It was a magnificent self-assertion on
the part of both of them, he asserted himself before her, he felt
himself infinitely male and infinitely irresistible, she asserted
herself before him, she knew herself infinitely desirable, and hence
infinitely strong. And after all, what could either of them get from
such a passion but a sense of his or of her own maximum self, in
contradistinction to all the rest of life? Wherein was something finite
and sad, for the human soul at its maximum wants a sense of the
infinite.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was begun now, this passion, and must go on, the
passion of Ursula to know her own maximum self, limited and so defined
against him. She could limit and define herself against him, the male,
she could be her maximum self, female, oh female, triumphant for one
moment in exquisite assertion against the male, in supreme
contradistinction to the male.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, when he came, prowling, she went with him across to
the church. Her father was gradually gathering in anger against him,
her mother was hardening in anger against her. But the parents were
naturally tolerant in action.</p>

<p>They went together across the churchyard, Ursula and Skrebensky, and
ran to hiding in the church. It was dimmer in there than the sunny
afternoon outside, but the mellow glow among the bowed stone was very
sweet. The windows burned in ruby and in blue, they made magnificent
arras to their bower of secret stone.</p>

<p>&quot;What a perfect place for a rendezvous,&quot; he said, in a hushed voice,
glancing round.</p>

<p>She too glanced round the familiar interior. The dimness and stillness
chilled her. But her eyes lit up with daring. Here, here she would
assert her indomitable gorgeous female self, here. Here she would open
her female flower like a flame, in this dimness that was more
passionate than light.</p>

<p>They hung apart a moment, then wilfully turned to each other for the
desired contact. She put her arms round him, she cleaved her body to
his, and with her hands pressed upon his shoulders, on his back, she
seemed to feel right through him, to know his young, tense body right
through. And it was so fine, so hard, yet so exquisitely subject and
under her control. She reached him her mouth and drank his full kiss,
drank it fuller and fuller.</p>

<p>And it was so good, it was very, very good. She seemed to be filled
with his kiss, filled as if she had drunk strong, glowing sunshine. She
glowed all inside, the sunshine seemed to beat upon her heart
underneath, she had drunk so beautifully.</p>

<p>She drew away, and looked at him radiant, exquisitely, glowingly
beautiful, and satisfied, but radiant as an illumined cloud.</p>

<p>To him this was bitter, that she was so radiant and satisfied. She
laughed upon him, blind to him, so full of her own bliss, never
doubting but that he was the same as she was. And radiant as an angel
she went with him out of the church, as if her feet were beams of light
that walked on flowers for footsteps.</p>

<p>He went beside her, his soul clenched, his body unsatisfied. Was she
going to make this easy triumph over him? For him, there was now no
self-bliss, only pain and confused anger.</p>

<p>It was high summer, and the hay-harvest was almost over. It would be
finished on Saturday. On Saturday, however, Skrebensky was going away.
He could not stay any longer.</p>

<p>Having decided to go he became very tender and loving to her, kissing
her gently, with such soft, sweet, insidious closeness that they were
both of them intoxicated.</p>

<p>The very last Friday of his stay he met her coming out of school, and
took her to tea in the town. Then he had a motor-car to drive her home.</p>

<p>Her excitement at riding in a motor-car was greatest of all. He too was
very proud of this last coup. He saw Ursula kindle and flare up to the
romance of the situation. She raised her head like a young horse
snuffing with wild delight.</p>

<p>The car swerved round a corner, and Ursula was swung against
Skrebensky. The contact made her aware of him. With a swift, foraging
impulse she sought for his hand and clasped it in her own, so close, so
combined, as if they were two children.</p>

<p>The wind blew in on Ursula's face, the mud flew in a soft, wild rush
from the wheels, the country was blackish green, with the silver of new
hay here and there, and masses of trees under a silver-gleaming sky.</p>

<p>Her hand tightened on his with a new consciousness, troubled. They did
not speak for some time, but sat, hand-fast, with averted, shining
faces.</p>

<p>And every now and then the car swung her against him. And they waited
for the motion to bring them together. Yet they stared out of the
windows, mute.</p>

<p>She saw the familiar country racing by. But now, it was no familiar
country, it was wonderland. There was the Hemlock Stone standing on its
grassy hill. Strange it looked on this wet, early summer evening,
remote, in a magic land. Some rooks were flying out of the trees.</p>

<p>Ah, if only she and Skrebensky could get out, dismount into this
enchanted land where nobody had ever been before! Then they would be
enchanted people, they would put off the dull, customary self. If she
were wandering there, on that hill-slope under a silvery, changing sky,
in which many rooks melted like hurrying showers of blots! If they
could walk past the wetted hay-swaths, smelling the early evening, and
pass in to the wood where the honeysuckle scent was sweet on the cold
tang in the air, and showers of drops fell when one brushed a bough,
cold and lovely on the face!</p>

<p>But she was here with him in the car, close to him, and the wind was
rushing on her lifted, eager face, blowing back the hair. He turned and
looked at her, at her face clean as a chiselled thing, her hair
chiselled back by the wind, her fine nose keen and lifted.</p>

<p>It was agony to him, seeing her swift and clean-cut and virgin. He
wanted to kill himself, and throw his detested carcase at her feet. His
desire to turn round on himself and rend himself was an agony to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly she glanced at him. He seemed to be crouching towards her,
reaching, he seemed to wince between the brows. But instantly, seeing
her lighted eyes and radiant face, his expression changed, his old
reckless laugh shone to her. She pressed his hand in utter delight, and
he abided. And suddenly she stooped and kissed his hand, bent her head
and caught it to her mouth, in generous homage. And the blood burned in
him. Yet he remained still, he made no move.</p>

<p>She started. They were swinging into Cossethay. Skrebensky was going to
leave her. But it was all so magic, her cup was so full of bright wine,
her eyes could only shine.</p>

<p>He tapped and spoke to the man. The car swung up by the yew trees. She
gave him her hand and said good-bye, naive and brief as a schoolgirl.
And she stood watching him go, her face shining. The fact of his
driving on meant nothing to her, she was so filled by her own bright
ecstacy. She did not see him go, for she was filled with light, which
was of him. Bright with an amazing light as she was, how could she miss
him.</p>

<p>In her bedroom she threw her arms in the air in clear pain of
magnificence. Oh, it was her transfiguration, she was beyond herself.
She wanted to fling herself into all the hidden brightness of the air.
It was there, it was there, if she could but meet it.</p>

<p>But the next day she knew he had gone. Her glory had partly died
down-but never from her memory. It was too real. Yet it was gone by,
leaving a wistfulness. A deeper yearning came into her soul, a new
reserve.</p>

<p>She shrank from touch and question. She was very proud, but very new,
and very sensitive. Oh, that no one should lay hands on her!</p>

<p>She was happier running on by herself. Oh, it was a joy to run along
the lanes without seeing things, yet being with them. It was such a joy
to be alone with all one's riches.</p>

<p>The holidays came, when she was free. She spent most of her time
running on by herself, curled up in a squirrel-place in the garden,
lying in a hammock in the coppice, while the birds came near-near-so
near. Oh, in rainy weather, she flitted to the Marsh, and lay hidden
with her book in a hay-loft.</p>

<p>All the time, she dreamed of him, sometimes definitely, but when she
was happiest, only vaguely. He was the warm colouring of her dreams, he
was the hot blood beating within them.</p>

<p>When she was less happy, out of sorts, she pondered over his
appearance, his clothes, the buttons with his regimental badge, which
he had given her. Or she tried to imagine his life in barracks. Or she
conjured up a vision of herself as she appeared in his eyes.</p>

<p>His birthday was in August, and she spent some pains on making him a
cake. She felt that it would not be in good taste for her to give him a
present.</p>

<p>Their correspondence was brief, mostly an exchange of post-cards, not
at all frequent. But with her cake she must send him a letter.</p>

<p>&quot;DEAR ANTON. THE SUNSHINE HAS COME BACK SPECIALLY FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,
I THINK.</p>

<p>&quot;I MADE THE CAKE MYSELF, AND WISH YOU MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF THE DAY.
DON'T EAT IT IF IT IS NOT GOOD. MOTHER HOPES YOU WILL COME AND SEE US
WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ENOUGH.</p>

<p>&quot;I AM</p>

<p>&quot;YOUR SINCERE FRIEND,</p>

<p>&quot;URSULA BRANGWEN.&quot;</p>

<p>It bored her to write a letter even to him. After all, writing words on
paper had nothing to do with him and her.</p>

<p>The fine weather had set in, the cutting machine went on from dawn till
sunset, chattering round the fields. She heard from Skrebensky; he too
was on duty in the country, on Salisbury Plain. He was now a second
lieutenant in a Field Troop. He would have a few days off shortly, and
would come to the Marsh for the wedding.</p>

<p>Fred Brangwen was going to marry a schoolmistress out of Ilkeston as
soon as corn-harvest was at an end.</p>

<p>The dim blue-and-gold of a hot, sweet autumn saw the close of the
corn-harvest. To Ursula, it was as if the world had opened its softest
purest flower, its chicory flower, its meadow saffron. The sky was blue
and sweet, the yellow leaves down the lane seemed like free, wandering
flowers as they chittered round the feet, making a keen, poignant,
almost unbearable music to her heart. And the scents of autumn were
like a summer madness to her. She fled away from the little, purple-red
button-chrysanthemums like a frightened dryad, the bright yellow little
chrysanthemums smelled so strong, her feet seemed to dither in a
drunken dance.</p>

<p>Then her Uncle Tom appeared, always like the cynical Bacchus in the
picture. He would have a jolly wedding, a harvest supper and a wedding
feast in one: a tent in the home close, and a band for dancing, and a
great feast out of doors.</p>

<p>Fred demurred, but Tom must be satisfied. Also Laura, a handsome,
clever girl, the bride, she also must have a great and jolly feast. It
appealed to her educated sense. She had been to Salisbury Training
College, knew folk-songs and morris-dancing.</p>

<p>So the preparations were begun, directed by Tom Brangwen. A marquee was
set up on the home close, two large bonfires were prepared. Musicians
were hired, feast made ready.</p>

<p>Skrebensky was to come, arriving in the morning. Ursula had a new white
dress of soft crepe, and a white hat. She liked to wear white. With her
black hair and clear golden skin, she looked southern, or rather
tropical, like a Creole. She wore no colour whatsoever.</p>

<p>She trembled that day as she appeared to go down to the wedding. She
was to be a bridesmaid. Skrebensky would not arrive till afternoon. The
wedding was at two o'clock.</p>

<p>As the wedding-party returned home, Skrebensky stood in the parlour at
the Marsh. Through the window he saw Tom Brangwen, who was best man,
coming up the garden path most elegant in cut-away coat and white slip
and spats, with Ursula laughing on his arm. Tom Brangwen was handsome,
with his womanish colouring and dark eyes and black close-cut
moustache. But there was something subtly coarse and suggestive about
him for all his beauty; his strange, bestial nostrils opened so hard
and wide, and his well-shaped head almost disquieting in its nakedness,
rather bald from the front, and all its soft fulness betrayed.</p>

<p>Skrebensky saw the man rather than the woman. She saw only the slender,
unchangeable youth waiting there inscrutable, like her fate. He was
beyond her, with his loose, slightly horsey appearance, that made him
seem very manly and foreign. Yet his face was smooth and soft and
impressionable. She shook hands with him, and her voice was like the
rousing of a bird startled by the dawn.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it nice,&quot; she cried, &quot;to have a wedding?&quot;</p>

<p>There were bits of coloured confetti lodged on her dark hair.</p>

<p>Again the confusion came over him, as if he were losing himself and
becoming all vague, undefined, inchoate. Yet he wanted to be hard,
manly, horsey. And he followed her.</p>

<p>There was a light tea, and the guests scattered. The real feast was for
the evening. Ursula walked out with Skrebensky through the stackyard to
the fields, and up the embankment to the canal-side.</p>

<p>The new corn-stacks were big and golden as they went by, an army of
white geese marched aside in braggart protest. Ursula was light as a
white ball of down. Skrebensky drifted beside her, indefinite, his old
from loosened, and another self, grey, vague, drifting out as from a
bud. They talked lightly, of nothing.</p>

<p>The blue way of the canal wound softly between the autumn hedges, on
towards the greenness of a small hill. On the left was the whole black
agitation of colliery and railway and the town which rose on its hill,
the church tower topping all. The round white dot of the clock on the
tower was distinct in the evening light.</p>

<p>That way, Ursula felt, was the way to London, through the grim,
alluring seethe of the town. On the other hand was the evening, mellow
over the green water-meadows and the winding alder trees beside the
river, and the pale stretches of stubble beyond. There the evening
glowed softly, and even a pee-wit was flapping in solitude and peace.</p>

<p>Ursula and Anton Skrebensky walked along the ridge of the canal
between. The berries on the hedges were crimson and bright red, above
the leaves. The glow of evening and the wheeling of the solitary
pee-wit and the faint cry of the birds came to meet the shuffling noise
of the pits, the dark, fuming stress of the town opposite, and they two
walked the blue strip of water-way, the ribbon of sky between.</p>

<p>He was looking, Ursula thought, very beautiful, because of a flush of
sunburn on his hands and face. He was telling her how he had learned to
shoe horses and select cattle fit for killing.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like to be a soldier?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not exactly a soldier,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;But you only do things for wars,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to go to war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I? Well, it would be exciting. If there were a war I would want to
go.&quot;</p>

<p>A strange, distracted feeling came over her, a sense of potent
unrealities.</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you want to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should be doing something, it would be genuine. It's a sort of
toy-life as it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what would you be doing if you went to war?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would be making railways or bridges, working like a nigger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you'd only make them to be pulled down again when the armies had
done with them. It seems just as much a game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you call war a game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's about the most serious business there is, fighting.&quot;</p>

<p>A sense of hard separateness came over her.</p>

<p>&quot;Why is fighting more serious than anything else?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You either kill or get killed-and I suppose it is serious enough,
killing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when you're dead you don't matter any more,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He was silenced for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;But the result matters,&quot; he said. &quot;It matters whether we settle the
Mahdi or not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to you-nor me-we don't care about Khartoum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You want to have room to live in: and somebody has to make room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't want to live in the desert of Sahara-do you?&quot; she replied,
laughing with antagonism.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't-but we've got to back up those who do.</p>

<p>&quot;Why have we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is the nation if we don't?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we aren't the nation. There are heaps of other people who are the
nation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They might say they weren't either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if everybody said it, there wouldn't be a nation. But I should
still be myself,&quot; she asserted brilliantly.</p>

<p>&quot;You wouldn't be yourself if there were no nation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because you'd just be a prey to everybody and anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How a prey?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'd come and take everything you'd got.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they couldn't take much even then. I don't care what they take.
I'd rather have a robber who carried me off than a millionaire who gave
me everything you can buy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's because you are a romanticist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am. I want to be romantic. I hate houses that never go away,
and people just living in the houses. It's all so stiff and stupid. I
hate soldiers, they are stiff and wooden. What do you fight for,
really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would fight for the nation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For all that, you aren't the nation. What would you do for yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I belong to the nation and must do my duty by the nation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when it didn't need your services in particular-when there is no
fighting? What would you do then?&quot;</p>

<p>He was irritated.</p>

<p>&quot;I would do what everybody else does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. I would be in readiness for when I was needed.&quot;</p>

<p>The answer came in exasperation.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to me,&quot; she answered, &quot;as if you weren't anybody-as if there
weren't anybody there, where you are. Are you anybody, really? You seem
like nothing to me.&quot;</p>

<p>They had walked till they had reached a wharf, just above a lock. There
an empty barge, painted with a red and yellow cabin hood, but with a
long, coal-black hold, was lying moored. A man, lean and grimy, was
sitting on a box against the cabin-side by the door, smoking, and
nursing a baby that was wrapped in a drab shawl, and looking into the
glow of evening. A woman bustled out, sent a pail dashing into the
canal, drew her water, and bustled in again. Children's voices were
heard. A thin blue smoke ascended from the cabin chimney, there was a
smell of cooking.</p>

<p>Ursula, white as a moth, lingered to look. Skrebensky lingered by her.
The man glanced up.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening,&quot; he called, half impudent, half attracted. He had blue
eyes which glanced impudently from his grimy face.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening,&quot; said Ursula, delighted. &quot;Isn't it nice. now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay,&quot; said the man, &quot;very nice.&quot;</p>

<p>His mouth was red under his ragged, sandy moustache. His teeth were
white as he laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but - &quot; stammered Ursula, laughing, &quot;it is. Why do you say it as if
it weren't?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Appen for them as is childt-nursin' it's none so rosy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I look inside your barge?&quot; asked Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;There's nobody'll stop you; you come if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>The barge lay at the opposite bank, at the wharf. It was the Annabel,
belonging to J. Ruth of Loughborough. The man watched Ursula closely
from his keen, twinkling eyes. His fair hair was wispy on his grimed
forehead. Two dirty children appeared to see who was talking.</p>

<p>Ursula glanced at the great lock gates. They were shut, and the water
was sounding, spurting and trickling down in the gloom beyond. On this
side the bright water was almost to the top of the gate. She went
boldly across, and round to the wharf.</p>

<p>Stooping from the bank, she peeped into the cabin, where was a red glow
of fire and the shadowy figure of a woman. She did want to go down.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll mess your frock,&quot; said the man, warningly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be careful,&quot; she answered. &quot;May I come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ay, come if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>She gathered her skirts, lowered her foot to the side of the boat, and
leapt down, laughing. Coal-dust flew up.</p>

<p>The woman came to the door. She was plump and sandy-haired, young, with
an odd, stubby nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you will make a mess of yourself,&quot; she cried, surprised and
laughing with a little wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;I did want to see. Isn't it lovely living on a barge?&quot; asked Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't live on one altogether,&quot; said the woman cheerfully.</p>

<p>&quot;She's got her parlour an' her plush suite in Loughborough,&quot; said her
husband with just pride.</p>

<p>Ursula peeped into the cabin, where saucepans were boiling and some
dishes were on the table. It was very hot. Then she came out again. The
man was talking to the baby. It was a blue-eyed, fresh-faced thing with
floss of red-gold hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a boy or a girl?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a girl-aren't you a girl, eh?&quot; he shouted at the infant, shaking
his head. Its little face wrinkled up into the oddest, funniest smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Ursula. &quot;Oh, the dear! Oh, how nice when she laughs!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She'll laugh hard enough,&quot; said the father.</p>

<p>&quot;What is her name?&quot; asked Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;She hasn't got a name, she's not worth one,&quot; said the man. &quot;Are you,
you fag-end o' nothing?&quot; he shouted to the baby. The baby laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;No we've been that busy, we've never took her to th' registry office,&quot;
came the woman's voice. &quot;She was born on th' boat here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you know what you're going to call her?&quot; asked Ursula.</p>

<p>&quot;We did think of Gladys Em'ly,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;We thought of nowt o' th' sort,&quot; said the father.</p>

<p>&quot;Hark at him! What do you want?' cried the mother in exasperation.</p>

<p>&quot;She'll be called Annabel after th' boat she was born on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's not, so there,&quot; said the mother, viciously defiant</p>

<p>The father sat in humorous malice, grinning.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you'll see,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>And Ursula could tell, by the woman's vibrating exasperation, that he
would never give way.</p>

<p>&quot;They're all nice names,&quot; she said. &quot;Call her Gladys Annabel Emily.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, that's heavy-laden, if you like,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;You see!&quot; cried the woman. &quot;He's that pig-headed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And she's so nice, and she laughs, and she hasn't even got a name,&quot;
crooned Ursula to the child.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me hold her,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>He yielded her the child, that smelt of babies. But it had such blue,
wide, china blue eyes, and it laughed so oddly, with such a taking
grimace, Ursula loved it. She cooed and talked to it. It was such an
odd, exciting child.</p>

<p>&quot;What's your name?&quot; the man suddenly asked of her.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Ursula-Ursula Brangwen,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Ursula!&quot; he exclaimed, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a Saint Ursula. It's a very old name,&quot; she added hastily, in
justification.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, mother!&quot; he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Pem!&quot; he called, &quot;can't y'hear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; came the short answer.</p>

<p>&quot;What about 'Ursula'?&quot; he grinned.</p>

<p>&quot;What about what?&quot; came the answer, and the woman appeared in the
doorway, ready for combat.</p>

<p>&quot;Ursula-it's the lass's name there,&quot; he said, gently.</p>

<p>The woman looked the young girl up and down. Evidently she was
attracted by her slim, graceful, new beauty, her effect of white
elgegance, and her tender way of holding the child.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, how do you write it?&quot; the mother asked, awkward now she was
touched. Ursula spelled out her name. The man looked at the woman. A
bright, confused flush came over the mother's face, a sort of luminous
shyness.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a common name, is it!&quot; she exclaimed, excited as by an
adventure.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you goin' to have it then?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather have it than Annabel,&quot; she said, decisively.</p>

<p>&quot;An' I'd rather have it than Gladys Em'ler,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>There was a silence, Ursula looked up.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you really call her Ursula?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ursula Ruth,&quot; replied the man, laughing vainly, as pleased as if he
had found something.</p>

<p>It was now Ursula's turn to be confused.</p>

<p>&quot;It does sound awfully nice,&quot; she said. &quot;I must give her something. And
I haven't got anything at all.&quot;</p>

<p>She stood in her white dress, wondering, down there in the barge. The
lean man sitting near to her watched her as if she were a strange
being, as if she lit up his face. His eyes smiled on her, boldly, and
yet with exceeding admiration underneath.</p>

<p>&quot;Could I give her my necklace?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>It was the little necklace made of pieces of amethyst and topaz and
pearl and crystal, strung at intervals on a little golden chain, which
her Uncle Tom had given her. She was very fond of it. She looked at it
lovingly, when she had taken it from her neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it valuable?&quot; the man asked her, curiously.</p>

<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>&quot;The stones and pearl are real; it is worth three or four pounds,&quot; said
Skrebensky from the wharf above. Ursula could tell he disapproved of
her.</p>

<p>&quot;I must give it to your baby-may I?&quot; she said to the bargee.</p>

<p>He flushed, and looked away into the evening.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he said, &quot;it's not for me to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What would your father and mother say?&quot; cried the woman curiously,
from the door.</p>

<p>&quot;It is my own,&quot; said Ursula, and she dangled the little glittering
string before the baby. The infant spread its little fingers. But it
could not grasp. Ursula closed the tiny hand over the jewel. The baby
waved the bright ends of the string. Ursula had given her necklace
away. She felt sad. But she did not want it back.</p>

<p>The jewel swung from the baby's hand and fell in a little heap on the
coal-dusty bottom of the barge. The man groped for it, with a kind of
careful reverence. Ursula noticed the coarsened, blunted fingers
groping at the little jewelled heap. The skin was red on the back of
the hand, the fair hairs glistened stiffly. It was a thin, sinewy,
capable hand nevertheless, and Ursula liked it. He took up the necklace
carefully, and blew the coal-dust from it, as it lay in the hollow of
his hand. He seemed still and attentive. He held out his hand with the
necklace shining small in its hard, black hollow.</p>

<p>&quot;Take it back,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Ursula hardened with a kind of radiance.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;It belongs to little Ursula.&quot;</p>

<p>And she went to the infant and fastened the necklace round its warm,
soft, weak little neck.</p>

<p>There was a moment of confusion, then the father bent over his child:</p>

<p>&quot;What do you say?&quot; he said. &quot;Do you say thank you? Do you say thank
you, Ursula?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her name's Ursula now,&quot; said the mother, smiling a little bit
ingratiatingly from the door. And she came out to examine the jewel on
the child's neck.</p>

<p>&quot;It is Ursula, isn't it?&quot; said Ursula Brangwen.</p>

<p>The father looked up at her, with an intimate, half-gallant,
half-impudent, but wistful look. His captive soul loved her: but his
soul was captive, he knew, always.</p>

<p>She wanted to go. He set a little ladder for her to climb up to the
wharf. She kissed the child, which was in its mother's arms, then she
turned away. The mother was effusive. The man stood silent by the
ladder.</p>

<p>Ursula joined Skrebensky. The two young figures crossed the lock, above
the shining yellow water. The barge-man watched them go.</p>

<p>&quot;I loved them,&quot; she was saying. &quot;He was so gentle-oh, so gentle! And
the baby was such a dear!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was he gentle?&quot; said Skrebensky. &quot;The woman had been a servant, I'm
sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Ursula winced.</p>

<p>&quot;But I loved his impudence-it was so gentle underneath.&quot;</p>

<p>She went hastening on, gladdened by having met the grimy, lean man with
the ragged moustache. He gave her a pleasant warm feeling. He made her
feel the richness of her own life. Skrebensky, somehow, had created a
deadness round her, a sterility, as if the world were ashes.</p>

<p>They said very little as they hastened home to the big supper. He was
envying the lean father of three children, for his impudent directness
and his worship of the woman in Ursula, a worship of body and soul
together, the man's body and soul wistful and worshipping the body and
spirit of the girl, with a desire that knew the inaccessibility of its
object, but was only glad to know that the perfect thing existed, glad
to have had a moment of communion.</p>

<p>Why could not he himself desire a woman so? Why did he never really
want a woman, not with the whole of him: never loved, never worshipped,
only just physically wanted her.</p>

<p>But he would want her with his body, let his soul do as it would. A
kind of flame of physical desire was gradually beating up in the Marsh,
kindled by Tom Brangwen, and by the fact of the wedding of Fred, the
shy, fair, stiff-set farmer with the handsome, half-educated girl. Tom
Brangwen, with all his secret power, seemed to fan the flame that was
rising. The bride was strongly attracted by him, and he was exerting
his influence on another beautiful, fair girl, chill and burning as the
sea, who said witty things which he appreciated, making her glint with
more, like phosphorescence. And her greenish eyes seemed to rock a
secret, and her hands like mother-of-pearl seemed luminous,
transparent, as if the secret were burning visible in them.</p>

<p>At the end of supper, during dessert, the music began to play, violins,
and flutes. Everybody's face was lit up. A glow of excitement
prevailed. When the little speeches were over, and the port remained
unreached for any more, those who wished were invited out to the open
for coffee. The night was warm.</p>

<p>Bright stars were shining, the moon was not yet up. And under the stars
burned two great, red, flameless fires, and round these lights and
lanterns hung, the marquee stood open before a fire, with its lights
inside.</p>

<p>The young people flocked out into the mysterious night. There was sound
of laughter and voices, and a scent of coffee. The farm-buildings
loomed dark in the background. Figures, pale and dark, flitted about,
intermingling. The red fire glinted on a white or a silken skirt, the
lanterns gleamed on the transient heads of the wedding guests.</p>

<p>To Ursula it was wonderful. She felt she was a new being. The darkness
seemed to breathe like the sides of some great beast, the haystacks
loomed half-revealed, a crowd of them, a dark, fecund lair just behind.
Waves of delirious darkness ran through her soul. She wanted to let go.
She wanted to reach and be amongst the flashing stars, she wanted to
race with her feet and be beyond the confines of this earth. She was
mad to be gone. It was as if a hound were straining on the leash, ready
to hurl itself after a nameless quarry into the dark. And she was the
quarry, and she was also the hound. The darkness was passionate and
breathing with immense, unperceived heaving. It was waiting to receive
her in her flight. And how could she start-and how could she let go?
She must leap from the known into the unknown. Her feet and hands beat
like a madness, her breast strained as if in bonds.</p>

<p>The music began, and the bonds began to slip. Tom Brangwen was dancing
with the bride, quick and fluid and as if in another element,
inaccessible as the creatures that move in the water. Fred Brangwen
went in with another partner. The music came in waves. One couple after
another was washed and absorbed into the deep underwater of the dance.</p>

<p>&quot;Come,&quot; said Ursula to Skrebensky, laying her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>At the touch of her hand on his arm, his consciousness melted away from
him. He took her into his arms, as if into the sure, subtle power of
his will, and they became one movement, one dual movement, dancing on
the slippery grass. It would be endless, this movement, it would
continue for ever. It was his will and her will locked in a trance of
motion, two wills locked in one motion, yet never fusing, never
yielding one to the other. It was a glaucous, intertwining, delicious
flux and contest in flux.</p>

<p>They were both absorbed into a profound silence, into a deep, fluid
underwater energy that gave them unlimited strength. All the dancers
were waving intertwined in the flux of music. Shadowy couples passed
and repassed before the fire, the dancing feet danced silently by into
the darkness. It was a vision of the depths of the underworld, under
the great flood.</p>

<p>There was a wonderful rocking of the darkness, slowly, a great, slow
swinging of the whole night, with the music playing lightly on the
surface, making the strange, ecstatic, rippling on the surface of the
dance, but underneath only one great flood heaving slowly backwards to
the verge of oblivion, slowly forward to the other verge, the heart
sweeping along each time, and tightening with anguish as the limit was
reached, and the movement, at crises, turned and swept back.</p>

<p>As the dance surged heavily on, Ursula was aware of some influence
looking in upon her. Something was looking at her. Some powerful,
glowing sight was looking right into her, not upon her, but right at
her. Out of the great distance, and yet imminent, the powerful,
overwhelming watch was kept upon her. And she danced on and on with
Skrebensky, while the great, white watching continued, balancing all in
its revelation.</p>

<p>&quot;The moon has risen,&quot; said Anton, as the music ceased, and they found
themselves suddenly stranded, like bits of jetsam on a shore. She
turned, and saw a great white moon looking at her over the hill. And
her breast opened to it, she was cleaved like a transparent jewel to
its light. She stood filled with the full moon, offering herself. Her
two breasts opened to make way for it, her body opened wide like a
quivering anemone, a soft, dilated invitation touched by the moon. She
wanted the moon to fill in to her, she wanted more, more communion with
the moon, consummation. But Skrebensky put his arm round her, and led
her away. He put a big, dark cloak round her, and sat holding her hand,
whilst the moonlight streamed above the glowing fires.</p>

<p>She was not there. Patiently she sat, under the cloak, with Skrebensky
holding her hand. But her naked self was away there beating upon the
moonlight, dashing the moonlight with her breasts and her knees, in
meeting, in communion. She half started, to go in actuality, to fling
away her clothing and flee away, away from this dark confusion and
chaos of people to the hill and the moon. But the people stood round
her like stones, like magnetic stones, and she could not go, in
actuality. Skrebensky, like a load-stone weighed on her, the weight of
his presence detained her. She felt the burden of him, the blind,
persistent, inert burden. He was inert, and he weighed upon her. She
sighed in pain. Oh, for the coolness and entire liberty and brightness
of the moon. Oh, for the cold liberty to be herself, to do entirely as
she liked. She wanted to get right away. She felt like bright metal
weighted down by dark, impure magnetism. He was the dross, people were
the dross. If she could but get away to the clean free moonlight.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you like me to-night?&quot; said his low voice, the voice of the
shadow over her shoulder. She clenched her hands in the dewy brilliance
of the moon, as if she were mad.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you like me to-night?&quot; repeated the soft voice.</p>

<p>And she knew that if she turned, she would die. A strange rage filled
her, a rage to tear things asunder. Her hands felt destructive, like
metal blades of destruction.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me alone,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>A darkness, an obstinacy settled on him too, in a kind of inertia. He
sat inert beside her. She threw off her cloak and walked towards the
moon, silver-white herself. He followed her closely.</p>

<p>The music began again and the dance. He appropriated her. There was a
fierce, white, cold passion in her heart. But he held her close, and
danced with her. Always present, like a soft weight upon her, bearing
her down, was his body against her as they danced. He held her very
close, so that she could feel his body, the weight of him sinking,
settling upon her, overcoming her life and energy, making her inert
along with him, she felt his hands pressing behind her, upon her. But
still in her body was the subdued, cold, indomitable passion. She liked
the dance: it eased her, put her into a sort of trance. But it was only
a kind of waiting, of using up the time that intervened between her and
her pure being. She left herself against him, she let him exert all his
power over her, to bear her down. She received all the force of his
power. She even wished he might overcome her. She was cold and unmoved
as a pillar of salt.</p>

<p>His will was set and straining with all its tension to encompass him
and compel her. If he could only compel her. He seemed to be
annihilated. She was cold and hard and compact of brilliance as the
moon itself, and beyond him as the moonlight was beyond him, never to
be grasped or known. If he could only set a bond round her and compel her!</p>

<p>So they danced four or five dances, always together, always his will
becoming more tense, his body more subtle, playing upon her. And still
he had not got her, she was hard and bright as ever, intact. But he
must weave himself round her, enclose her, enclose her in a net of
shadow, of darkness, so she would be like a bright creature gleaming in
a net of shadows, caught. Then he would have her, he would enjoy her.
How he would enjoy her, when she was caught.</p>

<p>At last, when the dance was over, she would not sit down, she walked
away. He came with his arm round her, keeping her upon the movement of
his walking. And she seemed to agree. She was bright as a piece of
moonlight, as bright as a steel blade, he seemed to be clasping a blade
that hurt him. Yet he would clasp her, if it killed him.</p>

<p>They went towards the stackyard. There he saw, with something like
terror, the great new stacks of corn glistening and gleaming
transfigured, silvery and present under the night-blue sky, throwing
dark, substantial shadows, but themselves majestic and dimly present.
She, like glimmering gossamer, seemed to burn among them, as they rose
like cold fires to the silvery-bluish air. All was intangible, a
burning of cold, glimmering, whitish-steely fires. He was afraid of the
great moon-conflagration of the cornstacks rising above him. His heart
grew smaller, it began to fuse like a bead. He knew he would die.</p>

<p>She stood for some moments out in the overwhelming luminosity of the
moon. She seemed a beam of gleaming power. She was afraid of what she
was. Looking at him, at his shadowy, unreal, wavering presence a sudden
lust seized her, to lay hold of him and tear him and make him into
nothing. Her hands and wrists felt immeasurably hard and strong, like
blades. He waited there beside her like a shadow which she wanted to
dissipate, destroy as the moonlight destroys a darkness, annihilate,
have done with. She looked at him and her face gleamed bright and
inspired. She tempted him.</p>

<p>And an obstinacy in him made him put his arm round her and draw her to
the shadow. She submitted: let him try what he could do. Let him try
what he could do. He leaned against the side of the stack, holding her.
The stack stung him keenly with a thousand cold, sharp flames. Still
obstinately he held her.</p>

<p>And timorously, his hands went over her, over the salt, compact
brilliance of her body. If he could but have her, how he would enjoy
her! If he could but net her brilliant, cold, salt-burning body in the
soft iron of his own hands, net her, capture her, hold her down, how
madly he would enjoy her. He strove subtly, but with all his energy, to
enclose her, to have her. And always she was burning and brilliant and
hard as salt, and deadly. Yet obstinately, all his flesh burning and
corroding, as if he were invaded by some consuming, scathing poison,
still he persisted, thinking at last he might overcome her. Even, in
his frenzy, he sought for her mouth with his mouth, though it was like
putting his face into some awful death. She yielded to him, and he
pressed himself upon her in extremity, his soul groaning over and over:</p>

<p>&quot;Let me come-let me come.&quot;</p>

<p>She took him in the kiss, hard her kiss seized upon him, hard and
fierce and burning corrosive as the moonlight. She seemed to be
destroying him. He was reeling, summoning all his strength to keep his
kiss upon her, to keep himself in the kiss.</p>

<p>But hard and fierce she had fastened upon him, cold as the moon and
burning as a fierce salt. Till gradually his warm, soft iron yielded,
yielded, and she was there fierce, corrosive, seething with his
destruction, seething like some cruel, corrosive salt around the last
substance of his being, destroying him, destroying him in the kiss. And
her soul crystallised with triumph, and his soul was dissolved with
agony and annihilation. So she held him there, the victim, consumed,
annihilated. She had triumphed: he was not any more.</p>

<p>Gradually she began to come to herself. Gradually a sort of daytime
consciousness came back to her. Suddenly the night was struck back into
its old, accustomed, mild reality. Gradually she realised that the
night was common and ordinary, that the great, blistering, transcendent
night did not really exist. She was overcome with slow horror. Where
was she? What was this nothingness she felt? The nothingness was
Skrebensky. Was he really there?-who was he? He was silent, he was not
there. What had happened? Had she been mad: what horrible thing had
possessed her? She was filled with overpowering fear of herself,
overpowering desire that it should not be, that other burning,
corrosive self. She was seized with a frenzied desire that what had
been should never be remembered, never be thought of, never be for one
moment allowed possible. She denied it with all her might. With all her
might she turned away from it. She was good, she was loving. Her heart
was warm, her blood was dark and warm and soft. She laid her hand
caressively on Anton's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it lovely?&quot; she said, softly, coaxingly, caressingly. And she
began to caress him to life again. For he was dead. And she intended
that he should never know, never become aware of what had been. She
would bring him back from the dead without leaving him one trace of
fact to remember his annihilation by.</p>

<p>She exerted all her ordinary, warm self, she touched him, she did him
homage of loving awareness. And gradually he came back to her, another
man. She was soft and winning and caressing. She was his servant, his
adoring slave. And she restored the whole shell of him. She restored
the whole form and figure of him. But the core was gone. His pride was
bolstered up, his blood ran once more in pride. But there was no core
to him: as a distinct male he had no core. His triumphant, flaming,
overweening heart of the intrinsic male would never beat again. He
would be subject now, reciprocal, never the indomitable thing with a
core of overweening, unabateable fire. She had abated that fire, she
had broken him.</p>

<p>But she caressed him. She would not have him remember what had been.
She would not remember herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss me, Anton, kiss me,&quot; she pleaded.</p>

<p>He kissed her, but she knew he could not touch her. His arms were round
her, but they had not got her. She could feel his mouth upon her, but
she was not at all compelled by it.</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss me,&quot; she whispered, in acute distress, &quot;kiss me.&quot;</p>

<p>And he kissed her as she bade him, but his heart was hollow. She took
his kisses, outwardly. But her soul was empty and finished.</p>

<p>Looking away, she saw the delicate glint of oats dangling from the side
of the stack, in the moonlight, something proud and royal, and quite
impersonal. She had been proud with them, where they were, she had been
also. But in this temporary warm world of the commonplace, she was a
kind, good girl. She reached out yearningly for goodness and affection.
She wanted to be kind and good.</p>

<p>They went home through the night that was all pale and glowing around,
with shadows and glimmerings and presences. Distinctly, she saw the
flowers in the hedge-bottoms, she saw the thin, raked sheaves flung
white upon the thorny hedge.</p>

<p>How beautiful, how beautiful it was! She thought with anguish how
wildly happy she was to-night, since he had kissed her. But as he
walked with his arm round her waist, she turned with a great offering
of herself to the night that glistened tremendous, a magnificent godly
moon white and candid as a bridegroom, flowers silvery and transformed
filling up the shadows.</p>

<p>He kissed her again, under the yew trees at home, and she left him. She
ran from the intrusion of her parents at home, to her bedroom, where,
looking out on the moonlit country, she stretched up her arms, hard,
hard, in bliss, agony offering herself to the blond, debonair presence
of the night.</p>

<p>But there was a wound of sorrow, she had hurt herself, as if she had
bruised herself, in annihilating him. She covered up her two young
breasts with her hands, covering them to herself; and covering herself
with herself, she crouched in bed, to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning the sun shone, she got up strong and dancing. Skrebensky
was still at the Marsh. He was coming to church. How lovely, how
amazing life was! On the fresh Sunday morning she went out to the
garden, among the yellows and the deep-vibrating reds of autumn, she
smelled the earth and felt the gossamer, the cornfields across the
country were pale and unreal, everywhere was the intense silence of the
Sunday morning, filled with unacquainted noises. She smelled the body
of the earth, it seemed to stir its powerful flank beneath her as she
stood. In the bluish air came the powerful exudation, the peace was the
peace of strong, exhausted breathing, the reds and yellows and the
white gleam of stubble were the quivers and motion of the last
subsiding transports and clear bliss of fulfilment.</p>

<p>The church-bells were ringing when he came. She looked up in keen
anticipation at his entry. But he was troubled and his pride was hurt.
He seemed very much clothed, she was conscious of his tailored suit.</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't it lovely last night?&quot; she whispered to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. But his face did not open nor become free.</p>

<p>The service and the singing in church that morning passed unnoticed by
her. She saw the coloured glow of the windows, the forms of the
worshippers. Only she glanced at the book of Genesis, which was her
favourite book in the Bible.</p>

<p>&quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of
the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon
the earth, and upon all the fishes in the sea; into your hand are they
delivered.</p>

<p>&quot;Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all things.&quot;</p>

<p>But Ursula was not moved by the history this morning. Multiplying and
replenishing the earth bored her. Altogether it seemed merely a vulgar
and stock-raising sort of business. She was left quite cold by man's
stock-breeding lordship over beast and fishes.</p>

<p>&quot;And you, be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
earth, and multiply therein.&quot;</p>

<p>In her soul she mocked at this multiplication, every cow becoming two
cows, every turnip ten turnips.</p>

<p>&quot;And God said; This is the token of the covenant which I make between
me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
generations;</p>

<p>&quot;I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a token of a covenant
between me and the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that a
bow shall be seen in the cloud;</p>

<p>&quot;And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every
living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall no more become a
flood to destroy all flesh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Destroy all flesh,&quot; why &quot;flesh&quot; in particular? Who was this lord of
flesh? After all, how big was the Flood? Perhaps a few dryads and fauns
had just run into the hills and the farther valleys and woods,
frightened, but most had gone on blithely unaware of any flood at all,
unless the nymphs should tell them. It pleased Ursula to think of the
naiads in Asia Minor meeting the nereids at the mouth of the streams,
where the sea washed against the fresh, sweet tide, and calling to
their sisters the news of Noah's Flood. They would tell amusing
accounts of Noah in his ark. Some nymphs would relate how they had hung
on the side of the ark, peeped in, and heard Noah and Shem and Ham and
Japeth, sitting in their place under the rain, saying, how they four
were the only men on earth now, because the Lord had drowned all the
rest, so that they four would have everything to themselves, and be
masters of every thing, sub-tenants under the great Proprietor.</p>

<p>Ursula wished she had been a nymph. She would have laughed through the
window of the ark, and flicked drops of the flood at Noah, before she
drifted away to people who were less important in their Proprietor and
their Flood.</p>

<p>What was God, after all? If maggots in a dead dog be but God kissing
carrion, what then is not God? She was surfeited of this God. She was
weary of the Ursula Brangwen who felt troubled about God. What ever God
was, He was, and there was no need for her to trouble about Him. She
felt she had now all licence.</p>

<p>Skrebensky sat beside her, listening to the sermon, to the voice of law
and order. &quot;The very hairs of your head are all numbered.&quot; He did not
believe it. He believed his own things were quite at his own disposal.
You could do as you liked with your own things, so long as you left
other people's alone.</p>

<p>Ursula caressed him and made love to him. Nevertheless he knew she
wanted to react upon him and to destroy his being. She was not with
him, she was against him. But her making love to him, her complete
admiration of him, in open life, gratified him.</p>

<p>She caught him out of himself, and they were lovers, in a young,
romantic, almost fantastic way. He gave her a little ring. They put it
in Rhine wine, in their glass, and she drank, then he drank. They drank
till the ring lay exposed at the bottom of the glass. Then she took the
simple jewel, and tied it on a thread round her neck, where she wore
it.</p>

<p>He asked her for a photograph when he was going away. She went in great
excitement to the photographer, with five shillings. The result was an
ugly little picture of herself with her mouth on one side. She wondered
over it and admired it.</p>

<p>He saw only the live face of the girl. The picture hurt him. He kept
it, he always remembered it, but he could scarcely bear to see it.
There was a hurt to his soul in the clear, fearless face that was
touched with abstraction. Its abstraction was certainly away from him.</p>

<p>Then war was declared with the Boers in South Africa, and everywhere
was a fizz of excitement. He wrote that he might have to go. And he
sent her a box of sweets.</p>

<p>She was slightly dazed at the thought of his going to the war, not
knowing how to feel. It was a sort of romantic situation that she knew
so well in fiction she hardly understood it in fact. Underneath a top
elation was a sort of dreariness, deep, ashy disappointment.</p>

<p>However, she secreted the sweets under her bed, and ate them all
herself, when she went to bed, and when she woke in the morning. All
the time she felt very guilty and ashamed, but she simply did not want
to share them.</p>

<p>That box of sweets remained stuck in her mind afterwards. Why had she
secreted them and eaten them every one? Why? She did not feel
guilty-she only knew she ought to feel guilty. And she could not make
up her mind. Curiously monumental that box of sweets stood up, now it
was empty. It was a crux for her. What was she to think of it?</p>

<p>The idea of war altogether made her feel uneasy, uneasy. When men began
organised fighting with each other it seemed to her as if the poles of
the universe were cracking, and the whole might go tumbling into the
bottomless pit. A horrible bottomless feeling she had. Yet of course
there was the minted superscription of romance and honour and even
religion about war. She was very confused.</p>

<p>Skrebensky was busy, he could not come to see her. She asked for no
assurance, no security. What was between them, was, and could not be
altered by avowals. She knew that by instinct, she trusted to the
intrinsic reality.</p>

<p>But she felt an agony of helplessness. She could do nothing. Vaguely
she knew the huge powers of the world rolling and crashing together,
darkly, clumsily, stupidly, yet colossal, so that one was brushed along
almost as dust. Helpless, helpless, swirling like dust! Yet she wanted
so hard to rebel, to rage, to fight. But with what?</p>

<p>Could she with her hands fight the face of the earth, beat the hills in
their places? Yet her breast wanted to fight, to fight the whole world.
And these two small hands were all she had to do it with.</p>

<p>The months went by, and it was Christmas-the snowdrops came. There was
a little hollow in the wood near Cossethay, where snowdrops grew wild.
She sent him some in a box, and he wrote her a quick little note of
thanks-very grateful and wistful he seemed. Her eyes grew childlike and
puzzled. Puzzled from day to day she went on, helpless, carried along
by all that must happen.</p>

<p>He went about at his duties, giving himself up to them. At the bottom
of his heart his self, the soul that aspired and had true hope of
self-effectuation lay as dead, still-born, a dead weight in his womb.
Who was he, to hold important his personal connection? What did a man
matter personally? He was just a brick in the whole great social
fabric, the nation, the modern humanity. His personal movements were
small, and entirely subsidiary. The whole form must be ensured, not
ruptured, for any personal reason whatsoever, since no personal reason
could justify such a breaking. What did personal intimacy matter? One
had to fill one's place in the whole, the great scheme of man's
elaborate civilisation, that was all. The Whole mattered-but the unit,
the person, had no importance, except as he represented the Whole.</p>

<p>So Skrebensky left the girl out and went his way, serving what he had
to serve, and enduring what he had to endure, without remark. To his
own intrinsic life, he was dead. And he could not rise again from the
dead. His soul lay in the tomb. His life lay in the established order
of things. He had his five senses too. They were to be gratified. Apart
from this, he represented the great, established, extant Idea of life,
and as this he was important and beyond question.</p>

<p>The good of the greatest number was all that mattered. That which was
the greatest good for them all, collectively, was the greatest good for
the individual. And so, every man must give himself to support the
state, and so labour for the greatest good of all. One might make
improvements in the state, perhaps, but always with a view to
preserving it intact.</p>

<p>No highest good of the community, however, would give him the vital
fulfilment of his soul. He knew this. But he did not consider the soul
of the individual sufficiently important. He believed a man was
important in so far as he represented all humanity.</p>

<p>He could not see, it was not born in him to see, that the highest good
of the community as it stands is no longer the highest good of even the
average individual. He thought that, because the community represents
millions of people, therefore it must be millions of times more
important than any individual, forgetting that the community is an
abstraction from the many, and is not the many themselves. Now when the
statement of the abstract good for the community has become a formula
lacking in all inspiration or value to the average intelligence, then
the &quot;common good&quot; becomes a general nuisance, representing the vulgar,
conservative materialism at a low level.</p>

<p>And by the highest good of the greatest number is chiefly meant the
material prosperity of all classes. Skrebensky did not really care
about his own material prosperity. If he had been penniless-well, he
would have taken his chances. Therefore how could he find his highest
good in giving up his life for the material prosperity of everybody
else! What he considered an unimportant thing for himself he could not
think worthy of every sacrifice on behalf of other people. And that
which he would consider of the deepest importance to himself as an
individual-oh, he said, you mustn't consider the community from that
standpoint. No-no-we know what the community wants; it wants something
solid, it wants good wages, equal opportunities, good conditions of
living, that's what the community wants. It doesn't want anything
subtle or difficult. Duty is very plain-keep in mind the material, the
immediate welfare of every man, that's all.</p>

<p>So there came over Skrebensky a sort of nullity, which more and more
terrified Ursula. She felt there was something hopeless which she had
to submit to. She felt a great sense of disaster impending. Day after
day was made inert with a sense of disaster. She became morbidly
sensitive, depressed, apprehensive. It was anguish to her when she saw
one rook slowly flapping in the sky. That was a sign of ill-omen. And
the foreboding became so black and so powerful in her, that she was
almost extinguished.</p>

<p>Yet what was the matter? At the worst he was only going away. Why did
she mind, what was it she feared? She did not know. Only she had a
black dread possessing her. When she went at night and saw the big,
flashing stars they seemed terrible, by day she was always expecting
some charge to be made against her.</p>

<p>He wrote in March to say that he was going to South Africa in a short
time, but before he went, he would snatch a day at the Marsh.</p>

<p>As if in a painful dream, she waited suspended, unresolved. She did not
know, she could not understand. Only she felt that all the threads of
her fate were being held taut, in suspense. She only wept sometimes as
she went about, saying blindly:</p>

<p>&quot;I am so fond of him, I am so fond of him.&quot;</p>

<p>He came. But why did he come? She looked at him for a sign. He gave no
sign. He did not even kiss her. He behaved as if he were an affable,
usual acquaintance. This was superficial, but what did it hide? She
waited for him, she wanted him to make some sign.</p>

<p>So the whole of the day they wavered and avoided contact, until
evening. Then, laughing, saying he would be back in six months' time
and would tell them all about it, he shook hands with her mother and
took his leave.</p>

<p>Ursula accompanied him into the lane. The night was windy, the yew
trees seethed and hissed and vibrated. The wind seemed to rush about
among the chimneys and the church-tower. It was dark.</p>

<p>The wind blew Ursula's face, and her clothes cleaved to her limbs. But
it was a surging, turgid wind, instinct with compressed vigour of life.
And she seemed to have lost Skrebensky. Out there in the strong, urgent
night she could not find him.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; came his bodiless voice.</p>

<p>And groping, she touched him. A fire like lightning drenched them.</p>

<p>&quot;Anton?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>She held him with her hands in the darkness, she felt his body again
with hers.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't leave me-come back to me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, holding her in his arms.</p>

<p>But the male in him was scotched by the knowledge that she was not
under his spell nor his influence. He wanted to go away from her. He
rested in the knowledge that to-morrow he was going away, his life was
really elsewhere. His life was elsewhere-his life was elsewhere-the
centre of his life was not what she would have. She was different-there
was a breach between them. They were hostile worlds.</p>

<p>&quot;You will come back to me?&quot; she reiterated.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. And he meant it. But as one keeps an appointment, not
as a man returning to his fulfilment.</p>

<p>So she kissed him, and went indoors, lost. He walked down to the Marsh
abstracted. The contact with her hurt him, and threatened him. He
shrank, he had to be free of her spirit. For she would stand before
him, like the angel before Balaam, and drive him back with a sword from
the way he was going, into a wilderness.</p>

<p>The next day she went to the station to see him go. She looked at him,
she turned to him, but he was always so strange and null-so null. He
was so collected. She thought it was that which made him null.
Strangely nothing he was.</p>

<p>Ursula stood near him with a mute, pale face which he would rather not
see. There seemed some shame at the very root of life, cold, dead shame
for her.</p>

<p>The three made a noticeable group on the station; the girl in her fur
cap and tippet and her olive green costume, pale, tense with youth,
isolated, unyielding; the soldierly young man in a crush hat and a
heavy overcoat, his face rather pale and reserved above his purple
scarf, his whole figure neutral; then the elder man, a fashionable
bowler hat pressed low over his dark brows, his face warm-coloured and
calm, his whole figure curiously suggestive of full-blooded
indifference; he was the eternal audience, the chorus, the spectator at
the drama; in his own life he would have no drama.</p>

<p>The train was rushing up. Ursula's heart heaved, but the ice was frozen
too strong upon it.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said, lifting her hand, her face laughing with her
peculiar, blind, almost dazzling laugh. She wondered what he was doing,
when he stooped and kissed her. He should be shaking hands and going.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said again.</p>

<p>He picked up his little bag and turned his back on her. There was a
hurry along the train. Ah, here was his carriage. He took his seat. Tom
Brangwen shut the door, and the two men shook hands as the whistle
went.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye-and good luck,&quot; said Brangwen.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you-good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>The train moved off. Skrebensky stood at the carriage window, waving,
but not really looking to the two figures, the girl and the
warm-coloured, almost effeminately-dressed man Ursula waved her
handkerchief. The train gathered speed, it grew smaller and smaller.
Still it ran in a straight line. The speck of white vanished. The rear
of the train was small in the distance. Still she stood on the
platform, feeling a great emptiness about her. In spite of herself her
mouth was quivering: she did not want to cry: her heart was dead cold.</p>

<p>Her Uncle Tom had gone to an automatic machine, and was getting
matches.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like some sweets?&quot; he said, turning round.</p>

<p>Her face was covered with tears, she made curious, downward grimaces
with her mouth, to get control. Yet her heart was not crying-it was
cold and earthy.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind would you like-any?&quot; persisted her uncle.</p>

<p>&quot;I should love some peppermint drops,&quot; she said, in a strange, normal
voice, from her distorted face. But in a few moments she had gained
control of herself, and was still, detached.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us go into the town,&quot; he said, and he rushed her into a train,
moving to the town station. They went to a cafe to drink coffee, she
sat looking at people in the street, and a great wound was in her
breast, a cold imperturbability in her soul.</p>

<p>This cold imperturbability of spirit continued in her now. It was as if
some disillusion had frozen upon her, a hard disbelief. Part of her had
gone cold, apathetic. She was too young, too baffled to understand, or
even to know that she suffered much. And she was too deeply hurt to
submit.</p>

<p>She had her blind agonies, when she wanted him, she wanted him. But
from the moment of his departure, he had become a visionary thing of
her own. All her roused torment and passion and yearning she turned to
him.</p>

<p>She kept a diary, in which she wrote impulsive thoughts. Seeing the
moon in the sky, her own heart surcharged, she went and wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;If I were the moon, I know where I would fall down.&quot;</p>

<p>It meant so much to her, that sentence-she put into it all the anguish
of her youth and her young passion and yearning. She called to him from
her heart wherever she went, her limbs vibrated with anguish towards
him wherever she was, the radiating force of her soul seemed to travel
to him, endlessly, endlessly, and in her soul's own creation, find him.</p>

<p>But who was he, and where did he exist? In her own desire only.</p>

<p>She received a post-card from him, and she put it in her bosom. It did
not mean much to her, really. The second day, she lost it, and never
even remembered she had had it, till some days afterwards.</p>

<p>The long weeks went by. There came the constant bad news of the war.
And she felt as if all, outside there in the world, were a hurt, a hurt
against her. And something in her soul remained cold, apathetic,
unchanging.</p>

<p>Her life was always only partial at this time, never did she live
completely. There was the cold, unliving part of her. Yet she was madly
sensitive. She could not bear herself. When a dirty, red-eyed old woman
came begging of her in the street, she started away as from an unclean
thing. And then, when the old woman shouted acrid insults after her,
she winced, her limbs palpitated with insane torment, she could not
bear herself. Whenever she thought of the red-eyed old woman, a sort of
madness ran in inflammation over her flesh and her brain, she almost
wanted to kill herself.</p>

<p>And in this state, her sexual life flamed into a kind of disease within
her. She was so overwrought and sensitive, that the mere touch of
coarse wool seemed to tear her nerves.</p>
