<p>It will be remembered that when Brinton Kingsland dropped to
the ground in the gathering darkness to check the crossing of
the Big Cheyenne by the Sioux, whose leader had met him in mid-stream,
he called in an undertone to his parents to hasten out of the
range of the flying bullets; he repeated the command to his pony
Jack, who obediently trotted after them.</p>

<p>The father and mother, at this time, had no more thought of separating
themselves for any distance from their brave son than he had;
but two causes brought about the singular accident already referred
to.</p>

<p>The excited words of Brinton and the reports of the guns led
the couple to think the danger more imminent than it was.  As
a consequence, they rode farther than was necessary, but still
not to a point that ought to have caused any difficulty in their
coming together when prudent to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsland's pony travelled faster than that of his wife,
thus placing him a few yards in advance.  The gloom had not yet
become deep enough to prevent their seeing each other; but at
a moment when the wife was about to ask her husband to stop, she
was surprised to see him turn to the left, his pony struggling
up the bank to the level ground above.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that, Hugh?" she called in a guarded voice, but
at once following him.</p>

<p>He did not answer, but narrowly missed falling out of the saddle.
His animal continued moving away from the river-bank, and presently
struck into an easy gallop, which rapidly increased the distance
from the stream.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kingsland now suspected the meaning of the strange action,
and urged her pony beside that of her husband, which was going
so fast that she was obliged to travel farther than she supposed
before coming up with him.  Then, laying hold of the bridle, she
brought her husband's pony to a halt.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Hugh?" she asked; "are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Gracious! what have I been doing?" he exclaimed, in turn bewildered,
and looking about in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Why, you have been trying to run away from us," said Edith,
with a laugh, believing the whole thing to be a joke on her father's
part.</p>

<p>"You have come a good way from the riverbank," replied the disturbed
wife; "I tried to check you, but could not."</p>

<p>"I understand it now," said he, passing his hand across his forehead,
in the effort to collect his thoughts.  "Just after we started
a faintness seized me, and I knew nothing until this minute. 
I don't understand why I did not fell out of the saddle."</p>

<p>"I saw you reel, and you must have come near doing so.  How do
you feel now?"</p>

<p>"Much better.  Strange that I should have been attacked in that
manner; but I am sure it will not occur again.  What will Brinton
think?"</p>

<p>"I have heard the report of guns, but all is quiet now."</p>

<p>"I feel little alarm, for they will not dare to cross while he
is guarding the ford."</p>

<p>"Is he not in danger?"</p>

<p>"No; he is lying on the ground, and they cannot see him; he will
hold them at bay as long as he wishes."</p>

<p>"But they may come over at some other point and get behind him."</p>

<p>"I did not think of that," said the husband more thoughtfully;
"but I am sure he will not stay any longer than he ought.  It
won't do for us to go back, for, if the Indians do cross the river,
we shall be in their path.  It may be well to go part of the way
over our own track, so as to make it easier for him to find us. 
Come on, and make no noise."</p>

<p>"But you are not taking the right course," protested his wife:
"you should turn more to the left."</p>

<p>"I feel almost sure you are wrong; but you have had your senses
about you all the time, which is more than I have had, and I bow
to your decision."</p>

<p>"But, mother, you are not right," interposed Edith, now fully
awake; "you should go that way"; and she indicated a route widely
different from that of either&mdash;so different, indeed, that her
mother could not accept it.</p>

<p>"No, dear, you are wrong," she calmly replied.  "I will lead."</p>

<p>And yet there is reason to believe the child was nearer right
than either, and had her suggestion been adopted, much of what
followed might have been averted.</p>

<p>While they were riding, as they believed, in the direction of
the Big Cheyenne, Mr. Kingsland noticed that the pony of his son
was not with them.  His wife said that he did not come up the
river-bank, and was probably waiting for Brinton to go to him. 
It will thus be seen that the youth was wrong in his supposition
about the movements of Jack.</p>

<p>By-and-by the time came when Mrs. Kingsland saw she had committed
a sad blunder, and, instead of approaching the river, had gone
still farther from it; they could hear nothing of its flow, and
were lost on the prairie.  Husband and wife now debated what was
best to do.</p>

<p>It was found that when each, including Edith, named the supposed
direction to the stream, they were as widely apart as before.</p>

<p>"The wisest course is to stop trying to find the river," remarked
the husband, "for every effort only takes us farther away; we
might as well go into camp right here."</p>

<p>"And freeze to death."</p>

<p>"No; we will ride round until we find some shelter from this
cutting wind, and then make ourselves as comfortable as we can
until morning. Do you see that light away to the south?"</p>

<p>That which the ranchman observed was the glow already referred
to as attracting the notice of Brinton.  The latter saw it in
its true direction&mdash;that is, in the northern horizon, from which
the bewilderment of his parents will be evident.</p>

<p>In the hope of finding their way to the river the couple acted
upon what might be considered a compromise.  It is not necessary
to say that every yard thus traversed increased the space between
them and the youth who, at that moment, was groping blindly in
quest of them.</p>

<p>The wanderings of the stray ones, however, were fortunately not
long continued, when the ponies of their own accord descended
a depression in the prairie.  It was not deep or well protected,
and was not reached until after they had passed over several elevations,
but they accepted the shelter thankfully, and dismounted.</p>

<p>The three were cramped from their long constraint, and Edith
ran around and here and there for some minutes before she was
willing to be tucked away for the night.  Their abundant clothing
enabled them to get along much better than might be supposed;
the little one lay between father and mother, the ponies being
allowed to stay by themselves.  As in the case of Brinton, the
long wintry night passed without disturbance or incident.</p>

<p>With the coming of daylight Mr. Kingsland roused himself.  Seeing
his wife and child were still sleeping, he did not awake them,
and took the best survey he could of their surroundings.</p>

<p>The weather was still intensely cold and the sky overcast.  A
look at his watch showed it was near eight o'clock when he clambered
out of the depression and looked about him.</p>

<p>The first discovery to cause surprise was the shelter that they
had enjoyed during the night.  Instead of being a ravine, like
that where Brinton had slept, this was a rough irregular excavation,
some forty or fifty feet in diameter.  The sides sloped gently,
the whole appearance being that of an immense hole left by some
great explosion of gunpowder, to which a providential chance had
guided their horses.</p>

<p>The husband saw no sign of any living being besides those with
him, nor could he form any surmise as to the course to be taken
to effect a meeting with his son.</p>

<p>"What will Brinton think?  After doing so bravely the work I
ought to have done, we left him in the lurch.  We are as much
lost to each other as if in the depths of an African jungle with
miles intervening.  I can't help feeling that the top of that
ridge yonder would give me a view that would disclose something
important."</p>

<p>He debated with himself whether it was prudent to walk thither
and obtain the coveted survey.  It was little more than a hundred
yards distant, and it did not seem that any harm could come to
the loved ones whom he would leave but a few minutes.</p>

<p>"I must manage to get my bearings in some way before I can do
anything.  The sun seems to be off yonder behind the clouds, but
really it appears to me as if it were in the wrong place!"</p>

<p>He ended the doubt by striding to the elevation, rifle in hand.
Since his faintness of the night before, he felt better and stronger
than he had for weeks, and this fact doubtless had much to do
with the feeling of self-confidence which now nerved him.</p>

<p>Reaching the crest of the ridge or swell in the prairie, Kingsland
was disappointed.  The same kind of view confronted him on every
hand, and he experienced a repetition of that sensation which
often comes to one in his situation: if he could only pass to
the top of the next elevation, he would obtain the view he wanted.</p>

<p>But Hugh Kingsland was too wise to yield to the prompting.  One
precious member of his family was already gone he knew not where,
and he would incur no risk of its being further broken up.</p>

<p>He was roused from his meditations in the most startling manner
conceivable, the cause being a rifle-shot, undoubtedly aimed at
himself.  On the summit of the ridge at which he was gazing, and
almost at the very point, two Indian bucks suddenly walked up
from the other side in plain sight.  While they were still ascending,
and when only their heads and waists showed, one of them brought
his rifle to his shoulder and tried his skill on the white man
across the valley-like depression.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsland did not tarry long enough to reply, but hurried
back to the hollow where he had left his wife and child.  They
had awakened, but were not alarmed at his absence, the wife suspecting
the cause. She had brought out what was left of the lunch, and
she and Edith were calmly eating when he reappeared, his looks
and manner showing that he had made some terrifying discovery.</p>

<p>He quickly explained what had taken place, adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am in doubt whether to mount the ponies and start to flee,
or to stay where we are and try to fight them off."</p>

<p>"You saw only two, and they were on foot."</p>

<p>"But they are sure to have ponies near, and more than likely
more of the hostiles are within call."</p>

<p>"Let us stay here until something is learned," said the wife,
showing admirable coolness and courage.</p>

<p>Whether or not this was the wiser course remains to be seen,
but it was followed.  Mr. Kingsland crept to near the top of the
hollow, and lying extended at full length against the sloping
bank, peered over, with his rifle ready to fire at the first appearance
of danger.  His position was such that he could detect the approach
of anyone from that side, while his wife guarded the other in
a similar manner.</p>

<p>The ponies having been quieted, Edith was cautioned to remain
near them, and to avoid exposing herself to any stray shots that
might be fired.  As long as she kept at the bottom of the hollow
with the animals, she and they were safe.</p>

<p>A full hour passed without the least sign of the hostiles.  A
less experienced person might have accepted this evidence that
the danger had passed them by; but when a second hour had worn
away with the same quietness everywhere, the husband and wife
still maintained their watchfulness.</p>

<p>The forenoon was half gone before this vigilance was rewarded. 
Mrs. Kingsland called to her husband that there was something
suspicious in front of her; and pausing only long enough to make
sure that nothing of the kind was immediately before him, he slipped
down the hollow and up the opposite slope to her side.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" he asked in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Just over that first swell, and a little to the left."</p>

<p>"I see him; keep down out of sight!"</p>

<p>He placed the muzzle of his repeating Winchester over the side
of the hollow, took careful aim at the rough head that had risen
a few inches above the slight swell in the prairie, and let fly. 
The aim was a perfect one, as was shown by the instant disappearance
of the crown and the cry, which from behind the elevation sounded
as if much farther off.</p>

<p>Instantly three or four replies came from other points along
the swell, and the bullets chipped the dirt about the face of
Kingsland, who ducked his head out of range.  Knowing, however,
how much depended on his concealing his weakness from the hostiles,
he fired four shots quickly, without special aim, and with no
expectation of accomplishing anything except that named.</p>

<p>"If I can make them think there are half a dozen rifles here
on the watch, they will be careful about attacking.  But they
mustn't know how weak we are."</p>

<p>"I don't admit that we are so weak in this hollow and with that
repeating gun, and you feeling so strong and well."</p>

<p>At this juncture a cry was heard from Edith.  She had forgotten
the command of her father, and crept up the opposite slope.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is Wolf Ear!"</p>

<p>And before anyone could interpose she sprang up the bank and
ran toward the ridge where her father had first seen the two hostiles.
The horrified parents at the same moment saw three other Indians
dash toward the innocent child, who never dreamed of her awful
peril.</p>
