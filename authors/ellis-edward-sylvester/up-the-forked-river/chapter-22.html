<p>There was not a doubt in the mind of Miss Starland when she read
the few pencilled lines handed to her by the deserter. She was
too familiar with the handwriting to be mistaken. She passed the
paper to her companion.</p>

<p>"You must not hesitate," said the latter, the moment she caught
its meaning; "go at once."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"No; I am not asked to do so. I can be of no help, and <em>I</em>
have nothing to fear from my uncle, General Yozarro."</p>

<p>Little preparation was needed. Attired in the light, gauzy material
of the tropics, it only remained for her to adjust her hat and
to catch up the reticule containing a few indispensable articles.
Still she lingered, impressed by the importance of the step she
was about to take.</p>

<p>Martella stood like a statue, but the tension had become almost
intolerable.</p>

<p>"Shall I retire till the Señorita is ready?" he respectfully
asked.</p>

<p>"There is no necessity; I have simply to go with you."</p>

<p>"May I then be permitted to say that not a moment must be thrown
away? General Yozarro is expected, and if we linger it will be
too late."</p>

<p>Just then the alert ears of the man heard an unusual stir below.</p>

<p>"I fear he has come; we must not stay."</p>

<p>He lowered his voice to a whisper and could not repress signs
of agitation. In the trying instant he decided upon his course
of action. He would go down stairs, and in the excitement, try
to slip outside. Then he would make a dash for life, with the
chances still a hundred to one against success.</p>

<p>The friends embraced affectionately, and the Señorita gently
pushed the other through the door which she opened.</p>

<p>"God and the saints be with you! Linger not another second."</p>

<p>Martella stepped outside, replaced his hat and with his deliberate
walk, led the way down the stairs, which were dimly lighted by
the lamp below. Sternly repressing all signs of haste, he slipped
his right hand under his jacket and rested it on the handle of
his knife.</p>

<p>"They shall have a fight for it!" he muttered; "if the General
is within reach, my knife shall find his heart."</p>

<p>But the flurry that had startled him was not caused by the arrival
of General Yozarro. It was due to the natural curiosity over the
departure of one of the young women, which had become known, when
the saddled pony was brought to the front of the Castle where
Captain Navarro was waiting, with one of his soldiers holding
the bridle. Whatever the officer may have thought, it was evident
there was no change in his intentions.</p>

<p>Miss Starland walked lightly forward, fastening her reticule
to her girdle, so as to leave her hands free, bowed to the Captain,
who snapped off his hat, replaced it, and, slightly stooping,
took the tiny foot for a moment in his hand, and assisted her
to the saddle and reached the reins to her. She said "<em>Adios</em>!"
to him and the others gathered round, whereat there was a general
uncovering. Martella saluted and with his former dignified tread,
walked toward the edge of the plateau, in the direction of the
trail leading to the river from which he had come. The most wrenching
effort of his life was to restrain himself from breaking into
a lope and calling upon his charge to do the same with her horse.
He succeeded by a supreme effort.</p>

<p>It was a hundred yards to the point where the bit of level land
dipped, and half the distance was passed, when Captain Navarro
called:</p>

<p>"Stop, Martella! Wait!"</p>

<p>The man instantly halted, thrusting his hand under his jacket
and closing his iron fingers about the handle of his weapon. Matters
had gone too far for any drawing back. It was now to keep on or
fight to the death, for he had no doubt that the officer had changed
his mind and meant to hold both until the arrival of General Yozarro.</p>

<p>"I will pause to hear what he speaks," he said in a low voice
to the wondering young woman; "your horse knows the trail; keep
on; you have not far to go to meet your brother and his friend."</p>

<p>She had checked the pony, but twitched the rein and he walked
steadily toward the darkness, leaving the grim Atlamalcan to have
it out with Captain Navarro. The latter was approaching fast and
came up panting slightly from the exertion.</p>

<p>"Martella, you will not forget to remind General Yozarro that
I was quick to obey his command, as soon as you gave it to me?"</p>

<p>"Have no fear, Captain."</p>

<p>In the immeasurable relief and the dread of awaking distrust,
the deserter punished himself. Instead of immediately following
his charge, he remained facing the officer. It seemed wise to
indulge in some pointless converse.</p>

<p>The Captain looked inquiringly at him, not understanding the
cause of his hesitation.</p>

<p>"Is there anything more you would say to me, Captain? Though
I have lingered longer than I expected, I can afford a few more
minutes."</p>

<p>"No, no, except to repeat that you shall be remembered by me.
I am sorry that I detained you; it is best you should make haste."</p>

<p>"Then, if you are sure, I will follow the Señorita, but I can
wait a brief while longer, Captain."</p>

<p>It was the latter who now showed nervousness, though the strain
upon him was not a tenth of what the other suffered.</p>

<p>"Off with you! Do you not see that you may lose the Señorita?"</p>

<p>The pony with its rider was passing from view below the margin
of the plateau, and the man now made the haste that looked natural.
Although the trail was easily followed, his place was in advance.
While gliding past the stirrup, he said:</p>

<p>"We have been fortunate, Señorita, but much danger still threatens."</p>
