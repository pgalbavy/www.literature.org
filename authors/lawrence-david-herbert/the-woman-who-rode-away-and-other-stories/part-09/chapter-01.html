<p></p>

<p>There was a man who loved islands.  He was born on one, but it
didn't suit him, as there were too many other people on it, besides
himself.  He wanted an island all of his own: not necessarily to be
alone on it, but to make it a world of his own.</p>

<p>An island, if it is big enough, is no better than a continent.  It
has to be really quite small, before it FEELS LIKE an island; and
this story will show how tiny it has to be, before you can presume
to fill it with your own personality.</p>

<p>Now circumstances so worked out, that this lover of islands, by the
time he was thirty-five, actually acquired an island of his own.
He didn't own it as freehold property, but he had a ninety-nine
years' lease of it, which, as far as a man and an island are
concerned, is as good as everlasting.  Since, if you are like
Abraham, and want your offspring to be numberless as the sands of
the sea-shore, you don't choose an island to start breeding on.
Too soon there would be overpopulation, overcrowding, and slum
conditions.  Which is a horrid thought, for one who loves an island
for its insulation.  No, an island is a nest which holds one egg,
and one only.  This egg is the islander himself.</p>

<p>The island acquired by our potential islander was not in the remote
oceans.  It was quite near at home, no palm-trees nor boom of surf
on the reef, nor any of that kind of thing; but a good solid
dwelling-house, rather gloomy, above the landing-place, and beyond,
a small farmhouse with sheds, and a few outlying fields.  Down on
the little landing bay were three cottages in a row, like
coastguards' cottages, all neat and white-washed.</p>

<p>What could be more cozy and home-like?  It was four miles if you
walked all round your island, through the gorse and the blackthorn
bushes, above the steep rocks of the sea and down in the little
glades where the primroses grew.  If you walked straight over the
two humps of hills, the length of it, through the rocky fields
where the cows lay chewing, and through the rather sparse oats, on
into the gorse again, and so to the low cliffs' edge, it took you
only twenty minutes.  And when you came to the edge, you could see
another, bigger island lying beyond.  But the sea was between you
and it.  And as you returned over the turf where the short,
downland cowslips nodded you saw to the east still another island,
a tiny one this time, like the calf of the cow.  This tiny island
also belonged to the islander.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that even islands like to keep each other company.</p>

<p>Our islander loved his island very much.  In early spring, the
little ways and glades were a snow of blackthorn, a vivid white
among the celtic stillness of close green and grey rock, blackbirds
calling out in the whiteness their first long, triumphant calls.
After the blackthorn and the nestling primroses came the blue
apparition of hyacinths, like elfin lakes and slipping sheets of
blue, among the bushes and under the glade of trees.  And many
birds with nests you could peep into, on the island all your own.
Wonderful what a great world it was!</p>

<p>Followed summer, and the cowslips gone, the wild roses faintly
fragrant through the haze.  There was a field of hay, the foxgloves
stood looking down.  In a little cove, the sun was on the pale
granite where you bathed, and the shadow was in the rocks.  Before
the mist came stealing, and you went home through the ripening
oats, the glare of the sea fading from the high air as the foghorn
started to moo on the other island.  And then the sea-fog went, it
was autumn, and oat-sheaves lying prone; the great moon, another
island, rose golden out of the sea, and, rising higher, the world
of the sea was white.</p>

<p>So autumn ended with rain, and winter came, dark skies and dampness
and rain, but rarely frost.  The island, your island, cowered dark,
holding away from you.  You could feel, down in the wet, sombre
hollows, the resentful spirit coiled upon itself, like a wet dog
coiled in gloom, or a snake that is neither asleep nor awake.  Then
in the night, when the wind left off blowing in great gusts and
volleys, as at sea, you felt that your island was a universe,
infinite and old as the darkness; not an island at all, but an
infinite dark world where all the souls from all the other bygone
nights lived on, and the infinite distance was near.</p>

<p>Strangely, from your little island in space, you were gone forth
into the dark, great realms of time, where all the souls that never
die veer and swoop on their vast, strange errands.  The little
earthly island has dwindled, like a jumping-off place, into
nothingness, for you have jumped off, you know not how, into the
dark wide mystery of time, where the past is vastly alive, and the
future is not separated off.</p>

<p>This is the danger of becoming an islander.  When, in the city, you
wear your white spats and dodge the traffic with the fear of death
down your spine, then you are quite safe from the terrors of
infinite time.  The moment is your little islet in time, it is the
spatial universe that careers round you.</p>

<p>But once isolate yourself on a little island in the sea of space,
and the moment begins to heave and expand in great circles, the
solid earth is gone, and your slippery, naked dark soul finds
herself out in the timeless world, where the chariots of the so-
called dead dash down the old streets of centuries, and souls crowd
on the footways that we, in the moment, call bygone years.  The
souls of all the dead are alive again, and pulsating actively
around you.  You are out in the other infinity.</p>

<p>Something of this happened to our islander.  Mysterious &quot;feelings&quot;
came upon him, that he wasn't used to; strange awarenesses of old,
far-gone men, and other influences; men of Gaul, with big
moustaches, who had been on his island, and had vanished from the
face of it, but not out of the air of night.  They were there
still, hurtling their big, violent, unseen bodies through the
night.  And there were priests, with golden knives and mistletoe;
then other priests with a crucifix; then pirates with murder on the
sea.</p>

<p>Our islander was uneasy.  He didn't believe, in the daytime, in any
of this nonsense.  But at night it just was so.  He had reduced
himself to a single point in space, and, a point being that which
has neither length nor breadth, he had to step off it into
somewhere else.  Just as you must step into the sea, if the waters
wash your foothold away, so he had, at night, to step off into the
otherworld of undying time.</p>

<p>He was uncannily aware, as he lay in the dark, that the blackthorn
grove that seemed a bit uncanny even in the realm of space and day,
at night was crying with old men of an invisible race, around the
altar stone.  What was a ruin under the hornbeam trees by day, was
a moaning of bloodstained priests with crucifixes, on the ineffable
night.  What was a cave and hidden beach between coarse rocks,
became in the invisible dark the purple-lipped imprecation of
pirates.</p>

<p>To escape any more of this sort of awareness, our islander daily
concentrated upon his material island.  Why should it not be the
Happy Isle at last?  Why not the last small isle of the Hesperides,
the perfect place, all filled with his own gracious, blossom-like
spirit?  A minute world of pure perfection, made by man, himself.</p>

<p>He began, as we begin all our attempts to regain Paradise, by
spending money.  The old, semi-feudal dwelling-house he restored,
let in more light, put clear lovely carpets on the floor, clear,
flower-petal curtains at the sullen windows, and wines in the
cellars of rock.  He brought over a buxom housekeeper from the
world, and a soft-spoken, much-experienced butler.  These too were
to be islanders.</p>

<p>In the farm-house he put a bailiff, with two farm-hands.  There
were Jersey cows, tinkling a slow bell, among the gorse.  There was
a call to meals at midday, and the peaceful smoking of chimneys at
evening, when rest descended.</p>

<p>A jaunty sailing-boat with a motor accessory rode in the shelter in
the bay, just below the row of three white cottages.  There was
also a little yawl, and two row-boats drawn up on the sand.  A
fishing net was drying on its supports, a boat-load of new white
planks stood crisscross, a woman was going to the well with a
bucket.</p>

<p>In the end cottage lived the skipper of the yacht, and his wife and
son.  He was a man from the other, large island, at home on this
sea.  Every fine day he went out fishing, with his son, every fine
day there was fresh fish on the island.</p>

<p>In the middle cottage lived an old man and wife, a very faithful
couple.  The old man was a carpenter, and man of many jobs.  He was
always working, always the sound of his plane or his saw: lost in
his work, he was another kind of islander.</p>

<p>In the third cottage was the mason, a widower with a son and two
daughters.  With the help of his boy, this man dug ditches and
built fences, raised buttresses and erected a new outbuilding, and
hewed stone from the little quarry.  His daughters worked at the
big house.</p>

<p>It was a quiet, busy little world.  When the islander brought you
over as his guest, you met first the dark-bearded, thin, smiling
skipper, Arnold, then his boy Charles.  At the house, the smooth-
lipped butler who had lived all over the world valeted you, and
created that curious creamy-smooth, disarming sense of luxury
around you which only a perfect and rather untrustworthy servant
can create.  He disarmed you and had you at his mercy.  The buxom
housekeeper smiled and treated you with the subtly respectful
familiarity, that is only dealt out to the true gentry.  And the
rosy maid threw a glance at you, as if you were very wonderful,
coming from the great outer world.  Then you met the smiling but
watchful bailiff, who came from Cornwall, and the shy farm-hand
from Berkshire, with his clean wife and two little children, then
the rather sulky farm-hand from Suffolk.  The mason, a Kent man,
would talk to you by the yard, if you let him.  Only the old
carpenter was gruff and elsewhere absorbed.</p>

<p>Well then, it was a little world to itself, and everybody feeling
very safe, and being very nice to you, as if you were really
something special.  But it was the islander's world, not yours.  He
was the Master.  The special smile, the special attention was to
the Master.  They all knew how well off they were.  So the islander
was no longer Mr So-and-So.  To everyone on the island, even to
you yourself, he was &quot;the Master&quot;.</p>

<p>Well, it was ideal.  The Master was no tyrant.  Ah no!  He was a
delicate, sensitive, handsome Master, who wanted everything perfect
and everybody happy.  Himself, of course, to be the fount of this
happiness and perfection.</p>

<p>But in his way, he was a poet.  He treated his guests royally, his
servants liberally.  Yet he was shrewd, and very wise.  He never
came the boss over his people.  Yet he kept his eye on everything,
like a shrewd; blue-eyed young Hermes.  And it was amazing what a
lot of knowledge he had at hand.  Amazing what he knew about Jersey
cows, and cheese-making, ditching and fencing, flowers and
gardening, ships and the sailing of ships.  He was a fount of
knowledge about everything, and this knowledge he imparted to his
people in an odd, half-ironical, half-portentous fashion, as if he
really belonged to the quaint, half-real world of the gods.</p>

<p>They listened to him with their hats in their hands.  He loved
white clothes; or creamy white; and cloaks, and broad hats.  So, in
fine weather, the bailiff would see the elegant tall figure in
creamy-white serge coming like some bird over the fallow, to look
at the weeding of the turnips.  Then there would be a doffing of
hats, and a few minutes of whimsical, shrewd, wise talk, to which
the bailiff answered admiringly, and the farm-hands listened in
silent wonder, leaning on their hoes.  The bailiff was almost
tender, to the Master.</p>

<p>Or, on a windy morning, he would stand with his cloak blowing in
the sticky sea-wind, on the edge of the ditch that was being dug to
drain a little swamp, talking in the teeth of the wind to the man
below; who looked up at him with steady and inscrutable eyes.</p>

<p>Or at evening in the rain he would be seen hurrying across the
yard, the broad hat turned against the rain.  And the farm-wife
would hurriedly exclaim:  &quot;The Master!  Get up, John, and clear him
a place on the sofa.&quot;  And then the door opened, and it was a cry
of:  &quot;Why of all things, if it isn't the Master!  Why, have ye
turned out then of a night like this, to come across to the like of
we?&quot;  And the bailiff took his cloak, and the farm-wife his hat,
the two farm-hands drew their chairs to the back, he sat on the
sofa and took a child up near him.  He was wonderful with children,
talked to them simply wonderful, made you think of Our Saviour
Himself, said the woman.</p>

<p>Always he was greeted with smiles, and the same peculiar deference,
as if he were a higher, but also frailer being.  They handled him
almost tenderly, and almost with adulation.  But when he left, or
when they spoke of him, they had often a subtle, mocking smile on
their faces.  There was no need to be afraid of &quot;the Master&quot;.  Just
let him have his own way.  Only the old carpenter was sometimes
sincerely rude to him; so he didn't care for the old man.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether any of them really liked him, man to man, or
even woman to man.  But then it is doubtful if he really liked any
of them, as man to man, or man to woman.  He wanted them to be
happy, and the little world to be perfect.  But any one who wants
the world to be perfect must be careful not to have real likes and
dislikes.  A general good-will is all you can afford.</p>

<p>The sad fact is, alas, that general good-will is always felt as
something of an insult, by the mere object of it; and so it breeds
a quite special brand of malice.  Surely general good-will is a
form of egoism, that it should have such a result!</p>

<p>Our islander, however, had his own resources.  He spent long hours
in his library, for he was compiling a book of reference to all the
flowers mentioned in the Greek and Latin authors.  He was not a
great classical scholar: the usual public-school equipment.  But
there are such excellent translations nowadays.  And it was so
lovely, tracing flower after flower as it blossomed in the ancient
world.</p>

<p>So the first year on the island passed by.  A great deal had been
done.  Now the bills flooded in, and the Master, conscientious in
all things, began to study them.  The study left him pale and
breathless.  He was not a rich man.  He knew he had been making a
hole in his capital, to get the island into running order.  When he
came to look, however, there was hardly anything left but hole.
Thousands and thousands of pounds had the island swallowed into
nothingness.</p>

<p>But surely the bulk of the spending was over!  Surely the island
would now begin to be self-supporting, even if it made no profit!
Surely he was safe.  He paid a good many of the bills, and took a
little heart.  But he had had a shock, and the next year, the
coming year, there must be economy, frugality.  He told his people
so, in simple and touching language.  And they said:  &quot;Why surely!
Surely!&quot;</p>

<p>So, while the wind blew and the rain lashed outside, he would sit
in his library with the bailiff over a pipe and a pot of beer,
discussing farm projects.  He lifted his narrow handsome face, and
his blue eye became dreamy.  &quot;WHAT a wind!&quot;  It blew like cannon
shots.  He thought of his island, lashed with foam, and
inaccessible, and he exulted . . .  No, he must not lose it.  He
turned back to the farm projects with the zest of genius, and his
hands flicked white emphasis, while the bailiff intoned:  &quot;Yes,
Sir!  Yes, Sir!  You're right, Master!&quot;</p>

<p>But the man was hardly listening.  He was looking at the Master's
blue lawn shirt and curious pink tie with the fiery red stone, at
the enamel sleeve-links, and at the ring with the peculiar scarab.
The brown searching eyes of the man of the soil glanced repeatedly
over the fine, immaculate figure of the Master, with a sort of
slow, calculating wonder.  But if he happened to catch the Master's
bright, exalted glance, his own eye lit up with a careful
cordiality and deference, as he bowed his head slightly.</p>

<p>Thus between them they decided what crops should be sown, what
fertilizers should be used in different places, which breed of pigs
should be imported, and which line of turkeys.  That is to say, the
bailiff, by continually cautiously agreeing with the Master, kept
out of it, and let the young man have his own way.</p>

<p>The Master knew what he was talking about.  He was brilliant at
grasping the gist of a book, and knowing how to apply his
knowledge.  On the whole, his ideas were sound.  The bailiff even
knew it.  But in the man of the soil there was no answering
enthusiasm.  The brown eyes smiled their cordial deference, but the
thin lips never changed.  The Master pursed his own flexible mouth
in a boyish versatility, as he cleverly sketched in his ideas to
the other man, and the bailiff made eyes of admiration, but in his
heart he was not attending, he was only watching the Master as he
would have watched a queer, alien animal, quite without sympathy,
not implicated.</p>

<p>So, it was settled, and the Master rang for Elvery, the butler, to
bring a sandwich.  He, the Master, was pleased.  The butler saw it,
and came back with anchovy and ham sandwiches, and a newly opened
bottle of vermouth.  There was always a newly opened bottle of
something.</p>

<p>It was the same with the mason.  The Master and he discussed the
drainage of a bit of land, and more pipes were ordered, more
special bricks, more this, more that.</p>

<p>Fine weather came at last, there was a little lull in the hard work
on the island.  The Master went for a short cruise in his yacht.
It was not really a yacht, just a neat little bit of a yawl.  They
sailed along the coast of the mainland, and put in at the ports.
At every port some friend turned up, the butler made elegant little
meals in the cabin.  Then the Master was invited to villas and
hotels, his people disembarked him as if he were a prince.</p>

<p>And oh, how expensive it turned out!  He had to telegraph to the
bank for money.  And he went home again, to economize.</p>

<p>The marsh-marigolds were blazing in the little swamp where the
ditches were being dug for drainage.  He almost regretted, now, the
work in hand.  The yellow beauties would not blaze again.</p>

<p>Harvest came, and a bumper crop.  There must be a harvest-home
supper.  The long barn was now completely restored and added to.
The carpenter had made long tables.  Lanterns hung from the beams
of the high-pitched roof.  All the people of the island were
assembled.  The bailiff presided.  It was a gay scene.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the supper the Master, in a velvet jacket,
appeared with his guests.  Then the bailiff rose and proposed:
&quot;The Master!  Long life and health to the Master!&quot;  All the people
drank the health with great enthusiasm and cheering.  The Master
replied with a little speech:  They were on an island in a little
world of their own.  It depended on them all to make this world a
world of true happiness and content.  Each must do his part.  He
hoped he himself did what he could, for his heart was in his
island, and with the people of his island.</p>

<p>The butler responded:  As long as the island had such a Master, it
could not but be a little heaven for all the people on it. - This
was seconded with virile warmth by the bailiff and the mason, the
skipper was beside himself.  Then there was dancing, the old
carpenter was fiddler.</p>

<p>But under all this, things were not well.  The very next morning
came the farm-boy to say that a cow had fallen over the cliff.  The
Master went to look.  He peered over the not very high declivity,
and saw her lying dead, on a green ledge under a bit of late-
flowering broom.  A beautiful, expensive creature, already looking
swollen.  But what a fool, to fall so unnecessarily!</p>

<p>It was a question of getting several men to haul her up the bank:
and then of skinning and burying her.  No one would eat the meat.
How repulsive it all was!</p>

<p>This was symbolic of the island.  As sure as the spirits rose in
the human breast, with a movement of joy, an invisible hand struck
malevolently out of the silence.  There must not be any joy, nor
even any quiet peace.  A man broke a leg, another was crippled with
rheumatic fever.  The pigs had some strange disease.  A storm drove
the yacht on a rock.  The mason hated the butler, and refused to
let his daughter serve at the house.</p>

<p>Out of the very air came a stony, heavy malevolence.  The island
itself seemed malicious.  It would go on being hurtful and evil for
weeks at a time.  Then suddenly again one morning it would be fair,
lovely as a morning in Paradise, everything beautiful and flowing.
And everybody would begin to feel a great relief, and a hope for
happiness.</p>

<p>Then as soon as the Master was opened out in spirit like an open
flower, some ugly blow would fall.  Somebody would send him an
anonymous note, accusing some other person on the island.  Somebody
else would come hinting things against one of his servants.</p>

<p>&quot;Some folks thinks they've got an easy job out here, with all the
pickings they make!&quot; the mason's daughter screamed at the suave
butler, in the Master's hearing.  He pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;My man says this island is surely one of the lean kine of Egypt,
it would swallow a sight of money, and you'd never get anything
back out of it,&quot; confided the farm-hand's wife to one of the
Master's visitors.</p>

<p>The people were not contented.  They were not islanders.  &quot;We feel
we're not doing right by the children,&quot; said those who had
children.  &quot;We feel we're not doing right by ourselves,&quot; said those
who had no children.  And the various families fairly came to hate
one another.</p>

<p>Yet the island was so lovely.  When there was a scent of honey-
suckle, and the moon brightly flickering down on the sea, then even
the grumblers felt a strange nostalgia for it.  It set you
yearning, with a wild yearning; perhaps for the past, to be far
back in the mysterious past of the island, when the blood had a
different throb.  Strange floods of passion came over you, strange
violent lusts and imaginations of cruelty.  The blood and the
passion and the lust which the island had known.  Uncanny dreams,
half-dreams, half-evocated yearnings.</p>

<p>The Master himself began to be a little afraid of his island.  He
felt here strange violent feelings he had never felt before, and
lustful desires that he had been quite free from.  He knew quite
well now that his people didn't love him at all.  He knew that
their spirits were secretly against him, malicious, jeering,
envious, and lurking to down him.  He became just as wary and
secretive with regard to them.</p>

<p>But it was too much.  At the end of the second year, several
departures took place.  The housekeeper went.  The Master always
blamed self-important women most.  The mason said he wasn't going
to be monkeyed about any more, so he took his departure, with his
family.  The rheumatic farm-hand left.</p>

<p>And then the year's bills came in, the Master made up his accounts.
In spite of good crops, the assets were ridiculous, against the
spending.  The island had again lost, not hundreds but thousands of
pounds.  It was incredible.  But you simply couldn't believe it!
Where had it all gone?</p>

<p>The Master spent gloomy nights and days, going through accounts in
the library.  He was thorough.  It became evident, now the
housekeeper had gone, that she had swindled him.  Probably
everybody was swindling him.  But he hated to think it, so he put
the thought away.</p>

<p>He emerged, however, pale and hollow-eyed from his balancing of
unbalanceable accounts, looking as if something had kicked him in
the stomach.  It was pitiable.  But the money had gone, and there
was an end of it.  Another great hole in his capital.  How could
people be so heartless?</p>

<p>It couldn't go on, that was evident.  He would soon be bankrupt.
He had to give regretful notice to his butler.  He was afraid to
find out how much his butler had swindled him.  Because the man was
such a wonderful butler, after all.  And the farm-bailiff had to
go.  The Master had no regrets in that quarter.  The losses on the
farm had almost embittered him.</p>

<p>The third year was spent in rigid cutting down of expenses.  The
island was still mysterious and fascinating.  But it was also
treacherous and cruel, secretly, fathomlessly malevolent.  In spite
of all its fair show of white blossom and bluebells, and the lovely
dignity of foxgloves bending their rose-red bells, it was your
implacable enemy.</p>

<p>With reduced staff, reduced wages, reduced splendour, the third
year went by.  But it was fighting against hope.  The farm still
lost a good deal.  And once more, there was a hole in that remnant
of capital.  Another hole, in that which was already a mere remnant
round the old holes.  The island was mysterious in this also: it
seemed to pick the very money out of your pocket, as if it were an
octopus with invisible arms stealing from you in every direction.</p>

<p>Yet the Master still loved it.  But with a touch of rancour now.</p>

<p>He spent, however, the second half of the fourth year intensely
working on the mainland, to be rid of it.  And it was amazing how
difficult he found it to dispose of an island.  He had thought that
everybody was pining for such an island as his; but not at all.
Nobody would pay any price for it.  And he wanted now to get rid of
it, as a man who wants a divorce at any cost.</p>

<p>It was not till the middle of the fifth year that he transferred
it, at a considerable loss to himself, to an hotel company who were
willing to speculate in it.  They were to turn it into a handy
honeymoon-and-golf island!</p>

<p>Then, take that island which didn't know when it was well off!  Now
be a honeymoon-and-golf island!</p>
