<p><em>MR. BURTON </em>was putting back some goods upon the shelves,
when Tom walked quietly in. This was four days later.</p>

<p>"Tom!" he exclaimed in amazement. "What brings you here?"</p>

<p>"My legs," answered Tom smilingly.</p>

<p>"But I thought you were at the mines?"</p>

<p>"I got part way there, but I changed my mind and came back."</p>

<p>Mr. Burton looked a little perplexed.</p>

<p>"I wish I had known in time; but I have filled your place, and
though I would much rather employ you, I don’t think it would
be right to discharge your successor."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Tom promptly. "You have made a mistake, Mr. Burton.
I am not going to stay in San Francisco. I am going back to New
York."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were after some papers?" said his employer.</p>

<p>"I expect to take them back with me."</p>

<p>"You have indeed been fortunate. How did you succeed?"</p>

<p>"I would tell you, but I am not at liberty, as it would involve
another’s secret."</p>

<p>"At all events, Tom, you have shown yourself a man of judgment.
You have succeeded where many a man would have failed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have," said Tom; "and perhaps the fact of my being
a boy has been in my favor. I can see myself how it has helped
me."</p>

<p>"Where are you stopping, Tom?"</p>

<p>"At the California Hotel."</p>

<p>"That is expensive. You may stay with me, and welcome."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Burton," said Tom warmly. "I will accept your
kind invitation, partly because I really cannot afford to stay
at an expensive hotel, partly because I prefer the privacy of
a house to a hotel."</p>

<p>"All right. Settle your bill at the hotel, and come at once."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but you must allow me in return to occupy a part
of the day with my old duties in the shop."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have you, as it will give me some relief.
As your successor needs breaking in to his duties, I have been
considerably confined."</p>

<p>This arrangement was satisfactory to Tom, as he felt that the
obligation now would not be wholly on his side. He had an independent
spirit, and he did not like to receive favors of a pecuniary nature.</p>

<p>He was behind the counter in the afternoon, when a man came in,
who was by no means a specimen of manly beauty. He had a good
figure, indeed, but his hair was bright red, and he had whiskers
of the same color, while his complexion was mottled. In addition
his eyes were obscured by an enormous pair of spectacles.</p>

<p>"An odd-looking specimen," thought Tom.</p>

<p>The man walked up to the counter, and leaning over, said in a
low voice:</p>

<p>"Can I speak with you in private?"</p>

<p>Tom started. It occurred to him that the man might be crazy,
and he hesitated.</p>

<p>"What can you wish to speak to me about?" he said. "I don’t know
you."</p>

<p>"About a matter of importance."</p>

<p>Tom was more and more surprised.</p>

<p>"Frederick," he said to his successor. "I am going out a few
minutes with this gentleman. I shall soon be back."</p>

<p>He took his hat and went out, followed by the red-haired man.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, turning to the stranger, "you may say what you
wish."</p>

<p>"You don’t appear to know me," said the other.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before in my life."</p>

<p>"Don’t be too sure of that."</p>

<p>"I should remember you."</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>"On account of my beauty, I suppose," he remarked.</p>

<p>"If you choose to put it that way—yes," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not sensitive as to my looks. By the way, you haven’t
inquired my name."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Davenport," said the other significantly.</p>

<p>"Why," said Tom starting, as for the first time light flashed
upon him, "you are——"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the other impetuously. "What I was is not to be
breathed in this city. I am in peril till I leave it."</p>

<p>"I never should have known you," said Tom in a low voice. "Your
disguise is complete. Even now when I know the truth, I cannot
realize that it is to you I am speaking."</p>

<p>"So much the better, for sharp eyes may be upon us. There are
those who are interested in ferreting me out. But let that pass.
Come with me to some place where we shall be safe from prying
eyes and curious ears."</p>

<p>Ten minutes brought them to such a place. They threw themselves
down upon a grassy spot, and the captain proceeded.</p>

<p>"The next steamer starts on Saturday. We must take passage."</p>

<p>"There is only one difficulty in the way," said Tom. "I have
no money."</p>

<p>"There will be no difficulty about that. I will secure two passages,
one for myself and the other for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"We will meet on board, for it is best that we should not be
too much together. Where are you staying?"</p>

<p>"At the place where you found me."</p>

<p>"I am at an obscure boarding-house. I avoid the publicity of
a hotel."</p>

<p>"Tell me how you got away without incurring suspicion."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have incurred suspicion. I came ostensibly to
negotiate these bonds."</p>

<p>"You have them with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I was not likely to forget them. The band generally accepted
my reason for going, but I could see that Alonzo was not satisfied.
There was a look on his face that said so. But he said nothing
in words. I started, promising to be back as soon as possible.
I hope never while I live to look upon the face of any one of
them again."</p>

<p>"You have managed well, it seems to me," said Tom. "I don’t think
there can be any danger, even if the lieutenant does suspect you."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I most fear," said the other, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"That he may follow me—that even now he may be in the city."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe there is any chance of it," he said.</p>

<p>"So I hope," said the captain. "But we will not stay too long
together. It may excite suspicion."</p>

<p>"When shall you engage passage?"</p>

<p>"This very day. I don’t know why it is, but I feel a feverish
anxiety to get away. I am not inclined to be nervous, but I feel
as if danger were hovering over me like a cloud, and likely at
any time to burst and overwhelm me."</p>

<p>"I never have any presentiments of evil," said Tom. "I am always
hopeful."</p>

<p>"You are fortunate," said the other thoughtfully, "but you are
a boy, and it is natural at your age to be sanguine and hopeful.
I was so, too, when at your age of life. But I will shake off
this feeling and do what is necessary. Let me return."</p>

<p>They rose from their grassy seat and took their way back to Mr.
Burton’s shop.</p>

<p>On their way they encountered an old man with snowy beard, half
bowed over, clad in rags, and apparently in extreme poverty.</p>

<p>"A few pennies, good gentlemen," he whined. "Only a few pennies
in charity. I am miserably poor."</p>

<p>The captain drew out a silver coin and put it into the old man’s
hand. Tom did the same.</p>

<p>"He looks wretched enough," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Scarcely were the two a few rods away, than the old beggar lifted
his eyes and looked after them.</p>

<p>"So, Signor Captain," he muttered, "this is your game. I have
not followed you for nothing. You are intriguing with that boy
to leave us all in the lurch, are you? We shall see."</p>

<p>The old beggar was Alonzo.</p>
