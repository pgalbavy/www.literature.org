<p>The next morning the pony-carriage stopped before the door of the
Curate's lodgings. When Grace went downstairs to the parlor, Anice
Barholm turned from the window to greet him. The appearance of physical
exhaustion he had observed the night before in Joan Lowrie, he saw again
in her, but he had never before seen the face which Anice turned toward
him.
</p>
<p>“I was on the ground yesterday, and saw you go down into the mine,” she
said. “I had never thought of such courage before.”
</p><p>That was all, but in a second he comprehended that this morning they
stood nearer together than they had ever stood before.
</p><p>“How is the child you were with?” he asked.
</p><p>“He died an hour ago.”
</p><p>When they went upstairs, Joan was standing by the sick man.
</p><p>“He's worse than he wur last neet,” she said. “An' he'll be worse still.
I ha' nursed hurts like these afore. It'll be mony a day afore he'll be
better--if th' toime ivver comes.”
</p><p>The Rector and Mrs. Barholm, hearing of the accident, and leaving
Browton hurriedly to return home, were met by half a dozen different
versions on their way to Riggan, and each one was so enthusiastically
related that Mr. Barholm's rather dampened interest in his daughter's
protégé was fanned again into a brisk flame.
</p><p>“There must be something in the girl, after all,” he said, “if one could
only get at it. Something ought to be done for her, really.”
</p><p>Hearing of Grace's share in the transaction, he was simply amazed.
</p><p>“I think there must be some mistake,” he said to his wife. “Grace is not
the man--not the man <u>physically</u>” straightening his broad shoulders,
“to be equal to such a thing.”
</p><p>But the truth of the report forced itself upon him after hearing the
story repeated several times before they reached Riggan, and arriving at
home they heard the whole story from Anice.
</p><p>While Anice was talking, Mr. Barholm began to pace the floor of the room
restlessly.
</p><p>“I wish I had been there,” he said. “I would have gone down myself.”
</p><p>(It is true: he would have done so.)
</p><p>“You are a braver man than I took you for,” he said to his Curate,
when he saw him,--and he felt sure that he was saying exactly the right
thing. “I should scarcely have expected such dashing heroism from you,
Grace.”
</p><p>“I hardly regarded it in that light,” said the little gentleman,
coloring sensitively. “If I had, I should scarcely have expected it of
myself.”
</p><p>The fact that Joan Lowrie had engaged herself as nurse to the injured
engineer made some gossip among her acquaintances at first, but this
soon died out. Thwaite's wife had a practical enough explanation of the
case.
</p><p>“Th' lass wur tired o' pit-work; an' no wonder. She's made up her moind
to ha' done wi' it; an' she's a first-rate one to nurse,--strong i' the
arms, an' noan sleepy-headed. Happen she'll tak' up wi' it fur a trade.
As to it bein' <u>him</u> as she meant when she said theer wur a mon as she
meant to save, it wur no such thing. Joan Lowrie's noan th' kind o'
wench to be runnin' after gentlefolk,--yo' know that yoresens. It's noan
o' our business who the mon wur. Happen he's dead; an' whether he's dead
or alive, you'd better leave him a-be, an' her too.”
</p><p>In the sick man's room the time passed monotonously. There were days
and nights of heavy slumber or unconsciousness,--restless mutterings and
weary tossings to and fro. The face upon the pillow was sometimes white,
sometimes flushed with fever; but whatever change came to pass, Death
never seemed far away.
</p><p>Grace lost appetite, and grew thin with protracted anxiety and watching.
He would not give up his place even to Anice or Mrs. Barholm, who spent
much of their time in the house. He would barely consent to snatch a few
minutes' rest in the day-time; in truth, he could not have slept if he
would. Joan held to her post unflinchingly. She took even less respite
than Grace. Having almost forced her to leave the room one morning,
Anice went downstairs to find her lying upon the sofa,--her hands
clasped under her head, her eyes wide open.
</p><p>“I conna sleep yet a while,” she said. “Dunnot let it trouble yo'. I'm
used to it.”
</p><p>Sometimes during the long night Joan felt his hollow eyes following her
as she moved about the room, and fixed hungrily upon her when she stood
near him.
</p><p>“Who are you?” he would say. “I have seen you before, and I know your
face; but--but I have lost your name. Who are you?”
</p><p>One night, as she stood upon the hearth, alone in the room,--Grace
having gone downstairs for something,--she was startled by the sound of
Derrick's voice falling with a singular distinctness upon the silence.
</p><p>“Who is it that is standing there?” he said.
</p><p>“Do I know you? Yes--it is-----” but before he could finish, the
momentary gleam of recognition had passed away, and he had wandered off
again into low, disjointed murmurings.
</p><p>It was always of the mine, or one other anxiety, that he spoke. There
was something he must do or say,--some decision he must reach. Must he
give up? Could he give up? Perhaps he had better go away,--far away.
Yes; he had better go. No,--he could not,--he must wait and think again.
He was tired of thinking,--tired of reasoning and arguing with himself.
Let it go for a few minutes. Give him just an hour of rest. He was
full of pain; he was losing himself, somehow. And then, after a brief
silence, he would begin again and go the weary round once more.
</p><p>“He has had a great deal of mental anxiety of late,--too much
responsibility,” said the medical man; “and it is going rather against
him.”
