<p>February, the gayest winter month on the East Coast, found the
winter resorts already overcrowded. Relays and consignments of
fashion arrived and departed on every train; the permanent winter
colony, composed of those who owned or rented villas and those
who remained for the three months at either of the great hotels,
had started the season vigorously. Dances, dinners, lawn fêtes,
entertainments for local churches and charities left little time
for anything except the routine of the bathing-hour, the noon
gathering at "The Breakers," and tea during the concert.</p>

<p>Every day beach, pier, and swimming-pool were thronged; every
day the white motor-cars rushed southward to Miami, and the swift
power-boats sped northward to the Inlet; and the house-boat rendezvous
rang with the gay laughter of pretty women, and the restaurant
of the Beach Club flashed with their jewels.</p>

<p>Dozens of villas had begun their series of house-parties; attractive
girls held court everywhere&mdash;under coco-palm and hibiscus, along
the beach, on the snowy decks of yachts; agreeable girls fished
from the pier, pervaded bazaars for charity, sauntered, bare of
elbow and throat, across the sandy links; adorable girls appeared
everywhere, on veranda, in canoes, in wheel-chairs, in the surf
and out of it&mdash;everywhere youth and beauty decorated the sun-drenched
landscape. And Hamil thought that he had never before beheld so
many ornamental women together in any one place except in his
native city; certainly, nowhere had he ever encountered such a
heterogeneous mixture of all the shades, nuances, tints, hues,
and grades which enter into the warp and weft of the American
social fabric; and he noticed some colours that do not enter into
that fabric at all.</p>

<p>East, West, North, and South sent types of those worthy citizens
who upheld local social structures; the brilliant migrants were
there also&mdash;samples of the gay, wealthy, over-accented floating
population of great cities&mdash;the rich and homeless and restless&mdash;those
who lived and had their social being in the gorgeous and expensive
hotels; who had neither firesides nor taxes nor fixed social obligations
to worry them, nor any of the trying civic or routine duties devolving
upon permanent inhabitants&mdash;the jewelled throngers of the horse-shows
and motor-shows, and theatres, and night restaurants&mdash;the people,
in fact, who make ocean-liners, high prices, and the metropolis
possible, and the name of their country blinked at abroad. For
it is not your native New Yorker who supports the continual fête
from the Bronx to the sea and carries it over-seas for a Parisian
summer.</p>

<p>Then, too, the truly good were there&mdash;the sturdy, respectable,
and sometimes dowdy good; also the intellectuals&mdash;for ten expensive
days at a time&mdash;for it is a deplorable fact that the unworthy
frivolous monopolise all the money in the world! And there, too,
were excursionists from East and West and North and South, tired,
leaden-eyed, uncomfortable, eating luncheons on private lawns,
trooping to see some trained alligators in a muddy pool, resting
by roadsides and dunes in the apathy of repletion, the sucked
orange suspended to follow with narrowing eyes the progress of
some imported hat or gown.</p>

<p>And the bad were there; not the very, very bad perhaps; but the
doubtful; over-jewelled, over-tinted of lip and brow and cheek,
with shoes too shapely and waists too small and hair too bright
and wavy, and&mdash;but dusty alpaca and false front cannot do absolute
justice to a pearl collar and a gown of lace; and tired, toil-dimmed
eyes may make mistakes, especially as it is already a tradition
that America goes to Palm Beach to cut up shindies, or watch others
do it.</p>

<p>So they were all there, the irreproachable, the amusing, the
inevitable, the intellectual, the good, and the bad, the onduléd,
and the scant of hair.</p>

<p>And, belonging to one or more of these divisions, Portlaw, Wayward,
and Malcourt were there&mdash;had been there, now, for several weeks,
the latter as a guest at the Cardross villa. For the demon of
caprice had seized on Wayward, and half-way to Miami he had turned
back for no reason under the sun apparently&mdash;though Constance
Palliser had been very glad to see him after so many years.</p>

<p>The month had made a new man of Hamil. For one thing he had become
more or less acclimated; he no longer desired to sleep several
times a day, he could now assimilate guavas without disaster,
and walk about without acquiring headaches or deluging himself
in perspiration. For another he was enchanted with his work and
with Shiela Cardross, and with the entire Cardross family.</p>

<p>The month had been a busy one for him. When he was not in the
saddle with Neville Cardross the work in the new office and draughting-room
required his close attention. Already affairs were moving briskly;
he had leased a cottage for his office work; draughtsmen had arrived
and were fully occupied, half a dozen contractors appeared on
the spot, also a forester and assistants, and a surveyor and staff.
And the energetic Mr. Cardross, also, was enjoying every minute
of his life.</p>

<p>Hamil's plan for the great main park with its terraces, miles
of shell and marl drives, its lakes, bridges, arbours, pools,
shelters, canals, fully satisfied Cardross. Hamil's engineers
were still occupied with the drainage problem, but a happy solution
was now in sight. Woodcutters had already begun work on the great
central forest avenue stretching straight away for four miles
between green jungles topped by giant oaks, magnolias, and palmettos;
lesser drives and chair trails were being planned, blazed, and
traced out; sample coquina concrete blocks had been delivered,
and a rickety narrow-gauge railroad was now being installed with
spidery branches reaching out through the monotonous flat woods
and creeping around the boundaries where a nine-foot game-proof
fence of woven buffalo wire was being erected on cypress posts
by hundreds of negroes. Around this went a telephone and telegraph
wire connected with the house and the gamekeeper's lodges.</p>

<p>Beyond the vast park lay an unbroken wilderness. This had already
been surveyed and there remained nothing to do except to pierce
it with a wide main trail and erect a few patrol camps of palmetto
logs within convenient reach of the duck-haunted lagoons.</p>

<p>And now toward the end of the month, as contractor after contractor
arrived with gangs of negroes and were swallowed up in the distant
woodlands, the interest in the Cardross household became acute.
From the front entrance of the house guests and family could see
the great avenue which was being cleared through the forest&mdash;could
see the vista growing hour by hour as the huge trees swayed, bent,
and came crashing earthward. Far away the noise of the felling
sounded, softened by distance; snowy jets of steam puffed up above
the trees, the panting of a toy locomotive came on the breeze,
the mean, crescendo whine of a saw-mill.</p>

<p>"It's the only way to do things," said Cardross again and again;
"make up your mind quickly that you want to do them, then do them
quickly. I have no patience with a man who'll dawdle about a bit
of property for years and finally start to improve it with a pot
of geraniums after he's too old to enjoy anything except gruel.
When I plant a tree I don't plant a sapling; I get a machine and
four horses and a dozen men and I put in a full-grown tree so
that I can sit under it next day if I wish to and not spend thirty
years waiting for it to grow. Isn't that the way to do things,
Hamil?"</p>

<p>Hamil said yes. It was certainly the way to accomplish things&mdash;the
modern millionaire's way; but the majority of people had to do
a little waiting before they could enjoy their vine and fig-tree.</p>

<p>Cardross sat down beside his wife, who was reading in a hammock
chair, and gazed at the new vista through a pair of field-glasses.</p>

<p>"Gad, Hamil!" he said with considerable feeling, "I hate to see
a noble tree go down; it's like murder to me. But it's the only
thing to do, isn't it? The French understand the value of magnificent
distances. What a glorious vista that will make, four miles straight
away walled in by deathless green, and the blue lagoon sparkling
at the end of the perspective! I love it, I tell you. I love it!"</p>

<p>"It will be very fine," said Hamil. His voice sounded a trifle
tired. He had ridden many miles since sunrise. There was marl
on his riding-breeches.</p>

<p>Cardross continued to examine the work in progress through his
binoculars. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"You've been overdoing it, haven't you, Hamil? My wife says so."</p>

<p>"Overdoing it?" repeated the young man, not understanding. "Overdoing
what?"</p>

<p>"I mean you've a touch of malaria; you've been working a little
too hard."</p>

<p>"He has indeed," drawled Mrs. Cardross, laying aside her novel;
and, placidly ignoring Hamil's protests: "Neville, you drag him
about through those dreadful swamps before he is acclimated, and
you keep him up half the night talking plans and making sketches.
He is too young to work like that."</p>

<p>Hamil turned red; but it was impossible to resent or mistake
the kindly solicitude of this very large and leisurely lady whose
steadily increasing motherly interest in him had at times tried
his dignity in that very lively family.</p>

<p>That he was already a successful young man with a metropolitan
reputation made little or no impression upon her. He was young,
alone, and she liked him better and better every day until that
liking arrived at the point where his physical welfare began to
preoccupy her. So she sent maids to his room with nourishing broths
at odd and unexpected moments, and she presented him with so many
boxes of quinine that their disposal became a problem until Shiela
took them off his hands and replaced them in her mother's medicine
chest, whence, in due time, they returned again as gifts to Hamil.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Cardross," he said, taking a vacant chair beside her
hammock, "I really am perfectly well and perfectly acclimated,
and I enjoy every moment of the day whether here as your guest
or in the saddle with your husband or in the office over the plans&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are always at work!" she drawled; "we never see you."</p>

<p>"But that's why I am here," he insisted, smiling.</p>

<p>"Neville," she interrupted calmly; "no boy of his age ought to
kill himself. Listen to me; when Neville and I were married we
had very little, and he began by laying his plans to work every
moment. But we had an understanding," she added blandly; "I explained
that I did not intend to grow old with a wreck of a man. Now you
may see the result of our understanding," nodding toward her amazingly
youthful husband.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, isn't it?" observed Cardross, still looking through
his field-glasses. "There's a baby-show next week and I'll enter
if you like, my dear."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cardross smiled and took Hamil's hand flat between her fair,
pudgy palms.</p>

<p>"We want you here," she said kindly, "<em>not</em> because it
is a matter of convenience, but because we like you. Be a little
more amiable, Mr. Hamil; you never give us a moment during the
day or after dinner. You haven't been to a dance yet; you never
go to the beach, you never motor or sail or golf. Don't you like
my children?"</p>

<p>"Like them! I adore them," he said, laughing, "but how can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to take him camping," observed Cardross, interrupting.
"I want some duck-shooting; don't you, Hamil?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we start this week for the woods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't let you," interposed his wife; "you'll talk that boy
to death with your plans and surveys!"</p>

<p>"No, I'll promise to talk shooting every moment, and do a little
of it, too. What do you say, Hamil? Gray will go with us. Are
you game?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to, but I promised Malcourt that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Louis can wait for you to go North and lay out
Mr. Portlaw's park. I've the first call on you; I've got you for
the winter here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Portlaw says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother Mr. Portlaw! We'll take him along, too, if he can
tear himself away from the Beach Club long enough to try less
dangerous game."</p>

<p>Since Malcourt's arrival he and Portlaw had joyously waded into
whatever gaiety offered, neck-deep; Portlaw had attached himself
to the Club with all the deliberation of a born gourmet and a
hopeless gambler; Malcourt roamed society and its suburbs, drifting
from set to set and from coterie to coterie, always an opportunist,
catholic in his tastes, tolerant of anything where pretty women
were inclined to be amiable. And they often were so inclined.</p>

<p>For his own curiosity he even asked to be presented to the redoubtable
Mrs. Van Dieman, and he returned at intervals to that austere
conservatory of current gossip and colonial tradition partly because
it was policy, socially, partly because, curiously enough, the
somewhat transparent charms of Virginia Suydam, whom he usually
met there, interested him&mdash;enough to make him remember a provocative
glance from her slow eyes&mdash;very slow, deeply lidded eyes, washed
with the tint of the sea when it is less blue than green. And
the curious side of it was that Malcourt and Virginia had met
before, and he had completely forgotten. It was difficult to tell
whether she had.</p>

<p>He usually remembered women who looked at him like that, tucking
them away in his mental list to be investigated later. He had
quite a little list in his mental archives of women, wedded and
otherwise, who interested him agreeably or otherwise. Neither
Mrs. Carrick nor Cecile was on that list. Shiela Cardross was&mdash;and
had been for two years.</p>

<p>Hamil, sitting on the terrace beside Mrs. Cardross, became very
busy with his note-book as soon as that languid lady resumed her
book.</p>

<p>"If you're going to import wild boar from Germany," he said to
Cardross, "you'll have to fence in some ten miles square&mdash;a hundred
square miles!&mdash;or they'll take to the Everglades."</p>

<p>"I'm going to," returned that gentleman calmly. "I wish you'd
ask McKenna to figure it out. I'll supply the cypress of course."</p>

<p>Hamil leaned forward, a little thrilled with the colossal scheme.
He never could become quite accustomed to the vast scale on which
Cardross undertook things.</p>

<p>"That will make a corking preserve," he said. "What do you suppose
is in there now?"</p>

<p>"Some bears and deer, a few lynx, perhaps one or two panthers.
The boar will hold their own&mdash;if they can stand the summer&mdash;and
I'm sure they can. The alligators, no doubt, will get some of
their young when they breed. I shall start with a hundred couple
when you're ready for them. What are you going to do this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Office work," replied Hamil, rising and looking at his marl-stained
puttees and spurs. Then he straightened up and smiled at Mrs.
Cardross, who was gently shaking her head, saying:</p>

<p>"The young people are at the bathing-beach; I wish you'd take
a chair and go down there&mdash;to please me, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"Come, Hamil," added Cardross airily, "take a few days off&mdash;on
yourself. You've one thing yet to learn: it's only the unsuccessful
who are too busy to play."</p>

<p>"But what I'm doing is play," remonstrated the young man good-humouredly.
"Well &mdash;I'll go to the beach, then." He looked at the steam-jets
above the forest, fumbled with his note-book, caught the eye of
Mrs. Cardross, put away the book, and took his leave laughingly.</p>

<p>"We go duck-shooting to-morrow," called out Cardross after him.</p>

<p>Hamil halted in the doorway to protest, but the elder man waved
him away; and he went to his room to change riding-clothes for
flannels and sponge the reek of horse and leather from his person.</p>

</div>
<p>The beach was all ablaze with the brilliant colours of sunshades,
hats, and bathing-skirts. Hamil lost no time in getting into his
swimming-suit; and, as he emerged, tall, cleanly built, his compact
figure deeply tanned where exposed, Portlaw, waddling briskly
toward the ocean, greeted him with the traditional: "Come on!
it's fine!" and informed him furthermore that "everybody" was
there.</p>
