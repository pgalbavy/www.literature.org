<p>I never saw my father again until I was in the prisoner's anteroom
at the Old Bailey. It was full of lounging men, whose fleshy limbs
bulged out against the tight, loud checks of their coats and trousers.
These were jailers waiting to bring in their prisoners. On the
other side of one black door the Grand Jury was deliberating on
my case, behind another the court was in waiting to try me. I
was in a sort of tired lull. All night I had been pacing up and
down, trying to bring my brain to think of points&mdash;points in my
defence. It was very difficult. I knew that I must keep cool,
be calm, be lucid, be convincing; and my brain had reeled at times,
even in the darkness of the cell. I knew it had reeled, because
I remembered that once I had fallen against the stone of one of
the walls, and once against the door. Here, in the light, with
only a door between myself and the last scene, I regained my hold.
I was going to fight every inch from start to finish. I was going
to let no chink of their armour go untried. I was going to make
a good fight. My teeth chattered like castanets, jarring in my
jaws until it was painful. But that was only with the cold.</p>

<p>A hubbub of expostulation was going on at the third door. My
turnkey called suddenly:</p>

<p>"Let the genman in, Charlie. Pal o' ourn," and my father ran
huntedly into the room. He began an endless tale of a hackney
coachman who had stood in front of the door of his coach to prevent
his number being taken; of a crowd of caddee-smashers, who had
hustled him and filched his purse. "Of course, I made a fight
for it," he said, "a damn good fight, considering. It's in the
blood. But the watch came, and, in short&mdash;on such an occasion
as this there is no time for words &mdash;I passed the night in
the watch-house. Many and many a night I passed there when I and
Lord&mdash;-&mdash;But I am losing time."</p>

<p>"You ain't fit to walk the streets of London alone, sir," the
turnkey said.</p>

<p>My father gave him a corner of his narrow-lidded eyes. "My man,"
he said, "I walked the streets with the highest in the land before
your mother bore you in Bridewell, or whatever jail it was."</p>

<p>"Oh, no offence," the turnkey muttered.</p>

<p>I said, "Did you find Cowper, sir? Will he give evidence?"</p>

<p>"Jackie," he said agitatedly, as if he were afraid of offending
me, "he said you had filched his wife's rings."</p>

<p>That, in fact, was what Major Cowper <em>had</em> said&mdash;that
I had dropped into their ship near Port Royal Heads, and had afterwards
gone away with the pirates who had filched his wife's rings. My
father, in his indignation, had not even deigned to ask him for
the address of Jamaica planters in London; and on his way back
to find a solicitor he had come into contact with those street
rowdies and the watch. He had only just come from before the magistrates.</p>

<p>A man with one eye poked his head suddenly from behind the Grand
Jury door. He jerked his head in my direction.</p>

<p>"True bill against that 'ere," he said, then drew his head in
again.</p>

<p>"Jackie, boy," my father said, putting a thin hand on my wrist,
and gazing imploringly into my eyes, "I'm... I'm ... I can't tell
you how...."</p>

<p>I said, "It doesn't matter, father." I felt a foretaste of how
my past would rise up to crush me. Cowper had let that wife of
his coerce him into swearing my life away. I remembered vividly
his blubbering protestations of friendship when I persuaded Tomas
Castro to return him his black deed-box with the brass handle,
on that deck littered with rubbish.... "Oh, God bless you, God
bless you. You have saved me from starvation...." There had been
tears in his old blue eyes. "If you need it I will go anywhere...
do anything to help you. On the honour of a gentleman and a soldier."
I had, of course, recommended his wife to give up her rings when
the pirates were threatening her in the cabin. The other door
opened, another man said:</p>

<p>"Now, then, in with that carrion. D'you want to keep the judges
waiting?"</p>

<p>I stepped through the door straight down into the dock; there
was a row of spikes in the front of it. I wasn't afraid; three
men in enormous wigs and ermine robes faced me; four in short
wigs had their heads together like parrots on a branch. A fat
man, bareheaded, with a gilt chain round his neck, slipped from
behind into a seat beside the highest placed judge. He was wiping
his mouth and munching with his jaws. On each side of the judges,
beyond the short-wigged assessors, were chairs full of ladies
and gentlemen. They all had their eyes upon me. I saw it all very
plainly. I was going to see everything, to keep my eyes open,
not to let any chance escape. I wondered why a young girl with
blue eyes and pink cheeks tittered and shrugged her shoulders.
I did not know what was amusing. What astonished me was the smallness,
the dirt, the want of dignity of the room itself. I thought they
must be trying a case of my importance there by mistake.</p>

<p>Presently I noticed a great gilt anchor above the judges' heads.
I wondered why it was there, until I remembered it was an Admiralty
Court. I thought suddenly, "Ah! if I had thought to tell my father
to go and see if the <em>Lion</em> had come in in the night!"</p>

<p>A man was bawling out a number of names.... "Peter Plimley, gent.,
any challenge.... Lazarus Cohen, merchant, any challenge...."</p>

<p>The turnkey beside me leant with his back against the spikes.
He was talking to the man who had called us in.</p>

<p>"Lazarus Cohen, West Indian merchant.... Lord, well, I'd challenge...."</p>

<p>The other man said, "<em>S&mdash;</em>sh."</p>

<p>"His old dad give me five shiners to put him up to a thing if
I could,"  the turnkey said again.</p>

<p>I didn't catch his meaning until an old man with a very ragged
gown was handing up a book to a row of others in a box so near
that I could almost have touched them. Then I realized that the
turnkey had been winking to me to challenge the jury. I called
out at the highest of the judges:</p>

<p>"I protest against that jury. It is packed. Half of them, at
least, are West Indian merchants."</p>

<p>There was a stir all over the court. I realized then that what
had seemed only a mass of stuffs of some sort were human beings
all looking at me. The judge I had called to opened a pair of
dim eyes upon me, clasped and unclasped his hands, very dry, ancient,
wrinkled. The judge on his right called angrily:</p>

<p>"Nonsense, it is too late.... They are being sworn. You should
have spoken when the names were read." Underneath his wig was
an immensely broad face with glaring yellow eyes.</p>

<p>I said, "It is scandalous. You want to murder me, How should
I know what you do in your courts? I say the jury is packed."</p>

<p>The very old judge closed his eyes, opened them again, then gasped
out:</p>

<p>"Silence. We are here to try you. This is a court of law."</p>

<p>The turnkey pulled my sleeve under cover of the planking. "Treat
him civil," he whispered, "Lord Justice Stowell of the Hadmir'lty.
'Tother's Baron Garrow of the Common Law; a beast; him as hanged
that kid. You can sass him; it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Lord Stowell waved his hand to the clerk with the ragged gown;
the book passed from hand to hand along the faces of the jury,
the clerk gabbling all the while. The old judge said suddenly,
in an astonishingly deep, majestic voice:</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, you must understand that we are here to
give you an impartial trial according to the laws of this land.
If you desire advice as to the procedure of this court you can
have it."</p>

<p>I said, "I still protest against that Jury. I am an innocent
man, and<hr>"</p>

<p>He answered querulously, "Yes, yes, afterwards." And then creaked,
"Now the indictment...."</p>

<p>Someone hidden from me by three barristers began to read in a
loud voice not very easy to follow. I caught:</p>

<p>"For that the said John Kemp, alias Nichols, alias Nikola el
Escoces, alias el Demonio, alias el Diabletto, on the twelfth
of May last, did feloniously and upon the high seas piratically
seize a certain ship called the <em>Victoria</em>... um... um,
the properties of Hyman Cohen and others... and did steal and
take therefrom six hundred and thirty barrels of coffee of the
value of... um... um... um... one hundred and one barrels of coffee
of the value of... ninety-four half kegs... and divers others..."</p>

<p>I gave an immense sigh.... That was it, then. I had heard of
the <em>Victoria</em>; it was when I was at Horton that the news
of her loss reached us. Old Macdonald had sworn; it was the day
a negro called Apollo had taken to the bush. I ought to be able
to prove that. Afterwards, one of the judges asked me if I pleaded
guilty or not guilty. I began a long wrangle about being John
Kemp but not Nikola el Escoces. I was going to fight every inch
of the way. They said:</p>

<p>"You will have your say afterwards. At present, guilty or not
guilty?"</p>

<p>I refused to plead at all; I was not the man. The third judge
woke up, and said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"That is a plea of not guilty, enter it as such." Then he went
to sleep again. The young girl on the bench beside him laughed
joyously, and Mr. Baron Garrow nodded round at her, then snapped
viciously at me:</p>

<p>"You don't make your case any better by this sort of foolery."
His eyes glared at me like an awakened owl's.</p>

<p>I said, "I'm fighting for my neck... and you'll have to fight,
too, to get it."</p>

<p>The old judge said angrily, "Silence, or you will have to be
removed."</p>

<p>I said, "I am fighting for my life."</p>

<p>There was a sort of buzz all round the court.</p>

<p>Lord Stowell said, "Yes, yes;" and then, "Now, Mr. King's Advocate,
I suppose Mr. Alfonso Jervis opens for you."</p>

<p>A dusty wig swam up from just below my left hand, almost to a
level with the dock.</p>

<p>The old judge shut his eyes, with an air of a man who <em>is</em>
going a long journey in a post-chaise. Mr. Baron Garrow dipped
his pen into an invisible ink-pot, and scratched it on his desk.
A long story began to drone from under the wig, an interminable
farrago of dull nonsense, in a hypochondriacal voice; a long tale
about piracy in general; piracy in the times of the Greeks, piracy
in the times of William the Conqueror... <em>pirata nequissima
Eustachio</em>, and thanking God that a case of the sort had not
been heard in that court for an immense lapse of years. Below
me was an array of wigs, on each side a compressed mass of humanity,
squeezed so tight that all the eyeballs seemed to be starting
out of the heads towards me. From the wig below, a translation
of the florid phrases of the Spanish papers was coming:</p>

<p>"His very Catholic Majesty, out of his great love for his ancient
friend and ally, his Britannic Majesty, did surrender the body
of the notorious El Demonio, called also..."</p>

<p>I began to wonder who had composed that precious document, whether
it was the <em>Juez de la Primera Instancia</em>, bending his
yellow face and sloe-black eyes above the paper, over there in
Havana&mdash;or whether it was O'Brien, who was dead since the writing.</p>

<p>All the while the barrister was droning on. I did not listen
because I had heard all that before&mdash;in the room of the Judge
of the First Instance at Havana. Suddenly appearing behind the
backs of the row of gentlefolk on the bench was the pale, thin
face of my father. I wondered which of his great friends had got
him his seat. He was nodding to me and smiling faintly. I nodded,
too, and smiled back. I was going to show them that I was not
cowed. The voice of the barrister said:</p>

<p>"M'luds and gentlemen of the jury, that finishes the Spanish
evidence, which was taken on commission on the island of Cuba.
We shall produce the officer of H. M. S. Elephant, to whom he
was surrendered by the Spanish authorities at Havana, thus proving
the prisoner to be the pirate Nikola, and no other. We come, now,
to the specific instance, m'luds and gentlemen, an instance as
vile..."</p>

<p>It was some little time before I had grasped how absolutely the
Spanish evidence damned me. It was as if, once I fell into the
hands of the English officer on Havana quays, the identity of
Nikola could by no manner of means be shaken from round my neck.
The barrister came to the facts.</p>

<p>A Kingston ship had been boarded... and there was the old story
over again. I seemed to see the Rio Medio schooner rushing towards
where I and old Cowper and old Lumsden looked back from the poop
to see her come alongside; the strings of brown pirates pour in
empty-handed, and out laden. Only in the case of the <em>Victoria</em>
there were added the ferocities of "the prisoner at the bar, m'luds
and gentlemen of the jury, a fiend in human shape, as we shall
prove with the aid of the most respectable witnesses...."</p>

<p>The man in the wig sat down, and, before I understood what was
happening, a fat, rosy man&mdash;the Attorney-General&mdash;whose cheerful
gills gave him a grotesque resemblance to a sucking pig, was calling
"Edward Sadler," and the name blared like sudden fire leaping
up all over the court. The Attorney-General wagged his gown into
a kind of bunch behind his hips, and a man, young, fair, with
a reddish beard and a shiny suit of clothes, sprang into a little
box facing the jury. He bowed nervously in several directions,
and laughed gently; then he looked at me and scowled. The Attorney-General
cleared his throat pleasantly...</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward Sadler, you were, on May 25th, chief mate of the
good ship <em>Victoria....</em>"</p>

<p>The fair man with the beard told his story, the old story of
the ship with its cargo of coffee and dye-wood; its good passage
past the Gran Caymanos; the becalming off the Cuban shore in latitude
so and so, and the boarding of a black schooner, calling itself
a Mexican privateer. I could see all that.</p>

<p>"The prisoner at the bar came alongside in a boat, with seventeen
Spaniards," he said, in a clear, expressionless voice, looking
me full in the face.</p>

<p>I called out to the old judge, "My Lord... I protest. This is
perjury. I was not the man. It Was Nichols, a Nova Scotian."</p>

<p>Mr. Baron Garrow roared, "Silence," his face suffused with blood.</p>

<p>Old Lord Stowell quavered, "You must respect the procedure...."</p>

<p>"Am I to hear my life sworn away without a word?" I asked.</p>

<p>He drew himself frostily into his robes. "God forbid," he said;
"but at the proper time you can cross-examine, if you think fit."</p>

<p>The Attorney-General smiled at the jury-box and addressed himself
to Sadler, with an air of patience very much tried:</p>

<p>"You swear the prisoner is the man?"</p>

<p>The fair man turned his sharp eyes upon me. I called, "For God's
sake, don't perjure yourself. You are a decent man."</p>

<p>"No, I won't swear," he said slowly. "I think he was. He had
his face blacked then, of course. When I had sight of him at the
Thames Court I thought he was; and seeing the Spanish evidence,
I don't see where's the room...."</p>

<p>"The Spanish evidence is part of the plot," I said.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General snickered. "Go on, Mr. Sadler," he said.
"Let's have the rest of the plot unfolded."</p>

<p>A juryman laughed suddenly, and resumed an abashed sudden silence.
Sadler went on to tell the old story.... I saw it all as he spoke;
only gaunt, shiny-faced, yellow Nichols was chewing and hitching
his trousers in place of my Tomas, with his sanguine oaths and
jerked gestures. And there was Nichol's wanton, aimless ferocity.</p>

<p>"He had two pistols, which he fired twice each, while we were
hoisting the studding-sails by his order, to keep up with the
schooner. He fired twice into the crew. One of the men hit died
afterwards...."</p>

<p>Later, another vessel, an American, had appeared in the offing,
and the pirates had gone in chase of her. He finished, and Lord
Stowell moved one of his ancient hands. It was as if a gray lizard
had moved on his desk, a little toward me.</p>

<p>"Now, prisoner," he said.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath. I thought for a minute that, after all,
there was a little fair play in the game&mdash;that I had a decent,
fair, blue-eyed man in front of me. He looked hard at me; I hard
at him; it was as if we were going to wrestle for a belt. The
young girl on the bench had her lips parted and leant forward,
her head a little on one side.</p>

<p>I said, "You won't swear I was the man... Nikola el Escoces?"</p>

<p>He looked meditatively into my eyes; it was a duel between us.</p>

<p>"I won't swear," he said. "You had your face blacked, and didn't
wear a beard."</p>

<p>A soft growth of hair had come out over my cheeks whilst I lay
in prison. I rubbed my hand against it, and thought that he had
drawn first blood.</p>

<p>"You must not say 'you,'" I said. "I swear I was not the man.
Did he talk like me?"</p>

<p>"Can't say that he did," Sadler answered, moving from one foot
to the other.</p>

<p>"Had he got eyes like me, or a nose, or a mouth?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," he answered again. "His face was blacked."</p>

<p>"Didn't he talk Blue Nose&mdash;in the Nova Scotian way?"</p>

<p>"Well, he did," Sadler assented slowly. "But any one could for
a disguise. It's as easy as..."</p>

<p>Beside me, the turnkey whispered suddenly, "Pull him up; stop
his mouth."</p>

<p>I said, "Wasn't he an older man? Didn't he look between forty
and fifty?"</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> look like?" the chief mate asked.</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-four," I answered; "I can prove it."</p>

<p>"Well, you look forty and older," he answered negligently. "So
did he."</p>

<p>His cool, disinterested manner overwhelmed me like the blow of
an immense wave; it proved so absolutely that I had parted with
all semblance of youth. It was something added to the immense
waste of waters between myself and Seraphina; an immense waste
of years. I did not ask much of the next witness; Sadler had made
me afraid. Septimus Hearn, the master of the <em>Victoria</em>,
was a man with eyes as blue and as cold as bits of round blue
pebble; a little goat's beard, iron-gray; apple-coloured cheeks,
and small gold earrings in his ears. He had an extraordinarily
mournful voice, and a retrospective melancholy of manner. He was
just such another master of a trader as Captain Lumsden had been,
and it was the same story over again, with little different touches,
the hard blue eyes gazing far over the top of my head; the gnarled
hands moving restlessly on the rim of his hat.</p>

<p>"Afterwards the prisoner ordered the steward to give us a drink
of brandy. A glass was offered me, but I refused to drink it,
and he said, 'Who is it that refuses to drink a glass of brandy?'
He asked me what countryman I was, and if I was an American."</p>

<p>There were two others from the unfortunate <em>Victoria</em>&mdash;a
Thomas Davis, boatswain, who had had one of Nikola's pistol-balls
in his hip; and a sort of steward &mdash;I have forgotten his
name&mdash;who had a scar of a cutlass wound on his forehead.</p>

<p>It was horrible enough; but what distressed me more was that
I could not see what sort of impression I was making. Once the
judge who was generally asleep woke up and began to scratch furiously
with his quill; once three of the assessors&mdash;the men in short
wigs&mdash;began an animated conversation; one man with a thin, dark
face laughed noiselessly, showing teeth like a white waterfall.
A man in the body of the court on my left had an enormous swelling,
blood-red, and looking as if a touch must burst it, under his
chin; at one time he winked his eyes furiously for a long time
on end. It seemed to me that something in the evidence must be
affecting all these people. The turnkey beside me said to his
mate, "Twig old Justice Best making notes in his stud-calendar,"
and suddenly the conviction forced itself upon me that the whole
thing, the long weary trial, the evidence, the parade of fairness,
was being gone through in a spirit of mockery, as a mere formality;
that the judges and the assessors, and the man with the goitre
took no interest whatever in my case. It was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>A tiny, fair man, with pale hair oiled and rather long for those
days, and with green and red signet rings on fingers that he was
forever running through that hair, came mincingly into the witness-box.
He held for a long time what seemed to be an amiable conversation
with Sir Robert Gifford, a tall, portentous-looking man, who had
black beetling brows, like tufts of black horsehair sticking in
the crannies of a cliff. The conversation went like this:</p>

<p>"You are the Hon. Thomas Oldham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"You know Kingston, Jamaica, very well?"</p>

<p>"I was there four years&mdash;two as the secretary to the cabinet
of his Grace the Duke of Manchester, two as civil secretary to
the admiral on the station."</p>

<p>"You saw the prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Yes, three times."</p>

<p>I drew an immense breath; I thought for a moment that they had
delivered themselves into my hands. The thing must prove of itself
that I had been in Jamaica, not in Rio Medio, through those two
years. My heart began to thump like a great solemn drum, like
Paul's bell when the king died&mdash;solemn, insistent, dominating
everything. The little man was giving an account of the "'bawminable"
state of confusion into which the island's trade was thrown by
the misdeeds of a pirate called Nikola el Demonio.</p>

<p>"I assure you, my luds," he squeaked, turning suddenly to the
judges, "the island was wrought up into a pitch of... ah... almost
disloyalty. The... ah... planters were clamouring for... ah...
separation. And, to be sure, I trust you'll hang the prisoner,
for if you don't..."</p>

<p>Lord Stowell shivered, and said suddenly with haste, "Mr. Oldham,
address yourself to Sir Robert."</p>

<p>I was almost happy; the cloven hoof had peeped so damningly out.
The little man bowed briskly to the old judge, asked for a chair,
sat himself down, and arranged his coat-tails.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," he prattled on, "the trouble and the worry
that this man caused to His Grace, myself, and Admiral Rowley
were inconceivable. You have no idea, you... ah... can't conceive.
And no wonder, for, as it turned out, the island was simply honeycombed
by his spies and agents. You have no idea; people who seemed most
respectable, people we ourselves had dealings with..."</p>

<p>He rattled on at immense length, the barrister taking huge pinches
of yellow snuff, and smiling genially with the air of a horse-trainer
watching a pony go faultlessly through difficult tricks. Every
now and then he flicked his whip.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oldham, you saw the prisoner three times. If it does not
overtax your memory pray tell us." And the little creature pranced
off in a new direction.</p>

<p>"Tax my memory! Gad, I like that. You remember a man who has
had your blood as near as could be, don't you?"</p>

<p>I had been looking at him eagerly, but my interest faded away
now. It was going to be the old confusing of my identity with
Nikola's. And yet I seemed to know the little beggar's falsetto;
it was a voice one does not forget.</p>

<p>"Remember!" he squeaked. "Gad, gentlemen of the jury, he came
as near as possible&mdash;-&mdash;You have no idea what a ferocious
devil it is."</p>

<p>I was wondering why on earth Nichols should have wanted to kill
such a little thing. Because it was obvious that it must have
been Nichols.</p>

<p>"As near as possible murdered myself and Admiral Rowley and a
Mr. Topnambo, a most enlightened and loyal... ah... inhabitant
of the island, on the steps of a public inn."</p>

<p>I had it then. It was the little man David Mac-donald had rolled
down the steps with, that night at the Ferry Inn on the Spanish
Town road.</p>

<p>"He was lying in wait for us with a gang of assassins. I was
stabbed on the upper lip. I lost so much blood... had to be invalided...
cannot think of horrible episode without shuddering."</p>

<p>He had seen me then, and when Ramon ("a Spaniard who was afterwards
proved to be a spy of El Demonio's&mdash;of the prisoner's. He was
hung since") had driven me from the place of execution after the
hanging of the seven pirates; and he had come into Ramon's store
at the moment when Carlos ("a piratical devil if ever there was
one," the little man protested) had drawn me into the back room,
where Don Balthasar and O'Brien and Seraphina sat waiting. The
men who were employed to watch Ramon's had never seen me leave
again, and afterwards a secret tunnel was discovered leading down
to the quay.</p>

<p>"This, apparently, was the way by which the prisoner used to
arrive and quit the island secretly," he finished his evidence
in chief, and the beetle-browed, portly barrister sat down. I
was not so stupid but what I could see a little, even then, how
the most innocent events of my past were going to rise up and
crush me; but I was certain I could twist him into admitting the
goodness of my tale which hadn't yet been told. He knew I had
been in Jamaica, and, put what construction he liked on it, he
would have to admit it. I called out:</p>

<p>"Thank God, my turn's come at last!"</p>

<p>The faces of the Attorney-General, the King's Advocate, Sir Robert
Gifford, Mr. Lawes, Mr. Jervis, of all the seven counsel that
were arrayed to crush me, lengthened into simultaneous grins,
varying at the jury-box. But I didn't care; I grinned, too. I
was going to show them.</p>

<p>It was as if I flew at the throat of that little man. It seemed
to me that I must be able to crush a creature whose malice was
as obvious and as nugatory as the green and red rings that he
exhibited in his hair every few minutes. He wanted to show the
jury that he had rings; that he was a mincing swell; that I hadn't
and that I was a bloody pirate. I said:</p>

<p>"You know that during the whole two years Nichols was at Rio
I was an improver at Horton Pen with the Macdonalds, the agents
of my brother-in-law, Sir Ralph Rooksby. You must know these things.
You were one of the Duke of Manchester's spies."</p>

<p>We used to call the Duke's privy council that. "I certainly know
nothing of the sort," he said, folding his hands along the edge
of the witness-box, as if he had just thought of exhibiting his
rings in that manner. He was abominably cool. I said:</p>

<p>"You must have heard of me. The Topnambos knew me."</p>

<p>"The Topnambos used to talk of a blackguard with a name like
Kemp who kept himself mighty out of the way in the Vale."</p>

<p>"You knew I was on the island," I pinned him down.</p>

<p>"You used to <em>come</em> to the island," he corrected. "I've
just explained how. But you were not there much, or we should
have been able to lay hands on you. We wanted to. There was a
warrant out after you tried to murder us. But you had been smuggled
away by Ramon."</p>

<p>I tried again:</p>

<p>"You have heard of my brother-in-law, Sir Ralph Rooksby?"</p>

<p>I wanted to show that, if I hadn't rings, I had relations.</p>

<p>"Nevah heard of the man in my life," he said.</p>

<p>"He was the largest land proprietor on the island," I said.</p>

<p>"Dessay," he said; "I knew forty of the largest. Mostly sharpers
in the boosing-kens." He yawned.</p>

<p>I said viciously:</p>

<p>"It was your place to know the island. You knew Horton Pen&mdash;the
Macdonalds?"</p>

<p>The face of jolly old Mrs. Mac. came to my mind&mdash;the impeccable,
Scotch, sober respectability.</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew the Macdonalds," he said&mdash;"<em>of</em> them. The
uncle was a damn rebellious, canting, planting Scotchman. Horton
Pen was the centre of the Separation Movement. We could have hung
<em>him</em> if we'd wanted to. The nephew was the writer of an
odious blackmailing print. He calumniated all the decent, loyal
inhabitants. He was an agent of you pirates, too. We arrested
him&mdash;got his papers; know all about your relations with him."</p>

<p>I said, "That's all nonsense. Let us hear"&mdash;the Attorney-General
had always said that&mdash;"what you know of myself."</p>

<p>"What I know of you," he sniffed, "if it's a pleasuah, was something
like this. You came to the island in a mysterious way, gave out
that you were an earl's son, and tried to get into the very excellent
society of... ah... people like my friends, the Topnambos. But
they would not have you, and after that you kept yourself mighty
close; no one ever saw you but once or twice, and then it was
riding about at night with that humpbacked scoundrel of a blackmailer.</p>

<p>"You, in fact, weren't on the island at all, except when you
came to spy for the pirates. You used to have long confabulations
with that scoundrel Ramon, who kept you posted about the shipping.
As for the blackmailer, with the humpback, David Macdonald, you
kept him, you... ah... subsidized his filthy print to foment mutiny
and murder among the black fellows, and preach separation. You
wanted to tie our hands, and prevent our... ah... prosecuting
the preventive measures against you. When you found that it was
no good you tried to murder the admiral and myself, and that very
excellent man Topnambo, coming from a ball. After that you were
seen encouraging seven of your... ah... pirate fellows whom we
were hanging, and you drove off in haste with your agent, Ramon,
before we could lay hands on you, and vanished from the island."</p>

<p>I didn't lose my grip; I went at him again, blindly, as if I
were boxing with my eyes full of blood, but my teeth set tight.
I said:</p>

<p>"You used to buy things yourself of old Ramon; bought them for
the admiral to load his frigates with; things he sold at Key West."</p>

<p>"That was one of the lies your scoundrel David Macdonald circulated
against us."</p>

<p>"You bought things... even whilst you were having his store watched."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul!" he said.</p>

<p>"You used to buy things...." I pinned him. He looked suddenly
at the King's Advocate, then dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nevah bought a thing in my life," he said.</p>

<p>I knew the man had; Ramon had told me of his buying for the admiral
more than three hundred barrels of damaged coffee for thirty pounds.
I was in a mad temper. I smashed my hand upon the spikes of the
rail in front of me, and although I saw hands move impulsively
towards me all over the court, I did not know that my arm was
impaled and the blood running down.</p>

<p>"Perjurer," I shouted, "Ramon himself told me."</p>

<p>"Ah, you were mighty thick with Ramon..." he said.</p>

<p>I let him stand down. I was done. Someone below said harshly,
"That closes our case, m'luds," and the court rustled all over.
Old Lord Stowell in front of me shivered a little, looked at the
window, and then said:</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, our procedure has it that if you wish to
say anything, you may now address the jury. Afterwards, if you
had a counsel, he could call and examine your witnesses, if you
have any."</p>

<p>It was growing very dark in the court. I began to tell my story;
it was so plain, so evident, it shimmered there before me... and
yet I knew it was so useless.</p>

<p>I remembered that in my cell I had reasoned out that I must be
very constrained; very lucid about the opening. "On such and such
a day I landed at Kingston, to become an improver on the estate
of my brother-in-law. He is Sir Ralph Rooksby of Horton Priory
in Kent." I <em>did</em> keep cool; I <em>was</em> lucid; I spoke
like that. I had my eyes fixed on the face of the young girl upon
the bench. I remember it so well. Her eyes were fixed, fascinated,
upon my hand. I tried to move it, and found that it was stuck
upon the spike on which I had jammed it. I moved it carelessly
away, and only felt a little pain, as if from a pin-prick; but
the blood was dripping on to the floor, pat, pat. Later on, a
man lit the candles on the judge's desk, and the court looked
different. There were deep shadows everywhere; and the illuminated
face of Lord Stowell looked grimmer, less kind, more ancient,
more impossible to bring a ray of sympathy to. Down below, the
barristers of the prosecution leaned back with their arms all
folded, and the air of men resting in an interval of cutting down
a large tree. The barristers who were, merely listeners looked
at me from time to time. I heard one say, "That man ought to have
his hand bound up." I was telling the story of my life, that was
all I could do.</p>

<p>"As for Ramon, how could I know he was in the pay of the pirates,
even if he were? I swear I did not know. Everyone on the island
had dealings with him, the admiral himself. That is not calumny.
On my honour, the admiral did have dealings. Some of you have
had dealings with forgers, but that does not make you forgers."</p>

<p>I warmed to it; I found words. I was telling the story for that
young girl. Suddenly I saw the white face of my father peep at
me between the head of an old man with an enormous nose, and a
stout lady in a brown cloak that had a number of little watchmen's
capes. He smiled suddenly, and nodded again and again, opened
his eyes, shut them; furtively waved a hand. It distracted me,
threw me off my balance, my coolness was gone. It was as if something
had snapped. After that I remembered very little; I think I may
have quoted "The Prisoner of Chillon," because he put it into
my head.</p>

<p>I seemed to be back again in Cuba. Down below me the barristers
were talking. The King's Advocate pulled out a puce-coloured bandanna,
and waved it abroad preparatorily to blowing his nose. A cloud
of the perfume of a West Indian bean went up from it, sweet and
warm. I had smelt it last at Rio, the sensation was so strong
that I could not tell where I was.</p>

<p>The candles made a yellow glow on the judge's desk; but it seemed
to be the blaze of light in the cell where Nichols and the Cuban
had fenced. I thought I was back in Cuba again. The people in
the court disappeared in the deepening shadows. At times I could
not speak. Then I would begin again.</p>

<p>If there were to be any possibility of saving my life, I had
to tell what I had been through&mdash;and to tell it vividly &mdash;I
had to narrate the story of my life; and my whole life came into
my mind. It was Seraphina who was the essence of my life; who
spoke with the voice of all Cuba, of all Spain, of all Romance.
I began to talk about old Don Balthasar Riego. I began to talk
about Manuel-del-Popolo, of his red shirt, his black eyes, his
mandolin; I saw again the light of his fires flicker on the other
side of the ravine in front of the cave.</p>

<p>And I rammed all that into my story, the story I was telling
to that young girl. I knew very well that I was carrying my audience
with me; I knew how to do it, I had it in the blood. The old pale,
faded, narrow-lidded father who was blinking and nodding at me
had been one of the best raconteurs that ever was. I knew how.
In the black shadows of the wall of the court I could feel the
eyes upon me; I could see the parted lips of the young girl as
she leaned further towards me. I knew it because, when one of
the barristers below raised his voice, someone hissed "<em>S&mdash;</em>sh"
from the shadows. And suddenly it came into my head, that even
if I did save my life by talking about these things, it would
be absolutely useless. I could never go back again; never be the
boy again; never hear the true voice of the Ever Faithful Island.
What did it matter even if I escaped; even if I could go back?
The sea would be there, the sky, the silent dim hills, the listless
surge; but <em>I</em> should never be there, I should be altered
for good and all. I should never see the breathless dawn in the
pondwater of Havana harbour, never be there with Seraphina close
beside me in the little <em>drogher</em>. All that remained was
to see this fight through, and then have done with fighting. I
remember the intense bitterness of that feeling and the oddity
of it all; of the one "I" that felt like that, of the other that
was raving in front of a lot of open-eyed idiots, three old judges,
and a young girl. And, in a queer way, the thoughts of the one
"I" floated through into the words of the other, that seemed to
be waving its hands in its final struggle, a little way in front
of me.</p>

<p>"Look at me... look at what they have made of me, one and the
other of them. I was an innocent boy. What am I now? They have
taken my life from me, let them finish it how they will, what
does it matter to me, what do I care?"</p>

<p>There was a rustle of motion all round the court. On board Rowley's
flagship the heavy irons had sawed open my wrists. I hadn't been
ironed in Newgate, but the things had healed up very little. I
happened to look down at my claws of hands with the grime of blood
that the dock spikes had caused.</p>

<p>"What sort of a premium is it that you set on sticking to the
right? Is this how you are going to encourage the others like
me? What do I care about your death? What's life to me? Let them
get their scaffold ready. I have suffered enough to be put out
of my misery. God, I have suffered enough with one and another.
Look at my hands, I say. Look at my wrists, and say if I care
any more." I held my ghastly paws high, and the candle light shone
upon them.</p>

<p>Out of the black shadows came shrieks of women and curses. I
saw my young girl put her hands over her face and slip slowly,
very slowly, from her chair, down out of sight. People were staggering
in different directions. I had had more to say, but I forgot in
my concern for the young girl. The turnkey pulled my sleeve and
said:</p>

<p>"I say, that ain't <em>true</em>, is it, it ain't <em>true?</em>"
Because he seemed not to want it to have been true, I glowed for
a moment with the immense pride of my achievement. I had made
them see things.</p>

<p>A minute after, I understood how futile it was. I was not a fool
even in my then half-mad condition. The real feeling of the place
came back upon me, the "Court of Law" of it. The King's Advocate
was whispering to the Attorney-General, he motioned with his hand,
first in my direction, then towards the jury; then they both laughed
and nodded. They knew the ropes too well for me, and there were
seven West India merchants up there who would remember their pockets
in a minute. But I didn't care. I had made them see things.</p>
