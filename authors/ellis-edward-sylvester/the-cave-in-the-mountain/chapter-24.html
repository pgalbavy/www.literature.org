<p>As young Munson expected to remain where he was for the rest
of the day, and perhaps through the succeeding night, and knew
that he was in great danger, he made it his business to acquaint
himself thoroughly with his position and with all the approaches
thereto. The first natural supposition was that the Apaches, in
following the fugitives to the spot, would, from the force of
circumstances, keep to the trail, that being their only guide.</p>

<p>This trail, for the last two hundred yards, led up a slope to
where he was stationed upon what might have been called a landing
in the ascent of the mountain. At the bottom of this two hundred
yards or so was an irregular plateau, beyond which the trail was
lost.</p>

<p>"If the Apaches should show themselves before dark," he concluded,
as he looked over the ground, "there is where they will be seen,
and that's the spot I must watch so long as I can see it."</p>

<p>Fred was able to hide himself from view for the time being, but
there was no way in which he could conceal the horse. He was sure
to be the first object that would attract the eye of the redskins
from below, revealing to them the precise position of the fugitives.
This reflection disturbed the lad a good deal, until he succeeded
in convincing himself that, after all, it was fortunate that it
was so.</p>

<p>The redskins, detecting the mustang among the rocks, would believe
that the three whites were there on the defensive. No matter if
their force were a half dozen times as great, they would make
the attack with a great deal of caution, and would probably manoeuvre
around until dark, in the expectation of a desperate fight&mdash;all
of which Fred hoped would give him a good chance of stealing out
and escaping them.</p>

<p>This, as a matter of course, was based upon the idea that Sut
Simpson, the veteran scout, had committed a serious error in believing
that the pursuit would be slow. And such a mistake he had indeed
made, as the lad discovered in due time.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore slowly away, and sunset was close at hand,
when Fred was lying upon his face, peering over the upper edge
of a rock at the plateau below. The fact of it was, his eyes had
been roaming over the same place so long, that the stare had become
a dreary, aimless one. He was suddenly aroused, however, to the
most intense attention by the discovery of an Apache warrior,
who drifted very serenely into the field of vision as if he were
part of a moving panorama upon which the lad was gazing.</p>

<p>The boy had been waiting so long for his appearance that he uttered
an exclamation, and half arose to his feet in his excitement.
But he quickly settled back again, and, with an interest which
it would be hard to describe, watched every movement of the redskin,
as the tiger watches the approach of its victim.</p>

<p>The indian stalked up the other side of the plateau, walking
slowly, looking right and left, in front and rear, and down at
the ground, his manner showing that he was engaged in trailing
the party, using all the care and skill of which he was the master.
Reaching the middle of the plateau, he stopped, looked about,
and made a gesture to some one behind him. A moment later, a second
indian appeared, and then a third, the trio meeting near the centre
of the irregular plot, where they immediately began a conversation.</p>

<p>Each of the three was liberal with his gestures, and now and
then Fred could catch the sound of their voices. What it was that
could so deeply interest them at such a time, he was at a loss
to conjecture, but there could be no doubt that it related to
the party they were pursuing.</p>

<p>"That must be all there are of them," he reflected, after several
minutes had passed, without any other Apaches becoming visible;
"but it seems to me it is a small force to chase us with. I've
always understood that the Indians wanted double the number of
their enemies, whenever they are going to attack them, but I suppose
they've got some plan that I can't understand."</p>

<p>They had been talking but a short time, when Fred understood
from their actions that they had detected the mustang above them
on the mountain side. They looked up several times, and pointed
and gesticulated in the same earnest fashion. It suddenly occurred
to the lad that he might play a good point on the redskins, with
the idea of delaying any offensive movement they might have under
discussion. Pointing his revolver over the rock in front of him,
he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The report was as sharp and loud almost as that of a rifle, but
the parties against whom it it was aimed were in no more danger
than if they had been in the city of Newark. The report had no
sooner reached the ears of the Apaches than they scattered as
wildly as if they had heard the whizz of a dozen bullets by their
faces. Fred chuckled over the success of his ruse and made sure
to keep himself hid from view.</p>

<p>"That will make them think that we're holding a sharp look-out
for them, and they'll be careful before they make an attack upon
us."</p>

<p>It seemed strange to him that the Apaches, who must know of the
presence of Sut Simpson, who was equal to half a dozen men in
such a situation, should have sent forward only three of their
warriors to trail him.</p>

<p>"It may be," he thought, after a while, "that these men know
how to follow a trail faster than the others, and they have gone
on ahead, while the others are coming after them. I should think
Lone Wolf would do anything in the world to catch Sut, who has
done him so much injury."</p>

<p>Night was drawing on apace, darkness being due in less than an
hour. Fred was naturally perplexed and alarmed, for he could not
help feeling that he was in a most perilous position, regarding
which he should have had more advice from the scout before his
departure. The only thing that seemed prudent for him to do was
to wait until dark and then quietly steel out and shift his position.
It looked very much as if he could take care of himself for the
night, at least, but he did not see how he could take care of
the mustang, which had already changed hands so often, and which
was so necessary to their safety.</p>

<p>"Sut said he expected to be home by dark, and I wish he'd come,"
was the thought that passed through his mind over and over again
as he looked into the gathering darkness and listened for the
sound of his friends.</p>

<p>But the stillness remained unbroken and the shadows deepened,
until he saw that the night was fully come, and he could move
about without danger of being fired upon from a distance. The
moon was late in rising, so that the gloom was deep enough to
hide one person from another, when the distance was extremely
slight. Although aware of this, Fred was afraid of some flank
movement upon the part of the Apaches, before he could get out
of their reach. The suspicion that there were two men besides
would make the redskins very cautious in their movements, but
a little manoeuvring on their part might reveal the truth, in
which case the situation of the lad would be critical in the extreme.</p>

<p>Fred had nerved himself to the task of stealing around the corner
of a large rock and off into the darkness, when he was startled
by a quick, sudden stamp of the horse. There might have been nothing
in this; but, recalling what the scout had said about the skill
of the animal as a sentinel, he had no doubt but that it meant
that he had scented danger and that the redskins were close at
hand. Scarcely pausing to reflect upon the advisability of the
step, the lad began crawling in the direction of the animal, not
more then twenty feet away.</p>

<p>Before he had passed half the distance he was certain that a
redskin was at some deviltry, for the horse stamped and snorted,
and showed such excitement, that Fred forgot his own danger, and,
springing to his feet, ran rapidly toward the animal. Just as
he reached him, he saw that an Indian had him by the bridle, and
was trying to draw him along, the mustang resisting, but still
yielding a step at a time. In a short time, if the thief was not
disturbed, he would have gotten him beyond the possibility of
rescue, he seeming more anxious to secure the steed than the scalp
of its owner. With never a thought of the consequences, Fred raised
his revolver and blazed away with both barrels, aiming as best
he could straight at the marauding Apache, who, with a howl of
rage and terror, dropped the bridle of the mustang and bounded
away among the rocks.</p>

<p>"There! I guess when you want to borrow a horse again, you'll
ask the owner."</p>

<p>The lad was reminded of his imprudence by the flash of a rifle
almost in his face, and the whizz of the bullet which grazed his
cheek. But he still had two loaded chambers in his revolver, and
he wheeled for the purpose of sending one of them at least, into
the warrior that had made an attempt upon his life. At this critical
juncture the mustang displayed an intelligence that was wonderful.</p>

<p>The Apache who was stealing upon him was near the steed, which,
without any preliminary warning, let out both his heels, knocking
the unsuspecting wretch fully a dozen feet and stretching him,
badly wounded, upon the ground.</p>

<p>"I wonder how many more there are?" exclaimed the lad, looking
about him, and expecting to see others rushing forward from the
gloom.</p>

<p>But the repulse for the time being was effectual and the way
was clear.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better get out of here," was the thought of Fred,
"for it ain't likely they will leave me alone very long when they've
found out that I'm the only one left."</p>

<p>With revolver in hand he moved hurriedly backward among the rocks,
and, after going a few rods, halted and looked for his pursuers,
whom he believed to be close behind him. There was something coming,
but a moment's listening satisfied him that it was his mustang,
which seemed to comprehend the exigency fully as well as he did
himself.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," he reflected. "They can follow him
better then they can me, and he can't sneak along like I can.
If they catch him, they'll be pretty sure to catch me."</p>

<p>He started to flee, not from the Indians only, but from the mustang
as well. But the speed of the latter was greater than his own,
and, after several attempts to dodge him, he gave it up.</p>

<p>"If you can travel so well," reflected Fred, "you might as well
carry me on your back."</p>

<p>Saying this he leaped upon the animal's back and gave him free
rein. The animal was going it on his own hook and he plunged and
labored along for some minutes longer, over the rockiest sort
of surface, until he halted of his own accord. The instant he
did so Fred leaped to the ground, paused and listened for his
pursuers. Nothing but the hurried breathing of the mustang could
be heard. The latter held his head well up, with ears thrown forward,
in the attitude of attention. But minute after minute passed and
the stillness remained unbroken. It looked indeed as if the fugitive
horse and boy had found rest for the time, and, so long as the
darkness continued, there was no necessity for further flight.</p>
