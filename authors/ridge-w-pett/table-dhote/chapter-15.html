<p>THE case of my brother Edward is typical of many, and I set the facts
down here, partly as reminder to myself, mainly for the information of
the public.  I said once, when in the company of some other bright
spirits, that the pupils of yesterday are the teachers of to-morrow, by
which remark I meant to convey that we learn in our youth, and in our
middle age become, in turn, the instructors.  Poor Edward had the same
advantages that came to me in school days, the very same advantages.  Our
mother consulted us in turn; I, the elder, decided, without hesitation,
to go into the City; Edward, a year later, suggested that he should go
into an engineering place at Wandsworth, on the other side of the river.
</p>
<p>“No, no,” I said when I reached home that night.  “This won’t do at all.
Choose a refined occupation.  We don’t want all Fulham to think that the
sweeps are continually coming in and going out of the house.  We may have
our faults, but no one can say that we haven’t always worn a clean
collar.”
</p><p>“I’ll keep mine for Sundays,” remarked Edward.
</p><p>“Mother,” I went on, “please let it be understood that this is a matter
which concerns me to some extent.  Supposing I wished to bring home a
friend from Bucklersbury, and supposing that just as I opened the front
gate Edward came along.  How should I be able to explain—”
</p><p>“Say,” suggested Edward, “that I was going in for Christy Minstrel
business in my spare time.  Say I was just off to St. James’s Hall.”
</p><p>“I place my veto on the scheme.”
</p><p>“You can place whatever you like,” he retorted, “and it won’t make any
difference.”
</p><p>“Very well,” I said, “very well.  In that case I consider myself relieved
of all responsibility.  I’ve done with it.  Only, mind this, don’t come
to me in after years—”
</p><p>“I promise that.”
</p><p>“And complain that I omitted to give you advice.  Mother, you’re a
witness.”
</p><p>I put my silk hat on and went out of the house.  I have always been
willing to give people the benefit of my counsel, but the moment I find
they cease to be receptive I—to use a vulgarism—dry up.
</p><p>I discovered a certain amount of satisfaction in observing that events
shaped somewhat in accordance with my prophecy.  So soon as my voice
settled down I was asked to join a Choral Union in Walham Green; and on
the second evening, as I escorted two ladies in the direction of their
home, I met Edward—Edward on the way from work, and presenting the
appearance of a half-caste nigger.  He raised his cap, and I had to
explain to my companions that he was a lad to whom my people had been
able to show some kindness, taking him in hand when he was quite young.
Unfortunately, one of the ladies knew him, and knew his name, and I found
it advisable not to go to any more rehearsals of “The Wreck of the
<u>Hesperus</u>.”  Months afterwards, when I had left home and was living in
lodgings owing to a dispute with mother about coming home late at night,
he and some of his fellow-workmen arrived at the offices in Bucklersbury
to fit up the electric light, which had then just come in, and I had to
take an early opportunity of mentioning to him, privately, that if he
claimed relationship with me he would be doing the very worst turn that a
man could do to another.
</p><p>“See you hanged first!” said Edward, taking his coat off to begin work.
I turned cold at the sight of his shirt-sleeves of flannel.
</p><p>“That makes it necessary that I should appeal to your better instincts.
I implore you, Edward, to remember that the ties of relationship can
exist, but need not—”
</p><p>“I mean,” he explained, “that I’ll see you hanged first before I confess
to any one here that you are a brother of mine.  Providing, of
course”—here he threw back his head and laughed in a loud, common
way—“providing the Governor of Newgate allows me to be present at the
ceremony.”
</p><p>I felt greatly relieved at this, but now and again, while the work was
going on in the office, Edward gave me a start by talking in an audible
voice to the other workmen about his relatives, and I knew he did this
purposely.  What I feared was that his companions might speak to him by
his surname; it proved reassuring to find that they called him Teddy.  On
the night they finished the work, I happened to be staying overtime, and,
taking him aside, I tried to talk pleasantly to him, asking how he
progressed in the new business to which he had transferred himself, and
pointing out that a rolling stone gathered no moss, but he seemed quite
off-hand in his manner.  I offered him sixpence that he might go out and
get a drink.  He said that I had better keep it and buy something to put
in my face; he added that I appeared to be spending all my money on
clothes, and expressed doubts whether I had enough to eat.
</p><p>“Pardon me, Edward,” I said, “you are now trespassing on grounds that do
not belong to you.”
</p><p>“A family weakness,” he remarked.  “Good-night, old man!  Good luck to
you!”
</p><p>“Edward,” I said, “it is not luck which counts in this world, but rather
a steady, dogged determination to do one’s duty; a persistent effort to
keep one’s position in society; to mingle, so far as possible, with those
of a superior station in life.”
</p><p>“Do you know what I think of you?” he interrupted sharply.  “You’re
nothing more nor less than—  Perhaps I’d better not say what I was going
to say.  After all, we’re brothers.”
</p><p>“That, Edward,” I said, in my quiet way, turning to go, so that it might
finish the discussion—“that is a fact which I sometimes find it difficult
to realise.”
</p><p>“You needn’t try,” he retorted.
</p><p>On reflection, I perceived that, disturbing as this argument had been,
there was no reason to allow it to cause regret, for it meant a final
breaking up of friendship, and enabled me to find good plea for not
acknowledging his existence should we ever meet again.  Moreover,
increases had been stopped in the office, and it appeared likely that I
might remain at £110 a year for a time.  Unless I could find some one of
a fairly attractive appearance, with a little money of her own, it would
inconvenience me greatly to contribute anything towards the support of my
mother.  This difference of opinion with Edward provided me with a good
answer if ever the application should be made.  “After what Edward
remarked to me some time ago,” I should say, “I must decline to have
anything to do with domestic expenses.  He is living in the house: let
him provide the sums necessary for the upkeep of the establishment.”  As
it proved, no necessity existed for this statement, because they very
wisely refrained from making any appeal.
</p><p>I heard of Edward occasionally by the medium of Miss Charlesworth; she
also brought me news of my mother.  I was living then in Jubilee Place,
and Miss Charlesworth’s people kept a large dairy in King’s Road,
Chelsea.  I called in sometimes on my way home for a couple of fresh
eggs.  Eggs can be carried in the pocket without observation, and, if
folk are careful not to crowd, without damage, whilst other eatables have
to be conveyed in a parcel.  I had strong objections to be seen carrying
a package of any kind.
</p><p>Miss Charlesworth took music-lessons from my mother in the old days when
there was not much money about, and I always spoke pleasantly when I
called at the dairy, answering her when she asked whether there was
anything special in the evening papers; I talked to her across the
milk-pans, if I could spare the time, about Gilbert and Sullivan’s new
play at the “Savoy.”  Her mother beamed through the glass half of the
door at the back, and on one occasion asked me to step in and have a bite
of supper.  I declined the first invitation, and this caused Miss
Charlesworth’s mother to become exceedingly anxious that I should honour
them with my company.
</p><p>“Fix your own evening,” urged the old lady: “we’re plain people, but we
always keep a good table.”
</p><p>I found that, in the interests of economy, the plan, once started,
answered very well.  At first, when Miss Charlesworth’s mother found that
I walked into the shop-parlour nearly every night at supper-time, she
exhibited signs of impatience, putting an extra plate down with a bang,
and throwing a thick tumbler towards me with the word:
</p><p>“Catch!”
</p><p>But the attentions I paid to her plump daughter mollified her, and she
always cried when I sang “The Anchor’s Weighed.”  From Lily—one could but
smile at the ludicrous inappropriateness of the name—I heard that my
brother Edward had been foolhardy enough to start an electric light
business on his own account; and, in spite of the differences that had
taken place between us, I could not help feeling annoyed that he had
omitted to ask my advice before taking such a step.  It would be of no
advantage to me for people to find the name of my brother in the list of
bankruptcies.
</p><p>I can never understand how it was that I allowed myself to be imposed
upon by the Charlesworths.  In the City at that time I had the reputation
of being as keen as any one in the office, where my own interests were
concerned; there were complaints that I shirked some of my duties, and
that I often shifted responsibility from my own shoulders, but no one
ever accused me of being a fool.  These two women at the dairy-shop in
King’s Road, as nearly as possible, took me in.  It hurt me very much
afterwards to think of the time I had wasted.  If I took Lily
Charlesworth to one place of interest, I took her to a dozen; the
National Gallery on a free day, the Tower, the outside of the Lyceum
Theatre, the South Kensington Museum—any man, young at the time, and in
receipt of a stationary income can fill in the list.  Now and again she
wanted to talk about my brother Edward; I changed the subject adroitly,
for I could not trust my temper where he was concerned.  It was near the
Albert Memorial one evening (she had seen it before, but, as I said, it
could do her no harm to see it again) that I directed conversation to the
subject of profits made on milk and cream; the discussion began at a
quarter past seven, and the information I obtained was satisfactory
enough to induce me, at twenty minutes to eight, to make a definitely
worded offer.
</p><p>“Very kind of you to ask me,” she said nervously, “but I think my answer
must be ‘No.’”
</p><p>“Come, come,” I said pleasantly, “there’s no occasion for all this
coyness.  We’re friends.”
</p><p>“Yes,” she said rapidly, “friends.  That’s just it.  And there’s no
reason why we shouldn’t go on being friends.  But nothing more, please.”
</p><p>“That,” I remarked, “if you will allow me to say so, Lily, verges on
stupidity.  I dare say you feel that you are not worthy of me.”
</p><p>“It isn’t that.”
</p><p>“May, I ask what other reason can possibly exist?”
</p><p>“There are several.”
</p><p>“Give me one,” I insisted.
</p><p>“I think,” she said deliberately—“I rather think I am going to marry your
brother Edward.”
</p><p>I threw up my hands with a gesture of sympathy.
</p><p>“You poor, silly girl!” I said.  “What ever has induced you to think
that?”
</p><p>“Your brother Edward.”
</p><p>I turned away from her.
</p><p>“It was because he asked us to be kind to you,” she went on, “that me and
mother took the trouble to look after you of an evening.  It’s kept you
out of mischief.”
</p><p>“I suppose you’re aware that he’s marrying you for the sake of your
money.”
</p><p>“Don’t think he is,” she replied.  “I haven’t got any.”
</p><p>“But you will have?”
</p><p>“No!”
</p><p>I must say this for myself: that I kept wonderfully calm, considering the
trying nature of the circumstances.  It appeared that, although her
mother’s name showed over the dairy, she was only the manager, working at
a salary.  I pointed out that this should have been mentioned to me
before.  She answered that Edward was acquainted with the fact, and there
existed no reason why the information should be communicated to me.
</p><p>I saw the uselessness of arguing the point, and left her to make her way
home alone, congratulating myself on a narrow escape.
</p><p>That night I wrote a rather clever letter to my brother Edward, the
wording of which gave me trouble, but brought satisfaction; my only fear
was that he might not have the intelligence to read between the lines.  I
said that I felt sure Lily Charlesworth would grow up to be the woman her
mother was; he would no doubt be as happy as he deserved to be; I trusted
it would be many weeks ere he discovered the mistake he had made.  For
myself, I had long since decided to remain a bachelor; I hinted that the
courage of the family appeared to have centred itself in him.  Begged him
to convey my best regards to my mother, and to express my regret that, on
his marriage, I could not see my way to offering her a home.
</p><p>Edward sent no answer to this, and he forwarded no invitation to the
wedding.  I should not have accepted it; indeed, I had drafted out a
satirical reply, but I do think he might have sent me a card.  I
transferred my custom to a dairy in Brompton Road; and, at about that
period, I spoke to a young lady in Hyde Park, mentioning that it was a
fine evening, and that the days were drawing in.
</p><p>I may say at once this lady became my wife.  It is unnecessary also that
I should delay the information that her account of relatives, of her
position in society, and of herself, given to me during the days of
courtship, differed to a considerable extent from the details proffered
during our honeymoon at Littlehampton, and this made it easy for me to
explain that one or two exaggerations had somehow crept into the
particulars which I had furnished concerning myself.  For one day, after
this, we exchanged no word with each other; and I have since been
inclined to wish that she, at any rate, had continued this policy of
silence, for, later on, she made remarks which (as I believe I pointed
out at the time) proved her to be wanting in that fine and glorious
attribute of women—the ability to forgive and forget.
</p><p>“Suppose we must make the best of it,” she said, “but I can foresee that
the best won’t be very good.  And if ever I allow a day to go by without
reminding you of what a bounder you are, then you can assume that I am
going off my head.”
</p><p>She must have begun at once, for I remember that when I had struck some
items off the bill, and settled with the Littlehampton boarding-house,
the landlady told me that she had never found herself making such a
mistake in the whole course of her existence: when we first arrived in
the cab, she could have sworn we had not been married long; on
retrospection she perceived that we had been man and wife for at least
ten years.  I told her we should never by any chance patronise her
boarding-house again, and she said this assurance robbed the future of
half its terrors.  No doubt she thought she had had the last word, but
she little knew the kind of man she was dealing with; I got the better of
her later by recommending some of my economical friends to go there.
</p><p>I mention all this because the incident is typical of others which
happened at about this time.  At office I detected a disposition on the
part of the firm to promote younger men over my head, and, when I
insisted on knowing the reason, they fenced with me for some time.
</p><p>“Fact is,” said one of the partners at last, “you show no interest in
your work.”
</p><p>“Make it worth my while, sir.”
</p><p>“We’re paying you your full value.  You wouldn’t get more for your
services anywhere else.”
</p><p>“I doubt that, sir.”
</p><p>“Quite easy for you to test the truth of the statement,” snapped the
partner.
</p><p>“I suppose,” I retorted, “that means you can do without me!”
</p><p>“It means we are ready to try.”
</p><p>I told the wife when I reached home, and, after she had expressed some
opinions concerning my conduct, she said that my best plan would be to
write to my brother Edward, and ask him to use his influence in obtaining
for me a new berth.  I told her plainly that I would rather cease work
for ever than feel myself under any obligation to him.  When, after
replying to several advertisements, it became clear that some exceptional
step would have to be taken, I submitted an alternative for her
consideration.  To show what a difficult woman she was to deal with (and
to throw a light on much that happened afterwards), I wish to record that
she went into one of her fits of temper, calling me everything but my
proper name.  Using diplomacy, I went away for a day or two, and on my
return she told me she had decided to act upon my suggestion.
</p><p>“Very well,” I said; “but why not have agreed to it at first?  However,
it’s satisfactory to see that you have come to your senses.  Perhaps
another time that we have a difference of opinion—”
</p><p>“It won’t happen again.”
</p><p>“I can’t trust you,” I said severely.  “These promises of yours mean
nothing.”
</p><p>“I assure you it won’t happen again.”
</p><p>“We will leave it at that,” I said.  “What it all amounts to is this:
that you are willing to go back to your former occupation as lady’s-maid
in a family.”
</p><p>“That’s it!”
</p><p>“In which capacity you will be able to earn enough to keep the home
going.”
</p><p>“What home?”
</p><p>“This home.”
</p><p>“Oh, no!” said my wife.  “Oh, dear me, no!  I shall earn enough to keep
myself going, but I shan’t bother about you.  Understand that, once for
all.”
</p><p>“Do you mean to look me in the face—”
</p><p>“Sha’n’t allow you a penny,” she declared.  “And if you find out where
I’m engaged, and call round and begin kicking up a row—”
</p><p>“What then?”
</p><p>“I shall simply come back again,” she announced deliberately, “and make
you keep me.”
</p><p>It must have been in consequence of this blow, administered by one who
had sworn to love, honour, and obey me, that I began to lose heart.  I
went into a single room, on the other side of the water, and for a time
became interested in political life, devoting myself more particularly to
the Sugar Bounty Question.  To my astonishment, I found that my brother
Edward was paying some attention to a constituency in South London; as I
remarked, rather cleverly, he appeared to have succeeded in the world as
much as I deserved to do.  It became my duty at one of his meetings to
put a few searching questions to him.  Some of his supporters objected,
and cried out to me: “Who are you; who are you?”  I shouted back that the
candidate could give the information if he cared to do so.
</p><p>“Oh, yes,” said Edward; “he is my brother.”
</p><p>I spoke to him after the meeting, and he introduced me to a slim,
good-looking woman—his wife.  I remarked, in her presence, that he
appeared to have found out Miss Charlesworth, as I had done; he replied
that he had not only found her out, but that he had married her.  My
amazed look caused Mrs. Edward to declare she had rarely received such a
genuine compliment, and that it more than repaid her for the course of
persistent exercise on which she had engaged.  She added they had made
efforts to discover me—I knew how much to believe of that—and exhibited
surprise on hearing that I was married.
</p><p>“We particularly wanted to find you,” remarked my brother Edward, “about
six months ago.”
</p><p>“Let me see,” I said.  “Where was I six months ago?  Busy, I expect.
What did you want me for?”
</p><p>“Mother died.”
</p><p>“Wish I’d known,” I said.  “I would have sent a wreath.  Got a
cigarette?”
</p><p>He turned away rather sharply, and then turned to me again.  “She wanted
to see you,” he remarked.  And they both gave their attention to some one
else.
</p><p>It occurred to me afterwards that they perhaps expected me to show more
signs of distress; if I had thought this at the time I could have obliged
them.  But that trifling detail makes no excuse whatever for Edward’s
subsequent conduct towards me, conduct which has compelled me to write
this account of his behaviour.  I put it briefly, and I wish to add that
I put it truthfully; there may have been times in my career when it has
been necessary to step with care beyond the confines of exactitude, but,
in regard to this matter, I am telling you nothing that can be
contradicted.
</p><p>I wrote to him, you must know, immediately after the meeting, and offered
to stop my opposition to his candidature, and to help him, heart, body,
and soul, if he would allow me—say, two pounds a week.  He replied
curtly.  I did not apply to him again for quite ten days, and then I
wrote saying that, although he could not see his way to accepting my
first proposition, perhaps he could let me have a loan.  I said I was
temporarily out of a situation, and that several excellent offers were
being made to me.
</p><p>To keep myself to the truth, I am bound to say that I obtained from him,
at various times, amounts which, totted up, would come to a respectable
figure.
</p><p>Mark what follows.
</p><p>This morning—this very morning—I receive a letter.  Headed “House of
Commons.”
</p><p>“I find,” he writes, “that for some years past you have done no work of a
creditable nature.  I am always willing to help those who are making some
effort to earn a living, but I do nothing for the indolent.  I can give
you no further assistance until you obtain work and show some clear
intention of sticking to it.”
</p><p>Apart from the wording of the letter—inexcusable in one who had equal
educational advantages with myself—I desire to point out the callousness
of its tone; the disregard of family ties.  I leave the matter for the
world to judge.  In the meanwhile, if you know of any one who can be
persuaded to assist by spontaneous gifts, I shall not only be saved the
necessity of looking for employment, but I shall be enabled to write a
sharp, stinging note to my brother Edward.
