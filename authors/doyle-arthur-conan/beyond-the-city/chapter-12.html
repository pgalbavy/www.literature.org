"Now, papa," said Clara that morning, wrinkling her
brows and putting her finger-tips together with the air
of an experienced person of business, "I want to have a
talk to you about money matters."
<P>
"Yes, my dear."  He laid down his paper, and looked
a question.
<P>
"Kindly tell me again, papa, how much money I have in
my very own right.  You have often told me before, but I
always forget figures."
<P>
"You have two hundred and fifty pounds a year of your
own, under your aunt's will.
<P>
"And Ida?"
<P>
"Ida has one hundred and fifty."
<P>
"Now, I think I can live very well on fifty pounds a
year, papa.  I am not very extravagant, and I could
make my own dresses if I had a sewing-machine."
<P>
"Very likely, dear."
<P>
"In that case I have two hundred a year which I could
do without."
<P>
"If it were necessary."
<P>
"But it is necessary.  Oh, do help me, like a good,
dear, kind papa, in this matter, for my whole heart is
set upon it.  Harold is in sore need of money, and
through no fault of his own."  With a woman's tact and
eloquence, she told the whole story.  "Put yourself in my
place, papa.  What is the money to me?  I never think of
it from year's end to year's end.  But now I know how
precious it is.  I could not have thought that money
could be so valuable.  See what I can do with it.  It may
help to save him.  I must have it by to-morrow.  Oh, do,
do advise me as to what I should do, and how I should get
the money."
<P>
The Doctor smiled at her eagerness.  "You are as
anxious to get rid of money as others are to gain it,"
said he.  "In another case I might think it rash, but I
believe in your Harold, and I can see that he has had
villainous treatment.  You will let me deal with the
matter."
<P>
"You, papa?"
<P>
"It can be done best between men.  Your capital,
Clara, is some five thousand pounds, but it is out
on a mortgage, and you could not call it in."
<P>
"Oh, dear! oh, dear!"
<P>
"But we can still manage.  I have as much at my bank. 
I will advance it to the Denvers as coming from you, and
you can repay it to me, or the interest of it, when your
money becomes due."
<P>
"Oh, that is beautiful!  How sweet and kind of you!"
<P>
"But there is one obstacle:  I do not think that you
would ever induce Harold to take this money."
<P>
Clara's face fell.  "Don't you think so, really?"
<P>
"I am sure that he would not."
<P>
"Then what are you to do?  What horrid things money
matters are to arrange!"
<P>
"I shall see his father.  We can manage it all
between us."
<P>
"Oh, do, do, papa!  And you will do it soon?"
<P>
"There is no time like the present.  I will go in at
once."  He scribbled a cheque, put it in an envelope, put
on his broad straw hat, and strolled in through the
garden to pay his morning call.
<P>
It was a singular sight which met his eyes as he
entered the sitting-room of the Admiral.  A great sea
chest stood open in the center, and allround upon
the carpet were little piles of jerseys, oil-skins,
books, sextant boxes, instruments, and sea-boots.  The
old seaman sat gravely amidst this lumber, turning it
over, and examining it intently; while his wife, with the
tears running silently down her ruddy cheeks, sat upon
the sofa, her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon her
hands, rocking herself slowly backwards and forwards.
<P>
"Hullo, Doctor," said the Admiral, holding out his
hand, "there's foul weather set in upon us, as you may
have heard, but I have ridden out many a worse squall,
and, please God, we shall all three of us weather this
one also, though two of us are a little more cranky than
we were."
<P>
"My dear friends, I came in to tell you how deeply we
sympathize with you all.  My girl has only just told me
about it."
<P>
"It has come so suddenly upon us, Doctor," sobbed
Mrs. Hay Denver.  "I thought that I had John to myself
for the rest of our lives--Heaven knows that we have not
seen very much of each other--but now he talks of going
to sea again.
<P>
"Aye, aye, Walker, that's the only way out of it. 
When I first heard of it I was thrown up in the wind with
all aback.  I give you my word that I lost my bearings
more completely than ever since I strapped a middy's dirk
to my belt.  You see, friend, I know something of
shipwreck or battle or whatever may come upon the waters,
but the shoals in the City of London on which my poor boy
has struck are clean beyond me.  Pearson had been my
pilot there, and now I know him to be a rogue.  But I've
taken my bearings now, and I see my course right before
me."
<P>
"What then, Admiral?"
<P>
"Oh, I have one or two little plans.  I'll have some
news for the boy.  Why, hang it, Walker man, I may be a
bit stiff in the joints, but you'll be my witness that I
can do my twelve miles under the three hours.  What then? 
My eyes are as good as ever except just for the
newspaper.  My head is clear.  I'm three-and-sixty, but
I'm as good a man as ever I was--too good a man to lie up
for another ten years.  I'd be the better for a smack of
the salt water again, and a whiff of the breeze.  Tut,
mother, it's not a four years' cruise this time.  I'll be
back every month or two.  It's no more than if I went for
a visit in the country."  He was talking boisterously,
and heaping his sea-boots and sextants back into his
chest.
<P>
"And you really think, my dear friend, of hoisting
your pennant again?"
<P>
"My pennant, Walker?  No, no.  Her Majesty, God bless
her, has too many young men to need an old hulk like me. 
I should be plain Mr. Hay Denver, of the merchant
service.  I daresay that I might find some owner who
would give me a chance as second or third officer.  It
will be strange to me to feel the rails of the bridge
under my fingers once more."
<P>
"Tut! tut! this will never do, this will never do,
Admiral!"  The Doctor sat down by Mrs. Hay Denver and
patted her hand in token of friendly sympathy.  "We must
wait until your son has had it out with all these people,
and then we shall know what damage is done, and how best
to set it right.  It will be time enough then to begin to
muster our resources to meet it."
<P>
"Our resources!"  The Admiral laughed.  "There's the
pension.  I'm afraid, Walker, that our resources won't
need much mustering."
<P>
"Oh, come, there are some which you may not have
thought of.  For example, Admiral, I had always intended
that my girl should have five thousand from me when she
married.  Of course your boy's trouble is her trouble,
and the money cannot be spent better than in helping to
set it right.  She has a little of her own which she
wished to contribute, but I thought it best to work it
this way.  Will you take the cheque, Mrs. Denver, and I
think it would be best if you said nothing to Harold
about it, and just used it as the occasion served?"
<P>
"God bless you, Walker, you are a true friend.  I
won't forget this, Walker.  "The Admiral sat down on his
sea chest and mopped his brow with his red handkerchief.
<P>
"What is it to me whether you have it now or then? 
It may be more useful now.  There's only one stipulation. 
If things should come to the worst, and if the business
should prove so bad that nothing can set it right, then
hold back this cheque, for there is no use in pouring
water into a broken basin, and if the lad should fall, he
will want something to pick himself up again with."
<P>
"He shall not fall, Walker, and you shall not have
occasion to be ashamed of the family into which your
daughter is about to marry.  I have my own plan.  But we
shall hold your money, my friend, and it will strengthen
us to feel that it is there."
<P>
"Well, that is all right," said Doctor Walker,
rising.  "And if a little more should be needed, we must
not let him go wrong for the want of a thousand or two. 
And now, Admiral, I'm off for my morning walk.  Won't you
come too?"
<P>
"No, I am going into town."
<P>
"Well, good-bye.  I hope to have better news, and
that all will come right.  Good-bye, Mrs. Denver.  I
feel as if the boy were my own, and I shall not be easy
until all is right with him."
