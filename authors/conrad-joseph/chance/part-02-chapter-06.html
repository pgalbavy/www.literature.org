<p>In the mess-room Powell found Mr. Franklin hacking at a piece
of cold salt beef with a table knife.  The mate, fiery in the
face and rolling his eyes over that task, explained that the carver
belonging to the messroom could not be found.  The steward, present
also, complained savagely of the cook.  The fellow got things
into his galley and then lost them. Mr. Franklin tried to pacify
him with mournful firmness.</p>

<p>"There, there!  That will do.  We who have been all these years
together in the ship have other things to think about than quarrelling
among ourselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell thought with exasperation: "Here he goes again," for
this utterance had nothing cryptic for him.  The steward having
withdrawn morosely, he was not surprised to hear the mate strike
the usual note. That morning the mizzen topsail tie had carried
away (probably a defective link) and something like forty feet
of chain and wire-rope, mixed up with a few heavy iron blocks,
had crashed down from aloft on the poop with a terrifying racket.</p>

<p>"Did you notice the captain then, Mr. Powell.  Did you notice?"</p>

<p>Powell confessed frankly that he was too scared himself when
all that lot of gear came down on deck to notice anything.</p>

<p>"The gin-block missed his head by an inch," went on the mate
impressively.  "I wasn't three feet from him.  And what did he
do?  Did he shout, or jump, or even look aloft to see if the yard
wasn't coming down too about our ears in a dozen pieces?  It's
a marvel it didn't.  No, he just stopped short&mdash;no wonder; he
must have felt the wind of that iron gin-block on his face&mdash;looked
down at it, there, lying close to his foot&mdash;and went on again. 
I believe he didn't even blink.  It isn't natural.  The man is
stupefied."</p>

<p>He sighed ridiculously and Mr. Powell had suppressed a grin,
when the mate added as if he couldn't contain himself:</p>

<p>"He will be taking to drink next.  Mark my words.  That's the
next thing."</p>

<p>Mr. Powell was disgusted.</p>

<p>"You are so fond of the captain and yet you don't seem to care
what you say about him.  I haven't been with him for seven years,
but I know he isn't the sort of man that takes to drink.  And
then&mdash;why the devil should he?"</p>

<p>"Why the devil, you ask.  Devil&mdash;eh?  Well, no man is safe from
the devil&mdash;and that's answer enough for you," wheezed Mr. Franklin
not unkindly.  "There was a time, a long time ago, when I nearly
took to drink myself.  What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell expressed a polite incredulity.  The thick, congested
mate seemed on the point of bursting with despondency.  "That
was bad example though.  I was young and fell into dangerous company,
made a fool of myself&mdash;yes, as true as you see me sitting here. 
Drank to forget. Thought it a great dodge."</p>

<p>Powell looked at the grotesque Franklin with awakened interest
and with that half-amused sympathy with which we receive unprovoked
confidences from men with whom we have no sort of affinity.  And
at the same time he began to look upon him more seriously.  Experience
has its prestige.  And the mate continued:</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for the old lady, I would have gone to the
devil.  I remembered her in time.  Nothing like having an old
lady to look after to steady a chap and make him face things. 
But as bad luck would have it, Captain Anthony has no mother living,
not a blessed soul belonging to him as far as I know.  Oh, aye,
I fancy he said once something to me of a sister.  But she's married. 
She don't need him.  Yes.  In the old days he used to talk to
me as if we had been brothers," exaggerated the mate sentimentally. 
"'Franklin,'&mdash;he would say&mdash;'this ship is my nearest relation
and she isn't likely to turn against me.  And I suppose you are
the man I've known the longest in the world.'  That's how he used
to speak to me.  Can I turn my back on him?  He has turned his
back on his ship; that's what it has come to.  He has no one now
but his old Franklin.  But what's a fellow to do to put things
back as they were and should be.  Should be &mdash;I say!"</p>

<p>His starting eyes had a terrible fixity.  Mr. Powell's irresistible
thought, "he resembles a boiled lobster in distress," was followed
by annoyance.  "Good Lord," he said, "you don't mean to hint that
Captain Anthony has fallen into bad company.  What is it you want
to save him from?"</p>

<p>"I do mean it," affirmed the mate, and the very absurdity of
the statement made it impressive&mdash;because it seemed so absolutely
audacious. "Well, you have a cheek," said young Powell, feeling
mentally helpless. "I have a notion the captain would half kill
you if he were to know how you carry on."</p>

<p>"And welcome," uttered the fervently devoted Franklin.  "I am
willing, if he would only clear the ship afterwards of that .
. . You are but a youngster and you may go and tell him what you
like.  Let him knock the stuffing out of his old Franklin first
and think it over afterwards. Anything to pull him together. 
But of course you wouldn't.  You are all right.  Only you don't
know that things are sometimes different from what they look. 
There are friendships that are no friendships, and marriages that
are no marriages.  Phoo!  Likely to be right&mdash;wasn't it?  Never
a hint to me.  I go off on leave and when I come back, there it
is&mdash;all over, settled!  Not a word beforehand.  No warning.  If
only: 'What do you think of it, Franklin?'&mdash;or anything of the
sort.  And that's a man who hardly ever did anything without asking
my advice.  Why!  He couldn't take over a new coat from the tailor
without . . . first thing, directly the fellow came on board with
some new clothes, whether in London or in China, it would be:
'Pass the word along there for Mr. Franklin.  Mr. Franklin wanted
in the cabin.'  In I would go.  'Just look at my back, Franklin. 
Fits all right, doesn't it?'  And I would say: 'First rate, sir,'
or whatever was the truth of it.  That or anything else.  Always
the truth of it.  Always.  And well he knew it; and that's why
he dared not speak right out.  Talking about workmen, alterations,
cabins . . . Phoo! . . . instead of a straightforward&mdash;'Wish me
joy, Mr. Franklin!' Yes, that was the way to let me know.  God
only knows what they are&mdash;perhaps she isn't his daughter any more
than she is . . . She doesn't resemble that old fellow.  Not a
bit.  Not a bit.  It's very awful.  You may well open your mouth,
young man.  But for goodness' sake, you who are mixed up with
that lot, keep your eyes and ears open too in case&mdash;in case of
. . . I don't know what.  Anything.  One wonders what can happen
here at sea!  Nothing.  Yet when a man is called a jailer behind
his back."</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin hid his face in his hands for a moment and Powell
shut his mouth, which indeed had been open.  He slipped out of
the mess-room noiselessly.  "The mate's crazy," he thought.  It
was his firm conviction.  Nevertheless, that evening, he felt
his inner tranquillity disturbed at last by the force and obstinacy
of this craze.  He couldn't dismiss it with the contempt it deserved. 
Had the word "jailer" really been pronounced?  A strange word
for the mate to even <em>imagine</em> he had heard.  A senseless,
unlikely word.  But this word being the only clear and definite
statement in these grotesque and dismal ravings was comparatively
restful to his mind.  Powell's mind rested on it still when he
came up at eight o'clock to take charge of the deck.  It was a
moonless night, thick with stars above, very dark on the water. 
A steady air from the west kept the sails asleep.  Franklin mustered
both watches in low tones as if for a funeral, then approaching
Powell:</p>

<p>"The course is east-south-east," said the chief mate distinctly.</p>

<p>"East-south-east, sir."</p>

<p>"Everything's set, Mr. Powell."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>The other lingered, his sentimental eyes gleamed silvery in the
shadowy face.  "A quiet night before us.  I don't know that there
are any special orders.  A settled, quiet night.  I dare say you
won't see the captain. Once upon a time this was the watch he
used to come up and start a chat with either of us then on deck. 
But now he sits in that infernal sterncabin and mopes.  Jailer&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell walked away from the mate and when at some distance
said, "Damn!" quite heartily.  It was a confounded nuisance. 
It had ceased to be funny; that hostile word "jailer" had given
the situation an air of reality.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Franklin's grotesque mortal envelope had disappeared from the
poop to seek its needful repose, if only the worried soul would
let it rest a while.  Mr. Powell, half sorry for the thick little
man, wondered whether it would let him.  For himself, he recognized
that the charm of a quiet watch on deck when one may let one's
thoughts roam in space and time had been spoiled without remedy. 
What shocked him most was the implied aspersion of complicity
on Mrs. Anthony.  It angered him.  In his own words to me, he
felt very "enthusiastic" about Mrs. Anthony. "Enthusiastic" is
good; especially as he couldn't exactly explain to me what he
meant by it.  But he felt enthusiastic, he says.  That silly Franklin
must have been dreaming.  That was it.  He had dreamed it all.
Ass.  Yet the injurious word stuck in Powell's mind with its associated
ideas of prisoner, of escape.  He became very uncomfortable. 
And just then (it might have been half an hour or more since he
had relieved Franklin) just then Mr. Smith came up on the poop
alone, like a gliding shadow and leaned over the rail by his side. 
Young Powell was affected disagreeably by his presence.  He made
a movement to go away but the other began to talk&mdash;and Powell
remained where he was as if retained by a mysterious compulsion. 
The conversation started by Mr. Smith had nothing peculiar.  He
began to talk of mail-boats in general and in the end seemed anxious
to discover what were the services from Port Elizabeth to London. 
Mr. Powell did not know for certain but imagined that there must
be communication with England at least twice a month.  "Are you
thinking of leaving us, sir; of going home by steam?  Perhaps
with Mrs. Anthony," he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No!  No!  How can I?"  Mr. Smith got quite agitated, for him,
which did not amount to much.  He was just asking for the sake
of something to talk about.  No idea at all of going home.  One
could not always do what one wanted and that's why there were
moments when one felt ashamed to live. This did not mean that
one did not want to live.  Oh no!</p>

<p>He spoke with careless slowness, pausing frequently and in such
a low voice that Powell had to strain his hearing to catch the
phrases dropped overboard as it were.  And indeed they seemed
not worth the effort.  It was like the aimless talk of a man pursuing
a secret train of thought far removed from the idle words we so
often utter only to keep in touch with our fellow beings.  An
hour passed.  It seemed as though Mr. Smith could not make up
his mind to go below.  He repeated himself.  Again he spoke of
lives which one was ashamed of.  It was necessary to put up with
such lives as long as there was no way out, no possible issue. 
He even alluded once more to mail-boat services on the East coast
of Africa and young Powell had to tell him once more that he knew
nothing about them.</p>

<p>"Every fortnight, I thought you said," insisted Mr. Smith.  He
stirred, seemed to detach himself from the rail with difficulty. 
His long, slender figure straightened into stiffness, as if hostile
to the enveloping soft peace of air and sea and sky, emitted into
the night a weak murmur which Mr. Powell fancied was the word,
"Abominable" repeated three times, but which passed into the faintly
louder declaration: "The moment has come&mdash;to go to bed," followed
by a just audible sigh.</p>

<p>"I sleep very well," added Mr. Smith in his restrained tone. 
"But it is the moment one opens one's eyes that is horrible at
sea.  These days!  Oh, these days!  I wonder how anybody can .
. . "</p>

<p>"I like the life," observed Mr. Powell.</p>

<p>"Oh, you.  You have only yourself to think of.  You have made
your bed. Well, it's very pleasant to feel that you are friendly
to us.  My daughter has taken quite a liking to you, Mr. Powell."</p>

<p>He murmured, "Good-night" and glided away rigidly.  Young Powell
asked himself with some distaste what was the meaning of these
utterances.  His mind had been worried at last into that questioning
attitude by no other person than the grotesque Franklin.  Suspicion
was not natural to him. And he took good care to carefully separate
in his thoughts Mrs. Anthony from this man of enigmatic words&mdash;her
father.  Presently he observed that the sheen of the two deck
dead-lights of Mr. Smith's room had gone out. The old gentleman
had been surprisingly quick in getting into bed. Shortly afterwards
the lamp in the foremost skylight of the saloon was turned out;
and this was the sign that the steward had taken in the tray and
had retired for the night.</p>

<p>Young Powell had settled down to the regular officer-of-the-watch
tramp in the dense shadow of the world decorated with stars high
above his head, and on earth only a few gleams of light about
the ship.  The lamp in the after skylight was kept burning through
the night.  There were also the dead-lights of the stern-cabins
glimmering dully in the deck far aft, catching his eye when he
turned to walk that way.  The brasses of the wheel glittered too,
with the dimly lit figure of the man detached, as if phosphorescent,
against the black and spangled background of the horizon.</p>

<p>Young Powell, in the silence of the ship, reinforced by the great
silent stillness of the world, said to himself that there was
something mysterious in such beings as the absurd Franklin, and
even in such beings as himself.  It was a strange and almost improper
thought to occur to the officer of the watch of a ship on the
high seas on no matter how quiet a night.  Why on earth was he
bothering his head?  Why couldn't he dismiss all these people
from his mind?  It was as if the mate had infected him with his
own diseased devotion.  He would not have believed it possible
that he should be so foolish.  But he was&mdash;clearly.  He was foolish
in a way totally unforeseen by himself.  Pushing this self-analysis
further, he reflected that the springs of his conduct were just
as obscure.</p>

<p>"I may be catching myself any time doing things of which I have
no conception," he thought.  And as he was passing near the mizzen-mast
he perceived a coil of rope left lying on the deck by the oversight
of the sweepers.  By an impulse which had nothing mysterious in
it, he stooped as he went by with the intention of picking it
up and hanging it up on its proper pin.  This movement brought
his head down to the level of the glazed end of the after skylight&mdash;the
lighted skylight of the most private part of the saloon, consecrated
to the exclusiveness of Captain Anthony's married life; the part,
let me remind you, cut off from the rest of that forbidden space
by a pair of heavy curtains.  I mention these curtains because
at this point Mr. Powell himself recalled the existence of that
unusual arrangement to my mind.</p>

<p>He recalled them with simple-minded compunction at that distance
of time. He said: "You understand that directly I stooped to pick
up that coil of running gear&mdash;the spanker foot-outhaul, it was
&mdash;I perceived that I could see right into that part of the
saloon the curtains were meant to make particularly private. 
Do you understand me?" he insisted.</p>

<p>I told him that I understood; and he proceeded to call my attention
to the wonderful linking up of small facts, with something of
awe left yet, after all these years, at the precise workmanship
of chance, fate, providence, call it what you will!  "For, observe,
Marlow," he said, making at me very round eyes which contrasted
funnily with the austere touch of grey on his temples, "observe,
my dear fellow, that everything depended on the men who cleared
up the poop in the evening leaving that coil of rope on the deck,
and on the topsail-tie carrying away in a most incomprehensible
and surprising manner earlier in the day, and the end of the chain
whipping round the coaming and shivering to bits the coloured
glass-pane at the end of the skylight.  It had the arms of the
city of Liverpool on it; I don't know why unless because the <em>Ferndale</em>
was registered in Liverpool.  It was very thick plate glass. 
Anyhow, the upper part got smashed, and directly we had attended
to things aloft Mr. Franklin had set the carpenter to patch up
the damage with some pieces of plain glass.  I don't know where
they got them; I think the people who fitted up new bookcases
in the captain's room had left some spare panes. Chips was there
the whole afternoon on his knees, messing with putty and red-lead. 
It wasn't a neat job when it was done, not by any means, but it
would serve to keep the weather out and let the light in.  Clear
glass.  And of course I was not thinking of it.  I just stooped
to pick up that rope and found my head within three inches of
that clear glass, and&mdash;dash it all!  I found myself out.  Not
half an hour before I was saying to myself that it was impossible
to tell what was in people's heads or at the back of their talk,
or what they were likely to be up to. And here I found myself
up to as low a trick as you can well think of. For, after I had
stooped, there I remained prying, spying, anyway looking, where
I had no business to look.  Not consciously at first, may be. 
He who has eyes, you know, nothing can stop him from seeing things
as long as there are things to see in front of him.  What I saw
at first was the end of the table and the tray clamped on to it,
a patent tray for sea use, fitted with holders for a couple of
decanters, water-jug and glasses.  The glitter of these things
caught my eye first; but what I saw next was the captain down
there, alone as far as I could see; and I could see pretty well
the whole of that part up to the cottage piano, dark against the
satin-wood panelling of the bulkhead.  And I remained looking. 
I did.  And I don't know that I was ashamed of myself either,
then.  It was the fault of that Franklin, always talking of the
man, making free with him to that extent that really he seemed
to have become our property, his and mine, in a way.  It's funny,
but one had that feeling about Captain Anthony.  To watch him
was not so much worse than listening to Franklin talking him over. 
Well, it's no use making excuses for what's inexcusable.  I watched;
but I dare say you know that there could have been nothing inimical
in this low behaviour of mine.  On the contrary.  I'll tell you
now what he was doing.  He was helping himself out of a decanter. 
I saw every movement, and I said to myself mockingly as though
jeering at Franklin in my thoughts, 'Hallo!  Here's the captain
taking to drink at last.'  He poured a little brandy or whatever
it was into a long glass, filled it with water, drank about a
fourth of it and stood the glass back into the holder.  Every
sign of a bad drinking bout, I was saying to myself, feeling quite
amused at the notions of that Franklin.  He seemed to me an enormous
ass, with his jealousy and his fears.  At that rate a month would
not have been enough for anybody to get drunk.  The captain sat
down in one of the swivel arm-chairs fixed around the table; I
had him right under me and as he turned the chair slightly, I
was looking, I may say, down his back.  He took another little
sip and then reached for a book which was lying on the table. 
I had not noticed it before.  Altogether the proceedings of a
desperate drunkard&mdash;weren't they?  He opened the book and held
it before his face. If this was the way he took to drink, then
I needn't worry.  He was in no danger from that, and as to any
other, I assure you no human being could have looked safer than
he did down there.  I felt the greatest contempt for Franklin
just then, while I looked at Captain Anthony sitting there with
a glass of weak brandy-and-water at his elbow and reading in the
cabin of his ship, on a quiet night&mdash;the quietest, perhaps the
finest, of a prosperous passage.  And if you wonder why I didn't
leave off my ugly spying I will tell you how it was.  Captain
Anthony was a great reader just about that time; and I, too, I
have a great liking for books.  To this day I can't come near
a book but I must know what it is about.  It was a thickish volume
he had there, small close print, double columns &mdash;I can see
it now.  What I wanted to make out was the title at the top of
the page.  I have very good eyes but he wasn't holding it conveniently
&mdash;I mean for me up there.  Well, it was a history of some
kind, that much I read and then suddenly he bangs the book face
down on the table, jumps up as if something had bitten him and
walks away aft.</p>

<p>"Funny thing shame is.  I had been behaving badly and aware of
it in a way, but I didn't feel really ashamed till the fright
of being found out in my honourable occupation drove me from it. 
I slunk away to the forward end of the poop and lounged about
there, my face and ears burning and glad it was a dark night,
expecting every moment to hear the captain's footsteps behind
me.  For I made sure he was coming on deck. Presently I thought
I had rather meet him face to face and I walked slowly aft prepared
to see him emerge from the companion before I got that far.  I
even thought of his having detected me by some means.  But it
was impossible, unless he had eyes in the top of his head.  I
had never had a view of his face down there.  It was impossible;
I was safe; and I felt very mean, yet, explain it as you may,
I seemed not to care. And the captain not appearing on deck, I
had the impulse to go on being mean.  I wanted another peep. 
I really don't know what was the beastly influence except that
Mr. Franklin's talk was enough to demoralize any man by raising
a sort of unhealthy curiosity which did away in my case with all
the restraints of common decency.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to run the risk of being caught squatting in
a suspicious attitude by the captain.  There was also the helmsman
to consider.  So what I did &mdash;I am surprised at my low cunning&mdash;was
to sit down naturally on the skylight-seat and then by bending
forward I found that, as I expected, I could look down through
the upper part of the end-pane.  The worst that could happen to
me then, if I remained too long in that position, was to be suspected
by the seaman aft at the wheel of having gone to sleep there. 
For the rest my ears would give me sufficient warning of any movements
in the companion.</p>

<p>"But in that way my angle of view was changed.  The field too
was smaller.  The end of the table, the tray and the swivel-chair
I had right under my eyes.  The captain had not come back yet. 
The piano I could not see now; but on the other hand I had a very
oblique downward view of the curtains drawn across the cabin and
cutting off the forward part of it just about the level of the
skylight-end and only an inch or so from the end of the table. 
They were heavy stuff, travelling on a thick brass rod with some
contrivance to keep the rings from sliding to and fro when the
ship rolled.  But just then the ship was as still almost as a
model shut up in a glass case while the curtains, joined closely,
and, perhaps on purpose, made a little too long moved no more
than a solid wall."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Marlow got up to get another cigar.  The night was getting on
to what I may call its deepest hour, the hour most favourable
to evil purposes of men's hate, despair or greed&mdash;to whatever
can whisper into their ears the unlawful counsels of protest against
things that are; the hour of illomened silence and chill and stagnation,
the hour when the criminal plies his trade and the victim of sleeplessness
reaches the lowest depth of dreadful discouragement; the hour
before the first sight of dawn.  I know it, because while Marlow
was crossing the room I looked at the clock on the mantelpiece. 
He however never looked that way though it is possible that he,
too, was aware of the passage of time.  He sat down heavily.</p>

<p>"Our friend Powell," he began again, "was very anxious that I
should understand the topography of that cabin.  I was interested
more by its moral atmosphere, that tension of falsehood, of desperate
acting, which tainted the pure sea-atmosphere into which the magnanimous
Anthony had carried off his conquest and&mdash;well&mdash;his self-conquest
too, trying to act at the same time like a beast of prey, a pure
spirit and the "most generous of men."  Too big an order clearly
because he was nothing of a monster but just a common mortal,
a little more self-willed and self-confident than most, may be,
both in his roughness and in his delicacy.</p>

<p>As to the delicacy of Mr. Powell's proceedings I'll say nothing. 
He found a sort of depraved excitement in watching an unconscious
man&mdash;and such an attractive and mysterious man as Captain Anthony
at that.  He wanted another peep at him.  He surmised that the
captain must come back soon because of the glass two-thirds full
and also of the book put down so brusquely.  God knows what sudden
pang had made Anthony jump up so.  I am convinced he used reading
as an opiate against the pain of his magnanimity which like all
abnormal growths was gnawing at his healthy substance with cruel
persistence.  Perhaps he had rushed into his cabin simply to groan
freely in absolute and delicate secrecy.  At any rate he tarried
there.  And young Powell would have grown weary and compunctious
at last if it had not become manifest to him that he had not been
alone in the highly incorrect occupation of watching the movements
of Captain Anthony.</p>

<p>Powell explained to me that no sound did or perhaps could reach
him from the saloon.  The first sign&mdash;and we must remember that
he was using his eyes for all they were worth&mdash;was an unaccountable
movement of the curtain.  It was wavy and very slight; just perceptible
in fact to the sharpened faculties of a secret watcher; for it
can't be denied that our wits are much more alert when engaged
in wrong-doing (in which one mustn't be found out) than in a righteous
occupation.</p>

<p>He became suspicious, with no one and nothing definite in his
mind.  He was suspicious of the curtain itself and observed it. 
It looked very innocent.  Then just as he was ready to put it
down to a trick of imagination he saw trembling movements where
the two curtains joined. Yes!  Somebody else besides himself had
been watching Captain Anthony.  He owns artlessly that this roused
his indignation.  It was really too much of a good thing.  In
this state of intense antagonism he was startled to observe tips
of fingers fumbling with the dark stuff.  Then they grasped the
edge of the further curtain and hung on there, just fingers and
knuckles and nothing else.  It made an abominable sight.  He was
looking at it with unaccountable repulsion when a hand came into
view; a short, puffy, old, freckled hand projecting into the lamplight,
followed by a white wrist, an arm in a grey coat-sleeve, up to
the elbow, beyond the elbow, extended tremblingly towards the
tray.  Its appearance was weird and nauseous, fantastic and silly. 
But instead of grabbing the bottle as Powell expected, this hand,
tremulous with senile eagerness, swerved to the glass, rested
on its edge for a moment (or so it looked from above) and went
back with a jerk.  The gripping fingers of the other hand vanished
at the same time, and young Powell staring at the motionless curtains
could indulge for a moment the notion that he had been dreaming.</p>

<p>But that notion did not last long.  Powell, after repressing
his first impulse to spring for the companion and hammer at the
captain's door, took steps to have himself relieved by the boatswain. 
He was in a state of distraction as to his feelings and yet lucid
as to his mind.  He remained on the skylight so as to keep his
eye on the tray.</p>

<p>Still the captain did not appear in the saloon.  "If he had,"
said Mr. Powell, "I knew what to do.  I would have put my elbow
through the pane instantly&mdash;crash."</p>

<p>I asked him why?</p>

<p>"It was the quickest dodge for getting him away from that tray,"
he explained.  "My throat was so dry that I didn't know if I could
shout loud enough.  And this was not a case for shouting, either."</p>

<p>The boatswain, sleepy and disgusted, arriving on the poop, found
the second officer doubled up over the end of the skylight in
a pose which might have been that of severe pain.  And his voice
was so changed that the man, though naturally vexed at being turned
out, made no comment on the plea of sudden indisposition which
young Powell put forward.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the sick man got off the poop must have
astonished the boatswain.  But Powell, at the moment he opened
the door leading into the saloon from the quarter-deck, had managed
to control his agitation.  He entered swiftly but without noise
and found himself in the dark part of the saloon, the strong sheen
of the lamp on the other side of the curtains visible only above
the rod on which they ran.  The door of Mr. Smith's cabin was
in that dark part.  He passed by it assuring himself by a quick
side glance that it was imperfectly closed.  "Yes," he said to
me.  "The old man must have been watching through the crack. 
Of that I am certain; but it was not for me that he was watching
and listening.  Horrible!  Surely he must have been startled to
hear and see somebody he did not expect.  He could not possibly
guess why I was coming in, but I suppose he must have been concerned." 
Concerned indeed!  He must have been thunderstruck, appalled.</p>

<p>Powell's only distinct aim was to remove the suspected tumbler. 
He had no other plan, no other intention, no other thought.  Do
away with it in some manner.  Snatch it up and run out with it.</p>

<p>You know that complete mastery of one fixed idea, not a reasonable
but an emotional mastery, a sort of concentrated exaltation. 
Under its empire men rush blindly through fire and water and opposing
violence, and nothing can stop them&mdash;unless, sometimes, a grain
of sand.  For his blind purpose (and clearly the thought of Mrs.
Anthony was at the bottom of it) Mr. Powell had plenty of time. 
What checked him at the crucial moment was the familiar, harmless
aspect of common things, the steady light, the open book on the
table, the solitude, the peace, the home-like effect of the place. 
He held the glass in his hand; all he had to do was to vanish
back beyond the curtains, flee with it noiselessly into the night
on deck, fling it unseen overboard.  A minute or less.  And then
all that would have happened would have been the wonder at the
utter disappearance of a glass tumbler, a ridiculous riddle in
pantry-affairs beyond the wit of anyone on board to solve.  The
grain of sand against which Powell stumbled in his headlong career
was a moment of incredulity as to the truth of his own conviction
because it had failed to affect the safe aspect of familiar things. 
He doubted his eyes too.  He must have dreamt it all!  "I am dreaming
now," he said to himself.  And very likely for a few seconds he
must have looked like a man in a trance or profoundly asleep on
his feet, and with a glass of brandy-and-water in his hand.</p>

<p>What woke him up and, at the same time, fixed his feet immovably
to the spot, was a voice asking him what he was doing there in
tones of thunder. Or so it sounded to his ears.  Anthony, opening
the door of his sterncabin had naturally exclaimed.  What else
could you expect?  And the exclamation must have been fairly loud
if you consider the nature of the sight which met his eye.  There,
before him, stood his second officer, a seemingly decent, well-bred
young man, who, being on duty, had left the deck and had sneaked
into the saloon, apparently for the inexpressibly mean purpose
of drinking up what was left of his captain's brandy-andwater. 
There he was, caught absolutely with the glass in his hand.</p>

<p>But the very monstrosity of appearances silenced Anthony after
the first exclamation; and young Powell felt himself pierced through
and through by the overshadowed glance of his captain.  Anthony
advanced quietly.  The first impulse of Mr. Powell, when discovered,
had been to dash the glass on the deck.  He was in a sort of panic. 
But deep down within him his wits were working, and the idea that
if he did that he could prove nothing and that the story he had
to tell was completely incredible, restrained him.  The captain
came forward slowly.  With his eyes now close to his, Powell,
spell-bound, numb all over, managed to lift one finger to the
deck above mumbling the explanatory words, "Boatswain on the poop."</p>

<p>The captain moved his head slightly as much as to say, "That's
all right"&mdash;and this was all.  Powell had no voice, no strength. 
The air was unbreathable, thick, sticky, odious, like hot jelly
in which all movements became difficult.  He raised the glass
a little with immense difficulty and moved his trammelled lips
sufficiently to form the words:</p>

<p>"Doctored."</p>

<p>Anthony glanced at it for an instant, only for an instant, and
again fastened his eyes on the face of his second mate.  Powell
added a fervent "I believe" and put the glass down on the tray. 
The captain's glance followed the movement and returned sternly
to his face.  The young man pointed a finger once more upwards
and squeezed out of his iron-bound throat six consecutive words
of further explanation.  "Through the skylight.  The white pane."</p>

<p>The captain raised his eyebrows very much at this, while young
Powell, ashamed but desperate, nodded insistently several times. 
He meant to say that: Yes.  Yes.  He had done that thing.  He
had been spying . . .  The captain's gaze became thoughtful. 
And, now the confession was over, the iron-bound feeling of Powell's
throat passed away giving place to a general anxiety which from
his breast seemed to extend to all the limbs and organs of his
body.  His legs trembled a little, his vision was confused, his
mind became blankly expectant.  But he was alert enough.  At a
movement of Anthony he screamed in a strangled whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't, sir!  Don't touch it."</p>

<p>The captain pushed aside Powell's extended arm, took up the glass
and raised it slowly against the lamplight.  The liquid, of very
pale amber colour, was clear, and by a glance the captain seemed
to call Powell's attention to the fact.  Powell tried to pronounce
the word, "dissolved" but he only thought of it with great energy
which however failed to move his lips.  Only when Anthony had
put down the glass and turned to him he recovered such a complete
command of his voice that he could keep it down to a hurried,
forcible whisper&mdash;a whisper that shook him.</p>

<p>"Doctored!  I swear it!  I have seen.  Doctored!  I have seen."</p>

<p>Not a feature of the captain's face moved.  His was a calm to
take one's breath away.  It did so to young Powell.  Then for
the first time Anthony made himself heard to the point.</p>

<p>"You did! . . . Who was it?"</p>

<p>And Powell gasped freely at last.  "A hand," he whispered fearfully,
"a hand and the arm&mdash;only the arm&mdash;like that."</p>

<p>He advanced his own, slow, stealthy, tremulous in faithful reproduction,
the tips of two fingers and the thumb pressed together and hovering
above the glass for an instant&mdash;then the swift jerk back, after
the deed.</p>

<p>"Like that," he repeated growing excited.  "From behind this." 
He grasped the curtain and glaring at the silent Anthony flung
it back disclosing the forepart of the saloon.  There was on one
to be seen.</p>

<p>Powell had not expected to see anybody.  "But," he said to me,
"I knew very well there was an ear listening and an eye glued
to the crack of a cabin door.  Awful thought.  And that door was
in that part of the saloon remaining in the shadow of the other
half of the curtain.  I pointed at it and I suppose that old man
inside saw me pointing.  The captain had a wonderful self-command. 
You couldn't have guessed anything from his face.  Well, it was
perhaps more thoughtful than usual.  And indeed this was something
to think about.  But I couldn't think steadily.  My brain would
give a sort of jerk and then go dead again.  I had lost all notion
of time, and I might have been looking at the captain for days
and months for all I knew before I heard him whisper to me fiercely:
"Not a word!" This jerked me out of that trance I was in and I
said "No!  No!  I didn't mean even you."</p>

<p>"I wanted to explain my conduct, my intentions, but I read in
his eyes that he understood me and I was only too glad to leave
off.  And there we were looking at each other, dumb, brought up
short by the question "What next?"</p>

<p>"I thought Captain Anthony was a man of iron till I saw him suddenly
fling his head to the right and to the left fiercely, like a wild
animal at bay not knowing which way to break out . . . "</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>"Truly," commented Marlow, "brought to bay was not a bad comparison;
a better one than Mr. Powell was aware of.  At that moment the
appearance of Flora could not but bring the tension to the breaking
point.  She came out in all innocence but not without vague dread. 
Anthony's exclamation on first seeing Powell had reached her in
her cabin, where, it seems, she was brushing her hair.  She had
heard the very words.  "What are you doing here?"  And the unwonted
loudness of the voice&mdash;his voice&mdash;breaking the habitual stillness
of that hour would have startled a person having much less reason
to be constantly apprehensive, than the captive of Anthony's masterful
generosity.  She had no means to guess to whom the question was
addressed and it echoed in her heart, as Anthony's voice always
did.  Followed complete silence.  She waited, anxious, expectant,
till she could stand the strain no longer, and with the weary
mental appeal of the overburdened.  "My God!  What is it now?"
she opened the door of her room and looked into the saloon.  Her
first glance fell on Powell.  For a moment, seeing only the second
officer with Anthony, she felt relieved and made as if to draw
back; but her sharpened perception detected something suspicious
in their attitudes, and she came forward slowly.</p>

<p>"I was the first to see Mrs. Anthony," related Powell, "because
I was facing aft.  The captain, noticing my eyes, looked quickly
over his shoulder and at once put his finger to his lips to caution
me.  As if I were likely to let out anything before her!  Mrs.
Anthony had on a dressing-gown of some grey stuff with red facings
and a thick red cord round her waist.  Her hair was down.  She
looked a child; a pale-faced child with big blue eyes and a red
mouth a little open showing a glimmer of white teeth.  The light
fell strongly on her as she came up to the end of the table. 
A strange child though; she hardly affected one like a child,
I remember.  Do you know," exclaimed Mr. Powell, who clearly must
have been, like many seamen, an industrious reader, "do you know
what she looked like to me with those big eyes and something appealing
in her whole expression.  She looked like a forsaken elf.  Captain
Anthony had moved towards her to keep her away from my end of
the table, where the tray was.  I had never seen them so near
to each other before, and it made a great contrast.  It was wonderful,
for, with his beard cut to a point, his swarthy, sunburnt complexion,
thin nose and his lean head there was something African, something
Moorish in Captain Anthony.  His neck was bare; he had taken off
his coat and collar and had drawn on his sleeping jacket in the
time that he had been absent from the saloon.  I seem to see him
now.  Mrs. Anthony too.  She looked from him to me &mdash;I suppose
I looked guilty or frightened&mdash;and from me to him, trying to guess
what there was between us two.  Then she burst out with a "What
has happened?" which seemed addressed to me.  I mumbled "Nothing! 
Nothing, ma'am," which she very likely did not hear.</p>

<p>"You must not think that all this had lasted a long time.  She
had taken fright at our behaviour and turned to the captain pitifully. 
"What is it you are concealing from me?"  A straight question&mdash;eh? 
I don't know what answer the captain would have made.  Before
he could even raise his eyes to her she cried out "Ah!  Here's
papa" in a sharp tone of relief, but directly afterwards she looked
to me as if she were holding her breath with apprehension.  I
was so interested in her that, how shall I say it, her exclamation
made no connection in my brain at first.  I also noticed that
she had sidled up a little nearer to Captain Anthony, before it
occurred to me to turn my head.  I can tell you my neck stiffened
in the twisted position from the shock of actually seeing that
old man!  He had dared!  I suppose you think I ought to have looked
upon him as mad.  But I couldn't.  It would have been certainly
easier.  But I could <em>not</em>.  You should have seen him. 
First of all he was completely dressed with his very cap still
on his head just as when he left me on deck two hours before,
saying in his soft voice: "The moment has come to go to bed"&mdash;while
he meant to go and do that thing and hide in his dark cabin, and
watch the stuff do its work.  A cold shudder ran down my back. 
He had his hands in the pockets of his jacket, his arms were pressed
close to his thin, upright body, and he shuffled across the cabin
with his short steps.  There was a red patch on each of his old
soft cheeks as if somebody had been pinching them.  He drooped
his head a little, and looked with a sort of underhand expectation
at the captain and Mrs. Anthony standing close together at the
other end of the saloon.  The calculating horrible impudence of
it!  His daughter was there; and I am certain he had seen the
captain putting his finger on his lips to warn me.  And then he
had coolly come out!  He passed my imagination, I assure you. 
After that one shiver his presence killed every faculty in me&mdash;wonder,
horror, indignation.  I felt nothing in particular just as if
he were still the old gentleman who used to talk to me familiarly
every day on deck.  Would you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Powell challenged my powers of wonder at this internal phenomenon,"
went on Marlow after a slight pause.  "But even if they had not
been fully engaged, together with all my powers of attention in
following the facts of the case, I would not have been astonished
by his statements about himself.  Taking into consideration his
youth they were by no means incredible; or, at any rate, they
were the least incredible part of the whole.  They were also the
least interesting part.  The interest was elsewhere, and there
of course all he could do was to look at the surface.  The inwardness
of what was passing before his eyes was hidden from him, who had
looked on, more impenetrably than from me who at a distance of
years was listening to his words.  What presently happened at
this crisis in Flora de Barral's fate was beyond his power of
comment, seemed in a sense natural.  And his own presence on the
scene was so strangely motived that it was left for me to marvel
alone at this young man, a completely chance-comer, having brought
it about on that night.</p>

<p>Each situation created either by folly or wisdom has its psychological
moment.  The behaviour of young Powell with its mixture of boyish
impulses combined with instinctive prudence, had not created it
&mdash;I can't say that&mdash;but had discovered it to the very people
involved.  What would have happened if he had made a noise about
his discovery?  But he didn't. His head was full of Mrs. Anthony
and he behaved with a discretion beyond his years.  Some nice
children often do; and surely it is not from reflection.  They
have their own inspirations.  Young Powell's inspiration consisted
in being "enthusiastic" about Mrs. Anthony. 'Enthusiastic' is
really good.  And he was amongst them like a child, sensitive,
impressionable, plastic&mdash;but unable to find for himself any sort
of comment.</p>

<p>I don't know how much mine may be worth; but I believe that just
then the tension of the false situation was at its highest.  Of
all the forms offered to us by life it is the one demanding a
couple to realize it fully, which is the most imperative.  Pairing
off is the fate of mankind. And if two beings thrown together,
mutually attracted, resist the necessity, fail in understanding
and voluntarily stop short of the&mdash;the embrace, in the noblest
meaning of the word, then they are committing a sin against life,
the call of which is simple.  Perhaps sacred.  And the punishment
of it is an invasion of complexity, a tormenting, forcibly tortuous
involution of feelings, the deepest form of suffering from which
indeed something significant may come at last, which may be criminal
or heroic, may be madness or wisdom&mdash;or even a straight if despairing
decision.</p>

<p>Powell on taking his eyes off the old gentleman noticed Captain
Anthony, swarthy as an African, by the side of Flora whiter than
the lilies, take his handkerchief out and wipe off his forehead
the sweat of anguish&mdash;like a man who is overcome.  "And no wonder,"
commented Mr. Powell here.  Then the captain said, "Hadn't you
better go back to your room."  This was to Mrs. Anthony.  He tried
to smile at her.  "Why do you look startled?  This night is like
any other night."</p>

<p>"Which," Powell again commented to me earnestly, "was a lie .
. . No wonder he sweated."  You see from this the value of Powell's
comments. Mrs. Anthony then said: "Why are you sending me away?"</p>

<p>"Why!  That you should go to sleep.  That you should rest." 
And Captain Anthony frowned.  Then sharply, "You stay here, Mr.
Powell.  I shall want you presently."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Powell had not moved.  Flora did not mind
his presence.  He himself had the feeling of being of no account
to those three people.  He was looking at Mrs. Anthony as unabashed
as the proverbial cat looking at a king.  Mrs. Anthony glanced
at him.  She did not move, gripped by an inexplicable premonition. 
She had arrived at the very limit of her endurance as the object
of Anthony's magnanimity; she was the prey of an intuitive dread
of she did not know what mysterious influence; she felt herself
being pushed back into that solitude, that moral loneliness, which
had made all her life intolerable.  And then, in that close communion
established again with Anthony, she felt&mdash;as on that night in
the garden&mdash;the force of his personal fascination.  The passive
quietness with which she looked at him gave her the appearance
of a person bewitched&mdash;or, say, mesmerically put to sleep&mdash;beyond
any notion of her surroundings.</p>

<p>After telling Mr. Powell not to go away the captain remained
silent. Suddenly Mrs. Anthony pushed back her loose hair with
a decisive gesture of her arms and moved still nearer to him. 
"Here's papa up yet," she said, but she did not look towards Mr.
Smith.  "Why is it?  And you?  I can't go on like this, Roderick&mdash;between
you two.  Don't."</p>

<p>Anthony interrupted her as if something had untied his tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh yes.  Here's your father.  And . . . Why not.  Perhaps it
is just as well you came out.  Between us two?  Is that it?  I
won't pretend I don't understand.  I am not blind.  But I can't
fight any longer for what I haven't got.  I don't know what you
imagine has happened.  Something has though.  Only you needn't
be afraid.  No shadow can touch you&mdash;because I give up.  I can't
say we had much talk about it, your father and I, but, the long
and the short of it is, that I must learn to live without you&mdash;which
I have told you was impossible.  I was speaking the truth.  But
I have done fighting, or waiting, or hoping.  Yes.  You shall
go."</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Powell who (he confessed to me) was listening
with uncomprehending awe, heard behind his back a triumphant chuckling
sound. It gave him the shudders, he said, to mention it now; but
at the time, except for another chill down the spine, it had not
the power to destroy his absorption in the scene before his eyes,
and before his ears too, because just then Captain Anthony raised
his voice grimly.  Perhaps he too had heard the chuckle of the
old man.</p>

<p>"Your father has found an argument which makes me pause, if it
does not convince me.  No!  I can't answer it.  I &mdash;I don't
want to answer it.  I simply surrender.  He shall have his way
with you&mdash;and with me.  Only," he added in a gloomy lowered tone
which struck Mr. Powell as if a pedal had been put down, "only
it shall take a little time.  I have never lied to you.  Never. 
I renounce not only my chance but my life.  In a few days, directly
we get into port, the very moment we do, I, who have said I could
never let you go, I shall let you go."</p>

<p>To the innocent beholder Anthony seemed at this point to become
physically exhausted.  My view is that the utter falseness of
his, I may say, aspirations, the vanity of grasping the empty
air, had come to him with an overwhelming force, leaving him disarmed
before the other's mad and sinister sincerity.  As he had said
himself he could not fight for what he did not possess; he could
not face such a thing as this for the sake of his mere magnanimity. 
The normal alone can overcome the abnormal.  He could not even
reproach that man over there.  "I own myself beaten," he said
in a firmer tone.  "You are free.  I let you off since I must."</p>

<p>Powell, the onlooker, affirms that at these incomprehensible
words Mrs. Anthony stiffened into the very image of astonishment,
with a frightened stare and frozen lips.  But next minute a cry
came out from her heart, not very loud but of a quality which
made not only Captain Anthony (he was not looking at her), not
only him but also the more distant (and equally unprepared) young
man, catch their breath: "But I don't want to be let off," she
cried.</p>

<p>She was so still that one asked oneself whether the cry had come
from her.  The restless shuffle behind Powell's back stopped short,
the intermittent shadowy chuckling ceased too.  Young Powell,
glancing round, saw Mr. Smith raise his head with his faded eyes
very still, puckered at the corners, like a man perceiving something
coming at him from a great distance.  And Mrs. Anthony's voice
reached Powell's ears, entreating and indignant.</p>

<p>"You can't cast me off like this, Roderick.  I won't go away
from you.  I won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Powell turned about and discovered then that what Mr. Smith was
puckering his eyes at, was the sight of his daughter clinging
round Captain Anthony's neck&mdash;a sight not in itself improper,
but which had the power to move young Powell with a bashfully
profound emotion.  It was different from his emotion while spying
at the revelations of the skylight, but in this case too he felt
the discomfort, if not the guilt, of an unseen beholder.  Experience
was being piled up on his young shoulders.  Mrs. Anthony's hair
hung back in a dark mass like the hair of a drowned woman. She
looked as if she would let go and sink to the floor if the captain
were to withhold his sustaining arm.  But the captain obviously
had no such intention.  Standing firm and still he gazed with
sombre eyes at Mr. Smith.  For a time the low convulsive sobbing
of Mr. Smith's daughter was the only sound to trouble the silence. 
The strength of Anthony's clasp pressing Flora to his breast could
not be doubted even at that distance, and suddenly, awakening
to his opportunity, he began to partly support her, partly carry
her in the direction of her cabin.  His head was bent over her
solicitously, then recollecting himself, with a glance full of
unwonted fire, his voice ringing in a note unknown to Mr. Powell,
he cried to him, "Don't you go on deck yet.  I want you to stay
down here till I come back.  There are some instructions I want
to give you."</p>

<p>And before the young man could answer, Anthony had disappeared
in the stern-cabin, burdened and exulting.</p>

<p>"Instructions," commented Mr. Powell.  "That was all right. 
Very likely; but they would be such instructions as, I thought
to myself, no ship's officer perhaps had ever been given before. 
It made me feel a little sick to think what they would be dealing
with, probably.  But there! Everything that happens on board ship
on the high seas has got to be dealt with somehow.  There are
no special people to fly to for assistance.  And there I was with
that old man left in my charge.  When he noticed me looking at
him he started to shuffle again athwart the saloon.  He kept his
hands rammed in his pockets, he was as stiff-backed as ever, only
his head hung down.  After a bit he says in his gentle soft tone:
"Did you see it?"</p>

<p>There were in Powell's head no special words to fit the horror
of his feelings.  So he said&mdash;he had to say something, "Good God! 
What were you thinking of, Mr. Smith, to try to . . . "   And
then he left off.  He dared not utter the awful word poison. 
Mr. Smith stopped his prowl.</p>

<p>"Think!  What do you know of thinking.  I don't think.  There
is something in my head that thinks.  The thoughts in men, it's
like being drunk with liquor or &mdash;You can't stop them.  A
man who thinks will think anything.  No!  But have you seen it. 
Have you?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I have!  I am certain!" said Powell forcibly.  "I
was looking at you all the time.  You've done something to the
drink in that glass."</p>

<p>Then Powell lost his breath somehow.  Mr. Smith looked at him
curiously, with mistrust.</p>

<p>"My good young man, I don't know what you are talking about. 
I ask you&mdash;have you seen?  Who would have believed it? with her
arms round his neck.  When!  Oh!  Ha!  Ha!  You did see!  Didn't
you?  It wasn't a delusion&mdash;was it?  Her arms round . . . But
I have never wholly trusted her."</p>

<p>"Then I flew out at him, said Mr. Powell.  I told him he was
jolly lucky to have fallen upon Captain Anthony.  A man in a million. 
He started again shuffling to and fro.  "You too," he said mournfully,
keeping his eyes down.  "Eh?  Wonderful man?  But have you a notion
who I am?  Listen! I have been the Great Mr. de Barral.  So they
printed it in the papers while they were getting up a conspiracy. 
And I have been doing time.  And now I am brought low."  His voice
died down to a mere breath.  "Brought low."</p>

<p>He took his hands out of his pocket, dragged the cap down on
his head and stuck them back into his pockets, exactly as if preparing
himself to go out into a great wind.  "But not so low as to put
up with this disgrace, to see her, fast in this fellow's clutches,
without doing something.  She wouldn't listen to me.  Frightened? 
Silly?  I had to think of some way to get her out of this.  Did
you think she cared for him?  No!  Would anybody have thought
so?  No!  She pretended it was for my sake.  She couldn't understand
that if I hadn't been an old man I would have flown at his throat
months ago.  As it was I was tempted every time he looked at her. 
My girl.  Ough!  Any man but this.  And all the time the wicked
little fool was lying to me.  It was their plot, their conspiracy! 
These conspiracies are the devil.  She has been leading me on,
till she has fairly put my head under the heel of that jailer,
of that scoundrel, of her husband . . .  Treachery!  Bringing
me low.  Lower than herself.  In the dirt.  That's what it means. 
Doesn't it?  Under his heel!"</p>

<p>He paused in his restless shuffle and again, seizing his cap
with both hands, dragged it furiously right down on his ears. 
Powell had lost himself in listening to these broken ravings,
in looking at that old feverish face when, suddenly, quick as
lightning, Mr. Smith spun round, snatched up the captain's glass
and with a stifled, hurried exclamation, "Here's luck," tossed
the liquor down his throat.</p>

<p>"I know now the meaning of the word 'Consternation,'" went on
Mr. Powell. "That was exactly my state of mind.  I thought to
myself directly: There's nothing in that drink.  I have been dreaming,
I have made the awfulest mistake! . . ."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith put the glass down.  He stood before Powell unharmed,
quieted down, in a listening attitude, his head inclined on one
side, chewing his thin lips.  Suddenly he blinked queerly, grabbed
Powell's shoulder and collapsed, subsiding all at once as though
he had gone soft all over, as a piece of silk stuff collapses. 
Powell seized his arm instinctively and checked his fall; but
as soon as Mr. Smith was fairly on the floor he jerked himself
free and backed away.  Almost as quick he rushed forward again
and tried to lift up the body.  But directly he raised his shoulders
he knew that the man was dead!  Dead!</p>

<p>He lowered him down gently.  He stood over him without fear or
any other feeling, almost indifferent, far away, as it were. 
And then he made another start and, if he had not kept Mrs. Anthony
always in his mind, he would have let out a yell for help.  He
staggered to her cabin-door, and, as it was, his call for "Captain
Anthony" burst out of him much too loud; but he made a great effort
of self-control.  "I am waiting for my orders, sir," he said outside
that door distinctly, in a steady tone.</p>

<p>It was very still in there; still as death.  Then he heard a
shuffle of feet and the captain's voice "All right.  Coming." 
He leaned his back against the bulkhead as you see a drunken man
sometimes propped up against a wall, half doubled up.  In that
attitude the captain found him, when he came out, pulling the
door to after him quickly.  At once Anthony let his eyes run all
over the cabin.  Powell, without a word, clutched his forearm,
led him round the end of the table and began to justify himself. 
"I couldn't stop him," he whispered shakily.  "He was too quick
for me.  He drank it up and fell down."  But the captain was not
listening.  He was looking down at Mr. Smith, thinking perhaps
that it was a mere chance his own body was not lying there.  They
did not want to speak.  They made signs to each other with their
eyes.  The captain grasped Powell's shoulder as if in a vice and
glanced at Mrs. Anthony's cabin door, and it was enough.  He knew
that the young man understood him.  Rather!  Silence!  Silence
for ever about this.  Their very glances became stealthy.  Powell
looked from the body to the door of the dead man's state-room. 
The captain nodded and let him go; and then Powell crept over,
hooked the door open and crept back with fearful glances towards
Mrs. Anthony's cabin.  They stooped over the corpse.  Captain
Anthony lifted up the shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. Powell shuddered.  "I'll never forget that interminable journey
across the saloon, step by step, holding our breath.  For part
of the way the drawn half of the curtain concealed us from view
had Mrs. Anthony opened her door; but I didn't draw a free breath
till after we laid the body down on the swinging cot.  The reflection
of the saloon light left most of the cabin in the shadow.  Mr.
Smith's rigid, extended body looked shadowy too, shadowy and alive. 
You know he always carried himself as stiff as a poker.  We stood
by the cot as though waiting for him to make us a sign that he
wanted to be left alone.  The captain threw his arm over my shoulder
and said in my very ear: "The steward'll find him in the morning."</p>

<p>"I made no answer.  It was for him to say.  It was perhaps the
best way. It's no use talking about my thoughts.  They were not
concerned with myself, nor yet with that old man who terrified
me more now than when he was alive.  Him whom I pitied was the
captain.  He whispered.  "I am certain of you, Mr. Powell.  You
had better go on deck now.  As to me . . . " and I saw him raise
his hands to his head as if distracted.  But his last words before
we stole out that cabin stick to my mind with the very tone of
his mutter&mdash;to himself, not to me:</p>

<p>"No!  No!  I am not going to stumble now over that corpse."</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>"This is what our Mr. Powell had to tell me," said Marlow, changing
his tone.  I was glad to learn that Flora de Barral had been saved
from <em>that</em> sinister shadow at least falling upon her path.</p>

<p>We sat silent then, my mind running on the end of de Barral,
on the irresistible pressure of imaginary griefs, crushing conscience,
scruples, prudence, under their ever-expanding volume; on the
sombre and venomous irony in the obsession which had mastered
that old man.</p>

<p>"Well," I said.</p>

<p>"The steward found him," Mr. Powell roused himself.  "He went
in there with a cup of tea at five and of course dropped it. 
I was on watch again.  He reeled up to me on deck pale as death. 
I had been expecting it; and yet I could hardly speak.  "Go and
tell the captain quietly," I managed to say.  He ran off muttering
"My God!  My God!" and I'm hanged if he didn't get hysterical
while trying to tell the captain, and start screaming in the saloon,
"Fully dressed!  Dead!  Fully dressed!"  Mrs. Anthony ran out
of course but she didn't get hysterical.  Franklin, who was there
too, told me that she hid her face on the captain's breast and
then he went out and left them there.  It was days before Mrs.
Anthony was seen on deck.  The first time I spoke to her she gave
me her hand and said, "My poor father was quite fond of you, Mr.
Powell."  She started wiping her eyes and I fled to the other
side of the deck.  One would like to forget all this had ever
come near her."</p>

<p>But clearly he could not, because after lighting his pipe he
began musing aloud: "Very strong stuff it must have been.  I wonder
where he got it. It could hardly be at a common chemist.  Well,
he had it from somewhere&mdash;a mere pinch it must have been, no more."</p>

<p>"I have my theory," observed Marlow, "which to a certain extent
does away with the added horror of a coldly premeditated crime. 
Chance had stepped in there too.  It was not Mr. Smith who obtained
the poison.  It was the Great de Barral.  And it was not meant
for the obscure, magnanimous conqueror of Flora de Barral; it
was meant for the notorious financier whose enterprises had nothing
to do with magnanimity.  He had his physician in his days of greatness. 
I even seem to remember that the man was called at the trial on
some small point or other.  I can imagine that de Barral went
to him when he saw, as he could hardly help seeing, the possibility
of a "triumph of envious rivals"&mdash;a heavy sentence.</p>

<p>I doubt if for love or even for money, but I think possibly,
from pity that man provided him with what Mr. Powell called "strong
stuff."  From what Powell saw of the very act I am fairly certain
it must have been contained in a capsule and that he had it about
him on the last day of his trial, perhaps secured by a stitch
in his waistcoat pocket.  He didn't use it.  Why?  Did he think
of his child at the last moment?  Was it want of courage?  We
can't tell.  But he found it in his clothes when he came out of
jail.  It had escaped investigation if there was any. Chance had
armed him.  And chance alone, the chance of Mr. Powell's life,
forced him to turn the abominable weapon against himself.</p>

<p>I imparted my theory to Mr. Powell who accepted it at once as,
in a sense, favourable to the father of Mrs. Anthony.  Then he
waved his hand. "Don't let us think of it."</p>

<p>I acquiesced and very soon he observed dreamily:</p>

<p>"I was with Captain and Mrs. Anthony sailing all over the world
for near on six years.  Almost as long as Franklin."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!  What about Franklin?" I asked.</p>

<p>Powell smiled.  "He left the <em>Ferndale</em> a year or so afterwards,
and I took his place.  Captain Anthony recommended him for a command. 
You don't think Captain Anthony would chuck a man aside like an
old glove. But of course Mrs. Anthony did not like him very much. 
I don't think she ever let out a whisper against him but Captain
Anthony could read her thoughts.</p>

<p>And again Powell seemed to lose himself in the past.  I asked,
for suddenly the vision of the Fynes passed through my mind.</p>

<p>"Any children?"</p>

<p>Powell gave a start.  "No!  No!  Never had any children," and
again subsided, puffing at his short briar pipe.</p>

<p>"Where are they now?" I inquired next as if anxious to ascertain
that all Fyne's fears had been misplaced and vain as our fears
often are; that there were no undesirable cousins for his dear
girls, no danger of intrusion on their spotless home.  Powell
looked round at me slowly, his pipe smouldering in his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" he uttered in a deep voice.</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"That the <em>Ferndale</em> was lost this four years or more. 
Sunk.  Collision. And Captain Anthony went down with her."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" I cried quite affected as if I had known
Captain Anthony personally.  "Was&mdash;was Mrs. Anthony lost too?"</p>

<p>"You might as well ask if I was lost," Mr. Powell rejoined so
testily as to surprise me.  "You see me here,&mdash;don't you."</p>

<p>He was quite huffy, but noticing my wondering stare he smoothed
his ruffled plumes.  And in a musing tone.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Good men go out as if there was no use for them in the
world.  It seems as if there were things that, as the Turks say,
are written.  Or else fate has a try and sometimes misses its
mark.  You remember that close shave we had of being run down
at night, I told you of, my first voyage with them.  This go it
was just at dawn.  A flat calm and a fog thick enough to slice
with a knife.  Only there were no explosives on board.  I was
on deck and I remember the cursed, murderous thing looming up
alongside and Captain Anthony (we were both on deck) calling out,
"Good God!  What's this!  Shout for all hands, Powell, to save
themselves.  There's no dynamite on board now.  I am going to
get the wife! . . "  I yelled, all the watch on deck yelled. 
Crash!"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell gasped at the recollection.  "It was a Belgian Green
Star liner, the <em>Westland</em>," he went on, "commanded by
one of those stop-fornothing skippers.  Flaherty was his name
and I hope he will die without absolution.  She cut half through
the old <em>Ferndale</em> and after the blow there was a silence
like death.  Next I heard the captain back on deck shouting, "Set
your engines slow ahead," and a howl of "Yes, yes," answering
him from her forecastle; and then a whole crowd of people up there
began making a row in the fog.  They were throwing ropes down
to us in dozens, I must say.  I and the captain fastened one of
them under Mrs. Anthony's arms: I remember she had a sort of dim
smile on her face."</p>

<p>"Haul up carefully," I shouted to the people on the steamer's
deck. "You've got a woman on that line."</p>

<p>The captain saw her landed up there safe.  And then we made a
rush round our decks to see no one was left behind.  As we got
back the captain says: "Here she's gone at last, Powell; the dear
old thing!  Run down at sea."</p>

<p>"Indeed she is gone," I said.  "But it might have been worse. 
Shin up this rope, sir, for God's sake.  I will steady it for
you."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about," he says angrily.  "It isn't my
turn.  Up with you."</p>

<p>These were the last words he ever spoke on earth I suppose. 
I knew he meant to be the last to leave his ship, so I swarmed
up as quick as I could, and those damned lunatics up there grab
at me from above, lug me in, drag me along aft through the row
and the riot of the silliest excitement I ever did see.  Somebody
hails from the bridge, "Have you got them all on board?" and a
dozen silly asses start yelling all together, "All saved!  All
saved," and then that accursed Irishman on the bridge, with me
roaring No!  No! till I thought my head would burst, rings his
engines astern.  He rings the engines astern &mdash;I fighting
like mad to make myself heard!  And of course . . . "</p>

<p>I saw tears, a shower of them fall down Mr. Powell's face.  His
voice broke.</p>

<p>"The <em>Ferndale</em> went down like a stone and Captain Anthony
went down with her, the finest man's soul that ever left a sailor's
body.  I raved like a maniac, like a devil, with a lot of fools
crowding round me and asking, "Aren't you the captain?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't fit to tie the shoe-strings of the man you have drowned,"
I screamed at them . . .  Well!  Well!  I could see for myself
that it was no good lowering a boat.  You couldn't have seen her
alongside.  No use. And only think, Marlow, it was I who had to
go and tell Mrs. Anthony. They had taken her down below somewhere,
first-class saloon.  I had to go and tell her!  That Flaherty,
God forgive him, comes to me as white as a sheet, "I think you
are the proper person."  God forgive him.  I wished to die a hundred
times.  A lot of kind ladies, passengers, were chattering excitedly
around Mrs. Anthony&mdash;a real parrot house.  The ship's doctor went
before me.  He whispers right and left and then there falls a
sudden hush.  Yes, I wished myself dead.  But Mrs. Anthony was
a brick.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Powell fairly burst into tears.  "No one could help
loving Captain Anthony.  I leave you to imagine what he was to
her.  Yet before the week was out it was she who was helping me
to pull myself together."</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Anthony in England now?" I asked after a while.</p>

<p>He wiped his eyes without any false shame.  "Oh yes."  He began
to look for matches, and while diving for the box under the table
added: "And not very far from here either.  That little village
up there&mdash;you know."</p>

<p>"No!  Really!  Oh I see!"</p>

<p>Mr. Powell smoked austerely, very detached.  But I could not
let him off like this.  The sly beggar.  So this was the secret
of his passion for sailing about the river, the reason of his
fondness for that creek.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," I said, "that you are still as 'enthusiastic'
as ever. Eh?  If I were you I would just mention my enthusiasm
to Mrs. Anthony. Why not?"</p>

<p>He caught his falling pipe neatly.  But if what the French call
<em>effarement</em> was ever expressed on a human countenance
it was on this occasion, testifying to his modesty, his sensibility
and his innocence. He looked afraid of somebody overhearing my
audacious&mdash;almost sacrilegious hint&mdash;as if there had not been
a mile and a half of lonely marshland and dykes between us and
the nearest human habitation.  And then perhaps he remembered
the soothing fact for he allowed a gleam to light up his eyes,
like the reflection of some inward fire tended in the sanctuary
of his heart by a devotion as pure as that of any vestal.</p>

<p>It flashed and went out.  He smiled a bashful smile, sighed:</p>

<p>"Pah!  Foolishness.  You ought to know better," he said, more
sad than annoyed.  "But I forgot that you never knew Captain Anthony,"
he added indulgently.</p>

<p>I reminded him that I knew Mrs. Anthony; even before he&mdash;an old
friend now&mdash;had ever set eyes on her.  And as he told me that
Mrs. Anthony had heard of our meetings I wondered whether she
would care to see me.  Mr. Powell volunteered no opinion then;
but next time we lay in the creek he said, "She will be very pleased. 
You had better go to-day."</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced before I approached the cottage. 
The amenity of a fine day in its decline surrounded me with a
beneficent, a calming influence; I felt it in the silence of the
shady lane, in the pure air, in the blue sky.  It is difficult
to retain the memory of the conflicts, miseries, temptations and
crimes of men's self-seeking existence when one is alone with
the charming serenity of the unconscious nature.  Breathing the
dreamless peace around the picturesque cottage I was approaching,
it seemed to me that it must reign everywhere, over all the globe
of water and land and in the hearts of all the dwellers on this
earth.</p>

<p>Flora came down to the garden gate to meet me, no longer the
perversely tempting, sorrowful, wisp of white mist drifting in
the complicated bad dream of existence.  Neither did she look
like a forsaken elf.  I stammered out stupidly, "Again in the
country, Miss . . . Mrs . . . "  She was very good, returned the
pressure of my hand, but we were slightly embarrassed.  Then we
laughed a little.  Then we became grave.</p>

<p>I am no lover of day-breaks.  You know how thin, equivocal, is
the light of the dawn.  But she was now her true self, she was
like a fine tranquil afternoon&mdash;and not so very far advanced either. 
A woman not much over thirty, with a dazzling complexion and a
little colour, a lot of hair, a smooth brow, a fine chin, and
only the eyes of the Flora of the old days, absolutely unchanged.</p>

<p>In the room into which she led me we found a Miss Somebody &mdash;I
didn't catch the name,&mdash;an unobtrusive, even an indistinct, middle-aged
person in black.  A companion.  All very proper.  She came and
went and even sat down at times in the room, but a little apart,
with some sewing.  By the time she had brought in a lighted lamp
I had heard all the details which really matter in this story. 
Between me and her who was once Flora de Barral the conversation
was not likely to keep strictly to the weather.</p>

<p>The lamp had a rosy shade; and its glow wreathed her in perpetual
blushes, made her appear wonderfully young as she sat before me
in a deep, high-backed arm-chair.  I asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me what is it you said in that famous letter which so upset
Mrs. Fyne, and caused little Fyne to interfere in this offensive
manner?"</p>

<p>"It was simply crude," she said earnestly.  "I was feeling reckless
and I wrote recklessly.  I knew she would disapprove and I wrote
foolishly.  It was the echo of her own stupid talk.  I said that
I did not love her brother but that I had no scruples whatever
in marrying him."</p>

<p>She paused, hesitating, then with a shy half-laugh:</p>

<p>"I really believed I was selling myself, Mr. Marlow.  And I was
proud of it.  What I suffered afterwards I couldn't tell you;
because I only discovered my love for my poor Roderick through
agonies of rage and humiliation.  I came to suspect him of despising
me; but I could not put it to the test because of my father. 
Oh!  I would not have been too proud.  But I had to spare poor
papa's feelings.  Roderick was perfect, but I felt as though I
were on the rack and not allowed even to cry out. Papa's prejudice
against Roderick was my greatest grief.  It was distracting. 
It frightened me.  Oh!  I have been miserable!  That night when
my poor father died suddenly I am certain they had some sort of
discussion, about me.  But I did not want to hold out any longer
against my own heart!  I could not."</p>

<p>She stopped short, then impulsively:</p>

<p>"Truth will out, Mr. Marlow."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>She went on musingly.</p>

<p>"Sorrow and happiness were mingled at first like darkness and
light.  For months I lived in a dusk of feelings.  But it was
quiet.  It was warm . . . "</p>

<p>Again she paused, then going back in her thoughts.  "No!  There
was no harm in that letter.  It was simply foolish.  What did
I know of life then?  Nothing.  But Mrs. Fyne ought to have known
better.  She wrote a letter to her brother, a little later.  Years
afterwards Roderick allowed me to glance at it.  I found in it
this sentence: 'For years I tried to make a friend of that girl;
but I warn you once more that she has the nature of a heartless
adventuress . . . '  Adventuress!" repeated Flora slowly.  "So
be it.  I have had a fine adventure."</p>

<p>"It was fine, then," I said interested.</p>

<p>"The finest in the world!  Only think!  I loved and I was loved,
untroubled, at peace, without remorse, without fear.  All the
world, all life were transformed for me.  And how much I have
seen!  How good people were to me!  Roderick was so much liked
everywhere.  Yes, I have known kindness and safety.  The most
familiar things appeared lighted up with a new light, clothed
with a loveliness I had never suspected.  The sea itself! . .
. You are a sailor.  You have lived your life on it.  But do you
know how beautiful it is, how strong, how charming, how friendly,
how mighty . . . "</p>

<p>I listened amazed and touched.  She was silent only a little
while.</p>

<p>"It was too good to last.  But nothing can rob me of it now .
. .  Don't think that I repine.  I am not even sad now.  Yes,
I have been happy.  But I remember also the time when I was unhappy
beyond endurance, beyond desperation.  Yes.  You remember that. 
And later on, too.  There was a time on board the <em>Ferndale</em>
when the only moments of relief I knew were when I made Mr. Powell
talk to me a little on the poop.  You like him? &mdash;Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Excellent fellow," I said warmly.  "You see him often?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  I hardly know another soul in the world.  I am alone. 
And he has plenty of time on his hands.  His aunt died a few years
ago.  He's doing nothing, I believe."</p>

<p>"He is fond of the sea," I remarked.  "He loves it."</p>

<p>"He seems to have given it up," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I wonder why?"</p>

<p>She remained silent.  "Perhaps it is because he loves something
else better," I went on.  "Come, Mrs. Anthony, don't let me carry
away from here the idea that you are a selfish person, hugging
the memory of your past happiness, like a rich man his treasure,
forgetting the poor at the gate."</p>

<p>I rose to go, for it was getting late.  She got up in some agitation
and went out with me into the fragrant darkness of the garden. 
She detained my hand for a moment and then in the very voice of
the Flora of old days, with the exact intonation, showing the
old mistrust, the old doubt of herself, the old scar of the blow
received in childhood, pathetic and funny, she murmured, "Do you
think it possible that he should care for me?"</p>

<p>"Just ask him yourself.  You are brave."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am brave enough," she said with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Then do.  For if you don't you will be wronging that patient
man cruelly."</p>

<p>I departed leaving her dumb.  Next day, seeing Powell making
preparations to go ashore, I asked him to give my regards to Mrs.
Anthony.  He promised he would.</p>

<p>"Listen, Powell," I said.  "We got to know each other by chance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" he admitted, adjusting his hat.</p>

<p>"And the science of life consists in seizing every chance that
presents itself," I pursued.  "Do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"Gospel truth," he declared innocently.</p>

<p>"Well, don't forget it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I!  I don't expect now anything to present itself," he said,
jumping ashore.</p>

<p>He didn't turn up at high water.  I set my sail and just as I
had cast off from the bank, round the black barn, in the dusk,
two figures appeared and stood silent, indistinct.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Powell?" I hailed.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Anthony," his voice came impressively through the silence
of the great marsh.  "I am not sailing to-night.  I have to see
Mrs. Anthony home."</p>

<p>"Then I must even go alone," I cried.</p>

<p>Flora's voice wished me "<em>bon voyage</em>" in a most friendly
but tremulous tone.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me before long," shouted Powell, suddenly,
just as my boat had cleared the mouth of the creek.</p>

<p>"This was yesterday," added Marlow, lolling in the arm-chair
lazily.  "I haven't heard yet; but I expect to hear any moment
. . .  What on earth are you grinning at in this sarcastic manner? 
I am not afraid of going to church with a friend.  Hang it all,
for all my belief in Chance I am not exactly a pagan . . . "</p>
