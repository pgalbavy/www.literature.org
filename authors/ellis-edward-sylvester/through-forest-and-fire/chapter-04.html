<p>It was two miles from the home of Mr. Ribsam to the little stone
school-house where his children were receiving their education.
A short distance from the dwelling a branch road turned off to
the left, which, being followed nine miles or so, mostly through
woods, brought one to the little country town of Dunbarton.</p>

<p>Between the home of Gustav Ribsam and the school-house were only
two dwellings. The first, on the left, belonged to Mr. Marston,
whose land adjoined that of the Hollander, while the second was
beyond the fork of the roads and was owned by Mr. Kilgore, who
lived a long distance back from the highway.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam, as he grew in years and strength, became more valuable
to his father, who found it necessary, now and then, to keep him
home from school. This, however, did not happen frequently, for
the parents were anxious that their children should receive a
good school education, and Nick's readiness enabled him to recover,
very quickly, the ground thus lost.</p>

<p>There was not so much need of Nellie, and, when at the age of
six she began her attendance, she rarely missed a day. If it was
stormy she was bundled up warmly, and, occasionally, she was taken
in the carriage when the weather was too severe for walking.</p>

<p>The summer was gone when Nick helped harness the roan mare to
the carriage, and, driving down to the forks, let Nellie out,
and kept on toward Dunbarton, while the little girl continued
ahead in the direction of the school-house.</p>

<p>"I've got to stay there so long," said Nick, in bidding his sister
good-by, "that I won't be here much before four o'clock, so I
will look out for you and you can look out for me and I'll take
you home."</p>

<p>Nellie said she would not forget, and walked cheerfully up the
road, singing a school song to herself.</p>

<p>The little girl, when early enough, stopped at the house of Mr.
Marston, whose girl Lizzie attended school. This morning, however,
when Nick called from the road, he was told that Lizzie had been
gone some time, so he drove on without her.</p>

<p>The dwelling of Mr. Kilgore stood so far back that Nellie never
could spare the time to walk up the long lane and back again,
but she contented herself with peering up the tree-lined avenue
in quest of Sallie and Bobby Kilgore.</p>

<p>However, they were also invisible, and so it was that Nellie
made the rest of the journey alone.</p>

<p>The distance being so considerable, Nellie and Nick always carried
their dinners with them, so that, after their departure in the
morning, the parents did not expect to see them again until between
four and five in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The roan mare was young and spirited, but not vicious, and the
boy had no trouble in controlling her.</p>

<p>When half way through the stretch of woods they crossed a bridge,
whose planks rattled so loudly under the wheels and hoofs that
the animal showed a disposition to rear and plunge over the narrow
railing at the side.</p>

<p>But the boy used his whip so vigorously that he quickly tamed
the beast, which was not slow to understand that her master was
holding the reins.</p>

<p>When Nick was on such journeys as these, he generally carried
his father's watch, so as to "make his connections" better. The
timepiece was of great size and thickness, having been made somewhere
in England a good many years before. It ticked so loudly that
it sounded like a cricket, and would have betrayed any person
in an ordinary sized room, when there was no unusual noise. Nick's
own handsome watch was too valuable for him to carry.</p>

<p>The former was so heavy that it seemed to Nick, when walking
with it, that he went in a one-sided fashion. However, the lad
was quite proud of it, and perhaps took it out oftener than was
necessary, especially when he saw the eyes of others upon him.</p>

<p>Nick was kept in Dunbarton so long by the many errands he had
to perform, that he was fully an hour late in starting. The mare
was spirited enough to make up this time, if urged, but there
was no need of doing so, and the boy knew his father would prefer
him not to push the animal when no urgency existed.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that when Nick re-entered the main highway
that afternoon, and looked in the direction of the school-house,
he saw nothing of Nellie, nor indeed of any one coming from the
school.</p>

<p>"She has gone home long ago," was his conclusion, as he allowed
the mare to drop into a brisk trot, which speedily took him to
his house.</p>

<p>When Nick had put away the horse and rendered up his account
of the errands done, he was surprised to learn that Nellie had
not yet appeared.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand what keeps her," said the father, in his
native tongue; "she was never so late before."</p>

<p>It was plain from the mother's face and manner that she also
was anxious, for she frequently went to the gate, and, shading
her eyes, looked long and anxiously down the road, hoping that
the figure of the little girl would come to view, with some explanation
of the cause for her delay.</p>

<p>But the sun was low in the west, and its slanting rays brought
to light the figure of no child hurrying homeward. The single
object that was mistaken for the loved one proved to be a man
on horseback, who turned off at the forks and vanished.</p>

<p>"Nick, go look for your sister," said his mother, as she came
back from one of these visits to the gate; "something has happened."</p>

<p>The boy was glad of the order, for he was on the point of asking
permission to hunt for Nellie.</p>

<p>"I'll stay till I find out something," said Nick, as he donned
his hat and took a general look over himself to see that he was
in shape, "so don't worry about <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"But you ought not to be gone so long," said the father, whose
anxious face showed that he was debating whether he should not
join his boy in the search, "for it won't take long to find out
where Nellie is."</p>

<p>"I think she has been taken sick and has stopped with some of
the neighbors," ventured the mother, "but it is strange they do
not send me word."</p>

<p>And it was the very fact that such word was not sent that prevented
the husband and son from believing in the theory of the distressed
mother.</p>

<p>But Nick did not let the grass grow under his feet. His worriment
was as great as that of his parents, and as soon as he was in
the road he broke into a trot, which he kept up until beyond sight,
both father and mother standing at the gate and watching him until
he faded from view in the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>The point where he disappeared was beyond the house of Mr. Marston,
so it was safe to conclude he had learned nothing of his sister
there, where he was seen to halt.</p>

<p>There is nothing more wearisome than waiting in such suspense
as came to the hearts of the father and mother, while they sat
watching and listening for the sound of the childish footsteps
and voices whose music would have been the sweetest on earth to
them.</p>

<p>The supper on the table remained untasted, and the only sounds
heard were the solemn ticking of the old clock, the soft rustling
of the kettle on the stove, and now and then a long drawn sigh
from father or mother, as one strove to utter a comforting word
to the other.</p>

<p>All at once the gate was opened and shut hastily. Then a hurried
step sounded along the short walk and upon the porch.</p>

<p>"There they are! there they are!" exclaimed the mother, starting
to her feet, as did the father.</p>

<p>Almost on the same instant the door was thrown open, and, panting
and excited, Nick Ribsam entered.</p>

<p>But he was alone, and the expression of his face showed that
he had brought bad news.</p>
