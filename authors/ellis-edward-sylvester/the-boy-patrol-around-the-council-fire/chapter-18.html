<p>It may be said that Zip had become the hero of the Boy Scout
camp on Gosling Lake. He belonged to the finest breed of bloodhounds
in the world and had given an illustration of that gift of his
species which approaches the miraculous. The stories told by his
master of his other exploits, and of what had been done by his
kind on Long Island and elsewhere, were absorbingly interesting.
As young Burton remarked, his study of this canine species had
given him more knowledge than could have been the case otherwise,
and he naturally did most of the talking on that cool August night
in front of the bungalow. The bloodhound is one of the most dignified
of dogs, and resents anything in the nature of familiarity by
strangers. Alvin, Chester, Mike and several others tried to make
friends with Zip, but he showed them plainly that he preferred
to be left to himself.</p>

<p>"Ef it was meself that was as partic’lar as him to selict me
associates," said Mike, "I should faal mighty lonely, as Jim O’Toole
remarked after he had been lost for six weeks in the woods. I’ll
remimber yer coolness, Zip," he added, shaking his finger at the
dog nestling at the feet of Burton, "and to-morrer ye’ll faal
so ashamed, after ye try to match wits wid me, that ye’ll resign
as a bloodhound and become a poodle dog for the rist of yer days."</p>

<p>"Don’t boast too soon," said the guest; "I’ll put my stake on
Zip every time."</p>

<p>"And so will I," added Alvin; "if Mike was half as smart as he
thinks he is, we should all be fools compared with him."</p>

<p>"<em>Some</em> folks don’t naad the comparisin to show they’re
lacking in the first ilimints of sense," retorted the Irish youth
with fine sarcasm.</p>

<p>It was quite late when the boys retired for the night. No one
would have objected to the presence of Zip in the bungalow, but
his master preferred that he should spend the night outdoors,
and he was waiting there the next morning when Burton, the first
to arise, came out to have a romp with him before breakfast.</p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock that the whole party of Boy Scouts
including their guest gathered on the front porch, eagerly interested
in the test that was to be made of the skill of Zip the bloodhound
in following a scent. Every one was on the <em>qui vive</em>,
for the novelty of the proceeding appealed to them.</p>

<p>The arrangements, simple of themselves, had been made while the
party was at breakfast. Three trials were to take place, involving
that number of Boy Scouts. Each was to plunge into the woods and
use every device possible to hide his trail from the dog, which
was to take up his task an hour after the fugitive, as he may
be called, left the bungalow.</p>

<p>The first runner was the diminutive Isaac Rothstein, the second,
the tall, long-limbed Hoke Butler, and the third Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>"There is only one condition," said young Burton, when everything
was ready; "you must not make any use of the lake. Zip can track
you only to the edge."</p>

<p>"The lake is the only water shut out?" remarked Hoke Butler inquiringly.
The guest hesitated a moment, suspecting some intended trick by
the questioner.</p>

<p>"That is all."</p>

<p>"How about the Sheepscot River?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"If an hour’s start will enable you to reach that stream ahead
of Zip, you win."</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall turned to Isaac, who was standing in the middle
of the group on the porch. The bright-eyed youth nodded.</p>

<p>Burton spoke to the hound which, knowing what was expected of
him, came forward and sniffed around the Boy Scout’s feet and
ankles. He did this for only two or three seconds, when he backed
off and took his place beside his master.</p>

<p>"That means he is ready if you are."</p>

<p>"I am to have an hour’s start?"</p>

<p>"More if you wish it."</p>

<p>"That’s enough, and you are sure he will not attack me?"</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that, but I suggest that you do not tempt him."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked young Rothstein.</p>

<p>"Don’t tackle <em>him</em> first; and when he comes up with you,
as he is sure to do, stop running. The Belgian dogs have a trick
of dodging between the legs of a fugitive and tripping him, but
the bloodhound prefers to drag him down."</p>

<p>"In other words," said Mike, "whin the dog gits ye down, and
has his paws on yer breast, and is hunting out the best place
to begin his feast, h’ist the flag of truce."</p>

<p>Isaac, accompanied by Scout Master Hall and several of the boys,
passed into the bungalow, closing the door behind them, and went
out of the rear door which was also shut. The dog remained on
the front porch with his master and the other scouts, each party
out of sight of the other. A few minutes later, Isaac’s friends
rejoined their comrades, Burton and several of the Scouts glancing
at their watches to note the time. Zip lay at his owner’s feet,
with his nose between his paws, as if intending to pass the interval
in sleep.</p>

<p>Before starting, Isaac was asked to explain his plan. He replied
that it was merely to do everything he could to puzzle his pursuer,
and he was confident of succeeding. It was useless to make any
effort at the start, and he walked away at his ordinary pace,
quickly disappearing among the trees.</p>

<p>The moment, however, he was out of sight he began the precautions
he had decided upon before starting. He turned at right angles,
walked rapidly for a hundred yards, then changed again to the
same extent. Since the shift each time was to the right, this
made an exact reversal of the course upon which he set out, and
being kept for a little while took him back to the bungalow, a
rod or two from his starting point. No one saw him, since every
one was at the front. Thus he made a second get away, which delayed
him for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Isaac chuckled, for he was sure he had played a cute trick upon
the dog, which he believed would be puzzled thereby, and yet you
and I can readily see that there was "nothing in it" at all.</p>

<p>Again the youth dived in among the trees, or broke into a rapid
run, going straightaway, but taking as long steps as he could.
Then he zig-zagged, first to the right and left, describing irregular
circles which assuredly would have led him astray had he not caught
glimpses of the lake now and then, and thus knew the course he
was following, which in the main was toward the cabin of Uncle
Elk.</p>

<p>He kept note of the time, and just before the hour expired made
a long sweeping curve to the right, which brought him back to
the opposite end of the bungalow from his starting point.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he called as he bounded up the steps among his friends;
"where’s Zip?"</p>

<p>"On your trail," replied his owner.</p>

<p>"Don’t be too sure of that; I’ve given him the task of his life."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly the easiest one; now that you have returned," said
Burton, "you may as well tell us everything you did."</p>

<p>Isaac described his course from the first,—how he had actually
started twice, often shifting and finally making a big curve,
still marked by abrupt changes that were sure to baffle the keenest
nosed bloodhound that ever tracked a fugitive into the depths
of the Everglades.</p>

<p>"You couldn’t have given Zip an easier task," said Burton; "when
he left here a short time ago he circled about the clubhouse,
and in three minutes at the most took your scent."</p>

<p>"But didn’t the two trails puzzle him?" asked the astonished
Isaac.</p>

<p>"There was a difference of a few minutes in their making and
he took the freshest."</p>

<p>This sounded so incredible that the guest qualified his assertion.</p>

<p>"Even if he accepted the older scent, it led him straight to
the second. All your circlings and doublings availed you nothing;
you never perplexed him for more than an instant."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?"</p>

<p>"There’s your answer."</p>

<p>Burton nodded toward the steps up which Isaac Rothstein had come
some time before. There was Zip, who without baying or making
any kind of outcry, galloped over the porch and directly to where
the astounded lad was sitting. Stepping a pace or two away, he
looked up at the youth and then walked over to his master and
sat down beside his chair.</p>

<p>"You can translate his remarks," said the latter. "Words could
not be plainer: ‘There’s the young man who thought he could fool
me, but never was he more mistaken.’"</p>

<p>Isaac joined in the clapping of hands. Zip preserved his dignity
and paid no heed to strangers. All he cared for was the good opinion
of his master and he knew he had that.</p>

<p>"Next!" called Burton, and the tall, stoop-shouldered Hoke Butler
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I don’t want any help," he remarked with a wink toward Isaac
Rothstein, as Zip sniffed about his feet; "stay right where you
are. Mr. Burton, a half hour start will be enough for me."</p>

<p>"As you please, but you may have two hours if you wish."</p>

<p>"And we’ll save our bouquets till Zip throws up the sponge,"
said Mike, "or rather until I tries me hand with the intilligint
canine."</p>

<p>Instead of leaving the bungalow from the rear, Hoke walked deliberately
down the eastern steps, and sauntered off where he was in plain
sight of all until he entered the wood which approached to within
a few rods of the lake. He had given no one a hint of the scheme
he had in mind, but the feeling was general that whatever its
nature it was original, and more than one-half suspected he might
outwit the remarkable dog. In this list we must not include George
Burton.</p>

<p>Now Hoke had learned that it was useless to try to throw Zip
off the scent by any such artifices as young Rothstein had used.
As the guest declared, the tracker had not bothered the dog to
the slightest extent. It therefore would be folly for the second
fugitive to repeat the experiment. He had no thought of doing
so.</p>

<p>Mention has been made in the preceding pages of a brook which
ran near the home of Uncle Elk. After a devious course this emptied
into Gosling Lake at a point about halfway between the cabin and
the bungalow. Hoke rested his hopes upon this little stream.</p>

<p>"Burton barred the lake," chuckled the youth, "but he didn’t
say anything of this stream, though I was awfully afraid he would.
I guess he doesn’t know about it,—yes, he does, too, for he had
to cross it on his way to the bungalow, but he forgot it. He can’t
kick when he finds I have made his dog sing small."</p>

<p>Allured by the single purpose, Hoke pushed straight on, turning
neither to the right nor left. Recalling that he had shortened
the time Zip was to wait, he broke into a lope. His build made
him the fleetest runner in camp, and it did not take him long
to reach the stream. He had crossed it so many times that the
lower portion was familiar, and he turned as if to follow it to
its source in the spring near Uncle Elk’s cabin.</p>

<p>He found it of varying width. It was so narrow where a regular
path had been made by the passing back and forth of the hermit
and his friends, that nothing in the nature of a bridge was used.
A long step or a moderate jump served.</p>

<p>Nowhere did the depth seem to be more than a few inches, except
where a pool or eddy occasionally appeared; but as Hoke Butler
picked his way along the bank, he was pleased to note here and
there a considerable expansion.</p>

<p>"That’s good!" he said to himself; "it will make it all the harder
for that dog."</p>

<p>He now put his scheme into operation. Without removing his shoes,
he stepped into the brook, sinking halfway to his knees, and began
walking up the bed of the stream. The water was as cold as ice,
and he gasped at first, but became quickly accustomed to it. The
bottom was so irregular that he progressed slowly, and more than
once narrowly escaped falling. Here and there boulders protruded
from the shore and he steadied himself by resting a hand upon
them as he labored past. Those that rose from the bed of the stream
itself and around which the current foamed, afforded convenient
stepping stones and were turned to such use.</p>

<p>"Of course that wouldn’t do on land," he reflected, "for the
dog would catch the scent, but he can’t know I’m in the water,
and will be hunting elsewhere for my trail. He’ll be the most
beautifully fooled dog in Maine." </p>
