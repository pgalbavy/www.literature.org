<p>Seraphina and I moved towards the door sadly, as if under the
oppression of a memory, as people go back from the side of a grave
to the cares of life. No exultation possessed me. Nothing had
happened. It had been a sick man's whim.</p>

<p>"Señorita," I said low, with my hand on the wrought bronze of
the door-handle, "Don Carlos might have died in full trust of
my devotion to you&mdash;without this."</p>

<p>"I know it," she answered, hanging her head.</p>

<p>"It was his wish," I said. "And I deferred."</p>

<p>"It was his wish," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Remember he had asked you for no promise."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is you only he has asked. You have remembered it very
well, Señor. And you&mdash;you ask for nothing."</p>

<p>"No," I said; "neither from your heart nor from your conscience&mdash;nor
from your gratitude. Gratitude from you! As if it were not I that
owe you gratitude for having condescended to stand with your hand
in mine&mdash;if only for a moment&mdash;if only to bring peace to a dying
man; for giving me the felicity, the illusion of this wonderful
instant, that, all my life, I shall remember as those who are
suddenly stricken blind remember the great glory of the sun. I
shall live with it, I shall cherish it in my heart to my dying
day; and I promise never to mention it to you again."</p>

<p>Her lips were slightly parted, her eyes remained downcast, her
head drooped as if in extreme attention.</p>

<p>"I asked for no promise," she murmured coldly.</p>

<p>My heart was heavy. "Thank you for that proof of your confidence,"
I said. "I am yours without any promises. Wholly yours. But what
can I offer? What help? What refuge? What protection? What can
I do? I can only die for you. Ah, but this was cruel of Carlos,
when he knew that I had nothing else but my poor life to give."</p>

<p>"I accept that," she said unexpectedly. "Señorita, it is generous
of you to accept so worthless a gift&mdash;a life I value not at all
save for one unique memory which I owe to you."</p>

<p>I knew she was looking at me while I swung open the door with
a low bow. I did not trust myself to look at her. An unreasonable
disenchantment, like the awakening from a happy dream, oppressed
me. I felt an almost angry desire to seize her in my arms&mdash;to
go back to my dream. If I had looked at her then, I believed I
could not have controlled myself.</p>

<p>She passed out; and when I looked up there was O'Brien booted
and spurred, but otherwise in his lawyer's black, inclining his
dapper figure profoundly before her in the dim gallery. She had
stopped short. The two maids, huddled together behind her, stared
with terrified eyes. The flames of their candles vacillated very
much.</p>

<p>I closed the door quietly. Carlos was done with the earth. This
had become my affair; and the necessity of coming to an immediate
decision almost deprived me of my power of thinking. The necessity
had arisen too swiftly; the arrival of that man acted like the
sudden apparition of a phantom. It had been expected, however;
only, from the moment we had turned away from Carlos' bedside,
we had thought of nothing but ourselves; we had dwelt alone in
our emotions, as if there had been no inhabitant of flesh and
blood on the earth but we two. Our danger had been present, no
doubt, in our minds, because we drew it in with every breath.
It was the indispensable condition of our contact, of our words,
of our thoughts; it was the atmosphere of our feelings; a something
as all-pervading and impalpable as the air we drew into our lungs.
And suddenly this danger, this breath of our life, had taken this
material form. It was material and expected, and yet it had the
effect of an evil spectre, inasmuch as one did not know where
and how it was vulnerable, what precisely it would do, how one
should defend one's self.</p>

<p>His bow was courtly; his gravity was all in his bearing, which
was quiet and confident: the manner of a capable man, the sort
of man the great of this earth find invaluable and are inclined
to trust. His full-shaven face had a good-natured, almost a good-humored
expression, which I have come to think must have depended on the
cast of his features, on the setting of his eyes&mdash;on some peculiarity
not under his control, or else he could not have preserved it
so well. On certain occasions, as this one, for instance, it affected
me as a refinement of cynicism; and, generally, it was startling,
like the assumption of a mask inappropriate to the action and
the speeches of the part.</p>

<p>He had journeyed in his customary manner overland from Havana,
arriving unexpectedly at night, as he had often done before; only
this time he had found the little door, cut out in one of the
sides of the big gate, bolted fast. It was his knocking I had
heard, as I hurried after the priest. The major-domo, who had
been called up to let him in, told me afterwards that the senor
intendente had put no question whatever to him as to this, and
had gone on, as usual, towards his own room. Nobody knew what
was going on in Carlos' chamber, but, of course, he came upon
the two girls at the door. He said nothing to them either, only
just stopped there and waited, leaning with one elbow on the balustrade
with his good-tempered, gray eyes fixed on the door. He had fully
expected to see Seraphina come out presently, but I think he did
not count on seeing me as well. When he straightened himself up
after the bow, we two were standing side by side.</p>

<p>I had stepped quickly towards her, asking myself what he would
do. He did not seem to be armed; neither had I any weapon about
me. Would he fly at my throat? I was the bigger, and the younger
man. I wished he would. But he found a way of making me feel all
his other advantages. He did not recognize my existence. He appeared
not to see me at all. He seemed not to be aware of Seraphina's
startled immobility, of my firm attitude; but turning his good-humoured
face towards the two girls, who appeared ready to sink through
the floor before his gaze, he shook his fore-finger at them slightly.</p>

<p>This was all. He was not menacing; he was almost playful; and
this gesture, marvellous in its economy of effort, disclosed all
the might and insolence of his power. It had the unerring efficacy
of an act of instinct. It was instinct. He could not know how
he dismayed us by that shake of the finger. The tall girl dropped
her candlestick with a clatter, and fled along the gallery like
a shadow. La Chica cowered under the wall. The light of her candle
just touched dimly the form of a negro boy, waiting passively
in the background with O'Brien's saddle-bags over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You see," said Seraphina to me, in a swift, desolate murmur.
"They are all like this&mdash;all, all."</p>

<p>Without a change of countenance, without emphasis, he said to
her in French:</p>

<p>"<em>Votre père dort sans doute, Señorita</em>."</p>

<p>And she intrepidly replied, "You know very well, Señor Intendente,
that nothing can make him open his eyes."</p>

<p>"So it seems," he muttered between his teeth, stooping to pick
up the dropped candlestick. It was lying at my feet. I could have
taken him at a disadvantage, then; I could have felled him with
one blow, thrown myself upon his back. Thus may an athletic prisoner
set upon a jailer coming into his cell, if there were not the
prison, the locks, the bars, the heavy gates! the walls, all the
apparatus of captivity, and the superior weight of the idea chaining
down the will, if not the courage.</p>

<p>It might have been his knowledge of this, or his absolute disdain
of me. The unconcerned manner in which he busied himself&mdash;his
head within striking distance of my fist&mdash;in lighting the extinguished
candle from the trembling Chica's humiliated me beyond expression.
He had some difficulty with that, till he said to her just audibly,
"Calm thyself, niña," and she became rigid in her appearance of
excessive terror.</p>

<p>He turned then towards Seraphina, candlestick in hand, courteously
saying in Spanish:</p>

<p>"May I be allowed to help light you to your door, since that
silly Juanita &mdash;I think it was Juanita&mdash;has taken leave of
her senses? She is not fit to remain in your service&mdash;any more
than this one here."</p>

<p>With a gasp of desolation, La Chica began to sob limply against
the wall. I made one step forward; and, holding the candle well
up, as though for the purpose of examining my face carefully,
he never looked my way, while he and Seraphina were exchanging
a few phrases in French which I did not understand well enough
to fellow.</p>

<p>He was politely interrogatory, it seemed to me. The natural,
good-humoured expression never left his face, as though he had
a fund of inexhaustible patience for dealing with the unaccountable
trifles of a woman's conduct. Seraphina's shawl had slipped off
her head. La Chica sidled towards her, sobbing a deep sob now
and then, without any sign of tears; and with their scattered
hair, their bare arms, the disorder of their attire, they looked
like two women discovered in a secret flight for life. Only the
mistress stood her ground firmly; her voice was decided; there
was resolution in the way one little white hand clutched the black
lace on her bosom. Only once she seemed to hesitate in her replies.
Then, after a pause he gave her for reflection, he appeared to
repeat his question. She glanced at me apprehensively, as I thought,
before she confirmed the previous answer by a slow inclination
of her head.</p>

<p>Had he allowed himself to make a provoking movement, a dubious
gesture of any sort, I would have flung myself upon him at once;
but the nonchalant manner in which he looked away, while he extended
to me his hand with the candlestick, amazed me. I simply took
it from him. He stepped back, with a ceremonious bow for Seraphina.
La Chica ran up close to her elbow. I heard her voice saying sadly,
"You need fear nothing for yourself, child"; and they moved away
slowly. I remained facing O'Brien, with a vague notion of protecting
their retreat.</p>

<p>This time it was I who was holding the light before his face.
It was calm and colourless; his eyes were fixed on the ground
reflectively, with the appearance of profound and quiet absorption.
But suddenly I perceived the convulsive clutch of his hand on
the skirt of his coat. It was as if accidentally I had looked
inside the man&mdash;upon the strength of his illusions, on his desire,
on his passion. Now he will fly at me, I thought, with a tremendously
convincing certitude. Now&mdash;-&mdash;All my muscles, stiffening,
answered the appeal of that thought of battle.</p>

<p>He said, "Won't you give me that light?"</p>

<p>And I understood he demanded a surrender.</p>

<p>"I would see you die first where you stand," was my answer.</p>

<p>This object in my hand had become endowed with moral meaning&mdash;significant,
like a symbol&mdash;only to be torn from me with my life.</p>

<p>He lifted his head; the light twinkled in his eyes. "Oh, <em>I</em>
won't die,"  he said, with that bizarre suggestion of humour in
his face, in his subdued voice. "But it is a small thing; and
you are young; it may be yet worth your while to try and please
me&mdash;this time."</p>

<p>Before I could answer, Seraphina, from some little distance,
called out hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Don Juan, your arm."</p>

<p>Her voice, sounding a little unsteady, made me forget O'Brien,
and, turning my back on him, I ran up to her. She needed my support;
and before us La Chica tottered and stumbled along with the lights,
moaning:</p>

<p>"<em>Madré de Dios!</em> What will become of us now! Oh, what
will become of us now!"</p>

<p>"You know what he had asked me to let him do," Seraphina talked
rapidly. "I made answer, 'No; give the light to my cousin.' Then
he said, 'Do you really wish it, Señorita? I am the older friend.'
I repeated, 'Give the light to my cousin, Señor.' He, then, cruelly,
'For the young man's own sake, reflect, Señorita.' And he waited
before he asked me again, 'Shall I surrender it to him?' I felt
death upon my heart, and all my fear for you&mdash;there." She touched
her beautiful throat with a swift movement of a hand that disappeared
at once under the lace. "And because I could not speak, <em>I<hr></em>Don
Juan, you have just offered me your life &mdash;<em>I<hr></em><em>Misericordia!</em>
What else was possible? I made with my head the sign 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>In the stress, hurry, and rapture encompassing my immense gratitude,
I pressed her hand to my side familiarly, as if we had been two
lovers walking in a lane on a serene evening.</p>

<p>"If you had not made that sign, it would have been worse than
death&mdash;in my heart," I said. "He had allied me, too, to renounce
my trust, my light."</p>

<p>We walked on slowly, accompanied in our sudden silence by the
plash of the fountain at the bottom of the great square of darkness
on our left, and by the piteous moans of La Chica.</p>

<p>"That is what he meant," said the enchanting voice by my side.
"And you refused. That is your valour."</p>

<p>"From no selfish motives," I said, troubled, as if all the great
incertitude of my mind had been awakened by the sound that brought
so much delight to my heart. "My valour is nothing."</p>

<p>"It has given me a new courage," she said.</p>

<p>"You did not want more," I said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Ah! I was very much alone. It is difficult to<hr>"</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"To live alone," I finished.</p>

<p>"More so to die," she whispered, with a new note of timidity.
"It is frightful. Be cautious, Don Juan, for the love of God,
because I could not<hr>"</p>

<p>We stopped. La Chica, silent, as if exhausted, drooped lamentably,
with her shoulder against the wall, by Seraphina's door; and the
pure crystalline sound of the fountain below, enveloping the parting
pause, seemed to wind its coldness round my heart.</p>

<p>"Poor Don Carlos!" she said. "I had a great affection for him.
I was afraid they would want me to marry him. He loved your sister."</p>

<p>"He never told her," I murmured. "I wonder if she ever guessed."</p>

<p>"He was poor, homeless, ill already, in a foreign land."</p>

<p>"We all loved him at home," I said.</p>

<p>"He never asked her," she breathed out. "And, perhaps&mdash;but he
never asked her."</p>

<p>"I have no more force," sighed La Chica, suddenly, and sank down
at the foot of the wall, putting the candlesticks on the floor.</p>

<p>"You have been very good to him," I said; "only he need not have
demanded this from you. Of course, I understood perfectly....
I hope you understand, too, that I<hr>"</p>

<p>"Señor, my cousin," she flashed out suddenly, "do you think that
I would have consented only from my affection for him?"</p>

<p>"Señorita," I cried, "I am poor, homeless, in a foreign land.
How can I believe? How can I dare to dream?&mdash;unless your own voice<hr>"</p>

<p>"Then you are permitted to ask. Ask, Don Juan."</p>

<p>I dropped on one knee, and, suddenly extending her arm, she pressed
her hand to my lips. Lighted up from below, the picturesque aspect
of her figure took on something of a transcendental grace; the
unusual upward shadows invested her beauty with a new mystery
of fascination. A minute passed. I could hear her rapid breathing
above, and I stood up before her, holding both her hands.</p>

<p>"How very few days have we been together," she whispered. "Juan,
I am ashamed."</p>

<p>"I did not count the days. I have known you always. I have dreamed
of you since I can remember&mdash;for days, for months, a year, all
my life."</p>

<p>The crash of a heavy door flung to, exploded, filling the galleries
all round the <em>patio</em> with the sonorous reminder of our
peril.</p>

<p>"Ah! We had forgotten."</p>

<p>I heard her voice, and felt her form in my arms. Her lips at
my ear pronounced:</p>

<p>"Remember, Juan. Two lives, but one death only."</p>

<p>And she was gone so quickly that it was as though she had passed
through the wood of the massive panels.</p>

<p>La Chica crouched on her knees. The lights on the floor burned
before her empty stare, and with her bare shoulders the tone of
old ivory emerging from the white linen, with wisps of raven hair
hanging down her cheeks, the abandonment of her whole person embodied
every outward mark and line of desolation.</p>

<p>"What do you fear from him?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked up; moved nearer to me on her knees. "I have a lover
outside."</p>

<p>She seized her hair wildly, drew it across her face, tried to
stuff handfuls of it into her mouth, as if to stop herself from
shrieking.</p>

<p>"He shook his finger at me," she moaned.</p>

<p>Her terror, as incomprehensible as the emotion of an animal,
was gaining upon me. I said sternly:</p>

<p>"What can he do, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>She did not know. She was like me. She feared for her love. Like
myself! Was there anything in the way of our undoing which it
was not in his power to achieve?</p>

<p>"Try to be faithful to your mistress," I said, "and all may be
well yet."</p>

<p>She made no answer, but staggered to her feet, and went away
blindly through the door, which opened just wide enough to let
her through. There were clouds on the sky. The <em>patio</em>,
in its blackness, was like the rectangular mouth of a bottomless
pit. I picked up the candlesticks, and lighted myself to my room,
walking upon air, upon tempestuous air, in a feeling of insecurity
and exultation.</p>

<p>The lights of my candelabrum had gone out. I stood the two candlesticks
on a table, and the shadows of the room, uplifted above the two
flames as high as the ceiling, filled the corners heavily like
gathered draperies, descended to the foot of the four walls in
the shape of a military tent, in which warlike objects vaguely
gleamed: a trophy of ancient arquebuses and conquering swords,
arranged with bows, spears, the stick and stone weapons of an
extinct race, a war collar of shells or pebbles, a round wicker-work
shield in a halo of arrows, with a matchlock piece on each side&mdash;of
the sort that had to be served by two men.</p>

<p>I had left the door of my room open on purpose, so that he should
know I was back there, and ready for him. I took down a long straight
blade, like a rapier, with a basket hilt. It was a cumbrous weapon,
and with a blunt edge; still, it had a point, and I was ready
to thrust and parry against the world. I called upon my foes.
No enemy appeared, and by the light of two candles, with a sword
in my hand, I lost myself in the foreshadowings of the future.</p>

<p>It was positive and uncertain. I wandered in it like a soul outside
the gates of paradise, with an anticipation of bliss, and the
pain of my exclusion. There was only one man in the way. I was
certain he had been watching us across the blackness of the <em>patio</em>.
He must have seen the dimly-lit dumb show of our parting at Sera-phina's
door. I hoped he had understood, and that my shadow, bearing the
two lights, had struck him as triumphant and undismayed, walking
upon air. I strained my ears. I had heard....</p>

<p>Somebody was coming towards me along the silent galleries. It
was he; I knew it. He was coming nearer and nearer. In the profound,
tomb-like stillness of the great house, I had heard the sound
of his footsteps on the tessellated pavement from afar. Now he
had turned the corner, and the calm, strolling pace of his approach
was enough to strike awe into an adversary's heart. It never hesitated,
not once; never hurried; never slowed till it stopped. He stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p>I suppose, in that big room, by the light of two candles, I must
have presented an impressive picture of a menacing youth all in
black, with a tense face, and holding a naked, long rapier in
his hand. At any rate, he stood still, eyeing me from the doorway,
the picture of a dapper Spanish lawyer in a lofty frame; all in
black, also, with a fair head and a well-turned leg advanced in
a black silk stocking. He had taken off his riding boots. For
the rest, I had never seen him dressed otherwise. There was no
weapon in his hand, or at his side.</p>

<p>I lowered the point, and, seeing he remained on the doorstep,
as if not willing to trust himself within, I said disdainfully:</p>

<p>"You don't suppose I would murder a defenceless man."</p>

<p>"Am I defenceless?" He had a slight lift of the eyebrows. "That
is news, indeed. It is you who are supposing. I have been a very
certain man for this many a year."</p>

<p>"How can you know how an English gentleman would feel and act?
I am neither a murderer nor yet an intriguer."</p>

<p>He walked right in rapidly, and, getting round to the other side
of the table, drew a small pistol out of his breeches pocket.</p>

<p>"You see &mdash;I am not trusting too much to your English generosity."</p>

<p>He laid the pistol negligently on the table. I had turned about
on my heels. As we stood, by lunging between the two candlesticks,
I should have been able to run him through the body before he
could cry out.</p>

<p>I laid the sword on the table.</p>

<p>"Would you trust a damned Irish rebel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You are wrong in your surmise. I would have nothing to do with
a rebel, even in my thoughts and suppositions. I think that the
Intendente of Don Balthasar Riego would look twice before murdering
in a bedroom the guest of the house&mdash;a relation, a friend of the
family."</p>

<p>"That's sensible," he said, with that unalterable air of good
nature, which sometimes was like the most cruel mockery of humour.
"And do you think that even a relation of the Riegos would escape
the scaffold for killing Don Patricio O'Brien, one of the Royal
Judges of the Marine Court, member of the Council, Procurator
to the Chapter...."</p>

<p>"Intendente of the Casa," I threw in.</p>

<p>"That's my gratitude," he said gravely. "So you see...."</p>

<p>"Supreme chief of thieves and picaroons," I suggested again.</p>

<p>He answered this by a gesture of disdainful superiority.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you&mdash;-if any of you English&mdash;would have the courage
to risk your all&mdash;ambition, pride, position, wealth, peace of
mind, your dearest hope, your self-respect&mdash;like this. For an
idea."</p>

<p>His tone, that revealed something exalted and sad behind everything
that was sordid and base in the acts of that man's villainous
tools, struck me with astonishment. I beheld, as an inseparable
whole, the contemptible result, the childishness of his imagination,
the danger of his recklessness, and something like loftiness in
his pitiful illusion.</p>

<p>"Nothing's too hot, too dirty, too heavy. Any way to get at you
English; any means. To strike! That's the thing. I would die happy
if I knew I had helped to detach from you one island&mdash;one little
island of all the earth you have filched away, stolen, taken by
force, got by lying.... Don't taunt me with your taunts of thieves.
What weapons better worthy of you could I use? Oh, I am modest.
I am modest. This is a little thing, this Jamaica. What do I care
for the Separationist blatherskite more than for the loyal fools?
You are all English to me. If I had my way, your Empire would
die of pin-pricks all over its big, overgrown body. Let only one
bit drop off. If robbing your ships may help it, then, as you
see me standing here, I am ready to go myself in a leaky boat.
I tell you Jamaica's gone. And that may be the beginning of the
end."</p>

<p>He lifted his arm not at me, but at England, if I may judge from
his burning stare. It was not to me he was speaking. There we
were, Irish and English, face to face, as it had been ever since
we had met in the narrow way of the world that had never been
big enough for the tribes, the nations, the races of man.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. O'Brien, I don't know what you may do to me, but I
won't listen to any of this," I said, very red in the face.</p>

<p>"Who wants you to listen?" he muttered absently, and went away
from the table to look out of the loophole, leaving me there with
the sword and the pistol.</p>

<p>Whatever he might have said of the scaffold, this was very imprudent
of him. It was characteristic of the man&mdash;of that impulsiveness
which existed in him side by side with his sagacity, with his
coolness in intrigue, with his unmerciful and revengeful temper.
By my own feelings I understood what an imprudence it was. But
he was turning his back on me, and how could I?... His imprudence
was so complete that it made for security. He did not, I am sure,
remember my existence. I would just as soon have jumped with a
dagger upon a man in the dark.</p>

<p>He was really stirred to his depths&mdash;to the depths of his hate,
and of his love&mdash;by seeing me, an insignificant youth (I was no
more), surge up suddenly in his path. He turned where he stood
at last, and contemplated me with a sort of thoughtful surprise,
as though he had tried to account to himself for my existence.</p>

<p>"No," he said, to himself really, "I wonder when I look at you.
How did you manage to get that pretty reputation over there? Ramon's
a fool. He shall know it to his cost. But the craftiness of that
Carlos! Or is it only my confounded willingness to believe?"</p>

<p>He was putting his finger nearly on the very spot. I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "when it's all boiled down, you are only
an English beggar boy."</p>

<p>"I've come to a man's estate since we met last," I said meaningly.</p>

<p>He seemed to meditate over this. His face never changed, except,
perhaps, to an even more amused benignity of expression.</p>

<p>"You have lived very fast by that account," he remarked artlessly.
"Is it possible now? Well, life, as you know, can't last forever;
and, indeed, taking a better look at you in this poor light, you
do seem to be very near death."</p>

<p>I did not flinch; and, with a very dry mouth, I uttered defiantly:</p>

<p>"Such talk means nothing."</p>

<p>"Bravely said. But this is not talk. You've gone too fast. I
am giving you a chance to turn back."</p>

<p>"Not an inch," I said fiercely. "Neither in thought, in deed;
not even in semblance."</p>

<p>He seemed as though he wanted to swallow a bone in his throat.</p>

<p>"Believe me, there is more in life than you think. There is at
your age, more than..." he had a strange contortion of the body,
as though in a sudden access of internal pain; that humorous smile,
that abode in the form of his lips, changed into a ghastly, forced
grin... "than one love in a life&mdash;more than one woman."</p>

<p>I believe he tried to leer at me, because his voice was absolutely
dying in his throat. My indignation was boundless. I cried out
with the fire of deathless conviction:</p>

<p>"It is not true. You know it is not true."</p>

<p>He was speechless for a time; then, shaking and stammering with
that inward rage that seemed to heave like molten lava in his
breast, without ever coming to the surface of his face:</p>

<p>"What! Is it I, then, who have to go back? For&mdash;for you&mdash;-a boy&mdash;come
from devil knows where&mdash;an English, beggarly.... For a girl's
whim.... <em>I&mdash;</em>a man."</p>

<p>He calmed down. "No; you are mad. You are dreaming. You don't
know. You can't&mdash;you! You don't know what a man is; you with your
calf-love a day old. How dare you look at me who have breathed
for years in the very air? You fool&mdash;you little, wretched fool!
For years sleeping, and waking, and working...."</p>

<p>"And intriguing," I broke in, "and plotting, and deceiving&mdash;for
years."</p>

<p>This calmed him altogether. "I am a man; you are but a boy; or
else I would not have to tell you that your love"&mdash;he choked at
the word&mdash;"is to mine like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

<p>His eyes fell on a cut-glass water-ewer, and, with a convulsive
sweep of his arm, he sent it flying far away from the table. It
fell heavily, shattering itself with the unringing thud of a piece
of ice. "Like this." He remained for some time with his eyes fixed
on the table, and when he looked up at me it was with a sort of
amused incredulity. His tone was not resentful. He spoke in a
business-like manner, a little contemptuously. I had only Don
Carlos to thank for the position in which I found myself. What
the "poor devil over there" expected from me, he, O'Brien, would
not inquire. It was a ridiculous boy-and-girl affair. If those
two&mdash;meaning Carlos and Seraphina&mdash;had not been so mighty clever,
I should have been safe now in Jamaica jail, on a charge of treasonable
practices. He seemed to find the idea funny. Well, anyhow, he
had meant no worse by me than my own dear countrymen. When he,
O'Brien, had found how absurdly he had been hoodwinked by Don
Carlos&mdash;the poor devil&mdash;and misled by Ramon&mdash;he would make him
smart for it, yet&mdash;all he had intended to do was to lodge me in
Havana jail. On his word of honour...</p>

<p>"Me in jail!" I cried angrily. "You&mdash;you would dare! On what
charge? You could not...."</p>

<p>"You don't know what Pat O'Brien can do in Cuba."</p>

<p>The little country solicitor came out in a flash from under the
Spanish lawyer. Then he frowned slightly at me. "You being an
Englishman, I would have had you taken up on a charge of stealing."</p>

<p>Blood rushed to my face. I lost control over myself. "Mr. O'Brien,"
I said, "I dare say you could have trumped up anything against
me. You are a very great scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Why? Because I don't lie about my motives, as you all do? I
would wish you to know that I would scorn to lie either to myself
or to you."</p>

<p>I touched the haft of the sword on the table. It was lying with
the point his way.</p>

<p>"I had been thinking," said I, in great heat, "to propose to
you that we should fight it out between us two, man to man, rebel
and traitor as you have been."</p>

<p>"The devil you have!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"But really you are too much of a Picaroon. I think the gallows
should be your end."</p>

<p>I gave rein to my exasperation, because I felt myself hopelessly
in his power. What he was driving at, I could not tell. I had
an intolerable sense of being as much at his mercy as though I
had been lying bound hand and foot on the floor. It gave me pleasure
to tell him what I thought. And, perhaps, I was not quite candid,
either. Suppose I provoked him enough to fire his pistol at me.
He had been fingering the butt, absently, as we talked. He might
have missed me, and then.... Or he might have shot me dead. But
surely there was some justice in Cuba. It was clear enough that
he did not wish to kill me himself. Well, this was a desperate
strait; to force him to do something he did not wish to do, even
at the cost of my own life, was the only step left open to me
to thwart his purpose; the only thing I could do just then for
the furtherance of my mission to save Seraphina from his intrigues.
I was oppressed by the misery of it all. As to killing him as
he stood&mdash;if I could do it by being very quick with the old rapier&mdash;my
bringing up, my ideas, my very being, recoiled from it. I had
never taken a life. I was very young. I was not used to scenes
of violence; and to begin like this in cold blood! Not only my
conscience, but my very courage faltered. Truth to tell, I was
afraid; not for myself &mdash;I had the courage to die; but I
was afraid of the act. It was the unknown for me&mdash;for my nerve&mdash;for
my conscience. And then the Spanish gallows! That, too, revolted
me. To kill him, and then kill myself.... No, I must live. "Two
lives, one death," she had said..... For a second or two my brain
reeled with horror; I was certainly losing my self-possession.
His voice broke upon that nightmare.</p>

<p>"It may be your lot, yet," it said. I burst into a nervous laugh.
For a moment I could not stop myself.</p>

<p>"I won't murder you," I cried.</p>

<p>To this he said astonishingly, "Will you go to Mexico?"</p>

<p>It sounded like a joke. He was very serious. "I shall send one
of the schooners there on a little affair of mine. I can make
use of you. I give you this chance." It was as though he had thrown
a bucketful of water over me. I had an inward shiver, and became
quite cool. It was his turn now to let himself go.</p>

<p>It was a matter of delivering certain papers to the Spanish commandant
in Tamaulipas. There would be some employment found for me with
the Royal troops. I was a relation of the Riegos. And there came
upon his voice a strange ardour; a swiftness into his utterance.
He walked away from the table; came back, and gazed into my face
in a marked, expectant manner. He was not prompted by any love
for me, he said, and gave an uncertain laugh.</p>

<p>My wits had returned to me wholly; and as he repeated "No love
for you&mdash;no love for you," I had the intuition that what influenced
him was his love for Seraphina. I saw it. I read it in the workings
of his face. His eyes retained his good-humoured twinkle. He did
not attach any importance to a boy-and-girl affair; not at all&mdash;pah!
The lady, naturally young, warmhearted, full of kindness. I mustn't
think.... Ha, ha! A man of his age, of course, understood....
No importance at all.</p>

<p>He walked away from the table trying to snap his fingers, and,
suddenly, he reeled; he reeled, as though he had been overcome
by the poison of his jealousy&mdash;as though a thought had stabbed
him to the heart. There was an instant when the sight of that
man moved me more than anything I had seen of passionate suffering
before (and that was nothing), or since. He longed to kill me
&mdash;I felt it in the very air of the room; and he loved her
too much to dare. He laughed at me across the table. I had ridiculously
misunderstood a very proper and natural kindness of a girl with
not much worldly experience. He had known her from the earliest
childhood.</p>

<p>"Take my word for it," he stammered.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that there were tears in his eyes. A stiff smile
was parting his lips. He took up the pistol, and evidently not
knowing anything about it, looked with an air of curiosity into
the barrel.</p>

<p>It was time to think of making my career. That's what I ought
to be thinking of at my age. "At your age&mdash;at your age," he repeated
aimlessly. I was an Englishman. He hated me&mdash;and it was easy to
believe this, though he neither glared nor grimaced. He smiled.</p>

<p>He smiled continuously and rather pitifully. But his devotion
to a&mdash;a&mdash;person who.... His devotion was great enough to overcome
even that, even that. Did I understand? I owed it to the lady's
regard, which, for the rest, I had misunderstood&mdash;stupidly misunderstood.</p>

<p>"Well, at your age it's excusable!" he mumbled. "A career that..."</p>

<p>"I see," I said slowly. Young as I was, it was impossible to
mistake his motives. Only a man of mature years, and really possessed
by a great passion&mdash;by a passion that had grown slowly, till it
was exactly as big as his soul&mdash;could have acted like this&mdash;with
that profound simplicity, with such resignation, with such horrible
moderation &mdash;But I wanted to find out more. "And when would
you want me to go?" I asked, with a dissimulation of which I would
not have suspected myself capable a moment before. I was maturing
in the fire of love, of danger; in the lurid light of life piercing
through my youthful innocence.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, banging the pistol on to the table hurriedly.
"At once. To-night. Now."</p>

<p>"Without seeing anybody?"</p>

<p>"Without seeing... Oh, of course. In your own interest."</p>

<p>He was very quiet now. "I thought you looked intelligent enough,"
he said, appearing suddenly very tired. "I am glad you see your
position. You shall go far in the Royal service, on the faith
of Pat O'Brien, English as you are. I will make it my own business
for the sake of&mdash;the Riego family. There is only one little condition."</p>

<p>He pulled out of his pocket a piece of paper, a pen, a travelling
inkstand. He looked the lawyer to the life; the Spanish family
lawyer grafted on an Irish attorney.</p>

<p>"You can't see anybody. But you ought to write. Dona Seraphina
naturally would be interested. A cousin and... I shall explain
to Don Balthasar, of course.... I will dictate: 'Out of regard
for your future, and the desire for active life, of your own will,
you accept eagerly Señor O'Brien's proposition.' She'll understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she'll understand," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes. And that you will write of your safe arrival in Tamaulipas.
You must promise to write. Your word..."</p>

<p>"By heavens, Señor O'Brien!" I burst out with inexpressible scorn,
"I thought you meant your villains to cut my throat on the passage.
I should have deserved no better fate."</p>

<p>He started. I shook with rage. A change had come upon both of
us as sudden as if we had been awakened by a violent noise. For
a time we did not speak a word. One look at me was enough for
him. He passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>"What devil's in you, boy?" he said. "I seem to make nothing
but mistakes."</p>

<p>He went to the loophole window, and, advancing his head, cried
out:</p>

<p>"The schooner does not sail to-night."</p>

<p>He had some of his cut-throats posted under the window. I could
not make out the reply he got; but after a while he said distinctly,
so as to be heard below:</p>

<p>"I give up that spy to you." Then he came back, put the pistol
in his pocket, and said to me, "Fool! I'll make you long for death
yet."</p>

<p>"You've given yourself away pretty well," I said. "Some day I
shall unmask you. It will be my revenge on you for daring to propose
to me...."</p>

<p>"What?" he interrupted, over his shoulder. "You? Not you&mdash;and
I'll tell you why. It's because dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>He passed through the door&mdash;a back view of a dapper Spanish lawyer,
all in black, in a lofty frame. The calm, strolling footsteps
went away along the gallery. He turned the corner. The tapping
of his heels echoed in the <em>patio</em>, into whose blackness
filtered the first suggestion of the dawn.</p>
