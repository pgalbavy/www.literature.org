<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I am frequently asked this question: "How did you make the acquaintance
of Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>My connection with Arsène Lupin was well known. The details that
I gather concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts
that I present, the new evidence that I produce, the interpretation
that I place on certain acts of which the public has seen only
the exterior manifestations without being able to discover the
secret reasons or the invisible mechanism, all establish, if not
an intimacy, at least amicable relations and regular confidences.</p>

<p>But how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be
his historiographer? Why I, and not some one else?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my
merit was not considered. It was chance that put me in his way.
It was by chance that I was participant in one of his strangest
and most mysterious adventures; and by chance that I was an actor
in a drama of which he was the marvelous stage director; an obscure
and intricate drama, bristling with such thrilling events that
I feel a certain embarrassment in undertaking to describe it.</p>

<p>The first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June,
of which so much has already been said. And, for my part, I attribute
the anomalous conduct of which I was guilty on that occasion to
the unusual frame of mind in which I found myself on my return
home. I had dined with some friends at the Cascade restaurant,
and, the entire evening, whilst we smoked and the orchestra played
melancholy waltzes, we talked only of crimes and thefts, and dark
and frightful intrigues. That is always a poor overture to a night’s
sleep.</p>

<p>The Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry&mdash;that
delightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed
in such a tragic manner on the frontier of Morocco &mdash;Jean
Daspry and I returned on foot through the dark, warm night. When
we arrived in front of the little house in which I had lived for
a year at Neuilly, on the boulevard Maillot, he said to me:</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"What an idea!"</p>

<p>"But this house is so isolated.... no neighbors.... vacant lots....Really,
I am not a coward, and yet&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, you are very cheering, I must say."</p>

<p>"Oh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins
have impressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves."</p>

<p>We shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Well, that is good," I murmured, "Antoine has forgotten to light
a candle."</p>

<p>Then I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him
a short leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed
by the darkness and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs
on tiptoe, and reached my room as quickly as possible; then, contrary
to my usual habit, I turned the key and pushed the bolt.</p>

<p>The light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful
to take my revolver from its case&mdash;a large, powerful weapon&mdash;and
place it beside my bed. That precaution completed my reassurance.
I laid down and, as usual, took a book from my night-table to
read myself to sleep. Then I received a great surprise. Instead
of the paper-knife with which I had marked my place on the preceding,
I found an envelope, closed with five seals of red wax. I seized
it eagerly. It was addressed to me, and marked: "Urgent."</p>

<p>A letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in
that place? Nervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:</p>

<p>"From the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever
you may hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you
are doomed."</p>

<p>I am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face
real danger, or smile at the visionary perils of imagination.
But, let me repeat, I was in an anomalous condition of mind, with
my nerves set on edge by the events of the evening. Besides, was
there not, in my present situation, something startling and mysterious,
calculated to disturb the most courageous spirit?</p>

<p>My feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and
re-read those threatening words: "Do not move, do not utter one
cry. Otherwise, you are doomed."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I thought. "It is a joke; the work of some cheerful
idiot."</p>

<p>I was about to laugh&mdash;a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What
haunting fear compressed my throat?</p>

<p>At least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it.
"Do not move, or you are doomed," were the words he had written.</p>

<p>These auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the
most positive realities; but why should I struggle against them?
I had simply to close my eyes. I did so.</p>

<p>At that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling
sounds, proceeding from a large room used by me as a library.
A small room or antechamber was situated between the library and
my bedchamber.</p>

<p>The approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt
a desire to get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library.
I did not rise; I saw one of the curtains of the left window move.
There was no doubt about it: the curtain had moved. It was still
moving. And I saw&mdash;oh! I saw quite distinctly&mdash;in the narrow space
between the curtains and the window, a human form; a bulky mass
that prevented the curtains from hanging straight. And it is equally
certain that the man saw me through the large meshes of the curtain.
Then, I understood the situation. His mission was to guard me
while the others carried away their booty. Should I rise and seize
my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the least movement,
at the least cry, I was doomed.</p>

<p>Then came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed
by lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer
that rebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my
confused brain. These were mingled with other sounds, thus creating
a veritable uproar which proved that the intruders were not only
bold, but felt themselves secure from interruption.</p>

<p>They were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather
weakness, a total inability to move any portion of my body, combined
with discretion; for why should I struggle? Behind that man, there
were ten others who would come to his assistance. Should I risk
my life to save a few tapestries and bibelots?</p>

<p>Throughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture,
terrible anguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant
fear of their renewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me,
weapon in hand. My fearful eyes remained cast in his direction.
And my heart beat! And a profuse perspiration oozed from every
pore of my body!</p>

<p>Suddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose
sound was familiar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at
the same time, I had an impression that the light of a new day
was trying to steal through the closed window-blinds.</p>

<p>At last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed
along the boulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished.
Then I put one arm out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes
were fixed upon the curtain, locating the exact spot at which
I must fire; I made an exact calculation of the movements I must
make; then, quickly, I seized my revolver and fired.</p>

<p>I leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to
the window. The bullet had passed through the curtain and the
window-glass, but it had not touched the man&mdash;for the very good
reason that there was none there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire
night, I had been hypnotized by a fold of the curtain. And, during
that time, the malefactors....Furiously, with an enthusiasm that
nothing could have stopped, I turned the key, opened the door,
crossed the antechamber, opened another door, and rushed into
the library. But amazement stopped me on the threshold, panting,
astounded, more astonished than I had been by the absence of the
man. All the things that I supposed had been stolen, furniture,
books, pictures, old tapestries, everything was in its proper
place.</p>

<p>It was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding
that uproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected
the walls, I made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects.
Nothing was missing. And, what was more disconcerting, there was
no clue to the intruders, not a sign, not a chair disturbed, not
the trace of a footstep.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered
head, "surely I am not crazy! I heard something!"</p>

<p>Inch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was
in vain. Unless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a
small Persian rug, I found a card&mdash;an ordinary playing card. It
was the seven of hearts; it was like any other seven of hearts
in French playing-cards, with this slight but curious exception:
The extreme point of each of the seven red spots or hearts was
pierced by a hole, round and regular as if made with the point
of an awl.</p>

<p>Nothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not
that sufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of
a dream?</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Throughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It
was a large room, much too large for the requirements of such
a house, and the decoration of which attested the bizarre taste
of its founder. The floor was a mosaic of multicolored stones,
formed into large symmetrical designs. The walls were covered
with a similar mosaic, arranged in panels, Pompeiian allegories,
Byzantine compositions, frescoes of the Middle Ages. A Bacchus
bestriding a cask. An emperor wearing a gold crown, a flowing
beard, and holding a sword in his right hand.</p>

<p>Quite high, after the style of an artist’s studio, there was
a large window&mdash;the only one in the room. That window being always
open at night, it was probable that the men had entered through
it, by the aid of a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence.
The bottom of the ladder would have left some marks in the soft
earth beneath the window; but there were none. Nor were there
any traces of footsteps in any part of the yard.</p>

<p>I had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had
before me were so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at
me. However, as I was then a reporter on the staff of the ‘Gil
Blas,’ I wrote a lengthy account of my adventure and it was published
in the paper on the second day thereafter. The article attracted
some attention, but no one took it seriously. They regarded it
as a work of fiction rather than a story of real life. The Saint-Martins
rallied me. But Daspry, who took an interest in such matters,
came to see me, made a study of the affair, but reached no conclusion.</p>

<p>A few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to
inform me that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give
his name. I directed Antoine to show him up. He was a man of about
forty years of age with a very dark complexion, lively features,
and whose correct dress, slightly frayed, proclaimed a taste that
contrasted strangely with his rather vulgar manners. Without any
preamble, he said to me&mdash;in a rough voice that confirmed my suspicion
as to his social position:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, whilst in a café, I picked up a copy of the ‘Gil Blas,’
and read your article. It interested me very much.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"And here I am."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite
correct?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely so."</p>

<p>"Well, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information."</p>

<p>"Very well; proceed."</p>

<p>"No, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly
as you have related them."</p>

<p>"I have given you my word. What further proof do you want?"</p>

<p>"I must remain alone in this room."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," I said, with surprise.</p>

<p>"It’s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article.
Certain details established an extraordinary coincidence with
another case that came under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall
say nothing more. And the only means of ascertaining the truth
is by my remaining in the room alone."</p>

<p>What was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled
that the man was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although
somewhat astonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about
the man or the request he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was
aroused; so I replied:</p>

<p>"Very well. How much time do you require?"</p>

<p>"Oh! three minutes&mdash;not longer. Three minutes from now, I will
rejoin you."</p>

<p>I left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One
minute passed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did
those moments seem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a half....Two
minutes and three quarters. Then I heard a pistol shot.</p>

<p>I bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror
escaped me. In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his
left side, motionless. Blood was flowing from a wound in his forehead.
Near his hand was a revolver, still smoking.</p>

<p>But, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was
attracted by another object. At two feet from the body, upon the
floor, I saw a playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked
it up. The lower extremity of each of the seven spots was pierced
with a small round hole.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>A half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the
coroner and the chief of the Sûreté, Mon. Dudouis. I had been
careful not to touch the corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very
brief, and disclosed nothing. There were no papers in the pockets
of the deceased; no name upon his clothes; no initial upon his
linen; nothing to give any clue to his identity. The room was
in the same perfect order as before. The furniture had not been
disturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house solely for the
purpose of killing himself, or because he considered my place
the most convenient one for his suicide! There must have been
a motive for his act of despair, and that motive was, no doubt,
the result of some new fact ascertained by him during the three
minutes he was alone.</p>

<p>What was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had
been revealed to him? There was no answer to these questions.
But, at the last moment, an incident occurred that appeared to
us of considerable importance. As two policemen were raising the
body to place it on a stretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed,
a crumpled card fell from it. The card bore these words: "Georges
Andermatt, 37 Rue de Berry."</p>

<p>What did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris,
the founder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given
such an impulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived
in princely style; was the possessor of numerous automobiles,
coaches, and an expensive racing-stable. His social affairs were
very select, and Madame Andermatt was noted for her grace and
beauty.</p>

<p>"Can that be the man’s name?" I asked.&#11834;</p>

<p>The chief of the Sûreté leaned over him.</p>

<p>"It is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey."</p>

<p>"But why this card?"</p>

<p>"Have you a telephone, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in the vestibule. Come with me."</p>

<p>He looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.</p>

<p>"Is Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis
wished him to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very important."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile.
After the circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken
in to see the corpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke,
in a low tone, and apparently unwillingly:</p>

<p>"Etienne Varin," he said.</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"No.... or, at least, yes.... by sight only. His brother...."</p>

<p>"Ah! he has a brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of
business....I forget what it was."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"The two brothers live together&mdash;rue de Provence, I think."</p>

<p>"Do you know any reason why he should commit suicide?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"He held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address."</p>

<p>"I do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance
that will be disclosed by the investigation."</p>

<p>A very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others
entertained the same impression.</p>

<p>I discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and
amongst all my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid
the mysteries that enveloped it, after the double discovery of
the seven of hearts pierced with seven holes, after the two inscrutable
events that had happened in my house, that visiting card promised
to throw some light on the affair. Through it, the truth may be
revealed. But, contrary to our expectations, Mon. Andermatt furnished
no explanation. He said:</p>

<p>"I have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly
surprised that my card should be found in such a place, and I
sincerely hope the point will be cleared up."</p>

<p>It was not. The official investigation established that the Varin
brothers were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under various
names, frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a band of
foreigners who had been dispersed by the police after a series
of robberies in which their participation was established only
by their flight. At number 24 rue de Provence, where the Varin
brothers had lived six years before, no one knew what had become
of them.</p>

<p>I confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated
and so mysterious that I did not think the problem would ever
be solved, so I concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean
Daspry, whom I frequently met at that period, became more and
more interested in it each day. It was he who pointed out to me
that item from a foreign newspaper which was reproduced and commented
upon by the entire press. It was as follows:</p>

<p>"The first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is expected
to revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence of the
former Emperor at a place that will be kept secret until the last
minute. An indiscretion has revealed its name; it is called ‘The
Seven-of-Hearts.’"</p>

<p>The Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a connection
be established between the name of the sub-marine and the incidents
which we have related? But a connection of what nature? What had
happened here could have no possible relation with the sub-marine.</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" said Daspry to me. "The most diverse
effects often proceed from the same cause."</p>

<p>Two days later, the following foreign news item was received
and published:</p>

<p>"It is said that the plans of the new sub-marine ‘Seven-of-Hearts’
were prepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain,
the support of their compatriots, subsequently entered into negotiations
with the British Admiralty, without success."</p>

<p>I do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters
which once provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger
of injury therefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the
article that appeared in the ‘Echo de France,’ which aroused so
much comment at that time, and which threw considerable light
upon the mystery of the Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as
it was published over the signature of Salvator:</p>

<p>  "<em>THE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS</em>.</p>

<p>  "A <em>CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED</em>.</p>

<p> "We will be brief.  Ten years ago, a young mining engineer,
Louis   Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain
studies,   resigned his position he then held, and rented number
102 boulevard   Maillot, a small house that had been recently
built and decorated   for an Italian count.  Through the agency
of the Varin brothers of   Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the
preliminary experiments and   the other acted as financial agent,
the young engineer was   introduced to Georges Andermatt, the
founder of the Metal Exchange.</p>

<p>  "After several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the
banker   in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it
was agreed   that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon.
Andermatt would   use his influence with the Minister of Marine
to obtain a series of   trials under the direction of the government. 
For two years, Louis   Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt’s
house, and he   submitted to the banker the various improvements
he made upon his   original plans, until one day, being satisfied
with the perfection   of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to
communicate with the   Minister of Marine.  That day, Louis Lacombe
dined at Mon.   Andermatt’s house.  He left there about half-past
eleven at night.   He has not been seen since.</p>

<p>  "A perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the  
young man’s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but  
without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe- 
who was known as an original and visionary youth&mdash;had quietly
left   for parts unknown.</p>

<p>  "Let us accept that theory&mdash;improbable, though it be,&mdash;and
let us   consider another question, which is a most important
one for our   country:  What has become of the plans of the sub-marine?
Did Louis   Lacombe carry them away?  Are they destroyed?</p>

<p>  "After making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,  
positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the  
possession of the two brothers Varin.  How did they acquire such
a   possession?  That is a question not yet determined; nor do
we know   why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date. 
Did they   fear that their title to them would be called in question? 
If so,   they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely,
that the   plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign
power, and   we are in a position to publish the correspondence
that passed   between the Varin brothers and the representative
of that power.   The ‘Seven-of-Hearts’ invented by Louis Lacombe
has been actually   constructed by our neighbor.</p>

<p>  "Will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of
those   who were concerned in that treacherous act?"</p>

<p>And a post-script adds:</p>

<p>  "Later.   &mdash;Our special correspondent informs us that
the preliminary   trial of the ‘Seven-of-Hearts’ has not been
satisfactory.  It is   quite likely that the plans sold and delivered
by the Varin   brothers did not include the final document carried
by Louis   Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance,
a   document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding
of the   invention.  It contained a summary of the final conclusions
of the   inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in
the other   papers.  Without this document, the plans are incomplete;
on the   other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.</p>

<p>  "Now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us.  It
may   be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of
Mon.   Andermatt.  It will be to his interest to explain his conduct
which   has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable.  He will
explain not   only why he concealed these facts at the time of
the suicide of   Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed
the disappearance   of the paper&mdash;a fact well known to him.  He
will tell why, during   the last six years, he paid spies to watch
the movements of the   Varin brothers.  We expect from him, not
only words, but acts.  And   at once.  Otherwise&#11834;"</p>

<p>The threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist?
What whip was Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article, holding
over the head of Mon. Andermatt?</p>

<p>An army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers
announced the scornful manner in which they were treated. Thereupon,
the ‘Echo de France’ announced its position in these words:</p>

<p>"Whether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth,
our collaborator in the work we have undertaken."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>Daspry and I were dining together on the day on which that announcement
appeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread over my table,
we discussed the affair and examined it from every point of view
with that exasperation that a person feels when walking in the
dark and finding himself constantly falling over the same obstacles.
Suddenly, without any warning whatsoever, the door opened and
a lady entered. Her face was hidden behind a thick veil. I rose
at once and approached her.</p>

<p>"Is it you, monsieur, who lives here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, but I do not understand&#11834;"</p>

<p>"The gate was not locked," she explained.</p>

<p>"But the vestibule door?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the
servants’ entrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a
silence that was quite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and
I was obliged to introduce him. I asked her to be seated and explain
the object of her visit. She raised her veil, and I saw that she
was a brunette with regular features and, though not handsome,
she was attractive&mdash;principally, on account of her sad, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I am Madame Andermatt," she said.</p>

<p>"Madame Andermatt!" I repeated, with astonishment.</p>

<p>After a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that
were quite easy and natural:</p>

<p>"I have come to see you about that affair&mdash;you know. I thought
I might be able to obtain some information&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared
in the papers. But if you will point out in what way I can help
you...."</p>

<p>"I do not know....I do not know."</p>

<p>Not until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed,
and that some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of
tranquility. For a moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then
Daspry stepped forward, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she cried. "I will answer."</p>

<p>"You will answer.... whatever those questions may be?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you know Louis Lacombe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, through my husband."</p>

<p>"When did you see him for the last time?"</p>

<p>"The evening he dined with us."</p>

<p>"At that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that
you would never see him again?"</p>

<p>"No. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia&mdash;in a vague way."</p>

<p>"Then you expected to see him again?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was to dine with us, two days later."</p>

<p>"How do you explain his disappearance?"</p>

<p>"I cannot explain it."</p>

<p>"And Mon. Andermatt?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Yet the article published in the ‘Echo de France’ indicates&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his disappearance."</p>

<p>"Is that your opinion?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On what do you base your opinion?"</p>

<p>"When he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing
all the papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my husband,
in a conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned that
the papers were in their possession."</p>

<p>"And he did not denounce them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because there was something else in the satchel&mdash;something besides
the papers of Louis Lacombe."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>She hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained
silent. Daspry continued:</p>

<p>"I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over
their movements instead of informing the police. He hoped to recover
the papers and, at the same time, that compromising article which
has enabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of exposure
and blackmail."</p>

<p>"Over him, and over me."</p>

<p>"Ah! over you, also?"</p>

<p>"Over me, in particular."</p>

<p>She uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed
it; he paced to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:</p>

<p>"Had you written to Louis Lacombe?"</p>

<p>"Of course. My husband had business with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Apart from those business letters, had you written to Louis
Lacombe.... other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is absolutely
necessary that I should know the truth. Did you write other letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, blushing.</p>

<p>"And those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Does Mon. Andermatt know it?"</p>

<p>"He has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their
existence and threatened to publish them if my husband should
take any steps against him. My husband was afraid.... of a scandal."</p>

<p>"But he has tried to recover the letters?"</p>

<p>"I think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview
with Alfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my
husband in which he called me to account&mdash;we live as strangers."</p>

<p>"In that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?"</p>

<p>"I may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he
has loved, the one he would still love&mdash;oh! I am quite sure of
that," she murmured, in a fervent voice, "he would still love
me if he had not got hold of those cursed letters&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I believe my husband discovered that hiding-place."</p>

<p>"Ah! where was it?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Here!" I cried in alarm.</p>

<p>"Yes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very ingenious
and amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes and locks.
No doubt, the Varin brothers were aware of that fact and utilized
one of Lacombe’s safes in which to conceal the letters.... and
other things, perhaps."</p>

<p>"But they did not live here," I said.</p>

<p>"Before you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant
for some time. And they may have thought that your presence here
would not interfere with them when they wanted to get the papers.
But they did not count on my husband, who came here on the night
of 22 June, forced the safe, took what he was seeking, and left
his card to inform the two brothers that he feared them no more,
and that their positions were now reversed. Two days later, after
reading the article in the ‘Gil Blas,’ Etienne Varin came here,
remained alone in this room, found the safe empty, and.... killed
himself."</p>

<p>After a moment, Daspry said:</p>

<p>"A very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since
then?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Has his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear
more gloomy, more anxious?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven’t noticed any change."</p>

<p>"And yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion,
he has not got those letters, and it was not he who came here
on the night of 22 June."</p>

<p>"Who was it, then?"</p>

<p>"The mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds
all the threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching
power we have felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends
who entered this house on 22 June; it was he who discovered the
hiding-place of the papers; it was he who left Mon. Andermatt’s
card; it is he who now holds the correspondence and the evidence
of the treachery of the Varin brothers."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked, impatiently.</p>

<p>"The man who writes letters to the ‘Echo de France’.... Salvator!
Have we not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not mention
in his letters certain details that no one could know, except
the man who had thus discovered the secrets of the two brothers?"</p>

<p>"Well, then," stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, "he
has my letters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband.
Mon Dieu! What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Write to him," declared Daspry. "Confide in him without reserve.
Tell him all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your interest
and his interest are the same. He is not working against Mon.
Andermatt, but against Alfred Varin. Help him."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Has your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis
Lacombe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Tell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document
for him. Write to him at once. You risk nothing."</p>

<p>The advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame
Andermatt had no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran
no risk. If the unknown writer were an enemy, that step would
not aggravate the situation. If he were a stranger seeking to
accomplish a particular purpose, he would attach to those letters
only a secondary importance. Whatever might happen, it was the
only solution offered to her, and she, in her anxiety, was only
too glad to act on it. She thanked us effusively, and promised
to keep us informed.</p>

<p>In fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that
she had received from Salvator:</p>

<p>"Have not found the letters, but I will get them. Rest easy.
I am watching everything. S."</p>

<p>I looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the
note I found in my book on the night of 22 June.</p>

<p>Daspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that
affair.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>We were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness
that surrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain
points; but other points yet remained obscure&mdash;for instance, the
finding of the two seven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily
concerned about those two cards whose seven punctured spots had
appeared to me under such startling circumstances! Yet I could
not refrain from asking myself: What role will they play in the
drama? What importance do they bear? What conclusion must be drawn
from the fact that the submarine constructed from the plans of
Louis Lacombe bore the name of ‘Seven-of-Hearts’?</p>

<p>Daspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted
all his attention to another problem which he considered more
urgent; he was seeking the famous hiding-place.</p>

<p>"And who knows," said he, "I may find the letters that Salvator
did not find&mdash;by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that
the Varin brothers would have removed from a spot, which they
deemed inaccessible, the weapon which was so valuable to them."</p>

<p>And he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held
no more secrets for him, so he extended his investigations to
the other rooms. He examined the interior and the exterior, the
stones of the foundation, the bricks in the walls; he raised the
slates of the roof.</p>

<p>One day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade,
kept the pickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said:
"Come."</p>

<p>I followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant
land into several sections which he examined in turn. At last,
in a corner, at the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring
proprietors, a small pile of earth and gravel, covered with briers
and grass, attracted his attention. He attacked it. I was obliged
to help him. For an hour, under a hot sun, we labored without
success. I was discouraged, but Daspry urged me on. His ardor
was as strong as ever.</p>

<p>At last, Daspry’s pickaxe unearthed some bones&mdash;the remains of
a skeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly,
I turned pale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small
piece of iron cut in the form of a rectangle, on which I thought
I could see red spots. I stooped and picked it up. That little
iron plate was the exact size of a playing-card, and the red spots,
made with red lead, were arranged upon it in a manner similar
to the seven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced with a round
hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards.</p>

<p>"Listen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it
interests you. But I am going."</p>

<p>Was that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it
the result of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I
know that I trembled as I walked away, and that I went to bed,
where I remained forty-eight hours, restless and feverish, haunted
by skeletons that danced around me and threw their bleeding hearts
at my head.</p>

<p>Daspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and
remained three or four hours, which he spent in the large room,
ferreting, thumping, tapping.</p>

<p>"The letters are here, in this room," he said, from time to time,
"they are here. I will stake my life on it."</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day I arose&mdash;feeble yet, but cured.
A substantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received
that afternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete
recovery, and aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the letter:</p>

<p>  "Monsieur,</p>

<p>  "The drama, the first act of which transpired on the night
of 22   June, is now drawing to a close.  Force of circumstances
compel me   to bring the two principal actors in that drama face
to face, and I   wish that meeting to take place in your house,
if you will be so   kind as to give me the use of it for this
evening from nine o’clock   to eleven.  It will be advisable to
give your servant leave of   absence for the evening, and, perhaps,
you will be so kind as to   leave the field open to the two adversaries. 
You will remember   that when I visited your house on the night
of 22 June, I took   excellent care of your property.  I feel
that I would do you an   injustice if I should doubt, for one
moment, your absolute   discretion in this affair.  Your devoted,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>SALVATOR</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>I was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at
the whimsical nature of his request. There was a charming display
of confidence and candor in his language, and nothing in the world
could have induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with
ingratitude.</p>

<p>I gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at
eight o’clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him
the letter.</p>

<p>"Well?" said he.</p>

<p>"Well, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;are you going away?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I intend to stay right here."</p>

<p>"But he asks you to go&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to
see what takes place."</p>

<p>"Ma foi!" exclaimed Daspry, laughing, "you are right, and I shall
stay with you. I shouldn’t like to miss it."</p>

<p>We were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.</p>

<p>"Here already?" said Daspry, "twenty minutes ahead of time! Incredible!"</p>

<p>I went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame
Andermatt. She was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice,
she ejaculated:</p>

<p>"My husband.... is coming.... he has an appointment.... they
intend to give him the letters...."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner.
The servant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it quickly,
but he was too late. I had read it."</p>

<p>"You read it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was something like this: ‘At nine o’clock this evening,
be at Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair.
In exchange, the letters.’ So, after dinner, I hastened here."</p>

<p>"Unknown to your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you think about it?" asked Daspry, turning to me.</p>

<p>"I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited
guests."</p>

<p>"Yes, but for what purpose?"</p>

<p>"That is what we are going to find out."</p>

<p>I led them to a large room. The three of us could hide comfortably
behind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that should
happen in the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame Andermatt
in the centre.</p>

<p>The clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate creaked
upon its hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I was
about to learn the key to the mystery. The startling events of
the last few weeks were about to be explained, and, under my eyes,
the last battle was going to be fought. Daspry seized the hand
of Madame Andermatt, and said to her:</p>

<p>"Not a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep
quiet!"</p>

<p>Some one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once,
owing to the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne.
There was the same slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered
with a black beard.</p>

<p>He entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to
fear the presence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids
them. He glanced about the room, and I had the impression that
the chimney, masked with a velvet portière, did not please him.
He took three steps in our direction, when something caused him
to turn and walk toward the old mosaic king, with the flowing
beard and flamboyant sword, which he examined minutely, mounting
on a chair and following with his fingers the outlines of the
shoulders and head and feeling certain parts of the face. Suddenly,
he leaped from the chair and walked away from it. He had heard
the sound of approaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at
the door.</p>

<p>"You! You!" exclaimed the banker. "Was it you who brought me
here?"</p>

<p>"I? By no means," protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that
reminded me of his brother, "on the contrary, it was your letter
that brought me here."</p>

<p>"My letter?"</p>

<p>"A letter signed by you, in which you offered&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I never wrote to you," declared Mon. Andermatt.</p>

<p>"You did not write to me!"</p>

<p>Instinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker,
but against the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap.
A second time, he looked in our direction, then walked toward
the door. But Mon. Andermatt barred his passage.</p>

<p>"Well, where are you going, Varin?"</p>

<p>"There is something about this affair I don’t like. I am going
home. Good evening."</p>

<p>"One moment!"</p>

<p>"No need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you."</p>

<p>"But I have something to say to you, and this is a good time
to say it."</p>

<p>"Let me pass."</p>

<p>"No, you will not pass."</p>

<p>Varin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as
he muttered:</p>

<p>"Well, then, be quick about it."</p>

<p>One thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions
experienced a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was
he not a necessary party at this conference? Or was he satisfied
to let these two adversaries fight it out between themselves?
At all events, his absence was a great disappointment, although
it did not detract from the dramatic strength of the situation.</p>

<p>After a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to
face, eye to eye, said:</p>

<p>"Now, after all these years and when you have nothing more to
fear, you can answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis
Lacombe?"</p>

<p>"What a question! As if I knew anything about him!"</p>

<p>"You do know! You and your brother were his constant companions,
almost lived with him in this very house. You knew all about his
plans and his work. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe,
when I parted with him at my door, I saw two men slinking away
in the shadows of the trees. That, I am ready to swear to."</p>

<p>"Well, what has that to do with me?"</p>

<p>"The two men were you and your brother."</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"The best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed
me the papers and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered
to sell them. How did these papers come into your possession?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them
on Louis Lacombe’s table, the morning after his disappearance."</p>

<p>"That is a lie!"</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"The law will prove it."</p>

<p>"Why did you not appeal to the law?"</p>

<p>"Why? Ah! Why&#11834;," stammered the banker, with a slight display
of emotion.</p>

<p>"You know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty
of our guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you."</p>

<p>"What threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those
letters a moment’s thought?"</p>

<p>"If you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me thousands
of francs for their return? And why did you have my brother and
me tracked like wild beasts?"</p>

<p>"To recover the plans."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you
had the letters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh!
no, I couldn’t part with them!"</p>

<p>He laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>"But, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We
make no headway. We had better let things stand as they are."</p>

<p>"We will not let them stand as they are," said the banker, "and
since you have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you
will not leave this house until you deliver up those letters."</p>

<p>"I shall go when I please."</p>

<p>"You will not."</p>

<p>"Be careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I say, you shall not go."</p>

<p>"We will see about that," cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame
Andermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard
it, for he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed
him back. Then I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.</p>

<p>"For the last time, let me pass," he cried.</p>

<p>"The letters, first!"</p>

<p>Varin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:</p>

<p>"Yes or no?"</p>

<p>The banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot.
The weapon fell from Varin’s hand. I was amazed. The shot was
fired close to me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin, causing
him to drop the revolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing between
the two men, facing Varin; he said to him, with a sneer:</p>

<p>"You were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand
and struck only the revolver."</p>

<p>Both of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the
banker, and said:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business;
but, really, you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards."</p>

<p>Turning again to Varin, Daspry said:</p>

<p>"It’s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please.
Hearts are trumps, and I play the seven."</p>

<p>Then Daspry held up, before Varin’s bewildered eyes, the little
iron plate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible
shock to Varin. With livid features, staring eyes, and an air
of intense agony, the man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight
of it.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"One who meddles in other people’s business, down to the very
bottom."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"What you brought here tonight."</p>

<p>"I brought nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, or you wouldn’t have come. This morning, you received
an invitation to come here at nine o’clock, and bring with you
all the papers held by you. You are here. Where are the papers?"</p>

<p>There was in Daspry’s voice and manner a tone of authority that
I did not understand; his manner was usually quite mild and conciliatory.
Absolutely conquered, Varin placed his hand on one of his pockets,
and said:</p>

<p>"The papers are here."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to
Major von Lieben?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are these the copies or the originals?"</p>

<p>"I have the originals."</p>

<p>"How much do you want for them?"</p>

<p>"One hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>"You are crazy," said Daspry. "Why, the major gave you only twenty
thousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the
boat was a failure at the preliminary trials."</p>

<p>"They didn’t understand the plans."</p>

<p>"The plans are not complete."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you ask me for them?"</p>

<p>"Because I want them. I offer you five thousand francs&mdash;not a
sou more."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand. Not a sou less."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and
said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount."</p>

<p>"But....I haven’t got&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Your check-book? Here it is."</p>

<p>Astounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry
handed to him.</p>

<p>"It is mine," he gasped. "How does that happen?"</p>

<p>"No idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign."</p>

<p>The banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and
signed it. Varin held out his hand for it.</p>

<p>"Put down your hand," said Daspry, "there is something more."
Then, to the banker, he said: "You asked for some letters, did
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a package of letters."</p>

<p>"Where are they, Varin?"</p>

<p>"I haven’t got them."</p>

<p>"Where are they, Varin?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. My brother had charge of them."</p>

<p>"They are hidden in this room."</p>

<p>"In that case, you know where they are."</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"Was it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be
as well informed.... as Salvator."</p>

<p>"The letters are not in the hiding-place."</p>

<p>"They are."</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p>Varin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator
the same person? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so,
Varin risked nothing in disclosing a hiding-place already known.</p>

<p>"Open it," repeated Daspry.</p>

<p>"I have not got the seven of hearts."</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is," said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin
recoiled in terror, and cried:</p>

<p>"No, no, I will not."</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded
king, climbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the
lower part of the sword in such a manner that the edges of the
iron plate coincided exactly with the two edges of the sword.
Then, with the assistance of an awl which he introduced alternately
into each of the seven holes, he pressed upon seven of the little
mosaic stones. As he pressed upon the seventh one, a clicking
sound was heard, and the entire bust of the King turned upon a
pivot, disclosing a large opening lined with steel. It was really
a fire-proof safe.</p>

<p>"You can see, Varin, the safe is empty."</p>

<p>"So I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters."</p>

<p>Daspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place.
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"There is none."</p>

<p>"Is it money you want? How much?"</p>

<p>"Ten thousand."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth ten thousand francs
to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the banker, firmly.</p>

<p>Varin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it
again on the sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each
of the seven holes. There was the same clicking sound, but this
time, strange to relate, it was only a portion of the safe that
revolved on the pivot, disclosing quite a small safe that was
built within the door of the larger one. The packet of letters
was here, tied with a tape, and sealed. Varin handed the packet
to Daspry. The latter turned to the banker, and asked:</p>

<p>"Is the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have also the last document that you received from Louis
Lacombe&mdash;the one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the checks,
and offered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.</p>

<p>"This is what you wanted, Monsieur."</p>

<p>The banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch
those cursed letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with
a nervous movement, he took them. Close to me, I heard a moan.
I grasped Madame Andermatt’s hand. It was cold.</p>

<p>"I believe, monsieur," said Daspry to the banker, "that our business
is ended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance that I have
been able to do you a good turn. Good-night."</p>

<p>Mon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written
by his wife to Louis Lacombe.</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" exclaimed Daspry, delighted. "Everything is coming
our way. Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade.
You have the papers?"</p>

<p>"Here they are&mdash;all of them."</p>

<p>Daspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Quite right. You have kept your word," he said.</p>

<p>"But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"The two checks? The money?" said Varin, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you
ask such a thing?"</p>

<p>"I ask only what is due to me."</p>

<p>"Can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I
think not!"</p>

<p>Varin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were
bloodshot.</p>

<p>"The money.... the twenty thousand...." he stammered.</p>

<p>"Impossible! I need it myself."</p>

<p>"The money!"</p>

<p>"Come, be reasonable, and don’t get excited. It won’t do you
any good."</p>

<p>Daspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of
pain. Daspry continued:</p>

<p>"Now, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want
me to show you the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant
lot near here, and I will show you a little mound of earth and
stones and under it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is false! That is false!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots
on it came from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you
buried it with the body&mdash;and with some other things that will
prove very interesting to a judge and jury."</p>

<p>Varin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:</p>

<p>"All right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one
question. I should like to know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Was there a little casket in the large safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was it there on the night of 22 June?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did it contain?"</p>

<p>"Everything that the Varin brothers had put in it&mdash;a very pretty
collection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by
the said brothers."</p>

<p>"And did you take it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Do you blame me?"</p>

<p>"I understand.... it was the disappearance of that casket that
caused my brother to kill himself."</p>

<p>"Probably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a
sufficient motive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is that
all you wish to ask me?"</p>

<p>"One thing more: your name?"</p>

<p>"You ask that with an idea of seeking revenge."</p>

<p>"Parbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top. To-morrow&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It will be you."</p>

<p>"I hope so. Your name?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>The man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two
words had deprived him of all hope.</p>

<p>Daspry laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage
an affair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of
Arsène Lupin. And now that you have my name, go and prepare your
revenge. Arsène Lupin will wait for you."</p>

<p>Then he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.</p>

<p>"Daspry! Daspry!" I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran
to me.</p>

<p>"What? What’s the matter?"</p>

<p>"Madame Andermatt is ill."</p>

<p>He hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while
caring for her, questioned me:</p>

<p>"Well, what did it?"</p>

<p>"The letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband."</p>

<p>He struck his forehead and said:</p>

<p>"Did she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course
she would. Imbecile that I am!"</p>

<p>Madame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket
a small package exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt
had carried away.</p>

<p>"Here are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters."</p>

<p>"But.... the others?"</p>

<p>"The others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded.
Your husband will not find anything objectionable in them, and
will never suspect the substitution since they were taken from
the safe in his presence."</p>

<p>"But the handwriting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There is no handwriting that cannot be imitated."</p>

<p>She thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man
in her own social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed
the final scene between Varin and Arsène Lupin. But the surprising
revelation caused me considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club
companion was none other than Arsène Lupin. I could not realize
it. But he said, quite at his ease:</p>

<p>"You can say farewell to Jean Daspry."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him
to Morocco. There, he may find a death worthy of him. I may say
that that is his expectation."</p>

<p>"But Arsène Lupin will remain?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Decidedly. Arsène Lupin is simply at the threshold of his
career, and he expects&#11834;"</p>

<p>I was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him
away from the hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:</p>

<p>"Did you discover the smaller safe yourself&mdash;the one that held
the letters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday afternoon
while you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple enough!
But the simplest things are the ones that usually escape our notice."
Then, showing me the seven-of-hearts, he added: "Of course I had
guessed that, in order to open the larger safe, this card must
be placed on the sword of the mosaic king."</p>

<p>"How did you guess that?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact
when I came here on the evening of 22 June&#11834;"</p>

<p>"After you left me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories
of crime and robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous
condition that you would not leave your bed, but would allow me
to complete my search uninterrupted."</p>

<p>"The scheme worked perfectly."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed
in a safe with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was
the key to that lock. I had merely to place the card upon the
spot that was obviously intended for it. An hour’s examination
showed me where the spot was."</p>

<p>"One hour!"</p>

<p>"Observe the fellow in mosaic."</p>

<p>"The old emperor?"</p>

<p>"That old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts
on all playing cards."</p>

<p>"That’s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger
safe at one time and the smaller safe at another time? And why
did you open only the larger safe in the first instance? I mean
on the night of 22 June."</p>

<p>"Why? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same
way. I never changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed
that by reversing the card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement
of the seven spots on the mosaic was changed."</p>

<p>"Parbleu!"</p>

<p>"Of course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things."</p>

<p>"There is something else: you did not know the history of those
letters until Madame Andermatt&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Spoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides
the casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers
which disclosed their treachery in regard to the plans."</p>

<p>"Then it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate
the history of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans
and documents relating to the sub-marine?"</p>

<p>"Simply by chance."</p>

<p>"For what purpose did you make the search?"</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" exclaimed Daspry, laughing, "how deeply interested
you are!"</p>

<p>"The subject fascinates me."</p>

<p>"Very well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt
to a carriage, and dispatched a short story to the ‘Echo de France,’
I will return and tell you all about it."</p>

<p>He sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles
which served to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall
the sensation that followed that article produced throughout the
entire world?</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by Salvator.
Having acquired possession of all the documents and original plans
of the engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in the hands
of the Minister of Marine, and he has headed a subscription list
for the purpose of presenting to the nation the first submarine
constructed from those plans. His subscription is twenty thousand
francs."</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?" I exclaimed,
when he had given me the paper to read.</p>

<p>"Exactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his treachery."</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of Arsène Lupin. That
is how I learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none
other than Arsène Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed
very agreeable ties of friendship with that famous man, and, thanks
to the confidence with which he honored me, how I became his very
humble and faithful historiographer.</p>
