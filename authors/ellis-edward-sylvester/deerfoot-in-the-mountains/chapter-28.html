<p>"I am the son and only child of Taggarak, a leading war chief
for many years of the Blackfoot Indians. I had an elder brother,
but he died before reaching manhood. I remember the visit made
by Deerfoot the Shawanoe to our tribe, in the autumn and winter
of 1804 and 1805. He came from Ohio, in company with two brothers
named Shelton, that were white, and with Mul-tal-la, who belonged
to our own people, and had made the journey eastward into the
Shawanoe country. Mul-tal-la had a companion when he left us,
but he was accidentally killed after arriving in the East.</p>

<p>"I was not quite five years old when I first saw Deerfoot and
his two friends, yet I can never forget him, for he was the most
remarkable youth, white or red, that I ever met."</p>

[2] Statement of Ap-pa-pa-alk, a member of the Blackfoot tribe,<br/>
given to Rev. J. Y. Dilworthy, missionary, on the 21st of<br/>
October, 1869.

</p>
</div>
<p>(Here follows a description of Deerfoot's appearance, his traits,
his skill with rifle and bow, his athletic prowess and his unequaled
woodcraft. This need not be repeated, since you are familiar with
it. The statement which follows, however, is one of the most remarkable
ever penned.)</p>

<p>"I was in the Big Lodge on the afternoon Deerfoot spoke to many
of our people of the white man's God, who, he said, was the God
of the red man as well. Young as I was, I stood at the knee of
my mother, thrilled and almost breathless under the spell of the
simple eloquence of the Shawanoe, many of whose words I remember.
In the midst of his address my father, Chief Taggarak, strode
into the lodge. He passed so close to me that his knee brushed
my shoulder. My mother and I looked up at him, but he did not
see us, nor did he notice anyone except Deerfoot. His eyes were
fixed on the young Shawanoe, and we all thought he meant to attack
him.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot saw him enter, stopped speaking and looked steadily
at the chief as he drew near. Deerfoot always carried his knife
at his girdle, though of course he had laid aside his gun. I remember
wondering why he did not draw his weapon, but, instead of doing
so, he placed his hands behind his back and calmly surveyed Taggarak,
without the least sign of fear. From what I afterward learned,
I am sure that if my father had attacked the Shawanoe, the chief
would have been quickly overcome, if not killed.</p>

<p>"Within two paces of Deerfoot, Taggarak wheeled about, <em>faced</em>
his people and made an impassioned avowal of his belief in the
Christian religion. He declared that the true God had spoken to
him when he tried to hide himself in the woods and to close his
ears against His words. That God had not allowed him to sleep
or eat or drink or rest till he threw himself on his face, and
with streaming eyes begged Him to forgive and take him into His
favor.</p>

<p>"Never was there such excitement among the Blackfoot tribe as
was caused by the declaration of their greatest war chief that
he had become a Christian. It almost rent the tribe in twain.
We had a number of villages and different chiefs, but Taggarak
was the greatest of them all.</p>

<p>"It was clear to everyone that he looked upon Deerfoot the Shawanoe
as more than an ordinary human being. In truth I thought and still
think the same, and I believe you will agree with me when you
hear the rest of my story. Taggarak asked Deerfoot whether he
should give up his chieftaincy, and was ready to do whatever the
Shawanoe advised. Deerfoot told him to remain chief as long as
he lived, but to be merciful to his enemies, never to fight except
in defence of his home and people, and to pray to God morning
and night and to do all he could to please Him in his actions,
his words and his thoughts. Deerfoot did much in the way of teaching
him, and Taggarak became a Christian, as did my mother and myself
and others of our tribe, though I never understood all the height
and depth and breadth of God's love and plans until I had grown
to manhood and talked with the missionaries.</p>

<p>"Christianity would have been firmly planted among my people
but for the acts of the white men themselves. When the expedition
of Lewis and Clark came through our country one of them killed
a Blackfoot. No doubt there was some justification for the act,
but it made our tribe the enemies of the white men, and many who
professed to love the God of the palefaces now cast away such
love and would have none of it. Taggarak was much grieved and
indignant over the action of the white men, but nothing could
weaken or shake his faith in Christianity."</p>

<p>(The incident alluded to occurred July 27, 1806. A party of Blackfeet
stole a number of horses belonging to Lewis and Clark's party,
were pursued, and one of the Indians killed and another wounded.
The tribe was so embittered toward the whites that they were treacherous
enemies to them for many years afterward.)</p>

<p>"From the year following this sad event, however, the authority
of Taggarak waned. He did not care for power, and was content
to let it slip gradually from him and pass to others. I could
have become chief had I wished it, but I knew I was distrusted
because I professed Christianity, and the Blackfeet and I thought
so differently about everything that I remained a simple warrior,
content to serve my father and mother, as an obedient son.</p>

<p>"I did not know for years of the encounter between Taggarak and
Deerfoot in the wood, when the chief sought his life, but was
overcome and then spared by the Shawanoe. Deerfoot never spoke
of it, and I was almost grown when my father told my mother and
me of the strange incident, which was the means of the chief's
accepting the religion that the youth taught by word and example.</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot left our village, Taggarak begged him to visit
him again. He urged so hard that the youth said he would do so
if he could, but he saw little hope and thought their next meeting
would have to wait till both passed into the hunting grounds above.</p>

<p>"Taggarak meditated much over the coming of Deerfoot. As he grew
older he often went to the elevation, a little way from our village,
and near where he had been overcome by the Shawanoe, and passed
hours gazing toward the East, looking and hoping for sight of
the youth who did not come. He always went alone to the spot and
did not suspect his action was noticed by anyone. But at the request
of my mother, I stealthily followed the chief. He seated himself
on a broad, flat rock, which gave him a view of many miles of
mountain, wood and stream, and it seemed that for the hour I watched
him he never took his gaze from the point in the sky where the
sun first showed itself. I have sometimes wondered whether my
father mistook any approaching warrior for the Shawanoe. I never
learned, for not once did he ever refer to those lonely visits
to the elevation.</p>

<p>"One day my father said, with his old sternness of manner, that
since Deerfoot was not coming to see him, I must take a message
to the Shawanoe in his distant home. It was a startling command,
but was not unwelcome to me. I had heard much of the white man's
country, and knew the palefaces were fast pushing into our own.
I had listened to Mul-tal-la's wonderful stories times without
number, and often resolved that when an opportunity came I should
visit the white towns and settlements.</p>

<p>"I was glad, therefore, when my father spoke as he did, and still
more glad when Mul-tal-la, although he had a wife and two children,
offered to go with me. He was anxious to see Deerfoot and the
acquaintances he had made many years before, whose memory was
always a pleasure to him.</p>

<p>"My father's message to the Shawanoe amounted to little. I was
to tell him the chief was still true to his faith, and to ask
him whether he could come to the chief, and, if he could not,
whether he still remembered Taggarak. That was all.</p>

<p>"I was a grown man when, with Mul-tal-la as my companion, I rode
down from the Blackfoot country and we set out on the long journey
he had made more than twenty years before. He remembered every
river, stream, mountain and prairie, though the settlements had
brought many changes, and on the way to the Ohio he met several
acquaintances.</p>

<p>"It would be of no interest to tell of our journey, though we
had more than one adventure. The first place we visited was the
little town of Woodvale, so familiar to Mul-tal-la, and which
had grown to that extent that it had taken a new name.</p>

<p>"There we found George and Victor Shelton, almost in middle life,
both married and among the leading citizens. They were filled
with joy to see Mul-tal-la, and did all they could to make our
visit pleasant. But we had talked only a little while when we
were grieved to learn that Deerfoot, who had moved to the west
of the Mississippi, had been dead a good many years. Not only
that, but the manner of his death was the saddest of which I had
ever heard. (See "The Last War Trail.")</p>

<p>"We stayed for several weeks in Ohio and met many old friends
of the Shawanoe. The one whom I best remember was Simon Kenton,
who had great fame as a hunter, and who had always been a close
comrade of Deerfoot. He was an old man when I saw him, but as
strong and active as many who had lived only half his years. He
came to Woodvale the night before we left on our return and stayed
with Victor Shelton. His eyes filled with tears when he spoke
of Deerfoot, and said that the memory of the brave, blameless
life he lived in all circumstances had more to do with making
Kenton himself a Christian than did the camp meeting at which
he professed conversion.</p>

<p>"Well, we set out for home, and though a part of the journey
was made in winter we met with no mishap. When we arrived, Mul-tal-la
went straight to his lodge to see his wife and children and I
hurried to my home, where I knew the chief had long expected me.
I was greatly relieved to find him and my mother well.</p>

<p>"When I came into my father's presence, and before I had time
to do more than speak my pleasure, he raised his hand as a command
for me to keep silent.</p>

<p>"'I know what you would say, but you need not tell me. Deerfoot
has been here and told me all.'</p>

<p>"'But Deerfoot is dead,' I replied; 'that cannot be.'</p>

<p>"'Did I not say he has visited me since you were gone, and told
me all?'</p>

<p>"And then, forbidding me to open my lips, he related the full
story of Deerfoot's death. He gave the particulars, and was not
wrong in the slightest one. The chief need not have forbidden
me to speak, for I could not say a word for a long time afterward.
He told me nothing more. I cannot explain it."</p>

<p>(Possibly psychologists may find the explanation of this remarkable
fact in mental telepathy, but how shall we explain the still more
extraordinary statement that follows?)</p>

<p>"My mother had grown old and feeble and died a few months after
I came home. I noticed that father stopped going to the elevation
beyond the village and looking toward the rising sun for the coming
of Deerfoot. Nor did he seem to wish to speak of him, though I
know the Shawanoe was much in his thoughts. The chief gradually
failed, and when the weather grew cold he did not leave his lodge.</p>

<p>"He and I lived together. I gave him affectionate attention and
did not let him lack for comfort. Others often visited him, for
the Blackfeet could not forget that he had been one of their greatest
war chiefs. Our lodge was not fashioned like the others. One side
was the face of a large rock, against which we always kindled
the fire. At each of the opposite two corners was a strong post.
These were connected at the tops by a horizontal beam and from
each post was stretched another beam, whose farther end rested
on the rock. This and the three beams gave support for the framework
of the roof, which was made of the boughs of trees. The sides
and walls were of thick bark lined with buffalo robes. This made
the square room below free of all supports or posts. My bed of
furs was at one side and that of my father opposite. An opening
in the roof, where it joined the rock and exactly over the fire,
gave an outlet for the smoke.</p>

<p>"One calm, cold night in autumn, after I had piled a deal of
wood on the blaze and seen that my father was warmly wrapped in
furs and sleeping comfortably, I lay down and fell asleep almost
at once. It could not have been long afterward that I was awakened
by the sound of people talking together. At first I thought they
were outside the lodge, but the fire was burning so bright that
it was like noonday within and I saw that the two persons who
were conversing were standing only a few paces from me.</p>

<p>"One was Chief Taggarak, my father. His face was turned partly
away and toward me and there could be no mistake as to him. The
other's back and one shoulder hid his features, but something
familiar in his appearance and the sound of his voice struck me.
While I was looking and listening he shifted his position and
I saw his face.</p>

<p>"<em>It was Deerfoot the Shawanoe!</em></p>

<p>[Illustration: "It Was Deerfoot, The Shawanoe."]</p>

<p>"No one who had ever seen that Indian youth could possibly make
an error. I never looked upon such comely features or such a graceful
form, nor did I ever listen to so musical a voice. Like a person
in a dream, I felt no special surprise at seeing before me a person
who had died years before.</p>

<p>"I studied him from head to foot. One of the first things I noticed
was that the stained eagle feathers, which he always used to wear
in his hair, were not there, nor did he have his knife at his
girdle nor was his rifle in his hand. I don't suppose they have
need of such things in heaven.</p>

<p>"During this talk between Deerfoot and my father I did not speak
or rise to my feet. I expected the Shawanoe to say something to
me and I had no wish to break in upon the talk. They spent ten
or fifteen minutes thus, and then Deerfoot took the hand of my
father, pressed it warmly and turned to go. As he did so, he seemed
for the first time to see me. He stopped, looked down, smiled
and uttered my name. Then he checked himself, walked to the corner
of the lodge, drew aside the buffalo robe which served as a door
and passed out into the night.</p>

<p>"My father stood for a minute looking after him, and then, with
a glowing face, turned to me:</p>

<p>"'Did you see him?'</p>

<p>"'I did, and heard his voice.'</p>

<p>"'You lost nothing of what he said to me?'</p>

<p>"'Not a word.'</p>

<p>"'Tell them to no one. Now sleep.'</p>

<p>"It was a long time before I closed my eyes, and when I did so
the wonderful words that had fallen from the lips of Deerfoot
were in my ears. To me the strangest part of this strange experience
is that which followed. When morning came I found I could not
remember a syllable that the Shawanoe had said. I spoke to my
father, and he talked of the visit of Deerfoot as he would have
talked of the visit of one of our own Blackfeet. I told him I
had forgotten the Shawanoe's words and asked him to tell them
to me again. He replied that God did not wish me to remember them
and he denied my request, which I respected him too much ever
to repeat.</p>

<p>"Chief Taggarak lived several years longer. I have tried many
times to recall the words spoken by Deerfoot when he visited my
father, but I have never succeeded in bringing back a single one
of them."</p>
