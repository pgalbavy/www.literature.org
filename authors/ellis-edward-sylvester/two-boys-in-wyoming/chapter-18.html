<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was Hank Hazletine, the cowman, who leaped over the head of
Jack Dudley when he was crouching on the rock in the canyon, and
it happened in this way:</p>

<p>It has been intimated that when the veteran left the boy at the
temporary camp on the mountain side his intention was to learn
the whereabouts of Motoza, the Sioux, hoping thereby to gain knowledge
of the missing Fred Greenwood.</p>

<p>This was a task of extreme difficulty, inasmuch as it was certain
the vagrant red man would be on his guard against such strategy.
The Indian whom Hank saw with the aid of the spy-glass was not
he whom he wished to trace, but, suspecting he was in the vicinity,
the cowman made his way thither by a roundabout course. He was
on the alert for the fellow, or for his ally, Bill Tozer. Should
either or both of them discover Hank, he might well assume that
it was an accident. It could hardly be expected of him that he
would remain at the cavern for twenty-four hours, awaiting the
time for Tozer to meet him. His most natural course would be to
engage in hunting with his youthful companion, and he could reasonably
claim to be thus engaged if a meeting took place.</p>

<p>Should events prove that the plotters were too watchful to be
caught off their guard, then the second phase of the business
was to be considered; but it remained to be seen whether such
was the fact. The ransom was to be agreed to when it was apparent
that no other course could save the lad.</p>

<p>Advancing with the care and stealth of a trained Indian scout,
Hazletine remained but a short time near the break in the canyon,
for suspecting, as did Jack Dudley, that it was in that neighborhood
the key to the situation was to be found, he was exposing himself
to discovery. He climbed the same ascent, leaped the canyon, and
ensconced himself on the further side. His intention was to peer
over the edge into the depths below, instead of taking the course
followed later by his young friend.</p>

<p>He was acting on this idea, when he came within a hair of spoiling
everything by committing the very blunder against which he had
sought with so much pains to guard. At his height above the torrent,
as will be remembered, no one was disturbed by the roar of the
waters far below. Because of his susceptibility to sounds, he
heard an exclamation uttered by some one near him. The point whence
it came was a clump of rocks hardly fifty feet distant, and he
fancied he recognized the voice as Bill Tozer's. To his relief
he could see no one, and it was safe, therefore, to assume that
no one as yet saw him.</p>

<p>The ground was favorable, and by using the utmost care he secured
a position from which he discovered Tozer and Motoza in conversation.
The white man was sitting on a boulder, while the Sioux was standing
in front of him, gesticulating as if angry over something that
had been proposed or said. Tozer was smoking a pipe, and seemed
cool and collected, though the exclamation which had betrayed
him indicated that it had not been thus from the beginning.</p>

<p>It was an important discovery for Hazletine to make, but it was
attended by two exasperating facts: the interview was nearly over,
and the words that remained to be spoken were uttered in such
moderate tones that he could not hear a syllable. If the couple
had been obliging enough to raise their voices, it is probable
that the knowledge sought by the eavesdropper would have soon
been at his command.</p>

<p>But nothing of that nature took place. Within five minutes after
the arrival of the cowman, prepared to act his part as spy, Motoza
turned about and walked away in the direction of the canyon, while
Tozer took a course which, if continued, would lead him to the
plateau.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll go there, fur he's no reason to look fur
me in that place afore to-morrer morning."</p>

<p>But the white man was not the important factor in the problem.
Hank waited for some minutes after he had passed from sight, and
then set out to regain sight of Motoza, which task proved more
difficult than he expected. The fellow had vanished, and it was
impossible to tell whither he had gone. The rocky surface left
no trail which even an Apache could follow, and it only remained
for the cowman to fall back upon what may be called general principles.</p>

<p>The experience of the cowman was another illustration of how
much depends in this world on what is called chance.</p>

<p>Jack Dudley, without any preliminary training in woodcraft, discovered
Motoza as he emerged from the canyon, while the veteran of the
West, skilled in all the ways of his venturesome life, spent hours
in looking for the Sioux without obtaining the first glimpse of
him. That he missed him by a margin that could not have been narrower
was a fact; but "a miss is as good as a mile," and the autumn
afternoon drew to a close without the first glimmer of success
on his part. He had gone so far, even, as to visit a distant camp-fire,
whose smoke still faintly showed against the clear sky, but failed
to see a living person.</p>

<p>He was on the point of giving over his quest, when the unexpected
happened. Within a few hundred yards of the break in the canyon
he caught sight of Motoza and Tozer holding another consultation.
They had evidently just met, and the configuration of the ground
enabled Hazletine to steal near enough to catch some of the words
spoken by the couple.</p>

<p>The two were standing face to face, and their actions were peculiar.
Motoza was in the act of handing his Winchester rifle to Tozer,
who, accepting the weapon, turned it over and examined it with
interest. Since he could not speak the Sioux he used the English
language, of which, as will be remembered, Motoza possessed a
fair knowledge.</p>

<p>"You're lucky," he said; "the gun is worth more than yours. So
you made a trade with the young man?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;me trade," replied the Sioux, his painted face relaxing
with the grin that had become almost chronic.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose he made any objection&mdash;that is, he gave you his
gun without making a kick?"</p>

<p>The Sioux nodded his head and still grinned, Tozer joining him
in the last expression of his feelings.</p>

<p>"How about his revolver?"</p>

<p>"He gib me that," said the scamp, drawing forth the handsome
weapon, where Hazletine had not observed it, thrust into the girdle
about his waist.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the meaning of these words and proceedings.
All doubt was removed as to the abduction of Fred Greenwood. Motoza
was the agent in the outrage, though whether Tozer had taken an
active part in the same was yet uncertain. He scanned the smaller
firearm, and then, instead of returning it to the Sioux, deliberately
shoved it into his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take charge of that, Motoza."</p>

<p>The buck was about to make angry objection, when the white man
explained:</p>

<p>"When I meet Hank to-morrow he'll want some proof that I can
turn over the youngster to him. He won't believe I can do so till
he sees that proof. I'll show him this revolver, and he'll know
it belongs to the youngster. That will be all the proof he'll
ask. The rest will come easy; and, Motoza, you and I will be rich."</p>

<p>There was an emphasis in this declaration that was convincing
to the dusky partner in crime. He nodded his head and made no
further protest. Evidently he was under the influence of his white
ally.</p>

<p>At this juncture the couple turned their backs upon the eavesdropper,
who had stolen to within a few paces of them. They continued talking,
but the change of position prevented his hearing what was said.
It was peculiarly exasperating, for, though he had gained considerable
information, he still lacked the most important news of all. He
had heard no intimation of where the prisoner was held. Could
he but learn that, he would have lost no time in attempting his
rescue. It must be said, furthermore, that had such knowledge
come to him he would not have hesitated to draw bead on the two
miscreants in turn, and shoot them down in their tracks. He was
thoroughly enraged, and they deserved the fate.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the change of position the couple walked
away, side by side, still conversing. Certain discovery would
have followed any attempt on the part of the cowman to keep at
their heels or nigh enough to overhear their words, so he held
his place and saw them pass from sight. He had noted the direction,
however, and observed that it led from the canyon and deeper into
the mountains.</p>

<p>This was puzzling. It seemed to Hank that one or both would make
their way to the prison of the youth, for it was unlikely that
he would be left alone through the night. Having no thought of
being under surveillance, Motoza and Tozer would take a direct
course to the place of confinement, which now seemed to be deeper
in the mountains, and at some point of which the cowman had no
suspicion.</p>

<p>It was of the highest importance that the couple should not be
allowed to pass beyond sight, and the cowman began a cautious
search for them. But once more he was doomed to disappointment.
In the gathering twilight it was impossible to regain sight of
them, and, convinced of the uselessness of the attempt, he gave
it up.</p>

<p>"It begins to look as if Tozer holds the winning hand," he angrily
muttered; "there ain't no question that the two have the younker
safe, and I've no idee where to hunt fur him&mdash;but hold on!"</p>

<p>The conviction, or rather suspicion, that the prison of the youth
was within the canyon returned to the hunter with redoubled force.
Why had he not searched there before? If it was a mistake, no
harm could follow; if it was not a mistake&mdash;well, he should see.</p>

<p>Wondering at himself because of his oversight, he abandoned all
attempt to regain sight of the couple and headed for the break
in the canyon. He arrived only a brief while after Jack Dudley
attempted and failed to follow up the gorge, and except for the
mishap of the youth the two would have met within the following
few minutes. It has already been shown how narrowly they missed
doing so.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the cowman with the canyon averted the mistake
made by his young friend. He ascended it with scarcely any hesitation,
although in the dense gloom his vision was almost useless. It
was because of that that he well-nigh stepped upon the crouching
figure without suspecting it. Reaching the stone where Jack had
been overwhelmed by failure, the cowman paused for a minute and
peered round in the gloom. Not until he had glanced upward and
studied the projecting crags over his head as outlined against
the starlit sky was he absolutely sure of his location. That glance
made everything clear.</p>

<p>The next rock upon which it was necessary to leap was within
easy reach, and had Jack Dudley known its location he would have
fallen into no trouble. It lay to the left, close to the side
of the canyon, and really carried one no further up the gorge;
but from its surface he readily bounded to one beyond, and continued
his leap-frog performance until he had ascended another hundred
yards.</p>

<p>He was now close to the point he had in mind. It was there that
he had been picking his way when the wondering boys, looking down
from the top, saw him. Hazletine would have explained his action
to them but for a certain feeling of shame which was not unnatural.</p>

<p>There had been rumors for years among the cattlemen of Southwestern
Wyoming of a cavern in the canyon which was studded with gold.
Many searches had been made for it, but without success. Hank
Hazletine was among those who engaged in the hunt, but neither
he nor his friends succeeded in finding the place. The veteran
was not quite ready to abandon hope, and when he found himself
in the section once more, on the hunt in which he acted as guide
for the boys, he determined to make a decisive exploration without
letting any one know his secret.</p>

<p>It was on this expedition that he succeeded in finding the cavern,
but his trained eye immediately told him the marvellous legend
was a myth. It was a romantic and picturesque spot, but there
was not a grain of auriferous metal or ore in sight. Hoping that
a second cavern was in the vicinity, he extended his search. When
he emerged from the gorge, at the point where the break occurred,
it was with the certainty that the whole thing was a fable. With
a grim smile he dismissed the matter and resolved not to think
of it again. He felt that he had acted foolishly, and his reluctance
to tell his story to his young friends, therefore, was only natural.</p>

<p>But once more the cowman was on his way to the mysterious cavern,
drawn by the hope, rather than the belief, that it was there he
would find Fred Greenwood a prisoner and awaiting the completion
of the bargain for his release by his abductors.</p>

<p>Determined to make no mistake, he halted under the projecting
ledge and spent several minutes in peering around in the gloom.
It looked as if he was right; but the darkness was too profound
for him to make sure, and even the scrutiny of the ribbon of sky
that showed above the narrow opening a thousand feet above his
head failed to remove the last vestige of doubt.</p>

<p>Like the boys, Hank carried a rubber safe of matches. Producing
this, he struck one of the tiny bits on the corrugated bottom
of the little black box, and, shading the flame with his fingers
from the moist wind caused by the dashing waters, he glanced at
his immediate surroundings. He had strapped his Winchester to
his back, and his arms were free.</p>

<p>A thrill of pleasure went through him, for the first scrutiny
showed he was right. Directly over his head projected a thin ledge
within ready reach. It was what might be termed the doorstep to
the cavern. He had come to the exact spot for which he was searching.</p>

<p>Flinging the extinguished match into the waters at his side,
he reached upward, and without difficulty drew himself upon the
ledge. He was now in front of the cavern which he had visited
by daylight, and whose interior was impressed so vividly on his
memory that he knew every foot of it.</p>

<p>"Is the younker in there?" was the question he asked himself
after regaining his feet. To test the matter, he called his name.
The fierce torrent roared below and around him, but he was sure
his words must have penetrated into the dismal recesses. He repeated
the call several times without response.</p>

<p>"It may be the younker is asleep, or, if he hears me, he may
take me fur Motoza; and yet that couldn't be, for our voices don't
sound alike."</p>

<p>Once more he produced his rubber safe and struck a match, holding
the twinkling flame above his head as he slowly moved forward
into the cavern. Before the light expired he had another, for
he intended to make his search thorough.</p>

<p>The opening in the side of the canyon had a width of ten or twelve
feet, was of the same height, and extended back for more than
double the distance. Side, floor and roof were of irregular formation,
and the craggy stones rough and wet. Had there been any gleaming
stalactites or stalagmites in sight, the cause of the legend attaching
to the place would have been understood, but there was nothing
of that nature. The cavern was simply a rent in the side of the
canyon wall, created by some convulsion of nature, and all that
was visible was damp limestone.</p>

<p>By the time the visitor had burned three matches his examination
of the place was completed and he had made the discovery that
he was the only occupant. Fred Greenwood was not there, nor did
the cavern show signs of having been visited by person or animal.</p>

<p>But hold! When Hank threw down the last expiring match, he caught
a glimpse of something white on the flinty floor. He had not thought
of looking for anything, and it was the accidental following of
the match with his gaze that revealed the object. Instantly another
match was sending out its feeble rays, and he stooped down and
picked up that which had arrested his attention.</p>

<p>It was a piece of paper, apparently the blank leaf of a letter.
There was no writing or mark on it to indicate its ownership,
but had it been the visiting-card of Fred Greenwood, Hank Hazletine
could not have been more positive that it belonged to the young
man.</p>

<p>It was impossible that Motoza should carry writing-paper with
him. The cowman never did so, consequently he could not have dropped
it on his late visit. It was equally improbable that Bill Tozer
had anything to do with it. He knew that both of the boys had
paper and pencils with them, for he had seen them figuring over
some problems they were discussing, and with a thrill of conviction
he remembered that the paper they used was of precisely the same
pattern as the piece he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"The younker has been here, but what the mischief has become
of him?" and the mystified cowman looked right and left, on the
floor and at the roof, as if he suspected the youth was hiding
in one of those places.</p>

<p>An explanation suggested itself. After taking the lad to the
cavern, his captor from some cause had changed his mind and transferred
him to another place of confinement.</p>

<p>No; there was another theory which would explain the mystery:
it was that Motoza, yielding to his implacable enmity of the youth,
had placed him beyond all reach of his friends. The spirit of
revenge with an American Indian is tenfold stronger than cupidity.
It was not improbable that the miscreant, having committed the
unspeakable crime, was concealing it from Tozer, his ally in the
dreadful business.</p>

<p>The work of the cowman was finished for the time. He carefully
let himself down from the ledge to the rock immediately beneath,
and began working his way through the canyon to the opening at
the break. His familiarity stood him in as good stead as before,
and he reached the place without mishap. Climbing the steep slope
to the higher ground, he sat down for a few minutes' thought.</p>

<p>It was well into the night, and it was useless to attempt to
do anything more. He was as firmly resolved, however, as before
not to be outwitted by the ruffians with whom he was dealing.
He would consent to no attempt to pay them a ransom until he knew
beyond peradventure that their part of the contract would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"If they try any crooked work," he muttered, with deadly earnestness,
"both of 'em have got to settle with Hank Hazletine."</p>

<p>He gave no thought to Jack Dudley, for he took it for granted
that he had been able to look out for himself during the day.
Following the route so well known to him, he reached the plateau
within an hour after the arrival of the youth, who had started
a fire and was doing his best to dry his clothing and gain some
warmth for his chilled body.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the cowman was interested in the story
told by the youth, and was astonished beyond measure to learn
that both had taken the same route, one actually passing the other
without either suspecting it. On his part, Hazletine related all
that he had passed through, and explained the reason of his ascent
of the canyon some time before, when he was observed by the wondering
lads.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, where was Fred Greenwood?</p>
