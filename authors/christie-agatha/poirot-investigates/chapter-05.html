<p>"What a number of bond robberies there have been lately!" I observed
one morning, laying aside the newspaper. "Poirot, let us forsake
the science of detection, and take to crime instead!"</p>

<p>"You are on the—how do you say it?—get-rich-quick tack, eh, <em>mon
ami</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, look at this last <em>coup</em>, the million dollars’
worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were
sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable
manner on board the <em>Olympia</em>."</p>

<p>"If it were not for the <em>mal de mer</em>, and the difficulty
of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer
time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight
to voyage myself on one of these big liners," murmured Poirot
dreamily.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," I said enthusiastically. "Some of them must be
perfect palaces; the swimming-baths, the lounges, the restaurant,
the palm courts—really, it must be hard to believe that one is
on the sea."</p>

<p>"Me, I always know when I am on the sea," said Poirot sadly.
"And all those bagatelles that you enumerate, they say nothing
to me; but, my friend, consider for a moment the geniuses that
travel as it were incognito! On board these floating palaces,
as you so justly call them, one would meet the élite, the <em>haute
noblesse</em> of the criminal world!"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"So that’s the way your enthusiasm runs! You would have liked
to cross swords with the man who sneaked the Liberty Bonds?"</p>

<p>The landlady interrupted us.</p>

<p>"A young lady as wants to see you, Mr. Poirot. Here’s her card."</p>

<p>The card bore the inscription: Miss Esmée Farquhar, and Poirot,
after diving under the table to retrieve a stray crumb, and putting
it carefully in the waste-paper-basket, nodded to the landlady
to admit her.</p>

<p>In another minute one of the most charming girls I have ever
seen was ushered into the room. She was perhaps about five-and-twenty,
with big brown eyes and a perfect figure. She was well-dressed
and perfectly composed in manner.</p>

<p>"Sit down, I beg of you, mademoiselle. This is my friend, Captain
Hastings, who aids me in my little problems."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is a big problem I have brought you to-day, Monsieur
Poirot," said the girl, giving me a pleasant bow as she seated
herself. "I dare say you have read about it in the papers. I am
referring to the theft of Liberty Bonds on the <em>Olympia</em>."
Some astonishment must have shown itself in Poirot’s face, for
she continued quickly: "You are doubtless asking yourself what
I have to do with a grave institution like the London and Scottish
Bank. In one sense nothing, in another sense everything. You see,
Monsieur Poirot, I am engaged to Mr. Philip Ridgeway."</p>

<p>"Aha! and Mr. Philip Ridgeway——"</p>

<p>"Was in charge of the bonds when they were stolen. Of course
no actual blame can attach to him, it was not his fault in any
way. Nevertheless, he is half distraught over the matter, and
his uncle, I know, insists that he must carelessly have mentioned
having them in his possession. It is a terrible set-back in his
career."</p>

<p>"Who is his uncle?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Vavasour, joint general manager of the London and Scottish
Bank."</p>

<p>"Suppose, Miss Farquhar, that you recount to me the whole story?"</p>

<p>"Very well. As you know, the Bank wished to extend their credits
in America, and for this purpose decided to send over a million
dollars in Liberty Bonds. Mr. Vavasour selected his nephew, who
had occupied a position of trust in the Bank for many years and
who was conversant with all the details of the Bank’s dealings
in New York, to make the trip. The Olympia sailed from Liverpool
on the 23rd, and the bonds were handed over to Philip on the morning
of that day by Mr. Vavasour and Mr. Shaw, the two joint general
managers of the London and Scottish Bank. They were counted, enclosed
in a package, and sealed in his presence, and he then locked the
package at once in his portmanteau."</p>

<p>"A portmanteau with an ordinary lock?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Shaw insisted on a special lock being fitted to it by
Hubbs’s. Philip, as I say, placed the package at the bottom of
the trunk. It was stolen just a few hours before reaching New
York. A rigorous search of the whole ship was made, but without
result. The bonds seemed literally to have vanished into thin
air."</p>

<p>Poirot made a grimace.</p>

<p>"But they did not vanish absolutely, since I gather that they
were sold in small parcels within half an hour of the docking
of the <em>Olympia</em>! Well, undoubtedly the next thing is for
me to see Mr. Ridgeway."</p>

<p>"I was about to suggest that you should lunch with me at the
‘Cheshire Cheese.’ Philip will be there. He is meeting me, but
does not yet know that I have been consulting you on his behalf."</p>

<p>We agreed to this suggestion readily enough, and drove there
in a taxi.</p>

<p>Mr. Philip Ridgeway was there before us, and looked somewhat
surprised to see his fiancée arriving with two complete strangers.
He was a nice-looking young fellow, tall and spruce, with a touch
of greying hair at the temples, though he could not have been
much over thirty.</p>

<p>Miss Farquhar went up to him and laid her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"You must forgive my acting without consulting you, Philip,"
she said. "Let me introduce you to Monsieur Hercule Poirot, of
whom you must often have heard, and his friend, Captain Hastings."</p>

<p>Ridgeway looked very astonished.</p>

<p>"Of course I have heard of you, Monsieur Poirot," he said, as
he shook hands. "But I had no idea that Esmée was thinking of
consulting you about my—our trouble."</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would not let me do it, Philip," said Miss
Farquhar meekly.</p>

<p>"So you took care to be on the safe side," he observed, with
a smile. "I hope Monsieur Poirot will be able to throw some light
on this extraordinary puzzle, for I confess frankly that I am
nearly out of my mind with worry and anxiety about it."</p>

<p>Indeed, his face looked drawn and haggard and showed only too
clearly the strain under which he was labouring.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Poirot. "Let us lunch, and over lunch we will
put our heads together and see what can be done. I want to hear
Mr. Ridgeway’s story from his own lips."</p>

<p>Whilst we discussed the excellent steak and kidney pudding of
the establishment, Philip Ridgeway narrated the circumstances
leading to the disappearance of the bonds. His story agreed with
that of Miss Farquhar in every particular. When he had finished,
Poirot took up the thread with a question.</p>

<p>"What exactly led you to discover that the bonds had been stolen,
Mr. Ridgeway?"</p>

<p>He laughed rather bitterly.</p>

<p>"The thing stared me in the face, Monsieur Poirot. I couldn’t
have missed it. My cabin trunk was half out from under the bunk
and all scratched and cut about where they’d tried to force the
lock."</p>

<p>"But I understood that it had been opened with a key?"</p>

<p>"That’s so. They tried to force it, but couldn’t. And, in the
end, they must have got it unlocked somehow or other."</p>

<p>"Curious," said Poirot, his eyes beginning to flicker with the
green light I knew so well. "Very curious! They waste much, much
time trying to prise it open, and then—<em>sapristi!</em> they
find that they have the key all the time—for each of Hubbs’s locks
are unique."</p>

<p>"That’s just why they couldn’t have had the key. It never left
me day or night."</p>

<p>"You are sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I can swear to it, and besides, if they had had the key or a
duplicate, why should they waste time trying to force an obviously
unforceable lock?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there is exactly the question we are asking ourselves! I
venture to prophesy that the solution, if we ever find it, will
hinge on that curious fact. I beg of you not to assault me if
I ask you one more question: <em>Are you perfectly certain you
did not leave the trunk unlocked?</em>"</p>

<p>Philip Ridgeway merely looked at him, and Poirot gesticulated
apologetically.</p>

<p>"Ah, but these things can happen, I assure you! Very well, the
bonds were stolen from the trunk. What did the thief do with them?
How did he manage to get ashore with them?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Ridgeway. "That’s just it. How? Word was passed to
the Customs authorities, and every soul that left the ship was
gone over with a toothcomb!"</p>

<p>"And the bonds, I gather, made a bulky package?"</p>

<p>"Certainly they did. They could hardly have been hidden on board—and
anyway we know they weren’t because they were offered for sale
within half an hour of the <em>Olympia’s</em> arrival, long before
I got the cables going and the numbers sent out. One broker swears
he bought some of them even before the <em>Olympia</em> got in.
But you can’t send bonds by wireless."</p>

<p>"Not by wireless, but did any tug come alongside?"</p>

<p>"Only the official ones, and that was after the alarm was given
when every one was on the look-out. I was watching out myself
for their being passed over to some one that way. My God, Monsieur
Poirot, this thing will drive me mad! People are beginning to
say I stole them myself."</p>

<p>"But you also were searched on landing, weren’t you?" asked Poirot
gently.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The young man stared at him in a puzzled manner.</p>

<p>"You do not catch my meaning, I see," said Poirot, smiling enigmatically.
"Now I should like to make a few inquiries at the Bank."</p>

<p>Ridgeway produced a card and scribbled a few words on it.</p>

<p>"Send this in and my uncle will see you at once."</p>

<p>Poirot thanked him, bade farewell to Miss Farquhar, and together
we started out for Threadneedle Street and the head office of
the London and Scottish Bank. On production of Ridgeway’s card,
we were led through the labyrinth of counters and desks, skirting
paying-in clerks and paying-out clerks and up to a small office
on the first floor where the joint general managers received us.
They were two grave gentlemen, who had grown grey in the service
of the Bank. Mr. Vavasour had a short white beard, Mr. Shaw was
clean shaven.</p>

<p>"I understand you are strictly a private inquiry agent?" said
Mr. Vavasour. "Quite so, quite so. We have, of course, placed
ourselves in the hands of Scotland Yard. Inspector McNeil has
charge of the case. A very able officer, I believe."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," said Poirot politely. "You will permit a few
questions, on your nephew’s behalf? About this lock, who ordered
it from Hubbs’s?"</p>

<p>"I ordered it myself," said Mr. Shaw. "I would not trust to any
clerk in the matter. As to the keys, Mr. Ridgeway had one, and
the other two are held by my colleague and myself."</p>

<p>"And no clerk has had access to them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw turned inquiringly to Mr. Vavasour. "I think I am correct
in saying that they have remained in the safe where we placed
them on the 23rd," said Mr. Vavasour. "My colleague was unfortunately
taken ill a fortnight ago—in fact on the very day that Philip
left us. He has only just recovered."</p>

<p>"Severe bronchitis is no joke to a man of my age," said Mr. Shaw
ruefully. "But I am afraid Mr. Vavasour has suffered from the
hard work entailed by my absence, especially with this unexpected
worry coming on top of everything."</p>

<p>Poirot asked a few more questions. I judged that he was endeavouring
to gauge the exact amount of intimacy between uncle and nephew.
Mr. Vavasour’s answers were brief and punctilious. His nephew
was a trusted official of the Bank, and had no debts or money
difficulties that he knew of. He had been entrusted with similar
missions in the past. Finally we were politely bowed out.</p>

<p>"I am disappointed," said Poirot, as we emerged into the street.</p>

<p>"You hoped to discover more? They are such stodgy old men."</p>

<p>"It is not their stodginess which disappoints me, <em>mon ami</em>.
I do not expect to find in a Bank manager a ‘keen financier with
an eagle glance’ as your favourite works of fiction put it. No,
I am disappointed in the case—it is too easy!"</p>

<p>"Easy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do you not find it almost childishly simple?"</p>

<p>"You know who stole the bonds?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"But then—we must—why——"</p>

<p>"Do not confuse and fluster yourself, Hastings. We are not going
to do anything at present."</p>

<p>"But why? What are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"For the <em>Olympia</em>. She is due on her return trip from
New York on Tuesday."</p>

<p>"But if you know who stole the bonds, why wait? He may escape."</p>

<p>"To a South Sea island where there is no extradition? No, <em>mon
ami</em>, he would find life very uncongenial there. As to why
I wait—<em>eh bien</em> to the intelligence of Hercule Poirot
the case is perfectly clear, but for the benefit of others, not
so greatly gifted by the good God—the Inspector McNeil, for instance—it
would be as well to make a few inquiries to establish the facts.
One must have consideration for those less gifted than oneself."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Poirot! Do you know, I’d give a considerable sum
of money to see you make a thorough ass of yourself—just for once.
You’re so confoundedly conceited!"</p>

<p>"Do not enrage yourself, Hastings. In verity, I observe that
there are times when you almost detest me! Alas, I suffer the
penalties of greatness!"</p>

<p>The little man puffed out his chest, and sighed so comically
that I was forced to laugh.</p>

<p>Tuesday saw us speeding to Liverpool in a first-class carriage
of the L. &amp; <em>N.W.R. </em>Poirot had obstinately refused
to enlighten me as to his suspicions—or certainties. He contented
himself with expressing surprise that I, too, was not equally
<em>au fait</em> with the situation. I disdained to argue, and
entrenched my curiosity behind a rampart of pretended indifference.</p>

<p>Once arrived at the quay alongside which lay the big transatlantic
liner, Poirot became brisk and alert. Our proceedings consisted
in interviewing four successive stewards and inquiring after a
friend of Poirot’s who had crossed to New York on the 23rd.</p>

<p>"An elderly gentleman, wearing glasses. A great invalid, hardly
moved out of his cabin."</p>

<p>The description appeared to tally with one Mr. Ventnor who had
occupied the cabin C 24 which was next to that of Philip Ridgeway.
Although unable to see how Poirot had deduced Mr. Ventnor’s existence
and personal appearance, I was keenly excited.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I cried, "was this gentleman one of the first to land
when you got to New York?" The steward shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, sir, he was one of the last off the boat."</p>

<p>I retired crestfallen, and observed Poirot grinning at me. He
thanked the steward, a note changed hands, and we took our departure.</p>

<p>"It’s all very well," I remarked heatedly, "but that last answer
must have damped your precious theory, grin as you please!"</p>

<p>"As usual, you see nothing, Hastings. That last answer is, on
the contrary, the coping-stone of my theory."</p>

<p>I flung up my hands in despair.</p>

<p>"I give it up."</p>

<p>  •   •   •   •   •   •   •</p>

<p>When we were in the train, speeding towards London, Poirot wrote
busily for a few minutes, sealing up the result in an envelope.</p>

<p>"This is for the good Inspector McNeil. We will leave it at Scotland
Yard in passing, and then to the Rendezvous Restaurant, where
I have asked Miss Esmée Farquhar to do us the honour of dining
with us."</p>

<p>"What about Ridgeway?"</p>

<p>"What about him?" asked Poirot with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"Why, you surely don’t think—you can’t——"</p>

<p>"The habit of incoherence is growing upon you, Hastings. As a
matter of fact I <em>did</em> think. If Ridgeway had been the
thief—which was perfectly possible—the case would have been charming;
a piece of neat methodical work."</p>

<p>"But not so charming for Miss Farquhar."</p>

<p>"Possibly you are right. Therefore all is for the best. Now,
Hastings, let us review the case. I can see that you are dying
to do so. The sealed package is removed from the trunk and vanishes,
as Miss Farquhar puts it, into thin air. We will dismiss the thin
air theory, which is not practicable at the present stage of science,
and consider what is likely to have become of it. Every one asserts
the incredibility of its being smuggled ashore——"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we know——"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> may know, Hastings. I do not. I take the view that,
since it seemed incredible, it <em>was</em> incredible. Two possibilities
remain: it was hidden on board—also rather difficult—or it was
thrown overboard."</p>

<p>"With a cork on it, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Without a cork."</p>

<p>I stared.</p>

<p>"But if the bonds were thrown overboard, they couldn’t have been
sold in New York."</p>

<p>"I admire your logical mind, Hastings. The bonds were sold in
New York, therefore they were not thrown overboard. You see where
that leads us?"</p>

<p>"Where we were when we started."</p>

<p>"<em>Jamais de la vie!</em> If the package was thrown overboard,
and the bonds were sold in New York, the package could not have
contained the bonds. Is there any evidence that the package <em>did</em>
contain the bonds? Remember, Mr. Ridgeway never opened it from
the time it was placed in his hands in London."</p>

<p>"Yes, but then——"</p>

<p>Poirot waved an impatient hand.</p>

<p>"Permit me to continue. The last moment that the bonds are seen
as bonds is in the office of the London and Scottish Bank on the
morning of the 23rd. They reappear in New York half an hour after
the <em>Olympia</em> gets in, and according to one man, whom nobody
listens to, actually <em>before</em> she gets in. Supposing then,
that they have never been on the <em>Olympia</em> at all? Is there
any other way they could get to New York? Yes. The <em>Gigantic</em>
leaves Southampton on the same day as the <em>Olympia</em>, and
she holds the record for the Atlantic. Mailed by the <em>Gigantic</em>,
the bonds would be in New York the day before the <em>Olympia</em>
arrived. All is clear, the case begins to explain itself. The
sealed packet is only a dummy, and the moment of its substitution
must be in the office in the Bank. It would be an easy matter
for any of the three men present to have prepared a duplicate
package which could be substituted for the genuine one. <em>Très
bien</em>, the bonds are mailed to a confederate in New York,
with instructions to sell as soon as the <em>Olympia</em> is in,
but some one must travel on the <em>Olympia</em> to engineer the
supposed moment of the robbery."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because if Ridgeway merely opens the packet and finds it a dummy,
suspicion flies at once to London. No, the man on board in the
cabin next door does his work, pretends to force the lock in an
obvious manner so as to draw immediate attention to the theft,
really unlocks the trunk with a duplicate key, throws the package
overboard and waits until the last to leave the boat. Naturally
he wears glasses to conceal his eyes, and is an invalid since
he does not want to run the risk of meeting Ridgeway. He steps
ashore in New York and returns by the first boat available."</p>

<p>"But who—which was he?"</p>

<p>"The man who had a duplicate key, the man who ordered the lock,
the man who has <em>not</em> been severely ill with bronchitis
at his home in the country—<em>enfin</em>, that ‘stodgy’ old man,
Mr. Shaw! There are criminals in high places sometimes, my friend.
Ah, here we are. Mademoiselle, I have succeeded! You permit?"</p>

<p>And, beaming, Poirot kissed the astonished girl lightly on either
cheek! </p>
