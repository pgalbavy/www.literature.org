<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>They had been nearly three weeks on the voyage, three days in
port, four more on cattle trains, and had been marching since
morning from the nearest railway station at Estville-sur-Lesse.</p>

<p>Now, lugging their large leather hold-alls, they started up the
main street of Sainte Lesse, three sunburnt, loud-talking Americans,
young, sturdy, careless of glance and voice and gesture, perfectly
self-satisfied.</p>

<p>Their footsteps echoed loudly on the pavement of this still,
old town, lying so quietly in the shadow of its aged trees and
its sixteenth century belfry, where the great bell, Bayard, had
hung for hundreds of years, and, tier on tier above it, clustered
in set ranks the fixed bells of the ancient carillon.</p>

<p>"Some skyscraper," observed Burley, patronizing the bell-tower
with a glance.</p>

<p>As he spoke, they came to the inn, a very ancient hostelry built
into a remnant of the old town wall, and now a part of it. On
the signboard was painted a white doe; and that was the name of
the inn.</p>

<p>So they trooped through the stone-arched tunnel, ushered by a
lame innkeeper; and Burley, chancing to turn his head and glance
back through the shadowy stone passage, caught a glimpse in the
outer sunshine of the girl whose dark eyes had inspired him with
jocular eloquence as he rode on his mule under the bell-tower
of Sainte Lesse.</p>

<p>"A peach," he said to Smith. And the sight of her apparently
going to his head, he burst into French: "Tray chick! Tray, tray
chick! I’m glad I’ve got on this uniform and not overalls and
one suspender."</p>

<p>"What’s biting you?" inquired Smith.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Stick, nothing. But I believe I’ve seen the prettiest
girl in the world right here in this two-by-four town."</p>

<p>Stick glanced over his shoulder, then shrugged:</p>

<p>"She’s ornamental, only she’s got a sad on."</p>

<p>But Burley trudged on with his leather hold-all, muttering to
himself something about the prettiest girl in the world.</p>

<p>The "prettiest girl in the world" continued her way unconscious
of the encomiums of John Burley and the critique of Sticky Smith.
Her way, however, seemed to be the way of Burley and his two companions,
for she crossed the sunny street and entered the White Doe by
the arched door and tunnel-like passage.</p>

<p>Unlike them, however, she turned to the right in the stone corridor,
opened a low wooden door, crossed the inn parlour, ascended a
short stairway, and entered a bedroom.</p>

<p>Here, standing before a mirror, she unpinned her straw hat, smoothed
her dark hair, resting her eyes pensively for a few moments on
her reflected face. Then she sauntered listlessly about the little
room in performance of those trivial, aimless offices, entirely
feminine, such as opening all the drawers in her clothes-press,
smoothing out various frilly objects and fabrics, investigating
a little gilded box and thoughtfully inspecting its contents,
which consisted of hair-pins. Fussing here, lingering there, loitering
by her bird-cage, where a canary cheeped its greeting and hopped
and hopped; bending over a cluster of white phlox in a glass of
water to inhale the old-fashioned perfume, she finally tied on
a fresh apron and walked slowly out to the ancient, vaulted kitchen.</p>

<p>An old peasant woman was cooking, while a young one washed dishes.</p>

<p>"Are the American gentlemen still at table, Julie?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Maryette, they are devouring everything in the
house!" exclaimed old Julie, flinging both hands toward heaven.
"<em>Tenez</em>, mamzelle, I have heard of eating in ancient days,
I have read of Gargantua, I have been told of banquets, of feasting,
of appetites! But there is one American in there! Mamzelle Maryette,
if I should swear to you that he is on his third chicken and that
a row of six pint bottles of ’93 Margaux stand empty on the cloth
at his elbow, I should do no penance for untruthfulness. <em>Tenez,
Mamzelle Maryette, regardez un peu par l’oubliette</em>&mdash;" And
old Julie slid open the wooden shutter on the crack and Maryette
bent forward and surveyed the dining room outside.</p>

<p>They were laughing very loud in there, these three Americans&mdash;three
powerful, sun-scorched young men, very much at their ease around
the table, draining the red Bordeaux by goblets, plying knife
and fork with joyous and undiminished vigour.</p>

<p>The tall one with the crisp hair and clear, grayish eyes&mdash;he
of the three chickens&mdash;was already achieving the third&mdash;a crisply
browned bird, fresh from the spit, fragrant and smoking hot. At
intervals he buttered great slices of rye bread, or disposed of
an entire young potato, washing it down with a goblet of red wine,
but always he returned to the rich roasted fowl which he held,
still impaled upon its spit, and which he carved as he ate, wings,
legs, breast falling in steaming flakes under his skillful knife
blade.</p>

<p>Sticky Smith finally pushed aside his drained glass and surveyed
an empty plate frankly and regretfully, unable to continue. He
said:</p>

<p>"I’m going to bed and I’m going to sleep twenty-four hours. After
that I’m going to eat for twenty-four more hours, and then I’ll
be in good shape. Bong soir."</p>

<p>"Aw, stick around with the push!" remonstrated Kid Glenn thickly,
impaling another potato upon his fork and gesticulating with it.</p>

<p>Smith gazed with surfeited but hopeless envy upon Burley’s magnificent
work with knife and fork, saw him crack a seventh bottle of Bordeaux,
watched him empty the first goblet.</p>

<p>But even Glenn’s eyes began to dull in spite of himself, his
head nodded mechanically at every mouthful achieved.</p>

<p>"I gotta call it off, Jack," he yawned. "Stick and I need the
sleep if you don’t. So here’s where we quit&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let me tell you about that girl," began Burley. "I never saw
a prettier&mdash;" But Glenn had appetite neither for food nor romance:</p>

<p>"Say, listen. Have a heart, Jack! We need the sleep!"</p>

<p>Stick had already risen; Glenn shoved back his chair with a gigantic
yawn and shambled to his feet.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," insisted Burley, "that she’s what the French
call tray, tray chick&#11834;"</p>

<p>Stick pointed furiously at the fowl:</p>

<p>"Chick? I’m fed up on chick! Maybe she is some chick, as you
say, but it doesn’t interest me. Goo’bye. Don’t come battering
at my door and wake me up, Jack. Be a sport and lemme alone&#11834;"</p>

<p>He turned and shuffled out, and Glenn followed, his Mexican spurs
clanking.</p>

<p>Burley jeered them:</p>

<p>"Mollycoddles! Come on and take in the town with us!"</p>

<p>But they slammed the door behind them, and he heard them stumbling
and clanking up stairs.</p>

<p>So Burley, gazing gravely at his empty plate, presently emptied
the last visible bottle of Bordeaux, then stretching his mighty
arms and superb chest, fished out a cigarette, set fire to it,
unhooked the cartridge-belt and holster from the back of his chair,
buckled it on, rose, pulled on his leather-peaked cap, and drew
a deep breath of contentment.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood in the centre of the room, as though in
pleasant meditation, then he slowly strode toward the street door,
murmuring to himself: "Tray, tray chick. The prettiest girl in
the world.... La ploo belle fille du monde ... la ploo belle...."</p>

<p>He strolled as far as the corral down in the meadow by the stream,
where he found the negro muleteers asleep and the mules already
watered and fed.</p>

<p>For a while he hobnobbed with the three gendarmes on duty there,
practicing his kind of French on them and managing to understand
and be understood more or less&mdash;probably less.</p>

<p>But the young man was persistent; he desired to become that easy
master of the French language that his tongue-tied comrades believed
him to be. So he practiced garrulously upon the polite, suffering
gendarmes.</p>

<p>He related to them his experience on shipboard with a thousand
mutinous mules to pacify, feed, water, and otherwise cherish.
They had, it appeared, encountered no submarines, but enjoyed
several alarms from destroyers which eventually proved to be British.</p>

<p>"A cousin of mine," explained Burley, "Ned Winters, of El Paso,
went down on the steamer <em>John B. Doty</em>, with eleven hundred
mules and six niggers. The Boches torpedoed the ship and then
raked the boats. I’d like to get a crack at one Boche before I
go back to God’s country."</p>

<p>The gendarmes politely but regretfully agreed that it was impracticable
for Burley to get a crack at a Hun; and the American presently
took himself off to the corral, after distributing cigarettes
and establishing cordial relations with the Sainte Lesse Gendarmerie.</p>

<p>He waked up a negro and inspected the mules; that took a long
time. Then he sought out the negro blacksmith, awoke him, and
wrote out some directions.</p>

<p>"The idea is," he explained, "that whenever the French in this
sector need mules they draw on our corral. We are supposed to
keep ten or eleven hundred mules here all the time and look after
them. Shipments come every two weeks, I believe. So after you’ve
had another good nap, George, you wake up your boys and get busy.
And there’ll be trouble if things are not in running order by
tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"Yas, suh, Mistuh Burley," nodded the sleepy blacksmith, still
blinking in the afternoon sunshine.</p>

<p>"And if you need an interpreter," added Burley, "always call
on me until you learn French enough to get on. Understand, George?"</p>

<p>"Yas, suh."</p>

<p>"Because," said Burley, walking away, "a thorough knowledge of
French idioms is necessary to prevent mistakes. When in doubt
always apply to me, George, for only a master of the language
is competent to deal with these French people."</p>

<p>It was his one vanity, his one weakness. Perhaps, because he
so ardently desired proficiency, he had already deluded himself
with the belief that he was a master of French.</p>

<p>So, belt and loaded holster sagging, and large silver spurs clicking
and clinking at every step, John Burley sauntered back along the
almost deserted street of Sainte Lesse, thinking sometimes of
his mules, sometimes of the French language, and every now and
then of a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl whose delicately flushed
and pensive gaze he had encountered as he had ridden into Sainte
Lesse under the old belfry.</p>

<p>"Stick Smith’s a fool," he thought to himself impatiently. "Tray
chick doesn’t mean ’some chicken.’ It means a pretty girl, in
French."</p>

<p>He looked up at the belfry as he passed under it, and at the
same moment, from beneath the high, gilded dragon which crowned
its topmost spire, a sweet bell-note floated, another, others
succeeding in crystalline sweetness, linked in a fragment of some
ancient melody. Then they ceased; then came a brief silence; the
great bell he had heard before struck five times.</p>

<p>"Lord!&mdash;that’s pretty," he murmured, moving on and turning into
the arched tunnel which was the entrance to the White Doe Inn.</p>

<p>Wandering at random, he encountered the innkeeper in the parlour,
studying a crumpled newspaper through horn-rimmed spectacles on
his nose.</p>

<p>"Tray jolie," said Burley affably, seating himself with an idea
of further practice in French.</p>

<p>"<em>Plait-il?</em>"</p>

<p>"The bells&mdash;tray beau!"</p>

<p>The old man straightened his bent shoulders a little proudly.</p>

<p>"For thirty years, m’sieu, I have been Carillonneur of Sainte
Lesse." He smiled; then, saddened, he held out both hands toward
Burley. The fingers were stiff and crippled with rheumatism.</p>

<p>"No more," he said slowly; "the carillon is ended for me. The
great art is no more for Jean Courtray, Master of Bells."</p>

<p>"What is a carillon?" inquired John Burley simply.</p>

<p>Blank incredulity was succeeded by a shocked expression on the
old man’s visage. After a silence, in mild and patient protest,
he said:</p>

<p>"I am Jean Courtray, Carillonneur of Sainte Lesse.... Have you
never heard of the carillon of Sainte Lesse, or of me?"</p>

<p>"Never," said Burley. "We don’t have anything like that in America."</p>

<p>The old carillonneur, Jean Courtray, began to speak in a low
voice of his art, his profession, and of the great carillon of
forty-six bells in the ancient tower of Sainte Lesse.</p>

<p>A carillon, he explained, is a company of fixed bells tuned according
to the chromatic scale and ranging through several octaves. These
bells, rising tier above tier in a belfry, the smallest highest,
the great, ponderous bells of the bass notes lowest, are not free
to swing, but are fixed to huge beams, and are sounded by clappers
connected by a wilderness of wires to a keyboard which is played
upon by the bell-master or carillonneur.</p>

<p>He explained that the office of bell-master was an ancient one
and greatly honoured; that the bell-master was also a member of
the municipal government; that his salary was a fixed one; that
not only did he play upon the carillon on fête days, market days,
and particular occasions, but he also travelled and gave concerts
upon the few existing carillons of other ancient towns and cities,
not alone in France where carillons were few, but in Belgium and
Holland, where they still were comparatively many, although the
German barbarians had destroyed some of the best at Liége, Arras,
Dixmude, Termonde, and Ypres.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he went on in a voice which began to grow a little
unsteady, "the Huns have destroyed the ancient carillons of Louvain
and of Mechlin. In the superb bell-tower of Saint Rombold I have
played for a thousand people; and the Carillonneur, Monsieur Vincent,
and the great bell-master, Josef Denyn, have come to me to congratulate
me with tears in their eyes&mdash;in their eyes&#11834;"</p>

<p>There were tears in his own now, and he bent his white head and
looked down at the worn floor under his crippled feet.</p>

<p>"Alas," he said, "for Denyn&mdash;and for Saint Rombold’s tower. The
Hun has passed that way."</p>

<p>After a silence:</p>

<p>"Who is it now plays the carillon in Sainte Lesse!" asked Burley.</p>

<p>"My daughter, Maryette. Sainte Lesse has honoured me in my daughter,
whom I myself instructed. My daughter&mdash;the little child of my
old age, monsieur&mdash;is mistress of the bells of Sainte Lesse....
They call her Carillonnette in Sainte Lesse&#11834;"</p>

<p>The door opened and the girl came in.</p>
