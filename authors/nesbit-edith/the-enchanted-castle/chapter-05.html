<p>"<em>SEARCH </em>and research proving vain," said Gerald, when
every corner of the bedroom had been turned out and the ring had
not been found, "the noble detective hero of our tale remarked
that he would have other fish to fry in half a jiff, and if the
rest of you want to hear about last night...."</p>

<p>"Let's keep it till we get to Mabel," said Kathleen heroically.</p>

<p>"The assignation was ten-thirty, wasn't it? Why shouldn't Gerald
gas as we go along? I don't suppose anything very much happened,
anyhow." This, of course, was Jimmy.</p>

<p>"That shows," remarked Gerald sweetly, "how much <em>you</em>
know. The melancholy Mabel will await the tryst without success,
as far as this one is concerned. 'Fish, fish, other fish&mdash;other
fish I fry!'" he warbled to the tune of "Cherry Ripe," till Kathleen
could have pinched him.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned coldly away, remarking, "When you've quite done."</p>

<p>But Gerald went on singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"'Where the lips of Johnson smile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the land of Cherry Isle.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Other fish, other fish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish I fry.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stately Johnson, come and buy!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"How can you," asked Kathleen, "be so aggravating?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Gerald, returning to prose. "Want of sleep
or intoxication&mdash;of success, I mean. Come where no one can hear
us.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, come to some island where no one can hear,<br/>
&nbsp;And beware of the keyhole that's glued to an ear,"

</p>
</div>
<p>he whispered, opened the door suddenly, and there, sure enough,
was Eliza, stooping without. She flicked feebly at the wainscot
with a duster, but concealment was vain.</p>

<p>"You know what listeners never hear," said Jimmy severely.</p>

<p>"I didn't, then&mdash;so there!" said Eliza, whose listening ears
were crimson. So they passed out, and up the High Street, to sit
on the churchyard wall and dangle their legs. And all the way
Gerald's lips were shut into a thin, obstinate line.</p>

<p>"<em>Now</em>," said Kathleen. "Oh, Jerry, don't be a goat! I'm
simply dying to hear what happened."</p>

<p>"That's better," said Gerald, and he told his story. As he told
it some of the white mystery and magic of the moonlit gardens
got into his voice and his words, so that when he told of the
statues that came alive, and the great beast that was alive through
all its stone, Kathleen thrilled responsive, clutching his arm,
and even Jimmy ceased to kick the wall with his boot heels, and
listened open-mouthed.</p>

<p>Then came the thrilling tale of the burglars, and the warning
letter flung into the peaceful company of Mabel, her aunt, and
the bread-and-butter pudding. Gerald told the story with the greatest
enjoyment and such fulness of detail that the church clock chimed
half-past eleven as he said, "Having done all that human agency
could do, and further help being despaired of, our gallant young
detective&mdash;-Hullo, there's Mabel!"</p>

<p>There was. The tail-board of a cart shed her almost at their
feet.</p>

<p>"I couldn't wait any longer," she explained, "when you didn't
come. And I got a lift. Has anything more happened? The burglars
had gone when Bates got to the strong-room."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say all that wheeze is <em>real</em>?" Jimmy
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course it's real," said Kathleen. "Go on, Jerry. He's just
got to where he threw the stone into your bread-and-butter pudding,
Mabel. Go on."</p>

<p>Mabel climbed on to the wall. "You've got visible again quicker
than I did," she said.</p>

<p>Gerald nodded and resumed:</p>

<p>"Our story must be told in as few words as possible, owing to
the fish-frying taking place at twelve, and it's past the half-hour
now. Having left his missive to do its warning work, Gerald de
Sherlock Holmes sped back, wrapped in invisibility, to the spot
where by the light of their dark-lanterns the burglars were still&mdash;still
burgling with the utmost punctuality and despatch. I didn't see
any sense in running into danger, so I just waited outside the
passage where the steps are&mdash;you know?"</p>

<p>Mabel nodded.</p>

<p>"Presently they came out, very cautiously, of course, and looked
about them. They didn't see me&mdash;so deeming themselves unobserved
they passed in silent Indian file along the passage&mdash;one of the
sacks of silver grazed my front part&mdash;and out into the night."</p>

<p>"But which way?"</p>

<p>"Through the little looking-glass room where you looked at yourself
when you were invisible. The hero followed swiftly on his invisible
tennis-shoes. The three miscreants instantly sought the shelter
of the groves and passed stealthily among the rhododendrons and
across the park, and"&mdash;his voice dropped and he looked straight
before him at the pinky convolvulus netting a heap of stones beyond
the white dust of the road&mdash;"the stone things that come alive,
they kept looking out from between bushes and under trees&mdash;and
<em>I</em> saw them all right, but they didn't see me. They saw
the burglars though, right enough; but the burglars couldn't see
them. Rum, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"The stone things?" Mabel had to have them explained to her.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> never saw them come alive," she said, "and I've been
in the gardens in the evening as often as often."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> saw them," said Gerald stiffly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Mabel hastened to put herself right with him:
"what I mean to say is I shouldn't wonder if they're only visible
when you're _in_visible&mdash;the liveness of them, I mean, not the
stoniness."</p>

<p>Gerald understood, and I'm sure I hope you do.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you're right," he said. "The castle garden's
enchanted right enough; but what I should like to know is <em>how</em>
and why. I say, come on, I've got to catch Johnson before twelve.
We'll walk as far as the market and then we'll have to run for
it."</p>

<p>"But go on with the adventure," said Mabel. "You can talk as
we go. Oh, do&mdash;it is so awfully thrilling!"</p>

<p>This pleased Gerald, of course.</p>

<p>"Well, I just followed, you know, like in a dream, and they got
out the cavy way&mdash;you know, where we got in&mdash;and I jolly well
thought I'd lost them; I had to wait till they'd moved off down
the road so that they shouldn't hear me rattling the stones, and
I had to tear to catch them up. I took my shoes off &mdash;I expect
my stockings are done for. And I followed and followed and followed
and they went through the place where the poor people live, and
right down to the river. And<hr> I say, we must run for it."</p>

<p>So the story stopped and the running began.</p>

<p>They caught Johnson in his own back-yard washing at a bench against
his own back-door.</p>

<p>"Look here, Johnson," Gerald said, "what'll you give me if I
put you up to winning that fifty pounds reward?"</p>

<p>"Halves," said Johnson promptly, "and a clout 'longside your
head if you was coming any of your nonsense over me."</p>

<p>"It's <em>not</em> nonsense," said Gerald very impressively.
"If you'll let us in I'll tell you all about it. And when you've
caught the burglars and got the swag back you just give me a quid
for luck. I won't ask for more."</p>

<p>"Come along in, then," said Johnson, "if the young ladies'll
excuse the towel. But I bet you <em>do</em> want something more
off of me. Else why not claim the reward yourself?"</p>

<p>"Great is the wisdom of Johnson&mdash;he speaks winged words." The
children were all in the cottage now, and the door was shut. "I
want you never to let on who told you. Let them think it was your
own unaided pluck and farsightedness."</p>

<p>"Sit you down," said Johnson, "and if you're kidding you'd best
send the little gells home afore I begin on you."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>LOOK HERE, JOHNSON," GERALD SAID, "WHAT'LL
YOU GIVE ME IF I PUT YOU UP TO WINNING THAT FIFTY POUNDS REWARD</em>?"]</p>

<p>"I am not kidding," replied Gerald loftily, "never less. And
any one but a policeman would see why I don't want any one to
know it was me. I found it out at dead of night, in a place where
I wasn't supposed to be; and there'd be a beastly row if they
found out at home about me being out nearly all night. <em>Now</em>
do you see, my bright-eyed daisy?"</p>

<p>Johnson was now too interested, as Jimmy said afterwards, to
mind what silly names he was called. He said he did see&mdash;and asked
to see more.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you ask any questions, then. I'll tell you all it's
good for you to know. Last night about eleven I was at Yalding
Towers. No&mdash;it doesn't matter how I got there or what I got there
for&mdash;and there was a window open and I got in, and there was a
light. And it was in the strong-room, and there were three men,
putting silver in a bag."</p>

<p>"Was it you give the warning, and they sent for the police?"
Johnson was leaning eagerly forward, a hand on each knee.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was me. You can let them think it was you, if you
like. You were off duty, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"I was," said Johnson, "in the arms of Murphy<hr>"</p>

<p>"Well, the police didn't come quick enough. But <em>I</em> was
there&mdash;a lonely detective. And I followed them."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"And I saw them hide the booty and I know the other stuff from
Houghton Court's in the same place, and I heard them arrange about
when to take it away."</p>

<p>"Come and show me where," said Johnson, jumping up so quickly
that his Windsor arm-chair fell over backwards, with a crack,
on the red-brick floor.</p>

<p>"Not so," said Gerald calmly; "if you go near the spot before
the appointed time you'll find the silver, but you'll never catch
the thieves."</p>

<p>"You're right there." The policeman picked up his chair and sat
down in it again. "Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's to be a motor to meet them in the lane beyond
the boat-house by Sadler's Rents at one o'clock to-night. They'll
get the things out at half-past twelve and take them along in
a boat. So now's your chance to fill your pockets with chink and
cover yourself with honour and glory."</p>

<p>"So help me!" &mdash;Johnson was pensive and doubtful still&mdash;"so
help me! you <em>couldn't</em> have made all this up out of your
head."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I could. But I didn't. Now look here. It's the chance
of your lifetime, Johnson! A quid for me, and a still tongue for
you, and the job's done. Do you agree?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>I</em> agree right enough," said Johnson. "I <em>agree</em>.
But if you're coming any of your larks<hr>"</p>

<p>"Can't you <em>see</em> he isn't?" Kathleen put in impatiently.
"He's not a liar&mdash;we none of us are."</p>

<p>"If you're not on, say so," said Gerald, "and I'll find another
policeman with more sense."</p>

<p>"I could split about you being out all night," said Johnson.</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't be so ungentlemanly," said Mabel brightly.
"Don't you be so unbelieving, when we're trying to do you a good
turn."</p>

<p>"If I were you," Gerald advised, "I'd go to the place where the
silver is, with two other men. You could make a nice little ambush
in the wood-yard&mdash;it's close there. And I'd have two or three
more men up trees in the lane to wait for the motor-car."</p>

<p>"You ought to have been in the force, you ought," said Johnson
admiringly; "but s'pose it <em>was</em> a hoax!"</p>

<p>"Well, then you'd have made an ass of yourself &mdash;I don't
suppose it ud be the first time," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Are you on?" said Gerald in haste. "Hold your jaw, Jimmy, you
idiot!"</p>

<p>"<em>Yes</em>," said Johnson.</p>

<p>"Then when you're on duty you go down to the wood-yard, and the
place where you see me blow my nose is <em>the</em> place. The
sacks are tied with string to the posts under the water. You just
stalk by in your dignified beauty and make a note of the spot.
That's where glory waits you, and when Fame elates you and you're
a sergeant, please remember me."</p>

<p>Johnson said he was blessed. He said it more than once, and then
remarked that he was on, and added that he must be off that instant
minute.</p>

<p>Johnson's cottage lies just out of the town beyond the blacksmith's
forge and the children had come to it through the wood. They went
back the same way, and then down through the town, and through
its narrow, unsavoury streets to the towing-path by the timber
yard. Here they ran along the trunks of the big trees, peeped
into the saw-pit, and&mdash;the men were away at dinner and this was
a favourite play place of every boy within miles&mdash;made themselves
a see-saw with a fresh cut, sweet-smelling pine plank and an elm-root.</p>

<p>"What a ripping place!" said Mabel, breathless on the see-saw's
end. "I believe I like this better than pretending games or even
magic."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Jimmy. "Jerry, don't keep sniffing so&mdash;you'll
have no nose left."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," Gerald answered: "I daren't use my hankey
for fear Johnson's on the look-out somewhere unseen. I wish I'd
thought of some other signal." Sniff! "No, nor I shouldn't want
to now if I hadn't got not to. That's what's so rum. The moment
I got down here and remembered what I'd said about the signal
I began to have a cold&mdash;and<hr> Thank goodness! here he is."</p>

<p>The children, with a fine air of unconcern, abandoned the see-saw.</p>

<p>"Follow my leader!" Gerald cried, and ran along a barked oak
trunk, the others following. In and out and round about ran the
file of children, over heaps of logs, under the jutting ends of
piled planks, and just as the policeman's heavy boots trod the
towing-path Gerald halted at the end of a little landing-stage
of rotten boards, with a rickety handrail, cried "Pax!" and blew
his nose with loud fervour.</p>

<p>"Morning," he said immediately.</p>

<p>"Morning," said Johnson. "Got a cold, aint you?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I shouldn't have a cold if I'd got boots like yours," returned
Gerald admiringly. "Look at them. Any one ud know your fairy footstep
a mile off. How do you ever get near enough to any one to arrest
them?" He skipped off the landing-stage, whispered as he passed
Johnson, "Courage, promptitude, and despatch. That's the place,"
and was off again, the active leader of an active procession.</p>

<p>"We've brought a friend home to dinner," said Kathleen, when
Eliza opened the door. "Where's Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Gone to see Yalding Towers. To-day's show day, you know. An'
just you hurry over your dinners. It's my afternoon out, and my
gentleman friend don't like it if he's kept waiting."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll eat like lightning," Gerald promised. "Set
another place, there's an angel."</p>

<p>They kept their word. The dinner&mdash;it was minced veal and potatoes
and rice-pudding, perhaps the dullest food in the world&mdash;was over
in a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mabel, when Eliza and a jug of hot water had
disappeared up the stairs together, "where's the ring? I ought
to put it back."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>GERALD HALTED AT THE END OF A LITTLE LANDING-STAGE
OF ROTTEN BOARDS</em>.]</p>

<p>"I haven't had a turn yet," said Jimmy. "When we find it Cathy
and I ought to have turns same as you and Gerald did."</p>

<p>"When you find it<hr>?" Mabel's pale face turned paler between
her dark locks.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry&mdash;we're all very sorry," began Kathleen, and then
the story of the losing had to be told.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have looked properly," Mabel protested. "It can't
have vanished."</p>

<p>"You don't know what it can do&mdash;no more do we. It's no use getting
your quills up, fair lady. Perhaps vanishing itself is just what
it does do. You see, it came off my hand in the bed. We looked
everywhere."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if <em>I</em> looked?" Mabel's eyes implored
her little hostess. "You see, if it's lost it's my fault. It's
almost the same as stealing. That Johnson would say it was just
the same. I know he would."</p>

<p>"Let's all look again," said Mabel, jumping up. "We <em>were</em>
rather in a hurry this morning."</p>

<p>So they looked, and they looked. In the bed, under the bed, under
the carpet, under the furniture. They shook the curtains, they
explored the corners, and found dust and flue, but no ring. They
looked, and they looked. Everywhere they looked. Jimmy even looked
fixedly at the ceiling, as though he thought the ring might have
bounced up there and stuck. But it hadn't.</p>

<p>"Then," said Mabel at last, "your housemaid must have stolen
it. That's all. I shall tell her I think so."</p>

<p>And she would have done it too, but at that moment the front
door banged and they knew that Eliza had gone forth in all the
glory of her best things to meet her "gentleman friend."</p>

<p>"It's no use" &mdash;Mabel was almost in tears; "look here&mdash;will
you leave me alone? Perhaps you others looking distracts me. And
I'll go over every inch of the room by myself."</p>

<p>"Respecting the emotion of their guest, the kindly charcoal-burners
withdrew," said Gerald. And they closed the door softly from the
outside on Mabel and her search.</p>

<p>They waited for her, of course&mdash;politeness demanded it, and besides,
they had to stay at home to let Mademoiselle in; though it was
a dazzling day, and Jimmy had just remembered that Gerald's pockets
were full of the money earned at the fair, and that nothing had
yet been bought with that money, except a few buns in which he
had had no share. And of course they waited impatiently.</p>

<p>It seemed about an hour, and was really quite ten minutes, before
they heard the bedroom door open and Mabel's feet on the stairs.</p>

<p>"She hasn't found it," Gerald said.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Jimmy asked.</p>

<p>"The way she walks," said Gerald. You can, in fact, almost always
tell whether the thing has been found that people have gone to
look for by the sound of their feet as they return. Mabel's feet
said "No go," as plain as they could speak. And her face confirmed
the cheerless news.</p>

<p>A sudden and violent knocking at the back door prevented any
one from having to be polite about how sorry they were, or fanciful
about being sure the ring would turn up soon.</p>

<p>All the servants except Eliza were away on their holidays, so
the children went together to open the door, because, as Gerald
said, if it was the baker they could buy a cake from him and eat
it for dessert. "That kind of dinner sort of <em>needs</em> dessert,"
he said.</p>

<p>But it was not the baker. When they opened the door they saw
in the paved court where the pump is, and the dust-bin, and the
water-butt, a young man, with his hat very much on one side, his
mouth open under his fair bristly moustache, and his eyes as nearly
round as human eyes can be. He wore a suit of a bright mustard
colour, a blue necktie, and a goldish watch-chain across his waistcoat.
His body was thrown back and his right arm stretched out towards
the door, and his expression was that of a person who is being
dragged somewhere against his will. He looked so strange that
Kathleen tried to shut the door in his face, murmuring, "Escaped
insane." But the door would not close. There was something in
the way.</p>

<p>"Leave go of me!" said the young man.</p>

<p>"Ho yus! I'll leave go of you!" It was the voice of Eliza&mdash;but
no Eliza could be seen.</p>

<p>"Who's got hold of you?" asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>"<em>She</em> has, miss," replied the unhappy stranger.</p>

<p>"Who's she?" asked Kathleen, to gain time, as she afterwards
explained, for she now knew well enough that what was keeping
the door open was Eliza's unseen foot.</p>

<p>"My fyongsay, miss. At least it sounds like her voice, and it
feels like her bones, but something's come over me, miss, an'
I can't see her."</p>

<p>"That's what he keeps on saying," said Eliza's voice. "E's my
gentleman friend; is 'e gone dotty, or is it me?"</p>

<p>"Both, I shouldn't wonder," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Now," said Eliza, "you call yourself a man; you look me in the
face and say you can't see me."</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I can't," said the wretched gentleman friend.</p>

<p>"If <em>I'd</em> stolen a ring," said Gerald, looking at the
sky, "I should go indoors and be quiet, not stand at the back
door and make an exhibition of myself."</p>

<p>"Not much exhibition about her," whispered Jimmy; "good old ring!"</p>

<p>"I haven't stolen _any_thing," said the gentleman friend. "Here,
you leave me be. It's my eyes has gone wrong. Leave go of me,
d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>Suddenly his hand dropped and he staggered back against the water-butt.
Eliza had "left go" of him. She pushed past the children, shoving
them aside with her invisible elbows. Gerald caught her by the
arm with one hand, felt for her ear with the other, and whispered.
"You stand still and don't say a word. If you do<hr>well, what's
to stop me from sending for the police?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: HE <em>STAGGERED BACK AGAINST THE WATER-BUTT</em>.]</p>

<p>Eliza did not know what there was to stop him. So she did as
she was told, and stood invisible and silent, save for a sort
of blowing, snorting noise peculiar to her when she was out of
breath.</p>

<p>The mustard-coloured young man had recovered his balance, and
stood looking at the children with eyes, if possible, rounder
than before.</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> it?" he gasped feebly. "What's up? What's it
all about?"</p>

<p>"If you don't know, I'm afraid we can't tell you," said Gerald
politely.</p>

<p>"Have I been talking very strange-like?" he asked, taking off
his hat and passing his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Very," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't said anything that wasn't good manners," he
said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Kathleen. "You only said your <em>fiancée</em>
had hold of your hand, and that you couldn't see her."</p>

<p>"No more I can."</p>

<p>"No more can we," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't have dreamed it, and then come along here making
a penny show of myself like this, could I?"</p>

<p>"You know best," said Gerald courteously.</p>

<p>"But," the mustard-coloured victim almost screamed, "do you mean
to tell me...."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to tell you anything," said Gerald quite truly,
"but I'll give you a bit of advice. You go home and lie down a
bit and put a wet rag on your head. You'll be all right to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But I haven't<hr>"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> should," said Mabel; "the sun's very hot, you know."</p>

<p>"I feel all right now," he said, "but&mdash;well, I can only say I'm
sorry, that's all I can say. I've never been taken like this before,
miss. I'm not subject to it&mdash;don't you think that. But I could
have sworn Eliza<hr> Aint she gone out to meet me?"</p>

<p>"Eliza's indoors," said Mabel. "She can't come out to meet anybody
to-day."</p>

<p>"You won't tell her about me carrying on this way, will you,
miss? It might set her against me if she thought I was liable
to fits, which I never was from a child."</p>

<p>"We won't tell Eliza anything about you."</p>

<p>"And you'll overlook the liberty?"</p>

<p>"Of course. We know you couldn't help it," said Kathleen. "You
go home and lie down. I'm sure you must need it. Good-afternoon."</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, I'm sure, miss," he said dreamily. "All the
same I can feel the print of her finger-bones on my hand while
I'm saying it. And you won't let it get round to my boss&mdash;my employer
I mean? Fits of all sorts are against a man in any trade."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, it's all right&mdash;<em>goodbye</em>," said every one.
And a silence fell as he went slowly round the water-butt and
the green yard-gate shut behind him. The silence was broken by
Eliza.</p>

<p>"Give me up!" she said. "Give me up to break my heart in a prison
cell!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden splash, and a round wet drop lay on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Thunder shower," said Jimmy; but it was a tear from Eliza.</p>

<p>"Give me up," she went on, "give me up"&mdash;splash&mdash;"but don't let
me be took here in the town where I'm known and respected"&mdash;splash.
"I'll walk ten miles to be took by a strange police&mdash;not Johnson
as keeps company with my own cousin"&mdash;splash. "But I do thank
you for one thing. You didn't tell Elf as I'd stolen the ring.
And I didn't"&mdash;splash&mdash;"I only sort of borrowed it, it being my
day out, and my gentleman friend such a toff, like you can see
for yourselves."</p>

<p>The children had watched, spellbound, the interesting tears that
became visible as they rolled off the invisible nose of the miserable
Eliza. Now Gerald roused himself, and spoke.</p>

<p>"It's no use your talking," he said. "We can't see you!"</p>

<p>"That's what <em>he</em> said," said Eliza's voice, "but<hr>"</p>

<p>"You can't see yourself," Gerald, went on. "Where's your hand?"</p>

<p>Eliza, no doubt, tried to see it, and of course failed; for instantly,
with a shriek that might have brought the police if there had
been any about, she went into a violent fit of hysterics. The
children did what they could, everything that they had read of
in books as suitable to such occasions, but it is extremely difficult
to do the right thing with an invisible housemaid in strong hysterics
and her best clothes. That was why the best hat was found, later
on, to be completely ruined, and why the best blue dress was never
quite itself again. And as they were burning bits of the feather
dusting-brush as nearly under Eliza's nose as they could guess,
a sudden spurt of flame and a horrible smell, as the flame died
between the quick hands of Gerald, showed but too plainly that
Eliza's feather boa had tried to help.</p>

<p>It did help. Eliza "came to" with a deep sob and said, "Don't
burn me real ostrich stole; I'm better now."</p>

<p>They helped her up and she sat down on the bottom step, and the
children explained to her very carefully and quite kindly that
she really was invisible, and that if you steal&mdash;or even borrow&mdash;rings
you can never be sure what will happen to you.</p>

<p>"But 'ave I got to go on stopping like this," she moaned, when
they had fetched the little mahogany looking-glass from its nail
over the kitchen sink, and convinced her that she was really invisible,
"for ever and ever? An' we was to a bin married come Easter. No
one won't marry a gell as 'e can't see. It aint likely."</p>

<p>"No, not for ever and ever," said Mabel kindly, "but you've got
to go through with it&mdash;like measles. I expect you'll be all right
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-night, <em>I</em> think," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"We'll help you all we can, and not tell any one," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Not even the police," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Now let's get Mademoiselle's tea ready," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"And ours," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"No," said Gerald, "we'll have our tea <em>out</em>. We'll have
a picnic and we'll take Eliza. I'll go out and get the cakes."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shan't eat no cake, Master Jerry," said Eliza's voice,
"so don't you think it. You'd see it going down inside my chest.
It wouldn't be what I should call nice of me to have cake showing
through me in the open air. Oh, it's a dreadful judgment&mdash;just
for a borrow!"</p>

<p>They reassured her, set the tea, deputed Kathleen to let in Mademoiselle&mdash;who
came home tired and a little sad, it seemed&mdash;waited for her and
Gerald and the cakes, and started off for Yalding Towers.</p>

<p>"Picnic parties aren't allowed," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"Ours will be," said Gerald briefly. "Now, Eliza, you catch on
to Kathleen's arm and I'll walk behind to conceal your shadow.
My aunt! take your hat off. It makes your shadow look like I don't
know what. People will think we're the county lunatic asylum turned
loose."</p>

<p>It was then that the hat, becoming visible in Kathleen's hand,
showed how little of the sprinkled water had gone where it was
meant to go&mdash;on Eliza's face.</p>

<p>"Me best 'at," said Eliza, and there was a silence with sniffs
in it.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mabel, "you cheer up. Just you think this is
all a dream. It's just the kind of thing you might dream if your
conscience had got pains in it about the ring."</p>

<p>"But will I wake up again?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you'll wake up again. Now we're going to bandage your
eyes and take you through a very small door, and don't you resist,
or we'll bring a policeman into the dream like a shot."</p>

<p>I have not time to describe Eliza's entrance into the cave. She
went head first: the girls propelled and the boys received her.
If Gerald had not thought of tying her hands some one would certainly
have been scratched. As it was Mabel's hand was scraped between
the cold rock and a passionate boot-heel. Nor will I tell you
all that she said as they led her along the fern-bordered gully
and through the arch into the wonderland of Italian scenery. She
had but little language left when they removed her bandage under
a weeping willow where a statue of Diana, bow in hand, stood poised
on one toe, a most unsuitable attitude for archery, I have always
thought.</p>

<p>"Now," said Gerald, "it's all over&mdash;nothing but niceness now
and cake and things."</p>

<p>"It's time we did have our tea," said Jimmy. And it was.</p>

<p>Eliza, once convinced that her chest, though invisible, was not
transparent, and that her companions could not by looking through
it count how many buns she had eaten, made an excellent meal.
So did the others. If you want really to enjoy your tea, have
minced veal and potatoes and rice-pudding for dinner, with several
hours of excitement to follow, and take your tea late.</p>

<p>The soft, cool green and grey of the garden were changing&mdash;the
green grew golden, the shadows black, and the lake where the swans
were mirrored upside down, under the Temple of Phœbus, was bathed
in rosy light from the little fluffy clouds that lay opposite
the sunset.</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> pretty," said Eliza, "just like a picture-postcard,
aint it?&mdash;the tuppenny kind."</p>

<p>"I ought to be getting home," said Mabel.</p>

<p>"I can't go home like this. I'd stay and be a savage and live
in that white hut if it had any walls and doors," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"She means the Temple of Dionysus," said Mabel, pointing to it.</p>

<p>The sun set suddenly behind the line of black fir-trees on the
top of the slope, and the white temple, that had been pink, turned
grey.</p>

<p>"It would be a very nice place to live in even as it is," said
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Draughty," said Eliza, "and law, what a lot of steps to clean!
What they make houses for without no walls to 'em? Who'd live
in<hr>" She broke off, stared, and added: "What's that?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That white thing coming down the steps. Why, it's a young man
in statooary."</p>

<p>"The statues do come alive here, after sunset," said Gerald in
very matter-of-fact tones.</p>

<p>"I see they do." Eliza did not seem at all surprised or alarmed.
"There's another of 'em. Look at them little wings to his feet
like pigeons."</p>

<p>"I expect that's Mercury," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"It's 'Hermes' under the statue that's got wings on its feet,"
said Mabel, "but<hr>"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't see any statues," said Jimmy. "What are you
punching me for?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" Gerald whispered; but he need not have been
so troubled, for all Eliza's attention was with her wandering
eyes that followed hither and thither the quick movements of unseen
statues. "Don't you see? The statues come alive when the sun goes
down&mdash;and you can't see them unless you're invisible&mdash;and <em>I</em>&mdash;if
you <em>do</em> see them you're not frightened&mdash;unless you <em>touch</em>
them."</p>

<p>"Let's get her to touch one and see," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"'E's lep' into the water," said Eliza in a rapt voice. "My,
can't he swim neither! And the one with the pigeons' wings is
flying all over the lake having larks with 'im. I do call that
pretty. It's like cupids as you see on wedding-cakes. And here's
another of 'em, a little chap with long ears and a baby deer galloping
alongside! An' look at the lady with the biby, throwing it up
and catching it like as if it was a ball. I wonder she ain't afraid.
But it's pretty to see 'em."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'E'S <em>LEP' INTO THE WATER," SAID ELIZA IN
A RAPT VOICE. "MY, CAN'T HE SWIM NEITHER</em>!"]</p>

<p>The broad park lay stretched before the children in growing greyness
and a stillness that deepened. Amid the thickening shadows they
could see the statues gleam white and motionless. But Eliza saw
other things. She watched in silence presently, and they watched
silently, and the evening fell like a veil that grew heavier and
blacker. And it was night. And the moon came up above the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Eliza suddenly, "here's the dear little boy with
the deer&mdash;he's coming right for me, bless his heart!"</p>

<p>Next moment she was screaming, and her screams grew fainter and
there was the sound of swift boots on gravel.</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Gerald; "she touched it, and then she was frightened.
Just like I was. Run! she'll send every one in the town mad if
she gets there like that. Just a voice and boots! Run! Run!"</p>

<p>They ran. But Eliza had the start of them. Also when she ran
on the grass they could not hear her footsteps and had to wait
for the sound of leather on far-away gravel. Also she was driven
by fear, and fear drives fast.</p>

<p>She went, it seemed, the nearest way, invisibly through the waxing
moonlight, seeing she only knew what amid the glades and groves.</p>

<p>"I'll stop here; see you to-morrow," gasped Mabel, as the loud
pursuers followed Eliza's clatter across the terrace. "She's gone
through the stable yard."</p>

<p>"The back way," Gerald panted as they turned the corner of their
own street, and he and Jimmy swung in past the water-butt.</p>

<p>An unseen but agitated presence seemed to be fumbling with the
locked back-door. The church clock struck the half-hour.</p>

<p>"Half-past nine," Gerald had just breath to say. "Pull at the
ring. Perhaps it'll come off now."</p>

<p>He spoke to the bare doorstep. But it was Eliza, dishevelled,
breathless, her hair coming down, her collar crooked, her dress
twisted and disordered, who suddenly held out a hand&mdash;a hand that
they could see; and in the hand, plainly visible in the moonlight,
the dark circle of the magic ring.</p>

<p>"'Alf a mo!" said Eliza's gentleman friend next morning. He was
waiting for her when she opened the door with pail and hearthstone
in her hand. "Sorry you couldn't come out yesterday."</p>

<p>"So'm I." Eliza swept the wet flannel along the top step. "What
did you do?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: IT <em>WAS ELIZA, DISHEVELLED, BREATHLESS, HER
HAIR COMING DOWN, HER COLLAR CROOKED, HER DRESS TWISTED AND DISORDERED,
WHO SUDDENLY HELD OUT A HAND</em>.]</p>

<p>"I 'ad a bit of a headache," said the gentleman friend. "I laid
down most of the afternoon. What were you up to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing pertickler," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"Then it was all a dream," she said, when he was gone; "but it'll
be a lesson to me not to meddle with anybody's old ring again
in a hurry."</p>

<p>"So they didn't tell 'er about me behaving like I did," said
he as he went&mdash;"sun, I suppose&mdash;like our Army in India. I hope
I aint going to be liable to it, that's all!"</p>
