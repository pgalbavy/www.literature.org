<p>Capt. Asbury drew a cigar from his pocket and lit it, first offering
one to each of his companions. He puffed in silence for a minute
or two, evidently absorbed in thought. He was a veteran of the
civil war, and had learned to be cool in dangerous crises.</p>

<p>"Hawkridge," he remarked, removing his cigar, "you are right
in the main, although not wholly so."</p>

<p>"I await correction."</p>

<p>"Doubtless it is all true what you say about the festive rustlers
roaming up and down the land seeking whom they may devour, but
you forget that, leaving out the quarter of a hundred from the
Lone Star State, there are also other bands of stockmen abroad.
Now, if we could effect a junction with one or two of those companies,
why, you'll admit, the aspect of affairs will be changed."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably; but consider how slight the chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I think the prospect is good. Now, if you'll
be kind enough to level your glass to the eastward, possibly you
will observe something interesting."</p>

<p>Both young men quickly turned their heads in the direction indicated,
and there, sure enough, was descried a body of horsemen, probably
a mile distant, approaching on a gallop.</p>

<p>Hawkridge levelled his glass. While thus engaged, Capt. Asbury
signalled to his men to mount and be ready to move on a moment's
call.</p>

<p>It was well to be ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>Dick Hawkridge studied the horsemen closely for some minutes
without speaking. Then, with his eye still at the glass, he repeated
slowly, as if to himself:</p>

<p>"There are thirteen of them, and the spotted horse at the head
I am sure belongs to Ira Inman; the whole party are rustlers."</p>

<p>He lowered the binocular and looked at the captain, adding:</p>

<p>"I suspected it; their party is but a little stronger than yours,
for Mont and I will stand with you, but it seems to me it would
be foolish to risk a fight in the open."</p>

<p>"I am willing to retreat, but I don't intend to be run out of
Wyoming by all the rustlers between Sheridan and Cheyenne. I am
willing, however," he added, with a smile, "to make a strategical
movement to the rear until we strike some place where there's
a show for defence; do you know of any such place?"</p>

<p>"My house is well fitted for that, and is not far off."</p>

<p>"All right; lead on."</p>

<p>By this time the rest of the party had ridden to the top of the
hill, where the situation was quickly made clear to them. They
looked off at the party of rustlers, and several expressed the
wish that the captain would stay and fight them; but he replied
that they were quite certain to get enough of fighting before
they were many days older, and he followed Hawkridge.</p>

<p>At sight of the flight, the rustlers uttered tantalizing shouts
and discharged their Winchesters in the air. At the same time
they increased the speed of their animals; but, as they were no
better mounted than the stockmen, there was little chance of overtaking
them.</p>

<p>The surface was undulating, the ground being well covered with
verdure even thus early in the spring. Sometimes pursuers and
fugitives were out of sight of each other for a minute or two,
but not long enough to affect the situation.</p>

<p>The course was northwest, and Hawkridge was hopeful that they
would reach his ranch in an hour or a little more. And this they
probably would have done had they not been interrupted, or rather
checked, by the unexpected appearance of a third company of horsemen,
almost directly in front of the stockmen.</p>

<p>"It may be they are friends," said Capt. Asbury, instantly bringing
his horse down to a walk, as did the others.</p>

<p>But the hope was delusive. A brief scrutiny of the strangers
through the glass by Dick Hawkridge left no doubt that they, too,
were rustlers, probably engaged on the same errand as Inman and
his men.</p>

<p>This, of course, overthrew the plan of taking refuge at the ranch
of Hawkridge, with a view of defending themselves, for to push
on insured a collision with the party in front. They seemed to
be about as numerous as Inman's company, and as the latter were
sure to arrive before anything could be accomplished by the most
spirited attack on the rustlers, it would have been folly to incur
such a risk.</p>

<p>The most obvious course was to turn to the left, with no special
object except to reach some place that could be used as a means
of defence. In a country with such a varied surface it ought not
to take long to find a refuge.</p>

<p>Dick Hawkridge, when leading the way to his home, acted as guide,
and now that the change was made he continued to do so because
of his familiarity with the country. Beside him rode his friend,
Mont Sterry, with Capt. Asbury and the rest following in loose
order.</p>

<p>It was an interesting question as to how Inman and the others
would act upon meeting, and the stockmen watched for the junction.</p>

<p>At the moment the abrupt turn was made in the course of the fugitives
the two parties of rustlers did not see each other, a precipitous
ridge preventing. They must have been puzzled, therefore, to understand
the cause of the sudden change in the line of flight.</p>

<p>The mystery, however, was speedily cleared up, and the rustlers
greeted each other with ringing cheers, adding a few derisive
shouts to the fleeing stockmen. They were seen to mingle for a
short time only, while they discussed the situation. Then the
company, increased to more than a score, galloped after the cattlemen.</p>

<p>A fight was inevitable, for the flight and pursuit could not
continue indefinitely. Brave and confident, the rustlers were
ardent for the opportunity, while Capt. Asbury and his men were
equally eager to come upon some place which would do something
toward equalizing the strength of the combatants.</p>

<p>It was humiliating thus to flee before the very men whom he had
set out to arrest, but what veteran has not been obliged to do
humiliating things in the course of his career?</p>

<p>"This flight can't continue much longer," quietly remarked Monteith
Sterry to Hawkridge, at his side.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The men are dissatisfied and are unwilling to keep it up. We
have let those fellows approach so near that their bullets come
uncomfortably close.</p>

<p>"Capt. Asbury is growing impatient; I shouldn't wonder if he
gives the order to stop and have it out with them. It will be
warm work if we do, but over that next ridge I think we shall
gain sight of a good place for making a stand."</p>

<p>Something in the appearance of the surroundings was familiar
to Sterry, but he could not identify them.</p>

<p>Just then two of the rustlers fired their guns, and the pinge
of one of the bullets was plainly heard. Sterry looked around
and saw Capt. Asbury compress his lips and shake his head; he
did not like the way things were going. A crisis was at hand.</p>

<p>The top of the ridge being attained, all saw a large structure
below, and not far off.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize it?" asked Hawkridge, with a smile.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;why, yes; is it possible?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know it, for, if I am not mistaken, you are considerably
interested in one member of the family."</p>

<p>"I never supposed we were so near Fred Whitney's home," was the
amazed comment of Sterry, who was in doubt whether, under the
circumstances, he ought to be pleased or not.</p>

<p>"There's where we'll make a stand," called out Capt. Asbury,
"and let the music begin."</p>
