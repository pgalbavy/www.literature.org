The Witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy;
but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the Tin Woodman's
button-hole as growing upon the bush. For no one knew the rose and Mombi to
be one, and now that she was without the gates of the City her chances of
escaping altogether from Glinda were much improved.
<P>
"But there is no hurry," thought Mombi. "I will wait awhile and enjoy the
humiliation of this Sorceress when she finds I have outwitted her." So
throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the Woodman's bosom, and in the
morning, when Glinda summoned our friends to a consultation, Nick Chopper
carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent.
<P>
"For some reason," said Glinda, "we have failed to find this cunning old
Mombi; so I fear our expedition will prove a failure. And for that I am
sorry, because without our assistance little Ozma will never be rescued and
restored to her rightful position as Queen of the Emerald City"
<P>
"Do not let us give up so easily," said the Pumpkinhead. "Let us do
something else."
<P>
"Something else must really be done," replied Glinda, with a smile. "yet I
cannot understand how I have been defeated so easily by an old Witch who
knows far less of magic than I do myself."
<P>
"While we are on the ground I believe it would be wise for us to conquer the
Emerald City for Princess Ozma, and find the girl afterward," said the
Scarecrow." And while the girl remains hidden I will gladly rule in her
place, for I understand the business of ruling much better than Jinjur
does."
<P>
"But I have promised not to molest Jinjur," objected Glinda.
<P>
"Suppose you all return with me to my kingdom -- or Empire, rather," said
the Tin Woodman, politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his
arm. "It will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle, where
there is room enough and to spare. And if any of you wish to be nickel-
plated, my valet will do it free of all expense."
<P>
While the Woodman was speaking Glinda's eyes had been noting the rose in his
button-hole, and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower
tremble slightly. This quickly aroused her suspicions, and in a moment more
the Sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a
transformation of old Mombi. At the same instant Mombi knew she was
discovered and must quickly plan an escape, and as transformations were easy
to her she immediately took the form of a Shadow and glided along the wall
of the tent toward the entrance, thinking thus to disappear.
<P>
But Glinda had not only equal cunning, but far more experience than the
Witch. So the Sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the Shadow,
and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that Mombi could
not find a crack big
enough to creep through. The Scarecrow and his friends were greatly
surprised at Glinda's actions; for none of them had noted the Shadow. But
the Sorceress said to them:
<P>
"Remain perfectly quiet, all of you! For the old Witch is even now with us
in this tent, and I hope to capture her."
<P>
These words so alarmed Mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a
shadow to a Black Ant, in which shape she crawled along the ground, seeking
a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body.
<P>
Fortunately, the ground where the tent had been pitched, being Just before
the city gates, was hard and smooth; and while the Ant still crawled about,
Glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture But, Just
as her hand was descending, the Witch, now fairly frantic with fear, made
her last transformation, and in the form of a huge Griffin sprang through
the wall of the tent -- tearing the silk asunder in her rush -- and in a
moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind.
<P>
Glinda did not hesitate to follow. She sprang upon the back of the Saw-Horse
and cried:
<P>
"Now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive! Run -- run -- run!"
<P>
The Saw-Horse ran. Like a flash he followed the
Griffin, his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of
a star. Before our friends could recover from their surprise both the
Griffin and the Saw-Horse had dashed out of sight.
<P>
"Come! Let us follow!" cried the Scarecrow.
<P>
They ran to the place where the Gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard.
<P>
"Fly!" commanded Tip, eagerly.
<P>
"Where to?" asked the Gump, in its calm voice.
<P>
"I don't know," returned Tip, who was very nervous at the delay; "but if you
will mount into the air I think we can discover which way Glinda has gone."
<P>
"Very well," returned the Gump, quietly; and it spread its great wings and
mounted high into the air.
<P>
Far away, across the meadows, they could now see two tiny specks, speeding
one after the other; and they knew these specks must be the Griffin and the
Saw-Horse. So Tip called the Gump's attention to them and bade the creature
try to overtake the Witch and the Sorceress. But, swift as was the Gump's
flight, the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet, and within a few
moments were blotted out against the dim horizon.
<P>
"Let us continue to follow them, nevertheless," said the Scarecrow. "for the
Land of Oz is of small extent, and sooner or later they must both come to a
halt."
<P>
Old Mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a Griffin, for
its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of
other animals. But she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the Saw-
Horse, whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed.
Therefore, after an hour's hard running, the Griffin's breath began to fail,
and it panted and gasped painfully, and moved more slowly than before. Then
it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands.
But its tired feet sank far
into the sand, and in a few minutes the Griffin fell forward, completely
exhausted, and lay still upon the desert waste.
<P>
Glinda came up a moment later, riding the still vigorous Saw-Horse; and
having unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the Sorceress threw
it over the head of the panting and helpless Griffin, and so destroyed the
magical power of Mombi's transformation.
<P>
For the animal, with one fierce shudder, disappeared from view, while in its
place was discovered the form of the old Witch, glaring savagely at the
serene and beautiful face of the Sorceress.
