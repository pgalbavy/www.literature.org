<p>"Let's make some candy.  It's too hot to play."</p>

<p>Susie and the twins were sitting idly on a great, shaggy, redwood
log in the scanty shade of the house, fanning themselves as briskly
as their tired arms would move, and longing for the cool of sundown.</p>

<p>Irene looked startled at the older sister's suggestion, and began,
"Tabitha<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know she made us promise not to get into mischief," Susie
impatiently interrupted her, "but taffy ain't mischief.  We'll
make a big batch so's there will be plenty for the others when
they get back."</p>

<p>"It's so hot," objected Inez, as Susie turned to her for approval.</p>

<p>"We'll use the gasolene stove."</p>

<p>"But you've never lighted it.  How'll you<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Irene, you make me tired!  Don't you s'pose I know how? 
Haven't I watched mamma and Tabitha hundreds of times?  Guess
I can manage it if Mercy can.  Come on, Inez!"</p>

<p>"Do you know how to make taffy?" questioned the undaunted Irene,
following the other two into the sweltering kitchen.</p>

<p>"Course!  Molasses and sugar and vinegar and butter.  Ask me
something hard."</p>

<p>"Tabitha measures 'em."</p>

<p>"So shall I.  You go fetch the m'lasses jug and a cup.  Inez,
bring the vinegar and butter, and I'll measure things after I
get the stove a-going."  Mopping her face and bustling energetically
about the small room, Susie marshalled her forces and set to work
with contagious enthusiasm.  All three donned huge aprons, hunted
up long-handled spoons, and rattled among the neat array of pots
and pans until it sounded as if a whole regiment had been turned
loose in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The stove was lighted without any trouble, much to the relief
of the breathless trio, and the candy making was soon in progress. 
Sugar was measured and molasses spilled with reckless abandon
over table, floor and stove, in their hurry to get their delectable
sweet on cooking before the rest of the family should return from
their day's outing and interfere, for, secretly, each be-aproned
girl, paddling in the pot with her sticky spoon and dribbling
syrup wherever she ran, felt that she was not strictly obeying
Tabitha's parting injunction, and was anxious to have a peace
offering ready when she returned with the rest of her brood.</p>

<p>They had gone for a drive to the river, and as there was not
room in the light wagon for all the large family, Susie and the
twins had been bribed to remain at home with the promise of ice-cream
sodas at the little drug-store.  However, that unusual treat had
disappeared long ago down the three eager throats, and they had
begun to rue their bargain when Susie's inspiration fired them
with enthusiasm once more.</p>

<p>"I wish we had some nuts," panted perspiring Inez, stirring the
bubbling mess in the kettle so vigorously that a great spatter
flew up and struck Irene on the hand.</p>

<p>"Ooo!" screeched the unfortunate victim.  "What made you do that?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it a-purpose," indignantly denied her twin.  "Stop
your jumping and suck it off."</p>

<p>Irene obediently thrust the smarting wound into her mouth, and
immediately let out another howl of anguish, for the sticky mass
had burned the little tongue sadly, and the tears rained down
the rosy cheeks unchecked while the dismayed sisters racked their
brains for some soothing remedy to deaden the pain.</p>

<p>"Try this," suggested Susie, hurrying out of the pantry with
a can of baking powder in her hand, vaguely recalling that some
kind of white powder used in cooking was good for burns.</p>

<p>"I will not," sobbed Irene angrily.  "You don't know what it
will do. You're just guessing."</p>

<p>"Gloriana put coal oil on Toady's foot," timidly began Inez,
half distracted at having been the cause of all her sister's woe.</p>

<p>"And you think I'll stick my <em>tongue</em> in <em>that</em>?"
roared the usually gentle twin so savagely that both her companions
fell silent, perplexed at the unhappy situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bubbling syrup had been forgotten, and with an
ominous hiss and a pungent odor, the seething mass boiled over
the top of the kettle and was promptly licked up by the eager
flames of the stove.  A great cloud of smoke filled the kitchen,
and the paralyzed girls awoke to their danger with a sickening
horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" they screamed in frenzy.  "The house will catch! 
We'll all be burned up!  What will mamma say?"</p>

<p>"Hush!  Shut up!  Give me your apron!" commanded an authoritative
voice behind them, and a big, shabby stranger rushed past them,
snatched Susie's apron, gave a deft twist to the flaming burner,
seized the smoking kettle, and vanished through the kitchen door
before any of the sisters realized what had happened.  He was
soon back with the blackened pot in his hands and a reassuring
smile on his lips.  "It's all right, kids," he announced cheerily,
noting the terror in their faces.  "No harm's done.  It won't
take but a few minutes to clean up that stove and pan and no one
will be the wiser.  You are housekeeping by yourselves to-day,
I see."  His quick, restless, eager eyes had noted the tell-tale
signs of mischief about him before he hazarded that remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes!" breathed Susie in great relief.  "Tabitha's taken
the rest of the children down to the river, and we're all alone."</p>

<p>"The river?"</p>

<p>"The Colorado.  We often go there when we can get the assayer's
horses, but the wagon won't hold us all, so we three stayed at
home to-day."</p>

<p>"And had ice-cream sodas for being good," added Irene.</p>

<p>"We <em>wanted</em> to make some taffy," mourned Inez, ruefully
eyeing the blackened mass which the mysterious stranger was deftly
removing from the stove and floor.</p>

<p>"'Twas so lonesome here by ourselves," supplemented Susie apologetically,
remembering that she was responsible for the candy suggestion.</p>

<p>"So 'while the cat's away the mice will play'," chuckled the
man, beginning a vigorous scraping of the sticky kettle.</p>

<p>"Why, how did you know her name was Catt?" cried Irene in amazement.</p>

<p>"Goosie!" exclaimed Susie sarcastically.</p>

<p>"He didn't know.  That's not what he meant.  But truly, mister,
I don't think Tabitha would have minded a bit if our candy had
come out all right.  As 'tis, we've wasted such a lot of m'lasses
and sugar that I reckon she'll scold<hr>"</p>

<p>"If she ever finds it out," broke in Inez.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;<em>if</em> she ever finds it out," chuckled the
man again.  "Who is this mysterious Tabitha that you are so scared
of?"</p>

<p>"We ain't <em>scared</em> of her," protested Susie loyally. 
"Her name is Tabitha Catt, and she's taking care of us while mamma
is with papa at the hospital in Los Angeles.  She's only a girl
herself, but we promised to mind her so mamma could go, and not
fret about us all the time, and we're trying hard to keep our
promise."</p>

<p>"But sometimes we forget," said truthful Irene.  "We oughtn't
to have made that candy, 'cause we told her we wouldn't get into
mischief while she was gone.  I guess that's why it burnt up."</p>

<p>"I guess it's no such thing!" Inez contradicted hotly.  "You
made such a fuss over nothing that Susie and me forgot to watch
it and it boiled over."</p>

<p>"I guess you'd have made a fuss if I'd blistered your hand like
you did mine," cried Irene in great indignation, suddenly remembering
her grievance, and affectionately regarding the white blister
on her plump hand.  "Then on top of that you told me to suck it
off, when you knew it was boiling hot and would skin my whole
mouth."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" interrupted the stranger, seeing that a quarrel was
imminent.  "Now don't get mad all at once.  I've a proposition
to make to you<hr>"</p>

<p>"A what?" asked Susie, glad she had taken no part in the flare-up
between the twins.</p>

<p>"A bargain.  I'll make you a mess of candy that'll pop your eyes
out if you will give me a square meal,&mdash;something to eat, you
know, and plenty of it.  I'm hungry as the deuce, and candy ain't
very filling.  Is it a go?"</p>

<p>Susie looked at her crestfallen companions, and they looked at
her.</p>

<p>"There were no potatoes left from dinner," began Irene.</p>

<p>"But there's any number of cans of stuff in the pantry," said
Inez hastily.</p>

<p>"Salmon and sardines and veal loaf and corned beef and vegetables,"
added Susie hopefully, yet fearful lest the menu should not prove
sufficiently tempting to the queer, unexpected, unknown visitor. 
"And Tabitha cut the cake for dinner."</p>

<p>"Besides cookies and crackers and bread," murmured Irene, seeing
reproof in her sisters' eyes, and feeling that she had been inhospitable
to their hungry guest.</p>

<p>"Good!" promptly answered the man.  "I reckon we'll make out. 
Just open a tin of salmon, make a pot of strong coffee, and bring
on your bread and cake and sauce&mdash;lots of it, now, for I haven't
had a bite to eat since last night.  Lost my money, you know,
and it hurts a decent fellow's pride to beg."</p>

<p>The trio nodded sympathetically, and hurried to do his bidding,
while he rapidly measured out fresh supplies of sugar and syrup,
and briskly began stirring the mass over the fire, talking all
the while.  "I just happened to be passing when I smelled your
stuff burning, and thinks I, now there's trouble in there.  Just
then you all commenced screaming, and I was sure the house was
a-fire, so I rushed in to help.  Good gracious, but I was scared
for a minute when I see the flames jumping so high.  You might
have had an explosion any minute."</p>

<p>"Yes," gravely agreed the girls, the look of terror returning
to their eyes.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you, I reckon the house would have burned
down, and it's the only one we've got," said Irene.</p>

<p>He nodded.  "I understand, and so I thought you wouldn't begrudge
me a bite to eat, after I had put out the fire and cleaned up
the clutter so Tabitha wouldn't know that you had been in mischief."</p>

<p>"Course we're glad to give you something to eat," Inez again
hastily interrupted.  "'Specially when you are making us some
more candy.  Are you ready for your&mdash;lunch&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"In a jiffy.  Just grease a pan for this dope and I'll pour it
out to cool.  Bet it beats yours all hollow.  There!  Set it in
the window&mdash;so!  Now, I'll sample your larder.  Looks fine and
smells bully.  Which store is best here in town?"</p>

<p>"Brinkley's," promptly answered the trio, with longing eyes fixed
upon the golden flood of syrup cooling in the window.</p>

<p>"Though Dawley's is bigger," added Irene.</p>

<p>"Do they make much money?"</p>

<p>"They ought to.  Prices are high enough," answered Susie with
a comically grown-up air.</p>

<p>"Most of the miners trade at Dawley's, 'cause he don't hurry
'em so about paying," said Inez naively.  "But the Carsons and
Catts and Dr. Hayes, and those folks buy at Brinkley's, 'cause
his stuff is nicer."</p>

<p>"We <em>did</em> trade there," began Irene, but Susie interrupted,
"Most of our stuff comes from Los Angeles now.  It's cheaper to
trade that way, and anyhow, papa knows the man real well, and
now that he's sick in the hospital, he doesn't have to worry about
pay day all the time, for this man will wait till he is well enough
to work again."</p>

<p>"When is pay day?" casually inquired the man.  "I mean how often
does it come?"</p>

<p>"Once a month&mdash;the fifteenth."</p>

<p>The stranger's eyes glittered with satisfaction, and he muttered,
"The fifteenth,&mdash;that's to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Susie.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking," he replied, glancing uneasily from one
bright face to the other to see if any of the children had caught
his indiscreet remark.  "By the way, who lives in that little,
unpainted house on the edge of town?"  He pointed vaguely over
his shoulder, and the sisters looked at each other in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"The pest house?" suggested Irene.</p>

<p>"The Ramsey place?" said Inez questioningly.</p>

<p>"The haunted house?" ventured Susie.  "You see, there are so
many unpainted houses on the edge of town."</p>

<p>"The haunted house!" laughed the stranger incredulously.  "Whoever
heard tell of a haunted house in a mining camp!"</p>

<p>"Silver Bow has one," stoutly asserted the twins.</p>

<p>"Where?  Which one?  I confess I am curious."</p>

<p>"It's the last one on the East End Lode," replied Susie with
dignity, feeling that the reputation of her town was at stake.</p>

<p>"The queer old shack beyond Tabitha's," added Inez.</p>

<p>"There are only three houses in that hollow," explained Irene. 
"The Carson's big house, the Catt's littler one, and this haunted
house."</p>

<p>"What haunts it?" jeered the man, pushing back from the table
and glancing sharply down the trail toward town.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a ghost," the twins half whispered.</p>

<p>"A man killed himself there once," said Susie.</p>

<p>"Or was murdered," shuddered Inez.</p>

<p>"Or else he just died," put in practical-minded Irene.  "Anyway,
they found him there dead."</p>

<p>"And sometimes now folks hear queer things there."</p>

<p>"And see lights."</p>

<p>"Tabitha never has," Irene declared.  "And she lives nearest
it."</p>

<p>"Well, 't any rate, it's haunted and no one ever goes there now,
not even Tabitha, who ain't afraid of a <em>thing</em>."</p>

<p>The stranger rose slowly to his feet, yawned as if bored by their
chatter, picked up his hat, and started for the door; then paused,
and casually surveying the pan of taffy on the window sill, remarked,
"Believe if I was you, I'd eat that all up before the rest of
the folks get back.  There's just about enough for three, and
I've a notion that Miss Tabitha will think you didn't keep your
promise very well if she ever finds out how near you came to setting
the house a-fire.  She'll never dare trust you again.  It might
be well not to mention that I dropped in, either.  Tramps aren't
often welcome visitors, even in a mining camp, you know.  But
I appreciate your dinner, and thank you kindly.  Good-day, ladies."</p>

<p>"Good-day," they echoed mechanically, and with puzzled eyes watched
him disappear in the direction of the railroad station on the
flats.  Then they faced each other.</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose we better&mdash;" began Susie slowly.</p>

<p>"Not tell?" ventured Inez.</p>

<p>"And eat all the candy ourselves?" added Irene.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause while three active brains worked furiously.</p>

<p>Then Susie sighed, "I b'lieve he's right.  Tabitha would never
trust us again.  We better keep still about the whole thing."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to hurry and clear up this mess," said Irene. 
"We can hide the candy until later, but this table would give
everything away."</p>

<p>So the trio flew to work again, put away the remains of the tramp's
dinner, washed the telltale dishes, and had the kitchen in its
usual spick and span order when the rest of the large family returned
an hour later from their sojourn to the river.  If their consciences
pricked them a little for their deception, they said nothing,
not even to each other; and it was several days before the young
housekeeper discovered their secret.</p>
