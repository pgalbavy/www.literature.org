<p>The final departure of Bulpert erased a troublesome detail in the
girl's life, and she felt suitably thankful; another disappearance gave
her a sensation of regret.  She had thought seriously of the patient,
elderly man whom she had now to look upon as her parent, and planned a
scheme, to be prefaced by something in the nature of a brief lecture,
involving pecuniary sacrifice; her game of bricks was knocked over by
the hand of Fate, and Gertie Higham had to put them back into the box.
Mrs. Mills told her much that had hitherto been a secret shared by Mr.
Trew.
</p>
<p>"Quite a good sort he was, my dear, until your poor young mother went,
and then--well, Mr. Trew met him when he came out of Wormwood Scrubbs,
and your father's first words were, 'Don't let the kid ever know!'
Meaning yourself.  So we kept it from you, you see, and I hope you
don't blame us.  No doubt, he recognized you, because you're so much
like your poor mother, only more stylish, and of course better
educated, and I suppose he felt as though he had to speak.  Very likely
he won't ever let you see him again."
</p><p>"Wish I knew where to find him now."
</p><p>"He was like a lot of the others.  Not really bad, you understand, but
just rather easily led; and because he thought everything was going
against him, he became reckless.  And he belonged to the old days when
once in prison meant always in prison, and no one ever thought that a
man who had made a single blunder could be reformed.  I often used to
think," declared Mrs. Mills, "that something ought to be done, but of
course I had my business to look after."
</p><p>"You found time to look after me, aunt."
</p><p>"If you could realize," argued the other earnestly, "what a dear baby
you was then, you wouldn't trouble to give me any credit for that."
She hesitated.  "What I've always hoped," lowering her voice, "that
some day I might see another one like you."
</p><p>"Madame's case," said Gertie, "is a warning to me.  I want the right
kind of husband, or none at all!"
</p><p>From Clarence Mills, calling at Praed Street, came news that Lady
Douglass had been instructed to go abroad so soon as she became well
enough to endure the journey; to his great concern, Miss Loriner was
instructed to accompany her.  Gertie asked for further information, and
Clarence replied that Henry Douglass had not given up the office in Old
Quebec Street; indeed, he recently entered a competition for plans of a
provincial art gallery, and his portrait was in some journal consequent
on the decision of the judges.  Gertie presumed that Clarence did not
happen to have this with him; Clarence found the cutting in his
letter-case and presented it.  (Later, it was mounted carefully and
placed in a small frame, and given a position upon her dressing-table.)
Clarence's book was out, and he had just seen a copy at Paddington,
with a card bearing the words, "Tremendously Thrilling."
</p><p>On another point, Clarence was able to announce that Henry had held
something like a court-martial at Ewelme, with all concerned present.
Jim Langham gave evidence; and Lady Douglass, when her turn came,
suggested the key had been placed in her bag by Miss Loriner.  Upon
which Miss Loriner declared it would be impossible, in view of this
remark, to give her company to Beaulieu; and Lady Douglass, without any
further hesitation, confessed the truth, urging, in excuse, that it was
but natural in this world to look after oneself, adding a caution to
the effect that anything in the nature of a scene would now mar the
work of the London specialist.  Henry's mother, it appeared, was in
favour of taking the risk.
</p><p>"I don't want to see her punished," remarked Gertie.  "So long as he
knows I was not to blame, I'm perfectly satisfied."
</p><p>Clarence had private audience with Mrs. Mills before going, and, as a
result, Sarah, the temporary assistant at the party, came to Praed
Street daily; Mrs. Mills admitted that, seeing her niece frequently,
any want of colour might not be so apparent to her as to any one who
saw the girl less often.  Sarah's objections to living in were easy to
meet; the only other provision was that liberty should be given if her
services were required for "Puss in Boots" during the Christmas period.
An excellent worker, Sarah left nothing to be done at the end of the
day, and Gertie, arriving home after the stress of business at Great
Titchfield Street, was able to rest in the parlour, or give assistance
in the shop.
</p><p>She was making out orders for Christmas cards at the newspaper counter
one night (the popular remark of customers at this period was "Ain't
the evenings drawing in something awful!") when a man rushed in and
looked around in a dazed, frightened manner.  He muttered indistinctly
some explanation, and was going off, when Gertie called to him.
</p><p>"Thought it was a bar," he said confusedly.  "My mistake."
</p><p>"Come here, Mr. Langham," she ordered, putting down her book.  "Sit on
the high chair."  He obeyed, blinking up at the light.  "What's the
matter?"
</p><p>Jim Langham was trembling.  He leaned across, and whispered.
</p><p>"You've seen a ghost?" she echoed.  "Don't be so stupid.  There are no
such things nowadays, especially in a neighbourhood like this.  Where
did you come across it?"
</p><p>"Near--near the station.  I've only just come from Wallingford.  I was
hurrying up the slope on the right-hand side, and about to turn into
the hotel, when across the way--"
</p><p>He looked around apprehensively, and caught sight of Mrs. Mills peeping
over the half blind of the parlour door.  Gertie sent her a reassuring
nod, and she disappeared.
</p><p>"What have I done," he wailed appealingly, "that everybody should spy?
A police sergeant gazed at me in a most peculiar way about two minutes
ago.  What does it mean, Miss Higham?"
</p><p>"Doesn't matter what it means," she said sharply, "so long as you've
done nothing wrong.  Pull yourself together, Mr. Langham.  Why don't
you knock off the drink, and be a man?"
</p><p>"I'll go and get some now."
</p><p>"It will do you no good.  You've been in the habit of taking it when
you didn't need it, and you've spoilt it as a remedy.  Stay here for a
while, and calm yourself."
</p><p>"Bad enough," he complained, "when living people begin to track you
about, but when the others start doing it--!"  He shivered.  Gertie
went to the parlour, and asked her aunt to make some coffee.
</p><p>"Has Lady Douglass gone away yet?"
</p><p>"Now why, apropos of nothing, should you mention her name?"
</p><p>"You never did have much sense about you, and now you seem to have none
at all.  Concentrate your mind.  Think!  What was the question I put to
you?"  He admitted he could not recall it, and she repeated the inquiry.
</p><p>"Leaves early to-morrow morning," he answered; "that is partly why I
have come up to town.  I don't want to see her again before she goes."
Jim Langham rested elbows on the counter, and covered eyes with his
hands.  "Have you ever," he asked, "in the course of your existence,
met with a bigger fool than me?"
</p><p>"To be quite candid," said Gertie, "I don't think I have."
</p><p>She fetched the cup from the back room, and brought it to him.  He
sipped at the hot beverage, and appeared to recover.
</p><p>"Do you mind if I smoke?" he asked courteously.
</p><p>She laughed.  "This is half a tobacconist's shop!"
</p><p>"Quite so," remarked Jim Langham, taking a cigar from his case.  "I
say," he went on confidentially, taking the movable gas jet, "do you
know anything about the Argentine?"
</p><p>"Mr. Trew might tell you something about it if he were here.  I don't
take any interest in horse-racing."
</p><p>"It's a place in South America," he said.  "I've an idea of getting out
there, and making a fresh start.  But I'm in the state of mind that
prevents me from knowing how to set about it.  It would be a great
kindness on your part to give me some assistance."
</p><p>"I want all the money I've saved up."
</p><p>He placed his hand in his waistcoat pocket and pulled out sovereigns.
Gertie, taking a newspaper, turned the pages to find the shipping
advertisements.
</p><p>"'The R. M. S. P.,'" she read.  "I thought that meant you had to reply
to an invitation.  Oh, I see.  Royal Mail Steam Packet.  Here's the
address.  There's a boat leaving to-morrow.  Would you like to catch
that?"
</p><p>"The earlier the better," he cried.  "I must get away at once.  Now,
who can do it all?"
</p><p>A lad came for a packet of cigarettes, and, as Gertie served him, Mr.
Trew entered the doorway; his cheerful salutation caused Jim Langham to
start.  Trew announced, joyously, that he was up to the neck in
trouble; for failing to see a young constable's warning in Oxford
Street, he had been suspended from duty for a period of three days.
</p><p>"As I told him, if a driver took notice of all the baby hands held up,
why the 'bus would never reach Victoria.  Howsomever, here I am; my own
master for a time, and ready to make myself generally useless.  What
about a half-day excursion to Brighton to-morrow, little missy?"
</p><p>"This, Mr. Trew, is Mr. Langham."
</p><p>"I don't get on over and above first class," he said, "with a certain
relative of yours, sir, but I never met a family yet that was all
alike.  Some white sheep in every flock."
</p><p>Gertie explained Jim Langham's requirements, and Trew, placing his hat
upon the counter, and admitting himself to be something of an authority
on matters connected with the sea, brought his best intelligence to
bear upon the subject.  It was too late, he decided, to go down that
evening to the steamship office, but a telegram might be sent, asking
for a berth to be reserved, and Mr. Langham could go to the docks in
the morning.
</p><p>"It is absolutely imperative," declared the other urgently, "that I
leave at the first possible moment."
</p><p>"If the worst comes to the worst," said Mr. Trew, "you can ship as a
stowaway.  You come up on deck, third day out, and kneel at the
captain's feet and sing a song about being an orphan.  That, of course,
would be a last resource."
</p><p>Gertie discovered a telegram form, and on the instructions of Mr. Trew,
filled it in; and Jim Langham assured her that he was more obliged than
he could express in words.  Mr. Trew left to arrange the dispatch of
the message.
</p><p>"I count myself extremely fortunate," said the other, "to have
encountered you, Miss Higham.  If you hear anything against me later
on, I--I should feel grateful if you thought the best of me that you
can.  I wish," he went on, with an anxious air, "I wish I knew how to
repay you."
</p><p>"Don't make a fuss about trifles," she recommended.
</p><p>He gazed at a picture of a well-attired youth smoking a cigar.
</p><p>"I was a decent chap once," he said thoughtfully, "but that was long
ago.  Look here, Miss Higham!  Henry--you know Henry?"
</p><p>"I did know him."  Turning her face away.
</p><p>"He will be at Paddington Station tomorrow morning at ten.  See him
there.  Put off every other engagement, and see him."
</p><p>"There will be no use in doing that."
</p><p>"There may be," he contradicted earnestly.  "You've been very hard hit
over this business, and I happen to know he wants to meet you, only
that he is afraid of appearing intrusive.  At ten o'clock at the
arrival platform.  May I say good-bye now?  God bless you.  I haven't
much influence with Him, but I--I hope He'll be good to you!"
</p><p>She came from behind the counter, and accompanied him to the swing
doors.
</p><p>"Whose ghost was it you thought you saw, Mr. Langham?"
</p><p>"I must have been mistaken," he replied vaguely.  "A shame to have
worried you!"
</p>
<p>All the comedy in life and some of the tragedy can be found at London
railway stations, and only the fact that members of the staff are well
occupied prevents them from furnishing shelves of bookstalls with
records of their observation.  The classes are there (an effort is
being made to cancel one useful intermediate stage), presenting
themselves, for the most part, in a highly-agitated condition of mind,
with the result that officials acquire the methods of those who deal
with the mentally unhinged; show themselves prepared for any display of
eccentricity.  Ever, as in life, you remark the people who arrive too
soon, or too late; a few lucky ones come in the very nick of time.  The
last named are favourites, selected with no obvious reason by Fortune,
and greatly envied by their contemporaries; it is usual for them to
claim the entire credit to themselves.  Apart from these, at the
terminal stations where no barriers exist, are folk who make but little
affectation of being passengers, and use the station as a playground,
with engine and train for toys.
</p><p>To Paddington at a quarter to ten in the morning came hurriedly,
although there was no cause for hurry, Gertie Higham, escorted by Mr.
Trew, both exceptionally costumed as befitting a notable occasion.
Gertie's escort had a pair of driving-gloves, and he could not
determine whether it looked more aristocratic to wear these or to carry
them with a negligent air; he compromised on the departure platform by
wearing one and carrying the other.  The collector-dog trotted up with
the box on his back, and both put in some coppers.  They glanced at the
giant clock.
</p><p>"I wish," she said agitatedly, "that I could skip half an hour of my
life."
</p><p>"When you get to my age, little missy," remarked Trew, "you won't talk
like that.  Speaking personally, I can fairly say that if it wasn't for
these new motors I sh'd like to live to be a 'underd.  Now, let's jest
make sure and certain about this train."
</p><p>"I thought we had done so."
</p><p>"May as well be on the safe side."
</p><p>Mr. Trew left her at the bookstall to go on a journey in search of
verification.  She observed that he obtained news first from a junior
porter, and worked upwards in the scale, with the evident intention of
obtaining at last corroborative evidence from a director.  The girl
turned, and, gazing at the rows of books, found she could not read the
titles clearly.  One of the lads of the stall came with a book in his
hand, recommending it to her notice; written by a new chap, he
mentioned confidentially, and highly interesting.  Gertie pulled
herself together, and gave attention.
</p><p>"Thank you," she said, "but it's the work of a cousin of mine."
</p><p>The lad put Clarence Mills's novel down, and took up a pocket edition
of "Merchant of Venice."
</p><p>"In that case," he remarked, "I suppose it's no use showing you
anything written by your Uncle William."
</p><p>Trew came at a run, saving her the necessity of thinking of an answer.
Mr. Henry was now on the arrival platform, right across where a finger
pointed; Gertie was to wait until a scarlet handkerchief showed itself,
and she begged him very earnestly not to give the signal unless it
appeared to be well justified.  A train, that had received no education
in the art of reticence, came to an intervening set of lines, and
Gertie's anxiety increased; she hurried down the platform to a point
from which it was possible to see the meeting.  Henry was engaged in
conversation with a Great Western official; Mr. Trew, in going past,
turned and, with a great air of wonder, recognized him.  Gertie noted
with satisfaction that Henry's greeting was hearty and unrestrained.
Mr. Trew indicated a superior carriage standing near; she knew, from
his gestures, that he was describing the uncovered conveyances recalled
from his early youth.
</p><p>"Oh, do make haste!" she urged under her breath.
</p><p>They moved a few steps together, and Henry interrupted conversation
with an inquiry.  Mr. Trew, astonished to the extent of taking off his
hat, gave a wave with it in the direction of Platform Number One, and
Henry spoke eagerly.  Mr. Trew took out his scarlet handkerchief,
rubbed his face.
</p><p>"Now," cried Henry, advancing delightedly to meet her, "I wonder what
the chances were against our meeting here?"
</p><p>"It is rather unexpected, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Where," he hesitated, "where is Mr. Bulpert?"
</p><p>"I really don't know," she replied, smiling.  "We're not engaged any
longer."
</p><p>"Good news!" he cried with emphasis.  "That is to say, it's good news
if you wished the engagement to cease."
</p><p>"I wasn't sorry."
</p><p>He took her elbow, and glanced around.  Mr. Trew was examining a set of
milk churns with the air of an experienced dairyman.
</p><p>"Isn't it amazing," said Henry, "how one lucky moment can change the
appearance of everything?  I've been feeling lately that nothing could
possibly come right, and now--"
</p><p>"We mustn't go on too fast," she interposed sagely, "because that only
means more disappointment.  You haven't heard yet about my father.
Listen whilst I tell you about him."
</p><p>Gertie waited, as she went on, for a relaxation in the pleasant hold on
her arm, but this did not come.  When she had said the last word, he
nodded.
</p><p>"I knew all about this long before you did," he said.  "The information
came from my sister-in-law.  She had discovered the facts, and felt
disappointed, I think, to find that I was not greatly impressed.  Of
course, you're not responsible for his actions any more than I can be
held liable for the behaviour of Jim Langham.  Jim is a much worse nut
than your father; he hasn't any excuse for his conduct.  Forged his
sister's name to a big cheque, and, naturally, he has disappeared.  I
am giving him time to get away before I say anything about it to her."
</p><p>"May be leaving England now, I suppose?"
</p><p>"I hope so; but we needn't bother about him.  Let us talk about
ourselves, just as we used to do.  Do you remember, dear girl?"
</p><p>"I recollect it," she admitted.  "Every moment, and every step, and
every word.  It will always be something good for me to look back upon,
when I'm older."
</p><p>He bent down to her.  "We'll look back upon it together," he said
affectionately.
</p><p>"No!"
</p><p>The official to whom Henry had been speaking begged pardon for
interrupting; the train, he announced, would be about five minutes
late.  Gertie thanked him with a glance that, at any honestly managed
exchange office, could be converted into bank notes.
</p><p>"Has your view of me altered, then?" he asked.
</p><p>"My view of you," she replied steadily, "is exactly the same that it
always has been, ever since I first met you.  I like you better--oh, a
lot better--than any one else in the world, and I know that if you
married me you'd do all you could to make me happy and comfortable.
But I shouldn't be happy and comfortable.  I've got to look forward;
and when I do that, there's no use in shutting my eyes.  I can see
quite clearly what would happen.  You'd have this large house down in
the country, and you would ask friends there, and I should make
blunders, and, sooner or later, you'd be certain to feel ashamed of me."
</p><p>"I don't agree, dear," he said with emphasis.  "Anyhow let us try the
experiment.  I am sure you overestimate the distance between us.  Think
how well we used to get along together."
</p><p>"If life was all summer evenings and Primrose Hill," she remarked, "I
might stand a chance.  But it isn't.  Your life is going to be that of
a country gentleman in Berkshire; my life is going to be that of a
well-paid worker in Great Titchfield Street."
</p><p>"Wish I could find some method," he cried vehemently, "of giving events
a twist.  I'd much rather go on in my own profession.  I'm making my
way slowly, but I'm making it for myself, and I--I want you for
company."  He gave a gesture of appeal.  "Can't you see how much it
means?"
</p><p>"We've got to take matters as they are, and not as we should like them
to be.  And it isn't as though I'd only got myself to think about.
There's you.  If I didn't care so much for you, it might be different."
</p><p>"For the moment," protested Henry Douglass, "I find myself wishing,
dear, that you were not quite so sensible.  We will talk about this
again, won't we?  Let me call at Praed Street."
</p><p>"Rather you didn't," said Gertie, "if you don't mind, because I shall
never change my decision.  And I wish I could explain how sorry I am it
hasn't all come right."  She looked up at him with tears in her eyes.
"Give me a kiss before we say good-bye."
</p><p>"We're to say a lot of other things to each other," he asserted
determinedly, "but we are never to say that!  Stay here, until I have
seen these people into the railway omnibus.  Please!"
</p><p>The train came slowly; the engine with the air of one that had, in its
time, hurt itself by violent contact with buffers; a line of porters
edged the platform, ready to seize brass handles of compartments so
soon as the train stopped.  Gertie stood behind a trolley, and watched
the crowd of alighting passengers.  She caught sight of Lady Douglass
and Miss Loriner: Lady Douglass carrying her small dog, and apparently
more authoritative than ever in manner; her companion nursing a copy of
Clarence's book.  Henry and Rutley went to the rear van to see to the
luggage, and presently returned; Rutley talked animatedly, Henry's
features exhibited surprise.  The railway omnibus was found; transfer
of luggage began.
</p><p>"My dearest, dearest!" cried Henry excitedly.  "Listen to me; hear the
great news Rutley has brought.  My brother arrived home last night.
The good fellow is safe and sound.  He came down from here, from
Paddington, and called at Ewelme to get some important papers he
wanted.  Heard Lady Douglass's voice--she happened to be annoyed about
something--and left without seeing her.  This means--don't you
see?--that I have nothing now to bother about, excepting my work.  And
you!"
</p><p>She had a difficulty in finding words.  "Mr. Langham did not meet a
ghost, then."
</p><p>"I'm going to see the boat train off at Victoria," he went on rapidly,
"and I shall be back at Praed Street in an hour.  Less than an hour.
We'll go out to lunch together."
</p><p>"I'll wait for you there!" promised the happy girl.
