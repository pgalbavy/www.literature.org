<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the 7th of November, 1917, the Premier of the Russian Revolutionary
Government was a hunted fugitive, his ministers in prison, his
troops scattered or dead. Three weeks later, the irresponsible
Reds had begun their shameful career of treachery, counselled
by a pallid, black-eyed man with a muzzle like a mouse&mdash;one L.
D. Bronstein, called Trotzky; and by two others&mdash;one a bald, smooth-shaven,
rotund little man with an expression that made men hesitate, and
features not trusted by animals and children.</p>

<p>The Red Parliament called him Vladimir Ulianov, and that's what
he called himself. He had proved to be reticent, secretive, deceitful,
diligent, and utterly unhuman. His lower lip was shaped as though
something dripped from it. Blood, perhaps. His eyes were brown
and not entirely unattractive. But God makes the eyes; the mouth
is fashioned by one's self.</p>

<p>The world knew him as Lenine.</p>

<p>The third man squinted. He wore a patch of sparse cat-hairs on
his chin and upper lip.</p>

<p>His head was too big; his legs too short, but they were always
in a hurry, always in motion. He had a persuasive and ardent tongue,
and practically no mind. The few ideas he possessed inclined him
to violence&mdash;always the substitute for reason in this sort of
agitator. It was this ever latent violence that proved persuasive.
His name was Krylenko. His smile was a grin.</p>

<p>These three men betrayed Christ on March 3d, 1918.</p>

<p>On the Finland Road, outside of Petrograd, the Red ragamuffins
held a perpetual carmagnole, and all fugitives danced to their
piping, and many paid for the music.</p>

<p>But though White Guards and Red now operated in respectively
hostile gangs everywhere throughout the land, and the treacherous
hun armies were now in full tide of their Baltic invasion, there
still remained ways and means of escape&mdash;inconspicuous highways
and unguarded roads still open that led out of that white hell
to the icy but friendly seas clashing against the northward coasts.</p>

<p>Diplomats were inelegantly "beating it." A kindly but futile
Ambassador shook the snow of Petrograd from his galoshes and solemnly
and laboriously vanished. Mixed bands of attachés, consular personnel,
casuals, emissaries, newspaper men, and mission specialists scattered
into unfeigned flight toward those several and distant sections
of "God's Country," divided among civilised nations and lying
far away somewhere in the outer sunshine.</p>

<p>Sometimes White Guards caught these fugitives; sometimes Red
Guards; and sometimes the hun nabbed them on the general hunnish
principle that whatever is running away is fair game for a pot
shot.</p>

<p>Even the American Red Cross was "suspect"&mdash;treachery being alleged
in its relations with Roumania; and hun and Bolshevik became very
troublesome&mdash;so troublesome, in fact, that Estridge, for example,
was having an impossible time of it, arrested every few days,
wriggling out of it, only to be collared again and detained.</p>

<p>Sometimes they questioned him concerning gun-running into Roumania;
sometimes in regard to his part in conducting the American girl,
Miss Dumont, to the convent where the imperial family had been
detained.</p>

<p>That the de facto government had requested him to undertake this
mission and to employ an American Red Cross ambulance in the affair
seemed to make no difference.</p>

<p>He continued to be dogged, spied on, arrested, detained, badgered,
until one evening, leaving the Smolny, he encountered an American&mdash;a
slim, short man who smiled amiably upon him through his glasses,
removed a cigar from his lips, and asked Estridge what was the
nature of his evident and visible trouble.</p>

<p>So they walked back to the hotel together and settled on a course
of action during the long walk. What this friend in need did and
how he did it, Estridge never learned; but that same evening he
was instructed to pack up, take a train, and descend at a certain
station a few hours later.</p>

<p>Estridge followed instructions, encountered no interference,
got off at the station designated, and waited there all day, drinking
boiling tea.</p>

<p>Toward evening a train from Petrograd stopped at the station,
and from the open door of a compartment Estridge saw his chance
acquaintance of the previous day making signs to him to get aboard.</p>

<p>Nobody interfered. They had a long, cold, unpleasant night journey,
wedged in between two soldiers wearing arm-bands, who glowered
at a Russian general officer opposite, and continued to mutter
to each other about imperialists, bourgeoisie, and cadets.</p>

<p>At every stop they were inspected by lantern light, their papers
examined, and sometimes their luggage opened. But these examinations
seemed to be perfunctory, and nobody was detained.</p>

<p>In the grey of morning the train stopped and some soldiers with
red arm-bands looked in and insulted the general officer, but
offered no violence. The officer gave them a stony glance and
closed his cold, puffy eyes in disdain. He was blond and looked
like a German.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>At the next stop Estridge received a careless nod from his chance
acquaintance, gathered up his luggage and descended to the frosty
platform.</p>

<p>Nobody bothered to open their bags; their papers were merely
glanced at. They had some steaming tea and some sour bread together.</p>

<p>A little later a large sleigh drove up behind the station; their
light baggage was stowed aboard, they climbed in under the furs.</p>

<p>"Now," remarked his calm companion to Estridge, "we're all right
if the Reds, the Whites and the boches don't shoot us up."</p>

<p>"What are the chances?" inquired Estridge.</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent," said his companion cheerily, "I should
say we have about one chance in ten to get out of this alive.
I'll take either end&mdash;ten to one we don't get out&mdash;ten to two
we're shot up and not killed&mdash;ten to three we are arrested but
not killed&mdash;one to ten we pull through with whole skins."</p>

<p>Estridge smiled. They remained silent, probably preoccupied with
the hazards of their respective fortunes. It grew colder toward
noon.</p>

<p>The young man seated beside Estridge in the sleigh smoked continually.</p>

<p>He was attached to one of the American missions sent into Russia
by an optimistic administration&mdash;a mission, as a whole, foredoomed
to political failure.</p>

<p>In every detail, too, it had already failed, excepting only in
that particular part played by this young man, whose name was
Brisson.</p>

<p>He, however, had gone about his occult business in a most amazing
manner&mdash;the manner of a Yankee who knows what he wants and what
his country ought to want if it knew enough to know it wanted
it.</p>

<p>He was the last American to leave Petrograd: he had taken his
time; he left only when he was quite ready to leave.</p>

<p>And this was the man, now seated beside Estridge, who had coolly
and cleverly taken his sporting chance in remaining till the eleventh
hour and the fifty-ninth minute in the service of his country.
Then, as the twelfth hour began to strike, he bluffed his way
through.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>During the first two or three days of sleigh travel, Brisson
learned all he desired to know about Estridge, and Estridge learned
almost nothing about Brisson except that he possessed a most unholy
genius for wriggling out of trouble.</p>

<p>Nothing, nobody, seemed able to block this young man's progress.
He bluffed his way through White Guards and Red; he squirmed affably
out of the clutches of wandering Cossacks; he jollied officials
of all shades of political opinion; but he always continued his
journey from one étape to the next. Also, he was continually lighting
one large cigar after another. Buttoned snugly into his New York-made
arctic clothing, and far more comfortable at thirty below zero
than was Estridge in Russian costume, he smoked comfortably in
the teeth of the icy gale or conversed soundly on any topic chosen.
And the range was wide.</p>

<p>But about himself and his mission in Russia he never conversed
except to remark, once, that he could buy better Russian clothing
in New York than in Petrograd.</p>

<p>Indeed, his only concession to the customs of the country was
in the fur cap he wore. But it was the galoshes of Manhattan that
saved his feet from freezing. He had two pair and gave one to
Estridge.</p>

<p>During several hundreds of miles in sleighs, Brisson's constant
regret was the absence of ferocious wolves. He desired to enjoy
the whole show as depicted by the geographies. He complained to
Estridge quite seriously concerning the lack of enterprise among
the wolves.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no wolves in Russia sufficiently polite
to oblige him; so he comforted himself by patting his stomach
where, sewed inside his outer underclothing, reposed documents
destined to electrify the civilised world with proof infernal
of the treachery of those three men who belong in history and
in hell to the fraternity which includes Benedict Arnold and Judas.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>One late afternoon, while smoking his large cigar and hopefully
inspecting the neighbouring forest for wolves, this able young
man beheld a sotnia of Ural Cossacks galloping across the snow
toward the flying sleigh, where he and Estridge sat so snugly
ensconced.</p>

<p>There was, of course, only one thing to do, and that was to halt.
Kaledines had blown his brains out, but his riders rode as swiftly
as ever. So the sleigh stopped.</p>

<p>And now these matchless horsemen of the Wild Division came galloping
up around the sleigh. Brilliant little slanting eyes glittered
under shaggy head-gear; broad, thick-lipped mouths split into
grins at sight of the two little American flags fluttering so
gaily on the sleigh.</p>

<p>Then two booted and furred riders climbed out of their saddles,
and, under their sheepskin caps, Brisson saw the delicate features
of two young women, one a big, superb, blue-eyed girl; the other
slim, dark-eyed, and ivory-pale.</p>

<p>The latter said in English: "Could you help us? We saw the flags
on your sleigh. We are trying to leave the country. I am American.
My name is Palla Dumont. My friend is Swedish and her name is
Ilse Westgard."</p>

<p>"Get in, any way," said Brisson briskly. "We can't be in a worse
mess than we are. I imagine it's the same case with you. So if
we're all going to smash, it's pleasanter, I think, to go together."</p>

<p>At that the Swedish girl laughed and aided her companion to enter
the sleigh.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she called in her clear, gay voice to the Cossacks.
"When we come back again we shall ride with you from Vladivostok
to Moscow and never see an enemy!"</p>

<p>When the young women were comfortably ensconced in the sleigh,
the riders of the Wild Division crowded their horses around them
and shook hands with them English fashion.</p>

<p>"When you come back," they cried, "you shall find us riding through
Petrograd behind Korniloff!" And to Brisson and Estridge, in a
friendly manner: "Come also, comrades. We will show you a monument
made out of heads and higher than the Kremlin. That would be a
funny joke and worth coming back to see."</p>

<p>Brisson said pleasantly that such an exquisite jest would be
well worth their return to Russia.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed pleased; the Cossacks wheeled their shaggy mounts
and trotted away into the woods, singing. The sleigh drove on.</p>

<p>"This is very jolly," said Brisson cheerfully. "Wherever we're
bound for, now, we'll all go together."</p>

<p>"Is not America the destination of your long journey?" inquired
the big, blue-eyed girl.</p>

<p>Brisson chuckled: "Yes," he said, "but bullets sometimes shorten
routes and alter destinations. I think you ought to know the worst."</p>

<p>"If that's the worst, it's nothing to frighten one," said the
Swedish girl. And her crystalline laughter filled the icy air.</p>

<p>She put one persuasive arm around her slender, dark-eyed comrade:</p>

<p>"To meet God unexpectedly is nothing to scare one, is it, Palla?"
she urged coaxingly.</p>

<p>The other reddened and her eyes flashed: "What God do you mean?"
she retorted. "If I have anything to say about my destination
after death I shall go wherever love is. And it does not dwell
with the God or in the Heaven that we have been taught to desire
and hope for."</p>

<p>The Swedish girl patted her shoulder and smiled in good humoured
deprecation at Brisson and Estridge.</p>

<p>"God let her dearest friend die under the rifles of the Reds,"
she explained cheerfully, "and my little comrade can not reconcile
this sad affair with her faith in Divine justice. So she concludes
there isn't any such thing. And no Divinity." She shrugged: "That
is what shakes the faith in youth&mdash;the seeming indifference of
the Most High."</p>

<p>Palla Dumont sat silent. The colour had died out in her cheeks,
her dark, indifferent eyes became fixed.</p>

<p>Estridge opened the fur collar of his coat and pulled back his
fur cap.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me?" he said to Ilse Westgard.</p>

<p>The girl laughed: "Yes, I remember you, now!"</p>

<p>To Palla Dumont he said: "And do <em>you</em> remember?"</p>

<p>At that she looked up incuriously; leaned forward slowly; gazed
intently at him; then she caught both his hands in hers with a
swift, sobbing intake of breath.</p>

<p>"You are John Estridge," she said. "You took me to her in your
ambulance!" She pressed his hands almost convulsively, and he
felt her trembling under the fur robe.</p>

<p>"Is it true," he said, "&mdash;that ghastly tragedy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All died?"</p>

<p>"All."</p>

<p>Estridge turned to Brisson: "Miss Dumont was companion to the
Grand Duchess Marie," he said in brief explanation.</p>

<p>Brisson nodded, biting his cigar.</p>

<p>The Swedish girl-soldier said: "They were devoted&mdash;the little
Grand Duchess and Palla.... It was horrible, there in the convent
cellar&mdash;those young girls&#11834;" She gazed out across the snow;
then,</p>

<p>"The Reds who did it had already made me prisoner.... They arrested
me in uniform after the decree disbanding us.... I was on my way
to join Kaledines' Cossacks&mdash;a rendezvous.... Well, the Reds left
me outside the convent and went in to do their bloody work. And
I gnawed the rope and ran into the chapel to hide among the nuns.
And there I saw a White Nun&mdash;quite crazed with grief&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I had heard the volley that killed her," said Palla, in explanation,
to nobody in particular. She sat staring out across the snow with
dry, bright eyes.</p>

<p>Brisson looked askance at her, looked significantly at the Swedish
girl, Ilse Westgard: "And what happened then?" he inquired, with
the pleasant, impersonal manner of a physician.</p>

<p>Ilse said: "Palla had already begun her novitiate. But what happened
in those terrible moments changed her utterly.... I think she
went mad at the moment.... Then the Superior came to me and begged
me to hide Palla because the Bolsheviki had promised to return
and cut her throat when they had finished their bloody business
in the crypt.... So I caught her up in my arms and I ran out into
the convent grounds. And at that very moment, God be thanked,
a sotnia of the Wild Division rode up looking for me. And they
had led horses with them. And we were in the saddle and riding
like maniacs before I could think. That is all, except, an hour
ago we saw your sleigh."</p>

<p>"You have been hiding with the Cossacks ever since!" exclaimed
Estridge to Palla.</p>

<p>"That is her history," replied Ilse, "and mine. And," she added
cheerfully but tenderly, "my little comrade, here, is very, very
homesick, very weary, very deeply and profoundly unhappy in the
loss of her closest friend... and perhaps in the loss of her faith
in God."</p>

<p>"I am tranquil and I am not unhappy,"&mdash;said Palla. "And if I
ever win free of this murderous country I shall, for the first
time in my life, understand what the meaning of life really is.
And shall know how to live."</p>

<p>"You thought you knew how to live when you took the white veil,"
said Ilse cheerfully. "Perhaps, after all, you may make other
errors before you learn the truth about it all. Who knows? You
might even care to take the veil again&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Palla in a clear, hard little voice, tinged with
the scorn and anger of that hot revolt which sometimes shakes
youth to the very source of its vitality.</p>

<p>Ilse said very calmly to Estridge: "With me it is my reason and
not mere hope that convinces me of God's existence. I try to reason
with Palla because one is indeed to be pitied who has lost belief
in God&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said Palla drily; "&mdash;one merely becomes one's
self when once the belief in that sort of God is ended."</p>

<p>Ilse turned to Brisson: "That," she said, "is what seems so impossible
for some to accept&mdash;so terrible&mdash;the apparent indifference, the
lack of explanation &mdash;God's dreadful reticence in this thunderous
whirlwind of prayer that storms skyward day and night from our
martyred world."</p>

<p>Palla, listening, sat forward and said to Brisson: "There is
only one religion and it has only two precepts&mdash;love and give!
The rest&mdash;the forms, observances, creeds, ceremonies, threats,
promises, are man-made trash!</p>

<p>"If man's man-made God pleases him, let him worship him. That
kind of deity does not please me. I no longer care whether He
pleases me or not. He no longer exists as far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>Brisson, much interested, asked Palla whether the void left by
discredited Divinity did not bewilder her.</p>

<p>"There is no void," said the girl. "It is already filled with
my own kind of God, with millions of Gods&mdash;my own fellow creatures."</p>

<p>"Your fellow beings?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You think your fellow creatures can fill that void?"</p>

<p>"They have filled it."</p>

<p>Brisson nodded reflectively: "I see," he said politely, "you
intend to devote your life to the cult of your fellow creatures."</p>

<p>"No, I do not," said the girl tranquilly, "but I intend to love
them and live my life that way unhampered." She added almost fiercely:
"And I shall love them the more because of their ignorant faith
in an all-seeing and tender and just Providence which does not
exist! I shall love them because of their tragic deception and
their helplessness and their heart-breaking unconsciousness of
it all."</p>

<p>Ilse Westgard smiled and patted Palla's cheeks: "All roads lead
ultimately to God," she said, "and yours is a direct route though
you do not know it."</p>

<p>"I tell you I have nothing in common with the God you mean,"
flashed out the girl.</p>

<p>Brisson, though interested, kept one grey eye on duty, ever hopeful
of wolves. It was snowing hard now&mdash;a perfect geography scene,
lacking only the wolves; but the étape was only half finished.
There might be hope.</p>

<p>The rather amazing conversation in the sleigh also appealed to
him, arousing all his instincts of a veteran newspaper man, as
well as his deathless curiosity&mdash;that perpetual flame which alone
makes any intelligence vital.</p>

<p>Also, his passion for all documents&mdash;those sewed under his underclothes,
as well as these two specimens of human documents&mdash;were now keeping
his lively interest in life unimpaired.</p>

<p>"Loss of faith," he said to Palla, and inclined toward further
debate, "must be a very serious thing for any woman, I imagine."</p>

<p>"I haven't lost faith in love," she said, smilingly aware that
he was encouraging discussion.</p>

<p>"But you say you have lost faith in spiritual love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not say so. I did not mean the other kind of love when
I said that love is sufficient religion for me."</p>

<p>"But spiritual love means Deity&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It does <em>not</em>! Can you imagine the all-powerful father
watching his child die, horribly&mdash;and never lifting a finger!
Is that love? Is that power? <em>Is</em> that Deity?"</p>

<p>"To penetrate the Divine mind and its motives for not intervening
is impossible for us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That is priest's prattle! Also, I care nothing now about Divine
motives. Motives are human, not divine. So is policy. That is
why the present Pope is unworthy of respect. He let his flock
die. He deserted his Cardinal. He let the hun go unrebuked. He
betrayed Christ. I care nothing about any mind weak enough, politic
enough, powerless enough, to ignore love for motives!</p>

<p>"One loves, or one does not love. Loving is giving&mdash;" The girl
sat up in the sleigh and the thickening snowflakes drove into
her flushed face. "Loving is giving," she repeated, "&mdash;giving
life to love; giving <em>up</em> life for love&mdash;giving! <em>giving!</em>
always giving!&mdash;always forgiving! That is love! That is the only
God!&mdash;the indestructible, divine God within each one of us!"</p>

<p>Brisson appraised her with keen and scholarly eyes. "Yet," he
said pleasantly, "you do not forgive God for the death of your
friend. Don't you practise your faith?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed nonplussed; then a brighter tint stained her
cheeks under the ragged sheepskin cap.</p>

<p>"Forgive God!" she cried. "If there really existed that sort
of God, what would be the use of forgiving what He does? He'd
only do it again. That is His record!" she added fiercely, "&mdash;indifference
to human agony, utter silence amid lamentations, stone deaf, stone
dumb, motionless. It is not in me to fawn and lick the feet of
such an image. No! It is not in me to believe it alive, either.
And I do not! But I know that love lives: and if there be any
gods at all, it must be that they are without number, and that
their substance is of that immortality born inside us, and which
we call love! Otherwise, to me, now, symbols, signs, saints, rituals,
vows&mdash;these things, in my mind, are all scrapped together as junk.
Only, in me, the warm faith remains&mdash;that within me there lives
a god of sorts&mdash;perhaps that immortal essence called a soul&mdash;and
that its only name is love. And it has given us only one law to
live by&mdash;the Law of Love!"</p>

<p>Brisson's cigar had gone out. He examined it attentively and
found it would be worth relighting when opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Then he smiled amiably at Palla Dumont:</p>

<p>"What you say is very interesting," he remarked. But he was too
polite to add that it had been equally interesting to numberless
generations through the many, many centuries during which it all
had been said before, in various ways and by many, many people.</p>

<p>Lying back in his furs reflectively, and deriving a rather cold
satisfaction from his cigar butt, he let his mind wander back
through the history of theocracy and of mundane philosophy, mildly
amused to recognize an ancient theory resurrected and made passionately
original once more on the red lips of this young girl.</p>

<p>But the Law of Love is not destined to be solved so easily; nor
had it ever been solved in centuries dead by Egyptian, Mongol,
or Greek&mdash;by priest or princess, prophet or singer, or by any
vestal or acolyte of love, sacred or profane.</p>

<p>No philosophy had solved the problem of human woe; no theory
convinced. And Brisson, searching leisurely the forgotten corridors
of treasured lore, became interested to realise that in all the
history of time only the deeds and example of one man had invested
the human theory of divinity with any real vitality&mdash;and that,
oddly enough, what this girl preached&mdash;what she demanded of divinity&mdash;had
been both preached and practised by that one man alone &mdash;Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>Turning involuntarily toward Palla, he said: "Can't you believe
in Him, either?"</p>

<p>She said: "He was one of the Gods. But He was no more divine
than any in whom love lives. Had He been more so, then He would
still intervene to-day! He is powerless. He lets things happen.
And we ourselves must make it up to the world by love. There is
no other divinity to intervene except only our own hearts."</p>

<p>But that was not, as the young girl supposed, her fixed faith,
definite, ripened, unshakable. It was a phase already in process
of fading into other phases, each less stable, less definite,
and more dangerous than the other, leaving her and her ardent
mind and heart always unconsciously drifting toward the simple,
primitive and natural goal for which all healthy bodies are created
and destined&mdash;the instinct of the human being to protect and perpetuate
the race by the great Law of Love.</p>

<p>Brisson's not unkindly cynicism had left his lips edged with
a slight smile. Presently he leaned back beside Estridge and said
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Purely pathological. Ardent religious instinct astray and running
wild in consequence of nervous dislocations due to shock. Merely
over-storage of superb physical energy. Intellectual and spiritual
wires overcrowded. Too many volts.... That girl ought to have
been married early. Only a lot of children can keep her properly
occupied. Only outlet for her kind. Interesting case. Contrast
to the Swedish girl. Fine, handsome, normal animal that. She could
pick me up between thumb and finger. Great girl, Estridge."</p>

<p>"She is really beautiful," whispered Estridge, glancing at Ilse.</p>

<p>"Yes. So is Mont Blanc. That sort of beauty&mdash;the super-sort.
But it's the other who is pathologically interesting because her
wires are crossed and there's a short circuit somewhere. Who comes
in contact with her had better look out."</p>

<p>"She's wonderfully attractive."</p>

<p>"She is. But if she doesn't disentangle her wires and straighten
out she'll burn out.... What's that ahead? A wolf!"</p>

<p>It was the rest house at the end of the étape&mdash;a tiny, distant
speck on the snowy plain.</p>

<p>Brisson leaned over and caught Palla's eye. Both smiled.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "for a girl who doesn't believe in anything,
you seem cheerful enough."</p>

<p>"I am cheerful because I <em>do</em> believe in everything and
in everybody."</p>

<p>Brisson laughed: "You shouldn't," he said. "Great mistake. Trust
in God and believe nobody&mdash;that's the idea. Then get married and
close your eyes and see what God will send you!"</p>

<p>The girl threw back her pretty head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Marriage and priests are of no consequence," she said, "but
I adore little children!"</p>
