EIGHT o'clock had struck before I got into the air that was scented, 
not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat- 
builders, and mast oar and block makers. All that water-side region 
of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge, was unknown ground 
to me, and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot 
I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything 
but easy to find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and 
I had no other guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper 
Rope-Walk. 

<p>It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost 
myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked 
to pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards 
of ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly bit- 
ing into the ground though for years off duty, what mountainous 
country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks 
that were not the Old Green Copper. After several times falling 
short of my destination and as often over-shooting it, I came un- 
expectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a fresh 
kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from 
the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three 
trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there 
was the Old Green Copper Rope-Walk -- whose long and narrow 
vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames 
set in the ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes 
which had grown old and lost most of their teeth. 

<p>Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank, a 
house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not 
bay-window, which is another thing), I looked at the plate upon 
the door, and read there, Mrs Whimple. That being the name I 
wanted, I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving 
appearance responded. She was immediately deposed, however, by 
Herbert, who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door. It 
was an odd sensation to see his very familiar fuce established quite 
at home in that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found 
myself looking at him, much as I looked at the corner-cupboard 
with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the 
coloured engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain 
Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the Third in a 
state-coachman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the 
terrace at Windsor. 

<p>`All is well, Handel,' said Herbert, `and he is quite satisfied, 
though eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if 
you'll wait till she comes down, I'll make you known to her, and 
then we'll go up-stairs. -- <I>That's</I> her father.' 

<p>I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had 
probably expressed the fact in my countenance. 

<p>`I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,' said Herbert, smiling, `but I 
have never seen him. Don't you smell tum? He is always at it.' 

<p>`At rum?' said I. 

<p>`Yes,' returned Herbert, `and you may suppose how mild it 
makes his gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions up- 
stairs in his room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves 
over his head, and <I>will</I> weigh them all. His room must be like a 
chandler's shop.' 

<p>While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged 
roar, and then died away. 

<p>`What else can be the consequence,' said Herbert, in explana- 
tion, `if he <I>will</I> cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right 
hand -- and everywhere else -- can't expect to get through a Double 
Gloucester without hurting himself.' 

<p>He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another 
furious roar. 

<p>`To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs 
Whimple,' said Herbert, `for of course people in general won't 
stand that noise. A curious place, Handel; isn't it?' 

<p>It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and 
clean. 

<p>`Mrs Whimple,' said Herbert, when I told him so, `is the best of 
housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do 
without her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, 
Handel, and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.' 

<p>`Surely that's not his name, Herbert?' 

<p>`No, no,' said Herbert, `that's my name for him. His name is Mr 
Barley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and 
mother, to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never 
bother herself, or anybody else, about her family !' 

<p>Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded 
me, that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing 
her education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her 
being recalled home to nurse her father, he and she had confided 
their affection to the motherly Mrs Whimple, by whom it had been 
fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever 
since. It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could 
possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his being totally 
unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological 
than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores. 

<p>As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sus- 
tained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room 
door opened, and a very pretty' slight dark-eyed girl of twenty or 
so, came in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly re- 
lieved of the basket, and presented blushing, as `Clara.' She really 
was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a captive 
fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his 
service. 

<p>`Look here,' said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a com- 
passionate and tender smile after we had talked a little; `here's poor 
Clara's supper, served out every night. Here's her allowance of 
bread, and here's her slice of cheese, and here's her rum -- which I 
drink. This is Mr Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to 
be cooked. Two mutton chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a 
little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black 
pepper. It's stewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing 
for the gout, I should think!' 

<p>There was something so natural and winning in Clara's resigned 
way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them 
out, -- and something so confiding, loving, and innocent, in her 
modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert's embracing arm -- 
and something so gentle in her, so much needing protection on 
Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper 
Rope-Walk, with Old Barley growling in the beam -- that I would 
not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert, for all 
the money in the pocket-book I had never opened. 

<p>I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when sud- 
denly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping 
noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying 
to bore it through the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to 
Herbert, `Papa wants me, darling!' and ran away. 

<p>`There is an unconscionable old shark for you!' said Herbert. 
`What do you suppose he wants now, Handel?' 

<p>`I don't know,' said I. `Something to drink?' 

<p>`That's it!' cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extra- 
ordinary merit. `He keeps his grog ready-mixed in a little tub on the 
table. Wait a moment, and you'll hear Clara lift him up to take 
some. -- There he goes!' Another roar, with a prolonged shake at 
the end. `Now,' said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, `he's 
drinking. Now,' said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam 
once more, `he's down again on his back!' 

<p>Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me 
up-stairs to see our charge. As we passed Mr Barley's door, he was 
heard hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like 
wind, the following Refrain; in which I substitute good wishes for 
something quite the reverse. 

<p>`Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill 
Barley, bless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of his 
back, by the Lord. Lying on the flat of his back, like a drifting old 
dead flounder, here's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! 
Bless you.' 

<p>In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible 
Barley would commune with himself by the day and night to- 
gether; often while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye 
at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of 
sweeping the river. 

<p>In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh 
and airy, and in which Mr Barley was less audible than below, 
I found Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and 
seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me 
that he was softened -- indefinably, for I could not have said how, 
and could never afterwards recall how when I tried; but certainly. 

<p>The opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection, 
had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respect- 
ing Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the 
man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his 
own destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with 
him by his fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wem- 
mick's judgment and sources of information ? 

<p>`Ay, ay, dear boy!' he answered, with a grave nod, `Jaggers 
knows.' 

<p>`Then, I have talked with Wemmick,' said I, `and have come to 
tell you what caution lie gave me and what advice.' 

<p>This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and 
I told him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether 
from officers or prisoners I could not say), that he was under some 
suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wem- 
mick had recommended his keeping close for a time, and my keep- 
ing away from him; and what Wemmick had said about getting 
him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time came, I should 
go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might be safest 
in Wemmick's judgment. What was to follow that, I did not touch 
upon; neither indeed was I at all clear or comfortable about it in 
my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in 
declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living, by 
enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present un- 
settled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, 
if it were no worse? 

<p>He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable through- 
out. His coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always 
known it to be a venture. He would do nothing to make it a des- 
perate venture, and he had very little fear of his safety with such 
good help. 

<p>Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here 
said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of 
Wemmick's suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. 
`We are both good watermen, Handel, and could take him down 
the river ourselves when the right time comes. No boat would then 
be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a 
chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving. Never mind 
the season; don't you think it might be a good thing if you began 
at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of 
rowing up and down the river? You fall into that habit, and then 
who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is 
nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first.' 

<p>I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed 
that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should 
never recognize us if we came below Bridge and rowed past Mill 
Pond Bank. But, we further agreed that he should pull down the 
blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east, when- 
ever he saw us and all was right. 

<p>Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I 
rose to go; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go 
home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of him. 
`I don't like to leave you here,' I said to Provis, `though I cannot 
doubt your being safer here than near me. Good-bye!' 

<p>`Dear boy,' he answered, clasping my hands, `I don't know when 
we may meet again, and I don't like Good-bye. Say Good Night!' 

<p>`Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when 
the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, 
Good night!' 

<p>We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms, and we 
left him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the 
stair-rail to light us down stairs. Looking back at him, I thought 
of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed, 
and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and 
anxious at parting from him as it was now. 

<p>Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his 
door, with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. 
When we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he 
had preserved the name of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and 
that the lodger was Mr Campbell. He also explained that the utmost 
known of Mr Campbell there, was, that he (Herbert) had Mr 
Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong personal interest in 
his being well cared for, and living a secluded life. So, when we 
went into the parlour where Mrs Whimple and Clara were seated 
at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr Campbell, but 
kept it to myself. 

<p>When I had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark-eyed girl, and 
of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy 
with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper 
Rope-Walk had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be 
as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, 
but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in 
Chinks's Basin to fill it to overflowing. And then I thought of 
Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly. 

<p>All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. 
The windows of the rooms of that side, lately occupied by Provis, 
were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden-court. I 
walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the 
steps that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. 
Herbert coming to my bedside when he came in -- for I went straight 
to bed, dispirited and futigued -- made the same report. Opening 
one of the windows after that, he looked out into the moonlight, 
and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pave- 
ment of any Cathedral at that same hour. 

<p>Next day, I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the 
boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could 
reach her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for 
training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. 
I was often out in cold, min, and sleet, but nobody took much note 
of me after I had been out a few times. At first, I kept above Black- 
friars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards 
London Bridge. It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at 
certain states of the tide there was a race and a fall of water there 
which gave it a bad reputation. But I knew well enough how to 
`shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about 
among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith. The first time 
I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; 
and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east 
come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three 
times in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelli- 
gence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for 
alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once 
received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I 
suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate. 

<p>In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in 
hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant 
to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was 
running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it 
bore, towards Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing 
towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be 
his pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.
