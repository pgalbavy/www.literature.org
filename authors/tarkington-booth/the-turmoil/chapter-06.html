<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a brave and lustrous banquet; and a noisy one, too, because
there was an orchestra among some plants at one end of the long
dining-room, and after a preliminary stiffness the guests were
impelled to converse&mdash;necessarily at the tops of their voices.
The whole company of fifty sat at a great oblong table, improvised
for the occasion by carpenters; but, not betraying itself as an
improvisation, it seemed a permanent continent of damask and lace,
with shores of crystal and silver running up to spreading groves
of orchids and lilies and white roses&mdash;an inhabited continent,
evidently, for there were three marvelous, gleaming buildings:
one in the center and one at each end, white miracles wrought
by some inspired craftsman in sculptural icing. They were models
in miniature, and they represented the Sheridan Building, the
Sheridan Apartments, and the Pump Works. Nearly all the guests
recognized them without having to be told what they were, and
pronounced the likenesses superb.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the table was visibly baronial. At the head
sat the great Thane, with the flower of his family and of the
guests about him; then on each side came the neighbors of the
"old" house, grading down to vassals and retainers&mdash;superintendents,
cashiers, heads of departments, and the like&mdash;at the foot, where
the Thane's lady took her place as a consolation for the less
important. Here, too, among the thralls and bondmen, sat Bibbs
Sheridan, a meek Banquo, wondering how anybody could look at him
and eat.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was a vast, continuous eating, for these
were wholesome folk who understood that dinner meant something
intended for introduction into the system by means of an aperture
in the face, devised by nature for that express purpose. And besides,
nobody looked at Bibbs.</p>

<p>He was better content to be left to himself; his voice was not
strong enough to make itself heard over the hubbub without an
exhausting effort, and the talk that went on about him was too
fast and too fragmentary for his drawl to keep pace with it. So
he felt relieved when each of his neighbors in turn, after a polite
inquiry about his health, turned to seek livelier responses in
other directions. For the talk went on with the eating, incessantly.
It rose over the throbbing of the orchestra and the clatter and
clinking of silver and china and glass, and there was a mighty
babble.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! Started without a dollar."... "Yellow flounces on
the overskirt&mdash;"... "I says, 'Wilkie, your department's got to
go bigger this year,' I says."... "Fifteen per cent. turnover
in thirty-one weeks."... "One of the biggest men in the biggest&mdash;"...
"The wife says she'll have to let out my pants if my appetite&mdash;"...
"Say, did you see that statue of a Turk in the hall? One of the
finest things I ever&mdash;"... "Not a dollar, not a nickel, not one
red cent do you get out o' me,' I says, and so he ups and&mdash;"...
"Yes, the baby makes four, they've lost now."... "Well, they got
their raise, and they went in big."... "Yes, sir! Not a dollar
to his name, and look at what&mdash;"... "You wait! The population
of this town's goin' to hit the million mark before she stops."...
"Well, if you can show me a bigger deal than&mdash;"</p>

<p>And through the interstices of this clamoring Bibbs could hear
the continual booming of his father's heavy voice, and once he
caught the sentence, "Yes, young lady, that's just what did it
for me, and that's just what'll do it for my boys&mdash;they got to
make two blades o' grass grow where one grew before!" It was his
familiar flourish, an old story to Bibbs, and now jovially declaimed
for the edification of Mary Vertrees.</p>

<p>It was a great night for Sheridan&mdash;the very crest of his wave.
He sat there knowing himself Thane and master by his own endeavor;
and his big, smooth, red face grew more and more radiant with
good will and with the simplest, happiest, most boy-like vanity.
He was the picture of health, of good cheer, and of power on a
holiday. He had thirty teeth, none bought, and showed most of
them when he laughed; his grizzled hair was thick, and as unruly
as a farm laborer's; his chest was deep and big beneath its vast
facade of starched white linen, where little diamonds twinkled,
circling three large pearls; his hands were stubby and strong,
and he used them freely in gestures of marked picturesqueness;
and, though he had grown fat at chin and waist and wrist, he had
not lost the look of readiness and activity.</p>

<p>He dominated the table, shouting jocular questions and railleries
at every one. His idea was that when people were having a good
time they were noisy; and his own additions to the hubbub increased
his pleasure, and, of course, met the warmest encouragement from
his guests. Edith had discovered that he had very foggy notions
of the difference between a band and an orchestra, and when it
was made clear to him he had held out for a band until Edith threatened
tears; but the size of the orchestra they hired consoled him,
and he had now no regrets in the matter.</p>

<p>He kept time to the music continually&mdash;with his feet, or pounding
on the table with his fist, and sometimes with spoon or knife
upon his plate or a glass, without permitting these side-products
to interfere with the real business of eating and shouting.</p>

<p>"Tell 'em to play 'Nancy Lee'!" he would bellow down the length
of the table to his wife, while the musicians were in the midst
of the "Toreador" song, perhaps. "Ask that fellow if they don't
know 'Nancy Lee'!" And when the leader would shake his head apologetically
in answer to an obedient shriek from Mrs. Sheridan, the "Toreador"
continuing vehemently, Sheridan would roar half-remembered fragments
of "Nancy Lee," naturally mingling some Bizet with the air of
that uxorious tribute.</p>

<p>"Oh, there she stands and waves her hands while I'm away! A sail-er's
wife a sail-er's star should be! Yo ho, oh, oh! Oh, Nancy, Nancy,
Nancy Lee! Oh, Na-hancy Lee!"</p>

<p>"<em>HAY, </em>there, old lady!" he would bellow. "Tell 'em to
play 'In the Gloaming.' In the gloaming, oh, my darling, la-la-lum-tee
&mdash;Well, if they don't know that, what's the matter with 'Larboard
Watch, Ahoy'? <em>THAT'S </em>good music! That's the kind o' music
I like! Come on, now! Mrs. Callin, get 'em singin' down in your
part o' the table. What's the matter you folks down there, anyway?
Larboard watch, ahoy!"</p>

<p>"What joy he feels, as&mdash;ta-tum-dum-tee-dee-dum steals. La-a-r-board
watch, ahoy!"</p>

<p>No external bubbling contributed to this effervescence; the Sheridans'
table had never borne wine, and, more because of timidity about
it than conviction, it bore none now; though "mineral waters"
were copiously poured from bottles wrapped, for some reason, in
napkins, and proved wholly satisfactory to almost all of the guests.
And certainly no wine could have inspired more turbulent good
spirits in the host. Not even Bibbs was an alloy in this night's
happiness, for, as Mrs. Sheridan had said, he had "plans for Bibbs"&mdash;plans
which were going to straighten out some things that had gone wrong.</p>

<p>So he pounded the table and boomed his echoes of old songs, and
then, forgetting these, would renew his friendly railleries, or
perhaps, turning to Mary Vertrees, who sat near him, round the
corner of the table at his right, he would become autobiographical.
Gentlemen less naive than he had paid her that tribute, for she
was a girl who inspired the autobiographical impulse in every
man who met her&mdash;it needed but the sight of her.</p>

<p>The dinner seemed, somehow, to center about Mary Vertrees and
the jocund host as a play centers about its hero and heroine;
they were the rubicund king and the starry princess of this spectacle&mdash;they
paid court to each other, and everybody paid court to them. Down
near the sugar Pump Works, where Bibbs sat, there was audible
speculation and admiration. "Wonder who that lady is&mdash;makin' such
a hit with the old man." "Must be some heiress." "Heiress? Golly,
I guess I could stand it to marry rich, then!"</p>

<p>Edith and Sibyl were radiant: at first they had watched Miss
Vertrees with an almost haggard anxiety, wondering what disasterous
effect Sheridan's pastoral gaieties&mdash;and other things&mdash;would have
upon her, but she seemed delighted with everything, and with him
most of all. She treated him as if he were some delicious, foolish
old joke that she understood perfectly, laughing at him almost
violently when he bragged&mdash;probably his first experience of that
kind in his life. It enchanted him.</p>

<p>As he proclaimed to the table, she had "a way with her." She
had, indeed, as Roscoe Sheridan, upon her right, discovered just
after the feast began. Since his marriage three years before,
no lady had bestowed upon him so protracted a full view of brilliant
eyes; and, with the look, his lovely neighbor said&mdash;and it was
her first speech to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you're very susceptible, Mr. Sheridan!"</p>

<p>Honest Roscoe was taken aback, and "Why?" was all he managed
to say.</p>

<p>She repeated the look deliberately, which was noted, with a mystification
equal to his own, by his sister across the table. No one, reflected
Edith, could image Mary Vertrees the sort of girl who would "really
flirt" with married men&mdash;she was obviously the "opposite of all
that." Edith defined her as a "thoroughbred," a "nice girl"; and
the look given to Roscoe was astounding. Roscoe's wife saw it,
too, and she was another whom it puzzled&mdash;though not because its
recipient was married.</p>

<p>"Because!" said Mary Vertrees, replying to Roscoe's monosyllable.
"And also because we're next-door neighbors at table, and it's
dull times ahead for both of us if we don't get along."</p>

<p>Roscoe was a literal young man, all stocks and bonds, and he
had been brought up to believe that when a man married he "married
and settled down." It was "all right," he felt, for a man as old
as his father to pay florid compliments to as pretty a girl as
this Miss Vertrees, but for himself&mdash;"a young married man"&mdash;it
wouldn't do; and it wouldn't even be quite moral. He knew that
young married people might have friendships, like his wife's for
Lamhorn; but Sibyl and Lamhorn never "flirted"&mdash;they were always
very matter-of-fact with each other. Roscoe would have been troubled
if Sibyl had ever told Lamhorn she hoped he was susceptible.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we're neighbors," he said, awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Next-door neighbors in houses, too," she added.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. I live across the street."</p>

<p>"Why, no!" she exclaimed, and seemed startled. "Your mother told
me this afternoon that you lived at home."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I live at home. I built that new house across
the street."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" she paused, confused, and then slowly a deep color
came into her cheek. "But I understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "my wife and I lived with the old folks the first
year, but that's all. Edith and Jim live with them, of course."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I see," she said, the deep color still deepening as
she turned from him and saw, written upon a card before the gentleman
at her left the name, "Mr. James Sheridan, Jr." And from that
moment Roscoe had little enough cause for wondering what he ought
to reply to her disturbing coquetries.</p>

<p>Mr. James Sheridan had been anxiously waiting for the dazzling
visitor to "get through with old Roscoe," as he thought of it,
and give a bachelor a chance. "Old Roscoe" was the younger, but
he had always been the steady wheel-horse of the family. Jim was
"steady" enough, but was considered livelier than Roscoe, which
in truth is not saying much for Jim's liveliness. As their father
habitually boasted, both brothers were "capable, hard-working
young business men," and the principal difference between them
was merely that which resulted from Jim's being still a bachelor.
Physically they were of the same type: dark of eyes and of hair,
fresh-colored and thick-set, and though Roscoe was several inches
taller than Jim, neither was of the height, breadth, or depth
of the father. Both wore young business men's mustaches, and either
could have sat for the tailor-shop lithographs of young business
men wearing "rich suitings in dark mixtures."</p>

<p>Jim, approving warmly of his neighbor's profile, perceived her
access of color, which increased his approbation. "What's that
old Roscoe saying to you, Miss Vertrees?" he asked. "These young
married men are mighty forward nowadays, but you mustn't let 'em
make you blush."</p>

<p>"Am I blushing?" she said. "Are you sure?" And with that she
gave him ample opportunity to make sure, repeating with interest
the look wasted upon Roscoe. "I think you must be mistaken," she
continued. "I think it's your brother who is blushing. I've thrown
him into confusion."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>She laughed, and then, leaning to him a little, said in a tone
as confidential as she could make it, under cover of the uproar.
"By trying to begin with him a courtship I meant for <em>YOU</em>!"</p>

<p>This might well be a style new to Jim; and it was. He supposed
it a nonsensical form of badinage, and yet it took his breath.
He realized that he wished what she said to be the literal truth,
and he was instantly snared by that realization.</p>

<p>"By George!" he said. "I guess you're the kind of girl that can
say anything&mdash;yes, and get away with it, too!"</p>

<p>She laughed again&mdash;in her way, so that he could not tell whether
she was laughing at him or at herself or at the nonsense she was
talking; and she said: "But you see I don't care whether I get
away with it or not. I wish you'd tell me frankly if you think
I've got a change to get away with <em>YOU</em>?"</p>

<p>"More like if you've got a chance to get away <em>FROM </em>me!"
Jim was inspired to reply. "Not one in the world, especially after
beginning by making fun of me like that."</p>

<p>"I mightn't be so much in fun as you think," she said, regarding
him with sudden gravity.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, in simple honesty, "you're a funny girl!"</p>

<p>Her gravity continued an instant longer. "I may not turn out
to be funny for <em>YOU</em>."</p>

<p>"So long as you turn out to be anything at all for me, I expect
I can manage to be satisfied." And with that, to his own surprise,
it was his turn to blush, whereupon she laughed again.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, plaintively, not wholly lacking intuition, "I
can see you're the sort of girl that would laugh the minute you
see a man really means anything!"</p>

<p>"'Laugh'!" she cried, gaily. "Why, it might be a matter of life
and death! But if you want tragedy, I'd better put the question
at once, considering the mistake I made with your brother."</p>

<p>Jim was dazed. She seemed to be playing a little game of mockery
and nonsense with him, but he had glimpses of a flashing danger
in it; he was but too sensible of being outclassed, and had somewhere
a consciousness that he could never quite know this giddy and
alluring lady, no matter how long it pleased her to play with
him. But he mightily wanted her to keep on playing with him.</p>

<p>"Put what question?" he said, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"As you are a new neighbor of mine and of my family," she returned,
speaking slowly and with a cross-examiner's severity, "I think
it would be well for me to know at once whether you are already
walking out with any young lady or not. Mr. Sheridan, think well!
Are you spoken for?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," he gasped. "Are you?"</p>

<p>"NO!" she cried, and with that they both laughed again; and the
pastime proceeded, increasing both in its gaiety and in its gravity.</p>

<p>Observing its continuance, Mr. Robert Lamhorn, opposite, turned
from a lively conversation with Edith and remarked covertly to
Sibyl that Miss Vertrees was "starting rather picturesquely with
Jim." And he added, languidly, "Do you suppose she <em>WOULD</em>?"</p>

<p>For the moment Sibyl gave no sign of having heard him, but seemed
interested in the clasp of a long "rope" of pearls, a loop of
which she was allowing to swing from her fingers, resting her
elbow upon the table and following with her eyes the twinkle of
diamonds and platinum in the clasp at the end of the loop. She
wore many jewels. She was pretty, but hers was not the kind of
prettiness to be loaded with too sumptuous accessories, and jeweled
head-dresses are dangerous&mdash;they may emphasize the wrongness of
the wearer.</p>

<p>"I said Miss Vertrees seems to be starting pretty strong with
Jim,"  repeated Mr. Lamhorn.</p>

<p>"I heard you." There was a latent discontent always somewhere
in her eyes, no matter what she threw upon the surface of cover
it, and just now she did not care to cover it; she looked sullen.
"Starting any stronger than you did with Edith?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, keep the peace!" he said, crossly. "That's off, of course."</p>

<p>"You haven't been making her see it this evening&mdash;precisely,"
said Sibyl, looking at him steadily. "You've talked to her for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," he begged, "keep the peace!"</p>

<p>"Well, what have you just been doing?"</p>

<p>"SH!" he said. "Listen to your father-in-law."</p>

<p>Sheridan was booming and braying louder than ever, the orchestra
having begun to play "The Rosary," to his vast content.</p>

<p>"I <em>COUNT THEM OVER, LA-LA-TUM-TEE-DUM," </em>he roared, beating
the measures with his fork. "<em>EACH HOUR A PEARL, EACH PEARL
TEE-DUM-TUM-DUM &mdash;</em>What's the matter with all you folks?
Why'n't you <em>SING? </em>Miss Vertrees, I bet a thousand dollars
<em>YOU </em>sing! Why'n't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sheridan," she said, turning cheerfully from the ardent
Jim, "you don't know what you interrupted! Your son isn't used
to my rough ways, and my soldier's wooing frightens him, but I
think he was about to say something important."</p>

<p>"I'll say something important to him if he doesn't!" the father
threatened, more delighted with her than ever. "By gosh! if I
was his age&mdash;or a widower right <em>NOW</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wait!" cried Mary. "If they'd only make less noise! I want
Mrs. Sheridan to hear."</p>

<p>"She'd say the same," he shouted. "She'd tell me I was mighty
slow if I couldn't get ahead o' Jim. Why, when I was his age&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must listen to your father," Mary interrupted, turning to
Jim, who had grown red again. "He's going to tell us how, when
he was your age, he made those two blades of grass grow out of
a teacup&mdash;and you could see for yourself he didn't get them out
of his sleeve!"</p>

<p>At that Sheridan pounded the table till it jumped. "Look here,
young lady!" he roared. "Some o' these days I'm either goin' to
slap you&mdash;or I'm goin' to kiss you!"</p>

<p>Edith looked aghast; she was afraid this was indeed "too awful,"
but Mary Vertrees burst into ringing laughter.</p>

<p>"Both!" she cried. "Both! The one to make me forget the other!"</p>

<p>"But which&mdash;" he began, and then suddenly gave forth such stentorian
trumpetings of mirth that for once the whole table stopped to
listen. "Jim," he roared, "if you don't propose to that girl to-night
I'll send you back to the machine-shop with Bibbs!"</p>

<p>And Bibbs&mdash;down among the retainers by the sugar Pump Works,
and watching Mary Vertrees as a ragged boy in the street might
watch a rich little girl in a garden &mdash;Bibbs heard. He heard&mdash;and
he knew what his father's plans were now.</p>
