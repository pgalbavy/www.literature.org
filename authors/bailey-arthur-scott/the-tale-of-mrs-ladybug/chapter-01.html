<p>LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug was a worker. Nobody could deny that. To be sure,
she had to stop now and then to talk to her neighbors, because Mrs.
Ladybug dearly loved a bit of gossip. At the same time there wasn't
anyone in Pleasant Valley that helped Farmer Green more than she did.
She tried her hardest to keep the trees in the orchard free from
insects.
</p>
<p>Some of her less worthy neighbors were known sometimes to say with a
sniff, "If Mrs. Ladybug didn't enjoy her work she wouldn't care about
helping Farmer Green. If she hadn't such a big appetite she'd stop to
chat even more than she does now."
</p><p>That might seem an odd remark--unless one happened to know how Mrs.
Ladybug freed the orchard of the tiny pests that attacked it. The truth
of the matter was this: Mrs. Ladybug <u>ate</u> the little insects that fed
upon the fruit trees. Her constant toil meant that she devoured huge
numbers of Farmer Green's enemies.
</p><p>Goodness knows what Farmer Green would have done had Mrs. Ladybug and
all her family lost their taste for that kind of fare. The orchard might
have been a sorry sight.
</p><p>Perhaps it was only to be expected that Mrs. Ladybug should have little
patience with folk that seemed lazy. She thought that Freddie Firefly
wasted too much of his time dancing in the meadow at night. She
considered Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son, to be a useless idler,
dressed in his black velvet and gold. Having heard that Daddy Longlegs
was a harvestman, she urged him to go to work for Farmer Green at
harvest time. And as for the beautiful Betsy Butterfly, Mrs. Ladybug
found all manner of fault with her.
</p><p>Nothing made Mrs. Ladybug angrier than to see Betsy Butterfly flitting
from flower to flower in the sunshine, followed by her admirers.
</p><p>"What <u>can</u> they see in that gaudy creature?" Mrs. Ladybug often asked
her friends.
</p><p>It will appear, from this, that Mrs. Ladybug was not always as pleasant
as she might have been. Moreover, she was something of a busybody and
too fond of prying into the affairs of others. And if she didn't happen
to approve of her neighbors, or their ways, Mrs. Ladybug never hesitated
to speak her mind.
</p><p>When she first appeared on Farmer Green's place, wearing her bright red
gown with its black spots, everyone supposed that Mrs. Ladybug was
dressed in her working clothes. And indeed she was! Nor did she ever don
any other.
</p><p>"I've no time to fritter away," she declared when somebody asked her
what she was going to wear to Betsy Butterfly's party. "If I go to the
party I'll just drop in for a few minutes as I am, in my polka dot."
</p><p>Her neighbors thought that very strange. They even whispered to one
another that they didn't believe Mrs. Ladybug had anything else to
wear.
</p><p>Nor had she. Nor did she want any. And it wasn't long before everybody
understood Mrs. Ladybug's ways. She was so earnest that they couldn't
help liking her, no matter if her remarks were a bit tart now and then.
