<p>It may seem a strange thing for old Mr. Crow to have had no other
name--such as John, or James, or Josephus. But that was the way he
preferred it to be. Indeed, his parents had given him another name,
years before. But Mr. Crow did not like it. And after he grew up he
dropped the name. To tell the truth, the reason for his coming to
Pleasant Valley, in the beginning, was because no one knew him there.
And though his new friends thought it odd that he should be called
simply "Mr. Crow," he was satisfied.
</p>
<p>Of course, that was when he was younger. As the years passed he became
known as "old Mr. Crow." But no one called him that except behind his
back. And since he knew nothing of that, it never annoyed him in the
least.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Crow had spent a good many pleasant seasons in Pleasant Valley.
And nobody had ever found out much about him. But at last there came a
day when he was very much upset. He was roaming through the woods on a
sunny afternoon when someone called to him.
</p><p>He stopped. And presently a person in a bright blue coat came hurrying
up. It was a noisy fellow known as Jasper Jay, who was new in the
neighborhood.
</p><p>"I thought I recognized you," he shouted to Mr. Crow. "As soon as I saw
you fly past I said to myself, 'That looks like Cousin--'"
</p><p>Mr. Crow stopped him just in time. It was true that the two were cousins.
One look at their big feet and their big bills would have told you that.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Crow sometimes saw Jasper on the trips he made each fall and
spring. And Jasper knew Mr. Crow's name. He had almost said it, too, at
the top of his boisterous voice.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Jasper Jay inquired, for Mr. Crow was looking all
around. "Have you lost anything?"
</p><p>"Yes!" said Mr. Crow. "I've lost my name. And I don't want to find it
again, either."
</p><p>What he was really doing was this: He was peering about to see whether
anybody might be listening.
</p><p>Jasper Jay's mouth fell open--he was so astonished.
</p><p>"Why, what do you mean, Cousin--"
</p><p>Mr. Crow stopped him again.
</p><p>"Don't call me that!" he said severely. "I'm known here as 'Mr. Crow.'
And I'll thank you to call me by that name and no other."
</p><p>That astonished Jasper Jay all the more, because he had never known Mr.
Crow to thank anybody for anything.
</p><p>"Well, well!" he murmured faintly. And then it was Mr. Crow's turn to be
surprised, for he had never before heard his cousin Jasper speak in
anything but the loudest scream.
</p><p>Then Mr. Crow explained that he had never liked the name his parents had
given him and that he wanted nobody in Pleasant Valley to learn what it
was.
</p><p>"You must promise me," said Mr. Crow--and there was a dangerous glitter
in his eye--"you must promise me that you'll never speak my name again."
</p><p>"Why, certainly!" Jasper Jay replied. "I'm glad to oblige you, I'm sure.
And I promise that I'll never, never, never again mention your name
aloud, Cousin Jim."
</p><p>There! The secret is out! Jasper Jay said Mr. Crow's name without once
thinking what he was about. And Mr. Crow was so angry that he gave his
cousin a sound beating, on the spot.
</p><p>"I'll teach you," he said, "to do as you're told!" And he did. For after
that Jasper Jay always remembered that to him, as to everybody else, his
big black cousin must be known only as "Mr. Crow."
</p><p>You see, "Jim Crow" was a name that Mr. Crow could not abide. The mere
sound of it made him wince. And he was not a person of tender feelings,
either.
