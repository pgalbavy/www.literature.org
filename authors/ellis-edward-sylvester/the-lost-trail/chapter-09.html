<p>One of the most convincing evidences of a Power beyond our comprehension,
governing and directing everything for the best, is the marvelous
degree to which the different faculties of our nature can be trained. 
There is a skill which cannot be explained or understood by him
who attains it; and, interwoven through the five senses which
science assigns to us, seems to be a sixth not yet understood,
of whose wonderful functions every one of us has seen proof.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe warrior, after parting with his companion, walked
leisurely toward the tree behind which the young Kentuckian was
hiding, until about twenty yards separated them.  Then he stopped
as abruptly as if stricken by a thunderbolt.  There was "something
in the air" which whispered danger.</p>

<p>The Indian had neither seen nor heard anything to cause this
misgiving, but he knew that peril confronted him.  What he would
have done in the event of Jack Carleton remaining silent and stationary
behind the trunk can only be conjectured; but the impatience of
the youth ended that phase of the situation.</p>

<p>Softly removing his cap, the young Kentuckian slowly moved the
side of his head to the right.  In doing so, he kept his face
in a perpendicular position, so that the least possible part of
his head was exposed.  Had he inclined it, the upper portion would
have shown before the eye could have been brought into use.</p>

<p>The first object on which Jack's vision rested was the Shawanoe
warrior, standing erect, one foot slightly advanced and both hands
grasping the rifle in front of him.  The face was daubed and streaked
with paint, and the gleaming black eyes were looking straight
at the startled youth.</p>

<p>Like a flash the dusky arms brought the gun to his shoulder,
and it is safe to say that Jack Carleton never in all his life
drew back his head with such celerity.</p>

<p>Quick as was the Indian, he was not quick enough to catch the
lad, who, it will be seen, had very little to do in order to save
himself for the moment.  With a faint whoop, the redskin bounded
behind the nearest tree, and, with his cocked rifle at command,
awaited an opening that would allow him to slay his foe.</p>

<p>Thus the two occupied precisely the same, relative position;
each was protected by a trunk of a tree large enough to shield
his body, and each grasped a loaded and cocked rifle, eager to
use it the instant the opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>Who was to win in this curious contest?  Looking at the situation
dispassionately, it must be admitted that the chances favored
the Indian.  He was older, stronger, more active, and possessed
greater cunning than did the youth.  What, after all, is one of
the most important factors in such a problem, the American race
possess by training, and nature&mdash;patience scarcely second to that
of the Esquimau.  The probabilities were that the Shawanoe would
wait until the youth was led into some fatal indiscretion.</p>

<p>All this, be it remembered, is based on the condition that no
such thing as "foreign interference" took place.</p>

<p>Is there any reader of mine who has not been entertained in his
early youth by the story of the white man and the Indian, who,
being placed in the situation of Jack and the Shawanoe, remained
in hiding from each other, until the Caucasian drew the shot of
the American, by placing his cap on the end of the ramrod or gun
and projecting it far enough from behind the tree, thus leading
the Indian to believe that the head of his foe was in range? 
If such an incident ever took place, the warrior must have been
unusually stupid to leap from cover, as the story makes him do,
until certain he had brought the other down.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton attempted the same artifice, except that, instead
of taking the trouble to draw his ramrod or using his rifle for
that purpose, he held his cap in hand, shoving it forward very
slowly and with great care.</p>

<p>The trick failed.  The Shawanoe must have suspected the truth
on the first appearance of the head-gear.  Jack pushed it forward
until sure it was seen, but no demonstration came from the warrior,
who, for aught the youth knew, was essaying the same deception.</p>

<p>Determined to learn something about his enemy, Jack threw his
head to one side and drew it back again before the warrior could
pull the trigger.  He knew precisely where to look, but he was
unable to catch sight of the Shawanoe or his weapon.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he has shifted his quarters," said Jack to
himself.  "If he has, he will shot at me before I can learn where
he is.  Holloa!"</p>

<p>The second time he thrust forward his face withdrawing it with
the same celerity as before, he caught a passing glimpse of the
Shawanoe, who, rather curiously, adopted exactly the same artifice.
This "located" the savage and relieved Jack, for the moment, of
his terrifying dread that death threatened from an unknown point.</p>

<p>But, within the next minute, the redskin utterance to a faint
whoop, clearly meant as a signal to a comrade not far off.</p>

<p>"He is calling back the Miami, who left him a few minutes ago,"
was the conclusion of Jack.  "It'll go rough with me if I have
two of them to fight.  I'll try a little of the signaling myself."</p>

<p>Placing the thumb and forefinger of his left hand against his
tongue, he emitted a low, tremulous whistle, such as he and Otto
used when on hunting expeditions together.  He repeated it, and
then, greatly to his relief, received a reply, though it was so
guarded that he could not guess the point whence it came.</p>

<p>"Now, if Otto proves sharp enough to grasp the situation, without
running into ambush, we may settle the matter with this fellow
before the other can take a hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>As on the previous day, something twinkled among the trees to
the left.  A glance in that direction and Jack saw, with dismay,
that the Miami warrior had arrived.</p>

<p>The worst of it, too, was that he appeared so far over from where
the Shawanoe stood that lines connecting the three would have
made almost a right angle.  It looked as if the youth must be
exposed to the enfilading fire of one of his enemies.</p>

<p>It was a frightful situation, but the brave Kentuckian did not
lose heart.  He pressed against the bark as closely as he could,
endeavoring to watch both points, but he was fearfully handicapped,
and there was little hope for him, unless his friend could interfere.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Miami, who, naturally enough, had taken to the shelter
of a tree, after the manner of his comrade, made a bound of several
feet which placed him behind a second trunk that was still further
to the rear of Jack Carleton.  Another such leap and the youth
would be effectually uncovered.</p>

<p>But the anxiously prayed for deliverance came at this critical
moment.  While the Miami was maneuvering for position, Otto Relstaub
appeared behind him, and, in the twinkling of an eye, the merciless
warrior was placed between two fires.</p>

<p>"You let dot chap alone?" called out the German, with his gun
to his shoulder, "or py gracious I'll shoot my ramrod clean through
you as nefer vos I don't it?"</p>

<p>The unexpected discovery of his mortal peril threw the Miami
into a panic.  It was impossible for him to find shelter at the
same moment from both his enemies, for, on whatever side of the
tree he took refuge, he would be in range of one of them.  With
a howl of consternation, he whirled on his heel and ran like a
frightened deer.  As he did so, he ducked his head and leaped
from side to side, after the manner of the Digger Indians of the
present day, with a view of distracting the fire of his enemies.</p>

<p>It would have been a feat of marksmanship had either lad brought
him down, when so many and varying objects intervened, and neither
of the youths made the attempt.  When the terrified fugitive vanished,
he was without a wound or scratch to tell of the danger from which
he had fled.</p>

<p>During these stirring moments, the Shawanoe had taken no part
and given no sign of interest in what was going on; but Jack,
who was fully aroused by the venomous attempt on his life, called
to his friend, whose position he knew commanded that of the savage:</p>

<p>"Otto, shoot the wretch!"</p>

<p>"Dot is vot I vos going to do," was the reply of the German,
who took careful aim around the side of the tree.</p>

<p>He was in plain view of Jack, who watched him with a rapidly
beating heart, knowing as he did that the fellow carried an excellent
gun and was it good shot.</p>

<p>But, while glancing along the rifle-barrel, with one eye closed,
Otto raised his head, opened both eyes and looked toward the point
at which he had been aiming.  Then his cheery laughter rang out.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the astonished Jack.</p>

<p>"Now, ain't dot funny?  He Indian ain't dere!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," shouted Jack, suspecting trickery.  "He will shoot
you, if you don't bring him down!"</p>

<p>Otto glanced affrightedly behind him, as though he heard a stealthy
footstep, but called back once more that the Shawanoe had disappeared.</p>

<p>It occurred to the other youth, just then, that if the warrior
was in the vicinity and could be seen by Otto, he must be visible
to him.  But a sweeping survey of the field failed to bring to
light the painted face and feathered crown.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the Shawanoe had taken advantage
of the diversion caused by Otto's arrival, and had not stood on
the order of his going.  Five minutes before, there seemed no
chance of Jack Carleton preserving his life.  Now, how changed! 
Toward whatever point of the compass he looked, he saw not the
first evidence that peril threatened.</p>

<p>But for all that, it was uncomfortably nigh, and it was difficult
to find a place in which there was less safety than where they
were. Jack resolved to leave at once.</p>

<p>At the moment he stepped from behind the tree which had sheltered
him, Otto strode toward him, his broad face still broader on account
of his beaming pleasure.</p>

<p>"Dot vos me," he said, triumphantly.  "Otto doned it."</p>

<p>"Did what?"</p>

<p>"Scared 'ern so dot they forgits him nefer."</p>

<p>"You did well, beyond question. I cannot see how I would have
saved myself if you hadn't come as you did.  I shall never forget
it, Otto, though I think it was a mistake when we parted company
it short while ago.  It looks as though these Miamis and Shawanoes
are on all sides of us, and we must find some kind of shelter
or make a hasty change of base."</p>

<p>"Dot's vot I dinks," assented the other.  "I am waiting for you
to show me vot's I doesn't do."</p>

<p>"It is hard to tell what is the best course," said Jack, who,
while talking, was moving slowly toward the Mississippi, watching,
meanwhile, every point of the compass.  "But, somehow or other
I feel there's less danger by the river than anywhere else."</p>

<p>"I likes it dere better than other places, for if we finds the
Indians are going to boder us, we can cheat 'em as easy as nefer
vos."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We can jump in the river and drowns mit, ourselves; won't dey
be fooled!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they would be disappointed; but I don't see where we
are likely to gain anything."</p>

<p>"I doesn't see hims mineself," grinned Otto, whose whims led
him to be amusing during the most trying moments, as well as grave
when others were light-hearted.</p>

<p>"I only wish we were on the other side," said the young Kentuckian,
who at that moment caught the gleam of the Mississippi through
the trees in front.</p>
