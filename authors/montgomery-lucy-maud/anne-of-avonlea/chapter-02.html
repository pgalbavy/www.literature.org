<P>
Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next
afternoon and took Diana Barry with her.  Diana was, of course,
a pledged member of the Improvement Society, and the two girls
talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back.
<P>
"The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have
that hall painted," said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall,
a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees
hooding it about on all sides.  "It's a disgraceful looking place and
we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull
his house down.  Father says we'll never succeed in DOING that.  Levi
Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take."
<P>
"Perhaps he'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the
boards and split them up for him for kindling wood," said Anne hopefully.
"We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first.  We can't
expect to improve everything all at once.  We'll have to educate
public sentiment first, of course."
<P>
Diana wasn't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant;
but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to
belong to a society with such an aim in view.
<P>
"I thought of something last night that we could do, Anne.
You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from
Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet?  It's all grown over
with young spruce; but wouldn't it be nice to have them all cleared
out, and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it?"
<P>
"Splendid," agreed Anne gaily.  "And have a rustic seat put under
the birches.  And when spring comes we'll have a flower-bed made
in the middle of it and plant geraniums."
<P>
"Yes; only we'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram
Sloane to keep her cow off the road, or she'll eat our geraniums
up," laughed Diana.  "I begin to see what you mean by educating
public sentiment, Anne.  There's the old Boulter house now.  Did
you ever see such a rookery?  And perched right close to the road
too.  An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of
something dead with its eyes picked out."
<P>
"I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight," said Anne
dreamily.  "It always seems to me to be thinking about its past
and mourning for its old-time joys.  Marilla says that a large
family was raised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real
pretty place, with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it. 
It was full of little children and laughter and songs; and now it
is empty, and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind.  How
lonely and sorrowful it must feel!  Perhaps they all come back on
moonlit nights. . .the ghosts of the little children of long ago
and the roses and the songs. . .and for a little while the old
house can dream it is young and joyous again."
<P>
Diana shook her head.
<P>
"I never imagine things like that about places now, Anne.  Don't
you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined
ghosts into the Haunted Wood?  To this day I can't go through that
bush comfortably after dark; and if I began imagining such things
about the old Boulter house I'd be frightened to pass it too. 
Besides, those children aren't dead.  They're all grown up and
doing well. . .and one of them is a butcher.  And flowers and
songs couldn't have ghosts anyhow."
<P>
Anne smothered a little sigh.  She loved Diana dearly and they had
always been good comrades.  But she had long ago learned that when she
wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone.  The way to it was
by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her.
<P>
A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody; it did
not last long, however, and the drive home, through lanes where the
raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the
drenched ferns gave out spicy odors, was delightful.  But just as
they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled
the beauty of the landscape for her.
<P>
Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison's broad, gray-green
field of late oats, wet and luxuriant; and there, standing squarely
in the middle of it, up to her sleek sides in the lush growth, and
blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels, was a Jersey cow!
<P>
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips
that boded no good to the predatory quadruped.  Not a word said she,
but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels, and whisked across the
fence before Diana understood what had happened.
<P>
"Anne, come back," shrieked the latter, as soon as she found
her voice.  "You'll ruin your dress in that wet grain. . .ruin it. 
She doesn't hear me!  Well, she'll never get that cow out by herself.
I must go and help her, of course." 
<P>
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing.  Diana hopped
briskly down, tied the horse securely to a post, turned the skirt
of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders, mounted the fence,
and started in pursuit of her frantic friend.  She could run faster
than Anne, who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt, and
soon overtook her.  Behind them they left a trail that would break
Mr. Harrison's heart when he should see it.
<P>
"Anne, for mercy's sake, stop," panted poor Diana.  "I'm right out
of breath and you are wet to the skin."
<P>
"I must. . .get. . .that cow. . .out. . .before. . .Mr. Harrison.
. .sees her," gasped Anne.  "I don't. . .care. . .if I'm. . .drowned
. . .if we. . .can. . .only. . .do that."
<P>
But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled
out of her luscious browsing ground.  No sooner had the two breathless
girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite
corner of the field.
<P>
"Head her off," screamed Anne.  "Run, Diana, run."
<P>
Diana did run.  Anne tried to, and the wicked Jersey went around
the field as if she were possessed.  Privately, Diana thought she was.
It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her
through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane.
<P>
There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper
at that precise moment.  Nor did it soothe her in the least to
behold a buggy halted just outside the lane, wherein sat Mr.
Shearer of Carmody and his son, both of whom wore a broad smile.
<P>
"I guess you'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy
her last week, Anne," chuckled Mr. Shearer.
<P>
"I'll sell her to you now, if you want her," said her flushed and
disheveled owner.  "You may have her this very minute."
<P>
"Done.  I'll give you twenty for her as I offered before, and Jim
here can drive her right over to Carmody.  She'll go to town with
the rest of the shipment this evening.  Mr. Reed of Brighton wants
a Jersey cow."
<P>
Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up
the road, and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables
lane with her twenty dollars.
<P>
"What will Marilla say?" asked Diana.
<P>
"Oh, she won't care.  Dolly was my own cow and it isn't likely
she'd bring more than twenty dollars at the auction.  But oh dear,
if Mr. Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in
again, and after my giving him my word of honor that I'd never let
it happen!  Well, it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of
honor about cows.  A cow that could jump over or break through our
milk-pen fence couldn't be trusted anywhere."
<P>
Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde's, and when she returned knew
all about Dolly's sale and transfer, for Mrs. Lynde had seen most
of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest.
<P>
"I suppose it's just as well she's gone, though you DO do things in
a dreadful headlong fashion, Anne.  I don't see how she got out of
the pen, though.  She must have broken some of the boards off."
<P>
"I didn't think of looking," said Anne, "but I'll go and see now. 
Martin has never come back yet.  Perhaps some more of his aunts
have died.  I think it's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the
octogenarians.  The other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a
newspaper and she said to Mr. Sloane, `I see here that another
octogenarian has just died.  What is an octogenarian, Peter?' And
Mr. Sloane said he didn't know, but they must be very sickly
creatures, for you never heard tell of them but they were dying. 
That's the way with Martin's aunts."
<P>
"Martin's just like all the rest of those French," said Marilla in disgust.
"You can't depend on them for a day."  Marilla was looking over Anne's
Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard.
A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen, wringing her hands.
<P>
"Anne Shirley, what's the matter now?"
<P>
"Oh, Marilla, whatever shall I do?  This is terrible.  And it's all
my fault.  Oh, will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little
before doing reckless things?  Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do
something dreadful some day, and now I've done it!"
<P>
"Anne, you are the most exasperating girl!  WHAT is it you've done?"
<P>
"Sold Mr. Harrison's Jersey cow. . .the one he bought from Mr. Bell
. . .to Mr. Shearer!  Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute."
<P>
"Anne Shirley, are you dreaming?"
<P>
"I only wish I were.  There's no dream about it, though it's very
like a nightmare.  And Mr. Harrison's cow is in Charlottetown by
this time.  Oh, Marilla, I thought I'd finished getting into scrapes,
and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life.
What can I do?"
<P>
"Do?  There's nothing to do, child, except go and see Mr. Harrison
about it.  We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he doesn't
want to take the money.  She is just as good as his."
<P>
"I'm sure he'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it, though,"
moaned Anne.
<P>
"I daresay he will.  He seems to be an irritable sort of a man. 
I'll go and explain to him if you like."
<P>
"No, indeed, I'm not as mean as that," exclaimed Anne.  "This is all
my fault and I'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment.
I'll go myself and I'll go at once.  The sooner it's over the better,
for it will be terribly humiliating."
<P>
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out
when she happened to glance through the open pantry door.  On the
table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning. . .a
particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned
with walnuts.  Anne had intended it for Friday evening, when the
youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the
Improvement Society.  But what were they compared to the justly
offended Mr. Harrison?  Anne thought that cake ought to soften the
heart of any man, especially one who had to do his own cooking, and
she promptly popped it into a box.  She would take it to Mr. Harrison
as a peace offering.
<P>
"That is, if he gives me a chance to say anything at all," she
thought ruefully, as she climbed the lane fence and started on a
short cut across the fields, golden in the light of the dreamy
August evening.  "I know now just how people feel who are being led
to execution."
