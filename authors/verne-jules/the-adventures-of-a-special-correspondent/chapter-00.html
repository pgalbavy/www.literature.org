<P class=normal><B>[Redactor&apos;s Note:</B> &nbsp;<I>A Special Correspondent</I>
(Number <B>V040</B> in the T&amp;M numerical listing of Verne&apos;s works) is a
translation of <I>Claudius Bombarnac (1892)</I> which first appeared in <I>Boy&apos;s
Own Magazine</I> (1893-4) and then later published in the US by U.S. Book
Company (1894) and in an illustrated edition by Lovell, Coryell, and Company
(1894); and in England by Sampson and Low (1894). This anonymous translation was
later republished by the Mac Lellan Co in Akron, Ohio sometime after 1905 (The
foreword mentions Verne&apos;s death). However the plates from which the book was
published may date from an earlier time since they are in a different font from
the foreword. The edition may be identified by the word &quot;SAMARKLAND&quot; appearing
at the start of Chapter XII and the number of pages (162). The book contains
almost 500 place names, some of which are spelled differently in different parts
of the book. Where a suspicious spelling occurs more than once it has been
retained, otherwise it is assumed to be a misprint and changed to agree with
other spellings of the same word in the book. Unbalanced or unnecessary
quotation marks have also been removed. Errors may be reported to <FONT

<P>BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY</P>
<P>Jules Verne, French author, was born at Nantes, France, in 1828, and died in
1905. In 1850 he wrote a comedy in verse, but he eventually confined himself to
the writing of scientific and geographical romances, achieving a great
reputation. He visited the United States in 1867, sailing for New York on the
<I>Great Eastern</I>, and his book, <I>A Floating City</I>, was the result of
this voyage. His best-known books are: <I>A Captain at Fifteen, A Two Years&apos;
Vacation, A Voyage to the Center of the Earth</I> (1864), <I>From the Earth to
the Moon</I> (1865), <I>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</I> (1870), <I>A Tour of
the World in Eighty Days</I> (1873), <I>Michael Strogoff</I> (1876), <I>Mrs.
Branica</I> (1891), <I>Clovis Dordentor</I> (1896), <I>The Brothers Kip</I>
(1902). Most of his works have been translated into English.</P>
