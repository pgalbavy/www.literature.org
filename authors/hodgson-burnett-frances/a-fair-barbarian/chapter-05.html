<p>In this manner Slowbridge received the shock which shook it to
its foundations, and it was a shock from which it did not recover for
some time. Before ten o'clock the next morning, everybody knew of the
arrival of Martin Bassett's daughter.
</p><p>The very boarding-school (Miss Pilcher's select seminary for young
ladies, "combining the comforts of a home," as the circular said,
"with all the advantages of genteel education") was on fire with it,
highly colored versions of the stories told being circulated from
the "first class" downward, even taking the form of an Indian princess,
tattooed blue, and with difficulty restrained from indulging in
war-whoops,--which last feature so alarmed little Miss Bigbee, aged
seven, that she retired in fear and trembling, and shed tears under the
bedclothes; her terror and anguish being much increased by the stirring
recitals of scalping-stories by pretty Miss Phipps, of the first
class--a young person who possessed a vivid imagination, and delighted in
romances of a tragic turn.
</p><p>"I have not the slightest doubt," said Miss Phipps, "that when she is at
home she lives in a wampum."
</p><p>"What is a wampum?" inquired one of her admiring audience.
</p><p>"A tent," replied Miss Phipps, with some impatience. "I should
think any goose would know that. It is a kind of tent hung with
scalps and--and--moccasins, and--lariats--and things of that sort."
</p><p>"I don't believe that is the right name for it," put in Miss Smith, who
was a pert member of the third class.
</p><p>"Ah!" commented Miss Phipps, "that was Miss Smith who spoke, of course.
We may always expect information from Miss Smith. I trust that I may be
allowed to say that I <u>think</u> I <u>have</u> a brother"--
</p><p>"He doesn't know much about it, if he calls a wigwam a wampum,"
interposed Miss Smith, with still greater pertness. "I have a brother who
knows better than that, if I am only in the third class." For a moment
Miss Phipps appeared to be meditating. Perhaps she was a trifle
discomfited; but she recovered herself after a brief pause, and returned
to the charge.
</p><p>"Well," she remarked, "perhaps it is a wigwam. Who cares if it is? And
at any rate, whatever it is, I haven't the slightest doubt that she
lives in one."
</p><p>This comparatively tame version was, however, entirely discarded when the
diamonds and silver-mines began to figure more largely in the reports.
Certainly, pretty, overdressed, jewel-bedecked Octavia gave Slowbridge
abundant cause for excitement.
</p><p>After leaving her, Lady Theobald drove home to Oldclough Hall, rather
out of humor. She had been rather out of humor for some time, having
never quite recovered from her anger at the daring of that cheerful
builder of mills, Mr. John Burmistone. Mr. Burmistone had been one
innovation, and Octavia Bassett was another. She had not been able to
manage Mr. Burmistone, and she was not at all sure that she had managed
Octavia Bassett.
</p><p>She entered the dining-room with an ominous frown on her forehead.
</p><p>At the end of the table, opposite her own seat, was a vacant chair, and
her frown deepened when she saw it.
</p><p>"Where is Miss Gaston?" she demanded of the servant.
</p><p>Before the man had time to reply, the door opened, and a girl came in
hurriedly, with a somewhat frightened air.
</p><p>"I beg pardon, grandmamma dear," she said, going to her seat quickly. "I
did not know you had come home."
</p><p>"We have a dinner-hour," announced her ladyship, "and _I_ do not
disregard it."
</p><p>"I am very sorry," faltered the culprit.
</p><p>"That is enough, Lucia," interrupted Lady Theobald; and Lucia dropped her
eyes, and began to eat her soup with nervous haste. In fact, she was glad
to escape so easily.
</p><p>She was a very pretty creature, with brown eyes, a soft white skin, and
a slight figure with a reed-like grace. A great quantity of brown hair
was twisted into an ugly coil on the top of her delicate little head;
and she wore an ugly muslin gown of Miss Chickie's make. For some time
the meal progressed in dead silence; but at length Lucia ventured to
raise her eyes.
</p><p>"I have been walking in Slowbridge, grandmamma," she said, "and I met Mr.
Burmistone, who told me that Miss Bassett has a visitor--a young lady
from America."
</p><p>Lady Theobald laid her knife and fork down deliberately.
</p><p>"Mr. Burmistone?" she said. "Did I understand you to say that you stopped
on the roadside to converse with Mr. Burmistone?"
</p><p>Lucia colored up to her delicate eyebrows and above them.
</p><p>"I was trying to reach a flower growing on the bank," she said, "and he
was so kind as to stop to get it for me. I did not know he was near at
first. And then he inquired how you were--and told me he had just heard
about the young lady."
</p><p>"Naturally!" remarked her ladyship sardonically. "It is as I anticipated
it would be. We shall find Mr. Burmistone at our elbows upon all
occasions. And he will not allow himself to be easily driven away. He is
as determined as persons of his class usually are."
</p><p>"O grandmamma!" protested Lucia, with innocent fervor. "I really do not
think he is--like that at all. I could not help thinking he was very
gentlemanly and kind. He is so much interested in your school, and so
anxious that it should prosper."
</p><p>"May I ask," inquired Lady Theobald, "how long a time this generous
expression of his sentiments occupied? Was this the reason of your
forgetting the dinner-hour?"
</p><p>"We did not"--said Lucia guiltily: "it did not take many minutes. I--I do
not think that made me late."
</p><p>Lady Theobald dismissed this paltry excuse with one remark,--a remark
made in the deep tones referred to once before.
</p><p>"I should scarcely have expected," she observed, "that a granddaughter of
mine would have spent half an hour conversing on the public road with the
proprietor of Slowbridge Mills."
</p><p>"O grandmamma!" exclaimed Lucia, the tears rising in her eyes: "it was
not half an hour."
</p><p>"I should scarcely have expected," replied her ladyship, "that a
granddaughter of mine would have spent five minutes conversing on the
public road with the proprietor of Slowbridge Mills."
</p><p>To this assault there seemed to be no reply to make. Lady Theobald had
her granddaughter under excellent control. Under her rigorous rule, the
girl--whose mother had died at her birth--had been brought up. At
nineteen she was simple, sensitive, shy. She had been permitted to have
no companions, and the greatest excitements of her life had been the
Slowbridge tea-parties. Of the late Sir Gilbert Theobald, the less said
the better. He had spent very little of his married life at Oldclough
Hall, and upon his death his widow had found herself possessed of a
substantial, gloomy mansion, an exalted position in Slowbridge society,
and a small marriage-settlement, upon which she might make all the
efforts she chose to sustain her state. So Lucia wore her dresses a much
longer time than any other Slowbridge young lady: she was obliged to mend
her little gloves again and again; and her hats were retrimmed so often
that even Slowbridge thought them old-fashioned. But she was too simple
and sweet-natured to be much troubled, and indeed thought very little
about the matter. She was only troubled when Lady Theobald scolded her,
which was by no means infrequently. Perhaps the straits to which, at
times, her ladyship was put to maintain her dignity imbittered her
somewhat.
</p><p>"Lucia is neither a Theobald nor a Barold," she had been heard to say
once, and she had said it with much rigor.
</p><p>A subject of much conversation in private circles had been Lucia's
future. It had been discussed in whispers since her seventeenth year, but
no one had seemed to approach any solution of the difficulty. Upon the
subject of her plans for her granddaughter, Lady Theobald had preserved
stern silence. Once, and once only, she had allowed herself to be
betrayed into the expression of a sentiment connected with the matter.
</p><p>"If Miss Lucia marries"--a matron of reckless proclivities had remarked.
</p><p>Lady Theobald turned upon her, slowly and majestically.
</p><p>"<u>If</u> Miss Gaston marries," she repeated. "Does it seem likely that Miss
Gaston will <u>not</u> marry?"
</p><p>This settled the matter finally. Lucia was to be married when Lady
Theobald thought fit. So far, however, she had not thought fit: indeed,
there had been nobody for Lucia to marry,--nobody whom her grandmother
would have allowed her to marry, at least. There were very few young men
in Slowbridge; and the very few were scarcely eligible according to Lady
Theobald's standard, and--if such a thing should be mentioned--to
Lucia's, if she had known she had one, which she certainly did not.
