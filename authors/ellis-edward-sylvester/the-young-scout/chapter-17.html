<p>It was at the moment Maurice Freeman’s mustang struck the crest
of the slight elevation, beyond the small brook, that he descried
the ominous vapor rising in the direction of his own home.</p>

<p>There could be but one cause for the smoke that was growing denser
every minute; it was from a burning building that had been fired
by the renegade Apaches, Maroz and Ceballos, with perhaps several
others they had gathered in their flight from the reservation;
but the parent’s anguish was quickly relieved by the discovery
that, instead of rising from the ruins of his own home, it ascended
from the dwelling of Captain Murray, further up the valley. The
two houses being in a line, it was natural that Freeman in his
alarm should make the mistake, which he saw almost instantly.</p>

<p>But the relief was only momentary. The renegades were at hand,
and had probably visited the nearest cabin before laying the other
in flames. As the settler spurred his pony into a dead run, and
without any thought of the consequences to himself, he was terrified
by the tomblike stillness and the absence of all signs of life.</p>

<p>"They have done their work there and hurried on to the captain’s,"
was his thought.</p>

<p>But never did the brave Molly look so sweet and beautiful, even
in the delightful long ago, as when she stepped from the front
door of the home with the Winchester in one hand, while she waved
the other in salutation to her husband. The happy man snatched
off his slouch hat, swung it aloft, and emitted a shout of joy
such as he and his brothers sent forth when making the desperate
charge in the heat of battle that led to victory.</p>

<p>"It looks as if it wasn’t a mistake after all," he concluded,
"to leave my gun behind me."</p>

<p>He was out of the saddle before the panting pony could halt,
and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Thank God, Molly!" he exclaimed, "but what does this mean?"
he asked, observing her white face and trembling form. "Has anything
happened to the children? Where are they? Ah, Fannie?"</p>

<p>And catching the tiny girl in his arms, he flung her aloft and
caught her as she came down, fairly smothering her with kisses,
while his own eyes grew dim with tears.</p>

<p>"Now, Fulton, my little man, it is <em>your</em> turn!"</p>

<p>But the longing gaze showed no sign of the little fellow through
the open door, and he turned affrightedly to the wife who had
sunk upon the bench just outside, and was on the verge of swooning.</p>

<p>"Molly!" he said, releasing Fannie, and tenderly placing his
hand upon his wife’s shoulder; "what is the trouble? Where is
Fulton?"</p>

<p>"I—don’t—know!" was the faint response.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma let him go to Mr. Murray’s," said the sister in her
artless manner, "and he hasn’t come back yet."</p>

<p>It was the father now who was in danger of giving way. The loved
forms, the house and all objects in his field of vision began
flickering in an odd fashion before his eyes—darkness hovered
in the air, and he stepped weakly to the bench, beside his wife,
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>But he was a strong man, and speedily gained the mastery of himself.
Molly had done the same, and with the eager eyes of her husband
fixed upon her white face, she told her story.</p>

<p>Their little boy had gone to the home of Captain Murray, as Fannie
said, to spend the day with the captain’s children. He went early
in the morning, and she had no expectation of seeing him again
until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It was perhaps two hours later when Fannie, who was playing outside,
hurried within, saying some Indians were coming over the ridge
on horseback, and they were riding fast toward the house. Mrs.
Freeman was too quick-witted to hesitate a moment. The approaching
red men might be friendly or they might be enemies. The fact of
their speeding so hard in the direction of the house was startling,
and, without waiting to decide the question, she took the wise
course of acting on the theory that they were enemies.</p>

<p>The door was hastily barred; Fannie was placed in a corner where
no stray shots could reach her, and taking down the Winchester
the mother peered cautiously out of one of the windows. She saw
four repellent Apaches reining up their ponies, less than a hundred
yards away; she saw them, too, bring their guns to their shoulders,
and the next instant the room was filled with fragments of window
panes, shattered by their bullets.</p>

<p>The woman wanted no other proof than this of the designs of her
assailants. Kneeling on the floor, she rested the barrel of the
Winchester on the window sill, and keeping so far back that she
was not seen, took deliberate aim and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The shot hit the bull’s-eye. She had handled the weapon many
a time before, and she was as cool as a veteran when she tumbled
the Apache to the earth. He had time to utter only a single screech
when he stretched out motionless on the ground, with his mustang
circling beyond in frightened bewilderment.</p>

<p>Without shifting her position, Mrs. Freeman fired again. She
did damage, though to a less extent than before. Her bullet bored
its way through the pony of a second warrior, and he stumbled
to the ground so suddenly that his rider was obliged to move nimbly
to avoid being caught beneath.</p>

<p>The Apaches had not counted upon this reception, and the survivors
lost no time in placing themselves further from the rifle that
was speaking so effectively. The single defender kept close watch
upon them, but it will be seen, that despite the brilliant manner
in which she had acquitted herself, she was still in great peril.
There was only one condition that could save her.</p>

<p>Maroz, Ceballos and their surviving ally did not dare to wait
long enough to push the fight. They were aware that their flight
from the reservation had become known, and more than likely a
squad of cavalry was already thundering on their trail. There
was no hope in lingering in the Sutra Valley, nor indeed anywhere
north of the river. Their destination was the Apache Mountains
to the south, and they had but to delay their flight only a brief
while to find it cut off altogether.</p>

<p>But for this, they would have pressed the attack, burned the
house, despite all the brave woman could do, and wreaked revenge
on her and her child; but an Apache is too cunning to run unnecessary
risk.</p>

<p>During the five or ten minutes following the fall of the hostile,
one of the survivors gave an exhibition of the astonishing activity
and power of his people. He made a dash across the open plain,
and, though the riderless pony was going at high speed, he overhauled
him in a twinkling, leaped deftly upon his bare back, wheeled
him short round, and plunged toward the cabin, as if making a
direct charge upon it.</p>

<p>While the amazed wife was holding her rifle in position, and
wondering what all this could mean, the steed described a graceful
circle and his rider became invisible for a few seconds. He had
thrown himself over the animal’s side, and, holding himself in
position by one foot curved over the pony’s neck and the left
hand knotted in his mane, he reached down with the other arm,
and, hardly abating the pace of his horse, slid it under the body
of his lifeless comrade, and swung back to an upright position,
with the limp form held securely in front.</p>

<p>The better to execute this feat, he had cast his rifle to the
earth, so as to allow the unrestrained use of his hands. He now
guided the mustang to the spot where the weapon lay on the parched
grass, and, still riding fast, and with one arm fully engaged
in sustaining the body in position, he leaned over again, snatched
up his Winchester as if it were a handkerchief, inclined himself
forward to escape the expected shot, and with the same speed as
at first, joined his companions, who were calmly awaiting him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman might have brought down the miscreant while he was
engaged in this daring feat, but she was mystified until the most
striking part was over, and then, womanlike, a feeling of sympathy
restrained the shot, which she regretted very soon had not been
fired.</p>

<p>From a distance, too great to render them effective, the Apaches
discharged several parting shots, and dashed up the valley in
the direction of Captain Murray’s home. The danger, so far as
Mrs. Freeman and Fannie were concerned, was over, for, as has
been shown, the Apaches did not dare wait nor return.</p>

<p>But when she observed the ponies with their fierce riders speeding
up the valley like a whirlwind, she recalled that her only son,
little Fulton, was at the nearest dwelling, and that he, like
the family, was in a peril whose imminence could not be exaggerated.</p>

<p>The mother was in a sad state of bewilderment. But for the young
daughter, she would have set out on foot, or mounted the remaining
pony, grazing some distance away, where it had escaped the raiders,
and hurried to the help of the imperiled ones. Who shall understand
her agony when, shortly after, she heard the rifle-shots and soon
discerned the dark smoke which told that the Apaches had met with
far more success in their second than in their first attempt?</p>

<p>It was at this trying moment that she opened the door and peered
to the westward, in the hope of seeing her husband returning from
Fort Reno. The wish was granted, and, hurrying forward, it required
only a few minutes for him to learn all that had taken place.</p>

<p>If the wife could not hasten to the help of her child, the husband
was granted that privilege.</p>

<p>"You are safe here, Molly," said he, springing to his feet, "even
though I must leave you without any weapons; the Apaches are making
for the mountains, and the soldiers are after them. I will hurry
up the valley to the captain’s, and possibly may be able to do
something, though there is little hope."</p>

<p>The second pony was not in sight, and he feared it had been stolen
by the marauders, but the grass was much better on the other side
of the ridge, in the direction of the river, and the mustangs
generally wandered to that neighborhood when left to themselves.
The signals of the owner were quickly answered by the animal,
which came trotting over the elevation, with a whinny, as if of
inquiry, and stood quiet while the saddle, bridle and accouterments
were transferred from the other animal to him.</p>

<p>An affectionate embrace and kiss were given to the wife and little
one, and then, swinging himself into the saddle, Maurice Freeman
pointed the nose of his mustang up the valley, and spurred him
to a dead run, with outstretched neck, flying mane and tail and
snorting nostrils. As if he understood that he had set out to
save human life, he paid no more heed to the blistering heat than
did his rider, who closed his mouth hard, as he refilled the empty
chambers of his Winchester without drawing rein.</p>

<p>The wooden structure, which was Captain Murray’s home, had been
seasoned by the flaming sun for weeks and months, so that when
the torch was applied it burned like tinder. Before half the distance
was passed by the furious rider, it was a mass of smouldering
ruins, from which the smoke still ascended and stained the clear
air above.</p>

<p>Freeman now drew rein, for it would have been folly to continue
his headlong flight without learning what was in front. He saw
nothing of white men or Indians, as he drew still nearer, and
rightly suspected that the hostiles, having delivered their blow,
were now making for the mountains with all speed.</p>

<p>"And where is the captain?—where is his wife?—where are his children?—and
where, heaven tell me! is my own boy?"</p>

<p>It was the last query that wrung his heart with an anguish, such
as only a parent can feel, when he believes that a loved child
is irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>"They have gone," he added, as he made a cautious circle of the
smoking ruins, "they have done their work well——"</p>

<p>The most torturing trial of his life was now upon him. When he
muttered to himself that the Apaches had done their work well,
he meant far more than the burning of the home. That was a trifle
compared with the other sight which greeted him while making his
awed circuit of the ruins.</p>

<p>He saw the forms stretched on the ground, with their white faces
turned toward the brassy sky, and he needed no one to tell him
what it meant. There was the father, lying within a dozen steps
of the wife, whom he had defended with his last breath, and just
beyond, and nearer the doorstep, a little girl lay with one dimpled
arm doubled under her cheek, as if she were sleeping. And so she
was, but it was the long dreamless slumber which knows no waking
in this world.</p>

<p>The sight which caused the heart of the father to stand still
was that of the figure of a little boy, still nearer and indeed
on the very threshold. His face was turned away, so that he could
not see the features, and the clothing was so disarranged that
he could not identify it.</p>

<p>At such times suspense is unbearable. Without dismounting he
forced his reluctant pony so close to the burning wood that the
additional heat checked him. Then he leaned over his saddle, and
peered down into the face of the boy, now in plain view.</p>

<p>It was Jack, the son of his old friend, or rather what was left
of the lad.</p>

<p>Then, with the same hard expression on his countenance, the father
straightened up in his saddle, and allowed his gaze to roam over
the burning sticks, beams and timbers, the most of which was already
ashes. He did not spare himself, and, when the survey was completed,
he knew that which he dreaded to see with an unspeakable dread
was not there, nor anywhere near.</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated, casting his eyes around the immediate field
of vision, "they have done their work well. The captain, his wife,
his little child, and boy are all gone—perished within a few minutes
of each other. Why my child is not among them I do not understand.
For some cause they have spared him yet awhile, but what hope
is there of his mother or me ever seeing him alive again?"</p>

<p>A shout caused him to turn his head quickly, and look to the
southward. There they were: five horsemen coming down upon him
like mad. At their head, was handsome James Decker, the young
lieutenant from West Point, who was getting a further taste of
soldiering in dead earnest.</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s companions were veterans, and all had been in
the service before he was born. Our old friends Armon Peyser,
Budge Colgate and Jack Redfield served creditably during the Civil
War, and the leader had already learned something of Mendez, the
White Mountain Apache, who was the guide to the party. As for
that, both Colgate and Redfield were almost, if not quite, as
familiar with the fastnesses of the Apache Mountains as Mendez,
for they had been in more than one campaign that led them thither.</p>

<p>It was the lieutenant who uttered the shout that turned the gaze
of Freeman to the ridge, on the crest of which they had just appeared.
He had recognized the man, and the latter knew him the moment
he looked up.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing down the slope to the site of the burned
building, the young officer called:</p>

<p>"If you want to join us, hurry up!"</p>

<p>Freeman answered by sending his pony off at a rate which quickly
placed him among the eager group.</p>

<p>"I see they’ve been there," remarked Decker, with a nod toward
the smoking ruins.</p>

<p>"I should say they had," was the bitter response.</p>

<p>"Did they wipe them all out?"</p>

<p>"They did not spare one."</p>

<p>"Your family was fortunate."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they have carried off my little boy," replied the father
in a broken voice.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" was the sympathetic response; "there may be
a chance of recovering him. Those fellows played us a sharp trick.
They left a plain trail, straight to the river, and without sticking
to it, we made for another and better crossing, only to learn,
after reaching the other side, that they had entered the river,
waded up stream a little way, and then turned back again. Their
natural viciousness would not allow them to leave without striking
this blow, even though it was so dangerous to themselves. They
have picked up two allies."</p>

<p>"But have only one left; the other was a victim to my Winchester,
fired by my wife."</p>

<p>"Good! that’s business; but here’s the trail leading directly
toward the river, and they can’t be far ahead. Do you want to
go with us?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t turn back for the world, till I learn what has become
of my boy."</p>

<p>"It’s only two miles to the river, and we may overtake them before
they cross. We are well mounted and here we go!"</p>

<p>And the dashing officer thundered away on a dead run, with the
rest bunched closely on the flanks of his mustang. The ground
was gently undulating, and they skimmed over it with arrowy swiftness
until the lieutenant, who maintained his position slightly in
advance, rose in his stirrups, and, peering ahead, shouted:</p>

<p>"Yonder they are, boys! There’s a fight ahead! Now for them!"</p>
