<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I was agreeably surprised upon waking to see Nat standing within
a few feet, holding two horses by the bridle.</p>

<p>"Which one will you choose?" he asked with a broad smile.</p>

<p>"How did you come by them?" asked I.</p>

<p>"I s’pose it must have been about the time you left us last night,
that Biddon woke me up, and told me to follow him, as there was
a <em>powerful</em> chance to get a couple of hosses for you and
me. I asked him where you could be, and he said he s’posed you’d
gone further up-stream to sleep by yourself, though he hadn’t
seen you go. Howsumever, we wasn’t worried, as we thought you
were old enough to take care of yourself, so we started down the
bed of the stream. We went about half a mile, when Biddon showed
me a small camp-fire, burned down to a few coals and ashes; but
there was enough light to show us two hosses picketed a few yards
away, and we seen the feet of a couple of redskins turned toward
the fire. Biddon said as how they was a couple of hunters, sound
asleep, and we might <em>borrow</em> their horses, if I didn’t
make too much noise. He told me to stand still, and keep my gun
pointed at them, and the minute one stirred to shoot him, and
then rush in, and dispatch the other. I promised to do so, and
he stole around to the hosses on his hands and knees. He had cut
both the lariats and was leading them away, when one of the Indians
raised his head and looked around, and as soon as he seen the
hosses moving off, give a grunt and jumped up and ran toward them.
I remembered it was my duty to shoot, and as the Indian was running
purty fast, I aimed about ten feet ahead of him, supposing, of
course, the villain would git there as soon as the bullet did;
but, I’ll be hanged if he wasn’t mean enough to stop, and let
the bullet be wasted. My gun kicked like blazes, and the Ingins
I s’pose thought a whole tribe was upon them; for setting up a
great howl, they <em>skooted</em> off in the darkness, leaving
us alone with the animals. Running back, I overtook Biddon, who
was riding along as though nothing had happened. He asked me to
ride and of course I jumped on, and here I am. But which hoss
do you want?"</p>

<p>"I do not see as there is much room for choice," I replied; "both
are splendid animals, and a most opportune blessing."</p>

<p>"If it’s all the same to you, this gentleman is mine;" and handing
the bridle to me, he vaulted upon the other. The latter was a
magnificent Indian pony, of a deep bay color, probably captured
when very young, and high spirited and fiery. Both manifested
considerable uneasiness, knowing they were in the hands of strangers,
and Nat’s made one or two efforts to dislodge him; but he was
a good horseman, and maintained his place with apparent ease despite
the struggles, which were frantic and desperate at first. Mine
was somewhat larger, of a coal-black color, and with as much spirit
and fire as the other, but in a few moments we had them both under
perfect control.</p>

<p>Besides these two animals, we gained two fine Indian saddles,
and were now as well mounted as we could wish. Nat remarked, that
when the buffaloes thundered by he felt some apprehension for
me, but the trapper expressed none, saying that I would be found
all right in the morning. As soon as there was light, Nat commenced
searching the bed of the stream for me, and failing in this, he
climbed a tree and took a survey of the prairie on both sides.
From his elevation he discovered what he believed to be my dead
body; and, accompanied by Biddon and the horses, hastened toward
me. Upon reaching me, they understood instantly the whole matter,
and it was their loud laughter that had aroused me.</p>

<p>We were now pretty far to the northwest of Nebraska Territory.
The face of the country was materially different, and I began
to notice a change of temperature. The summer had just closed,
and the early autumn was like the approach of winter. The nights
were cool and chilling, and the days generally mild at noon, but
often keen and exhilarating. The prairie was mostly of the rolling
kind, but the belts of timber were more common, and the vegetation
richer and more exuberant. It was plain, too, that we were journeying
into a section where the foot of civilization had not been. The
vast, undulating swell of the prairie, the mighty fields of verdure,
and the broad rivers and streams, bore only the marks of the red
man and wild beast.</p>

<p>Toward noon, Nat descried a solitary antelope far ahead. It was
near a grove of timber, from which it had just wandered, and stood
gazing wonderingly at our approach. We rode on in silence for
some time, when Biddon raised his hand for us to halt.</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Jes’ hold on and see," he replied, as he dismounted.</p>

<p>He made a circuit, skirting the prairie, so as to reach the grove
mentioned upon the opposite side from the antelope. I still was
at a loss to understand his intention, as the animal was too distant
from the timber to be brought down with a rifle-shot from that
point.</p>

<p>"What under the sun does he intend doing?" I asked, turning to
Nat.</p>

<p>"Guess he’s getting off there to shoot us."</p>

<p>On the outer edge of the grove, next to the antelope, I saw him
emerge, holding a stick over his head, to which was affixed a
handkerchief or rag. He walked a short distance, and then lay
down flat upon the prairie, perfectly concealed in the grass.
The rag was visible, fluttering above him. I now watched the motions
of the antelope. He stood gazing at us, until the trapper came
into view, when, with a startled glance at him, he wheeled and
ran. In a moment, however, he paused and turned quickly around.
His looks were now fixed upon the fluttering signal. He stood
motionless a moment, and then cautiously lifting his foot, made
a step toward it. Thus he continued to approach, step by step,
with apparent fear, and yet evidently impelled by an ungovernable
curiosity, until he was scarce a hundred yards distant from the
prostrate form of the trapper. Still he was moving stealthily
onward, when suddenly a red tongue of fire spouted from the grass,
and, as the sharp crack of Biddon’s rifle reached us, we saw the
antelope give a wild leap into the air, and, bounding a short
distance, fall to the ground. The trapper immediately sprang to
his feet and hastened to the fallen animal.</p>

<p>"Let us ride to him," said I, walking my horse onward.</p>

<p>We had ridden a short distance when Nat halted and asked:</p>

<p>"What’s got into Biddon? Just look at him!"</p>

<p>I did look up, and for a moment believed the man had turned crazy.
He had seen us approaching, and was now making furious gesticulations
toward us. I watched him a moment, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"He is either signaling for us to come on or to stop."</p>

<p>"He means us to wait, I guess, and we had better pause until
he returns."</p>

<p>We reined in our horses and watched him. He was apparently satisfied
with our stopping, and stooped and commenced working at the animal.
In a few moments he arose, and slinging a huge piece on his shoulder,
made his way into the grove. From this he emerged in due time,
and made his way toward us, motioning, meanwhile, for us to remain
in our places.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you wish us to approach?" I asked, as soon as he
came within speaking distance.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but throwing his meat upon the ground, hastily
mounted his horse. Then he spoke in a deep whisper:</p>

<p>"Boys, did you ’spose there’s over twenty redskins among them
trees?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! it isn’t possible?" I exclaimed, catching my breath.</p>

<p>"It’s so; I seed ’em, and thar eyes are on us this minute. They’re
waitin’ for us to go on, an’ they’ll give us thunder and lightnin’."</p>

<p>"What’s to be done?" queried Nat.</p>

<p>"Jes’ keep still, an’ don’t kick up, or they’ll see it. We’ve
got to make a run for it. Keep close to me, and when I start,
let your horses went."</p>

<p>"But the meat?" I hurriedly asked.</p>

<p>"Can’t take it. We have a long run, an’ our horses won’t want
to carry no extra load. I didn’t see thar animals, but I guess
they ain’t mounted. Ready!"</p>

<p>With this, Biddon wheeled his horse quickly around, and vanished
from his place with the speed of lightning, while ours almost
simultaneously shot ahead like an arrow. An instant after, I heard
the faint discharge of guns, and, looking back, saw a host of
savage forms pouring hastily from the timber.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Looking back saw a host of savage forms."]</p>

<p>"No need of hurrying. They are not mounted," I called out to
Nat, who has hurrying his horse to the utmost.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it," he exclaimed, still speeding furiously
onward.</p>

<p>"Go it, Todd! you’ll fetch up at Fort Laramie," yelled Biddon.</p>

<p>The latter drew his horse into a steady canter, and indulged
in several loud laughs at the flying fugitive. Nat continued his
mad career until he had gone a good distance, when, seeing how
far behind he had left us, he reined up and awaited our approach.</p>

<p>The savages, in the meantime, were hurrying on in pursuit. I
know not what led them to expect any success in this chase, for,
as remarked, not one was mounted. They may have had little faith
in the speed or bottom of our horses, and trusted they would be
able to run us down. Biddon half turned in his seat, and, looking
back a moment, asked:</p>

<p>"Do you see that red, diggin’ like all mad off on one side? The
one as is tryin’ to surround us?"</p>

<p>I glanced back and answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see a red drop in purty style?"</p>

<p>I answered again in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Wal, jis keep yer peeper on him."</p>

<p>So saying, he raised his rifle, without checking the speed of
his horse, took a quick aim along its long barrel and fired. To
my astonishment, the Indian mentioned uttered a wild shriek, and
springing high in the air, fell to the earth.</p>

<p>"He’s done for," remarked the trapper, quietly. "While I fodder
my iron, ’sposen you try your hand."</p>

<p>I raised mine to my shoulder, and pointing it toward a conspicuous
savage, pulled the trigger. As might be expected, I came about
as near to him as I did to Nat, in front.</p>

<p>"It will take a long time for me to accomplish that feat," said
I.</p>

<p>"Wal, yer goes agin."</p>

<p>And again was the fatal rifle discharged, and again did a savage
bite the dust.</p>

<p>Still the pursuers maintained their ground, seemingly determined
to overtake us at all hazards. They were separating and scattering
over the prairie, with the evident intention of hemming us in.
At this moment we came up to Nat.</p>

<p>"Why don’t you run?" he asked, impatiently. "They’ll shoot us
all afore we know it."</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished his words, when the pursuers did fire,
and with an uncomfortable effect, too. The bullets were plainly
heard whistling through the air beside us, and one actually cut
its way through the upper part of Nat’s hat, some eight or ten
inches from the crown of his head. He dodged nervously, and jerking
the hat off his head, held it up to view.</p>

<p>"Just look there!" he exclaimed, indignantly, putting his finger
through the orifice.</p>

<p>"What of it?" gruffly asked Biddon.</p>

<p>"That’s a pretty question to ask, I should think! I swow I won’t
stand any such work as this."</p>

<p>And giving his horse the rein, he shot rapidly ahead.</p>

<p>"I guess we mought as well," remarked Biddon, letting his horse
have free rein.</p>

<p>The race was now decided. At such speed as we went, of course
the pursuers were soon left behind, and in an hour not one was
visible, all of them being either distanced or having voluntarily
withdrawn.</p>

<p>Our course was southwest; so that we had lost considerable ground,
and were obliged to make a long <em>detour</em> to regain the
trail. We camped at night about as far south as the previous camp,
but farther west. In the morning we struck due north, and continued
in this direction for several days.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the particulars of our journey to
the northwest. We continued traveling onward for three days, when
we reached the region where it was intended we should remain until
spring. This was much further northward than I suspected; in fact,
it was but a few miles distant from the Hudson Bay Territory,
and upon one of the remote tributaries of the Missouri. We had
entered a climate that even now, was like the winter of the one
we had left. We had entered a mighty wilderness, where, ere we
left it, we were doomed to pass through some strange experiences,
and of which I now shall speak.</p>

<p>We had detected signs of beavers at several streams which we
crossed during the last day or two of our journey, but Biddon
paid no attention to them until about the middle of the afternoon,
when we reached a small river, flowing nearly due south, and passing
through the Hudson Bay Territory in its course. This stream we
forded, and, as we reached the opposite side, he remarked:</p>

<p>"Yer’ the spot whar we’re goin’ to squat."</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth remarking that the section was a wooded country.
We had passed over no clear prairie during the day, and were in
the midst of a deep wood. The trees were of nearly every conceivable
kind&mdash;the cottonwood predominating, with oak, elm, ash, walnut,
and such as are common in our own forests.</p>

<p>After crossing, the trapper headed directly up-stream for a short
distance, when he turned to the left and descended into a valley.
Here he dismounted.</p>

<p>"Take yer fixins’," said he, "and turn the hosses loose."</p>

<p>"Won’t they wander away?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<em>Yourn</em> may, but mine <em>won’t</em>; you’ve got to take
your chances, though. ’Tain’t likely they’ll be ’sturbed, ’cept
by grizzlys and reds."</p>

<p>The spot selected was a broad bottom of rich grass, inclosed
by thick walls of undergrowth upon every side. Here we left our
horses, and, taking our saddles and trappings, moved away.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been here before?" I asked of the trapper.</p>

<p>"I stayed yer last season, but didn’t ’spect to come back. Howsumever,
I changed my mind, and yer we is. Move keerful and don’t make
a big trail."</p>

<p>We followed nearly a quarter of a mile directly up-stream, when
he halted, and looked carefully about him.</p>

<p>"I don’t s’pose thar’s reds ’bout, but thar’s no tellin’ whar
they is. I didn’t see none last year, but they mought be ’bout
now. Jes’ hold on a minute."</p>

<p>The banks of the stream were fringed by a deep under-growth upon
both sides. Stepping forward to the water’s edge, the trapper
parted the branches, and glancing a moment within, motioned for
us to approach.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," said he, "there hain’t been no reds poki’ ’bout
yer while I’s gone."</p>

<p>With this he stooped and pushed a small canoe into the water
and slipped within it.</p>

<p>We joined him, although our combined weight brought the frail
vessel down to its very gunwales. It was made of bark after the
Indian fashion, very light, but strong. Biddon dipped a long Indian
paddle in the water and we moved slowly up-stream. After going
a short distance, he again touched the bank, and from beneath
another lot of shrubbery drew forth a number of beaver traps.
These were similar to the common trap used in all parts of the
world, and set much after the same fashion, but with a very different
bait. At every point where signs of the animals were visible,
he dug down the bank, so as to make a certain spot perpendicular.
Just beneath the surface of the water he then placed the trap.
The next and last proceeding was to smear the banks around with
a very odoriferous oil, obtained from the beaver itself. This
smell attracts the beavers in the vicinity, who immediately swim
to the shore to learn more of it. The trap is so arranged that
one is sure to place his foot directly upon it for support in
ascending the bank, and the natural consequence follows. He is
caught and falls into his mortal enemy’s hands.</p>

<p>"Ef one don’t have a dinner on beaver tails tomorrow, then I’m
a beaver," remarked Biddon, after he had set all his traps, and
headed his canoe down stream.</p>

<p>"A dinner on beaver tails!" exclaimed Nat, in astonishment. "That
must be a fine dinner, I swow."</p>

<p>"If you had read much of these animals, you would know that the
part mentioned by Biddon, is the most delicious and nourishing
portion," said I.</p>

<p>"And when you gits a bite of it, you’ll find it so, I reckons!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," replied Nat, doubtingly; "but whar ar’ you going
to take us?"</p>

<p>"You’ll find out when we get thar."</p>

<p>The trapper rowed the canoe quite a distance down stream, when
he sheered it into shore close to where a huge chestnut, larger
than any I had ever before witnessed, overhung the water. Its
base was enveloped by a mass of undergrowth, denser than common,
and we were obliged to stoop to the edge of the boat before we
could make our way beneath it. As we sprang up the bank, it pulled
up behind us, and I then noticed that the chestnut was hollow,
and had a deep orifice at its base.</p>

<p>"Foller," commanded Biddon, stooping and crawling beneath it.</p>

<p>We did so, although there was some hesitation upon my part, and
my astonishment was unbounded at what I witnessed when within.
At first there was nothing visible but the intense darkness, and
I stood, fearful of advancing or retreating.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Biddon?" asked Nat, in a slightly wavering tone.
The next instant the trapper struck a light; and as its rays filled
the chamber, I repeat, my astonishment was unbounded. We were
standing in an open space, at least eight feet in diameter. The
chestnut was but a mere shell, with its trunk but a few inches
in thickness at the most. The interior of this was fitted up like
a house. The rotten chunks upon the sides had been torn down and
formed a pleasant, velvety carpet beneath the feet. All around
the <em>walls</em> were hung numerous furs, and a pile at one
side afforded a bed such as we had not enjoyed for weeks. Added
to all this, there was an arrangement so as to make it perfectly
easy and convenient to kindle a fire. Nat was the first to express
his unbounded astonishment.</p>

<p>"This beats all. I never seen anything like it. But don’t the
Injins know anything of it?"</p>

<p>"No, <em>sir</em>; and I cac’late as how they won’t neyther,
ef you don’t tell ’em."</p>

<p>"Oh! I won’t tell them. I swow this is queer," and he looked
slowly about and above him. "What’s that hole for?" he asked,
pointing to a small orifice just visible far above us.</p>

<p>"That’s fur the smoke to go out."</p>

<p>"But it must be likely to attract attention," I remarked.</p>

<p>"I never start a fire ’cept at night."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;wonderful!" and I, too, gazed admiringly about me. The
light made the whole interior visible. The dark, snuff-colored
fragments of decayed wood hung in ponderous masses above us, and
the immense diameter gradually tapered as it ascended, until only
the small opening, far above, was seen, resembling a faint star.
The thickness of the wood, together with the great number of furs,
protected us so well from the cold, that there could be little
need of fire in the coldest weather, except for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>"This is rather odd, I allow, to you, Jarsey; but ef you had
been with me down on the Yallerstone, you’d seen suthin’ as would’ve
made you look, you would. You may shoot me, ef you wouldn’t."</p>

<p>"I suppose I should, but not more than this has."</p>

<p>"Mebbe not, but don’t stand gapin’ there all day. It’s gittin’
dark, and we’ll have our fodder."</p>

<p>The fire was now started, and the smoke ascended finely, escaping
at the outlet. A good slice of meat was cooked, and we made a
hearty supper upon it. After this the fire was allowed to slumber,
but the light remained burning until a late hour. We lit our pipes,
and chatted dreamily for a long time in our new home. The trapper,
feeling in the mood, related many reminiscences of his life, including
adventures both tragical and comical, and Nat gave a few of his
own experiences. At a late hour we ceased, and fell into a peaceful,
dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>When I awoke the trapper had disappeared. Nat was stretched beside
me still asleep. In a short time the former entered as noiselessly
as he had departed.</p>

<p>"What fortune?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Good; had two fat fellers. Wake up, and we’ll have a meal as
is a meal."</p>

<p>Nat soon made a movement, and, after several yawns, became fully
awake. The trapper kindled a small fire, and cooked his beaver
tails. The two made as choice and delicious a meal as I had ever
eaten. Nat was convinced by one taste.</p>

<p>The day was clear and pleasant, and Biddon expressed his determination
of going up the stream in order to see the signs of game. I accompanied
him, but Nat chose to remain at home and sleep a few hours longer.</p>

<p>We sauntered carelessly forth up the stream through the tangled
underwood. It was a clear day in autumn; the air was keen and
bracing, and the woods gloriously fine. Some of the leaves were
just beginning to fall, and they made a dappled and fiery carpet
for our feet, rustling with a soft, pleasant sound at every step.
Now and then we could hear the shrill notes of some songster of
the forest, and once or twice the faint bay of some distant animal.</p>

<p>We had wandered some distance, when Biddon proposed turning back,
as he had just discovered he had forgotten his pipe. I was too
well pleased, however, with the prospect to retrace my footsteps.
Accordingly, we parted company for a time, he remarking that probably
he would return when he had regained his indispensable article.</p>

<p>Left alone, I now wandered dreamily onward, in a pleasant reverie,
hardly conscious of what I was doing, until I was recalled to
my senses by the grandeur of a new scene that suddenly burst upon
my view. I had ascended a small rise on the bank of the stream,
from which I had an extended view of the river. I stood for a
moment wrapt in the glories of the scene. Far behind could be
discerned the broad bosom of the river, stretching away like a
vast body of molten silver, bordered on either side by the mighty
forest, until it disappeared in a sweeping curve, within the interminable
wilderness. Above me for several miles the same winding course
could be seen, brightly glistening for miles. Not a ripple disturbed
the surface, save when a bird skimmed over it, just tipping its
wings, and making a flashing circle or two. The blue sky above,
unflecked by a single cloud, harmonized so well with the magnificent
view, that I stood a long time, drinking in the splendor of the
scene.</p>

<p>My eye was still resting upon the glistening bend of the river
above, when the quietness of the scene was interrupted by a dark
speck which suddenly came in view, around a curve about a mile
above. At first I supposed it to be some animal or log floating
upon the surface; but as I looked at it, I saw to my astonishment
that it was a canoe coming down-stream. Several forms were visible,
yet their number, at that distance, was uncertain. The bright
flash of their paddles was visible in the morning sunshine, and
they maintained their place near the center of the stream.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "In the stern, with a guiding oar, sat a young
female."]</p>

<p>I scrutinized them, vainly to make out their number, until it
occurred to me that it would be best to make myself invisible.
The approaching canoe might contain nothing but Indians, and it
was not desirable that our presence in this section should be
known to any but ourselves. I slipped behind the trunk of a tree,
nearer the water, yet still upon the elevated knoll, which entirely
concealed my body from sight.</p>

<p>From this point I watched the approach of the canoe with interest.
Soon it came nigh enough to enable me to distinguish the forms
within it. There were two Indian warriors seated each with a paddle
in his hand, but not using them, except to keep the canoe in the
channel, and in the stern, with a guiding oar, sat a young female.
I supposed her a squaw, belonging to the same tribe with her companions,
and scrutinized her as closely as my position would permit. She
wore a beautiful head-dress, gayly ornamented with stained porcupine
quills and beads, and a brilliant crimson shawl enveloped her
slight form. The savages maintained their places as motionless
as statues, their gaze apparently resting upon the stream behind
them; while that of the female was fixed upon the stream in front,
and her whole attention absorbed in directing her canoe.</p>

<p>I know not whether the inmates discovered me before I concealed
myself, but I fancied I detected a glance of the Indians at my
hiding-place, as they floated slowly by, and some cause led the
female, when directly opposite, and but a few hundred feet distant,
to turn her face toward me. Judge of my astonishment, at perceiving
that she was not an Indian&mdash;but a white woman! Her appearance,
as she turned her gaze directly upon the spot where I was standing,
I can never forget. She was so close at hand, and my view so perfect
in the clear sunlight, that I saw every feature. The pale white
face, surrounded by dark, luxuriant hair falling upon the shoulders,
the dark eyes shaded by long inky lashes, and the mute, untranslatable
look, haunted me for many a night after. She merely glanced toward
me, and slowly floated past.</p>

<p>Dropping upon my hands and knees, I crept hastily from the knoll
into the undergrowth below, and made my way hurriedly but noiselessly
to the stream. I could not have been over a minute in so doing,
but when I reached the water, and peered through the bushes, not
a trace of the canoe was visible. I looked closely into each shore,
up and down the stream, everywhere that I could look, but could
not detect the slightest ripple or movement to account for this
mysterious disappearance. For over an hour I waited in the hope
that the canoe would reappear, but I saw nothing more of it.</p>
