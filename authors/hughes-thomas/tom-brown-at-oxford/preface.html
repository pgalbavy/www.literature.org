<p>Author's Dedication</p>

<p>To the Rev. F. D. Maurice, in memory of fourteen years' fellow
work, and in testimony of ever increasing affection and gratitude
this volume is dedicated by</p>

<p>The Author.</p>

<p><em>PREFACE</em></p>

<p>Prefaces written to explain the objects and meaning of a book,
or to make any appeal, <em>ad miseracordiam</em> or other, in
its favor, are, in my opinion, nuisances. Any book worth reading
will explain its own objects and meaning, and the more it is criticized
and turned inside out, the better for it and its author. Of all
books, too, it seems to me that novels require prefaces least&mdash;at
any rate, on their first appearance. Notwithstanding which belief,
I must ask readers for three minutes' patience before they make
trial of this book.</p>

<p>The natural pleasure which I felt at the unlooked for popularity
of the first part of the present story, was much lessened by the
pertinacity with which many persons, acquaintance as well as strangers,
would insist (both in public and in private) on identifying the
hero and the author. On the appearance of the first few numbers
of the present continuation in Macmillan's Magazine, the same
thing occurred, and, in fact, reached such a pitch, as to lead
me to make some changes to the story. Sensitiveness on such a
point may seem folly, but if the readers had felt the sort of
loathing and disgust which one feels at the notion of painting
a favorable likeness of oneself in a work of fiction, they would
not wonder at it. So, now that this book is finished and Tom Brown,
so far as I am concerned, is done with for ever, I must take this,
my first and last chance of saying, that he is not I, either as
boy or man&mdash;in fact, not to beat about the bush, is a much braver,
and nobler, and purer fellow than I ever was.</p>

<p>When I first resolved to write the book, I tried to realize to
myself what the commonest type of English boy of the upper middle
class was, so far as my experience went; and to that type I have
throughout adhered, trying simply to give a good specimen of the
genus. I certainly have placed him in the country, and scenes
which I know best myself, for the simple reason, that I knew them
better than any others, and therefore was less likely to blunder
in writing about them.</p>

<p>As to the name, which has been, perhaps, the chief "cause of
offense," in this matter, the simple facts are, that I chose the
name "Brown," because it stood first in the trio of "Brown, Jones,
and Robinson," which had become a sort of synonym for the middle
classes of Great Britain. It happens that my own name and that
of Brown have no single letter in common. As to the Christian
name of "Tom," having chosen Brown, I could hardly help taking
it as the prefix. The two names have gone together in England
for two hundred years, and the joint name has not enjoyed much
of a reputation for respectability. This suited me exactly. I
wanted the <em>commonest</em> name I could get, and did not want
any name which had the least heroic, or aristocratic, or even
respectable savor about it. Therefore I had a natural leaning
to the combination which I found ready to my hand. Moreover, I
believed "Tom" to be a more specially English name than John,
the only other as to which I felt the least doubt. Whether it
be that Thomas a Beckett was for so long the favorite English
saint, or from whatever other cause, it certainly seems to be
the fact, that the name "Thomas," is much commoner in England
than in any other country. The words, "tom-fool,", "tom-boy,"
etc., though, perhaps not complimentary to the "Tom's"
of England, certainly show how large a family they must have been.
These reasons decided me to keep the Christian name which had
been always associated with "Brown"; and I own that the fact that
it happened to be my own, never occurred to me as an objection,
till the mischief was done, past recall.</p>

<p>I have only, then, to say, that neither is the hero a portrait
of myself, nor is there any other portrait in either of the books,
except in the case of Dr. Arnold, where the true name is given.
My deep feeling of gratitude to him, and reverence for his memory,
emboldened me to risk the attempt at a portrait in his case, so
far as the character was necessary for the work. With these remarks,
I leave this volume in the hands of readers.</p>
