<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Now it is a serious undertaking for any one to make a journey
to the gold regions at the headwaters of the Yukon, as every one
will admit who has been there. All know of the starvation which
threatened the people of Dawson City during the winter of 1897-98,
when the whole country was stirred with sympathy, and our Government
made use of reindeer to take food to the suffering miners.</p>

<p>No dangers of that kind confronted Roswell Palmer and Frank Mansley,
but their parents could not contemplate the undertaking without
anxiety. The mothers held more than one consultation, and there
was a time when both were inclined to object to the boys going
at all. The dread of that desolate, icy region in the far Northwest
grew upon them, until it is safe to say that if the departure
had been postponed for only a few days Mrs. Mansley and Mrs. Palmer
would never have given their consent. But Mr. Palmer laughed at
their fears, and assured them there was no cause for alarm. He
spoke so cheeringly that they caught his hopefulness, but neither
noticed the lump he swallowed, nor with what difficulty he kept
back the tears when the hour for parting came. He was fully as
anxious as they, but he knew how to dissemble, and would not have
confessed his real emotions for the world.</p>

<p>After all, it was Jeff Graham who deserved the credit for the
willingness of the parents to see their sons venture upon the
long and dangerous journey. To him the trip was much the same
as a visit to Los Angeles or the Yosemite Valley. His self-confidence
never faltered. He was sure it would be only a pleasant outing,
with the certainty of a big reward at the end of it. The sly fellow
dwelt on the pale complexion and debilitated appearance of the
lads. He even said that a cough which he heard Frank try to suppress
(in swallowing some fruit, a bit of it went the "wrong way"&mdash;it
was nothing more) indicated the insidious approach of consumption.
Jeff was the only one who was able to see any paleness in the
countenance of the young athletes, or suspect them of being otherwise
than fine specimens of youthful health and vigor; but since he
was as solemn as a judge when making his declaration, the father
and mother of the one and the mother of the other could not feel
quite certain there were not grounds for his fears.</p>

<p>And so it being settled that the boys were to go to the Klondike
gold fields under the care of the grim old Argonaut, it only remained
to complete the preparations in the short time at their disposal.</p>

<p>Had the mothers been free to carry out their wishes, their sons
would have been loaded down with baggage upon leaving San Francisco.
There are so many things which seem indispensable, when an affectionate
mother is considering the comfort of her only son, that she is
sure to overwhelm him. At first the mothers insisted upon each
being furnished with a large trunk, which would have to be crowded
to bursting to contain what was needed, but Jeff put his foot
down.</p>

<p>"Nothin' of the kind. Didn't I tell you that we'll git all that's
needed at Juneau or Dyea or some point on the road? You've forgot
that."</p>

<p>"But, Jeff, there are some articles which they <em>must</em>
take with them."</p>

<p>The old miner lit his pipe, sat down in the rocking-chair at
the Palmer home, where the mothers had met while the boys and
Mr. Palmer were down-town making a few forgotten purchases. The
old fellow chuckled a little and then became serious.</p>

<p>"In the fust place, not a trunk!" and he shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>"Do you expect them to take what they want in their pockets?"</p>

<p>"Umph! it would be the sensiblest thing they could do, but we
can't be bothered with any trunks, that would be sure to be lost
in the first shuffle. Each of us will have a good, big, strong
carpet-bag, and nothing more. You can cram them as full as you
choose, but what you can't git in has got to be left at home."</p>

<p>There could be no mistake as to Jeff's earnestness, and neither
mother attempted to gainsay his words.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "jest lay out on the floor what you have in your
mind that the youngsters need, and I'll tell you what they <em>do</em>
need."</p>

<p>"You mustn't forget," observed Mrs. Palmer, as she started to
comply, "that the boys are now down-town buying some things which
they positively cannot get along without."</p>

<p>"As, for instance, what?"</p>

<p>"Well, tooth-brushes, soap, combs, courtplaster, handkerchiefs,
buttons, thread, quinine, and pain-killer."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Jeff so quizzically that both ladies laughed.</p>

<p>"You have forgotten," added Mrs. Mansley, "the shirts, underclothing,
socks, and shoes."</p>

<p>"They are here," replied Mrs. Palmer, stepping briskly into the
next room and returning with her arms full.</p>

<p>"I've got to lay down the law," observed Jeff, just as Mr. Palmer
and the two boys came in, glowing with excitement. "Here are the
young men, and they look as if they had bought out half the town.
Dump everything on the floor, and let's sort 'em out."</p>

<p>When the pile was complete the miner gravely remarked:</p>

<p>"Nothing less than a freight-car will answer for all that stuff,
and I don't b'lieve we can charter one through to Dawson. In the
first place, I s'pose the tooth-brushes will have to go, though
I never found any use for such things, and I can crack a bull
hickory-nut with my teeth. The same may be obsarved of the soap
and combs, while a roll of court plaster don't take up much room.
We'll be likely to need thread, buttons, and some patches for
our clothes, though I've got a supply in my carpetbag. The quinine
and pain-killer they may take if you can find a corner to squeeze
'em in. As to the underclothing, extra shirts, it depends whether
there is room for 'em; but the boys mustn't think of taking their
dress suits along, 'cause <em>I'm</em> not going to. There ain't
any room for violins, pianos, or music-boxes, and the only clothing
and shoes that can go with this party is what we wear on our bodies
and feet."</p>

<p>"Suppose the shoes wear out?" asked Mrs. Mansley in dismay.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go barefoot. Now, see here, we shan't be away more
than three months. A pair of well-made shoes will last longer
than that, and the same is true about our clothes, though we have
the means of mending them, if modesty calls for it, which ain't
likely to be the case in the diggings. Caps, coats, vests, trousers,
and shoes are to sarve from the day we start till we come back.
If one of the boys casts a shoe and loses it, we'll find some
way of getting him another. What's this?" suddenly asked Jeff,
picking up a small volume from the floor and opening it.</p>

<p>He looked at the fly-leaf, on which was written: "To my dear
boy Roswell, from his affectionate mother. Read a portion every
day, and be guided in your thoughts, words, and deeds by its blessed
precepts. Then it shall always be well with thee."</p>

<p>There were two of the small Bibles, the other being similarly
inscribed with the name of Frank Mansley. The boys and their parents
were standing around the seated miner, and no one spoke. He looked
at each precious volume in turn, and then reverently laid them
among the pile of indispensables.</p>

<p>"That's the mother of it," he said, as if speaking with himself;
"it's a good many years since my poor old mother done the same
thing for me when I started for Californy, and I've got the book
among my things yet, though I don't read it as often as I should.
<em>Them</em> go if we have to leave everything else behind."</p>

<p>When the task was completed, every one acknowledged the excellent
judgment displayed by Jeff Graham. The three were arrayed in strong,
thick, warm clothing, and, in addition, each carried a heavy overcoat
on his arm. In the valises were crowded underclothing, shirts,
handkerchiefs, and the articles that have been already specified.
It was wonderful how skilfully the mothers did the packing. When
it looked as if every inch of space was filled, they found a crevice
into which another bottle of standard medicine, an extra bit of
soap, more thread and needles and conveniences of which no other
person would think were forced without adding to the difficulty
of locking the valises.</p>

<p>Nothing remaining to be done, on the following day the boys kissed
their tearful mothers good-by, and warmly shook hands with Mr.
Palmer, who brokenly murmured, "God bless you! be good boys!"
as he saw them off on the steamer bound for Seattle, and thence
to Juneau, where they safely arrived one day early in April, 1897.</p>

<p>In making such a voyage, many people are necessarily thrown together
in more or less close companionship, with the result of forming
numerous acquaintances and sometimes lasting friendships. Following
the advice of Jeff, the cousins had little to say about their
plans, though they became interested in more than one passenger,
and often speculated between themselves as to the likelihood of
certain ones meeting success or failure in the gold regions.</p>

<p>There were three sturdy lumbermen all the way from Maine. A curious
fact about them was that, although they were not related at all,
the name of each was Brown. They were light-hearted and the life
of the large party. One Brown had a good tenor voice, and often
sang popular ballads with taste and great acceptability. Another
played the violin with considerable skill, and sometimes indulged
in jig tunes, to which his friends, and occasionally others, danced
an accompaniment.</p>

<p>"They'll succeed," was the verdict of Roswell, "for they are
strong, healthy, and will toil like beavers."</p>

<p>"And what of the two men smoking their pipes just beyond the
fiddler?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"I had a talk with them the other day; one has been a miner in
Australia, and the other spent two years in the diamond mines
of Kimberley, South Africa. Meeting for the first time in San
Francisco, they formed a partnership; they, too, are rugged and
must understand their business."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. Do you remember that stoop-shouldered old man
whose room is next to ours?"</p>

<p>"The one who has such dreadful coughing spells in the night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is far gone with consumption, and yet he won't believe
there's anything the matter with him. He is worse than when he
came on board: but he says it is only a slight cold which will
soon pass off, and he is just as hopeful as you or I of taking
a lot of nuggets home with him."</p>

<p>"He never will see the other side of Chilkoot Pass."</p>

<p>"I doubt whether he will ever see this side."</p>

<p>Thus the boys speculated, sometimes amused and sometimes saddened
by what they saw. There was a big San Francisco policeman, who
said he had cracked heads so long that he thought he knew how
to crack some golden nuggets; a correspondent of a prominent New
York newspaper, whose situation was enviable, since his salary
and expenses were guaranteed, and he was free to gather gold when
the opportunity offered; a voluble insurance agent, who made a
nuisance of himself by his solicitations, in season and out; a
massive football-player, who had no companion, and did not wish
any, since he was sure he could buck the line, make a touchdown,
and kick a goal; a gray-haired head of a family, who, having lost
his all, had set out to gather another fortune along the Klondike.
He walked briskly, threw back his shoulders, and tried hard to
appear young and vigorous, but the chances were strongly against
him. There were a number of bright clerks; a clergyman, pleasant
and genial with all; gamblers, with pallid faces and hair and
mustaches dyed an intense black, who expected to win the gold
for which others dug; young and middle-aged men, some with their
brave wives, serene and calmly prepared to bear their full share
of privation and toil; and adventurers, ready to go anywhere for
the sake of adventure itself. In truth, it was a motley assemblage,
which to the boys was like a continually shifting panorama of
hope, ambition, honesty, dishonor, pluck, and human enterprise
and daring, that was ever present throughout the thousand miles
of salt water that stretches from Seattle to Juneau.</p>

<p>Juneau, the metropolis of Alaska, was founded in 1880, and named
in honor of Joseph Juneau, the discoverer of gold on Douglas Island,
two miles distant. There is located the Treadwell quartz-mill,
the largest in the world. The city nestles at the base of a precipitous
mountain, thirty-three hundred feet high, has several thousand
inhabitants, with its wooden houses regularly laid out, good wharves,
water works, electric lights, banks, hotels, newspapers, schools,
and churches.</p>

<p>"Here's where we get our outfit," said Jeff, as they hurried
over the plank to the landing. "But where can Tim be?"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly as soon as he was clear of the crowd, and
looked around for the one who was the cause of his coming to this
out-of-the-way corner of the world. He was still gazing when a
man, dressed much the same as himself, but short, stockily built,
and with the reddest hair and whiskers the boys had ever seen,
his round face aglow with pleasure stepped hastily forward from
the group of spectators and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jiff, it does me good to see your handsome silf; and how
have ye been, and how do ye expect to continue to be?"</p>

<p>Tim McCabe was an Irishman who, when overtaken by misfortune
in San Francisco, found Jeff Graham the good Samaritan, and he
could never show sufficient gratitude therefor. It was only one
of the many kindly deeds the old miner was always performing,
but he did not meet in every case with such honest thankfulness.</p>

<p>Jeff clasped his hand warmly, and then looked at the smiling
boys, to whom he introduced his friend, and who shook their hands.
He eyed them closely, and, with the quizzical expression natural
to many of his people, said:</p>

<p>"And these are the laddies ye wrote me about? Ye said they were
likely broths of boys; but, Jiff, ye didn't do them justice&mdash;they
desarved more."</p>

<p>"Tim is always full of blarney," explained Jeff, who, it was
evident, was fond of the merry Irishman; "so you mustn't mind
him and his ways."</p>

<p>Roswell and Frank were attracted by Jeff's friend. He was one
of those persons who, despite their homeliness of face and feature,
win us by their genial nature and honest, outspoken ways. No one
ever saw a finer set of big, white teeth, nor a broader smile,
which scarcely ever was absent from the Irishman's countenance.
He shook hands with each lad in turn, giving a warm pressure and
expressing his pleasure at meeting them. "I'm glad to greet ye,
me friends," he said, as the whole party moved out of the way
of the hurrying, bustling swarm who were rushing back and forth,
each intent on his own business; "not only on your own account,
but on account of me friend Jiff."</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand you," said Roswell with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I've met Jiff before, and formed a rather fair
opinion of him; but whin a gintleman like mesilf is engaged on
some important business, them as are to be favored with me confidence
must have their credentials."</p>

<p>"And you accept our presence with him as proof that he is what
he should be?"</p>

<p>Tim gravely inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Do ye think I would admit Jiff as a partner if it was otherwise?
Not I."</p>

<p>"But," interposed Frank, "how is it with <em>us</em>? You never
saw us before."</p>

<p>"One look at them faces is enough," was the prompt reply; "ye
carry a certificate wid ye that no one can dispoot."</p>

<p>"And I should like to know," said Jeff, with assumed indignation,
"what credential <em>you</em> have to present to us, young man."</p>

<p>"Mine is the same as the young gintlemen," answered Tim, removing
his thick fur cap and displaying his whole wealth of fiery red
hair; "obsarve me countenance."</p>

<p>His face became grave for the first time, while all the rest
laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied and hungry," said Jeff; "take us where we can
get something to eat."</p>

<p>"I knew by that token that I had forgot something, and it's me
breakfast and dinner. In honor of yer coming, I've engaged the
best quarters at the leading hotel. Come wid me."</p>

<p>It was but a short distance up the street to a frame hotel, which
was kept by a corpulent German who had been in the country for
a couple of years. The men registered, during which Tim remarked
to the landlord, who seemed never to be without his long-stemmed
meerschaum pipe between his lips:</p>

<p>"This gintleman isn't the burglar that ye would think from his
looks. He belongs to a good family, or ye wouldn't obsarve him
in my company. The young gintlemen are two princes that are travelling
<em>in cog</em>. In consideration of all of them having delicate
appetites like mesilf, not forgetting the honor of their company,
ye will be glad to make a reduction in your exorbitant rates,
Baron Fritz, I am sure."</p>

<p>The phlegmatic German smiled, and in a guttural voice announced
that his terms were three dollars a day, including rooms and meals,
which, when all the circumstances are considered, was not extravagant.
The party carried their luggage to their rooms, where they prepared
themselves for the meal, which was satisfactory in every respect
and better than they expected.</p>

<p>It came out during the conversation that Tim McCabe had not a
dollar to his name, and he spoke the truth when he said that he
had not eaten a mouthful that day. It would have gone hard for
him but for the arrival of Jeff Graham, though there is such a
lively demand for labor in Juneau that he must have soon found
means to provide himself with food.</p>

<p>As for Jeff, he was glad in his heart that his old friend was
in such sore straits, inasmuch as it gave him the pleasure of
providing for him. Tim had taken out some five hundred dollars,
but a companion whom he fully trusted robbed him of it, and the
small amount left barely kept the Irishman afloat until the arrival
of the old miner.</p>

<p>Jeff Graham showed prudence in bringing a plentiful supply of
funds with him, and since he expected to take back a hundredfold
more than he brought, he could well afford to do so. Stowed away
in his safe inside pocket was fully two thousand dollars, and
inasmuch as gold is the "coin of the realm" in California, as
well as in Alaska, the funds were in shining eagles and half eagles&mdash;rather
bulky of themselves, but not uncomfortably so.</p>

<p>The experience of McCabe and Jeff prevented any mistake in providing
their outfit. They had good, warm flannels, thick woollen garments,
strong shoes, and rubber boots. Those who press their mining operations
during the long and severe winter generally use the water boot
of seal and walrus, which costs from two dollars to five dollars
a pair, with trousers made from Siberian fawn-skins and the skin
of the marmot and ground squirrel, with the outer garment of marmot-skin.
Blankets and robes, of course, are indispensable. The best are
of wolf-skin, and Jeff paid one hundred dollars apiece for those
furnished to himself and each of his companions.</p>

<p>The matter of provisions was of the first importance. A man needs
a goodly supply of nourishing food to sustain him through the
trying journey from Juneau to Dawson City, the following being
considered necessary for an able-bodied person: Twenty pounds
of flour, twelve of bacon, twelve of beans, four of butter, five
of vegetables, five of sugar, three of coffee, five of corn-meal,
one pound of tea, four cans of condensed milk, one and one half
pounds of salt, with a little pepper and mustard.</p>

<p>Because of the weight and bulk, Jeff omitted from this list the
tea, the condensed milk and butter, and while the supply in other
respects was the same, respectively, for himself and McCabe, that
of the boys was cut down about one third; for besides the food,
the party were compelled to take with them a frying-pan, a water-kettle,
a Yukon stove, a bean-pot, a drinking-cup, knives and forks, and
a large and small frying-pan.</p>

<p>Since they would find a good raft necessary, axes, hatchets,
hunting-knives, nails, one hundred and fifty feet of rope, and
two Juneau sleds were purchased. To these were added snow-shoes,
a strong duck-tent, fishing-tackle, snow-glasses to protect themselves
against snow-blindness, rubber blankets, mosquito-netting, tobacco,
and a few minor articles.</p>

<p>The start from Juneau to the gold fields should not be made before
the beginning of April. Our friends had struck that date, but
the headlong rush did not begin until some time later. One of
the principal routes is from Seattle to St. Michael, on the western
coast of Alaska, and then up that mighty river whose mouth is
near, for nearly two thousand more miles to Dawson City. The river
is open during the summer&mdash;sometimes barely four months&mdash;and our
friends took the shorter route to Juneau on the southern coast,
from which it is about a thousand miles to Dawson. While this
route is much shorter, it is a hundred times more difficult and
dangerous than by the Yukon.</p>

<p>From Juneau there are four different routes to the headwaters
of the Yukon, all crossing by separate paths the range of mountains
along the coast. They are the Dyea or Chilkoot Pass, the Chilkat,
Moore's or White Pass, and Takon. At this writing the Chilkoot
is the favorite, because it is better known than the others, but
the facilities for passing through this entrance or doorway to
the new El Dorado are certain to be greatly increased at an early
day.</p>

<p>It was learned on inquiry that another day would have to be spent
in the town before the little steamer would leave for Dyea. While
Tim and Jeff stayed at the hotel, talking over old times and laying
plans for the future, the boys strolled through the streets, which
were knee-deep with mud.</p>

<p>The curio shops on Front and Seward streets were interesting,
and from the upper end of the latter street they saw a path leading
to the Auk village, whose people claim to own the flats at the
mouth of Gold Creek. On the high ground across the stream is a
cemetery containing a number of curious totemic carvings, hung
with offerings to departed spirits. It would cost a white man
his life to disturb any of them.</p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon that the cousins were strolling
aimlessly about and had turned to retrace their steps to the hotel,
when Frank touched the arm of his companion and said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"Roswell, do you know that a strange man has been following us
for the past hour?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>ROSWELL, DO YOU KNOW THAT STRANGE MAN HAS
BEEN FOLLOWING US FOR THE PAST HOUR</em>?"]</p>

<p>"No; where is he?"</p>

<p>"On the other side of the street and a little way behind us.
Don't look around just now. I don't fancy his appearance."</p>

<p>A minute later, Roswell managed to gain a good view.</p>

<p>"I don't like his looks as well as he seems to like ours. Shall
we wait for him and ask him his business?"</p>

<p>"No need of that, for he is walking so fast, he will soon be
up with us. Here he comes, as if in a great hurry."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the boys were overtaken by the suspicious
stranger.</p>
