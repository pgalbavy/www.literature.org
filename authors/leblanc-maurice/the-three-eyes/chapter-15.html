<p>It is not only to-day, when I am relating that tragic scene, that it
appears to me in the light of a subsidiary episode to my story. I
already had that impression at the time when it was being enacted. My
reason for laying no greater stress on my alarm and on the horror of
certain facts is that all this was to me only an interlude. Massignac's
sufferings and his disappearance and Velmot's inexplicable behaviour, in
abandoning for some minutes the conduct of a matter to which he had
until then applied himself with such diabolical eagerness, were just so
many details which became blotted out by the tremendous events
represented by Benjamin Prévotelle's discovery.
</p><p>And to such an extent was this event the central point of all my
preoccupations that the idea had occurred to me, as I rushed to
Massignac's assistance, of snatching from the chair the newspaper in
which I had read the first half of the essay! To be free meant above all
things--even above saving Massignac and, through him, the formula--the
opportunity of reading the rest of the essay and of learning what the
whole world must already have learnt!
</p><p>I made the circuit of the island in my boat and, shaping my course by
certain lights, ran her ashore on the main bank. A tram went by. Some of
the shops were open. I was between Bougival and Port-Marly.
</p><p>At ten o'clock in the evening I was sitting in a bedroom in a Paris
hotel and unfolding a newspaper. But I had not had the patience to wait
so long. On the way, by the feeble lights of the tram-car, I glanced at
a few lines of the article. One word told me everything. I too was
acquainted with Benjamin Prévotelle's marvellous theory. I knew and,
knowing, I believed.
</p><p>The reader will recall the place which I had reached in my uncomfortable
perusal of the report. Benjamin Prévotelle's studies and experiments had
led him to conclude, first, that the Meudon pictures were real
cinematographic projections and, next, that these projections, since
they came from no part of the amphitheatre, must come from some point
more remote. Now the last picture, that representing the revolutionary
doings of the 21st January, was hampered by some obstacle. What
obstacle? His mental condition being what it was, what could Benjamin
Prévotelle do other than raise his eyes to the sky?
</p><p>The sky was clear. Was it also clear beyond the part that could be
observed from the lower benches of the amphitheatre? Benjamin Prévotelle
climbed to the top and looked at the horizon.
</p><p>Yonder, towards the west, clouds were floating.
</p><p>And Benjamin Prévotelle continued, repeating his phrase:
</p><pre>
      "Clouds were floating! And, because of the fact that
      clouds were floating on the horizon, the pictures on
      the screen grew less distinct or even vanished
      altogether. It may be said that this was a
      coincidence. On three separate occasions, when the
      film lost its brilliancy, I turned towards the
      horizon: on each occasion clouds were passing. Could
      three coincidences of this kind be due to chance? Can
      any scientific mind fail to see herein a relation of
      cause and effect or to admit that, in this instance,
      as in that of many visions previously observed, which
      were disturbed by an unknown cause, the interposition
      of the clouds acted as a veil <u>by intercepting the
      projection on its way</u>? I was not able to make a
      fourth test. But that did not matter. I had now
      advanced so far that I was able to work and reflect
      without being stopped by any obstacle. There is no
      such thing as being checked mid-way in our pursuit of
      certain truths. Once we catch a glimpse of them, they
      become revealed in their entirety.
      "At first, to be sure, scientific logic, instead of
      referring the explanation which I was so eagerly
      seeking to the data of human science, flung me, almost
      despite myself, into an ever more mysterious region.
      And, when, after this second display, I returned
      home--this was three hours ago at most--I asked myself
      whether it would not be better to confess my ignorance
      than to go rushing after theories which suddenly
      seemed to me to lie beyond the confines of science.
      But how could I have done so? Despite myself I
      continued to work at the problem, to imagine.
      Induction fitted into deduction. Proofs were
      accumulating. Even as I was hesitating to enter upon a
      path whose direction confounded me, I reached the goal
      and found myself sitting down to a table, pen in hand,
      to write a report which was dictated by my reason as
      much as by my imagination.
      "Thus the first step was taken: in obedience to the
      imperious summons of reality, I admitted the theory of
      extra-terrestrial communications, or at least of
      communications coming from beyond the clouds. Was I
      to think that they emanated from some airship hovering
      in the sky, beyond that cloud-belt? Leaving aside the
      fact that no such airship was ever observed, we must
      remark that luminous projections powerful enough to
      light the screen at Meudon from a distance of several
      miles would leave in the air a trail of diffused light
      which could not escape notice. Lastly, in the present
      condition of science, we are at liberty to declare
      positively that such projections would be quite
      incapable of realization.
      "What then? Were we to cast our eyes farther, traverse
      space at one bound and assume that the projections
      have an origin which is not only extraterrestrial but
      extrahuman?
      "Now the great word is written. The idea is no longer
      my property. How will it be received by those to whom
      this report will reveal it to-morrow? Will they
      welcome it with the same fervour and the same
      awe-struck emotion that thrilled me, with the distrust
      at the beginning and the same final enthusiasm?
      "Let us, if you will, recover our composure. The
      examination of the phenomena has led us to a very
      definite conclusion. However startling this conclusion
      be, let us examine it also, with perfect detachment,
      and try to subject it to all the tests which we are
      able to impose upon it.
      "Extrahuman projections: what does that mean? The
      expression seems vague; and our thoughts wander at
      random. Let us look into the matter more closely. Let
      us first of all establish as an impassable boundary
      the frontiers of our solar system and, in this immense
      circle, concentrate our gaze upon the more accessible
      and consequently the nearer points. For, when all is
      said, if there be really projections, they must
      necessarily, whether extrahuman or human, emanate from
      fixed points, situated in space. They must therefore
      emanate from those luminaries within sight of the
      earth to which, in the last report, we have some right
      to attribute the origin of those projections. I
      consider that there are five such fixed points: the
      moon, the sun, Jupiter, Mars and Venus.
      "If, furthermore, we suppose as the more likely theory
      that the projections follow a rectilinear direction,
      then the unknown luminary from which the apparitions
      emanate will have to satisfy two conditions: first, it
      must be in such a position that photographs can be
      taken from it; secondly, it must be in such a position
      that the images obtained can be transmitted to us. Let
      us take as an instance a case in which it is possible
      to fix the place and date. The first Montgolfier
      balloon, filled with hot air, was sent up from Annonay
      at four o'clock in the afternoon on the 5th of June,
      1783. It is easy, by referring to the contemporary
      calendars, to learn which celestial bodies were at
      that moment above the horizon and at what height. We
      thus find that Mars, Jupiter and the moon were
      invisible, whereas the sun and Venus were at 50 and 23
      degrees respectively above the horizon of Annonay and,
      of course, towards the west. These two luminaries
      alone then were in a position to witness the
      experiment of the brothers Montgolfier. But they did
      not witness it from the same altitude: a view taken
      from the sun would have shown things as seen from
      above, whereas, at the same hour, Venus would have
      shown then from an angle very nearly approaching the
      horizontal.
      "This is a first clue. Are we able to check it? Yes,
      by turning up the date on which the projections of the
      view then secured as observed by Victorien Beaugrand
      and by determining whether, on that date, the
      projecting luminary was able to light up the screen at
      Meudon. Well, on that day, at the hour which Victorien
      Beaugrand has given us, Mars and the moon were
      invisible, Jupiter was in the east, the sun close to
      the horizon and Venus a little way above it.
      Projections emanating from the last-named planet
      could therefore have fallen upon the screen, which as
      we know faced westwards.
      "This example shows us that, however frail my theory
      may appear, we are now able and shall be even better
      able in the future to subject it to a strict control.
      I did not fail to resort to this method in respect of
      the other pictures, and I will give in a special
      table, appended to this essay, a list of the data
      which I have verified, a list necessarily drawn up, in
      some haste. Well, in all the cases which I examined,
      the views were taken and projected under such
      conditions that they can logically be referred to the
      planet Venus <u>and to that planet alone</u>.
      "Yet again, two of these views, that which revealed to
      Victorien Beaugrand and his uncle the execution of
      Miss Cavell and that which enabled us to witness the
      bombardment of Rheims, seem to have been taken, the
      first in the morning, because Miss Cavell was executed
      in the morning, and the second from the east, because
      it showed a shell fired at a statue which stood on the
      east front of the cathedral. This proves that the
      views could be taken indifferently in the morning or
      the evening, from the west or the east; and it is
      surely a powerful argument in favour of my theory,
      because Venus, which is both the Evening and the
      Morning Star, faces the earth at daybreak from the
      east and at sunset from the west and because Noël
      Dorgeroux (as M. Victorien Beaugrand has just
      confirmed to me by telephone), because Noël Dorgeroux,
      that magnificent visionary, had had his wall
      constructed <u>with two surfaces having an identical
      inclination towards the sky, one facing west, the
      other east and each in turn exposed to the rays of
      Venus the Evening Star and Venus the Morning Star</u>!
      "These are the proofs which I am able to furnish for
      the time being. There are others. There is for
      instance the time of the apparitions. Venus is sinking
      towards the horizon; on the earth twilight reigns; and
      the pictures can be formed regardless of the sunlight.
      Remark also that Noël Dorgeroux, deferring all his
      experiments, last winter altered the whole arrangement
      of the Yard and demolished the old garden. Now this
      break coincides exactly with a period during which the
      position of Venus on the farther side of the sun
      prevented it from communicating with the earth. All
      these proofs will be reinforced by a more exhaustive
      essay and by an analytical examination of the pictures
      that have been or will be shown to us.
      "But though I have written this report without
      stopping to answer the objections and difficulties
      which arise at every line, though I have been
      contented myself with setting forth the logical and
      almost inevitable sequence of the deductions which led
      up to my theory. I should be failing in respect to the
      academy and to the public if I allowed it to be
      believed that I am not fully conscious of the weight
      of those objections and difficulties. I did not,
      however, consider this a reason for abandoning my
      task. Though it be our duty to bow when science utters
      a formal veto, on the other hand duty orders us to
      persist when science is content merely to confess its
      ignorance. This is the twofold principle which I
      observed in seeking no longer the source of the
      projections, but rather the manner in which they were
      able to appear, for that is where the whole problem
      lies. It is easy to declare that they emanate from
      Venus; it is not easy to explain how they travel
      through space and how they exercise their action, at a
      distance of many millions of miles, on an
      imperceptible screen with a surface of three or four
      hundred square feet. I am confronted with physical
      laws which I am not entitled to transgress. I am
      entitled at most to advance where science is obliged
      to be mute.
      "Therefore and without any sort of discussion I admit
      that we are debarred from supposing that light can be
      the agent of the transmissions which have been
      observed. The laws of diffraction indeed are
      absolutely opposed to the strictly rectilinear
      propagation of luminous rays and hence to the
      formation and reception of pictures at the exceptional
      distances actually under consideration. Not only are
      the laws of geometrical optics merely a somewhat rough
      approximation, but the complicated refractions which
      would inevitably occur in the atmospheres of the earth
      and Venus would disturb the optical images. The veto
      of science therefore is peremptory in so far as the
      possibility of these optical transmissions is
      concerned.
      "For that matter, I should be quite willing to believe
      that the inhabitants of Venus have already tried to
      correspond with us through the intermediary of
      luminous signals and that, if they abandoned their
      endeavours, this was precisely because the
      imperfection of our human science made them useless.
      We know in fact that Lowell and Schiaparelli saw on
      the face of Venus brilliant specks and a transient
      gleam which they themselves attributed either to
      volcanic eruptions or, as is more probable, to the
      attempts at communication of which I have spoken.
      "But science does not prevent us from asking ourselves
      whether, after the failure of these attempts, the
      inhabitants of Venus did not resort to another method
      of correspondence. How can we avoid thinking, for
      instance, of the X-rays, whose strictly rectilinear
      path would allow of the formation of pictures so clear
      that one could wish for nothing better? In fact it is
      not impossible that these rays are employed for the
      emission received on the Meudon screen, though the
      quality of the light when analyzed in the spectroscope
      makes the supposition highly improbable. But how are
      we to explain by means of X-rays <u>the taking of the
      terrestrial views</u> of which we saw the moving outline
      on the screen? We know, of course, if we go back to
      the concrete example to which I referred just now, we
      know that neither the brothers Montgolfier nor the
      surrounding landscape emitted X-rays. It is not
      therefore through the medium of these rays that the
      Venusians can have secured the instantaneous
      photographs which they afterwards transmitted to us.
      "Well, this exhausts all the possibilities of an
      explanation which can be referred to the present data
      of science. I declare positively that to-day, in this
      essay, I should not have dared to venture into the
      domain of theory and to suggest a solution in which my
      own labours are involved, if Noël Dorgeroux had not in
      a manner authorized me to do so. The fact is that,
      twelve months ago, I issued a pamphlet, entitled <u>An
      Essay on Universal Gravitation</u>, which fell flat on
      publication, but which must have attracted Noël
      Dorgeroux's particular attention, because his nephew,
      Victorien Beaugrand, found my name written among his
      papers and because Noël Dorgeroux cannot have known my
      name except through this pamphlet. Nor would he have
      taken the trouble to write it down, if the theory of
      the rays of gravitation which I developed in my
      pamphlet had not appeared to him to be exactly adapted
      to the problem raised by his discovery?
      "I will therefore ask the reader to refer to my
      pamphlet. He will there find the results, vague but by
      no means negligible, which I was able to explain by my
      experiments with this radiation. He will see that it
      is propagated in a strictly rectilinear direction and
      with a speed which is thrice that of light, so that it
      would not take more than 46 seconds to reach Venus at
      the time when she is nearest to the earth. He will see
      lastly that, though the existence of these rays,
      <u>thanks to which universal attraction is exercised
      according to the Newtonian laws</u>, is not yet admitted
      and though I have not yet succeeded in making them
      visible by means of suitable receivers, I nevertheless
      give proofs of their existence which must be taken
      into consideration. And Noël Dorgeroux's approval
      also is a proof that they must not be neglected.
      "On the other hand, we have the right to believe that,
      while our poor rudimentary science may, after
      centuries and centuries of efforts, have remained
      ignorant of the essential factor of the equilibrium of
      the planets, the Venusian scientists long since passed
      this inferior stage of knowledge and that they possess
      photographic receivers which allow films to be taken
      by means of the rays of gravitation and this by
      methods of truly wonderful perfection. They were
      therefore waiting. Looking down upon our planet,
      knowing all that happened here, witnessing our
      helplessness, they were waiting to communicate with us
      by the only means that appeared to them possible. They
      were waiting, patiently and persistently, formidably
      equipped, sweeping our soil with the invisible sheaves
      of rays assembled in their projectors and receivers,
      searching and prying into every nook and corner.
      "And one day the wonderful thing happened. One day the
      shaft of rays struck the layer of substance on the
      screen where and where alone the spontaneous work of
      chemical decomposition and immediate reconstitution
      could be performed. On that day, thanks to Noël
      Dorgeroux and thanks to luck, as we must confess, for
      Noël Dorgeroux was pursuing an entirely different
      series of experiments on that particular day, the
      Venusians established the connection between the two
      planets. The greatest fact in the history of the world
      was accomplished.
      "There is evidence even that the Venusians knew of
      Noël Dorgeroux's earlier experiments, that they
      realized their importance, that they interested
      themselves in his labours and that they followed the
      events of his life, for it is now many years since
      they took the pictures showing how his son Dominique
      was killed in the war. But I will not recapitulate in
      detail each of the films displayed at Meudon. This is
      a work which anybody can now perform in the light of
      the theory which I am setting forth. But we must
      consider attentively the process by which the
      Venusians tried to give those films a sort of
      uniformity. It has been rightly said that the sign of
      the Three Eyes is a trade-mark, like the mark of any
      of our great cinematograph-producers, a trade-mark
      also very strikingly proves the superhuman resources
      possessed by the Venusians, since they succeed in
      giving to those Three Eyes, which have no relation to
      our human eyes, not only the expression of our eyes
      but something much more impressive, the expression of
      the eyes of the person destined to be the principal
      character in the film.
      "But why was this particular mark chosen? Why eyes and
      why three? At the stage which we have now reached,
      need we answer this question? The Venusians themselves
      have furnished the reply by showing us that apparently
      absurd film in which Shapes assuredly lived and moved
      in our sight in accordance with the lines and
      principle of Venusian life. Were we not the breathless
      spectators of a picture taken among them and from
      them? Did we not behold, to make a companion picture
      to the death of Louis XVI, an incident representing
      the martyrdom of some great personage whom the
      executioners tore to pieces with their <u>three</u> hands,
      severing from his body a sort of shapeless head
      provided with <u>three</u> eyes?
      "Three Hands! Three Eyes! Dare I, on the strength of
      this fragile basis, go beyond what we saw and declare
      that the Venusian possesses the complete symmetry of
      the triangle, just as man, with his two eyes, his two
      ears and his two arms, possesses bilateral symmetry?
      Shall I try to explain his method of progressing by
      successive distentions and of moving vertically along
      <u>vertical</u> streets, in towns built <u>perpendicularly</u>?
      Shall I have the courage to state, as I believe, that
      he is provided with organs which give him a magnetic
      sense, a sense of space, an electric sense and so on,
      organs numbered by threes? No. These are details with
      which the Venusian scientists will supply us on the
      day when it pleases them to enter into correspondence
      with us.
      "And, believe me, they will not fail to do so. All
      their efforts for centuries past have been directed
      towards this object. 'Let us talk,' they will say to
      us soon as they must have said to Noël Dorgeroux and
      as they no doubt succeeded in doing with him. It must
      have been a stirring conversation, from which the
      great seer derived such power and certainty that it is
      to him that I will refer, before concluding, in order
      to add to the discussion the two positive proofs which
      he himself tried to write at the foot of the screen
      during the few seconds of his death-struggle, a
      twofold declaration made by the man, who in departing
      this life, <u>knew</u>:
      "'B-ray. . . . B E R G E . . .'
      "When thus expressing his supreme belief in the
      B-rays, Noël Dorgeroux no longer indicated that
      unknown radiation which he had once imagined to
      explain the phenomena of the screen and which would
      have consisted of the materialization of pictures born
      within and projected by ourselves. More far-seeing,
      better-informed as the result of his experiments,
      abandoning moreover his attempt to connect the new
      facts with the action of the solar heat which he had
      so often utilized, he plainly indicated those rays of
      gravitation of whose existence he had learnt through
      my pamphlet and also perhaps through his
      communications with the Venusians, those rays which
      are habitually employed by them in the same manner as
      that in which the light-rays are employed by the
      humblest photographer.
      "And the five letters B E R G E are not the first two
      syllables of the word Bergeronnette. That was the
      fatal error of which Bérangère Massignac was the
      victim. They form the word <u>Berger</u>, complete all but
      the last letter. At the moment of his death, in his
      already overshadowed brain, Noël Dorgeroux, in order
      to name Venus, could find no other expression than
      <u>l'Etoile du Berger</u>, the Shepherd's Star; and his
      enfeebled hand was able to write only the first few
      letters. The proof therefore is absolute. <u>The man who
      knew</u> had time to tell the essential part of what he
      knew: <u>by means of the rays of gravitation, the
      Shepherd's Star sends its living messages to the
      earth</u>.
      "If we accept the successive deductions stated in this
      preliminary essay, which I trust will one day prove to
      be in a manner a replica of the report stolen from
      Noël Dorgeroux, there still remain any number of
      points concerning which we possess not a single
      element of truth. What is the form of the recording-
      and projecting-apparatus employed by the Venusians? By
      what prodigious machinery do they obtain a perfect
      fixity in the projections between two stars each
      animated with such complicated movements in space (at
      present we know of seventeen in the earth alone)? And,
      to consider only what is close at hand, what is the
      nature of the screen employed for the Meudon
      projections? What is that dark-grey substance with
      which it is coated? How is that substance composed?
      How is it able to reconstruct the pictures? These are
      so many questions which our scientific attainments are
      incapable of solving. But at least we have no right to
      pronounce them insoluble; and I will go farther and
      declare that it is our duty to study them by all the
      means which the public authorities are bound to place
      at our disposal. This M. Massignac is said to have
      disappeared from sight. Let the opportunity be seized,
      let the Meudon Amphitheatre be declared national
      property! It is out of the question that an individual
      should, to the detriment of all mankind, remain the
      sole possessor of such tremendous secrets and have it
      in his power, if he please and in obedience to a mere
      whim, to destroy them for all time. The thing cannot
