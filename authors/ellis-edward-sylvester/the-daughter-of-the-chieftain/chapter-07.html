<p>At this moment Ben Ripley was about a hundred feet in advance
of the party and ascending a ridge in the woods, which were so
open that he was in plain sight of the others.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley, on hearing the alarming words of the little Delaware
girl, came to a stop. It seemed strange that Linna should have
caught the sounds noticed by no one else, and that, too, while
she was whispering to her companion, Alice; but even at that tender
age the inherited sharpness of hearing had been trained to a wonderfully
fine degree.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley was too prudent to argue with her. It was not wise
to take any chances. Above all, it was important that Ben should
know the truth, for he was still walking away from them with no
knowledge of their discovery.</p>

<p>"<em>S&mdash;</em>h!" The sibilant noise made by the mother's lips
crossed the space and the listening lad halted and looked round.
She did not speak, but beckoned him to come back. He obeyed at
once.</p>

<p>"Linna says she heard voices a minute ago, over yonder," whispered
Mrs. Ripley, as her son joined them.</p>

<p>"So me did," added Linna, in answer to the inquiring look of
the lad.</p>

<p>"You have sharp ears, little one; but are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Me am," was the confident reply.</p>

<p>"Where were they?"</p>

<p>She again pointed out the direction.</p>

<p>"That must be looked into: wait till I come back, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>S&mdash;</em>h!" interrupted the mother.</p>

<p>All caught an indistinct murmur, which proved Linna was right.</p>

<p>"Me tell you&mdash;eh?" she said in a proud undertone, her black eyes
sparkling with triumph.</p>

<p>"You are right: wait till I learn whether they are friends or
enemies. I will not be gone long."</p>

<p>Leaving the anxious group clustered together, Ben faced in the
direction of the sounds, which had stopped, and were so faint
when heard that he could not tell whether they belonged to friends
or foes.</p>

<p>As nearly as he could find out, the parties were just beyond
the crest of the ridge, and, but for the warning of Linna, he
would have run into the danger before knowing it.</p>

<p>With the utmost care he went up the slope. He leaned forward
and stepped more slowly, avoiding, so far as he could, making
any noise on the leaves or against the bushes and limbs which
he had to push aside to allow him to advance.</p>

<p>At the instant of reaching the highest point he heard the voices
again, so close that he knew they were made by white people, who
were in a clump of dense undergrowth. A faint wreath of smoke
filtering through the branches overhead showed they had started
a small fire, beside which they were probably sitting or reclining
on the ground.</p>

<p>Now that he was certain they belonged to his own race, he had
less fear. Still, they might prove unpleasant neighbors when they
came to know one of the party was a daughter of Omas. Turning
toward his friends, who were watching him, Ben made a sign for
them to stay where they were while he went forward.</p>

<p>He moved with the same care as before, but an unexpected accident
spoiled everything. His foot caught in a wire-like vine, and he
almost fell on his hands and knees. Aware that he had betrayed
himself, he threw aside further caution, hurried down the slope,
and called out in a guarded undertone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Helloa there, friends!"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" was the demand that instantly followed, and from
the undergrowth, beside a small fire, two men suddenly rose upright,
each with rifle in hand.</p>

<p>Ben recognized them. One was Jabez Zitner and the other Horace
Burwink&mdash;both middle aged, sturdy, and strong. They were neighbors,
and had taken part in the engagement the day before, but, escaping
without harm, were now on their way to the settlements of the
Upper Delaware.</p>

<p>A meeting of this kind would have been pleasing in the highest
degree, for it added great strength to the party; but a misgiving
came to the lad when he recognized Zitner. He was the man who,
when partially intoxicated the previous afternoon, had tried to
take Linna from him and was vigorously shoved aside by her friend.</p>

<p>"Helloa, Ben! where did you come from?" asked Zitner, who was
now entirely himself.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," added Burwink, and the two extended their
hands. "You gave us a great scare, for the woods are full of redskins."</p>

<p>"You startled me, too," replied Ben. "I am travelling with my
mother and sister to Stroudsburg. I suppose you are aiming for
the same place?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if we ever get there. What become of that little sarpent
you had with you yesterday?"</p>

<p>It was Zitner who asked the question. Ben's face flushed, for
he did not like to hear Linna spoken of in that way.</p>

<p>"She is with us," he quietly replied.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with her?"</p>

<p>"She is in our care, and goes wherever we go."</p>

<p>"You seem mighty fond of the people who played the mischief with
us yesterday."</p>

<p>"Jabez Zitner, I fought just as hard as you, and did all I could
to drive back the Iroquois and Tories, but I don't fight little
children six years old."</p>

<p>"Who's talking about fighting 'em?" demanded Zitner angrily.
"Their people didn't spare our women and children."</p>

<p>"They are savages, but you and I claim to be civilized."</p>

<p>"That's all well enough, but my motto is&mdash;fight fire with fire."
Burwink was listening to this sharp interchange of words, the
meaning of which he caught. Wishing to make a friend of him, for
Ben foresaw trouble, he asked&mdash;"Am I not right, Mr. Burwink?"</p>

<p>"I should say&mdash;on general principles you are; but, after yesterday,
I don't feel much love for any of the varmints. Who is this Injin
gal that you are talking about?"</p>

<p>Ben was too wise to give the name of Linna's father, knowing
he would be instantly recognized as one of the fiercest warriors
that had taken part in the invasion and battle. He therefore replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is a girl named Linna; she is of the same age as our Alice,
and was visiting her when we crossed the river to Forty Fort yesterday
morning. We could do nothing but take her with us, and I will
defend her with my life."</p>

<p>"You are talking big," remarked Zitner, with a scornful look
at the sturdy lad. "Who is the gal's father?"</p>

<p>"That makes no difference; but I will say he belongs to the Delaware
tribe, most of whom are friends to our people."</p>

<p>"There were plenty of them with the Senecas and Oneidas yesterday,
and they fought like wild cats, too. But why don't you bring your
folks forward?" added Zitner, looking inquiringly around.</p>

<p>"I will do so. Wait a few minutes."</p>

<p>He strode back and over the top of the ridge, until he caught
sight of the frightened group.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he called, beckoning to them. "Mr. Zitner and Burwink
are here, and want to see you."</p>

<p>With an expression of thankfulness, Mrs. Ripley, clasping a hand
of each of the children, walked up the slope, and passed over
to where the couple awaited their approach by the camp fire. She
shook hands with each, and expressed her pleasure at meeting them.
They did the same toward her, and then all, with the exception
of the children, seated themselves on the fallen tree beside which
the small fire was burning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley had observed the little incident the preceding afternoon,
when Zitner tried to stop Linna. She was ill at ease, for she
noticed how sharply he looked at the child. She hoped, however,
that now he was fully himself, he would be ashamed of his action,
or at least make no reference to it.</p>

<p>No fear of her doing so. She showed her tact by leading the conversation
in another direction.</p>

<p>"When did you leave Wyoming?"</p>

<p>"Burwink and I didn't get a chance to swim over until nearly
midnight, and then we had a rough time of it. There were plenty
of others that tried to do the same and never got to this side."</p>

<p>"When did you leave?" asked Burwink of the lady.</p>

<p>"We crossed before it was dark."</p>

<p>"How did you manage it? Swim?"</p>

<p>"No; we came over in a canoe. A Delaware Indian, the father of
Linna, swam behind the boat and pushed it across. But for him,
we never could have gotten away."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ripley, like her son, meant to keep the name of their friend
from these men. There was no danger of either her or Ben telling
it; but neither thought of another means they had of learning
it.</p>

<p>At this point, Alice went to her mother and leaned against her
knees, with her gaze on the faces of the men. She had been standing
beside Linna, whose eyes were never once removed from the displeasing
countenance of Zitner.</p>

<p>She must have noticed the incident referred to, for the expression
on her round face was of dislike and distrust. She stood further
off from the men than anyone else&mdash;silent, watchful, and suspicious.</p>

<p>Zitner now looked at her.</p>

<p>"Come here," he said coaxingly, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"No; me won't. Me don't like you," she replied, with an angry
flirt and backward step.</p>

<p>"Jingo!" exclaimed the surprised Zitner; "I didn't think she
could talk our lingo. Say, Miss Spitfire, what is your father's
name?"</p>

<p>Before either Mrs. Ripley or her son could interpose, Linna answered
defiantly&mdash;"He Omas&mdash;great warrior&mdash;kill good many white people&mdash;kill
you!"</p>

<p>The reply caused consternation on the part of Mrs. Ripley and
Ben, but the boy shut his lips tight. He could not but admire
the bravery of the child, and he was determined to stand by her
to the end.</p>

<p>The mother was in despair, but she relied mainly on persuasion
and prayer.</p>

<p>With no idea of what all this meant, Alice looked in the face
of each person in turn while speaking.</p>

<p>"She's a chip off the old block," said Burwink, with a laugh.
"She doesn't seem to have much fear of you, Jabez."</p>

<p>"I am hopeful she will feel different when she grows older,"
soothingly remarked Mrs. Ripley.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what you build your hope on," replied Zitner,
still curiously watching the child.</p>

<p>"I expect to have her a good deal under my care, and I shall
do all I can to instruct her aright. This morning she knelt with
us in prayer. You must remember she is very young, and has heard
little, if anything, of Christianity."</p>

<p>Zitner shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's born in 'em, and you can't get it out."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Zitner, you will not deny that we have a good many
Christian Indians. There are plenty of them at Gnadenhutten, and
the Moravian missionaries have been the means of turning hundreds
from darkness to light. If they can do that with full grown warriors
and women, may we not hope for the best from those of tender years?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," was the dogged reply. "I never believed
in this conversion business."</p>

<p>"What can you mean by such a remark?" asked the shocked lady.</p>

<p>"I mean, religion is good enough for white people, but don't
work with Injins. They will pretend they're good, but are only
waiting for a chance to do mischief."</p>

<p>"The converted Delawares have never taken part in the wars against
us. You know that as well as I."</p>

<p>"How about Omas?"</p>

<p>"He makes no pretence of Christianity."</p>

<p>"And therefore has no claim on our indulgence."</p>

<p>"No one has said he has," observed Ben, coming to his mother's
help; "he will never ask quarter from you or any white man."</p>

<p>"Where is he now? He brought you over the river, but seems to
have deserted you."</p>

<p>"He left because he didn't think we had further need of his aid;
we can get along without him."</p>

<p>"Now, see here," added Zitner, straightening up on the log and
slapping his knee; "I'll tell you what I've made up my mind to
do. I am willing to give in to Mrs. Ripley that far, that I won't
harm that youngster&mdash;that is, I will leave it to her father whether
I shall or shan't."</p>

<p>Neither mother nor son could understand the meaning of this strange
remark. They waited for the man to explain.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take her with us as a hostage. We're not clear
of the varmints yet. I believe Omas himself ain't far off, and
the rest will be on our heels all the way to Stroudsburg. If they
get us in a tight place, I'll let 'em know we've got the gal of
Omas with us, and if they harm a hair of our heads it'll be all
up with her. We'll take her clean to Stroudsburg, and then turn
her loose, for we won't have any further need of her; but she
must go with us."</p>

<p>"Jabez Zitner," said Ben Ripley&mdash;"the moment you lay your hand
on that child I will shoot you!"</p>
