<p>In Farmer Green's garden there were many things that Billy
Woodchuck liked to eat. It seemed to him that every time he stole
down there he found some new vegetable that was nicer than any he
had tasted before. And one day he came upon something that was far
sweeter and juicier than anything he had ever eaten.
</p>
<p>Farmer Green's peas were just ready to be picked. Billy Woodchuck
did not know what they were called. But that made no difference to
him. He sat up on his hind legs and pulled off the fat pods and ate
the tender green peas greedily.
</p><p>I should hate to say how long he stayed there. But it was a very
long time. When he reached the garden-patch it had been so early in
the morning that none of Farmer Green's family was astir. The sun
rose while Billy was breakfasting. And after a while a door slammed
now and then. But Billy Woodchuck never heard a sound, though the
farmhouse was not far away. He was having such a good meal that he
forgot everything else.
</p><p>At last he could eat no more. He hated to stop. But he could not
hold another mouthful. And now, as he looked around, he was
startled to see Farmer Green's hired man walking toward him. The
hired man had a hoe on his shoulder; and he was coming to work in
the garden.
</p><p>But Billy did not know that. He was sure that the man was after
<u>him</u>. So he dropped down on all fours and started to run. He
really did <u>try</u> to run. But to his surprise he could only drag
himself along the ground.
</p><p>The first thing that came into his head was the thought that he had
been poisoned. He had heard of such things happening. What else
could be the matter? His hind legs seemed too weak to hold up his
body. Yes! As he pulled himself slowly along, his fat stomach
actually dragged on the ground.
</p><p>Of course, he could not go fast at all. But he managed to reach a
shallow ditch, where he hid and rested for a time, though he
expected any moment that the hired man would pounce on him.
</p><p>But nothing of the sort happened; though he did hear the hired man
say:
</p><p>"Well, look at that! What <u>will</u> Mr. Green say when he knows this?"
</p><p>And that made Billy shiver all over. For he knew exactly what the
hired man meant.
</p><p>After a while he crept along the ditch. He wanted to get home to
his mother. And at last he reached the pasture, pulled himself
through the long tunnel, and fell in the middle of the chamber
floor and wept.
</p><p>"Oh, dear!" he cried. "I can't run any more. I'm afraid I can never
run again."
</p><p>Mrs. Woodchuck took one look at him.
</p><p>"What have you been eating?" she asked.
</p><p>"Some little green balls," Billy answered.
</p><p>"Where have you been eating them?" she inquired. To tell the truth,
she was the least bit worried.
</p><p>"It was down in Farmer Green's garden," he told her.
</p><p>"Ah, ha!" said Mrs. Woodchuck. "Green peas!" she said. "Your
father told me this very morning that they were ripe. You ate too
many of them."
</p><p>"Will I get better?" Billy asked her.
</p><p>"Yes, indeed!" she replied. "But it's lucky no man came and found
you like that. I don't believe you could ever have got away."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck said nothing more just then. But in a little while
he asked his mother another question:
</p><p>"Is it because they are in Farmer Green's garden that you call them
<u>green</u> peas, Mother?"
