<p>When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo
Station quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it
may make you think that their parents were neither kind nor
careful.  But if you think this you will be wrong.  The fact is,
mother arranged with Aunt Emma that she was to meet the children at
Waterloo, when they went back from their Christmas holiday at
Lyndhurst.  The train was fixed, but not the day.  Then mother
wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructions about the day
and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, and gave the
letter to Robert to post.  But the hounds happened to meet near
Rufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet
they met Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all
about posting Aunt Emma's letter, and never thought of it again
until he and the others had wandered three times up and down the
platform at Waterloo - which makes six in all - and had bumped
against old gentlemen, and stared in the faces of ladies, and been
shoved by people in a hurry, and 'by-your-leaved' by porters with
trucks, and were quite, quite sure that Aunt Emma was not there.
Then suddenly the true truth of what he had forgotten to do came
home to Robert, and he said, 'Oh, crikey!' and stood still with his
mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag in each hand and
a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily into him, and
never so much as said, 'Where are you shoving to now?' or, 'Look
out where you're going, can't you?'  The heavier bag smote him at
the knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>When the others understood what was the matter I think they told
Robert what they thought of him.</p>

<p>'We must take the train to Croydon,' said Anthea, 'and find Aunt
Emma.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Cyril, 'and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to
see us and our traps.'</p>

<p>Aunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses - very prim
people.  They were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and
they were fond of matinees and shopping, and they did not care
about children.</p>

<p>'I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,' said
Jane.</p>

<p>'Yes, she would, but she'd think it was not right to show she was
pleased, because it's Bob's fault we're not met.  Don't I know the
sort of thing?' said Cyril.  'Besides, we've no tin.  No; we've got
enough for a growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the
New Forest.  We must just go home.  They won't be so savage when
they find we've really got home all right.  You know auntie was
only going to take us home in a cab.'</p>

<p>'I believe we ought to go to Croydon,' Anthea insisted.</p>

<p>'Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,' said Robert.  'Those
Jevonses go to the theatre every afternoon, I believe.  Besides,
there's the Phoenix at home, AND the carpet.  I votes we call a
four-wheeled cabman.'</p>

<p>A four-wheeled cabman was called - his cab was one of the
old-fashioned kind with straw in the bottom - and he was asked by
Anthea to drive them very carefully to their address.  This he did,
and the price he asked for doing so was exactly the value of the
gold coin grandpapa had given Cyril for Christmas.  This cast a
gloom; but Cyril would never have stooped to argue about a cab-
fare, for fear the cabman should think he was not accustomed to
take cabs whenever he wanted them.  For a reason that was something
like this he told the cabman to put the luggage on the steps, and
waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily retired before
he rang the bell.</p>

<p>'You see,' he said, with his hand on the handle, 'we don't want
cook and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we've come home
alone, as if we were babies.'</p>

<p>Here he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was
heard, every one felt that it would be some time before that bell
was answered.  The sound of a bell is quite different, somehow,
when there is anyone inside the house who hears it.  I can't tell
you why that is - but so it is.</p>

<p>'I expect they're changing their dresses,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Too late,' said Anthea, 'it must be past five.  I expect Eliza's
gone to post a letter, and cook's gone to see the time.'</p>

<p>Cyril rang again.  And the bell did its best to inform the
listening children that there was really no one human in the house.
They rang again and listened intently.  The hearts of all sank low.
It is a terrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a
dark, muggy January evening.</p>

<p>'There is no gas on anywhere,' said Jane, in a broken voice.</p>

<p>'I expect they've left the gas on once too often, and the draught
blew it out, and they're suffocated in their beds.  Father always
said they would some day,' said Robert cheerfully.</p>

<p>'Let's go and fetch a policeman,' said Anthea, trembling.</p>

<p>'And be taken up for trying to be burglars - no, thank you,' said
Cyril.  'I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who
got into his own mother's house, and they got him made a burglar
only the other day.'</p>

<p>'I only hope the gas hasn't hurt the Phoenix,' said Anthea.  'It
said it wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it
would be all right, because the servants never clean that out.  But
if it's gone and got out and been choked by gas - And besides,
directly we open the door we shall be choked, too.  I KNEW we ought
to have gone to Aunt Emma, at Croydon.  Oh, Squirrel, I wish we
had.  Let's go NOW.'</p>

<p>'Shut up,' said her brother, briefly.  'There's some one rattling
the latch inside.'  Every one listened with all its ears, and every
one stood back as far from the door as the steps would allow.</p>

<p>The latch rattled, and clicked.  Then the flap of the letter-box
lifted itself - every one saw it by the flickering light of the
gas-lamp that shone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate - a
golden eye seemed to wink at them through the letter-slit, and a
cautious beak whispered - </p>

<p>'Are you alone?'</p>

<p>'It's the Phoenix,' said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so
full of relief, as to be a sort of whispered shout.</p>

<p>'Hush!' said the voice from the letter-box slit.  'Your slaves have
gone a-merry-making.  The latch of this portal is too stiff for my
beak.  But at the side - the little window above the shelf whereon
your bread lies - it is not fastened.'</p>

<p>'Righto!' said Cyril.</p>

<p>And Anthea added, 'I wish you'd meet us there, dear Phoenix.'</p>

<p>The children crept round to the pantry window.  It is at the side
of the house, and there is a green gate labelled 'Tradesmen's
Entrance', which is always kept bolted.  But if you get one foot on
the fence between you and next door, and one on the handle of the
gate, you are over before you know where you are.  This, at least,
was the experience of Cyril and Robert, and even, if the truth must
be told, of Anthea and Jane.  So in almost no time all four were in
the narrow gravelled passage that runs between that house and the
next.</p>

<p>Then Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his
knicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill.  He dived into
the pantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved
in the air as he went, just as your legs do when you are first
beginning to learn to dive.  The soles of his boots - squarish muddy
patches - disappeared.</p>

<p>'Give me a leg up,' said Robert to his sisters.</p>

<p>'No, you don't,' said Jane firmly.  'I'm not going to be left
outside here with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind
us out of the dark.  Squirrel can go and open the back door.'</p>

<p>A light had sprung awake in the pantry.  Cyril always said the
Phoenix turned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft
of its wing; but he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really
did it himself with matches, and then forgot all about it.  He let
the others in by the back door.  And when it had been bolted again
the children went all over the house and lighted every single
gas-jet they could find.  For they couldn't help feeling that this
was just the dark dreary winter's evening when an armed burglar
might easily be expected to appear at any moment.  There is nothing
like light when you are afraid of burglars - or of anything else,
for that matter.</p>

<p>And when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the
Phoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really
out, and that there was no one in the house except the four
children, and the Phoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who
lived in the cupboards on each side of the nursery fire-place. 
These last were very pleased that the children had come home again,
especially when Anthea had lighted the nursery fire.  But, as
usual, the children treated the loving little blackbeetles with
coldness and disdain.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you know how to light a fire?  I don't mean how to
strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire
someone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by
yourself.  I will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have
to light one yourself you may remember how it is done.  First, she
raked out the ashes of the fire that had burned there a week
ago - for Eliza had actually never done this, though she had had
plenty of time.  In doing this Anthea knocked her knuckle and made
it bleed.  Then she laid the largest and handsomest cinders in the
bottom of the grate.  Then she took a sheet of old newspaper (you
ought never to light a fire with to-day's newspaper - it will not
burn well, and there are other reasons against it), and tore it
into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a loose ball,
and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood and
broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends
rested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper
balls.  In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string,
and when she broke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on
the cheek.  Then she put more cinders and some bits of coal - no
dust.  She put most of that on her hands, but there seemed to be
enough left for her face.  Then she lighted the edges of the paper
balls, and waited till she heard the fizz-crack-crack-fizz of the
wood as it began to burn.  Then she went and washed her hands and
face under the tap in the back kitchen.</p>

<p>Of course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or
bruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but
otherwise, this is a very good way to light a fire in London.  In
the real country fires are lighted in a different and prettier way.</p>

<p>But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards,
wherever you are.</p>

<p>While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the
cheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for - I was going to say tea,
but the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea.  Let us
call it a tea-ish meal.  There was tea, certainly, for Anthea's
fire blazed and crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be
affectionately inviting the kettle to come and sit upon its lap. 
So the kettle was brought and tea made.  But no milk could be
found - so every one had six lumps of sugar to each cup instead. 
The things to eat, on the other hand, were nicer than usual.  The
boys looked about very carefully, and found in the pantry some cold
tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold pudding - very
much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home.  And in the
kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry
jam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly
slabs of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron.</p>

<p>It was indeed, as Jane said, 'a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.'</p>

<p>The Phoenix perched on Robert's chair, and listened kindly and
politely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst,
and underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far,
the faithful carpet could be felt by all - even by Jane, whose legs
were very short.</p>

<p>'Your slaves will not return to-night,' said the Phoenix.  'They
sleep under the roof of the cook's stepmother's aunt, who is, I
gather, hostess to a large party to-night in honour of her
husband's cousin's sister-in-law's mother's ninetieth birthday.'</p>

<p>'I don't think they ought to have gone without leave,' said Anthea,
'however many relations they have, or however old they are; but I
suppose we ought to wash up.'</p>

<p>'It's not our business about the leave,' said Cyril, firmly, 'but
I simply won't wash up for them.  We got it, and we'll clear it
away; and then we'll go somewhere on the carpet.  It's not often we
get a chance of being out all night.  We can go right away to the
other side of the equator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise
over the great Pacific Ocean.'</p>

<p>'Right you are,' said Robert.  'I always did want to see the
Southern Cross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.'</p>

<p>'DON'T go,' said Anthea, very earnestly, 'because I COULDN'T.  I'm
SURE mother wouldn't like us to leave the house and I should hate
to be left here alone.'</p>

<p>'I'd stay with you,' said Jane loyally.</p>

<p>'I know you would,' said Anthea gratefully, 'but even with you I'd
much rather not.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, 'I don't want
you to do anything you think's wrong, BUT - '</p>

<p>He was silent; this silence said many things.</p>

<p>'I don't see,' Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted - </p>

<p>'I'm quite sure.  Sometimes you just think a thing's wrong, and
sometimes you KNOW.  And this is a KNOW time.'</p>

<p>The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly
beak to say - </p>

<p>'When it is, as you say, a &quot;know time&quot;, there is no more to be
said.  And your noble brothers would never leave you.'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' said Cyril rather quickly.  And Robert said so
too.</p>

<p>'I myself,' the Phoenix went on, 'am willing to help in any way
possible.  I will go personally - either by carpet or on the
wing - and fetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during
the evening.  In order to waste no time I could go while you wash
up. - Why,' it went on in a musing voice, 'does one wash up teacups
and wash down the stairs?'</p>

<p>'You couldn't wash stairs up, you know,' said Anthea, 'unless you
began at the bottom and went up feet first as you washed.  I wish
cook would try that way for a change.'</p>

<p>'I don't,' said Cyril, briefly.  'I should hate the look of her
elastic-side boots sticking up.'</p>

<p>'This is mere trifling,' said the Phoenix.  'Come, decide what I
shall fetch for you.  I can get you anything you like.'</p>

<p>But of course they couldn't decide.  Many things were suggested - a
rocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a
motor-car, books with pictures, musical instruments, and many other
things.  But a musical instrument is agreeable only to the player,
unless he has learned to play it really well; books are not
sociable, bicycles cannot be ridden without going out of doors, and
the same is true of motor-cars and elephants.  Only two people can
play chess at once with one set of chessmen (and anyway it's very
much too much like lessons for a game), and only one can ride on a
rocking-horse.  Suddenly, in the midst of the discussion, the
Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, and from there
it spoke.</p>

<p>'I gather,' it said, 'from the carpet, that it wants you to let it
go to its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will
return within the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful
and delightful products of its native land.'</p>

<p>'What IS its native land?'</p>

<p>'I didn't gather.  But since you can't agree, and time is passing,
and the tea-things are not washed down - I mean washed up - '</p>

<p>'I votes we do,' said Robert.  'It'll stop all this jaw, anyway. 
And it's not bad to have surprises.  Perhaps it's a Turkey carpet,
and it might bring us Turkish delight.'</p>

<p>'Or a Turkish patrol,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'Or a Turkish bath,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'Or a Turkish towel,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Nonsense,' Robert urged, 'it said beautiful and delightful, and
towels and baths aren't THAT, however good they may be for you. 
Let it go.  I suppose it won't give us the slip,' he added, pushing
back his chair and standing up.</p>

<p>'Hush!' said the Phoenix; 'how can you?  Don't trample on its
feelings just because it's only a carpet.'</p>

<p>'But how can it do it - unless one of us is on it to do the
wishing?' asked Robert.  He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT
be necessary for one to go and why not Robert?  But the Phoenix
quickly threw cold water on his new-born dream.</p>

<p>'Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the
carpet.'</p>

<p>So a leaf was torn from Anthea's arithmetic book, and on it Cyril
wrote in large round-hand the following:</p>

<p>We wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the most
beautiful and delightful productions of it you can - and not to be
gone long, please.
                    (Signed)  CYRIL.
                              ROBERT.
                              ANTHEA.
                              JANE.</p>

<p>Then the paper was laid on the carpet.</p>

<p>'Writing down, please,' said the Phoenix; 'the carpet can't read a
paper whose back is turned to it, any more than you can.'</p>

<p>It was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, the
carpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water
on a hearth under a fierce fire.  The edges got smaller and
smaller, and then it disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>'It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful
things,' said the Phoenix.  'I should wash up - I mean wash down.'</p>

<p>So they did.  There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and
every one helped - even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their
handles with its clever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and
then stood them on the table ready for Anthea to dry them.  But the
bird was rather slow, because, as it said, though it was not above
any sort of honest work, messing about with dish-water was not
exactly what it had been brought up to.  Everything was nicely
washed up, and dried, and put in its proper place, and the
dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper to dry, and
the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the scullery. 
(If you are a duchess's child, or a king's, or a person of high
social position's child, you will perhaps not know the difference
between a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse
has been better instructed than you, and she will tell you all
about it.) And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being
dried on the roller-towel behind the scullery door there came a
strange sound from the other side of the kitchen wall - the side
where the nursery was.  It was a very strange sound, indeed - most
odd, and unlike any other sounds the children had ever heard.  At
least, they had heard sounds as much like it as a toy engine's
whistle is like a steam siren's.</p>

<p>'The carpet's come back,' said Robert; and the others felt that he
was right.</p>

<p>'But what has it brought with it?' asked Jane.  'It sounds like
Leviathan, that great beast.'</p>

<p>'It couldn't have been made in India, and have brought elephants?
Even baby ones would be rather awful in that room,' said Cyril.  'I
vote we take it in turns to squint through the keyhole.'</p>

<p>They did - in the order of their ages.  The Phoenix, being the
eldest by some thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. 
But - </p>

<p>'Excuse me,' it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing
softly; 'looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my
golden eyes.'</p>

<p>So Cyril looked.</p>

<p>'I see something grey moving,' said he.</p>

<p>'It's a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,' said Robert, when
he had taken his turn.  And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling,
scuffling, shuffling, fluffling noise went on inside.</p>

<p>'<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> can't see anything,' said Anthea, 'my eye tickles so.'</p>

<p>Then Jane's turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole.</p>

<p>'It's a giant kitty-cat,' she said; 'and it's asleep all over the
floor.'</p>

<p>'Giant cats are tigers - father said so.'</p>

<p>'No, he didn't.  He said tigers were giant cats.  It's not at all
the same thing.'</p>

<p>'It's no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you if
you're afraid to look at them when they come,' said the Phoenix,
sensibly.  And Cyril, being the eldest, said - </p>

<p>'Come on,' and turned the handle.</p>

<p>The gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the room
could be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door.  At least, not
everything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible,
because it was completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine
beautiful objects which it had brought from its birthplace.</p>

<p>'My hat!' Cyril remarked.  'I never thought about its being a
PERSIAN carpet.'</p>

<p>Yet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects
which it had brought back were cats - Persian cats, grey Persian
cats, and there were, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were
sitting on the carpet as close as they could get to each other. 
But the moment the children entered the room the cats rose and
stretched, and spread and overflowed from the carpet to the floor,
and in an instant the floor was a sea of moving, mewing
pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed to the table,
and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knocked on the
wall - and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian and
piercing.</p>

<p>'This is pretty poor sport,' said Cyril.  'What's the matter with
the bounders?'</p>

<p>'I imagine that they are hungry,' said the Phoenix.  'If you were
to feed them - '</p>

<p>'We haven't anything to feed them with,' said Anthea in despair,
and she stroked the nearest Persian back.  'Oh, pussies, do be
quiet - we can't hear ourselves think.'</p>

<p>She had to shout this entreaty, for the mews were growing
deafening, 'and it would take pounds' and pounds' worth of
cat's-meat.'</p>

<p>'Let's ask the carpet to take them away,' said Robert.  But the
girls said 'No.'</p>

<p>'They are so soft and pussy,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'And valuable,' said Anthea, hastily.  'We can sell them for lots
and lots of money.'</p>

<p>'Why not send the carpet to get food for them?' suggested the
Phoenix, and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the
effort it had to be make to be heard above the increasing
fierceness of the Persian mews.</p>

<p>So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian
cats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before.</p>

<p>The carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped
off it, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. 
And the carpet disappeared.</p>

<p>Unless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian
cats in one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in
unmistakable mews, you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now
deafened the children and the Phoenix.  The cats did not seem to have
been at all properly brought up.  They seemed to have no idea of its
being a mistake in manners to ask for meals in a strange house - let
alone to howl for them - and they mewed, and they mewed, and they
mewed, and they mewed, till the children poked their fingers into their
ears and waited in silent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden
Town did not come knocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and
only hoping that the food for the cats would come before the neighbours
did - and before all the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to
be given away beyond recall to an indignant neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out
and unfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix
huddled together on the table.</p>

<p>The Phoenix, Robert noticed suddenly, was trembling.</p>

<p>'So many cats,' it said, 'and they might not know I was the
Phoenix.  These accidents happen so quickly.  It quite un-mans me.'</p>

<p>This was a danger of which the children had not thought.</p>

<p>'Creep in,' cried Robert, opening his jacket.</p>

<p>And the Phoenix crept in - only just in time, for green eyes had
glared, pink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as
Robert buttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of
eager grey Persian fur.  And on the instant the good carpet slapped
itself down on the floor.  And it was covered with rats - three hundred
and ninety-eight of them, I believe, two for each cat.</p>

<p>'How horrible!' cried Anthea.  'Oh, take them away!'</p>

<p>'Take yourself away,' said the Phoenix, 'and me.'</p>

<p>'I wish we'd never had a carpet,' said Anthea, in tears.</p>

<p>They hustled and crowded out of the door, and shut it, and locked
it.  Cyril, with great presence of mind, lit a candle and turned
off the gas at the main.</p>

<p>'The rats'll have a better chance in the dark,' he said.</p>

<p>The mewing had ceased.  Every one listened in breathless silence. 
We all know that cats eat rats - it is one of the first things we
read in our little brown reading books; but all those cats eating
all those rats - it wouldn't bear thinking of.</p>

<p>Suddenly Robert sniffed, in the silence of the dark kitchen, where
the only candle was burning all on one side, because of the
draught.</p>

<p>'What a funny scent!' he said.</p>

<p>And as he spoke, a lantern flashed its light through the window of
the kitchen, a face peered in, and a voice said - </p>

<p>'What's all this row about?  You let me in.'</p>

<p>It was the voice of the police!</p>

<p>Robert tip-toed to the window, and spoke through the pane that had
been a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a
walking-stick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose.  (It
was after they had been to a circus.)</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' he said.  'There's no row.  You listen;
everything's as quiet as quiet.'  And indeed it was.</p>

<p>The strange sweet scent grew stronger, and the Phoenix put out its
beak.</p>

<p>The policeman hesitated.</p>

<p>'They're MUSK-rats,' said the Phoenix.  'I suppose some cats eat
them - but never Persian ones.  What a mistake for a well-informed
carpet to make!  Oh, what a night we're having!'</p>

<p>'Do go away,' said Robert, nervously.  'We're
just going to bed - that's our bedroom candle; there isn't any row. 
Everything's as quiet as a mouse.'</p>

<p>A wild chorus of mews drowned his words, and with the mews were
mingled the shrieks of the musk-rats.  What had happened?  Had the
cats tasted them before deciding that they disliked the flavour?</p>

<p>'I'm a-coming in,' said the policeman.  'You've got a cat shut up
there.'</p>

<p>'A cat,' said Cyril.  'Oh, my only aunt!  A cat!'</p>

<p>'Come in, then,' said Robert.  'It's your own look out.  I advise
you not.  Wait a shake, and I'll undo the side gate.'</p>

<p>He undid the side gate, and the policeman, very cautiously, came
in.  And there in the kitchen, by the light of one candle, with the
