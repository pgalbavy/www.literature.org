<p>There are two things, according to the saying, which cannot be
recalled--the sped arrow and the spoken word. Whether spoken in anger
or in jest our winged thoughts will not come back to us and, where
there is no balm for the wound we have caused, there is nothing to do
but let it heal.
</p><p>Bud Hooker was a man of few words, and slow to speak ill of any one,
but some unfamiliar devil had loosened his tongue and he had told the
worst about Phil. Certainly if a man were the bravest of the brave,
certainly if he loved his girl more than life itself--he would not be
content to hide above the line and pour out his soul on note-paper. But
to tell it to the girl--that was an unpardonable sin!
</p><p>Still, now that the damage was done, there was no use of vain repining,
and after cursing himself whole-heartedly Bud turned in for the night.
Other days were coming; there were favors he might do; and perhaps,
as the yesterdays went by, Gracia would forgive him for his plain
speaking. Even to-morrow, if the rebels came back for more, he might
square himself in action and prove that he was not a coward. A coward!
</p><p>It had been a long time since any one had used that word to him, but
after the way he had knifed "dear Phil" he had to admit he was it. But
"dear Phil"! It was that which had set him off.
</p><p>If she knew how many other girls--but Bud put a sudden quietus on that
particular line of thought. As long as the world stood and Gracia was
in his sight he swore never to speak ill of De Lancey again, and then
he went to sleep.
</p><p>The men who guarded the <u>casa grande</u> slept uneasily on the porch,
lying down like dogs on empty sugar-sacks that the women might not
lack bedding inside. Even at that they were better off, for the house
was close and feverish, with the crying of babies and the babbling of
dreamers, and mothers moving to and fro.
</p><p>It was a hectic night, but Bud slept it out, and at dawn, after the
custom of his kind, he arose and stamped on his boots. The moist
coolness of the morning brought the odor of wet greasewood and tropic
blossoms to his nostrils as he stepped out to speak with the guards,
and as he stood there waiting for the full daylight the master mechanic
joined him.
</p><p>He was a full-bodied, round-headed little man with determined views
on life, and he began the day, as usual, with his private opinion of
Mexicans. They were the same uncomplimentary remarks to which he had
given voice on the day before, for the rebels had captured one of his
engines and he knew it would come to some harm.
</p><p>"A fine bunch of <u>hombres</u>, yes," he ended, "and may the devil fly
away with them! They took No. 9 at the summit yesterday and I've been
listening ever since. Her pans are all burned out and we've been
feeding her bran like a cow to keep her from leaking steam. If some
ignorant Mex gets hold of her you'll hear a big noise--and that'll be
the last of No. 9--her boiler will burst like a wet bag.
</p><p>"If I was running this road there'd be no more bran--not since what I
saw over at Aguas Calientes on the Central. One of those bum, renegade
engine-drivers had burned out No. 743, but the rebels had ditched four
of our best and we had to send her out. Day after day the boys had been
feeding her bran until she smelled like a distillery. The mash was
oozing out of her as Ben Tyrrell pulled up to the station, and a friend
of his that had come down from the north took one sniff and swung up
into the cab.
</p><p>"Ben came down at the word he whispered--for they'd two of 'em blowed
up in the north--and they sent out another man. Hadn't got up the
hill when the engine exploded and blew the poor devil to hell! I
asked Tyrrell what his friend had told him, but he kept it to himself
until he could get his time. It's the fumes, boy--they blow up like
brandy--and old No. 9 is sour!
</p><p>"She'll likely blow up, too. But how can we fix her with these ignorant
Mexican mechanics? You should have been over at Aguas the day they
fired the Americans.
</p><p>"'No more <u>Americanos</u>!' says Madero. 'Let 'em all out and hire
Mexicans! The national railroads of Mexico must not be in the hands of
foreigners.'
</p><p>"So they fired us all in a day and put a Mexican wood-passer up in the
cab of old No. 313. He started to pull a string of empties down the
track, threw on the air by mistake, and stopped her on a dead-center.
Pulled out the throttle and she wouldn't go, so he gave it up and quit.
</p><p>"Called in the master mechanic then--a Mexican. He tinkered with her
for an hour, right there on the track, until she went dead on their
hands. Then they ran down a switch-engine and took back the cars and
called on the roadmaster--a Mex. He cracked the nut--built a shoo-fly
around No. 313 and they left her right there on the main track. Two
days later an American hobo came by and he set down and laughed at 'em.
Then he throws off the brakes, gives No. 313 a boost past the center
with a crowbar, and runs her to the roundhouse by gravity. When we left
Aguas on a hand-car that hobo was running the road.
</p><p>"Ignorantest <u>hombres</u> in the world--these Mexicans. Shooting a gun or
running an engine, it's all the same--they've got nothing above the
eyebrows."
</p><p>"That's right," agreed Bud, who had been craning his neck; "but what's
that noise up the track?"
</p><p>The master mechanic listened, and when his ears, dulled by the clangor
of the shops, caught the distant roar he turned and ran for the house.
</p><p>"Git up, Ed!" he called to the roadmaster. "They're sending a wild car
down the cañon--and she may be loaded with dynamite!"
</p><p>"Dynamite or not," mumbled the grizzled roadmaster, as he roused up
from his couch, "there's a derailer I put in up at kilometer seventy
the first thing yesterday morning. That'll send her into the ditch!"
</p><p>Nevertheless he listened intently, cocking his head to guess by the
sound when it came to kilometer seventy.
</p><p>"Now she strikes it!" he announced, as the rumble turned into a roar;
but the roar grew louder, there was a clash as the trucks struck a
curve, and then a great metal ore-car swung round the point, rode up
high as it hit the reverse and, speeding by as if shot from a catapult,
swept through the yard, smashed into a freight-car, and leaped, car and
all, into the creek.
</p><p>"They've sneaked my derailer!" said the roadmaster, starting on a run
for the shops. "Who'll go with me to put in another one? Or we'll
loosen a rail on the curve--that'll call for no more than a claw-bar
and a wrench!"
</p><p>"I'll go!" volunteered Bud and the man who stood guard, and as startled
sleepers roused up on every side and ran toward the scene of the wreck
they dashed down the hill together and threw a hand-car on the track.
</p><p>Then, with what tools they could get together, and a spare derailer on
the front, they pumped madly up the cañon, holding their breaths at
every curve for fear of what they might see. If there was one runaway
car there was another, for the rebels were beginning an attack.
</p><p>Already on the ridges above them they could hear the crack of rifles,
and a jet or two of dust made it evident that they were the mark. But
with three strong men at the handles they made the hand-car jump. The
low hills fled behind them. They rounded a point and the open track lay
before them, with something--
</p><p>"Jump!" shouted the roadmaster, and as they tumbled down the bank
they heard a crash behind them and their hand-car was knocked into
kindling-wood.
</p><p>"Now up to the track!" the roadmaster panted, as the destroyer swept on
down the line. "Find some tools--we'll take out a rail!"
</p><p>With frantic eagerness he toiled up the fill and attacked a fish-plate,
and Bud and the young guard searched the hillside for tools to help
with the work. They fell to with sledge and claw-bar, tapping off nuts,
jerking out spikes, and heaving to loosen the rail--and then once more
that swift-moving something loomed up suddenly on the track.
</p><p>"Up the hill!" commanded the roadmaster, and as they scrambled into a
gulch a wild locomotive, belching smoke and steam like a fire-engine,
went rushing past them, struck the loose rail, and leaped into the
creek-bed. A moment later, as it crashed its way down to the water,
there was an explosion that shook the hills. They crouched behind the
cut bank, and the trees above them bowed suddenly to the slash of an
iron hail.
</p><p>"Dynamite!" cried the roadmaster, grinning triumphantly as he looked up
after the shock; and when the fall of fragments had ceased, and they
had fled as if by instinct from the place, they struck hands on their
narrow escape. But back at the big house, with everybody giving thanks
for their delivery from the powder-train, the master mechanic raised a
single voice of protest.
</p><p>"'Twas not dynamite!" he yelled. "Powder-train be damned! It was No. 9!
She was sour as a distillery! She blowed up, I tell ye--she blowed up
when she hit the creek!"
</p><p>And even after a shower of bullets from the ridge had driven them all
to cover he still rushed to those who would listen and clamored that it
was the bran.
</p><p>But there was scant time to hold a post-mortem on No. 9, for on the
summit of a near-by ridge, and overlooking the black tank, the rebels
had thrown up a wall in the night, and from the security of this
shelter they were industriously shooting up the town.
</p><p>The smash of the first wild car had been their signal for attack, and
as the explosion threw the defenders into confusion they made a rush to
take the tank. Here, as on the day before, was stationed the Federal
garrison, a scant twenty or thirty men in charge of a boy lieutenant.
</p><p>Being practically out of ammunition, he did not stand on the order of
his going, but as his <u>pelónes</u> pelted past the superintendent's house
the reorganized miners, their belts stuffed with cartridges from their
own private stock, came charging up from the town and rallied them in
the rear.
</p><p>In a solid, shouting mass they swept up the hill together, dropped
down behind the defenses, and checked the astounded rebels with a
volley. Then there was another long-range battle, with every sign of
war but the dead, until at last, as the firing slackened from lack of
cartridges, a white flag showed on the ridge above, and the leaders
went out for a parley.
</p><p>Properly speaking, Del Rey was in command of the town, but neither
the Federals nor the miners would recognize his authority and the
leadership went by default. While they waited to hear the rebel demands
the Americans took advantage of the truce to bring up hot food from the
hotel, where Don Juan de Dios stood heroically at his post. Let bullets
come and go, Don Juan kept his cooks about him, and to those who had
doubted his valor his coffee was answer enough.
</p><p>"W'y, my gracious, Mr. Hooker!" he railed, as Bud refreshed himself
between trips, "ain't you going to take any up to those women? Don't
drink so much coffee now, but give it to the men who fight!"
</p><p>"Ump-um," grunted Bud with a grin; "they got a skinful of <u>mescal</u>
already! What they need is another car-load of ammunition to help 'em
shoot their first rebel."
</p><p>"I thought you said they wouldn't fight!" twitted Don Juan. "This is
the battle of Fortuna that I was telling you about last week."
</p><p>"Sure!" answered Bud. "And over there is the dead!"
</p><p>He pointed to a riot of <u>mescal</u> bottles that marked the scene of the
night's potations, and Don Juan gave him up as hopeless.
</p><p>But, jest as he would, Bud saw that the situation was serious, for the
foolhardy Sonorans had already emptied their cartridge-belts, and their
guns were no better than clubs. Unless the rebels had been equally
reckless with their ammunition they had the town at their mercy, and
the first thing that they would demand would be the refugees in the big
house.
</p><p>The possession of the town; the arms of the defenders; food, clothing,
and horses to ride--none of these would satisfy them. They would demand
the rich Spanish landowners to be held for ransom, the women first of
all. And of all those women huddled up in the <u>casa grande</u> not one
would bring a bigger ransom than Gracia Aragon.
</p><p>Bud pondered the outcome as the emissaries wrangled on the hillside,
and then he went back to the corral to make sure that his horse was
safe. Copper Bottom, too, might be held for ransom. But, knowing the
rebels as he did, Hooker foresaw a different fate, and rather than see
him become the mount of some rebel chieftain he had determined, if the
town surrendered, to make a dash.
</p><p>Riding by night and hiding in the hills by day, he could get to the
border in two days. All he needed was a little jerked beef for the trip
and he would be ready for anything.
</p><p>So he hurried down to the hotel again and was just making a sack of
food fast to his saddle when he heard a noise behind him and turned to
face Aragon. For two days the once-haughty Don Cipriano had slunk about
like a sick cat, but now he was headed for Gracia's big roan, and the
look in his eyes betrayed his purpose.
</p><p>"Where you going?" demanded Hooker in English, and at the gruff
challenge the Spaniard stopped in his tracks. The old, hunted look came
back into his eyes, he seemed to shrink before the stern gaze of the
Texan, and, as the memory of his past misdeeds came over him, he turned
as if to flee.
</p><p>But there was a smile, an amused and tolerant smirk, about the
American's mouth, and even for that look of understanding the harried
<u>haciendado</u> seemed to thank him. He was broken now, thrown down from
his pedestal of arrogance and conceit, and as Hooker did not offer to
shoot him at sight he turned back to him like a lost dog that seeks but
a kind word.
</p><p>"Ah, <u>señor</u>," he whined, "your pardon! What?" as he sighted the sack
of meat. "You are going, too? Ah, my friend"--his eyes lighted up
suddenly at the thought--"let me ride with you! I will pay you--yes,
anything--but if Bernardo Bravo takes me he will hang me! He has sworn
it!"
</p><p>"Well, you got it coming to you!" answered Hooker heartlessly.
</p><p>"But I will pay you well!" pleaded Aragon. "I will pay you--" He paused
as if to consider what would tempt him and then suddenly he raised his
head.
</p><p>"What is it you wish above everything?" he questioned eagerly. "Your
title to the mine--no? _Bien!_ Take me to the line--protect me from my
enemies--and the papers are yours!"
</p><p>"Have you got them with you?" inquired Hooker with businesslike
directness.
</p><p>"No, but I can get them!" cried Aragon, forgetful of everything but his
desire to escape. "I can get them while you saddle my horse!"
</p><p>"Where?" demanded Hooker craftily.
</p><p>"From the <u>agente mineral</u>!" answered Aragon. "I have a great deal of
influence with him, and--"
</p><p>"_Bastante!_" exploded Bud in a voice which made Aragon jump. "Enough!
If you can get them, _I_ can! And we shall see, Señor Aragon, whether
this pistol of mine will not give me some influence, too!"
</p><p>"Then you will take them?" faltered Aragon as Hooker started to go.
"You will take them and leave me for Bernardo Bravo to--"
</p><p>"Listen, <u>señor</u>!" exclaimed Hooker, halting and advancing a
threatening forefinger. "A man who can hire four men to do his dirty
work needs no protection from me. You understand that--no? Then listen
again. I am going to get those papers. If I hear a word from you I will
send you to join your four men."
</p><p>He touched his gun as he spoke and strode out into the open, where he
beckoned the mineral agent from the crowd. A word in his ear and they
went down the hill together, while Don Cipriano watched from above.
Then, as they turned into the office, Aragon spat out a curse and went
to seek Manuel del Rey.
