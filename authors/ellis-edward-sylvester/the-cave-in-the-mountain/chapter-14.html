<p>Mickey had scarcely given utterance to this hopeful remark when
he drew up his mustang with a spasmodic jerk and exclaimed, in
a startled in a startled voice:</p>

<p>"Do you see <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he pointed some distance ahead, where a faint, thin
column of smoke was seen rising from the top of the rocks on the
opposite side of the canon or pass.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the pass of which our two friends
availed themselves is the only one leading through the section
of the mountains which lies to the eastward of the Rio Pecos.
That part over which Fred and Mickey were riding showed numerous
winding trails, made by the hoofs of the horses, as they passed
back and forth, bearing Apaches, Comanches, Kiowas, and, very
rarely, white men. At no very distant intervals were observed
human skeletons and bones, while they were scarcely ever out of
sight of the remains of horses or wild animals; all of which told
their tale of the scenes of violence that had taken place in that
highway of the mountains.</p>

<p>Sometimes war-parties of the tribes mentioned encountered each
other in the gorge, and passed each other in sullen silence, or,
perchance, they dashed together like so many wild beasts, fighting
with the fury of a thousand Kilkenny cats. It was as the whim
happened to rule the leaders.</p>

<p>The rocks rose perpendicularly on both sides to the height of
fifty and a hundred feet, the upper contour being irregular, and
varying in every manner imaginable. Along the upper edge of the
pass grew vegetation, while here and there, along the side, some
tree managed to obtain a precarious foothold, and sprouted forth
toward the sun. The floor of the canon was of a varied nature&mdash;rocks,
boulders, grass, streams of water, gravel, sand, and barren soil,
alternating with each other and preventing anything like an accurate
description of any particular section. A survey of this curious
specimen of nature's highway suggested the idea that the solid
mountain had been rent for many leagues by an earthquake, which,
having opened this great seam or rent, had left it gradually to
adjust itself to the changed order of things, and to be availed
of by those who were seeking a safe and speedy transit through
the almost impassable mountains.</p>

<p>Mickey and Fred checked their mustangs and carefully scrutinized
the line of smoke. It was several hundred yards in advance, on
their left, while they were following a trail that led close to
the right of the canon. They could distinguish nothing at all
that could give any additional information.</p>

<p>The fire which gave rise to the vapor had been kindled just far
enough back to cause the edge of the gorge to protrude itself
in such a way as to shut it off from the eyes of those below.
Indeed, it was not to be supposed that those who had the matter
in charge would commit any oversight which would reveal themselves
or their purpose to those from whom they desired to keep them.</p>

<p>"That is the same as the camp-fire which troubled the three Apaches
so much, and which was the means of my giving them the slip."</p>

<p>"It must have been started by some other war-party, so that their
ca'c'lations were upsit, and you had a chance to get away during
the muss. It was a sort of free fight, you see, in which, instead
of staying and getting your head cracked, you stepped down and
lift."</p>

<p>Unable to make anything of this particular signal-fire, the two
friends carefully searched for more. Had they been able to discover
one in the rear, they would have been assured that signaling was
going on, and they would not have dared to venture forward. Here
and there along the sides of the canon were openings or crevices,
generally filled with some sort of a vegetable growth, and into
most of which quite a number of men could have taken refuge, but
which, of course, were inaccessible to their horses.</p>

<p>"I can't find anything that resimbles the same," said Mickey,
alluding to the camp-fire, "though there may be some one that
is seen by the gintlemen who are cooking their shins by yon one."</p>

<p>"Will it do to go on?"</p>

<p>"It won't do to do anything else. Like enough the spalpeen yonder
has obsarved us coming, and he knows that there's a party behind
us, and, being unable to do anything himsilf, he starts up the
fire so as to scare us, and turn us back into the hands of the
spalpeens coming in our rear. Mind, I say that such may be the
case, but I ain't sure that it is."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder a bit, now, if that isn't it exactly," said
Fred, who was quite taken with the ingenious theory of his friend.
"It seems to me that the best thing that we can do is to ride
on as fast as we can."</p>

<p>"We've got to run the risk of it being all wrong, and fetching
up in the bosom of the spalpeens; but it's moighty sure we don't
make anything by standing here."</p>

<p>The Irishman turned his horse as near the middle of the canon
as possible. Fred kept close to his side, his mustang behaving
so splendidly that he gave him his unreserved confidence. The
average width of the pass was about a hundred yards, so it will
be understood that if a detachment of men were caught within it
they would be compelled to fight at a fearful disadvantage.</p>

<p>The plan of Mickey and Fred, as they discussed it while riding
along, was to keep up the moderate gallop until close upon the
fire. They would then put their animals to the highest speed and
pass the dangerous point as speedily as possible. They felt no
little misgiving as they drew near the dangerous place, and they
continually glanced upward at the rocks overhead, expecting that
a party of Indians would suddenly make their appearance and open
fire.</p>

<p>The first plan was, as they drew near, to run in as close as
possible beneath the rocks on the left, in the belief that, as
they overhung so much, the Indians above could not reach them
with a shot. But before the time came to make the attempt, it
was seen that it would not do. Accordingly, Mickey, who had maintained
a line as close as possible to the centre of the canon, suddenly
sheered his mustang to the right, until he nearly grazed the wall
there. Then he put him on a dead run, Fred Munson doing the same,
with very little space between the two steeds. A few plunges brought
them directly opposite the signal-fire, and every nerve was strained.</p>

<p>Both beasts were capable of magnificent speed and the still air
became like a hurricane as the horsemen cut their way through
it. Fred glanced upward at the crest of the rocks on the left
and fancied that he saw figures standing there, preparing to fire.
He hammered his heels against the ribs of his mustang and leaned
forward upon his neck, in the hope of making the aim as difficult
as possible.</p>

<p>Still no reports of guns were heard; and, after continuing the
terrific gait for a quarter of a mile, they gradually decreased
it until it became a moderate walk, and the riders again found
themselves side by side. Both had looked behind them a dozen times
since passing the dangerous point, but had not obtained a glimpse
of an Indian.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a number just as we were opposite," said Fred;
"but, if so, what has become of them?"</p>

<p>"Ye didn't obsarve any at all, for I kipt raising me eye that
way, and they weren't there. The whole thing is a moighty <em>puzzle</em>,
as our tacher used to remark when the sum in addition became so
big that he had to set down one number and carry anither. The
spalpeens must have manufactured that fire for our benefit, and
where's the good that it has done them?"</p>

<p>"Can't it be that it was for something else? Can't it be that
they took us for Indians, or perhaps they haven't seen us at all,
and don't know that we've passed?"</p>

<p>"It does seem as if something of the kind might be, and yet that
don't sthrike me as the Injin style of doing business."</p>

<p>They continued their moderate pace for quite a distance further,
continually looking back toward the camp-fire, the smoke from
which continued to ascend with the same distinct regularity as
before, but nothing resembling a warrior was detected. Finally
a curve in the gorge shut out the troublesome signal, and they
were left to continue their way and conjecture as much as they
chose as to the explanation of what had taken place.</p>

<p>A little later, and when the afternoon was about half gone, they
reached a portion of the pass which was remarkably straight, so
that the eye took in a half mile of it, from the beginning to
the point where another turn intervened. The two friends were
galloping over this exact section and speculating as to how soon
they would strike the open prairie, when all their calculations
were knocked topsy-turvy. A party of horsemen charged around the
bend in front, all riding at a sweeping gallop directly toward
the alarmed Mickey and Fred, who instantly halted and surveyed
them. A second glance showed them to be Indians, undoubtedly Apaches,
and very probably Lone Wolf himself and some of his warriors.</p>

<p>"We must turn back," said the Irishman, wheeling his horse about
and striking him into a rapid gait. "We've got to have a dead
run for it, and I think we can win. Holy saints presarve us!"</p>

<p>This ejaculation was caused by seeing, at that moment, another
party of horsemen appear directly in their front, as they turned
on the back trail. Thus they were shut in on both sides, and fairly
caught between two fires.</p>
