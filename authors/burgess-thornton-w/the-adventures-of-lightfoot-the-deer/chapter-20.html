<p>Day after day, Lightfoot the Deer played hide and seek for his
life with the hunters who were seeking to kill him. He saw them
many times, though not one of them saw him. More than once a hunter
passed close to Lightfoot's hiding-place without once suspecting
it.</p>

<p>But poor Lightfoot was feeling the strain. He was growing thin,
and he was so nervous that the falling of a dead leaf from a tree
would startle him. There is nothing quite so terrible as being
continually hunted. It was getting so that Lightfoot half expected
a hunter to step out from behind every tree. Only when the Black
Shadows wrapped the Green Forest in darkness did he know a moment
of peace. And those hours of safety were filled with dread of
what the next day might bring.</p>

<p>Early one morning a terrible sound rang through the Green Forest
and brought Lightfoot to his feet with a startled jump. It was
the baying of hounds following a trail. At first it did not sound
so terrible. Lightfoot had often heard it before. Many times he
had listened to the baying of Bowser the Hound, as he followed
Reddy Fox. It had not sounded so terrible then because it meant
no danger to Lightfoot.</p>

<p>At first, as he listened early that morning, he took it for granted
that those hounds were after Reddy, and so, though startled, he
was not worried. But suddenly a dreadful suspicion came to him
and he grew more and more anxious as he listened. In a few minutes
there was no longer any doubt in his mind. Those hounds were following
his trail. It was then that the sound of that baying became terrible.
He must run for his life! Those hounds would give him no rest.
And he knew that in running from them, he would no longer be able
to watch so closely for the hunters with terrible guns. He would
no longer be able to hide in thickets. At any time he might be
driven right past one of those hunters.</p>

<p>Lightfoot bounded away with such leaps as only Lightfoot can
make. In a little while the voices of the hounds grew fainter.
Lightfoot stopped to get his breath and stood trembling as he
listened. The baying of the hounds again grew louder and louder.
Those wonderful noses of theirs were following his trail without
the least difficulty. In a panic of fear, Lightfoot bounded away
again. As he crossed an old road, the Green Forest rang with the
roar of a terrible gun. Something tore a strip of bark from the
trunk of a tree just above Lightfoot's back. It was a bullet and
it had just missed Lightfoot. It added to his terror and this
in turn added to his speed.</p>

<p>So Lightfoot ran and ran, and behind him the voices of the hounds
continued to ring through the Green Forest.</p>
