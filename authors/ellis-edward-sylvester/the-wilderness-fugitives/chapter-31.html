<p>When Ned had told Lena-Wingo all, and succeeded in restoring
him to good humor, he attempted to draw from the Indian an idea
of what he had been doing since he left them. But the youth did
not gain much satisfactory information. The interview lasted but
a short time, when Lena-Wingo proposed that they should return
to their friends, who must be quite anxious over their continued
absence. He added, also, that they could not but be hungry&mdash;a
want which he took particular pains to satisfy. On the way to
where the brother and sister had been left, the Mohawk turned
off to the right, and drew from beneath a fallen tree two goodly-sized
loaves of bread and fully ten pounds of well-cooked meat.</p>

<p>"Where in the name of the seven wonders did you get that?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo make bread and cook meat," grinned the redskin.</p>

<p>"Come, now, that won't do," laughed his young friend. "You might
have cooked a piece of meat, but you never baked a loaf of bread
in your life. You have been making a call upon some of the folks
in the valley."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not that&mdash;Tory call on settler &mdash;Tory make bread&mdash;then
go to sleep&mdash;then Lena-Wingo call on Tory&mdash;go 'way&mdash;take bread."</p>

<p>That told the whole story. The Mohawk had made a raid upon some
of the thieves in the valley who had robbed some of the patriots
only to be spoiled in turn. Such being the fact, the food could
not but taste all the better to the fugitives, who were in sore
need of nourishment.</p>

<p>The fact that several Iroquois were on the hunt for Lena-Wingo
appeared to cause that individual no concern. He walked forward
as unconcernedly as if there were no such things as war and hostile
men of his own race. He agreed with Ned that it was safe to occupy
the cavern while they were compelled to hide, and until he could
complete his arrangements for guiding Rosa into Wilkesbarre. It
was prudent to keep her out of their sight while the Tories and
Indians were making diligent search for her, and the way was not
clear to run the gauntlet. The Iroquois being new-comers, it was
hardly possible that any of them knew the location of the cave
which had been occupied by the whites.</p>

<p>The conversation which Ned overheard between Bagley and Evans
confirmed this supposition.</p>

<p>As they journeyed, Lena-Wingo gradually divulged what he had
been at during the afternoon, and why it was he had been absent
so much longer than he intended. The scout had been into Wilkesbarre!</p>

<p>Before attempting to conduct Rosa thither he wished to reconnoitre
the ground, and was more successful than he expected. Stealing
up close to the rude fortifications, he managed to make himself
recognized, and secured admission without any of his enemies suspecting
the daring act. Had he been accompanied by Rosa at this time,
he could have conducted her safely within; but he established
an understanding with the inmates, so as to feel sure that when
the time came to make the effort, he would run no risk of being
injured by his friends, or of having his entrance dangerously
delayed when he should claim admittance. In leaving the town,
the Mohawk was observed by several Iroquois, and became engaged
with them, but escaped with his usual good fortune.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo had no more than finished his narration when the cavern
was reached, and they paused a moment or two to examine it. The
Mohawk entered, and as he came back reported that it was as when
he last saw it, adding that no place existed in the neighborhood
which would serve as well for a real hiding-place for the young
lady while her friends were preparing for the entry into Wilkesbarre.
Taking this as his starting point again, Ned Clinton had no difficulty
in finding the spot where he had bid good-bye to Jo and his sister.
By the time the place was fairly identified, the two came forward
and greeted him and the Mohawk.</p>

<p>The meeting was pleasant to all, for there was something in the
presence of the famous and skillful scout that filled the three
with confidence and hope. When he revealed the provisions he brought,
there was some merriment, increased by the narration that Ned
gave as to the manner in which it had been secured. The last food
the fugitives ate was on the night preceding, so that all were
in the condition to appreciate his thoughtful kindness. When the
noonday meal was finished they had made a goodly-sized reduction
of the supply. The sensation of the occasion came afterward, when
Ned told how Evans had met his end at the hands of the Mohawk,
after completing his arrangements to capture the sleeping fugitives
in the cavern.</p>

<p>Jo and his sister shuddered at the thought that they had been
so nearly in the hands of the fearful scourge of the valley, and
it was hard to understand why he spared them as they slept. The
remembrance that the three had actually allowed themselves to
become unconscious while he mounted guard over them, made all
tremble as though the danger was not yet passed. Rosa and Jo expected
that the Mohawk would be angered when he learned how his wishes
had been disregarded, but Ned had already succeeded in calming
his impatience. The event could not but be a lesson to all, since
it was that disregard which came so near defeating the whole plan
of procedure. None of the friends made any reference to it, nor
did Lena-Wingo, but there came a resolve which took a deep hold
of the hearts of the three that hereafter, while in the woods,
the instructions of the Mohawk should be followed to the letter,
even though the threatened consequences were death itself.</p>

<p>The provisions which were left were carefully gathered up and
carried to the cavern, which it was agreed should remain their
headquarters. It was near midday, the sun only having slightly
crossed the meridian. The weather was so warm that all were glad
of the chance to spend an hour or two in doing nothing. Near by
was a small stream of clear, cool, gushing water, from which they
slaked their thirst, while they sat down beneath a large tree,
to listen to the plan the Mohawk had decided upon. This he explained
briefly, for the scheme was simple and easily comprehended, it
being nothing more than to wait where they were until he could
find the easiest way by which to enter Wilkesbarre.</p>

<p>The establishment of an understanding with the garrison was a
necessary step, in which he had been fortunate. It had been his
aim to do this also without discovery, and, had he succeeded,
he would have conducted the entire party around to the opposite
side, and run safely into shelter with them before sunset. The
Iroquois having detected him as he was coming out, the difficulty
of the return was greatly increased. But for the fact, also, that
Captain Bagley had learned from Evans before his death that the
young lady was concealed in the woods, Lena-Wingo was confident
he could have made the warriors believe he had delivered her there,
and thus greatly simplified the real task of doing so.</p>
