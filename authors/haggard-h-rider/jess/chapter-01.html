<p>The day had been very hot even for the Transvaal, where the days still
know how to be hot in the autumn, although the neck of the summer is
broken--especially when the thunderstorms hold off for a week or two, as
they do occasionally. Even the succulent blue lilies--a variety of the
agapanthus which is so familiar to us in English greenhouses--hung their
long trumpet-shaped flowers and looked oppressed and miserable, beneath
the burning breath of the hot wind which had been blowing for hours like
the draught from a volcano. The grass, too, near the wide roadway
that stretched in a feeble and indeterminate fashion across the veldt,
forking, branching, and reuniting like the veins on a lady’s arm, was
completely coated over with a thick layer of red dust. But the hot wind
was going down now, as it always does towards sunset. Indeed, all that
remained of it were a few strictly local and miniature whirlwinds,
which would suddenly spring up on the road itself, and twist and twirl
fiercely round, raising a mighty column of dust fifty feet or more into
the air, where it hung long after the wind had passed, and then slowly
dissolved as its particles floated to the earth.
</p><p>Advancing along the road, in the immediate track of one of these
desultory and inexplicable whirlwinds, was a man on horseback. The man
looked limp and dirty, and the horse limper and dirtier. The hot wind
had “taken all the bones out of them,” as the Kafirs say, which was
not very much to be wondered at, seeing that they had been journeying
through it for the last four hours without off-saddling. Suddenly the
whirlwind, which had been travelling along smartly, halted, and the
dust, after revolving a few times in the air like a dying top, slowly
began to disperse in the accustomed fashion. The man on the horse halted
also, and contemplated it in an absent kind of way.
</p><p>“It’s just like a man’s life,” he said aloud to his horse, “coming from
nobody knows where, nobody knows why, and making a little column of dust
on the world’s highway, then passing away, leaving the dust to fall to
the ground again, to be trodden under foot and forgotten.”
</p><p>The speaker, a stout, well set-up, rather ugly man, apparently on the
wrong side of thirty, with pleasant blue eyes and a reddish peaked
beard, laughed a little at his own sententious reflection, and then gave
his jaded horse a tap with the <u>sjambock</u> in his hand.
</p><p>“Come on, Blesbok,” he said, “or we shall never get to old Croft’s place
to-night. By Jove! I believe that must be the turn,” and he pointed with
his whip to a little rutty track that branched from the Wakkerstroom
main road and stretched away towards a curious isolated hill with a
large flat top, which rose out of the rolling plain some four miles to
the right. “The old Boer said the second turn,” he went on still talking
to himself, “but perhaps he lied. I am told that some of them think it
is a good joke to send an Englishman a few miles wrong. Let’s see, they
told me the place was under the lee of a table-topped hill, about half
an hour’s ride from the main road, and that is a table-topped hill, so I
think I will try it. Come on, Blesbok,” and he put the tired nag into
a sort of “tripple,” or ambling canter much affected by South African
horses.
</p><p>“Life is a queer thing,” reflected Captain John Niel to himself as he
cantered along slowly. “Now here am I, at the age of thirty-four, about
to begin the world again as assistant to an old Transvaal farmer. It is
a pretty end to all one’s ambitions, and to fourteen years’ work in the
army; but it is what it has come to, my boy, so you had better make the
best of it.”
</p><p>Just then his cogitations were interrupted, for on the farther side of
a gentle slope suddenly there appeared an extraordinary sight. Over the
crest of the rise of land, now some four or five hundred yards away, a
pony with a lady on its back galloped wildly, and after it, with wings
spread and outstretched neck, a huge cock ostrich was speeding in
pursuit, covering twelve or fifteen feet at every stride of its long
legs. The pony was still twenty yards ahead of the bird, and travelling
towards John rapidly, but strive as it would it could not distance the
swiftest thing on all the earth. Five seconds passed--the great bird was
close alongside now--Ah! and John Niel turned sick and shut his eyes as
he rode, for he saw the ostrich’s thick leg fly high into the air and
then sweep down like a leaded bludgeon!
</p><p>_Thud!_ It had missed the lady and struck her horse upon the spine, just
behind the saddle, for the moment completely paralysing it so that it
fell all of a heap on to the veldt. In a moment the girl on its back was
up and running towards him, and after her came the ostrich. Up went the
great leg again, but before it could come crashing across her shoulders
she had flung herself face downwards on the grass. In an instant the
huge bird was on the top of her, kicking at her, rolling over her, and
crushing the very life out of her. It was at this juncture that John
Niel arrived upon the scene. The moment the ostrich saw him it gave up
its attacks upon the lady on the ground and began to waltz towards him
with the pompous sort of step that these birds sometimes assume before
they give battle. Now Captain Niel was unaccustomed to the pleasant ways
of ostriches, and so was his horse, which showed a strong inclination to
bolt; as, indeed, under other circumstances, his rider would have been
glad to do himself. But he could not abandon beauty in distress, so,
finding it impossible to control his horse, he slipped off it, and with
the <u>sjambock</u> or hide-whip in his hand valiantly faced the enemy. For
a moment or two the great bird stood still, blinking its lustrous round
eyes at him and gently swaying its graceful neck to and fro.
</p><p>Then all of a sudden it spread out its wings and came for him like
a thunderbolt. John sprang to one side, and was aware of a rustle of
rushing feathers, and of a vision of a thick leg striking downwards
past his head. Fortunately it missed him, and the ostrich sped on like
a flash. Before he could turn, however, it was back and had landed
the full weight of one of its awful forward kicks on the broad of his
shoulders, and away he went head-over-heels like a shot rabbit. In a
second he was on his legs again, shaken indeed, but not much the worse,
and perfectly mad with fury and pain. At him came the ostrich, and at
the ostrich went he, catching it a blow across the slim neck with his
<u>sjambock</u> that staggered it for a moment. Profiting by the check, he
seized the bird by the wing and held on like grim death with both hands.
Now they began to gyrate, slowly at first, then quicker, and yet more
quick, till at last it seemed to Captain John Niel that time and space
and the solid earth were nothing but a revolving vision fixed somewhere
in the watches of the night. Above him, like a stationary pivot, towered
the tall graceful neck, beneath him spun the top-like legs, and in front
of him was a soft black and white mass of feathers.
</p><p>Thud, and a cloud of stars! He was on his back, and the ostrich, which
did not seem to be affected by giddiness, was on <u>him</u>, punishing him
dreadfully. Luckily an ostrich cannot kick a man very hard when he is
flat on the ground. If he could, there would have been an end of John
Niel, and his story need never have been written.
</p><p>Half a minute or so passed, during which the bird worked his sweet will
upon his prostrate enemy, and at the end of it the man began to feel
very much as though his earthly career was closed. Just as things were
growing faint and dim to him, however, he suddenly saw a pair of white
arms clasp themselves round the ostrich’s legs from behind, and heard a
voice cry:
</p><p>“Break his neck while I hold his legs, or he will kill you.”
</p><p>This roused him from his torpor, and he staggered to his feet. Meanwhile
the ostrich and the young lady had come to the ground, and were rolling
about together in a confused heap, over which the elegant neck and open
hissing mouth wavered to and fro like a cobra about to strike. With a
rush John seized the neck in both his hands, and, putting out all his
strength (for he was a strong man), he twisted it till it broke with a
snap, and after a few wild and convulsive bounds and struggles the great
bird lay dead.
</p><p>Then he sank down dazed and exhausted, and surveyed the scene. The
ostrich was perfectly quiet, and would never kick again, and the lady
too was quiet. He wondered vaguely if the brute had killed her--he was
as yet too weak to go and see--and then fell to gazing at her face. Her
head was pillowed on the body of the dead bird, and its feathery plumes
made it a fitting resting-place. Slowly it dawned on him that the face
was very beautiful, although it looked so pale just now. Low broad brow,
crowned with soft yellow hair, the chin very round and white, the mouth
sweet though rather large. The eyes he could not see, because they
were closed, for the lady had fainted. For the rest, she was quite
young--about twenty, tall and finely formed. Presently he felt a little
better, and, creeping towards her (for he was sadly knocked about), took
her hand and began to chafe it between his own. It was a well-formed
hand, but brown, and showed signs of doing plenty of hard work. Soon she
opened her eyes, and he noted with satisfaction that they were very good
eyes, blue in colour. Then she sat up and laughed a little.
</p><p>“Well, I am silly,” she said; “I believe I fainted.”
</p><p>“It is not much to be wondered at,” said John Niel politely, and lifting
his hand to take off his hat, only to find that it had gone in the fray.
“I hope you are not very much hurt by the bird.”
</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said doubtfully. “But I am glad that you killed the
<u>skellum</u> (vicious beast). He got out of the ostrich camp three days
ago, and has been lost ever since. He killed a boy last year, and I told
uncle he ought to shoot him then, but he would not, because he was such
a beauty.”
</p><p>“Might I ask,” said John Niel, “are you Miss Croft?”
</p><p>“Yes, I am--one of them. There are two of us, you know; and I can guess
who you are--you are Captain Niel, whom uncle is expecting to help him
with the farm and the ostriches.”
</p><p>“If all of them are like that,” he said, pointing to the dead bird, “I
don’t think that I shall take kindly to ostrich farming.”
</p><p>She laughed, showing a charming line of teeth. “Oh no,” she said,
“he was the only bad one--but, Captain Niel, I think you will find it
fearfully dull. There are nothing but Boers about here, you know. No
English people live nearer than Wakkerstroom.”
</p><p>“You overlook yourself,” he said, bowing; for really this daughter of
the wilderness had a very charming air about her.
</p><p>“Oh,” she answered, “I am only a girl, you know, and besides, I am
not clever. Jess, now--that’s my sister--Jess has been at school at
Capetown, and she <u>is</u> clever. I was at Cape Town, too, though I didn’t
learn much there. But, Captain Niel, both the horses have bolted; mine
has gone home, and I expect yours has followed, and I should like to
know how we are going to get up to Mooifontein--beautiful fountain,
that’s what we call our place, you know. Can you walk?”
</p><p>“I don’t know,” he answered doubtfully; “I’ll try. That bird has knocked
me about a good deal,” and accordingly he staggered on to his legs, only
to collapse with an exclamation of pain. His ankle was sprained, and
he was so stiff and bruised that he could hardly stir. “How far is the
house?” he asked.
</p><p>“Only about a mile--just there; we shall see it from the crest of the
rise. Look, I’m all right. It was silly to faint, but he kicked all the
breath out of me,” and she got up and danced a little on the grass to
show him. “My word, though, I am sore! You must take my arm, that’s all;
that is if you don’t mind?”
</p><p>“Oh dear no, indeed, I don’t mind,” he said laughing; and so they
started, arm affectionately linked in arm.
