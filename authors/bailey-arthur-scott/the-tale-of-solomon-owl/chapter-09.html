<p>Solomon Owl was afraid of fire. And when he looked down from his perch in
the tree and saw, through the hole in the stranger’s crown, that all was
aglow inside his big, round head, Solomon couldn’t help voicing his
horror. He “<u>whoo-whooed</u>” so loudly that Tommy Fox, at the foot of the
tree, asked him what on earth was the matter.
</p>
<p>“His head’s all afire!” Solomon Owl told him. “That’s what makes his eyes
glare so. And that’s why the fire shines through his mouth and his nose,
too. It’s no wonder he didn’t answer my question—for, of course, his
tongue must certainly be burned to a cinder.”
</p><p>“Then it ought to be safe for anybody to enter the chicken house,” Tommy
Fox observed. “What could the stranger do, when he’s in such a fix?”
</p><p>“He could set the chicken house afire, if he followed you inside,” replied
Solomon Owl wisely. “And I, for one, am not going near the pullets
to-night.”
</p><p>“Nor I!” Fatty Coon echoed. “I’m going straight to the cornfield. The corn
is still standing there in shocks; and I ought to find enough ears to make
a good meal.”
</p><p>But Solomon Owl and Tommy Fox were not interested in corn. They never ate
it. And so it is not surprising that they should be greatly disappointed.
After a person has his mouth all made up for chicken it is hard to think
of anything that would taste even half as good.
</p><p>“It’s queer he doesn’t go and hold his head under the pump,” said Solomon
Owl. “That’s what I should do, if I were he.”
</p><p>“Jimmy Rabbit had better not go too near him, or he’ll get singed,” said
Tommy Fox, anxiously. “I don’t want anything to happen to <u>him</u>.”
</p><p>“Jimmy Rabbit is very careless,” Solomon declared. “I don’t see what he’s
thinking of—going so near a fire! It makes me altogether too nervous to
stay here. And I’m going away at once.”
</p><p>Tommy Fox said that he felt the same way. And the moment Fatty Coon, with
his sharp claws, started to crawl down the tree on his way to the
cornfield, Tommy Fox hurried off without even stopping to say good-bye.
</p><p>“<u>Haw-haw-haw-hoo</u>!” laughed Solomon Owl. “Tommy Fox is afraid of you!” he
told Fatty Coon.
</p><p>But Fatty didn’t seem to hear him. He was thinking only of the supper of
corn that he was going to have.
</p><p>“Better come away!” Solomon Owl called to Jimmy Rabbit, turning his head
toward the fence where Jimmy had been lingering near the hot-headed
stranger.
</p><p>But Jimmy Rabbit didn’t answer him, either. He was no longer there. The
moment he had seen Tommy Fox bounding off across the meadow Jimmy had
started at once for Farmer Green’s vegetable garden.
</p><p>So Solomon Owl was the last to leave.
</p><p>“There’s really nothing else I can do,” he remarked to himself. “I don’t
know what Aunt Polly Woodchuck would say if she knew that I didn’t follow
her advice to-night and eat a pullet for my supper.... But I’ve tried my
best.... And that’s all anybody can do.”
</p><p>Solomon Owl was upset all the rest of that night. And just before daybreak
he visited the farmyard again, to see whether the strange man with the
flaring head still watched the chicken house. And Solomon found that he
had vanished.
</p><p>So Solomon Owl alighted on the fence. There was nothing there except a
hollowed-out pumpkin, with a few holes cut in it, which someone had left
on one of the fence-posts.
</p><p>“Good!” said he. “Maybe I can get my pullet after all!” He turned to fly
to the chicken house. But just then the woodshed door opened again. And
Farmer Green stepped outside, with a lantern in his hand. He was going to
the barn to milk the cows. But Solomon Owl did not wait to learn anything
more.
</p><p>He hurried away to his house among the hemlocks. And having quickly
settled himself for a good nap, he was soon fast asleep.
</p><p>That was how Johnnie Green’s jack-o’-lantern kept Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon
and Solomon Owl from taking any chickens on Hallowe’en.
