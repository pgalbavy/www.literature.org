<p>With an exclamation of affright, Jack Carleton whirled on his
heel and found the broad, grinning face of one of the warriors
almost against his own. Holding the rifle back, as if expecting
an attempt to recover it, the savage thrust his head forward,
with a tantalizing expression overspreading his ugly features.
At the same moment he muttered something very rapidly in his own
tongue. Not a word was understood by Jack, but he was sure the
warrior said, "Ah, ha, young man, I've caught you, and you can't
help yourself."</p>

<p>The experience of Otto Relstaub was slightly different from that
of his companion. When he found his rifle gone and a squatty Indian
at his elbow, he was panic-stricken.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!" he exclaimed, "this ain't de best place for
me; I dinks I goes to some oder place."</p>

<p>Naturally he made a dash to retrace his steps, but the warrior
was too quick for him. He had taken his second step only, when
his captor grasped the ankle of the foot that was rising from
the ground, and drew backward with such force that Otto sprawled
on his face.</p>

<p>Jack, who could not believe that these red men were of a very
sanguinary disposition, laughed outright over the discomfiture
of his friend.</p>

<p>"Can't you kick him loose?" he called.</p>

<p>"If he don't hang on too tight," replied Otto, trying with might
and main to free himself.</p>

<p>The moment the boys were captured, the attention of the entire
company was centred upon them. All talking ceased, and every one
stood up and looked toward the point of interest. Several went
forward to meet the captives, and the general grin that lighted
up the aboriginal countenances seemed to shed a mild sort of sunlight
among and under the trees.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Jack to his friend; "we can't get away until
they are ready to let us go."</p>

<p>"Vot does they mean to do mit us?"</p>

<p>"That is hard to tell," replied the young Kentuckian, with a
serious countenance; "I don't know to what tribe they belong,
but I believe they ain't half as bad as the Shawanoes."</p>

<p>"Dey couldn't be any more cruel don dem," was the truthful observation
of the young German.</p>

<p>In the course of a few seconds the boys were fully introduced
to the camp-fire of the strange Indians, who were not in war paint,
and who, as the boys rightly believed, belonged to a less bloodthirsty
totem than did the redskins on the eastern bank of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Every warrior was standing on his feet, and they all crowded
around the boys, as though they had never seen any of their race
until that moment. They continually talked in their guttural,
grunting fashion, smiling and nodding their heads. Two of them
pinched the limbs of the boys as though testing their muscle.
So far from showing any alarm, Jack Carleton clenched his fist
and elevated his arm, swaying the hand back and forth as if proud
to display the development of his biceps. But Otto was in too
doleful a mood to indulge in anything of the kind.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, the Indians could not feel the slightest
misgiving on account of their prisoners. They must have known
of the settlement only a few miles distant, and they had not offered
to disturb it, nor had they molested any of the pioneers when
they ventured into the woods in quest of game.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it can be readily seen that, so far as the
settlers were concerned, the Indians were safe. Although within
gunshot of Martinsville, the red men took no precaution at all
against molestation from them.</p>

<p>It struck Jack as curious that among the warriors gathered around
them, not one had as yet spoken a word that he could understand.
The American race have shown a quickness from the first to pick
up expressions from the language of those near them. Who has forgotten
Samoset's "Welcome, Englishmen!" uttered to the first settlers
at Plymouth, who were at a loss to understand where the red man
learned the pleasant words?</p>

<p>Jack Carleton, who retained his self-possession much better than
did his friend, listened hopefully for some word which he could
recognize.</p>

<p>While he was disappointed in that respect, he could not believe
that he and Otto were in any imminent peril from their captors,
though, on the other hand, he was very far from feeling safe against
harm. With a coolness that must have awakened admiration among
the barbarians, the youth, standing in the middle of the group,
folded his arms, and smilingly looked in the repellant faces,
none of which were at a greater altitude than his own.</p>

<p>After pinching different parts of the bodies of the boys, the
Indians seemed to be satisfied and stepped back. The majority
sat down on the log, others sauntered away, relighting their pipes
that had burned out, and the two who had been serving as cooks,
gave their attention to the venison steak, whose appetizing odor
filled the surrounding space.</p>

<p>"Otto, we may as well take it quietly," said Jack, sauntering
to the butt of the log, and seating himself, "they don't mean
to tomahawk us just yet, and I hope they will give us some dinner
before they dispose of us."</p>

<p>The German imitated the action of Jack, but he did not share
his self-possession. He shook his head in a way which showed he
was far from feeling comfortable.</p>

<p>"You seem more scared than when we were behind the logs, with
the Shawanoes and Hurons on the outside," said Jack; "I don't
understand how that can be. I am sure there is less to dread from
these Indians than from them."</p>

<p>"It ain't de Injins dot makes me feel so bad," replied Otto with
a rueful expression, "but fader."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"De colt is lost and now dey takes mine gun from me; if I goes
back dot way, fader will whip me harder than ever."</p>

<p>Jack was serious for a moment and then he laughed.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed that <em>that</em> was your trouble. Of course,
if you go home without your gun the old gentleman will be angry,
but there is one good thing about the matter."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"No matter what happens, he can't be any meaner and more cruel
than he is now."</p>

<p>Otto removed his tall, conical hat, looked thoughtfully down
at the ground in front, and slowly scratched his head. Manifestly
he was in deep thought. Suddenly he looked up, his face aglow.</p>

<p>"Dot is so. I don't care now vot dey takes, I will valks home
and tells fader and moder dot I lost it, den won't they be mad!
Oh, mine gracious!"</p>

<p>And leaning far back on the log and donning his hat, he slapped
his knee with his right hand and shook all over with laughter.
There is something contagious in such an exhibition, as we all
know, and not only did Jack laugh in unison, but several of the
warriors showed they were amused.</p>

<p>"I thought all the time Otto was alarmed on account of the Indians,"
said Jack to himself, "and it was nothing of the kind; he was
only afraid that his father will be madder than ever when he goes
back not only without the lost horse, but without some of the
property he took away with him. Now that fear is gone and Otto
begins to feel better than I do, for," thought the youth, looking
around him, "we certainly are not in the best situation in the
world."</p>

<p>The youth could not help observing that while the Indians seemed
to pay little attention to them, he and Otto were under strict
surveillance. As no motion had been made to bind them, the boys
could make a sudden break or dash for liberty whenever the whim
took possession of them, but nothing could be gained and a great
deal might be lost by such an attempt. Stumpy and heavy-set as
were the warriors, they could easily outrun their captives, and
rather than permit them to get away, they would doubtless riddle
them with bullets. Consequently, while the same thought came to
each of the friends more than once, as they sat conversing on
the log, neither proposed any effort to get away.</p>

<p>They had brought nothing in the shape of lunch with them, and
it may be doubted whether any one of the Indians was more ravenously
hungry than were they. It would go hard with them, if deprived
of their share of the dinner, prepared by the aboriginal cooks.</p>

<p>When the huge slices of venison were half broiled, the distribution
followed. The cooks handled their hunting-knives with such deftness,
that in a twinkling, as may be said, the jaws of the entire party
were vigorously at work. After receiving their respective shares,
few made the slightest use of their knives. The aborigines live
and eat so much like wild animals, that, almost without exception,
they possess admirable teeth which need no artificial assistance.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" whispered Jack, "I believe they don't mean to
give us so much as a bite."</p>

<p>"If dey doesn't do so, den I dies mit hunger," was the despairing
exclamation of Otto, who forgot that only a few hours had passed
since he had partaken liberally of food. "I never felt so hungry
as I feels now, and now I'm growing worser&#11834;"</p>

<p>Something thumped against the side of the speaker's head with
such force that his hat fell off. Jack had just time to see that
it was a piece of cooked venison, when a similar blessing struck
him.</p>

<p>The two Indians were dexterous throwers, and they and half a
dozen were grinning over the result.</p>

<p>The result was satisfactory in every way to the victims, if such
they may be considered, for, besides furnishing them with the
much-needed nourishment, it was a strong proof of the indifference,
if not the good-will of their captors. Had they felt ill inclined
toward the boys, they would not have shown such kindness toward
them.</p>

<p>"When you are in Rome, do as the Romans do," laughed Jack, seating
himself on the fallen tree and devouring the half-cooked meat
with the gusto of those around him. Indeed he and Otto had eaten
many a time in a similar style, and few persons find difficulty
in making savages of themselves in every respect, whenever the
inclination so to do takes possession of them.</p>

<p>The boys would have relished double the amount of food, but enough
had been given to remove all discomfort, and they would have found
it hard to describe the thorough enjoyment the lunch imparted.</p>

<p>But now that the troublesome question was answered, the thought
of the youths naturally turned to the immediate future. Had these
Indians formed any purpose respecting their prisoners? If so,
what was it likely to be? Did they intend to kill them with rifle,
tomahawk, or knife? Or would they be taken away captives? Did
the red men belong to the Osage tribe of Indians, or was theirs
some fiercer or milder totem from a distant part of the country?</p>

<p>It is a fact that among many of the early settlements in Missouri
and other Western States, the warriors who were occasionally encountered
in the forests, or who fired from the cover of the trees, belonged
to tribes whose hunting-grounds were many leagues away. They were
not Shawanoe, Huron, Pottawatomie, Osage, Miami, Delaware, Illinois,
Kickapoo, or Winnebago. Sometimes a veteran trapper recognized
the dress and general appearance that he had noted among the red
men to the northward, and far beyond the Assiniboine; others who
had ventured hundreds of miles to the westward, remembered exchanging
shots with similar dusky warriors on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Indeed it cannot be questioned that the American race not only
produced warriors, orators, and magnificent leaders, but it had
its travelers and explorers&mdash;the name being accepted in its restricted
meaning.</p>

<p>More than once Jack had wondered whether this party had not come
from a long distance in the interior, perhaps hundreds of miles,
and that having completed the errand on which they had journeyed
so far, were now on their return.</p>

<p>"If this is so," he said to Otto, when they observed the party
making preparations to leave, "they will take us on a good long
march."</p>

<p>"I dinks maybe dey knocks us in the head, so as not to makes
us feel bad apout going away from home."</p>

<p>Further conversation was checked by some minutes of bustle and
activity. The Indians seemed to have come very suddenly to the
conclusion to depart, and the boys naturally shared the excitement;
but possibly their dismay can be imagined, when it became apparent
that the red men intended to divide into two parties, and that
as a consequence the boys would have to part company, and who
shall say whether it was to be for a few days, a few years, or
forever?</p>
