<p>Melville Clarendon went up the short stairs three steps at a
time, startled as much by the call of his sister as by anything
that had taken place since the siege of the cabin began.</p>

<p>As he entered the room he saw Dot sitting up in bed, and staring
wonderingly at the shivered window-glass, particles of which lay
all around.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mel!" said she, "papa will scold you for doing that; how
came you to do it?"</p>

<p>"It was the bad Indians who fired through the window at me, and
I fired at them: you were sleeping so soundly that you only half
awoke; but you must keep still a few minutes longer."</p>

<p>"I thought that was you on the roof," she added, in a lower voice.</p>

<p>That there was someone overhead was certain. The rasping sound
of a person moving carefully along the peak of the roof was audible.
The lad understood the meaning of that which puzzled him when
on the lower floor: one of the warriors was carefully climbing
the chimney&mdash;a task not difficult, because of its rough uneven
formation.</p>

<p>The significance of such a strange act remained to be seen. It
appeared unlikely that any of the Sioux were daring enough to
attempt a descent of the chimney; but that such was really his
purpose became clear within the following minute.</p>

<p>The Indian, after making his way a short distance along the peak,
returned to the chimney, where, from the noises which reached
the listening ones, it was manifest that he was actually making
his way down the flue, broad enough to admit the passage of a
larger body than himself.</p>

<p>"I won't be caught foul <em>this</em> time," said Melville, turning
to descend the stairs again; "Dot, stay right where you are on
the bed till I come back or call to you."</p>

<p>She promised to obey, and there could be no doubt that she would
do so.</p>

<p>"They must think I'm stupid," muttered the youth, taking his
position in the middle of the room, with his rifle cocked and
ready for instant use; "but they will find out the idiot is some
one else."</p>

<p>He had not long to wait when in the large open space at the back
of the stove appeared a pair of moccasins groping vaguely about
for support. The pipe from the stove, instead of passing directly
up the chimney, entered it by means of an elbow. Had it been otherwise,
the daring warrior would have found himself in a bad fix on arriving
at the bottom.</p>

<p>It would have been idle for the young man standing on the watch
to fire at the feet or legs, and he waited an instant, when the
Indian dropped lightly on his feet, and, without the least hesitation,
stepped forward in the apartment and confronted Melville.</p>

<p>The latter was dumbfounded, for the first glance at his face
showed that he was the chieftain Red Feather, the Indian whom
of all others he least expected to see.</p>

<p>The act of the savage was without any possible explanation to
the astonished youth, who, recoiling a step, stared at him, and
uttered the single exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Red Feather!"</p>

<p>"Howly do, broder?" was the salutation of the Sioux, whose dusky
face showed just the faintest smile.</p>

<p>Red Feather's descent of the chimney had not been without some
disagreeable features. His blanket and garments, never very tidy,
were covered with soot, enough of which had got on his face to
suggest that he had adopted the usual means of his people to show
they were on the war-path.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "A pair of moccasins groping vaguely about for
support."]</p>

<p>His knife and tomahawk were thrust in his girdle at his waist,
and throughout this laborious task he had held his rifle fast,
so that he was fully armed.</p>

<p>"Howly do?" he repeated, extending his hand, which Melville was
too prudent to accept.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, compressing his lips, and keeping his finger
on the trigger of his gun, "Red Feather speaks with a double tongue;
he is not our friend."</p>

<p>"Red Feather been bad Injin&mdash;want white folks' scalp&mdash;don't want
'em now&mdash;little pappoose pray to Great Spirit&mdash;<em>dat</em> make
Red Feather feel bad&mdash;he hab pappoose&mdash;he lub Injin pappoose&mdash;lub
white pappoose&mdash;much lub white pappoose."</p>

<p>This remark shed light upon the singular incident. To Melville
it was a mystery beyond understanding that any person could look
upon the sweet innocent face of Dot without loving her. Knowing
how vile an Indian Red Feather had been, it was yet a question
with the youth whether he could find it in his heart to wish ill
to his wee bit of a sister.</p>

<p>Was it unreasonable, therefore, to believe that this savage warrior
had been touched by the sight of the little one on her knees,
with her hands clasped in prayer, and by her eagerness to keep
away all harm from him?</p>

<p>This theory helped to explain what took place after the release
of Red Feather from his odd imprisonment. The five warriors whom
he had brought with him upon his raid must have combated his proposal
to leave the children unharmed. In the face of his savage overbearing
disposition they had fought his wish to keep the pledge to them,
while he as firmly insisted upon its fulfilment.</p>

<p>But if such were the fact, how could his descent of the chimney
be explained?</p>

<p>Melville did not try to explain it, for he had no time just then
to speculate upon it; the explanation would come shortly.</p>

<p>The youth, however, was too wise to act upon that which he hoped
was the truth. He had retreated nearly to the other side of the
room, where he maintained the same defiant attitude as at first.</p>

<p>Red Feather read the distrust in his face and manner. With a
deliberation that was not lacking in dignity, he walked slowly
to the corner of the apartment, Melville closely following him
with his eye, and leaned his gun against the logs. Then he drew
his knife and tomahawk from his girdle, and threw them on the
floor beside the more valuable weapon. That done, he moved back
to the fire-place, folded his arms, and, fixing his black eyes
on the countenance of the lad, repeated&mdash;"Red Feather friend of
white folk."</p>

<p>"I believe you," responded Melville, carefully letting down the
hammer of his rifle and resting the stock on the floor; "now I
am glad to shake hands with you."</p>

<p>A broader smile than before lit up the dusky face as the chief
warmly pressed the hand of the youth, who felt just a little trepidation
when their palms met.</p>

<p>"Where pappoose?" asked Red Feather, looking suggestively at
the steps leading to the upper story.</p>

<p>"Dot!" called Melville, "come down here; someone wants to see
you."</p>

<p>The patter of feet was heard, and the next instant the little
one came tripping downstairs, with her doll clasped by one arm
to her breast.</p>

<p>"Red Feather is a good Indian now, and he wants to shake hands
with you."</p>

<p>With a faint blush and a sweet smile Dot ran across the floor
and held out her tiny hand. The chieftain stooped, and not only
took the palm of the little girl, but placed each of his own under
her shoulders and lifted her from the floor. Straightening up,
he touched his dusky lips to those of the innocent one, murmuring,
with a depth of emotion which cannot be described&mdash;</p>

<p>"Red Feather lub white pappoose&mdash;she make him good Injin&mdash;he
be her friend always."</p>

<p>The chieftain touched his lips but once to those of the little
one, who showed no hesitation in accepting the salute. Pure, innocent,
and good herself, she had not yet learned how evil the human heart
may become.</p>

<p>Not only did she receive the salute willingly, but threw her
free arm around the neck of the Indian and gave him a kiss.</p>

<p>"Red Feather, what made you come down the chimney?" questioned
Melville when the Indian had released his sister.</p>

<p>"Can't come oder way," was the instant response.</p>

<p>"True; but why do you want to enter this house?"</p>

<p>"Be friend of white folk&mdash;come tell 'em."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that; but what can you do for us?"</p>

<p>Red Feather gave no direct answer to this question, but walked
upstairs. As he did so he left every one of his weapons on the
lower floor, and by a glance cast over his shoulder expressed
the wish that the brother and sister should follow him. They did
so, Dot tripping ahead, while Melville retained his weapons.</p>

<p>Reaching the upper floor, the Sioux walked directly to the window
through which the shots had come that shattered the two panes
of glass.</p>

<p>There was a curious smile on his swarthy face as he pointed at
the pane on the left, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Red Feather fire <em>dat!</em>"</p>

<p>The explanation of his remark was that had Melville kept his
place in front of the window at the moment the rifles were discharged,
only one of the bullets would have hit him, and that would have
been the one which Red Feather did not fire.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'She make him good Injin&mdash;he be her friend always.'"
&mdash;Page 51]</p>

<p>The shot which he sent into the apartment, and which filled the
youth with so much indignation, had been fired for the purpose
of making the other warriors believe the chieftain was as bitter
an enemy of the brother and sister as he was of all white people.</p>

<p>Having convinced his followers on this point, he made his position
still stronger with them by declaring his purpose of descending
the chimney, and having it out with them, or rather with the lad,
within the building.</p>

<p>Red Feather peered out of the window, taking care that none of
his warriors saw him, though they must have felt a strong curiosity
to learn the result of his strange effort to overcome the little
garrison. Melville supposed that he had arranged to communicate
with them by signal, for the result of the attempt must be settled
quickly.</p>

<p>The youth took the liberty of peeping forth from the other window
on the same side of the house.</p>

<p>Only two of the Sioux were in their field of vision, and their
actions did not show that they felt much concern for their chief.
They were mounted on their horses, and riding at a walk towards
the elevations from which Red Feather had waved his blanket to
the brother and sister when on the other side of the stream.</p>

<p>Melville's first thought was that they had decided to leave the
place, but that hope was quickly dispelled by the action of the
warriors. At the highest point of the hill they checked their
ponies, and sat for a minute gazing fixedly to the northward in
the direction of the settlement.</p>

<p>"They are looking for our friends," thought the youth, "but I
am afraid they will not be in sight for a good while to come."</p>

<p>At this juncture one of the warriors deliberately rose to a standing
position on the back of his pony, and turned his gaze to the westward.</p>

<p>"Now they are looking for <em>their</em> friends," was the correct
conclusion of Melville, "and I am afraid they see them; yes, there
is no doubt of it."</p>

<p>The warrior, in assuming his delicate position, passed his rifle
to his companion, whose horse was beside him. Then, with his two
hands free, he drew his blanket from around his shoulders and
began waving it, as Red Feather had done earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Melville glanced across at Red Feather, who was attentively watching
the performance. He saw the countenance grow more forbidding,
while a scowl settled on his brow.</p>

<p>It was easy to translate all this. The Sioux had caught sight
of some of their friends, and signalled them. This would not have
been done had there not been some person or persons to observe
it.</p>

<p>The party which the chieftain had described as being in the Muddy
Creek country must have changed their course and hastened to join
Red Feather and the smaller party. If such were the fact, they
would arrive on the spot within a brief space of time.</p>

<p>The interesting question arose whether, in the event of such
arrival, and the attack that was sure to follow, Red Feather would
come out as open defender of the children against his own people.
Had there been only the five original warriors, he might have
played a part something akin to neutrality, on the ground that
his descent of the chimney had turned out ill for him, and, being
caught at disadvantage he was held idle under the threat of instant
death. Still further, it might have been his province to assume
the character of hostage, and thus to defeat the overthrow of
the couple by the Sioux.</p>

<p>But the arrival of the larger party would change everything.
Among the Muddy Creek band were several who disliked Red Feather
intensely enough to be glad of a chance to help his discomfiture.</p>

<p>He had agreed that, in the event of his surprising the lad who
was making such a brave defence, he would immediately appear at
the front window and announce it, after which he would unbar the
door and admit the warriors to the "last scene of all."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Let the Sioux send more of his warriors down
the chimney!'"]</p>

<p>Several minutes had now passed, and no such announcement was
made. The other three Sioux were lingering near the building,
awaiting the signal which came not.</p>

<p>While the two were engaged on the crest of the hill the others
suddenly came round in front of the house. They were on foot,
and looked inquiringly at the windows, as if at a loss to understand
the cause of the silence. Red Feather instantly drew back, and
said in a low voice to Melville&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak to Injin&mdash;dem tink Red Feather lose scalp."</p>

<p>Grasping the situation, the youth showed himself at the window,
where the Sioux were sure to see him, and uttered a tantalizing
shout.</p>

<p>"Let the Sioux send more of their warriors down the chimney!"
he called out; "the white youth is waiting for them, that he may
take their scalps."</p>

<p>This was followed by another shout, as the lad withdrew beyond
reach of a rifle-ball, that left no doubt of its meaning on the
minds of the astounded warriors.</p>
