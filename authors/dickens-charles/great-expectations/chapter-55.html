HE was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been 
immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send 
down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once 
escaped, to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but, Com- 
peyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, 
dead, and it happened that there was not at that time any prison 
officer in London who could give the required evidence. I had gone 
direct to Mr Jaggers at his private house, on my arrival over night, 
to retain his assistance, and Mr Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf 
would admit nothing. It was the sole resource, for he told me that 
the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there, 
and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us. 

<p>I imparted to Mr Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance 
of the fute of his wealth. Mr Jaggers was querulous and angry with 
me for having `let it slip through my fingers,' and said we must 
memorialize by-and-by, and try at all events for some of it. But, he 
did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases 
in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no cir- 
cumstances in this case to make it one of them. I understood that, 
very well. I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with him 
by any recognizable tie; he had put his hand to no writing or settle- 
ment in my favour before his apprehension, and to do so now 
would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved, and ever after- 
wards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never be 
sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one. 

<p>There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned in- 
former had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had ob- 
tained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his 
body was found, many miles from the scene of his death, and so 
horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents 
of his pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case he carried. 
Among these, were the name of a banking-house in New South 
Wales where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain 
lands of considemble value. Both these heads of information were in 
a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr Jaggers, of the 
possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance, poor fel- 
low, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheri- 
tance was quite safe, with Mr Jaggers's aid. 

<p>After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution 
stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, 
the witness came, and completed the easy case. He was committed 
to take his trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a 
month. 

<p>It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one 
evening, a good deal cast down, and said: 

<p>`My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.' 

<p>His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised 
than he thought. 

<p>`We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and 
I am very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need 
me.' 

<p>`Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love 
you; but my need is no greater now, than at another time.' 

<p>`You will be so lonely.' 

<p>`I have not leisure to think of that,' said I. `You know that I am 
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I 
should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away 
from him, you know that my thoughts are with him.' 

<p>The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appall- 
ing to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words. 

<p>`My dear fellow,' said Herbert, `let the near prospect of our 
separation -- for, it is very near -- be my justification for troubling 
you about yourself. Have you thought of your future?' 

<p>`No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.' 

<p>`But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it 
must not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as 
a few friendly words go, with me.' 

<p>`I will,' said I. 

<p>`In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a --' 

<p>I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, 
`A clerk.' 

<p>`A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand 
(as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now, 
Handel -- in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?' 

<p>There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the 
manner in which after saying `Now, Handel,' as if it were the grave 
beginning of a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly 
given up that tone, stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a 
schoolboy . 

<p>`Clara and I have talked about it again and again,' Herbert pur- 
sued, `and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with 
tears in her eyes, to say to you that if you will live with us when we 
come together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to 
convince her husband's friend that he is her friend too. We should 
get on so well, Handel!' 

<p>I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I 
could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. 
Firstly, my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the sub- 
ject clearly. Secondly -- Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something 
lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of 
this slight narrative. 

<p>`But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any 
injury to your business, leave the question open for a little while --' 

<p>`For any while,' cried Herbert. `Six months, a year!' 

<p>`Not so long as that,' said I. `Two or three months at most.' 

<p>Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this 
arrangement, and said he could now take courage to tell me that he 
believed he must go away at the end of the week. 

<p>`And Clara?' said I. 

<p>`The dear little thing,' returned Herbert, `holds dutifully to her 
father as long as he lasts; but he won't last long. Mrs Whimple 
confides to me that he is certainly going.' 

<p>`Not to say an unfeeling thing,' said I, `he cannot do better than 
go. 

<p>`I am afraid that must be admitted,' said Herbert: `and then I 
shall come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing 
and I will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The 
blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never 
looked into the red book, and hasn't a notion about her grand- 
papa. What a fortune for the son of my mother!' 

<p>On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Her bert -- 
full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me -- as he sat on one 
of the seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a 
little note to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to 
her over and over again, and then went to my lonely home -- if it 
deserved the name, for it was now no home to me, and I had no 
home anywhere. 

<p>On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, 
after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had 
not seen him alone, since the disastrous issue of the attempted 
flight; and he had come, in his private and personal capacity, to say 
a few words of explanation in reference to that failure. 

<p>`The late Compeyson,' said Wemmick, `had by little and little 
got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted, 
and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of 
his people being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept 
my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was 
absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the 
attempt. I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as 
a very clever man, habitually to deceive his own instruments. You 
don't blame me, I hope, Mr Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, 
with all my heart.' 

<p>`I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you 
most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.' 

<p>`Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job,' said Wem- 
mick, scratching his head, `and I assure you I haven't been so cut 
up for a long time. What I look at, is the sacrifice of so much port- 
able property. Dear me!' 

<p>`What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.' 

<p>`Yes, to be sure,' said Wemmick. `Of course there can be no ob- 
jection to your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound 
note myself to get him out of it. But what I look at, is this. The late 
Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his 
return, and being so determined to bring him to book, I do not 
think he could have been saved. Whereas, the portable property 
certainly could have been saved. That's the difference between the 
property and the owner, don't you see?' 

<p>I invited Wemmick to come up-stairs, and refresh himself with 
a glass of grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invi- 
tation. While he was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, 
with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather 
fidgety: 

<p>`What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Mon- 
day, Mr Pip?' 

<p>`Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve 
months.' 

<p>`These twelve years, more likely,' said Wemmick. `Yes. I'm 
going to take a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. 
More than that; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me.' 

<p>I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just 
then, when Wemmick anticipated me. 

<p>`I know your engagements,' said he, `and I know you are out of 
sorts, Mr Pip. But if you <I>could</I> oblige me, I should take it as a kind- 
ness. It ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy 
you (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. 
Couldn't you stretch a point and manage it?' 

<p>He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very 
little to do for him. I said I could manage it-- would manage it--and 
he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased 
too. At his particular request, I appointed to call for him at the 
Castle at half-past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for 
the time. 

<p>Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the 
Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick himself: who 
struck me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat 
on. Within, there were two glasses of rum-and-milk prepared, and 
two biscuits. The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, 
glancing into the perspective of his bedroom, I observed that his 
bed was empty. 

<p>When we had fortified ourselves with the rum-and-milk and 
biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training pre- 
paration on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take 
up a fishing-rod, and put it over his shoulder. `Why, we are not 
going fishing! ' said I. `No,' returned Wemmick, `but I like to walk 
with one.' 

<p>I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We 
went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, 
Wemmick said suddenly: 

<p>`Halloa! Here's a church!' 

<p>There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was 
rather surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant 
idea: 

<p>`Let's go in!' 

<p>We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and 
looked all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his 
his coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there. 

<p>`Halloa!' said he. `Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 
'emon!' 

<p>As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was 
widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong sus- 
picions. They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the 
Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady. 

<p>`Halloa!' said Wemmick. `Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a 
wedding.' 

<p>That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was 
now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves, a pair of 
white. The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar 
sacrifice for the altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, ex- 
perienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wem- 
mick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar, 
and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them, 
while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist, that he 
might present an equal and safe resistance. By dint of this ingenious 
scheme, his gloves were got on to perfection. 

<p>The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in 
order at those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all 
without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself as he took 
something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, 
`Halloa! Here's a ring!' 

<p>I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; 
while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a 
feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility 
of giving the lady away, devolved upon the Aged, which led to the 
clergyman's being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened 
thus. When he said, `Who giveth this woman to be married to this 
man?' the old gentlemen, not in the least knowing what point of 
the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at 
the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman said again, 
`WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?' The old 
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, 
the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, `Now Aged P. 
you know; who giveth?' To which the Aged replied with great 
briskness, before saying that <I>he</I> gave, `All right, John, all right, my 
boy!' And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that 
I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely 
married that day. 

<p>It was completely done, however, and when we were going out 
of church, Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white 
gloves in it, and put the cover on again. Mrs Wemmick, more heed- 
ful of the future, put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed 
her green. `<I>Now,</I> Mr Pip,' said Wemmick, triumphantly shoulder- 
ing the fishing-rod as we came out, `let me ask you whether any- 
body would suppose this to be a wedding-party!' 

<p>Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so 
away upon the rising ground beyond the Green; and there was = 
bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend 
our minds after the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs 
Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted 
itself to her figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, 
like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that 
melodious instrument might have done. 

<p>We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined any- 
thing on table, Wemmick said, `Provided by contract, you know; 
don't be afraid of it!' I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, 
drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself 
as agreeable as I could. 

<p>Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook 
hands with him, and wished him joy. 

<p>`Thankee! ' said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. `She's such a 
manager of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and 
judge for yourself. I say, Mr Pip!' calling me back, and speaking 
low. `This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.' 

<p>`I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,' said I. 

<p>Wemmick nodded. `After what you let out the other day, Mr 
Jaggers may as well not know of it. He might think my bmin was 
softening, or something of the kind.'
