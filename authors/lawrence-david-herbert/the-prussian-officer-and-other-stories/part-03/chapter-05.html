<p>In six months' time Miss Mary had married Mr Massy.  There had been
no love-making, nobody had made any remark.  But everybody was
tense and callous with expectation.  When one day Mr Massy asked
for Mary's hand, Mr Lindley started and trembled from the thin,
abstract voice of the little man.  Mr Massy was very nervous, but
so curiously absolute.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be very glad,&quot; said the vicar, &quot;but of course the decision
lies with Mary herself.&quot;  And his still feeble hand shook as he
moved a Bible on his desk.</p>

<p>The small man, keeping fixedly to his idea, padded out of the room
to find Miss Mary.  He sat a long time by her, while she made some
conversation, before he had readiness to speak.  She was afraid of
what was coming, and sat stiff in apprehension.  She felt as if her
body would rise and fling him aside.  But her spirit quivered and
waited.  Almost in expectation she waited, almost wanting him.  And
then she knew he would speak.</p>

<p>&quot;I have already asked Mr Lindley,&quot; said the clergyman, while
suddenly she looked with aversion at his little knees, &quot;if he would
consent to my proposal.&quot;  He was aware of his own disadvantage, but
his will was set.</p>

<p>She went cold as she sat, and impervious, almost as if she had
become stone.  He waited a moment nervously.  He would not persuade
her.  He himself never even heard persuasion, but pursued his own
course.  He looked at her, sure of himself, unsure of her, and
said:</p>

<p>&quot;Will you become my wife, Mary?&quot;</p>

<p>Still her heart was hard and cold.  She sat proudly.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to speak to mama first,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Mr Massy.  And in a moment he padded away.</p>

<p>Mary went to her mother.  She was cold and reserved.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Massy has asked me to marry him, mama,&quot; she said.  Mrs Lindley
went on staring at her book.  She was cramped in her feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, and what did you say?&quot;</p>

<p>They were both keeping calm and cold.</p>

<p>&quot;I said I would speak to you before answering him.&quot;</p>

<p>This was equivalent to a question.  Mrs Lindley did not want to
reply to it.  She shifted her heavy form irritably on the couch.
Miss Mary sat calm and straight, with closed mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Your father thinks it would not be a bad match,&quot; said the mother,
as if casually.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said.  Everybody remained cold and shut-off.  Miss
Mary did not speak to Miss Louisa, the Reverend Ernest Lindley kept
out of sight.</p>

<p>At evening Miss Mary accepted Mr Massy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I will marry you,&quot; she said, with even a little movement of
tenderness towards him.  He was embarrassed, but satisfied.  She
could see him making some movement towards her, could feel the male
in him, something cold and triumphant, asserting itself.  She sat
rigid, and waited.</p>

<p>When Miss Louisa knew, she was silent with bitter anger against
everybody, even against Mary.  She felt her faith wounded.  Did the
real things to her not matter after all?  She wanted to get away.
She thought of Mr Massy.  He had some curious power, some
unanswerable right.  He was a will that they could not controvert. - 
Suddenly a flush started in her.  If he had come to her she would
have flipped him out of the room.  He was never going to touch HER.
And she was glad.  She was glad that her blood would rise and
exterminate the little man, if he came too near to her, no matter
how her judgment was paralysed by him, no matter how he moved in
abstract goodness.  She thought she was perverse to be glad, but
glad she was.  &quot;I would just flip him out of the room,&quot; she said,
and she derived great satisfaction from the open statement.
Nevertheless, perhaps she ought still to feel that Mary, on her
plane, was a higher being than herself.  But then Mary was Mary,
and she was Louisa, and that also was inalterable.</p>

<p>Mary, in marrying him, tried to become a pure reason such as he
was, without feeling or impulse.  She shut herself up, she shut
herself rigid against the agonies of shame and the terror of
violation which came at first.  She WOULD not feel, and she WOULD
not feel.  She was a pure will acquiescing to him.  She elected a
certain kind of fate.  She would be good and purely just, she would
live in a higher freedom than she had ever known, she would be free
of mundane care, she was a pure will towards right.  She had sold
herself, but she had a new freedom.  She had got rid of her body.
She had sold a lower thing, her body, for a higher thing, her
freedom from material things.  She considered that she paid for all
she got from her husband.  So, in a kind of independence, she moved
proud and free.  She had paid with her body: that was henceforward
out of consideration.  She was glad to be rid of it.  She had
bought her position in the world - that henceforth was taken for
granted.  There remained only the direction of her activity towards
charity and high-minded living.</p>

<p>She could scarcely bear other people to be present with her and her
husband.  Her private life was her shame.  But then, she could keep
it hidden.  She lived almost isolated in the rectory of the tiny
village miles from the railway.  She suffered as if it were an
insult to her own flesh, seeing the repulsion which some people
felt for her husband, or the special manner they had of treating
him, as if he were a &quot;case&quot;.  But most people were uneasy before
him, which restored her pride.</p>

<p>If she had let herself, she would have hated him, hated his padding
round the house, his thin voice devoid of human understanding, his
bent little shoulders and rather incomplete face that reminded her
of an abortion.  But rigorously she kept to her position.  She took
care of him and was just to him.  There was also a deep craven fear
of him, something slave-like.</p>

<p>There was not much fault to be found with his behaviour.  He was
scrupulously just and kind according to his lights.  But the male
in him was cold and self-complete, and utterly domineering.  Weak,
insufficient little thing as he was, she had not expected this of
him.  It was something in the bargain she had not understood.  It
made her hold her head, to keep still.  She knew, vaguely, that she
was murdering herself.  After all, her body was not quite so easy
to get rid of.  And this manner of disposing of it - ah, sometimes
she felt she must rise and bring about death, lift her hand for
utter denial of everything, by a general destruction.</p>

<p>He was almost unaware of the conditions about him.  He did not fuss
in the domestic way, she did as she liked in the house.  Indeed,
she was a great deal free of him.  He would sit obliterated for
hours.  He was kind, and almost anxiously considerate.  But when he
considered he was right, his will was just blindly male, like a
cold machine.  And on most points he was logically right, or he had
with him the right of the creed they both accepted.  It was so.
There was nothing for her to go against.</p>

<p>Then she found herself with child, and felt for the first time
horror, afraid before God and man.  This also she had to go
through - it was the right.  When the child arrived, it was a bonny,
healthy lad.  Her heart hurt in her body, as she took the baby
between her hands.  The flesh that was trampled and silent in her
must speak again in the boy.  After all, she had to live - it was
not so simple after all.  Nothing was finished completely.  She
looked and looked at the baby, and almost hated it, and suffered an
anguish of love for it.  She hated it because it made her live
again in the flesh, when she COULD not live in the flesh, she could
not.  She wanted to trample her flesh down, down, extinct, to live
in the mind.  And now there was this child.  It was too cruel, too
racking.  For she must love the child.  Her purpose was broken in
two again.  She had to become amorphous, purposeless, without real
being.  As a mother, she was a fragmentary, ignoble thing.</p>

<p>Mr Massy, blind to everything else in the way of human feeling,
became obsessed by the idea of his child.  When it arrived,
suddenly it filled the whole world of feeling for him.  It was his
obsession, his terror was for its safety and well-being.  It was
something new, as if he himself had been born a naked infant,
conscious of his own exposure, and full of apprehension.  He who
had never been aware of anyone else, all his life, now was aware of
nothing but the child.  Not that he ever played with it, or kissed
it, or tended it.  He did nothing for it.  But it dominated him, it
filled, and at the same time emptied his mind.  The world was all
baby for him.</p>

<p>This his wife must also bear, his question:  &quot;What is the reason
that he cries?&quot; - his reminder, at the first sound:  &quot;Mary, that is
the child,&quot; - his restlessness if the feeding-time were five minutes
past.  She had bargained for this - now she must stand by her
bargain.</p>
