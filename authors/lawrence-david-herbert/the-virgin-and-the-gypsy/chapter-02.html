<p>But it was not until the girls finally came home from school, that
they felt the full weight of Granny's dear old hand on their lives.
Lucille was now nearly twenty-one, and Yvette nineteen.  They had
been to a good girls' school, and had had a finishing year in
Lausanne, and were quite the usual thing, tall young creatures with
fresh, sensitive faces and bobbed hair and young-manly, deuce-take-
it manners.</p>

<p>&quot;What's so awfully BORING about Papplewick,&quot; said Yvette, as they
stood on the Channel boat watching the grey, grey cliffs of Dover
draw near, &quot;is that there are no MEN about.  Why doesn't Daddy have
some good old sports for friends?  As for Uncle Fred, he's the
limit!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you never know what will turn up,&quot; said Lucille, more
philosophic.</p>

<p>&quot;You jolly well know what to expect,&quot; said Yvette.  &quot;Choir on
Sundays, and I hate mixed choirs.  Boys' voices are LOVELY, when
there are no women.  And Sunday School and Girls' Friendly, and
socials, all the dear old souls that enquire after Granny!  Not a
decent young fellow for miles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh I don't know!&quot; said Lucille.  &quot;There's always the Framleys.
And you know Gerry Somercotes ADORES you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh but I HATE fellows who adore me!&quot; cried Yvette, turning up her
sensitive nose.  &quot;They BORE me.  They hang on like lead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well what DO you want, if you can't stand being adored?  <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> think
it's perfectly all right to be adored.  You know you'll never marry
them, so why not let them go on adoring, if it amuses them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh but I WANT to get married,&quot; cried Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;Well in that case, let them go on adoring you till you find one
that you can POSSIBLY marry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never should, that way.  Nothing puts me off like an adoring
fellow.  They BORE me so!  They make me feel beastly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so they do me, if they get pressing.  But at a distance, I
think they're rather nice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to fall VIOLENTLY in love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, very likely!  I shouldn't!  I should hate it.  Probably so
would you, if it actually happened.  After all, we've got to settle
down a bit, before we know what we want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But don't you HATE going back to Papplewick?&quot; cried Yvette,
turning up her young sensitive nose.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not particularly.  I suppose we shall be rather bored.  I wish
Daddy would get a car.  I suppose we shall have to drag the old
bikes out.  Wouldn't you like to get up to Tansy Moor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, LOVE it!  Though it's an awful strain, shoving an old push-
bike up those hills.&quot;</p>

<p>The ship was nearing the grey cliffs.  It was summer, but a grey
day.  The two girls wore their coats with fur collars turned up,
and little chic hats pulled down over their ears.  Tall, slender,
fresh-faced, na&iuml;ve, yet confident, too confident, in their school-
girlish arrogance, they were so terribly English.  They seemed so
free, and were as a matter of fact so tangled and tied up, inside
themselves.  They seemed so dashing and unconventional, and were
really so conventional, so, as it were, shut up indoors inside
themselves.  They looked like bold, tall young sloops, just
slipping from the harbour, into the wide seas of life.  And they
were, as a matter of fact, two poor young rudderless lives, moving
from one chain anchorage to another.</p>

<p>The rectory struck a chill into their hearts as they entered.  It
seemed ugly, and almost sordid, with the dank air of that middle-
class, degenerated comfort which has ceased to be comfortable and
has turned stuffy, unclean.  The hard, stone house struck the girls
as being unclean, they could not have said why.  The shabby
furniture seemed somehow sordid, nothing was fresh.  Even the food
at meals had that awful dreary sordidness which is so repulsive to
a young thing coming from abroad.  Roast beef and wet cabbage, cold
mutton and mashed potatoes, sour pickles, inexcusable puddings.</p>

<p>Granny, who &quot;loved a bit of pork,&quot; also had special dishes, beef-
tea and rusks, or a small savoury custard.  The grey-faced Aunt
Cissie ate nothing at all.  She would sit at table, and take a
single lonely and naked boiled potato on to her plate.  She never
ate meat.  So she sat in sordid durance, while the meal went on,
and Granny quickly slobbered her portion - lucky if she spilled
nothing on her protuberant stomach.  The food was not appetising in
itself: how could it be, when Aunt Cissie hated food herself, hated
the fact of eating, and never could keep a maidservant for three
months.  The girls ate with repulsion, Lucille bravely bearing up,
Yvette's tender nose showing her disgust.  Only the rector, white-
haired, wiped his long grey moustache with his serviette, and
cracked jokes.  He too was getting heavy and inert, sitting in his
study all day, never taking exercise.  But he cracked sarcastic
little jokes all the time, sitting there under the shelter of the
Mater.</p>

<p>The country, with its steep hills and its deep, narrow valleys, was
dark and gloomy, yet had a certain powerful strength of its own.
Twenty miles away was the black industrialism of the north.  Yet
the village of Papplewick was comparatively lonely, almost lost,
the life in it stony and dour.  Everything was stone, with a
hardness that was almost poetic, it was so unrelenting.</p>

<p>It was as the girls had known: they went back into the choir, they
helped in the parish.  But Yvette struck absolutely against Sunday
School, the Band of Hope, the Girls' Friendlies - indeed against all
those functions that were conducted by determined old maids and
obstinate, stupid elderly men.  She avoided church duties as much
as possible, and got away from the rectory whenever she could.  The
Framleys, a big, untidy, jolly family up at the Grange, were an
enormous standby.  And if anybody asked her out to a meal, even if
a woman in one of the workmen's houses asked her to stay to tea,
she accepted at once.  In fact, she was rather thrilled.  She liked
talking to the working men, they had often such fine, hard heads.
But of course they were in another world.</p>

<p>So the months went by.  Gerry Somercotes was still an adorer.
There were others, too, sons of farmers or mill-owners.  Yvette
really ought to have had a good time.  She was always out to
parties and dances, friends came for her in their motor-cars, and
off she went to the city, to the afternoon dance in the chief
hotel, or in the gorgeous new Palais de Danse, called the Pally.</p>

<p>Yet she always seemed like a creature mesmerised.  She was never
free to be quite jolly.  Deep inside her worked an intolerable
irritation, which she thought she OUGHT not to feel, and which she
hated feeling, thereby making it worse.  She never understood at
all whence it arose.</p>

<p>At home, she truly was irritable, and outrageously rude to Aunt
Cissie.  In fact Yvette's awful temper became one of the family by-
words.</p>

<p>Lucille, always more practical, got a job in the city as private
secretary to a man who needed somebody with fluent French and
shorthand.  She went back and forth every day, by the same train as
Uncle Fred.  But she never travelled with him, and wet or fine,
bicycled to the station, while he went on foot.</p>

<p>The two girls were both determined that what they wanted was a
really jolly social life.  And they resented with fury that the
rectory was, for their friends, impossible.  There were only four
rooms downstairs: the kitchen, where lived the two discontented
maid-servants: the dark dining-room: the rector's study: and the
big, &quot;homely,&quot; dreary living-room or drawing-room.  In the dining-
room there was a gas fire.  Only in the living-room was a good hot
fire kept going.  Because of course, here Granny reigned.</p>

<p>In this room the family was assembled.  At evening, after dinner,
Uncle Fred and the rector invariably played crossword puzzles with
Granny.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Mater, are you ready?  N blank blank blank blank W: a Siamese
functionary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?  Eh?  M blank blank blank blank W?&quot;</p>

<p>Granny was hard of hearing.</p>

<p>&quot;No Mater.  Not M!  N blank blank blank blank W: a Siamese
functionary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N blank blank blank blank W: a Chinese functionary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SIAMESE.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SIAMESE!  SIAM!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Siamese functionary!  Now what can that be?&quot; said the old lady
profoundly, folding her hands on her round stomach.  Her two sons
proceeded to make suggestions, at which she said Ah!  Ah!  The
rector was amazingly clever at cross-word puzzles.  But Fred had a
certain technical vocabulary.</p>

<p>&quot;This certainly is a hard nut to crack,&quot; said the old lady, when
they were all stuck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lucille sat in a corner with her hands over her ears,
pretending to read, and Yvette irritably made drawings, or hummed
loud and exasperating tunes, to add to the family concert.  Aunt
Cissie continually reached for a chocolate, and her jaws worked
ceaselessly.  She literally lived on chocolates.  Sitting in the
distance, she put another into her mouth, then looked again at the
parish magazine.  Then she lifted her head, and saw it was time to
fetch Granny's cup of Horlicks.</p>

<p>While she was gone, in nervous exasperation Yvette would open the
window.  The room was never fresh, she imagined it smelt: smelt of
Granny.  And Granny, who was hard of hearing, heard like a weasel
when she wasn't wanted to.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you open the window, Yvette?  I think you might remember there
are older people than yourself in the room,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It's stifling!  It's unbearable!  No wonder we've all of us always
got colds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure the room is large enough, and a good fire burning.&quot;  The
old lady gave a little shudder.  &quot;A draught to give us all our
death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a draught at all,&quot; roared Yvette.  &quot;A breath of fresh air.&quot;</p>

<p>The old lady shuddered again, and said:</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p>The rector, in silence, marched to the window and firmly closed it.
He did not look at his daughter meanwhile.  He hated thwarting her.
But she must know what's what!</p>

<p>The cross-word puzzles, invented by Satan himself, continued till
Granny had had her Horlicks, and was to go to bed.  Then came the
ceremony of Goodnight!  Everybody stood up.  The girls went to be
kissed by the blind old woman.  The rector gave his arm, and Aunt
Cissie followed with a candle.</p>

<p>But this was already nine o'clock, although Granny was really
getting old, and should have been in bed sooner.  But when she was
in bed, she could not sleep, till Aunt Cissie came.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; said Granny, &quot;I have NEVER slept alone.  For fifty-four
years I never slept a night without the Pater's arm round me.  And
when he was gone, I tried to sleep alone.  But as sure as my eyes
closed to sleep, my heart nearly jumped out of my body, and I lay
in a palpitation.  Oh, you may think what you will, but it was a
fearful experience, after fifty-four years of perfect married life!
I would have prayed to be taken first, but the Pater, well, no I
don't think he would have been able to bear up.&quot;</p>

<p>So Aunt Cissie slept with Granny.  And she hated it.  She said SHE
could never sleep.  And she grew greyer and greyer, and the food in
the house got worse, and Aunt Cissie had to have an operation.</p>

<p>But The Mater rose as ever, towards noon, and at the mid-day meal,
she presided from her arm-chair, with her stomach protruding, her
reddish, pendulous face, that had a sort of horrible majesty,
dropping soft under the wall of her high brow, and her blue eyes
peering unseeing.  Her white hair was getting scanty, it was
altogether a little indecent.  But the rector jovially cracked his
jokes to her, and she pretended to disapprove.  But she was
perfectly complacent, sitting in her ancient obesity, and after
meals, getting the wind from her stomach, pressing her bosom with
her hand as she &quot;rifted&quot; in gross physical complacency.</p>

<p>What the girls minded most was that, when they brought their young
friends to the house, Granny always was there, like some awful idol
of old flesh, consuming all the attention.  There was only the one
room for everybody.  And there sat the old lady, with Aunt Cissie
keeping an acrid guard over her.  Everybody must be presented first
to Granny: she was ready to be genial, she liked company.  She had
to know who everybody was, where they came from, every circumstance
of their lives.  And then, when she was au fait, she could get hold
of the conversation.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more exasperating to the girls.  &quot;Isn't old Mrs.
Saywell wonderful!  She takes SUCH an interest in life, at nearly
ninety!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She does take an interest in people's affairs, if that's life,&quot;
said Yvette.</p>

<p>Then she would immediately feel guilty.  After all, it WAS
wonderful to be nearly ninety, and have such a clear mind!  And
Granny never ACTUALLY did anybody any harm.  It was more that she
was in the way.  And perhaps it was rather awful to hate somebody
because they were old and in the way.</p>

<p>Yvette immediately repented, and was nice.  Granny blossomed forth
into reminiscences of when she was a girl, in the little town in
Buckinghamshire.  She talked and talked away, and was SO
entertaining.  She really WAS rather wonderful.</p>

<p>Then in the afternoon Lottie and Ella and Bob Framley came, with
Leo Wetherell.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come in!&quot; - and in they all trooped to the sitting-room, where
Granny, in her white cap, sat by the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Granny, this is Mr. Wetherell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. What-did-you-say?  You must excuse me, I'm a little deaf!&quot;</p>

<p>Granny gave her hand to the uncomfortable young man, and gazed
silently at him, sightlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not from our parish?&quot; she asked him.</p>

<p>&quot;Dinnington!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to go to a picnic tomorrow, to Bonsall Head, in Leo's car.
We can all squeeze in,&quot; said Ella in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you say Bonsall Head?&quot; asked Granny.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a blank silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you say you were going in a car?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!  In Mr. Wetherell's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope he's a good driver.  It's a very dangerous road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a VERY good driver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a very good driver?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!  He IS a very good driver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you go to Bonsall Head, I think I must send a message to Lady
Louth.&quot;</p>

<p>Granny always dragged in this miserable Lady Louth, when there was
company.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we shan't go that way,&quot; cried Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;Which way?&quot; said Granny.  &quot;You must go by Heanor.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole party sat, as Bob expressed it, like stuffed ducks,
fidgeting on their chairs.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie came in - and then the maid with the tea.  There was the
eternal and everlasting piece of bought cake.  Then appeared a
plate of little fresh cakes.  Aunt Cissie had actually sent to the
baker's.</p>

<p>&quot;Tea, Mater!&quot;</p>

<p>The old lady gripped the arms of her chair.  Everybody rose and
stood, while she waded slowly across, on Aunt Cissie's arm, to her
place at table.</p>

<p>During tea Lucille came in from town, from her job.  She was simply
worn out, with black marks under her eyes.  She gave a cry, seeing
all the company.</p>

<p>As soon as the noise had subsided, and the awkwardness was resumed,
Granny said:</p>

<p>&quot;You have never mentioned Mr. Wetherell to me, have you, Lucille?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't remember,&quot; said Lucille.</p>

<p>&quot;You can't have done.  The name is strange to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Yvette absently grabbed another cake, from the now almost empty
plate.  Aunt Cissie, who was driven almost crazy by Yvette's vague
and inconsiderate ways, felt the green rage fuse in her heart.  She
picked up her own plate, on which was the one cake she allowed
herself, and said with vitriolic politeness, offering it to Yvette:</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you have mine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, thanks!&quot; said Yvette, starting in her angry vagueness.  And
with an appearance of the same insouciance, she helped herself to
Aunt Cissie's cake also, adding as an afterthought:  &quot;If you're
sure you don't want it.&quot;</p>

<p>She now had two cakes on her plate.  Lucille had gone white as a
ghost, bending to her tea.  Aunt Cissie sat with a green look of
poisonous resignation.  The awkwardness was an agony.</p>

<p>But Granny, bulkily enthroned and unaware, only said, in the centre
of the cyclone:</p>

<p>&quot;If you are motoring to Bonsall Head tomorrow, Lucille, I wish you
would take a message from me to Lady Louth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Lucille, giving a queer look across the table at the
sightless old woman.  Lady Louth was the King Charles' Head of the
family, invariably produced by Granny for the benefit of visitors.
&quot;Very well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was so very kind last week.  She sent her chauffeur over with
a Cross-word Puzzle book for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you thanked her then,&quot; cried Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to send her a note.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can post it,&quot; cried Lucille.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no!  I should like you to take it.  When Lady Louth called last
time . . .&quot;</p>

<p>The young ones sat like a shoal of young fishes dumbly mouthing at
the surface of the water, while Granny went on about Lady Louth.
Aunt Cissie, the two girls knew, was still helpless, almost
unconscious in a paroxysm of rage about the cake.  Perhaps, poor
thing, she was praying.</p>

<p>It was a mercy when the friends departed.  But by that time the two
girls were both haggard-eyed.  And it was then that Yvette, looking
round, suddenly saw the stony, implacable will-to-power in the old
and motherly-seeming Granny.  She sat there bulging backwards in
her chair, impassive, her reddish, pendulous old face rather
mottled, almost unconscious, but implacable, her face like a mask
that hid something stony, relentless.  It was the static inertia of
her unsavoury power.  Yet in a minute she would open her ancient
mouth to find out every detail about Leo Wetherell.  For the moment
she was hibernating in her oldness, her agedness.  But in a minute
her mouth would open, her mind would flicker awake, and with her
insatiable greed for life, other people's life, she would start on
her quest for every detail.  She was like the old toad which Yvette
had watched, fascinated, as it sat on the ledge of the beehive,
immediately in front of the little entrance by which the bees
emerged, and which, with a demonish lightning-like snap of its
pursed jaws, caught every bee as it came out to launch into the
air, swallowed them one after the other, as if it could consume the
whole hive-full, into its aged, bulging, purse-like wrinkledness.
It had been swallowing bees as they launched into the air of
spring, year after year, year after year, for generations:</p>

<p>But the gardener, called by Yvette, was in a rage, and killed the
creature with a stone.</p>

<p>&quot;'Appen tha ART good for th' snails,&quot; he said, as he came down with
the stone.  &quot;But tha 'rt none goin' ter emp'y th' bee-'ive into thy
guts.&quot;</p>
