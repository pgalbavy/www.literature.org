<p>The Bomb Ketch&mdash;A Terrible Missile&mdash;Frightful Catastrophe &mdash;Diplomacy
in Place of War &mdash;Peace.</p>

<p>Whenever a war is under way a number of persons on each side
are certain to come forward with ingenious schemes for injuring
their opponents, through improvements upon the accepted methods
of conducting hostilities. So it came about, after the slight
success attained in bombarding Tripoli, that a plan was formulated
for creating consternation in the blockaded city and bringing
the defiant Bashaw to his senses.</p>

<p>The new scheme was to fix up the <em>Intrepid</em> as a bomb
ketch, send her into the harbor at night and there explode her.
While a few had no faith in the plan, others believed it would
cause great destruction and spread dismay among the Tripolitans.</p>

<p>In the forward hold were stowed one hundred barrels of gunpowder,
and on the deck above were piled one hundred and fifty shells
and a lot of shot and scrap iron. The plan was to give this floating
volcano the appearance of a blockade-runner. Two small boats were
taken along, to be used by the crews after setting off the fuse
that was to blow the ketch into a million atoms. It will be seen
that the task was of the most dangerous nature conceivable, and
yet when Captain Preble called for volunteers it seemed as if
every one was eager to go.</p>

<p>The command was given to Master-Commandant Richard Somers, who
was of the same age as Decatur and Stewart, and had established
a reputation for coolness and intrepidity in the operations of
the fleet. Midshipman Henry Wadsworth, an uncle of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, the poet, was the second in command. They were accompanied
by another midshipman named Israel, who begged so hard to be allowed
to go that he could not be refused, and ten of the best seamen.</p>

<p>After waiting for several days, the night of September 4 was
found to be just what was desired. A fog lay like a blanket on
the sea, but it was so clear overhead that the stars shone with
brilliant splendor. Before the start was made, Decatur, Stewart
and Somers, all the most intimate of friends, had a long talk
in the cabin of the ketch, no one else being present. Each felt
the gravity of the situation. Somers, though cool and composed,
seemed to feel a presentiment that he would not return. He took
a ring off his finger, and breaking it apart, gave one portion
to Decatur, one to Stewart, and kept the other for himself. He
told his friends what he wished done in case of his death, and
they assured him that every wish should be respected.</p>

<p>During that last impressive interview Stewart asked Somers what
he would do if discovered and attacked by the enemy.</p>

<p>"Blow us all up together!" was the instant response; "I shall
never be taken prisoner."</p>

<p>I may remark here that no writer has recorded this expression
of the gallant Somers, and I give it because Admiral Stewart assured
me of its truth. His recollection of the incident, more than sixty
years afterward, was as vivid as on the succeeding day. Indeed,
Stewart, as is often the case with aged persons, remarked that
his memory of occurrences a half century old was unerring, while
of quite recent incidents it was unreliable.</p>

<p>It was comparatively early in the evening when the ketch got
under way with a favoring breeze. Stewart, with the <em>Siren</em>,
by order of Preble, stood toward the northern passage, through
which the ketch was to pass. His purpose was to remain in as close
as was safe, and hold himself ready to pick up the men as they
returned in their boats. Stewart turned his night glass toward
the <em>Intrepid</em> and watched her slowly fading from sight,
until she melted into the gloom and not the slightest trace of
her outlines was discernible.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more trying than the waiting of the craft outside,
for Somers' own vessel and two small ones were near at hand. The
stillness was so profound that men heard the suppressed breathing
of their comrades. If one moved, he did so on tiptoe. Few words
were spoken, and all in guarded undertones. The rippling of the
water against the prows and cables was an annoyance, and on more
than one forehead great drops of cold perspiration gathered.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully the long minutes wore away, until it seemed
as if several hours had passed, when in reality the interval was
but a small part of that period. Every nerve was in this tense
state, when suddenly the boom of a cannon came rolling through
the fog from the direction of the city, followed soon by the rapid
firing of artillery. The approach of the <em>Intrepid</em> had
been discovered, and it seemed as if all the enemy's batteries
were blazing away at her. But what of the ketch itself?</p>

<p>Stewart, like all the rest, was peering into the black mist,
when he saw a star-like point of light, moving with an up and
down motion, in a horizontal line, showing that it was a lantern
carried by a man running along the deck of a ship. Then it dropped
out of sight, as if the bearer had leaped down a hatchway. For
a moment all was profound darkness, and then an immense fan-like
expanse of flame shot far up into the sky, as if from the crater
of a volcano, and was crossed by the curving streaks of fire made
by shells in their eccentric flight. Across the water came the
crashing roar of the prodigious explosion, followed a few moments
later by the sounds of wreckage and bodies as they dropped into
the sea. Then again impenetrable gloom and profound stillness
succeeded. The batteries on shore were awed into silence by the
awful sight, and the waiting friends on the ships held their breath.</p>

<p>The hope was that Lieutenant Somers and his companions had fired
the fuse and then rowed away in their boats, but as minute followed
minute without the sound of muffled oars from the hollow night
reaching the straining ears, suspense gave way to sickening dread.
The vessels moved to and fro about the entrance, as if the inanimate
things shared in the anxiety that would not allow them to remain
still. At intervals a gun was fired or a rocket sent up to guide
the missing ones, but none appeared. Every man had been killed
by the explosion of the ketch.</p>

<p>Investigations made afterward seemed to establish that Somers
was attacked by three gunboats, and, finding escape impossible,
it was he who ran along the deck, lighted lantern in hand, and
deliberately blew up the <em>Intrepid</em>, destroying not only
himself and companions, but many of the enemy. The mangled remains
of several bodies were found some days later and given burial
on shore, but not one could be recognized. Captain Bainbridge
and some of his brother officers, who were prisoners in Tripoli,
were allowed to view them. He said: "From the whole of them being
so disfigured, it was impossible to recognize any feature known
to us, or even to distinguish an officer from a seaman."</p>

<p>In November, Commodore Samuel Barron arrived, and succeeded Captain
Preble in command of the American squadron. He brought with him
the <em>President</em> and <em>Constellation</em>, thereby increasing
the force to ten vessels, carrying two hundred and sixty-four
guns.</p>

<p>Having failed to bring the Bashaw to terms by force of arms,
the Americans now resorted to what may be termed diplomacy. The
reigning Bashaw of Tripoli was a usurper, having displaced his
elder brother, who had fled to Upper Egypt. He had a good many
friends, who, if they dared, would have been glad to replace him
on his throne. The American consul, who understood all the particulars,
proposed to our government to use the deposed ruler as an instrument
to compel the usurper to make terms. The Government authorized
the consul to go ahead.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he made his way to Alexandria, sought out the banished
ruler, proposed his plan, and it was eagerly accepted. He furnished
the consul with a cavalry escort, enlisted a number of Greek soldiers,
the party marched a thousand miles across the flaming Barcan desert,
and in April appeared before Derne, one of the seaports of the
reigning monarch, who was also advancing upon the place. With
the help of the American fleet, the town was captured, and, for
the first time in its history, the Stars and Stripes were given
to the breeze above a fortification on the eastern side of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>By the enlistment of the mongrel population of the neighborhood,
the American consul gathered a formidable force, with which the
enemy were again defeated. Then they boldly set out for Tripoli.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the usurper was shivering with fear, and was more than
ready to make a treaty of peace with the terrible barbarians from
the other side of the ocean. The treaty was signed on June 2,
1805. The Bashaw, who had demanded a princely sum for the release
of his American prisoners, was now glad to set them free for $60,000.
It was agreed, furthermore, that no more tribute should be paid,
and thus ended all our troubles with Tripoli.</p>

<p>These proceedings left the rightful ruler in the lurch. He had
been promised that he should be restored to his throne on condition
of helping the Americans, and he had given the most valuable sort
of aid, but the treaty declared that no assistance should be given
him. It was a gross injustice on the part of our Government, which
did no special credit to itself, when, after the deposed ruler
had made a pitiful appeal to Congress, that body presented him
with a beggarly pittance of $2,400.</p>
