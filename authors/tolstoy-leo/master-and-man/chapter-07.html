<P>
From the time he had covered himself with the sackcloth and
seated himself behind the sledge, Nikita had not stirred.  Like
all those who live in touch with nature and have known want, he
was patient and could wait for hours, even days, without
growing restless or irritable.  He heard his master call him,
but did not answer because he did not want to move or talk. 
Though he still felt some warmth from the tea he had drunk and
from his energetic struggle when clambering about in the
snowdrift, he knew that this warmth would not last long and
that he had no strength left to warm himself again by moving
about, for he felt as tired as a horse when it stops and
refuses to go further in spite of the whip, and its master sees
that it must be fed before it can work again.  The foot in the
boot with a hole in it had already grown numb, and he could no
longer feel his big toe.  Besides that, his whole body began to
feel colder and colder.
<P>
The thought that he might, and very probably would, die that
night occurred to him, but did not seem particularly unpleasant
or dreadful.  It did not seem particularly unpleasant, because
his whole life had been not a continual holiday, but on the
contrary an unceasing round of toil of which he was beginning
to feel weary.  And it did not seem particularly dreadful,
because besides the masters he had served here, like Vasili
Andreevich, he always felt himself dependent on the Chief
Master, who had sent him into this life, and he knew that when
dying he would still be in that Master's power and would not be
ill-used by Him.  'It seems a pity to give up what one is used
to and accustomed  to.  But there's nothing to be done, I shall
get used to the new things.'
<P>
'Sins?' he thought, and remembered his drunkenness, the money
that had gone on drink, how he had offended his wife, his
cursing, his neglect of church and of the fasts, and all the
things the priest blamed him for at confession. 'Of course they
are sins.  But then, did I take them on of myself?  That's
evidently how God made me.  Well, and the sins?  Where am I to
escape to?'
<P>
So at first he thought of what might happen to him that night,
and then did not return to such thoughts but gave himself up to
whatever recollections came into his head of themselves.  Now
he thought of Martha's arrival, of the drunkenness among the
workers and his own renunciation of drink, then of their
present journey and of Taras's house and the talk about the
breaking-up of the family, then of his own lad, and of Mukhorty
now sheltered under the drugget, and then of his master who
made the sledge creak as he tossed about in it.  'I expect
you're sorry  yourself that you started out, dear man,' he
thought.  'It would seem hard to leave a life such as his! 
It's not like the likes of us.'
<P>
Then all these recollections began to grow confused and got
mixed in his head, and he fell asleep.
<P>
But when Vasili Andreevich, getting on the horse, jerked the
sledge, against the back of which Nikita was leaning, and it
shifted away and hit him in the back with one of its runners,
he awoke and had to change his position whether he liked it or
not.  Straightening his legs with difficulty and shaking the
snow off them he got up, and an agonizing cold immediately
penetrated his whole body.  On making out what was happening he
called to Vasili Andreevich to leave him the drugget which the
horse no longer needed, so that he might wrap himself in it.
<P>
But Vasili Andreevich did not stop, but disappeared amid the
powdery snow.
<P>
Left alone Nikita considered for a moment what he should do. 
He felt that he had not the strength to go off in search of a
house.  It was no longer possible to sit down in his old
place--it was by now all filled with snow.  He felt that he
could not get warmer in the sledge either, for there was
nothing to cover himself with, and his coat and sheepskin no
longer warmed him at all.  He felt as cold as though he had
nothing on but a shirt.  He became frightened. 'Lord, heavenly
Father!' he muttered, and was comforted by the consciousness
that he was not alone but that there was One who heard him and
would not abandon him.  He gave a deep sigh, and keeping the
sackcloth over his head he got inside the sledge and lay down
in the place where his master had been.
<P>
But he could not get warm in the sledge either.  At first he
shivered all over, then the shivering ceased and little by
little he began to lose consciousness.  He did not know whether
he was dying or falling asleep, but felt equally prepared for
the one as for the other.
