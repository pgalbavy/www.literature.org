<p>Up to this stage the two hunters had found no opportunity to
pay much heed to Ned, who had been rescued so narrowly from horrible
cruelty. Tom Hardynge now advanced to where he stood, and thrust
out his hand, his face one broad grin.</p>

<p>"How are ye, my lad? We've had a long tramp for ye, and come
mighty nigh bein' too late."</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> been looking for me?" asked the boy, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we've been on the hunt for some days."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>Dick Morris briefly explained how Colonel Chadmund had received
warning through a friendly Indian runner of the projected massacre
of the cavalry escort. Knowing that it was impossible to forward
reinforcements to them in time, and that Lone Wolf was aiming
specially to get his hands upon his little boy, he had sent Dick
post-haste with orders to intercept Tom, if possible, and both
had been instructed to secure possession of the lad by any possible
means in their power.</p>

<p>After a cautious investigation at the outset, when they arrived
at Devil's Pass, they found that the massacre had taken place
almost twenty-four hours before. The sight was a terrible one,
such as made even them shudder. The horses and soldiers lay scattered
here and there, just as they fell. The beasts of the forest had
offered them no disturbance, probably because there were more
inviting feasts elsewhere. But in the warm summer air the bloody,
hacked faces were discolored and swollen beyond recognition. The
hunters rode carefully along, and counted the whole thirteen,
and when they found the overturned and wrecked ambulance and the
dead horse a short distance beyond they were able to hit the right
theory. It was in this carriage that young Chadmund had been riding
when he was captured, and the scouts set out at once upon the
trail of the Apache war-party.</p>

<p>It was all easy enough to follow the warriors, but Tom and Dick
were hopelessly puzzled when they came up with the redskins, saw
Lone Wolf and his brother warriors, and made the discovery that
the boy was not with them. It was a most trying problem to them&mdash;the
only solution being that they had grown impatient with the boy
and put him to death; and yet, as the trail had been followed
and narrowly watched, it seemed impossible that such a thing should
have taken place without the pursuers finding it out before this.
Dick Morris suggested that the captive, by some providential interference,
had managed to give them the slip, but Tom could not believe it
among the possibilities. If such were the case, there were no
means of learning when or where it had been done, and the scouts
were as completely cut off from pursuit of the boy as were the
Apaches themselves.</p>

<p>In this dilemma there was little to do except to make a general
hunt for him, keeping all the time within striking distance of
the Apaches, as they did not think that the fugitive could have
gotten very far from them. The hunters carefully secreted their
animals, and tramped over the mountains and through ravines, gorges,
and woods, until, on this eventful forenoon they discovered Lone
Wolf ahead of them, acting as though he had detected something
particularly gratifying. The shrewd scouts suspected the truth
on the instant. The Apache was also searching for the lad, and,
guided by a greater knowledge, had discovered him. And so he crouched
down in the rocks, not knowing that two other figures shortly
after crouched behind him. Then, after the story had been told,
as the three moved off together, Dick Morris having picked up
the rifle which Lone Wolf cast from him as the contest was about
to open, Ned Chadmund gave him his version of that terrible attack
and slaughter in Devil's Pass, and of what had followed since.
When he came to explain the clever manner in which he dodged the
Apaches, his listeners were delighted. Dick slapped him upon the
back, and Tom insisted upon shaking hands again. It was a favorite
way the old fellow had of expressing his overwhelming delight
at anything he saw or heard.</p>

<p>"If you'll put yourself under our trainin'," he added, "we'll
make a hunter of ye in the course of a dozen or fifteen years,
more or less."</p>

<p>But Ned had no interest in hunting matters just then. He wanted
to get out of that dangerous neighborhood, and to reach Fort Havens
with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>"How far is it?" he asked, as the trio moved along the trail.</p>

<p>"We can make it in two or three days, I think," said Tom. "Some
parts of the way, though, is rather rough, and it may take us
longer."</p>

<p>"You don't expect to walk it, do you?"</p>

<p>They assured him that they had no intention of doing any such
thing. Their horses were secreted in a gorge about three miles
distant, and as soon as they could be reached they would mount
them and speed away for Fort Havens.</p>

<p>"And we'll do it, too, at a gait that'll beat any mustang that
Lone Wolf has ever straddled," added Dick, exultingly. "When a
chap goes into the Injun country, he must fetch the best hoss
flesh he can steal."</p>

<p>"But I haven't any horse," said Ned, with a laugh. "What's to
become of me when you're riding?"</p>

<p>Tom explained that there could be no difficulty about that. Such
a trifling additional weight would not be suspected by either
of the animals.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose Lone Wolf is?" asked the boy, looking furtively
around, unable to free himself of the belief that they were not
through with him yet.</p>

<p>"He's gone back to his party; they've split since you left 'em.
About thirty started yesterday forenoon for the Apache villages
to the south'ard, and the tother twenty are in camp off here a
mile or so."</p>

<p>As Tom spoke, he pointed to the west, in among the mountains,
and in a direction at right angles to what he was pursuing himself.</p>

<p>"Our road twists round a little," he added, "and when we get
to where we left the animals, we'll be 'bout as far away from
the Apaches as we are now. What's better, there's some mighty
rough travelin' between us and them, such as no hosses can git
over."</p>

<p>"But Indians can, can't they?"</p>

<p>"I rather guess so. What's the matter, my boy?" asked Tom, looking
down upon him as they picked along. "You're talkin' as if you
was thinkin' 'bout Injuns all the time."</p>

<p>"That's what I've had to do for the last three or four days.
Lone Wolf managed to get away from you, and where do you think
he is? What do you think he means to do?"</p>

<p>As the boy asked this question, he glanced around in such a timid,
apprehensive way, that his companions laughed. It was natural
that the lad should have these misgivings, especially as it seemed
to him that his friends were using no precautions at all to prevent
a treacherous surprise upon the part of the Apaches. To relieve
his fears, they convinced him that they were on the alert, and
did not fail to note everything.</p>

<p>They expected, in the natural course of events, that Lone Wolf
would make all haste back to camp, and take every means of revenging
himself and securing possession of the boy again. Indeed, this
was all he could do. He had no rifle with which to fire a stealthy
shot at them, and it was necessary that he should first return
to his warriors before striking a blow. To do all this required
time sufficient to permit the three to reach the gorge, mount
their animals, and get fairly under way before he and his warriors
could possibly put in an appearance. Tom and Dick, therefore,
could not be accused of undue recklessness in taking matters in
such a leisurely fashion. They assured their young friend still
further that they were on the eastern margin of the prairie, and,
after starting with their mustangs, had a clear, open course before
them.</p>

<p>It was somewhat past noon when they entered the ravine, which
had already been described to Ned, and, while the latter remained
to talk with Morris, Tom moved on further and down in a more secluded
place, in quest of their mustangs, which had been left grazing
upon the rich, succulent grass, beside a running stream of mountain
water. All were in high spirits, and our hero was as buoyant and
cheerful as the others, when they saw their friend returning empty-handed.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"The Injuns have stole our mustangs!"</p>

<p>"Sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;plenty of moccasin tracks&mdash;but not cussed sign of a single
hoss," was the sour reply.</p>
