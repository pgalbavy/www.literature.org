<p>At last the friends who had been left on Pearl Island three years
before, and whose hearts had been bowed with despair more than
once, saw the atoll gradually fade from view, until the top of
the tallest palm-tree dipped out of sight in the blue Pacific
and vanished from view forever.</p>

<p>"It seems hardly possible," said Abe Storms, when at last his
straining vision could detect no shadow of the spot, "that we
have been rescued. I'm so full of joy and hope at the prospect
before me that it is hard work to restrain myself from shouting
and jumping overboard."</p>

<p>"What is your idea in jumping overboard?" asked Sanders, with
a laugh, in which Inez Hawthorne joined.</p>

<p>"Merely to give expression to my exuberance of joy; after I should
cool off, I would be cooler, of course."</p>

<p>Captain Bergen, to the grief of his friends, showed no signs
of mental improvement, though his hallucination took a different
form. Instead of being talkative, like he was the day before,
he became reserved, saying nothing to any one, not even to answer
a simple question when it was put to him. He ensconced himself
at the stern in such a position that he was out of the way of
the man with the steering oar, where he curled up like one who
wished neither to be seen nor heard.</p>

<p>"Humor his fancies," said Sanders, "for it will only aggravate
him to notice them. It was the same with Redvignez and Brazzier
that I was speaking about last night."</p>

<p>"Redvignez and Brazzier?" repeated Inez; "where did you ever
see them?"</p>

<p>"I sailed a voyage with them once from Liverpool, and I was telling
Mr. Storms last night that I saw them both so frightened without
cause that their minds were upset for a while. And may I ask whether
you know them?" asked the young man, with a flush of surprise,
addressing the girl.</p>

<p>"Why, they and a negro, Pomp, were the three mutineers who were
the means of our staying on the island. They tried to kill the
captain and mate, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She saved us," broke in Storms, who thereupon gave the narrative
told long ago to the reader, omitting the attempt that was made
upon his own life by cutting the hose-pipes which let the air
down to him, inasmuch as that would have caused the telling of
the pearl fishing also.</p>

<p>Fred Sanders listened with great interest, for he had known the
men well, and it may as well be stated that the danger to which
the scoundrels were exposed, as referred to by him, was that of
being executed for mutiny; and, as it was, the part of Sanders
himself was such that he would have been strung up at the yard-arm
in short order had it not been his extreme youth, which pleaded
in his favor.</p>

<p>Since Storms and his companions had revealed some things that
might have been better concealed, so Fred Sanders himself felt
he had hinted at a little story which was likely to injure his
standing in the eyes of those toward whom he was playing the part
of the good Samaritan.</p>

<p>The proa was arranged as comfortably as possible, Inez Hawthorne
being given a place in front, where a sort of compartment was
made for her, by means of stretching awnings of cocoa-matting
and a portion of the reserve fund of lateen on hand. The others
disposed themselves so that she was left undisturbed whenever
she chose to withdraw to her "state room," as Captain Fred Sanders
facetiously termed it.</p>

<p>The two natives had little to say, and they obeyed orders like
the veritable slaves they were. There could be no doubt they understood
the management of the proa to perfection, and the strange craft
spun through the water with astonishing speed.</p>

<p>Mr. Storms deposited his valise, with its valuable contents,
forward, where he seemed to bestow little attention on it, though,
as may well be supposed, it was ever present in his thoughts,
and quite often in his eye.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of the day they caught sight of sails
in the distance, but approached none; for, as Sanders said, the
all-important thing now was to make the most speed possible, while
the opportunity remained to them. There was a freshening of the
breeze and a haziness which spread through the northern horizon
that caused some misgiving on the part of all, for the proa would
be a poor shelter in case they were overtaken by one of those
terrific tempests they had seen more than once.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon something like a low bank
of clouds appeared to the left, or in the west, which, being scrutinized
through the glasses, proved to be a low-lying island. Sanders
knew of it, and said they passed it still closer on their way
to the atoll.</p>

<p>It was also an atoll like that, but much smaller in size, and,
of course, uninhabited. It might do for a refuge in case of the
coming of a violent storm, while in the vicinity; but otherwise
it would only be a loss of time to pause at it. The fact that
such a place existed so near them caused something like a feeling
of security upon the part of Mate Storms, such as comes over one
on learning he has a good friend at his elbow in face of some
coming trouble.</p>

<p>As the afternoon advanced, and the proa bounded forward before
a strong, steady breeze, Storms thought the occasion a good one
to obtain some sleep, with a view of keeping awake during the
coming night, and he assumed an easy position, where, his mind
being comparatively free from apprehension, he soon sank into
slumber.</p>

<p>This left Inez Hawthorne with no one to talk to excepting Fred
Sanders, who seemed in better spirits than usual. When they had
discussed the voyage, and he had given her as good an account
as he could of the island toward which they were hastening, and
after she had answered all his questions as best she could, she
turned upon him and asked:</p>

<p>"How long did you say you had spent in these islands?"</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can recollect, it is about five years."</p>

<p>"And, as you are now seventeen, you must have been only twelve
years old when you first came here."</p>

<p>"That agrees with my figuring," said Sanders, with a nod of his
head. "You can't be far out of the way."</p>

<p>"Where did you live before that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I lived in a good many places&mdash;that is, for two years.
I was on the Atlantic and on the Pacific and&mdash;well, it would take
me a good long while to tell of all that I passed through. I may
as well own up to you, Inez, that it was a wild, rough life for
a man, even without taking into account the fact that I was a
boy."</p>

<p>"Then you went to sea when you were only ten years old?"</p>

<p>"That also coincides with my mathematical calculations," replied
Sanders, somewhat embarrassed, for he saw they were approaching
delicate ground.</p>

<p>"Then before you were ten years of age?"</p>

<p>"I lived at home, of course."</p>

<p>"And where was that?"</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, Inez, from answering that question. I have
reasons for doing so. Let me say that I stayed at home for the
first ten years of my existence, and was as bad a boy as can be
imagined. I fell into the worst kind of habits, and it was through
the two men &mdash;Redvignez and Brazzier&mdash;whom I've heard you
speak of, that I was persuaded to go to sea with them, when I
ought to have been at home with my father."</p>

<p>"Is your mother living, Mr. Sanders?"</p>

<p>The youth turned his head away, so she could not see his face,
and when he moved it back and spoke again there was a tear on
his cheek, and he replied, in a voice of sadness:</p>

<p>"My mother is in heaven, where her son will never be."</p>

<p>Inez was inexpressibly shocked.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Sanders, what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"A better woman than she never lived, nor a worse boy than I.
You can't understand, Inez. You are too young and too good yourself
to realize what a wretch I was. I deliberately ran away from home
seven years ago, and have never been within a thousand miles of
it since, and I never expected to do so, until within the last
day or so; somehow or other, I've fallen to thinking more than
before."</p>

<p>"Have you a father?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think he is dead, too, for I was enough to break
his heart, and I have never heard of him since. I hadn't any brothers
or sisters when I came away. I'm all that's left, and now there
is a longing coming over me to hunt up my father again before
he dies, that is&mdash;if&mdash;he&mdash;isn't&mdash;already&mdash;gone!"</p>

<p>It was no use. Fred Sanders, the wild, reckless youth, who had
passed through many a scene that would have made a man shudder,
suddenly put his hands to his face, and his whole frame shook
with emotion. The memories of his early childhood came back to
him, and he saw again the forms of those who loved him so fondly,
and whose affection he returned with such piercing ingratitude.
Conscience had slept for many years, but the gentle words of Inez
had awakened its voice again. The goodness of the girl, who was
already like a loved sister to Sanders, had stirred up the better
part of his nature, and he looked upon himself with a shudder,
that one so young as he should have committed his many transgressions.</p>

<p>No wonder that he felt so pressed down that he cried out in the
bitterness of his spirit that heaven was shut from him. It was
hard for Inez to keep back the sympathizing tears herself when
she witnessed the overwhelming grief of the strong youth.</p>

<p>The latter sat silent for some minutes, holding his face partly
averted, as if ashamed of this evidence of weakness&mdash;an evidence
which it is safe to say he had not shown for years, young as he
was.</p>

<p>Ah, there were memories that had slumbered long which came crowding
upon the boy&mdash;memories whose import no one on board that strange
craft could suspect but himself, and whose work was soon to appear
in a form and with a force that neither Inez Hawthorne nor Mate
Storms so much as dreamed of.</p>
