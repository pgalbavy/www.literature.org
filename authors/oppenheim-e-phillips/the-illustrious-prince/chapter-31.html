<P>
The Prince on his return from the library intercepted Penelope on
her way across the hall.
<P>
"Forgive me," he said, "but I could not help overhearing some
sentences of your conversation with Sir Charles Somerfield as we
sat at dinner. You are going to talk with him now, is it not so?"
<P>
"As soon as he comes out from the dining room."
<P>
He saw the hardening of her lips, the flash in her eyes at the
mention of Somerfield's name.
<P>
"Yes!" she continued, "Sir Charles and I are going to have a
little understanding."
<P>
"Are you sure," he asked softly, "that it will not be a
misunderstanding?"
<P>
She looked into his face.
<P>
"What does it matter to you?" she asked. "What do you care?"
<P>
"Come into the conservatory for a few minutes," he begged. You
know that I take no wine and I prefer not to return into the
dining room. I would like so much instead to talk to you before
you see Sir Charles."
<P>
She hesitated. He stood by her side patiently waiting.
<P>
"Remember," he said, "that I am a somewhat privileged person just
now. My days here are numbered, you see."
<P>
She turned toward the conservatories.
<P>
"Very well," she said, "I must be like every one else, I suppose,
and spoil you. How dare you come and make us all so fond of you
that we look upon your departure almost as a tragedy!"
<P>
He smiled.
<P>
"Indeed," he declared, "there is a note of tragedy even in these
simplest accidents of life. I have been very happy amongst you
all, Miss Penelope. You have been so much kinder to me than I
have deserved. You have thrown a bridge across the gulf which
separates us people of alien tongues and alien manners. Life has
been a pleasant thing for me here."
<P>
"Why do you go so soon?" she whispered.
<P>
"Miss Penelope," he answered, "to those others who ask me that
question, I shall say that my mission is over, that my report has
been sent to my Emperor, and that there is nothing left for me to
do but to follow it home. I could add, and it would be true, that
there is very much work for me still to accomplish in my own
country. To you alone I am going to say something else."
<P>
She was no longer pale. Her eyes were filled with an exceedingly
soft light. She leaned towards him, and her face shone as the
face of a woman who prays that she may hear the one thing in life
a woman craves to hear from the lips she loves best.
<P>
"Go on," she murmured.
<P>
"I want to ask you, Miss Penelope," he continued, "whether you
remember the day when you paid a visit to my house?"
<P>
"Very well," she answered.
<P>
"I was showing you a casket," he went on.
<P>
She gripped his arm.
<P>
"Don't!" she begged. "Don't, I can't bear any more of that. You
don't know how horrible it seems to me! You don't know--what
fears I have had!"
<P>
He looked away from her.
<P>
"I have sometimes wondered," he said, "what your thoughts were at
that moment, what you have thought of me since."
<P>
She shivered a little, but did not answer him.
<P>
"Very soon," he reminded her, "I shall have passed out of your
life."
<P>
He heard the sudden, half-stifled exclamation. He felt rather
than saw the eyes which pleaded with him, and he hastened on.
<P>
"You understand what is meant by the inevitable," he continued.
"Whatever has happened in the matters with which I have been
concerned has been inevitable. I have had no choice--sometimes no
choice in such events is possible. Do not think," he went on,
"that I tell you this to beg for your sympathy. I would not have
a thing other than as it is. But when we have said goodbye, I
want you to believe the best of me, to think as kindly as you can
of the things which you may not be able to comprehend.  Remember
that we are not so emotional a nation as that to which you
belong. Our affections are but seldom touched. We live without
feeling for many days, sometimes for longer, even, than many
days. It has not been so altogether with me. I have felt more
than I dare, at this moment, to speak of."
<P>
"Yet you go," she murmured.
<P>
"Yet I go," he assented. "Nothing in the world is more certain
than that I must say farewell to you and all of my good friends
here. In a sense I want this to be our farewell. Leaving out of
the question just now the more serious dangers which threaten me,
the result of my mission here alone will make me unpopular in
this country. As the years pass, I fear that nothing can draw
your own land and mine into any sort of accord. That is why I
asked you to come here with me and listen while I said these few
words to you, why I ask you now that, whatever the future may
bring, you will sometimes spare me a kindly thought."
<P>
"I think you know," she answered, "that you need not ask that."
<P>
"You will marry Sir Charles Somerfield," he continued, "and you
will be happy. In this country men develop late. Somerfield, too,
will develop, I am sure. He will become worthy even, I trust, to
be your husband, Miss Penelope. Something was said of his going
into Parliament. When he is Foreign Minister and I am the
Counsellor of the Emperor, we may perhaps send messages to one
another, if not across the seas, through the clouds."
<P>
A man's footstep approached them. Somerfield himself drew near
and hesitated. The Prince rose at once.
<P>
"Sir Charles," he said, "I have been bidding farewell to Miss
Penelope. I have had news tonight over the telephone and I find
that I must curtail my visit."
<P>
"The Duke will be disappointed," Somerfield said. "Are you off at
once?"
<P>
"Probably tomorrow," the Prince answered. "May I leave Miss
Penelope in your charge?" he added with a little bow. "The Duke,
I believe, is awaiting me."
<P>
He passed out of the conservatory. Penelope sat quite still.
<P>
"Well," Somerfield said, "if he is really going--"
<P>
"Charlie," she interrupted, "if ever you expect me to marry you,
I make one condition, and that is that you never say a single
word against Prince Maiyo."
<P>
"The man whom a month ago," he remarked curiously, "you hated!"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"I was an idiot," she said. "I did not understand him and I was
prejudiced against his country."
<P>
"Well, as he actually is going away," Sir Charles remarked with a
sigh of content, "I suppose it's no use being jealous."
<P>
"You haven't any reason to be," Penelope answered just a little
wistfully. "Prince Maiyo has no room in his life for such
frivolous creatures as women."
<P>
The Prince found the rest of the party dispersed in various
directions. Lady Grace was playing billiards with Captain Wilmot.
She showed every disposition to lay down her cue when he entered
the room.
<P>
"Do come and talk to us, Prince," she begged. "I am so tired of
this stupid game, and I am sure Captain Wilmot is bored to
tears."
<P>
The Prince shook his head.
<P>
"Thank you," he said, "but I must find the Duke. I have just
received a telephone message and I fear that I may have to leave
tomorrow."
<P>
"Tomorrow!" she cried in dismay.
<P>
The Prince sighed.
<P>
"If not tomorrow, the next day," he answered. "I have had a
summons--a summons which I cannot disobey. Shall I find your
father in the library, Lady Grace?"
<P>
"Yes!" she answered. "He is there with Mr. Haviland and Sir
Edward. Are you really going to waste your last evening in
talking about treaties and such trifles?"
<P>
"I am afraid I must," he answered regretfully.
<P>
You are a hopelessly disappointing person," she declared a little
pitifully.
<P>
"It is because you are all much too kind to me that you think
so," he answered. "You make me welcome amongst you even as one of
yourselves. You forget--you would almost teach me to forget that
I am only a wayfarer here."
<P>
"That is your own choice," she said, coming a little nearer to
him.
<P>
"Ah, no," he answered. "There is no choice! I serve a great
mistress, and when she calls I come. There are no other voices in
the world for one of my race and faith. The library you said,
Lady Grace? I must go and find your father."
<P>
He passed out, closing the door behind him. Captain Wilmot
chalked his cue carefully.
<P>
"That's the queerest fellow I ever knew in my life," he said. "He
seems all the time as though his head were in the clouds."
<P>
Lady Grace sighed. She too was chalking her cue.
<P>
"I wonder," she said, "what it would be like to live in the
clouds."
