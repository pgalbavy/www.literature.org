"An egg," says Jimmy Skunk, "is good;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very good indeed to eat."<br/>
"An egg," says Mrs. Grouse, "is dear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill hatch into a baby sweet."

<p>So in the matter of eggs, as in a great many other matters, it
all depends on the point of view. To Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy
Possum eggs are looked on from the viewpoint of something to eat.
Their stomachs prompt them to think of eggs. Eggs are good to
fill empty stomachs. The mere thought of eggs will make Jimmy
and Unc' Billy smack their lips. They say they "love" eggs, but
they don't. They "like" them, which is quite different.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Grouse and most of the other feathered people of the
Green Forest and the Green Meadows and the Old Orchard really
do "love" eggs. It is the heart instead of the stomach that responds
to the thought of eggs. To them eggs are almost as precious as
babies, because they know that some day, some day very soon, those
eggs will become babies. There are a few feathered folks, I am
sorry to say, who "love" their own eggs, but "like" the eggs of
other people&mdash;like them just as Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy Possum
do, to eat. Blacky the Crow is one and his cousin, Sammy Jay,
is another.</p>

<p>So in the springtime there is always a great deal of matching
of wits between the little people of the Green Forest and the
Green Meadows and the Old Orchard. Those who have eggs try to
keep them a secret or to build the nests that hold them where
none who like to eat them can get them; and those who have an
appetite for eggs try to find them.</p>

<p>When Unc' Billy Possum suddenly changed the subject by asking
Jimmy Skunk if he had found any nice fresh eggs lately, he touched
a subject very close to Jimmy's heart. I should have said, rather,
his stomach. To tell the truth, it was a longing for some eggs
that had brought Jimmy to the Green Forest. He knew that somewhere
there Mrs. Grouse must be hiding a nestful of the very nicest
of eggs, and it was to hunt for these that he had come.</p>

<p>"No," replied Jimmy, "I haven't had any luck at all this spring.
I've almost forgotten what an egg tastes like. Either I'm growing
dull and stupid, or some folks are smarter than they used to be.
By the way, have you seen Mrs. Grouse lately?" Jimmy looked very
innocent as he asked this.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy chuckled until his sides shook. "Do yo' suppose Ah'd
tell yo' if Ah had?" he demanded. "Ah reckons Mrs. Grouse hasn't
got any mo' aiggs than Ah could comfortably take care of mahself,
not to mention Mrs. Possum." Here Unc' Billy looked back over
his shoulder to make sure that old Mrs. Possum wasn't within hearing,
and Jimmy Skunk chuckled. "Seems to me, Brer Skunk, yo' might
better do your aigg hunting on the Green Meadows and leave the
Green Forest to me," continued Unc' Billy. "That would be no mo'
than fair. Yo' know Ah never did hanker fo' to get far away from
trees, but yo' don't mind. Besides there are mo' aiggs for yo'
to find on the Green Meadows than there are fo' me to find in
the Green Forest. A right smart lot of birds make their nests
on the ground there. There is Brer Bob White and Brer Meadowlark
and Brer Bobolink and Brer Field Sparrow and Brer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind any more, Unc' Billy," interrupted Jimmy Skunk. "I
know all about them. That is, I know all about them I want to
know, except where their eggs are. Didn't I just tell you I haven't
had any luck at all? That's why I'm over here."</p>

<p>"Well, yo' won't have any mo' luck here unless yo' are a right
smart lot sharper than your Unc' Billy, and when it comes to hunting
aiggs, Ah don't take mah hat off to anybody, not even to yo',
Brer Skunk," replied Unc' Billy.</p>
