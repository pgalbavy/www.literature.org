<P>
The steaks we had that night, and they were fine; and the
following morning we tasted the broth.  It seemed odd to be
eating a creature that should, by all the laws of paleontology,
have been extinct for several million years.  It gave one a
feeling of newness that was almost embarrassing, although it
didn't seem to embarrass our appetites.  Olson ate until I
thought he would burst.
<P>
The girl ate with us that night at the little officers' mess just
back of the torpedo compartment.  The narrow table was unfolded;
the four stools were set out; and for the first time in days we
sat down to eat, and for the first time in weeks we had something
to eat other than the monotony of the short rations of an
impoverished U-boat.  Nobs sat between the girl and me and was
fed with morsels of the Plesiosaurus steak, at the risk of
forever contaminating his manners.  He looked at me sheepishly
all the time, for he knew that no well-bred dog should eat at
table; but the poor fellow was so wasted from improper food that
I couldn't enjoy my own meal had he been denied an immediate share
in it; and anyway Lys wanted to feed him.  So there you are.
<P>
Lys was coldly polite to me and sweetly gracious to Bradley
and Olson.  She wasn't of the gushing type, I knew; so I didn't
expect much from her and was duly grateful for the few morsels of
attention she threw upon the floor to me.  We had a pleasant
meal, with only one unfortunate occurrence--when Olson suggested
that possibly the creature we were eating was the same one that
ate the German.  It was some time before we could persuade the
girl to continue her meal, but at last Bradley prevailed upon
her, pointing out that we had come upstream nearly forty miles
since the boche had been seized, and that during that time we
had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the river,
indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the
same Plesiosaur.  "And anyway," he concluded, "it was only a
scheme of Mr. Olson's to get all the steaks for himself."
<P>
We discussed the future and ventured opinions as to what lay
before us; but we could only theorize at best, for none of
us knew.  If the whole land was infested by these and similar
horrid monsters, life would be impossible upon it, and we decided
that we would only search long enough to find and take aboard fresh
water and such meat and fruits as might be safely procurable and
then retrace our way beneath the cliffs to the open sea.
<P>
And so at last we turned into our narrow bunks, hopeful, happy
and at peace with ourselves, our lives and our God, to awaken the
following morning refreshed and still optimistic.  We had an easy
time getting away--as we learned later, because the saurians do
not commence to feed until late in the morning.  From noon to
midnight their curve of activity is at its height, while from
dawn to about nine o'clock it is lowest.  As a matter of fact, we
didn't see one of them all the time we were getting under way,
though I had the cannon raised to the deck and manned against
an assault.  I hoped, but I was none too sure, that shells might
discourage them.  The trees were full of monkeys of all sizes and
shades, and once we thought we saw a manlike creature watching us
from the depth of the forest.
<P>
Shortly after we resumed our course upstream, we saw the mouth of
another and smaller river emptying into the main channel from the
south--that is, upon our right; and almost immediately after we
came upon a large island five or six miles in length; and at
fifty miles there was a still larger river than the last coming
in from the northwest, the course of the main stream having now
changed to northeast by southwest.  The water was quite free from
reptiles, and the vegetation upon the banks of the river had
altered to more open and parklike forest, with eucalyptus and
acacia mingled with a scattering of tree ferns, as though two
distinct periods of geologic time had overlapped and merged.
The grass, too, was less flowering, though there were still
gorgeous patches mottling the greensward; and lastly, the fauna
was less multitudinous.
<P>
Six or seven miles farther, and the river widened considerably;
before us opened an expanse of water to the farther horizon, and
then we sailed out upon an inland sea so large that only a shore-
line upon our side was visible to us.  The waters all about us
were alive with life.  There were still a few reptiles; but there
were fish by the thousands, by the millions.
<P>
The water of the inland sea was very warm, almost hot, and the
atmosphere was hot and heavy above it.  It seemed strange that
beyond the buttressed walls of Caprona icebergs floated and the
south wind was biting, for only a gentle breeze moved across
the face of these living waters, and that was damp and warm.
Gradually, we commenced to divest ourselves of our clothing,
retaining only sufficient for modesty; but the sun was not hot.
It was more the heat of a steam-room than of an oven.
<P>
We coasted up the shore of the lake in a north-westerly direction,
sounding all the time.  We found the lake deep and the bottom
rocky and steeply shelving toward the center, and once when I
moved straight out from shore to take other soundings we could
find no bottom whatsoever.  In open spaces along the shore we
caught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs, and here
they appeared only a trifle less precipitous than those which
bound Caprona on the seaward side.  My theory is that in a far
distant era Caprona was a mighty mountain--perhaps the world's
mightiest volcanic action blew off the entire crest, blew
thousands of feet of the mountain upward and outward and onto the
surrounding continent, leaving a great crater; and then,
possibly, the continent sank as ancient continents have been
known to do, leaving only the summit of Caprona above the sea.
The encircling walls, the central lake, the hot springs which
feed the lake, all point to a conclusion, and the fauna and the
flora bear indisputable evidence that Caprona was once part of
some great land-mass.
<P>
As we cruised up along the coast, the landscape continued a more
or less open forest, with here and there a small plain where we
saw animals grazing.  With my glass I could make out a species of
large red deer, some antelope and what appeared to be a species
of horse; and once I saw the shaggy form of what might have been
a monstrous bison.  Here was game a plenty!  There seemed little
danger of starving upon Caprona.  The game, however, seemed wary;
for the instant the animals discovered us, they threw up their
heads and tails and went cavorting off, those farther inland
following the example of the others until all were lost in the
mazes of the distant forest.  Only the great, shaggy ox stood
his ground.  With lowered head he watched us until we had passed,
and then continued feeding.
<P>
About twenty miles up the coast from the mouth of the river we
encountered low cliffs of sandstone, broken and tortured evidence
of the great upheaval which had torn Caprona asunder in the past,
intermingling upon a common level the rock formations of widely
separated eras, fusing some and leaving others untouched.
<P>
We ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles, arriving off
a broad cleft which led into what appeared to be another lake.
As we were in search of pure water, we did not wish to overlook
any portion of the coast, and so after sounding and finding that
we had ample depth, I ran the U-33 between head-lands into as
pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care to see, with
good water right up to within a few yards of the shore.  As we
cruised slowly along, two of the boches again saw what they
believed to be a man, or manlike creature, watching us from a
fringe of trees a hundred yards inland, and shortly after we
discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying into the bay:
It was the first stream we had found since leaving the river, and
I at once made preparations to test its water.  To land, it would
be necessary to run the U-33 close in to the shore, at least as
close as we could, for even these waters were infested, though,
not so thickly, by savage reptiles.  I ordered sufficient water
let into the diving-tanks to lower us about a foot, and then I
ran the bow slowly toward the shore, confident that should we run
aground, we still had sufficient lifting force to free us when
the water should be pumped out of the tanks; but the bow nosed
its way gently into the reeds and touched the shore with the keel
still clear.
<P>
My men were all armed now with both rifles and pistols, each
having plenty of ammunition.  I ordered one of the Germans ashore
with a line, and sent two of my own men to guard him, for from
what little we had seen of Caprona, or Caspak as we learned later
to call the interior, we realized that any instant some new and
terrible danger might confront us.  The line was made fast to a
small tree, and at the same time I had the stern anchor dropped.
<P>
As soon as the boche and his guard were aboard again, I called
all hands on deck, including von Schoenvorts, and there I
explained to them that the time had come for us to enter into
some sort of an agreement among ourselves that would relieve
us of the annoyance and embarrassment of being divided into two
antagonistic parts--prisoners and captors.  I told them that it
was obvious our very existence depended upon our unity of action,
that we were to all intent and purpose entering a new world as
far from the seat and causes of our own world-war as if millions
of miles of space and eons of time separated us from our past
lives and habitations.
<P>
"There is no reason why we should carry our racial and political
hatreds into Caprona," I insisted.  "The Germans among us might
kill all the English, or the English might kill the last German,
without affecting in the slightest degree either the outcome of
even the smallest skirmish upon the western front or the opinion
of a single individual in any belligerent or neutral country.
I therefore put the issue squarely to you all; shall we bury our
animosities and work together with and for one another while we
remain upon Caprona, or must we continue thus divided and but half
armed, possibly until death has claimed the last of us?  And let
me tell you, if you have not already realized it, the chances are
a thousand to one that not one of us ever will see the outside
world again.  We are safe now in the matter of food and water; we
could provision the U-33 for a long cruise; but we are practically
out of fuel, and without fuel we cannot hope to reach the ocean,
as only a submarine can pass through the barrier cliffs.  What is
your answer?" I turned toward von Schoenvorts.
<P>
He eyed me in that disagreeable way of his and demanded to know,
in case they accepted my suggestion, what their status would be
in event of our finding a way to escape with the U-33.  I replied
that I felt that if we had all worked loyally together we should
leave Caprona upon a common footing, and to that end I suggested
that should the remote possibility of our escape in the submarine
develop into reality, we should then immediately make for the
nearest neutral port and give ourselves into the hands of the
authorities, when we should all probably be interned for the
duration of the war.  To my surprise he agreed that this was fair
and told me that they would accept my conditions and that I could
depend upon their loyalty to the common cause.
<P>
I thanked him and then addressed each one of his men individually,
and each gave me his word that he would abide by all that I
had outlined.  It was further understood that we were to act as
a military organization under military rules and discipline--I
as commander, with Bradley as my first lieutenant and Olson as
my second, in command of the Englishmen; while von Schoenvorts
was to act as an additional second lieutenant and have charge of
his own men.  The four of us were to constitute a military court
under which men might be tried and sentenced to punishment for
infraction of military rules and discipline, even to the passing
of the death-sentence.
<P>
I then had arms and ammunition issued to the Germans, and leaving
Bradley and five men to guard the U-33, the balance of us went ashore.
The first thing we did was to taste the water of the little stream--
which, to our delight, we found sweet, pure and cold.  This stream
was entirely free from dangerous reptiles, because, as I later
discovered, they became immediately dormant when subjected to a much
lower temperature than 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  They dislike cold water
and keep as far away from it as possible.  There were countless
brook-trout here, and deep holes that invited us to bathe, and along
the bank of the stream were trees bearing a close resemblance to
ash and beech and oak, their characteristics evidently induced by
the lower temperature of the air above the cold water and by the
fact that their roots were watered by the water from the stream
rather than from the warm springs which we afterward found in such
abundance elsewhere.
<P>
Our first concern was to fill the water tanks of the U-33 with
fresh water, and that having been accomplished, we set out to
hunt for game and explore inland for a short distance.  Olson, von
Schoenvorts, two Englishmen and two Germans accompanied me,
leaving ten to guard the ship and the girl.  I had intended
leaving Nobs behind, but he got away and joined me and was so
happy over it that I hadn't the heart to send him back.  We followed
the stream upward through a beautiful country for about five miles,
and then came upon its source in a little boulder-strewn clearing.
From among the rocks bubbled fully twenty ice-cold springs.
North of the clearing rose sandstone cliffs to a height of some
fifty to seventy-five feet, with tall trees growing at their base
and almost concealing them from our view.  To the west the country
was flat and sparsely wooded, and here it was that we saw our first
game--a large red deer.  It was grazing away from us and had not
seen us when one of my men called my attention to it.  Motioning for
silence and having the rest of the party lie down, I crept toward
the quarry, accompanied only by Whitely.  We got within a hundred
yards of the deer when he suddenly raised his antlered head and
pricked up his great ears.  We both fired at once and had the
satisfaction of seeing the buck drop; then we ran forward to finish
him with our knives.  The deer lay in a small open space close to
a clump of acacias, and we had advanced to within several yards
of our kill when we both halted suddenly and simultaneously.
Whitely looked at me, and I looked at Whitely, and then we both
looked back in the direction of the deer.
"Blime!' he said.  "Wot is hit, sir?"
<P>
"It looks to me, Whitely, like an error," I said; "some assistant
god who had been creating elephants must have been temporarily
transferred to the lizard-department."
<P>
"Hi wouldn't s'y that, sir," said Whitely; "it sounds blasphemous."
<P>
"It is more blasphemous than that thing which is swiping our
meat," I replied, for whatever the thing was, it had leaped upon
our deer and was devouring it in great mouthfuls which it
swallowed without mastication.  The creature appeared to be a
great lizard at least ten feet high, with a huge, powerful tail
as long as its torso, mighty hind legs and short forelegs.  When it
had advanced from the wood, it hopped much after the fashion of a
kangaroo, using its hind feet and tail to propel it, and when it
stood erect, it sat upon its tail.  Its head was long and thick,
with a blunt muzzle, and the opening of the jaws ran back to a
point behind the eyes, and the jaws were armed with long sharp teeth.
The scaly body was covered with black and yellow spots about a foot
in diameter and irregular in contour.  These spots were outlined in
red with edgings about an inch wide.  The underside of the chest,
body and tail were a greenish white.
<P>
"Wot s'y we pot the bloomin' bird, sir?" suggested Whitely.
<P>
I told him to wait until I gave the word; then we would fire
simultaneously, he at the heart and I at the spine.
<P>
"Hat the 'eart, sir--yes, sir," he replied, and raised his piece
to his shoulder.
<P>
Our shots rang out together.  The thing raised its head and
looked about until its eyes rested upon us; then it gave vent to
a most appalling hiss that rose to the crescendo of a terrific
shriek and came for us.
<P>
"Beat it, Whitely!" I cried as I turned to run.
<P>
We were about a quarter of a mile from the rest of our party, and
in full sight of them as they lay in the tall grass watching us.
That they saw all that had happened was evidenced by the fact that
they now rose and ran toward us, and at their head leaped Nobs.
The creature in our rear was gaining on us rapidly when Nobs flew
past me like a meteor and rushed straight for the frightful reptile.
I tried to recall him, but he would pay no attention to me, and as
I couldn't see him sacrificed, I, too, stopped and faced the monster.
The creature appeared to be more impressed with Nobs than by us and
our firearms, for it stopped as the Airedale dashed at it growling,
and struck at him viciously with its powerful jaws.
<P>
Nobs, though, was lightning by comparison with the slow thinking
beast and dodged his opponent's thrust with ease.  Then he raced
to the rear of the tremendous thing and seized it by the tail.
There Nobs made the error of his life.  Within that mottled organ
were the muscles of a Titan, the force of a dozen mighty
catapults, and the owner of the tail was fully aware of the
possibilities which it contained.  With a single flip of the tip
it sent poor Nobs sailing through the air a hundred feet above
the ground, straight back into the clump of acacias from which
the beast had leaped upon our kill--and then the grotesque thing
sank lifeless to the ground.
<P>
Olson and von Schoenvorts came up a minute later with their men;
then we all cautiously approached the still form upon the ground.
The creature was quite dead, and an examination resulted in
disclosing the fact that Whitely's bullet had pierced its heart,
and mine had severed the spinal cord.
<P>
"But why didn't it die instantly?" I exclaimed.
<P>
"Because," said von Schoenvorts in his disagreeable way, "the
beast is so large, and its nervous organization of so low a
caliber, that it took all this time for the intelligence of death
to reach and be impressed upon the minute brain.  The thing was
dead when your bullets struck it; but it did not know it for
several seconds--possibly a minute.  If I am not mistaken, it is
an Allosaurus of the Upper Jurassic, remains of which have been
found in Central Wyoming, in the suburbs of New York."
<P>
An Irishman by the name of Brady grinned.  I afterward learned
that he had served three years on the traffic-squad of the
Chicago police force.
<P>
I had been calling Nobs in the meantime and was about to set out
in search of him, fearing, to tell the truth, to do so lest I
find him mangled and dead among the trees of the acacia grove,
when he suddenly emerged from among the boles, his ears flattened,
his tail between his legs and his body screwed into a suppliant S.
He was unharmed except for minor bruises; but he was the most
chastened dog I have ever seen.
<P>
We gathered up what was left of the red deer after skinning and
cleaning it, and set out upon our return journey toward the U-boat.
On the way Olson, von Schoenvorts and I discussed the needs of our
immediate future, and we were unanimous in placing foremost the
necessity of a permanent camp on shore.  The interior of a U-boat
is about as impossible and uncomfortable an abiding-place as one
can well imagine, and in this warm climate, and in warm water, it
was almost unendurable.  So we decided to construct a palisaded camp.
