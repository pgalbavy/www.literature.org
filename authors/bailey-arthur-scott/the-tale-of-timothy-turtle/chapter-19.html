<p>Somebody had knocked. And with a wide smile upon his face Mr. Ferdinand
Frog, the tailor, went to his door and peeped out.
</p>
<p>One look was enough. He shut the door again with great haste and barred
it. And he held one hand over his heart, as if he had just received a
terrible fright.
</p><p>"Let me in!" somebody called. The tailor knew that it was Timothy
Turtle's voice, for he had seen that crusty old person standing upon his
doorstep.
</p><p>"Go away!" Mr. Frog replied. "I'm not here."
</p><p>He was an odd chap--this Ferdinand Frog. One never could tell what he
was going to do--or say.
</p><p>"Yes, you are!" Timothy Turtle insisted. "I saw you only a moment ago."
</p><p>The tailor then peered out of the window at his caller.
</p><p>"There you are now!" Timothy shouted, as he caught sight of Mr. Frog. "I
say, let me in!"
</p><p>"I can't," Mr. Frog answered. "I'm sick a-bed."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" Timothy cried.
</p><p>"Well, I expect I'll be ill if you don't go away," the tailor answered.
"I'm having a nervous chill this very moment."
</p><p>He was afraid of Timothy Turtle. And it was no wonder. For Timothy had
tried, more than once to make a meal of the nimble Mr. Frog.
</p><p>"I haven't come here to hurt you," Timothy Turtle explained, trying to
smile at the face in the window. "I want you to make me a new coat--a
big one that will cover my back all over."
</p><p>To his great disappointment Mr. Frog shook his head with great force.
</p><p>"I'm not interested," he announced.
</p><p>"Do you mean"--Timothy Turtle faltered--"do you mean that you won't make
a coat for me?"
</p><p>"Exactly!"
</p><p>"Why?" Timothy pressed him.
</p><p>"Too busy!" was Mr. Frog's answer.
</p><p>"Who is?"
</p><p>"You are!" said Mr. Frog. "Ever since I've known you, you've been trying
to catch me and my friends."
</p><p>"Why--er--I was only joking," Timothy Turtle told him. "You mustn't mind
my playful ways. Just make me a coat and I'll do something handsome for
you."
</p><p>It was now the tailor's turn to ask questions.
</p><p>"What"--he inquired--"what will you do?"
</p><p>"I couldn't just say at this moment," Timothy replied.
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"Oh, I'd want to think a while," said Timothy Turtle.
</p><p>"Very well!" was the tailor's answer. "I've no objection, though it's
something I never do myself."
</p><p>"I wish you'd come outside a moment, since you don't want me inside your
shop," Timothy remarked. "I'd like to whisper to you."
</p><p>"I'm deaf," Mr. Frog informed him. "I couldn't hear a single word, even
if you were to shout your head off."
</p><p>"You can hear what I'm saying now well enough," Timothy pointed out.
</p><p>"I read the lips," said Mr. Frog with a snicker.
</p><p>That speech made Timothy Turtle start.
</p><p>"Then if you can read my lips, no doubt you can read what's on my back,"
he said.
</p><p>"That's easy," the tailor observed. "Your shell's on your back, of
course."
</p><p>Timothy Turtle glanced up with a look of scorn.
</p><p>"Don't be silly!" he snapped. "I mean, can you read what's carved on my
shell?"
</p><p>"Certainly!" Mr. Frog replied. And he began to mutter, as if to himself,
"J. G.--that means <u>just grumpy</u>, of course----"
</p><p>Timothy Turtle interrupted him quickly.
</p><p>"I don't care to hear any more," he screamed. And turning away, he
waddled towards the water.
</p><p>"That Ferdinand Frog has no manners," he spluttered. "I only wish he
wasn't quite so spry." And Mr. Turtle looked very fierce as he snapped
his jaws together.
