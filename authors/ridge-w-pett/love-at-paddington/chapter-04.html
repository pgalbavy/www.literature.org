<p>Madame Hilbert and the forewoman in Great Titchfield Street consulted
each other only when crises occurred; the girls knew that if Madame
came to the doorway, saying, "Miss Rabbit, just half a second, please,"
and the forewoman was absent for half an hour, then some matter of
supreme importance was being discussed.  The establishment was in close
touch with the military service at home and abroad, and the best stroke
good fortune could make in favour of Hilbert's was to arrange a stately
ceremonial in India, some alteration in the dress of officers, or
anything that made uniforms necessary.  The girls' workroom, even at
ordinary times, presented an aspect of enormous wealth, with everywhere
a display of gold--loose threads of it on the tables, collected threads
being sewn on foundations, epaulettes in course of making, heavy
dependent nuggets hung upon scarves.  Gold floated in the air, and when
the sun came through the windows it all looked as though one could play
the conjurer, and perform the enchanting trick of making a dash with
the hand and secure sovereigns.  Many of the girls wore glasses because
continued attention to the glistening colours affected the eyes;
sometimes a worker became pale of features, anaemic and depressed, and
had to hurry off to the sea-side, and Miss Rabbit referred to this as
an act of Providence.  For the most part, the girls were healthy and
cheerful, and they had the encouragement of good wages.  Miss Rabbit,
it was reported, took home every Saturday two pounds ten shillings; the
very youngest assistant made twelve shillings a week.
</p>
<p>"I do hope," said Madame, at a special private conference, "it doesn't
mean she's taking up religion."  The forewoman shook her head.  "I've
known cases in my time where it's come on suddenly, and it's thrown a
girl clean off her balance.  If it isn't religion it must be love.
Love has just about the same effect with some of us.  Have you ever
been gone on any one, Miss Rabbit?"
</p><p>"Only to a very moderate extent," replied the forewoman precisely.
"And it's such a long while ago, Madame, that I've nearly forgot all
about it."
</p><p>"I don't like to see one of my girls turn like this all at once," said
Madame with anxiety.  "Moreover, she's the handy one in the business.
There's nothing she doesn't know about the work, and little she can't
do.  If anything happened to you, I've always had the idea of putting
her in your position."
</p><p>Miss Rabbit's features twitched; she corrected the slip at once by
assuming a look of cordial agreement.  "You always know the right thing
to do, Madame," she murmured reverently.
</p><p>"How'd it be to call her in, and both of us have a talk to her, and
find out whether she's got anything on her mind?"
</p><p>"That's a splendid notion," admitted Miss Rabbit with enthusiasm.  "Or
shall I have a quiet chat with her first, and pave the way, so to
speak?"
</p><p>"I wish you would," said Madame.  "You're not particularly clever, but
I believe you've got a kind heart."
</p><p>The forewoman that evening, whilst the girls were washing and sharing
the brush and comb, and complaining that hair came out by the handful,
entered the office; announcing the occasion as her birthday, she asked
Miss Higham to leave books, and assist in celebrating the event by
taking with her a cup of chocolate.  Gertie wanted to reach home early
in order to see whether an expected letter had arrived, but the
invitation suggested a rare compliment, and, with a stipulation
arranging that the hospitality should not exceed the space of twenty
minutes, she accepted.  In an A.B.C. shop at the corner, later, Gertie
raised her large cup and wished Miss Rabbit many happy returns.  Her
eyes wandered rather eagerly about the crowded tables; the inspection
over, she sighed.
</p><p>"Wonder if I can trust you, dear," said Miss Rabbit, resting elbows.
"I've been so often taken in over friendships with people that I
suppose I'm more cautious than most.  But there's a look about
you--perhaps, though, I'd better keep on the safe side."
</p><p>"I'm not one to chatter."
</p><p>"I know, I know.  That's why I've always took to you specially."  Again
Miss Rabbit stopped.  She stirred her cup of chocolate slowly.
</p><p>"If it's good news," advised Gertie, "tell me.  I can do with some just
now.  If it's not, keep it to yourself."
</p><p>"It's rather serious news, and that's why I think you ought to be told.
First of all, you must promise me, on your soul and honour, not to
breathe a word of it to anybody.  Above all, not to Madame."
</p><p>"I promise," she said.
</p><p>"Very well then"--with a satisfied air--"it's like this."  She leaned
across the marble table.  "Our show is going to burst up."
</p><p>The dramatic announcement over, and the appropriate ejaculation, the
correct look of amazement and despair given.  Miss Rabbit warmed to her
task, and became voluble; at each new paragraph of her discourse she
exacted a fresh guarantee that the information would go no further,
that the bond of absolute secrecy should be respected.  Once, she felt
it necessary to say that if the other communicated a single word of the
confidences to any third party, she, Miss Rabbit, would feel it her
duty to haunt Miss Higham to the last hour of her life.  Put briefly,
the news came to this.  That Madame was in financial difficulties; that
her name and address might be found in the bankruptcy list any coming
Wednesday or Saturday; that no one was likely to be stupid enough to
take over the business; that the members of the staff, men and girls,
would find themselves turned out into a cold, hard world.  The drawback
of being connected with a business of a special nature like theirs was
that there existed but few of a similar nature, and these were already
fully supplied with assistants.  Miss Rabbit herself intended to look
out for another berth ere the market became swamped by many
applications; with piety, she called attention to a well-known text
which said, "Go thou and do likewise."  Outside the A.B.C. shop, Miss
Rabbit, in extorting thanks for her generous behaviour, demanded, once
more, a promise.
</p><p>"Say it after me," she ordered.  "'I will never utter a single syllable
of all this to a solitary living soul.'"  Her instructions complied
with, she remarked that a great load was now taken from her mind, and
asked Gertie for advice on the point whether to go home by omnibus or
Tube railway.
</p><p>The girl arrived at Praed Street after a brisk walk that was intended
to detach the mind from disturbing incident.  In the broad thoroughfare
of Portland Place (which looked as though it started with the idea of
being a long, important roadway to the north, and became suddenly
reminded, to its great astonishment, that Regent's Park barred the way)
she had glanced up at the large houses, and wished she lived in one; in
that case she would receive Henry Douglass, at the end of the silence
that had come since the last meeting, and after listening to him,
reject his advances haughtily.  That was the phrase.  Reject his
advances haughtily.  She had read it more than once in the literature
which attracted her in the days before Henry.  Since she had known him,
a course of reading, adopted at his suggestion, took her away from the
more flowery and romantic pages, but in the old serial stories the folk
had nothing to do but to make love to each other, with intervals for
meals and rest; they were not restricted to evening hours; the whole
day was at their service.  And certainly the ladies never found
themselves burdened with the anxiety of losing a weekly wage, in Great
Titchfield Street, and the prospect of difficulty in finding one to
replace it.
</p><p>"I'm home, aunt," she announced, entering the shop.
</p><p>"So I see," remarked Mrs. Mills.  Two customers were being served at
the newspaper counter, and two were waiting on the tobacco side.
Gertie attended to the orders for cigarettes; the shop cleared.
</p><p>"Is there a letter for me?" she asked.
</p><p>Mrs. Mills shook her head curtly.
</p><p>"Has--has any one called?"
</p><p>"Now, let me think."  Her aunt deliberated carefully in the manner of a
conscientious witness impressed by the taking of the oath.  "Yes, Miss
Radford looked in and went again.  Left word that she wanted you to go
with her for an outing next Saturday afternoon.  Said she wanted a
breath of fresh air.  Mr. Trew is inside--and that reminds me, I've got
something to say to him.  Wait here, like a dear, and look after the
shop."  Mrs. Mills closed the door carefully behind her as she went
into the parlour.
</p><p>"So, Mr. Trew, I packed him off about his business," she said,
obviously continuing a half-finished recital.  "I said, 'She asked me
to tell you that she thought it better for both parties that you and
her shouldn't see each other again.'  Don't blame me, do you?"
</p><p>Mr. Trew rubbed his chin with the knuckle of a finger and remarked
that, by rights, he ought to have a shave.
</p><p>"I stopped his two letters when they came," went on Mrs. Mills.  "Many
a woman in my position would have been curious enough to open them; I
didn't.  I simply put them in a drawer where they can be found when the
trouble's all over.  No one can blame me for that, surely."
</p><p>Mr. Trew mentioned that it was a rummy world, and the methods adopted
by the people living in it did not make it the less rummy.
</p><p>"I see what you mean," she said aggrievedly.  "You think I've gone too
far.  But you yourself admitted at the start, when she was meeting that
other young gentleman, that high and low never mixed well.  And when I
heard that this one was likely to come into property, I made up my mind
to take the bull by the horns.  What's that you say?  Speak out, if
you've got anything in your head."
</p><p>"When you take the bull by the horns," said Trew, advancing to the
white hearthrug, "what happens is a toss up.  I can't tell you yet
whether you've done right or whether you've done wrong; but if you put
the question to me a 'underd years hence, I shall be able to answer
you.  What's pretty clear to me is that you're fond of her, and I'm
fond of her, and all we want is to see her comfor'ble and happy.
Whether you're taking the right track to gain that object is more than
I can say.  Personally, I shouldn't care to go so far as you've gone."
</p><p>"That's because you're a coward."
</p><p>"Delight of my juvenile heart," said Mr. Trew, "it's quite likely
you've hit on precisely the right explanation.  Only thing is, it seems
to me somewhat rough on the little missy."
</p>
<p>Miss Radford was studying the arrival of trains list at Paddington in
order to ascertain from which platform the 1.20 p.m. started; she had
assumed the slightly demented appearance that so many take when they
enter a railway station.  Turning from the poster distractedly, she
clutched at the arm of a sailor, and was putting to him agitated
inquiries concerning the Great Western service when Gertie Higham
interposed, and released the naval man from a duty for which he was not
adequately equipped.  Firmly and resolutely she conducted Miss Radford
to the correct platform, where they found seats in a compartment; and
Miss Radford in vain tried to remember whether it was that sitting
facing the engine or sitting with her back to the engine gave her a
headache.  Gertie had obtained the tickets, and Miss Radford wanted
hers; Gertie retained possession.  On the question of finance, she said
a settlement could be arranged when the outing was over.  Other
passengers entered, including two lads, who set at once on the work of
studying scientific books; Miss Radford, changing her manner, dropped
her parasol as the train started, and one of the youths picked it up,
without disengaging his attention from the volume, and handed it to her.
</p><p>"Thanks awfully," she said, in refined and slightly languid tones; "I
am such a clumsy creature"--partly addressing her friend, but mainly
speaking to the entire compartment.  "Really, I seem quite lost without
my maid to look after me."
</p><p>"You managed to get away from the shop in good time," remarked Gertie.
</p><p>"What an irritating girl you are, to be sure!" whispered Miss Radford
aggrievedly.  "No help at all when I'm trying to make a good
impression.  Wish now I hadn't asked you to come along with me; I only
did it because I couldn't get any one else.  What's become of that
young swell I saw you with on Primrose Hill?"
</p><p>"I really don't know."
</p><p>Miss Radford spoke complacently of her intense love of the country and
keen anticipation of the joy to be found at Burnham Beeches, and when
the train stopped at Slough the compartment mentioned to her that this
was where she ought to alight.  Gertie, interposing, said that they
were, in reality, going further.  On Miss Radford asking, in astonished
tones, "Whatever for?" she received information that the desire was to
get well away from the crowd.  The two, changing at a junction, found a
small train on another platform that had but a single line; Miss
Radford took the precaution of inquiring of the engine-driver whether
he considered it safe.  The two lads crossed the bridge, and, to her
intense annoyance, entered a smoking-compartment.
</p><p>"I daresay, perhaps"--recovering from this blow--"that we shall manage
to run across some others before the day's out."
</p><p>"Hope not."
</p><p>"Well, upon my word," declared the astonished Miss Radford, "you grow
more and more peculiar every day!"
</p><p>They discovered themselves, immediately after leaving the station yard,
in an old-fashioned town with large houses close to the brick pavement;
cyclists raced along the narrow roadway, and folk carried baskets in
the direction of the river.  Gertie stopped to put an inquiry to a
policeman, and declined to satisfy her companion's curiosity either in
regard to the question or to the answer.  Turning to the right, they
came to a market-place and a town hall, and, amongst the small shops,
one that they noted as a suitable place for tea.  The sun was warm, and
folk were shopping with suitable deliberation; dogcarts stood outside
the principal establishments, motor cars brought up new supplies of
clients.  Gertie appeared greatly interested in the occupants of these
conveyances; some of the ladies were so well protected from dust that
identification would not have been easy.  Miss Radford mentioned that
she had not seen so many funny figures about since the fifth of
November of the previous year.
</p><p>"Where are we off to now?" she demanded.
</p><p>"A good long walk."
</p><p>"Not me!" replied Miss Radford with determination.  "I've got new shoes
on.  You leave me somewhere with a magazine to read, and go off on your
own, and come back when you're tired."
</p><p>"You won't be lonely?"
</p><p>"I can always find a pleasure," said Gertie's friend haughtily, "in my
own company."
</p><p>The riverside, Miss Radford decided, was a suitable spot for rest; she
could sit there and, in the intervals of application to literature of
the day, watch young men hiring boats and setting out to Shillingford
or Cholsey.  So Gertie Higham started out across the bridge and walked
alone through a village where every shop sold everything, where the
police station was a homely, comfortable cottage, and children played
on wide grass borders of the road.  At the cross-roads she went to the
left; an avenue of trees gave a shade that was welcome.  The colour
came to her face as she strode along briskly, and this was not entirely
due to hurry or to the rays of the afternoon sun.  Once or twice she
almost stopped, as though considering the advisability of returning.
</p><p>An ivy-covered house stood at the side of iron gates, and Gertie
watched it as she approached.  An elderly man was clipping hedges; he
arrested his work, with an evident hope that conversation would occur.
</p><p>"No, young 'ooman," he said, "that ent where her ladyship lives.
That's only the gate lodge what you're looking at.  A good ha'f-mile
'fore you come the house itself.  Do you know her, may I inquire?"
</p><p>"We've met in London."
</p><p>"Well"--slowly, and making the most of the opportunity--"she ent
pleased to see many of her visitors, if all I hear is true; but no
doubt she'd be gratified to see you.  I'm only a new-comer hereabouts,
so to speak, but--"  He shook his head thoughtfully, and, taking off
his hat, readjusted the cabbage leaf that lined it.  "I don't blame Sir
Mark for going off and getting killed.  After all, it ent as though she
were left chargeable to the parish, as you may say."
</p><p>"She is quite well to do, I suppose?"
</p><p>"Plenty of money about, as me and you would rackon it.  I understand
she complains of not having enough--but there, some people are never
satisfied.  Going to give a party next week," he added confidentially.
"Not a great turn-out, because they're all in black, so to speak.  So
fur as I can gain from the local newspaper--"
</p><p>"You say it's half a mile up to the house?"
</p><p>"You can't very well miss it if you foller your nose," said the old
man, hurt by the interruption.
</p><p>Through the iron gates Gertie saw two figures coming around the curve
of the gravelled carriage-way; she took ambush hurriedly near to an oak
tree.  Henry's voice could be heard, with an occasional remark from
Miss Loriner.  "And if I promise to worship you all my life," Henry was
saying, "will you then give me my heart's desire?"  His companion did
not reply; he repeated the last words.  "You must first," she said,
"make a name in the world, and show yourself worthy of a woman's love."
They turned as they reached the gates, and when Henry next spoke his
remarks did not reach the girl near the oak tree.
</p><p>"And haven't you been a time!" complained Miss Radford.  "Over a hower
altogether, according to my watch.  And I'm simply dying for a cup of
tea.  There's only been one young gentleman who waved his hand to me; I
was so cross that I didn't wave back.  Whatever are you dodging up to
now?"
</p><p>"I'm going to hire a boat," said Gertie, "and take you out on the
river."
</p><p>"You can't row."
</p><p>"Some one learnt me--taught me on the lake in Regent's Park."
</p><p>Miss Radford declared, on the journey home, that she envied her
friend's good spirits; in her own case, she always found that if she
became more than ordinarily cheerful she inevitably paid for it by
subsequent depression.  Gertie recommended her to adopt the method of
not magnifying grievances; if you wanted to view trouble, you could
take opera-glasses, but you should be careful to hold them the wrong
way round.  The studious youths entered the compartment at Goring,
their books now put away in pockets, and similarly cheered by exercise;
one, seated opposite Gertie, touched her foot with his shoe at
Pangbourne, and she took no notice.  When he did this again at
Tilehurst, she came down heavily upon his toes, and gave, for her
clumsiness, an apologetic word that he accepted sulkily.  Near to
Paddington, Miss Radford mentioned that, in her opinion, men were most
frightfully stupid, and to her surprise Gertie agreed.
</p><p>Gertie Higham relieved her aunt from duty in the shop, and a letter
brought by the postman at nine o'clock was handed over the counter to
her direct; the official recommended her to accept the offer, and put
the young gentleman out of his misery.  The communication was written
in a large hand, about twelve words to a page, and liberally
underlined.  Printed in the corner were a telegraphic address, a
telephone number, directions concerning nearest railway station.  For
heading, Morden Place, Ewelme.
</p>
<p>"DEAR MISS HIGHAM,--We shall be so glad if you can pay us a visit on
Friday next and stay over for the week-end.  <u>Dear</u> Henry is
<u>particularly</u> anxious that you should be here on <u>Saturday evening</u>.
</p><p>"What a <u>wonderful</u> summer we are having!!!--Yours <u>sincerely</u>,
</p><p><strong>"MYRA DOUGLASS."</strong>
</p>
<p>The girl found a sheet of the best notepaper on the shelves, and wrote
at once.
</p>
<p>"DEAR LADY DOUGLASS,--I shall not be able to come to you next Friday.
I am rather busy.
</p><p>"It is indeed a capital summer.  I am enjoying it.--Yours sincerely,
