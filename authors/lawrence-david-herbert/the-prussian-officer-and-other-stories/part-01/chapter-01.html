<p>They had marched more than thirty kilometres since dawn, along the
white, hot road where occasional thickets of trees threw a moment
of shade, then out into the glare again.  On either hand, the
valley, wide and shallow, glittered with heat; dark green patches
of rye, pale young corn, fallow and meadow and black pine woods
spread in a dull, hot diagram under a glistening sky.  But right in
front the mountains ranged across, pale blue and very still, snow
gleaming gently out of the deep atmosphere.  And towards the
mountains, on and on, the regiment marched between the rye fields
and the meadows, between the scraggy fruit trees set regularly on
either side the high road.  The burnished, dark green rye threw off
a suffocating heat, the mountains drew gradually nearer and more
distinct.  While the feet of the soldiers grew hotter, sweat ran
through their hair under their helmets, and their knapsacks could
burn no more in contact with their shoulders, but seemed instead to
give off a cold, prickly sensation.</p>

<p>He walked on and on in silence, staring at the mountains ahead,
that rose sheer out of the land, and stood fold behind fold, half
earth, half heaven, the heaven, the barrier with slits of soft
snow, in the pale, bluish peaks.</p>

<p>He could now walk almost without pain.  At the start, he had
determined not to limp.  It had made him sick to take the first
steps, and during the first mile or so, he had compressed his
breath, and the cold drops of sweat had stood on his forehead.  But
he had walked it off.  What were they after all but bruises!  He
had looked at them, as he was getting up: deep bruises on the backs
of his thighs.  And since he had made his first step in the
morning, he had been conscious of them, till now he had a tight,
hot place in his chest, with suppressing the pain, and holding
himself in.  There seemed no air when he breathed.  But he walked
almost lightly.</p>

<p>The Captain's hand had trembled at taking his coffee at dawn: his
orderly saw it again.  And he saw the fine figure of the Captain
wheeling on horseback at the farm-house ahead, a handsome figure in
pale blue uniform with facings of scarlet, and the metal gleaming
on the black helmet and the sword-scabbard, and dark streaks of
sweat coming on the silky bay horse.  The orderly felt he was
connected with that figure moving so suddenly on horseback: he
followed it like a shadow, mute and inevitable and damned by it.
And the officer was always aware of the tramp of the company
behind, the march of his orderly among the men.</p>

<p>The Captain was a tall man of about forty, grey at the temples.  He
had a handsome, finely knit figure, and was one of the best
horsemen in the West.  His orderly, having to rub him down, admired
the amazing riding-muscles of his loins.</p>

<p>For the rest, the orderly scarcely noticed the officer any more
than he noticed himself.  It was rarely he saw his master's face:
he did not look at it.  The Captain had reddish-brown, stiff hair,
that he wore short upon his skull.  His moustache was also cut
short and bristly over a full, brutal mouth.  His face was rather
rugged, the cheeks thin.  Perhaps the man was the more handsome for
the deep lines in his face, the irritable tension of his brow,
which gave him the look of a man who fights with life.  His fair
eyebrows stood bushy over light blue eyes that were always flashing
with cold fire.</p>

<p>He was a Prussian aristocrat, haughty and overbearing.  But his
mother had been a Polish Countess.  Having made too many gambling
debts when he was young, he had ruined his prospects in the Army,
and remained an infantry captain.  He had never married: his
position did not allow of it, and no woman had ever moved him to
it.  His time he spent riding - occasionally he rode one of his own
horses at the races - and at the officers' club.  Now and then he
took himself a mistress.  But after such an event, he returned to
duty with his brow still more tense, his eyes still more hostile
and irritable.  With the men, however, he was merely impersonal,
though a devil when roused; so that, on the whole, they feared him,
but had no great aversion from him.  They accepted him as the
inevitable.</p>

<p>To his orderly he was at first cold and just and indifferent: he
did not fuss over trifles.  So that his servant knew practically
nothing about him, except just what orders he would give, and how
he wanted them obeyed.  That was quite simple.  Then the change
gradually came.</p>

<p>The orderly was a youth of about twenty-two, of medium height, and
well built.  He had strong, heavy limbs, was swarthy, with a soft,
black, young moustache.  There was something altogether warm and
young about him.  He had firmly marked eyebrows over dark,
expressionless eyes, that seemed never to have thought, only to
have received life direct through his senses, and acted straight
from instinct.</p>

<p>Gradually the officer had become aware of his servant's young,
vigorous, unconscious presence about him.  He could not get away
from the sense of the youth's person, while he was in attendance.
It was like a warm flame upon the older man's tense, rigid body,
that had become almost unliving, fixed.  There was something so
free and self-contained about him, and something in the young
fellow's movement, that made the officer aware of him.  And this
irritated the Prussian.  He did not choose to be touched into life
by his servant.  He might easily have changed his man, but he did
not.  He now very rarely looked direct at his orderly, but kept his
face averted, as if to avoid seeing him.  And yet as the young
soldier moved unthinking about the apartment, the elder watched
him, and would notice the movement of his strong young shoulders
under the blue cloth, the bend of his neck.  And it irritated him.
To see the soldier's young, brown, shapely peasant's hand grasp the
loaf or the wine-bottle sent a flash of hate or of anger through
the elder man's blood.  It was not that the youth was clumsy: it
was rather the blind, instinctive sureness of movement of an
unhampered young animal that irritated the officer to such a
degree.</p>

<p>Once, when a bottle of wine had gone over, and the red gushed out
on to the tablecloth, the officer had started up with an oath, and
his eyes, bluey like fire, had held those of the confused youth for
a moment.  It was a shock for the young soldier.  He felt something
sink deeper, deeper into his soul, where nothing had ever gone
before.  It left him rather blank and wondering.  Some of his
natural completeness in himself was gone, a little uneasiness took
its place.  And from that time an undiscovered feeling had held
between the two men.</p>

<p>Henceforward the orderly was afraid of really meeting his master.
His subconsciousness remembered those steely blue eyes and the
harsh brows, and did not intend to meet them again.  So he always
stared past his master, and avoided him.  Also, in a little
anxiety, he waited for the three months to have gone, when his time
would be up.  He began to feel a constraint in the Captain's
presence, and the soldier even more than the officer wanted to be
left alone, in his neutrality as servant.</p>

<p>He had served the Captain for more than a year, and knew his duty.
This he performed easily, as if it were natural to him.  The
officer and his commands he took for granted, as he took the sun
and the rain, and he served as a matter of course.  It did not
implicate him personally.</p>

<p>But now if he were going to be forced into a personal interchange
with his master he would be like a wild thing caught, he felt he
must get away.</p>

<p>But the influence of the young soldier's being had penetrated
through the officer's stiffened discipline, and perturbed the man
in him.  He, however, was a gentleman, with long, fine hands and
cultivated movements, and was not going to allow such a thing as
the stirring of his innate self.  He was a man of passionate
temper, who had always kept himself suppressed.  Occasionally there
had been a duel, an outburst before the soldiers.  He knew himself
to be always on the point of breaking out.  But he kept himself
hard to the idea of the Service.  Whereas the young soldier seemed
to live out his warm, full nature, to give it off in his very
movements, which had a certain zest, such as wild animals have in
free movement.  And this irritated the officer more and more.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, the Captain could not regain his neutrality of
feeling towards his orderly.  Nor could he leave the man alone.  In
spite of himself, he watched him, gave him sharp orders, tried to
take up as much of his time as possible.  Sometimes he flew into a
rage with the young soldier, and bullied him.  Then the orderly
shut himself off, as it were out of earshot, and waited, with
sullen, flushed face, for the end of the noise.  The words never
pierced to his intelligence, he made himself, protectively,
impervious to the feelings of his master.</p>

<p>He had a scar on his left thumb, a deep seam going across the
knuckle.  The officer had long suffered from it, and wanted to do
something to it.  Still it was there, ugly and brutal on the young,
brown hand.  At last the Captain's reserve gave way.  One day, as
the orderly was smoothing out the tablecloth, the officer pinned
down his thumb with a pencil, asking:</p>

<p>&quot;How did you come by that?&quot;</p>

<p>The young man winced and drew back at attention.</p>

<p>&quot;A wood axe, Herr Hauptmann,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>The officer waited for further explanation.  None came.  The
orderly went about his duties.  The elder man was sullenly angry.
His servant avoided him.  And the next day he had to use all his
will-power to avoid seeing the scarred thumb.  He wanted to get
hold of it and - A hot flame ran in his blood.</p>

<p>He knew his servant would soon be free, and would be glad.  As yet,
the soldier had held himself off from the elder man.  The Captain
grew madly irritable.  He could not rest when the soldier was away,
and when he was present, he glared at him with tormented eyes.  He
hated those fine, black brows over the unmeaning, dark eyes, he was
infuriated by the free movement of the handsome limbs, which no
military discipline could make stiff.  And he became harsh and
cruelly bullying, using contempt and satire.  The young soldier
only grew more mute and expressionless.</p>

<p>&quot;What cattle were you bred by, that you can't keep straight eyes?
Look me in the eyes when I speak to you.&quot;</p>

<p>And the soldier turned his dark eyes to the other's face, but there
was no sight in them: he stared with the slightest possible cast,
holding back his sight, perceiving the blue of his master's eyes,
but receiving no look from them.  And the elder man went pale, and
his reddish eyebrows twitched.  He gave his order, barrenly.</p>

<p>Once he flung a heavy military glove into the young soldier's face.
Then he had the satisfaction of seeing the black eyes flare up into
his own, like a blaze when straw is thrown on a fire.  And he had
laughed with a little tremor and a sneer.</p>

<p>But there were only two months more.  The youth instinctively tried
to keep himself intact: he tried to serve the officer as if the
latter were an abstract authority and not a man.  All his instinct
was to avoid personal contact, even definite hate.  But in spite of
himself the hate grew, responsive to the officer's passion.
However, he put it in the background.  When he had left the Army he
could dare acknowledge it.  By nature he was active, and had many
friends.  He thought what amazing good fellows they were.  But,
without knowing it, he was alone.  Now this solitariness was
intensified.  It would carry him through his term.  But the officer
seemed to be going irritably insane, and the youth was deeply
frightened.</p>

<p>The soldier had a sweetheart, a girl from the mountains, independent
and primitive.  The two walked together, rather silently.  He went
with her, not to talk, but to have his arm round her, and for the
physical contact.  This eased him, made it easier for him to ignore
the Captain; for he could rest with her held fast against his chest.
And she, in some unspoken fashion, was there for him.  They loved
each other.</p>

<p>The Captain perceived it, and was mad with irritation.  He kept the
young man engaged all the evenings long, and took pleasure in the
dark look that came on his face.  Occasionally, the eyes of the two
men met, those of the younger sullen and dark, doggedly unalterable,
those of the elder sneering with restless contempt.</p>

<p>The officer tried hard not to admit the passion that had got hold
of him.  He would not know that his feeling for his orderly was
anything but that of a man incensed by his stupid, perverse
servant.  So, keeping quite justified and conventional in his
consciousness, he let the other thing run on.  His nerves, however,
were suffering.  At last he slung the end of a belt in his
servant's face.  When he saw the youth start back, the pain-tears
in his eyes and the blood on his mouth, he had felt at once a
thrill of deep pleasure and of shame.</p>

<p>But this, he acknowledged to himself, was a thing he had never done
before.  The fellow was too exasperating.  His own nerves must be
going to pieces.  He went away for some days with a woman.</p>

<p>It was a mockery of pleasure.  He simply did not want the woman.
But he stayed on for his time.  At the end of it, he came back in
an agony of irritation, torment, and misery.  He rode all the
evening, then came straight in to supper.  His orderly was out.
The officer sat with his long, fine hands lying on the table,
perfectly still, and all his blood seemed to be corroding.</p>

<p>At last his servant entered.  He watched the strong, easy young
figure, the fine eyebrows, the thick black hair.  In a week's time
the youth had got back his old well-being.  The hands of the
officer twitched and seemed to be full of mad flame.  The young man
stood at attention, unmoving, shut off.</p>

<p>The meal went in silence.  But the orderly seemed eager.  He made a
clatter with the dishes.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you in a hurry?&quot; asked the officer, watching the intent, warm
face of his servant.  The other did not reply.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you answer my question?&quot; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the orderly, standing with his pile of deep
Army plates.  The Captain waited, looked at him, then asked again:</p>

<p>&quot;Are you in a hurry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; came the answer, that sent a flash through the
listener.</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was going out, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you this evening.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation.  The officer had a curious
stiffness of countenance.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the servant, in his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to-morrow evening also - in fact, you may consider your
evenings occupied, unless I give you leave.&quot;</p>

<p>The mouth with the young moustache set close.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered the orderly, loosening his lips for a moment.</p>

<p>He again turned to the door.</p>

<p>&quot;And why have you a piece of pencil in your ear?&quot;</p>

<p>The orderly hesitated, then continued on his way without answering.
He set the plates in a pile outside the door, took the stump of
pencil from his ear, and put it in his pocket.  He had been copying
a verse for his sweetheart's birthday card.  He returned to finish
clearing the table.  The officer's eyes were dancing, he had a
little, eager smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Why have you a piece of pencil in your ear?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>The orderly took his hands full of dishes.  His master was standing
near the great green stove, a little smile on his face, his chin
thrust forward.  When the young soldier saw him his heart suddenly
ran hot.  He felt blind.  Instead of answering, he turned dazedly
to the door.  As he was crouching to set down the dishes, he was
pitched forward by a kick from behind.  The pots went in a stream
down the stairs, he clung to the pillar of the banisters.  And as
he was rising he was kicked heavily again, and again, so that he
clung sickly to the post for some moments.  His master had gone
swiftly into the room and closed the door.  The maid-servant
downstairs looked up the staircase and made a mocking face at the
crockery disaster.</p>

<p>The officer's heart was plunging.  He poured himself a glass of
wine, part of which he spilled on the floor, and gulped the
remainder, leaning against the cool, green stove.  He heard his man
collecting the dishes from the stairs.  Pale, as if intoxicated, he
waited.  The servant entered again.  The Captain's heart gave a
pang, as of pleasure, seeing the young fellow bewildered and
uncertain on his feet, with pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Sch&ouml;ner!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The soldier was a little slower in coming to attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>The youth stood before him, with pathetic young moustache, and fine
eyebrows very distinct on his forehead of dark marble.</p>

<p>&quot;I asked you a question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The officer's tone bit like acid.</p>

<p>&quot;Why had you a pencil in your ear?&quot;</p>

<p>Again the servant's heart ran hot, and he could not breathe.  With
dark, strained eyes, he looked at the officer, as if fascinated.
And he stood there sturdily planted, unconscious.  The withering
smile came into the Captain's eyes, and he lifted his foot.</p>

<p>&quot;I - I forgot it - sir,&quot; panted the soldier, his dark eyes fixed on
the other man's dancing blue ones.</p>

<p>&quot;What was it doing there?&quot;</p>

<p>He saw the young man's breast heaving as he made an effort for
words.</p>

<p>&quot;I had been writing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Writing what?&quot;</p>

<p>Again the soldier looked up and down.  The officer could hear him
panting.  The smile came into the blue eyes.  The soldier worked
his dry throat, but could not speak.  Suddenly the smile lit like a
flame on the officer's face, and a kick came heavily against the
orderly's thigh.  The youth moved a pace sideways.  His face went
dead, with two black, staring eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the officer.</p>

<p>The orderly's mouth had gone dry, and his tongue rubbed in it as on
dry brown-paper.  He worked his throat.  The officer raised his
foot.  The servant went stiff.</p>

<p>&quot;Some poetry, sir,&quot; came the crackling, unrecognizable sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Poetry, what poetry?&quot; asked the Captain, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>Again there was the working in the throat.  The Captain's heart had
suddenly gone down heavily, and he stood sick and tired.</p>

<p>&quot;For my girl, sir,&quot; he heard the dry, inhuman sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; he said, turning away.  &quot;Clear the table.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Click!&quot; went the soldier's throat; then again, &quot;click!&quot; and then
the half-articulate:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The young soldier was gone, looking old, and walking heavily.</p>

<p>The officer, left alone, held himself rigid, to prevent himself
from thinking.  His instinct warned him that he must not think.
Deep inside him was the intense gratification of his passion, still
working powerfully.  Then there was a counter-action, a horrible
breaking down of something inside him, a whole agony of reaction.
He stood there for an hour motionless, a chaos of sensations, but
rigid with a will to keep blank his consciousness, to prevent his
mind grasping.  And he held himself so until the worst of the
stress had passed, when he began to drink, drank himself to an
intoxication, till he slept obliterated.  When he woke in the
morning he was shaken to the base of his nature.  But he had fought
off the realization of what he had done.  He had prevented his mind
from taking it in, had suppressed it along with his instincts, and
the conscious man had nothing to do with it.  He felt only as after
a bout of intoxication, weak, but the affair itself all dim and not
to be recovered.  Of the drunkenness of his passion he successfully
refused remembrance.  And when his orderly appeared with coffee,
the officer assumed the same self he had had the morning before.
He refused the event of the past night - denied it had ever been - 
and was successful in his denial.  He had not done any such thing - 
not he himself.  Whatever there might be lay at the door of a
stupid, insubordinate servant.</p>

<p>The orderly had gone about in a stupor all the evening.  He drank
some beer because he was parched, but not much, the alcohol made
his feeling come back, and he could not bear it.  He was dulled, as
if nine-tenths of the ordinary man in him were inert.  He crawled
about disfigured.  Still, when he thought of the kicks, he went
sick, and when he thought of the threat of more kicking, in the
room afterwards, his heart went hot and faint, and he panted,
remembering the one that had come.  He had been forced to say, &quot;For
my girl.&quot;  He was much too done even to want to cry.  His mouth
hung slightly open, like an idiot's.  He felt vacant, and wasted.
So, he wandered at his work, painfully, and very slowly and
clumsily, fumbling blindly with the brushes, and finding it
difficult, when he sat down, to summon the energy to move again.
His limbs, his jaw, were slack and nerveless.  But he was very
tired.  He got to bed at last, and slept inert, relaxed, in a sleep
that was rather stupor than slumber, a dead night of stupefaction
shot through with gleams of anguish.</p>

<p>In the morning were the manoeuvres.  But he woke even before the
bugle sounded.  The painful ache in his chest, the dryness of his
throat, the awful steady feeling of misery made his eyes come awake
and dreary at once.  He knew, without thinking, what had happened.
And he knew that the day had come again, when he must go on with
his round.  The last bit of darkness was being pushed out of the
room.  He would have to move his inert body and go on.  He was so
young, and had known so little trouble, that he was bewildered.  He
only wished it would stay night, so that he could lie still,
covered up by the darkness.  And yet nothing would prevent the day
from coming, nothing would save him from having to get up and
saddle the Captain's horse, and make the Captain's coffee.  It was
there, inevitable.  And then, he thought, it was impossible.  Yet
they would not leave him free.  He must go and take the coffee to
the Captain.  He was too stunned to understand it.  He only knew it
was inevitable - inevitable, however long he lay inert.</p>

<p>At last, after heaving at himself, for he seemed to be a mass of
inertia, he got up.  But he had to force every one of his movements
from behind, with his will.  He felt lost, and dazed, and helpless.
Then he clutched hold of the bed, the pain was so keen.  And
looking at his thighs, he saw the darker bruises on his swarthy
flesh and he knew that, if he pressed one of his fingers on one of
the bruises, he should faint.  But he did not want to faint - he did
not want anybody to know.  No one should ever know.  It was between
him and the Captain.  There were only the two people in the world
now - himself and the Captain.</p>

<p>Slowly, economically, he got dressed and forced himself to walk.
Everything was obscure, except just what he had his hands on.  But
he managed to get through his work.  The very pain revived his dull
senses.  The worst remained yet.  He took the tray and went up to
the Captain's room.  The officer, pale and heavy, sat at the table.
The orderly, as he saluted, felt himself put out of existence.  He
stood still for a moment submitting to his own nullification - then
he gathered himself, seemed to regain himself, and then the Captain
began to grow vague, unreal, and the younger soldier's heart beat
up.  He clung to this situation - that the Captain did not exist - so
that he himself might live.  But when he saw his officer's hand
tremble as he took the coffee, he felt everything falling
shattered.  And he went away, feeling as if he himself were coming
to pieces, disintegrated.  And when the Captain was there on
horseback, giving orders, while he himself stood, with rifle and
knapsack, sick with pain, he felt as if he must shut his eyes - as
if he must shut his eyes on everything.  It was only the long agony
of marching with a parched throat that filled him with one single,
sleep-heavy intention: to save himself.</p>
