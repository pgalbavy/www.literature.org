<p>Ben Mayberry was so desirous that Rutherford Richmond and his
brother conspirator should be given all the time they needed to
complete their scheme for waylaying and assaulting him, that he
lingered on the road longer than was really necessary.</p>

<p>Finally he turned down the street, which crossed by the creek
that ran through the center of Damietta. It was a clear moonlight
night, and, except in the shadow, objects could be seen distinctly
for a considerable distance. He advanced with great care, and
with all his wits at command, for he was confident the warning
given him by Ned Deering was well founded.</p>

<p>When within a block of the bridge he saw someone peep out of
Carter's Alley and instantly draw back his head, as though fearful
of being observed. A moment later, a second person did the same.
Rutherford Richmond and his confederate were on hand.</p>

<p>They did not look like the two boys as seen in the glare of Mr.
Grandin's parlors, for they had disguised themselves, so far as
possible, with a view of preventing their recognition by the boy
whom they meant to assault. They knew they were liable to get
themselves into trouble by such an outrageous violation of law,
and they meant to take all the precautions necessary.</p>

<p>Each had donned a long flapping overcoat, which must have belonged
to some of the older members of the families, as it dangled about
his heels. They also wore slouch hats like a couple of brigands,
which they pulled down over their eyes, so as to hide their features.
They had no weapons, for it was calculated that by springing upon
Ben unawares they would easily bear him to the pavement, when
both would give him a beating which he would remember for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Ben was whistling softly to himself, and he was glad that at
the late hour no one else was seen in the immediate neighborhood,
for all he asked was a clear field and no favor.</p>

<p>As he walked by the open end of Carter's Alley, he dimly discerned
two figures, which seemed plastered against the wall in the dense
shadow, where they were invisible to all passers-by, unless their
suspicion was directed to the spot.</p>

<p>Ben gave no evidence that he noticed them, and moved along in
his deliberate fashion, changing his whistling to a low humming
of no particular tune; but he used his keen eyesight and hearing
for all they were worth.</p>

<p>He had gone no more than a dozen feet beyond, when he heard a
rapid but cautious footstep behind him. It increased in swiftness,
and was instantly followed by a second. The two boys were approaching
him stealthily from the rear.</p>

<p>Still Ben walked quietly forward, humming to himself, and with
no apparent thought of what was coming. Suddenly, when Richmond
was in the very act of making a leap upon his shoulders, Ben turned
like a flash, and planted a stunning blow directly in the face
of the exultant coward, who was knocked on his back as if kicked
by a vigorous mule.</p>

<p>His companion was at the elbow of Richmond when struck in this
emphatic fashion, and for the instant was bewildered by the unexpected
catastrophe. Before he could recover he imagined the comet which
was expected at that season had caught him directly between the
eyes, and he went backward over Richmond, with his two legs pointing
upward, like a pair of dividers, toward the stars.</p>

<p>Ben's blood was up, and he waited for the two to rise, intending
to "lay them out" more emphatically than before. The lad whose
name he did not know lay still, but Rutherford recovered with
remarkable quickness, and began struggling to his feet, without
paying heed to his hat, which had rolled into the gutter.</p>

<p>"That ain't fair to strike a fellow that way, when he ain't expecting
it," growled the assassin. "Why didn't you stand still like a
man and not hit below the belt?"</p>

<p>"All right; I give you notice then, friend Rutherford, that I
am going for you again, and this time above the belt."</p>

<p>Richmond, finding he must fight, threw up his hands and did his
best to guard against the blows whose force he knew so well. He
did possess some knowledge of sparring, but so did Ben, who was
much the stronger and more active of the two. He advanced straight
upon Richmond, made several feints, and then landed a blow straight
from the shoulder, at the same time parrying the cross-counter
which the lad came near getting in on the face.</p>

<p>It so happened that, at that moment, the other young scamp was
in the act of rising, and had got upon his hands and knees. As
Richmond was sent spinning backward he came in collision with
him, and turned a complete somersault, the air seeming to be full
of legs, long hair, hats, and flapping overcoats.</p>

<p>"Murder! help! help! police! police!"</p>

<p>These startling cries were shouted at the top of their voices
by the discomfited poltroons, and were heard a long distance on
the still night. Suddenly the rattle of running feet sounded on
the planks of the bridge, and Ben caught sight of a policeman
running toward the spot.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he demanded, when he came face to face
with Ben, whom he motioned to stop.</p>

<p>"Those two fellows attacked me when I was passing Carter's Alley,
and <em>I&mdash;</em>well, I defended myself as best I could."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ben, that is you; I didn't know you at first," said the
policeman. "This is rather serious business; I'll run 'em in."</p>

<p>Advancing to where the boys were once more climbing to their
feet, he grasped each by the collar.</p>

<p>"I'll take you along with me, young gents; this is serious business
for you."</p>

<p>They begged piteously to be let off, declaring that it was only
a joke, but the officer was inexorable, and marched them to the
station house, where they spent the rest of the night, Ben Mayberry
having been notified to be on hand at nine o'clock the next morning,
when the police justice would make an investigation.</p>
