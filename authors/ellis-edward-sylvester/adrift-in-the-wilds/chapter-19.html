<p>Ned Trimble would not hear the repeated thanks of our friends,
but waved them an impressive and magnificent farewell as they
took their departure. They were not yet beyond sight of each other
when they heard him calling to them in excited tones, and the
next moment he came running after them.</p>

<p>"I think you said you was going to undertake to foller the river
down the valley, didn't you?"</p>

<p>They made answer that such was their intention, whereupon he
hastened to add:</p>

<p>"About a mile down, under some bushes that stick out by a big
rock, on the same side that you're traveling, is a little Injin
canoe that is just the thing you want. You're welcome to it."</p>

<p>"But how shall we thank you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; again, my noble friends, I bid thee farewell,
and if forever, still forever, fare thee well."</p>

<p>The eccentric miner lifted his hat, bowed very low, and sauntered
back to his friends with the air of a monarch who had just indulged
in some gracious act of condescension, while our friends, delighted
beyond measure, hurried forward on their journey.</p>

<p>They were now amply provided&mdash;each having a gun and plenty of
ammunition, and their faithful dog. They began to look upon themselves
as on a holiday excursion. The only thing was, that there was
rather too strong a tinge of danger about it. If they were but
a hundred or two miles nearer home, and their parents had no anxiety
regarding them, it would be more pleasant. But then, they could
easily understand how much worse it easily could be, and they
were heartfelt at the good fortune which had followed them thus
far on their strange entry into California. The most that they
could ask was that it might continue.</p>

<p>Elwood and Howard were anxious to test their marksmanship, but
prudence forbade it, as the chances were that they would need
all their ammunition, and the report of their guns might draw
inconvenient attention to themselves.</p>

<p>They were walking cheerily along when a singular object caught
their eyes. At first sight it resembled an Indian hut; but it
was much too small to be inhabited by a human being, and therefore
must have been the handiwork of some animal.</p>

<p>"Shall we batter it down?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"No; we do not know what is in it, and there is no use of wantonly
destroying the home of any dumb creature."</p>

<p>"It reminds me of me birthplace in ould Ireland," said Tim, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>But Terror was not so considerate as his masters; for bursting
forward he placed his snout at the lower orifice, snuffed furiously,
and then clawed so savagely that the greater part of the singular
fabric came tumbling to the ground. It was made of brush and twigs,
and like everything constructed by instinct, was put together
with great skill. Terror could not be restrained until he had
inflicted great injury.</p>

<p>"Look! what are they?" exclaimed Howard in astonishment. "What
strange-looking creatures!"</p>

<p>"Snapping tortles!" replied Tim, staring with an expression of
the greatest astonishment at the objects.</p>

<p>Three animals, about the size of a musk-rat, with webbed feet,
and the color of mice, came scrambling forth and scampered away
for the shelter of the rocks.</p>

<p>Terror by this time had been brought under restraint, and was
prevented from crushing them to death as they ran.</p>

<p>Great speculation was caused by their appearance, as none of
our friends had seen anything like them, nor had they ever heard
or read of such. They were, in fact, a species of mountain rat
living in the vicinity of mountains and constructing their singular-looking
huts with remarkable skill, often building them to a height of
six feet. Their fur is very fine, and the hunters and trappers
frequently take the animals for their coats, although their diminutive
size, when compared with the beaver, otter, and other fur-bearing
animals, prevents their being much in demand.</p>

<p>The hunters, as perhaps it is proper to term them, were too anxious
to discover the canoe to pause long at any curiosity unless it
was something extraordinary. They carefully noted the distance
they journeyed, and when they judged they had gone about a mile,
stepped into the edge of the river and looked about them. But
they saw nothing answering to Ned Trimble's description of the
hiding-place of the boat.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he was jesting," remarked Elwood.</p>

<p>"No; I think he is too kind-hearted for that. He may have been
mistaken as to whether it is precisely a mile or not."</p>

<p>"Whist! but it strikes me that the bushes are rather thick just
ayonst you."</p>

<p>Tim pointed to a spot a hundred rods away which had failed to
arrest their attention. There was nothing unusual, except mayhap
that the overhanging shrubbery was rather denser than usual; but
it held out hope, and the party hurried pell-mell to the spot.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, they descried the rock, and lifting the bushes,
caught sight of the small, delicate canoe concealed beneath. Elwood
was in the advance, and quickly pulled it forth with the wildest
expressions of delight.</p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid!" he fairly shouted. "And here is a long paddle.
Our work is now done."</p>

<p>"Do yees jist stand up in the same," said Tim, "and see what
a beautiful rest it gives to the faat."</p>

<p>The impulsive boy caught up the paddle, and rose to his feet;
but it was like unto him who first puts on skates. It flashed
from beneath him, and he was precipitated headlong into the water.
The others, as a matter of course, laughed.</p>

<p>"That was done on purpose," said Elwood as he clambered to his
feet again.</p>

<p>"I wished to give yees a little insthruction, and that was me
first lesson."</p>

<p>"Well, I learned considerable at any rate."</p>

<p>The canoe was caught, and the three carefully entered and seated
themselves. It was made of bark, bound together with cord and
gum, and would have held double their weight, being very light
and buoyant.</p>

<p>A vast amount of sport was afforded the party in learning to
navigate the frail vessel. Tim had had some experience in the
matter, and could propel it quite dexterously; but the boys were
much at fault: they expended far more strength than there was
any need for, and soon exhausted themselves so thoroughly that
they were obliged to relinquish the sole management of the boat
into the hands of Tim O'Rooney.</p>

<p>"There's a bootiful current here," said he, "and we can have
the illegant pleasure of moving along without working ourselves,
as me frind, Michael McGubbens, said when they carried him off
to Botany Bay."</p>

<p>The Irishman first dipped his paddle upon the one side and then
upon the other, and imparted quite a velocity to the canoe. The
boys were so pleased with the easy, gliding motion that they failed
to notice the shores they were passing between. When finally Tim
lay down his paddle and rested they were charmed.</p>

<p>All were tired enough to make them enjoy this relaxation and
the sensation of floating so idly forward. The sky was clear and
almost free of clouds, the dry air was not uncomfortably warm,
and an occasional breeze that came floating apparently from the
snowy peaks of the Coast Range imparted delicious coolness. On
the left stretched the high hills intervening between them and
the Pacific, and on the right rose the vast Coast Mountains, forming
in its extensive line some of the finest scenery on the North
American Continent.</p>

<p>By-and-by, as they rounded a bend in the river, a small island
appeared near the center of the channel.</p>

<p>"There we will rest," said Howard.</p>

<p>A half-hour later the canoe lightly touched the shore, and springing
out they pulled it up on the land after them. They had scarcely
done so when a groan very near them startled them all.</p>

<p>"Whisht!" whispered Tim; "there's somebody else beside us on
this island."</p>
