Graham's last impression before he fainted was of
a clamorous ringing of bells. He learnt afterwards that
he was insensible, hanging between life and death, for
the better part of an hour. When he recovered his
senses, he was back on his translucent couch, and
there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat. The
dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed from
his arm, which was bandaged. The white framework
was still about him, but the greenish transparent 
substance that had filled it was altogether gone. A man
in a deep violet robe, one of those who had been on
the balcony, was looking keenly into his face.
<P>
Remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and
confused sounds, that suggested to his mind the 
picture of a great number of people shouting together.
Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a
door suddenly closed.
<P>
Graham moved his head. "What does this all
mean?" he said slowly. "Where am I?"
<P>
He saw the red-haired man who had been first to
discover him. A voice seemed to be asking what he
had said, and was abruptly stilled.
<P>
The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking
English with a slightly foreign accent, or so at least
it seemed to the Sleeper's ears, "You are quite safe.
<P>
You were brought hither from where you fell asleep.
It is quite safe. You have been here some time--
sleeping. In a trance."
<P>
He said something further that Graham could not
hear, and a little phial was handed across to him.
Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist played
over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of
refreshment increased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.
<P>
" Better?" asked the man in violet, as Graham's
eyes reopened. He was a pleasant-faced man of
thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and a
clasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe.
<P>
"Yes," said Graham.
<P>
"You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic
trance. You have heard? Catalepsy? It may seem
strange to you at first, but I can assure you everything
is well."
<P>
Graham did not answer, but these words served
their reassuring purpose. His eyes went from face
to face of the three people about him. They were
regarding him strangely. He knew he ought to be
somewhere in Cornwall, but he could not square these
things with that impression.
<P>
A matter that had been in his mind during his last
waking moments at Boscastle recurred, a thing resolved
upon and somehow neglected. He cleared his
throat.
<P>
"Have you wired my cousin?" he asked. "E.
Warming, 27, Chancery Lane? "
<P>
They were all assiduous to hear. But he had to
repeat it. "What an odd __blurr__ in his accent!" 
whispered the red-haired man. "Wire, sir?" said the
young man with the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.
<P>
"He means send an electric telegram," volunteered
the third, a pleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty.
The flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension.
"How stupid of me! You may be sure everything
shall be done, sir," he said to Graham. "I am afraid
it would be difficult to--wire to your cousin. He is
not in London now. But don't trouble about arrangements 
yet; you have been asleep a very long time and
the important thing is to get over that, sir." (Graham
concluded the word was sir, but this man pronounced
it "Sire.")
<P>
"Oh!" said Graham, and became quiet.
<P>
It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people
in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about. Yet
they were odd and the room was odd. It seemed he
was in some newly established place. He had a sudden
flash of suspicion. Surely this wasn't some hall
of public exhibition! If it was he would give Warming 
a piece of his mind. But it scarcely had that
character. And in a place of public exhibition he
would not have discovered himself naked.
<P>
Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had
happened. There was no perceptible interval of suspicion, 
no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly he
knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as
if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted
the awe in the faces that peered into his. He looked
at them strangely, full of intense emotion. It seemed
they read his eyes. He framed his lips to speak and
could not. A queer impulse to hide his knowledge
came into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery. 
He looked at his bare feet, regarding then
silently. His impulse to speak passed. He was
trembling exceedingly.
<P>
They gave him some pink fluid with a greenish
fluorescence and a meaty taste, and the assurance of
returning strength grew.
<P>
"That--that makes me feel better," he said
hoarsely, and there were murmurs of respectful
approval. He knew now quite clearly. He made to
speak again, and again he could not.
<P>
He pressed his throat and tried a third time.
<P>
"How long? " he asked in a level voice. "How long
have I been asleep? "
<P>
"Some considerable time," said the flaxen-bearded
man, glancing quickly at the others.
<P>
"How long? "
<P>
"A very long time."
<P>
"Yes--yes," said Graham, suddenly testy. "But
I want-- Is it--it is--some years? Many years?
There was something--I forget what. I feel--
confused. But you--" He sobbed. "You need
not fence with me. How long--?"
<P>
He stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed
his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an
answer.
<P>
They spoke in undertones.
<P>
"Five or six?" he asked faintly. "More?"
<P>
"Very much more than that."
<P>
"Morel "
<P>
"More."
<P>
He looked at them and it seemed as though imps
were twitching the muscles of his face. He looked
his question.
<P>
"Many years," said the man with the red beard.
<P>
Graham struggled into a sitting position. He
wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand.
"Many years!" he repeated. He shut his eyes tight,
opened them, and sat looking about him, from one
unfamiliar thing to another.
<P>
"How many years?" he asked.
<P>
"You must be prepared to be surprised."
<P>
"Well? "
<P>
"More than a gross of years."
<P>
He was irritated at the strange word." More than
a __what__?"
<P>
Two of them spoke together. Some quick remarks
that were made about "decimal" he did not catch.
<P>
"How long did you say? " asked Graham. "How
long? Don't look like that. Tell me."
<P>
Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught
six words: "More than a couple of centuries."
<P>
__"Whats?"__ he cried, turning on the youth who he
thought had spoken. "Who says--? What was
that? A couple of centuries!"
<P>
"Yes," said the man with the red beard. "Two
hundred years."
<P>
Graham repeated the words. He had been prepared
to hear of a vast repose, and yet these concrete
centuries defeated him.
<P>
"Two hundred years," he said again, with the figure
of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind; and
then, "Oh, but--!"
<P>
They said nothing.
<P>
"You--did you say--? "
<P>
"Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,"
said the man with the red beard.
<P>
There was a pause. Graham looked at their faces
and saw that what he had heard was indeed true.
<P>
"But it can't be," he said querulously. "I am
dreaming. Trances. Trances don't last. That is not
right--this is a joke you have played upon me! Tell
me--some days ago, perhaps, I was walking along
the coast of Cornwall--? "
<P>
His voice failed him.
<P>
The man with the flaxen beard hesitated. "I'm
not very strong in history, sir," he said weakly, and
glanced at the others.
<P>
"That was it, sir," said the youngster. "Boscastle,
in the old Duchy of Cornwall--it's in the southwest
country beyond the dairy meadows. There is a house
there still. I have been there."
<P>
"Boscastle!" Graham turned his eyes to the
youngster. "That was it--Boscastle. Little Boscastle. 
I fell asleep--somewhere there. I don't
exactly remember. I don't exactly remember."
<P>
He pressed his brows and whispered," More than
two hundred years!"                I
<P>
He began to speak quickly with a twitching face,
but his heart was cold within him. "But if it is two
hundred years, every soul I know, every human being
that ever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep,
must be dead."
<P>
They did not answer him.
<P>
"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers,
of Church and State. High and low, rich and poor, one
with another--"
<P>
"Is there England still?"
<P>
"That's a comfort! Is there London?"
E "This __is__ London, eh? And you are my assistant--
custodian; assistant-custodian. And these--? Eh?
Assistant-custodians to?"
<P>
He sat with a gaunt stare on his face. "But why
am I here? No! Don't talk. Be quiet. Let me--"
<P>
He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them,
found another little glass of pinkish fluid held towards
him. He took the dose. It was almost immediately
sustaining. Directly he had taken it he began to weep
naturally and refreshingly.
<P>
Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed
through his tears, a little foolishly. "But--two--
hun--dred--years ! " he said. He grimaced hysterically 
and covered up his face again.
<P>
After a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands
hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same
attitude in which Isbister had found him on the cliff
at Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick
domineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage. 
"What are you doing? Why was I not
warned? Surely you could tell? Someone will suffer
for this. The man must be kept quiet. Are the 
doorways closed? All the doorways? He must be kept
perfectly quiet. He must not be told. Has he been
told anything?"
<P>
The man with the fair beard made some inaudible
remark, and Graham looking over his shoulder saw
approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless
man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin.
Very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that
almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey
eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression.
He scowled momentarily at Graham and then his
regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard.
"These others," he said in a voice of extreme 
irritation. "You had better go."
<P>
"Go? " said the red-bearded man.
<P>
"Certainly--go now. But see the doorways are
closed as you go."
<P>
The two men addressed turned obediently, after one
reluctant glance at Graham, and instead of going
through the archway as he expected, walked straight
to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. 
And then came a strange thing; a long strip
of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap,
hung over the two retreating men and fell again, and
immediately Graham was alone with the new comer
and the purple-robed man with the flaxen beard.
<P>
For a space the thickset man took not the slightest
notice of Graham, but proceeded to interrogate the
other--obviously his subordinate--upon the treatment 
of their charge. He spoke clearly, but in
phrases only partially intelligible to Graham. The
awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but
of consternation and annoyance to him. He was evidently 
profoundly excited.
<P>
"You must not confuse his mind by telling him
things," he repeated again and again. "You must not
confuse his mind."
<P>
His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed
the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression.
<P>
"Feel queer? " he asked.
<P>
"Very."
<P>
"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to
you? "
<P>
"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems."
<P>
"I suppose so, now."
<P>
"In the first place, hadn't I better have some
clothes? "
<P>
"They--" said the thickset man and stopped, and
the flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went away.
"You will very speedily have clothes," said the thickset 
man.
<P>
"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two
hundred--?" asked Graham.
<P>
"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred 
and three, as a matter of fact."
<P>
Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised
eyebrows and depressed mouth. He sat silent for a
moment, and then asked a question, "Is there a mill
or dynamo near here?" He did not wait for an
answer. "Things have changed tremendously, I
suppose?" he said.
<P>
"What is that shouting? " he asked abruptly.
<P>
"Nothing," said the thickset man impatiently.
"It's people. You'll understand better later--perhaps. 
As you say, things have changed." He spoke
shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about
him like a man trying to decide in an emergency.
"We must get you clothes and so forth, at any rate.
<P>
Better wait here until some can come. No one will
come near you. You want shaving."
<P>
Graham rubbed his chin.
<P>
The man with the flaxen beard came back towards
them, turned suddenly, listened for a moment, lifted
his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through
the archway towards the balcony. The tumult of
shouting grew louder, and the thickset man turned and
listened also. He cursed suddenly under his breath,
and turned his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly
expression. It was a surge of many voices, rising and
falling, shouting and screaming, and once came a
sound like blows and sharp cries, and then a snapping 
like the crackling of dry sticks. Graham
strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound
from the woven tumult.
<P>
Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a 
certain formula. For a time he doubted his ears. But
surely these were the words: " how us the Sleeper!
Show us the Sleeper!"
<P>
The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.
<P>
"Wild! " he cried, "How do they know? Do they
know? Or is it guessing? "
<P>
There was perhaps an answer.
<P>
"I can't come," said the thickset man; "I have __him__
to see to. But shout from the balcony."
<P>
There was an inaudible reply.
<P>
"Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to
you."
<P>
He came hurrying back to Graham. "You must
have clothes at once," he said. "You cannot stop
here--and it will be impossible to--"
<P>
He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered
questions after him. In a moment he was back.
<P>
"I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex 
to explain. In a moment you shall have your
clothes made. Yes--in a moment. And then I can
take you away from here. You will find out our
troubles soon enough."
<P>
"But those voices. They were shouting--?"
<P>
"Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They
have some twisted idea. I don't know what it is. I
know nothing."
<P>
A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling 
of remote noises, and this brusque person sprang
to a little group of appliances in the corner of the
room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of
crystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then
he walked to the wall through which the two men had
vanished. It rolled up again like a curtain, and he
stood waiting.
<P>
Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find
what strength the restoratives had given him. He
thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the
other. His head no longer swam. He could scarcely
credit his rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.
<P>
The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the
archway, and as he did so the cage of a lift came
sliding down in front of the thickset man, and a lean,
grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a
tightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.
<P>
"This is the tailor," said the thickset man with an
introductory gesture." It will never do for you to
wear that black. I cannot understand how it got here.
But I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid as possible? " 
he said to the tailor.
<P>
The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated
himself by Graham on the bed. His manner was
calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. "You will
find the fashions altered, Sire," he said. He glanced
from under his brows at the thickset man.  ,
<P>
He opened the roller with a quick movement, and a
confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his knees.
"You lived, Sire, in a period essentially cylindrical--
the Victorian. With a tendency to the hemisphere in
hats. Circular curves always. Now--" He flicked
out a little appliance the size and appearance of a 
keyless watch, whirled the knob, and behold--a little
figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the
dial, walking and turning. The tailor caught up a
pattern of bluish white satin. "That is my conception
of your immediate treatment," he said.
<P>
The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder
of Graham.
<P>
"We have very little time," he said.
<P>
"Trust me," said the tailor. "My machine follows.
What do you think of this? "
<P>
"What is that?" asked the man from the nineteenth
century.
<P>
"In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,"
said the tailor," but this is our modern development
See here." The little figure repeated its evolutions,
but in a different costume. "Or this," and with a
click another small figure in a more voluminous type
of robe marched on to the dial. The tailor was very
quick in his movements, and glanced twice towards
the lift as he did these things.
<P>
It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad
with features of the Chinese type, clad in coarse
pale blue canvas, appeared together with a complicated 
machine, which he pushed noiselessly on
little castors into the room. Incontinently the little
kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was invited to
stand in front of the machine and the tailor
muttered some instructions to the crop-haired lad,
who answered in guttural tones and with words
Graham did not recognise. The boy then went
to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the
corner, and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted
arms terminating in little discs, pulling them out until
the discs were flat against the body of Graham, one
at each shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the
neck and so forth, so that at last there were, perhaps,
two score of them upon his body and limbs. At the
same time, some other person entered the room by the
lift, behind Graham. The tailor set moving a mechanism 
that initiated a faint-sounding rhythmic movement
of parts in the machine, and in another moment he was
knocking up the levers and Graham was released. The
tailor replaced his cloak of black, and the man with
the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some
refreshing fluid. Graham saw over the rim of the
glass a pale-faced young man regarding him with a
singular fixity.
<P>
The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, 
and now turned and went through the archway
towards the balcony, from which the noise of a distant
crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The cropheaded 
lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin
and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a
manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth
century printing machine. Then they ran the entire
thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the room
to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather
gracefully from the wall. They made some connexion
and the machine became energetic and swift.
<P>
"What is that doing?" asked Graham, pointing
with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying
to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. " Is that--
some sort of force--laid on? "
<P>
"Yes," said the man with the flaxen beard.
<P>
"Who is that?" He indicated the archway behind
him.
<P>
The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated,
and answered in an undertone, "He is Howard, your
chief guardian. You see, Sire,--it's a little difficult
to explain. The Council appoints a guardian and
assistants. This hall has under certain restrictions
been public. In order that people might satisfy themselves. 
We have barred the doorways for the first
time. But I think--if you don't mind, I will leave
him to explain."
<P>
"Odd" said Graham. " Guardian? Council?"
Then turning his back on the new comer, he asked
in an undertone, "Why is this man glaring at me?
Is he a mesmerist? "
<P>
"Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist."
<P>
"Capillotomist!"
<P>
"Yes--one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz
lions."
<P>
It sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at
the last phrase with an unsteady mind. "Sixdoz
lions?" he said.
<P>
"Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had
the old pounds? They are our monetary units."
<P>
"But what was that you said--sixdoz? "
<P>
"Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even
these little things, have altered. You lived in the days
of the decimal system, the Arab system--tens, and
little hundreds and thousands. We have eleven
numerals now. We have single figures for both ten
and eleven, two figures for a dozen, and a dozen dozen
makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a dozen
gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad. Very
simple?"
<P>
"I suppose so," said Graham. "But about this
cap--what was it? "
<P>
The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his
shoulder.
<P>
"Here are your clothes!" he said. Graham turned
round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow
smiling, and holding some palpably new garments over
his arm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one
finger, was impelling the complicated machine towards
the lift by which he had arrived. Graham stared at
the completed suit. "You don't mean to say--!"
<P>
"Just made," said the tailor. He dropped the garments 
at the feet of Graham, walked to the bed on
which Graham had so recently been Iying, flung out
the translucent mattress, and turned up the looking
glass. As he did so a furious bell summoned the
thickset man to the corner. The man with the flaxen
beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by
the archway.
<P>
The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple
combination garment, stockings, vest, and pants in
one, as the thickset man came back from the corner
to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from
the balcony. They began speaking quickly in an
undertone, their bearing had an unmistakable quality
of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment came a I
complex but graceful garment of bluish white, and I
Graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw
himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and shaggy still, but
at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable
unprecedented way graceful.
<P>
"I must shave," he said regarding himself in the
glass.
<P>
"In a moment," said Howard.
<P>
The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed
his eyes, reopened them, and with a lean hand
extended, advanced on Graham. Then he stopped,
with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about
him.
<P>
"A seat," said Howard impatiently, and in a moment
the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind Graham.
"Sit down, please," said Howard.
<P>
Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed 
man he saw the glint of steel.
<P>
"Don't you understand, Sire?" cried the flaxen-bearded 
man with hurried politeness. "He is going
to cut your hair."
<P>
"Oh!" cried Graham enlightened. "But you
called him--
<P>
"A capillotomist--precisely ! He is one of the
finest artists in the world."
<P>
Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded
man disappeared. The capillotomist came forward
with graceful gestures, examined Graham's ears and
surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would
have sat down again to regard him but for Howard's
audible impatience. Forthwith with rapid movements
and a succession of deftly handled implements he
shaved Graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut
and arranged his hair. All this he did without a word,
with something of the rapt air of a poet inspired. And
as soon as he had finished Graham was handed a pair
of shoes.
<P>
Suddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a
piece of machinery in the corner--"At once--at
once. The people know all over the city. Work is
being stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait for
nothing, but come."
<P>
This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. 
By his gestures it seemed to Graham that he
hesitated between two directions. Abruptly he went
towards the corner where the apparatus stood about
the little crystal ball. As he did so the undertone of
tumultuous shouting from the archway that had continued 
during all these occurrences rose to a mighty
sound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell
again as if receding swiftly. It drew Graham after it
with an irresistible attraction. He glanced at the
thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse. In two
strides he was down the steps and in the passage, and,
in a score he was out upon the balcony upon which |
the three men had been standing.
