<p>When Malcourt arrived at Luckless Lake Sunday evening he found
Portlaw hunched up in an arm-chair, all alone in the living-room,
although the hour was still early.</p>

<p>"Where's your very agreeable house-party?" he inquired, looking
about the empty room and hall with an air of troubled surprise.</p>

<p>"Gone to bed," replied Portlaw irritably,&mdash;"what's left of 'em."
And he continued reading "The Pink 'Un."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Malcourt in polite concern.</p>

<p>"Yes, really!" snapped Portlaw. "Mrs. Ascott went to Pride's
and took Wayward and Constance Palliser; that was Friday. And
Gray and Cecile joined them yesterday. It's been a horrible house-party;
nobody had any use for anybody else and it has rained every day
and&mdash;and&mdash;to be plain with you, Louis, nobody is enchanted with
your relatives and that's the unpleasant truth!"</p>

<p>"I don't blame anybody," returned Malcourt sincerely, removing
his driving-gloves and shaking off his wet box-coat. "Why, I can
scarcely stand them myself, William. Where are they?"</p>

<p>"In the west wing of your house&mdash;preparing to remain indefinitely."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Malcourt. "What on earth shall we do?"
And he peered sideways at Portlaw with his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<p>"Do? <em>I</em> don't know. Why the devil did you suggest that
they stop at your house?"</p>

<p>"Because, William, curious as it may seem, I had a sort of weak-minded
curiosity to see my sister once more." He walked over to the table,
took a cigarette and lighted it, then stood regarding the burning
match in his fingers. "She's the last of the family; I'll probably
never see her again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She appears to be in excellent health," remarked Portlaw viciously.</p>

<p>"So am I; but&mdash;" He shrugged and tossed the embers of the match
onto the hearth.</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to take a vacation pretty soon&mdash;a sort of voyage,
and a devilish long one, William. That's why I wanted to see her
again."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you are going away?" demanded the other
indignantly.</p>

<p>Malcourt laughed. "Oh, yes. I planned it long ago&mdash;one morning
toward daybreak years ago.... <em>A&mdash;</em>a relative of mine started
on the same voyage rather unexpectedly.... I've heard very often
from him since; I'm curious to try it, too&mdash;when he makes up his
mind to invite me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When are you starting?" interrupted Portlaw, disgusted.</p>

<p>"Oh, not for a while, I think. I won't embarrass you; I'll leave
everything in ship-shape&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Where</em> are you going?&mdash;dammit!"</p>

<p>Malcourt looked at him humorously, head on one side. "I am not
perfectly sure, dear friend. I hate to know all about a thing
before I do it. Otherwise there's no sporting interest in it."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that you're going off a-gipsying without
any definite plans?"</p>

<p>"Gipsying?" he laughed. "Well, that may perhaps describe it.
I don't know; I have no plans. That's the charm of it. When one
grows tired, that is the restful part of it&mdash;to simply start,
having no plans; just to leave, and drift away haphazard. One
is always bound to arrive somewhere, William."</p>

<p>He had been pacing backward and forward, the burning cigarette
balanced between his fingers, turning his handsome head from time
to time to answer Portlaw's ill-tempered questions. Now he halted,
dark eyes roving about the room. They fell and lingered on a card-table
where some empty glasses decorated the green baize top.</p>

<p>"Bridge?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," growled Portlaw.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Malcourt and I versus your&mdash;ah&mdash;talented family."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Malcourt doesn't gamble."</p>

<p>"Tressilvain and I did."</p>

<p>"Were you badly stung, dear friend?"</p>

<p>Portlaw muttered.</p>

<p>Malcourt lifted his expressive eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you try my talented relative again to-night?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Malcourt had enough," said Portlaw briefly; then mumbled
something injuriously unintelligible.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go over to the house and see if my gifted brother-in-law
has retired," said Malcourt, adding carelessly, "I suppose Mrs.
Malcourt is asleep."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't surprise me," replied Portlaw. And Malcourt was
free to interpret the remark as he chose.</p>

<p>He went away thoughtfully, crossing the lawn in the rainy darkness,
and came to the garden where his own dogs barked at him&mdash;a small
thing to depress a man, but it did; and it was safer for the dogs,
perhaps, that they sniffed recognition before they came too near
with their growls and barking. But he opened the gate, disdaining
to speak to them, and when they knew him, it was a pack of very
humble, wet, and penitent hounds that came wagging up alongside.
He let them wag unnoticed.</p>

<p>Lights burned in his house, one in Shiela's apartments, several
in the west wing where the Tressilvains were housed. A servant,
locking up for the night, came across the dripping veranda to
admit him; and he went upstairs and knocked at his wife's door.</p>

<p>Shiela's maid opened, hesitated; and a moment later Shiela appeared,
fully dressed, a book in her hand. It was one of Hamil's architectural
volumes.</p>

<p>"Well, Shiela," he said lightly; "I got in to-night and rather
expected to see somebody; but nobody waited up to see me! I'm
rather wet&mdash;it's raining&mdash;so I won't trouble you. I only wanted
to say good night."</p>

<p>The quick displeasure in her face died out. She dismissed the
maid, and came slowly forward. Beneath the light her face looked
much thinner; he noticed dark shadows under the eyes; the eyes
themselves seemed tired and expressionless.</p>

<p>"Aren't you well?" he asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Perfectly.... Was it you the dogs were so noisy about just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it seems that even my own dogs resent my return. Well&mdash;good
night. I'm glad you're all right."</p>

<p>Something in his voice, more than in the words, arrested her
listless attention.</p>

<p>"Will you come in, Louis?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm keeping you awake. Besides I'm wet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come in and tell me where you've been&mdash;if you care to. Would
you like some tea&mdash;or something?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, but followed her into the small receiving-room.
There he declined an offered chair.</p>

<p>"I've been in New York.... No, I did not see your family....
As for what I've been doing&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her lifted eyes betrayed no curiosity; a growing sense of depression
crept over him.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "it doesn't matter." And turned toward the
door.</p>

<p>She looked into the empty fireplace with a sigh; then, gently,
"I don't mean to make it any drearier for you than I can help."</p>

<p>He considered her a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you really well, Shiela?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; only a little tired. I do not sleep well."</p>

<p>He nodded toward the west wing of the house.</p>

<p>"Do <em>they</em> bother you?"</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>He said: "Thank you for putting them up. We'll get rid of them
if they annoy you."</p>

<p>"They are quite welcome."</p>

<p>"That's very decent of you, Shiela. I dare say you have not found
them congenial."</p>

<p>"We have nothing in common. I think they consider me a fool."</p>

<p>"Why?" He looked up, keenly humourous.</p>

<p>"Because I don't understand their inquiries. Besides, I don't
gamble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What kind of inquiries do they make?"</p>

<p>"Personal ones," she said quietly.</p>

<p>He laughed. "They're probably more offensively impertinent than
the Chinese&mdash;that sort of Briton. I think I'll step into the west
wing and greet my relations. I won't impose them on you for very
long. Do you know when they are going?"</p>

<p>"I think they have made plans to remain here for a while."</p>

<p>"Really?" he sneered. "Well, leave that to me, Shiela."</p>

<p>So he crossed into the western wing and found the Tressilvains
tête-à-tête over a card-table, deeply interested in something
that resembled legerdemain; and he stood at the door and watched
them with a smile that was not agreeable.</p>

<p>"Well, Helen!" he said at last; and Lady Tressilvain started,
and her husband rose to the full height of his five feet nothing,
dropping the pack which he had been so nimbly manipulating for
his wife's amusement.</p>

<p>"Where the devil did you come from?" blurted his lordship; but
his wife made a creditable appearance in her rôle of surprised
sisterly affection; and when the two men had gone through the
form of family greeting they all sat down for the conventional
family confab.</p>

<p>Tressilvain said little but drank a great deal of whisky&mdash;his
long, white, bony fingers were always spread around his glass&mdash;unusually
long fingers for such a short man, and out of all proportion to
the scant five-foot frame, topped with a little pointed head,
in which the eyes were set exactly as glass eyes are screwed into
the mask of a fox.</p>

<p>"Bertie and I have been practising leads from trick hands," observed
Lady Tressilvain, removing the ice from her glass and filling
it from a soda bottle which Malcourt uncorked for her.</p>

<p>"Well, Herby," said Malcourt genially, "I suppose you and Helen
play a game well worth&mdash;ah&mdash;watching."</p>

<p>Tressilvain looked dully annoyed, although there was nothing
in his brother-in-law's remark to ruffle anybody, except that
his lordship did not like to be called Herby. He sat silent, caressing
his glass; and presently his little black eyes stole around in
Malcourt's direction, and remained there, waveringly, while brother
and sister discussed the former's marriage, the situation at Luckless
Lake, and future prospects.</p>

<p>That is to say, Lady Tressilvain did the discussing; Malcourt,
bland, amiable, remained uncommunicatively polite, parrying everything
so innocently that his sister, deceived, became plainer in her
questions concerning the fortune he was supposed to have married,
and more persistent in her suggestions of a winter in New York&mdash;a
delightful and prolonged family reunion, in which the Tressilvains
were to figure as distinguished guests and virtual pensioners
of everybody connected with his wife's family.</p>

<p>"Do you think," drawled Malcourt, intercepting a furtive glance
between his sister and brother-in-law, to that gentleman's slight
confusion, "do you think it might prove interesting to you and
Herby? Americans are so happy to have your countrymen to entertain&mdash;particularly
when their credentials are as unquestionable as Herby's and yours."</p>

<p>For a full minute, in strained silence, the concentrated gaze
of the Tressilvains was focused upon the guileless countenance
of Malcourt; and discovered nothing except a fatuous cordiality.</p>

<p>Lady Tressilvain drew a deep, noiseless breath and glanced at
her husband.</p>

<p>"I don't understand, Louis, exactly what settlement&mdash;what sort
of arrangement you made when you married this&mdash;very interesting
young girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't have anything to endow her with," said Malcourt,
so amiably stupid that his sister bit her lip.</p>

<p>Tressilvain essayed a jest.</p>

<p>"Rather good, that!" he said with his short, barking laugh; "but
I da'say the glove was on the other hand, eh, Louis?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why the&mdash;ah&mdash;the lady did the endowing and all that, don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"See what?" asked Malcourt so pleasantly that his sister shot
a look at her husband which checked him.</p>

<p>Malcourt was now on maliciously humourous terms with himself;
he began to speak impulsively, affectionately, with all the appearance
of a garrulous younger brother impatient to unbosom himself to
his family; and he talked and talked, confidingly, guilelessly,
voluminously, yet managed to say absolutely nothing. And, strain
their ears as they might, the Tressilvains in their perplexity
and increasing impatience could make out nothing of all this voluntary
information&mdash;understand nothing&mdash;pick out not one single fact
to satisfy their desperately hungry curiosity.</p>

<p>There was no use interrupting him with questions; he answered
them with others; he whispered ambiguities in a manner most portentous;
hinted at bewildering paradoxes with an air; nodded mysterious
nothings, and finally left them gaping at him, exasperated, unable
to make any sense out of what most astonishingly resembled a candid
revelation of the hopes, fears, ambitions, and worldly circumstances
of Louis Malcourt.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said, lingering at the door to look upon and
enjoy the fruit of his perversity and malice. "When I start on
that journey I mentioned to you I'll leave something for you and
Herby&mdash;merely to show you how much I think of my own people&mdash;a
little gift&mdash;a trifle! No&mdash;no!"&mdash;lifting his hand with smiling
depreciation as Tressilvain began to thank him. "One must look
out for one's own family. It's natural&mdash;only natural to make some
provision. Good-night, Helen! Good-night, Herby. Portlaw and I
will take you on at Bridge if it rains to-morrow. It will be a
privilege for us to&mdash;ah&mdash;watch your game&mdash;closely. Good-night!"</p>

<p>And closed the door.</p>

<p>"What the devil does he mean?" demanded Tressilvain, peering
sideways at his wife.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know," she said thoughtfully, sorting the cards.
She added: "If we play to-morrow you stick to signals; do you
understand? And keep your ring and your fingers off the cards
until I can make up my mind about my brother. You're a fool to
drink American whisky the way you did yesterday. Mr. Portlaw noticed
the roughness on the aces; you pricked them too deep. You'd better
keep your wits about you, I can tell you. I'm a Yankee myself."</p>

<p>"Right &mdash;O! But I say, Helen, I'm damned if I make out that
brother of yours. Doesn't he live in the same house as his wife?"</p>

<p>Lady Tressilvain sat listening to the uproar from the dogs as
Malcourt left the garden. But this time the outbreak was only
a noisy welcome; and Malcourt, on excellent terms with himself,
patted every sleek, wet head thrust up for caresses and walked
gaily on through the driving rain.</p>

<p>The rain continued the following day. Piloted by Malcourt, the
Tressilvains, thickly shod and water-proofed, tramped about with
rod and creel and returned for luncheon where their blunt criticisms
on the fishing aroused Portlaw's implacable resentment. For they
sneered at the trout, calling them "char," patronised the rather
scanty pheasantry, commented on the kennels, stables, and gardens
in a manner that brought the red into Portlaw's face and left
him silent while luncheon lasted.</p>

<p>After luncheon Tressilvain tried the billiards, but found the
game inferior to the English game. So he burrowed into a box of
cigars, established himself before the fire with all the newspapers,
deploring the fact that the papers were not worth reading.</p>

<p>Lady Tressilvain cornered Shiela and badgered her and stared
at her until she dared not lift her hot face or open her lips
lest the pent resentment escape; Portlaw smoked a pipe&mdash;a sure
indication of smouldering wrath; Malcourt, at a desk, blew clouds
of smoke from his cigarette and smilingly continued writing to
his attorney:</p>

<p>   "This is the general idea for the document, and it's up to
you to    fix it up and make it legal, and have it ready for me
when I come    to town.</p>

<p>   "1st. I want to leave all my property to a Miss Dorothy or
Dolly    Wilming; and I want you to sell off everything after
my death and    invest the proceeds for her because it's all she'll
have to live    on except what she gets by her own endeavours.
This, in case I    suddenly snuff out.</p>

<p>   "2d. I want to leave my English riding-crop, spurs, bridle,
and    saddle to a Miss Virginia Suydam. Fix it legally.</p>

<p>   "3d. Here is a list of eighteen ladies. Each is to have one
of my    eighteen Chinese gods.</p>

<p>   "4th. To my wife I leave the nineteenth god. Mr. Hamil has
it in    his possession. I have no right to dispose of it, but
he will    have some day.</p>

<p>   "5th. To John Garret Hamil, 3d, I leave my volume of Jean
DuMont,    the same being an essay on Friendship.</p>

<p>   "6th. To my friend, William Van Bueren Portlaw, I leave my
dogs,    rods, and guns with a recommendation that he use them
and his    legs.</p>

<p>   "7th. To my sister, Lady Tressilvain, I leave my book of comic   
Bridge rules, and to her husband a volume of Methodist hymns.</p>

<p>   "I'll be in town again, shortly, and expect you to have my
will    ready to be signed and witnessed. One ought always to
be    prepared, particularly when in excellent health.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>   "<em>P.S. I </em>enclose a check for the Greenlawn Cemetery
people. I wish    you'd see that they keep the hedge properly
trimmed around my    father's plot and renew the dead sod where
needed. I noticed that    one of the trees was also dead. Have
them put in another and keep    the flowers in good shape. I don't

<p>
"<em>L.M</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>When he had sealed and directed his letter he looked around the
silent room. Shiela was sewing by the window. Portlaw, back to
the fire, stood staring out at the rain; Lady Tressilvain, a cigarette
between her thin lips, wandered through the work-shop and loading-room
where, from hooks in the ceiling, a thicket of split-cane rod-joints
hung, each suspended by a single strong thread.</p>

<p>The loading-room was lined with glass-faced cases containing
fowling-pieces, rifles, reels, and the inevitable cutlery and
ironmongery associated with utensils for the murder of wild creatures.
Tressilvain sat at the loading-table to which he was screwing
a delicate vise to hold hooks; for Malcourt had given him a lesson
in fly-tying, and he meant to dress a dozen to try on Painted
Creek.</p>

<p>So he sorted snell and hook and explored the tin trunk for hackles,
silks, and feathers, up to his bony wrists in the fluffy heap
of brilliant plumage, burrowing, busy as a burying beetle under
a dead bird.</p>

<p>Malcourt dropped his letter into the post-box, glanced uncertainly
in the direction of his wife, but as she did not lift her head
from her sewing, turned with a shrug and crossed the floor to
where Portlaw stood scowling and sucking at his empty pipe.</p>

<p>"Look at that horrid little brother-in-law of mine with his ferret
eyes and fox face, fussing around those feathers&mdash;as though he
had just caught and eaten the bird that wore them!"</p>

<p>Portlaw continued to scowl.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take them on at cards," suggested Malcourt.</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They've taken a thousand out of me already."</p>

<p>Malcourt said quietly: "You've never before given such a reason
for discontinuing card-playing. What's your real reason?"</p>

<p>Portlaw was silent.</p>

<p>"Did you quit a thousand to the bad, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Then why not get it back?"</p>

<p>"I don't care to play," said Portlaw shortly.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>

<p>"Are you, by any chance, afraid of our fox-faced guest?" asked
Malcourt suavely.</p>

<p>"I don't care to give any reason, I tell you."</p>

<p>"That's serious; as there could be only one reason. Did you think
you noticed&mdash;anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what I think.... I've half a mind to stop payment
on that check&mdash;if that enlightens you any."</p>

<p>"There's an easier way," said Malcourt coolly. "You know how
it is in sparring? You forecast what your opponent is going to
do and you stop him before he does it."</p>

<p>"I'm not <em>certain</em> that he&mdash;did it," muttered Portlaw.
"I can't afford to make a mistake by kicking out your brother-in-law."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mind me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I were sure.... I wish I had that thousand back;
it drives me crazy to think of losing it&mdash;in that way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh; then you feel reasonably sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, confound it.... The backs of the aces were slightly rough&mdash;but
I can scarcely believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you a magnifying glass?"</p>

<p>The pack has disappeared.... I meant to try that."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Malcourt calmly, "it wouldn't surprise
me in the slightest to learn that Tressilvain is a blackguard.
It's easy enough to get your thousand back. Shall we?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Malcourt sauntered over to a card table, seated himself, motioned
Portlaw to the chair opposite, and removed the cover from a new
pack.</p>

<p>Then, to Portlaw's astonishment, he began to take aces and court
cards from any part of the pack at his pleasure; any card that
Portlaw called for was produced unerringly. Then Malcourt dealt
him unbelievable hands&mdash;all of a colour, all of a suit, all the
cards below the tens, all above; and Portlaw, fascinated, watched
the dark, deft fingers nimbly dealing, shuffling, until his senses
spun round; and when Malcourt finally tore up all the aces, and
then, ripping the green baize cover from the table, disclosed
the four aces underneath, intact, Portlaw, petrified, only stared
at him out of distended eyes.</p>

<p>"Those are nice tricks, aren't they?" asked Malcourt, smiling.</p>

<p>"Y-yes. Lord! Louis, I never dreamed you could do such devilish
things as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can. If I were not always behind you in my score I'd scarcely
dare let you know what I might do if I chose.... How far ahead
is that little mink, yonder?"</p>

<p>"Tressilvain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He has taken about a thousand&mdash;wait!" Portlaw consulted his
note-book, made a wry face, and gave Malcourt the exact total.</p>

<p>Malcourt turned carelessly in his chair.</p>

<p>"O Herbert!" he called across to his brother-in-law; "don't you
and Helen want to take us on?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" replied Tressilvain briskly; and came trotting across
the room, his close-set black eyes moving restlessly from Malcourt
to Portlaw.</p>

<p>"Come on, Helen," said Malcourt, drawing up a chair for her;
and his sister seated herself gracefully. A moment later the game
began, Portlaw passing it over to Malcourt, who made it no trumps,
and laid out all the materials for international trouble, including
a hundred aces.</p>

<p>The games were brutally short, savage, decisive; Tressilvain
lost countenance after the fastest four rubbers he had ever played,
and shot an exasperated glance at his wife, who was staring thoughtfully
at her brother.</p>

<p>But that young man appeared to be in an innocently merry mood;
he gaily taunted Herby, as he chose to call him, with loss of
nerve; he tormented his sister because she didn't seem to know
what Portlaw's discards meant; and no wonder, because he discarded
from an obscure system taught him by Malcourt. Also, with a malice
which Tressilvain ignored, he forced formalities, holding everybody
ruthlessly to iron-clad rule, taking penalties, enforcing the
most rigid etiquette. For he was one of those rare players who
knew the game so thoroughly that while he, and the man he had
taught, often ignored the classics of adversary play, the slightest
relaxing of etiquette, rule, precept, or precedent, in his opponents,
brought him out with a protest exacting the last item of toll
for indiscretion.</p>

<p>Portlaw was perhaps the sounder player, Malcourt certainly the
more brilliant; and now, for the first time since the advent of
the Tressilvains, the cards Portlaw held were good ones.</p>

<p>"What a nasty thing to do!" said Lady Tressilvain sharply, as
her brother's finesse went through, and with it another rubber.</p>

<p>"It was horrid, wasn't it, Helen? I don't know what's got into
you and Herby"; and to the latter's protest he added pleasantly:
"You talk like a bucket of ashes. Go on and deal!"</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>what!" demanded Tressilvain angrily.</p>

<p>"It's an Americanism," observed his wife, surveying her cards
with masked displeasure and making it spades. "Louis, I never
held such hands in all my life," she said, displaying the meagre
dummy.</p>

<p>"Do you good, Helen. Mustn't be too proud and haughty. No, no!
Good for you and Herby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't call him Herby," snapped his sister.</p>

<p>"Not respectful?" inquired Malcourt, lifting his eyebrows. "Well,
I'll call him anything you like, Helen; I don't care. But make
it something I can say when ladies are present&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tressilvain's mink-like muzzle turned white with rage. He didn't
like to be flouted, he didn't like his cards, he didn't like to
lose money. And he had already lost a lot between luncheon and
the impending dinner.</p>

<p>"Why the devil I continue to hold all these three-card suits
I don't know," he said savagely. "Isn't there another pack in
the house?"</p>

<p>"There <em>was</em>" said Malcourt; and ironically condoled with
him as Portlaw accomplished a little slam in hearts.</p>

<p>Then Tressilvain dealt; and Malcourt's eyes never left his brother-in-law's
hands as they distributed the cards with nervous rapidity.</p>

<p>"Misdeal," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded his sister in sharp protest.</p>

<p>"It's a misdeal," repeated Malcourt, smiling at her; and, as
Tressilvain, half the pack suspended, gazed blankly at him, Malcourt
turned and looked him squarely in the eye. The other reddened.</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Malcourt, with careless good-humour, "but one
has to be so careful in dealing the top card, Herby. You stumble
over your own fingers; they're too long; or perhaps it's that
ring of yours."</p>

<p>A curious, almost ghastly glance passed involuntarily between
the Tressilvains; Portlaw, who was busy lighting a cigar, did
not notice it, but Malcourt laughed lightly and ran over the score,
adding it up with a nimble accuracy that seemed to stun his relatives.</p>

<p>"Why, look what's here!" he exclaimed, genially displaying a
total that, added, balanced all Portlaw's gains and losses to
date. "Why, isn't that curious, Helen! Right off the bat like
that!&mdash;cricket-bat," he explained affably to Tressilvain, who,
as dinner was imminent, had begun fumbling for his check-book.</p>

<p>At Malcourt's suave suggestion, however, instead of drawing a
new check he returned Portlaw's check. Malcourt took it, tore
it carefully in two equal parts.</p>

<p>"Half for you, William, half for me," he said gaily. "My&mdash;my!
What strange things do happen in cards&mdash;and in the British Isles!"</p>

<p>The dull flush deepened on Tressilvain's averted face, but Lady
Tressilvain, unusually pale, watched her brother persistently
during the general conversation that preceded dressing for dinner.</p>
