<p><em>TWELVE</em></p>

<p>I was at the Hôtel de Luynes&mdash;or Granger&mdash;early on the following
morning. The mists were still hanging about the dismal upper windows
of the inscrutable Faubourg; the toilet of the city was being
completed; the little hoses on wheels were clattering about the
quiet larger streets. I had not much courage thus early in the
day. I had started impulsively; stepping with the impulse of immediate
action from the doorstep of the dairy where I had breakfasted.
But I made detours; it was too early, and my pace slackened into
a saunter as I passed the row of porters' lodges in that dead,
inscrutable street. I wanted to fly; had that impulse very strongly;
but I burnt my boats with my inquiry of the incredibly ancient,
one-eyed porteress. I made my way across the damp court-yard,
under the enormous portico, and into the chilly stone hall that
no amount of human coming and going sufficed to bring back to
a semblance of life. Mademoiselle was expecting me. One went up
a great flight of stone steps into one of the immensely high,
narrow, impossibly rectangular ante-rooms that one sees in the
frontispieces of old plays. The furniture looked no more than
knee-high until one discovered that one's self had no appreciable
stature. The sad light slanted in ruled lines from the great height
of the windows; an army of motes moved slowly in and out of the
shadows. I went after awhile and looked disconsolately out into
the court-yard. The porteress was making her way across the gravelled
space, her arms, her hands, the pockets of her black apron full
of letters of all sizes. I remembered that the <em>facteur</em>
had followed me down the street. A noise of voices came confusedly
to my ears from between half-opened folding-doors; the thing reminded
me of my waiting in de Mersch's rooms. It did not last so long.
The voices gathered tone, as they do at the end of a colloquy,
succeeded each other at longer intervals, and at last came to
a sustained halt. The tall doors moved ajar and she entered, followed
by a man whom I recognized as the governor of a province of the
day before. In that hostile light he looked old and weazened and
worried; seemed to have lost much of his rotundity. As for her,
she shone with a light of her own.</p>

<p>He greeted me dejectedly, and did not brighten when she let him
know that we had a mutual friend in Callan. The Governor, it seemed,
in his capacity of Supervisor of the Système, was to conduct that
distinguished person through the wilds of Greenland; was to smooth
his way and to point out to him excellences of administration.</p>

<p>I wished him a good journey; he sighed and began to fumble with
his hat.</p>

<p>"<em>Alors, c'est entendu</em>," she said; giving him leave to
depart. He looked at her in an odd sort of way, took her hand
and applied it to his lips.</p>

<p>"<em>C'est entendu</em>," he said with a heavy sigh, drops of
moisture spattering from beneath his white moustache, "<em>mais</em>
..."</p>

<p>He ogled again with infinitesimal eyes and went out of the room.
He had the air of wishing to wipe the perspiration from his brows
and to exclaim, "<em>Quelle femme</em>!" But if he had any such
wish he mastered it until the door hid him from sight.</p>

<p>"Why the ..." I began before it had well closed, "do you allow
that thing to make love to you?" I wanted to take up my position
before she could have a chance to make me ridiculous. I wanted
to make a long speech&mdash;about duty to the name of Granger. But
the next word hung, and, before it came, she had answered:</p>

<p>"He? &mdash;Oh, I'm making use of him."</p>

<p>"To inherit the earth?" I asked ironically, and she answered
gravely:</p>

<p>"To inherit the earth."</p>

<p>She was leaning against the window, playing with the strings
of the blinds, and silhouetted against the leaden light. She seemed
to be, physically, a little tired; and the lines of her figure
to interlace almost tenderly&mdash;to "compose" well, after the ideas
of a certain school. I knew so little of her&mdash;only just enough
to be in love with her&mdash;that this struck me as the herald of a
new phase, not so much in her attitude to me as in mine to her;
she had even then a sort of gravity, the gravity of a person on
whom things were beginning to weigh.</p>

<p>"But," I said, irresolutely. I could not speak to her; to this
new conception of her, in the way I had planned; in the way one
would talk to a brilliant, limpid&mdash;oh, to a woman of sorts. But
I had to take something of my old line. "How would flirting with
that man help you?"</p>

<p>"It's quite simple," she answered, "he's to show Callan all Greenland,
and Callan is to write ... Callan has immense influence over a
great class, and he will have some of the prestige of&mdash;of a Commissioner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know about Callan," I said.</p>

<p>"And," she went on, "this man had orders to hide things from
Callan; you know what it is they have to hide. But he won't now;
that is what I was arranging. It's partly by bribery and partly
because he has a belief in his <em>beaux yeux</em>&mdash;so Callan
will be upset and will write an ... exposure; the sort of thing
Callan would write if he were well upset. And he will be, by what
this man will let him see. You know what a little man like Callan
will feel ... he will be made ill. He would faint at the sight
of a drop of blood, you know, and he will see&mdash;oh, the very worst,
worse than what Radet saw. And he will write a frightful article,
and it will be a thunderclap for de Mersch.... And de Mersch will
be getting very shaky by then. And your friend Churchill will
try to carry de Mersch's railway bill through in the face of the
scandal. Churchill's motives will be excellent, but everyone will
say ... You know what people say ... That is what I and Gurnard
want. We want people to talk; we want them to believe...."</p>

<p>I don't know whether there really was a hesitation in her voice,
or whether I read that into it. She stood there, playing with
the knots of the window-cords and speaking in a low monotone.
The whole thing, the sad twilight of the place, her tone of voice,
seemed tinged with unavailing regret. I had almost forgotten the
Dimensionist story, and I had never believed in it. But now, for
the first time I began to have my doubts. I was certain that she
had been plotting <em>something</em> with one of the Duc de Mersch's
lieutenants. The man's manner vouched for that; he had not been
able to look me in the face. But, more than anything, his voice
and manner made me feel that we had passed out of a realm of farcical
allegory. I knew enough to see that she might be speaking the
truth. And, if she were, her calm avowal of such treachery proved
that she <em>was</em> what she had said the Dimensionists were;
cold, with no scruples, clear-sighted and admirably courageous,
and indubitably enemies of society.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," I said. "But de Mersch then?"</p>

<p>She made a little gesture; one of those movements that I best
remember of her; the smallest, the least noticeable. It reduced
de Mersch to nothing; he no longer even counted.</p>

<p>"Oh, as for him," she said, "he is only a detail." I had still
the idea that she spoke with a pitying intonation&mdash;as if she were
speaking to a dog in pain. "He doesn't really count; not really.
He will crumble up and disappear, very soon. You won't even remember
him."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "you go about with him, as if you.... You are
getting yourself talked about.... Everyone thinks&mdash;" ... The accusation
that I had come to make seemed impossible, now I was facing her.
"I believe," I added, with the suddenness of inspiration. "I'm
certain even, that <em>he</em> thinks that you ..."</p>

<p>"Well, they think that sort of thing. But it is only part of
the game. Oh, I assure you it is no more than that."</p>

<p>I was silent. I felt that, for one reason or another, she wished
me to believe.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I want you to believe. It will save you a good
deal of pain."</p>

<p>"If you wanted to save me pain," I maintained, "you would have
done with de Mersch ... for good." I had an idea that the solution
was beyond me. It was as if the controlling powers were flitting,
invisible, just above my head, just beyond my grasp. There was
obviously something vibrating; some cord, somewhere, stretched
very taut and quivering. But I could think of no better solution
than: "You must have done with him." It seemed obvious, too, that
that was impossible, was outside the range of things that could
be done&mdash;but I had to do my best. "It's a&mdash;it's vile," I added,
"vile."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know," she said, "for you.... And I'm even sorry.
But it has to be gone on with. De Mersch has to go under in just
this way. It can't be any other."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, because she had paused. I hadn't any desire
for enlightenment.</p>

<p>"It isn't even only Churchill," she said, "not even only that
de Mersch will bring down Churchill with him. It is that he must
bring down everything that Churchill stands for. You know what
that is&mdash;the sort of probity, all the old order of things. And
the more vile the means used to destroy de Mersch the more vile
the whole affair will seem. People&mdash;the sort of people&mdash;have an
idea that a decent man cannot be touched by tortuous intrigues.
And the whole thing will be&mdash;oh, malodorous. You understand."</p>

<p>"I don't," I answered, "I don't understand at all."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you do," she said, "you understand...." She paused
for a long while, and I was silent. I understood vaguely what
she meant; that if Churchill fell amid the clouds of dust of such
a collapse, there would be an end of belief in probity ... or
nearly an end. But I could not see what it all led up to; where
it left us.</p>

<p>"You see," she began again, "I want to make it as little painful
to you as I can; as little painful as explanations <em>can</em>
make it. I can't feel as you feel, but I can see, rather dimly,
what it is that hurts you. And so ... I want to; I really want
to."</p>

<p>"But you won't do the one thing," I returned hopelessly to the
charge.</p>

<p>"I cannot," she answered, "it must be like that; there isn't
any way. You are so tied down to these little things. Don't you
see that de Mersch, and&mdash;and all these people&mdash;don't really count?
They aren't anything at all in the scheme of things. I think that,
even for you, they aren't worth bothering about. They're only
accidents; the accidents that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That what?" I asked, although I began to see dimly what she
meant.</p>

<p>"That lead in the inevitable," she answered. "Don't you see?
Don't you understand? We <em>are</em> the inevitable ... and you
can't keep us back. We have to come and you, you will only hurt
yourself, by resisting." A sense that this was the truth, the
only truth, beset me. It was for the moment impossible to think
of anything else&mdash;of anything else in the world. "You must accept
us and all that we mean, you must stand back; sooner or later.
Look even all round you, and you will understand better. You are
in the house of a type&mdash;a type that became impossible. Oh, centuries
ago. And that type too, tried very hard to keep back the inevitable;
not only because itself went under, but because everything that
it stood for went under. And it had to suffer&mdash;heartache ... that
sort of suffering. Isn't it so?"</p>

<p>I did not answer; the illustration was too abominably just. It
was just that. There were even now all these people&mdash;these Legitimists&mdash;sneering
ineffectually; shutting themselves away from the light in their
mournful houses and suffering horribly because everything that
they stood for had gone under.</p>

<p>"But even if I believe you," I said, "the thing is too horrible,
and your tools are too mean; that man who has just gone out and&mdash;and
Callan&mdash;are they the weapons of the inevitable? After all, the
Revolution ..." I was striving to get back to tangible ideas&mdash;ideas
that one could name and date and label ... "the Revolution was
noble in essence and made for good. But all this of yours is too
vile and too petty. You are bribing, or something worse, that
man to betray his master. And that you call helping on the inevitable...."</p>

<p>"They used to say just that of the Revolution. That wasn't nice
of its tools. Don't you see? They were the people that went under....
They couldn't see the good...."</p>

<p>"And I &mdash;I am to take it on trust," I said, bitterly.</p>

<p>"You couldn't see the good," she answered, "it isn't possible,
and there is no way of explaining. Our languages are different,
and there's no bridge&mdash;no bridge at all. We <em>can't</em> meet...."</p>

<p>It was that revolted me. If there was no bridge and we could
not meet, we must even fight; that is, if I believed her version
of herself. If I did not, I was being played the fool with. I
preferred to think that. If she were only fooling me she remained
attainable. If it was as she said, there was no hope at all&mdash;not
any.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," I said, suddenly. I didn't want to believe
her. The thing was too abominable&mdash;too abominable for words, and
incredible. I struggled against it as one struggles against inevitable
madness, against the thought of it. It hung over me, stupefying,
deadening. One could only fight it with violence, crudely, in
jerks, as one struggles against the numbness of frost. It was
like a pall, like descending clouds of smoke, seemed to be actually
present in the absurdly lofty room&mdash;this belief in what she stood
for, in what she said she stood for.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," I proclaimed, "I won't.... You are playing
the fool with me ... trying to get round me ... to make me let
you go on with these&mdash;with these &mdash;It is abominable. Think
of what it means for me, what people are saying of me, and I am
a decent man &mdash;You shall not. Do you understand, you <em>shall</em>
not. It is unbearable ... and you ... you try to fool me ... in
order to keep me quiet ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said. "Oh, no."</p>

<p>She had an accent that touched grief, as nearly as she could
touch it. I remember it now, as one remembers these things. But
then I passed it over. I was too much moved myself to notice it
more than subconsciously, as one notices things past which one
is whirled. And I was whirled past these things, in an ungovernable
fury at the remembrance of what I had suffered, of what I had
still to suffer. I was speaking with intense rage, jerking out
words, ideas, as floodwater jerks through a sluice the <em>débris</em>
of once ordered fields.</p>

<p>"You are," I said, "you <em>are</em>&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;dragging an ancient
name through the dust&mdash;you ..."</p>

<p>I forget what I said. But I remember, "dragging an ancient name."
It struck me, at the time, by its forlornness, as part of an appeal
to her. It was so pathetically tiny a motive, so out of tone,
that it stuck in my mind. I only remember the upshot of my speech;
that, unless she swore&mdash;oh, yes, swore&mdash;to have done with de Mersch,
I would denounce her to my aunt at that very moment and in that
very house.</p>

<p>And she said that it was impossible.</p>
