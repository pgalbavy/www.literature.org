<p>A wind was running, so that occasionally the poplars whitened as if
a flame flew up them.  The sky was broken and blue among moving
clouds.  Patches of sunshine lay on the level fields, and shadows
on the rye and the vineyards.  In the distance, very blue, the
cathedral bristled against the sky, and the houses of the city of
Metz clustered vaguely below, like a hill.</p>

<p>Among the fields by the lime trees stood the barracks, upon bare,
dry ground, a collection of round-roofed huts of corrugated iron,
where the soldiers' nasturtiums climbed brilliantly.  There was a
tract of vegetable garden at the side, with the soldiers' yellowish
lettuces in rows, and at the back the big, hard drilling-yard
surrounded by a wire fence.</p>

<p>At this time in the afternoon, the huts were deserted, all the beds
pushed up, the soldiers were lounging about under the lime trees
waiting for the call to drill.  Bachmann sat on a bench in the
shade that smelled sickly with blossom.  Pale green, wrecked lime
flowers were scattered on the ground.  He was writing his weekly
post card to his mother.  He was a fair, long, limber youth, good
looking.  He sat very still indeed, trying to write his post card.
His blue uniform, sagging on him as he sat bent over the card,
disfigured his youthful shape.  His sunburnt hand waited motionless
for the words to come.  &quot;Dear mother&quot; - was all he had written.
Then he scribbled mechanically:  &quot;Many thanks for your letter with
what you sent.  Everything is all right with me.  We are just off
to drill on the fortifications - &quot;  Here he broke off and sat
suspended, oblivious of everything, held in some definite suspense.
He looked again at the card.  But he could write no more.  Out of
the knot of his consciousness no word would come.  He signed
himself, and looked up, as a man looks to see if anyone has noticed
him in his privacy.</p>

<p>There was a self-conscious strain in his blue eyes, and a pallor
about his mouth, where the young, fair moustache glistened.  He was
almost girlish in his good looks and his grace.  But he had
something of military consciousness, as if he believed in the
discipline for himself, and found satisfaction in delivering
himself to his duty.  There was also a trace of youthful swagger
and dare-devilry about his mouth and his limber body, but this was
in suppression now.</p>

<p>He put the post card in the pocket of his tunic, and went to join a
group of his comrades who were lounging in the shade, laughing and
talking grossly.  To-day he was out of it.  He only stood near to
them for the warmth of the association.  In his own consciousness
something held him down.</p>

<p>Presently they were summoned to ranks.  The sergeant came out to
take command.  He was a strongly built, rather heavy man of forty.
His head was thrust forward, sunk a little between his powerful
shoulders, and the strong jaw was pushed out aggressively.  But the
eyes were smouldering, the face hung slack and sodden with drink.</p>

<p>He gave his orders in brutal, barking shouts, and the little
company moved forward, out of the wire-fenced yard to the open
road, marching rhythmically, raising the dust.  Bachmann, one of
the inner file of four deep, marched in the airless ranks, half
suffocated with heat and dust and enclosure.  Through the moving of
his comrades' bodies, he could see the small vines dusty by the
roadside, the poppies among the tares fluttering and blown to
pieces, the distant spaces of sky and fields all free with air and
sunshine.  But he was bound in a very dark enclosure of anxiety
within himself.</p>

<p>He marched with his usual ease, being healthy and well adjusted.
But his body went on by itself.  His spirit was clenched apart.
And ever the few soldiers drew nearer and nearer to the town, ever
the consciousness of the youth became more gripped and separate,
his body worked by a kind of mechanical intelligence, a mere
presence of mind.</p>

<p>They diverged from the high road and passed in single file down a
path among trees.  All was silent and green and mysterious, with
shadow of foliage and long, green, undisturbed grass.  Then they
came out in the sunshine on a moat of water, which wound silently
between the long, flowery grass, at the foot of the earthworks,
that rose in front in terraces walled smooth on the face, but all
soft with long grass at the top.  Marguerite daisies and lady's-
slipper glimmered white and gold in the lush grass, preserved here
in the intense peace of the fortifications.  Thickets of trees
stood round about.  Occasionally a puff of mysterious wind made the
flowers and the long grass that crested the earthworks above bow
and shake as with signals of oncoming alarm.</p>

<p>The group of soldiers stood at the end of the moat, in their light
blue and scarlet uniforms, very bright.  The sergeant was giving
them instructions, and his shout came sharp and alarming in the
intense, untouched stillness of the place.  They listened, finding
it difficult to make the effort of understanding.</p>

<p>Then it was over, and the men were moving to make preparations.  On
the other side of the moat the ramparts rose smooth and clear in
the sun, sloping slightly back.  Along the summit grass grew and
tall daisies stood ledged high, like magic, against the dark green
of the tree-tops behind.  The noise of the town, the running of
tram-cars, was heard distinctly, but it seemed not to penetrate
this still place.</p>

<p>The water of the moat was motionless.  In silence the practice
began.  One of the soldiers took a scaling ladder, and passing
along the narrow ledge at the foot of the earthworks, with the
water of the moat just behind him, tried to get a fixture on the
slightly sloping wall-face.  There he stood, small and isolated, at
the foot of the wall, trying to get his ladder settled.  At last it
held, and the clumsy, groping figure in the baggy blue uniform
began to clamber up.  The rest of the soldiers stood and watched.
Occasionally the sergeant barked a command.  Slowly the clumsy blue
figure clambered higher up the wall-face.  Bachmann stood with his
bowels turned to water.  The figure of the climbing soldier
scrambled out on to the terrace up above, and moved, blue and
distinct, among the bright green grass.  The officer shouted from
below.  The soldier tramped along, fixed the ladder in another
spot, and carefully lowered himself on to the rungs.  Bachmann
watched the blind foot groping in space for the ladder, and he felt
the world fall away beneath him.  The figure of the soldier clung
cringing against the face of the wall, cleaving, groping downwards
like some unsure insect working its way lower and lower, fearing
every movement.  At last, sweating and with a strained face, the
figure had landed safely and turned to the group of soldiers.  But
still it had a stiffness and a blank, mechanical look, was
something less than human.</p>

<p>Bachmann stood there heavy and condemned, waiting for his own turn
and betrayal.  Some of the men went up easily enough, and without
fear.  That only showed it could be done lightly, and made
Bachmann's case more bitter.  If only he could do it lightly, like
that.</p>

<p>His turn came.  He knew intuitively that nobody knew his condition.
The officer just saw him as a mechanical thing.  He tried to keep
it up, to carry it through on the face of things.  His inside
gripped tight, as yet under control, he took the ladder and went
along under the wall.  He placed his ladder with quick success, and
wild, quivering hope possessed him.  Then blindly he began to
climb.  But the ladder was not very firm, and at every hitch a
great, sick, melting feeling took hold of him.  He clung on fast.
If only he could keep that grip on himself, he would get through.
He knew this, in agony.  What he could not understand was the blind
gush of white-hot fear, that came with great force whenever the
ladder swerved, and which almost melted his belly and all his
joints, and left him powerless.  If once it melted all his joints
and his belly, he was done.  He clung desperately to himself.  He
knew the fear, he knew what it did when it came, he knew he had
only to keep a firm hold.  He knew all this.  Yet, when the ladder
swerved, and his foot missed, there was the great blast of fear
blowing on his heart and bowels, and he was melting weaker and
weaker, in a horror of fear and lack of control, melting to fall.</p>

<p>Yet he groped slowly higher and higher, always staring upwards with
desperate face, and always conscious of the space below.  But all
of him, body and soul, was growing hot to fusion point.  He would
have to let go for very relief's sake.  Suddenly his heart began to
lurch.  It gave a great, sickly swoop, rose, and again plunged in a
swoop of horror.  He lay against the wall inert as if dead, inert,
at peace, save for one deep core of anxiety, which knew that it was
NOT all over, that he was still high in space against the wall.
But the chief effort of will was gone.</p>

<p>There came into his consciousness a small, foreign sensation.  He
woke up a little.  What was it?  Then slowly it penetrated him.
His water had run down his leg.  He lay there, clinging, still with
shame, half conscious of the echo of the sergeant's voice
thundering from below.  He waited, in depths of shame beginning to
recover himself.  He had been shamed so deeply.  Then he could go
on, for his fear for himself was conquered.  His shame was known
and published.  He must go on.</p>

<p>Slowly he began to grope for the rung above, when a great shock
shook through him.  His wrists were grasped from above, he was
being hauled out of himself up, up to the safe ground.  Like a sack
he was dragged over the edge of the earthworks by the large hands,
and landed there on his knees, grovelling in the grass to recover
command of himself, to rise up on his feet.</p>

<p>Shame, blind, deep shame and ignominy overthrew his spirit and left
it writhing.  He stood there shrunk over himself, trying to
obliterate himself.</p>

<p>Then the presence of the officer who had hauled him up made itself
felt upon him.  He heard the panting of the elder man, and then the
voice came down on his veins like a fierce whip.  He shrank in
tension of shame.</p>

<p>&quot;Put up your head - eyes front,&quot; shouted the enraged sergeant, and
mechanically the soldier obeyed the command, forced to look into
the eyes of the sergeant.  The brutal, hanging face of the officer
violated the youth.  He hardened himself with all his might from
seeing it.  The tearing noise of the sergeant's voice continued to
lacerate his body.</p>

<p>Suddenly he set back his head, rigid, and his heart leapt to burst.
The face had suddenly thrust itself close, all distorted and
showing the teeth, the eyes smouldering into him.  The breath of
the barking words was on his nose and mouth.  He stepped aside in
revulsion.  With a scream the face was upon him again.  He raised
his arm, involuntarily, in self-defence.  A shock of horror went
through him, as he felt his forearm hit the face of the officer a
brutal blow.  The latter staggered, swerved back, and with a
curious cry, reeled backwards over the ramparts, his hands
clutching the air.  There was a second of silence, then a crash to
water.</p>

<p>Bachmann, rigid, looked out of his inner silence upon the scene.
Soldiers were running.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better clear,&quot; said one young, excited voice to him.  And
with immediate instinctive decision he started to walk away from
the spot.  He went down the tree-hidden path to the high road where
the trams ran to and from the town.  In his heart was a sense of
vindication, of escape.  He was leaving it all, the military world,
the shame.  He was walking away from it.</p>

<p>Officers on horseback rode sauntering down the street, soldiers
passed along the pavement.  Coming to the bridge, Bachmann crossed
over to the town that heaped before him, rising from the flat,
picturesque French houses down below at the water's edge, up a
jumble of roofs and chasms of streets, to the lovely dark cathedral
with its myriad pinnacles making points at the sky.</p>

<p>He felt for the moment quite at peace, relieved from a great
strain.  So he turned along by the river to the public gardens.
Beautiful were the heaped, purple lilac trees upon the green grass,
and wonderful the walls of the horse-chestnut trees, lighted like
an altar with white flowers on every ledge.  Officers went by,
elegant and all coloured, women and girls sauntered in the
chequered shade.  Beautiful it was, he walked in a vision, free.</p>
