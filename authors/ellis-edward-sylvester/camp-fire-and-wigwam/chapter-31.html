<p>Jack Carleton reasoned in this wise:</p>

<p>In the morning Ogallah would notice his absence from the lodge
and would make immediate search for him. He would quickly learn
that the entire navy of his nation had vanished as completely
as has our own, and the conclusion would be warranted that it
had either run away with the pale face or the pale face had run
away with the navy: at any rate they had gone off in company and
the hunt would begin.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile down stream, the first installment of the
fleet would be found stranded on the southern shore, as though
it was used to set the fashion followed by our country a century
later. The conclusion would be formed that the audacious fugitive
had landed at that point and plunged into the interior; but a
brief examination would show the Sauks their mistake and they
would rush on along the banks until the second craft was discovered,
when the same disappointment would follow.</p>

<p>This would continue until every one of the five canoes had been
found and examined. Inasmuch as the fifth contained Jack himself,
it will be seen that more care was required in his case; but the
programme had been laid out to its minutest details while the
enemy was a guest in the lodge of the king.</p>

<p>After the fourth canoe had been stuck against the bank, the number
lying on alternate sides, Jack removed his clothing and letting
himself over the stern, plunged into the cool, refreshing current,
where he dove, frolicked, sported, and enjoyed himself to the
full&mdash;his happiness such that he could hardly refrain from shouting
for very joy. He kept this up as long as prudent, when he clambered
into the boat again, donned his clothing, floated a short distance
further, and shot the craft into land with a force that held it
fast.</p>

<p>A brief calculation will show that the boy had gone something
more than a mile from the Indian village, and he had secured what
may well be termed a winning lead; but much still remained to
be done. He was now about to leave the element where even the
trained bloodhound would be at fault, and step upon the land,
where the keen eye of the Sauk warrior would follow his footprints
with the surety of fate itself. Hence it depended on his covering
up the tell-tale trail, unless chance, against which no one can
guard, should direct his pursuers to it.</p>

<p>Both shores of the stream were covered with forest which grew
to the edge of the water. In some places there was undergrowth
which overhung the river, but it was not very plentiful. The position
of the moon in the sky was such that most of the time the middle
of the stream reflected its light, while the shores were in shadow.
These looked indescribably gloomy, and but for bounding spirits
which set the whole being of the lad aglow, he would have been
oppressed to an unbearable degree. The course of the river for
the first mile was remarkably straight, but it made a sweeping
bend just before Jack ran his canoe into shore. His aim now was
to quit the water without leaving any tell-tale traces behind.
If he stepped ashore and walked away never so carefully, he would
fail to do what was absolutely necessary. He believed he accomplished
his purpose, by running the boat under some overhanging undergrowth,
where he laboriously pulled it up the bank, until it could not
be seen by any one passing up or down stream, and could be found
by no one moving along the shore itself, unless he paused and
made search at the exact spot. The probability of any Indian doing
such a thing, it will be conceded, was as unlikely as it could
be.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the first step the fugitive took would
leave an impression which would tell the whole story, and it now
depended on the manner in which he overcame that special danger.
Carefully sounding the water, Jack found it was quite shallow
close to land. He therefore waded a full hundred yards from the
canoe before leaving the stream, and then, with his clothing saturated
to his knees, he stepped ashore, took a score of long careful
steps straight away, and his flight, it may be said, was fairly
begun.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I have done so much after all," said he, when
he had reached a point a hundred yards from the stream, "for some
one of the Indians may strike my trail before sunrise to-morrow
morning; but I have done all I can at the start, and if I can
have a few miles the lead, it'll be no fun for them to overtake
me."</p>

<p>There was no reason why such an advantage should not be secured,
for, although the moon was of no help to him in determining his
course, he had studied the whole thing so carefully while lying
in the lodge of the chieftain Ogallah, that he was as sure of
the direction as if he held a mariner's compass in his hand.</p>

<p>Jack, it will be borne in mind was in the southern portion of
the present State of Missouri, the frontier settlement of Martinsville
lying at no great distance westward from Kentucky, and north of
the boundary line of Arkansas, as it has existed since the formation
of that Territory and State. The Sauk party of Indians who made
him captive had pursued an almost westerly direction, taking him
well toward the Ozark region, if not actually within that mountainous
section. It followed, therefore, that he should pursue the easterly
course, for the stream along which he had been borne, had carried
him almost due north, and it was not necessary for him to diverge
in order to leave it well behind.</p>

<p>The fugitive lost no time, but pushed through the wood as fast
as he could. It was hard to restrain his desire to break into
a run, but he did so, for nothing could have been gained and much
was likely to be lost by such a course. Despite the bright moon
overhead, few of its rays found their way through the dense vegetation
and foliage. Though he encountered little undergrowth, yet he
was compelled to use his hands as well as his eyes in order to
escape painful accidents.</p>

<p>The hours of darkness were valuable to Jack, yet he longed for
daylight. He wanted to be able to see where he was going, and
to use what little woodcraft he possessed. So long as he was obliged
to keep one hand extended in front in order to save his face and
neck, he could adopt no precautions to hide his footprints from
the prying eyes of his enemies. He knew he was leaving a trail
which was as easy for his enemies to follow, as though he walked
in the yielding sand. Much as he regretted the fact, it could
not be helped so long as the darkness lasted, and he wasted no
efforts in the attempt to do so. It would be far otherwise when
he should have daylight to help him.</p>

<p>Fortunately perhaps, he had not long to wait. He had not gone
far when he observed the increasing light which speedily announced
the rising of the sun; but he was shocked to find that despite
his care and previous experience in tramping through the wilderness,
he had got much off his course. Instead of the orb appearing directly
in front of him, as he expected it to do, it rose on his right
hand, showing that instead of pursuing an easterly course he was
going north&mdash;a direction which took him very little nearer his
home than if he traveled directly opposite.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, Jack had no sooner learned his mistake than
he faced about and corrected it.</p>

<p>"I've got my bearings now," he muttered confidently, "and I know
too much about this business to drift off again. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>He could not deny himself the luxury of one shout and the toss
of his cap in the air. This completed, he strode forward with
more dignified step, and settled down to work, after the manner
of a sensible youth who appreciates the task before him. He calculated
that he was two or three miles from the Indian village, much closer
than was comfortable, and he could not stop to eat or rest until
it should be increased. He felt that this day was to be the decisive
one. If he could keep beyond the reach of his pursuers until the
setting of the sun, he would throw them off his trail so effectively
that they could never recover it.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't I do it?" he asked, confidently: "Deerfoot
taught me how to hide my tracks, and I never can have a better
chance than now, where everything is in my favor."</p>

<p>He alluded to the number of streams, the rocky and diversified
surface and the general rugged character of the country through
which his journey was leading him.</p>

<p>In such a region there must be numerous opportunities for covering
his trail from the penetrating glance of those who had spent their
lives in studying the ways of the woods. The stealthy tread of
the shoe or moccasin over the flinty rock left no impression,
but it was hardly possible to find enough of such surface to prove
of value; but when he caught the gleam of water through the trees,
his heart gave a leap of pleasure.</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> is what I wanted," he exclaimed, coming to a halt
on the bank of a rapidly flowing creek, some fifty feet wide:
"here is something that will wipe out a fellow's trail."</p>

<p>The current was fairly clear and rapid. It was evidently deep,
and it seemed to the lad that it was the compression of a considerably
wider stream into a space that added velocity to its flow. Its
general course, so far as he could learn, was eastwardly, and
was therefore favorable to him.</p>

<p>There was but the one way of utilizing the creek, and that was
by floating over its surface. Jack could have strapped his gun
to his back and swum a considerable distance, but that would have
been a useless exertion attended by many discomforts. His purpose
was to build a raft or float which would allow the current to
carry him for a mile or so, when he could land and continue his
journey.</p>

<p>Better fortune than he anticipated awaited him. While moving
along the shore in search of logs and decayed wood from which
to construct his float, he was astonished to run plump upon an
Indian canoe, which was drawn up the bank beyond the probability
of discovery.</p>

<p>"Well, now that <em>is</em> lucky!" exclaimed the gratified lad,
who quickly added the saving clause, "that is, I <em>hope</em>
it is, though where you find canoes, it is best to suspect Indians."</p>

<p>He looked for them, but no sign greeted eye or ear. He supposed
the boat belonged to the tribe which he had left the night before,
though it was somewhat singular that it should have been moored
such a distance from home. Possibly this was a much used ferry
where something of the kind was found convenient.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained by speculating about the ownership of
the craft, but the part of wisdom was to make use of the means
that was so fortunately placed within his reach. Without any delay,
therefore, he shoved the frail structure into the water, leaping
into it as it shot from shore. No paddle could be found on or
about the vessel, and he used his rifle for the implement, as
he had done more than once before. Holding it by the barrel, he
swung the stock through the current and found it served his purpose
well. A slight force is sufficient to propel an Indian canoe through
or over the water, and the task was easy enough for Jack Carleton.</p>

<p>"It may be this boat belongs to some other Indians who do not
live very far off, and if they should come down and find me sailing
away with it, I don't know what would follow."</p>

<p>However, the opportunity was the very one he was anxious to secure,
and he was too wise to allow any fancy that might cross his mind
to frighten him from turning it to the best account. Guiding the
canoe to the middle of the creek, he faced down current, and used
his improvised paddle with all the skill and strength at his command.
The stream, as I have said, ran rapidly, so that with his exertions
he made good progress.</p>

<p>He was struck with the similarity of the shores to those of the
larger stream which ran by the Indian village. The wood was dense,
and at intervals was so exuberant that it looked difficult for
a rabbit to penetrate. Then came long spaces where the forest
was so open that he could look far into its depths. The course
of the creek was so winding that he could see only a short distance
ahead, and several times his own momentum carried him close into
land before he could accommodate himself to the abrupt curve around
which he shot with no inconsiderable speed.</p>

<p>There remained the comforting thought that every minute thus
occupied was taking him further from his captors, who were without
the means of following his trail; but at the very moment when
Jack was felicitating himself on the fact, he was startled by
a most alarming discovery.</p>
