<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The deliberations conducted in London have a far-reaching importance,
and so the decision issued from the fog-veiled offices of the
Borneo Company darkened for Almayer the brilliant sunshine of
the Tropics, and added another drop of bitterness to the cup of
his disenchantments.  The claim to that part of the East Coast
was abandoned, leaving the Pantai river under the nominal power
of Holland.  In Sambir there was joy and excitement.  The slaves
were hurried out of sight into the forest and jungle, and the
flags were run up to tall poles in the Rajah's compound in expectation
of a visit from Dutch man-of-war boats.</p>

<p>The frigate remained anchored outside the mouth of the river,
and the boats came up in tow of the steam launch, threading their
way cautiously amongst a crowd of canoes filled with gaily dressed
Malays.  The officer in command listened gravely to the loyal
speeches of Lakamba, returned the salaams of Abdulla, and assured
those gentlemen in choice Malay of the great Rajah's&mdash;down in
Batavia&mdash;friendship and goodwill towards the ruler and inhabitants
of this model state of Sambir.</p>

<p>Almayer from his verandah watched across the river the festive
proceedings, heard the report of brass guns saluting the new flag
presented to Lakamba, and the deep murmur of the crowd of spectators
surging round the stockade.  The smoke of the firing rose in white
clouds on the green background of the forests, and he could not
help comparing his own fleeting hopes to the rapidly disappearing
vapour.  He was by no means patriotically elated by the event,
yet he had to force himself into a gracious behaviour when, the
official reception being over, the naval officers of the Commission
crossed the river to pay a visit to the solitary white man of
whom they had heard, no doubt wishing also to catch a glimpse
of his daughter.  In that they were disappointed, Nina refusing
to show herself; but they seemed easily consoled by the gin and
cheroots set before them by the hospitable Almayer; and sprawling
comfortably on the lame armchairs under the shade of the verandah,
while the blazing sunshine outside seemed to set the great river
simmering in the heat, they filled the little bungalow with the
unusual sounds of European languages, with noise and laughter
produced by naval witticisms at the expense of the fat Lakamba
whom they had been complimenting so much that very morning.  The
younger men in an access of good fellowship made their host talk,
and Almayer, excited by the sight of European faces, by the sound
of European voices, opened his heart before the sympathising strangers,
unaware of the amusement the recital of his many misfortunes caused
to those future admirals.  They drank his health, wished him many
big diamonds and a mountain of gold, expressed even an envy of
the high destinies awaiting him yet.  Encouraged by so much friendliness,
the greyheaded and foolish dreamer invited his guests to visit
his new house. They went there through the long grass in a straggling
procession while their boats were got ready for the return down
the river in the cool of the evening.  And in the great empty
rooms where the tepid wind entering through the sashless windows
whirled gently the dried leaves and the dust of many days of neglect,
Almayer in his white jacket and flowered sarong, surrounded by
a circle of glittering uniforms, stamped his foot to show the
solidity of the neatly-fitting floors and expatiated upon the
beauties and convenience of the building.  They listened and assented,
amazed by the wonderful simplicity and the foolish hopefulness
of the man, till Almayer, carried away by his excitement, disclosed
his regret at the non-arrival of the English, "who knew how to
develop a rich country," as he expressed it.  There was a general
laugh amongst the Dutch officers at that unsophisticated statement,
and a move was made towards the boats; but when Almayer, stepping
cautiously on the rotten boards of the Lingard jetty, tried to
approach the chief of the Commission with some timid hints anent
the protection required by the Dutch subject against the wily
Arabs, that salt water diplomat told him significantly that the
Arabs were better subjects than Hollanders who dealt illegally
in gunpowder with the Malays.  The innocent Almayer recognised
there at once the oily tongue of Abdulla and the solemn persuasiveness
of Lakamba, but ere he had time to frame an indignant protest
the steam launch and the string of boats moved rapidly down the
river leaving him on the jetty, standing open-mouthed in his surprise
and anger.  There are thirty miles of river from Sambir to the
gem-like islands of the estuary where the frigate was awaiting
the return of the boats.  The moon rose long before the boats
had traversed half that distance, and the black forest sleeping
peacefully under her cold rays woke up that night to the ringing
laughter in the small flotilla provoked by some reminiscence of
Almayer's lamentable narrative.  Salt-water jests at the poor
man's expense were passed from boat to boat, the non-appearance
of his daughter was commented upon with severe displeasure, and
the half-finished house built for the reception of Englishmen
received on that joyous night the name of "Almayer's Folly" by
the unanimous vote of the lighthearted seamen.</p>

<p>For many weeks after this visit life in Sambir resumed its even
and uneventful flow.  Each day's sun shooting its morning rays
above the treetops lit up the usual scene of daily activity. 
Nina walking on the path that formed the only street in the settlement
saw the accustomed sight of men lolling on the shady side of the
houses, on the high platforms; of women busily engaged in husking
the daily rice; of naked brown children racing along the shady
and narrow paths leading to the clearings.  JimEng, strolling
before his house, greeted her with a friendly nod before climbing
up indoors to seek his beloved opium pipe.  The elder children
clustered round her, daring from long acquaintance, pulling the
skirts of her white robe with their dark fingers, and showing
their brilliant teeth in expectation of a shower of glass beads. 
She greeted them with a quiet smile, but always had a few friendly
words for a Siamese girl, a slave owned by Bulangi, whose numerous
wives were said to be of a violent temper.  Well-founded rumour
said also that the domestic squabbles of that industrious cultivator
ended generally in a combined assault of all his wives upon the
Siamese slave.  The girl herself never complained&mdash;perhaps from
dictates of prudence, but more likely through the strange, resigned
apathy of half-savage womankind.  From early morning she was to
be seen on the paths amongst the houses&mdash;by the riverside or on
the jetties, the tray of pastry, it was her mission to sell, skilfully
balanced on her head.  During the great heat of the day she usually
sought refuge in Almayer's campong, often finding shelter in a
shady corner of the verandah, where she squatted with her tray
before her, when invited by Nina.  For "Mem Putih" she had always
a smile, but the presence of Mrs. Almayer, the very sound of her
shrill voice, was the signal for a hurried departure.</p>

<p>To this girl Nina often spoke; the other inhabitants of Sambir
seldom or never heard the sound of her voice.  They got used to
the silent figure moving in their midst calm and white-robed,
a being from another world and incomprehensible to them.  Yet
Nina's life for all her outward composure, for all the seeming
detachment from the things and people surrounding her, was far
from quiet, in consequence of Mrs. Almayer being much too active
for the happiness and even safety of the household.  She had resumed
some intercourse with Lakamba, not personally, it is true (for
the dignity of that potentate kept him inside his stockade), but
through the agency of that potentate's prime minister, harbour
master, financial adviser, and general factotum.  That gentleman&mdash;of
Sulu origin&mdash;was certainly endowed with statesmanlike qualities,
although he was totally devoid of personal charms.  In truth he
was perfectly repulsive, possessing only one eye and a pockmarked
face, with nose and lips horribly disfigured by the small-pox. 
This unengaging individual often strolled into Almayer's garden
in unofficial costume, composed of a piece of pink calico round
his waist.  There at the back of the house, squatting on his heels
on scattered embers, in close proximity to the great iron boiler,
where the family daily rice was being cooked by the women under
Mrs. Almayer's superintendence, did that astute negotiator carry
on long conversations in Sulu language with Almayer's wife.  What
the subject of their discourses was might have been guessed from
the subsequent domestic scenes by Almayer's hearthstone.</p>

<p>Of late Almayer had taken to excursions up the river.  In a small
canoe with two paddlers and the faithful Ali for a steersman he
would disappear for a few days at a time.  All his movements were
no doubt closely watched by Lakamba and Abdulla, for the man once
in the confidence of Rajah Laut was supposed to be in possession
of valuable secrets.  The coast population of Borneo believes
implicitly in diamonds of fabulous value, in gold mines of enormous
richness in the interior.  And all those imaginings are heightened
by the difficulty of penetrating far inland, especially on the
north-east coast, where the Malays and the river tribes of Dyaks
or Head-hunters are eternally quarrelling.  It is true enough
that some gold reaches the coast in the hands of those Dyaks when,
during short periods of truce in the desultory warfare, they visit
the coast settlements of Malays.  And so the wildest exaggerations
are built up and added to on the slight basis of that fact.</p>

<p>Almayer in his quality of white man&mdash;as Lingard before him&mdash;had
somewhat better relations with the up-river tribes.  Yet even
his excursions were not without danger, and his returns were eagerly
looked for by the impatient Lakamba.  But every time the Rajah
was disappointed.  Vain were the conferences by the rice-pot of
his factotum Babalatchi with the white man's wife.  The white
man himself was impenetrable&mdash;impenetrable to persuasion, coaxing,
abuse; to soft words and shrill revilings; to desperate beseechings
or murderous threats; for Mrs. Almayer, in her extreme desire
to persuade her husband into an alliance with Lakamba, played
upon the whole gamut of passion.  With her soiled robe wound tightly
under the armpits across her lean bosom, her scant grayish hair
tumbled in disorder over her projecting cheek-bones, in suppliant
attitude, she depicted with shrill volubility the advantages of
close union with a man so good and so fair dealing.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go to the Rajah?" she screamed.  "Why do you go
back to those Dyaks in the great forest?  They should be killed. 
You cannot kill them, you cannot; but our Rajah's men are brave! 
You tell the Rajah where the old white man's treasure is.  Our
Rajah is good!  He is our very grandfather, Datu Besar!  He will
kill those wretched Dyaks, and you shall have half the treasure. 
Oh, Kaspar, tell where the treasure is! Tell me!  Tell me out
of the old man's surat where you read so often at night."</p>

<p>On those occasions Almayer sat with rounded shoulders bending
to the blast of this domestic tempest, accentuating only each
pause in the torrent of his wife's eloquence by an angry growl,
"There is no treasure! Go away, woman!"  Exasperated by the sight
of his patiently bent back, she would at last walk round so as
to face him across the table, and clasping her robe with one hand
she stretched the other lean arm and clawlike hand to emphasise,
in a passion of anger and contempt, the rapid rush of scathing
remarks and bitter cursings heaped on the head of the man unworthy
to associate with brave Malay chiefs.  It ended generally by Almayer
rising slowly, his long pipe in hand, his face set into a look
of inward pain, and walking away in silence.  He descended the
steps and plunged into the long grass on his way to the solitude
of his new house, dragging his feet in a state of physical collapse
from disgust and fear before that fury.  She followed to the head
of the steps, and sent the shafts of indiscriminate abuse after
the retreating form.  And each of those scenes was concluded by
a piercing shriek, reaching him far away. "You know, Kaspar, I
am your wife! your own Christian wife after your own Blanda law!" 
For she knew that this was the bitterest thing of all; the greatest
regret of that man's life.</p>

<p>All these scenes Nina witnessed unmoved.  She might have been
deaf, dumb, without any feeling as far as any expression of opinion
went.  Yet oft when her father had sought the refuge of the great
dusty rooms of "Almayer's Folly," and her mother, exhausted by
rhetorical efforts, squatted wearily on her heels with her back
against the leg of the table, Nina would approach her curiously,
guarding her skirts from betel juice besprinkling the floor, and
gaze down upon her as one might look into the quiescent crater
of a volcano after a destructive eruption.  Mrs. Almayer's thoughts,
after these scenes, were usually turned into a channel of childhood
reminiscences, and she gave them utterance in a kind of monotonous
recitative&mdash;slightly disconnected, but generally describing the
glories of the Sultan of Sulu, his great splendour, his power,
his great prowess; the fear which benumbed the hearts of white
men at the sight of his swift piratical praus.  And these muttered
statements of her grandfather's might were mixed up with bits
of later recollections, where the great fight with the "White
Devil's" brig and the convent life in Samarang occupied the principal
place.  At that point she usually dropped the thread of her narrative,
and pulling out the little brass cross, always suspended round
her neck, she contemplated it with superstitious awe.  That superstitious
feeling connected with some vague talismanic properties of the
little bit of metal, and the still more hazy but terrible notion
of some bad Djinns and horrible torments invented, as she thought,
for her especial punishment by the good Mother Superior in case
of the loss of the above charm, were Mrs. Almayer's only theological
luggage for the stormy road of life.  Mrs. Almayer had at least
something tangible to cling to, but Nina, brought up under the
Protestant wing of the proper Mrs. Vinck, had not even a little
piece of brass to remind her of past teaching.  And listening
to the recital of those savage glories, those barbarous fights
and savage feasting, to the story of deeds valorous, albeit somewhat
bloodthirsty, where men of her mother's race shone far above the
Orang Blanda, she felt herself irresistibly fascinated, and saw
with vague surprise the narrow mantle of civilised morality, in
which good-meaning people had wrapped her young soul, fall away
and leave her shivering and helpless as if on the edge of some
deep and unknown abyss.  Strangest of all, this abyss did not
frighten her when she was under the influence of the witch-like
being she called her mother.  She seemed to have forgotten in
civilised surroundings her life before the time when Lingard had,
so to speak, kidnapped her from Brow. Since then she had had Christian
teaching, social education, and a good glimpse of civilised life. 
Unfortunately her teachers did not understand her nature, and
the education ended in a scene of humiliation, in an outburst
of contempt from white people for her mixed blood.  She had tasted
the whole bitterness of it and remembered distinctly that the
virtuous Mrs. Vinck's indignation was not so much directed against
the young man from the bank as against the innocent cause of that
young man's infatuation.  And there was also no doubt in her mind
that the principal cause of Mrs. Vinck's indignation was the thought
that such a thing should happen in a white nest, where her snow-white
doves, the two Misses Vinck, had just returned from Europe, to
find shelter under the maternal wing, and there await the coming
of irreproachable men of their destiny. Not even the thought of
the money so painfully scraped together by Almayer, and so punctually
sent for Nina's expenses, could dissuade Mrs. Vinck from her virtuous
resolve.  Nina was sent away, and in truth the girl herself wanted
to go, although a little frightened by the impending change. 
And now she had lived on the river for three years with a savage
mother and a father walking about amongst pitfalls, with his head
in the clouds, weak, irresolute, and unhappy.  She had lived a
life devoid of all the decencies of civilisation, in miserable
domestic conditions; she had breathed in the atmosphere of sordid
plottings for gain, of the no less disgusting intrigues and crimes
for lust or money; and those things, together with the domestic
quarrels, were the only events of her three years' existence. 
She did not die from despair and disgust the first month, as she
expected and almost hoped for.  On the contrary, at the end of
half a year it had seemed to her that she had known no other life. 
Her young mind having been unskilfully permitted to glance at
better things, and then thrown back again into the hopeless quagmire
of barbarism, full of strong and uncontrolled passions, had lost
the power to discriminate. It seemed to Nina that there was no
change and no difference.  Whether they traded in brick godowns
or on the muddy river bank; whether they reached after much or
little; whether they made love under the shadows of the great
trees or in the shadow of the cathedral on the Singapore promenade;
whether they plotted for their own ends under the protection of
laws and according to the rules of Christian conduct, or whether
they sought the gratification of their desires with the savage
cunning and the unrestrained fierceness of natures as innocent
of culture as their own immense and gloomy forests, Nina saw only
the same manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing
the uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes. 
To her resolute nature, however, after all these years, the savage
and uncompromising sincerity of purpose shown by her Malay kinsmen
seemed at last preferable to the sleek hypocrisy, to the polite
disguises, to the virtuous pretences of such white people as she
had had the misfortune to come in contact with.  After all it
was her life; it was going to be her life, and so thinking she
fell more and more under the influence of her mother.  Seeking,
in her ignorance, a better side to that life, she listened with
avidity to the old woman's tales of the departed glories of the
Rajahs, from whose race she had sprung, and she became gradually
more indifferent, more contemptuous of the white side of her descent
represented by a feeble and traditionless father.</p>

<p>Almayer's difficulties were by no means diminished by the girl's
presence in Sambir.  The stir caused by her arrival had died out,
it is true, and Lakamba had not renewed his visits; but about
a year after the departure of the man-of-war boats the nephew
of Abdulla, Syed Reshid, returned from his pilgrimage to Mecca,
rejoicing in a green jacket and the proud title of Hadji.  There
was a great letting off of rockets on board the steamer which
brought him in, and a great beating of drums all night in Abdulla's
compound, while the feast of welcome was prolonged far into the
small hours of the morning.  Reshid was the favourite nephew and
heir of Abdulla, and that loving uncle, meeting Almayer one day
by the riverside, stopped politely to exchange civilities and
to ask solemnly for an interview.  Almayer suspected some attempt
at a swindle, or at any rate something unpleasant, but of course
consented with a great show of rejoicing.  Accordingly the next
evening, after sunset, Abdulla came, accompanied by several other
grey-beards and by his nephew.  That young man&mdash;of a very rakish
and dissipated appearance&mdash;affected the greatest indifference
as to the whole of the proceedings.  When the torch-bearers had
grouped themselves below the steps, and the visitors had seated
themselves on various lame chairs, Reshid stood apart in the shadow,
examining his aristocratically small hands with great attention. 
Almayer, surprised by the great solemnity of his visitors, perched
himself on the corner of the table with a characteristic want
of dignity quickly noted by the Arabs with grave disapproval. 
But Abdulla spoke now, looking straight past Almayer at the red
curtain hanging in the doorway, where a slight tremor disclosed
the presence of women on the other side.  He began by neatly complimenting
Almayer upon the long years they had dwelt together in cordial
neighbourhood, and called upon Allah to give him many more years
to gladden the eyes of his friends by his welcome presence.  He
made a polite allusion to the great consideration shown him (Almayer)
by the Dutch "Commissie," and drew thence the flattering inference
of Almayer's great importance amongst his own people.  He &mdash;Abdulla&mdash;was
also important amongst all the Arabs, and his nephew Reshid would
be heir of that social position and of great riches.  Now Reshid
was a Hadji.  He was possessor of several Malay women, went on
Abdulla, but it was time he had a favourite wife, the first of
the four allowed by the Prophet.  And, speaking with well-bred
politeness, he explained further to the dumbfounded Almayer that,
if he would consent to the alliance of his offspring with that
true believer and virtuous man Reshid, she would be the mistress
of all the splendours of Reshid's house, and first wife of the
first Arab in the Islands, when he &mdash;Abdulla&mdash;was called
to the joys of Paradise by Allah the All-merciful.  "You know,
Tuan," he said, in conclusion, "the other women would be her slaves,
and Reshid's house is great.  From Bombay he has brought great
divans, and costly carpets, and European furniture.  There is
also a great looking-glass in a frame shining like gold.  What
could a girl want more?"  And while Almayer looked upon him in
silent dismay Abdulla spoke in a more confidential tone, waving
his attendants away, and finished his speech by pointing out the
material advantages of such an alliance, and offering to settle
upon Almayer three thousand dollars as a sign of his sincere friendship
and the price of the girl.</p>

<p>Poor Almayer was nearly having a fit.  Burning with the desire
of taking Abdulla by the throat, he had but to think of his helpless
position in the midst of lawless men to comprehend the necessity
of diplomatic conciliation.  He mastered his impulses, and spoke
politely and coldly, saying the girl was young and as the apple
of his eye.  Tuan Reshid, a Faithful and a Hadji, would not want
an infidel woman in his harem; and, seeing Abdulla smile sceptically
at that last objection, he remained silent, not trusting himself
to speak more, not daring to refuse pointblank, nor yet to say
anything compromising.  Abdulla understood the meaning of that
silence, and rose to take leave with a grave salaam.  He wished
his friend Almayer "a thousand years," and moved down the steps,
helped dutifully by Reshid.  The torch-bearers shook their torches,
scattering a shower of sparks into the river, and the cortege
moved off, leaving Almayer agitated but greatly relieved by their
departure.  He dropped into a chair and watched the glimmer of
the lights amongst the tree trunks till they disappeared and complete
silence succeeded the tramp of feet and the murmur of voices. 
He did not move till the curtain rustled and Nina came out on
the verandah and sat in the rocking-chair, where she used to spend
many hours every day.  She gave a slight rocking motion to her
seat, leaning back with half-closed eyes, her long hair shading
her face from the smoky light of the lamp on the table.  Almayer
looked at her furtively, but the face was as impassible as ever. 
She turned her head slightly towards her father, and, speaking,
to his great surprise, in English, asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was that Abdulla here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Almayer&mdash;"just gone."</p>

<p>"And what did he want, father?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to buy you for Reshid," answered Almayer, brutally,
his anger getting the better of him, and looking at the girl as
if in expectation of some outbreak of feeling.  But Nina remained
apparently unmoved, gazing dreamily into the black night outside.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Nina," said Almayer, after a short silence and rising
from his chair, "when you go paddling alone into the creeks in
your canoe. That Reshid is a violent scoundrel, and there is no
saying what he may do.  Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>She was standing now, ready to go in, one hand grasping the curtain
in the doorway.  She turned round, throwing her heavy tresses
back by a sudden gesture.</p>

<p>"Do you think he would dare?" she asked, quickly, and then turned
again to go in, adding in a lower tone, "He would not dare.  Arabs
are all cowards."</p>

<p>Almayer looked after her, astonished.  He did not seek the repose
of his hammock.  He walked the floor absently, sometimes stopping
by the balustrade to think.  The lamp went out.  The first streak
of dawn broke over the forest; Almayer shivered in the damp air. 
"I give it up," he muttered to himself, lying down wearily.  "Damn
those women!  Well!  If the girl did not look as if she wanted
to be kidnapped!"</p>

<p>And he felt a nameless fear creep into his heart, making him
shiver again.</p>
