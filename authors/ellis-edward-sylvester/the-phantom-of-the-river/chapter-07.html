<p>Simon Kenton proceeded on the principle of the greatest good
to the greatest number.</p>

<p>When, with consummate delicacy and skill, he withdrew the canoe
from under the very nose of the sleeping Shawanoe, and noiselessly
impelled it across the open space under the screening undergrowth
on the other side, he did not dare to call to Jethro Juggens to
join him, through fear that the slight noise would rouse the Indian
only a few yards off, sitting with his back against a tree and
his head bowed on his chest.</p>

<p>Instead, he stepped ashore and picked his way to where he had
left him, only to find, as has been shown, that the colored youth,
in the face of positive instructions, had gone elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Sarves me right for bringing him with me," repeated the disgusted
pioneer. "I might have knowed he'd do something of the kind."</p>

<p>In his impatience, he turned to leave the spot without further
tarrying, but his partiality for the youth, whose skill in handling
the rifle was so remarkable, caused him to linger a few moments
and emit a couple of guarded signals.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Jethro Juggens just then was inside the cabin making
his evening meal, it is unnecessary to say that Kenton's effort
was without success.</p>

<p>"If he did hear me he wouldn't know what it meant, and if he
did know what it meant he'd yell back his answer loud enough to
be heard at the block-house&mdash;so I'll let him look out for himself."</p>

<p>Before resuming his place in the canoe the ranger stole to a
point near the edge of the clearing, where, by cautiously parting
the undergrowth and peering out, he could look across to the flatboat
and catch the outlines of the sleeping Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The pioneer was just in time to witness an entertaining scene.</p>

<p>The providential slumber of the warrior was what in ordinary
parlance may be described as a "cat nap," inasmuch as it came
to an end, of its own accord, a moment after Kenton took his last
peep at him.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe raised his chin, and then in the most natural manner
in the world, rubbed his eyes by gouging his forefingers into
them, just as all boys and girls do when their senses are coming
back to them. Next, he reached out his hand and brought his rifle
in front, doing so while in the act of rising on his feet. Then
he started, became rigid, and stared at the river as though doubting
his own vision.</p>

<p>The canoe, which was there only a short time before, was gone.</p>

<p>After all, it would seem he should have felt no great astonishment,
for, resting so lightly against the bank, it was not to be wondered
at that it worked loose and floated off.</p>

<p>The painted face was turned inquiringly in the direction of Kenton,
as though a glimmering of the truth had entered the brain of the
red man, but clearly that was impossible, and he moved along the
bank, speedily disappearing, in his search for the missing craft.</p>

<p>"He knows about how long he has slept," mused the smiling Kenton,
"and he knows the boat can't have drifted far. When he goes fur
'nough to find it, and don't find it, he'll come back there again;
he'll examine the ground, and will diskiver my footprints; he
won't know whether the moccasins belong to a white man or one
of the varmints, but he will get an idee of why the thing didn't
float down instead of up stream. Wal," muttered the ranger, "it'll
take sharper eyes than his to trail a canoe through the water,
and I don't think he'll git this ere craft ag'in in a hurry."</p>

<p>While those thoughts were in the mind of Kenton, he had re-entered
the boat again and taken up the broad ashen paddle.</p>

<p>The reader will understand the difficult task that was before
him. From the clearing to Rattlesnake Gulch was all if not more
than two miles. It was his work to reach the latter point by the
time that night was fully come.</p>

<p>Ordinarily this would have been so easy that it could not be
considered in the nature of work, but above all things it must
be accomplished without the knowledge of the Shawanoes, who, it
may be said, were on every hand. A sight of the ranger stealing
his way up stream, and the halt of the pioneers before reaching
the place fixed upon for the ambuscade, could not fail to apprise
the Indians that their intended victims had no intention of walking
into the trap set for them.</p>

<p>Since the war party would never knowingly permit the settlers
to escape them, an attack was certain to follow; and though the
veteran rangers, under the leadership of Boone and Kenton, were
confident of beating them off, yet more or less casualties were
certain to follow an attack. Some of the helpless ones would suffer;
probably several would be killed or carried off, which meant the
same thing.</p>

<p>To avert these woful afflictions was the cause of the extraordinary
precautions on the part of Boone and Kenton, especially the latter.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that the problem Simon Kenton had
set out to solve was anything but a simple one.</p>

<p>The arms which swayed the paddle, however, were sturdy and muscular,
and could keep to the task for hours without sensible fatigue.
Kenton did not mind a simple obstruction of that nature, and,
indeed, would have been glad because of the curtain thus offered
if it had continued all the way.</p>

<p>Once more and again was the frail craft impelled beneath the
limbs, its progress ceasing almost at the moment the paddle was
withdrawn from the water.</p>

<p>During these brief intervals of subsidence, the ranger listened
intently for such sounds as could tell him of the whereabouts
of his enemies. He knew, as may be said, that they were everywhere,
and he was liable to collide with them at the most unexpected
moments. The pioneers or their escort were subjected to the most
eagle-eyed vigilance.</p>

<p>For a furlong the advance continued in this laborious fashion.
Then Kenton made a longer pause than usual, for he had reached
a point where it was necessary to drive the canoe across a space
fully one hundred feet in width, and where there was nothing that
could serve to the slightest extent as a screen.</p>

<p>The ranger debated with himself as to the best course to pursue.</p>

<p>"I don't b'leve there's any varmint on the watch there," was
the conclusion of Kenton; "the Shawanoes know where the women
folks and the boys are, and that's the place that they're watching&mdash;so
here goes."</p>

<p>Again the ashen paddle was dipped in the clear current, but at
the very moment of imparting the powerful impulse to it, the ranger
checked himself with the suddenness of lightning.</p>

<p>From a point apparently directly across the river came the same
signal that had disturbed him and Boone earlier in the afternoon.
The faint cawing of a crow, as if calling from the upper branches
of a tree to his mate, floated across the Ohio to the startled
ears of the listening Kenton.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" he muttered, "if crows ain't thicker in
Kaintuck than I ever knowed 'em afore at this season of the year."</p>

<p>This signal, which the man did not doubt for a moment came from
the throat of one of the Shawanoe spies, settled the question
which he had been debating with himself.</p>

<p>Forcing the nose of the canoe against the bank, he stepped ashore.
Before drawing it entirely forth, however, he decided to walk
the short distance through the woods, so as to select the most
favorable course to follow.</p>

<p>He had not far to go, but the simple act was marked by all the
thoroughness with which he did everything relating to his life
profession.</p>

<p>While the wood, because of the abundance of undergrowth, was
not what he desired, yet he was confident of working his way through
it and back to the water again without injuring the canoe. He
set out to do so, returning to the starting-point at the end of
fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>And there a surprise awaited him. The boat was gone!</p>

<p>If he had withdrawn it with incredible deftness from under the
closed eyes of the Shawanoe, that same individual (for it must
be he) had displayed hardly less cleverness in snatching it from
his grasp.</p>

<p>Kenton lost no time in speculating over the matter, but hurried
swiftly and noiselessly along the bank in quest of the daring
thief. He came upon him, only a few rods distant, making his way
with great care and skill along the bank, as though he had no
fear of any dispute over the ownership of the craft, as, indeed,
he did not; for, catching sight of the white man at the same instant
the latter saw him, he leaped ashore, and, knife in hand, attacked
him with the impetuous fury of a jungle tiger.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when Simon Kenton resumed possession of the
canoe, he muttered, with grim significance:</p>

<p>"Sometimes a varmint makes a mistake; that air varmint made one,
but he'll never make another, 'cause when the chance comes he
won't be there!"</p>
