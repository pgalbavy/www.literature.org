<p>On a tempestuous night in midwinter the little settlement of
Coatesville, in Kentucky, was assailed by a fierce band of Shawanoes
and Hurons.  The pioneers were surprised, for the hour was near
daybreak, and, accustomed as they were to the forays of the border,
they were without the slightest warning of the danger which burst
upon them.  They rallied, however, and made an heroic defense,
but when with the dawning of day the warriors withdrew, they left
more than half the hearthstones darkened with sorrow and woe,
because of one or more of its defenders who had fallen in the
strife.</p>

<p>Among those that had perished was Abram Carleton, shot down on
his own threshold while fighting for his wife and his boy Jack,
who themselves were doing their utmost to beat back their merciless
enemies.</p>

<p>The youth, as he grew older, gradually recovered from his grief,
but the blow was so terrible to the stricken widow that its effect
remained with her through all the years that followed.  The vivacious,
bright-hearted wife became the sad, thoughtful woman, who rarely
smiled, and who walked forever in the shadow of her desolation. 
She had only her boy Jack, and to him she gave the whole wealth
of her attention; but she could never forget the brave one that
had yielded his life for her and her child.</p>

<p>Some years later a portion of the settlers became dissatisfied
with their home, peculiarly exposed as it was to attacks from
marauding red men, and determined to cross the Mississippi into
that portion of Louisiana which to-day forms the great State of
Missouri.</p>

<p>To many it seemed a strange refuge, for the change, it may be
said, took them still further from civilization; but the reader
well knows that the settlement of no portion of the Union was
marked by such deeds of ferocity as that of the Dark and Bloody
Ground, and the pioneers had good grounds to hope for better things
in the strange land toward which they turned their footsteps.</p>

<p>The lead mines of Missouri attracted notice a early as 1720,
and Saint Genevieve, its oldest town, was founded in 1755.  At
the breaking out of the Revolution, St. Louis contained nearly
a thousand inhabitants, the country at that time belonging to
Spain, and a considerable fur trade was carried on with the Indians.</p>

<p>Among those who crossed the Mississippi was the widow Carleton. 
Her friends believed that if she removed forever from the scene
of her great affliction she might recover; but if she remained
she must soon succumb.  She suffered herself to be persuaded,
and went in the company of those who promised to give her the
tenderest attention and care.</p>

<p>Her decision was not made until the little company, that had
spent weeks in preparation, was on the eve of starting.  It thus
became necessary for Jack to stay behind to look after certain
interests of both, his purpose being to follow in the course of
a few weeks.</p>

<p>The long journey westward was made in safety, a thriving settlement
begun, and young Otto Relstaub, the son of a hard-hearted, penurious
German, was sent back over the trail, according to promise, to
guide Jack Carleton, who was impatiently awaiting him.  The next
morning after his arrival the two started westward, all their
earthly effects packed upon the single horse.</p>

<p>They took turns in riding the animal.  Accustomed as they were
to constant activity, they would have enjoyed the journey on foot
much more than on horseback.  At first both walked, but, after
their animal had run away several times, his capture causing much
delay, trouble, and roiling of temper, they concluded that a change
would have to be made if they expected ever to reach their destination.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when Otto was riding considerably in advance of
his friend, he was fired upon by Indians, narrowly escaping with
his life. The incidents immediately following have already been
told the reader.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the evening when Deerfoot the Shawanoe acted
upon the request of Otto, that some more convenient spot should
be selected in which to continue their talk.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the destination of the boys lay to the westward,
it seemed to Jack Carleton that, the wisest thing to do was to
enter the canoe, and allow the young Shawanoe to paddle them across;
but he held the gifts and skill of the wonderful warrior in such
high estimation that he feared a hint of the kind might not be
received with favor.</p>

<p>Deerfoot led the way through the wood until a depression was
reached, where considerable undergrowth grew.  He came to a stop
and seemed to be looking around in the darkness, which to the
others was impenetrable.</p>

<p>"Let a fire be kindled," said he.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes were needed to gather all the fuel required. 
It was heaped against the trunk of a tree, and as each carried
a flint and steel, a bright roaring blaze was soon under way.</p>

<p>Had Jack and Otto been alone, they would have been troubled by
the fear that their campfire would be seen by prowling enemies
but the air of unconcern on the part of the Shawanoe infused into
them a feeling of confidence which drove away all fear.</p>

<p>Enough branches and leaves were piled together to afford them
the best sort of couch.  Not one had it blanket with him, and
had the weather been cold, they must have suffered not a little. 
The boys had lost theirs when their horse ran away the last time,
and Deerfoot had not brought any with him, though one remained
in his canoe.</p>

<p>Fortunately the night was not only mild, but scarcely a breath
of air was stirring.  The fire radiated all the heat needed to
make each comfortable.  They assumed easy postures on the ground,
and, as the reflection lit up each countenance, they looked curiously
at one another, as if seeking more intimate knowledge of their
appearance.</p>

<p>Deerfoot and Jack have already been sufficiently referred to,
and a little attention is due to the honest German youth, who
has his part to play in the following pages.</p>

<p>Otto was about a year younger than his friend, and bore very
little resemblance to him.  Jack possessed a certain rugged grace,
and, while he was not handsome, his face showed intelligence with
mental strength, sustained by bounding youth, and a physical vigor
which was perfect.</p>

<p>Otto was a head shorter than Jack, and his growth seemed to run
mostly to breadth.  His short legs bowed outward at the knees,
and a curve seemed necessary in order to preserve the harmony
of general expanse.</p>

<p>His face was very wide, the small twinkling eyes fax apart, and
the funny pug nose inclined in the same direction.  His neck was
short, and hair long and thick.  His dress was similar to that
worn by Jack Carleton, except that everything, even to the shoes,
were of the coarsest possible nature.</p>

<p>Jacob Relstaub, the father of Otto, was not merely penurious,
but he was miserly and mean.  Jack Carleton knew him so well that
he was certain there would be serious trouble with the lad if
he showed himself in the little frontier town without the valuable
horse which had run away and swam the river.</p>

<p>There was one respect in which the dress of the German differed
from that of the American.  Instead of wearing a cap, he was furnished
with a hat something similar to those seen in some portions of
the Tyrol.  It had a brim of moderate width, and the crown gradually
tapered until it attained a height of six inches, where it ended
in it point.  The thrifty mother possessed a secret of imparting
a stiffness to the head gear which caused it to keep its shape,
except when limp from moisture.</p>

<p>Such youths as Otto and Jack are always blessed with the most
vigorous appetites, but they had eaten during the afternoon and
were well content to wait until the morrow.  As for Deerfoot,
it made little difference to him whether he had partaken since
the rising of the sun, for he had been taught from his infancy
to hold every propensity of his nature in the sternest check. 
Oft-times he went hungry for no other purpose than that of self-discipline.</p>

<p>"How was it you came to meet Otto?" asked Jack of the dusky youth,
who, assuming an easy position on the ground, was examining his
bow. He looked up, smiled faintly, and hesitated a moment before
answering.</p>

<p>"Two suns ago Deerfoot came upon a log cabin.  It was raining
and cold, and he was a long ways from home.  He saw the glimmer
of a light and reached for the latch-string, but it was pulled
in.  He knocked on the door and it was opened by the man who lived
there. Deerfoot asked that he might stay till morning, but the
pale face called him an Indian dog, and said that if he did not
hasten away he would shoot him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you know who dot vos?" interrupted Otto, whose face seemed
to grow wider with its immense grin.</p>

<p>"How should I know." asked Jack, in turn.</p>

<p>"Dot was mine fader.  I dinks yon vosn't such a fool dot you
wouldn't know dot right away."</p>

<p>"I knew that he was the stingiest man in Kentucky, but I didn't
suppose you spelled his name 'h-o-g."'</p>

<p>"Dot's just de way to spell it," said Otto, slapping his friend
on the shoulder and laughing as though pleased beyond measure. 
"Wait till you don't know him as well as I don't."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot turned to walk away," continued the young Shawanoe;
"he had slept many times in the wood, and he was not afraid, but
he had not taken many steps when some one called him.  It was
too dark to see, but the voice was of a boy.  While Deerfoot waited
he threw a heavy, blanket over his shoulders and made Deerfoot
walk back to the cabin.  He asked him to enter the window where
the father could not see him, and he told Deerfoot he would place
him in his bed and he should have food."</p>

<p>The narrator paused in his story and glanced toward Otto Relstaub.
Jack, with a laugh, looked at the stubby youngster, who was blushing
deeply and holding one hand over his face, the fingers spread
so far apart that he could see the others.  Otto was also smiling,
and his hand could not begin to hide it, so that each side of
his mouth wits in sight.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot was too proud to receive the offer of the boy, but
he took the blanket."</p>

<p>"And mine gracious!" struck in the lad again; "didn't mine fader
whip me for dat?  He proke up three hickory sticks onto me and
kept me dancing out of de cabin and in again, and over the roof,
till I vos so disgusted as nefer vos."</p>

<p>"How did you explain the absence of the blanket?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I told mine fader I didn't know not any nodings apout it, and
he whipped me 'cause I didn't know vot I did know, and, when Deerfoot
brought pack de blanket next day, den he knows dat I lied and
he whipped some more as nefer pefore."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton threw back his bead and laughed, though he took
care that he made little noise in doing so; but the face of the
Shawanoe was grave.  His refined nature could see nothing mirthful
in the cruel punishment inflicted upon the boy because he did
a kindness to a stranger of another race.  The brutal father had
only to thank the Christian restraint of Deerfoot that he was
not pierced by an arrow from his bow for his conduct.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe did not need explain that the little act of Otto
had secured his lasting gratitude.  The latter was not one to
seek his company or intrude himself upon him; but he was ready
to do the young German any service in his power.</p>

<p>A few days before, when Deerfoot was returning from the direction
of the Mississippi, he met Otto on horseback.  The latter told
him he was going to Coatesville to bring back a young friend,
whose mother was in the new settlement.  For some reason, which
the Shawanoe did not make known, he could not accompany Otto,
or he would have done so; but he gave him full directions and
numerous suggestions, every one of which Otto forgot within the
following fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, however, after making some calculations as to the time
the boys would reach the Mississippi on their return, promised
to meet them there and to take them across in his canoe, which
was hidden not far away.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe particularly instructed Otto that, if the meeting
should take place at night, he would make known his departure
from the Louisiana side by swinging a torch in a circular manner. 
It was this signal which recalled the agreement to the mind of
Otto Relstaub, who remembered much more than he would have Jack
Carleton believe.</p>
