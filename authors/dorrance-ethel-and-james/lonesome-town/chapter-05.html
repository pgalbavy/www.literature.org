<p>Reaching the box which, according to his count of doors, should contain
her, Peter Pape tried the door; opened it; stepped into and across the
small cloak-room; looked through the brocaded hangings of the outer box.
There she sat, just behind the bobbed youngster, an example of how
different one black-haired girl can look from another. Her eyes, of the
blue of tropic seas—calm, deep, mysterious—opened to his in surprise. He
felt the other eyes in the box upon him, five pairs in all. But he
looked only into hers—into the eyes that had summoned him.
</p>
<p>Quick at detail, he appreciated at a glance more than the general effect
of her. Her gown was of silver lace, a moonlight shimmer that lent a
paling sheen to her shoulders and arms. She wore no ornaments, except a
cluster of purplish forget-me-nots. As if one could forget anything
about her! Forget those long, strong lines of her, not too thin nor yet
too sturdy—those untinted cheeks of an oval blending gently into a chin
that was neither hard nor weak—those parted, definitely dented lips,
their healthful red indubitable—that black, soft, femininely long hair,
simply parted and done in a knot on her neck?
</p><p>More than at the greater distance, she looked the sort he liked. Did she
like the looks of him? He could not voice the question direct, as in his
calculations, with eight ears beside her own to hear. But he
concentrated on the silent demand that she try to do so as he crossed to
her with hand outstretched.
</p><p>“I am so glad,” said he, “to see you again.”
</p><p>Her hand relaxed in his clasp. She rose to her feet; drew up to the full
height of her well-poised slenderness. Her expression was neither
welcoming nor forbidding; rather was the puzzled, half-ashamed and
wholly honest look of a child who can’t remember.
</p><p>“Didn’t you ask me to come?”
</p><p>He bent to her with the low-spoken question; met her eyes as seriously
as through the lenses a moment since; waited breathlessly for the test
of just how fearless and frank was she. With hope he saw a faint flush
spread forward from her ears and tinge delightfully her pallor. Already
he had felt the agitation of it in her finger-tips. Relief came with her
first words.
</p><p>“Yes, I know I did,” she said.
</p><p>She knew. Yes, she <u>knew</u>. And she had the courage to say so. She not
only looked—she <u>was</u> the sort he liked.
</p><p>Whether from suggestion of his hand or her own volition, she stepped
with him to the back of the box. He did not give her time to deny him,
even to himself alone. With inspired assurance he urged:
</p><p>“I have crossed a continent to meet you. Don’t let your friends see that
you failed to recognize me at first. It takes only a moment to know me.
Give me that moment.”
</p><p>“Am I not giving it?” She looked still puzzled, still flushed, still
brave. But she withdrew her hand and with it something of her
confidence.
</p><p>Would she deny him, after all, once she understood? She mustn’t be
allowed to.
</p><p>“Give me the moment toward which I’ve lived my life,” he said. “You
won’t regret it. Look at me. Recognize me. Trust me.”
</p><p>During the grave glance which she slanted slightly upward to his
six-feet-flat, she obeyed; studied him; seemed to reach some decision
regarding him, just what he had to surmise.
</p><p>“The surprise of meeting you—here—at the opera——” she began hesitantly.
“Seeing so many people, I think, confuses me. Somehow, personalities and
places get all scrambled in my memory. Do forgive me—but you are from——”
</p><p>“Montana, of course,” he prompted her.
</p><p>“Oh!” She considered. Then: “I’ve been to the Yellowstone. It was
there—that we met? I begin—to remember that——”
</p><p>“That I’m a personal friend of Horace Albright, the superintendent,” he
supplied, quick to seize the opportunity she had made to speak a true,
good word for himself. “Every one of the Spread-Eagle Ranger force, from
Jim McBride down, calls me by my first name, so you see that I am no
tusk-hunter. You can’t have forgotten the snap of the air on those
early-morning Y-stone rides or the colors of the border peaks in the
afternoon sun or——”
</p><p>“Or the spray of Old Faithful, the painted colors of the cañon, the
whole life of the wild. Never. Never,” she contributed. “I was
fascinated with the breadth and freedom of your West. Out there I felt
like Alice in Wonderland, with everything possible.”
</p><p>His eyes reproached her. “Everything is possible everywhere, even in
your narrow, circumscribed East. I am glad that you remember the
worth-while things. Perhaps, if you try——”
</p><p>“Jane dar-rling, do you want to sit brazenly in front or modestly in
back for the second act? That first was enough to put the Mona Lisa out
of countenance. But I’ve heard that a little child saves the second.”
</p><p>The interruption came from the bobbed-haired girl, who, from her
repeated glances their way, evidently thought their aside somewhat
protracted.
</p><p>So “Jane” was the favorite, old-fashioned name she glorified! Pape was
further thrilled by the touch of her hand on his arm.
</p><p>“Do forgive me and help me out,” she said low and hurriedly. “Some
hypnotist must have given me mental suggestion that I was to forget
names. I am constantly embarrassed by lapses like this. Quick—I’ll have
to introduce you.”
</p><p>“Peter Pape.” Gladly he supplied the lack.
</p><p>With considerable poise she announced him as “a friend from the
Yellowstone,” who had happened in unexpectedly and been reviving
memories of that most delightful summer she had spent in the West. If
she accented ever so slightly the “revived memories” or flashed him a
confused look with the pronouncement of his name, none but he noticed.
And he did not care. Whether deceived by his high-handed play or playing
a higher hand herself, she hadn’t thrown him out. Now she
wouldn’t—couldn’t. He was her “friend” from the Yellowstone—near enough
home, at that, since Hellroaring Valley was right next door. She was
committed to his commitment. His theory was proving beyond anything he
could have hoped, had he wasted time on hope after evolving it.
</p><p>In turn she named Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Allen, a middle-aged couple who
supplied ample dignity and chaperonage for the younger element of the
box party; Mr. Mills Harford, a genial, sophisticated and well-built
young man, who would have been called handsome by one with a taste for
auburn hair, brown eyes and close-cropped mustaches; Miss Sturgis, her
little cousin—she of the bobbed hair, filet of pearls and affectionate
address.
</p><p>Even in her grown-up, down-cut evening gown of Nile-green, the girl
didn’t look more than fifteen—couldn’t have exceeded nineteen without
violating all laws of appearances. Despite her excessive use of
make-up—blued-over eyelids, plucked brows, darkened lashes, thick-pasted
lips and high-colored cheeks—Cousin “Irene” was quite beautiful. And her
manner proved as assertively brilliant as her looks.
</p><p>“Mr. —— Pape?” she demanded thinkingly. “Have I met you before or heard
of you——”
</p><p>His hand on his heart, he bowed toward her. “Why-Not Pape.”
</p><p>She stared at him much as she had at the sign.
</p><p>“You don’t claim to be—— Don’t tell me that you are—— Then you’re <u>not</u>
a breakfast-food?”
</p><p>“Nothing so enlivening. Not even anti-fat,” he apologized in
broad-smiling return.
</p><p>“Oh—<u>oh</u>!” she gasped. “You <u>couldn’t</u> have overheard what I said in the
car coming down?”
</p><p>“From the curb, Miss Sturgis.”
</p><p>“And you recognized me here in the box and that’s why—Dar-rling—” the
endearment was drawled with a brief glance toward her relative—“isn’t
that just too <u>utterly</u> romantic?”
</p><p>“I hope, Irene, not <u>too</u> utterly.”
</p><p>Jane’s quiet reply started a smile wreathing around the little circle,
evidently of amusement over the child-vamp’s personal assumption of all
honors.
</p><p>Samuel Allen interposed in a tone of butter-melting benignity: “Any
friend of Miss Lauderdale is more than welcome to our city so far as I
am concerned.”
</p><p>“Rawther! And welcome—thrice welcome to our midst,” the madcap again
interpolated, seizing one of his large, brown hands in both her white,
bejeweled, small ones.
</p><p>“Dee-lighted!” Pape breathed, returning the extra shake.
</p><p>Indeed, he felt delighted. She was <u>Miss</u> Jane Lauderdale, the reserved,
long-haired relative of this short-haired enthusiast. And she wore no
engagement ring—not any ring on any finger. He could only hope that she
had no “understanding” with the good-looking chap ranged beside her. If
so, she’d have to be made to mis-understand. She was more flustered over
his acceptance of the unconscious invitation of that long, strange,
magnified look than she had at first appeared. That showed in the tight
clutch of her fingers on her feather fan. And she was taller than he had
calculated—just enough shorter than he for ideal dancing. One thing
about her he needed to decide, but couldn’t. Did she or did she not know
that she didn’t know him?
</p><p>But he must pay attention. Irene, continuing to baby-vamp him, waved him
into the chair beside that into which she had sunk. Although of
necessity she had dropped his hand she released neither his interest nor
his eyes.
</p><p>“You must be just a terribly important person to be flashed all over
Broadway in that rosy wreath. I don’t blame your friends, though, for
feeling a bit extravagant over you. We were talking about the sign
before you came in—were guessing what kingdom you belong to, animal,
vegetable or mineral. Millsy Harford here held out that you were more
likely some manufactured product than anti-fat. Isn’t it all quite too
funny for anything?”
</p><p>“My folks used to say, from the rate of speed at which I grew up—” Pape
applied to his ready store of persiflage—“that I was more like a
vegetable than a boy. _I_ always thought I was animal, judging by my
appetite, you know. But my life’s been kind of lived with minerals.
Maybe I’m all three.”
</p><p>“How interesting.” Mrs. Allen, a lady faded to medium in coloring, age
and manner, turned from an over-rail inspection of some social notable
among the horseshoe’s elect to survey him through her lorgnette. “Just
why, if I am not too personal, are you called ‘Why-Not?’”
</p><p>“My nickname about the headwaters of our greatest river, madam.”
</p><p>From her look of vague perplexity Pape turned his glance around the
group until it halted for a study of Jane Lauderdale’s face—again Irish
pale, tropic-eyed, illegible. He chose his further words with care.
</p><p>“Guess I was the first to ask myself that question after the boys hung
the sobri. on me and nailed it there,” he said, addressing himself to
none in particular. “I made the interesting discovery that there wasn’t
any answer, although there are limitless answers to almost every
seemingly unanswerable question. You see, when I find myself up against
the impossible, I just ask myself why not and buck it. I’ve found the
impossible a boogey-boo.”
</p><p>“You call yourself, then, a possible person?”
</p><p>He was not to be discountenanced by Jane’s quiet insertion.
</p><p>“Everything worth while that I’ve got in the past I owe to that belief,”
he maintained. “It happens that I want some few extras in my near
future. That’s how I’ll get ’em, from realizing that nothing—<u>absolutely
nothing</u>—is impossible.”
</p><p>Considerable of a speech this was for him. Yet he could see that he had
made something of an impression by its delivery. One moment he marveled
at his own assurance; the next wanted to know any good and substantial
reason why he shouldn’t feel assured. He had made himself, to be sure.
But probably he had done the job better than any one else could have
done it for him. At least he had been thorough. And his efforts had paid
in cash, if that counted.
</p><p>A stir in the house—rather, a settling into silence—presaged the parting
of the curtains on Act II. Mills Harford who, as had developed, was the
host of the evening, began to rearrange the chairs to the better
advantage of the fair of his party. The interloper felt the obligation
at least of offering to depart. Irene it was who saved him. With a pout
of the most piquantly bowed pair of lips upon which female ever had used
unnecessary stick, she dared him to wish to watch the second act with
her as much as she wished him to.
</p><p>Pape could not keep down the thrill she gave him—she and the situation.
To think that he, so lately the wearer of an Indian sign, should be
begged to stay in such a circle! Only for a moment did he affect
reluctance. During it, he glanced across at the box that was his by
right of rental, with its content of brightly attired “true-lovers”
blooming above the rail; smiled into the challenge of the precocious
child’s black eyes; sank into the chair just behind her.
</p><p>“Your friends over there look better able to do without you than I
feel,” Irene ventured, with an over-shoulder sigh. “I don’t know who in
the world they are, but——”
</p><p>“No more do I, Miss Sturgis.”
</p><p>“You don’t? You mean——”
</p><p>“Righto. Just met up with ’em in the lobby. They hadn’t any seats and I
had more than I could use without exerting myself.”
</p><p>“How nice! Then they have only half as much right to you as I have. You
see, I, as well as Miss Lauderdale, have met you before.”
</p><p>“Down Broadway, you mean, and although you didn’t know it?”
</p><p>She nodded back at him tenderly. “And although separated by
circumstances—I in the car and you on the curb. From my cousin’s
descriptions, I adore rangers. Don’t I, dar-rling?”
</p><p>“No one could doubt that, eh, Jane?” Harford made answer for Miss
Lauderdale, whom he had relieved of her fan with as much solicitude as
though each ostrich feather weighed a pound.
</p><p>“I do really. <u>Why not</u>?” Low and luringly Irene laughed. “You must look
awfully picturesque in your uniform of forest green, your cavalry hat
and laced boots.”
</p><p>“Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m a cowman, not a ranger,” Pape thought
advisable to state in a tone calculated to reach the ears of her
responsible for his presence in their midst. “But most of the park
service members are my friends. I live on the edge of the playground and
know them right well.”
</p><p>The young girl refused to have her enthusiasm quashed. “Well, that’s
just as good. You have their spirit without being tied to the stake of
routine, as it were. I detest routine, don’t you? Or <u>do</u> you? On second
thought, you’re much better off. Don’t <u>you</u> think he is, dar-rling?”
</p><p>In the dimming of the auditorium lights, she leaned closer to him;
seemed to transfer the fulsomely drawled term of endearment from her
relative to him; added in a cross between murmur and whisper:
</p><p>“Isn’t dar-rling a difficult word—hard to say seriously? Fancy caring
that much for any one—I mean any one of one’s own sex. Of course, I hope
really to love a man that much some day. That is, I do unless I go in
for a career. Careers <u>do</u> keep one from getting fat, though. As I am
constantly telling my mother——”
</p><p>“S-sh!”
</p><p>Pape was relieved by Mrs. Allen’s silencing sibilant.
