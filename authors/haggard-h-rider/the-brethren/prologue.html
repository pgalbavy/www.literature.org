<strong>Dedication</strong>

<p>R.M.S. Mongolia, 12th May, 1904 Mayhap, Ella, here too distance
lends its enchantment, and these gallant brethren would have
quarrelled over Rosamund, or even had their long swords at each
other's throat. Mayhap that Princess and heroine might have
failed in the hour of her trial and never earned her saintly
crown. Mayhap the good horse "Smoke" would have fallen on the
Narrow Way, leaving false Lozelle a victor, and Masouda, the
royal-hearted, would have offered up a strangely different
sacrifice upon the altars of her passionate desire.</p>

<p>Still, let us hold otherwise, though we grow grey and know the
world for what it is. Let us for a little time think as we
thought while we were young; when faith knew no fears for
anything and death had not knocked upon our doors; when you
opened also to my childish eyes that gate of ivory and pearl
which leads to the blessed kingdom of Romance.</p>

<p>At the least I am sure, and I believe that you, my sister, will
agree with me, that, above and beyond its terrors and its
pitfalls, Imagination has few finer qualities, and none, perhaps,
more helpful to our hearts, than those which enable us for an
hour to dream that men and women, their fortunes and their fate,
are as we would fashion them.<p>

<pre>"Two lovers by the maiden sate, Without a glance of jealous
hate; The maid her lovers sat between, With open brow and equal
mien;--It is a sight but rarely spied, Thanks to man's wrath and
woman's pride."

<p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: Standing a while ago upon the flower-clad plain
above Tiberius, by the Lake of Galilee, the writer gazed at the
double peaks of the Hill of Hattin. Here, or so tradition says,
Christ preached the Sermon on the Mount--that perfect rule of
gentleness and peace. Here, too--and this is certain--after
nearly twelve centuries had gone by, Yusuf Salah-ed-din, whom we
know as the Sultan Saladin, crushed the Christian power in
Palestine in perhaps the most terrible battle which that land of
blood has known. Thus the Mount of the Beatitudes became the
Mount of Massacre.
</p><p>Whilst musing on these strangely-contrasted scenes enacted in one
place there arose in his mind a desire to weave, as best he
might, a tale wherein any who are drawn to the romance of that
pregnant and mysterious epoch, when men by thousands were glad to
lay down their lives for visions and spiritual hopes, could find
a picture, however faint and broken, of the long war between
Cross and Crescent waged among the Syrian plains and deserts. Of
Christian knights and ladies also, and their loves and sufferings
in England and the East; of the fearful lord of the Assassins
whom the Franks called Old Man of the Mountain, and his fortress
city, Masyaf. Of the great-hearted, if at times cruel Saladin
and his fierce Saracens; of the rout at Hattin itself, on whose
rocky height the Holy Rood was set up as a standard and captured,
to be seen no more by Christian eyes; and of the Iast surrender,
whereby the Crusaders lost Jerusalem forever.
</p><p>Of that desire this story is the fruit.
</p>
<p><strong>PROLOGUE</strong>
</p>
<p>Salah-ed-din, Commander of the Faithful, the king Strong to Aid,
Sovereign of the East, sat at night in his palace at Damascus and
brooded on the wonderful ways of God, by Whom he had been lifted
to his high estate. He remembered how, when he was but small in
the eyes of men, Nour-ed-din, king of Syria, forced him to
accompany his uncle, Shirkuh, to Egypt, whither he went, "like
one driven to his death," and how, against his own will, there he
rose to greatness. He thought of his father, the wise Ayoub, and
the brethren with whom he was brought up, all of them dead now
save one; and of his sisters, whom he had cherished. Most of all
did he think of her, Zobeide, who had been stolen away by the
knight whom she loved even to the loss of her own soul--yes, by
the English friend of his youth, his father's prisoner, Sir
Andrew D'Arcy, who, led astray by passion, had done him and his
house this grievous wrong. He had sworn, he remembered, that he
would bring her back even from England, and already had planned
to kill her husband and capture her when he learned her death.
She had left a child, or so his spies told him, who, if she still
lived, must be a woman now--his own niece, though half of noble
English blood.
</p><p>Then his mind wandered from this old, half-forgotten story to the
woe and blood in which his days were set, and to the last great
struggle between the followers of the prophets Jesus and Mahomet,
that Jihad [Holy War] for which he made ready--and he sighed. For
he was a merciful man, who loved not slaughter, although his
fierce faith drove him from war to war.
</p><p>Salah-ed-din slept and dreamed of peace. In his dream a maiden
stood before him. Presently, when she lifted her veil, he saw
that she was beautiful, with features like his own, but fairer,
and knew her surely for the daughter of his sister who had fled
with the English knight. Now he wondered why she visited him
thus, and in his vision prayed Allah to make the matter clear.
Then of a sudden he saw this same woman standing before him on a
Syrian plain, and on either side of her a countless host of
Saracens and Franks, of whom thousands and tens of thousands were
appointed to death. Lo! he, Salah-ed-din, charged at the head of
his squadrons, scimitar aloft, but she held up her hand and
stayed him.
</p><p>"What do you hear, my niece?" he asked.
</p><p>"I am come to save the lives of men through you," she answered;
"therefore was I born of your blood, and therefore I am sent to
you. Put up your sword, King, and spare them."
</p><p>"Say, maiden, what ransom do you bring to buy this multitude from
doom? What ransom, and what gift?"
</p><p>"The ransom of my own blood freely offered, and Heaven's gift of
peace to your sinful soul, O King." And with that outstretched
hand she drew down his keen-edged scimitar until it rested on her
breast.
</p><p>Salah-ed-din awoke, and marvelled on his dream, but said nothing
of it to any man. The next night it returned to him, and the
memory of it went with him all the day that followed, but still he
said nothing.
</p><p>When on the third night he dreamed it yet again, even more
vividly, then he was sure that this thing was from God, and
summoned his holy Imauns and his Diviners, and took counsel with
them. These, after they had listened, prayed and consulted,
spoke thus:
</p><p>"O Sultan, Allah has warned you in shadows that the woman, your
niece, who dwells far away in England, shall by her own
nobleness and sacrifice, in some time to come, save you from
shedding a sea of blood, and bring rest upon the land. We charge
you, therefore, draw this lady to your court, and keep her ever
by your side, since if she escape you, her peace goes with her."
</p><p>Salah-ed-din said that this interpretation was wise and true, for
thus also he had read his dream. Then he summoned a certain
false knight who bore the Cross upon his breast, but in secret
had accepted the Koran, a Frankish spy of his, who came from that
country where dwelt the maiden, his niece, and from him learned
about her, her father, and her home. With him and another spy
who passed as a Christian palmer, by the aid of Prince Hassan,
one of the greatest and most trusted of his Emirs, he made a
cunning plan for the capture of the maiden if she would not come
willingly, and for her bearing away to Syria.
</p><p>Moreover--that in the eyes of all men her dignity might be worthy
of her high blood and fate--by his decree he created her, the
niece whom he had never seen, Princess of Baalbec, with great
possessions--a rule that her grandfather, Ayoub, and her uncle,
Izzeddin, had held before her. Also he purchased a stout galley
of war, manning it with proved sailors and with chosen
men-at-arms, under the command of the Prince Hassan, and wrote a
letter to the English lord, Sir Andrew D'Arcy, and to his
daughter, and prepared a royal gift of jewels, and sent them to
the lady, his niece, far away in England, and with it the Patent
of her rank. Her he commanded this company to win by peace, or
force, or fraud, as best they might, but that without her not
one of them should dare to look upon his face again. And with
these he sent the two Frankish spies, who knew the place where
the lady lived, one of whom, the false knight, was a skilled
mariner and the captain of the ship.
</p><p>These things did Yusuf Salah-ed-din, and waited patiently till it
should please God to accomplish the vision with which God had
filled his soul in sleep.
