<p>Having run down one Apache warrior, Corporal Hugg, unmindful
of his own personal danger, leaned forward out of the ambulance
and shouted and lashed the furious horse, which was already on
a dead run.</p>

<p>"Go it, good fellow," he yelled, his voice rising above the horrid
din of cracking fire arms and whooping assailants. "Keep it up
a little longer, and we shall be clear of the whole crew."</p>

<p>They were the last words the brave soldier uttered. Ned Chadmund,
who had again crouched back in the swaying vehicle, was horrified
to see his friend pitch forward upon the foreboard, and then,
as the carriage gave one unusually violent plunge, he went out
head foremost, and vanished from sight. He had been pierced by
a dozen balls, and was dead before he reached the ground.</p>

<p>The horse, like his human assailants, was frantic, and abated
not a jot of his tremendous speed, though the reins fell slack
and dangled around his feet, and the familiar voice was heard
no more. He, too, was wounded by more than one cruel rifle ball,
but he seemed capable of undergoing far more than his comrades
that had fallen at the first fire.</p>

<p>The situation of the lad was fearful, and he was in imminent
danger from more than one form of death. He was cowering in the
bottom of the ambulance, too much terrified to speak or to attempt
to help himself in any way. Bruised and stunned by the terrific
bounds of the vehicle, he was dazed, bewildered and only dimly
conscious of the awful pandemonium reigning around him. Suddenly
he felt himself lifted in the air; then there was a crushing and
grinding, as if he was being ground to atoms between two millstones,
then another terrible crash and his senses forsook him.</p>

<p>The ambulance had overturned and smashed. It was dragged a short
distance, when the infuriated steed broke loose, tore a short
distance further down the pass and fell dead.</p>

<p>When the boy recovered his senses, his eyes opened upon a very
different scene. The sounds of strife had ceased, and the struggle
was ended, for the reason that there were no men left to resist
the victorious Apaches. It was night, and a company of something
like fifty were encamped in a gorge in the mountains. The attacking
party, which, including those who had followed the escort into
the pass, but were not in time to participate in the engagement,
numbered several hundred, and had, after the contest was over,
separated and vanished, leaving the chief, Mountain Wolf, with
half a hundred of his best warriors gathered about him. After
securing the treasure in the ambulance, and taking three horses
of the company, which had escaped harm during the massacre, the
Apaches moved on in a westerly direction through the pass for
half a mile, and turned to the left in a sort of ravine or gorge.
Several hundred yards up this the gorge widened into a valley,
wherein were a number of trees and a small stream of water. There
they went into camp. An immense fire was kindled, and as it roared
and crackled in the night, it threw out a glare that made it like
midday for many feet away.</p>

<p>Ned Chadmund had been picked up, limp and apparently lifeless,
by the chief, Mountain Wolf, and carried to this spot with as
much care and tenderness as if he were a pet child of his own.
The boy still showed a certain stupor upon reaching the camp,
but after he had lain a short time upon a buffalo robe he revived,
and, with wondering eyes, looked around upon the strange and weird
scene. The Indians were passing to and fro, as if making preparations
for some sort of festivity. There was little noise, but a great
amount of activity. Close by the fire were a half dozen warriors,
engaged in cooking several carcasses, and had the persons concerned
been civilized instead of savage, the scene would have suggested
an old-fashioned barbecue.</p>

<p>When the lad arose to a sitting position upon the buffalo hide,
he became sensible of a sharp, stinging sensation in the head,
and a sore, bruised feeling along his side, both caused by the
shock received at the overturning of the ambulance. His action
was observed by a number of the Apaches, but none approached,
nor did they pay the least attention to him; so he had every opportunity
for a careful observation of what was going on around him.</p>

<p>After recovering from the first sensation of terror and amazement,
his thoughts naturally reverted to the tragedy that had been enacted
a short time before in Devil's Pass. It was a fearful scene for
a lad like him to look upon, and he was sure it must remain vividly
impressed upon his memory so long as he lived.</p>

<p>"I'm the only one alive," he repeated to himself, with a shudder.
"Poor Corporal Hugg was the last man left, and I saw him killed.
I wonder why they spared me?"</p>

<p>He had no suspicion of the intention of the Apaches in preserving
his life, and which has already been hinted at in another place;
so it was very natural that he should feel puzzled to understand
why it was that he had been selected from such a party to escape
the hatred which these wild Jiccarillo Apaches had shown toward
the whites ever since the latter encroached upon their domains.</p>

<p>"I guess they're going to make an Indian of me," was his conclusion.
"I wonder what father will think when he hears of it? Poor mother!
I know how she was worried when she bid me good-bye. I hope she
won't hear anything till I carry her the news myself."</p>

<p>Fortunately for his peace of mind it never occurred to Ned that
he might have been spared for the purpose of torture and indignity.
There was no fear of present danger, as he sat upon the buffalo
skin, viewing the strange scene about him. Something like fifteen
minutes had passed while thus engaged, when the figure of a tall,
athletic Indian strode slowly toward him, apparently attracted
by the interest which the boy showed in the proceedings. This
warrior was fully six feet in height, magnificently formed, with
long horse-hair like shreds hanging from his crown, which, like
his face, was daubed with startling colors, giving him the appearance
of a variegated zebra of the hues of the rainbow.</p>

<p>It was Lone Wolf, one of the most famous leaders of the Jiccarilla
Apaches.</p>

<p>But the most noticeable feature about this warrior was his dress.
He was enveloped from head to foot in a sort of cloak, of a greenish
tinge, which rattled and crackled as he walked, as if made of
paper. And so it was; for, as he approached, Ned saw that his
outer garment was composed entirely of greenbacks, carefully stitched
together in such a way that they made a blanket of half a dozen
feet square. No redskin probably ever paraded so costly a blanket
as this, which included several hundred new and crisp bank notes,
varying in value from twenty to a hundred dollars each.</p>

<p>They had been united in such a careful manner that he was able
to handle it with as much ease and facility as if composed of
a single sheet of paper of the tough texture of which our national
issues are made. He seemed quite proud of his novel garment, so
unique of its kind, and strode forward with the pompous tread
of an Indian chief until he was within a few feet of where Ned
sat, when he paused a few moments to give the latter full opportunity
to admire his envelope.</p>

<p>"That must have taken a good deal of the money that belonged
to the soldiers," was his reflection, "but the country can lose
it better than it can the soldiers themselves."</p>

<p>Lone Wolf was one of the most dreaded, because he was one of
the most skillful and treacherous, of the Apache chiefs. He went
to Washington twice during his life with a delegation from his
tribe, visited the principal cities in the North, was treated
in the most hospitable manner, and professed the most unbounded
love for his white brothers. He announced his deliberate intention
of making all haste back to his tribe, and henceforth devoting
his life to peace. He would summon his brother chiefs about him,
he said then, and make known to them the goodness and love of
the whites for the red men. He would explain to them their invincible
power, and make very clear the folly of attempting to resist their
wishes in any way. Furthermore he agreed to show the numerous
gifts that had been showered upon him, and he would explain that
if they conducted themselves aright a similar future was before
them as well. All this Lone Wolf promised; but he had no sooner
got among his own people again than he chose to forget his promises
and went upon the warpath.</p>
