<p>With a long, nervous shudder, the Scarlet Car came to a stop, and the
lamps bored a round hole in the night, leaving the rest of the
encircling world in a chill and silent darkness.
</p>
<p>The lamps showed a flickering picture of a country road between high
banks covered with loose stones, and overhead, a fringe of pine boughs.
It looked like a colored photograph thrown from a stereopticon in a
darkened theater.
</p><p>From the back of the car the voice of the owner said briskly: "We will
now sing that beautiful ballad entitled 'He Is Sleeping in the Yukon
Vale To-night.'  What are you stopping for, Fred?" he asked.
</p><p>The tone of the chauffeur suggested he was again upon the defensive.
</p><p>"For water, sir," he mumbled.
</p><p>Miss Forbes in the front seat laughed, and her brother in the rear
seat, groaned in dismay.
</p><p>"Oh, for water?" said the owner cordially.  "I thought maybe it was for
coal."
</p><p>Save a dignified silence, there was no answer to this, until there came
a rolling of loose stones and the sound of a heavy body suddenly
precipitated down the bank, and landing with a thump in the road.
</p><p>"He didn't get the water," said the owner sadly.
</p><p>"Are you hurt, Fred?" asked the girl.
</p><p>The chauffeur limped in front of the lamps, appearing suddenly, like an
actor stepping into the limelight.
</p><p>"No, ma'am,"  he said.  In the rays of the lamp, he unfolded a road map
and scowled at it.  He shook his head aggrievedly.
</p><p>"There OUGHT to be a house just about here," he explained.
</p><p>"There OUGHT to be a hotel and a garage, and a cold supper, just about
here," said the girl cheerfully.
</p><p>"That's the way with those houses," complained the owner.  "They never
stay where they're put.  At night they go around and visit each other.
Where do you think you are, Fred?"
</p><p>"I think we're in that long woods, between Loon Lake and Stoughton on
the Boston Pike," said the chauffeur, "and," he reiterated, "there
OUGHT to be a house somewhere about here--where we get water."
</p><p>"Well, get there, then, and get the water," commanded the owner.
</p><p>"But I can't get there, sir, till I get the water," returned the
chauffeur.
</p><p>He shook out two collapsible buckets, and started down the shaft of
light.
</p><p>"I won't be more nor five minutes," he called.
</p><p>"I'm going with him," said the girl, "I'm cold."
</p><p>She stepped down from the front seat, and the owner with sudden
alacrity vaulted the door and started after her.
</p><p>"You coming?" he inquired of Ernest Peabody.  But Ernest Peabody being
soundly asleep made no reply.  Winthrop turned to Sam.  "Are YOU
coming?" he repeated.
</p><p>The tone of the invitation seemed to suggest that a refusal would not
necessarily lead to a quarrel.
</p><p>"I am NOT!" said the brother.  "You've kept Peabody and me twelve hours
in the open air, and it's past two, and we're going to sleep.  You can
take it from me that we are going to spend the rest of this night here
in this road."
</p><p>He moved his cramped joints cautiously, and stretched his legs the full
width of the car.
</p><p>"If you can't get plain water," he called, "get club soda."
</p><p>He buried his nose in the collar of his fur coat, and the odors of
camphor and raccoon skins instantly assailed him, but he only yawned
luxuriously and disappeared into the coat as a turtle draws into its
shell.  From the woods about him the smell of the pine needles pressed
upon him like a drug, and before the footsteps of his companions were
lost in the silence he was asleep.  But his sleep was only a review of
his waking hours.  Still on either hand rose flying dust clouds and
twirling leaves; still on either side raced gray stone walls, telegraph
poles, hills rich in autumn colors; and before him a long white road,
unending, interminable, stretching out finally into a darkness lit by
flashing shop-windows, like open fireplaces, by street lamps, by
swinging electric globes, by the blinding searchlights of hundreds of
darting trolley cars with terrifying gongs, and then a cold white mist,
and again on every side, darkness, except where the four great lamps
blazed a path through stretches of ghostly woods.
</p><p>As the two young men slumbered, the lamps spluttered and sizzled like
bacon in a frying-pan, a stone rolled noisily down the bank, a white
owl, both appalled and fascinated by the dazzling eyes of the monster
blocking the road, hooted, and flapped itself away.  But the men in the
car only shivered slightly, deep in the sleep of utter weariness.
</p><p>In silence the girl and Winthrop followed the chauffeur.  They had
passed out of the light of the lamps, and in the autumn mist the
electric torch of the owner was as ineffective as a glow-worm.  The
mystery of the forest fell heavily upon them.  From their feet the dead
leaves sent up a clean, damp odor, and on either side and overhead the
giant pine trees whispered and rustled in the night wind.
</p><p>"Take my coat, too," said the young man.  "You'll catch cold." He spoke
with authority and began to slip the loops from the big horn buttons.
It was not the habit of the girl to consider her health.  Nor did she
permit the members of her family to show solicitude concerning it.  But
the anxiety of the young man, did not seem to offend her.  She thanked
him generously.  "No; these coats are hard to walk in, and I want to
walk," she exclaimed.
</p><p>"I like to hear the leaves rustle when you kick them, don't you?  When
I was so high, I used to pretend it was wading in the surf."
</p><p>The young man moved over to the gutter of the road where the leaves
were deepest and kicked violently.  "And the more noise you make," he
said, "the more you frighten away the wild animals."
</p><p>The girl shuddered in a most helpless and fascinating fashion.
</p><p>"Don't!" she whispered.  "I didn't mention it, but already I have seen
several lions crouching behind the trees."
</p><p>"Indeed?" said the young man.  His tone was preoccupied.  He had just
kicked a rock, hidden by the leaves, and was standing on one leg.
</p><p>"Do you mean you don't believe me?" asked the girl, "or is it that you
are merely brave?"
</p><p>"Merely brave!" exclaimed the young man. "Massachusetts is so far north
for lions," he continued, "that I fancy what you saw was a grizzly
bear.  But I have my trusty electric torch with me, and if there is
anything a bear cannot abide, it is to be pointed at by an electric
torch."
</p><p>"Let us pretend," cried the girl, "that we are the babes in the wood,
and that we are lost."
</p><p>"We don't have to pretend we're lost," said the man, "and as I remember
it, the babes came to a sad end.  Didn't they die, and didn't the birds
bury them with leaves?"
</p><p>"Sam and Mr. Peabody can be the birds," suggested the girl.
</p><p>"Sam and Peabody hopping around with leaves in their teeth would look
silly," objected the man, "I doubt if I could keep from laughing."
</p><p>"Then," said the girl, "they can be the wicked robbers who came to kill
the babes."
</p><p>"Very well," said the man with suspicious alacrity, "let us be babes.
If I have to die," he went on heartily, "I would rather die with you
than live with any one else."
</p><p>When he had spoken, although they were entirely alone in the world and
quite near to each other, it was as though the girl could not hear him,
even as though he had not spoken at all.  After a silence, the girl
said:  "Perhaps it would be better for us to go back to the car."
</p><p>"I won't do it again," begged the man.
</p><p>"We will pretend," cried the girl, "that the car is a van and that we
are gypsies, and we'll build a campfire, and I will tell your fortune."
</p><p>"You are the only woman who can," muttered the young man.
</p><p>The girl still stood in her tracks.
</p><p>"You said--" she began.
</p><p>"I know," interrupted the man, "but you won't let me talk seriously, so
I joke.  But some day----"
</p><p>"Oh, look!" cried the girl.  "There's Fred."
</p><p>She ran from him down the road.  The young man followed her slowly, his
fists deep in the pockets of the great-coat, and kicking at the
unoffending leaves.
</p><p>The chauffeur was peering through a double iron gate hung between
square brick posts.  The lower hinge of one gate was broken, and that
gate lurched forward leaving an opening.  By the light of the electric
torch they could see the beginning of a driveway, rough and weed-grown,
lined with trees of great age and bulk, and an unkempt lawn, strewn
with bushes, and beyond, in an open place bare of trees and illuminated
faintly by the stars, the shadow of a house, black, silent, and
forbidding.
</p><p>"That's it," whispered the chauffeur.  "I was here before.  The well is
over there."
</p><p>The young man gave a gasp of astonishment.
</p><p>"Why," he protested, "this is the Carey place!  I should say we WERE
lost.  We must have left the road an hour ago.  There's not another
house within miles."  But he made no movement to enter.  "Of all
places!" he muttered.
</p><p>"Well, then," urged the girl briskly, "if there's no other house, let's
tap Mr. Carey's well and get on."
</p><p>"Do you know who he is?" asked the man.
</p><p>The girl laughed.  "You don't need a letter of introduction to take a
bucket of water, do you?" she said.
</p><p>"It's Philip Carey's house.  He lives here."  He spoke in a whisper,
and insistently, as though the information must carry some special
significance.  But the girl showed no sign of enlightenment.  "You
remember the Carey boys?" he urged.  "They left Harvard the year I
entered.  They HAD to leave.  They were quite mad.  All the Careys have
been mad.  The boys were queer even then, and awfully rich.  Henry ran
away with a girl from a shoe factory in Brockton and lives in Paris,
and Philip was sent here."
</p><p>"Sent here?" repeated the girl.  Unconsciously her voice also had sunk
to a whisper.
</p><p>"He has a doctor and a nurse and keepers, and they live here all the
year round.  When Fred said there were people hereabouts, I thought we
might strike them for something to eat, or even to put us up for the
night, but, Philip Carey!  I shouldn't fancy----"
</p><p>"I should think not!" exclaimed the girl.
</p><p>For, a minute the three stood silent, peering through the iron bars.
</p><p>"And the worst of it is," went on the young man irritably, "he could
give us such good things to eat."
</p><p>"It doesn't look it," said the girl.
</p><p>"I know," continued the man in the same eager whisper.  "But--who was
it was telling me?  Some doctor I know who came down to see him.  He
said Carey does himself awfully well, has the house full of bully
pictures, and the family plate, and wonderful collections--things he
picked up in the East--gold ornaments, and jewels, and jade."
</p><p>"I shouldn't think,"  said the girl in the same hushed voice, "they
would let him live so far from any neighbors with such things in the
house.  Suppose burglars----"
</p><p>"Burglars!  Burglars would never hear of this place.  How could
they?--Even his friends think it's just a private madhouse."
</p><p>The girl shivered and drew back from the gate.
</p><p>Fred coughed apologetically.
</p><p>"I'VE heard of it," he volunteered.  "There was a piece in the Sunday
Post.  It said he eats his dinner in a diamond crown, and all the walls
is gold, and two monkeys wait on table with gold----"
</p><p>"Nonsense!" said the man sharply.  "He eats like any one else and
dresses like any one else.  How far is the well from the house?"
</p><p>"It's purty near," said the chauffeur.
</p><p>"Pretty near the house, or pretty near here?"
</p><p>"Just outside the kitchen; and it makes a creaky noise."
</p><p>"You mean you don't want to go?"
</p><p>Fred's answer was unintelligible.
</p><p>"You wait here with Miss Forbes," said the young man.  "And I'll get
the water."
</p><p>"Yes, sir!" said Fred, quite distinctly.
</p><p>"No, sir!" said Miss Forbes, with equal distinctness.  "I'm not going
to be left here alone--with all these trees.  I'm going with you."
</p><p>"There may be a dog," suggested the young man, "or, I was thinking if
they heard me prowling about, they might take a shot--just for luck.
Why don't you go back to the car with Fred?"
</p><p>"Down that long road in the dark?" exclaimed the girl.  "Do you think I
have no imagination?"
</p><p>The man in front, the girl close on his heels, and the boy with the
buckets following, crawled through the broken gate, and moved
cautiously up the gravel driveway.
</p><p>Within fifty feet of the house the courage of the chauffeur returned.
</p><p>"You wait here," he whispered, "and if I wake 'em up, you shout to 'em
that it's all right, that it's only me."
</p><p>"Your idea being," said the young man, "that they will then fire at me.
Clever lad.  Run along."
</p><p>There was a rustling of the dead weeds, and instantly the chauffeur was
swallowed in the encompassing shadows.
</p><p>Miss Forbes leaned toward the young man.
</p><p>"Do you see a light in that lower story?" she whispered.
</p><p>"No," said the man.  "Where?"
</p><p>After a pause the girl answered:  "I can't see it now, either.  Maybe I
didn't see it.  It was very faint--just a glow--it might have been
phosphorescence."
</p><p>"It might," said the man.  He gave a shrug of distaste.  "The whole
place is certainly old enough and decayed enough."
</p><p>For a brief space they stood quite still, and at once, accentuated by
their own silence, the noises of the night grew in number and
distinctness.  A slight wind had risen and the boughs of the pines
rocked restlessly, making mournful complaint; and at their feet the
needles dropping in a gentle desultory shower had the sound of rain in
springtime.  From every side they were startled by noises they could
not place.  Strange movements and rustlings caused them to peer sharply
into the shadows; footsteps, that seemed to approach, and, then, having
marked them, skulk away; branches of bushes that suddenly swept
together, as though closing behind some one in stealthy retreat.
Although they knew that in the deserted garden they were alone, they
felt that from the shadows they were being spied upon, that the
darkness of the place was peopled by malign presences.
</p><p>The young man drew a cigar from his case and put it unlit between his
teeth.
</p><p>"Cheerful, isn't it?" he growled.  "These dead leaves make it damp as a
tomb.  If I've seen one ghost, I've seen a dozen.  I believe we're
standing in the Carey family's graveyard."
</p><p>"I thought you were brave," said the girl.
</p><p>"I am," returned the young man, "very brave.  But if you had the most
wonderful girl on earth to take care of in the grounds of a madhouse at
two in the morning, you'd be scared too."
</p><p>He was abruptly surprised by Miss Forbes laying her hand firmly upon
his shoulder, and turning him in the direction of the house.  Her face
was so near his that he felt the uneven fluttering of her breath upon
his cheek.
</p><p>"There is a man," she said, "standing behind that tree."
</p><p>By the faint light of the stars he saw, in black silhouette, a shoulder
and head projecting from beyond the trunk of a huge oak, and then
quickly withdrawn.  The owner of the head and shoulder was on the side
of the tree nearest to themselves, his back turned to them, and so
deeply was his attention engaged that he was unconscious of their
presence.
</p><p>"He is watching the house," said the girl.  "Why is he doing that?"
</p><p>"I think it's Fred," whispered the man.  "He's afraid to go for the
water.  That's as far as he's gone."  He was about to move forward when
from the oak tree there came a low whistle.  The girl and the man stood
silent and motionless.  But they knew it was useless; that they had
been overheard.  A voice spoke cautiously.
</p><p>"That you?" it asked.
</p><p>With the idea only of gaining time, the young man responded promptly
and truthfully.  "Yes," he whispered.
</p><p>"Keep to the right of the house," commanded the voice.
</p><p>The young man seized Miss Forbes by the wrist and moving to the right
drew her quickly with him.  He did not stop until they had turned the
corner of the building, and were once more hidden by the darkness.
</p><p>"The plot thickens," he said.  "I take it that that fellow is a keeper,
or watchman.  He spoke as though it were natural there should be
another man in the grounds, so there's probably two of them, either to
keep Carey in, or to keep trespassers out.  Now, I think I'll go back
and tell him that Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of
water, and that all they want is to be allowed to get the water, and
go."
</p><p>"Why should a watchman hide behind a tree?" asked the girl.  "And
why----"
</p><p>She ceased abruptly with a sharp cry of fright.  "What's that?" she
whispered.
</p><p>"What's what?" asked the young man startled.  "What did you hear?"
</p><p>"Over there," stammered the girl.  "Something--that--groaned."
</p><p>"Pretty soon this will get on my nerves," said the man.  He ripped open
his greatcoat and reached under it.  "I've been stoned twice, when
there were women in the car," he said, apologetically, "and so now at
night I carry a gun."  He shifted the darkened torch to his left hand,
and, moving a few yards, halted to listen.  The girl, reluctant to be
left alone, followed slowly.  As he stood immovable there came from the
leaves just beyond him the sound of a feeble struggle, and a strangled
groan.  The man bent forward and flashed the torch.  He saw stretched
rigid on the ground a huge wolf-hound.  Its legs were twisted horribly,
the lips drawn away from the teeth, the eyes glazed in an agony of
pain.  The man snapped off the light.  "Keep back!" he whispered to the
girl.  He took her by the arm and ran with her toward the gate.
</p><p>"Who was it?" she begged.
</p><p>"It was a dog," he answered.  "I think----"
</p><p>He did not tell her what he thought.
</p><p>"I've got to find out what the devil has happened to Fred!" he said.
"You go back to the car.  Send your brother here on the run.  Tell him
there's going to be a rough-house.  You're not afraid to go?"
</p><p>"No," said the girl.
</p><p>A shadow blacker than the night rose suddenly before them, and a voice
asked sternly but quietly:  "What are you doing here?"
</p><p>The young man lifted his arm clear of the girl, and shoved her quickly
from him.  In his hand she felt the pressure of the revolver.
</p><p>"Well," he replied truculently, "and what are you doing here?"
</p><p>"I am the night watchman," answered the voice.  "Who are you?"
</p><p>It struck Miss Forbes if the watchman knew that one of the trespassers
was a woman he would be at once reassured, and she broke in quickly:
</p><p>"We have lost our way," she said pleasantly.  "We came here----"
</p><p>She found herself staring blindly down a shaft of light.  For an
instant the torch held her, and then from her swept over the young man.
</p><p>"Drop that gun!" cried the voice.  It was no longer the same voice; it
was now savage and snarling.  For answer the young man pressed the
torch in his left hand, and, held in the two circles of light, the men
surveyed each other.  The newcomer was one of unusual bulk and height.
The collar of his overcoat hid his mouth, and his derby hat was drawn
down over his forehead, but what they saw showed an intelligent, strong
face, although for the moment it wore a menacing scowl.  The young man
dropped his revolver into his pocket.
</p><p>"My automobile ran dry," he said; "we came in here to get some water.
My chauffeur is back there somewhere with a couple of buckets.  This is
Mr. Carey's place, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Take that light out of my eyes!" said the watchman.
</p><p>"Take your light out of my eyes," returned the young man.  "You can see
we're not--we don't mean any harm."
</p><p>The two lights disappeared simultaneously, and then each, as though
worked by the same hand, sprang forth again.
</p><p>"What did you think I was going to do?" the young man asked.  He
laughed and switched off his torch.
</p><p>But the one the watchman held in his hand still moved from the face of
the girl to that of the young man.
</p><p>"How'd you know this was the Carey house?" he demanded.  "Do you know
Mr. Carey?"
</p><p>"No, but I know this is his house."  For a moment from behind his mask
of light the watchman surveyed them in silence.  Then he spoke quickly:
</p><p>"I'll take you to him," he said, "if he thinks it's all right, it's all
right."
</p><p>The girl gave a protesting cry.  The young man burst forth indignantly:
</p><p>"You will NOT!" he cried.  "Don't be an idiot!  You talk like a
Tenderloin cop.  Do we look like second-story workers?"
</p><p>"I found you prowling around Mr. Carey's grounds at two in the
morning," said the watchman sharply, "with a gun in your hand.  My job
is to protect this place, and I am going to take you both to Mr. Carey."
</p><p>Until this moment the young man could see nothing save the shaft of
light and the tiny glowing bulb at its base; now into the light there
protruded a black revolver.
</p><p>"Keep your hands up, and walk ahead of me to the house," commanded the
watchman.  "The woman will go in front."
</p><p>The young man did not move.  Under his breath he muttered impotently,
and bit at his lower lip.
</p><p>"See here," he said, "I'll go with you, but you shan't take this lady
in front of that madman.  Let her go to her car.  It's only a hundred
yards from here; you know perfectly well she----"
</p><p>"I know where your car is, all right," said the watchman steadily, "and
I'm not going to let you get away in it till Mr. Carey's seen you."
The revolver motioned forward.  Miss Forbes stepped in front of it and
appealed eagerly to the young man.
</p><p>"Do what he says," she urged.  "It's only his duty.  Please!  Indeed, I
don't mind."  She turned to the watchman.  "Which way do you want us to
go?" she asked.
</p><p>"Keep in the light," he ordered.
</p><p>The light showed the broad steps leading to the front entrance of the
house, and in its shaft they climbed them, pushed open the unlocked
door, and stood in a small hallway.  It led into a greater hall beyond.
By the electric lights still burning they noted that the interior of
the house was as rich and well cared for as the outside was miserable.
With a gesture for silence the watchman motioned them into a small room
on the right of the hallway.  It had the look of an office, and was
apparently the place in which were conducted the affairs of the estate.
</p><p>In an open grate was a dying fire; in front of it a flat desk covered
with papers and japanned tin boxes.
</p><p>"You stay here till I fetch Mr. Carey, and the servants," commanded the
watchman.  "Don't try to get out, and," he added menacingly, "don't
make no noise."  With his revolver he pointed at the two windows.  They
were heavily barred.  "Those bars keep Mr. Carey in," he said, "and I
guess they can keep you in, too.  The other watchman," he added, "will
be just outside this door."  But still he hesitated, glowering with
suspicion; unwilling to trust them alone.  His face lit with an ugly
smile.
</p><p>"Mr. Carey's very bad to-night," he said; "he won't keep his bed and
he's wandering about the house.  If he found you by yourselves, he
might----"
</p><p>The young man, who had been staring at the fire, swung sharply on his
heel.
</p><p>"Get-to-hell-out-of-here!" he said.  The watchman stepped into the hall
and was cautiously closing the door when a man sprang lightly up the
front steps.  Through the inch crack left by the open door the
trespassers heard the newcomers eager greeting.
</p><p>"I can't get him right!"  he panted.  "He's snoring like a hog."
</p><p>The watchman exclaimed savagely:
</p><p>"He's fooling you."  He gasped.  "I didn't mor' nor slap him.  Did you
throw water on him?"
</p><p>"I drowned him!" returned the other.  "He never winked.  I tell You we
gotta walk, and damn quick!"
</p><p>"Walk!"  The watchman cursed him foully.  "How far could we walk?  I'LL
bring him to," he swore.  "He's scared of us, and he's shamming."  He
gave a sudden start of alarm.  "That's it, he's shamming.  You fool!
You shouldn't have left him."
</p><p>There was the swift patter of retreating footsteps, and then a sudden
halt, and they heard the watchman command:  "Go back, and keep the
other two till I come."
</p><p>The next instant from the outside the door was softly closed upon them.
</p><p>It had no more than shut when to the surprise of Miss Forbes the young
man, with a delighted and vindictive chuckle, sprang to the desk and
began to drum upon it with his fingers.  It were as though he were
practising upon a typewriter.
</p><p>"He missed THESE," he muttered jubilantly.  The girl leaned forward.
Beneath his fingers she saw, flush with the table, a roll of little
ivory buttons.  She read the words "Stables," "Servants' hall."  She
raised a pair of very beautiful and very bewildered eyes.
</p><p>"But if he wanted the servants, why didn't the watchman do that?" she
asked.
</p><p>"Because he isn't a watchman," answered the young man.  "Because he's
robbing this house."
</p><p>He took the revolver from his encumbering greatcoat, slipped it in his
pocket, and threw the coat from him.  He motioned the girl into a
corner.  "Keep out of the line of the door," he ordered.
</p><p>"I don't understand," begged the girl.
</p><p>"They came in a car," whispered the young man.  "It's broken down, and
they can't get away.  When the big fellow stopped us and I flashed my
torch, I saw their car behind him in the road with the front off and
the lights out.  He'd seen the lamps of our car, and now they want it
to escape in.  That's why he brought us here--to keep us away from our
car."
</p><p>"And Fred!" gasped the girl.  "Fred's hurt!"
</p><p>"I guess Fred stumbled into the big fellow," assented the young man,
"and the big fellow put him out; then he saw Fred was a chauffeur, and
now they are trying to bring him to, so that he can run the car for
them.  You needn't worry about Fred.  He's been in four smash-ups."
</p><p>The young man bent forward to listen, but from no part of the great
house came any sign.  He exclaimed angrily.
</p><p>"They must be drugged," he growled.  He ran to the desk and made
vicious jabs at the ivory buttons.
</p><p>"Suppose they're out of order!" he whispered.
</p><p>There was the sound of leaping feet.  The young man laughed nervously.
</p><p>"No, it's all right," he cried.  "They're coming!"
</p><p>The door flung open and the big burglar and a small, rat-like figure of
a man burst upon them; the big one pointing a revolver.
</p><p>"Come with me to your car!" he commanded.  "You've got to take us to
Boston.  Quick, or I'll blow your face off."
</p><p>Although the young man glared bravely at the steel barrel and the
lifted trigger, poised a few inches from his eyes, his body, as though
weak with fright, shifted slightly and his feet made a shuffling noise
upon the floor.  When the weight of his body was balanced on the ball
of his right foot, the shuffling ceased.  Had the burglar lowered his
eyes, the manoeuvre to him would have been significant, but his eyes
were following the barrel of the revolver.
</p><p>In the mind of the young man the one thought uppermost was that he must
gain time, but, with a revolver in his face, he found his desire to
gain time swiftly diminishing.  Still, when he spoke, it was with
deliberation.
</p><p>"My chauffeur--" he began slowly.
</p><p>The burglar snapped at him like a dog.  "To hell with your chauffeur!"
he cried.  "Your chauffeur has run away.  You'll drive that car
yourself, or I'll leave you here with the top of your head off."
</p><p>The face of the young man suddenly flashed with pleasure.  His eyes,
looking past the burglar to the door, lit with relief.
</p><p>"There's the chauffeur now!"  he cried.
</p><p>The big burglar for one instant glanced over his right shoulder.
</p><p>For months at a time, on Soldiers Field, the young man had thrown
himself at human targets, that ran and dodged and evaded him, and the
hulking burglar, motionless before him, was easily his victim.
</p><p>He leaped at him, his left arm swinging like a scythe, and, with the
impact of a club, the blow caught the burglar in the throat.
</p><p>The pistol went off impotently; the burglar with a choking cough sank
in a heap on the floor.
</p><p>The young man tramped over him and upon him, and beat the second
burglar with savage, whirlwind blows.  The second burglar, shrieking
with pain, turned to fly, and a fist, that fell upon him where his bump
of honesty should have been, drove his head against the lintel of the
door.
</p><p>At the same instant from the belfry on the roof there rang out on the
night the sudden tumult of a bell; a bell that told as plainly as
though it clamored with a human tongue, that the hand that rang it was
driven with fear; fear of fire, fear of thieves, fear of a mad-man with
a knife in his hand running amuck; perhaps at that moment creeping up
the belfry stairs.
</p><p>From all over the house there was the rush of feet and men's voices,
and from the garden the light of dancing lanterns.  And while the smoke
of the revolver still hung motionless, the open door was crowded with
half-clad figures.  At their head were two young men.  One who had
drawn over his night clothes a serge suit, and who, in even that garb,
carried an air of authority; and one, tall, stooping, weak of face and
light-haired, with eyes that blinked and trembled behind great
spectacles and who, for comfort, hugged about him a gorgeous kimono.
For an instant the newcomers stared stupidly through the smoke at the
bodies on the floor breathing stertorously, at the young man with the
lust of battle still in his face, at the girl shrinking against the
wall.  It was the young man in the serge suit who was the first to move.
</p><p>"Who are you?" he demanded.
</p><p>"These are burglars," said the owner of the car.  "We happened to be
passing in my automobile, and----"
</p><p>The young man was no longer listening.  With an alert, professional
manner he had stooped over the big burglar.  With his thumb he pushed
back the man's eyelids, and ran his fingers over his throat and chin.
He felt carefully of the point of the chin, and glanced up.
</p><p>"You've broken the bone," he said.
</p><p>"I just swung on him," said the young man.  He turned his eyes, and
suggested the presence of the girl.
</p><p>At the same moment the man in the kimono cried nervously: "Ladies
present, ladies present.  Go put your clothes on, everybody; put your
clothes on."
</p><p>For orders the men in the doorway looked to the young man with the
stern face.
</p><p>He scowled at the figure in the kimono.
</p><p>"You will please go to your room, sir," he said.  He stood up, and
bowed to Miss Forbes.  "I beg your pardon," he asked, "you must want to
get out of this.  Will you please go into the library?"
</p><p>He turned to the robust youths in the door, and pointed at the second
burglar.
</p><p>"Move him out of the way," he ordered.
</p><p>The man in the kimono smirked and bowed.
</p><p>"Allow me," he said; "allow me to show you to the library.  This is no
place for ladies."
</p><p>The young man with the stern face frowned impatiently.
</p><p>"You will please return to your room, sir," he repeated.
</p><p>With an attempt at dignity the figure in the kimono gathered the silk
robe closer about him.
</p><p>"Certainly," he said.  "If you think you can get on without me--I will
retire," and lifting his bare feet mincingly, he tiptoed away.  Miss
Forbes looked after him with an expression of relief, of repulsion, of
great pity.
</p><p>The owner of the car glanced at the young man with the stern face, and
raised his eyebrows interrogatively.
</p><p>The young man had taken the revolver from the limp fingers of the
burglar and was holding it in his hand.  Winthrop gave what was half a
laugh and half a sigh of compassion.
</p><p>"So, that's Carey?" he said.
</p><p>There was a sudden silence.  The young man with the stern face made no
answer.  His head was bent over the revolver.  He broke it open, and
spilled the cartridges into his palm.  Still he made no answer.  When
he raised his head, his eyes were no longer stern, but wistful, and
filled with an inexpressible loneliness.
</p><p>"No, _I_ am Carey," he said.
</p><p>The one who had blundered stood helpless, tongue-tied, with no presence
of mind beyond knowing that to explain would offend further.
</p><p>The other seemed to feel for him more than for himself.  In a voice low
and peculiarly appealing, he continued hurriedly.
</p><p>"He is my doctor," he said.  "He is a young man, and he has not had
many advantages--his manner is not--I find we do not get on together.
I have asked them to send me some one else." He stopped suddenly, and
stood unhappily silent.  The knowledge that the strangers were
acquainted with his story seemed to rob him of his earlier confidence.
He made an uncertain movement as though to relieve them of his presence.
</p><p>Miss Forbes stepped toward him eagerly.
</p><p>"You told me I might wait in the library," she said.  "Will you take me
there?"
</p><p>For a moment the man did not move, but stood looking at the young and
beautiful girl, who, with a smile, hid the compassion in her eyes.
</p>
<p>"Will you go?" he asked wistfully.
</p><p>"Why not?" said the girl.
</p><p>The young man laughed with pleasure.
</p><p>"I am unpardonable," he said.  "I live so much alone--that I forget."
Like one who, issuing from a close room, encounters the morning air, he
drew a deep, happy breath.  "It has been three years since a woman has
been in this house," he said simply.  "And I have not even thanked
you," he went on, "nor asked you if you are cold," he cried
remorsefully, "or hungry.  How nice it would be if you would say you
are hungry."
</p><p>The girl walked beside him, laughing lightly, and, as they disappeared
into the greater hall beyond, Winthrop heard her cry:  "You never
robbed your own ice-chest?  How have you kept from starving?  Show me
it, and we'll rob it together."
</p><p>The voice of their host rang through the empty house with a laugh like
that of an eager, happy child.
</p><p>"Heavens!" said the owner of the car, "isn't she wonderful!" But
neither the prostrate burglars, nor the servants, intent on strapping
their wrists together, gave him any answer.
</p><p>As they were finishing the supper filched from the ice-chest, Fred was
brought before them from the kitchen.  The blow the burglar had given
him was covered with a piece of cold beef-steak, and the water thrown
on him to revive him was thawing from his leather breeches.  Mr. Carey
expressed his gratitude, and rewarded him beyond the avaricious dreams
even of a chauffeur.
</p><p>As the three trespassers left the house, accompanied by many pails of
water, the girl turned to the lonely figure in the doorway and waved
her hand.
</p><p>"May we come again?" she called.
</p><p>But young Mr. Carey did not trust his voice to answer.  Standing erect,
with folded arms, in dark silhouette in the light of the hall, he bowed
his head.
</p><p>Deaf to alarm bells, to pistol shots, to cries for help, they found her
brother and Ernest Peabody sleeping soundly.
</p><p>"Sam is a charming chaperon," said the owner of the car.
</p><p>With the girl beside him, with Fred crouched, shivering, on the step,
he threw in the clutch; the servants from the house waved the emptied
buckets in salute, and the great car sprang forward into the awakening
day toward the golden dome over the Boston Common.  In the rear seat
Peabody shivered and yawned, and then sat erect.
</p><p>"Did you get the water?" he demanded, anxiously.
</p><p>There was a grim silence.
</p><p>"Yes," said the owner of the car patiently.  "You needn't worry any
longer.  We got the water."
