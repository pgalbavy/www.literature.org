<p>"Now you've got him, Ned!"</p>

<p>"Sh! keep quiet!"</p>

<p>The boy who was addressed as Ned was kneeling behind a fallen
oak, in a Kentucky forest, carefully sighting at a noble buck
that stood in the middle of a natural clearing or opening, with
head upraised and antlers thrown back, as though he scented danger,
and was searching for the point whence it threatened.</p>

<p>The splendid animal was no more than a hundred yards distant,
so that no better target could have been offered. He was facing
the youth, who aimed at the point above his fore legs, which opened
the path to the heart of the creature.</p>

<p>The lad, who was sighting so carefully, was Ned Preston, and
his companion was a colored boy with the unique name of Wildblossom
Brown. There was not a week's difference in their ages, each having
been born four years before the immortal Declaration of Independence.
As the date on which we introduce him to the reader was the autumn
of 1788, the years of the two may be calculated without trouble.</p>

<p>Ned Preston, as he drew bead on the deer, was as certain of bringing
him down as he was of "barking" the gray squirrel, when it chirped
its mimic defiance from the topmost limbs of the gnarled oak or
branching sycamore.</p>

<p>Wildblossom, or "Blossom," as he was invariably called, was anxious
that his young master should not miss, for the chilly autumn day
was drawing to a close, and they had eaten nothing since morning.
They were eager to reach the block-house, known as Fort Bridgman,
and scarcely allowed themselves any halt for many hours; but night
was closing in, and they must soon go into camp; food was therefore
as indispensable as fire.</p>

<p>The deliberation of Ned Preston led Blossom to fear the game
would bound away before the trigger was pulled. When, therefore,
the African saw the long brown barrel pointed for several seconds
at the animal, he became impatient, and uttered the words given
above.</p>

<p>The next moment there was a flash, and the buck made a prodigious
bound, dashed straight toward the fallen tree behind which the
boys were crouching, and fell within fifty feet of them.</p>

<p>"Dar's our supper suah's yo' born!" shouted the delighted negro,
making a strong effort to leap over the prostrate oak so as to
reach the game ahead of his companion. He would have succeeded
if the oak had lain somewhat nearer the ground. As it was, he
landed on his head and shoulders, and rolled over; but he was
unharmed, and scrambling to his feet, ran to the deer.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was but a brief distance behind him, trailing his
long rifle, walking rapidly, and very much puzzled over what was
certainly an extraordinary occurrence; for although he had aimed
at the buck, pulled the trigger, and the game had fallen, yet
the astonishing fact remained, that Ned had not fired his gun.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown in his excitement did not notice that there was
no report of the weapon&mdash;that, in short, the flint-lock (percussion
guns being unknown at that day) had "flashed in the pan." When
he saw the frantic leap and fall of the animal, he supposed, as
a matter of course, it had been killed by the bullet of his young
master; and if the latter had not stopped to examine his piece,
he might have believed the same, so exactly did the wounding of
the game accord with the useless click of the lock and flash of
the powder.</p>

<p>"I didn't shoot that buck," called out Ned, as he ran up behind
Blossom; "my gun wasn't fired at all."</p>

<p>"Dat hasn't got nuffin to do with it," was the sturdy response
of Blossom, who was bent on having his meal without any unnecessary
delay; "you p'inted de gun at him, and he drapped; dat's sufficacious."</p>

<p>"But <em>I</em> didn't kill him," insisted Ned, more determined
on solving the mystery than he was on procuring supper.</p>

<p>"I tell you dat you did&mdash;no, you didn't!"</p>

<p>At that instant Blossom, who had drawn his hunting-knife, stooped
over to apply it to the throat of the buck, when he gave an unexpected
flirt of his head, bringing his antlers against the boy with such
violence that he was thrown backward several feet. When Blossom
found himself going, he made his last remark, inasmuch as the
deer just then proved he was alive in a most emphatic manner.</p>

<p>But it was the last expiring effort, and the negro approached
him again, knowing that all danger was past.</p>

<p>"De way ob it was dis way," he added, turning partly around so
as to face his friend, who was examining his rifle as he poured
powder from his horn into the pan; "you p'inted dat gun ob yours
at de buck, and as he war lookin' dis way he seed you frough de
bushes, and he knowed it war no use; so he jes' made a jump into
de air, and come down pretty near dead, so as to sabe you de expense
ob firin' off de powder, which aint very plenty in Kentucky."</p>

<p>This explanation seemed to satisfy the one who made it, but not
his listener, who knew that the game was brought to earth by some
one else.</p>

<p>And yet he was sure he had not heard the report of any other
gun at the moment the animal seemed to have received its death-wound,
so that it would seem some other cause must have ended its career.</p>

<p>While Blossom was working with his knife, Ned caught sight of
something which gave him a suspicion of the true cause. The game
lay on its side, and that which arrested the eye of the youthful
pioneer was the feather of an Indian arrow.</p>

<p>"Turn him over," said Ned; and the lad, wondering why he told
him to do so, complied.</p>

<p>The truth was then made known. From the side of the buck protruded
a few inches of the shaft of an Indian arrow, to which the eagle's
feather was attached. The flinty head had been driven clean through
the heart and some distance beyond, so that the sharp point must
have been near the surface on the other side.</p>

<p>The deer scarcely ever is known to fall instantly, no matter
how it is shot; so that, with such a formidable weapon dividing
the very seat of life, it still ran several rods before falling.</p>

<p>When Blossom saw the arrow his appetite vanished. He stooped
over, staring at it a moment, and then suddenly straightened up
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Let's run; dis aint any place for fellers like us!"</p>

<p>And, without waiting for the advice of his young master, the
negro lad caught up his gun and made a dash for the prostrate
tree from which he had rushed when the buck first fell.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was frightened beyond expression, for that which
he had discovered was proof positive that one red man at least
was close at hand; and when the American Indian was encountered
in the Kentucky or Ohio forest, in the year of our Lord 1788,
it was wise to consider him the most dangerous kind of an enemy.</p>

<p>Ned had poured the powder in his priming-pan and shaken it into
the tube before he caught sight of the arrow, for he had been
instructed, from the first day he carried a gun, that, after discharging
the piece, he must not stir from his steps until it was reloaded
and ready for use again.</p>

<p>The moment he understood what killed the buck he looked around
for the Indian who did it. He could easily tell the direction
whence the missile came, from the position of the game when struck;
but the penetrating eye of the lad could detect nothing when he
turned his gaze toward that, nor indeed toward any other point.</p>

<p>This did not surprise him, for the nature of the Indian leads
him to be secretive in all he does; and many a time has his most
destructive work been done without the sufferer catching a glimpse
of him.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Ned was that a party of warriors were in the
immediate neighborhood, and that, as an inevitable certainty,
he and Blossom were at their mercy. If they chose to send in a
shower of arrows, or fire the guns which some of them were likely
to own, nothing could save the two lads.</p>

<p>If they chose to rush forward and take the boys captives, it
was beyond the power of the youths to escape; in fact, as Ned
looked at it, the two were already as good as prisoners, and the
Indians were only keeping in the background for a brief while,
for the sake of amusing themselves, as a cat sometimes plays with
a mouse before crunching it in her jaws.</p>

<p>The situation was an alarming one in every sense, but Ned Preston
showed a courage that his life on the frontier had taught him
was the only wise course in such a trying time. He stooped over
the carcase of the deer, and carefully cutting a choice slice
from it, turned about and walked deliberately back to where Blossom
was awaiting him, behind the oak.</p>

<p>Ned's desire to break into a run and plunge off into the woods
was almost uncontrollable, and the sensation of expecting every
minute an Indian arrow driven into his back, while resolutely
keeping down to a slow and dignified walk, was beyond description.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown, who had started away in such haste, so dreaded
some such shot that he threw himself behind the tree, where he
lay still. He was strongly led to this course by his affection
for his young master, whom he could not desert even for his own
benefit.</p>

<p>"Whar am de Injines?" asked Blossom, in a husky whisper, as his
friend walked around the root of the oak and joined him.</p>

<p>"They can't be far off," was the answer of Ned, "and there isn't
any use of trying to run away from them. There must be a war party,
and when they are ready they will come and take us. So let's kindle
a fire and cook the meat."</p>

<p>This was an amazing proposition to make, but it was acted upon
at once, extraordinary as it may seem. Blossom was very nervous
while gathering wood and giving what assistance he could. He continually
glanced around him, and peeped furtively over the trunk, wondering
why the red men did not come forward and take them prisoners.</p>

<p>The youths were so accustomed to camping out that it was an easy
matter to prepare their evening meal. They would have preferred
the venison not quite so fresh, but they were glad enough to get
it as it was; and when they sprinkled some of the salt and pepper,
always carried with them, on the crisp, juicy steak, it was as
toothsome and luscious as a couple of hungry hunters could wish.</p>

<p>True, the circumstances under which the meal was eaten were not
conducive to enjoyment, for no person can be expected to feel
unrestrained happiness when surrounded by a party of treacherous
red men, who are likely to send in a shower of arrows, or a volley
of bullets, just as you are raising a piece of meat to your mouth.</p>

<p>And yet, despite all that, Ned Preston and Blossom Brown masticated
and swallowed the last morsel of the liberal piece taken from
the buck slain by the Indian arrow.</p>

<p>The bleak, blustery autumn day was drawing to a close, when the
boys arose to their feet, uncertain what was the best to do in
the extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>The sky had been overcast during the afternoon, though there
were no indications of an immediate storm. The wind blew strongly
at times, with a dull, moaning sound, through the trees, from
which the leaves rustled downward in showers. Now and then a few
flakes of snow drifted on the air for some minutes before fluttering
to the ground. Everything betokened the coming of winter, and,
though it was the royal season for game, yet there was something
so impressive in the autumn forest, now that the seasons were
sinking into decay and death, that Ned Preston, sturdy and practical
though he was, could not avoid a feeling of sadness when he set
out from his home for the Block House, thirty miles away.</p>

<p>"Ned, what am de use ob loafin' round here?" asked Blossom a
minute after they rose from their supper. "If dem Injines don't
want to come forrard and speak to us, what's de use ob waiting
for 'em?"</p>

<p>There was some wisdom in this question, and it was one that had
presented itself to Ned while thoughtfully eating his venison
steak.</p>

<p>Was it not possible that the warrior who fired the fatal arrow
believed the boys belonged to a large party of white hunters and
scouts, and had withdrawn long before? Was there not a chance
of getting away by a sudden dash?</p>

<p>Night was not far off, and if they could keep out of the hands
of the red men until then there was good ground for hoping they
would elude them altogether.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be gained by discussing or thinking over the matter,
and Ned acted at once.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he whispered to Blossom, "and don't make any noise."</p>

<p>The young hunter, trailing his rifle, stooped forward as far
as he could without impeding the power to walk, and then ran directly
from the tree, and back over the path that had brought them to
the clearing.</p>

<p>Blossom was at his heels, traveling quite rapidly; but glancing
behind him so often, he stumbled more than once. The negro had
quick eyesight, and once when he turned his head he saw something
flutter in the forest behind him; then there was what seemed to
be the flitting shadow of a bird's wing as it shot by with the
speed of a bullet.</p>

<p>But at the same instant a faint whizz caught his ear, and some
object whisked past his cheek and over the shoulder of the crouching
Ned Preston. The African had scarcely time to know that such a
thing had taken place when he heard a quick thud, and there it
was!</p>

<p>From the solid trunk of a massive maple projected an arrow, whose
head was buried in the bark; the shaft, with the eagle's feather,
still tremulous from the force with which it had been driven from
the bow.</p>

<p>The same Indian who had brought down the buck had sent a second
missile over the heads of the fugitives, and so close indeed that
the two might well pause and ask themselves whether it was worth
their while to run from such an unerring archer, who had the power
to bring them down with as much certainty as though he fired the
rifle of Daniel Boone or Simon Kenton.</p>

<p>But neither Ned Preston nor Blossom Brown was the one to stand
still when he had the opportunity of fleeing from danger. They
scarcely halted, therefore, for one glance at the significant
missile, when they made a slight turn to the left, and plunged
into the woods with all the speed they could command.</p>
