<p>Billy Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit often played together. Though they
did not look the least bit alike, they agreed almost perfectly in
one thing: they liked the same good things to eat. There was no
place they would rather go than Farmer Green's garden.
</p>
<p>But after he had had a bad fright one day, when dog Spot chased him
away from the lettuce-bed, Jimmy Rabbit did not go near the garden
for a long time. But he could not forget the taste of that crisp
lettuce. So one day he said to Billy Woodchuck:
</p><p>"How would you like to play a new game?"
</p><p>"What is it?" Billy asked. "If it's fun, of course I'd like it."
</p><p>"Well--did you ever play beggar?" Jimmy Rabbit asked him.
</p><p>"No! What's it like?"
</p><p>"It's like this," Jimmy told him. "You sit up on your hind legs,
hold your hands in front of you, and let your head hang over on one
side. And whenever anybody comes along you say: 'Please give me
something to eat! Nothing has passed these lips for two days!'"
</p><p>"B-but I've just had a good meal," Billy said. "And that wouldn't
be true."
</p><p>"Oh--this is just a game," Jimmy Rabbit said. "It's all right. It's
often done. Everybody will understand."
</p><p>"Well, then--where shall I sit?" Billy Woodchuck asked.
</p><p>"I'd advise you to go down near Farmer Green's garden," said
Jimmy--"there are so many people passing that way. I'll wait here
for you. And when you get enough food given you, you can bring it
right back here and I'll help you carry it home."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck thought that was very kind. So down he went toward
Farmer Green's garden. And near the fence, beside the bridge across
the brook, where the field-people often passed, he sat up just as
Jimmy Rabbit had told him to.
</p><p>Pretty soon he saw old Aunt Polly Woodchuck come along with a
basketful of goodies which she had gathered in the garden.
</p><p>"Please, ma'am, I'm hungry," Billy said. "Nothing has passed my
lips for a whole week." He thought "a week" sounded far better than
"two days."
</p><p>Now, Aunt Polly was a very old lady and almost blind. She could not
see how Billy's fat sides stuck out. And though she stopped and
looked at him closely, she did not know him--for all he was the son
of her own nephew.
</p><p>"My, my!" she said. "How hungry you must be! Here--you just take
this basket and go right home and have a good meal. I live 'way
over there under the hill. And you can bring my basket home
to-night."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck thanked her. He felt somewhat ashamed to take the
peas and lettuce and apples and clover-heads. But he remembered it
was only a <u>game</u>. And Jimmy Rabbit had said it was all right.
</p><p>Old Aunt Polly Woodchuck trudged back to the garden again. And
Billy hurried back to the place where Jimmy Rabbit was waiting.
</p><p>"See what I've brought!" he said proudly. "Now you take hold of
the other side of the basket and we'll carry it home to my mother."
</p><p>"I wouldn't do that if I were you," said Jimmy Rabbit.
</p><p>"Why not?" asked Billy.
</p><p>"Well--I just wouldn't. I forgot to remember that it's bad luck not
to sit right down and eat whatever's given you like this. And you
don't want to have bad luck."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck was sure he didn't.
</p><p>"All right, then!" said Jimmy Rabbit. "And they say it's bad luck
if you leave a single scrap uneaten. So I'll sit down too, and help
you."
