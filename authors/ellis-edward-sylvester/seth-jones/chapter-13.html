<p>The village of the Mohawks was at a considerable distance from
the spot where had once stood the home of the woodman&mdash;and encumbered
as they were with plunder, their progress was necessarily slow;
besides, knowing full well that pursuit would be useless upon
the part of the whites, there was no occasion to hasten their
steps. When, however, Seth Jones’ unceremonious entrance among
them, together with the escape of his new companion, and the subsequent
report of the smaller party with Ina, was made known, the old
chief began to have some misgiving about his fancied security.
It occurred to him that there might be a large party of whites
upon the trail, and in such a case, his greatest skill was required
to retain the captives. And here was the trouble. If he was pursued&mdash;and
upon that point there could be no doubt&mdash;his progress must be
hastened. His pursuers would follow with the swiftness of vengeance.
With the plunder in their possession, the thing was impossible,
and he saw, at length, that stratagem must be resorted to.</p>

<p>He selected six of his bravest and fleetest warriors&mdash;two of
whom had been Graham’s most troublesome enemies in his fearful
chase&mdash;and placed Ina in their charge, with instructions to make
all haste to the Indian village. Before starting, it occurred
to him that the best plan would be to send the white man also
with them. Were he to remain with the larger party in case of
attack, his presence, he had reason to fear, would be their own
destruction, while six savages surely armed and ever vigilant,
could surely guard an unarmed idiot and a woman.</p>

<p>The chief as stated, was well satisfied that he was pursued.
Hence, if he could throw his pursuers off the scent, their discomfiture
would be certain. He believed this could be done. How well he
succeeded, has already been shown. The six savages with their
charge parted from the larger company, and struck off rapidly
in a direction diverging to the north. Their trail was so concealed
as to give the impression that there were but three of them, and
this deception we have seen misled the hunter. A piece of Ina’s
dress was purposely lodged upon a bush, in the rear of the larger
party; and promiscuously and hopefully, the chief leisurely continued
his way with his dusky followers.</p>

<p>After the parties had parted company, the smaller one hastened
rapidly forward. Ina, in charge of a stalwart, athletic Indian
was kept to the front, the more effectually to conceal her trail,
while Seth kept his position near the centre of the file. He was
allowed the free use of his hands, though, as has been remarked,
he was deprived of his weapons. As they journeyed hastily forward,
he made it a point to enlighten them as much as possible by his
conversation, and certainly original remarks.</p>

<p>"If you have no objection, I wouldn’t mind knowing your idea
in thus leaving the other Injins, eh?" he remarked, quizzically
of the savage in front. No reply being given, he continued:</p>

<p>"I s’pose you’re thinking about that house you burnt down, and
feeling bad &mdash;Oh, you ain’t, eh?" suddenly remarked Seth,
as the Indian glared fiercely at him.</p>

<p>"It was a bad trick, I allow," he continued, "enough to make
a feller mad, I swow. That house, I shouldn’t wonder now, took
that Haverland a week to finish; ’twas an ugly piece of business&mdash;yes,
sir."</p>

<p>At intervals, the savages exchanged a word with each other, and
once or twice, one of them took the back trail, evidently to ascertain
whether they had any pursuers. Finding they had not, they slackened
their speed somewhat, as Ina had given signs of fatigue, and they
believed there was really no occasion for hastening. But the weariness
which the fair captive had endured, so increased, that long before
the sun had reached its meridian, they halted for a half-hour’s
rest. This was at the crossing of a small, sparkling stream. As
the sun was now quite hot, and the atmosphere thick and heavy,
the rest in the cool shadows of the trees was doubly refreshing.
Ina seated herself upon the cool moist earth, her captors preserving,
singularly enough, a far more vigilant watch over her than over
Seth Jones; but, for that matter, the latter was allowed no very
special freedom. A couple of Indians again took the back-trail
for prudent reasons, but met with nothing to excite their apprehensions.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Seth continued tumbling over the ground, occasionally
giving vent to snatches of song, and now and then a sage remark.
Without being noticed, he picked a small chalky pebble from the
margin of the brook, and working his way to a large flat stone,
executed, with many flourishes, the writing to which we referred
in a preceding chapter. Although cleverly done, this latter act
did not escape the eyes of the suspicious savages. One immediately
arose, and walking to him, pointed down and gruffly asked:</p>

<p>"What, that?"</p>

<p>"Read it fur yourself," replied Seth innocently.</p>

<p>"What, that?" repeated the savage, menacingly.</p>

<p>"A little flourishing I was executing, jist to pass away time."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the Indian, and dipping his big foot in the brook,
he irreverently swept it across the stone, completely wiping out
Seth’s beautiful chirography.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said the latter, "saved me the trouble. I can
write on it again when it gits dry."</p>

<p>But no opportunity was given, as a moment after the scouts returned,
and the line of march was taken up. But Seth well knew he had
accomplished all that could be desired. He had taken particular
pains that the pebble should be flinty enough to scratch into
the soft stone every word that he wrote. Consequently, the party
had not been gone a half-hour, when every letter came but as clear
and distinct as before, despite the wet daub the indignant savage
had given it.</p>

<p>Their progress for a time was quite rapid. Seth, somehow or other,
was constantly pitching out of file, breaking down the twigs along
the way, stumbling against the stones which were not in the way,
and, in spite of the menaces and occasional blows of his captors,
making the trail unnecessarily distinct and plain.</p>

<p>At noon, another halt was made, and all partook of some food.
Ina was sick at heart, and ate but a mouthful. An apprehension
of her dreadful position came over her, and her soul reeled as
she began picturing what was yet to come. Seth quarreled with
two of his captors, because, he affirmed, they took more than
their share of the dinner; and, take it all in all, affairs were
getting into as interesting a state as one could well conceive.</p>

<p>The meal finished, they again set forward. From the whispered
consultation of the savages, as well as the words which reached
Seth’s ears, and their utter disregard of Ina’s painful fatigue,
he began to believe that the Indians suspected that their stratagem
had not misled their pursuers, and were apprehensive of pursuit.
Finally, Seth became satisfied that such was the case, and when
they halted toward the middle of the afternoon, he again gave
vent to his thoughts upon a friendly stone which offered itself,
and this, again, received a fierce wipe from the foot of the same
savage, and the words again came out to view, and accomplished
all that their ardent author could have desired.</p>

<p>These acts of Seth, settled the suspicions of his captors into
a certainty, and a closer surveillance was kept upon their refractory
captive. No further opportunities were given him, and as he himself
had expected this turn of matters, there was need for it upon
his part. Although he had little reason to hope it, he did hope
and believe that Haverland and Graham were upon the trail, and
he felt that if the words intended for their eyes could only reach
them, the fate of Ina and himself was determined.</p>

<p>The moon being at its full, and shining in unclouded splendor
upon the forest, so lightened the way that the savages continued
their flight&mdash;as it may now be well called&mdash;for an hour or two
in the evening. They would have probably gone farther, had it
not been painfully evident that Ina was ready to give out. The
old chief had given them imperative commands not to hasten her
too much, and to rest when they saw she needed it. Accordingly,
though they were brutal enough to insult her with menaces, they
were of no avail, and, finally, they came to a reluctant halt
for the night.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to understand the situation of these savages
and their captives, in order to comprehend the events that followed.</p>

<p>A fire was started, and just within the circle of this, half-reclining
upon the ground was Ina, with a heavy Indian shawl thrown around
her. She had partaken of none of the food offered, and was already
in a semi-conscious state. On either side of her was seated a
vigilant savage, well armed and prepared for any emergency. Upon
the opposite side was Seth, his feet firmly lashed together, while
his hands were free. Two Indians were upon his right, and one
upon his left. The remaining one took his station about a hundred
yards on the back-trail.</p>

<p>Here, lying flat on his face, he silently waited for the approach
of the enemy.</p>
