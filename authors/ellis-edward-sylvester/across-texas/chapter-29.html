<p><em>WHILE </em>Herbert Watrous lay on the ground, at the top
of the elevation, with the Texans waiting for the return of the
old trapper, he asked Strubell to explain their action on the
night of the first norther, when they sent him and Nick through
the hills to the other side.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the cowboy, "our first purpose was to have you
out of the way when the scrimmage took place, for we knew it was
coming sure."</p>

<p>"But you said you had no trouble with Rickard and his gang."</p>

<p>"And we didn’t; off in another direction was a party of Comanches
that must have taken us for their own warriors, for they began
signalling in a way that made it look so. We answered their signals,
but they found out the trick before we could trap them. However,
they were out for game, and they came at us in the evening. It
isn’t worth while to give the particulars," added the Texan significantly,
"but when the fun opened it wasn’t long before the red gentlemen
found out their mistake. They rode off—that is, some of them did—and
that was all."</p>

<p>"But what of Rickard and his men?"</p>

<p>"While we were having the row with the Comanches they played
a clever trick on us. They got round through the ridge, without
our suspecting it till next morning, and walked off with Nick."</p>

<p>"They might as well have captured both of us," said Herbert,
"and I have often wondered that they did not."</p>

<p>"They took the highest priced one," observed Strubell, with a
chuckle, "but I guess there was another reason. Bell had a spite
against Nick, and meant to put him out of the way if he couldn’t
fix the ransom business. While the main thing was money with him,
it wasn’t that alone."</p>

<p>This point in the story was reached when the three heard the
report of old Eph’s pistol, which rang out on the night with startling
distinctness. It was nearer the building than the elevation where
the friends were awaiting the return of the trapper.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" exclaimed Strubell in an excited undertone, "I
can’t stay here, knowing he needs our help, for all he told us
to do so."</p>

<p>"And I feel the same way," added Lattin, rising partly to his
feet, "but what about leaving Herbert here?"</p>

<p>It was this thought that held the two for a moment, but the youth
hastened to say:</p>

<p>"If you can do him any good, go at once; I am in no danger."</p>

<p>"I think not, but I aint sure. If anything disturbs you," added
the elder, "mount your horse and make off; your pony can go as
fast as any of theirs."</p>

<p>But for the belief, confirmed by the action of the Apaches, that
they did not suspect the presence of the whites, neither Strubell
nor Lattin would have allowed Herbert to be alone; but they knew
that if they were to help the trapper not a second was to be lost.</p>

<p>Instead of mounting their animals, they hurried down the slope
on foot, breaking into a run, or rather loping trot, which enabled
them to cover much ground with little noise, as their feet pressed
the greensward.</p>

<p>The distance was considerable, and when they approached the spot
where the pistol had been fired, they slackened their pace, listening
and peering into the gloom, which was so deep that they could
see no more than fifty feet in any direction.</p>

<p>"This must be near the place," whispered Lattin, "but where is
he?"</p>

<p>"It’s a good sign if we can’t find him, though I don’t understand
why he used his pistol unless he was in trouble."</p>

<p>As nearly as they could judge, they were within two or three
hundred yards of the building. It was so easy to err as to the
point whence the report had come that they paused, undecided what
to do.</p>

<p>Darkness was on every hand. Not the first outlines of the structure
could be distinguished, nor was there a glimpse of any man or
animal. The stars were shining brightly in the clear sky, and
their light was all that guided their progress.</p>

<p>"We’ll go a little further," said Strubell in the same guarded
undertone, "but we must be on the watch, for we’re in a bad place
ourselves."</p>

<p>"<em>Sh!</em>" At that moment, they caught the sound of a horse’s
hoofs, their experience telling them the animal was on a gallop.
The noise was faint—quickly dying out, thus showing that the pony
was receding instead of approaching. Nothing, therefore, was to
be feared from the rider of that particular animal.</p>

<p>To guard against passing their friend, the Texans now separated
a few paces, taking care to keep within sight of each other. They
pushed forward at a moderate walk, on the alert for the first
evidence of danger.</p>

<p>A couple of rods were traversed in this manner when Lattin, who
was on the left, emitted a faint hissing sound. At the same instant
he sank to the ground, and Strubell was hardly a second behind
him in doing the same. He saw nothing, but he knew that his friend
did.</p>

<p>A form so dim, shadowy, and indistinct that he could trace nothing
more than its outlines took shape in the gloom itself, a short
distance in front of Lattin, who was so quick to utter the warning
to his companion. It was not a horseman, but a man on foot.</p>

<p>The suspicion that it might be the trapper caused the Texan to
give another faint call—so faint indeed that the alert ear of
an Apache would not have noticed it. Old Eph would be sure, however,
to read its meaning.</p>

<p>But the reply was not satisfactory. Instead of answering it with
a similar signal, the silence was not broken, and, while the Texan
was peering into the darkness, he became aware that he was staring
at vacancy. The form had melted into the gloom—proof that it was
moving in another direction.</p>

<p>"It must have been one of the varmints," whispered Lattin, as
he stepped noiselessly to the side of his friend, "but I didn’t
s’pose they was walkin’ round instead of ridin’ their animals."</p>

<p>"They must suspect something; I guess Eph got through, after
all."</p>

<p>"We’ll go a little further," said Lattin, turning to the left
again; "maybe he’s hurt so bad he can’t help himself."</p>

<p>The stillness continued, until once more they came together with
the decision to return to the elevation where they had left Herbert.
The fact that the Apaches were moving about on foot caused uneasiness
concerning him, and they thought it best to return at once.</p>

<p>"Do you see it?" asked Strubell.</p>

<p>"Yes; we’re further along than I thought."</p>

<p>It was the old mission building to which they alluded. It loomed
to view in the darkness, its outlines dimly traceable against
the starlit sky beyond. Not the first glimmer of a light showed,
nor could the strained ear catch the semblance of a sound. But
for that glimpse of the man on foot they would have believed the
Apaches had departed with the coming of night.</p>

<p>It was idle to stay longer, and they turned about, moving off
with the same care displayed from the first, for they were more
anxious than either would confess to rejoin the youth, further
away than they wished was the case.</p>

<p>The result of their venture did much to relieve them of fear
concerning Eph Bozeman, though it was not altogether satisfactory.
He might have collided with several Apaches on foot, and been
despatched. It was impossible in the darkness to strike the exact
spot where the meeting occurred, and, for aught they knew, the
body of the old trapper was lying at that moment, cold and lifeless,
with the face upturned to the stars.</p>

<p>As the distance from the building increased, the Texans hastened
their footsteps, and it was a striking proof of their skill in
such delicate situations that they came back to the elevation
within a rod of the spot where they had left it. Without anything
to guide them, except that strange, unexplainable intuition or
instinct, this was a remarkable exploit in its way.</p>

<p>But to their alarm, when they peered about them, after recognizing
the place, they failed to see Herbert.</p>

<p>"Something must have alarmed him," said Strubell; "but I hope
it was nothing serious."</p>

<p>"We’ll soon know," said Lattin, who moved hastily back to where
the horses had been placed. He was away but a moment when he came
back.</p>

<p>"The ponies are all there but his; he’s gone."</p>
