<p>"Silence!" whispered Antonio, who divined Simon's feeling of revolt.
</p><p>"Why?" asked Simon. "They can't hear."
</p><p>"They can. Most of the panes are missing."
</p><p>Simon continued, in the same low tone:
</p><p>"But where's Miss Bakefield?"
</p><p>"This morning I saw her, from here, on that other chair, bound like
her father."
</p><p>"And now?"
</p><p>"I don't know. But I suppose Rolleston has taken her into his cabin."
</p><p>"Where's that?"
</p><p>"He's occupying three or four, those over there."
</p><p>"Oh," gasped Simon, "it's horrible! And there's no other way out?"
</p><p>"None."
</p><p>"Still, we can't. . . ."
</p><p>"The least sound would be Miss Bakefield's undoing," Antonio declared.
</p><p>"But why?"
</p><p>"I am sure of it. . . . All this is thought out. . . . That threat of
death to her father; it's blackmail. Besides. . . ."
</p><p>One of the women moved to a cabin door, listened and returned,
sniggering:
</p><p>"The chit's defending herself. The chief will have to employ strong
measures. You're resolved to go through with it, are you?"
</p><p>"Of course!" said the other, nodding in the direction of her hand.
"Twenty quid extra for each of us: it's worth it! On the word of
command, pop! And there you are!"
</p><p>The old man's face remained impassive. His eyes were closed; he
appeared to be asleep. Simon was distracted:
</p><p>"Did you hear? Isabel and Rolleston: she's struggling with him. . . ."
</p><p>"Miss Bakefield will hold out. The sentence of death has not been
issued," said Antonio.
</p><p>One of the men keeping watch at the entrance to the gangway now came
along on his rounds, walking slowly and listening. Antonio recognized
him:
</p><p>"He's one of the original accomplices. Rolleston had all his Hastings
stalwarts with him."
</p><p>The man shook his head:
</p><p>"Rolleston is wrong. A leader doesn't concern himself like that with
trifles."
</p><p>"He's in love with the girl."
</p><p>"A funny way of being in love! . . . He has been persecuting her now
for four days."
</p><p>"Why does she refuse him? To begin with she's his wife. She said yes
just now."
</p><p>"She said yes because, ever since this morning, some one has been
squeezing dear papa's throat."
</p><p>"Well, she'll say yes presently so that it shan't be squeezed a little
tighter."
</p><p>The man bent down:
</p><p>"How's the old chap doing?"
</p><p>"Impossible to say!" growled the woman, who held the cord. "He told
his daughter not to give in, said that he'd rather die. Since then,
you'd think he's sleeping. It's two days since he had anything to
eat."
</p><p>"All this sort of thing," retorted the sentry, moving off, "isn't
business. Rolleston ought to be on deck. Suppose something happened,
suppose we were to be attacked, suppose the enclosure was invaded!"
</p><p>"In that case, I've got orders to finish the old man off."
</p><p>"That wouldn't make us come out on top."
</p><p>A short time elapsed. The two women talked in very low tones. At
moments Simon seemed to hear raised voices from the cabin:
</p><p>"Listen," he said. "That's Rolleston, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Yes," said the Indian.
</p><p>"We must do something, we must do something," said Simon.
</p><p>The door of the cabin was flung open violently. Rolleston appeared. He
shouted angrily to the women:
</p><p>"Are you ready? Count three minutes. In three minutes strangle him,"
and, turning round, "You understand, Isabel? Three minutes. Make up
your mind, my girl."
</p><p>He slammed the door behind him.
</p><p>Quick as thought, Simon had seized Antonio's rifle, but, hampered by
the bars, he was unable to take aim before the villain had closed the
door.
</p><p>"You will spoil everything!" said Antonio, crawling from under the
tarpaulin and wresting the rifle from him.
</p><p>Simon, in turn, stood up, with distorted features:
</p><p>"Three minutes! Oh, poor girl, poor girl!"
</p><p>Antonio tried to restrain him:
</p><p>"Let's think of something. There must be a porthole in the cabin."
</p><p>"Too late. She will have killed herself by then. We must act at once."
</p><p>He reflected for a moment, then suddenly began to run along the deck
and, reaching the hatch of the companion-way, jumped to the bottom.
The gangway began with a wider landing where the sentry sat playing
cards and drinking.
</p><p>They rose. One of them commanded:
</p><p>"Halt! No passage here!"
</p><p>"All hands on deck! Every man to his post," shouted Simon, repeating
Rolleston's words. "At the double! And no quarter! The gold! The rain
of gold has started again!"
</p><p>The men leapt to their feet and made off up the companion. Simon
darted down the gangway, ran into one of the two women, whom his
shouts had attracted, and flung the same words at her:
</p><p>"The gold! The rain of gold! Where's the chief?"
</p><p>"In his cabin," she replied. "Tell him!"
</p><p>And she made off in her turn.
</p><p>The other woman, who held the cord, hesitated. Simon felled her with a
blow on the point of the chin. Then, without troubling about Lord
Bakefield, he rushed to the cabin. At that moment, Rolleston opened
the door, shouting:
</p><p>"What's up? The gold?"
</p><p>Simon laid hold of the door to prevent his closing it and saw Isabel,
at the back of the cabin, alive.
</p><p>"Who are you?" asked the villain, uneasily.
</p><p>"Simon Dubosc."
</p><p>There was a pause, a respite before the struggle which Simon believed
inevitable. But Rolleston fell back, with haggard eyes:
</p><p>"M. Dubosc? . . . M. Dubosc? . . . The one who was killed just now?"
</p><p>"The same," said a voice in the gangway. "And it was I who killed him,
I, Antonio, the friend of Badiarinos whom you murdered."
</p><p>"Ah!" groaned Rolleston, collapsing. "I'm done for!"
</p><p>He was paralysed by his drunkenness, by his state of stupor and even
more obviously by his natural cowardice. Without offering the least
resistance, he allowed himself to be knocked down and disarmed by
Antonio, while Simon and Isabel rushed into each other's arms.
</p><p>"My father?" murmured the girl.
</p><p>"He's alive. Don't be afraid."
</p><p>Together they went to release him. The old lord was at the end of his
forces. It was all that he could do to kiss his daughter and press
Simon's hand. Isabel too was on the verge of swooning; shaken with a
nervous tremor, she fell into Simon's arms, faltering:
</p><p>"Oh, Simon, you were just in time. I should have killed myself! . . .
Oh, what degradation! . . . How shall I ever forget?"
</p><p>Great as was her distress, she had nevertheless the strength to check
Antonio's hand when he raised it to stab Rolleston:
</p><p>"No, please don't. . . . Simon, you agree, don't you. We haven't the
right. . . ."
</p><p>Antonio protested:
</p><p>"You're wrong, Miss. A monster like that has to be got rid of."
</p><p>"Please! . . ."
</p><p>"As you will. But I shall get him again. We have an account to settle,
he and I. M. Dubosc, lend me a hand to tie him up!"
</p><p>The Indian lost no time. Knowing the ruse which Simon had employed to
remove the guards, he expected them to return at any moment, no doubt
escorted by their comrades. He therefore shoved Rolleston to the other
end of the corridor and bundled him into a dark cupboard.
</p><p>"Like that," he said, "his accomplices won't find their chief and will
look for him outside."
</p><p>He also bound and locked up the big woman, who was beginning to
recover from her torpor. Then, despite the exhausted condition of Lord
Bakefield and his daughter, he led them to the companion.
</p><p>Simon had to carry Isabel. When he reached the deck of the <u>Ville de
Dunkerque</u>, he was astounded to hear the rattling sounds and to see
the great sheaf of pebbles and water spurting towards the sky. By a
lucky coincidence, the phenomenon had occurred just as he announced it
and caused an excitement by which he had time to profit. Isabel and
Lord Bakefield were laid under the tarpaulin, that part of the wreck
being deserted. Then Antonio and Simon went to the companion in quest
of news. A band of ruffians came pouring down it, shouting:
</p><p>"The chief! Where's Rolleston?"
</p><p>Several of them questioned Antonio, who pretended to be equally at a
loss:
</p><p>"Rolleston? I've been hunting for him everywhere. I expect he's at the
barricades."
</p><p>The ruffians streamed back again, scampering up on deck. At the foot
of the platform they held a conference, after which some ran towards
the enclosing fence, while others, following Rolleston's example,
shouted:
</p><p>"Every man to his post! No quarter! Shoot, can't you, down there?"
</p><p>"What's happening?" whispered Simon.
</p><p>"They're wavering," said Antonio, "and giving way. Look beyond the
enclosure. The crowd is attacking at several points."
</p><p>"But they're firing on it."
</p><p>"Yes, but in disorder, at random. Rolleston's absence is already
making itself felt. He was a leader, he was. You should have seen him
organize his two or three hundred recruits in a few hours and place
each man where he was best suited! He didn't only rule by terror."
</p><p>The eruption did not last long and Simon had an impression that the
rain of gold was less abundant. But it exercised no less attraction
upon those whose work it was to collect it and upon others who, no
longer encouraged by their leader's voice, were abandoning the
barricades.
</p><p>"Look," said Antonio. "The attacks are becoming fiercer. The enemy
feels that the besieged are losing hold."
</p><p>The slope was invaded from every side; and small bodies of men pushed
forward, more numerous and bolder as the firing became less intense.
The machine-gun, whether abandoned or destroyed, was no longer in
action. The chief's accomplices, who had stood in front of the
platform, finding themselves unable to enforce their authority and
restore discipline, leapt into the arena and ran to the trenches. They
were the most resolute of the defenders. The assailants hesitated.
</p><p>So, for two hours, fortunes of the fight swayed to and fro. When night
fell, the battle was still undecided.
</p><p>Simon and Antonio, seeing the wreck deserted, collected the necessary
arms and provisions. They intended to prepare for flight at midnight,
if circumstances permitted. Antonio went off to reconnoitre, while
Simon watched over the repose of his two patients.
</p><p>Lord Bakefield, although fit to travel, was still badly pulled down
and slept, though his sleep was disturbed by nightmares. But Simon's
presence restored to Isabel all her energy, all her vitality. Sitting
side by side, holding each other's hands, they told the story of those
tragic days; and Isabel spoke of all that she had suffered, of
Rolleston's cruelty, of his coarse attentions to her, of the constant
threat of death which he held over Lord Bakefield if she refused to
yield, of the nightly orgies in camp, the bloodshed, the tortures, the
cries of the dying and the laughter of Rolleston's companions. . . .
</p><p>She shuddered at certain recollections, nestling against Simon as
though she feared to find herself once more alone. All around them was
the flash of fire-arms and the rattle of shots which seemed to be
coming nearer. A din at once confused and terrific, made up of a
hundred separate combats, death-struggles and victories, hovered above
the dark plain, over which, however, a pale light appeared to be
spreading.
</p><p>Antonio returned in an hour's time and declared that flight was
impossible:
</p><p>"Half the trenches," he said, "are in the hands of the assailants, who
have even penetrated into the enclosure. And they won't let any one
pass, any more than the besieged will."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"They're afraid of gold being taken away. It seems that there's a sort
of discipline among them and that they're obeying leaders whose object
is to capture from the besieged the enormous booty which they have
accumulated. And, as the assailants are ten or even twenty to one, we
must expect a wholesale massacre!"
</p><p>The night was full of tumult. Simon observed that the dense layer of
clouds was breaking up in places and that gleams of light were falling
from the starry sky. They could see figures darting across the arena.
Two men first, then a number of others boarded the <u>Ville de
Dunkerque</u> and went down the nearest companion way.
</p><p>"Rolleston's accomplices returning," murmured Antonio.
</p><p>"What for? Are they looking for Rolleston?"
</p><p>"No, they think he's dead. But there are the bags, the bags filled
with coin, and they are all going to fill their pockets."
</p><p>"The gold is there, then?"
</p><p>"In the cabins. Rolleston's share on one side; his accomplices on the
other."
</p><p>Below deck quarrels were beginning, followed almost immediately by a
general affray, which was punctuated by yells and moans. One by one
the victors emerged from the companion way. But shadows crept down it
all night long; and the newcomers were heard searching and destroying.
</p><p>"They'll find Rolleston in the end," said Simon.
</p><p>"I don't care if they do," said Antonio, with a grin which Simon was
to remember thereafter.
</p><p>The Indian was getting together their arms and ammunition. A little
before daybreak, he awoke Lord Bakefield and his daughter and gave
them rifles and revolvers. The final assault would not be long
delayed; and he calculated that the <u>Ville de Dunkerque</u> would be the
immediate objective of the assailants and that it would be better not
to linger there.
</p><p>The little party therefore set out when the first pale gleams of dawn
showed in the sky. They had not set foot on the sand of the arena
before the signal for the attack was given by a powerful voice which
sounded from the bulk of the submarine; and it so happened that, at
the very moment when the final offensive was launched, when the
besieged, better armed than the attackers, were taking measures of
defense which were also better organized, the roar of the eruption
rent the air with its thousand explosions.
</p><p>Then and there, the enemy's onslaught became more furious, and the
besieged began to retreat, as Simon and Antonio perceived from the
disorderly rush of men falling back like trapped animals, seeking
cover behind which to defend themselves or hide.
</p><p>In the middle of the arena, the scorching rain and the showers of
falling pebbles created a circular empty space; nevertheless, some of
the more desperate assailants were bold enough to venture into it and
Simon had a fleeting vision in which he seemed to see--but was it
possible?--Old Sandstone running this way and that under a strange
umbrella made of a round sheet of metal with the edge turned down.
</p><p>The mob of invaders was growing denser. They collided with groups of
men and women, brandishing sticks, old swords, scythes, hill-hooks and
axes, who fell upon the fugitives. Simon and Antonio were twice
obliged to take part in the fighting.
</p><p>"The position is serious," said Simon, taking Isabel aside. "We must
risk all for all and try to find a way through. Kiss me, Isabel, as
you did on the day of the shipwreck."
</p><p>She gave him her lips, saying:
</p><p>"I have absolute faith in you, Simon."
</p><p>After many efforts and two brushes with some ruffians who tried to
stop them, they reached the line of the barricades and crossed it
without hindrance. But in the open space outside they met fresh waves
of marauders breaking furiously against the defences, including
parties of men who seemed to be running away, rather than pursuing a
quarry. It was as though they themselves were threatened by some great
danger. Fierce and murderous for all that, they plundered the dead and
wildly attacked the living.
</p><p>"Look out!" cried Simon.
</p><p>It was a band of thirty or forty street-boys and hooligans, among whom
he recognized two of the tramps who had pursued him. At sight of
Simon, they egged on the gang under their command. By some ill chance
Antonio slipped and fell. Lord Bakefield was knocked down. Simon and
Isabel, caught in an eddy, felt that they were being stifled by a
mass of bodies whirling about them. Simon, however, succeeded in
seizing hold of her and levelling his revolver. He fired three times
in succession. Isabel did likewise. Two men dropped. There was a
moment's hesitation; then a new onslaught separated the lovers.
</p><p>"Simon, Simon!" cried the terrified girl.
</p><p>One of the tramps roared:
</p><p>"The girl! Carry her off! She'll fetch her weight in gold!"
</p><p>Simon tried to reach her. Twenty hands opposed his desperate efforts;
and, while defending himself, he saw Isabel pushed towards the
barricades by the two tramps. She stumbled and fell. They were trying
to raise her when suddenly two shots rang out and both fell headlong.
</p><p>"Simon! Antonio!" cried a voice.
</p><p>Through the fray Simon saw Dolores, sitting erect on a horse all
covered with foam. Her rifle was levelled and she was firing. Three of
the nearest aggressors were struck. Simon contrived to break away, run
to Isabel and join Dolores, to whom Antonio at the same time was
bringing Lord Bakefield.
</p><p>Thus the four were together again, but each was followed by the
rabble of persistent marauders, and these were reinforced by dozens of
others, who loomed out of the fog and doubtless imagined that the
stake in such a battle, in which the number of their opponents was so
small, must be the capture of some treasure.
</p><p>"There are more than a hundred of them," said Antonio. "We are done
for."
</p><p>"Saved!" cried Dolores, who now ceased firing.
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Yes, we must hold out . . . one minute. . . ."
</p><p>Dolores' reply was drowned in the uproar. Their assailants came along
with a rush. With their backs against the horse, the little party
faced in all directions, firing, wounding, killing. With his left hand
Simon discharged his revolver, while with his right hand, which
gripped his rifle by the barrel, whirling it to terrible effect, he
held the enemy at a distance.
</p><p>But how could they resist the torrent, continually renewed, that
rushed upon them. They were submerged. Old Lord Bakefield was struck
senseless with a stick; and one of Antonio's arms was paralysed by a
blow from a stone. Any further resistance was out of the question. The
hideous moment had come when people fall, when their flesh is
trampled underfoot and torn asunder by the enemy's claws.
</p><p>"Isabel!" murmured Simon, crushing her passionately in his arms.
</p><p>They dropped to their knees together. The beasts of prey fell upon
them, covering them with darkness.
</p><p>A bugle sounded some distance away, scattering its lively notes upon
the air. Another call rang out in reply. It was a French bugle
sounding the charge.
</p><p>A great silence, heavy with fear, petrified the hoardes of pillagers.
Simon, who was losing consciousness, felt that the weight above him
was lightened. Some of the beasts of prey were taking flight.
</p><p>He half-raised himself, while supporting Isabel, and the first thing
that struck him was Antonio's attitude. The Indian, with drawn face,
was gazing at Dolores. Slowly and steadily he took a few steps towards
her, like a cat creeping up to its prey, and suddenly, before Simon
could intervene, he leapt on the crupper behind her, passed his arms
under hers and dug his heels into the horse, which broke into a
gallop along the barricades, towards the north.
</p><p>From the opposite direction, through the mist, appeared the sky-blue
uniforms of France.
