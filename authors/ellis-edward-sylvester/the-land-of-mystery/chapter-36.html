<p>It may be doubted whether the most cool-headed of men could find
himself in such a situation as that of Fred Ashman, without being
overwhelmed by the bewildering wealth surrounding him.  He forgot
for the time that the lives of himself and lovely companion were
at stake, and that, despite her assurance that they were the first
persons who had ever entered the wonderful cavern of diamonds,
its existence might be known or discovered by their vengeful pursuers.</p>

<p>With the aid of his hunting knife, he set himself to work picking
out the precious gems that were within his reach at all times.</p>

<p>Now and then, when some one of unusual size fell into his palm
he uttered an exclamation of delight, and turned and held it up
for Ariel to admire.  She smiled at his pleasure, and showed her
sympathy by assisting in the excavation of the marvellous pebbles.</p>

<p>As they toiled, they advanced, sometimes a step at a time, and
then for several paces.  Conscious that he could carry away only
an infinitely small portion of the riches, Ashman found himself
in the unparalleled situation of casting aside the smaller gems
and taking only those that were large and of the first water.</p>

<p>Who before was compelled to fling away diamonds worth hundreds
of dollars apiece, simply because they were of too insignificant
value to be carried with him?  Ariel, who was a much better expert
than he, carefully selected the choicest until she was burdened
with all she could conveniently carry.  He filled his pockets
and thrust others into every receptacle at command.  The partially
emptied cartridge-belt was made to do duty as a casket, and it
is safe to say that no similar contrivance was ever laden with
a tithe of the riches that particular one held.</p>

<p>"Ah," reflected the young man again and again, "if only the Professor
and Long were here to help me!"</p>

<p>But there came the time, all too soon, when he was forced to
admit that it was useless to attempt to carry more.  He had the
wealth of a prince about his person, and yet the storehouse showed
no diminution of its boundless supply, which was enough to burden
a regiment of soldiers.</p>

<p>Gold, the most precious of all metals, for which men delve and
starve and toil and die, still lies hidden in immeasurable masses,
in unsuspected places, screened perhaps by a thin sheeting of
earth, over which thousands have tramped, never dreaming of the
boundless riches just beneath their feet.  And rubies and diamonds
strew the bottom of the ocean or scintillate within caverns and
caves, as they have shone and gleamed through ages, still waiting
for the fortunate miner or explorer to bring them to light and
the gaze of an admiring world.</p>

<p>"If I ever live to get away from this spot," added Ashman, when
he ceased his wonderful garnering, "I will bring a force here;
I can afford to make it irresistible by King Haffgo, for every
one of the men can take away a fortune and leave more than enough
for these barbarians."</p>

<p>"I can take no more," he said, turning his flushed face upon
the radiant countenance just behind him; "King Haffgo will never
miss these, but when I carry you to my distant home, Ariel, where
I shall cherish and love you forever, these diamonds will bring
us such wealth that we shall never know the meaning of want; every
luxury that affection can dream of, or heart can crave, shall
be yours."</p>

<p>"The greatest luxury my heart yearns for," said she softly, "is
<em>your</em> love."</p>

<p>"And that you have now," he replied catching her in his arms
and straining her to his heart.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," replied the happy maiden, resisting no longer
the ardent embrace of him whose affection seemed to grow with
every passing hour.</p>

<p>"All that I pray heaven to grant is the opportunity to prove
to you that you are not mistaken.  I do not want to leave here
or ever see my home again unless you are with me.  I shall live
or die with you, for death with you is preferable to life without
you, my cherished, my own Ariel."</p>

<p>The radiant countenance was illumined by a light such as only
the divine passion can impart.  She did not speak, for there are
some emotions of the soul beyond the power of language.</p>

<p>The hunt for the diamonds had taken the lovers to a point almost
opposite the entrance.  They observed what they had not noticed
during their absorbing work,&mdash;the ledge along which they advanced,
steadily ascended until it carried them to a point half-way to
the top of the mighty dome.  Standing there, they could look back
on the awful chasms spread below their feet, the crimsoned walls,
sparkling and scintillating with innumerable gems, with the craggy
roof seemingly almost within their reach.</p>

<p>Looking over the wild, dazzling, unapproachable scene, the American
was considering the practical question of what was next to be
done, when Ariel at his side abruptly seized his arm with an intensity
which startled and caused him to ask,</p>

<p>"What has frightened you, dearest?"</p>

<p>With a gasp, she pointed to the other side of the cavern, where
they had entered this region of enchantment and wonders.</p>

<p>A procession of figures was moving along the ledge, over which
they had just made their way.  The intervening objects shut them
partly out of sight, but the heads and shoulders of several were
always in view and they were moving with the utmost haste possible.</p>

<p>The foremost figure was a white man; the next was a dusky giant,
and the third was of fair complexion, while all the others were
of the hue of native Africans.</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking the identity of the leaders: the
foremost was Waggaman, the second, Ziffak, and the third, King
Haffgo.  Those who followed were the pick of the Murhapa warriors.</p>

<p>It mattered not whether Ariel was right in her belief that the
existence of the cavern of diamonds was unknown to every one else,
or that some fateful good fortune had directed the party to the
entrance. It was enough that they had found it, and were now pressing
forward along the very ridge on which they had halted, and stood
gazing back in amazement and horror, unable for the moment to
divine what could be done to help themselves.</p>

<p>But Ashman needed but a few seconds to decide his course.  He
held his Winchester and revolver and was ready to die in the defence
of the idol of his heart.</p>

<p>"Have courage," he said; "all is not yet lost."</p>

<p>The ledge on which they stood was so narrow that there was no
room for two to walk beside each other.  Lifting the gentle form
in one arm, he swung her over the abyss at his feet and placed
her on the ledge in front of him.</p>

<p>The danger was at the rear, and that was the place for him.</p>

<p>"Now advance," he added; "we may find a better spot than this
for defence."</p>

<p>He feared that his pursuers might divide, and some of them start
around the other way, so as to come upon him from the opposite
side.  If that were done, he would be caught between two fires;
and, since one of the party possessed a gun, the advantage would
be preponderatingly against him.</p>

<p>There was subject, too, for perplexing thought in the situation. 
He had no wish to shoot King Haffgo, and would not do it if any
possible way of avoiding it should present itself.  He determined
that he should be spared until the last one, when he could probably
be handled, without resorting to the last extremity.</p>

<p>Then, too, he felt no doubt about the presence of the giant Ziffak. 
He was the friend of himself and Ariel, though for politic reasons
he had assumed the guise of an enemy.  His situation was a most
delicate one, and, even in his bewilderment and anxiety, Ashman
could not help wondering how he would conduct himself in the crisis
at hand.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the American was resolved to avoid injuring the dusky
Hercules, it will be observed that there were two of the company
of pursuers whom he was much more anxious to spare than he was
to inflict harm upon the rest.</p>

<p>He was hopeful for a moment that he and his companion had not
been detected, but a resounding shout echoed through the cavern
of diamonds&mdash;a shout of such amazing power that he knew it had
come from the throat of Ziffak himself, who, as if to make sure
his meaning was not misunderstood, brandished his mighty javelin
over his prodigious head and shoulders, as he almost pushed his
leader from the path in front of him.</p>
