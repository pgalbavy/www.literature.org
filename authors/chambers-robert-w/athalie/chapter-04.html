<p>She was fifteen years old before she saw him again. His strap-watch
was still on her wrist; his memory, unfaded, still enshrined in
her heart of a child, for she was as yet no more than that at
fifteen. And the moment she saw him she recognised him.</p>

<p>It was on the Sixth Avenue Elevated Station at Twenty-third Street
one sunny day in April; he stood waiting for the downtown train
which she stepped out of when it stopped.</p>

<p>He did not notice her, so she went over to him and called him
by name; and the tall, good-looking, fashionably dressed young
fellow turned to her without recognition.</p>

<p>But the next instant his smooth, youthful face lighted up, and
off came his hat with the gay college band adorning it:</p>

<p>"Athalie Greensleeve!" he exclaimed, showing his pleasure unmistakably.</p>

<p>"C. Bailey, Junior," she rejoined as steadily as she could, for
her heart was beating wildly with the excitement of meeting him
and her emotions were not under full control.</p>

<p>"You have grown so," he said with the easy, boyish cordiality
of his caste, "I didn't recognise you for a moment. Tell me, do
you still live down&mdash;er&mdash;down there?"</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I knew you as soon as I set eyes on you. You are very much taller,
too.... No, we went away from Spring Pond the year after my father
died."</p>

<p>"I see," he said sympathetically. And back into his memory flashed
that scene with her by the stove in the dusky bar. And then he
remembered her as she stood in her red hood and cloak staring
at the closed door of the room where her dead father lay. And
he remembered touching her frosty little hand, and the incident
of the watch.</p>

<p>"I never went back there," he mused, half to himself, looking
curiously at the girl before him. "I wanted to go&mdash;but I never
did."</p>

<p>"No, you never came back," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. I was only a kid, you see. My mother wouldn't let
me go there that summer. And father and I joined a club down South
so we did not go back for the duck-shooting. That is how it happened."</p>

<p>She nodded, gravely, but said nothing to him about her faith
in his return, how confidently, how patiently she had waited through
that long, long summer for the boy who never returned.</p>

<p>"I did think of you often," he volunteered, smiling at her.</p>

<p>"I thought of you, too. I hoped you would come and let me teach
you to sail a boat."</p>

<p>"That's so! I remember now. You were going to show me how."</p>

<p>"Have you learned to sail a boat?"</p>

<p>"No. I'll tell you what I'll do, Athalie, I'll come down this
summer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don't live there any more."</p>

<p>"That's so. Where do you live?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and his eyes fell for the first time from her
youthful and engaging face to the clothes she wore&mdash;black clothes
that seemed cheap even to a boy who had no knowledge of feminine
clothing. She was all in rusty black, hat, gloves, jacket and
skirt; and the austere and slightly mean setting made the contrast
of her hair and skin the more fresh and vivid.</p>

<p>"I live," she replied diffidently, "with my two sisters in West
Fifty-fourth Street. I am stenographer and typewriter in the offices
of a department store."</p>

<p>"I'd like to come to see you," he said impulsively. "Shall <em>I&mdash;</em>when
vacation begins?"</p>

<p>"Are you still at school?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "I'm at Harvard. I'm down for Easter just now. Tell
me, Athalie, would you care to have me come to see you when I
return?"</p>

<p>"If you would care to come."</p>

<p>"I surely would!" he said cordially, offering his hand in adieu&mdash;"I
want to ask you a lot of questions and we can talk over all those
jolly old times,"&mdash;as though years of comradeship lay behind them
instead of an hour or two. Then his glance fell on the slim hand
he was shaking, and he saw the strap-watch which he had given
her still clasped around her wrist.</p>

<p>"You wear that yet?&mdash;that old shooting-watch of mine!" he laughed.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a better one than that next Christmas," he said,
taking out a little notebook and pencil. "I'll write it down&mdash;'strap-watch
for Athalie Greensleeve next Christmas'&mdash;there it is! And&mdash;will
you give me your address?"</p>

<p>She gave it; he noted it, closed his little Russia-leather book
with a snap, and pocketed it.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I saw you," said the girl; "I hope you won't forget
me. I am late; I must go &mdash;I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I'm glad I saw you,' said the girl; 'I hope
you won't forget me.'"]</p>

<p>"Indeed I won't forget you," he assured her warmly, shaking the
slender black-gloved hand again.</p>

<p>He meant it when he said it. Besides she was so pretty and frank
and honest with him. Few girls he knew in his own caste were as
attractive; none as simple, as direct.</p>

<p>He really meant to call on her some day and talk things over.
But days, and weeks, and finally months slipped away. And somehow,
in thinking of her and of his promise, there now seemed very little
left for them to talk about. After all they had said to each other
nearly all there was to be said, there on the Elevated platform
that April morning. Besides he had so many, many things to do;
so many pleasures promised and accepted, visits to college friends,
a fishing trip with his father,&mdash;really there seemed to be no
hour in the long vacation unengaged.</p>

<p>He always wanted to see her when he thought of her; he really
meant to find a moment to do it, too. But there seemed to be no
moment suitable.</p>

<p>Even when he was back in Cambridge he thought about her occasionally,
and planned, vaguely, a trip to New York so that he might redeem
his promise to her.</p>

<p>He took it out in thinking.</p>

<p>At Christmas, however, he sent her a wrist-watch, a dainty French
affair of gold and enamel; and a contrite note excusing himself
for the summer delinquencies and renewing his promise to call
on her.</p>

<p>The Dead Letter Office returned watch and letter.</p>
