<p>Bill Tozer rose to his feet. The interview was over, and little
remained to be said between the two.</p>

<p>"Then, Hank, you'll leave matters with me till I see you again?"</p>

<p>"When will that be?"</p>

<p>The man stood a moment in thought.</p>

<p>"In order that there shall be no mistake, let us agree that I
shall call here to-morrow morning&mdash;twenty-four hours from now.
How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>"That will do."</p>

<p>"I can make it less time than that, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"That suits; it's a go; good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by," and the visitor turned on his heel and strode across
the plateau, disappearing on the further margin, where he had
first shown himself.</p>

<p>Hank Hazletine stood looking after him as long as he was in sight.
When at last he vanished, an expression of scornful contempt darkened
the bearded face of the cowman, and he muttered:</p>

<p>"Bill Tozer, you think you're smart, but <em>I understand you</em>!"</p>

<p>In the interview which has just been recorded the visitor believed
he had outwitted the guide at every step, and yet exactly the
reverse was the fact. Hank Hazletine had pretended a stupidity
which was not real. He noted the contradictions in the declarations
of Tozer the instant they were made, but gave no evidence of it,
his object being to draw out the miscreant, in which purpose he
succeeded perfectly.</p>

<p>The whole truth was manifest to the guide. Fred Greenwood had
been abducted not by Motoza alone, but by him and Bill Tozer.
Beyond a doubt the daring scheme was the invention of the white
man, who found a willing partner in the vagrant Sioux, who burned
with enmity toward the youth. It was Tozer who made the mistake
of supposing that the father of Fred was half-owner of the ranch,
and, therefore, presumably a rich man. Tozer had formed the plan
of the abduction while at Bowman's ranch, and showed by his promptness
that he had not allowed the grass to grow under his feet.</p>

<p>These meditations occupied but a few minutes, when the cowman
walked toward Jack, who, seeing him approaching, advanced to meet
him. Hazletine felt that the change of conditions made it necessary
to talk more freely than heretofore with the boy.</p>

<p>"Hank, it seems to me we are throwing away time," said the youth,
a trifle impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that, younker. I've news fur you."</p>

<p>The guide had a good memory, and he repeated, almost word for
word, all that had been said by Tozer and himself. Jack was astounded.
His first emotion was of profound gratitude and delight, for the
interview seemed to establish that Fred Greenwood was alive, and
consequently within reach of recovery.</p>

<p>"He's not dead!" exclaimed the happy lad; "thank Heaven for that!
I shall soon see him! It seems too good to be true."</p>

<p>"It isn't best to be sartin of anything in this world," remarked
his friend, with a gravity of expression that ought to have chilled
the ardor of Jack, but it did not. The tidings were too exhilarating
for that.</p>

<p>"Now, younker," added the man, "we've got more time on our hands
than we know what to do with. Come over by the fire and set down
fur a while. How's that appetite of yours?"</p>

<p>"I am beginning to feel hungry."</p>

<p>"I thought so," observed Hank, with a smile.</p>

<p>"But there's no hurry. I can wait a little while."</p>

<p>"You'll have to."</p>

<p>"Now tell me who this man Tozer is?"</p>

<p>"Wal, he's a reg'lar Motoza, except in blood. I run across him
five years ago in Arizona, where he had been in the stage-robbin'
bus'ness. Things got so hot he had to git out. I didn't hear anything
more of him till I was driving cattle in Montana, when I discovered
he was one of the worst rustlers in that part of the world. I'm
sartin he has done a good many things fur which he ought to hang,
but he's more cunning in his way than the Sioux, and has kept
out of the penitentiary when anyone else would have been doing
a life-term. Bill is a great gambler, and has made and lost fortunes,
but he is always out of money and figgering how to git it ag'in.
There isn't anything too mean fur him to do fur money. He doesn't
care any more fur the feelings of others than Geronimo."</p>

<p>"It looks as if the plan of abducting Fred and holding him for
ransom is his."</p>

<p>"There ain't no doubt of it; he come to the ranch soon after
we'd gone and larned all 'bout you tenderfeet from the boys themselves.
The thought come to him at once that one of the chances of his
lifetime was his. It's queer he made the mistake of believing
that it was the father of the other younker as owned part of the
ranch, but he got matters twisted in some way. You can see that
if it hadn't been fur that blunder of his, it would be <em>you</em>
that your friend and me would be looking fur."</p>

<p>"I wish it were," was the honest exclamation of Jack Dudley;
"but how was it he came to form his partnership with Motoza?"</p>

<p>"You've heard it said the devil takes care of his own; Bill and
Motoza are old friends and have been in more than one shady job.
I can't know, but I think Bill must have larned or suspicioned
that the Sioux warn't fur off and he set out to hunt him up. Anyway
they managed to come together, and the job was fixed up atween
'em. Howsumever," said the guide, "there ain't no use of talking
and guessing over what <em>has been</em>, but we must face what
<em>is</em>. Now, if Doctor Greenwood has word by telegraph that
he must pay five thousand dollars to git his younker back agin,
what'll he think?"</p>

<p>"He will think that this has been a pretty expensive outing for
Fred," replied Jack, whose buoyancy of spirits prompted his trivial
answer.</p>

<p>"Will he pay the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and twice as much more, if it is necessary; but won't he
be startled and puzzled to know the meaning of it all! He will
come right out here himself and bring some of the best detectives
in the country."</p>

<p>"And if he does that, he'll never see his boy alive."</p>

<p>Jack looked at Hazletine in alarm and amazement. The cowman saw
phases of this extraordinary business that had not presented themselves
to the youth, and he now proceeded to impress them upon him. In
the first place, the cunning Tozer would make sure of protecting
himself and Motoza, though the last was purely a matter of policy
and self interest, since he was always ready to sacrifice a comrade.
In arranging the ransom or exchange, Tozer would take no chances.
The friends of Fred Greenwood would have to remain out of sight
and in the background. It would be impossible for any of them
to try to checkmate him without his quickly learning it, whereupon
he would abandon the job and turn over the boy to the savage will
of the Sioux.</p>

<p>"And you know what <em>that</em> means," added the cowman, impressively.
"I should tell you something else, too. It's my belief that if
the money is give to Tozer, and the Sioux is ordered to surrender
the younker, he hates him that bad that he'll try to bring about
his death and run the chances of hanging for it. Where two such
wretches as him and Tozer are in a job there's bound to be crooked
work, and I won't never believe you're going to shake the hand
of t'other younker till I see it done with my own eyes."</p>

<p>The emphasis of this declaration sent a thrill of alarm through
the frame of Jack Dudley, though it could not wholly destroy the
exhilaration caused by the knowledge that Fred Greenwood was alive.</p>

<p>It was proof of the kindliness of Hank Hazletine that he made
no mention of a strong suspicion that had been in his mind from
the first. This was that when Tozer met Motoza he learned that
the Sioux had already slain his prisoner, for Hank knew of the
furious hate the fellow held toward the youth. Consequently, Tozer
had arranged to carry out his original scheme, and was now seeking
to gain a large sum of money, knowing that it was out of his power
ever to fulfill his part of the bargain.</p>

<p>Hazletine, we repeat, strongly believed that this ghastly phase
of the business was true, but, inasmuch as there was no certainty
of it, he was too considerate to bring additional grief to the
heart of Jack Dudley.</p>

<p>But the cowman had formed a resolution which he carefully held
back from his companion. An interval of twenty-four hours must
pass before the second interview with Tozer, during which, as
the latter was given to understand, the negotiation would be left
wholly with him. Hank and Jack were to remain quiescent, at least
until after the next meeting. But the cowman nursed a very different
determination. He intended to employ all the time and the utmost
ability he possessed in defeating the atrocious plot of the miscreants.
It will be seen that the easiest plan for him was quietly to help
forward the negotiations, but his nature forbade such meek submissiveness
on his part.</p>

<p>This course, however, was perilous to the missing boy; for, if
Tozer or Motoza saw himself in danger of losing the prize, he
would make short work of the prisoner. It was clear that all the
skill and woodcraft of which the cowman was master would be needed
in the delicate task he had assigned to himself.</p>

<p>"Younker," he said, when the conversation had continued a while
longer, "after thinking over this bus'ness, I've made up my mind
it's better we should keep apart fur the day."</p>

<p>"Follow your own judgment. I shall try to be back this evening."</p>

<p>"To-morrer morning will be time 'nough. I had my supper last
night not fur from here, and if the wild animals haven't visited
the spot since, we shall find 'nough to make a square meal."</p>

<p>This was acceptable news, and the result all that could be desired.
Hank had cooked a considerable quantity of venison at a romantic
place among the rocks, his first intention being to carry enough
of it to headquarters to supply his young friends with what they
needed. Afterward he changed his mind and decided that it was
time they learned to provide for themselves. Upon making his way
to the spot he found everything as it had been left the previous
evening, and thus much more readily than Jack had dared to expect
he secured the needed food.</p>

<p>"Right here we part," said Hank at the conclusion of the meal.</p>

<p>"How am I to spend the time?"</p>

<p>"As your fancy strikes you. As I told you, it will be soon 'nough
fur you to git back to camp to-morrer morning, but you must keep
your eyes open. It may be that Tozer, having larned that your
father is the man he meant to bleed, will try to make a prisoner
of you."</p>

<p>Jack Dudley's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Let him try it! I should like to be in Fred's company."</p>

<p>"Mebbe you wouldn't be so well suited as you think, but look
out fur snares in your path&mdash;that's all I've got to say. I'm off."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the cowman to take his departure in
this abrupt manner, his intention being to undertake without delay
the difficult task he had set out for himself, but five minutes
later he gave over his purpose, and, to the surprise of Jack Dudley,
came back to him.</p>

<p>In doing this, Hazletine was wise. His purpose, as already intimated,
was to discover if possible Motoza and Tozer, but especially the
former. There was little doubt that the Sioux would communicate
with his prisoner during the day, or, if Fred Greenwood was not
among the living, his unrelenting enemy was likely to give some
evidence of where his taking off had occurred. Hazletine's belief,
therefore, was that by shadowing the Sioux he had a good chance
of securing the information that would overturn all the calculations
of the abductors.</p>

<p>But this task was tenfold more delicate than would seem at first,
for not only had the cowman to learn the whereabouts of the Sioux,
but he must do it undetected and dog the fellow without discovery
on his part. When it is remembered that Motoza would be on the
alert against this, one is almost ready to declare the cowman
had attempted an impossible thing.</p>

<p>When he left his young friend, however, it was with the firm
purpose of doing, or rather trying to push through this purpose.
Within a hundred yards of the point where he left Jack the guide
had a glimpse of what may be called the shadow of a movement.
Something flickered among the rocks a short distance ahead and
then vanished before he could identify it.</p>

<p>But he knew what it meant. Some one was watching him. If the
watcher was not Motoza or Tozer, he was an ally of theirs. He
was holding the cowman under surveillance, ready to report or
shoot on the first proof of his real purpose. The truth flashed
upon Hank, and pausing in his walk, without any evidence of what
he had discovered, he began a hasty examination of his pockets
after the manner of a man who suddenly misses some prized article
that he believed to be in his garments.</p>

<p>The little farce was cleverly acted. Each receptacle was examined
several times, some of the pockets being turned wrong side out,
while the face of the cowman, or rather his eyes, betrayed his
excitement. Then he looked at the ground in front and at the rear,
apparently to learn whether he had dropped the missing treasure.
Failing to find it, he uttered an angry exclamation and walked
hurriedly back to his companion. No one observing the performance
would have doubted its meaning.</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay a while with you," he remarked, seating himself
upon the ground and lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>"It was a sudden change of mind," replied Jack, glad to have
his company.</p>

<p>"Yes; a redskin helped me to make it," and he explained the nature
of his discovery. Inasmuch as the guide had turned back because
of the same, it was easy to understand what his original intention
was; for had it not existed, why should the cowman care if he
was kept under surveillance? He would not be betraying himself
any more during an innocent walk and hunt through the mountains
than by sitting on the ground and smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>The result to a certain extent was a disappointment to Jack himself,
for he had quietly resolved upon a venture in the same line. Of
necessity he would be governed almost entirely by guesswork, but
it was his determination to spend the day, and if possible the
night, in trying to gather some trace of his missing friend. And
while it must be said that his prospect of success was exceedingly
meagre, it should be borne in mind that he would possess one great
advantage over the veteran while similarly engaged&mdash;neither Tozer
nor Motoza would fear anything from what he did, and would give
him no attention. He therefore would be left comparatively free
to do what he chose. Despite the warnings of Hank, Jack was confident
nothing was to be feared from the enmity of the two miscreants
while the negotiations were in progress. They were not the men
to destroy the hen that was expected to lay the golden egg.</p>

<p>For hours Hazletine and Jack lolled in this primitive camp, the
cowman smoking his pipe most of the time, while the two discussed
over and over again the various phases of the momentous business
that engaged their thoughts and to which they yearned to devote
their utmost energies. The guide longed to be off, and as the
sun descended the heavens it was one of the hardest tasks of his
life to restrain his impatience, but he had been trained in a
school where patience is one of the greatest of all the virtues.
Suddenly he rose to his feet, stretched his arms and yawned.</p>

<p>"I'd like to borrer that spy-glass of yours fur a few minutes."</p>

<p>"You are welcome," replied Jack, slipping the string over his
head and passing the instrument to him. The cowman sauntered off,
taking the same direction as before. His first wish was to learn
whether he was still under surveillance. So far as he could determine
the watcher had grown weary and withdrawn, though there could
be no certainty that he was not in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Jack Dudley, without leaving camp, was able to keep an eye on
the movements of his friend. He saw him make his way to a jutting
rock, partly screened by a growth of cedar. Concealing himself
as well as he could, he raised the glass to his eyes and spent
several minutes in studying the wild country spread below him.
He was looking in the direction of the break in the canyon, beyond
which, as will be remembered, was the plateau where the ponies
had been left to crop the grass while their masters were engaged
elsewhere.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He was looking in the direction of the break
in the canyon."]</p>

<p>Jack did not attempt to survey the same field, but kept his gaze
upon Hazletine. He could see that he directed his attention toward
a particular point, as if he had either discovered something or
expected to do so. The study continued only a few minutes, when
he came back and handed the glass to the youth, with the remark:</p>

<p>"I'm going to try it agin. I won't expect to see you till to-morrer
morning."</p>

<p>The lad bade him good-by, and he took his departure; but instead
of descending the mountain toward the point that had interested
him, he followed the opposite course, as if he intended to push
through to the other side of the Wind River range. This was so
transparent a subterfuge that it did not deceive Jack.</p>

<p>"He has discovered something," was his conclusion; "he doesn't
choose to tell me, and it makes little difference. I wonder whether
he believes I intend to idle my time till night and then go back
to headquarters and wait for him? If he thinks so, he makes a
mistake."</p>

<p>Waiting until sure his friend was beyond sight, Jack carefully
picked his way to the rock from which Hank had made the observation
that decided his line of action. The better to screen himself
the youth lay down on his face, as when peering over the ridge
into the valley where the antelope were grazing, and held the
glass to his eyes.</p>

<p>Thus looking out, he saw the plateau in the distance, seemingly
but a few rods in extent. Only one of the ponies was visible,
and he resembled a small dog, standing with head down, in the
middle of the grassy plot. Beyond and between were foot-hills,
peaks of varying heights, gorges, ravines and hollows, with rocks,
boulders and stunted trees scattered in profusion. The picturesqueness
of the scene was deepened by a thin, blue column of vapor in the
distance, ascending from an invisible camp-fire. The smoke rose
steadily, so it was not to be supposed that it was meant for a
signal, like those already described.</p>

<p>The most attractive point was the break in the canyon, already
described. This was in plain sight, with the expanse of swiftly-flowing
water, which soon disappeared between the walls on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack started. Two Indians were visible, though they
were in view for only a few minutes. They came from the base of
the incline where the boys had seen three of them the day before,
and passed out of sight before the interested observer could decide
whether Motoza, the Sioux, was one of them.</p>

<p>"I believe Hank has gone down there," was the conclusion of Jack,
"and I shall do the same."</p>
