<p>Never populous, it was yet by a chapter of accidents that I found the
island so deserted that no sound of human life diversified the hours;
that we walked in that trim public garden of a town, among closed houses,
without even a lodging-bill in a window to prove some tenancy in the back
quarters; and, when we visited the Government bungalow, that Mr. Donat,
acting Vice-Resident, greeted us alone, and entertained us with cocoa-nut
punches in the Sessions Hall and seat of judgment of that widespread
archipelago, our glasses standing arrayed with summonses and census
returns.  The unpopularity of a late Vice-Resident had begun the movement
of exodus, his native employés resigning court appointments and retiring
each to his own coco-patch in the remoter districts of the isle.  Upon
the back of that, the Governor in Papeete issued a decree: All land in
the Paumotus must be defined and registered by a certain date.  Now, the
folk of the archipelago are half nomadic; a man can scarce be said to
belong to a particular atoll; he belongs to several, perhaps holds a
stake and counts cousinship in half a score; and the inhabitants of
Rotoava in particular, man, woman, and child, and from the gendarme to
the Mormon prophet and the schoolmaster, owned—I was going to say
land—owned at least coral blocks and growing coco-palms in some adjacent
isle.  Thither—from the gendarme to the babe in arms, the pastor followed
by his flock, the schoolmaster carrying along with him his scholars, and
the scholars with their books and slates—they had taken ship some two
days previous to our arrival, and were all now engaged disputing
boundaries.  Fancy overhears the shrillness of their disputation mingle
with the surf and scatter sea-fowl.  It was admirable to observe the
completeness of their flight, like that of hibernating birds; nothing
left but empty houses, like old nests to be reoccupied in spring; and
even the harmless necessary dominie borne with them in their
transmigration.  Fifty odd set out, and only seven, I was informed,
remained.  But when I made a feast on board the <u>Casco</u>, more than seven,
and nearer seven times seven, appeared to be my guests.  Whence they
appeared, how they were summoned, whither they vanished when the feast
was eaten, I have no guess.  In view of Low Island tales, and that awful
frequentation which makes men avoid the seaward beaches of an atoll, some
two score of those that ate with us may have returned, for the occasion,
from the kingdom of the dead.
</p>
<p>It was this solitude that put it in our minds to hire a house, and
become, for the time being, indwellers of the isle—a practice I have ever
since, when it was possible, adhered to.  Mr. Donat placed us, with that
intent, under the convoy of one Taniera Mahinui, who combined the
incongruous characters of catechist and convict.  The reader may smile,
but I affirm he was well qualified for either part.  For that of convict,
first of all, by a good substantial felony, such as in all lands casts
the perpetrator in chains and dungeons.  Taniera was a man of birth—the
chief a while ago, as he loved to tell, of a district in Anaa of 800
souls.  In an evil hour it occurred to the authorities in Papeete to
charge the chiefs with the collection of the taxes.  It is a question if
much were collected; it is certain that nothing was handed on; and
Taniera, who had distinguished himself by a visit to Papeete and some
high living in restaurants, was chosen for the scapegoat.  The reader
must understand that not Taniera but the authorities in Papeete were
first in fault.  The charge imposed was disproportioned.  I have not yet
heard of any Polynesian capable of such a burden; honest and upright
Hawaiians—one in particular, who was admired even by the whites as an
inflexible magistrate—have stumbled in the narrow path of the trustee.
And Taniera, when the pinch came, scorned to denounce accomplices; others
had shared the spoil, he bore the penalty alone.  He was condemned in
five years.  The period, when I had the pleasure of his friendship, was
not yet expired; he still drew prison rations, the sole and not unwelcome
reminder of his chains, and, I believe, looked forward to the date of his
enfranchisement with mere alarm.  For he had no sense of shame in the
position; complained of nothing but the defective table of his place of
exile; regretted nothing but the fowls and eggs and fish of his own more
favoured island.  And as for his parishioners, they did not think one
hair the less of him.  A schoolboy, mulcted in ten thousand lines of
Greek and dwelling sequestered in the dormitories, enjoys unabated
consideration from his fellows.  So with Taniera: a marked man, not a
dishonoured; having fallen under the lash of the unthinkable gods; a Job,
perhaps, or say a Taniera in the den of lions.  Songs are likely made and
sung about this saintly Robin Hood.  On the other hand, he was even
highly qualified for his office in the Church; being by nature a grave,
considerate, and kindly man; his face rugged and serious, his smile
bright; the master of several trades, a builder both of boats and houses;
endowed with a fine pulpit voice; endowed besides with such a gift of
eloquence that at the grave of the late chief of Fakarava he set all the
assistants weeping.  I never met a man of a mind more ecclesiastical; he
loved to dispute and to inform himself of doctrine and the history of
sects; and when I showed him the cuts in a volume of Chambers’s
<u>Encyclopædia</u>—except for one of an ape—reserved his whole enthusiasm for
cardinals’ hats, censers, candlesticks, and cathedrals.  Methought when
he looked upon the cardinal’s hat a voice said low in his ear: ‘Your foot
is on the ladder.’
</p><p>Under the guidance of Taniera we were soon installed in what I believe to
have been the best-appointed private house in Fakarava.  It stood just
beyond the church in an oblong patch of cultivation.  More than three
hundred sacks of soil were imported from Tahiti for the Residency garden;
and this must shortly be renewed, for the earth blows away, sinks in
crevices of the coral, and is sought for at last in vain.  I know not how
much earth had gone to the garden of my villa; some at least, for an
alley of prosperous bananas ran to the gate, and over the rest of the
enclosure, which was covered with the usual clinker-like fragments of
smashed coral, not only coco-palms and mikis but also fig-trees
flourished, all of a delicious greenness.  Of course there was no blade
of grass.  In front a picket fence divided us from the white road, the
palm-fringed margin of the lagoon, and the lagoon itself, reflecting
clouds by day and stars by night.  At the back, a bulwark of uncemented
coral enclosed us from the narrow belt of bush and the nigh ocean beach
where the seas thundered, the roar and wash of them still humming in the
chambers of the house.
</p><p>This itself was of one story, verandahed front and back.  It contained
three rooms, three sewing-machines, three sea-chests, chairs, tables, a
pair of beds, a cradle, a double-barrelled gun, a pair of enlarged
coloured photographs, a pair of coloured prints after Wilkie and
Mulready, and a French lithograph with the legend: ‘<u>Le brigade du
Général Lepasset brûlant son drapeau devant Metz</u>.’  Under the stilts of
the house a stove was rusting, till we drew it forth and put it in
commission.  Not far off was the burrow in the coral whence we supplied
ourselves with brackish water.  There was live stock, besides, on the
estate—cocks and hens and a brace of ill-regulated cats, whom Taniera
came every morning with the sun to feed on grated cocoa-nut.  His voice
was our regular réveille, ringing pleasantly about the garden:
‘Pooty—pooty—poo—poo—poo!’
</p><p>Far as we were from the public offices, the nearness of the chapel made
our situation what is called eligible in advertisements, and gave us a
side look on some native life.  Every morning, as soon as he had fed the
fowls, Taniera set the bell agoing in the small belfry; and the faithful,
who were not very numerous, gathered to prayers.  I was once present: it
was the Lord’s day, and seven females and eight males composed the
congregation.  A woman played precentor, starting with a longish note;
the catechist joined in upon the second bar; and then the faithful in a
body.  Some had printed hymn-books which they followed; some of the rest
filled up with ‘eh—eh—eh,’ the Paumotuan tol-de-rol.  After the hymn, we
had an antiphonal prayer or two; and then Taniera rose from the front
bench, where he had been sitting in his catechist’s robes, passed within
the altar-rails, opened his Tahitian Bible, and began to preach from
notes.  I understood one word—the name of God; but the preacher managed
his voice with taste, used rare and expressive gestures, and made a
strong impression of sincerity.  The plain service, the vernacular Bible,
the hymn-tunes mostly on an English pattern—‘God save the Queen,’ I was
informed, a special favourite,—all, save some paper flowers upon the
altar, seemed not merely but austerely Protestant.  It is thus the
Catholics have met their low island proselytes half-way.
</p><p>Taniera had the keys of our house; it was with him I made my bargain, if
that could be called a bargain in which all was remitted to my
generosity; it was he who fed the cats and poultry, he who came to call
and pick a meal with us like an acknowledged friend; and we long fondly
supposed he was our landlord.  This belief was not to bear the test of
experience; and, as my chapter has to relate, no certainty succeeded it.
</p><p>We passed some days of airless quiet and great heat; shell-gatherers were
warned from the ocean beach, where sunstroke waited them from ten till
four; the highest palm hung motionless, there was no voice audible but
that of the sea on the far side.  At last, about four of a certain
afternoon, long cat’s-paws flawed the face of the lagoon; and presently
in the tree-tops there awoke the grateful bustle of the trades, and all
the houses and alleys of the island were fanned out.  To more than one
enchanted ship, that had lain long becalmed in view of the green shore,
the wind brought deliverance; and by daylight on the morrow a schooner
and two cutters lay moored in the port of Rotoava.  Not only in the outer
sea, but in the lagoon itself, a certain traffic woke with the reviving
breeze; and among the rest one François, a half-blood, set sail with the
first light in his own half-decked cutter.  He had held before a court
appointment; being, I believe, the Residency sweeper-out.  Trouble
arising with the unpopular Vice-Resident, he had thrown his honours down,
and fled to the far parts of the atoll to plant cabbages—or at least
coco-palms.  Thence he was now driven by such need as even a Cincinnatus
must acknowledge, and fared for the capital city, the seat of his late
functions, to exchange half a ton of copra for necessary flour.  And
here, for a while, the story leaves to tell of his voyaging.
</p><p>It must tell, instead, of our house, where, toward seven at night, the
catechist came suddenly in with his pleased air of being welcome; armed
besides with a considerable bunch of keys.  These he proceeded to try on
the sea-chests, drawing each in turn from its place against the wall.
Heads of strangers appeared in the doorway and volunteered suggestions.
All in vain.  Either they were the wrong keys or the wrong boxes, or the
wrong man was trying them.  For a little Taniera fumed and fretted; then
had recourse to the more summary method of the hatchet; one of the chests
was broken open, and an armful of clothing, male and female, baled out
and handed to the strangers on the verandah.
</p><p>These were François, his wife, and their child.  About eight a.m., in the
midst of the lagoon, their cutter had capsized in jibbing.  They got her
righted, and though she was still full of water put the child on board.
The mainsail had been carried away, but the jib still drew her sluggishly
along, and François and the woman swam astern and worked the rudder with
their hands.  The cold was cruel; the fatigue, as time went on, became
excessive; and in that preserve of sharks, fear hunted them.  Again and
again, François, the half-breed, would have desisted and gone down; but
the woman, whole blood of an amphibious race, still supported him with
cheerful words.  I am reminded of a woman of Hawaii who swam with her
husband, I dare not say how many miles, in a high sea, and came ashore at
last with his dead body in her arms.  It was about five in the evening,
after nine hours’ swimming, that François and his wife reached land at
Rotoava.  The gallant fight was won, and instantly the more childish side
of native character appears.  They had supped, and told and retold their
story, dripping as they came; the flesh of the woman, whom Mrs. Stevenson
helped to shift, was cold as stone; and François, having changed to a dry
cotton shirt and trousers, passed the remainder of the evening on my
floor and between open doorways, in a thorough draught.  Yet François,
the son of a French father, speaks excellent French himself and seems
intelligent.
</p><p>It was our first idea that the catechist, true to his evangelical
vocation, was clothing the naked from his superfluity.  Then it came out
that François was but dealing with his own.  The clothes were his, so was
the chest, so was the house.  François was in fact the landlord.  Yet you
observe he had hung back on the verandah while Taniera tried his
’prentice hand upon the locks: and even now, when his true character
appeared, the only use he made of the estate was to leave the clothes of
his family drying on the fence.  Taniera was still the friend of the
house, still fed the poultry, still came about us on his daily visits,
François, during the remainder of his stay, holding bashfully aloof.  And
there was stranger matter.  Since François had lost the whole load of his
cutter, the half ton of copra, an axe, bowls, knives, and clothes—since
he had in a manner to begin the world again, and his necessary flour was
not yet bought or paid for—I proposed to advance him what he needed on
the rent.  To my enduring amazement he refused, and the reason he gave—if
that can be called a reason which but darkens counsel—was that Taniera
was his friend.  His friend, you observe; not his creditor.  I inquired
into that, and was assured that Taniera, an exile in a strange isle,
might possibly be in debt himself, but certainly was no man’s creditor.
</p><p>Very early one morning we were awakened by a bustling presence in the
yard, and found our camp had been surprised by a tall, lean old native
lady, dressed in what were obviously widow’s weeds.  You could see at a
glance she was a notable woman, a housewife, sternly practical, alive
with energy, and with fine possibilities of temper.  Indeed, there was
nothing native about her but the skin; and the type abounds, and is
everywhere respected, nearer home.  It did us good to see her scour the
grounds, examining the plants and chickens; watering, feeding, trimming
them; taking angry, purpose-like possession.  When she neared the house
our sympathy abated; when she came to the broken chest I wished I were
elsewhere.  We had scarce a word in common; but her whole lean body spoke
for her with indignant eloquence.  ‘My chest!’ it cried, with a stress on
the possessive.  ‘My chest—broken open!  This is a fine state of things!’
I hastened to lay the blame where it belonged—on François and his
wife—and found I had made things worse instead of better.  She repeated
the names at first with incredulity, then with despair.  A while she
seemed stunned, next fell to disembowelling the box, piling the goods on
the floor, and visibly computing the extent of François’s ravages; and
presently after she was observed in high speech with Taniera, who seemed
to hang an ear like one reproved.
</p><p>Here, then, by all known marks, should be my land-lady at last; here was
every character of the proprietor fully developed.  Should I not approach
her on the still depending question of my rent?  I carried the point to
an adviser.  ‘Nonsense!’ he cried.  ‘That’s the old woman, the mother.
It doesn’t belong to her.  I believe that’s the man the house belongs
to,’ and he pointed to one of the coloured photographs on the wall.  On
this I gave up all desire of understanding; and when the time came for me
to leave, in the judgment-hall of the archipelago, and with the awful
countenance of the acting Governor, I duly paid my rent to Taniera.  He
was satisfied, and so was I.  But what had he to do with it?  Mr. Donat,
acting magistrate and a man of kindred blood, could throw no light upon
the mystery; a plain private person, with a taste for letters, cannot be
expected to do more.
