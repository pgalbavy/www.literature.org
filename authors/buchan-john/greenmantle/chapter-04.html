<p>The Germans, as Peter said, are a careful people. A man met us
on the quay at Rotterdam. I was a bit afraid that something might
have turned up in Lisbon to discredit us, and that our little
friend might have warned his pals by telegram. But apparently
all was serene.</p>

<p>Peter and I had made our plans pretty carefully on the voyage.
We had talked nothing but Dutch, and had kept up between ourselves
the role of Maritz’s men, which Peter said was the only way to
play a part well. Upon my soul, before we got to Holland I was
not very clear in my own mind what my past had been. Indeed the
danger was that the other side of my mind, which should be busy
with the great problem, would get atrophied, and that I should
soon be mentally on a par with the ordinary backveld desperado.</p>

<p>We had agreed that it would be best to get into Germany at once,
and when the agent on the quay told us of a train at midday we
decided to take it.</p>

<p>I had another fit of cold feet before we got over the frontier.
At the station there was a King’s Messenger whom I had seen in
France, and a war correspondent who had been trotting round our
part of the front before Loos. I heard a woman speaking pretty
clean-cut English, which amid the hoarse Dutch jabber sounded
like a lark among crows. There were copies of the English papers
for sale, and English cheap editions. I felt pretty bad about
the whole business, and wondered if I should ever see these homely
sights again.</p>

<p>But the mood passed when the train started. It was a clear blowing
day, and as we crawled through the flat pastures of Holland my
time was taken up answering Peter’s questions. He had never been
in Europe before, and formed a high opinion of the farming. He
said he reckoned that such land would carry four sheep a morgen.
We were thick in talk when we reached the frontier station and
jolted over a canal bridge into Germany.</p>

<p>I had expected a big barricade with barbed wire and entrenchments.
But there was nothing to see on the German side but half a dozen
sentries in the field-grey I had hunted at Loos. An under-officer,
with the black-and-gold button of the Landsturm, hoicked us out
of the train, and we were all shepherded into a big bare waiting-room
where a large stove burned. They took us two at a time into an
inner room for examination. I had explained to Peter all about
this formality, but I was glad we went in together, for they made
us strip to the skin, and I had to curse him pretty seriously
to make him keep quiet. The men who did the job were fairly civil,
but they were mighty thorough. They took down a list of all we
had in our pockets and bags, and all the details from the passports
the Rotterdam agent had given us.</p>

<p>We were dressing when a man in a lieutenant’s uniform came in
with a paper in his hand. He was a fresh-faced lad of about twenty,
with short-sighted spectacled eyes.</p>

<p>"Herr Brandt," he called out.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"And this is Herr Pienaar?" he asked in Dutch.</p>

<p>He saluted. "Gentlemen, I apologize. I am late because of the
slowness of the Herr Commandant’s motor-car. Had I been in time
you would not have been required to go through this ceremony.
We have been advised of your coming, and I am instructed to attend
you on your journey. The train for Berlin leaves in half an hour.
Pray do me the honour to join me in a bock."</p>

<p>With a feeling of distinction we stalked out of the ordinary
ruck of passengers and followed the lieutenant to the station
restaurant. He plunged at once into conversation, talking the
Dutch of Holland, which Peter, who had forgotten his school-days,
found a bit hard to follow. He was unfit for active service, because
of his eyes and a weak heart, but he was a desperate fire-eater
in that stuffy restaurant. By his way of it Germany could gobble
up the French and the Russians whenever she cared, but she was
aiming at getting all the Middle East in her hands first, so that
she could come out conqueror with the practical control of half
the world.</p>

<p>"Your friends the English," he said grinning, "will come last.
When we have starved them and destroyed their commerce with our
under-sea boats we will show them what our navy can do. For a
year they have been wasting their time in brag and politics, and
we have been building great ships—oh, so many! My cousin at Kiel—"
and he looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>But we never heard about that cousin at Kiel. A short sunburnt
man came in and our friend sprang up and saluted, clicking his
heels like a pair of tongs.</p>

<p>"These are the South African Dutch, Herr Captain," he said.</p>

<p>The new-comer looked us over with bright intelligent eyes, and
started questioning Peter in the taal. It was well that we had
taken some pains with our story, for this man had been years in
German South West, and knew every mile of the borders. Zorn was
his name, and both Peter and I thought we remembered hearing him
spoken of.</p>

<p>I am thankful to say that we both showed up pretty well. Peter
told his story to perfection, not pitching it too high, and asking
me now and then for a name or to verify some detail. Captain Zorn
looked satisfied.</p>

<p>"You seem the right kind of fellows," he said. "But remember"—and
he bent his brows on us—"we do not understand slimness in this
land. If you are honest you will be rewarded, but if you dare
to play a double game you will be shot like dogs. Your race has
produced over many traitors for my taste."</p>

<p>"I ask no reward," I said gruffly. "We are not Germans or Germany’s
slaves. But so long as she fights against England we will fight
for her."</p>

<p>"Bold words," he said; "but you must bow your stiff necks to
discipline first. Discipline has been the weak point of you Boers,
and you have suffered for it. You are no more a nation. In Germany
we put discipline first and last, and therefore we will conquer
the world. Off with you now. Your train starts in three minutes.
We will see what von Stumm will make of you."</p>

<p>That fellow gave me the best "feel" of any German I had yet met.
He was a white man and I could have worked with him. I liked his
stiff chin and steady blue eyes.</p>

<p>My chief recollection of our journey to Berlin was its commonplaceness.
The spectacled lieutenant fell asleep, and for the most part we
had the carriage to ourselves. Now and again a soldier on leave
would drop in, most of them tired men with heavy eyes. No wonder,
poor devils, for they were coming back from the Yser or the Ypres
salient. I would have liked to talk to them, but officially of
course I knew no German, and the conversation I overheard did
not signify much. It was mostly about regimental details, though
one chap, who was in better spirits than the rest, observed that
this was the last Christmas of misery, and that next year he would
be holidaying at home with full pockets. The others assented,
but without much conviction.</p>

<p>The winter day was short, and most of the journey was made in
the dark. I could see from the window the lights of little villages,
and now and then the blaze of ironworks and forges. We stopped
at a town for dinner, where the platform was crowded with drafts
waiting to go westward. We saw no signs of any scarcity of food,
such as the English newspapers wrote about. We had an excellent
dinner at the station restaurant, which, with a bottle of white
wine, cost just three shillings apiece. The bread, to be sure,
was poor, but I can put up with the absence of bread if I get
a juicy fillet of beef and as good vegetables as you will see
in the Savoy.</p>

<p>I was a little afraid of our giving ourselves away in our sleep,
but I need have had no fear, for our escort slumbered like a hog
with his mouth wide open. As we roared through the darkness I
kept pinching myself to make myself feel that I was in the enemy’s
land on a wild mission. The rain came on, and we passed through
dripping towns, with the lights shining from the wet streets.
As we went eastward the lighting seemed to grow more generous.
After the murk of London it was queer to slip through garish stations
with a hundred arc lights glowing, and to see long lines of lamps
running to the horizon. Peter dropped off early, but I kept awake
till midnight, trying to focus thoughts that persistently strayed.
Then I, too, dozed and did not awake till about five in the morning,
when we ran into a great busy terminus as bright as midday. It
was the easiest and most unsuspicious journey I ever made.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stretched himself and smoothed his rumpled uniform.
We carried our scanty luggage to a <em>droschke</em>, for there
seemed to be no porters. Our escort gave the address of some hotel
and we rumbled out into brightly lit empty streets.</p>

<p>"A mighty dorp," said Peter. "Of a truth the Germans are a great
people."</p>

<p>The lieutenant nodded good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"The greatest people on earth," he said, "as their enemies will
soon bear witness."</p>

<p>I would have given a lot for a bath, but I felt that it would
be outside my part, and Peter was not of the washing persuasion.
But we had a very good breakfast of coffee and eggs, and then
the lieutenant started on the telephone. He began by being dictatorial,
then he seemed to be switched on to higher authorities, for he
grew more polite, and at the end he fairly crawled. He made some
arrangements, for he informed us that in the afternoon we would
see some fellow whose title he could not translate into Dutch.
I judged he was a great swell, for his voice became reverential
at the mention of him.</p>

<p>He took us for a walk that morning after Peter and I had attended
to our toilets. We were an odd pair of scallywags to look at,
but as South African as a wait-a-bit bush. Both of us had ready-made
tweed suits, grey flannel shirts with flannel collars, and felt
hats with broader brims than they like in Europe. I had strong-nailed
brown boots, Peter a pair of those mustard-coloured abominations
which the Portuguese affect and which made him hobble like a Chinese
lady. He had a scarlet satin tie which you could hear a mile off.
My beard had grown to quite a respectable length, and I trimmed
it like General Smuts’. Peter’s was the kind of loose flapping
thing the <em>taakhaar</em> loves, which has scarcely ever been
shaved, and is combed once in a blue moon. I must say we made
a pretty solid pair. Any South African would have set us down
as a Boer from the back-veld who had bought a suit of clothes
in the nearest store, and his cousin from some one-horse dorp
who had been to school and thought himself the devil of a fellow.
We fairly reeked of the sub-continent, as the papers call it.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning after the rain, and we wandered about in
the streets for a couple of hours. They were busy enough, and
the shops looked rich and bright with their Christmas goods, and
one big store where I went to buy a pocket-knife was packed with
customers. One didn’t see very many young men, and most of the
women wore mourning. Uniforms were everywhere, but their wearers
generally looked like dug-outs or office fellows. We had a glimpse
of the squat building which housed the General Staff and took
off our hats to it. Then we stared at the Marinamt, and I wondered
what plots were hatching there behind old Tirpitz’s whiskers.
The capital gave one an impression of ugly cleanness and a sort
of dreary effectiveness. And yet I found it depressing—more depressing
than London. I don’t know how to put it, but the whole big concern
seemed to have no soul in it, to be like a big factory instead
of a city. You won’t make a factory look like a house, though
you decorate its front and plant rose-bushes all round it. The
place depressed and yet cheered me. It somehow made the German
people seem smaller.</p>

<p>At three o’clock the lieutenant took us to a plain white building
in a side street with sentries at the door. A young staff officer
met us and made us wait for five minutes in an ante-room. Then
we were ushered into a big room with a polished floor on which
Peter nearly sat down. There was a log fire burning, and seated
at a table was a little man in spectacles with his hair brushed
back from his brow like a popular violinist. He was the boss,
for the lieutenant saluted him and announced our names. Then he
disappeared, and the man at the table motioned us to sit down
in two chairs before him.</p>

<p>"Herr Brandt and Herr Pienaar?" he asked, looking over his glasses.</p>

<p>But it was the other man that caught my eye. He stood with his
back to the fire leaning his elbows on the mantelpiece. He was
a perfect mountain of a fellow, six and a half feet if he was
an inch, with shoulders on him like a shorthorn bull. He was in
uniform and the black-and-white ribbon of the Iron Cross showed
at a buttonhole. His tunic was all wrinkled and strained as if
it could scarcely contain his huge chest, and mighty hands were
clasped over his stomach. That man must have had the length of
reach of a gorilla. He had a great, lazy, smiling face, with a
square cleft chin which stuck out beyond the rest. His brow retreated
and the stubby back of his head ran forward to meet it, while
his neck below bulged out over his collar. His head was exactly
the shape of a pear with the sharp end topmost.</p>

<p>He stared at me with his small bright eyes and I stared back.
I had struck something I had been looking for for a long time,
and till that moment I wasn’t sure that it existed. Here was the
German of caricature, the real German, the fellow we were up against.
He was as hideous as a hippopotamus, but effective. Every bristle
on his odd head was effective.</p>

<p>The man at the table was speaking. I took him to be a civilian
official of sorts, pretty high up from his surroundings, perhaps
an Under-Secretary. His Dutch was slow and careful, but good—too
good for Peter. He had a paper before him and was asking us questions
from it. They did not amount to much, being pretty well a repetition
of those Zorn had asked us at the frontier. I answered fluently,
for I had all our lies by heart.</p>

<p>Then the man on the hearthrug broke in. "I’ll talk to them, Excellency,"
he said in German. "You are too academic for those outland swine."</p>

<p>He began in the <em>taal</em>, with the thick guttural accent
that you get in German South West. "You have heard of me," he
said. "I am the Colonel von Stumm who fought the Hereros."</p>

<p>Peter pricked up his ears. "<em>Ja</em>, Baas, you cut off the
chief Baviaan’s head and sent it in pickle about the country.
I have seen it."</p>

<p>The big man laughed. "You see I am not forgotten," he said to
his friend, and then to us: "So I treat my enemies, and so will
Germany treat hers. You, too, if you fail me by a fraction of
an inch." And he laughed loud again.</p>

<p>There was something horrible in that boisterousness. Peter was
watching him from below his eyelids, as I have seen him watch
a lion about to charge.</p>

<p>He flung himself on a chair, put his elbows on the table, and
thrust his face forward.</p>

<p>"You have come from a damned muddled show. If I had Maritz in
my power I would have him flogged at a wagon’s end. Fools and
pig-dogs, they had the game in their hands and they flung it away.
We could have raised a fire that would have burned the English
into the sea, and for lack of fuel they let it die down. Then
they try to fan it when the ashes are cold."</p>

<p>He rolled a paper pellet and flicked it into the air. "That is
what I think of your idiot general," he said, "and of all you
Dutch. As slow as a fat vrouw and as greedy as an aasvogel."</p>

<p>We looked very glum and sullen.</p>

<p>"A pair of dumb dogs," he cried. "A thousand Brandenburgers would
have won in a fortnight. Seitz hadn’t much to boast of, mostly
clerks and farmers and half-castes, and no soldier worth the name
to lead them, but it took Botha and Smuts and a dozen generals
to hunt him down. But Maritz!" His scorn came like a gust of wind.</p>

<p>"Maritz did all the fighting there was," said Peter sulkily.
"At any rate he wasn’t afraid of the sight of the khaki like your
lot."</p>

<p>"Maybe he wasn’t," said the giant in a cooing voice; "maybe he
had his reasons for that. You Dutchmen have always a feather-bed
to fall on. You can always turn traitor. Maritz now calls himself
Robinson, and has a pension from his friend Botha."</p>

<p>"That," said Peter, "is a very damned lie."</p>

<p>"I asked for information," said Stumm with a sudden politeness.
"But that is all past and done with. Maritz matters no more than
your old Cronjes and Krugers. The show is over, and you are looking
for safety. For a new master perhaps? But, man, what can you bring?
What can you offer? You and your Dutch are lying in the dust with
the yoke on your necks. The Pretoria lawyers have talked you round.
You see that map," and he pointed to a big one on the wall. "South
Africa is coloured green. Not red for the English, or yellow for
the Germans. Some day it will be yellow, but for a little it will
be green—the colour of neutrals, of nothings, of boys and young
ladies and chicken-hearts."</p>

<p>I kept wondering what he was playing at.</p>

<p>Then he fixed his eyes on Peter. "What do you come here for?
The game’s up in your own country. What can you offer us Germans?
If we gave you ten million marks and sent you back you could do
nothing. Stir up a village row, perhaps, and shoot a policeman.
South Africa is counted out in this war. Botha is a cleverish
man and has beaten you calves’-heads of rebels. Can you deny it?"</p>

<p>Peter couldn’t. He was terribly honest in some things, and these
were for certain his opinions.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "that is true, Baas."</p>

<p>"Then what in God’s name can you do?" shouted Stumm.</p>

<p>Peter mumbled some foolishness about nobbling Angola for Germany
and starting a revolution among the natives. Stumm flung up his
arms and cursed, and the Under-Secretary laughed.</p>

<p>It was high time for me to chip in. I was beginning to see the
kind of fellow this Stumm was, and as he talked I thought of my
mission, which had got overlaid by my Boer past. It looked as
if he might be useful.</p>

<p>"Let me speak," I said. "My friend is a great hunter, but he
fights better than he talks. He is no politician. You speak truth.
South Africa is a closed door for the present, and the key to
it is elsewhere. Here in Europe, and in the east, and in other
parts of Africa. We have come to help you to find the key."</p>

<p>Stumm was listening. "Go on, my little Boer. It will be a new
thing to hear a <em>taakhaar</em> on world-politics."</p>

<p>"You are fighting," I said, "in East Africa; and soon you may
fight in Egypt. All the east coast north of the Zambesi will be
your battle-ground. The English run about the world with little
expeditions. I do not know where the places are, though I read
of them in the papers. But I know my Africa. You want to beat
them here in Europe and on the seas. Therefore, like wise generals,
you try to divide them and have them scattered throughout the
globe while you stick at home. That is your plan?"</p>

<p>"A second Falkenhayn," said Stumm, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, England will not let East Africa go. She fears for Egypt
and she fears, too, for India. If you press her there she will
send armies and more armies till she is so weak in Europe that
a child can crush her. That is England’s way. She cares more for
her Empire than for what may happen to her allies. So I say press
and still press there, destroy the railway to the Lakes, burn
her capital, pen up every Englishman in Mombasa island. At this
moment it is worth for you a thousand Damaralands."</p>

<p>The man was really interested and the Under-Secretary, too, pricked
up his ears.</p>

<p>"We can keep our territory," said the former; "but as for pressing,
how the devil are we to press? The accursed English hold the sea.
We cannot ship men or guns there. South are the Portuguese and
west the Belgians. You cannot move a mass without a lever."</p>

<p>"The lever is there, ready for you," I said.</p>

<p>"Then for God’s sake show it me," he cried.</p>

<p>I looked at the door to see that it was shut, as if what I had
to say was very secret.</p>

<p>"You need men, and the men are waiting. They are black, but they
are the stuff of warriors. All round your borders you have the
remains of great fighting tribes, the Angoni, the Masai, the Manyumwezi,
and above all the Somalis of the north, and the dwellers on the
upper Nile. The British recruit their black regiments there, and
so do you. But to get recruits is not enough. You must set whole
nations moving, as the Zulu under Tchaka flowed over South Africa."</p>

<p>"It cannot be done," said the Under-Secretary.</p>

<p>"It can be done," I said quietly. "We two are here to do it."</p>

<p>This kind of talk was jolly difficult for me, chiefly because
of Stumm’s asides in German to the official. I had, above all
things, to get the credit of knowing no German, and, if you understand
a language well, it is not very easy when you are interrupted
not to show that you know it, either by a direct answer, or by
referring to the interruption in what you say next. I had to be
always on my guard, and yet it was up to me to be very persuasive
and convince these fellows that I would be useful. Somehow or
other I had to get into their confidence.</p>

<p>"I have been for years up and down in Africa—Uganda and the Congo
and the Upper Nile. I know the ways of the Kaffir as no Englishman
does. We Afrikanders see into the black man’s heart, and though
he may hate us he does our will. You Germans are like the English;
you are too big folk to understand plain men. ‘Civilize,’ you
cry. ‘Educate,’ say the English. The black man obeys and puts
away his gods, but he worships them all the time in his soul.
We must get his gods on our side, and then he will move mountains.
We must do as John Laputa did with Sheba’s necklace."</p>

<p>"That’s all in the air," said Stumm, but he did not laugh.</p>

<p>"It is sober common sense," I said. "But you must begin at the
right end. First find the race that fears its priests. It is waiting
for you—the Mussulmans of Somaliland and the Abyssinian border
and the Blue and White Nile. They would be like dried grasses
to catch fire if you used the flint and steel of their religion.
Look what the English suffered from a crazy Mullah who ruled only
a dozen villages. Once get the flames going and they will lick
up the pagans of the west and south. This is the way of Africa.
How many thousands, think you, were in the Mahdi’s army who never
heard of the Prophet till they saw the black flags of the Emirs
going into battle?"</p>

<p>Stumm was smiling. He turned his face to the official and spoke
with his hand over his mouth, but I caught his words. They were:
"This is the man for Hilda." The other pursed his lips and looked
a little scared.</p>

<p>Stumm rang a bell and the lieutenant came in and clicked his
heels. He nodded towards Peter. "Take this man away with you.
We have done with him. The other fellow will follow presently."</p>

<p>Peter went out with a puzzled face and Stumm turned to me.</p>

<p>"You are a dreamer, Brandt," he said. "But I do not reject you
on that account. Dreams sometimes come true, when an army follows
the visionary. But who is going to kindle the flame?"</p>

<p>"You," I said.</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is your part. You are the cleverest people in the world.
You have already half the Mussulman lands in your power. It is
for you to show us how to kindle a holy war, for clearly you have
the secret of it. Never fear but we will carry out your order."</p>

<p>"We have no secret," he said shortly, and glanced at the official,
who stared out of the window.</p>

<p>I dropped my jaw and looked the picture of disappointment. "I
do not believe you," I said slowly. "You play a game with me.
I have not come six thousand miles to be made a fool of."</p>

<p>"Discipline, by God," Stumm cried. "This is none of your ragged
commandos." In two strides he was above me and had lifted me out
of my seat. His great hands clutched my shoulders, and his thumbs
gouged my armpits. I felt as if I were in the grip of a big ape.
Then very slowly he shook me so that my teeth seemed loosened
and my head swam. He let me go and I dropped limply back in the
chair.</p>

<p>"Now, go! <em>Futsack!</em> And remember that I am your master.
I, Ulric von Stumm, who owns you as a Kaffir owns his mongrel.
Germany may have some use for you, my friend, when you fear me
as you never feared your God."</p>

<p>As I walked dizzily away the big man was smiling in his horrible
way, and that little official was blinking and smiling too. I
had struck a dashed queer country, so queer that I had had no
time to remember that for the first time in my life I had been
bullied without hitting back. When I realized it I nearly choked
with anger. But I thanked heaven I had shown no temper, for I
remembered my mission. Luck seemed to have brought me into useful
company.</p>
