<p>The peremptory tones of Fred Ashman rang out loud and clear above
the roar of the rapids and caused the servants to halt at the
moment the canoe was shoved into the water.  They looked up with
frightened expressions and awaited his approach.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded as he drew near.</p>

<p>Bippo, who was by far the brightest of the three, had shown a
wonderful readiness in picking up a knowledge of the English tongue. 
He was so much superior in that respect to his companions, that
they invariably left to him the duty of conversing with their
masters.</p>

<p>"<em>Dey're</em> ober dere," he replied, pointing to the other
shore.</p>

<p>"Who's over there?"</p>

<p>"Perfess'r and Long man; we seed 'em, dey motion for us to hurry
ober to 'em."</p>

<p>This was astounding news and Ashman was mystified.</p>

<p>"How did they get over there?  And why did they leave camp?"</p>

<p>"Don' know; seed 'em; want us hurry."</p>

<p>Without waiting to reflect upon the strange information, and
recalling that more of the natives were likely to issue from the
path at any moment, the young man stepped into the canoe, and,
catching up one of the paddles, lent his help in propelling the
craft across the foamy Xingu.</p>

<p>"Where Johns'n?" asked Bippo, when the middle of the stream was
reached, and without ceasing his toil with the paddle.</p>

<p>"The natives killed him with a poisoned spear; you will never
see him again."</p>

<p>Bippo made no reply, but communicated the startling tidings to
his companions, who muttered their amazement.  It was apparent
that the news had added to their panic, and they bent to their
task with such vigor that the boat rapidly approached the other
bank.</p>

<p>Fred was asking himself, that if his friends had managed to get
across the river, why it was they were not in sight.  He scrutinized
the dark forest and the line of moonlit space in the expectation,
of seeing them come forth to welcome him, but not a soul was in
sight.</p>

<p>He did not know what to make of it.  There was something so uncanny
about the whole business, that a strange distrust and uneasiness
took possession of him.  It could not be that the natives had
deceived him and were anxious to place the Xingu between them
and the fierce savages who had handled the whites so roughly. 
Bippo and his comrades had shown a loyalty from the first which
gave their employers the fullest confidence in them.</p>

<p>The canoe was almost against the bank, where something of the
bewilderment of Ashman seemed to enter the head of Bippo.  He
spoke to his companions and the three ceased paddling.  Ashman
had done so a moment before and was scanning the bank with a searching
but vain scrutiny.</p>

<p>"You must have been mistaken," he said in a low voice; "they
could not have swam the river and they had no other way of crossing."</p>

<p>"We seed 'em&mdash;motion dat way," and the native beckoned with his
right arm, just as a person would do when signaling another to
approach.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," replied Ashman, with a shake of his
head.</p>

<p>His doubts were confirmed, when he recalled that the professor
and Jared Long had gone up the bank of the river with the purpose
of learning the extent of the rapids.  It followed, therefore,
that if they had made their way to the other shore, it must have
been at a point so far above the angry waters that there was no
danger of being caught in the furious current.</p>

<p>He was turning over these troublous thoughts, when Bippo, who
was facing the bank they had left, uttered an expression of dismay
and extended his arm toward the shore behind them.</p>

<p>Ashman turned his head, and there in the moonlight he saw Professor
Grimcke and the New Englander standing on the land and motioning
to them to return.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;dat de way he do&mdash;he move arm like <em>dat</em>," said
Bippo; "we hurry to go to him, den he ain't here&mdash;but <em>dere</em>."</p>

<p>Ashman could not doubt that the servant believed the extraordinary
assertion he had just made, and such being the case, the startling
truth was manifest; they had seen two strangers whom they mistook
for their own friends, and these strangers had beckoned them to
paddle the canoe to the other shore where they were awaiting them.</p>

<p>If such were the fact&mdash;and he did not doubt it&mdash;a new mystery
confronted him.</p>

<p>Who were the white men and strangers? and why had they disappeared
when approached by the canoe and its occupants?</p>

<p>Ashman ordered the servants to turn the craft about and return
to the shore they had left with all speed.  While doing so, and
while Grimcke and Long were doubtless wondering what had got into
the heads of the others, the young man wrought himself into a
most uncomfortable condition of mind.</p>

<p>He questioned Bippo more particularly as to the appearance and
actions of the strangers.  It was clear that he, as well as the
other two, still believed the couple on the opposite bank were
Grimcke and Long; though when reminded that it was impossible
that they could have crossed and recrossed the stream in such
a brief time, and without any means except that of swimming, they
only shook their heads, signifying that, though they could not
explain <em>that</em> feature of the strange business, they would
not yield their belief.</p>

<p>Ashman asked further, directing his question to each of the natives
in turn, whether they saw the parties plainly enough to make sure
they were white men.  The servants were positive on this point,
adding the distracting statement that they were dressed precisely
like the two absent members of the little company, and that each
carried a rifle as they did.</p>

<p>"Same ones&mdash;same ones; don't know how cross riber, but allee
same do so," repeated Bippo, with a grin.</p>

<p>By this time the swiftly moving canoe was well on the way to
the camp which it had left so abruptly, and, a minute later, Ashman
sprang out and grasped the hand of each of his friends in turn.</p>

<p>In a few words he explained the extraordinary incidents of the
last half hour, receiving in return the story of the experience
of the Professor and his companion.  The latter were deeply touched
by the loss of Johnston.  Danger tends to draw the members of
a party closely together, and, despite the peculiar disposition
of the sailor, the three felt a deep attachment for him.  They
would have faced any danger in his behalf, but the time had passed
for that, and they could only mourn the loss of such a valuable
comrade.</p>

<p>"But what about this story that Bippo tells?"</p>

<p>Before a reply could be made, the native approached, with his
peculiar grin.</p>

<p>"How you cross riber?&mdash;why you come back 'gin?  Why you no stay
ober dere when we hurry to go to you?"</p>

<p>"Bippo, you are mistaken," replied the Professor, with all the
earnestness at his command.  "We went up this side of the stream,
and have not been on the other side since dark.  When we came
back and saw that you were not in the camp, we thought you had
all been killed."</p>

<p>The native grinned more than ever, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"De Purfes'r funny man&mdash;he make laugh."  And he walked back to
his companions with an unshakeable belief in the story given to
Fred Ashman when he dashed in such excitement from the wood.</p>

<p>"Bippo believes what he has told us," said Long, who had studied
the fellow closely; "and it follows that he and the others <em>did</em>
see a couple of white men."</p>

<p>"I imagined," remarked Grimcke with something like regret in
his tones, "that we were the first of our race to reach this spot;
but it is hard in these days to find any place on the globe where
some white person had not been before us."</p>

<p>"If there are a couple of them over there," said Ashman, scanning
the opposite bank, "they ought to be friends; and, after signaling
to our servants to cross, it is inexplainable that they should
withdraw from sight as they did."</p>

<p>"We can depend on <em>one</em> thing," added the Professor; "we
haven't seen the last of them.  I would be glad to believe them
friends, but their actions are unsatisfactory.  I am inclined
to think that the cause of their withdrawing was your entrance
into the canoe.  For some reason they wished to have nothing to
do with any of us."</p>

<p>"It may be that since we are suspicious of them," said Fred,
"they feel the same toward us, and are unwilling to make our acquaintance
until after reconnoiterin' us.  Helloa! what's up now?"</p>

<p>This question was caused by the action of Bippo, who, trembling
in every limb, and with the appearance of a person overcome with
terror, pointed to the forest behind them.</p>
