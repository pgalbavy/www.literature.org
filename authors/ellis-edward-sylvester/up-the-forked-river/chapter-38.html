<p>The notice was in the nick of time. The gun on the yacht was
loaded and trained again, and, had it been fired, would have played
the mischief on the Atlamalcan boat.</p>

<p>Captain Winton began edging the <em>Warrenia</em> toward the
other, with the purpose of running alongside and receiving its
submission. Reading his intention, Major Starland called:</p>

<p>"Don't do that! You can't trust these scoundrels! They will board!"</p>

<p>"That's what we want 'em to do!" called back the captain.</p>

<p>"I'd like it too, but we have ladies to look after; send a boat
to take off General Yozarro and me."</p>

<p>In the midst of the hubbub and confusion, Captain Ortega was
seen to lean out of the window of the pilot house, quickly level
his revolver and fire in the direction of the American. It looked
like a deliberate attempt to assassinate the unsuspecting officer
before anyone could interfere. Jack Starland did not observe the
act, but the cry of a man alongside of him caused him to turn
his head. Taking advantage of the confusion, one of General Yozarro's
officers had slipped behind the American unnoticed by him, and
was stealing upon him with drawn knife. The two Generals could
not have failed to see him, but neither interposed. A few seconds
more and the weapon would have been driven into the back of Starland.
Captain Ortega, however, sent his bullet straight and true, the
miscreant falling dead in his tracks.</p>

<p>Still leaning out of the window, with smoking pistol in hand,
Captain Ortega, as cool as ever, made himself heard above the
din:</p>

<p>"You mustn't forget down there that we have surrendered!"</p>

<p>The wheel being useless, he now came out of the pilot house and
stood like a general overlooking and directing his forces.</p>

<p>It was begun and ended, as may be said, in the twinkling of an
eye. Jack Starland did not forget the lesson. He was yet in the
midst of as treacherous a lot of wretches as so many Apaches.
He edged farther forward with his glances alternating between
his own craft and the excited throng near him, and so alert that
further interference in his behalf was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Looking up to Captain Ortega, he caught his eye and saluted:</p>

<p>"Thank you with all my heart!"</p>

<p>The other returned the salute but did not speak. His weapon was
still in his hand and not a movement below eluded him. Generals
Bambos and Yozarro were standing beside each other, the latter
with his handkerchief still in his hand, though he ceased to flutter
it, since the necessity had passed. Now and then the two spoke
in low tones, for the turmoil was succeeded by a hush that was
impressive.</p>

<p>The order of Major Jack was obeyed on board his own boat. Holding
the yacht so that, like the other, it drifted with the current,
the tender was lowered, and two seamen entered and began rowing
toward the motionless tug. With slow, even strokes and without
any sign of misgiving, they rounded to alongside. Major Starland
shoved one revolver in his pocket, where it could be instantly
drawn, and held the other ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>"You first, General," he said bowing to the leader who had surrendered.</p>

<p>Holding back, he sullenly asked:</p>

<p>"Why should I go aboard your vessel?"</p>

<p>"In accordance with the rules of civilized warfare, of which,
of course, you know nothing. For the first time in your life you
will be among gentlemen, and, therefore, need feel no fear."</p>

<p>With ill grace, the Dictator stepped carefully down and seated
himself at the bow of the smaller boat.</p>

<p>"And now myself," was the good natured remark of the American,
as he lightly followed. It was a trying moment, for he half expected
a shot in the back, even though it would have meant the death
of General Yozarro and the destruction of the tugboat. Captain
Ortega must have feared something of the kind, for he stepped
to the edge of the upper deck, leaned forward with his revolver
grasped and kept a keen watch upon every man. It is not impossible
that his vigilance averted a tragedy.</p>

<p>With the same even stroke, the small boat was rowed across the
brief, intervening space, and the mate, Dick Horton, reached down,
took the hand of the General and gave so lusty a pull that he
stumbled forward and barely saved himself from sprawling on his
hands and knees. The next instant Jack sprang among his friends,
who crowded around, grasped his hands and showered him with congratulations.</p>

<p>During the flurry, Aunt Cynthia and Miss Starland had been kept
beyond reach of harm, but they were now among the group that welcomed
the owner of the pretty craft.</p>

<p>"Had you wished to give them the safest place," said he, "you
should have let them stand at the bow in plain sight."</p>

<p>"Only the fear of a possible accident prevented that being done,"
replied the mate.</p>

<p>When General Yozarro saw the young woman in the laughing, happy
company, he took off his hat, bowed low and said with his old-time
obsequiousness:</p>

<p>"The pain of this meeting is turned to delight by the sight once
more of your beauteous countenance and your charming self."</p>

<p>Looking him in the eyes, she measured her words:</p>

<p>"<em>Que V. se atreva รก dirigirse รก mi, es el mayor insulto de
mi vida.</em>"</p>

<p>The face crimsoned as if from the sting of a whiplash across
the eyes, and those of the bystanders who understood the words,
broke into a thrilling murmur of applause. General Yozarro tried
to hide his repulse by turning to Major Starland:</p>

<p>"I have come aboard this vessel at your command; what do you
desire of me?"</p>

<p>"Your sword."</p>

<p>The Dictator meekly drew the blade from its scabbard and extended
the hilt toward the American, who recoiled.</p>

<p>"I refuse it; keep it; and take with you the remembrance that
the most dangerous thing mortal man can fool with is an American."</p>

<p>"Are you through?"</p>

<p>"I am, and I hope never to look upon your face again."</p>

<p>"<em>Mal rayo te parta!</em> Your wish is reciprocated; I will
return to my boat."</p>

<p>"<em>Adios</em>, General Yozarro!"</p>

<p>The sullen fellow made no reply, and was assisted over the side
and rowed back to the crippled tug by the two sailors who had
brought him away. During the unique interview, the crew and officers
crowded the gunwale and watched proceedings with the keenest interest.
Among them was the bulky General Bambos.</p>
