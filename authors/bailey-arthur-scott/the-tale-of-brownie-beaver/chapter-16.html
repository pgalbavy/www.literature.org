<p>After Jasper Jay left Brownie Beaver, on that day when Jasper told
Brownie that the photographer had made a flashlight picture of him,
Brownie could hardly wait for it to grow dark. He had made up his mind
that he would go back to that same tree, which was still not quite
gnawed through; and he hoped that he would succeed in having his
picture taken again. Like many other people, Brownie Beaver felt that
he could not have too much of a good thing.
</p>
<p>There was another reason, too, for his going back to the tree. If the
light flared again and the click sounded in the bushes, Brownie
intended to go right into the thicket and get his picture before
anybody else could carry it away with him. (You can understand how
little he understood about taking photographs.)
</p><p>Well, the dark found Brownie back at the tree once more. And he began
once more to gnaw at it. He tried to look pleasant, too, because he
had heard that that was the way one should look when having his
picture taken.
</p><p>He found it rather difficult, gnawing chips out of the tree and
smiling at the same time. But he was an earnest youngster and he did
the best he could.
</p><p>Brownie Beaver kept wishing the flashlight would go off, because--what
with smiling and gnawing--his face began to ache. But no glare of
light broke through the darkness.
</p><p>It was not long before Brownie had gnawed away so many chips that the
tree began to nod its head further and further toward the ground. And
Brownie wished that the flash-light would hurry and go off before the
tree fell.
</p><p>But there was not even the faintest flicker of light. It was most
annoying. And Brownie was so disappointed that for once he forgot to
be careful when he was cutting down a tree. He kept his eyes on the
bushes all the time, instead of on the tree--as he should have done.
And all the time the tree leaned more and more.
</p><p>At last there was a _snap!_ Brownie Beaver should have known what
that meant. But he was so eager to have his picture taken that he
mistook the <u>snap</u> for the <u>click</u> that he had first heard almost a
week before.
</p><p>He thought it must be the click of a camera hidden in the bushes. And
he stood very still and looked extremely pleasant. Now, Brownie Beaver
should have known better. But like most people, for once he made a
mistake. What he really heard was the tree snapping. And before he
could jump out of the way the tree came crashing down upon him and
pinned him fast to the ground. He saw a flash of light, to be sure,
and a good many stars. But all that only came from the knock on his
head which the tree gave him.
