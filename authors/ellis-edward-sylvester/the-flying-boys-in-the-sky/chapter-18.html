<p>Harvey Hamilton was about to speak when Detective Pendar raised
a warning hand.</p>

<p>"Sh!" he whispered; "some one is in the hall."</p>

<p>The youth listened intently, but could not detect so much as
the "shadow of a sound." None the less, his guest was right.</p>

<p>"He has gone by; listen!"</p>

<p>The faintest possible noise, as if made by some one opening and
closing a door with the extremest caution, came to their ears.</p>

<p>"It’s one of them," remarked the detective, in the same almost
inaudible tone; "let’s sit as near together as we can, and not
raise our voices above a whisper. I allowed you to do so a few
minutes ago, because there were no listeners."</p>

<p>"Are those two watchers as you call them staying at the hotel?"</p>

<p>"They occupy the fourth room beyond."</p>

<p>"And my negro lad has the third."</p>

<p>"And I the second; so we are all neighbors."</p>

<p>"How will you manage to leave without detection?"</p>

<p>"I am used to that kind of business," replied Pendar with a smile;
"give it no thought. Let us return to the matter in which you
are as much interested as I. My proposal is that in sailing over
the surrounding country, you scrutinize it, so far as your keen
vision, assisted by your binoculars, will permit, in search of
the headquarters of this gang."</p>

<p>"How shall I recognize the place if I see it?"</p>

<p>"You will have to follow the law of probabilities. The woods
are uninhabited, except in the eastern part—that is, in this direction.
If you observe any old house or cabin that shows evidence of being
occupied, probably it’s the place for which we are looking. Locate
it definitely, and then we shall have something upon which to
act. As soon as you report to me, I’ll move with all the vigor
and common sense at my command."</p>

<p>Here was the proposal as clearly as it could be put. Harvey nodded
his head several times and compressed his lips, as does one who
is in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>"Heaven grant that I shall be able to do something."</p>

<p>"Then I was not wrong in assuming you were interested in the
cause of justice?" remarked Detective Pendar.</p>

<p>"Not by a large majority."</p>

<p>"Whoever has a hand in restoring the little girl to her parents
will receive a munificent reward. Perhaps this fact may be of
interest to you."</p>

<p>"None whatever. Now that I shall undertake the task, we must
have an understanding; suppose I discover such a place as you
mention, while cruising aloft, how am I to communicate with you
without drawing suspicion to myself?"</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble in that. You can return to the hotel,
as will be quite natural for you to do, take a room under some
pretense such as not feeling well, and I shall get to you without
much delay. That done it will not be long before we formulate
a plan of action."</p>

<p>"Will my negro prove any handicap to me?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I am hoping he will be of help."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible for him to be secretive or cunning; he is so
open that his honesty speaks for itself; no one can doubt that
you and he are on a little outing, with no purpose except enjoyment."</p>

<p>"You have gauged his character correctly."</p>

<p>"As I did yours."</p>

<p>"Don’t be too certain of that; you were correct at least in believing
you would enlist my efforts in your work."</p>

<p>"When will you be ready to begin?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning,—provided the weather proves as clear as that
old farmer declared it would be."</p>

<p>"I heard his prophecy; his neighbors believe him infallible;
I think you can count on favoring conditions. Bear in mind that
your task is simple. You cannot halt and rest in the air, because
you have to travel rapidly to sustain yourself, but you see the
enormous advantages your position gives you. Wherever a house,
even the smallest one, stands in the woods, the roof or some part
of it must be visible from above. The abductors of the child will
treat her well so long as there is a prospect of obtaining the
ransom, for it is to their interest to do so. There must be cooking
done in the dwelling, and the smoke will show; washing and other
things are necessary,—all of which you can learn without the aid
of glasses from a perch of several hundred feet. Are you acquainted
with an aviator known as Professor Morgan?"</p>

<p>The abrupt question startled the youth.</p>

<p>"I met him last night and again this forenoon. He is a crank."</p>

<p>"Rather; his mind is unbalanced, but for all that it is a brilliant
intellect which has been knocked topsy-turvy by studying out inventions
in aviation."</p>

<p>"And he has made some wonderful ones. He told me he had discovered
a chemical which mixed with gasoline will keep him in the air
for twelve hours, and he is confident that he will soon double
and triple its effectiveness. He has already learned how to sustain
his machine for some time motionless."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him do it?"</p>

<p>"I have," and Harvey related the incident of the Professor dropping
the giant crackers among the group on the edge of the wood.</p>

<p>"It is a most extraordinary achievement. I suppose he has managed
to secure in some way the action of supports which operate like
the wings of a bird, when he holds himself stationary in the sky."</p>

<p>"Furthermore, he runs his machine without noise, which is another
feat that no one else has been able to attain. It seems to me
also that his ‘Dragon of the Skies,’ as he has named it, can travel
faster than the swiftest eagle."</p>

<p>It was in the mind of Harvey to ask the detective how he came
to form the acquaintance of Professor Morgan and to inquire whether
he knew the crank was in Chesterton at that moment, or had been
there during the afternoon; but, as the caller did not volunteer
the information, the youth forbore questioning him.</p>

<p>"We shall not forget that whenever and wherever we meet outside
of this room, it will be as strangers. If you wish to speak to
me on anything, you will take off your cap and scratch your head.
If I see that, I shall accept it as notice that you have something
important to say. As soon as you can do so without attracting
notice you will go to your room. When the coast becomes clear
I shall follow you, but prudence may require me to delay doing
so for an hour or for several hours."</p>

<p>At that moment both were startled by a loud knock on the door.
On the instant, Detective Pendar whispered:</p>

<p>"Make believe you are asleep."</p>

<p>Waiting, therefore, until the summons had been twice repeated,
Harvey asked mumblingly:</p>

<p>"Who’s there?"</p>

<p>"It’s me, Bunk."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Didn’t yo’ tole me dat I warn’t to bodder yo’ and yo’ would
call me in de morning?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did; what’s the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I woke up a little while ago and couldn’t disremember for suah
what it was yo’ tole me, so I slipped to yo’ door to find out.
Dat’s all; good night!"</p>

<p>And his heavy tread sounded along the hall to his door through
which he passed. The colored youth had slept so much during the
day that he needed little more refreshment of that nature.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that for stupidity?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"I am not surprised. I do not recall that I have anything more
to say. Will you be good enough to glance up and down the hall
in search of anything suspicious?"</p>

<p>The detective himself noiselessly opened the door. Harvey stepped
outside and stood listening and gazing toward the rear through
the dimly lighted avenue, that being the direction in which the
rooms referred to were situated.</p>

<p>"I cannot see or hear anything——"</p>

<p>Turning to face the man whom he addressed, and whom he supposed
to be standing directly behind him, Harvey saw nobody. The room
was empty. The amazed youth looked the other way, where the stairs
lay. He was barely in time to catch a glimpse of his caller in
gray as he turned the short corner and disappeared down the steps
like a gliding shadow.</p>

<p>"That beats everything," remarked the wondering young aviator,
who now locked his door and prepared for bed.</p>

<p>It was a long time, however, after he turned off the light and
stretched out on the soft mattress before he was able to woo slumber.
Now that the detective had recalled the kidnapping of the Hastings
child in Philadelphia, many minor particulars came back to the
youth. All these helped to stir his feelings, until he longed
for the morning when he could begin his work of bringing the unspeakable
miscreants to justice. He comprehended vividly the anguish of
those stricken hearts in their luxurious home, and shuddered to
think that his own sister Mildred might have been the stolen child.</p>

<p>With his thoughts flitting with lightning rapidity from one subject
to another, Harvey regretted that he had not questioned the officer
about Professor Morgan. It would be interesting to learn how the
two had become acquainted.</p>

<p>"I wonder," added our young friend, following one of his innumerable
whimsies, "whether the Professor is on this job too. He seems
to be lingering in these parts, and he certainly has advantages
which can never be mine. Perhaps when I called to him, he feared
it would complicate matters if I was allowed to mix in. What’s
the use of guessing?" he exclaimed impatiently, as he flung himself
on his side and tried for the twentieth time to coax gentle slumber
to come to him.</p>

<p>The coquettish goddess consented after a time, though the hour
was past midnight when the youth closed his eyes. Such being the
situation, it is not strange that Bohunkus Johnson was the first
out of bed in the morning, and down stairs. He was thinking of
the aeroplane and fearful that it had been molested during the
night.</p>

<p>"I orter watched it agin," was his thought as he dashed out of
doors.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Harvey Hamilton was startled by footsteps
rushing along the hall, followed by a furious thumping on his
door.</p>

<p>"Git up, Harv, quick!" he shouted; "somebody has busted de airyplane
all to flinders!" </p>
