<p>The prospect of being besieged all night in a tree by a pack
of mountain wolves was not a pleasant one by any means, and Fred,
who had climbed up among the branches with the object of securing
a few hours' slumber, found little chance of closing his eyes
for even a minute.</p>

<p>"It might have been worse," he reflected, as he listened to the
dismal howling, "for if they had happened to come down upon me
when I was walking along the ravine, I could n't have gotten into
any place like this in time to save me. Wolves don't know how
to climb trees, and so long as I stay here I'm all right; but
I can't stay here forever."</p>

<p>By-and-by there was a sharp pattering upon the ground, and then
the hoarse howling changed to quick, dog-like yelps, such as these
animals emit when leaping down upon their prey, and which may
be supposed to mean exultation.</p>

<p>Fred came down sufficiently far from his perch to get a glimpse
of the ground beneath. He saw nearly a score of huge mountain
wolves, bounding hither and thither, and over each other, and
back and forth, as though going through some preliminary exercise,
so as to prepare themselves for the feast that was soon to be
theirs.</p>

<p>"If I was down there," thought the boy, with a shudder, "I suppose
I'd last them about two minutes, and then they'd be hungrier than
ever. They'll stay there all night, but I wonder if they'll go
away in the morning. If they don't, I can't tell what's to become
of me."</p>

<p>He watched them awhile with a lingering fear that some of them
might manage to get among the branches, but they did not make
the attempt. They had sufficient dexterity to leap from the ground
up among the lowermost limbs, but had no power of retaining their
position, or doing anything after they got there.</p>

<p>Nature had unfitted them for such work, and they did not try
it. They seemed to possess tireless activity, and they kept up
their leaping and frolicing as though they had nothing else in
the world to do.</p>

<p>After watching them until he was tired, Fred carefully climbed
up among the branches again, where he secured himself as firmly
as was possible. He had lain his rifle across a couple of limbs
above his head, and fixed upon a place within a dozen feet or
so of the top, as the one offering the best support.</p>

<p>Here two or three limbs were gnarled and twisted in such a way
that he could seat himself and arrange his body in such a way
that he could have enjoyed a night's slumber with as much refreshment
as if stretched out upon a blanket on the ground. But the serenade
below was not calculated to soothe his nerves into soft, downy
sleep, and he shuddered at the thought of sitting where he was
for four or five hours, with the pattering feet below him, varied
by a yelp or howl, when he should feel disposed to close his eyes.</p>

<p>"But, then, it can't be helped," he added to himself, endeavoring
to look philosophically at the matter. "I ought to be thankful
that they didn't catch me before I reached the tree, and so I
am; and I would be very thankful, too, if they would go away and
leave me alone. I've got a bed here twice as good as I expected
to find, and could sleep as well as anywhere else."</p>

<p>Almost any sound long continued becomes monotonous, and thus
it was that scarcely a half-hour had passed when, in spite of
the dreadful beasts below, his eyes began to grow heavy and his
head to droop.</p>

<p>But at this juncture he received a terrible shock. Just as everything
was becoming dreamy and unreal, he was startled by a jarring of
the tree, as though struck with some heavy object. When it was
repeated several times, his senses returned to him, and he raised
his head and listened.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that can be?" he said to himself. "Is some one
hitting the tree? No, it isn't that."</p>

<p>It seemed not so much a jarring of the trunk as a swaying of
the whole tree.</p>

<p>Puzzled and alarmed, Fred drew his legs from their rather cramped
position, and picked his way downward among the limbs until he
had descended far enough to inform himself.</p>

<p>"Heaven save me! they're in the tree!" he gasped, paralyzed for
the moment with terror.</p>

<p>In one sense, such was the case. The frolicsome wolves had varied
their amusement by springing upward among the lowermost branches.
A brute would make a jump, and, landing upon the limb, sustain
himself until one or two of his comrades imitated his performance,
when they would all come tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>Thus, it may be said, they were climbing the tree, but they were
scarcely in it when they were out of it again, and Fred had nothing
to fear from that source.</p>

<p>In his fright, he hastily clambered back again after his rifle,
with the intention of shooting the one that was nearest, but by
the time he laid his hand upon the weapon his terror had lessened
so much that he concluded to wait until assured that it was necessary.
And a few minutes' waiting convinced him that he had nothing to
fear from that source. It was only another phase of the hilarious
fun they were keeping up for their own amusement.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll try it again," concluded Fred, as he proceeded
to stow his arms and legs into position for the nap which he came
so near commencing a few minutes before.</p>

<p>He did not consider it within the range of possibility that he
could unconsciously displace his limbs during sleep sufficiently
to permit him to fall.</p>

<p>He heard the yelping and occasional baying below, the rustling
among the limbs, and the undulation caused by the animals leaping
upward among the branches; but they ceased to disturb him after
a time, and became like the sound of falling water in the ears
of the hunter by his camp-fire. It was not long before slumber
stole away his senses, and he slept.</p>

<p>A healthful boy generally sleeps well, and is untroubled by dreams,
unless he has been indulging in some indiscretion in the way of
diet, but the stirring scenes of the last few days were so impressed
upon the mind of Fred that they reappeared in his visions of night,
as he lived them all over again. He was again standing in the
silent wood along the Rio Pecos, with Mickey O'Rooney, watching
for the stealthy approach of the Apaches. As time passed, he saw
the excited figure of Sut Simpson the scout, as he came thundering
over the prairie, with his warning cry of the approach of the
red-skins. The rattling fight in front of the young settlement,
the repulse of the Apaches, the swoop of Lone Wolf and the lad's
capture, the night ride, the encampment among the mountains, his
own singular escape, and, finally, his siege by the mountain wolves&mdash;all
these passed through the mind of the sleeping lad, and finally
settled down to a hand-to-hand fight with the leader of the brutes.</p>

<p>Fred fancied that the two had met in the ravine, and, clubbing
his gun, he whacked the beast over his head every time he leaped
at him. He struck him royal, resounding blows, too, but, somehow
or other, they failed to produce any effect. The wolf kept coming
and coming again, until, at last, the boy concluded he would wind
up the bout by jumping upon, and throwing him down, and then deliberately
choking him to death.</p>

<p>He made the jump, and awakening instantly, found he had leaped
"out of bed," and was falling downward through the limbs. It all
flashed upon the lad with the suddenness of lightning.</p>

<p>He remembered the ravenous wolves, and, with a shuddering horror
which cannot be pictured or imagined, felt that he was dropping
directly into their fangs. It was the instinct of nature which
caused him to throw out his feet and hands in the hope of checking
his fall.</p>

<p>By a hair's breadth he succeeded. But it was nearly the lowermost
limb which he grasped with his desperate clutch, and hung with
his arms dangling within reach of the wolves below.</p>

<p>The famished brutes seemed to be expecting this choice tid-bit
to drop into their maws, and their yelps and howls became wilder
than ever, and they nearly broke each other's necks in their furious
frolicing back and forth.</p>

<p>The moment young Munson succeeded in checking himself, he made
a quick effort to draw up his feet and regain his place beyond
the reach of the brutes. It was done in a twinkling, but not soon
enough to escape one of the creatures, which made a leap and fastened
upon his foot.</p>

<p>The lad was just twisting himself over the limb, when he felt
one of his shoes seized in the jaws of a wolf. The sudden addition
to his weight drew him down again, and almost jerked his hold
from the limb, in which event he would have been snapped up and
disposed of before he could have made a struggle in the way of
resistance. But he held on, and with an unnatural spasm of strength,
drew himself and the clogging weight part way up, kicking both
feet with the fury of despair.</p>

<p>The wolf held fast to one shoe, while the heel of the other was
jammed into his eyes. This, however, would not have dislodged
him, had not his own comrades interfered, and defeated the brute
by their own eager greediness. Seeing that the first one had fastened
to the prize, a half-dozen of them began leaping upward with the
purpose of securing a share in the same. In this way they got
into each other's way, and all came tumbling to the ground in
a heap.</p>

<p>Before they could repeat the performance the terrified lad was
a dozen feet beyond their reach, and climbing still higher.</p>

<p>When Fred reached his former perch, he was in doubt whether he
should halt or go still higher. His heart was throbbing violently,
and he was white and panting from the frightful shock he had received.</p>

<p>"That was awful!" he gasped, as he reflected upon what had taken
place. "I don't know what saved me from death! Yes, I do; it was
God!" he added, looking up through the leaves to the clear, moonlit
sky above him. "He has brought me through a good many dangers,
and He will not forsake me."</p>

<p>After such an experience, it was impossible that sleep should
return to the eyes of the lad. He resumed his old perch, but only
because it was the most comfortable. Had he believed that there
was a possibility of slumber, he would have fought it off, but
there was not.</p>

<p>"I'll wait here till morning," he said to himself. "It must be
close at hand; and then, maybe, they will go away."</p>

<p>He looked longingly for some sign of the breaking of day, but
the moonlight, for a long time, was unrelieved by the rose-flush
of the morning.</p>
