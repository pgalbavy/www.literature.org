When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And proved it&mdash;'t was no matter what he said:<br/>
They say his system 't is in vain to batter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too subtle for the airiest human head;<br/>
And yet who can believe it? I would shatter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,<br/>
Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,<br/>
And wear my head, denying that I wear it.

</p>
<p>
What a sublime discovery 't was to make the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Universe universal egotism,<br/>
That all 's ideal&mdash;all ourselves: I 'll stake the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.<br/>
O Doubt!&mdash;if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But which I doubt extremely&mdash;thou sole prism<br/>
Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!<br/>
Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.

</p>
<p>
For ever and anon comes Indigestion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes<br/>
Our soarings with another sort of question:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that which after all my spirit vexes,<br/>
Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,<br/>
Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,<br/>
The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder&mdash;

</p>
<p>
If it be chance; or if it be according<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the old text, still better:&mdash;lest it should<br/>
Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As several people think such hazards rude.<br/>
They 're right; our days are too brief for affording<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Space to dispute what no one ever could<br/>
Decide, and every body one day will<br/>
Know very clearly&mdash;or at least lie still.

</p>
<p>
And therefore will I leave off metaphysical<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion, which is neither here nor there:<br/>
If I agree that what is, is; then this I call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;<br/>
The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what the reason is&mdash;the air<br/>
Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks<br/>
Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.

</p>
<p>
The first attack at once proved the Divinity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);<br/>
The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The third, the usual Origin of Evil;<br/>
The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On so uncontrovertible a level,<br/>
That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,<br/>
On purpose to believe so much the more.

</p>
<p>
To our Theme.<br/>
&mdash;The man who has stood on the Acropolis,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look'd down over Attica; or he<br/>
Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea<br/>
In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,<br/>
May not think much of London's first appearance&mdash;<br/>
But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?

</p>
<p>
Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset the time, the place the same declivity<br/>
Which looks along that vale of good and ill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where London streets ferment in full activity;<br/>
While every thing around was calm and still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he<br/>
Heard,&mdash;and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum<br/>
Of cities, that boil over with their scum:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,<br/>
And lost in wonder of so great a nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.<br/>
'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it<br/>
Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection<br/>
Awaits it, each new meeting or election.

</p>
<p>
'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what they please; and if that things be dear,<br/>
'T is only that they love to throw away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.<br/>
Here laws are all inviolate; none lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:<br/>
Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,<br/>
With,&mdash;'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'

</p>
<p>
These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter<br/>
Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,<br/>
In which the heedless gentleman who gads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,<br/>
May find himself within that isle of riches<br/>
Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.

</p>
<p>
Juan, who did not understand a word<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'<br/>
And even that he had so rarely heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'<br/>
Or 'God be with you!'&mdash;and 't is not absurd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To think so: for half English as I am<br/>
(To my misfortune), never can I say<br/>
I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And being somewhat choleric and sudden,<br/>
Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fired it into one assailant's pudding&mdash;<br/>
Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,<br/>
Unto his nearest follower or henchman,<br/>
'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'

</p>
<p>
On which Jack and his train set off at speed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,<br/>
Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And offering, as usual, late assistance.<br/>
Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if his veins would pour out his existence,<br/>
Stood calling out for bandages and lint,<br/>
And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.

</p>
<p>
'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome foreigners in this way: now<br/>
I recollect some innkeepers who don't<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Differ, except in robbing with a bow,<br/>
In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is to be done? I can't allow<br/>
The fellow to lie groaning on the road:<br/>
So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'

</p>
<p>
But ere they could perform this pious duty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!<br/>
O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel<br/>
Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill<br/>
His breath,&mdash;he from his swelling throat untied<br/>
A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'&mdash;and died.

</p>
<p>
The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell<br/>
Exactly why it was before him thrown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.<br/>
Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough varmint, and a real swell,<br/>
Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,<br/>
His pockets first and then his body riddled.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan, having done the best he could<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the circumstances of the case,<br/>
As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His travels to the capital apace;&mdash;<br/>
Esteeming it a little hard he should<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In twelve hours' time, and very little space,<br/>
Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native<br/>
In self-defence: this made him meditative.

</p>
<p>
He from the world had cut off a great man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in his time had made heroic bustle.<br/>
Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?<br/>
Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?<br/>
Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),<br/>
So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?

</p>
<p>
But Tom's no more&mdash;and so no more of Tom.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is<br/>
Not long before the most of them go home.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is<br/>
That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,<br/>
Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'<br/>
Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like lucus from no light); through prospects named<br/>
Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed<br/>
Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;<br/>
Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'<br/>
Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;<br/>
Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There mails fast flying off like a delusion;<br/>
There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion<br/>
Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass<br/>
(For in those days we had not got to gas);&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Through this, and much, and more, is the approach<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of travellers to mighty Babylon:<br/>
Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.<br/>
I could say more, but do not choose to encroach<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun<br/>
Had set some time, and night was on the ridge<br/>
Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,<br/>
Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,<br/>
The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A spectral resident&mdash;whose pallid beam<br/>
In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile&mdash;<br/>
Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.

</p>
<p>
The Druids' groves are gone&mdash;so much the better:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stone-Henge is not&mdash;but what the devil is it?-<br/>
But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That madmen may not bite you on a visit;<br/>
The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)<br/>
To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;<br/>
But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.

</p>
<p>
The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation<br/>
Like gold as in comparison to dross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Match'd with the Continent's illumination,<br/>
Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,<br/>
And when they grew so&mdash;on their new-found lantern,<br/>
Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.

</p>
<p>
A row of gentlemen along the streets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspended may illuminate mankind,<br/>
As also bonfires made of country seats;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old way is best for the purblind:<br/>
The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,<br/>
Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,<br/>
Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.

</p>
<p>
But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could recommence to hunt his honest man,<br/>
And found him not amidst the various progenies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this enormous city's spreading span,<br/>
'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,<br/>
I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,<br/>
But see the world is only one attorney.

</p>
<p>
Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner<br/>
As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner<br/>
Admitted a small party as night fell,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,<br/>
Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,<br/>
St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'

</p>
<p>
They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tide of well-clad waiters, and around<br/>
The mob stood, and as usual several score<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound<br/>
In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Commodious but immoral, they are found<br/>
Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-<br/>
But Juan now is stepping from his carriage

</p>
<p>
Into one of the sweetest of hotels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially for foreigners&mdash;and mostly<br/>
For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cannot find a bill's small items costly.<br/>
There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),<br/>
Until to some conspicuous square they pass,<br/>
And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.

</p>
<p>
Juan, whose was a delicate commission,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Private, though publicly important, bore<br/>
No title to point out with due precision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.<br/>
'T was merely known, that on a secret mission<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,<br/>
Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said<br/>
(In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.

</p>
<p>
Some rumour also of some strange adventures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;<br/>
And as romantic heads are pretty painters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves<br/>
Into the excursive, breaking the indentures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,<br/>
He found himself extremely in the fashion,<br/>
Which serves our thinking people for a passion.

</p>
<p>
I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrary; but then 't is in the head;<br/>
Yet as the consequences are as bright<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they acted with the heart instead,<br/>
What after all can signify the site<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead<br/>
In safety to the place for which you start,<br/>
What matters if the road be head or heart?

</p>
<p>
Juan presented in the proper place,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To proper placemen, every Russ credential;<br/>
And was received with all the due grimace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who govern in the mood potential,<br/>
Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)<br/>
That they as easily might do the youngster,<br/>
As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.

</p>
<p>
They err'd, as aged men will do; but by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,<br/>
'T will be because our notion is not high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of politicians and their double front,<br/>
Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what I love in women is, they won't<br/>
Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it<br/>
So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.

</p>
<p>
And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth in masquerade; and I defy<br/>
Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fact without some leaven of a lie.<br/>
The very shadow of true Truth would shut<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up annals, revelations, poesy,<br/>
And prophecy&mdash;except it should be dated<br/>
Some years before the incidents related.

</p>
<p>
Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?<br/>
She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushes for those who will not:&mdash;but to sigh<br/>
Is idle; let us like most others bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,<br/>
After the good example of 'Green Erin,'<br/>
Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan was presented, and his dress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mien excited general admiration&mdash;<br/>
I don't know which was more admired or less:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One monstrous diamond drew much observation,<br/>
Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)<br/>
Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;<br/>
And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.

</p>
<p>
Besides the ministers and underlings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who must be courteous to the accredited<br/>
Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until their royal riddle 's fully read,<br/>
The very clerks,&mdash;those somewhat dirty springs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of office, or the house of office, fed<br/>
By foul corruption into streams,&mdash;even they<br/>
Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:

</p>
<p>
And insolence no doubt is what they are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,<br/>
In the dear offices of peace or war;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,<br/>
When for a passport, or some other bar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),<br/>
If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,

</p>
<p>
But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These phrases of refinement I must borrow<br/>
From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a move set down for joy or sorrow<br/>
Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,<br/>
More than on continents&mdash;as if the sea<br/>
(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.

</p>
<p>
And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your continental oaths are but incontinent,<br/>
And turn on things which no aristocratic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent<br/>
This subject quote; as it would be schismatic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:&mdash;<br/>
But 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring&mdash;<br/>
Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.

</p>
<p>
For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For true or false politeness (and scarce that<br/>
Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first the emblem (rarely though) of what<br/>
You leave behind, the next of much you come<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet. However, 't is no time to chat<br/>
On general topics: poems must confine<br/>
Themselves to unity, like this of mine.

</p>
<p>
In the great world,&mdash;which, being interpreted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,<br/>
And about twice two thousand people bred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By no means to be very wise or witty,<br/>
But to sit up while others lie in bed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look down on the universe with pity,&mdash;<br/>
Juan, as an inveterate patrician,<br/>
Was well received by persons of condition.

</p>
<p>
He was a bachelor, which is a matter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of import both to virgin and to bride,<br/>
The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)<br/>
'T is also of some moment to the latter:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,<br/>
Requires decorum, and is apt to double<br/>
The horrid sin&mdash;and what 's still worse, the trouble.

</p>
<p>
But Juan was a bachelor&mdash;of arts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had<br/>
An air as sentimental as Mozart's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Softest of melodies; and could be sad<br/>
Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at the proper time; and though a lad,<br/>
Had seen the world&mdash;which is a curious sight,<br/>
And very much unlike what people write.

</p>
<p>
Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;<br/>
For both commodities dwell by the Thames,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,<br/>
Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:<br/>
Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers<br/>
Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.

</p>
<p>
The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the season, upon speculation<br/>
Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,<br/>
Thought such an opportunity as this is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a rich foreigner's initiation,<br/>
Not to be overlook'd&mdash;and gave such credit,<br/>
That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.

</p>
<p>
The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the pages of the last Review<br/>
Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:<br/>
They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;<br/>
And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?<br/>
And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?

</p>
<p>
Juan, who was a little superficial,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not in literature a great Drawcansir,<br/>
Examined by this learned and especial<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:<br/>
His duties warlike, loving or official,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His steady application as a dancer,<br/>
Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,<br/>
Which now he found was blue instead of green.

</p>
<p>
However, he replied at hazard, with<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A modest confidence and calm assurance,<br/>
Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.<br/>
That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'<br/>
Into as furious English), with her best look,<br/>
Set down his sayings in her common-place book.

</p>
<p>
Juan knew several languages&mdash;as well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He might&mdash;and brought them up with skill, in time<br/>
To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.<br/>
There wanted but this requisite to swell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His qualities (with them) into sublime:<br/>
Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,<br/>
Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.

</p>
<p>
However, he did pretty well, and was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Admitted as an aspirant to all<br/>
The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At great assemblies or in parties small,<br/>
He saw ten thousand living authors pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That being about their average numeral;<br/>
Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'<br/>
As every paltry magazine can show its.

</p>
<p>
In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to the champion in the fisty ring,<br/>
Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although 't is an imaginary thing.<br/>
Even <em>I&mdash;</em>albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king&mdash;<br/>
Was reckon'd a considerable time,<br/>
The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.

</p>
<p>
But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:<br/>
'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:<br/>
But I will fall at least as fell my hero;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;<br/>
Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,<br/>
With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.

</p>
<p>
Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and after; but now grown more holy,<br/>
The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;<br/>
And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,<br/>
Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,<br/>
A modern Ancient Pistol&mdash;by the hilts?

</p>
<p>
Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets up for being a sort of moral me;<br/>
He 'll find it rather difficult some day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn out both, or either, it may be.<br/>
Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;<br/>
And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'<br/>
Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.

</p>
<p>
John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he really promised something great,<br/>
If not intelligible, without Greek<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrived to talk about the gods of late,<br/>
Much as they might have been supposed to speak.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;<br/>
'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,<br/>
Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.

</p>
<p>
The list grows long of live and dead pretenders<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To that which none will gain&mdash;or none will know<br/>
The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His last award, will have the long grass grow<br/>
Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I might augur, I should rate but low<br/>
Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty<br/>
Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.

</p>
<p>
This is the literary lower empire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;&mdash;<br/>
A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,<br/>
With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,<br/>
I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,<br/>
And show them what an intellectual war is.

</p>
<p>
I think I know a trick or two, would turn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their flanks;&mdash;but it is hardly worth my while<br/>
With such small gear to give myself concern:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;<br/>
My natural temper 's really aught but stern,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;<br/>
And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,<br/>
And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.

</p>
<p>
My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past<br/>
With some small profit through that field so sterile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,<br/>
Left it before he had been treated very ill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd<br/>
Amongst the higher spirits of the day,<br/>
The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.

</p>
<p>
His morns he pass'd in business&mdash;which, dissected,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was like all business a laborious nothing<br/>
That leads to lassitude, the most infected<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,<br/>
And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk in tender horrors of our loathing<br/>
All kinds of toil, save for our country's good&mdash;<br/>
Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.

</p>
<p>
His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour<br/>
In riding round those vegetable puncheons<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower<br/>
Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all it is the only 'bower'<br/>
(In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair<br/>
Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.

</p>
<p>
Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar<br/>
Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor<br/>
Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,<br/>
Which opens to the thousand happy few<br/>
An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'

</p>
<p>
There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,<br/>
The only dance which teaches girls to think,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes one in love even with its very faults.<br/>
Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long the latest of arrivals halts,<br/>
'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,<br/>
And gain an inch of staircase at a time.

</p>
<p>
Thrice happy he who, after a survey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the good company, can win a corner,<br/>
A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'<br/>
And let the Babel round run as it may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,<br/>
Or an approver, or a mere spectator,<br/>
Yawning a little as the night grows later.

</p>
<p>
But this won't do, save by and by; and he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,<br/>
Must steer with care through all that glittering sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where<br/>
He deems it is his proper place to be;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,<br/>
Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill<br/>
Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.

</p>
<p>
Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,<br/>
Let him take care that that which he pursues<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not at once too palpably descried.<br/>
Full many an eager gentleman oft rues<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,<br/>
Amongst a people famous for reflection,<br/>
Who like to play the fool with circumspection.

</p>
<p>
But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:&mdash;<br/>
O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,<br/>
Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill<br/>
Can tender souls relate the rise and fall<br/>
Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.

</p>
<p>
But these precautionary hints can touch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the common run, who must pursue,<br/>
And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or little overturns; and not the few<br/>
Or many (for the number's sometimes such)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom a good mien, especially if new,<br/>
Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,<br/>
Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.

</p>
<p>
Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,<br/>
Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he can escape from so much danger<br/>
As will environ a conspicuous man. Some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'<br/>
And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;&mdash;<br/>
I wish they knew the life of a young noble.

</p>
<p>
They are young, but know not youth&mdash;it is anticipated;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;<br/>
Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;<br/>
Both senates see their nightly votes participated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;<br/>
And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,<br/>
The family vault receives another lord.

</p>
<p>
'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty&mdash;'Where<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!<br/>
Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I look for it&mdash;'t is gone, a globe of glass!<br/>
Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.<br/>
Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,<br/>
And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.

</p>
<p>
Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:<br/>
Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?<br/>
Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?<br/>
Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?<br/>
And where&mdash;oh, where the devil are the rents?

</p>
<p>
Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?<br/>
Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'<br/>
Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:<br/>
'Caw me, caw thee'&mdash;for six months hath been hatching<br/>
This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.

</p>
<p>
Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?<br/>
Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is<br/>
An evolution oft performed of late).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the Dublin shouts&mdash;and London hisses?<br/>
Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where<br/>
My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.

</p>
<p>
Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals<br/>
So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels<br/>
Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fashion,&mdash;say what streams now fill those channels?<br/>
Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,<br/>
Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.

</p>
<p>
Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taken up at length with younger brothers:<br/>
Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;<br/>
Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the list of alterations bothers.<br/>
There 's little strange in this, but something strange is<br/>
The unusual quickness of these common changes.

</p>
<p>
Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to<br/>
The humblest individual under heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than might suffice a moderate century through.<br/>
I knew that nought was lasting, but now even<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Change grows too changeable, without being new:<br/>
Nought 's permanent among the human race,<br/>
Except the Whigs not getting into place.

</p>
<p>
I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke<br/>
(No matter which) turn politician stupider,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If that can well be, than his wooden look.<br/>
But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sail for a new theme:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I have seen&mdash;and shook<br/>
To see it&mdash;the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;<br/>
But don't pretend to settle which was best.

</p>
<p>
I have seen the Landholders without a rap&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen Joanna Southcote<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I have seen&mdash;<br/>
The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen&mdash;<br/>
I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean&mdash;<br/>
I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses<br/>
Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.

</p>
<p>
I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Interminable&mdash;not eternal&mdash;speakers&mdash;<br/>
I have seen the funds at war with house and land&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers&mdash;<br/>
I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By slaves on horseback<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I have seen malt liquors<br/>
Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull&mdash;<br/>
I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-

</p>
<p>
But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow sees another race as gay<br/>
And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Life 's a poor player,'&mdash;then 'play out the play,<br/>
Ye villains!' above all keep a sharp eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less on what you do than what you say:<br/>
Be hypocritical, be cautious, be<br/>
Not what you seem, but always what you see.

</p>
<p>
But how shall I relate in other cantos<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what befell our hero in the land,<br/>
Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moral country? But I hold my hand&mdash;<br/>
For I disdain to write an Atalantis;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But 't is as well at once to understand,<br/>
You are not a moral people, and you know it<br/>
Without the aid of too sincere a poet.

</p>
<p>
What Juan saw and underwent shall be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My topic, with of course the due restriction<br/>
Which is required by proper courtesy;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And recollect the work is only fiction,<br/>
And that I sing of neither mine nor me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,<br/>
Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt<br/>
This&mdash;when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.

</p>
<p>
Whether he married with the third or fourth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,<br/>
Or whether with some virgin of more worth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)<br/>
He took to regularly peopling Earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,&mdash;<br/>
Or whether he was taken in for damages,<br/>
For being too excursive in his homages,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Is yet within the unread events of time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back<br/>
Against the same given quantity of rhyme,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For being as much the subject of attack<br/>
As ever yet was any work sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who love to say that white is black.<br/>
So much the better!<br/>
&mdash;I may stand alone,<br/>
But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.
