<p>When Deerfoot the Shawanoe bade good-by to Jack Carleton and
Otto Relstaub, it was with the declaration that they would soon
see each other again.  Precisely what he meant would be hard to
say; but probably it implied that he would take pains in the near
future to make them a visit when they should be settled in their
own log-cabins at home.</p>

<p>He left them, as has been intimated, because he believed there
was no further need of bearing them company, and because business
of great importance to himself demanded that he should take another
course, and travel many long miles toward that wild region in
the southern part of Missouri, which is broken and crossed by
the Ozark range of mountains.</p>

<p>For fully an hour after he turned away from his friends he pushed
through the forest in a south-western direction.  He advanced
at a leisurely pace, for there was no call for haste, and he loved
to be alone in the vast solitude, where he often held sweet communion
with the Great Spirit, whom he worshiped and adored with a fervency
of devotion scarcely known except by those who have died for His
sake.</p>

<p>The sun had descended but a brief way in the western sky when
the youthful warrior found himself steadily climbing an elevation
of several hundred feet.  He had been over the ground before,
and he knew that, after passing the ridge, the surface sloped
downward for many miles, shutting the Mississippi out of sight
altogether.</p>

<p>For some time a suspicion had been steadily taking shape in the
mind of Deerfoot, and it was that which led him to hasten his
footsteps until he reached the crest of the elevation, where he
paused to make an investigation.</p>

<p>The thought which ran through his mind was the probability that
all danger from the Miamis and Shawanoes (especially the latter)
was not yet at an end.  He reasoned from well established facts;
they knew beyond question that it was he who had outwitted them
in his efforts to save the boys when they were placed in such
extreme peril.  The Shawanoes hated him with an intensity beyond
description, and, despite the repeated disasters which had overtaken
those who sought, his ruin, they would strive by every means to
revenge themselves upon him.</p>

<p>What more likely, therefore, than that they had crossed the Mississippi
in pursuit? The certainty that they had done so would have caused
Deerfoot no misgiving, so far as he was concerned, but his fear
was for the boys.  He reasoned that the Shawanoes would follow
the trail of the three, including also that of the stray horse. 
When they reached the point where Deerfoot left them they would
read its meaning at a glance.  They would know the whites were
following the animal, while the Shawanoe had gone about his own
business.</p>

<p>Deprived of his matchless guidance and skill, the destruction
of Jack and Otto would seem so easy that two or three would hasten
after them.  The action of their guide would naturally imply that
he had no thought of any such attempt on the part of his enemies,
who, therefore, would be the more strongly tempted to go in quest
of his scalp.</p>

<p>As I have said, Deerfoot could laugh at all such strategy when
directed against himself, but he was uneasy about the others,
who would never think of their danger until too late.  Ordinarily
they were not likely to encounter any red men, except the half
friendly Osages, and would be without protection against a stealthy
shot from the woods behind them.</p>

<p>If such an issue threatened, Deerfoot felt that his duty was
clear: he must spare no effort to protect the boys to the last
extremity, and it was the hope that he would be able to catch
sight of some almost invisible sign which would tell the truth
that led him to halt on the crest of the elevation and gaze long
and searchingly toward the Dark and Bloody Ground, which had been
the scene of so many fearful encounters between the pioneers and
untamable red men.</p>

<p>The great river was several miles distant, the almost unbroken
forest stretching between.  Deerfoot narrowly scrutinized the
yellow surface as far as the eye could follow the winding course,
but not the first evidence of life was to be seen.  Not a solitary
canoe or wild animal breasted the swift current which is now laden
with thousands of crafts of almost every description.</p>

<p>The searcher after truth hardly expected to discover anything
on the river itself, for if the Shawanoes were hunting for him
they had crossed long before; but away beyond, in the solemn depths
of the Kentucky wilderness, burned a camp-fire, whose faint smoke
could be traced as it rose above the tree-tops.  A careful study
of the vapor led Deerfoot to suspect that it had served as a signal,
but it was beyond his ken to determine its nature.</p>

<p>There was nothing on the other side of the Mississippi which
could afford the faintest clew, and he began the study of Louisiana,
so far as it was open to his vision.  His altitude gave him an
extended survey toward every point of the compass.  As it was
impossible that any of his enemies should be to the west of him,
he did not bestow so much as a glance in that direction.</p>

<p>Again and again the keen eyes roved over the space between him
and the great stream, but nothing rewarded the visual search. 
It was not to be expected that if the Shawanoes were stealing
along his trail they would stop to build a fire&mdash;at least not
before night closed in.  The only circumstances under which they
would attempt anything of the kind would be in the event of their
wishing to signal some message to those left on the other shore. 
Possibly they wanted reinforcements, or wished those who were
in waiting to make some movement of their own, and, if so they
would be sure to telegraph.</p>

<p>If such was the case, the telegrams had been sent and the instrument&mdash;that
is, the camp-fire had been destroyed.  Nothing of the sort was
now to be seen.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot did discover something to the northward.  A long
distance away could be detected another column of vapor&mdash;slight,
but dark, and with a wavy, shuddering motion, such as is observed
when the first smoke from the fire under an engine rises through
the tall, brick chimney.</p>

<p>He watched it fixedly for several minute and then smiled, for
he rightly interpreted its meaning.</p>

<p>"There is the wigwam of the Osage chief, Wish-o-wa-tum, the Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder,
who lives alone with his family in the woods, and smokes his pipe. 
He cares not for Miami or Huron or Shawanoe, but smokes in peace."</p>

<p>Inasmuch, as no other vapor met the eye, the sagacious Shawanoe
adopted a very different line of investigation, or rather research.
He was able to tell where the lesser elevation stood, on which
he had bidden good-by to the boys, and could form a tolerably
correct idea of the line he had followed since then.</p>

<p>If the Shawanoes were pushing the search for him, several must
be somewhere along that line.  Most of the time they would be
effectually hidden from sight by the foliage of the trees, but
there were open places here and there (very slight in extent),
where they would be visible for the moment to one who fixed his
eyes on that particular spot.  On the site of the encampment,
where the little party had eaten their meal, and where not the
slightest ember remained, the pursuers would halt for a brief
consultation.  If they divided into two companies of pursuit,
it was there the division had taken or would take place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the vegetation was so abundant just there, that
he could not hope to catch sight of any of his enemies, until
after they should reach a point a considerable distance away. 
It would therefore seem impossible for him to tell whether a portion
of the war party turned to the northward in quest of the boys,
or whether they all concentrated in the search for Deerfoot himself.</p>

<p>It would appear beyond his power, I say, for the extraordinary
youth to settle the question, while standing carefully hidden
behind the trunk of a tree, but a single slight chance presented
itself, and to that he appealed.</p>

<p>He knew the general direction of the horse's trail after it had
left the spot where Deerfoot parted company with his friends. 
Unless it turned abruptly to the right or left, it led across
an open space, which was in plain view of the Shawanoe, and provided
the crossing had not already been made, he would be able to observe
it.</p>

<p>He therefore watched this opening with a keenness which would
permit nothing to elude it.  His brain had handled the problem
with the certainty of intuition.  Following a process of reasoning
which cannot be fully explained, he convinced himself that the
redskins had not yet fled across the narrow space.  Whether they
were to do so or not would be determined in a brief while.</p>

<p>If the savages hunting Jack and Otto had gone beyond the point
named, before Deerfoot fixed his attention on it, then it followed
of necessity that those who were  so eager to suspend the scalp
of the youth from the ridge-pole of their wigwams were at that
moment close upon him.  In any event, he was morally certain the
whole question would be settled within the coming hour, for, if
no sign appeared, it would be a sign of itself that nothing was
to be feared.</p>

<p>Fully aware of the woodcraft of his own people, Deerfoot threw
away no chances.  He kept closely hidden behind the tree which
served as a screen, as though an enemy was in ambush within bowshot.</p>

<p>He waited a briefer time than he anticipated.  His eyes were
flitting hither and thither, when a couple of warriors deliberately
walked across the opening on which his attention was fixed.  Though
only two, they moved in Indian file, one directly behind the other.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt they were after the scalps of Jack Carleton
and Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>It was equally certain that a larger number were hunting for
Deerfoot. The fact would not have caused him an additional throb
of the pulse, could he have been assured that no harm, would befall
his friends. True, they had displayed much courage and brilliancy
a few hours before in their contest on the other side of the Mississippi,
and it would seem that, with their training from earliest youth,
they ought to be able to protect themselves against an equal number
of red men.  But, reason on the matter as he chose, Deerfoot could
not drive away the feeling that it was his duty to go to their
help.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit wills that Deerfoot shall be the friend of
the white people who are his friends.  The Shawanoes and Miamis
have no right on these hunting-grounds," he added, with a dangerous
flash of his black eyes; "if they follow Deerfoot here, he will
teach them they do wrong."</p>

<p>Clearly it would not do for him to take the back trail and retrace
his steps, for that would insure a collision with those who were
so anxious to meet him.  Much as he detested them, and little
as he feared the issue of such a meeting, it would be certain
to delay his good offices for those who caused him so much anxiety,
and such delay was dangerous.</p>

<p>His purpose was to "cut across lots," that is, to hasten by the
nearest route to a point which would place him in advance of the
couple that were giving their attention to Jack and Otto, and
to carry out that plan necessitated his making no mistake in his
judgment as to the trail of his friends.</p>

<p>"The warriors will have to walk until the sun goes down," he
said to himself, "before they will come up with them; if they
run, or if my friends have paused to rest, then they will find
them sooner. Deerfoot must not wait, for he is needed."</p>

<p>He had not yet left his place behind the tree, for he was convinced
that some of the Shawanoes were close to him, even though he had
received no proof that such was the fact, but that proof came
within the following few minutes and before he had yet stirred
from his position.</p>
