<p>The following morning, Aunt Hannah returned to her tiny apartment
on Park Avenue, financially benefitted by her Westchester sojourn,
having extracted a bolt of Chinese loot-silk for a gown from her
nephew's dismayed wife, and the usual check from her nephew.</p>

<p>Lindley, a slow, pallid, and thrifty soul, had always viewed
Aunt Hannah's event with unfeigned alarm, because, somehow or
other, at the close of every visit he found himself presenting
her with a check. And it almost killed him.</p>

<p>Years ago he had done it for the first time. He had never intended
to; certainly never meant to continue. Every time she appeared
he vowed to himself that he wouldn't. But before her visit ended,
the pressure of custom became too much for him; a deadly sense
of obligation toward this dreadful woman&mdash;of personal responsibility
for her indigence&mdash;possessed him, became gradually an obsession,
until he exorcised it by the present of a check.</p>

<p>She never spoke of it&mdash;never seemed to hint at it&mdash;always seemed
surprised and doubtful of accepting; but some devilish spell certainly
permeated the atmosphere in her immediate vicinity, drawing perfectly
good money out of his innermost and tightly buttoned breast-pockets
and leaving it certified and carelessly crumpled in her velvet
reticule.</p>

<p>It happened with a sickening regularity which now he had come
to view with the modified internal fury of resignation. It had
simply become a terrible custom, and, with all his respectable
inertia and thrifty caution, adherence to custom ruled Lindley
Hammerton. For years he had pinched roses; for years he had drawn
checks for Aunt Hannah. Nothing but corporeal dissolution could
terminate these customs.</p>

<p>As for Aunt Hannah, she banked her check and had her bolt of
silk made into a gown, and trotted briskly about her business
with perennial self-confidence in her own ability to get on.</p>

<p>Once or twice during the following fortnight she remembered Jacqueline,
and mentally tabulated her case as a possible source of future
income; but social duties were many and acridly agreeable, and
pecuniary pickings plenty. Up to her small, thin ears in intrigue,
harmless and not quite so harmless, she made hay busily while
the social sun shone; and it was near the end of February before
a stagnation in pleasure and business brought Jacqueline's existence
into her mind again.</p>

<p>She called up Silverwood, and eventually got Desboro on the wire.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "that your golden-headed and rather
attenuated inamorata has never had the civility to call on me!"</p>

<p>"She has been too busy."</p>

<p>"Too busy gadding about Silverwood with you!"</p>

<p>"She hasn't been here since you saw her."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"It's quite true. An important collection is to be sold under
the hammer on the premises; she had the contract to engineer that
matter before she undertook to catalogue my stuff."</p>

<p>"Oh! Haven't you seen her since?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<em>Not</em> at Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"No, only at her office."</p>

<p>He could hear her sniff and mutter something, then:</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to give some parties at Silverwood,
and ask me to bring your pretty friend," she said.</p>

<p>"I am. She has the jades and crystals to catalogue. What I want,
as soon as she gets rid of Clydesdale, is for her to resume work
here&mdash;come up and remain as my guest until the cataloguing is
finished. So you see I'll have to have you, too."</p>

<p>"That's a cordial and disinterested invitation, James!"</p>

<p>"Will you come? I'll ask half a dozen people. You can kill a
few at cards, too."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"The first Thursday in March. It's a business proposition, but
it's between you and me, and she is not to suspect it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Aunt Hannah cheerfully. "I'll arrange my engagements
accordingly. And do try to have a gay party, James; and don't
ask the Clydesdales. You know how Westchester gets on my nerves.
And I always hated her."</p>

<p>"You are very unjust to her and to him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You can't tell me anything about Cary Clydesdale, or about his
wife, either," she interrupted tartly, and rang off in a temper.
And Desboro went back to his interrupted business with Vail.</p>

<p>Since Jacqueline had been compelled to suspend temporarily her
inventory at Silverwood in favor of prior engagements, Desboro
had been to the city only twice, and both times to see her.</p>

<p>He had seen her in her office, remained on both occasions for
an hour only, and had then taken the evening train back to Silverwood.
But every evening he had written her of the day just ended&mdash;told
her about the plans for farming, now maturing, of the quiet life
at Silverwood, how gradually he was reëstablishing neighbourly
relations with the countryside, how much of a country squire he
was becoming.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And the whole thing with malice aforethought," he wrote. "
&mdash;Every blessed move only a strategy in order that, to do
you honour, I may stand soberly and well before the community
when you are among my guests.</p>

<p>"In tow of Aunt Hannah; engaged for part of the day in your business
among the jades, crystals, and porcelains of a celebrated collection;
one of a house party; and the guest of a young man who has returned
very seriously to till the soil of his forefathers; all that anybody
can possibly think of it will be that your host is quite as captivated
by your grace, wisdom, and beauty as everybody else will be.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of that, Jacqueline?"</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>"I think," she wrote, "that no other man has ever been as nice
to me. I do not really care about the other people, but I quite
understand that you and I could not see each other as freely as
we have been doing, without detriment to me. I like you&mdash;superfluous
admission! And I should miss seeing you&mdash;humble confession! And
so I suppose it is best that everybody should know who and what
I am&mdash;a business woman well-bred enough to sit at table with your
friends, with sufficient self-confidence to enter and leave a
room properly, to maintain my grasp on the conversational ball,
and to toss it lightly to my vis-à-vis when the time comes.</p>

<p>"All this is worth doing and enduring for the sake of being your
guest. Without conscientious scruples, apprehensions, perplexities,
and fears I could never again come to Silverwood and be there
alone with you as I have been. Always I have been secretly unhappy
and afraid after a day with you at Silverwood. Sooner or later
it would have had to end. It can not go on&mdash;as it has been going.
I know it. The plea of business is soon worn threadbare if carelessly
used.</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;caring for your friendship as I do&mdash;and it having become
such a factor in my life &mdash;I find it easy to do what you
ask me; and I have arranged to go with Mrs. Hammerton to Silverwood
on the first Thursday in March, to practice my profession, enjoy
the guests at your house party, and cultivate our friendship with
a clear conscience and a tranquil and happy mind.</p>

<p>"It was just that little element of protection I needed to make
me more happy than I have ever been. Somehow, I <em>couldn't</em>
care for you as frankly and freely as I wanted to. And some things
have happened&mdash;you know what I mean. I didn't reproach you, or
pretend surprise or anger. I felt neither&mdash;only a confused sense
of unhappiness. But &mdash;I cared for you enough to submit.</p>

<p>"Now I go to you with a sense of security that is delightful.
You don't understand how a girl situated as I am feels when she
knows that she is in a position where any woman has the right
to regard her with suspicion. Skating, motoring, with you, I could
not bear to pass people you knew and to whom you bowed&mdash;women&mdash;even
farmers' wives.</p>

<p>"But now it will be different; I feel so warmly confident at
heart, so secure, that I shall perhaps dare to say and do and
be much that you never suspected was in me. The warm sun of approval
makes a very different person of me. A girl, who, in her heart,
does not approve of what she is doing, and who is always expecting
to encounter other women who would not approve, is never at her
best&mdash;isn't even herself&mdash;and isn't really happy, even with a
man she likes exceedingly. You will, I think, see a somewhat different
girl on Thursday."</p>

<p>"If your words are sometimes a little misty," he wrote, "your
soul shines through everything you say, with a directness entirely
heavenly. Life, for us, begins on Thursday, under cover no longer,
but in the open. And the field will be as fair for you as for
me. That is as it should be; that is as far as I care to look.
But somehow, after all is done and said that ever will be said
and done between you and me, I am conscious that when we two emerge
from the dream called 'living,' you will lead and direct us both&mdash;even
if you never do so here on earth.</p>

<p>"I am not given to this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, dear, I'd like to amuse my guests with something
unusual. Could you help me out?"</p>

<p>She answered: "I'll do anything in the world I can to make your
house party pleasant for you and your guests. So I've asked Mr.
Sissly to give a recital. It is quite the oddest thing; you don't
<em>listen</em> to a symphony which he plays on the organ; you
<em>see</em> it. He will send the organ, electrical attachments,
lights, portable stage and screen, to Silverwood; and his men
will install everything in the armoury.</p>

<p>"Then, if it would amuse your guests, I could tell them a little
about your jades and crystals, and do it in a rather unusual way.
I think you'd rather like it. Shall I?"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>He wrote some days later: "What a darling you are! Anything you
do will be charming. Sissly's men have arrived and are raising
a racket in the armoury with hammer and saw.</p>

<p>"The stage will look quite wonderful between the wide double
rank of equestrian figures in armour.</p>

<p>"Aunt Hannah writes that you called on her and that you and she
are coming up on the train together, which is delightfully sensible,
and exactly as it should be. Heaven alone knows how long you are
going to be able to endure her. It's rather odd, you know, but
I like her and always have, though she's made things disagreeable
for me more than once in my life.</p>

<p>"Your room is ready; Aunt Hannah's adjoins. Quarters for other
guests are ready also. Have you any idea how I look forward to
your coming?"</p>

<p>Three days later his guests arrived on the first three morning
trains&mdash;a jolly crowd of young people&mdash;nineteen of them&mdash;who filled
his automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles. Their luggage followed
in vans, from which protruded skis and hockey sticks. There being
no porter, the butler of Silverwood House received them in front
of the lodge at the outer gates, offering the "guest cup," a Desboro
custom of many generations, originating in England, although the
lodge had stood empty and the gates open since his grandfather's
time.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "There was, for a moment, an unconscious and unwonted
grace in his manner"]</p>

<p>Desboro welcomed them on his own doorstep; and there was, for
a moment, an unconscious and unwonted grace in his manner and
bearing&mdash;an undefined echo in his voice of other and more courtly
times, as he gave his arm to Aunt Hannah and led her inside the
hall.</p>

<p>There it exhaled and vanished as Mrs. Quant and the maids smilingly
conducted the guests to their various quarters&mdash;vanished with
the smiling formality of his greeting to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>The men returned first, clad in their knickerbockers and skating
jackets. Cocktails awaited them in the billiard-room, and they
gathered there in noisy curiosity over this celebrated house not
often opened to anybody except its owner.</p>

<p>"Who is the dream, Jim?" demanded Reginald Ledyard. "I mean the
wonder with the gold hair, that Mrs. Hammerton has in tow?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Aunt Hannah's&mdash;an expert in antique art&mdash;and as
clever and charming as she is pretty," said Desboro pleasantly.</p>

<p>"High-brow! Oh, help!" muttered Ledyard. "Where's your library?
I want to read up."</p>

<p>"She can talk like other people," remarked Van Alstyne. "I got
next on the train&mdash;old lady Hammerton stood for me. She can flirt
some, I'll tell you those."</p>

<p>Bertie Barkley extracted the olive from a Bronx and considered
it seriously.</p>

<p>"The old lady is on a salary, of course. Nobody ever heard of
anybody named Nevers," he remarked.</p>

<p>"They'll hear of somebody named Nevers now," observed Captain
Herrendene with emphasis, "or," he added in modest self-depreciation,
"I am all kinds of a liar."</p>

<p>"Where did you know her, Jim?" inquired Ledyard curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Nevers's firm has charge of cataloguing my armour and
jades. They're at it still. That's how I first met her&mdash;in a business
way. And when I found her to be a friend of Aunt Hannah's, I asked
them both up here as my guests."</p>

<p>"You always had an eye for beauty," said Cairns. "What do you
suppose Mrs. Hammerton's game is?"</p>

<p>"Why, to make Miss Nevers known where she really ought to belong,"
replied Desboro frankly.</p>

<p>"How high does she plan to climb?" asked Barkley. "Above the
vegetating line?"</p>

<p>"Probably not as far as the line of perpetual stupidity," said
Desboro. "Miss Nevers appears to be a very busy, and very intelligent,
and self-sufficient young lady, and I imagine she would have neither
time nor inclination to decorate any of the restless, gilt-encrusted
sets."</p>

<p>Van Alstyne said: "She's got the goods to deliver almost anywhere
Mrs. Hammerton chooses &mdash;F. O. B. what?"</p>

<p>"She's some dream," admitted Ledyard as they all moved toward
the library.</p>

<p>There were a lot of gay young girls there in skating costumes;
Ledyard's sister Marie, with her large figure and pretty but slightly
stupid face; Helsa Steyr, blonde, athletic, and red-haired; Athalie
Vannis, with her handsome, dark face, so often shadowed by discontent;
Barkley's animated little wife, Elizabeth, grey-eyed and freckled
and brimming with mischief of the schoolboy quality; the stately
Katharine Frere; Aunt Hannah; and Jacqueline.</p>

<p>All except the latter two had been doing something to cocktails
of various species; Jacqueline took nothing; Aunt Hannah, Scotch
whiskey with relish.</p>

<p>"It's about the last of the skating," said Desboro, "so we'd
better take what we can get as soon as luncheon is over. Pick
your partners and don't squabble. Me for Mrs. Hammerton!" and
he led her out.</p>

<p>At table he noticed that Captain Herrendene had secured Jacqueline,
and that Reggie Ledyard, on the other side, was already neglecting
his own partner in his eager, good-looking and slightly loutish
fashion of paying court to the newest and prettiest girl.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah's glance continually flickered sideways at Desboro,
but when she discovered that he was aware of her covert scrutiny,
she said under her breath:</p>

<p>"I've been shopping with her; the little thing didn't know how
to clothe herself luxuriously in the more intimate details. I'd
like to see anybody's maid patronise her now! Yours don't know
enough&mdash;but she'll go where there are those who do know, sooner
or later. What do you think of her?"</p>

<p>"What I always think," he said coolly. "She is the most interesting
girl I ever met."</p>

<p>"She's too clever to care very much for what I can offer her,"
said Mrs. Hammerton drily. "Glitter and tinsel would never dazzle
her, James; pretense, complacency, bluff, bragg, she'd devilish
soon see through it all with those clear, intelligent eyes&mdash;see
at the bottom what lies squirming there&mdash;anxiety, self-distrust,
eternal dread, undying envy, the secret insecurity of those who
imitate the real&mdash;which does not exist in America&mdash;and who know
in their hopeless hearts that they are only shams, like that two-year-old
antique tavern yonder, made quaint to order."</p>

<p>He said smilingly: "She'll soon have enough of your particular
familiars. But, little by little, she'll find herself in accord
with people who seek her as frankly as she seeks them. Natural
selection, you know. Your only usefulness is to give her the opportunity,
and you've begun to do it, bless your heart."</p>

<p>She flashed a malicious glance at him; under cover of the gay
hubbub she said:</p>

<p>"I may do more than that, James."</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"Yes; I may open her eyes to men of your sort."</p>

<p>"Her eyes are open already, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not very wide. For example&mdash;you'd never marry her. Would you?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way," he said coldly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't have to talk at all. I <em>know</em>. If you ever
marry, I know what deadly species of female it will be. You're
probably right; you're that kind, too&mdash;no real substance to you,
James. And so I think I'll have to look after my intellectual
protégée, and be very sure that her pretty eyes are wide open."</p>

<p>He turned toward her; their glances met level and hard:</p>

<p>"Let matters alone," he said. "I have myself in hand."</p>

<p>"You have in hand a horse with a runaway record, James."</p>

<p>Cairns, on her left, spoke to her; she turned and answered, then
presented her well-shaped back to that young gentleman and again
crossed glances with Desboro, who was waiting, cool as steel.</p>

<p>"Come, James," she said in a low voice, "what do you mean to
do? A man always means something or nothing; and the latter is
the more dangerous."</p>

<p>As that was exactly what Desboro told himself he had always meant,
he winced and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, you&mdash;the lot of you!" she said with smiling contempt. "I'll
equip that girl to take care of herself before I'm through with
her. Watch me."</p>

<p>"It is part of your business. Equip her to take care of herself
as thoroughly as anybody you know. Then it will be up to her&mdash;as
it is up to all women, after all&mdash;and to all men."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it? You've all the irresponsibility and moral rottenness
of your Cavalier ancestors in you; do you know it, James? The
Puritan, at least, never doubted that he was his brother's keeper."</p>

<p>Desboro said doggedly: "With the individual alone rests what
that individual will be."</p>

<p>"Is that your mature belief?" she asked ironically.</p>

<p>"It is, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Lord! To think of a world full of loosened creatures like you!
A civilised society swarming with callow and irresponsible opportunists,
amateur Jesuits, idle intelligences reinfected with the toxins
of their own philosophy! But," she shrugged, "I am indicting man
himself&mdash;nations and nations of him. Besides, we women have always
known this. And hybrids are hybrids. If there's any claret in
the house, tell Farris to fetch some. Don't be angry, James. Man
and woman once were different species, and the world has teemed
with their hybrids since the first mating."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barkley leaned across the table toward him:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, James? You look dangerous."</p>

<p>His face cleared and he smiled:</p>

<p>"Nobody is really dangerous except to themselves, Betty."</p>

<p>She quoted saucily: "Il n'y a personne qui ne soit dangereux
pour quelqu'un!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammerton added: "Il faut tout attendre et tout craindre
du temps et des hommes."</p>

<p>Reggie Ledyard, much flattered, admitted the wholesale indictment
against his sex:</p>

<p>"How can we help it? Man, possessing always dual personality,
is naturally inclined toward a double life."</p>

<p>"Man's chief study has been man for so long," observed Mrs. Hammerton,
"that the world has passed by, leaving him behind, still engrossed
in counting his thumbs. Name your French philosopher who can beat
that reflection," she added to Desboro, who smiled absently.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "All the men there had yielded to the delicate
attraction of her"]</p>

<p>From moment to moment he had been watching Jacqueline and the
men always leaning toward her &mdash;Reggie Ledyard persistently
bringing to bear on her the full splendour of his straw-blond
and slightly coarse beauty; Cairns, receptive and débonnaire as
usual; Herrendene, with his keen smile and sallow visage lined
with the memory of things that had left their marks&mdash;all the men
there had yielded to the delicate attraction of her.</p>

<p>Desboro said to Mrs. Hammerton: "Now you realise where she really
belongs."</p>

<p>"Better than you do," she retorted drily.</p>

<p>After luncheon there were vehicles to convey them to the pond,
a small sheet of water down in the Desboro woods. And while a
declining sun glittered through the trees, the wooded shores echoed
with the clatter and scrape of skates and the rattle of hockey-sticks
crossed in lively combat.</p>

<p>But inshore the ice had rotted; the end of such sport was already
in sight. Along the gravelly inlet, where water rippled, a dozen
fingerling trout lay half hidden among the pebbles; over a bank
of soft, sun-warmed snow, gnats danced in the sunset light; a
few tree-buds had turned sticky.</p>

<p>Later, Vail came and built a bonfire; Farris arrived with tea
baskets full of old-fashioned things, such as turnovers and flip
in stone jugs of a century ago.</p>

<p>Except for a word or two at intervals, Desboro had found no chance
to talk to Jacqueline. Now and then their glances encountered,
lingered, shifted, with scarcely a ghost of a smile in forced
response to importunities. So he had played an impartial game
of hockey, skated with any girl who seemed to be receptive, cut
intricate figures with Mrs. Hammerton in a cove covered with velvet-smooth
black ice, superintended the bonfire construction, directed Farris
with the tea.</p>

<p>Now, absently executing a "grape-vine," he was gliding along
the outer ranks of his guests with the mechanical patrolling instinct
of a collie, when Jacqueline detached herself from a fire-lit
group and made him a gay little sign to halt.</p>

<p>Picking her way through the soft snow on the points of her skates,
she took to the ice and joined him. They linked hands and swung
out into the starlight.</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's why I signalled you. I never have had such a good time.
I wanted you to know it."</p>

<p>"You like my friends?"</p>

<p>She looked up: "They are all so charming to me! I didn't expect
people to be cordial."</p>

<p>"You need expect nothing else wherever you go and whomever you
meet&mdash;barring the inevitable which no attractive girl can avoid
arousing. Do you get on with Aunt Hannah?"</p>

<p>She laughed: "Isn't it odd? <em>I</em> call her that, too. She
asked me to. And do you know, she has been a perfect dear about
everything. We shopped together; I never had quite ventured to
buy certain fascinating things to wear. And we had such a good
time lunching at the Ritz, where I had never dared go. Such beautiful
women! Such gowns! Such jewels!"</p>

<p>They halted and looked back across the ice at the distant fire
and the dark forms moving about it.</p>

<p>"You've bowled over every man here, as a matter of course," he
said lightly. "If you'll tell me how you like the women I'll know
whether they like you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I like them; they are as nice to me as they are to each
other!" she exclaimed, "&mdash;except, perhaps, one or two&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Marie Ledyard is hopelessly spoiled; Athalie Vannis is usually
discontented," he said philosophically. "Don't expect either of
them to give three cheers for another girl's popularity."</p>

<p>They crossed hands and swept toward the centre of the pond on
the "outer edge." Jacqueline's skating skirt was short enough
for her to manage a "Dutch roll," steadied and guided by Desboro;
then they exchanged it for other figures, not intricate.</p>

<p>"Your friend, Mr. Sissly, is dining with us," he observed.</p>

<p>"He's really very nice," she said. "Just a little too&mdash;artistic&mdash;for
you, perhaps, and for the men here&mdash;except Captain Herrendene&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Herrendene is a fine fellow," he said.</p>

<p>"I like him so much," she admitted.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, turned toward her as though to speak,
but evidently reconsidered the impulse.</p>

<p>"He is not very young, is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Herrendene? No."</p>

<p>"I thought not. Sometimes in repose his face seems sad. But what
kind eyes he has!"</p>

<p>"He's a fine fellow," said Desboro without emphasis.</p>

<p>Before they came within the firelight, he asked her whether she
had really decided to give them a little lecture on jades and
crystals; and she said that she had.</p>

<p>"It won't be too technical or too dry, I hope," she added laughingly.
"I told Captain Herrendene what I was going to say and do, and
he liked the idea."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me, too, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"No, I want <em>you</em> to be surprised. Besides, I haven't
time; we've been together too long already. Doesn't one's host
have to be impartially attentive? And I think that pretty little
Miss Steyr is signalling you."</p>

<p>Herrendene came out on the ice toward them:</p>

<p>"The cars are here," he said, "and Mrs. Hammerton is cold."</p>

<p>Dinner was an uproariously lively function, served amid a perfect
eruption of bewildering gowns and jewels and flowers. Desboro
had never before seen Jacqueline in a dinner gown, or even attempted
to visualise her beauty amid such surroundings in contrast with
other women.</p>

<p>She fitted exquisitely into the charming mosaic; from crown to
toe she was part of it, an essential factor that, once realised,
became indispensable to the harmony.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he told himself, she did not really dominate with the
fresh delicacy of her beauty; perhaps it was only what he saw
in her and what he knew of her that made the others shadowy and
commonplace to him.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "In all the curious eyes turned toward her, he
saw admiration, willing or conceded."]</p>

<p>Yet, in all the curious eyes repeatedly turned toward her, he
saw admiration, willing or conceded, recognised every unspoken
tribute of her own sex as well as the less reserved surrender
of his; saw her suddenly developed into a blossom of unabashed
and youthful loveliness under what she had once called "the warm
sun of approval"; and sat in vague and uneasy wonder, witnessing
the transfiguration.</p>

<p>Sissly was there, allotted to Katharine Frere; and that stately
girl, usually credited among her friends with artistic aspirations,
apparently found him interesting.</p>

<p>So all went well enough, whether gaily or seriously, even with
Aunt Hannah, who had discovered under Desboro's smiling composure
all kinds of food for reflection and malicious diversion.</p>

<p>For such a small party it was certainly a gay one&mdash;at least people
were beginning to think so half way through dinner&mdash;which merely
meant that everybody was being properly appreciated by everybody's
neighbours, and that made everybody feel unusually witty, and
irrepressible, and a little inclined to be silly toward the end.</p>

<p>But then the after-dinner guests began to arrive&mdash;calm, perfectly
poised and substantial Westchester propositions who had been bidden
to assist at an unusual programme, and to dance afterward.</p>

<p>The stodgy old house rang with chatter and laughter; hall, stairs,
library, and billiard-room resounded delightfully; you could scare
up a pretty girl from almost any cover&mdash;if you were gunning for
that variety of girl.</p>

<p>Reggie Ledyard had managed to corner Jacqueline on the stairs,
but couldn't monopolise her nor protect himself against the shameless
intrusion of Cairns, who spoiled the game until Herrendene raided
the trio and carried her off to the billiard-room on a most flimsy
pretext.</p>

<p>Here, very properly, a Westchester youth of sterling worth got
her away and was making toward the library with her when Desboro
unhooked a hunting horn from the wall and filled the house with
deafening blasts as signal that the show was about to begin in
the armoury.</p>

<p>The armoury had been strung with incandescent lights, which played
over the huge mounted figures in mail, and glanced in a million
reflections from the weapons on the wall. A curtained and raised
stage faced seats for a hundred people, which filled the long,
wide aisle between the equestrian shapes; and into these the audience
was pouring, excited and mystified by the odd-looking and elaborate
electrical attachments flanking the stage in front of the curtained
dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>Jacqueline, passing Desboro, whispered:</p>

<p>"I'm so thrilled and excited. I know people will find Mr. Sissly's
lecture interesting, but do you think they'll like mine?"</p>

<p>"How do I know, you little villain? You've told Herrendene what
you are going to do, but you haven't given me even a hint!"</p>

<p>"I know it; I wanted to&mdash;to please you&mdash;" Her light hand fell
for a moment on his sleeve, and he saw the blue eyes a little
wistful.</p>

<p>"You darling," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Thank you. It isn't the proper thing to say to me&mdash;but I've
quite recovered my courage."</p>

<p>"Have you quite recovered all the scattered fragments of your
heart? I am afraid some of these men may carry portions of it
away with them."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, monsieur. Really, I must hurry and dress&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dress?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; also make up!"</p>

<p>"But I thought you were to give us a little talk on Chinese jades."</p>

<p>"But I must do it in my own way, Mr. Des&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" They were in the rear of the dressing-room and he took
her hand.</p>

<p>"I call you Jacqueline, unreproved. Is my name more difficult
for you?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to? In cold blood?"</p>

<p>"Not in cold blood."</p>

<p>He took her into his arms; she bent her head gravely, but he
felt her restless fingers worrying his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;Jim."</p>

<p>The swift fire in his face answered the flush in hers; he drew
her nearer, but she averted her dainty head in silence and stood
so, her hand always restless on his arm.</p>

<p>"You haven't changed toward me in these few weeks, have you,
Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I have?"</p>

<p>He was silent. After a moment she glanced up at him with adorable
shyness. He kissed her, but her lips were cold and unresponsive,
and she bent her head, still picking nervously at the cloth of
his sleeve.</p>

<p>"I <em>must</em> go," she said.</p>

<p>"I know it." He released her waist.</p>

<p>She drew a quick, short breath and looked up smiling; then sighed
again, and once more her blue eyes became aloof and thoughtful.</p>

<p>He stood leaning against the side of the dressing-room, watching
her.</p>

<p>Finally she said with composure: "I <em>must</em> go. Please
like what I shall do. It will be done to please you &mdash;Jim."</p>

<p>He opened the dressing-room door for her; she entered, turned
to look back at him for an instant, then closed the door.</p>

<p>He went back to his place among the audience.</p>

<p>A moment later a temple gong struck three times; the green curtains
parted, revealing a white screen, and Mr. Lionel Sissly advancing
with a skip to the footlights. The audience looked again at its
programme cards and again read:</p>

<p>"No. 1: A Soundless Symphony ... Lionel Sissly."</p>

<p>"Colour," lisped Mr. Sissly, "is not only precious for its own
sake, but also because it is the blessed transmogrification of
sound. And sound is sacred because all vibrations, audible or
inaudible, are in miraculous harmony with that holiest of all
phenomena, silence!"</p>

<p>"Help!" whispered Ledyard to Cairns, with resignation.</p>

<p>"Any audible rate of regular air vibrations is a musical note,"
continued Mr. Sissly. "If you double that vibratory speed, you
have the first note of the octave above it. Now, the spectrum
band is the colour counterpart of the musical octave; the ether
vibrates with double the speed at the <em>violet</em> end of the
spectrum band that it does at the opposite extremity, or <em>red</em>
end. Let me show you the chromatic scales in colour and music&mdash;the
latter the equivalent of the former, revealing how the intervals
correspond when C represents red." And he flashed upon the screen
a series of brilliant colours.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, "that it is with colour as it is with sound&mdash;there
is a long range of vibrations below and above the first and last
visible colour and the first and last audible note&mdash;a long, long
range beyond compass of the human eye and ear. Probably the music
of the spheres is composed of such harmonies," he simpered.</p>

<p>"Modern occidental music is evolved in conformity with an arbitrary
scale," he resumed earnestly. "An octave consists of seven whole
tones and five half-tones. Combinations and sequences of notes
or tints affect us emotionally&mdash;pleasurably when harmonious, painfully
when discordant. But," and his voice shook with soulful emotion,
"the holiest and the most precious alliance ever dreamed of beyond
the Gates of Heaven lies in the sacred intermingling of harmonious
colour and harmonious silence. Let me play for you, upon my colour
organ, my soundless symphony which I call 'Weather.' Always in
the world there will be weather. We have it constantly; there
is so much of it that nobody knows how much there is; and I do
not see very clearly how there ever could be any less than there
is. Weather, then, being the only earthly condition which is eternal,
becomes precious beyond human comprehension; and I have tried
to interpret it as a symphony of silence and of colour divinely
intermingled."</p>

<p>Ledyard whispered to Betty Barkley: "I'll go mad and bite if
he says another word!"</p>

<p>She cautioned him with a light touch of her gloved hand, and
strove very hard to remain serious as Mr. Sissly minced over to
his "organ," seated himself, and gazed upward.</p>

<p>All at once every light in the house went out.</p>

<p>For a while the great screen remained invisible, then a faint
sheen possessed its surface, blotted out at eccentric intervals
by a deep and thunderous tint which finally absorbed it and slowly
became a coldly profound and depthless blue.</p>

<p>The blue was not permanent; almost imperceptible pulsations were
stirring and modifying it toward a warmer and less decisive hue,
and through it throbbed and ebbed elusive sensations of palest
turquoise, primrose and shell-pink. This waned and deepened into
a yellow which threatened to become orange.</p>

<p>Suddenly all was washed out in unaccented grey; the grey gradually
became instinct with rose and gold; the gold was split by a violet
streak; then virile scarlet tumbled through crashing scales of
green, amethyst, crimson, into a chaos of chromatic dissonance,
and vanished engulfed in shimmering darkness.</p>

<p>The lights flashed up, disclosing Mr. Sissly, very pale and damp
of features, facing the footlights again.</p>

<p>"That," he faltered, amid a stillness so profound that it seemed
to fill the ear like a hollow roar,&mdash;"that is weather. If you
approve it, the most precious expression of your sympathy will
be absolute silence."</p>

<p>Fortunately, not even Reggie Ledyard dropped.</p>

<p>Mr. Sissly passed a lank and lily hand across his large pale
eyes.</p>

<p>"Like the Japanese," he lisped, "I bring to you my most precious
thought-treasures one at a time&mdash;and never more than two between
the rising of the orb of day and the veiling of it at eventide.
I offer you, on the altar of my colour organ, a transposition
of Von Schwiggle's symphony in A minor; and I can only say that
it is replete with a meaning so exquisitely precious that no human
intelligence has yet penetrated it."</p>

<p>Out went the lights. Presently the screen became visible. Upon
it there seemed to be no colour, no hint of any tint, no quality,
no value. It was merely visible, and remained so for three mortal
minutes. Then the lights broke out, revealing Mr. Sissly half
fainting at his organ, and two young women in Greek robes waving
bunches of violets at him. And the curtain fell.</p>

<p>"There only remains," whispered Ledyard, "the funny-house for
me."</p>

<p>"If you make me laugh I'll never forgive you," Mrs. Barkley warned
him under her breath. "But&mdash;oh, do look at Mrs. Hammerton!"</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah's visage resembled that of a cornered and enraged
mink surrounded by enemies.</p>

<p>"If that man comes near me," she said to Desboro, "I shall destroy
him with hatpins. You'd better keep him away. I'm morally and
nervously disorganised."</p>

<p>Sissly had come off the stage and now stood in the wide aisle,
surrounded by the earnest and intellectual womanhood of Westchester,
eagerly seeking more light.</p>

<p>But there was little in Mr. Sissly's large and washed-out eyes;
even less, perhaps, than illuminated his intellect. He gazed wanly
upon adoration, edging his way toward Miss Frere, who, at dinner,
had rashly admitted that she understood him.</p>

<p>"Was it satisfying?" he lisped, when he had attained to her vicinity.</p>

<p>"It was most&mdash;remarkable," she said, bewildered. "So absolutely
new to me that I can find nothing as yet to say to you, except
thank you."</p>

<p>"Why say it? Why not merely look it? Your silence would be very,
very precious to me," he said in a low voice. And the stately
Miss Frere blushed.</p>

<p>The audience, under the stimulus of the lights, recovered very
quickly from its semi-stupor, and everybody was now discussing
with animation the unique experience of the past half-hour. New
York chattered; Westchester discussed; that was the difference.
Both had expected a new kind of cabaret show; neither had found
the weird performance disappointing. Flippant and unintellectual
young men felt safe in the certainty that neither their pretty
partners nor the more serious representatives of the substantial
county knew one whit more about soundless symphonies than did
they.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She lost herself in a dreamy Bavarian folk-song"]</p>

<p>So laughter and noise filled the armoury with a gaily subdued
uproar, silenced only when Katharine Frere's harp was brought
in, and the tall, handsome girl, without any preliminaries, went
forward and seated herself, drew the gilded instrument back against
her right shoulder, set her feet to the pedals, her fingers to
the strings, and wandered capriciously from <em>Le Donne Curiose</em>
and the far, brief echoes of its barcarolle, into <em>Koenigskinder</em>,
and on through <em>Versiegelt</em>, till she lost herself in a
dreamy Bavarian folk-song which died out as sunset dies on the
far alms of the Red Valepp.</p>

<p>Great applause; no cabaret yet. The audience looked at the programme
and read:</p>

<p>"A Thousand Years <em>B.C. ... </em>Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>And Reggie Ledyard was becoming restless, thinking perhaps that
a little ragtime of the spheres might melt the rapidly forming
intellectual ice, and was saying so to anybody who'd listen, when
ding-dong-dang! ding-dong! echoed the oriental gong. Out went
the lights, the curtain split open and was gathered at the wings;
a shimmering radiance grew upon the stage disclosing a huge gold
and green dragon of porcelain on its faïence pedestal. And there,
high cradled between the forepaws of the ancient Mongolian monster,
sat a slim figure in silken robes of turquoise, rose, and scarlet,
a Chinese lute across her knees, slim feet pendant below the rainbow
skirt.</p>

<p>Her head-dress was wrought fantastically of open-work gold, inlaid
with a thousand tiny metallic blue feathers, accented by fiery
gems; across the silky folds of her slitted tunic were embroidered
in iris tints the single-winged birds whirling around each other
between floating clouds; little clog-like shoes of silk and gold,
embroidered with moss-green arabesques inset with orange and scarlet,
shod the feet.</p>

<p>Ancient Cathay, exquisitely, immortally young, sat in jewelled
silks and flowers under the huge and snarling dragon. And presently,
string by string, her idle lute awoke, picked with the plectrum,
note after note in strange and unfamiliar intervals; and, looking
straight in front of her, she sang at random, to "the sorrows
of her lute," verses from "The Maker of Moons," sung by Chinese
lovers a thousand years ago:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Like to a Dragon in the Sky<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce Sun flames from East to West;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower of Love within my breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blooms only when the Moon is high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thou art nigh."

</p>
</div>
<p>The dropping notes of her lute answered her, rippled on, and
were lost like a little rill trickling into darkness.</p>

<p>  "The Day burns like a Dragon's flight   Until Thou comest in
the night   With thy cool Moon of gold-  Then I unfold."</p>

<p>A faint stirring of the strings, silence; then she struck with
her plectrum the weird opening chord of that sixth century song
called "The Night Revel"; and sang to the end the ancient verses
set to modern music by an unknown composer:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Along the River scarlet Lanterns glimmer,<br/>
Where gilded Boats and darkling Waters shimmer;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter with Singing blends;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Love begins and ends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever with a sigh&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whispered sigh.

</p>
<p>
"In fire-lit pools the crimson Carp are swirling;<br/>
The painted peacocks shining plumes are furling;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the torch-light by the Gate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand Lutes begin the Fête<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one triumphant Cry!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should Love sigh?"

</p>
</div>
<p>The curtain slowly closed on the echoes of her lute; there came
an interval of absolute silence, then an uproar of cries and of
people getting to their feet, calling out: "Go on! Go on! Don't
stop!" No applause except this excited clamour for more, and the
racket of moving chairs.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" muttered Captain Herrendene. "Did you ever see anything
as beautiful as that girl?"</p>

<p>And: "Where did she learn such things?" demanded people excitedly
of one another. "It must be the real business! How does she know?"</p>

<p>The noise became louder and more emphatic; calls for her reappearance
redoubled and persisted until the gong again sounded, the lights
went out, and the curtains twitched once more and parted.</p>

<p>She slid down from her cradled perch between the forelegs of
the shadowy dragon and came to the edge of the footlights.</p>

<p>"I was going to show you one or two jades from the Desboro collection,
and tell you a little about them," she began, "but my lute and
I will say for you another song of ancient China, if you like.
It was made by Kao-Shih about seven hundred years after the birth
of Christ. He was one of the T'ang poets&mdash;and not a very cheerful
one. This is his song."</p>

<p>And she recited for them: "There was a king of Liang."</p>

<p>After that she stepped back; but they would not have it, to the
point of enthusiastic rudeness.</p>

<p>She recited for them Mêng Hao-Jan's "A Friend Expected," from
"The Maker of Moons," and the quatrains of the lovely, naïve little
"Spring Dream," written by Ts'en-Ts'an in the eighth century.</p>

<p>But they demanded still more. She laid aside her lute and intoned
for them the noble lines of China's most famous writer:</p>

<p>  "Thou that hast seen six kingdoms pass away&#11834;"</p>

<p>Then, warming to her audience, and herself thrilled with the
spirit of the ancient splendour, she moved forward in her whispering
silks, and, slightly bending, her finger lifted like one who hushes
children with a magic tale, she spoke to them of Fei-yen, mistress
of the Emperor; and told them how T'ai-Chên became an empress;
sang for them the song of Yu Lao, the "Song of the Moon Moth":</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The great Night Moth that bears her name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is winged in green,<br/>
Pale as the June moon's silver flame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silken sheen:<br/>
No other flame they know, these twain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where dark dews rain&mdash;<br/>
This great Night Moth that bears her name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my sweet Queen;<br/>
So let me light my Lantern flame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathe Her name."

</p>
</div>
<p>She held her audience in the palm of her smooth little hand;
she knew it, and tasted power. She told them of the Blue Mongol's
song, reciting:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"From the Gray Plains I ride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the gray hawks wheel,<br/>
In armour of lacquered hide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabre and shield of steel;<br/>
The lance in my stirrup rattles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the quiver and bow at my back<br/>
Clatter! I sing of Battles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Cities put to the sack!<br/>
Where is the Lord of the West,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Emperor's son?<br/>
I swung my Mongol sabre;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the Dead are one.<br/>
For the tawny Lion of the Iort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sun of the World are One!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Then she told them the old Chinese tale called "The Never-Ending
Wrong"&mdash;the immortal tragedy of that immortal maid, "a reed in
motion and a rose in flame," from where she alights "in the white
hibiscus bower" to where "death is drumming at the door" and "ten
thousand battle-chariots on the wing" come clashing to a halt;
and the trapped King, her lover, sends her forth</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Lily pale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between tall avenues of spears, to die."

</p>
</div>
<p>And so, amid "the sullen soldiery," white as a flower, and all
alone in soul, she "shines through tall avenues of spears, to
die."</p>

<p>"The King has sought the darkness of his hands," standing in
stricken grief, then turns and gazes at what lies there at his
feet amid its scattered</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"&mdash;<em>Ornaments of gold,</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>One with the dust; and none to gather them;&mdash;</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hair-pins of jade and many a costly gem,</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Kingfishers' wings and golden beads scarce cold.</em>"

</p>
</div>
<p>Lingering a moment in the faint reflection of the low-turned
footlights, she stood looking out over the silent audience; and
perhaps her eyes found what they had been seeking, for she smiled
and stepped back as the curtain closed. And no uproar of applause
could lure her forth again until the lights had been long blazing
and the dancers were whirling over the armoury floor, and she
had washed the paint from lid and lip and cheek, and put off her
rustling antique silken splendour to bewitch another century scarce
begun.</p>

<p>Desboro, waiting at her dressing-room door for her, led her forth.</p>

<p>"You have done so much for me," he whispered. "Is there anything
in all the world I can do for you, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She was laughing, flushed by the flattery and compliments from
every side, but she heard him; and after a moment her face altered
subtly. But she answered lightly:</p>

<p>"Can I ask for more than a dance or two with you? Is not that
honour enough?" Her voice was gay and mocking, but the smile had
faded from eye and lip; only the curved sweetness of the mouth
remained.</p>

<p>They caught the music's beat and swung away together among the
other dancers, he piloting her with great adroitness between the
avenues of armoured figures.</p>

<p>When he had the opportunity, he said: "What may I send you that
you would care for?"</p>

<p>"Send me?" She laughed lightly again. "Let me see! Well, then,
perhaps you may one day send me&mdash;send me forth 'between tall avenues
of spears, to die.'"</p>

<p>"What!" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"The song is still ringing in my head&mdash;that's all. Send me any
inexpensive thing you wish&mdash;a white carnation &mdash;I don't really
care&mdash;" she looked away from him&mdash;"as long as it comes from you."</p>
