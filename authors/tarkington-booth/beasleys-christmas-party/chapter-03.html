<p>I do not know why it should have astonished me to find that Miss
Apperthwaite was a teacher of mathematics except that (to my inexperienced
eye) she didn't look it. She looked more like Charlotte Corday!</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of seeing her opposite me at lunch the next
day (when Mr. Dowden kept me occupied with Spencerville politics,
obviously from fear that I would break out again), but no stroll
in the yard with her rewarded me afterward, as I dimly hoped,
for she disappeared before I left the table, and I did not see
her again for a fortnight. On week-days she did not return to
the house for lunch, my only meal at Mrs. Apperthwaite's (I dined
at a restaurant near the "Despatch"  office), and she was out
of town for a little visit, her mother informed us, over the following
Saturday and Sunday. She was not altogether out of my thoughts,
however&mdash;indeed, she almost divided them with the Honorable David
Beasley.</p>

<p>A better view which I was afforded of this gentleman did not
lessen my interest in him; increased it rather; it also served
to make the extraordinary didoes of which he had been the virtuoso
and I the audience more than ever profoundly inexplicable. My
glimpse of him in the lighted doorway had given me the vaguest
impression of his appearance, but one afternoon&mdash;a few days after
my interview with Miss Apperthwaite &mdash;I was starting for
the office and met him full-face-on as he was turning in at his
gate. I took as careful invoice of him as I could without conspicuously
glaring.</p>

<p>There was something remarkably "taking," as we say, about this
man&mdash;something easy and genial and quizzical and careless. He
was the kind of person you <em>LIKE </em>to meet on the street;
whose cheerful passing sends you on feeling indefinably a little
gayer than you did. He was tall, thin&mdash;even gaunt, perhaps&mdash;and
his face was long, rather pale, and shrewd and gentle; something
in its oddity not unremindful of the late Sol Smith Russell. His
hat was tilted back a little, the slightest bit to one side, and
the sparse, brownish hair above his high forehead was going to
be gray before long. He looked about forty.</p>

<p>The truth is, I had expected to see a cousin german to Don Quixote;
I had thought to detect signs and gleams of wildness, however
slight&mdash;something a little "off." One glance of that kindly and
humorous eye told me such expectation had been nonsense. Odd he
might have been &mdash;Gadzooks! he looked it&mdash;but "queer"? Never.
The fact that Miss Apperthwaite could picture such a man as this
"sitting and sitting and sitting" himself into any form of mania
or madness whatever spoke loudly of her own imagination, indeed!
The key to "Simpledoria" was to be sought under some other mat.</p>

<p>... As I began to know some of my co-laborers on the "Despatch,"
and to pick up acquaintances, here and there, about town, I sometimes
made Mr. Beasley the subject of inquiry. Everybody knew him. "Oh
yes, I know Dave <em>BEASLEY!" </em>would come the reply, nearly
always with a chuckling sort of laugh. I gathered that he had
a name for "easy-going" which amounted to eccentricity. It was
said that what the ward-heelers and camp-followers got out of
him in campaign times made the political managers cry. He was
the first and readiest prey for every fraud and swindler that
came to Wainwright, I heard, and yet, in spite of this and of
his hatred of "speech-making" ("He's as silent as Grant!" said
one informant), he had a large practice, and was one of the most
successful lawyers in the state.</p>

<p>One story they told of him (or, as they were more apt to put
it, "on"  him) was repeated so often that I saw it had become
one of the town's traditions. One bitter evening in February,
they related, he was approached upon the street by a ragged, whining,
and shivering old reprobate, notorious for the various ingenuities
by which he had worn out the patience of the charity organizations.
He asked Beasley for a dime. Beasley had no money in his pockets,
but gave the man his overcoat, went home without any himself,
and spent six weeks in bed with a bad case of pneumonia as the
direct result. His beneficiary sold the overcoat, and invested
the proceeds in a five-day's spree, in the closing scenes of which
a couple of brickbats were featured to high, spectacular effect.
One he sent through a jeweller's show-window in an attempt to
intimidate some wholly imaginary pursuers, the other he projected
at a perfectly actual policeman who was endeavoring to soothe
him. The victim of Beasley's charity and the officer were then
borne to the hospital in company.</p>

<p>It was due in part to recollections of this legend and others
of a similar character that people laughed when they said, "Oh
yes, I know Dave <em>BEASLEY</em>!"</p>

<p>Altogether, I should say, Beasley was about the most popular
man in Wainwright. I could discover nowhere anything, however,
to shed the faintest light upon the mystery of Bill Hammersley
and Simpledoria. It was not until the Sunday of Miss Apperthwaite's
absence that the revelation came.</p>

<p>That afternoon I went to call upon the widow of a second-cousin
of mine; she lived in a cottage not far from Mrs. Apperthwaite's,
upon the same street. I found her sitting on a pleasant veranda,
with boxes of flowering plants along the railing, though Indian
summer was now close upon departure. She was rocking meditatively,
and held a finger in a morocco volume, apparently of verse, though
I suspected she had been better entertained in the observation
of the people and vehicles decorously passing along the sunlit
thoroughfare within her view.</p>

<p>We exchanged inevitable questions and news of mutual relatives;
I had told her how I liked my work and what I thought of Wainwright,
and she was congratulating me upon having found so pleasant a
place to live as Mrs. Apperthwaite's, when she interrupted herself
to smile and nod a cordial greeting to two gentlemen driving by
in a phaeton. They waved their hats to her gayly, then leaned
back comfortably against the cushions&mdash;and if ever two men were
obviously and incontestably on the best of terms with each other,
<em>THESE </em>two were. They were David Beasley and Mr. Dowden.
"I do wish," said my cousin, resuming her rocking&mdash;"I do wish
dear David Beasley would get a new trap of some kind; that old
phaeton of his is a disgrace! I suppose you haven't met him? Of
course, living at Mrs. Apperthwaite's, you wouldn't be apt to."</p>

<p>"But what is he doing with Mr. Dowden?" I asked.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyebrows. "Why&mdash;taking him for a drive, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No. I mean&mdash;how do they happen to be together?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't they be? They're old friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They <em>ARE!" </em>And, in answer to her look of surprise,
I explained that I had begun to speak of Beasley at Mrs. Apperthwaite's,
and described the abruptness with which Dowden had changed the
subject.</p>

<p>"I see," my cousin nodded, comprehendingly. "That's simple enough.
George Dowden didn't want you to talk of Beasley <em>THERE. I
</em>suppose it may have been a little embarrassing for everybody&mdash;especially
if Ann Apperthwaite heard you."</p>

<p>"Ann? That's Miss Apperthwaite? Yes; I was speaking directly
to her. Why <em>SHOULDN'T </em>she have heard me? She talked of
him herself a little later&mdash;and at some length, too."</p>

<p>"She <em>DID!" </em>My cousin stopped rocking, and fixed me with
her glittering eye. "Well, of all!"</p>

<p>"Is it so surprising?"</p>

<p>The lady gave her boat to the waves again. "Ann Apperthwaite
thinks about him still!" she said, with something like vindictiveness.
"I've always suspected it. She thought you were new to the place
and didn't know anything about it all, or anybody to mention it
to. That's it!"</p>

<p>"I'm still new to the place," I urged, "and still don't know
anything about it all."</p>

<p>"They used to be engaged," was her succinct and emphatic answer.</p>

<p>I found it but too illuminating. "Oh, oh!" I cried. "I <em>WAS
</em>an innocent, wasn't I?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad she <em>DOES </em>think of him," said my cousin. "It
serves her right. I only hope HE won't find it out, because he's
a poor, faithful creature; he'd jump at the chance to take her
back&mdash;and she doesn't deserve him."</p>

<p>"How long has it been," I asked, "since they used to be engaged?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a good while&mdash;five or six years ago, I think&mdash;maybe more;
time skips along. Ann Apperthwaite's no chicken, you know." (Such
was the lady's expression.) "They got engaged just after she came
home from college, and of all the idiotically romantic girls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she's a teacher," I interrupted, "of mathematics."</p>

<p>"Yes." She nodded wisely. "I always thought that explained it:
the romance is a reaction from the algebra. I never knew a person
connected with mathematics or astronomy or statistics, or any
of those exact things, who didn't have a crazy streak in 'em SOMEwhere.
They've got to blow off steam and be foolish to make up for putting
in so much of their time at hard sense. But don't you think that
I dislike Ann Apperthwaite. She's always been one of my best friends;
that's why I feel at liberty to abuse her&mdash;and I always will abuse
her when I think how she treated poor David Beasley."</p>

<p>"How did she treat him?"</p>

<p>"Threw him over out of a clear sky one night, that's all. Just
sent him home and broke his heart; that is, it would have been
broken if he'd had any kind of disposition except the one the
Lord blessed him with&mdash;just all optimism and cheerfulness and
make-the-best-of-it-ness! He's never cared for anybody else, and
I guess he never will."</p>

<p>"What did she do it for?"</p>

<p>"<em>NOTHING!" </em>My cousin shot the indignant word from her
lips. "Nothing in the wide <em>WORLD</em>!"</p>

<p>"But there must have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she interrupted, "and tell me if you ever heard
anything queerer in your life. They'd been engaged &mdash;Heaven
knows how long&mdash;over two years; probably nearer three&mdash;and always
she kept putting it off; wouldn't begin to get ready, wouldn't
set a day for the wedding. Then Mr. Apperthwaite died, and left
her and her mother stranded high and dry with nothing to live
on. David had everything in the world to give her&mdash;and <em>STILL
</em>she wouldn't! And then, one day, she came up here and told
me she'd broken it off. Said she couldn't stand it to be engaged
to David Beasley another minute!"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Because"&mdash;my cousin's tone was shrill with her despair of expressing
the satire she would have put into it&mdash;"because, she said he was
a man of no imagination!"</p>

<p>"She still says so," I remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Then it's time she got a little imagination herself!" snapped
my companion. "David Beasley's the quietest man God has made,
but everybody knows what he IS! There are some rare people in
this world that aren't all <em>TALK; </em>there are some still
rarer ones that scarcely ever talk at all&mdash;and David Beasley's
one of them. I don't know whether it's because he can't talk,
or if he can and hates to; I only know he doesn't. And I'm glad
of it, and thank the Lord he's put a few like that into this talky
world! David Beasley's smile is better than acres of other people's
talk. My Providence! Wouldn't anybody, just to look at him, know
that he does better than talk? He <em>THINKS! </em>The trouble
with Ann Apperthwaite was that she was too young to see it. She
was so full of novels and poetry and dreaminess and highfalutin
nonsense she couldn't see <em>ANYTHING </em>as it really was.
She'd study her mirror, and see such a heroine of romance there
that she just couldn't bear to have a fiance who hadn't any chance
of turning out to be the crown-prince of Kenosha in disguise!
At the very least, to suit <em>HER </em>he'd have had to wear
a 'well-trimmed Vandyke' and coo sonnets in the gloaming, or read
On a Balcony to her by a red lamp.</p>

<p>"Poor David! Outside of his law-books, I don't believe he's ever
read anything but Robinson Crusoe and the Bible and Mark Twain.
Oh, you should have heard her talk about it!&mdash;'I couldn't bear
it another day,' she said, 'I couldn't <em>STAND </em>it! In all
the time I've known him I don't believe he's ever asked me a single
question&mdash;except when he asked if I'd marry him. He never says
<em>ANYTHING&mdash;</em>never speaks at <em>ALL!' </em>she said. 'You
don't know a blessing when you see it,' I told her. 'Blessing!'
she said. 'There's nothing IN the man! He has no <em>DEPTHS! </em>He
hasn't any more imagination than the chair he sits and sits and
sits in! Half the time he answers what I say to him by nodding
and saying 'um-hum,' with that same old foolish, contented smile
of his. I'd have gone <em>MAD </em>if it had lasted any longer!'
I asked her if she thought married life consisted very largely
of conversations between husband and wife; and she answered that
even married life ought to have some <em>POETRY </em>in it. 'Some
romance,' she said, 'some soul! And he just comes and sits,' she
said, 'and sits and sits and sits and sits! And I can't bear it
any longer, and I've told him so.'"</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Beasley," I said.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> think, 'Poor Ann Apperthwaite!'" retorted my cousin.
"I'd like to know if there's anything <em>NICER </em>than just
to sit and sit and sit and sit with as lovely a man as that&mdash;a
man who understands things, and thinks and listens and smiles&mdash;instead
of everlastingly talking!"</p>

<p>"As it happens," I remarked, "I've heard Mr. Beasley talk."</p>

<p>"Why, of course he talks," she returned, "when there's any real
use in it. And he talks to children; he's <em>THAT </em>kind of
man."</p>

<p>"I meant a particular instance," I began; meaning to see if she
could give me any clew to Bill Hammersley and Simpledoria, but
at that moment the gate clicked under the hand of another caller.
My cousin rose to greet him; and presently I took my leave without
having been able to get back upon the subject of Beasley.</p>

<p>Thus, once more baffled, I returned to Mrs. Apperthwaite's&mdash;and
within the hour came into full possession of the very heart of
that dark and subtle mystery which overhung the house next door
and so perplexed my soul.</p>
