<p><em>DEERFOOT </em>waited till sure of the exhaustion of the stallion.
Then while he was still galloping in his tired way, he slipped
from his back and, dropping to the ground, began running beside
him.</p>

<p>The instant the horse felt himself free of his master he dashed
off at the highest bent of his speed, as if determined to be rid
of the dreaded one at whatever cost. You know what a wonderful
runner the young Shawanoe was, and he now put forth every ounce
of energy at his command. The sight was thrilling. The incomparable
youth was making a race with the black stallion, and the exhibition
was marvelous. Ah, if you could have been there with a camera
to take a snapshot of the struggle!</p>

<p>Now, no man ever lived who could outrun a blooded or trained
horse. It would be absurd for me to pretend that the Shawanoe
youth, with all his marvelous fleetness, could outspeed a wild
animal like the black stallion. It would have been idiotic for
him to attempt it, unless his rival was so handicapped that a
marked advantage rested with the biped. I have shown that Deerfoot
possessed that advantage in the fatigue of the steed. Moreover,
as I have made clear in another story concerning the young Shawanoe,
he was able to keep up the exertion longer than a horse, and had
proved it by running one down when each started fresh.</p>

<p>He had no fear, therefore, when he dropped off the animal’s back,
nor did he feel any misgiving because, in the first minute or
two, the stallion slightly drew away from him. The youth knew
he could run him down, and he meant to do it.</p>

<p>The horse gained until he was fifty feet in advance. The consciousness
of his advantage nerved him to the utmost. With head aloft and
the sweat showing in foam where the limbs rubbed the body, he
kept an eye on the fearful thing he seemed to have shaken off.
There he was, a short distance to the rear, and a little to one
side. The form slowly receded, but while the horse was doing his
best it began to close the gap between them. The brute saw it
drawing steadily nearer, with the resistless certainty of fate.
The Shawanoe’s feet doubled under him so rapidly that the eye
would have found it hard to see the twinkling moccasins. He was
doing his very best, and you have been able to form some idea
of what <em>that</em> was. Not the least remarkable feature of
all was that Deerfoot did not seem to be affected in the least
by his terrific exertions. He breathed no faster than when walking,
and was capable of keeping up the tremendous run for a time that,
were it named, would sound incredible.</p>

<p>Near and nearer drew the dreaded figure, and the stallion, if
capable of such an emotion, must have felt the chill of despair
creeping through his frame. But it was useless to fight against
fate, and he put forth no further effort, even when the pursuer
drew up alongside, and, repeating his remarkable bound, once more
dropped astride the perspiring body.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now changed his treatment of the exhausted stallion.
Instead of speaking sharply and beating his heels against his
sides, he patted his neck, rubbed a palm gently down its side
and uttered soothing expressions. It was hardly to be expected
that the brute would understand this, for it was all new and strange
to him, but the fiercest wild animal instinctively knows the difference
between brutality and kindness. Something within the horse responded
to these advances, and by and by he dropped to a walk and made
no effort to unseat or harm his rider.</p>

<p>Deerfoot’s wish was to return to his friends, for they must have
been left many miles to the rear, and, though they were quite
likely to follow him, they must still be separated from him by
a long distance. He therefore tried to turn the stallion the other
way. This proved harder than he anticipated. He first drew the
nose around, but the animal kept going straight on as before,
even with his head awry. Then the youth slipped to the ground,
placed himself in front of his charge, and flung up his arms.
The stallion stopped, made a motion as if to bite him, and then,
frightened by his own temerity, paused. Still he refused to change
his course.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was working patiently when the horse turned to one
side, pricked up his ears and started off at a trot. The youth
suspected the meaning of this action: the brute had scented water,
of which he must have felt the need, and was hurrying to it. Instead
of remounting Deerfoot ran ahead of the animal, and glancing over
his shoulder to make sure he was followed, broke into a lope which
he accommodated to the speed of his pursuer.</p>

<p>The youth was right in his supposition. Not far in advance, in
a slight depression of the prairie, he caught the gleam of water,
marking where a small tributary of the North Fork flowed from
the mountainous regions on the west. Increasing his speed, the
Shawanoe reached the water first, and, stooping down, drank his
fill of the clear current, which still retained much of the coolness
of the elevated regions whence it came.</p>

<p>The stallion broke into a faster gait as he drew near, and pushed
his nose into the stream beside the youth and drank his fill.
It was odd, when he had finished, to see him raise his head, with
the current dripping from his frothy mouth, and look earnestly
at the youth. Had he been gifted with the power of speech he probably
would have said:</p>

<p>"I have come across many queer creatures while roving the plains,
but you are the queerest of them all. You don’t look as if you
would stand any show in a fight with me. I’ve beaten many rivals
and am ready to beat more, but you’re too much for me. I take
off my hat to you, and now what do you intend to do with me? If
I get the chance to lay you out, <em>I’ll do it</em>, but I’m
afraid I won’t get the chance."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was on the alert, suspecting the stallion would
try some trick after refreshing himself with water. In turning
away from the stream, the head of the steed happened to point
eastward, the direction in which Deerfoot wished to go. He again
vaulted upon his back and the brute continued on that course.</p>

<p>What the rider feared was that the stallion would set out to
find the drove that had deserted him. This could not be permitted,
for it would ruin the plan the Shawanoe had in mind. He expected
to have another battle with his prize, and held himself alert
for it, but he was pleased and surprised by the docility of his
captive. This may have been partly due to his exhaustion, or who
shall say that the brute did not wish for time in which to formulate
some scheme for overthrowing the being that had outwitted him!</p>

<p>Deerfoot kept up his caresses and gentle treatment of the prisoner.
He strove to familiarize him with his voice and to win his confidence.
He had proved he was master of the terrible brute, and the task
was now to convince the brute that he was his friend. This was
sure to be hard, and he could not hope to succeed for awhile to
come.</p>

<p>They had traveled a few miles when once more Deerfoot slipped
to the ground. As he landed he walked close to the shoulder of
the horse and patted and addressed him as he would a child whom
he loved. The stallion at first resented the familiarity. He shook
his head as if displeased, edged away and finally snapped at the
youth. The Shawanoe knew it would not do to let the animal forget
who was master. So, when the black muzzle and gleaming teeth showed,
he slapped his nose and spoke brusquely to him. This was followed
by more caresses and soothing expressions. By and by the horse
ceased showing resentment. Then Deerfoot remounted as before.</p>

<p>Thus the strange acquaintanceship progressed. It was impossible
for the wild stallion to become tamed in a few hours, though we
have professors in these times who conquer the most vicious beasts
in less than a single hour, but sometimes the horses do not stay
conquered. It can be said that the youth and horse became quite
intimate as they journeyed together, and the youth had good reason
to believe that ere long they would become friends.</p>

<p>As he had supposed, Mul-tal-la and the boys did not remain idle
after the Shawanoe’s hurricane departure. Hardly had he vanished
in the horizon when the three set out to follow him, pressing
their animals hard. While it cannot be said that they were free
from anxiety for their friend, they were not much alarmed. There
could be no after-contest that would be fiercer than that which
had taken place under their very eyes, and they had come to ask
one another whether there was any situation in which the young
Shawanoe would not be well able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>At every few paces George Shelton brought his glass into use
and scanned the prairie in advance, not forgetting to bestow a
glance now and then in other directions, for there was no saying
what whim would control the black stallion.</p>

<p>"I see them!" suddenly called George. "They are coming this way!"</p>

<p>"Is Deerfoot on the horse?"</p>

<p>"Of course; you don’t suppose he would walk, do you?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t know but that the stallion was so tired Deerfoot would
have to carry him," was the innocent answer. "Let me have a squint."</p>

<p>Victor and Mul-tal-la each descried the animal, but since he
was in a direct line and held his head high it was some minutes
before they could make sure that the Shawanoe was on his back.
It was the Blackfoot who announced that he was riding the captured
horse at a walk.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot had descried his friends before this, and he now
showed his mastery over the animal by forcing him to a moderate
gallop, which was kept up till the two parties had come within
a few rods of each other. Then the stallion stopped and showed
renewed excitement. It was due to the nearness of the other horses,
whom he did not like, and he repelled a closer acquaintance.</p>

<p>Three of the animals were indifferent and displayed no curiosity,
but Zigzag seemed to think he was excepted from the disfavor of
the captive. He pointed his nose toward him, whinnied, and then
advanced rapidly. Mul-tal-la was about to interfere when Deerfoot
called to him not to do so.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe did all he could to quiet his horse, but with the
light of mischief in his eyes watched the meeting between the
two brutes. Zigzag came right on, with nose thrust out, as if
he intended to kiss the other, who grew more and more displeased.
Suddenly the stallion whirled around—his rider not trying to restrain
him—and let fly with both heels, which, had they landed fairly,
would have injured Zigzag, but a portion of the bulging pack interposed.
Zigzag was sent backward for several steps, and so shaken that
he was disgusted. The snubbing was too direct to be misunderstood,
and he sullenly wheeled and rejoined his own friends, quite content
to leave the aristocratic interloper to himself.</p>

<p>All four laughed, for there was a humanness about the whole thing
that was amusing. The boys and the Blackfoot were delighted, while
the expression of Deerfoot left no doubt of his pleasure over
the prize he had gained. Many a wild horse had been brought to
earth by the skilfully thrown lasso or riata, hobbled and mastered
by the horseman who had his own animal to give him aid, but whoever
knew of such a thing being done by a single person without help
in any form whatever! And yet you have been shown that that was
precisely what was done by Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>Mul-tal-la quite overwhelmed his youthful friend with praise.
Addressing him in the tongue of the Blackfeet—for he did not wish
the boys to understand his earnest words—he declared that the
feat was one that no other living man could perform. There were
fine horsemen among the different tribes, and Mul-tal-la had witnessed
many of their exhibitions of skill, but there was none to be compared
with Deerfoot. The dusky fellow was specially ardent in praising
the deftness, power and quickness with which the Shawanoe had
thrown the wild stallion without bridle or saddle or aid of any
kind.</p>

<p>"See the fellow blush!" said the grinning Victor to his brother.
"That shows that Mul-tal-la is praising Deerfoot. I never saw
an Indian blush, for it’s too much like a negro trying to do it,
but Deerfoot can’t help showing his confusion."</p>

<p>"There," added George, watching the countenance of their friend,
"he has told Mul-tal-la to stop, and he daren’t refuse. If I had
half the smartness of Deerfoot I should expect to sit down and
hear everybody praise me. They couldn’t help it."</p>

<p>"I don’t know about that. <em>I</em> don’t wait for folks to
praise <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>"Because you would grow gray before they did it. Hark!"</p>

<p>Sitting astride of the motionless stallion their friend called:</p>

<p>"Will my brothers give Deerfoot a name for his horse?"</p>

<p>"Yes," George hastened to answer; "call him Dewdrop."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe shook his head. The inappropriateness of the name
was apparent, even to the Blackfoot. Indeed, the proposer was
in jest.</p>

<p>"I have it," said Victor. "Make it Whirlwind."</p>

<p>"My brother speaks with the words of wisdom," replied the Shawanoe.
"His name shall be Whirlwind, though it would not be bad if it
were Thunderbolt, like the steed that was conquered many moons
ago."</p>
