<p>"Only two weeks more of vacation," sighed Tabitha, sinking wearily
into the hammock one August afternoon, and looking longingly away
to the west where the train was just puffing into view.  "I never
dreamed we should be here all summer when I offered to take care
of the kidlets for Mrs. McKittrick."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?" asked Gloriana, glancing up from her sewing
in surprise at the tone of Tabitha's voice.</p>

<p>"No, oh, no!" she answered hastily, for fear her companion would
think she was complaining.  "I don't regret staying here at all,
for that was the only way Mr. McKittrick could get well; but still
&mdash;I should have enjoyed getting a peek at the ocean again,
and having a good time all around, like we'd surely have had with
Myra."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would have been lovely," sighed Gloriana, who could
not help feeling sorry that their vacation had not turned out
as they had planned, although she admired Tabitha more than ever
because of the unselfishness which had prompted her to shoulder
such a responsibility in the first place.</p>

<p>"You see, I never have spent the summer at the seashore," Tabitha
continued; "nor anywhere else, for that matter, except here in
Silver Bow, since we came here to live; and I had planned so much
on Myra's invitation.  She is such a whirlwind for fun."</p>

<p>"It's too bad Miss Davis didn't let us know any sooner that she
didn't intend to come back to the desert till fall.  Perhaps we
could have found someone else&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not.  It's awfully hard to get anyone dependable
away out here.  <em>Hired help</em> is simply out of the question. 
They think Silver Bow is beyond the bounds of civilization, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"I don't blame them," began Gloriana impetuously; then blushed
furiously, and stammered, "Oh, what did I say?  What will you
think of me?  I didn't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did mean it," laughed her companion.  "And I don't
blame <em>you</em>.  I used to feel the same way myself."</p>

<p>"And did you <em>really</em> get over it?" Gloriana eagerly asked. 
"Do you truly like this&mdash;this desolate place now?"</p>

<p>"I <em>love Silver Bow</em>," she answered slowly, yet with emphasis. 
"I sometimes wonder what kind of a girl I would have been if we
had stayed on at Dover or Ferndale, where there was no Carrie. 
Then there would have been no Ivy Hall, either, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And no me," half whispered the red-haired girl.  "Then I should
be thankful for the desert, too; because if it hadn't been for
you, I never should have been adopted by the best people in the
whole wide world, nor found an Uncle Jerry who really belongs
to me.  And anyway, there will be other summers, and the ocean
will keep."</p>

<p>"No, it won't, either!" thrilled a bubbling voice behind them,
and a red-faced, perspiring, disheveled figure swept around the
corner of the house and plumped itself down in the hammock beside
Tabitha whom she proceeded to hug rapturously.</p>

<p>"Myra!" gasped the black-haired girl, trying to return the embrace,
but finding herself held fast by a pair of strong, sinewy arms.</p>

<p>"Myra!" echoed Gloriana, dropping her sewing and staring with
fascinated eyes at the newcomer, who promptly dragged the lame
girl from her chair into the already overloaded hammock and hugged
her vigorously.  "Where did you come from and <em>how</em> did
you get here?"</p>

<p>"On the train," Myra paused long enough to pant, "and as to finding
you,&mdash;haven't you described and sketched the Eagles' Nest often
enough in your letters for me to know it when I saw it?  I never
even had to ask directions how to find the trail.  Now just rustle
your things together and we'll catch that train back to Los Angeles
this afternoon. It leaves at three o'clock, doesn't it?  I simply
had to come after you, but it's too beastly hot to stay here a
minute longer than necessary."</p>

<p>"But Myra, the children!" cried the two maids, looking oh! so
eager at the mere thought of the seashore, but determined to turn
their backs on temptation at once.</p>

<p>"Hark ye!" answered Myra in tragic tones.  "What sound doth smite
your ears?  Or be you <em>deef</em>?"  Her abrupt change of tone
and manner was too comical to be resisted, but her upraised hand
checked the mirth of the other two, and they dutifully cocked
their heads on one side and listened intently.</p>

<p>"The youngsters at play," both replied in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I guess you're <em>deef</em>."</p>

<p>At that moment sturdy Rosslyn flew around the corner of the cottage,
and throwing himself into Tabitha's lap shrieked out, "Kitty,
Kitty, mamma's come, but papa must stay down there till it gets
cooler."</p>

<p>"What!" whispered Tabitha, her face paling.  "It can't be!  Is
she truly?"</p>

<p>Myra nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>"What wonderful things are happening&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an ominous crack, the hammock rope snapped in two,
and the quartette found themselves a tangled, huddled heap of
arms and legs upon the piazza floor.</p>

<p>"Indeed, and I see nothing wonderful about that," spluttered
Myra, who had just opened her lips to speak, when their downfall
came, and in consequence she had shut her sharp teeth together
on her tongue.</p>

<p>Gloriana scrambled to her feet, then laughed.  She could not
help it, for long-limbed Myra did look so funny, sprawled on the
floor like a huge spider; and amazement was written so large upon
Tabitha's face that sterner hearts than hers would have made merry
at the picture which they presented.  Rosslyn's wail of grief
checked her mirth, however, and she came hastily to his rescue,
but his mother had heard the outcry, and now appeared on the scene
with the remainder of her brood clinging to her skirts, and Billiard
and Toady following close at their heels.</p>

<p>"Well, for the land sakes!" she ejaculated, holding up her hands
in surprise and amusement.  "What a sight!  Are any of you hurt? 
That's good!  Now, girls, perhaps it will seem rude and ungrateful
to rush you off this way, but I had orders to see that you caught
the train back to Los Angeles this afternoon.  So I reckon you
will have to move lively, with your packing and all."</p>

<p>"Who gave you such orders?" demanded Tabitha in bewilderment,
rubbing her eyes to make sure she was not dreaming.</p>

<p>"Your father.  I met him in the city just as I was about to board
the train for Silver Bow."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No 'buts' about it," put in Myra, still sucking her injured
tongue. "I accidentally ran up against Mrs. McKittrick in Los
Angeles, knew her at once because Mercy looks so much like her,
discovered that she was planning to come back here before school
opened; so I just attached myself to her and came along&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aha!" crowed Gloriana jubilantly.  "Then all that tale about
finding the Eagles' Nest without help was a&mdash;fib!"</p>

<p>Myra's face crimsoned and her tell-tale eyes dropped, then lifted
again, twinkling like twin stars.  "Huh!" she giggled, "our detective
again!  Say, are you going to catch that train at three o'clock? 
If so, just take wings to your feet and fly for home.  Mrs. McKittrick
can hear all about everything when you get back.  The children
are alive and well, and that's the main point.  I told her everything
you had written me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Myra Haskell!"</p>

<p>"Well, she was on her way home and 'twas time she knew."  She
glanced across at Mrs. McKittrick, who smiled back through her
tears.  "And she says you are bricks.  Also I told the station
agent to send up his rig for your trunks, and if you don't make
haste pretty lively, he'll be there before we are.  I suppose
your trunks are at your own house? That's where I told him to
call.  Now sling out the duds you've got here, and I'll pack them
while you are getting slicked up.  No, Mrs. McKittrick, I don't
want another bite to eat, and it's evident from the looks of the
house that either these folks don't get dinner, or else they have
already eaten it."</p>

<p>"We've had it," volunteered Irene, "but it wasn't very good."</p>

<p>"Irene McKittrick!" gasped her mother.</p>

<p>"She is right," laughed Tabitha.  "To-day was scrap dinner. 
We have it once a week to get rid of all the odds and ends.  However,
it isn't very popular.  No, thanks, we won't need a lunch put
up for us.  If we get hungry before we reach Los Angeles, we'll
patronize the diner. Sorry we can't stop to tell you all the news,
but if Dad said we must go back on this train, I suppose we must. 
Where are you staying, Myra? Avalon?  Catalina Island?"</p>

<p>"The very same."</p>

<p>Tabitha clasped her hands together and drew a deep breath.  "How
perfectly splendid!"</p>

<p>"I guess I'm dreaming," murmured Gloriana, half aloud, pinching
herself vigorously to make sure she was really awake.  "Do you
get there by boat?"</p>

<p>"Of course, goosie!  Did you think we took an airship?  Hurry
up, slowpokes!"</p>

<p>Laughing and chattering gleefully, the trio gathered up their
possessions, made a hurried visit to the Catt cottage, packed
their trunks, and were at the station long before the train rumbled
its way back to the great city by the sea.</p>

<p>"We are going to have the grandest kind of a time," Myra told
them. "All sorts of high jinks.  We've got a dandy site for our
camp,&mdash;a dozen tents&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A dozen!" cried Tabitha in a panic.  "Why, who are with you? 
I thought it was just your family."</p>

<p>"You knew Gwynne was there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she wouldn't occupy a dozen tents.  I'm scared!"</p>

<p>"You needn't be," mocked Myra soothingly.  "I'll bet you will
vote it the jolliest bunch you ever got mixed up with."</p>

<p>"Do I know any of them?"</p>

<p>"Do you consider yourself acquainted with Gwynne and me?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  I meant any of the others."</p>

<p>"Well," Myra spoke dubiously, "if you don't, I think you will
get acquainted easily."  And with that remark she adroitly turned
the conversation and managed to avoid that subject during the
rest of their journey.</p>

<p>When the train drew into the dingy little depot the next morning,
and the trio gathered up their wraps preparatory to alighting,
Tabitha was suddenly heard to ejaculate, "Why, there is Dad! 
And he's talking with &mdash;Miss Pomeroy, as sure as I'm alive! 
Myra Haskell, is Miss Pomeroy occupying one of those twelve tents?"</p>

<p>Myra glanced hastily through the iron gates, saw that Tabitha
was right, and demurely nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Then I can imagine who the others are."</p>

<p>"Bet you can't!  At least, not all."</p>

<p>"Bet I can!"</p>

<p>"Who, then, smarty?"</p>

<p>"Grace Tilton, Bessie Jorris, Jessie Wayne, Julia, Chrystie&mdash;<em>is</em>
Chrystie there?"</p>

<p>"Wait and find out," teased Myra.</p>

<p>"Possibly Madeline and Vera,&mdash;in fact, all our bunch."</p>

<p>Myra merely laughed, and as they were now spied by Mr. Catt and
his companion, there was no further opportunity for discussion;
for, after a hasty greeting all around, the man seized all the
grips he could manage, and made for the street, saying briskly,
"We must hurry.  The boat goes at ten, and it is quite a ride
to San Pedro."</p>

<p>"I hope," panted Tabitha, trotting along at the rear of the procession,
tugging a heavy suit-case, "that you don't have your fun in such
a hurry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Myra demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, it's been nothing but hustle since we started out yesterday
afternoon, and I was just wondering if that's the atmosphere of
your camp, too."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will think so," laughed Myra; "for there certainly
are few idle minutes with us."</p>

<p>"How long has the bunch been at Avalon?  Surely not all summer,
or you never could have kept it secret for such a while."</p>

<p>"No," Myra acknowledged, "only&mdash;but there, not another question
till we reach Catalina.  Then you can ask all you want.  I've
said too much already.  First thing I know, you will guess the
rest of our surprise." And the girl resolutely closed her lips.</p>

<p>"<em>Rest</em> of the surprise," mused Tabitha to herself, when
further questions failed to bring forth any more information,
and Myra was devoting her attention to quiet Gloriana.  "I wonder
what it can be. Seems as if there had been about all the surprises
one human being could expect in twenty-four hours.  Who would
ever imagine that Dad would go on a jaunt like this?  Isn't it
great to be alive in this day and age?"</p>

<p>She fell to dreaming over the many changes that had come to pass
in her life during one short year, and was only roused from her
revery by Myra's gripping her shoulder and shouting in her ear,
"The boat is whistling its warning now.  Not a minute to spare. 
Run, Kit, run!" And again the little company tore frantically
down the street toward the dock where the <em>Cabrillo</em> was
tugging at her anchor, waiting for the signal to steam away to
the Enchanted Isle on her daily voyage.</p>

<p>It was the first time either Tabitha or Gloriana had been on
the ocean; and with rapturous hearts they drank in every detail
of their brief trip, counted the flying fish that darted out of
the water on either side of them, watched the foam dashing high
against the bow of the vessel, wondered at the long ribbon of
silent water which the ship left in its wake, and were sorry when
suddenly Myra called, "There's the island.  We are almost there. 
Now for the fun!  There's a bride and groom on board."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear the whistle blow?"</p>

<p>"Sure, but I supposed it was to tell the islanders that we were
coming. Doesn't it always whistle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not like it did just now.  That's the way they have
of letting the folks at Avalon know when there is a recently married
couple on board.  Then the men are ready and waiting at the dock
with a wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>"A wheelbarrow!  What on earth do they want of a wheelbarrow?"
demanded both girls at once.</p>

<p>"Just for fun.  They cart the groom all around the island in
it and make a fearful racket.  Regular chivari."</p>

<p>"How mean!" cried Gloriana compassionately.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's fun," Myra declared.  "They like it.  I believe an
Avalon citizen who didn't get treated that way would feel insulted,
really. Here we are at the landing, and there is the wheelbarrow
brigade.  It's Murphy, the ice-man, who got married this time. 
See, he's as proud as a peacock at the prospect."</p>

<p>"Yes, but look at the poor little bride," said Gloriana indignantly.
"She is scared stiff."</p>

<p>"Bet she's game," replied Myra, after a quick scrutiny of the
little, shrinking woman, clinging to the arm of the big, burly
Irishman, as they stepped briskly down the gangplank.</p>

<p>"Do they put her in the wheelbarrow, too?" cried Tabitha in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no<hr>"</p>

<p>"They will this one," said the bride with startling suddenness,
having chanced to overhear both question and answer.  "If they
cart my Pat around town in that kind of a rig, they cart me, too." 
And to the delight and amusement of the crowd gathered to greet
the <em>Cabrillo's</em> passengers, the little lady tucked herself
in the barrow beside her husband and was trundled away by the
surprised citizens, who had never wheeled just such a cargo before.</p>

<p>"'Here comes the bride'," a voice began to sing; the crowd took
it up, and amid a shower of bright-colored confetti, the plucky
bride disappeared down the street still seated beside her smiling
Pat.</p>

<p>So intent was Tabitha in watching the queer procession that she
had not noticed the quiet approach of a bevy of happy-faced girls;
but now, as she turned toward Myra with the remark, "She's clear
grit.  I'd choose a wife like that if I were a man," she found
the laughing eyes of Grace Tilton staring at her, and before she
could find her tongue to voice her surprise, Gwynne's regal head
bobbed through the crowd toward her. Jessie and Julia, Vera and
Kate, all her particular friends at Ivy Hall, seemed to spring
up around her, and although half expecting to find them there,
she stood transfixed with amazement, silently regarding them one
by one, while they in silence stared back at her. Then the circle
parted, and among the familiar faces of her schoolmates appeared
another, which dimpled and smiled and nodded engagingly, and Tabitha
awoke with a start.</p>

<p>"Carrie Carson!" she cried, and ran straight into the outstretched
arms of the golden-haired girl.</p>

<p>"Kitty, my puss!" whispered Carrie, cuddling the black head dropped
on her shoulder; and the other girls thoughtfully turned away
to watch the sea-gulls careening about the mastheads of the big
<em>Cabrillo</em>.</p>

<p>But after a moment, that sweet, familiar voice spoke again, and
turning back, the Ivy Hall girls saw Carrie stretching out her
hands to timid Gloriana, as she said, "So this is my other sister,
my Gloriana!  It seems as if I had always known you.  We are going
to have great times at Ivy Hall this year.  Come on, girls, the
glass bottom boat is to take us to the Marine Gardens right after
dinner, and we'll have to hurry, or be late."</p>

<p>Myra turned to Tabitha with a comical grimace, and said, "What
did I tell you?  Hurry's the word."</p>

<p>Then a babel of voices broke loose, all laughing and talking
at once, and in triumph Tabitha and Gloriana were escorted to
Ivy Hall Camp.</p>
