<P>
The Prince dined carefully, but with less than his usual appetite.
Afterwards he lit a cigarette and strolled for a moment into the
lounge.  Celeste, who was waiting for him, glided at once to his
side.
<P>
"Monsieur!"  she whispered.  "I have been here for one hour."
<P>
He nodded.
<P>
"Well?"
<P>
"Monsieur le Duc has arrived."
<P>
The Prince turned sharply round.
<P>
"Who?"
<P>
"Monsieur le Duc de Souspennier.  He calls himself no longer Mr.
Sabin."
<P>
A dull flush of angry colour rose almost to his temples.
<P>
"Why did you not tell me before?" he exclaimed.
<P>
"Monsieur was in the restaurant," she answered.  "It was impossible
for me to do anything but wait."
<P>
"Where is he?"
<P>
"Alas!  he is with madam," the girl answered.
<P>
The Prince was very profane.  He started at once for the elevator.
In a moment or two he presented himself at Lucille's sitting-room.
They were still lingering over their dinner.  Mr. Sabin welcomed
him with grave courtesy.
<P>
"The Prince is in time to take his liqueur with us," he remarked,
rising.  "Will you take fin champagne, Prince, or Chartreuse?  I
recommend the fin champagne."
<P>
The Prince bowed his thanks.  He was white to the lips with the
effort for self-mastery.
<P>
"I congratulate you, Mr. Sabin," he said, "upon your opportune
arrival.  You will be able to help Lucille through the annoyance
to which I deeply regret that she should be subjected."
<P>
Mr. Sabin gently raised his eyebrows.
<P>
"Annoyance!"  he repeated.  "I fear that I do not quite understand."
<P>
The Prince smiled.
<P>
"Surely Lucille has told you," he said, "of the perilous position
in which she finds herself."
<P>
"My wife," Mr. Sabin said, "has told me nothing.  You alarm me."
<P>
The Prince shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"I deeply regret to tell you," he said, "that the law has proved
too powerful for me.  I can no longer stand between her and what
I fear may prove a most unpleasant episode.  Lucille will be
arrested within the hour."
<P>
"Upon what charge?" Mr. Sabin asked.
<P>
"The murder of Duson."
<P>
Mr. Sabin laughed very softly, very gently, but with obvious
genuineness.
<P>
"You are joking, Prince," he exclaimed.
<P>
"I regret to say," the Prince answered, "that you will find it very
far from a joking matter."
<P>
Mr. Sabin was suddenly stern.
<P>
"Prince of Saxe Leinitzer," he said, "you are a coward and a
bully."
<P>
The Prince started forward with clenched fist.  Mr. Sabin had no
weapon, hut he did not flinch.
<P>
"You can frighten women," he said, "with a bogie such as this, but
you have no longer a woman to deal with.  You and I know that such
a charge is absurd - but you little know the danger to which you
expose yourself by trifling with this subject.  Duson left a letter
addressed to me in which he announced his reasons for committing
suicide."
<P>
"Suicide?"
<P>
"Yes.  He preferred suicide to murder, even at the bidding of the
Prince of Saxe Leinitzer.  He wrote and explained these things to
me - and the letter is in safe hands.  The arrest of Lucille, my
dear Prince, would mean the ruin of your amiable society."
<P>
"This letter," the Prince said slowly, "why was it not produced at
the inquest?  Where is it now?"
<P>
"It is deposited in a sealed packet with the Earl of Deringham,"
Mr. Sabin answered.  "As to producing it at the inquest - I thought
it more discreet not to.  I leave you to judge of my reasons.  But
I can assure you that your fears for my wife's safety have been
wholly misplaced.  There is not the slightest reason for her to
hurry off to America.  We may take a little trip there presently,
but not just yet."
<P>
The Prince made a mistake.  He lost his temper.
<P>
"You!"  he cried, "you can go to America when you like, and stay
there.  Europe has had enough of you with your hare-brained schemes
and foolish failures.  But Lucille does not leave this country.  We
have need of her.  I forbid her to leave.  Do you hear?  In the name
of the Order I command her to remain here."
<P>
Mr. Sabin was quite calm, but his face was full of terrible things.
<P>
"Prince," he said, "if I by any chance numbered myself amongst your
friends I would warn you that you yourself are a traitor to your
Order.  You prostitute a great cause when you stoop to use its
machinery to assist your own private vengeance.  I ask you for your
own sake to consider your words.  Lucille is mine - mine she will
remain, even though you should descend to something more despicable,
more cowardly than ordinary treason, to wrest her from me.  You
reproach me with the failures of my life.  Great they may have been,
but if you attempt this you will find that I am not yet an impotent
person."
<P>
The Prince was white with rage.  The sight of Lucille standing by
Mr. Sabin's side, her hand lightly resting upon his, her dark eyes
full of inscrutable tenderness, maddened him.  He was flouted and
ignored.  He was carried away by a storm of passion.  He tore a
sheet of paper from his pocket book, and unlocking a small gold
case at the end of his watch chain, shook from it a pencil with
yellow crayon.  Mr. Sabin leaned over towards him.
<P>
"You sign it at your peril, Prince," he said.  "It will mean worse
things than that for you."
<P>
For a second he hesitated.  Lucille also leaned towards him.
<P>
"Prince," she said, "have I not kept my vows faithfully?  Think!
I came from America at a moment's notice; I left my husband without
even a word of farewell; I entered upon a hateful task, and though
to think of it now makes me loathe myself - I succeeded.  I have
kept my vows, I have done my duty.  Be generous now, and let me go."
<P>
The sound of her voice maddened him.  A passionate, arbitrary man,
to whom nothing in life had been denied, to be baulked in this
great desire of his latter days was intolerable.  He made no answer
to either of them.  He wrote a few lines with the yellow crayon
and passed them silently across to Lucille.
<P>
Her face blanched.  She stretched out an unwilling hand.  But Mr.
Sabin intervened.  He took the paper from the Prince's hand, and
calmly tore it into fragments.  There Was a moment's breathless
silence.
<P>
"Victor!"  Lucille cried.  "Oh, what have you done!" 
<P>
The Prince's face lightened with an evil joy.
<P>
"We now, I think," he said, "understand one another.  You will
permit me to wish you a very pleasant evening, and a speedy
leave-taking."
<P>
Mr. Sabin smiled.
<P>
"Many thanks, my dear Prince," he said lightly.  "Make haste and
complete your charming little arrangements.  Let me beg of you to
avoid bungling this time.  Remember that there is not in the whole
of Europe to-day a man more dangerous to you than I."
<P>
The Prince had departed.  Mr. Sabin lit a cigarette and stood on
the hearthrug.  His eyes were bright with the joy of fighting.
<P>
"Lucille," he said, "I see that you have not touched your liqueur.
Oblige me by drinking it.  You will find it excellent."
<P>
She came over to him and hung upon his arm.  He threw his cigarette
away and kissed her upon the lips.
<P>
"Victor," she murmured, "I am afraid.  You have been rash!" 
<P>
"Dearest," he answered, "it is better to die fighting than to stand
aside and watch evil things.  But after all, there is no fear.  Come!
Your cloak and dressing case!"
<P>
"You have plans?" she exclaimed, springing up.
<P>
"Plans?"  He laughed at her a little reproachfully.  "My dear
Lucille!  A carriage awaits us outside, a special train with steam
up at the Gard de L'ouest.  This is precisely the contingency for
which I have planned."
<P>
"Oh, you are wonderful, Victor," she murmured as she drew on her
coat.  "But what corner of the earth is there where we should be
safe?"
<P>
"I am going," Mr. Sabin said, "to try and make every corner of the
earth safe."
<P>
She was bewildered, but he only laughed and held open the door for
her.  Mr. Sabin made no secret of his departure.  He lingered for
a moment in the doorway to light a cigarette, he even stopped to
whisper a few words to the little man in plain dinner clothes who
was lounging in the doorway.  But when they had once left the hotel
they drove fast.
<P>
In less than half an hour Paris was behind them.  They were
traveling in a royal saloon and at a fabuulous cost, for in France
they are not fond of special trains.  But Mr. Sabin was very happy.
At least he had escaped an ignominious defeat.  It was left to him
to play the great card.
<P>
"And now," Lucille said, coming out from her little bed-chamber
which the femme de chambre was busy preparing, "suppose you tell
me where we are going."
<P>
Mr. Sabin smiled.
<P>
"Do not be alarmed," he said, "even though it will sound to you the
least likely place in the world.  We are going to Berlin."
