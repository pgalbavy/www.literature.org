<p>Oliver Hazard Perry &mdash;Prompt and Effective Work&mdash;"We Have
Met the Enemy and They Are Ours" &mdash;Death of Perry.</p>

<p>Oliver Hazard Perry was born in Rhode Island in 1785, and entered
the American navy as midshipman when fourteen years old, under
his father, Captain Christopher Raymond Perry, who commanded the
28-gun ship <em>General Greene</em>, which did good service in
the war against France. The son also served on the <em>Constellation</em>
in the Tripolitan war, and afterward gave his attention to ordnance.</p>

<p>The surrender of Detroit by General William Hull at the opening
of the war gave the British control of the Territory of Michigan
and Lake Erie. They had formed the formidable plan of extending
the Dominion of Canada along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to
the Gulf of Mexico, thus inserting an immense wedge between the
United States and the great West, which has since become so important
a part of our country. The only way of blocking this far-reaching
and dangerous scheme was for the Americans to regain control of
Lake Erie, and to young Perry was assigned the seemingly almost
impossible task.</p>

<p>At the little town of Erie, Perry began the construction of his
fleet, and pushed it with such vigor, in the face of every sort
of obstacle, that early in July, 1813, he had ten vessels ready
for sea, but only enough men to man one of them. The end of the
month made the total three hundred, but he determined to get to
sea on the first opportunity. Outside was a powerful blockading
squadron, and the water in the lake was so low that it was not
until the 4th of August that he was able to get all his vessels
over the bar. They comprised the <em>Scorpion</em>, <em>Ariel</em>,
<em>Lawrence</em> (flagship), <em>Caledonia</em>, <em>Niagara</em>,
<em>Somers</em>, <em>Porcupine</em>, <em>Tigress</em> and <em>Trippe</em>.
The total guns carried were 54, with a force of 490 men.</p>

<p>The British squadron consisted of six vessels, with an aggregate
of 63 guns and 502 men. They were under the command of Commander
Robert H. Barclay, who had fought under Nelson at Trafalgar, and
in another battle lost an arm. It was less than three months before
that the dying Lawrence had uttered the appeal, "Don't give up
the ship!" and Perry hoisted a flag with the words displayed in
large letters. As it floated in the breeze from his vessel it
was received with enthusiastic cheers.</p>

<p>It was on the 10th of September, 1814, that the two squadrons
met at the western end of Lake Erie. When a mile apart, the <em>Detroit</em>,
the British flagship, fired a shot to test the distance. It ricochetted
past the <em>Lawrence</em>. A few minutes later she fired a second
shot, which smashed into the starboard bulwarks of the <em>Lawrence</em>
and sent a cloud of splinters flying. The reply to these was a
32-pounder from the <em>Scorpion</em>. Then the firing became
more rapid, the enemy possessing the advantage at long range.</p>

<p>Most of the shots from the British vessels were directed against
Perry's flagship, which suffered considerably. He therefore made
sail to get to close quarters. His ship and the <em>Scorpion</em>
and <em>Ariel</em> drew considerably ahead of the rest of the
fleet. As a consequence they received the main fire of the enemy,
which soon became concentrated on the <em>Lawrence</em>, that
was gallantly fighting against overwhelming odds. Moreover, she
was at a hopeless disadvantage with her short guns, and soon became
a wreck, with a large number of her men killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Gradually the boats drifted nearer and the Americans were able
to make use of their short guns and small arms. Perry's clothing
was torn by splinters and two musket balls passed through his
hat. The battle continued for more than two hours with the utmost
desperation, during which the scenes on the <em>Lawrence</em>
were too frightful to be described. Finally the wrecked flagship
began drifting helplessly out of action, when Perry determined
to transfer his flag to the <em>Niagara</em>.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>COMMODORE PERRY AT THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE</em>.]</p>

<p>With his broad pennant folded over his arm, and accompanied by
a younger brother and four seamen, he stepped into the small boat,
which began pulling in the direction of the <em>Niagara</em>.
The thick smoke concealed them for a time, but it soon lifted,
and Barclay aimed a shot at the boat. He said in his official
report that he saw the shot strike the boat, whereupon Perry took
off his coat and plugged the hole with it. But for the temporary
veil the American commander could not have made half the brief
distance between the <em>Lawrence</em> and the <em>Niagara</em>.
As it was, however, he reached the latter without a scratch. He
hoisted his pennant and the flag bearing the immortal words of
the gallant Lawrence. Then an officer was sent in a boat to communicate
the orders of the Commodore to the other vessels. This was hardly
done when Perry saw with the keenest distress the surrender of
the <em>Lawrence</em>. Such submission was inevitable, for almost
every man on board was either killed or wounded and every gun
on the engaged side was disabled. The English crews broke into
cheers, believing the battle won, but they could not take possession
of the <em>Lawrence</em>, which drifted out of range.</p>

<p>Captain Barclay now made an attempt to change his line of battle
with a view of bringing his other broadsides into action. The
line became broken and entangled, observing which, Perry took
instant advantage of it. The <em>Niagara</em>, passing through
the disorganized squadron, raked the vessels fore and aft, while
the other American vessels promptly followed, and added to the
confusion of the enemy and the dreadful destruction on board.
The Americans were now at close quarters and able to do their
best work, and so dreadful was it that fifteen minutes later a
white handkerchief was waved at the end of a boarding-pike on
one of the boats as a signal of surrender.</p>

<p>Firing ceased, and in the smoke and confusion two of the enemy's
boats darted away in an attempt to escape; but they were followed
and brought back. Determined to honor the <em>Lawrence</em>, Perry
now had himself rowed to the wreck, drifting some distance away
in charge of the few that had survived the awful conflict. Perry
took his position aft and with calm dignity received the surrender.
As the defeated officers approached and presented their swords
in turn, he told each to retain the weapon, accompanying the remark
with words of compliment for the bravery he had displayed.</p>

<p>The loss of the Americans was 27 killed and 96 wounded, and that
of the British 41 killed and 94 wounded. Perry showed every possible
kindness to the suffering prisoners, who expressed their gratitude.
Commander Barclay displayed conspicuous bravery throughout the
battle and was twice wounded, one of his injuries depriving him
of the use of his single remaining arm.</p>

<p>From what was stated at the beginning of this chapter, it will
be seen that this battle was one of the most important of the
war. Not only was it a glorious victory of itself, the occasion
being the first time in England's history that she surrendered
a whole squadron, but it settled a much more momentous matter.
The British General Proctor was waiting with his army on the Canadian
shore ready to be carried across the lake by the English fleet,
in the event of their being successful, and pressing his invasion
of Ohio, which would have been an almost fatal blow to our country.</p>

<p>On the Ohio shore General Harrison was waiting with an American
force to invade Canada, if Perry gained a victory. Hardly had
the surrender been made when the commandant, using his cap for
a desk and the back of an old letter for paper, pencilled the
despatch which has become famous: "We have met the enemy and they
are ours&mdash;two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop," which
he sent by messenger to General Harrison.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE</em>.]</p>

<p>In the following month Harrison invaded Canada, with Proctor
retreating before him, and accompanied by the famous Indian, Tecumseh,
and several hundred of his warriors. Proctor halted near the Moravian
Towns, where a battle was fought October 5, in which the British
and Indians were decisively defeated. The Indian confederacy was
destroyed and all danger of the invasion of Ohio ended.</p>

<p>Master-Commandant Perry's victory caused his promotion to the
rank of captain, and Congress awarded him a gold medal, besides
suitably rewarding his officers and men. After the war he was
sent into southern waters to help suppress piracy, which had become
very troublesome. While engaged on this duty he was seized with
yellow fever, and died August 24, 1819, just as his ship reached
Port of Spain, Trinidad.</p>
