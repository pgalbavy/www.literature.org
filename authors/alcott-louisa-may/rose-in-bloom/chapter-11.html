<p>
&quot;Oh, Rose, I've got something so exciting to tell you!&quot; cried Kitty
Van Tassel, skipping into the carriage next morning when her
friend called for her to go shopping.</p>

<p>Kitty always did have some &quot;perfectly thrilling&quot; communication to
make and Rose had learned to take them quietly, but the next
demonstration was a new one, for, regardless alike of curious
observers outside and disordered hats within, Kitty caught Rose
around the neck, exclaiming in a rapturous whisper: &quot;My dearest
creature, I'm engaged!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad! Of course it is Steve?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear fellow, he did it last night in the nicest way, and Mama is so
delighted. Now what shall I be married in?&quot; And Kitty composed
herself with a face full of the deepest anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;How can you talk of that so soon? Why, Kit, you unromantic girl,
you ought to be thinking of your lover and not your clothes,&quot; said
Rose, amused yet rather scandalized at such want of sentiment.</p>

<p>&quot;I am thinking of my lover, for he says he will not have a long
engagement, so I must begin to think about the most important
things at once, mustn't I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, he wants to be sure of you, for you are such a slippery
creature he is afraid you'll treat him as you did poor Jackson and
the rest,&quot; interrupted Rose, shaking her finger at her prospective
cousin, who had tried this pastime twice before and was rather
proud than otherwise of her brief engagements.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't scold, for I know I'm right, and when you've been in
society as long as I have you'll find that the only way to really
know a man is to be engaged to him. While they want you they are
all devotion, but when they think they've got you, then you find out
what wretches they are,&quot; answered Kitty with an air of worldly
wisdom which contrasted oddly with her youthful face and giddy
manners.</p>

<p>&quot;A sad prospect for poor Steve, unless I give him a hint to look
well to his ways.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my dear child, I'm sure of him, for my experience has made
me very sharp and I'm convinced I can manage him without a bit
of trouble. We've known each other for ages&quot; Steve was twenty
and Kitty eighteen &quot;and always been the best of friends. Besides,
he is quite my ideal man. I never could bear big hands and feet,
and his are simply adorable. Then he's the best dancer I know and
dresses in perfect taste. I really do believe I fell in love with his
pocket handkerchiefs first, they were so enchanting I couldn't
resist,&quot; laughed Kitty, pulling a large one out of her pocket and
burying her little nose in the folds, which shed a delicious
fragrance upon the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, that looks promising, and I begin to think you have got a
little sentiment after all,&quot; said Rose, well pleased, for the merry
brown eyes had softened suddenly and a quick color came up in
Kitty's cheek as she answered, still half hiding her face in the
beloved handkerchief: &quot;Of course I have, lots of it, only I'm
ashamed to show it to most people, because it's the style to take
everything in the most nonchalant way. My gracious, Rose, you'd
have thought me a romantic goose last night while Steve proposed
in the back parlor, for I actually cried, he was so dreadfully in
earnest when I pretended that I didn't care for him, and so very
dear and nice when I told the truth. I didn't know he had it in him,
but he came out delightfully and never cared a particle, though I
dropped tears all over his lovely shirtfront. Wasn't that good of
him? For you know he hates his things to be mussed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a true Campbell, and has got a good warm heart of his own
under those fine fronts of his. Aunt Jane doesn't believe in
sentiment, so he has been trained never to show any, but it is there,
and you must encourage him to let it out, not foolishly, but in a
way to make him more manly and serious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will if I can, for though I wouldn't own this to everybody, I like
it in him very much and feel as if Steve and I should get on
beautifully. Here we are now, be sure not to breathe a word if we
meet anyone. I want it to be a profound secret for a week at least,&quot;
added Kitty, whisking her handkerchief out of sight as the carriage
stopped before the fashionable store they were about to visit.</p>

<p>Rose promised with a smile, for Kitty's face betrayed her without
words, so full was it of the happiness which few eyes fail to
understand whenever they see it.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a glance at the silks. You ask my opinion about white ones,
and I'll look at the colors. Mama says satin, but that is out now,
and I've set my heart on the heaviest corded thing I can find,&quot;
whispered Kitty as they went rustling by the long counters strewn
with all that could delight the feminine eye and tempt the feminine
pocket.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that opal the loveliest thing you ever saw? I'm afraid I'm too
dark to wear it, but it would just suit you. You'll need a variety,
you know,&quot; added Kitty in a significant aside as Rose stood among
the white silks while her companion affected great interest in the
delicate hues laid before her.</p>

<p>&quot;But I have a variety now, and don't need a new dress of any sort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No matter, get it, else it will be gone. You've worn all yours
several times already and must have a new one whether you need it
or not. Dear me! If I had as much pocket money as you have, I'd
come out in a fresh toilet at every party I went to,&quot; answered Kitty,
casting an envious eye upon the rainbow piles before her.</p>

<p>The quick-witted shopman saw that a wedding was afoot, for when
two pretty girls whisper, smile, and blush over their shopping,
clerks scent bridal finery and a transient gleam of interest
brightens their imperturbable countenances and lends a brief
energy to languid voices weary with crying, &quot;Cash!&quot; Gathering
both silks with a practiced turn of the hand, he held them up for
inspection, detecting at a glance which was the bride-elect and
which the friend, for Kitty fell back to study the effect of silvery
white folds with an absorbing interest impossible to mistake while
Rose sat looking at the opal as if she scarcely heard a bland voice
saying, with the rustle of silk so dear to girlish ears: &quot;A superb
thing, just opened; all the rage in Paris; very rare shade; trying to
most, as the lady says, but quite perfect for a blonde.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose was not listening to those words but to others which Aunt
Clara had lately uttered, laughed at then, but thought over more
than once since.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm tired of hearing people wonder why Miss Campbell does not
dress more. Simplicity is all very well for schoolgirls and women
who can't afford anything better, but you can, and you really ought.
Your things are pretty enough in their way, and I rather like you to
have a style of your own, but it looks odd and people will think
you are mean if you don't make more show. Besides, you don't do
justice to your beauty, which would be both peculiar and striking if
you'd devote your mind to getting up ravishing costumes.&quot;</p>

<p>Much more to the same effect did her aunt say, discussing the
subject quite artistically and unconsciously appealing to several of
Rose's ruling passions. One was a love for the delicate fabrics,
colors, and ornaments which refined tastes enjoy and whose
costliness keeps them from ever growing common; another, her
strong desire to please the eyes of those she cared for and gratify
their wishes in the smallest matter if she could. And last, but not
least, the natural desire of a young and pretty woman to enhance
the beauty which she so soon discovers to be her most potent
charm for the other sex, her passport to a high place among her
maiden peers.</p>

<p>She had thought seriously of surprising and delighting everyone by
appearing in a costume which should do justice to the loveliness
which was so modest that it was apt to forget itself in admiring
others what girls call a &quot;ravishing&quot; dress, such as she could
imagine and easily procure by the magic of the Fortunatus' purse in
her pocket. She had planned it all, the shimmer of pale silk
through lace like woven frostwork, ornaments of some classic
pattern, and all the dainty accessories as perfect as time, taste, and
money could make them.</p>

<p>She knew that Uncle Alec's healthful training had given her a
figure that could venture on any fashion and Nature blessed her
with a complexion that defied all hues. So it was little wonder that
she felt a strong desire to use these gifts, not for the pleasure of
display, but to seem fair in the eyes that seldom looked at her
without a tender sort of admiration, all the more winning when no
words marred the involuntary homage women love.</p>

<p>These thoughts were busy in Rose's mind as she sat looking at the
lovely silk and wondering what Charlie would say if she should
some night burst upon him in a pale rosy cloud, like the Aurora to
whom he often likened her. She knew it would please him very
much and she longed to do all she honestly could to gratify the
poor fellow, for her tender heart already felt some remorseful
pangs, remembering how severe she had been the night before. She
could not revoke her words, because she meant them every one,
but she might be kind and show that she did not wholly shut him
out from her regard by asking him to go with her to Kitty's ball and
gratify his artistic taste by a lovely costume. A very girlish but
kindly plan, for that ball was to be the last of her frivolities, so she
wanted it to be a pleasant one and felt that &quot;being friends&quot; with
Charlie would add much to her enjoyment.</p>

<p>This idea made her fingers tighten on the gleaming fabric so
temptingly upheld, and she was about to take it when, &quot;If ye
please, sir, would ye kindly tell me where I'd be finding the flannel
place?&quot; said a voice behind her, and, glancing up, she saw a meek
little Irishwoman looking quite lost and out of place among the
luxuries around her.</p>

<p>&quot;Downstairs, turn to the left,&quot; was the clerk's hasty reply, with a
vague wave of the hand which left the inquirer more in the dark
than ever.</p>

<p>Rose saw the woman's perplexity and said kindly, &quot;I'll show you
this way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm ashamed to be throublin' ye, miss, but it's strange I am in it,
and wouldn't be comin' here at all, at all, barrin' they tould me I'd
get the bit I'm wantin' chaper in this big shop than the little ones
more becomin' the like o' me,&quot; explained the little woman humbly.</p>

<p>Rose looked again as she led the way through a well-dressed
crowd of busy shoppers, and something in the anxious, tired face
under the old woolen hood the bare, purple hands holding fast a
meager wallet and a faded scrap of the dotted flannel little
children's frocks are so often made of touched the generous heart
that never could see want without an impulse to relieve it. She had
meant only to point the way, but, following a new impulse, she
went on, listening to the poor soul's motherly prattle about &quot;me
baby&quot; and the &quot;throuble&quot; it was to &quot;find clothes for the growin'
childer when me man is out av work and the bit and sup
inconvaynient these hard times&quot; as they descended to that
darksome lower world where necessities take refuge when luxuries
crowd them out from the gayer place above.</p>

<p>The presence of a lady made Mrs. Sullivan's shopping very easy
now, and her one poor &quot;bit&quot; of flannel grew miraculously into
yards of several colors, since the shabby purse was no lighter when
she went away, wiping her eyes on the corner of a big, brown
bundle. A very little thing, and no one saw it but a wooden-faced
clerk, who never told, yet it did Rose good and sent her up into the
light again with a sober face, thinking self-reproachfully, &quot;What
right have I to more gay gowns when some poor babies have none,
or to spend time making myself fine while there is so much bitter
want in the world?&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless the pretty things were just as tempting as ever, and
she yearned for the opal silk with a renewed yearning when she got
back. It is not certain that it would not have been bought in spite of
her better self if a good angel in the likeness of a stout lady with
silvery curls about the benevolent face, enshrined in a plain
bonnet, had not accosted her as she joined Kitty, still brooding
over the wedding gowns.</p>

<p>&quot;I waited a moment for you, my dear, because I'm in haste, and
very glad to save myself a journey or a note,&quot; began the newcomer
in a low tone as Rose shook hands with the most affectionate
respect. &quot;You know the great box factory was burned a day or two
ago and over a hundred girls thrown out of work. Some were hurt
and are in the hospital, many have no homes to go to, and nearly
all need temporary help of some sort. We've had so many calls this
winter I hardly know which way to turn, for want is pressing, and
I've had my finger in so many purses I'm almost ashamed to ask
again. Any little contribution ah, thank you, I was sure you
wouldn't fail me, my good child,&quot; and Mrs. Gardener warmly
pressed the hand that went so quickly into the little porte-monnaie
and came out so generously filled.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me know how else I can help, and thank you very much for
allowing me to have a share in your good works,&quot; said Rose,
forgetting all about gay gowns as she watched the black bonnet go
briskly away with an approving smile on the fine old face inside it.</p>

<p>&quot;You extravagant thing! How could you give so much?&quot; whispered
Kitty, whose curious eye had seen three figures on the single bill
which had so rapidly changed hands.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe if Mrs. Gardener asked me for my head I should give it
to her,&quot; answered Rose lightly, then, turning to the silks, she asked,
&quot;Which have you decided upon, the yellow white or the blue, the
corded or the striped?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've decided nothing; except that you are to have the pink and
wear it at my ahem! ball,&quot; said Kitty, who had made up her mind,
but could not give her orders till Mama had been consulted.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I can't afford it just yet. I never overstep my allowance, and I
shall have to if I get any more finery. Come, we ought not to waste
time here if you have all the patterns you want.&quot; And Rose walked
quickly away, glad that it was out of her power to break through
two resolutions which hitherto had been faithfully kept one to
dress simply for example's sake, the other not to be extravagant for
charity's sake.</p>

<p>As Rosamond had her day of misfortunes, so this seemed to be one
of small temptations to Rose. After she had set Kitty down at home
and been to see her new houses, she drove about doing various
errands for the aunts and, while waiting in the carriage for the
execution of an order, young Pemberton came by.</p>

<p>As Steve said, this gentleman had been &quot;hard hit&quot; and still hovered
mothlike about the forbidden light. Being the most eligible parti of
the season, his regard was considered a distinction to be proud of,
and Rose had been well scolded by Aunt Clara for refusing so
honorable a mate. The girl liked him, and he was the suitor of
whom she had spoken so respectfully to Dr. Alec because he had
no need of the heiress and had sincerely loved Rose. He had been
away, and she hoped had gotten over his disappointment as happily
as the rest, but now when he saw her, and came hurrying up so
hungry for a word, she felt that he had not forgotten and was too
kind to chill him with the bow which plainly says &quot;Don't stop.&quot;</p>

<p>A personable youth was Pemberton, and had brought with him
from the wilds of Canada a sable-lined overcoat which was the
envy of every masculine and the admiration of every feminine
friend he had, and as he stood at her carriage window Rose knew
that this luxurious garment and its stalwart wearer were objects of
interest to the passersby. It chanced that the tide of shoppers
flowed in that direction and, as she chatted, familiar faces often
passed with glances, smiles, and nods of varying curiosity,
significance, and wonder.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling a certain satisfaction in giving him a
moment's pleasure, since she could do no more, but it was not that
amiable desire alone which made her ignore the neat white parcels
which the druggist's boy deposited on the front seat and kept her
lingering a little longer to enjoy one of the small triumphs which
girls often risk more than a cold in the head to display. The sight
of several snowflakes on the broad shoulders which partially
obstructed her view, as well as the rapidly increasing animation of
Pemberton's chat, reminded her that it was high time to go.</p>

<p>&quot;I mustn't keep you it is beginning to storm,&quot; she said, taking up
her muff, much to old Jacob's satisfaction, for small talk is not
exciting to a hungry man whose nose feels like an icicle.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it? I thought the sun was shining.&quot; And the absorbed gentleman
turned to the outer world with visible reluctance, for it looked very
warm and cozy in the red-lined carriage.</p>

<p>&quot;Wise people say we must carry our sunshine with us,&quot; answered
Rose, taking refuge in commonplaces, for the face at the window
grew pensive suddenly as he answered, with a longing look, &quot;I
wish I could.&quot; Then, smiling gratefully, he added, &quot;Thank you for
giving me a little of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very welcome.&quot; And Rose offered him her hand while
her eyes mutely asked pardon for withholding her leave to keep it.</p>

<p>He pressed it silently and, shouldering the umbrella which he
forgot to open, turned away with an &quot;up again and take another&quot;
expression, which caused the soft eyes to follow him admiringly.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought not to have kept him a minute longer than I could help, for
it wasn't all pity; it was my foolish wish to show off and do as I
liked for a minute, to pay for being good about the gown. Oh, me!
How weak and silly I am in spite of all my trying!&quot; And Miss
Campbell fell into a remorseful reverie, which lasted till she got
home.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, young man, what brought you out in this driving storm?&quot;
asked Rose as Jamie came stamping in that same afternoon.</p>

<p>&quot;Mama sent you a new book thought you'd like it. I don't mind
your old storms!&quot; replied the boy, wrestling his way out of his coat
and presenting a face as round and red and shiny as a well-polished
Baldwin apple.</p>

<p>&quot;Much obliged it is just the day to enjoy it and I was longing for
something nice to read,&quot; said Rose as Jamie sat down upon the
lower stair for a protracted struggle with his rubber boots.</p>

<p>&quot;Here you are, then no yes I do believe I've forgotten it, after all!&quot;
cried Jamie, slapping his pockets one after the other with a
dismayed expression of countenance.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, I'll hunt up something else. Let me help you with
those your hands are so cold.&quot; And Rose good-naturedly gave a tug
at the boots while Jamie clutched the banisters, murmuring
somewhat incoherently as his legs flew up and down: &quot;I'll go back
if you want me to. I'm so sorry! It's very good of you, I'm sure.
Getting these horrid things on made me forget. Mother would
make me wear 'em, though I told her they'd stick like like
gumdrops,&quot; he added, inspired by recollections of certain dire
disappointments when the above-mentioned sweetmeat melted in
his pockets and refused to come out.</p>

<p>&quot;Now what shall we do?&quot; asked Rose when he was finally
extricated. &quot;Since I've nothing to read, I may as well play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll teach you to pitch and toss. You catch very well for a girl, but
you can't throw worth a cent,&quot; replied Jamie, gamboling down the
hall in his slippers and producing a ball from some of the
mysterious receptacles in which boys have the art of storing
rubbish enough to fill a peck measure.</p>

<p>Of course Rose agreed and cheerfully risked getting her eyes
blackened and her fingers bruised till her young receptor gratefully
observed that &quot;it was no fun playing where you had to look out for
windows and jars and things, so I'd like that jolly book about
Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, please.&quot;</p>

<p>Being gratified, he spread himself upon the couch, crossed his legs
in the air, and without another word dived Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea, where he remained for two mortal hours,
to the general satisfaction of his relatives.</p>

<p>Bereft both of her unexpected playfellow and the much desired
book, Rose went into the parlor, there to discover a French novel
which Kitty had taken from a library and left in the carriage among
the bundles. Settling herself in her favorite lounging chair, she
read as diligently as Jamie while the wind howled and snow fell
fast without.</p>

<p>For an hour nothing disturbed the cozy quiet of the house for Aunt
Plenty was napping upstairs and Dr. Alec writing in his own
sanctum; at least Rose thought so, till his step made her hastily
drop the book and look up with very much the expression she used
to wear when caught in mischief years ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I startle you? Have a screen you are burning your face before
this hot fire.&quot; And Dr. Alec pulled one forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Uncle. I didn't feel it.&quot; And the color seemed to
deepen in spite of the screen while the uneasy eyes fell upon the
book in her lap.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you got the Quarterly there? I want to glance at an article in
it if you can spare it for a moment,&quot; he said, leaning toward her
with an inquiring glance.</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir, I am reading.&quot; And, without mentioning the name, Rose
put the book into his hand.</p>

<p>The instant his eye fell on the title he understood the look she wore
and knew what &quot;mischief&quot; she had been in. He knit his brows, then
smiled, because it was impossible to help it Rose looked so
conscience-stricken in spite of her twenty years.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you find it? Interesting?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, very! I felt as if I was in another world and forgot all about
this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a very good world, I fancy, if you were afraid or ashamed to
be found in it. Where did this come from?&quot; asked Dr. Alec,
surveying the book with great disfavor. Rose told him, and added
slowly, &quot;I particularly wanted to read it, and fancied I might,
because you did when it was so much talked about the winter we
were in Rome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did read it to see if it was fit for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And decided that it was not, I suppose, since you never gave it to
me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I won't finish it. But, Uncle, I don't see why I should not,&quot;
added Rose wistfully, for she had reached the heart of the romance
and found it wonderfully fascinating.</p>

<p>&quot;You may not see, but don't you feel why not?&quot; asked Dr. Alec
gravely.</p>

<p>Rose leaned her flushed cheek on her hand and thought a minute,
then looked up and answered honestly, &quot;Yes, I do, but can't explain
it, except that I know something must be wrong, because I blushed
and started when you came in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly.&quot; And the doctor gave an emphatic nod, as if the
symptoms pleased him.</p>

<p>&quot;But I really don't see any harm in the book so far. It is by a
famous author, wonderfully well written, as you know, and the
characters so lifelike that I feel as if I should really meet them
somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope not!&quot; ejaculated the doctor, shutting the book quickly, as if
to keep the objectionable beings from escaping.</p>

<p>Rose laughed, but persisted in her defense, for she did want to
finish the absorbing story, yet would not without leave.</p>

<p>&quot;I have read French novels before, and you gave them to me. Not
many, to be sure, but the best, so I think I know what is good and
shouldn't like this if it was harmful.&quot;</p>

<p>Her uncle's answer was to reopen the volume and turn the leaves
an instant as if to find a particular place. Then he put it into her
hand, saying quietly: &quot;Read a page or two aloud, translating as you
go. You used to like that try it again.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose obeyed and went glibly down a page, doing her best to give
the sense in her purest English. Presently she went more slowly,
then skipped a sentence here and there, and finally stopped short,
looking as if she needed a screen again.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; asked her uncle, who had been watching her
with a serious eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Some phrases are untranslatable, and it only spoils them to try.
They are not amiss in French, but sound coarse and bad in our
blunt English,&quot; she said a little pettishly, for she felt annoyed by
her failure to prove the contested point.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear, if the fine phrases won't bear putting into honest
English, the thoughts they express won't bear putting into your
innocent mind! That chapter is the key to the whole book, and if
you had been led up, or rather down, to it artfully and artistically,
you might have read it to yourself without seeing how bad it is. All
the worse for the undeniable talent which hides the evil so subtly
and makes the danger so delightful.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then added with an anxious glance at the
book, over which she was still bending, &quot;Finish it if you choose
only remember, my girl, that one may read at forty what is unsafe
at twenty, and that we never can be too careful what food we give
that precious yet perilous thing called imagination.&quot;</p>

<p>And taking his Review, he went away to look over a learned article
which interested him much less than the workings of a young mind
nearby.</p>

<p>Another long silence, broken only by an occasional excited bounce
from Jamie when the sociable cuttlefish looked in at the windows
or the Nautilus scuttled a ship or two in its terrific course. A bell
rang, and the doctor popped his head out to see if he was wanted.
It was only a message for Aunt Plenty, and he was about to pop in
again when his eye was caught by a square parcel on the slab.</p>

<p>&quot;What's this?&quot; he asked, taking it up.</p>

<p>&quot;Rose wants me to leave it at Kitty Van's when I go. I forgot to
bring her book from Mama, so I shall go and get it as soon as ever
I've done this,&quot; replied Jamie from his nest.</p>

<p>As the volume in his hands was a corpulent one, and Jamie only a
third of the way through, Dr. Alec thought Rose's prospect rather
doubtful and, slipping the parcel into his pocket, he walked away,
saying with a satisfied air: &quot;Virtue doesn't always get rewarded, but
it shall be this time if I can do it.&quot;</p>

<p>More than half an hour afterward, Rose woke from a little nap and
found the various old favorites with which she had tried to solace
herself replaced by the simple, wholesome story promised by Aunt
Jessie.</p>

<p>&quot;Good boy! I'll go and thank him,&quot; she said half aloud, jumping up,
wide awake and much pleased.</p>

<p>But she did not go, for just then she spied her uncle standing on the
rug warming his hands with a generally fresh and breezy look
about him which suggested a recent struggle with the elements.</p>

<p>&quot;How did this come?&quot; she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;A man brought it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This man? Oh, Uncle! Why did you take so much trouble just to
gratify a wish of mine?&quot; she cried, taking both the cold hands in
hers with a tenderly reproachful glance from the storm without to
the ruddy face above her.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, having taken away your French bonbons with the
poisonous color on them, I wanted to get you something better.
Here it is, all pure sugar, the sort that sweetens the heart as well as
the tongue and leaves no bad taste behind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How good you are to me! I don't deserve it, for I didn't resist
temptation, though I tried. Uncle, after I'd put the book away, I
thought I must just see how it ended, and I'm afraid I should have
read it all if it had not been gone,&quot; said Rose, laying her face down
on the hands she held as humbly as a repentant child.</p>

<p>But Uncle Alec lifted up the bent head and, looking into the eyes
that met his frankly, though either held a tear, he said, with the
energy that always made his words remembered: &quot;My little girl, I
would face a dozen storms far worse than this to keep your soul as
stainless as snow, for it is the small temptations which undermine
integrity unless we watch and pray and never think them too trivial
to be resisted.&quot;</p>

<p>Some people would consider Dr. Alec an overcareful man, but
Rose felt that he was right, and when she said her prayers that
night, added a meek petition to be kept from yielding to three of
the small temptations which beset a rich, pretty, and romantic girl
extravagance, coquetry, and novel reading.</p>
