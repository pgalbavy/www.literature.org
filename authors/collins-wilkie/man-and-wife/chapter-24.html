<P>
"WELL?" whispered Blanche, taking her uncle confidentially by the
arm.
<P>
"Well," said Sir Patrick, with a spark of his satirical humor
flashing out at his niece, "I am going to do a very rash thing. I
am going to place a serious trust in the hands of a girl of
eighteen."
<P>
"The girl's hands will keep it, uncle--though she _is_ only
eighteen."
<P>
"I must run the risk, my dear; your intimate knowledge of Miss
Silvester may be of the greatest assistance to me in the next
step I take. You shall know all that I can tell you, but I must
warn you first. I can only admit you into my confidence by
startling you with a great surprise. Do you follow me, so far?"
<P>
"Yes! yes!"
<P>
"If you fail to control yourself, you place an obstacle in the
way of my being of some future use to Miss Silvester. Remember
that, and now prepare for the surprise. What did I tell you
before dinner?"
<P>
"You said you had made discoveries at Craig Fernie. What have you
found out?"
<P>
"I have found out that there is a certain person who is in full
possession of the information which Miss Silvester has concealed
from you and from me. The person is within our reach. The person
is in this neighborhood. The person is in this room!"
<P>
He caught up Blanche's hand, resting on his arm, and pressed it
significantly. She looked at him with the cry of surprise
suspended on her lips--waited a little with her eyes fixed on Fir
Patrick's face--struggled resolutely, and composed herself.
<P>
"Point the person out." She said the words with a self-possession
which won her uncle's hearty approval. Blanche had done wonders
for a girl in her teens.
<P>
"Look!" said Sir Patrick; "and tell me what you see."
<P>
"I see Lady Lundie, at the other end of the room, with the map of
Perthshire and the Baronial Antiquities of Scotland on the table.
And I see every body but you and me obliged to listen to her."
<P>
"Every body?"
<P>
Blanche looked carefully round the room, and noticed Geoffrey in
the opposite corner; fast asleep by this time in his arm-chair.
<P>
"Uncle! you don't mean--?"
<P>
"There is the man."
<P>
"Mr. Delamayn--!"
<P>
"Mr. Delamayn knows every thing."
<P>
Blanche held mechanically by her uncle's arm, and looked at the
sleeping man as if her eyes could never see enough of him.
<P>
"You saw me in the library in private consultation with Mr.
Delamayn," resumed Sir Patrick. "I have to acknowledge, my dear,
that you were quite right in thinking this a suspicious
circumstance, And I am now to justify myself for having purposely
kept you in the dark up to the present time."
<P>
With those introductory words, he briefly reverted to the earlier
occurrences of the day, and then added, by way of commentary, a
statement of the conclusions which events had suggested to his
own mind.
<P>
The events, it may be remembered, were three in number. First,
Geoffrey's private conference with Sir Patrick on the subject of
Irregular Marriages in Scotla nd. Secondly, Anne Silvester's
appearance at Windygates. Thirdly, Anne's flight.
<P>
The conclusions which had thereupon suggested themselves to Sir
Patrick's mind were six in number.
<P>
First, that a connection of some sort might possibly exist
between Geoffrey's acknowledged difficulty about his friend, and
Miss Silvester's presumed difficulty about herself. Secondly,
that Geoffrey had really put to Sir Patrick--not his own
case--but the case of a friend. Thirdly, that Geoffrey had some
interest (of no harmless kind) in establishing the fact of his
friend's marriage. Fourthly, that Anne's anxiety (as described by
Blanche) to hear the names of the gentlemen who were staying at
Windygates, pointed, in all probability, to Geoffrey. Fifthly,
that this last inference disturbed the second conclusion, and
reopened the doubt whether Geoffrey had not been stating his own
case, after all, under pretense of stating the case of a friend.
Sixthly, that the one way of obtaining any enlightenment on this
point, and on all the other points involved in mystery, was to go
to Craig Fernie, and consult Mrs. Inchbare's experience during
the period of Anne's residence at the inn. Sir Patrick's apology
for keeping all this a secret from his niece followed. He had
shrunk from agitating her on the subject until he could be sure
of proving his conclusions to be true. The proof had been
obtained; and he was now, therefore, ready to open his mind to
Blanche without reserve.
<P>
"So much, my dear," proceeded Sir Patrick, "for those necessary
explanations which are also the necessary nuisances of human
intercourse. You now know as much as I did when I arrived at
Craig Fernie--and you are, therefore, in a position to appreciate
the value of my discoveries at the inn. Do you understand every
thing, so far?"
<P>
"Perfectly!"
<P>
"Very good. I drove up to the inn; and--behold me closeted with
Mrs. Inchbare in her own private parlor! (My reputation may or
may not suffer, but Mrs. Inchbare's bones are above suspicion!)
It was a long business, Blanche. A more sour-tempered, cunning,
and distrustful witness I never examined in all my experience at
the Bar. She would have upset the temper of any mortal man but a
lawyer. We have such wonderful tempers in our profession; and we
can be so aggravating when we like! In short, my dear, Mrs.
Inchbare was a she-cat, and I was a he-cat--and I clawed the
truth out of her at last. The result was well worth arriving at,
as you shall see. Mr. Delamayn had described to me certain
remarkable circumstances as taking place between a lady and a
gentleman at an inn: the object of the parties being to pass
themselves off at the time as man and wife. Every one of those
circumstances, Blanche, occurred at Craig Fernie, between a lady
and a gentleman, on the day when Miss Silvester disappeared from
this house And--wait!--being pressed for her name, after the
gentleman had left her behind him at the inn, the name the lady
gave was, 'Mrs. Silvester.' What do you think of that?"
<P>
"Think! I'm bewildered--I can't realize it."
<P>
"It's a startling discovery, my dear child--there is no denying
that. Shall I wait a little, and let you recover yourself?"
<P>
"No! no! Go on! The gentleman, uncle? The gentleman who was with
Anne? Who is he? Not Mr. Delamayn?"
<P>
"Not Mr. Delamayn," said Sir Patrick. "If I have proved nothing
else, I have proved that."
<P>
"What need was there to prove it? Mr. Delamayn went to London on
the day of the lawn-party. And Arnold--"
<P>
"And Arnold went with him as far as the second station from this.
Quite true! But how was I to know what Mr. Delamayn might have
done after Arnold had left him? I could only make sure that he
had not gone back privately to the inn, by getting the proof from
Mrs. Inchbare."
<P>
"How did you get it?"
<P>
"I asked her to describe the gentleman who was with Miss
Silvester. Mrs. Inchbare's description (vague as you will
presently find it to be) completely exonerates that man," said
Sir Patrick, pointing to Geoffrey still asleep in his chair.
"_He_ is not the person who passed Miss Silvester off as his wife
at Craig Fernie. He spoke the truth when he described the case to
me as the case of a friend."
<P>
"But who is the friend?" persisted Blanche. "That's what I want
to know."
<P>
"That's what I want to know, too."
<P>
"Tell me exactly, uncle, what Mrs. Inchbare said. I have lived
with Anne all my life. I _must_ have seen the man somewhere."
<P>
"If you can identify him by Mrs. Inchbare's description,"
returned Sir Patrick, "you will be a great deal cleverer than I
am. Here is the picture of the man, as painted by the landlady:
Young; middle-sized; dark hair, eyes, and complexion; nice
temper, pleasant way of speaking. Leave out 'young,' and the rest
is the exact contrary of Mr. Delamayn. So far, Mrs. Inchbare
guides us plainly enough. But how are we to apply her description
to the right person? There must be, at the lowest computation,
five hundred thousand men in England who are young, middle-sized,
dark, nice-tempered, and pleasant spoken. One of the footmen here
answers that description in every particular."
<P>
"And Arnold answers it," said Blanche--as a still stronger
instance of the provoking vagueness of the description.
<P>
"And Arnold answers it," repeated Sir Patrick, quite agreeing
with her.
<P>
They had barely said those words when Arnold himself appeared,
approaching Sir Patrick with a pack of cards in his hand.
<P>
There--at the very moment when they had both guessed the truth,
without feeling the slightest suspicion of it in their own
minds--there stood Discovery, presenting itself unconsciously to
eyes incapable of seeing it, in the person of the man who had
passed Anne Silvester off as his wife at the Craig Fernie inn!
The terrible caprice of Chance, the merciless irony of
Circumstance, could go no further than this. The three had their
feet on the brink of the precipice at that moment. And two of
them were smiling at an odd coincidence; and one of them was
shuffling a pack of cards!
<P>
"We have done with the Antiquities at last!" said Arnold; "and we
are going to play at Whist. Sir Patrick, will you choose a card?"
<P>
"Too soon after dinner, my good fellow, for _me_. Play the first
rubber, and then give me another chance. By-the-way," he added
"Miss Silvester has been traced to Kirkandrew. How is it that you
never saw her go by?"
<P>
"She can't have gone my way, Sir Patrick, or I must have seen
her."
<P>
Having justified himself in those terms, he was recalled to the
other end of the room by the whist-party, impatient for the cards
which he had in his hand.
<P>
"What were we talking of when he interrupted us?" said Sir
Patrick to Blanche.
<P>
"Of the man, uncle, who was with Miss Silvester at the inn."
<P>
"It's useless to pursue that inquiry, my dear, with nothing
better than Mrs. Inchbare's description to help us."
<P>
Blanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey.
<P>
"And _he_ knows!" she said. "It's maddening, uncle, to look at
the brute snoring in his chair!"
<P>
Sir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be
said between them they were silenced again by another
interruption,
<P>
The whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as
partners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon,
taking a lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to
their own devices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and,
detecting Geoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his
slumbers, under the all-sufficing apology of "Pool." Geoffrey
roused himself, and rubbed his eyes, and said, drowsily, "All
right." As he rose, he looked at the opposite corner in which Sir
Patrick and his niece were sitting. Blanche's self-possession,
resolutely as she struggled to preserve it, was not strong enough
to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with an expression
which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in him.
He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with
which the young lady was regarding him.
<P>
"Beg your pardon," said Geoffrey. "Do you wish to speak to me?"
<P>
Blanche's face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue.
<P>
"Miss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn," said
Sir Patrick, jocosely.
 "That's all."
<P>
"Oh? That's all?" said Geoffrey still looking at Blanche. "Beg
your pardon again. Deuced long walk, and deuced heavy dinner.
Natural consequence--a nap."
<P>
Sir Patrick eyed him closely. It was plain that he had been
honestly puzzled at finding himself an object of special
attention on Blanche's part. "See you in the billiard-room?" he
said, carelessly, and followed his companions out of the room--as
usual, without waiting for an answer.
<P>
"Mind what you are about," said Sir Patrick to his niece. "That
man is quicker than he looks. We commit a serious mistake if we
put him on his guard at starting."
<P>
"It sha'n't happen again, uncle," said Blanche. "But think of
_his_ being in Anne's confidence, and of _my_ being shut out of
it!"
<P>
"In his friend's confidence, you mean, my dear; and (if we only
avoid awakening his suspicion) there is no knowing how soon he
may say or do something which may show us who his friend is."
<P>
"But he is going back to his brother's to-morrow--he said so at
dinner-time."
<P>
"So much the better. He will be out of the way of seeing strange
things in a certain young lady's face. His brother's house is
within easy reach of this; and I am his legal adviser. My
experience tells me that he has not done consulting me yet--and
that he will let out something more next time. So much for our
chance of seeing the light through Mr. Delamayn--if we can't see
it in any other way. And that is not our only chance, remember. I
have something to tell you about Bishopriggs and the lost
letter."
<P>
"Is it found?"
<P>
"No. I satisfied myself about that--I had it searched for, under
my own eye. The letter is stolen, Blanche; and Bishopriggs has
got it. I have left a line for him, in Mrs. Inchbare's care. The
old rascal is missed already by the visitors at the inn, just as
I told you he would be. His mistress is feeling the penalty of
having been fool enough to vent her ill temper on her
head-waiter. She lays the whole blame of the quarrel on Miss
Silvester, of course. Bishopriggs neglected every body at the inn
to wait on Miss Silvester. Bishopriggs was insolent on being
remonstrated with, and Miss Silvester encouraged him--and so on.
The result will be--now Miss Silvester has gone--that Bishopriggs
will return to Craig Fernie before the autumn is over. We are
sailing with wind and tide, my dear. Come, and learn to play
whist."
<P>
He rose to join the card-players. Blanche detained him.
<P>
"You haven't told me one thing yet," she said. "Whoever the man
may be, is Anne married to him?"
<P>
"Whoever the man may be," returned Sir Patrick, "he had better
not attempt to marry any body else."
<P>
So the niece unconsciously put the question, and so the uncle
unconsciously gave the answer on which depended the whole
happiness of Blanche's life to come, The "man!" How lightly they
both talked of the "man!" Would nothing happen to rouse the
faintest suspicion--in their minds or in Arnold's mind--that
Arnold was the "man" himself?
<P>
"You mean that she _is_ married?" said Blanche.
<P>
"I don't go as far as that."
<P>
"You mean that she is _not_ married?"
<P>
"I don't go so far as _that._"
<P>
"Oh! the law! "
<P>
"Provoking, isn't it, my dear? I can tell you, professionally,
that (in my opinion) she has grounds to go on if she claims to be
the man's wife. That is what I meant by my answer; and, until we
know more, that is all I can say."
<P>
"When shall we know more? When shall we get the telegram?"
<P>
"Not for some hours yet. Come, and learn to play whist."
<P>
"I think I would rather talk to Arnold, uncle, if you don't
mind."
<P>
"By all means! But don't talk to him about what I have been
telling you to-night. He and Mr. Delamayn are old associates,
remember; and he might blunder into telling his friend what his
friend had better not know. Sad (isn't it?) for me to be
instilling these lessons of duplicity into the youthful mind. A
wise person once said, 'The older a man gets the worse he gets.'
That wise person, my dear, had me in his eye, and was perfectly
right."
<P>
He mitigated the pain of that confession with a pinch of snuff,
and went to the whist table to wait until the end of the rubber
gave him a place at the game.
