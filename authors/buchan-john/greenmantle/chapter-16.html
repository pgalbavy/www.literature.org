<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Two days later, in the evening, we came to Angora, the first
stage in our journey.</p>

<p>The passports had arrived next morning, as Frau von Einem had
promised, and with them a plan of our journey. More, one of the
Companions, who spoke a little English, was detailed to accompany
us—a wise precaution, for no one of us had a word of Turkish.
These were the sum of our instructions. I heard nothing more of
Sandy or Greenmantle or the lady. We were meant to travel in our
own party.</p>

<p>We had the railway to Angora, a very comfortable German <em>Schlafwagen</em>,
tacked to the end of a troop-train. There wasn’t much to be seen
of the country, for after we left the Bosporus we ran into scuds
of snow, and except that we seemed to be climbing on to a big
plateau I had no notion of the landscape. It was a marvel that
we made such good time, for that line was congested beyond anything
I have ever seen. The place was crawling with the Gallipoli troops,
and every siding was packed with supply trucks. When we stopped—which
we did on an average about once an hour—you could see vast camps
on both sides of the line, and often we struck regiments on the
march along the railway track. They looked a fine, hardy lot of
ruffians, but many were deplorably ragged, and I didn’t think
much of their boots. I wondered how they would do the five hundred
miles of road to Erzerum.</p>

<p>Blenkiron played Patience, and Peter and I took a hand at picquet,
but mostly we smoked and yarned. Getting away from that infernal
city had cheered us up wonderfully. Now we were out on the open
road, moving to the sound of the guns. At the worst, we should
not perish like rats in a sewer. We would be all together, too,
and that was a comfort. I think we felt the relief which a man
who has been on a lonely outpost feels when he is brought back
to his battalion. Besides, the thing had gone clean beyond our
power to direct. It was no good planning and scheming, for none
of us had a notion what the next step might be. We were fatalists
now, believing in Kismet, and that is a comfortable faith.</p>

<p>All but Blenkiron. The coming of Hilda von Einem into the business
had put a very ugly complexion on it for him. It was curious to
see how she affected the different members of our gang. Peter
did not care a rush: man, woman, and hippogriff were the same
to him; he met it all as calmly as if he were making plans to
round up an old lion in a patch of bush, taking the facts as they
came and working at them as if they were a sum in arithmetic.
Sandy and I were impressed—it’s no good denying it: horribly impressed—but
we were too interested to be scared, and we weren’t a bit fascinated.
We hated her too much for that. But she fairly struck Blenkiron
dumb. He said himself it was just like a rattlesnake and a bird.</p>

<p>I made him talk about her, for if he sat and brooded he would
get worse. It was a strange thing that this man, the most imperturbable
and, I think, about the most courageous I have ever met, should
be paralysed by a slim woman. There was no doubt about it. The
thought of her made the future to him as black as a thunder cloud.
It took the power out of his joints, and if she was going to be
much around, it looked as if Blenkiron might be counted out.</p>

<p>I suggested that he was in love with her, but this he vehemently
denied.</p>

<p>"No, Sir; I haven’t got no sort of affection for the lady. My
trouble is that she puts me out of countenance, and I can’t fit
her in as an antagonist. I guess we Americans haven’t got the
right poise for dealing with that kind of female. We’ve exalted
our womenfolk into little tin gods, and at the same time left
them out of the real business of life. Consequently, when we strike
one playing the biggest kind of man’s game we can’t place her.
We aren’t used to regarding them as anything except angels and
children. I wish I had had you boys’ upbringing."</p>

<p>Angora was like my notion of some place such as Amiens in the
retreat from Mons. It was one mass of troops and transport—the
neck of the bottle, for more arrived every hour, and the only
outlet was the single eastern road. The town was pandemonium into
which distracted German officers were trying to introduce some
order. They didn’t worry much about us, for the heart of Anatolia
wasn’t a likely hunting-ground for suspicious characters. We took
our passport to the commandant, who visaed them readily, and told
us he’d do his best to get us transport. We spent the night in
a sort of hotel, where all four crowded into one little bedroom,
and next morning I had my work cut out getting a motor-car. It
took four hours, and the use of every great name in the Turkish
Empire, to raise a dingy sort of Studebaker, and another two to
get the petrol and spare tyres. As for a chauffeur, love or money
couldn’t find him, and I was compelled to drive the thing myself.</p>

<p>We left just after midday and swung out into bare bleak downs
patched with scrubby woodlands. There was no snow here, but a
wind was blowing from the east which searched the marrow. Presently
we climbed up into hills, and the road, though not badly engineered
to begin with, grew as rough as the channel of a stream. No wonder,
for the traffic was like what one saw on that awful stretch between
Cassel and Ypres, and there were no gangs of Belgian roadmakers
to mend it up. We found troops by the thousands striding along
with their impassive Turkish faces, ox convoys, mule convoys,
wagons drawn by sturdy little Anatolian horses, and, coming in
the contrary direction, many shabby Red Crescent cars and wagons
of the wounded. We had to crawl for hours on end, till we got
past a block. Just before the darkening we seemed to outstrip
the first press, and had a clear run for about ten miles over
a low pass in the hills. I began to get anxious about the car,
for it was a poor one at the best, and the road was guaranteed
sooner or later to knock even a Rolls-Royce into scrap iron.</p>

<p>All the same it was glorious to be out in the open again. Peter’s
face wore a new look, and he sniffed the bitter air like a stag.
There floated up from little wayside camps the odour of wood-smoke
and dung-fires. That, and the curious acrid winter smell of great
wind-blown spaces, will always come to my memory as I think of
that day. Every hour brought me peace of mind and resolution.
I felt as I had felt when the battalion first marched from Aire
towards the firing-line, a kind of keying-up and wild expectation.
I’m not used to cities, and lounging about Constantinople had
slackened my fibre. Now, as the sharp wind buffeted us, I felt
braced to any kind of risk. We were on the great road to the east
and the border hills, and soon we should stand upon the farthest
battle-front of the war. This was no commonplace intelligence
job. That was all over, and we were going into the firing-zone,
going to take part in what might be the downfall of our enemies.
I didn’t reflect that we were among those enemies, and would probably
share their downfall if we were not shot earlier. The truth is,
I had got out of the way of regarding the thing as a struggle
between armies and nations. I hardly bothered to think where my
sympathies lay. First and foremost it was a contest between the
four of us and a crazy woman, and this personal antagonism made
the strife of armies only a dimly-felt background.</p>

<p>We slept that night like logs on the floor of a dirty khan, and
started next morning in a powder of snow. We were getting very
high up now, and it was perishing cold. The Companion—his name
sounded like Hussin—had travelled the road before and told me
what the places were, but they conveyed nothing to me. All morning
we wriggled through a big lot of troops, a brigade at least, who
swung along at a great pace with a fine free stride that I don’t
think I have ever seen bettered. I must say I took a fancy to
the Turkish fighting man: I remembered the testimonial our fellows
gave him as a clean fighter, and I felt very bitter that Germany
should have lugged him into this dirty business. They halted for
a meal, and we stopped, too, and lunched off some brown bread
and dried figs and a flask of very sour wine. I had a few words
with one of the officers who spoke a little German. He told me
they were marching straight for Russia, since there had been a
great Turkish victory in the Caucasus. "We have beaten the French
and the British, and now it is Russia’s turn," he said stolidly,
as if repeating a lesson. But he added that he was mortally sick
of war.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we cleared the column and had an open road for
some hours. The land now had a tilt eastward, as if we were moving
towards the valley of a great river. Soon we began to meet little
parties of men coming from the east with a new look in their faces.
The first lots of wounded had been the ordinary thing you see
on every front, and there had been some pretence at organization.
But these new lots were very weary and broken; they were often
barefoot, and they seemed to have lost their transport and to
be starving. You would find a group stretched by the roadside
in the last stages of exhaustion. Then would come a party limping
along, so tired that they never turned their heads to look at
us. Almost all were wounded, some badly, and most were horribly
thin. I wondered how my Turkish friend behind would explain the
sight to his men, if he believed in a great victory. They had
not the air of the backwash of a conquering army.</p>

<p>Even Blenkiron, who was no soldier, noticed it.</p>

<p>"These boys look mighty bad," he observed. "We’ve got to hustle,
Major, if we’re going to get seats for the last act."</p>

<p>That was my own feeling. The sight made me mad to get on faster,
for I saw that big things were happening in the East. I had reckoned
that four days would take us from Angora to Erzerum, but here
was the second nearly over and we were not yet a third of the
way. I pressed on recklessly, and that hurry was our undoing.</p>

<p>I have said that the Studebaker was a rotten old car. Its steering-gear
was pretty dicky, and the bad surface and continual hairpin bends
of the road didn’t improve it. Soon we came into snow lying fairly
deep, frozen hard and rutted by the big transport-wagons. We bumped
and bounced horribly, and were shaken about like peas in a bladder.
I began to be acutely anxious about the old boneshaker, the more
as we seemed a long way short of the village I had proposed to
spend the night in. Twilight was falling and we were still in
an unfeatured waste, crossing the shallow glen of a stream. There
was a bridge at the bottom of a slope—a bridge of logs and earth
which had apparently been freshly strengthened for heavy traffic.
As we approached it at a good pace the car ceased to answer to
the wheel.</p>

<p>I struggled desperately to keep it straight, but it swerved to
the left and we plunged over a bank into a marshy hollow. There
was a sickening bump as we struck the lower ground, and the whole
party were shot out into the frozen slush. I don’t yet know how
I escaped, for the car turned over and by rights I should have
had my back broken. But no one was hurt. Peter was laughing, and
Blenkiron, after shaking the snow out of his hair, joined him.
For myself I was feverishly examining the machine. It was about
as ugly as it could be, for the front axle was broken.</p>

<p>Here was a piece of hopeless bad luck. We were stuck in the middle
of Asia Minor with no means of conveyance, for to get a new axle
there was as likely as to find snowballs on the Congo. It was
all but dark and there was no time to lose. I got out the petrol
tins and spare tyres and cached them among some rocks on the hillside.
Then we collected our scanty baggage from the derelict Studebaker.
Our only hope was Hussin. He had got to find us some lodging for
the night, and next day we would have a try for horses or a lift
in some passing wagon. I had no hope of another car. Every automobile
in Anatolia would now be at a premium.</p>

<p>It was so disgusting a mishap that we all took it quietly. It
was too bad to be helped by hard swearing. Hussin and Peter set
off on different sides of the road to prospect for a house, and
Blenkiron and I sheltered under the nearest rock and smoked savagely.</p>

<p>Hussin was the first to strike oil. He came back in twenty minutes
with news of some kind of dwelling a couple of miles up the stream.
He went off to collect Peter, and, humping our baggage, Blenkiron
and I plodded up the waterside. Darkness had fallen thick by this
time, and we took some bad tosses among the bogs. When Hussin
and Peter overtook us they found a better road, and presently
we saw a light twinkle in the hollow ahead.</p>

<p>It proved to be a wretched tumble-down farm in a grove of poplars—a
foul-smelling, muddy yard, a two-roomed hovel of a house, and
a barn which was tolerably dry and which we selected for our sleeping-place.
The owner was a broken old fellow whose sons were all at the war,
and he received us with the profound calm of one who expects nothing
but unpleasantness from life.</p>

<p>By this time we had recovered our tempers, and I was trying hard
to put my new Kismet philosophy into practice. I reckoned that
if risks were foreordained, so were difficulties, and both must
be taken as part of the day’s work. With the remains of our provisions
and some curdled milk we satisfied our hunger and curled ourselves
up among the pease straw of the barn. Blenkiron announced with
a happy sigh that he had now been for two days quit of his dyspepsia.</p>

<p>That night, I remember, I had a queer dream. I seemed to be in
a wild place among mountains, and I was being hunted, though who
was after me I couldn’t tell. I remember sweating with fright,
for I seemed to be quite alone and the terror that was pursuing
me was more than human. The place was horribly quiet and still,
and there was deep snow lying everywhere, so that each step I
took was heavy as lead. A very ordinary sort of nightmare, you
will say. Yes, but there was one strange feature in this one.
The night was pitch dark, but ahead of me in the throat of the
pass there was one patch of light, and it showed a rum little
hill with a rocky top: what we call in South Africa a <em>castrol</em>
or saucepan. I had a notion that if I could get to that <em>castrol</em>
I should be safe, and I panted through the drifts towards it with
the avenger of blood at my heels. I woke, gasping, to find the
winter morning struggling through the cracked rafters, and to
hear Blenkiron say cheerily that his duodenum had behaved all
night like a gentleman. I lay still for a bit trying to fix the
dream, but it all dissolved into haze except the picture of the
little hill, which was quite clear in every detail. I told myself
it was a reminiscence of the veld, some spot down in the Wakkerstroom
country, though for the life of me I couldn’t place it.</p>

<p>I pass over the next three days, for they were one uninterrupted
series of heart-breaks. Hussin and Peter scoured the country for
horses, Blenkiron sat in the barn and played Patience, while I
haunted the roadside near the bridge in the hope of picking up
some kind of conveyance. My task was perfectly futile. The columns
passed, casting wondering eyes on the wrecked car among the frozen
rushes, but they could offer no help. My friend the Turkish officer
promised to wire to Angora from some place or other for a fresh
car, but, remembering the state of affairs at Angora, I had no
hope from that quarter. Cars passed, plenty of them, packed with
staff-officers, Turkish and German, but they were in far too big
a hurry even to stop and speak. The only conclusion I reached
from my roadside vigil was that things were getting very warm
in the neighbourhood of Erzerum. Everybody on that road seemed
to be in mad haste either to get there or to get away.</p>

<p>Hussin was the best chance, for, as I have said, the Companions
had a very special and peculiar graft throughout the Turkish Empire.
But the first day he came back empty-handed. All the horses had
been commandeered for the war, he said; and though he was certain
that some had been kept back and hidden away, he could not get
on their track. The second day he returned with two—miserable
screws and deplorably short in the wind from a diet of beans.
There was no decent corn or hay left in the countryside. The third
day he picked up a nice little Arab stallion: in poor condition,
it is true, but perfectly sound. For these beasts we paid good
money, for Blenkiron was well supplied and we had no time to spare
for the interminable Oriental bargaining.</p>

<p>Hussin said he had cleaned up the countryside, and I believed
him. I dared not delay another day, even though it meant leaving
him behind. But he had no notion of doing anything of the kind.
He was a good runner, he said, and could keep up with such horses
as ours for ever. If this was the manner of our progress, I reckoned
we would be weeks in getting to Erzerum.</p>

<p>We started at dawn on the morning of the fourth day, after the
old farmer had blessed us and sold us some stale rye-bread. Blenkiron
bestrode the Arab, being the heaviest, and Peter and I had the
screws. My worst forebodings were soon realized, and Hussin, loping
along at my side, had an easy job to keep up with us. We were
about as slow as an ox-wagon. The brutes were unshod, and with
the rough roads I saw that their feet would very soon go to pieces.
We jogged along like a tinker’s caravan, about five miles to the
hour, as feckless a party as ever disgraced a highroad.</p>

<p>The weather was now a drizzle, which increased my depression.
Cars passed us and disappeared in the mist, going at thirty miles
an hour to mock our slowness. None of us spoke, for the futility
of the business clogged our spirits. I bit hard on my lip to curb
my restlessness, and I think I would have sold my soul there and
then for anything that could move fast. I don’t know any sorer
trial than to be mad for speed and have to crawl at a snail’s
pace. I was getting ripe for any kind of desperate venture.</p>

<p>About midday we descended on a wide plain full of the marks of
rich cultivation. Villages became frequent, and the land was studded
with olive groves and scarred with water furrows. From what I
remembered of the map I judged that we were coming to that champagne
country near Siwas, which is the granary of Turkey, and the home
of the true Osmanli stock.</p>

<p>Then at the turning of the road we came to the caravanserai.</p>

<p>It was a dingy, battered place, with the pink plaster falling
in patches from its walls. There was a courtyard abutting on the
road, and a flat-topped house with a big hole in its side. It
was a long way from any battle-ground, and I guessed that some
explosion had wrought the damage. Behind it, a few hundred yards
off, a detachment of cavalry were encamped beside a stream, with
their horses tied up in long lines of pickets.</p>

<p>And by the roadside, quite alone and deserted, stood a large
new motor-car.</p>

<p>In all the road before and behind there was no man to be seen
except the troops by the stream. The owners, whoever they were,
must be inside the caravanserai.</p>

<p>I have said I was in the mood for some desperate deed, and lo
and behold providence had given me the chance! I coveted that
car as I have never coveted anything on earth. At the moment all
my plans had narrowed down to a feverish passion to get to the
battle-field. We had to find Greenmantle at Erzerum, and once
there we should have Hilda von Einem’s protection. It was a time
of war, and a front of brass was the surest safety. But, indeed,
I could not figure out any plan worth speaking of. I saw only
one thing—a fast car which might be ours.</p>

<p>I said a word to the others, and we dismounted and tethered our
horses at the near end of the courtyard. I heard the low hum of
voices from the cavalrymen by the stream, but they were three
hundred yards off and could not see us. Peter was sent forward
to scout in the courtyard. In the building itself there was but
one window looking on the road, and that was in the upper floor.</p>

<p>Meantime I crawled along beside the wall to where the car stood,
and had a look at it. It was a splendid six-cylinder affair, brand
new, with the tyres little worn. There were seven tins of petrol
stacked behind as well as spare tyres, and, looking in, I saw
map-cases and field-glasses strewn on the seats as if the owners
had only got out for a minute to stretch their legs.</p>

<p>Peter came back and reported that the courtyard was empty.</p>

<p>"There are men in the upper room," he said; "more than one, for
I heard their voices. They are moving about restlessly, and may
soon be coming out."</p>

<p>I reckoned that there was no time to be lost, so I told the others
to slip down the road fifty yards beyond the caravanserai and
be ready to climb in as I passed. I had to start the infernal
thing, and there might be shooting.</p>

<p>I waited by the car till I saw them reach the right distance.
I could hear voices from the second floor of the house and footsteps
moving up and down. I was in a fever of anxiety, for any moment
a man might come to the window. Then I flung myself on the starting
handle and worked like a demon.</p>

<p>The cold made the job difficult, and my heart was in my mouth,
for the noise in that quiet place must have woke the dead. Then,
by the mercy of Heaven, the engine started, and I sprang to the
driving seat, released the clutch, and opened the throttle. The
great car shot forward, and I seemed to hear behind me shrill
voices. A pistol bullet bored through my hat, and another buried
itself in a cushion beside me.</p>

<p>In a second I was clear of the place and the rest of the party
were embarking. Blenkiron got on the step and rolled himself like
a sack of coals into the tonneau. Peter nipped up beside me, and
Hussin scrambled in from the back over the folds of the hood.
We had our baggage in our pockets and had nothing to carry.</p>

<p>Bullets dropped round us, but did no harm. Then I heard a report
at my ear, and out of a corner of my eye saw Peter lower his pistol.
Presently we were out of range, and, looking back, I saw three
men gesticulating in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>"May the devil fly away with this pistol," said Peter ruefully.
"I never could make good shooting with a little gun. Had I had
my rifle..."</p>

<p>"What did you shoot for?" I asked in amazement. "We’ve got the
fellows’ car, and we don’t want to do them any harm."</p>

<p>"It would have saved trouble had I had my rifle," said Peter,
quietly. "The little man you call Rasta was there, and he knew
you. I heard him cry your name. He is an angry little man, and
I observe that on this road there is a telegraph."</p>
