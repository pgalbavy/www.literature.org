<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On a fair Saturday afternoon in November Penrod's little old
dog Duke returned to the ways of his youth and had trouble with
a strange cat on the back porch. This indiscretion, so uncharacteristic,
was due to the agitation of a surprised moment, for Duke's experience
had inclined him to a peaceful pessimism, and he had no ambition
for hazardous undertakings of any sort. He was given to musing
but not to avoidable action, and he seemed habitually to hope
for something that he was pretty sure would not happen. Even in
his sleep, this gave him an air of wistfulness.</p>

<p>Thus, being asleep in a nook behind the metal refuse-can, when
the strange cat ventured to ascend the steps of the porch, his
appearance was so unwarlike that the cat felt encouraged to extend
its field of reconnaissance for the cook had been careless, and
the backbone of a three-pound whitefish lay at the foot of the
refuse-can.</p>

<p>This cat was, for a cat, needlessly tall, powerful, independent
and masculine. Once, long ago, he had been a roly-poly pepper-and-salt
kitten; he had a home in those days, and a name, "Gipsy," which
he abundantly justified. He was precocious in dissipation. Long
before his adolescence, his lack of domesticity was ominous, and
he had formed bad companionships. Meanwhile, he grew so rangy,
and developed such length and power of leg and such traits of
character, that the father of the little girl who owned him was
almost convincing when he declared that the young cat was half
broncho and half Malay pirate&mdash;though, in the light of Gipsy's
later career, this seems bitterly unfair to even the lowest orders
of bronchos and Malay pirates.</p>

<p>No; Gipsy was not the pet for a little girl. The rosy hearthstone
and sheltered rug were too circumspect for him. Surrounded by
the comforts of middle-class respectability, and profoundly oppressed,
even in his youth, by the Puritan ideals of the household, he
sometimes experienced a sense of suffocation. He wanted free air
and he wanted free life; he wanted the lights, the lights and
the music. He abandoned the bourgeoise irrevocably. He went forth
in a May twilight, carrying the evening beefsteak with him, and
joined the underworld.</p>

<p>His extraordinary size, his daring and his utter lack of sympathy
soon made him the leader&mdash;and, at the same time, the terror&mdash;of
all the loose-lived cats in a wide neighbourhood. He contracted
no friendships and had no confidants. He seldom slept in the same
place twice in succession, and though he was wanted by the police,
he was not found. In appearance he did not lack distinction of
an ominous sort; the slow, rhythmic, perfectly controlled mechanism
of his tail, as he impressively walked abroad, was incomparably
sinister. This stately and dangerous walk of his, his long, vibrant
whiskers, his scars, his yellow eye, so ice-cold, so fire-hot,
haughty as the eye of Satan, gave him the deadly air of a mousquetaire
duellist. His soul was in that walk and in that eye; it could
be read&mdash;the soul of a bravo of fortune, living on his wits and
his velour, asking no favours and granting no quarter. Intolerant,
proud, sullen, yet watchful and constantly planning&mdash;purely a
militarist, believing in slaughter as in a religion, and confident
that art, science, poetry and the good of the world were happily
advanced thereby &mdash;Gipsy had become, though technically not
a wildcat, undoubtedly the most untamed cat at large in the civilized
world. Such, in brief, was the terrifying creature that now elongated
its neck, and, over the top step of the porch, bent a calculating
scrutiny upon the wistful and slumberous Duke.</p>

<p>The scrutiny was searching but not prolonged. Gipsy muttered
contemptuously to himself, "Oh, sheol; I'm not afraid o' <em>THAT!"
</em>And he approached the fishbone, his padded feet making no
noise upon the boards. It was a desirable fishbone, large, with
a considerable portion of the fish's tail still attached to it.</p>

<p>It was about a foot from Duke's nose, and the little dog's dreams
began to be troubled by his olfactory nerve. This faithful sentinel,
on guard even while Duke slept, signalled that alarums and excursions
by parties unknown were taking place, and suggested that attention
might well be paid. Duke opened one drowsy eye. What that eye
beheld was monstrous.</p>

<p>Here was a strange experience&mdash;the horrific vision in the midst
of things so accustomed. Sunshine fell sweetly upon porch and
backyard; yonder was the familiar stable, and from its interior
came the busy hum of a carpenter shop, established that morning
by Duke's young master, in association with Samuel Williams and
Herman. Here, close by, were the quiet refuse-can and the wonted
brooms and mops leaning against the latticed wall at the end of
the porch, and there, by the foot of the steps, was the stone
slab of the cistern, with the iron cover displaced and lying beside
the round opening, where the carpenters had left it, not half
an hour ago, after lowering a stick of wood into the water, "to
season it". All about Duke were these usual and reassuring environs
of his daily life, and yet it was his fate to behold, right in
the midst of them, and in ghastly juxtaposition to his face, a
thing of nightmare and lunacy.</p>

<p>Gipsy had seized the fishbone by the middle. Out from one side
of his head, and mingling with his whiskers, projected the long,
spiked spine of the big fish; down from the other side of that
ferocious head dangled the fish's tail, and from above the remarkable
effect thus produced shot the intolerable glare of two yellow
eyes. To the gaze of Duke, still blurred by slumber, this monstrosity
was all of one piece the bone seemed a living part of it. What
he saw was like those interesting insect-faces that the magnifying
glass reveals to great M. Fabre. It was impossible for Duke to
maintain the philosophic calm of M. Fabre, however; there was
no magnifying glass between him and this spined and spiky face.
Indeed, Duke was not in a position to think the matter over quietly.
If he had been able to do that, he would have said to himself:
"We have here an animal of most peculiar and unattractive appearance,
though, upon examination, it seems to be only a cat stealing a
fishbone. Nevertheless, as the thief is large beyond all my recollection
of cats and has an unpleasant stare, I will leave this spot at
once."</p>

<p>On the contrary, Duke was so electrified by his horrid awakening
that he completely lost his presence of mind. In the very instant
of his first eye's opening, the other eye and his mouth behaved
similarly, the latter loosing upon the quiet air one shriek of
mental agony before the little dog scrambled to his feet and gave
further employment to his voice in a frenzy of profanity. At the
same time the subterranean diapason of a demoniac bass viol was
heard; it rose to a wail, and rose and rose again till it screamed
like a small siren. It was Gipsy's war-cry, and, at the sound
of it, Duke became a frothing maniac. He made a convulsive frontal
attack upon the hobgoblin&mdash;and the massacre began.</p>

<p>Never releasing the fishbone for an instant, Gipsy laid back
his ears in a chilling way, beginning to shrink into himself like
a concertina, but rising amidships so high that he appeared to
be giving an imitation of that peaceful beast, the dromedary.
Such was not his purpose, however, for, having attained his greatest
possible altitude, he partially sat down and elevated his right
arm after the manner of a semaphore. This semaphore arm remained
rigid for a second, threatening; then it vibrated with inconceivable
rapidity, feinting. But it was the treacherous left that did the
work. Seemingly this left gave Duke three lightning little pats
upon the right ear; but the change in his voice indicated that
these were no love-taps. He yelled "help!" and "bloody murder!"</p>

<p>Never had such a shattering uproar, all vocal, broken out upon
a peaceful afternoon. Gipsy possessed a vocabulary for cat-swearing
certainly second to none out of Italy, and probably equal to the
best there, while Duke remembered and uttered things he had not
thought of for years.</p>

<p>The hum of the carpenter shop ceased, and Sam Williams appeared
in the stable doorway. He stared insanely.</p>

<p>"My gorry!" he shouted. "Duke's havin' a fight with the biggest
cat you ever saw in your life! C'mon!"</p>

<p>His feet were already in motion toward the battlefield, with
Penrod and Herman hurrying in his wake. Onward they sped, and
Duke was encouraged by the sight and sound of these reenforcements
to increase his own outrageous clamours and to press home his
attack. But he was ill-advised. This time it was the right arm
of the semaphore that dipped&mdash;and Duke's honest nose was but too
conscious of what happened in consequence.</p>

<p>A lump of dirt struck the refuse-can with violence, and Gipsy
beheld the advance of overwhelming forces. They rushed upon him
from two directions, cutting off the steps of the porch. Undaunted,
the formidable cat raked Duke's nose again, somewhat more lingeringly,
and prepared to depart with his fishbone. He had little fear for
himself, because he was inclined to think that, unhampered, he
could whip anything on earth; still, things seemed to be growing
rather warm and he saw nothing to prevent his leaving.</p>

<p>And though he could laugh in the face of so unequal an antagonist
as Duke, Gipsy felt that he was never at his best or able to do
himself full justice unless he could perform that feline operation
inaccurately known as "spitting". To his notion, this was an absolute
essential to combat; but, as all cats of the slightest pretensions
to technique perfectly understand, it can neither be well done
nor produce the best effects unless the mouth be opened to its
utmost capacity so as to expose the beginnings of the alimentary
canal, down which&mdash;at least that is the intention of the threat&mdash;the
opposing party will soon be passing. And Gipsy could not open
his mouth without relinquishing his fishbone.</p>

<p>Therefore, on small accounts he decided to leave the field to
his enemies and to carry the fishbone elsewhere. He took two giant
leaps. The first landed him upon the edge of the porch. There,
without an instant's pause, he gathered his fur-sheathed muscles,
concentrated himself into one big steel spring, and launched himself
superbly into space. He made a stirring picture, however brief,
as he left the solid porch behind him and sailed upward on an
ascending curve into the sunlit air. His head was proudly up;
he was the incarnation of menacing power and of self-confidence.
It is possible that the whitefish's spinal column and flopping
tail had interfered with his vision, and in launching himself
he may have mistaken the dark, round opening of the cistern for
its dark, round cover. In that case, it was a leap calculated
and executed with precision, for as the boys clamoured their pleased
astonishment, Gipsy descended accurately into the orifice and
passed majestically from public view, with the fishbone still
in his mouth and his haughty head still high.</p>

<p>There was a grand splash!</p>
