<p>When Captain Bergen was inclined to become pessimistic, the mate
treated it lightly, for he feared the strong sailor would break
before long from sheer homesickness.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that neither had any family, the mate being
one of those who are without any close living relative, while
the captain had a sister in New England, and his aged mother was
in San Francisco, living with a nephew, of whom she was very fond.</p>

<p>Thus the three years passed away, and the second era in their
lives approached. There was something curious in the fact that
all the inhabitants of the lonely Pearl Island had lost their
reckoning. No two could agree on the day of the week, and when
they compromised on one, which was called Sunday, and observed
as such, they were much in doubt whether they were right, and,
as it afterward proved, they were not.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the sun had hardly passed the meridian, the
mate and captain were stretched upon the beach under the shade
of a palm-tree, and looking out upon the sea, over which they
had come to this desolate spot so long before. The day was cooler
than usual, and a steady breeze blew, rendering the position of
the friends in that respect as pleasant as they could wish, though
their weary, homesick feeling was telling upon them. Both the
ragged sailors were thinner, and there was a yearning, far-away
look in their eyes, especially in those of the captain, which
presaged the approach of insanity or death at no distant day,
unless a change were made in their condition and surroundings.
This lamentable state was partly due, no doubt, to the diet to
which they had been subjected for many months.</p>

<p>Inez, who seemed happy everywhere and at all times, was busying
herself in the cabin, where she could find plenty to do; and ever
and anon the sound of her voice could be heard, as she sang some
snatch of song, which came through the mist of memory from her
infancy.</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," said Captain Bergen, in his low, determined
voice, "this thing cannot continue much longer."</p>

<p>"You are no more weary of it than I, Jack; but show me the way
in which it can be ended."</p>

<p>"We've got to take the risk. The tender there is large enough
to carry us and a good supply of provisions&mdash;that is, enough water,
to last several days. We can rig some sort of sail, and, in less
than a week, by keeping to the northwest, we shall reach some
inhabited island, unless we should be picked up before that time,
which I consider quite likely."</p>

<p>"I've thought a good deal of it, Jack," said the mate, in a voice
of equal seriousness. "We have been restrained heretofore by the
fear that it would endanger too greatly the safety of Inez, and
mainly by the feeling that we couldn't stay here long without
assistance being summoned by that signal fluttering up there.
And yet, three years have come and gone," continued the mate,
"and not a living soul has come to us. There have been hundreds
of days within this long period when we might have embarked on
board the little boat and safely made our way to some other port,
but we could not know it, and the result is&mdash;here we are."</p>

<p>"And the situation is very different from what it was when we
first landed, for it is now a choice between staying here with
the certainty of miserably perishing&mdash;every one of us&mdash;and of
starting boldly out upon an unknown sea, as it may be called,
with the chances between life and death about even."</p>

<p>"You have stated the case correctly," assented Mr. Storms; "and
though it is your place to command, yet as you have deferred to
me, I give you my promise that to-morrow we shall begin rigging
the best sort of sail we can, and at daylight on the next day
we will start for whatever port Providence directs us."</p>

<p>"That has put new life into me, Abe. I feel now as I did three
years ago, when we first caught sight of those pearls. I am ten
years younger. I prefer a bold stroke for life to a weak submission
to fate, with this dismal waiting for help to come to us. By the
great horn spoon! a thousand such pearl banks as we cleaned out
wouldn't tempt me to spend another year on this hated island&#11834;"</p>

<p>At this instant the voice of Inez was heard, excitedly calling
to them, and while they rose to the sitting position and looked
inquiringly in that direction, she was seen to spring through
the open door of the cabin, and to come running toward them on
the beach, bareheaded and with her long, yellow hair streaming
in the wind.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter with her?" exclaimed the captain, rising
to his feet. "What is she saying?"</p>

<p>"Hark!"</p>

<p>The distance was so short that the girl was at their side a second
or two later. She was laughing, and uttering something in her
excitement, which, until that moment, they did not understand.</p>

<p>"Who ever saw any one so stupid?" she called out, cheerily. "What
are your eyes for? Why don't you look out to sea?"</p>

<p>The two obeyed, and an exclamation of amazement escaped both,
for there, while they had lain on the beach talking in such disconsolate
tones, and looking dreamily out upon the ocean, a craft had been
steadily approaching, and neither of the two saw it.</p>

<p>At the furthest, it was no more than a mile distant, and, since
it was heading straight in toward the atoll, the chances were
a hundred to one that the signal of distress had been seen, and
the lonely island at last was going to have a visitor.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen muttered something about the "great horn spoon,"
under his breath, while Storms said nothing, but gazed steadily
at the craft, upon which his hopes were so suddenly and strongly
fixed. It might be that the hearts of all three bounded with hope
at this sight of a vessel, but the hope was mixed with apprehension,
for the sailors saw it was not the sort of vessel for which they
had been praying so long.</p>

<p>Instead of a gallant ship, with the Stars and Stripes streaming
from the fore, it was what is termed a flying proa, which is the
name applied to the narrow canoes used principally in the Ladrone
Islands. They are about thirty feet long, three feet wide, and
are steered by a paddle at either end. The sail is lateen, with
a boom upon one mast; the prow and stern curve to a high point,
and the depth being considerably greater than the width, the proa
would, if unsupported, capsize instantly, but a hollow log or
heavy-pointed spar rests on the water, parallel with the windward
side, and, being secured in place, acts as an outrigger and removes
the danger of overturning. The same name is applied to the boats
used by the Malays, and which are propelled by both oars and sails.</p>

<p>But the one which greeted the astonished eyes of Storms and Bergen
had its huge lateen sail spread, and was moving with great velocity,
for the proas of the Indian and Pacific oceans are probably the
fastest boats in the world. It rode the waters like a bird, and
would soon enter the lagoon within the island, for there could
be no doubt that the men on board had seen not only the signal,
but the persons themselves who were waiting for them.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as a couple of men were discernible with the naked eye
on the proa, it followed that the latter must descry the three
individuals who were standing out in full view upon the shore
of the island.</p>

<p>"How about this?" asked Captain Bergen, stepping to the side
of his mate, and speaking in an undertone. "Shall we rejoice or
not?"</p>

<p>"It's uncertain," was the dubious reply. "Those boats generally
carry the vagabonds of the ocean, and the last motive which, as
a rule, brings them to a spot like this is humanity."</p>

<p>"Where's your glass?"</p>

<p>"I declare, I never thought of that &mdash;I was so surprised!"</p>

<p>Storms carried it with him always, and he now brought it to bear
upon the singular-looking craft approaching. It was so close inshore
that, with the aid of the instrument, he was able to see everything
distinctly, especially as the boat at that moment bore off a little
and then headed toward the entrance again.</p>

<p>So far as could be ascertained, there were three persons on the
boat, and the captain reached the same conclusion after using
the glass.</p>

<p>"If that's the case," said Captain Bergen, "we haven't anything
to fear from them, for, with our guns and ammunition, we can hold
our own against a dozen South Sea Islanders."</p>

<p>"There may be others concealed about the craft, but I incline
to think not. However, it's best to be prepared. So let's get
to the house and make ready to receive them&mdash;whether they come
as enemies or friends."</p>

<p>The suggestion was a prudent one, and the two men hurried up
the beach in the direction of the cabin, while Inez remained to
watch the proa. The men examined their rifles and saw they were
loaded and ready for instant use, and then, bearing one apiece,
they came forth again. As they did so, something like a shadow
seemed to shoot through the trees, and, looking toward the lagoon,
they saw the cause. The proa had entered the quiet waters within,
and was coming to rest as gracefully as a sea gull stops in its
flight.</p>
