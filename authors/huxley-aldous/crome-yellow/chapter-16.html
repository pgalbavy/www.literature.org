<p>The ladies had left the room and the port was circulating. Mr.
Scogan filled his glass, passed on the decanter, and, leaning
back in his chair, looked about him for a moment in silence. The
conversation rippled idly round him, but he disregarded it; he
was smiling at some private joke. Gombauld noticed his smile.</p>

<p>"What’s amusing you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was just looking at you all, sitting round this table," said
Mr. Scogan.</p>

<p>"Are we as comic as all that?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mr. Scogan answered politely. "I was merely amused
by my own speculations."</p>

<p>"And what were they?"</p>

<p>"The idlest, the most academic of speculations. I was looking
at you one by one and trying to imagine which of the first six
Caesars you would each resemble, if you were given the opportunity
of behaving like a Caesar. The Caesars are one of my touchstones,"
Mr. Scogan explained. "They are characters functioning, so to
speak, in the void. They are human beings developed to their logical
conclusions. Hence their unequalled value as a touchstone, a standard.
When I meet someone for the first time, I ask myself this question:
Given the Caesarean environment, which of the Caesars would this
person resemble &mdash;Julius, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,
Nero? I take each trait of character, each mental and emotional
bias, each little oddity, and magnify them a thousand times. The
resulting image gives me his Caesarean formula."</p>

<p>"And which of the Caesars do you resemble?" asked Gombauld.</p>

<p>"I am potentially all of them," Mr. Scogan replied, "all&mdash;with
the possible exception of Claudius, who was much too stupid to
be a development of anything in my character. The seeds of Julius’s
courage and compelling energy, of Augustus’s prudence, of the
libidinousness and cruelty of Tiberius, of Caligula’s folly, of
Nero’s artistic genius and enormous vanity, are all within me.
Given the opportunities, I might have been something fabulous.
But circumstances were against me. I was born and brought up in
a country rectory; I passed my youth doing a great deal of utterly
senseless hard work for a very little money. The result is that
now, in middle age, I am the poor thing that I am. But perhaps
it is as well. Perhaps, too, it’s as well that Denis hasn’t been
permitted to flower into a little Nero, and that Ivor remains
only potentially a Caligula. Yes, it’s better so, no doubt. But
it would have been more amusing, as a spectacle, if they had had
the chance to develop, untrammelled, the full horror of their
potentialities. It would have been pleasant and interesting to
watch their tics and foibles and little vices swelling and burgeoning
and blossoming into enormous and fantastic flowers of cruelty
and pride and lewdness and avarice. The Caesarean environment
makes the Caesar, as the special food and the queenly cell make
the queen bee. We differ from the bees in so far that, given the
proper food, they can be sure of making a queen every time. With
us there is no such certainty; out of every ten men placed in
the Caesarean environment one will be temperamentally good, or
intelligent, or great. The rest will blossom into Caesars; he
will not. Seventy and eighty years ago simple-minded people, reading
of the exploits of the Bourbons in South Italy, cried out in amazement:
To think that such things should be happening in the nineteenth
century! And a few years since we too were astonished to find
that in our still more astonishing twentieth century, unhappy
blackamoors on the Congo and the Amazon were being treated as
English serfs were treated in the time of Stephen. To-day we are
no longer surprised at these things. The Black and Tans harry
Ireland, the Poles maltreat the Silesians, the bold Fascisti slaughter
their poorer countrymen: we take it all for granted. Since the
war we wonder at nothing. We have created a Caesarean environment
and a host of little Caesars has sprung up. What could be more
natural?"</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan drank off what was left of his port and refilled the
glass.</p>

<p>"At this very moment," he went on, "the most frightful horrors
are taking place in every corner of the world. People are being
crushed, slashed, disembowelled, mangled; their dead bodies rot
and their eyes decay with the rest. Screams of pain and fear go
pulsing through the air at the rate of eleven hundred feet per
second. After travelling for three seconds they are perfectly
inaudible. These are distressing facts; but do we enjoy life any
the less because of them? Most certainly we do not. We feel sympathy,
no doubt; we represent to ourselves imaginatively the sufferings
of nations and individuals and we deplore them. But, after all,
what are sympathy and imagination? Precious little, unless the
person for whom we feel sympathy happens to be closely involved
in our affections; and even then they don’t go very far. And a
good thing too; for if one had an imagination vivid enough and
a sympathy sufficiently sensitive really to comprehend and to
feel the sufferings of other people, one would never have a moment’s
peace of mind. A really sympathetic race would not so much as
know the meaning of happiness. But luckily, as I’ve already said,
we aren’t a sympathetic race. At the beginning of the war I used
to think I really suffered, through imagination and sympathy,
with those who physically suffered. But after a month or two I
had to admit that, honestly, I didn’t. And yet I think I have
a more vivid imagination than most. One is always alone in suffering;
the fact is depressing when one happens to be the sufferer, but
it makes pleasure possible for the rest of the world."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Henry Wimbush pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps we ought to go and join the ladies," he said.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Ivor, jumping up with alacrity. He turned to
Mr. Scogan. "Fortunately," he said, "we can share our pleasures.
We are not always condemned to be happy alone."</p>
