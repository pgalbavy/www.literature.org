As the ruler of Ptarth, followed by his courtiers,
descended from the landing-stage above the palace,
the servants dropped into their places in the rear
of their royal or noble masters, and behind the others
one lingered to the last.  Then quickly stooping
he snatched the sandal from his right foot, slipping
it into his pocket-pouch.
<P>
When the party had come to the lower levels, and the
jeddak had dispersed them by a sign, none noticed that
the forward fellow who had drawn so much attention to
himself before the Prince of Helium departed, was no
longer among the other servants.
<P>
To whose retinue he had been attached none had thought
to inquire, for the followers of a Martian noble
are many, coming and going at the whim of their master,
so that a new face is scarcely ever questioned, as the
fact that a man has passed within the palace walls is
considered proof positive that his loyalty to the jeddak
is beyond question, so rigid is the examination of each
who seeks service with the nobles of the court.
<P>
A good rule that, and only relaxed by courtesy in favour of
the retinue of visiting royalty from a friendly foreign power.
<P>
It was late in the morning of the next day that a giant
serving man in the harness of the house of a great Ptarth
noble passed out into the city from the palace gates.
Along one broad avenue and then another he strode briskly
until he had passed beyond the district of the nobles and
had come to the place of shops.  Here he sought a pretentious
building that rose spire-like toward the heavens, its outer walls
elaborately wrought with delicate carvings and intricate mosaics.
<P>
It was the Palace of Peace in which were housed the
representatives of the foreign powers, or rather in
which were located their embassies; for the ministers
themselves dwelt in gorgeous palaces within the district
occupied by the nobles.
<P>
Here the man sought the embassy of Dusar.  A clerk
arose questioningly as he entered, and at his request
to have a word with the minister asked his credentials.
The visitor slipped a plain metal armlet from above his elbow,
and pointing to an inscription upon its inner surface,
whispered a word or two to the clerk.
<P>
The latter's eyes went wide, and his attitude turned at
once to one of deference.  He bowed the stranger to a seat,
and hastened to an inner room with the armlet in his hand.
A moment later he reappeared and conducted the caller into
the presence of the minister.
<P>
For a long time the two were closeted together, and when at
last the giant serving man emerged from the inner office his
expression was cast in a smile of sinister satisfaction.
From the Palace of Peace he hurried directly to the palace
of the Dusarian minister.
<P>
That night two swift fliers left the same palace top. 
One sped its rapid course toward Helium; the other--
<P>
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth strolled in the gardens of her father's palace,
as was her nightly custom before retiring.  Her silks and furs
were drawn about her, for the air of Mars is chill after the
sun has taken his quick plunge beneath the planet's western verge.
<P>
The girl's thoughts wandered from her impending nuptials, that would
make her empress of Kaol, to the person of the trim young Heliumite
who had laid his heart at her feet the preceding day.
<P>
Whether it was pity or regret that saddened her expression
as she gazed toward the southern heavens where she had
watched the lights of his flier disappear the previous night,
it would be difficult to say.
<P>
So, too, is it impossible to conjecture just what her
emotions may have been as she discerned the lights of
a flier speeding rapidly out of the distance from that
very direction, as though impelled toward her garden
by the very intensity of the princess' thoughts.
<P>
She saw it circle lower above the palace until she was
positive that it but hovered in preparation for a landing.
<P>
Presently the powerful rays of its searchlight shot downward
from the bow.  They fell upon the landing-stage for a brief
instant, revealing the figures of the Ptarthian guard,
picking into brilliant points of fire the gems upon their
gorgeous harnesses.
<P>
Then the blazing eye swept onward across the burnished
domes and graceful minarets, down into court and park
and garden to pause at last upon the ersite bench and
the girl standing there beside it, her face upturned full
toward the flier.
<P>
For but an instant the searchlight halted upon Thuvia
of Ptarth, then it was extinguished as suddenly as it had
come to life.  The flier passed on above her to disappear
beyond a grove of lofty skeel trees that grew within the
palace grounds.
<P>
The girl stood for some time as it had left her, except
that her head was bent and her eyes downcast in thought.
<P>
Who but Carthoris could it have been?  She tried to feel
anger that he should have returned thus, spying upon her;
but she found it difficult to be angry with the young
prince of Helium.
<P>
What mad caprice could have induced him so to transgress
the etiquette of nations?  For lesser things great powers
had gone to war.
<P>
The princess in her was shocked and angered--but what of the girl!
<P>
And the guard--what of them?  Evidently they, too,
had been so much surprised by the unprecedented action
of the stranger that they had not even challenged;
but that they had no thought to let the thing go unnoticed
was quickly evidenced by the skirring of motors upon
the landing-stage and the quick shooting airward of a
long-lined patrol boat.
<P>
Thuvia watched it dart swiftly eastward.  So, too,
did other eyes watch.
<P>
Within the dense shadows of the skeel grove, in a
wide avenue beneath o'erspreading foliage, a flier hung a
dozen feet above the ground.  From its deck keen eyes
watched the far-fanning searchlight of the patrol boat. 
No light shone from the enshadowed craft.  Upon its deck
was the silence of the tomb.  Its crew of a half-dozen red
warriors watched the lights of the patrol boat diminishing
in the distance.
<P>
"The intellects of our ancestors are with us to-night,"
said one in a low tone.
<P>
"No plan ever carried better," returned another.  "They
did precisely as the prince foretold."
<P>
He who had first spoken turned toward the man who
squatted before the control board.
<P>
"Now!" he whispered.  There was no other order given. 
Every man upon the craft had evidently been well schooled
in each detail of that night's work.  Silently the dark hull
crept beneath the cathedral arches of the dark and silent grove.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth, gazing toward the east, saw the blacker blot
against the blackness of the trees as the craft topped the
buttressed garden wall.  She saw the dim bulk incline gently
downward toward the scarlet sward of the garden.
<P>
She knew that men came not thus with honourable intent. 
Yet she did not cry aloud to alarm the near-by guardsmen,
nor did she flee to the safety of the palace.
<P>
Why?
<P>
I can see her shrug her shapely shoulders in reply as she
voices the age-old, universal answer of the woman:  Because!
<P>
Scarce had the flier touched the ground when four men
leaped from its deck.  They ran forward toward the girl.
<P>
Still she made no sign of alarm, standing as though hypnotized.
Or could it have been as one who awaited a welcome visitor?
<P>
Not until they were quite close to her did she move. 
Then the nearer moon, rising above the surrounding foliage,
touched their faces, lighting all with the brilliancy of her silver rays.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth saw only strangers--warriors in the
harness of Dusar.  Now she took fright, but too late!
<P>
Before she could voice but a single cry, rough hands
seized her.  A heavy silken scarf was wound about her
head.  She was lifted in strong arms and borne to the deck
of the flier.  There was the sudden whirl of propellers, the
rushing of air against her body, and, from far beneath the
shouting and the challenge from the guard.
<P>
Racing toward the south another flier sped toward Helium.
In its cabin a tall red man bent over the soft sole of an
upturned sandal.  With delicate instruments he measured
the faint imprint of a small object which appeared there.
Upon a pad beside him was the outline of a key,
and here he noted the results of his measurements.
<P>
A smile played upon his lips as he completed his task and
turned to one who waited at the opposite side of the table.
<P>
"The man is a genius," he remarked.
<P>
"Only a genius could have evolved such a lock as this
is designed to spring.  Here, take the sketch, Larok, and
give all thine own genius full and unfettered freedom
in reproducing it in metal."
<P>
The warrior-artificer bowed.  "Man builds naught,"
he said, "that man may not destroy."  Then he left the
cabin with the sketch.
<P>
As dawn broke upon the lofty towers which mark the twin cities
of Helium--the scarlet tower of one and the yellow tower of
its sister--a flier floated lazily out of the north.
<P>
Upon its bow was emblazoned the signia of a lesser noble
of a far city of the empire of Helium.  Its leisurely
approach and the evident confidence with which it moved
across the city aroused no suspicion in the minds of the
sleepy guard.  Their round of duty nearly done, they had little
thought beyond the coming of those who were to relieve them.
<P>
Peace reigned throughout Helium.  Stagnant, emasculating
peace.  Helium had no enemies.  There was naught to fear.
<P>
Without haste the nearest air patrol swung sluggishly
about and approached the stranger.  At easy speaking
distance the officer upon her deck hailed the incoming craft.
<P>
The cheery "Kaor!" and the plausible explanation that the
owner had come from distant parts for a few days of pleasure
in gay Helium sufficed.  The air-patrol boat sheered off,
passing again upon its way.  The stranger continued toward
a public landing-stage, where she dropped into the ways
and came to rest.
<P>
At about the same time a warrior entered her cabin.
<P>
"It is done, Vas Kor," he said, handing a small metal
key to the tall noble who had just risen from his sleeping
silks and furs.
<P>
"Good!" exclaimed the latter.  "You must have worked
upon it all during the night, Larok."
<P>
The warrior nodded.
<P>
"Now fetch me the Heliumetic metal you wrought some
days since," commanded Vas Kor.
<P>
This done, the warrior assisted his master to replace
the handsome jewelled metal of his harness with the
plainer ornaments of an ordinary fighting man of Helium,
and with the insignia of the same house that appeared
upon the bow of the flier.
<P>
Vas Kor breakfasted on board.  Then he emerged upon
the aerial dock, entered an elevator, and was borne quickly
to the street below, where he was soon engulfed by the early
morning throng of workers hastening to their daily duties.
<P>
Among them his warrior trappings were no more remarkable
than is a pair of trousers upon Broadway.  All Martian men
are warriors, save those physically unable to bear arms. 
The tradesman and his clerk clank with their martial
trappings as they pursue their vocations.  The schoolboy,
coming into the world, as he does, almost adult from the
snowy shell that has encompassed his development for five
long years, knows so little of life without a sword at his
hip that he would feel the same discomfiture at going abroad
unarmed that an Earth boy would experience in walking the
streets knicker-bockerless.
<P>
Vas Kor's destination lay in Greater Helium, which lies
some seventy-five miles across the level plain from Lesser
Helium.  He had landed at the latter city because the air
patrol is less suspicious and alert than that above the
larger metropolis where lies the palace of the jeddak.
<P>
As he moved with the throng in the parklike canyon of
the thoroughfare the life of an awakening Martian city
was in evidence about him.  Houses, raised high upon their
slender metal columns for the night were dropping gently
toward the ground.  Among the flowers upon the scarlet sward
which lies about the buildings children were already playing,
and comely women laughing and chatting with their neighbours as
they culled gorgeous blossoms for the vases within doors.
<P>
The pleasant "kaor" of the Barsoomian greeting fell
continually upon the ears of the stranger as friends and
neighbours took up the duties of a new day.
<P>
The district in which he had landed was residential--a
district of merchants of the more prosperous sort. 
Everywhere were evidences of luxury and wealth.
Slaves appeared upon every housetop with gorgeous silks
and costly furs, laying them in the sun for airing. 
Jewel-encrusted women lolled even thus early upon the carven
balconies before their sleeping apartments.  Later in the day
they would repair to the roofs when the slaves had arranged
couches and pitched silken canopies to shade them from the sun.
<P>
Strains of inspiring music broke pleasantly from open windows,
for the Martians have solved the problem of attuning the
nerves pleasantly to the sudden transition from sleep to
waking that proves so difficult a thing for most Earth folk.
<P>
Above him raced the long, light passenger fliers, plying,
each in its proper plane, between the numerous landing-
stages for internal passenger traffic.  Landing-stages that
tower high into the heavens are for the great international
passenger liners.  Freighters have other landing-stages at
various lower levels, to within a couple of hundred feet
of the ground; nor dare any flier rise or drop from one
plane to another except in certain restricted districts where
horizontal traffic is forbidden.
<P>
Along the close-cropped sward which paves the avenue ground
fliers were moving in continuous lines in opposite directions.
For the greater part they skimmed along the surface of the sward,
soaring gracefully into the air at times to pass over a
slower-going driver ahead, or at intersections, where the
north and south traffic has the right of way and the east
and west must rise above it.
<P>
From private hangars upon many a roof top fliers were
darting into the line of traffic.  Gay farewells and parting
admonitions mingled with the whirring of motors and
the subdued noises of the city.
<P>
Yet with all the swift movement and the countless
thousands rushing hither and thither, the predominant
suggestion was that of luxurious ease and soft noiselessness.
<P>
Martians dislike harsh, discordant clamour.  The only
loud noises they can abide are the martial sounds of war,
the clash of arms, the collision of two mighty dreadnoughts
of the air.  To them there is no sweeter music than this.
<P>
At the intersection of two broad avenues Vas Kor descended
from the street level to one of the great pneumatic
stations of the city.  Here he paid before a little wicket
the fare to his destination with a couple of the dull,
oval coins of Helium.
<P>
Beyond the gatekeeper he came to a slowly moving
line of what to Earthly eyes would have appeared to be
conical-nosed, eight-foot projectiles for some giant gun. 
In slow procession the things moved in single file along
a grooved track.  A half dozen attendants assisted passengers
to enter, or directed these carriers to their proper destination.
<P>
Vas Kor approached one that was empty.  Upon its nose was
a dial and a pointer.  He set the pointer for a certain
station in Greater Helium, raised the arched lid of
the thing, stepped in and lay down upon the upholstered
bottom.  An attendant closed the lid, which locked with a
little click, and the carrier continued its slow way.
<P>
Presently it switched itself automatically to another track,
to enter, a moment later, one of the series of dark- mouthed tubes.
<P>
The instant that its entire length was within the black
aperture it sprang forward with the speed of a rifle ball. 
There was an instant of whizzing--a soft, though sudden,
stop, and slowly the carrier emerged upon another platform,
another attendant raised the lid and Vas Kor stepped out at
the station beneath the centre of Greater Helium,
seventy-five miles from the point at which he had embarked.
<P>
Here he sought the street level, stepping immediately
into a waiting ground flier.  He spoke no word to the slave
sitting in the driver's seat.  It was evident that he had
been expected, and that the fellow had received his instructions
before his coming.
<P>
Scarcely had Vas Kor taken his seat when the flier
went quickly into the fast-moving procession, turning
presently from the broad and crowded avenue into a
less congested street.  Presently it left the thronged
district behind to enter a section of small shops, where it
stopped before the entrance to one which bore the sign
of a dealer in foreign silks.
<P>
Vas Kor entered the low-ceiling room.  A man at the
far end motioned him toward an inner apartment, giving
no further sign of recognition until he had passed in
after the caller and closed the door.
<P>
Then he faced his visitor, saluting deferentially.
<P>
"Most noble--" he commenced, but Vas Kor silenced
him with a gesture.
<P>
"No formalities," he said.  "We must forget that I
am aught other than your slave.  If all has been as
carefully carried out as it has been planned, we have no
time to waste.  Instead we should be upon our way to the
slave market.  Are you ready?"
<P>
The merchant nodded, and, turning to a great chest,
produced the unemblazoned trappings of a slave.  These
Vas Kor immediately donned.  Then the two passed from
the shop through a rear door, traversed a winding alley
to an avenue beyond, where they entered a flier which
awaited them.
<P>
Five minutes later the merchant was leading his slave
to the public market, where a great concourse of people
filled the great open space in the centre of which stood
the slave block.
<P>
The crowds were enormous to-day, for Carthoris,
Prince of Helium, was to be the principal bidder.
<P>
One by one the masters mounted the rostrum beside
the slave block upon which stood their chattels.
Briefly and clearly each recounted the virtues of
his particular offering.
<P>
When all were done, the major-domo of the Prince of Helium
recalled to the block such as had favourably impressed him.
For such he had made a fair offer.
<P>
There was little haggling as to price, and none at all
when Vas Kor was placed upon the block.  His merchant-
master accepted the first offer that was made for him, and
thus a Dusarian noble entered the household of Carthoris.
