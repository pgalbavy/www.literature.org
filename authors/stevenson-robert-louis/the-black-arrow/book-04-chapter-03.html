<p>Throughout this furious and rapid passage, Lawless had looked on
helplessly, and even when all was over, and Dick, already re-arisen to
his feet, was listening with the most passionate attention to the
distant bustle in the lower storeys of the house, the old outlaw was
still wavering on his legs like a shrub in a breeze of wind, and still
stupidly staring on the face of the dead man.
</p><p>"It is well," said Dick, at length; "they have not heard us, praise the
saints! But, now, what shall I do with this poor spy? At least, I will
take my tassel from his wallet."
</p><p>So saying, Dick opened the wallet; within he found a few pieces of
money, the tassel, and a letter addressed to Lord Wensleydale, and
sealed with my Lord Shoreby's seal. The name awoke Dick's recollection;
and he instantly broke the wax and read the contents of the letter. It
was short, but, to Dick's delight, it gave evident proof that Lord
Shoreby was treacherously corresponding with the House of York.
</p><p>The young fellow usually carried his ink-horn and implements about him,
and so now, bending a knee beside the body of the dead spy, he was able
to write these words upon a corner of the paper:
</p><pre>
     My Lord of Shoreby, ye that writt the letter, wot ye why your man
     is ded? But let me rede you, marry not.
                                                        JON AMEND-ALL.</pre>
<p>He laid this paper on the breast of the corpse; and then Lawless, who
had been looking on upon these last manoeuvres with some flickering
returns of intelligence, suddenly drew a black arrow from below his
robe, and therewith pinned the paper in its place. The sight of this
disrespect, or, as it almost seemed, cruelty to the dead, drew a cry of
horror from young Shelton; but the old outlaw only laughed.
</p><p>"Nay, I will have the credit for mine order," he hiccupped. "My jolly
boys must have the credit on't--the credit, brother"; and then, shutting
his eyes tight and opening his mouth like a precentor, he began to
thunder, in a formidable voice:
</p><p>    "If ye should drink the clary wine"--
</p><p>"Peace, sot!" cried Dick, and thrust him hard against the wall. "In two
words--if so be that such a man can understand me who hath more wine
than wit in him--in two words, and, a-Mary's name, begone out of this
house, where, if ye continue to abide, ye will not only hang yourself,
but me also! Faith, then, up foot! be yare, or, by the mass, I may
forget that I am in some sort your captain and in some your debtor! Go!"
</p><p>The sham monk was now, in some degree, recovering the use of his
intelligence; and the ring in Dick's voice, and the glitter in Dick's
eye, stamped home the meaning of his words.
</p><p>"By the mass," cried Lawless, "an I be not wanted, I can go"; and he
turned tipsily along the corridor and proceeded to flounder down-stairs,
lurching against the wall.
</p><p>So soon as he was out of sight, Dick returned to his hiding-place,
resolutely fixed to see the matter out. Wisdom, indeed, moved him to be
gone; but love and curiosity were stronger.
</p><p>Time passed slowly for the young man, bolt upright behind the arras. The
fire in the room began to die down, and the lamp to burn low and to
smoke. And still there was no word of the return of any one to these
upper quarters of the house; still the faint hum and clatter of the
supper party sounded from far below; and still, under the thick fall of
the snow, Shoreby town lay silent upon every side.
</p><p>At length, however, feet and voices began to draw near upon the stair;
and presently after several of Sir Daniel's guests arrived upon the
landing, and, turning down the corridor, beheld the torn arras and the
body of the spy.
</p><p>Some ran forward and some back, and all together began to cry aloud.
</p><p>At the sound of their cries, guests, men-at-arms, ladies, servants, and,
in a word, all the inhabitants of that great house, came flying from
every direction, and began to join their voices to the tumult.
</p><p>Soon a way was cleared, and Sir Daniel came forth in person, followed by
the bridegroom of the morrow, my Lord Shoreby.
</p><p>"My lord," said Sir Daniel, "have I not told you of this knave Black
Arrow? To the proof, behold it! There it stands, and, by the rood, my
gossip, in a man of yours, or one that stole your colours!"
</p><p>"In good sooth, it was a man of mine," replied Lord Shoreby, hanging
back. "I would I had more such. He was keen as a beagle and secret as a
mole."
</p><p>"Ay, gossip, truly?" asked Sir Daniel, keenly. "And what came he
smelling up so many stairs in my poor mansion? But he will smell no
more."
</p><p>"An't please you, Sir Daniel," said one, "here is a paper written upon
with some matter, pinned upon his breast."
</p><p>"Give it me, arrow and all," said the knight. And when he had taken into
his hand the shaft, he continued for some time to gaze upon it in a
sullen musing. "Ay," he said, addressing Lord Shoreby, "here is a hate
that followeth hard and close upon my heels. This black stick, or its
just likeness, shall yet bring me down. And, gossip, suffer a plain
knight to counsel you; and if these hounds begin to wind you, flee! 'Tis
like a sickness--it still hangeth, hangeth upon the limbs. But let us
see what they have written. It is as I thought, my lord; y'are marked,
like an old oak, by the woodman; to-morrow or next day, by will come the
axe. But what wrote ye in a letter?"
</p><p>Lord Shoreby snatched the paper from the arrow, read it, crumpled it
between his hands, and overcoming the reluctance which had hitherto
withheld him from approaching, threw himself on his knees beside the
body and eagerly groped in the wallet.
</p><p>He rose to his feet with a somewhat unsettled countenance.
</p><p>"Gossip," he said, "I have indeed lost a letter here that much imported;
and could I lay my hand upon the knave that took it, he should
incontinently grace a halter. But let us, first of all, secure the
issues of the house. Here is enough harm already, by St. George!"
</p><p>Sentinels were posted close around the house and garden; a sentinel on
every landing of the stair, a whole troop in the main entrance-hall; and
yet another about the bonfire in the shed. Sir Daniel's followers were
supplemented by Lord Shoreby's; there was thus no lack of men or weapons
to make the house secure, or to entrap a lurking enemy, should one be
there.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the body of the spy was carried out through the falling snow
and deposited in the abbey church.
</p><p>It was not until these dispositions had been taken, and all had returned
to a decorous silence, that the two girls drew Richard Shelton from his
place of concealment, and made a full report to him of what had passed.
He, upon his side, recounted the visit of the spy, his dangerous
discovery, and speedy end.
</p><p>Joanna leaned back very faint against the curtained wall.
</p><p>"It will avail but little," she said. "I shall be wed to-morrow, in the
morning, after all!"
</p><p>"What!" cried her friend. "And here is our paladin that driveth lions
like mice! Ye have little faith, of a surety. But come, friend
lion-driver, give us some comfort; speak, and let us hear bold
counsels."
</p><p>Dick was confounded to be thus outfaced with his own exaggerated words;
but though he coloured, he still spoke stoutly.
</p><p>"Truly," said he, "we are in straits. Yet, could I but win out of this
house for half an hour, I do honestly tell myself that all might still
go well; and for the marriage, it should be prevented."
</p><p>"And for the lions," mimicked the girl, "they shall be driven."
</p><p>"I crave your excuse," said Dick. "I speak not now in any boasting
humour, but rather as one inquiring after help or counsel; for if I get
not forth of this house and through these sentinels, I can do less than
naught. Take me, I pray you, rightly."
</p><p>"Why said ye he was rustic, Joan?" the girl inquired. "I warrant he hath
a tongue in his head; ready, soft, and bold is his speech at pleasure.
What would ye more?"
</p><p>"Nay," sighed Joanna, with a smile, "they have changed me my friend
Dick, 'tis sure enough. When I beheld him, he was rough indeed. But it
matters little; there is no help for my hard case, and I must still be
Lady Shoreby!"
</p><p>"Nay, then," said Dick, "I will even make the adventure. A friar is not
much regarded; and if I found a good fairy to lead me up, I may find
another belike to carry me down. How call they the name of this spy?"
</p><p>"Rutter," said the young lady; "and an excellent good name to call him
by. But how mean ye, lion-driver? What is in your mind to do?"
</p><p>"To offer boldly to go forth," returned Dick; "and if any stop me, to
keep an unchanged countenance, and say I go to pray for Rutter. They
will be praying over his poor clay even now."
</p><p>"The device is somewhat simple," replied the girl, "yet it may hold."
</p><p>"Nay," said young Shelton, "it is no device, but mere boldness, which
serveth often better in great straits."
</p><p>"Ye say true," she said. "Well, go, a-Mary's name, and may Heaven speed
you! Ye leave here a poor maid that loves you entirely, and another that
is most heartily your friend. Be wary, for their sakes, and make not
shipwreck of your safety."
</p><p>"Ay," added Joanna, "go, Dick. Ye run no more peril, whether ye go or
stay. Go; ye take my heart with you; the saints defend you!"
</p><p>Dick passed the first sentry with so assured a countenance that the
fellow merely fidgeted and stared; but at the second landing the man
carried his spear across and bade him name his business.
</p><p>"_Pax vobiscum,_" answered Dick. "I go to pray over the body of this
poor Rutter."
</p><p>"Like enough," returned the sentry; "but to go alone is not permitted
you." He leaned over the oaken balusters and whistled shrill. "One
cometh!" he cried; and then motioned Dick to pass.
</p><p>At the foot of the stair he found the guard afoot and awaiting his
arrival; and when he had once more repeated his story, the commander of
the post ordered four men out to accompany him to the church.
</p><p>"Let him not slip, my lads," he said. "Bring him to Sir Oliver, on your
lives!"
</p><p>The door was then opened; one of the men took Dick by either arm,
another marched ahead with a link, and the fourth, with bent bow and the
arrow on the string, brought up the rear. In this order they proceeded
through the garden, under the thick darkness of the night and the
scattering snow, and drew near to the dimly illuminated windows of the
abbey church.
</p><p>At the western portal a picket of archers stood, taking what shelter
they could find in the hollow of the arched doorways, and all powdered
with the snow; and it was not until Dick's conductors had exchanged a
word with these, that they were suffered to pass forth and enter the
nave of the sacred edifice.
</p><p>The church was doubtfully lighted by the tapers upon the great altar,
and by a lamp or two that swung from the arched roof before the private
chapels of illustrious families. In the midst of the choir the dead spy
lay, his limbs piously composed, upon a bier.
</p><p>A hurried mutter of prayer sounded along the arches; cowled figures
knelt in the stalls of the choir, and on the steps of the high altar a
priest in pontifical vestments celebrated mass.
</p><p>Upon this fresh entrance, one of the cowled figures arose, and, coming
down the steps which elevated the level of the choir above that of the
nave, demanded from the leader of the four men what business brought him
to the church. Out of respect for the service and the dead, they spoke
in guarded tones; but the echoes of that huge, empty building caught up
their words, and hollowly repeated and repeated them along the aisles.
</p><p>"A monk!" returned Sir Oliver (for he it was), when he had heard the
report of the archer. "My brother, I looked not for your coming," he
added, turning to young Shelton. "In all civility, who are ye? and at
whose instance do ye join your supplications to ours?"
</p><p>Dick, keeping his cowl about his face, signed to Sir Oliver to move a
pace or two aside from the archers; and, so soon as the priest had done
so, "I cannot hope to deceive you, sir," he said. "My life is in your
hands."
</p><p>Sir Oliver violently started; his stout cheeks grew pale, and for a
space he was silent.
</p><p>"Richard," he said, "what brings you here, I know not; but I much
misdoubt it to be evil. Nevertheless, for the kindness that was, I would
not willingly deliver you to harm. Ye shall sit all night beside me in
the stalls: ye shall sit there till my Lord of Shoreby be married, and
the party gone safe home; and if all goeth well, and ye have planned no
evil, in the end ye shall go whither ye will. But if your purpose be
bloody, it shall return upon your head. Amen!"
</p><p>And the priest devoutly crossed himself, and turned and louted to the
altar.
</p><p>With that, he spoke a few words more to the soldiers, and taking Dick by
the hand, led him up to the choir, and placed him in the stall beside
his own, where, for mere decency, the lad had instantly to kneel and
appear to be busy with his devotions.
</p><p>His mind and his eyes, however, were continually wandering. Three of the
soldiers, he observed, instead of returning to the house, had got them
quietly into a point of vantage in the aisle; and he could not doubt
that they had done so by Sir Oliver's command. Here, then, he was
trapped. Here he must spend the night in the ghostly glimmer and shadow
of the church, and looking on the pale face of him he slew; and here, in
the morning, he must see his sweetheart married to another man before
his eyes.
</p><p>But, for all that, he obtained a command upon his mind, and built
himself up in patience to await the issue.
