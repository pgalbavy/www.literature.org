<p>Now August came, that florid lazy month when mid-summer dawdles
along in trailing greeneries, and the day is like some jocund
pagan, all flushed and asleep, with dripping beard rosy in a wine
bowl of fat vine leaves. Yet, in this languorous time there may
befall a brisker night, cool and lively as an intrusive boy&mdash;a
night made for dancing. On such a night a hasty thought might
put it as desirable that all the world should be twenty-two years
old and in love, like Noble Dill.</p>

<p>Upon the white bed in his room, as he dressed, lay the flat black
silhouettes of his short evening coat and trousers, side by side,
trim from new pressing; and whenever he looked at them Noble felt
rich, tall, distinguished, and dramatic. It is a mistake, as most
literary legends are mistakes, to assume that girls are the only
people subject to before-the-party exhilaration. At such times
a girl is often in the anxious yet determined mood of a runner
before a foot race, or she may be merely hopeful; some are merry
and some are grim, but arithmetical calculation of some sort,
whether glorious or uneasy, is busy in their eyes as they pin
and pat before their mirrors. To behold romance gone light-headed,
turn to the humbler sort of man-creature under twenty-three. Alone
in his room, he may enact for you scenes of flowery grace and
most capricious gallantry, rehearsals as unconscious as the curtsies
of field daisies in a breeze. He has neither doubt nor certainty
of his charm; he has no arithmetic at all, and is often so free
of calculation that he does not even pull down the shades at his
windows.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the neighbours, and even for passers-by, since
Noble's room had a window visible from the street, his prophetic
mother had closed his shutters before he began to dress. Thus
she deprived honest folk of what surely must have been to them
the innocent pleasure of seeing a very young man in light but
complete underwear, lifting from his head a Panama hat, new that
day, in a series of courteous salutations. At times, during this
same stage of his toilet, they might have had even more entertainment:&mdash;before
putting on his socks Noble "one-stepped" for several minutes,
still retaining upon his head the new hat. This was a hat of double
value to him; not only was it pleasant to behold in his mirror,
but it was engaged in solidifying for the evening the arrangement
of his hair.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that he was a little giddy, for the dance
was Julia's. Mr. Atwater had been summoned to New York on a blessed
business that would keep him a fortnight, and his daughter, alert
to the first flash of opportunity, had almost instantly summoned
musicians, florists, a caterer, and set plans before them. Coincidentally,
Noble had chanced to see Mr. Atwater driving down Julia's Street
that morning, a travelling bag beside him, and, immediately putting
aside for the day all business cares, hurried to the traveller's
house. Thus he forestalled, for the time being, that competition
which helped to make caring for Julia so continuous a strain upon
whatever organ is the seat of the anxieties. Kind Julia, busy
as she was, agreed to dance the first dance with him, and the
last&mdash;those being considered of such significance that he would
be entitled to the perquisites of a special cavalier; for instance,
a seat beside her during the serving of the customary light repast.
In such high fortune, no wonder he was a little giddy as he dressed!</p>

<p>The process of clothing himself was disconnected, being broken
by various enacted fancies and interludes. Having approached the
length of one sock toward the completion of his toilet, he absently
dropped the other upon the floor, and danced again; his expression
and attitude signifying that he clasped a revered partner. Releasing
her from this respectful confinement, he offered the invisible
lady a gracious arm and walked up and down the room with a stateliness
tempered to rhythm, a cakewalk of strange refinement. Phrases
seemed to be running in his head, impromptus symbolic of the touching
and romantic, for he spoke them half aloud hi a wistful yet uplifted
manner. "Oh, years!" he said. "Oh, years so fair; oh, night so
rare!" Then he added, in a deeper voice:</p>

<p>"For life is but a golden dream so sweetly."</p>

<p>Other whimsies came forth from him as the dressing slowly continued,
though one might easily be at fault in attempting to fathom what
was his thought when, during the passage of his right foot through
the corresponding leg of his trousers, he exclaimed commandingly:</p>

<p>"Now, Jocko, for the stirrup cup!"</p>

<p>Jack boots and a faithful squire, probably.</p>

<p>During the long and dreamy session with his neck gear he went
back to the softer <em>motif</em>:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, years so fair; oh, night so rare!<br/>
For life is but a golden dream so sweetly."

</p>
</div>
<p>Then, pausing abruptly to look at his coat, so smoothly folded
upon the bed, he addressed it: "O noblest sample of the tailor's
dext'rous art!"</p>

<p>This was too much courtesy, for the coat was "ready-made," and
looked nobler upon the bed than upon its owner. In fact, it was
by no means a dext'rous sample; but evidently Noble believed in
it with a high and satisfying faith; and he repeated his compliment
to it as he put it on:</p>

<p>"Come, noblest sample of the tailor's art; I'll don thee!"</p>

<p>During these processes he had been repeatedly summoned to descend
to the family dinner, and finally his mother came lamenting and
called up from the front hall that "everything" was "all getting
cold!"</p>

<p>But by this time he was on his way, and though he went back to
leave his hat in his room, unwilling to confide it to the hat-rack
below, he presently made his appearance in the dining-room and
took his seat at the table. This mere sitting, however, appeared
to be his whole conception of dining; he seemed as unaware of
his mother's urging food upon him as if he had been a Noble Dill
of waxwork. Several tunes he lifted a fork and set it down without
guiding it to its accustomed destination. Food was far from his
thoughts or desires, and if he really perceived its presence at
all, it appeared to him as something vaguely ignoble upon the
horizon.</p>

<p>But he was able to partake of coffee; drank two cups feverishly,
his hand visibly unsteady; and when his mother pointed out this
confirmation of many prophecies that cigarettes would ruin him,
he asked if anybody had noticed whether or not it was cloudy outdoors.
At that his father looked despondent, for the open windows of
the dining-room revealed an evening of fragrant clarity.</p>

<p>"I see, I see," Noble returned pettishly when the fine state
of this closely adjacent weather was pointed out to him by his
old-maid sister. "It wouldn't be raining, of course. Not on a
night like this." He jumped up. "It's time for me to go."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dill laughed. "It's only a little after seven. Julia won't
be through her own dinner yet. You mustn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>But with a tremulous smile, Noble shook his head and hurriedly
left the room. He went upstairs for his hat, and while there pinned
a geranium blossom upon his lapel, for it may be admitted that
in boutonni√®res his taste was as yet unformed.</p>

<p>Coming down again, he took a stick under his arm and was about
to set forth when he noticed a little drift of talcum powder upon
one of his patent leather shoes. After carefully removing this
accretion and adding a brighter lustre to the shoe by means of
friction against the back of his ankle, he decided to return to
his room and brush the affected portion of his trousers. Here
a new reverie arrested him; he stood with the brush in his hand
for some time; then, not having used it, he dropped it gently
upon the bed, lit an Orduma cigarette, descended, and went forth
to the quiet street.</p>

<p>As he walked along Julia's Street toward Julia's Party, there
was something in his mien and look more dramatic than mere sprightliness;
and when he came within sight of the ineffable house and saw its
many lights shining before him, he breathed with profundity, half
halting. Again he murmured:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, years so fair; oh, night so rare!<br/>
For life is but a golden dream so sweetly."

</p>
</div>
<p>At the gate he hesitated. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps he was a little early.
It might be better to walk round the block.</p>

<p>He executed this parade, and again hesitated at the gate. He
could see into the brightly lighted hall, beyond the open double
doors; and it contained nothing except its usual furniture. Once
more he walked round the block. The hall was again in the same
condition. Again he went on.</p>

<p>When he had been thrice round the block after that, he discovered
human beings in the hall; they were Florence, in a gala costume,
and Florence's mother, evidently arrived to be assistants at the
party, for, with the helpful advice of a coloured manservant,
they were arranging some bunches of flowers on two hall tables.
Their leisurely manner somewhat emphasized the air of earliness
that hung about the place, and Noble thought it better to continue
to walk round the block. The third time after that, when he completed
his circuit, the musicians were just arriving, and their silhouettes,
headed by that of the burdened bass fiddler, staggered against
the light of the glowing doorway like a fantasia of giant beetles.
Noble felt that it would be better to let them get settled, and
therefore walked round the block again.</p>

<p>Not far from the corner above Julia's, as he passed, a hoarse
and unctuous voice, issuing out of an undistinguishable lawn,
called his name: "Noble! Noble Dill!" And when Noble paused, Julia's
Uncle Joseph came waddling forth from the dimness and rested his
monstrous arms upon the top of the fence, where a street light
revealed them as shirt-sleeved and equipped with a palm-leaf fan.</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter, Noble?" Mr. Atwater inquired earnestly.</p>

<p>"Matter?" Noble repeated. "Matter?"</p>

<p>"We're kind of upset," said Mr. Atwater. "My wife and I been
just sittin' out here in our front yard, not doing any harm to
anybody, and here it's nine times we've counted you passing the
place&mdash;always going the same way!" He spoke as with complaint,
a man with a grievance. "It's kind of ghostlike," he added. "We'd
give a good deal to know what <em>you</em> make of it."</p>

<p>Noble was nonplussed. "Why&#11834;" he said. "Why&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How do you get <em>back</em>? That's the mystery!" said Mr.
Atwater. "You're always walkin' down street and never up. You
know my wife's never been too strong a woman, Noble, and all this
isn't doing her any good. Besides, we sort of figured out that
you ought really to be at Julia's dance this evening."</p>

<p>"I am," said Noble nervously. "I mean that's where I'm going.
I'm going there. I'm going there."</p>

<p>"That's what's upsetting us so!" the fat man exclaimed. "You
keep on going there! Just when we've decided you must <em>be</em>
there, at last, here you come, going there again. Well, don't
let me detain you. But if you do decide to go in, some time, Noble,
I'm afraid you aren't going to be able to do much dancing."</p>

<p>Noble, who had begun to walk on, halted in sudden panic. Did
this sinister fear of Mr. Atwater's mean that, as an uncle, he
had heard Julia was suddenly ill?</p>

<p>"Why won't I?" he asked quickly. "Is anything&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Your poor feet!" said Mr. Atwater, withdrawing. "Good-night,
Noble."</p>

<p>The youth went on, somewhat disturbed; it seemed to him that
this uncle, though Julia's, was either going queer in the head
or had chosen a poor occasion to be facetious. Next time, probably,
it would be better to walk round the block below this. But it
was no longer advisable to walk round any block. When he came
to the happy gateway, the tuning of instruments and a fanfare
of voices sounded from within the house; girls in light wraps
were fluttering through the hall with young men; it was "time
for the party!" And Noble went in.</p>

<p>Throughout the accomplishment of the entrance he made, his outside
and his inside were directly contradictory. His inside was almost
fluttering: there might have been a nest of nervous young birds
in his chest; but as he went upstairs to the "gentlemen's dressing-room,"
to leave his hat and stick, this flopping and scrambling within
him was never to be guessed from his outside. His outside was
unsympathetic, even stately; he greeted his fellow guests with
negligent hauteur, while his glance seemed to say: "Only peasantry
here!"</p>
