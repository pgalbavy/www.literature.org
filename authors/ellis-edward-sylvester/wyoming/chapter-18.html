<p>The crack of Richard Brainerd's rifle and the death-shriek of
the Seneca Indian were almost simultaneous, but the redskin was
only a slight way in advance of the other savages, who, understanding
the meaning of the report and outcry, dashed forward.</p>

<p>The startling episode caused some bewilderment on the part of
the other fugitives, seeing which, the eldest called out to them
impatiently:</p>

<p>"Push on, there! Push on! the Indians are right on us."</p>

<p>Providentially, the advance were so close to the refuge that
Gravity Gimp caught sight of the spot, and without looking around,
he swung his hand over his head and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here we am! Here we am!"</p>

<p>"And that's the trouble," growled Habakkuk McEwen, crowding hard
after him, "if we were only somewhere else, we'd feel a good deal
better&mdash;leastways I would."</p>

<p>Another whoop was heard, then others at the rear, and those who
glanced back caught sight of several warriors flitting among the
trees and within the toss of a stone of them.</p>

<p>Brainerd would have fired again had it been in his power, but
his gun was unloaded and it was impossible to ram a charge home,
and pour the powder in the pan, without coming to a standstill
for a minute or two, and such hesitation would be death.</p>

<p>Had the place of refuge toward which they were hastening been
a dozen rods farther, not one of the fugitives would have reached
it alive, but, at the critical moment, Gimp, the African, told
the joyous news that it was at hand, and a general scramble followed.</p>

<p>The servant paused at the head of the elevated path, and turning
around, beckoned excitedly for the others to hurry, when they
were already doing their utmost, while he danced about and waited
the few seconds necessary for them to reach him.</p>

<p>While he was doing so, Habakkuk McEwen suddenly vanished from
sight, evidently concluding that the "time for disappearing" had
come.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of the refuge, and with one bound he went
down the declivity and was first to enter.</p>

<p>He took a sweeping glance of the interior, and was disappointed,
for it was not what he expected, but it was far better than the
open wilderness. He dashed for the narrow path on the outside,
to take his part in yelling for the others to hurry up, or rather
down.</p>

<p>"Be quick! Quick!"</p>

<p>It was Aunt Peggy who came panting into the opening with a rush,
and, colliding with McEwen, sent him tumbling backwards.</p>

<p>By the time the bewildered New Englander was on his feet again,
Maggie Brainerd, Eva, her father, and Gravity Gimp came crowding
into the narrow place, all nearly out of breath.</p>

<p>There was a general looking around in the semi-gloom, and Habakkuk's
disappointment was shared by those who had not seen the place
before.</p>

<p>It was of little account, and, although it might be made to answer
as a temporary refuge, it could hardly be expected to furnish
secure defense for an extended time.</p>

<p>Descending a narrow path for twenty feet, and all the time along
the face of the ravine, as it may be called, they reached a spot
which looked as if it had been scooped out of the solid stone
wall.</p>

<p>It ran back a dozen feet or more, and was about the same breadth
and height, but the difficulty was that the opening was fully
as great, so that, viewed from the front, the person or animal
who might seek shelter there was in plain sight.</p>

<p>The spot was one of the many romantic ones that abound in the
mountains fringing the Wyoming Valley. The rapidly sloping path
that the fugitives followed terminated in front of the cave, which,
therefore, could only be approached from the single direction.
Beyond, the path narrowed off to nothing, leaving a perpendicular
wall of stone for twenty feet below, and almost as much overhead.</p>

<p>The ravine on which this bordered was fifty feet across, but
directly opposite was the weak point of the defense.</p>

<p>A mass of rocks rose fully as high, if not a few feet higher,
than the cavern in which the fugitives had taken refuge; consequently,
if an enemy could gain a position behind these boulders, he could
fire down into the opening, where our friends had no means of
protecting themselves from the shots.</p>

<p>But it was no easy matter to reach this monument-like pile, though
it could be done at much risk to the one attempting it. The configuration
was so peculiar that one man at a time could creep along behind
the other stones, until a point was almost reached which commanded
the retreat, though the inmates, by pressing close against one
side of the cavern, could escape the fire of an enemy.</p>

<p>On the other side there was no means of approach to such a position.</p>

<p>If a foe would climb up the rocks, and steal forward to a certain
point, an active Indian could make a leap that would carry him
to the cover of the pile, where he could aim and shoot into the
cavern without risk to himself, provided he used ordinary caution.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was unlikely that the Indians, skilled as they
were in woodcraft, would fail to see this vulnerable point and
their own coigne of vantage.</p>

<p>In truth they detected it almost on the same instant the fugitives
hurried into the cavern.</p>
