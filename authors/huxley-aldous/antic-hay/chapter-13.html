<p>In spite of the taxi, in spite of the gobbled dinner, they were
late. The concert had begun.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Gumbril. "We shall get in in time for the
minuetto. It’s then that the fun really begins."</p>

<p>"Sour grapes," said Emily, putting her ear to the door. "It sounds
to me simply too lovely."</p>

<p>They stood outside, like beggars waiting abjectly at the doors
of a banqueting-hall—stood and listened to the snatches of music
that came out tantalizingly from within. A rattle of clapping
announced at last that the first movement was over; the doors
were thrown open. Hungrily they rushed in. The Sclopis Quartet
and a subsidiary viola were bowing from the platform. There was
a chirrup of tuning, then preliminary silence. Sclopis nodded
and moved his bow. The minuetto of Mozart’s G minor Quintet broke
out, phrase after phrase, short and decisive, with every now and
then a violent sforzando chord, startling in its harsh and sudden
emphasis.</p>

<p>Minuetto—all civilization, Mr. Mercaptan would have said, was
implied in the delicious word, the delicate, pretty thing. Ladies
and precious gentlemen, fresh from the wit and gallantry of Crebillon-haunted
sofas, stepping gracefully to a pattern of airy notes. To this
passion of one who cries out, to this obscure and angry argument
with fate how would they, Gumbril wondered, how would they have
tripped it?</p>

<p>How pure the passion, how unaffected, clear and without clot
or pretension the unhappiness of that slow movement which followed!
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Pure and
unsullied; pure and unmixed, unadulterated. "Not passionate, thank
God; only sensual and sentimental." In the name of earwig. Amen.
Pure, pure. Worshippers have tried to rape the statues of the
gods; the statuaries who made the images were generally to blame.
And how deliciously, too, an artist can suffer! and, in the face
of the whole Albert Hall, with what an effective gesture and grimace!
But blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. The
instruments come together and part again. Long silver threads
hang aerially over a murmur of waters; in the midst of muffled
sobbing a cry. The fountains blow their architecture of slender
pillars, and from basin to basin the waters fall; from basin to
basin, and every fall makes somehow possible a higher leaping
of the jet, and at the last fall the mounting column springs up
into the sunlight, and from water the music has modulated up into
a rainbow. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God;
they shall make God visible, too, to other eyes.</p>

<p>Blood beats in the ears. Beat, beat, beat. A slow drum in the
darkness, beating in the ears of one who lies wakeful with fever,
with the sickness of too much misery. It beats unceasingly, in
the ears, in the mind itself. Body and mind are indivisible, and
in the spirit blood painfully throbs. Sad thoughts droop through
the mind. A small, pure light comes swaying down through the darkness,
comes to rest, resigning itself to the obscurity of its misfortune.
There is resignation, but blood still beats in the ears. Blood
still painfully beats, though the mind has acquiesced. And then,
suddenly, the mind exerts itself, throws off the fever of too
much suffering and laughing, commands the body to dance. The introduction
to the last movement comes to its suspended, throbbing close.
There is an instant of expectation, and then, with a series of
mounting trochees and a downward hurrying, step after tiny step,
in triple time, the dance begins. Irrelevant, irreverent, out
of key with all that has gone before. But man’s greatest strength
lies in his capacity for irrelevance. In the midst of pestilences,
wars and famines, he builds cathedrals; and a slave, he can think
the irrelevant and unsuitable thoughts of a free man. The spirit
is slave to fever and beating blood, at the mercy of an obscure
and tyrannous misfortune. But irrelevantly, it elects to dance
in triple measure—a mounting skip, a patter of descending feet.</p>

<p>The G minor Quintet is at an end; the applause rattles out loudly.
Enthusiasts stand up and cry bravo. And the five men on the platform
rise and bow their acknowledgments. Great Sclopis himself receives
his share of the plaudits with a weary condescension; weary are
his poached eyes, weary his disillusioned smile. It is only his
due, he knows; but he has had so much clapping, so many lovely
women. He has a Roman nose, a colossal brow and, though the tawny
musical mane does much to conceal the fact, no back to his head.
Garofalo, the second fiddle, is black, beady-eyed and pot-bellied.
The convex reflections of the electroliers slide back and forth
over his polished bald head, as he bends, again, again, in little
military salutes. Peperkoek, two metres high, bows with a sinuous
politeness. His face, his hair are all of the same greyish buff
colour; he does not smile, his appearance is monolithic and grim.
Not so exuberant Knoedler, who sweats and smiles and embraces
his ’cello send lays his hand to his heart and bows almost to
the ground as though all this hullabaloo were directed only at
him. As for poor little Mr. Jenkins, the subsidiary viola, he
has slid away into the background, and feeling that this is really
the Sclopis’s show and that he, a mere intruder, has no right
to any of these demonstrations, he hardly bows at all, but only
smiles, vaguely and nervously, and from time to time makes a little
spasmodic twitch to show that he isn’t really ungrateful or haughty,
as you might think, but that he feels in the circumstances—the
position is a little embarrassing—it is hard to explain....</p>

<p>"Strange," said Gumbril, "to think that those ridiculous creatures
could have produced what we’ve just been hearing."</p>

<p>The poached eye of Sclopis lighted on Emily, flushed and ardently
applauding. He gave her, all to herself, a weary smile. He would
have a letter, he guessed, to-morrow morning signed ‘Your little
Admirer in the Third Row.’ She looked a choice little piece. He
smiled again to encourage her. Emily, alas! had not even noticed.
She was applauding the music.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy it?" he asked, as they stepped out into a deserted
Bond Street.</p>

<p>"Did <em>I...?" </em>Emily laughed expressively. "No, I didn’t
enjoy," she said. "Enjoy isn’t the word. You enjoy eating ices.
It made me happy. It’s unhappy music, but it made me happy."</p>

<p>Gumbril hailed a cab and gave the address of his rooms in Great
Russell Street. "Happy," he repeated, as they sat there side by
side in the darkness. He, too, was happy.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To my rooms," said Gumbril, "we shall be quiet there." He was
afraid she might object to going there—after yesterday. But she
made no comment.</p>

<p>"Some people think that it’s only possible to be happy if one
makes a noise," she said, after a pause. "I find it’s too delicate
and melancholy for noise. Being happy is rather melancholy—like
the most beautiful landscape, like those trees and the grass and
the clouds and the sunshine to-day."</p>

<p>"From the outside," said Gumbril, "it even looks rather dull."
They stumbled up the dark staircase to his rooms. Gumbril lit
a pair of candles and put the kettle on the gas ring. They sat
together on the divan sipping tea. In the rich, soft light of
the candles she looked different, more beautiful. The silk of
her dress seemed wonderfully rich and glossy, like the petals
of a tulip, and on her face, on her bare arms and neck the light
seemed to spread an impalpable bright bloom. On the wall behind
them, their shadows ran up towards the ceiling, enormous and profoundly
black.</p>

<p>"How unreal it is," Gumbril whispered. "Not true. This remote
secret room. These lights and shadows out of another time. And
you out of nowhere and I, out of a past utterly remote from yours,
sitting together here, together—and being happy. That’s the strangest
thing of all. Being quite senselessly happy. It’s unreal, unreal."</p>

<p>"But why," said Emily, "why? It’s here and happening now. It
<em>is</em> real."</p>

<p>"It all might vanish, at any moment," he said.</p>

<p>Emily smiled rather sadly. "It’ll vanish in due time," she said.
"Quite naturally, not by magic; it’ll vanish the way everything
else vanishes and changes. But it’s here now."</p>

<p>They gave themselves up to the enchantment. The candles burned,
two shining eyes of flame, without a wink, minute after minute.
But for them there were no longer any minutes. Emily leaned against
him, her body held in the crook of his arm, her head resting on
his shoulder. He caressed his cheek against her hair; sometimes,
very gently, he kissed her forehead or her closed eyes.</p>

<p>"If I had known you years ago ..." she sighed. "But I was a silly
little idiot then. I shouldn’t have noticed any difference between
you and anybody else."</p>

<p>"I shall be very jealous," Emily spoke again after another timeless
silence. "There must never be anybody else, never the shadow of
anybody else."</p>

<p>"There never will be anybody else," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>Emily smiled and opened her eyes, looked up at him. "Ah, not
here," she said, "not in this real unreal room. Not during this
eternity. But there will be other rooms just as real as this."</p>

<p>"Not so real, not so real." He bent his face towards hers. She
closed her eyes again, and the lids fluttered with a sudden tremulous
movement at the touch of his light kiss.</p>

<p>For them there were no more minutes. But time passed, time passed
flowing in a dark stream, stanchlessly, as though from some profound
mysterious wound in the world’s side, bleeding, bleeding for ever.
One of the candles had burned down to the socket and the long,
smoky flame wavered unsteadily. The flickering light troubled
their eyes; the shadows twitched and stirred uneasily. Emily looked
up at him.</p>

<p>"What’s the time?" she said.</p>

<p>Gumbril looked at his watch. It was nearly one o’clock. "Too
late for you to get back," he said.</p>

<p>"Too late?" Emily sat-up. Ah, the enchantment was breaking, was
giving way, like a film of ice beneath a weight, like a web before
a thrust of the wind. They looked at one another. "What shall
I do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You could sleep here," Gumbril answered in a voice that came
from a long way away.</p>

<p>She sat for a long time in silence, looking through half-closed
eyes at the expiring candle flame. Gumbril watched her in an agony
of suspense. Was the ice to be broken, the web-work finally and
for ever torn? The enchantment could still be prolonged, the eternity
renewed. He felt his heart beating in his breast; he held his
breath. It would be terrible if she were to go now, it would be
a kind of death. The flame of the candle flickered more violently,
leaping up in a thin, long, smoky flare, sinking again almost
to darkness. Emily got up and blew out the candle. The other still
burned calmly and steadily.</p>

<p>"May I stay?" she asked. "Will you allow me?"</p>

<p>He understood the meaning of her question, and nodded. "Of course,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Of course? Is it as much of course as all that?"</p>

<p>"When I say so." He smiled at her. The eternity had been renewed,
the enchantment prolonged. There was no need to think of anything
now but the moment. The past was forgotten, the future abolished.
There was only this secret room and the candlelight and the unreal,
impossible happiness of being two. Now that this peril of a disenchantment
had been averted, it would last for ever. He got up from the couch,
crossed the room, he took her hands and kissed them.</p>

<p>"Shall we sleep now?" she asked.</p>

<p>Gumbril nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I blow out the light?" And without waiting for
his answer, Emily turned, gave a puff, and the room was in darkness.
He heard the rustling of her undressing. Hastily he stripped off
his own clothes, pulled back the coverlet from the divan. The
bed was made and ready; he opened it and slipped between the sheets.
A dim greenish light from the gas lamp in the street below came
up between the parted curtains illuminating faintly the farther
end of the room. Against this tempered darkness he could see her,
silhouetted, standing quite still, as if hesitating on some invisible
brink.</p>

<p>"Emily," he whispered.</p>

<p>"I’m coming," Emily answered. She stood there, unmoving, a few
seconds longer, then overstepped the brink. She came silently
across the room, and sat down on the edge of the low couch. Gumbril
lay perfectly still, without speaking, waiting in the enchanted
timeless darkness. Emily lifted her knees, slid her feet in under
the sheet, then stretched herself out beside him, her body, in
the narrow bed, touching his. Gumbril felt that she was trembling;
trembling, a sharp involuntary start, a little shudder, another
start.</p>

<p>"You’re cold," he said, and slipping one arm beneath her shoulders
he drew her, limp and unresisting, towards him. She lay there,
pressed against him. Gradually the trembling ceased. Quite still,
quite still in the calm of the enchantment. The past is forgotten,
the future abolished; there is only this dark and everlasting
moment. A drugged and intoxicated stupor of happiness possessed
his spirit; a numbness, warm and delicious, lay upon him. And
yet through the stupor he knew with a dreadful anxious certainty
that the end would soon be there. Like a man on the night before
his execution, he looked forward through the endless present;
he foresaw the end of his eternity. And after? Everything was
uncertain and unsafe.</p>

<p>Very gently, he began caressing her shoulder, her long slender
arm, drawing his finger-tips lightly and slowly over her smooth
skin; slowly from her neck, over her shoulder, lingeringly round
the elbow to her hand. Again, again; he was learning her arm.
The form of it was part of the knowledge, now, of his finger-tips;
his fingers knew it as they knew a piece of music, as they knew
Mozart’s Twelfth Sonata, for example. And the themes that crowd
so quickly one after another at the beginning of the first movement
played themselves serially, glitteringly in his mind; they became
a part of the enchantment.</p>

<p>Through the silk of her shift he learned her curving side, her
smooth straight back and the ridge of her spine. He stretched
down, touched her feet, her knees. Under the smock he learned
her warm body, lightly, slowly caressing. He knew her, his fingers,
he felt, could build her up, a warm and curving statue in the
darkness. He did not desire her; to desire would have been to
break the enchantment. He let himself sink deeper and deeper into
his dark stupor of happiness. She was asleep in his arms; and
soon he too was asleep. </p>
