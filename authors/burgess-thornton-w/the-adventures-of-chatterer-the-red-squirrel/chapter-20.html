<p>Chatterer had never had so many surprises&mdash;good surprises&mdash;in
all his life, as since the day he had been caught in a trap in
Farmer Brown's corn-crib. In the first place, it had been a great
surprise to him that he had not been given to Black Pussy, as
he had fully expected to be. Then had come the even greater surprise
of finding that Farmer Brown's boy was ever and ever so much nicer
than he had thought. A later surprise had been the wire wheel
in his cage, so that he could run to his heart's content. It was
such a pleasant and wholly unexpected surprise that it had quite
changed Chatterer's feelings towards Farmer Brown's boy.</p>

<p>The fact is, Chatterer could have been truly happy but for one
thing&mdash;he was a prisoner. Yes, Sir, he was a prisoner, and he
couldn't forget it for one minute while he was awake. He used
to watch Farmer Brown's boy and wish with all his might that he
could make him understand how dreadful it was to be in a prison.
But Farmer Brown's boy couldn't understand what Chatterer said,
no matter how hard Chatterer tried to make him. He seemed to think
that Chatterer was happy. He just didn't understand that not all
the good things in the world could make up for loss of freedom&mdash;that
it is better to be free, though hungry and cold, than in a prison
with every comfort.</p>

<p>Chatterer had stood it pretty well and made the best of things
until Sammy Jay had found him, and Reddy Fox had made fun of him,
and Peter Rabbit had peeped at him from behind the old stone wall.
The very sight of them going where they pleased and when they
pleased had been too much for Chatterer, and such a great longing
for the Green Forest and the Old Orchard filled his heart that
he could think of nothing else. He just sat in a corner of his
cage and looked as miserable as he felt. He lost his appetite.
In vain Farmer Brown's boy brought him the fattest nuts and other
dainties. He couldn't eat for the great longing for freedom that
filled his heart until it seemed ready to burst. He no longer
cared to run in the new wire wheel which had given him so much
pleasure at first. He was homesick, terribly homesick, and he
just couldn't help it.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy noticed it, and his face grew sober and thoughtful.
He watched Chatterer when the latter didn't know that he was about,
and if he couldn't understand Chatterer's talk, he could understand
Chatterer's actions. He knew that he was unhappy and guessed why.
One morning Chatterer did not come out of his hollow stump as
he usually did when his cage was placed on the shelf outside the
farmhouse door. He just didn't feel like it. He stayed curled
up in his bed for a long, long time, too sad and miserable to
move. At last he crawled up and peeped out of his little round
doorway. Chatterer gave a little gasp and rubbed his eyes. Was
he dreaming? He scrambled out in a hurry and peeped through the
wires of his cage. Then he rubbed his eyes again and rushed over
to the other side of the cage for another look. His cage wasn't
on the usual shelf at all! It was on the snow-covered stone wall
at the edge of the Old Orchard.</p>

<p>Chatterer was so excited he didn't know what to do. He raced
around the cage. Then he jumped into the wire wheel and made it
spin round and round as never before. When he was too tired to
run any more, he jumped out. And right then he discovered something
he hadn't noticed before. The little door in the top of his cage
was open! It must be that Farmer Brown's boy had forgotten to
close it when he put in Chatterer's breakfast. Chatterer forgot
that he was tired. Like a little red flash he was outside and
whisking along the snow-covered stone wall straight for his home
in the Old Orchard.</p>

<p>"Chickaree! Chickaree! Chickaree!" he shouted as he ran.</p>
