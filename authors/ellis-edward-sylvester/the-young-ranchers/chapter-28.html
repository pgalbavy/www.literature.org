<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The young rancher had calculated matters closely, for hardly
was he in the saddle when the foremost of the running Sioux halted,
raised his gun, and fired. He was nigh enough to make his shot
dangerous, though providentially it did no ill.</p>

<p>It was an inviting chance for Warren to return the fire with
the best prospect of doing so effectively. But he had no disposition
to slay any one of the hostiles. His singular experience with
Starcus had a softening effect, and he was resolved to attempt
no injury against the men unless compelled to do it in actual
self-defence.</p>

<p>Jack, being put to his best paces, quickly carried him beyond
any further peril, and when far enough to feel safe he checked
the pony and looked back.</p>

<p>He saw half a dozen Sioux gathered around the wounded Starcus,
evidently in conversation. Being strong in his lower limbs, and
with his wounded arm bandaged as well as it could be, he required
no attention or help from them. After all, knowing the buck had
been a close friend of the young rancher, they must have seen
nothing remarkable in the mercy that had been shown to him. White
men are as capable of meanness and cruelty as the Indians, but
few of them disregard the laws of honorable warfare, and still
fewer are deaf to the cry of a hapless foe.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the group moved slowly back in the direction
of the ridge. A couple, however, drew off, and began a more systematic
hunt of the ponies that had shown such a fondness for their freedom.
They managed matters with such skill that they soon coaxed a couple
of the fleetest back to captivity. With the aid of these they
soon corralled the others, and the party gathered with their animals
at the base of the ridge.</p>

<p>Warren Starr remained at a safe distance for the greater part
of an hour, in the hope of learning something of the intentions
of the Sioux. But they gave no sign that he could understand.
The ponies were in plain sight near the trees, and he caught glimpses
of their owners moving back and forth, but nothing could be learned
as to what it all meant.</p>

<p>He now debated what he should next do. He was free, well mounted,
and at liberty to follow his own judgment.</p>

<p>His immediate anxiety was concerning Tim Brophy. He knew he was
in the most perilous strait of his life; Warren's parents might
be as badly situated, but he had no knowledge of the fact. He
therefore hoped for the best concerning them. But if there was
any way of helping his friend it was beyond his power to discover
it. He was a prisoner in the hands of a dozen watchful and treacherous
Sioux, who were not likely to give him the least chance of escape,
and any attempt on the part of Warren to befriend him would not
only be utterly useless, but would imperil his own life.</p>

<p>He had appealed to Starcus to make the effort, but Warren saw
the force of the Indian's declaration that it was beyond his power.
He was wounded himself, and at the first move to interfere in
behalf of the captive, who had killed one of their best warriors
and badly bruised a couple, would be likely to bring down their
vengeance upon his own head. Distressing as was the conclusion,
there was no escaping it&mdash;he must turn his back on his devoted
comrade. Warren accepted the situation like a martyr, and had
decided to continue his search for his folks, of whose whereabouts
he had only the vaguest idea.</p>

<p>Two lines of action presented themselves, and there was much
to be said in favor of and against both. By sharp riding he could
reach Fort Meade before sunset, and there whatever help he might
need would be cheerfully given by the commandant. Under the guidance
of the friendly Indian scouts, they could search for the rancher
and his family; and their knowledge of the people, as well as
the country, would render such search far more effective than
any by the youth, without taking into account the force that would
insure safety instantly on such discovery.</p>

<p>But this plan involved considerable time, with the certainty
that his folks must spend another night in imminent peril&mdash;a night
that he could not help believing was to prove the decisive one.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of the death of Jared Plummer, Warren hoped that
he was with his father, despite the gloomy prophecy of Tim Brophy.
If the young rancher could join them, the party would be considerable,
and ought to hold its own against any band of Indians such as
were roaming through the country. Besides, all would be well mounted
and prepared for flight whenever advisable.</p>

<p>These and other considerations, which it is not necessary to
name, decided the youth to make further search for his folks before
riding to Fort Meade.</p>

<p>One fact caused him no little speculation. It will be remembered
that the approach of himself and Tim to the ridge was caused by
the discovery of a thin column of smoke climbing into the sky
from a more elevated portion than that attained by themselves
or the Sioux with whom they had had the stirring encounter.</p>

<p>He did not forget, either, that the red men with whom they had
exchanged shots, and from whom he had escaped by the narrowest
chance conceivable, appeared from the opposite direction. Neither
then, nor at any time since, had anything occurred to explain
the meaning of the vapor that had arrested their attention when
miles away.</p>

<p>If it had been kindled by Sioux or brother hostiles, why had
they not appeared and taken a hand in the lively proceedings?
Abundant time was given, and if they were there they ought to
have met the fugitives at the close of their desperate chase,
when they sprang from the back of Jack and dashed among the trees
on foot.</p>

<p>It was these questions which caused the youth to suspect that
the fire might have been started by his father. True, he had expressed
a disbelief in this view when given by Tim, but that was before
the later phase had dawned upon him.</p>

<p>It looked like a rash act on the part of the rancher, if he had
performed it, but there might be excuse for his appealing to the
signal that he had employed in a former instance to apprise his
son of his location.</p>

<p>Speculation and guessing, however, could go on forever without
result. There was but one way of learning the truth, and that
was to investigate for himself.</p>

<p>Prudence demanded that the Sioux at the base of the ridge should
be given no inkling of his intention; and, in order to prevent
it, a long detour was necessary to take him out of their field
of vision.</p>

<p>Accordingly he turned so as to follow a course parallel to the
ridge, and breaking into a swift canter kept it up until, when
he turned in the saddle and looked back, not the first sign of
the hostiles was visible.</p>

<p>He was now miles distant, too far to return on foot, even had
he felt inclined to abandon Jack and try it alone. He rode close
to the base of the ridge, whose curving course was favorable,
and facing about started back toward the point he had left after
his survey of the party that held Tim Brophy a prisoner.</p>

<p>He did not believe there was any special danger in this, for
he had only to maintain a sharp lookout to detect the Sioux, if
they happened to be journeying in that direction. The broad stretch
of open plain gave him every chance he could ask to turn the fleetness
of Jack to the best account: and he feared no pursuit that could
be made, where he was granted anything like a chance.</p>

<p>His purpose was to approach as near the spot as was prudent,
provided they remained where he last saw them, and then, dismounting,
penetrate nigh enough to learn the meaning of the smoke which
was such an interesting fact to him. The task was a difficult
one, for it was more than probable that by the time he reached
the neighborhood of the signal fire it would be extinguished;
for certainly his father would not continue the display after
it had failed in its purpose, and the appearance of the hostiles
showed him that it was liable to do more harm than good.</p>
