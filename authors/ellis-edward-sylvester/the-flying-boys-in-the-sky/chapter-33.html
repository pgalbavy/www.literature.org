<p>Harvey Hamilton stayed in Chesterton till the close of the incidents
just narrated. His interest was so stirred that he had no wish
to leave before their conclusion. During the hours of waiting,
he made several short flights in his aeroplane, and when he and
Detective Pendar were called upon to give their evidence the flying
machine was convenient. In addition, he gave several of the townsmen
the most thrilling experiences of their lives. He invited Uncle
Tommy Waters to accompany him on an aerial excursion, but a million
dollars would not have tempted the old gentleman to take his feet
off the firm earth.</p>

<p>A seemingly small matter gave the young aviator anxiety. Upon
his return from the explosion of the shanty, he expected to find
Bohunkus Johnson either sitting on the porch of the hotel or strolling
about the town. Although the colored youth was offended by the
brusque reproof of Harvey, it was not his nature to hold a grudge,
and his friend was prepared to meet him half way and apologize
for his hasty words, but no Bohunkus showed up. The night passed
without his appearance. Harvey went to his room in the early morning
only to find that his bed had not been occupied.</p>

<p>"He has gone home," was the conclusion of the youth. "If he wishes
to pout I shall not interfere, but he ought to have left some
word for me."</p>

<p>While waiting in Chesterton, Harvey wrote a letter to his father,
giving a full account of the recovery of little Grace Hastings,
her restoration to her parents and the capture of the two surviving
members of the Black Hand, which, as has been stated, was duly
followed by their sentence to long terms in the penitentiary.
This letter was crossed by one from his father, which confirmed
the explanation made by Mr. Pendar of the wrecking of the first
aeroplane. He had received quick notice of the misfortune from
Professor Morgan, and sympathizing with his son had provided him
with a second flying machine in record time. When a young man
who took an aerial ride with Harvey told him he had seen the two
supposed commercial travelers in the vicinity of the hotel sheds
at daylight of the eventful morning, the last shadow of doubt
was removed as to the identity of the offenders.</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings paid over the entire reward to Simmons Pendar, who
would have insisted that one-half of the large sum should go to
Harvey Hamilton, had the latter not notified him that any such
proposition would be accepted as an insult.</p>

<p>Despite a feeling of vexation, Harvey became so concerned over
Bohunkus that he finally telegraphed to Mr. Cecil Hartley, the
farmer to whom the colored boy had been bound years before, and
asked whether he was at home. The reply was that he had not been
seen since he left in the aeroplane with Harvey. This was disquieting
news and the youth did not know what to make of it. Had not Detective
Pendar been absent just then he would have applied to him for
counsel. Enlightenment, however, came from an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the second day, after the guests at
the hotel had eaten supper and left the dining-room, that the
landlord came out and sat down near Harvey, who occupied a chair
at the farther end of the porch. The boniface was chuckling as
if in good humor over something. Harvey wondered what it could
be.</p>

<p>"You ain’t worrying about that darkey of yours?" was the first
question.</p>

<p>"I am not worried so much as I am curious," replied the youth;
"he took offense the other day because I reproved him for an act
of stupidity, but it is not his nature to sulk so long. I thought
he had gone home, but learned a short while ago that he hasn’t
been there."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he’s a long way from home by this time."</p>

<p>"Do you know where he is?" asked the startled Harvey.</p>

<p>"Not precisely, but I reckon I can make a good guess."</p>

<p>"Please do so."</p>

<p>"You remember that after that queer crank that they call Professor
Morgan had blowed up the headquarters of them kidnappers, he did
not stay in them parts."</p>

<p>"No; I noticed he headed for Chesterton."</p>

<p>"That’s where he came; he landed in the shed yard near the spot
where your machine was smashed and had hardly touched the airth
when that darkey of yours was there and the two begun talking
together mighty earnest."</p>

<p>"Do you know what it was about?" asked Harvey, in whose mind
a sudden suspicion had formed.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what was said at first, ’cause they was too fur
off for me to hear, but they hadn’t been talking more’n five minutes—maybe
not that long—when they walked up on the porch and sot down. I
was standing a few feet from them looking out at the things which
was beginning to hum, so I heard about all that was said. What
do you ’spose it was about?"</p>

<p>"I can make a guess, but I prefer you should tell me."</p>

<p>"That darkey said something about his father that was a famous
chief in Africa that he’d like to visit, and he asked the Professor
if he couldn’t take him there. The Professor said nothing in the
world was easier, though he wasn’t sure his machine was quite
ready, but it would be very soon. He had made a lot of wonderful
inventions and had figured out things so he could keep afloat
in the air for nigh twenty-four hours. They would have to do better
than that to cross the Atlantic Ocean, but he hadn’t any doubt
he would soon have matters settled so there would be no trouble.
As near as I could make out, the Professor invited him to go along
and stay with him while he finished some experiments and got things
fixed so he could remain aloft for two or three weeks, without
taking aboard any new ile."</p>

<p>"And Bohunkus agreed to that!" exclaimed Harvey.</p>

<p>"If that is the darkey’s name, he jumped at the chance. The Professor’s
idea was to wait at the hotel here for two or three days, till
matters sort of quieted down, but the African insisted they should
start at once."</p>

<p>"That perhaps was natural, but did he give any reasons for his
haste?"</p>

<p>The landlord chuckled again.</p>

<p>"He said it was on your account; you was always interfering with
his affairs, and you’d be sure to make objections; you meant well,
but you didn’t know much and they would have trouble with you
if they didn’t leave before you got back. I hope you ain’t offended
with the words I’m telling you."</p>

<p>"Offended!" repeated Harvey, "that good-hearted fellow couldn’t
offend me; I only feel concern because he has placed himself in
the hands of a lunatic."</p>

<p>"That’s the Professor and no mistake. Well, the darkey had it
all his own way. Not long after, they walked out to the shed yards
and shot away in that outlandish machine that doesn’t make any
noise and travels like a greased streak of lightning. Before they
started, the Professor told the darkey he must not write any letter
of explanation to you."</p>

<p>"Did he do so?"</p>

<p>"He didn’t think of it at first, but the Professor had reminded
him, so he went to his own room and wrote without his knowledge."</p>

<p>"What did he do with the letter?"</p>

<p>"Gave it to me."</p>

<p>"And why didn’t you hand it to me?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"‘Cause I had to promise I wouldn’t till this evening after supper.
The darkey explained that if you got it too soon, you’d butt in
and upset things and he didn’t mean to have anything like that.
Here’s the letter."</p>

<p>And the landlord drew a missive from his inner coat pocket and
handed it to Harvey, remarking as he did so:</p>

<p>"I had a mind to give it to you as soon as you and the detective
got back, for I didn’t feel right about that outlandish scheme
of the Professor, but I had made my promise and stuck to it."</p>

<p>Excusing himself, Harvey Hamilton walked into the writing-room,
and under the glare of the gaslight unfolded a sheet of paper
which was not inclosed in an envelope. He recognized the scrawling
hand that had written his name on the outside and read the following
amazing communication. The only liberty I have taken with it is
in the way of punctuation, in order to help make clear the meaning:</p>

<p>Harvey smiled at this phonetic system run mad. Then an expression
of worriment clouded his countenance.</p>

<p>"Poor Bunk! You don’t know what you are doing. You have gone
into a danger from which heaven alone can save you; but I shall
do all I can without wasting an hour, though I fear it is too
late."</p>
