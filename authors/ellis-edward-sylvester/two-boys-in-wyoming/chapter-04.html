<p>It takes a good deal to startle an American Indian, but if there
ever was a frightened red man it was the one who heard himself
thus addressed, and, glancing like a flash to his right, saw Jack
Dudley step forward, with a Winchester rifle leveled at him.</p>

<p>In the language of the West, the youth "had the drop" on the
intruder, and he knew it. Had he attempted to raise his own weapon,
or to draw his knife and assail the youth, that instant the trigger
of the rifle would have been pressed and the career of the buck
would have ended then and there, and he knew that, too; but the
fact that the gun was not fired, and that a direct question was
addressed to him, told the Indian that his master was less merciless
than he would have been had their situations been reversed.</p>

<p>The camp-fire was still burning brightly, and the reflection
showed on the painted visage. Jack, having stepped forward into
the circle of light, was also plainly discerned by the Indian,
who, turning his black, serpent-like eyes upon him, said, without
a tremor in his voice:</p>

<p>"Me good Injin; me friend of white man; me no hurt him."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look as if you would; but what is your business?
Why do you steal into our camp like a thief of the night?"</p>

<p>"Me hungry&mdash;want somethin' eat."</p>

<p>This was too transparent a subterfuge to deceive one even so
unaccustomed to life in these solitudes as Jack Dudley. An Indian
wandering through a country so well stocked with game as this
portion of the new State of Wyoming never suffers for food; and,
were such a thing possible, the present means was the last that
he would adopt to procure it.</p>

<p>"If you want something to eat, why did you not come forward openly
and ask for it?"</p>

<p>The fellow did not seem fully to grasp the question, but he repeated:</p>

<p>"Me hungry."</p>

<p>Jack recalled that there was not a mouthful of food in camp.
Had there been, he probably would have invited the visitor to
walk to the fire and partake. It was fortunate for the youth that
their larder was empty, for had the two started among the trees
in the direction of the camp, the opportunity for which the Indian
was doubtless waiting would have been secured. There would have
been an interval in the brief walk when the advantage would have
been shifted to him, and he would have seized it with the quickness
of lightning.</p>

<p>The manifest duty of Jack was to shout to Hank Hazletine and
bring him to the spot. He would read the truth on the instant
and do the right thing; but the situation, as the reader will
admit, was peculiar, and the motive which prevented the youth
from adopting this line of action was creditable to him. He believed
that the moment the guide appeared he would shoot the intruder,
and that was too frightful an issue for Jack to contemplate. He
did not want this warrior's life, and would not take it except
to save his own or that of his friends.</p>

<p>Jack believed that enough had been gained in thoroughly frightening
the Indian, and the thing desired now was to get rid of him with
the least possible delay. He did not think he would intrude again,
even if he had companions within call.</p>

<p>"We have no food; we can give you nothing; you must go elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Then me go;" and, as if the business was concluded, the buck
turned about and began walking toward the edge of the grove. Yielding
to a whim which he did not fully understand, Jack Dudley followed
him with the warning words:</p>

<p>"If you stop, or turn about, or make a move to shoot, I will
kill you."</p>

<p>It is probable that the savage contemplated some movement of
the kind, but he must have known the fatal risk involved. Quick
as he was, he could not whirl about and bring his gun to a level
before the young man would pull the trigger of the Winchester,
which was held pointed toward him. He knew that so long as he
obeyed orders he would be unharmed, and he would have been a zany
had he hesitated to do so.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate, but with a deliberate step that was not
lacking in a certain dignity he walked slowly between the trees,
with his captor only a few paces behind and keeping pace with
him.</p>

<p>Almost on the edge of the grove Jack Dudley made an interesting
discovery. A pony, smaller than the one he had ridden from Fort
Steele, stood motionless in the shadow, awaiting the return of
his master. He was not tethered or tied, for he was too well-trained
to make that necessary. He showed his fine training further by
merely pricking his ears and elevating his head upon the approach
of his master and companion. A whinny or neigh might have betrayed
both.</p>

<p>The two were now so far removed from the glow of the camp-fire
that they could see each other only dimly. There was no moon in
the sky, though the stars were shining brightly. The Indian, from
the force of circumstances, was compelled to hold his disadvantageous
position, inasmuch as he had to move out from among the trees,
while Jack remained within their shadows.</p>

<p>Realizing that this was a critical moment, he stood motionless,
with his weapon still at a dead level.</p>

<p>"My gun is aimed at your heart," he said, "and I am watching
every movement you make. Go in peace, and you shall not be harmed,
but on your first attempt to injure me you die."</p>

<p>The words, perhaps, were unnecessary, for it may be said that
the action of the youth was more eloquent. Be that as it may,
the redskin showed a commendable promptness in all that he did.
He vaulted lightly upon the bare back of his pony, whose bridle
consisted of but a single thong, and turned the head of the brute
outward. He did not speak, for it was not required. The pony knew
what was wanted; and, with his nose pointed out on the prairie,
he emerged from among the trees into the open, with the warrior
astride.</p>

<p>Even in that trying moment Jack Dudley was surprised at one fact&mdash;that
was the wonderful silence of the animal. It would seem that his
hoofs should have given out sounds that could have been heard
for a considerable distance in the stillness of the night, but
it was as if he were treading on velvet. The noise was so faint
that it was easy to understand how he had come to the spot without
betraying himself to the intently listening sentinel. No wonder
that the Indian ponies sometimes display a sagacity fully equal,
in some respects, to that of their masters.</p>

<p>The Indian showed in another direction his perception of the
situation. Had he been leaving the presence of one of his own
race, or of a veteran white scout, he would have thrown himself
forward on the back of his animal and ridden off on a dead run,
for, despite the unexpected mercy shown him, he would have expected
treachery at the last minute; but he had seen his master and knew
that he was a young tenderfoot, inspired by a chivalrous honor
which is the exception in that section of the country. He would
not shoot until good cause was given, and therefore he took care
not to give such cause.</p>

<p>As if in harmony with the spirit of his rider, the pony walked
away in a direct line, until the figure of himself and master
disappeared in the gloom. When he could see him no more, Jack
lowered his gun, and stooping down, pressed his ear against the
earth. He could hear the soft hoof-beats of the horse growing
fainter and fainter, until at the end of a minute or two the impressive
silence once more held reign. Then the youth arose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I suppose Hank will tell me I did wrong," he mused, "but my
conscience does not; it would be a woeful memory to carry with
me that on my first night in Wyoming I took the life of a human
being. Perhaps it will be as well that Hank should not know it;
I will think it over."</p>

<p>Now, while Jack Dudley had conducted himself in some respects
like a veteran, yet he had shown a dangerous short-sightedness
in another direction. It will be noted that he had busied himself
wholly with the single intruder, and at the moment of losing sight
of him the young man was a comparatively long distance from the
camp-fire. Had it been that there were two or more hostiles stealing
into camp, they could not have asked a better opportunity, for
it was left wholly unguarded. A single warrior would have had
no trouble in creeping undiscovered to a point from which he could
have sent a bullet through the unconscious forms of Hank Hazletine
and Fred Greenwood. This probability never occurred to Jack until
he started on his return to the fire, from whose immediate vicinity
he should never have allowed himself to have been tempted.</p>

<p>Even then his strange remissness would not have impressed itself
upon him but for a startling discovery. The fire was beginning
to smoulder once more, but enough of its glare penetrated the
wood for him to note the black, column-like trunks of the trees
between it and him. With his gaze upon the central point, he saw
a figure moving in the path of light and coming toward him. It
looked as if stamped in ink against the yellow background, and,
like the former intruder, was advancing without noise.</p>

<p>An awful fear thrilled Jack Dudley as he abruptly halted and
partly raised his Winchester.</p>

<p>"While I have been busy with one Indian, another has entered
the camp and slain Fred and Hank! He is now after me! There will
be no hesitation <em>this</em> time in my shooting!"</p>

<p>Before he could secure anything like an aim, the other stepped
behind one of the trunks on his right. Jack waited for him to
reappear, ready to fire, but unwilling to do so until the truth
was established.</p>

<p>While waiting thus, a low, faint, tremulous whistle reached his
ears. It was the most welcome of all sounds, and raised him from
the depths of woe to blissful happiness, for it was the familiar
signal of Fred Greenwood that had been employed many times in
their hunting excursions nearer home.</p>

<p>Instead of an enemy, it was his chum and dearest friend who was
approaching him. Jack instantly answered the guarded hail, and
the next minute the two came together.</p>

<p>"How is it you are awake?" was the first question of Jack.</p>

<p>"Because it is <em>time</em> for me to awake; it was agreed that
I should go on duty at a little after twelve, and it must be near
one o'clock."</p>

<p>"But what awoke you?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Haven't you and I travelled together long enough to
know that when you go to sleep with your mind fixed on a certain
time to awake you are sure not to miss it by more than a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"You are right; I had forgotten that. How was it you knew where
to look for me?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I've been prowling around camp for fifteen minutes,
groping here and there and signaling to you, without the first
inkling of where you were. I didn't want to awake Hank, and therefore
was as careful as I could be. I began to suspect you had sat down
somewhere and fallen asleep."</p>

<p>"I have had enough to keep the most drowsy person awake."</p>

<p>And thereupon Jack gave the particulars of all that had occurred
while he was acting as sentinel. It need not be said that Fred
Greenwood was astonished, for the manner of their guide before
lying down convinced them that no danger of any nature threatened
them.</p>

<p>"Do you think I acted right, Fred?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly you did. Hank and the like of him out in this
country talk about shooting down an Indian as if he were not a
human being, but they have souls like the rest of us, and we have
no more right to take the life of one of them than I have to take
yours. I am sure I should have done just as you did."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that. I wonder whether, if we stayed
out here a few years, our feelings would change?"</p>

<p>"No; for the principle of right and wrong cannot change. Do you
remember what that old settler told us on the train, a couple
of days ago?"</p>

<p>"I do not recall it."</p>

<p>"He said that at a little town in Montana they had a great moral
question under debate for a long time without being able to decide
it. It was whether it was wicked for the men to go out hunting
for Indians on Sunday. It was all right on week days, but most
of the folks seemed to think it was a violation of the sanctity
of the day to indulge in the sport on the Sabbath. But, Jack,
you are tired and in need of sleep. I'll take charge of matters
until two o'clock."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether anything will happen to you? It does not seem
likely, for I must have given that fellow such a scare that he
will not show himself again."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't reason on the basis that he is the only red
man in Wyoming. However, I shall do my best. Good-night."</p>

<p>Thus summarily dismissed, Jack returned to the camp-fire in quest
of the slumber which he needed. Fred had thrown additional wood
on the blaze, and that accounted for the increase in illumination.
Hank Hazletine did not seem to have stirred since lying down.
He breathed heavily, and doubtless was gaining the rest which
men of his habits and training know how to acquire under the most
unfavorable circumstances. The youth wrapped his blanket about
his figure, for he was now sensible that the air was colder than
at any time since leaving the railway station. He was nervous
over the recollection of his experience, though it would have
been deemed of slight importance to one who had spent his life
in the West. The feeling soon passed off, however, and he joined
the veteran in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>And thus the burden of responsibility was shifted to the shoulders
of Fred Greenwood, the junior by a few months of Jack Dudley.
No one could have been more deeply impressed with his responsibility
than Fred. He knew that a hostile red man had entered the grove
while two of the party were asleep, and, but for the watchfulness
of the sentinel, might have slain all three.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about Indians," reflected Fred, "but I have
been told that they are a revengeful people. That fellow must
be angered because he was outwitted by Jack, and it will be just
like him to steal back for the purpose of revenge. It won't do
for me to wink both eyes at the same time."</p>

<p>This was a wise resolution, and the youth took every precaution
against committing what was likely to be a fatal mistake. Although
his sleep was broken, and he could have consumed several hours
additional with enjoyment, he was never more wide-awake. The temptation
was strong to sit down on the ground with his back against a tree,
but he foresaw the consequences. The man who yields only for a
few minutes to the creeping drowsiness is gone.</p>

<p>Fred was more circumspect, even, than his chum. Instead of taking
his position beside the trunk of one of the trees, he walked silently
around in a circle, keeping the camp-fire as a centre. By this
means he not only kept his senses keyed to a high point, but made
his espionage nearer perfect than his friend had done.</p>

<p>That the night was not to pass without a stirring experience
to the younger lad was soon evident. As nearly as he could guess,
without consulting his watch, it was about one o'clock, when he
became aware that some person or animal was astir in the grove.
He heard the faint footfalls on the ground, though for a time
he was unable to catch so much as a shadowy glimpse of the intruder.</p>

<p>"I believe it is that Indian, who has come back to square accounts
with Jack for getting the better of him. The wisest thing for
me to do is to not allow him to see me."</p>

<p>This was wise; and, to prevent such a disaster, Fred adopted
the precise tactics that had been used by his friend. He stationed
himself beside a friendly trunk, which so interposed between himself
and the fire that he was invisible, no matter from what direction
approached. Standing thus, he peered into the surrounding gloom
and listened with all the intensity of which he was capable.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught a glimpse of the intruder. The relief was
unspeakable when he saw that it was not an Indian, but some kind
of a wild animal. It was but a short distance off, and between
him and the outer edge of the grove.</p>

<p>There being no one to replenish the fire, the light had grown
dimmer, but a quick, shadowy flitting told Fred the brute was
moving briskly about, only a few paces from where the lad was
straining his vision to learn its nature.</p>

<p>"We might as well wind up this business," reflected Fred, as,
with his hand on the trigger of his Winchester, he started abruptly
in the direction of the stranger. The latter was quick to perceive
him and whisked away. The lad followed, breaking into a trot despite
the intervening trees. The beast continued fleeing, for nothing
so disconcerts an animal as the threatening approach of a foe.</p>

<p>It was but a few paces to the edge of the timber, when the brute
leaped out into full view in the star-gleam.</p>

<p>One glance was sufficient for the youth to recognize it as an
immense wolf, which had probably been drawn to the spot by the
odor of the meat that composed the dinner of the party. Fifty
feet off the wolf stopped, turned partly about, and looked back
at his pursuer, as if to learn whether he intended to follow him
farther.</p>

<p>Fred did not, but the opportunity was too good to be lost. The
aim was inviting, and, bringing his rifle to his shoulder, he
sighted as best he could and pulled the trigger. He could not
have done better had the sun been shining. The bullet passed directly
through the skull of the wolf, which uttered a sharp yelp, leaped
several feet into the air, and, doubling up like a jack-knife,
fell upon his side, where, after several convulsive struggles,
he lay still.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, the boy was elated over his success, for the
shot was certainly an excellent one.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "Jack frightened off the Indians, and I think
I have given the wild animals a good lesson. At any rate, <em>you</em>
won't bother us any more."</p>

<p>He supposed that the report of the gun would awaken Hazletine
and bring him to the spot to learn the explanation, but nothing
of that nature followed. If the report disturbed him, he merely
opened and closed his eyes, and continued to slumber, after the
manner of one who appreciates the value of rest.</p>

<p>In truth, it was always a matter of wonderment to the boys that
their veteran guide adopted the course he followed that night.
That actual danger impended was proven by the incidents already
narrated, and yet he entrusted the safety of one of the boys,
as well as his own life, to another, who, until then, had never
been in a similar position. Why he did so would be hard to explain,
but he never admitted that his course was a mistake. Sometimes,
as is well known, a boy is taught to swim by flinging him into
deep water, where he must choose between keeping afloat and drowning;
and it may be the guide believed that, by tossing his young friends
into the midst of danger at the very beginning of their experience
as Western hunters, they would acquire the needed skill the more
quickly.</p>
