<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The completed cage, with Gipsy behind the bars, framed a spectacle
sufficiently thrilling and panther-like. Gipsy raved, "spat",
struck virulently at taunting fingers, turned on his wailing siren
for minutes at a time, and he gave his imitation of a dromedary
almost continuously. These phenomena could be intensified in picturesqueness,
the boys discovered, by rocking the cage a little, tapping it
with a hammer, or raking the bars with a stick. Altogether, Gipsy
was having a lively afternoon.</p>

<p>There came a vigorous rapping on the alley door of the stable,
and Verman was admitted.</p>

<p>"Yay, Verman!" cried Sam Williams. "Come and look at our good
ole panther!"</p>

<p>Another curiosity, however, claimed Verman's attention. His eyes
opened wide, and he pointed at Herman's legs.</p>

<p>"Wha' ma' oo? Mammy hay oo hip ap hoe-woob."</p>

<p>"Mammy tell ME git 'at stove-wood?" Herman interpreted resentfully.
"How'm I go' git 'at stove-wood when my britches down bottom 'at
cistern, I like you answer ME please? You shet 'at do' behime
you!"</p>

<p>Verman complied, and again pointing to his brother's legs, requested
to be enlightened.</p>

<p>"Sin' I tole you once they down bottom 'at cistern," Herman shouted,
much exasperated. "You wan' know how come so, you ast Sam Williams.
He say thishere cat tuck an' th'owed 'em down there!"</p>

<p>Sam, who was busy rocking the cage, remained cheerfully absorbed
in that occupation.</p>

<p>"Come look at our good ole panther, Verman," he called. "I'll
get this circus-cage rockin' right good, an' then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Penrod; "I got sumpthing I got to think
about. Quit rockin' it! I guess I got a right to think about sumpthing
without havin' to go deaf, haven't I?"</p>

<p>Having obtained the quiet so plaintively requested, he knit his
brow and gazed intently upon Verman, then upon Herman, then upon
Gipsy. Evidently his idea was fermenting. He broke the silence
with a shout.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> know, Sam! I know what we'll do <em>NOW! I </em>just
thought of it, and it's goin' to be sumpthing I bet there aren't
any other boys in this town could do, because where would they
get any good ole panther like we got, and Herman and Verman? And
they'd haf to have a dog, too&mdash;and we got our good ole Dukie,
I guess. I bet we have the greatest ole time this afternoon we
ever had in our lives!"</p>

<p>His enthusiasm roused the warm interest of Sam&mdash;and Verman, though
Herman, remaining cold and suspicious, asked for details.</p>

<p>"An' I like to hear if it's sump'm'," he concluded, "what's go'
git me my britches back outen 'at cistern!"</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't exackly that," said Penrod. "It's different from
that. What I'm thinkin' about, well, for us to have it the way
it ought to be, so's you and Verman would look like natives&mdash;well,
Verman ought to take off his britches, too."</p>

<p>"Mo!" said Verman, shaking his head violently. "Mo!"</p>

<p>"Well, wait a minute, can't you?" Sam Williams said. "Give Penrod
a chance to say what he wants to, first, can't you? Go on, Penrod."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Sam," said Penrod, turning to this sympathetic
auditor; "you remember that movin'-pitcher show we went to, 'Fortygraphing
Wild Animals in the Jungle'. Well, Herman wouldn't have to do
a thing more to look like those natives we saw that the man called
the 'beaters'. They were dressed just about like the way he is
now, and if Verman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"MO!" said Verman.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>WAIT </em>a minute, Verman!" Sam entreated. "Go on,
Penrod."</p>

<p>"Well, we can make a mighty good jungle up in the loft," Penrod
continued eagerly. "We can take that ole dead tree that's out
in the alley and some branches, and I bet we could have the best
jungle you ever saw. And then we'd fix up a kind of place in there
for our panther, only, of course, we'd haf to keep him in the
cage so's he wouldn't run away; but we'd pretend he was loose.
And then you remember how they did with that calf? Well, we'd
have Duke for the tied-up calf for the panther to come out and
jump on, so they could fortygraph him. Herman can be the chief
beater, and we'll let Verman be the other beaters, and I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yay!" shouted Sam Williams. "I'll be the fortygraph man!"</p>

<p>"No," said Penrod; "you be the one with the gun that guards the
fortygraph man, because I'm the fortygraph man already. You can
fix up a mighty good gun with this carpenter shop, Sam. We'll
make spears for our good ole beaters, too, and I'm goin' to make
me a camera out o' that little starch-box and a bakin'-powder
can that's goin' to be a mighty good ole camera. We can do lots
more things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yay!" Sam cried. "Let's get started!" He paused. "Wait a minute,
Penrod. Verman says he won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, he's got to!" said Penrod.</p>

<p>"I momp!" Verman insisted, almost distinctly.</p>

<p>They began to argue with him; but, for a time, Verman remained
firm. They upheld the value of dramatic consistency, declaring
that a beater dressed as completely as he was "wouldn't look like
anything at all". He would "spoil the whole biznuss", they said,
and they praised Herman for the faithful accuracy of his costume.
They also insisted that the garment in question was much too large
for Verman, anyway, having been so recently worn by Herman and
turned over to Verman with insufficient alteration, and they expressed
surprise that "anybody with any sense"  should make such a point
of clinging to a misfit.</p>

<p>Herman sided against his brother in this controversy, perhaps
because a certain loneliness, of which he was censcious, might
be assuaged by the company of another trouserless person&mdash;or it
may be that his motive was more sombre. Possibly he remembered
that Verman's trousers were his own former property and might
fit him in case the promise for five o'clock turned out badly.
At all events, Verman finally yielded under great pressure, and
consented to appear in the proper costume of the multitude of
beaters it now became his duty to personify.</p>

<p>Shouting, the boys dispersed to begin the preparation of their
jungle scene. Sam and Penrod went for branches and the dead tree,
while Herman and Verman carried the panther in his cage to the
loft, where the first thing that Verman did was to hang his trousers
on a nail in a conspicuous and accessible spot near the doorway.
And with the arrival of Penrod and Sam, panting and dragging no
inconsiderable thicket after them, the coloured brethren began
to take a livelier interest in things. Indeed, when Penrod, a
little later, placed in their hands two spears, pointed with tin,
their good spirits were entirely restored, and they even began
to take a pride in being properly uncostumed beaters.</p>

<p>Sam's gun and Penrod's camera were entirely satisfactory, especially
the latter. The camera was so attractive, in fact, that the hunter
and the chief beater and all the other beaters immediately resigned
and insisted upon being photographers. Each had to be given a
"turn" before the jungle project could be resumed.</p>

<p>"Now, for goodnesses' sakes," said Penrod, taking the camera
from Verman, "I hope you're done, so's we can get started doin
something like we ought to! We got to have Duke for a tied-up
calf. We'll have to bring him and tie him out here in front the
jungle, and then the panther'll come out and jump on him. Wait,
and I'll go bring him."</p>

<p>Departing upon this errand, Penrod found Duke enjoying the declining
rays of the sun in the front yard.</p>

<p>"Hyuh, Duke!" called his master, in an indulgent tone. "Come
on, good ole Dukie! Come along!"</p>

<p>Duke rose conscientiously and followed him.</p>

<p>"I got him, men!" Penrod called from the stairway. "I got our
good ole calf all ready to be tied up. Here he is!" And he appeared
in the doorway with the unsuspecting little dog beside him.</p>

<p>Gipsy, who had been silent for some moments, instantly raised
his banshee battlecry, and Duke yelped in horror. Penrod made
a wild effort to hold him; but Duke was not to be detained. Unnatural
strength and activity came to him in his delirium, and, for the
second or two that the struggle lasted, his movements were too
rapid for the eyes of the spectators to follow&mdash;merely a whirl
and blur in the air could be seen. Then followed a sound of violent
scrambling and Penrod sprawled alone at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, why'n't you come and help me?" he demanded indignantly.
"I couldn't get him back now if I was to try a million years!"</p>

<p>"What we goin' to do about it?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>Penrod rose and dusted his knees. "We got to get along without
any tied-up calf&mdash;that's certain! But I got to take those fortygraphs
<em>SOME </em>way or other!"</p>

<p>"Me an' Verman aw ready begin 'at beatin'," Herman suggested.
"You tole us we the beaters."</p>

<p>"Well, wait a minute," said Penrod, whose feeling for realism
in drama was always alert. "I want to get a mighty good pitcher
o' that ole panther this time." As he spoke, he threw open the
wide door intended for the delivery of hay into the loft from
the alley below. "Now, bring the cage over here by this door so's
I can get a better light; it's gettin' kind of dark over where
the jungle is. We'll pretend there isn't any cage there, and soon
as I get him fortygraphed, I'll holler, 'Shoot, men!' Then you
must shoot, Sam&mdash;and Herman, you and Verman must hammer on the
cage with your spears, and holler: 'Hoo! Hoo!' and pretend you're
spearin' him."</p>

<p>"Well, we aw ready!" said Herman. "Hoo! Hoo!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Penrod interposed, frowningly surveying the
cage. "I got to squat too much to get my camera fixed right."
He assumed various solemn poses, to be interpreted as those of
a photographer studying his subject. "No," he said finally; "it
won't take good that way."</p>

<p>"My gootness!" Herman exclaimed. "When we goin' begin 'at beatin'?"</p>

<p>"Here!" Apparently Penrod had solved a weighty problem. "Bring
that busted ole kitchen chair, and set the panther up on it. There!
<em>THAT'S </em>the ticket! This way, it'll make a mighty good
pitcher!" He turned to Sam importantly. "Well, Jim, is the chief
and all his beaters here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bill; all here," Sam responded, with an air of loyalty.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I guess we're ready," said Penrod, in his deepest
voice. "Beat, men."</p>

<p>Herman and Verman were anxious to beat. They set up the loudest
uproar of which they were capable. "Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!" they bellowed,
flailing the branches with their spears and stamping heavily upon
the floor. Sam, carried away by the elan of the performance, was
unable to resist joining them. "Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!" he shouted. "Hoo!
Hoo! Hoo!" And as the dust rose from the floor to their stamping,
the three of them produced such a din and hoo-hooing as could
be made by nothing on earth except boys.</p>

<p>"Back, men!" Penrod called, raising his voice to the utmost.
"Back for your lives. The <em>PA-A-ANTHER! </em>Now I'm takin'
his pitcher. Click, click! Shoot, men; shoot!"</p>

<p>"Bing! Bing!" shouted Sam, levelling his gun at the cage, while
Herman and Verman hammered upon it, and Gipsy cursed boys, the
world and the day he was born. "Bing! Bing! Bing!"</p>

<p>"You missed him!" screamed Penrod. "Give me that gun!" And snatching
it from Sam's unwilling hand, he levelled it at the cage.</p>

<p>"<em>BING!" </em>he roared.</p>

<p>Simultaneously there was the sound of another report; but this
was an actual one and may best be symbolized by the statement
that it was a whack. The recipient was Herman, and, outrageously
surprised and pained, he turned to find himself face to face with
a heavily built coloured woman who had recently ascended the stairs
and approached the preoccupied hunters from the rear. In her hand
was a lath, and, even as Herman turned, it was again wielded,
this time upon Verman.</p>

<p>"<em>MAMMY</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes; you bettuh holler, 'Mammy!"' she panted. "My goo'ness,
if yo' pappy don' lam you to-night! Ain' you got no mo' sense
'an to let white boys 'suede you play you Affikin heathums? Whah
you britches?"</p>

<p>"Yonnuh Verman's," quavered Herman.</p>

<p>"Whah y'own?"</p>

<p>Choking, Herman answered bravely:</p>

<p>"'At ole cat tuck an' th'owed 'em down cistern!"</p>

<p>Exasperated almost beyond endurance, she lifted the lath again.
But unfortunately, in order to obtain a better field of action,
she moved backward a little, coming in contact with the bars of
the cage, a circumstance that she overlooked. More unfortunately
still, the longing of the captive to express his feelings was
such that he would have welcomed the opportunity to attack an
elephant. He had been striking and scratching at inanimate things
and at boys out of reach for the past hour; but here at last was
his opportunity. He made the most of it.</p>

<p>"I learn you tell me cat th'owed &mdash;<em>OOOOH</em>!"</p>

<p>The coloured woman leaped into the air like an athlete, and,
turning with a swiftness astounding in one of her weight, beheld
the semaphoric arm of Gipsy again extended between the bars and
hopefully reaching for her. Beside herself, she lifted her right
foot briskly from the ground, and allowed the sole of her shoe
to come in contact with Gipsy's cage.</p>

<p>The cage moved from the tottering chair beneath it. It passed
through the yawning hay-door and fell resoundingly to the alley
below, where&mdash;as Penrod and Sam, with cries of dismay, rushed
to the door and looked down&mdash;it burst asunder and disgorged a
large, bruised and chastened cat. Gipsy paused and bent one strange
look upon the broken box. Then he shook his head and departed
up the alley, the two boys watching him till he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Before they turned, a harrowing procession issued from the carriage-house
doors beneath them. Herman came first, hurriedly completing a
temporary security in Verman's trousers. Verman followed, after
a little reluctance that departed coincidentally with some inspiriting
words from the rear. He crossed the alley hastily, and his Mammy
stalked behind, using constant eloquence and a frequent lath.
They went into the small house across the way and closed the door.</p>

<p>Then Sam turned to Penrod.</p>

<p>"Penrod," he said thoughtfully, "was it on account of fortygraphing
in the jungle you wanted to keep that cat?"</p>

<p>"No; that was a mighty fine-blooded cat. We'd of made some money."</p>

<p>Sam jeered.</p>

<p>"You mean when we'd sell tickets to look at it in its cage?"</p>

<p>Penrod shook his head, and if Gipsy could have overheard and
understood his reply, that atrabilious spirit, almost broken by
the events of the day, might have considered this last blow the
most overwhelming of all.</p>

<p>"No," said Penrod; "when she had kittens."</p>
