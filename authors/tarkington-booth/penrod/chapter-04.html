<p>The Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom behind
the stage&mdash;a room crowded with excited children, all about equally
medieval and artistic. Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought
himself, but he was so preoccupied with his own shame, steeling
his nerves to meet the first inevitable taunting reference to
his sister's stockings, that he failed to perceive there were
others present in much of his own unmanned condition. Retiring
to a corner, immediately upon his entrance, he managed to unfasten
the mantle at the shoulders, and, drawing it round him, pinned
it again at his throat so that it concealed the rest of his costume.
This permitted a temporary relief, but increased his horror of
the moment when, in pursuance of the action of the "pageant," 
the sheltering garment must be cast aside.</p>

<p>Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles
close about them. A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant
fabrics from their shoulders, airily, showing off hired splendours
from a professional costumer's stock, while one or two were insulting
examples of parental indulgence, particularly little Maurice Levy,
the Child Sir Galahad. This shrinking person went clamorously
about, making it known everywhere that the best tailor in town
had been dazzled by a great sum into constructing his costume.
It consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers, a white satin waistcoat,
and a beautifully cut little swallow-tailed coat with pearl buttons.
The medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle of
yellow velvet, and little white boots, sporting gold tassels.</p>

<p>All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed
the Child Sir Lancelot, gathering an immediately formed semicircular
audience of little girls. Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence.</p>

<p>"What <em>YOU </em>got on?" inquired Mr. Levy, after dispensing
information. "What you got on under that ole golf cape?"</p>

<p>Penrod looked upon him coldly. At other times his questioner
would have approached him with deference, even with apprehension.
But to-day the Child Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with
the power of his own beauty.</p>

<p>"What <em>YOU </em>got on?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," said Penrod, with an indifference assumed at great
cost to his nervous system.</p>

<p>The elate Maurice was inspired to set up as a wit. "Then you're
nakid!"  he shouted exultantly. "Penrod Schofield says he hasn't
got nothin' on under that ole golf cape! He's nakid! He's nakid."</p>

<p>The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly, and a javelin
pierced the inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine,
amber-curled and beautiful Marjorie Jones, lifted golden laughter
to the horrid jest.</p>

<p>Other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar. "He's nakid,
he's nakid!" shrieked the Child Sir Galahad. "Penrod Schofield's
nakid! He's <em>NA-A-A-KID</em>!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" said Mrs. Lora Rewbush, pushing her way into the
group. "Remember, we are all little knights and ladies to-day.
Little knights and ladies of the Table Round would not make so
much noise. Now children, we must begin to take our places on
the stage. Is everybody here?"</p>

<p>Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion: he slid
behind Mrs. Lora Rewbush, and being near a door, opened it unnoticed
and went out quickly, closing it behind him. He found himself
in a narrow and vacant hallway which led to a door marked "Janitor's
Room."</p>

<p>Burning with outrage, heart-sick at the sweet, cold-blooded laughter
of Marjorie Jones, Penrod rested his elbows upon a window-sill
and speculated upon the effects of a leap from the second story.
One of the reasons he gave it up was his desire to live on Maurice
Levy's account: already he was forming educational plans for the
Child Sir Galahad.</p>

<p>A stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering
to himself petulantly. "I reckon they'll find that hall hot enough
<em>NOW!" </em>he said, conveying to Penrod an impression that
some too feminine women had sent him upon an unreasonable errand
to the furnace. He went into the Janitor's Room and, emerging
a moment later, minus the overalls, passed Penrod again with a
bass rumble&mdash;"Dern 'em!" it seemed he said&mdash;and made a gloomy
exit by the door at the upper end of the hallway.</p>

<p>The conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large, mannerly audience
was heard as the janitor opened and closed the door; and stage-fright
seized the boy. The orchestra began an overture, and, at that,
Penrod, trembling violently, tiptoed down the hall into the Janitor's
Room. It was a cul-de-sac: There was no outlet save by the way
he had come.</p>

<p>Despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself
for a last sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously
and disgracefully Margaret's as they had seemed in the mirror
at home. For a moment he was encouraged: perhaps he was no worse
than some of the other boys. Then he noticed that a safety-pin
had opened; one of those connecting the stockings with his trunks.
He sat down to fasten it and his eye fell for the first time with
particular attention upon the trunks. Until this instant he had
been preoccupied with the stockings.</p>

<p>Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes.</p>

<p>The Schofields' house stood on a corner at the intersection of
two main-travelled streets; the fence was low, and the publicity
obtained by the washable portion of the family apparel, on Mondays,
had often been painful to Penrod; for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness
in these matters. A plain, matter-of-fact washerwoman' employed
by Mrs. Schofield, never left anything to the imagination of the
passer-by; and of all her calm display the scarlet flaunting of
his father's winter wear had most abashed Penrod. One day Marjorie
Jones, all gold and starch, had passed when the dreadful things
were on the line: Penrod had hidden himself, shuddering. The whole
town, he was convinced, knew these garments intimately and derisively.</p>

<p>And now, as he sat in the janitor's chair, the horrible and paralyzing
recognition came. He had not an instant's doubt that every fellow
actor, as well as every soul in the audience, would recognize
what his mother and sister had put upon him. For as the awful
truth became plain to himself it seemed blazoned to the world;
and far, far louder than the stockings, the trunks did fairly
bellow the grisly secret: <em>WHOSE </em>they were and <em>WHAT
</em>they were!</p>

<p>Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding
themselves very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed
people, and such dreamers' sensations are comparable to Penrod's,
though faintly, because Penrod was awake and in much too full
possession of the most active capacities for anguish.</p>

<p>A human male whose dress has been damaged, or reveals some vital
lack, suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes
every second absolutely unbearable until he is again as others
of his sex and species; and there is no act or sin whatever too
desperate for him in his struggle to attain that condition. Also,
there is absolutely no embarrassment possible to a woman which
is comparable to that of a man under corresponding circumstances
and in this a boy is a man. Gazing upon the ghastly trunks, the
stricken Penrod felt that he was a degree worse then nude; and
a great horror of himself filled his soul.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!"</p>

<p>The door into the hallway opened, and a voice demanded him. He
could not be seen from the hallway, but the hue and the cry was
up; and he knew he must be taken. It was only a question of seconds.
He huddled in his chair.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!" cried Mrs. Lora Rewbush angrily.</p>

<p>The distracted boy rose and, as he did so, a long pin sank deep
into his back. He extracted it frenziedly, which brought to his
ears a protracted and sonorous ripping, too easily located by
a final gesture of horror.</p>

<p>"Penrod Schofield!" Mrs. Lora Rewbush had come out into the hallway.</p>

<p>And now, in this extremity, when all seemed lost indeed, particularly
including honour, the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the
blue overalls which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg.</p>

<p>Inspiration and action were almost simultaneous.</p>
