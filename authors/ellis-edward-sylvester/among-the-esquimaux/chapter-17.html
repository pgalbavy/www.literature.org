<p>"By the great horned spoon, I suspected it! Docak, I'm mighty
glad to see you; I'm Jack Cosgrove, and put it there!"</p>

<p>The native was not so demonstrative as his English friend, but
he certainly was as delighted and surprised to meet him in this
extraordinary manner as was the sailor to meet him.</p>

<p>They shook hands heartily, and Docak indulged in his peculiar
laugh, which was accompanied by little, if any noise, but was
indicative of genuine pleasure.</p>

<p>The reader will recall that this was the second time Docak had
rescued Jack Cosgrove, the other instance having occurred a number
of years before, when Captain McAlpine's ship was destroyed by
collision with an iceberg.</p>

<p>"You're my guardian angel!" was the exclamation of the happy
sailor; "I might have known that if anybody was to save us you
was the chap to do it. Come up here, boys, and shake hands with
Docak ag'in, for he's one of the best fellows living."</p>

<p>Rob and Fred were only too glad to do as invited, and cordial
relations were at once established.</p>

<p>"Is your home where it was when I was here last?" Jack asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, off dere," replied Docak, turning about and pointing inland;
"not far&mdash;soon get dere."</p>

<p>Jack gave a low whistle expressive of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," he said, addressing the youths, "I rather think
you'll own that Jack Cosgrove knows a thing or two about icebergs."</p>

<p>"I think Fred and I have also learned something, but what are
you driving at?"</p>

<p>"We're well up toward Davis Strait, and there's more than a hundred
miles of Greenland coast to the south of us. That old berg has
struck a bee line for the North Pole, but it won't reach there,
eh, Docak?"</p>

<p>"No; soon turn around&mdash;go back."</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that one of the strangest things you ever heard of,
lads? The place where the 'Mary Jane' went down, afore that berg,
three years ago, was mighty nigh the very spot where Docak found
us. I remember he brought us ashore in his kayak&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dis same boat," interrupted the native with a grin, perceptible
in the twilight.</p>

<p>"There you are, and, if he keeps on, I'll begin to think that
one of you chaps is Captain McAlpine himself, and the other Bill
Hardin, who was saved with us."</p>

<p>"It is a most remarkable coincidence," said Fred, and Rob added
that he had never read or heard anything like it.</p>

<p>But it occurred to Docak that he was not acting the part of hospitable
host, by keeping his friends standing on the edge of the sea,
while the reminiscences went on. He stooped and drew his boat
far up the bank. The tide was at its height, so there was no fear
of its playing the trick our friends had suffered. Then he turned
about and started inland, the others following in Indian file.</p>

<p>He was treading a path, a foot or more deep in the snow, and
worn as hard as a rock. The ascent was gentle, and a hundred yards
from the shore he arrived at the entrance to his home, where a
surprise awaited the boys.</p>

<p>When seen for the first time the hut of the Esquimaux suggest
the sod houses common on the Western plains of our country, except
that the homes of the far North are entered by means of a burrow.
Where such frightful cold reigns for months every year the first
consideration with the native is to secure protection against
it; everything is sacrificed to that.</p>

<p>The walls are of alternate layers of stone and sod, and are about
three feet in thickness. The highest clear space within is from
four to five feet. The building contains an entry-way, a kitchen,
and a living room. The entry is four or five yards in length,
two feet or less wide, and no more than a yard in height. It will
thus be seen that even a small boy would have to stoop to pass
through it, while the interior of the hut itself will not allow
a full-grown Esquimau to stand erect. To this fact may be attributed
in some degree the stoop shoulders so common among the men.</p>

<p>Half-way between the beginning of the entry and the main rooms
was an opening leading to the kitchen. This was small, shaped
like a bee-hive, and with a hole at the apex for the escape of
the smoke. The floor was bare ground, the hearth consisting of
a number of stones placed close together, on which the iron kettles
sat, while the fire of driftwood burned beneath. The height of
the kitchen is less than that of the main room, so that only the
women can stand erect in the highest portion.</p>

<p>When the weather is very severe the cooking is done in the main
room, by means of the big oil-lamp, while the thick walls and
the heavy furs of the inmates enable them to laugh at the raging
blizzard outside.</p>

<p>It was along such a passage as the one described that Docak led
the way, followed by Jack Cosgrove, Rob, and Fred, each trailing
his rifle, and happy beyond measure that everything with them
had turned out so well.</p>

<p>The main room into which the little party entered was about four
yards square. It had a board floor and a ceiling&mdash;luxuries not
generally found in the native homes except in the settlements.
The walls were furred off and ceiled, and the spaces closely stuffed
with moss. The wall on the right of the main room had a single
window with twelve panes of glass.</p>

<p>The main room was the most interesting part of the structure.
Along the front of the window ran a wooden bench, near the end
of which, toward the entrance, stood a Danish stove. In the corner
beyond the other end of the bench was a table. To the left of
that was the lamp-stand, directly opposite to which on the other
side of the room was a second and shorter bench.</p>

<p>The whole left-hand side of the room, as you entered, consisted
of a platform, about six feet long. It was elevated a foot above
the floor, the side next to the wall being a few inches higher.
At night it was covered with feather beds, which are rolled back
during the day, so that the front may be used for other purposes.
The lamp used in the Esquimau houses is simply a large, green
stone, with a hollow scooped in the top. This contains seal oil,
a piece of moss serving as a wick.</p>

<p>It may be well to tell you something in this place about the
dress of the Esquimaux, referring now to those who live near the
settlements, most of whom are of mixed blood. In the interior,
and, along the east coast of Greenland, are met the wild natives,
who are muffled in the thickest furs, and bear little resemblance
to the class to which Docak and his acquaintances belonged.</p>

<p>These men wore jackets, trousers, moccasins, and generally undershirts,
drawers, and socks. The rule is for them to go bareheaded, though
a hat or cap is frequently seen. The clothing, except the moccasins,
is made from woolen or cotton stuff, bought off the Danish Governor.</p>

<p>The jacket is of gingham, with sleeves and a hood that can be
drawn over the head, and fitted in place by drawing and tying
a string that passes under the chin. When venturing out in his
kayak, or in severe weather, Docak, like most of his friends,
wore a jacket and hood combined. This was of sealskin, with the
leather side out. The trousers are constructed of the same material
with the hair out. Sometimes they are lined with sealskin, with
the hair in.</p>

<p>The moccasins are well-shaped sealskin boots, reaching nearly
to the knees. When the socks are not woolen, the hair is turned
toward the skin. The mittens are of seal leather, with no hair
on either side, and are much inferior to many of our own country,
for purposes of warmth and comfort.</p>

<p>The Esquimau women are shorter of stature than the men, and walk
with short, mincing steps, showing a stoop similar to their husbands.
They have small hands and feet, with faces that any one would
pronounce good looking. They comb their hair to an apex, which,
if the woman is married, is tied with a blue ribbon; if a widow,
with black; and if a maiden, with green.</p>

<p>The females generally wear collars of beads, with lace-work patterns
and vivid colors. The waist is generally of woolen stuff, and
here the same fondness for bright colors displays itself. It has
no buttons, and is donned and doffed by passing over the head,
and is fastened at the waist with a belt. Then come a pair of
short trousers of sealskin, which are tastefully ornamented. Below
these are the long-legged moccasins, also ornamented by the deft
handiwork of the native owners. The dress of the children is the
same as the parents.</p>
