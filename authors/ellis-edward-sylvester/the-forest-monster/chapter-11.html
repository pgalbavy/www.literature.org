<p>There was an interested and anxious group gathered around the
trappers’ camp-fire, on the evening succeeding the adventures
we have narrated.</p>

<p>The three were together, and they had taken all necessary precautions
against danger from the Indians. The entrance to their underground
house had been securely closed by means of an immense boulder,
that was only shoved into position by means of their united strength,
and the fire was kindled so far back that there was no danger
of its being discovered by any one, not even by looking down the
rent through which the smoke found its way out of the cavern.</p>

<p>The night was quite cool, and they had an abundance of fuel,
so that every provision had been made for their comfort. They
had eaten supper, too, although neither of the three had much
appetite for it.</p>

<p>They were smoking, and, as a matter of course, discussing the
all-absorbing topic of the day. Black Tom was the first to display
his nugget with a triumphant air, which changed somewhat when
old Stebbins produced a still larger one, and Teddy began to disgorge
from what seemed his inexhaustible pocket.</p>

<p>The entire wealth was emptied into a heap, where the firelight
shone full upon it. The three contemplated it a few moments, and
then removing his pipe, Tom grinned and asked:</p>

<p>"How many skins and peltries would we have to take into St. Louey
to raise that amount of specie?"</p>

<p>"Several years work," replied his elder companion.</p>

<p>"Don’t it look purty?" asked Teddy, who was stretched full upon
his face, his fists placed one above the other, while his chin
rested on the uppermost. "Begorra, there ain’t any thing this
side of ould Ireland that would do me eyes more good. What is
it worth?"</p>

<p>This was the question all three had been turning over in their
minds for some time, and each gave the result of his conjecture.</p>

<p>"I kin hit it purty near," said Teddy, who was squinting at it
as though it were a target for his rifle. "I was always good at
guessin’."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>"Five hundred and fifty-four millions, six hundred and ninety-three
pounds starling, more or less."</p>

<p>The Irishman was in earnest, and it was a long time before he
could be made to believe that he had not gathered in more than
five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"It’ll foot up that, any way," said old Stebbins; "and if we
kin keep that up for a few days, it’ll answer."</p>

<p>"You’re sartin thar’s plenty more thar?" asked Black Tom, looking
toward the Irishman.</p>

<p>"Sartin!" he exclaimed, in amazement; "it’s all over! There’s
tons of it; there’s enough to make mesilf, and all me grandfathers
and grandmothers, as rich as Queen Victoria, away back to the
latest ginerations of posterity."</p>

<p>"You’re crazy over it," replied Tom; "thar ain’t half what you
say thar is."</p>

<p>"Yees jist go wid me to-morrer, and saa fur yersilf."</p>

<p>"That’s what I will do, ef the infarnal red-skins don’t get too
thick."</p>

<p>"Or the beast," suggested old Stebbins.</p>

<p>"Be jabers! but we saad nothing of him," said Teddy, who had
scarcely thought of the strange animal up to this moment.</p>

<p>"I don’t think <em>he’ll</em> bother us, ef we look out fur him;
but what were them consarned Blackfeet doin’ in thar?"</p>

<p>It was all-important that they should not overlook the personal
danger involved in this matter. The encounter of Teddy O’Doherty
with the Indians proved beyond all doubt that such a peril existed.</p>

<p>Much speculation and conjecture now followed. It was probable
that the Indians had known of the existence of this gold mine
for some time, and no doubt they had turned it to good account.</p>

<p>One of those nuggets, flecked and imbedded through and through
with the pure gold, would purchase many necessaries and luxuries
for whatever red-skin chose to carry it to a trading or frontier
post. It could be easily manufactured into the rude trinkets so
prized by all native Americans.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it might be considered certain that the
property would be disputed. Had old Stebbins been given the opportunity
to finish, not one, but both the Blackfeet, their disappearance
undoubtedly would be laid to the terrible "ringed and streaked"
creature that was dreaded by white and red-men alike.</p>

<p>But the prize was worth fighting for, and the three men were
ready and willing to risk their lives for the purpose of securing
what they had labored so hard for during the many long years of
the past.</p>

<p>Teddy proposed that they should visit the cave during the night,
when there was little fear of their being molested, but the other
two were reluctant to make the attempt in the dark.</p>

<p>The Irishman still urged his point with a vehemence that bid
fair to carry the day, when a noise at the entrance silenced every
tongue.</p>

<p>"Hello in there! can you give a traveler lodging for the night?"</p>

<p>The voice was recognized as that of Fred Hammond, and all three
instantly sprung to their feet and hurried to the entrance to
admit him. He was regarded with strong friendship by all, from
the unmistakable good will he had manifested toward them from
the beginning.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he joined them round the camp-fire, and seemed
in the best of spirits. Teddy had placed his nuggets, with no
little precipitation, out of sight when Hammond’s voice was first
heard, so that he saw nothing of the real cause of their conversation.</p>

<p>Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed, when it was palpable to each
of the three trappers that Hammond had been drawn to their retreat
by some extraordinary reason, which would be speedily made known.</p>

<p>Hammond was so well-bred, and so thoroughly self-possessed, that
he made an easy master of what would have been almost insuperable
to another, and gracefully and in good terms he came to the point.</p>

<p>"Friends," said he, looking round in their faces with a smile,
"you are hunters and trappers by profession, but you came here
in search of gold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And found it," interrupted Black Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know you stumbled upon a nice little nugget, and doubtless
you all believe there is plenty more of it in this section."</p>

<p>"Yis," answered Teddy, with a significance which the speaker
did not get.</p>

<p>"Well, you are right," added Hammond, with great earnestness;
"there is enough gold within your reach to make you all rich,
and I have come here on purpose to show you where to find it."</p>

<p>He paused and looked at them, and they at each other, but never
a syllable was uttered.</p>

<p>"Now," he resumed, "it may seem that I am not entirely unselfish
in this matter. There is a young lady among the Indian tribe near
at hand, who has consented to accompany me home, and to become
my wife. It was not <em>gold</em> that brought <em>me</em> here&mdash;it
was <em>she</em>; and," said Hammond, his face aglow with pleasure,
"I have obtained her. Well, we are to start eastward, on our horses,
never to return here. You know, as well as I, the dangers that
beset such a journey, and it’s for that reason I wish your company."</p>

<p>"But how kin we go without the spondulicks?" asked Black Tom.</p>

<p>"I don’t wish you to do so, and therefore I am going to put you
in the way of obtaining all the wealth you want in a few hours."</p>

<p>"Would you have told us ef it hadn’t been you wanted us to take
care of yerself and gal?" asked old Stebbins, with considerable
bluntness.</p>

<p>"It is not I that wish to be protected and taken care of, but
Lamora, the lady who accompanies me; but I will answer your question.
When I first saw you in this vicinity and suspected what you were
after, I had not the remotest idea of imparting to you the secret
I had obtained from my lady; but, when I had seen enough of you
to believe that you were honest men, and deserving of better success,
I suggested to Lamora that we should put you in the way of instantly
acquiring that for which you were so anxiously searching, and
she gave me permission, without a moment’s hesitation, to do so."</p>

<p>"That makes it all right," said Black Tom, much pleased with
the frankness of their visitor; "we’ll shake hands on that."</p>

<p>"Yis; that makes things plisent, as me cousin obsarved, whin
he and his gal broke their shillalehs over aich ither’s heads."</p>

<p>"I exact only one condition," said Hammond, "and that is that
you will each and all give me your promise to keep this matter
a secret. It has been long known to the friendly Indians near
at hand, and to some of the Blackfeet, and it is worth a great
deal to them, while, if it should become generally known among
the hunters and trappers, you know this place would be overrun
with lawless men, and the Meagans would be compelled to leave
the home which they hope to keep for the remainder of their lives."</p>

<p>The promise was readily given by all, and then Hammond proceeded
to explain with great minuteness the very cavern which Teddy O’Doherty
had explored. The three listened, until he had finished, and then
the Irishman astounded Hammond, by remarking, with his peculiar
chuckle:</p>

<p>"We’re obleeged to you, Misther Hammond, <em>but we’ve already
been thar</em>!"</p>
