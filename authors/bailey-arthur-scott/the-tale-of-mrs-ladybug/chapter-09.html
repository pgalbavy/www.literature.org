<p>MR. P. BUG'S statement amazed Mrs. Ladybug. He said he had never been in
Colorado. More than that, he declared he didn't even know where the
place was.
</p>
<p>Now, Peppery Polly Bumblebee had told Mrs. Ladybug that Mr. P. Bug was
no stranger in Pleasant Valley. But Mrs. Ladybug had not believed what
she said. Even hearing Mr. Bug's own words, Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help
doubting them.
</p><p>"Can it be true--" she asked him--"can it be true that you've never been
off this farm?"
</p><p>Mr. Bug quite plainly wished that she would go away and stop bothering
him.
</p><p>"It can be--it <u>is</u> true," he replied carelessly.
</p><p>At last Mrs. Ladybug had to believe what she heard.
</p><p>"Then you're a fraud!" she cried. '"You're a cheat! For I read on your
carpetbag, when we met in the orchard, 'P. Bug. Colorado.'"
</p><p>"Oh!" said Mr. Bug with a smile. "Oh! So <u>that's</u> where you got your odd
notion. I wondered how you happened to make such a mistake."
</p><p>"A perfectly natural mistake, I'm sure!" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed
indignantly.
</p><p>"Well, I dare say it is," he admitted. "But you see, that's not my
carpetbag. At least, I didn't get it new. It belonged to my
great-great-great-grandfather. Indeed, I'm not sure he wasn't even
still greater than I've said. <u>He</u> lived in Colorado once--so I've been
told. But I was born and raised on this farm."
</p><p>"If all this is true," said Mrs. Ladybug, "what were you doing with that
carpetbag? And why did you ask me the way to this potato patch?"
</p><p>"I'm in a hurry to get to work," Mr. Bug remarked. "I'll answer just
this once. When we met in the orchard I had been away on a little
vacation. And Farmer Green's potato patch--so I learned--had been moved
since last year."
</p><p>"Dear me!" Mrs. Ladybug wailed. "People will laugh at me for having made
such a serious mistake."
</p><p>But Mr. P. Bug didn't say anything about that.
</p><p>"Good-by!" he grunted. And he crawled under a leaf, out of sight.
</p><p>For once in her life Mrs. Ladybug wasn't eager to talk to her neighbors.
On the contrary, she seemed to avoid them. But Peppery Polly Bumblebee
called on her and asked her if she had seen the handsome stranger, Mr.
P. Bug.
</p><p>"Yes!" said Mrs. Ladybug. "I've talked with him. And it's true that he
has always lived here. There was a slight mistake about his carpetbag.
It belonged to one of his ancestors. And since it bears his ancestor's
name and address, naturally I thought they both belonged to this Mr.
Bug."
</p><p>Peppery Polly laughed.
</p><p>"If you don't believe what I tell you, you can ask him yourself!" Mrs.
Ladybug snapped. "He's at work over in the potato patch, helping Farmer
Green."
</p><p>Peppery Polly laughed again, more unpleasantly than ever.
</p><p>"<u>Helping</u> Farmer Green!" she exclaimed. "He's eating the leaves off the
vines as fast as he can. I know that gentleman. He's Mr. Potato Bug. And
he's one of the greatest pests on the farm."
