<p>DEDICATION TO THE DUKE OF BEJAR, MARQUIS OF GIBRALEON, COUNT OF BENALCAZAR
AND BANARES, VICECOUNT OF THE PUEBLA DE ALCOCER, MASTER OF THE
TOWNS OF CAPILLA, CURIEL AND BURGUILLOS</p>

<p>In belief of the good reception and honours that Your Excellency
bestows on all sort of books, as prince so inclined to favor good
arts, chiefly those who by their nobleness do not submit to the
service and bribery of the vulgar, I have determined bringing
to light The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of la Mancha, in
shelter of Your Excellency’s glamorous name, to whom, with the
obeisance I owe to such grandeur, I pray to receive it agreeably
under his protection, so that in this shadow, though deprived
of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe
the works composed in the houses of those who know, it dares appear
with assurance in the judgment of some who, trespassing the bounds
of their own ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less
justice the writings of others. It is my earnest hope that Your
Excellency’s good counsel in regard to my honourable purpose,
will not disdain the littleness of so humble a service.</p>

<p>Miguel de Cervantes</p>
