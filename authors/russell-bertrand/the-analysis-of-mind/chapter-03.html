<p>Desire is a subject upon which, if I am not mistaken, true views
can only be arrived at by an almost complete reversal of the ordinary
unreflecting opinion. It is natural to regard desire as in its
essence an attitude towards something which is imagined, not actual;
this something is called the <em>END </em>or <em>OBJECT </em>of
the desire, and is said to be the <em>PURPOSE </em>of any action
resulting from the desire. We think of the content of the desire
as being just like the content of a belief, while the attitude
taken up towards the content is different. According to this theory,
when we say: "I hope it will rain," or "I expect it will rain,"
we express, in the first case, a desire, and in the second, a
belief, with an identical content, namely, the image of rain.
It would be easy to say that, just as belief is one kind of feeling
in relation to this content, so desire is another kind. According
to this view, what comes first in desire is something imagined,
with a specific feeling related to it, namely, that specific feeling
which we call "desiring" it. The discomfort associated with unsatisfied
desire, and the actions which aim at satisfying desire, are, in
this view, both of them effects of the desire. I think it is fair
to say that this is a view against which common sense would not
rebel; nevertheless, I believe it to be radically mistaken. It
cannot be refuted logically, but various facts can be adduced
which make it gradually less simple and plausible, until at last
it turns out to be easier to abandon it wholly and look at the
matter in a totally different way.</p>

<p>The first set of facts to be adduced against the common sense
view of desire are those studied by psycho-analysis. In all human
beings, but most markedly in those suffering from hysteria and
certain forms of insanity, we find what are called "unconscious"
desires, which are commonly regarded as showing self-deception.
Most psycho-analysts pay little attention to the analysis of desire,
being interested in discovering by observation what it is that
people desire, rather than in discovering what actually constitutes
desire. I think the strangeness of what they report would be greatly
diminished if it were expressed in the language of a behaviourist
theory of desire, rather than in the language of every-day beliefs.
The general description of the sort of phenomena that bear on
our present question is as follows: A person states that his desires
are so-and-so, and that it is these desires that inspire his actions;
but the outside observer perceives that his actions are such as
to realize quite different ends from those which he avows, and
that these different ends are such as he might be expected to
desire. Generally they are less virtuous than his professed desires,
and are therefore less agreeable to profess than these are. It
is accordingly supposed that they really exist as desires for
ends, but in a subconscious part of the mind, which the patient
refuses to admit into consciousness for fear of having to think
ill of himself. There are no doubt many cases to which such a
supposition is applicable without obvious artificiality. But the
deeper the Freudians delve into the underground regions of instinct,
the further they travel from anything resembling conscious desire,
and the less possible it becomes to believe that only positive
self-deception conceals from us that we really wish for things
which are abhorrent to our explicit life.</p>

<p>In the cases in question we have a conflict between the outside
observer and the patient's consciousness. The whole tendency of
psycho-analysis is to trust the outside observer rather than the
testimony of introspection. I believe this tendency to be entirely
right, but to demand a re-statement of what constitutes desire,
exhibiting it as a causal law of our actions, not as something
actually existing in our minds.</p>

<p>But let us first get a clearer statement of the essential characteristic
of the phenomena.</p>

<p>A person, we find, states that he desires a certain end A, and
that he is acting with a view to achieving it. We observe, however,
that his actions are such as are likely to achieve a quite different
end B, and that B is the sort of end that often seems to be aimed
at by animals and savages, though civilized people are supposed
to have discarded it. We sometimes find also a whole set of false
beliefs, of such a kind as to persuade the patient that his actions
are really a means to A, when in fact they are a means to B. For
example, we have an impulse to inflict pain upon those whom we
hate; we therefore believe that they are wicked, and that punishment
will reform them. This belief enables us to act upon the impulse
to inflict pain, while believing that we are acting upon the desire
to lead sinners to repentance. It is for this reason that the
criminal law has been in all ages more severe than it would have
been if the impulse to ameliorate the criminal had been what really
inspired it. It seems simple to explain such a state of affairs
as due to "self-deception," but this explanation is often mythical.
Most people, in thinking about punishment, have had no more need
to hide their vindictive impulses from themselves than they have
had to hide the exponential theorem. Our impulses are not patent
to a casual observation, but are only to be discovered by a scientific
study of our actions, in the course of which we must regard ourselves
as objectively as we should the motions of the planets or the
chemical reactions of a new element.</p>

<p>The study of animals reinforces this conclusion, and is in many
ways the best preparation for the analysis of desire. In animals
we are not troubled by the disturbing influence of ethical considerations.
In dealing with human beings, we are perpetually distracted by
being told that such-and-such a view is gloomy or cynical or pessimistic:
ages of human conceit have built up such a vast myth as to our
wisdom and virtue that any intrusion of the mere scientific desire
to know the facts is instantly resented by those who cling to
comfortable illusions. But no one cares whether animals are virtuous
or not, and no one is under the delusion that they are rational.
Moreover, we do not expect them to be so "conscious," and are
prepared to admit that their instincts prompt useful actions without
any prevision of the ends which they achieve. For all these reasons,
there is much in the analysis of mind which is more easily discovered
by the study of animals than by the observation of human beings.</p>

<p>We all think that, by watching the behaviour of animals, we can
discover more or less what they desire. If this is the case&mdash;and
I fully agree that it is&mdash;desire must be capable of being exhibited
in actions, for it is only the actions of animals that we can
observe. They <em>MAY </em>have minds in which all sorts of things
take place, but we can know nothing about their minds except by
means of inferences from their actions; and the more such inferences
are examined, the more dubious they appear. It would seem, therefore,
that actions alone must be the test of the desires of animals.
From this it is an easy step to the conclusion that an animal's
desire is nothing but a characteristic of a certain series of
actions, namely, those which would be commonly regarded as inspired
by the desire in question. And when it has been shown that this
view affords a satisfactory account of animal desires, it is not
difficult to see that the same explanation is applicable to the
desires of human beings.</p>

<p>We judge easily from the behaviour of an animal of a familiar
kind whether it is hungry or thirsty, or pleased or displeased,
or inquisitive or terrified. The verification of our judgment,
so far as verification is possible, must be derived from the immediately
succeeding actions of the animal. Most people would say that they
infer first something about the animal's state of mind&mdash;whether
it is hungry or thirsty and so on&mdash;and thence derive their expectations
as to its subsequent conduct. But this detour through the animal's
supposed mind is wholly unnecessary. We can say simply: The animal's
behaviour during the last minute has had those characteristics
which distinguish what is called "hunger," and it is likely that
its actions during the next minute will be similar in this respect,
unless it finds food, or is interrupted by a stronger impulse,
such as fear. An animal which is hungry is restless, it goes to
the places where food is often to be found, it sniffs with its
nose or peers with its eyes or otherwise increases the sensitiveness
of its sense-organs; as soon as it is near enough to food for
its sense-organs to be affected, it goes to it with all speed
and proceeds to eat; after which, if the quantity of food has
been sufficient, its whole demeanour changes it may very likely
lie down and go to sleep. These things and others like them are
observable phenomena distinguishing a hungry animal from one which
is not hungry. The characteristic mark by which we recognize a
series of actions which display hunger is not the animal's mental
state, which we cannot observe, but something in its bodily behaviour;
it is this observable trait in the bodily behaviour that I am
proposing to call "hunger," not some possibly mythical and certainly
unknowable ingredient of the animal's mind.</p>

<p>Generalizing what occurs in the case of hunger, we may say that
what we call a desire in an animal is always displayed in a cycle
of actions having certain fairly well marked characteristics.
There is first a state of activity, consisting, with qualifications
to be mentioned presently, of movements likely to have a certain
result; these movements, unless interrupted, continue until the
result is achieved, after which there is usually a period of comparative
quiescence. A cycle of actions of this sort has marks by which
it is broadly distinguished from the motions of dead matter. The
most notable of these marks are&mdash;(1) the appropriateness of the
actions for the realization of a certain result; (2) the continuance
of action until that result has been achieved. Neither of these
can be pressed beyond a point. Either may be (a) to some extent
present in dead matter, and (b) to a considerable extent absent
in animals, while vegetable are intermediate, and display only
a much fainter form of the behaviour which leads us to attribute
desire to animals. (a) One might say rivers "desire" the sea water,
roughly speaking, remains in restless motion until it reaches
either the sea or a place from which it cannot issue without going
uphill, and therefore we might say that this is what it wishes
while it is flowing. We do not say so, because we can account
for the behaviour of water by the laws of physics; and if we knew
more about animals, we might equally cease to attribute desires
to them, since we might find physical and chemical reactions sufficient
to account for their behaviour. (b) Many of the movements of animals
do not exhibit the characteristics of the cycles which seem to
embody desire. There are first of all the movements which are
"mechanical," such as slipping and falling, where ordinary physical
forces operate upon the animal's body almost as if it were dead
matter. An animal which falls over a cliff may make a number of
desperate struggles while it is in the air, but its centre of
gravity will move exactly as it would if the animal were dead.
In this case, if the animal is killed at the end of the fall,
we have, at first sight, just the characteristics of a cycle of
actions embodying desire, namely, restless movement until the
ground is reached, and then quiescence. Nevertheless, we feel
no temptation to say that the animal desired what occurred, partly
because of the obviously mechanical nature of the whole occurrence,
partly because, when an animal survives a fall, it tends not to
repeat the experience.</p>

<p>There may be other reasons also, but of them I do not wish to
speak yet. Besides mechanical movements, there are interrupted
movements, as when a bird, on its way to eat your best peas, is
frightened away by the boy whom you are employing for that purpose.
If interruptions are frequent and completion of cycles rare, the
characteristics by which cycles are observed may become so blurred
as to be almost unrecognizable. The result of these various considerations
is that the differences between animals and dead matter, when
we confine ourselves to external unscientific observation of integral
behaviour, are a matter of degree and not very precise. It is
for this reason that it has always been possible for fanciful
people to maintain that even stocks and stones have some vague
kind of soul. The evidence that animals have souls is so very
shaky that, if it is assumed to be conclusive, one might just
as well go a step further and extend the argument by analogy to
all matter. Nevertheless, in spite of vagueness and doubtful cases,
the existence of cycles in the behaviour of animals is a broad
characteristic by which they are prima facie distinguished from
ordinary matter; and I think it is this characteristic which leads
us to attribute desires to animals, since it makes their behaviour
resemble what we do when (as we say) we are acting from desire.</p>

<p>I shall adopt the following definitions for describing the behaviour
of animals:</p>

<p>A "behaviour-cycle" is a series of voluntary or reflex movements
of an animal, tending to cause a certain result, and continuing
until that result is caused, unless they are interrupted by death,
accident, or some new behaviour-cycle. (Here "accident" may be
defined as the intervention of purely physical laws causing mechanical
movements.)</p>

<p>The "purpose" of a behaviour-cycle is the result which brings
it to an end, normally by a condition of temporary quiescence-provided
there is no interruption.</p>

<p>An animal is said to "desire" the purpose of a behaviour cycle
while the behaviour-cycle is in progress.</p>

<p>I believe these definitions to be adequate also to human purposes
and desires, but for the present I am only occupied with animals
and with what can be learnt by external observation. I am very
anxious that no ideas should be attached to the words "purpose"
and "desire" beyond those involved in the above definitions.</p>

<p>We have not so far considered what is the nature of the initial
stimulus to a behaviour-cycle. Yet it is here that the usual view
of desire seems on the strongest ground. The hungry animal goes
on making movements until it gets food; it seems natural, therefore,
to suppose that the idea of food is present throughout the process,
and that the thought of the end to be achieved sets the whole
process in motion. Such a view, however, is obviously untenable
in many cases, especially where instinct is concerned. Take, for
example, reproduction and the rearing of the young. Birds mate,
build a nest, lay eggs in it, sit on the eggs, feed the young
birds, and care for them until they are fully grown. It is totally
impossible to suppose that this series of actions, which constitutes
one behaviour-cycle, is inspired by any prevision of the end,
at any rate the first time it is performed.* We must suppose that
the stimulus to the performance of each act is an impulsion from
behind, not an attraction from the future. The bird does what
it does, at each stage, because it has an impulse to that particular
action, not because it perceives that the whole cycle of actions
will contribute to the preservation of the species. The same considerations
apply to other instincts. A hungry animal feels restless, and
is led by instinctive impulses to perform the movements which
give it nourishment; but the act of seeking food is not sufficient
evidence from which to conclude that the animal has the thought
of food in its "mind."</p>

pp. 209, 210.

</p>
</div>
<p>Coming now to human beings, and to what we know about our own
actions, it seems clear that what, with us, sets a behaviour-cycle
in motion is some sensation of the sort which we call disagreeable.
Take the case of hunger: we have first an uncomfortable feeling
inside, producing a disinclination to sit still, a sensitiveness
to savoury smells, and an attraction towards any food that there
may be in our neighbourhood. At any moment during this process
we may become aware that we are hungry, in the sense of saying
to ourselves, "I am hungry"; but we may have been acting with
reference to food for some time before this moment. While we are
talking or reading, we may eat in complete unconsciousness; but
we perform the actions of eating just as we should if we were
conscious, and they cease when our hunger is appeased. What we
call "consciousness" seems to be a mere spectator of the process;
even when it issues orders, they are usually, like those of a
wise parent, just such as would have been obeyed even if they
had not been given. This view may seem at first exaggerated, but
the more our so-called volitions and their causes are examined,
the more it is forced upon us. The part played by words in all
this is complicated, and a potent source of confusions; I shall
return to it later. For the present, I am still concerned with
primitive desire, as it exists in man, but in the form in which
man shows his affinity to his animal ancestors.</p>

<p>Conscious desire is made up partly of what is essential to desire,
partly of beliefs as to what we want. It is important to be clear
as to the part which does not consist of beliefs.</p>

<p>The primitive non-cognitive element in desire seems to be a push,
not a pull, an impulsion away from the actual, rather than an
attraction towards the ideal. Certain sensations and other mental
occurrences have a property which we call discomfort; these cause
such bodily movements as are likely to lead to their cessation.
When the discomfort ceases, or even when it appreciably diminishes,
we have sensations possessing a property which we call <em>PLEASURE.
</em>Pleasurable sensations either stimulate no action at all,
or at most stimulate such action as is likely to prolong them.
I shall return shortly to the consideration of what discomfort
and pleasure are in themselves; for the present, it is their connection
with action and desire that concerns us. Abandoning momentarily
the standpoint of behaviourism, we may presume that hungry animals
experience sensations involving discomfort, and stimulating such
movements as seem likely to bring them to the food which is outside
the cages. When they have reached the food and eaten it, their
discomfort ceases and their sensations become pleasurable. It
<em>SEEMS, </em>mistakenly, as if the animals had had this situation
in mind throughout, when in fact they have been continually pushed
by discomfort. And when an animal is reflective, like some men,
it comes to think that it had the final situation in mind throughout;
sometimes it comes to know what situation will bring satisfaction,
so that in fact the discomfort does bring the thought of what
will allay it. Nevertheless the sensation involving discomfort
remains the prime mover.</p>

<p>This brings us to the question of the nature of discomfort and
pleasure. Since Kant it has been customary to recognize three
great divisions of mental phenomena, which are typified by knowledge,
desire and feeling, where "feeling" is used to mean pleasure and
discomfort. Of course, "knowledge" is too definite a word: the
states of mind concerned are grouped together as "cognitive,"
and are to embrace not only beliefs, but perceptions, doubts,
and the understanding of concepts. "Desire," also, is narrower
than what is intended: for example, <em>WILL </em>is to be included
in this category, and in fact every thing that involves any kind
of striving, or "conation" as it is technically called. I do not
myself believe that there is any value in this threefold division
of the contents of mind. I believe that sensations (including
images) supply all the "stuff" of the mind, and that everything
else can be analysed into groups of sensations related in various
ways, or characteristics of sensations or of groups of sensations.
As regards belief, I shall give grounds for this view in later
lectures. As regards desires, I have given some grounds in this
lecture. For the present, it is pleasure and discomfort that concern
us. There are broadly three theories that might be held in regard
to them. We may regard them as separate existing items in those
who experience them, or we may regard them as intrinsic qualities
of sensations and other mental occurrences, or we may regard them
as mere names for the causal characteristics of the occurrences
which are uncomfortable or pleasant. The first of these theories,
namely, that which regards discomfort and pleasure as actual contents
in those who experience them, has, I think, nothing conclusive
to be said in its favour.* It is suggested chiefly by an ambiguity
in the word "pain," which has misled many people, including Berkeley,
whom it supplied with one of his arguments for subjective idealism.
We may use "pain" as the opposite of "pleasure," and "painful"
as the opposite of "pleasant," or we may use "pain" to mean a
certain sort of sensation, on a level with the sensations of heat
and cold and touch. The latter use of the word has prevailed in
psychological literature, and it is now no longer used as the
opposite of "pleasure." Dr. H. Head, in a recent publication,
has stated this distinction as follows:**</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Various arguments in its favour are advanced by A.<br/>
Wohlgemuth, "On the feelings and their neural correlate,<br/>
with an examination of the nature of pain," "British Journal<br/>
of Psychology," viii, 4. (1917). But as these arguments are<br/>
largely a reductio ad absurdum of other theories, among<br/>
which that which I am advocating is not included, I cannot<br/>
regard them as establishing their contention.

</p>
<p>
** "Sensation and the Cerebral Cortex," "Brain," vol. xli,<br/>
part ii (September, 1918), p. 90. Cf. also Wohlgemuth, loc.<br/>
cit. pp. 437, 450.

</p>
</div>
<p>"It is necessary at the outset to distinguish clearly between
'discomfort' and 'pain.' Pain is a distinct sensory quality equivalent
to heat and cold, and its intensity can be roughly graded according
to the force expended in stimulation. Discomfort, on the other
hand, is that feeling-tone which is directly opposed to pleasure.
It may accompany sensations not in themselves essentially painful;
as for instance that produced by tickling the sole of the foot.
The reaction produced by repeated pricking contains both these
elements; for it evokes that sensory quality known as pain, accompanied
by a disagreeable feeling-tone, which we have called discomfort.
On the other hand, excessive pressure, except when applied directly
over some nerve-trunk, tends to excite more discomfort than pain."</p>

<p>The confusion between discomfort and pain has made people regard
discomfort as a more substantial thing than it is, and this in
turn has reacted upon the view taken of pleasure, since discomfort
and pleasure are evidently on a level in this respect. As soon
as discomfort is clearly distinguished from the sensation of pain,
it becomes more natural to regard discomfort and pleasure as properties
of mental occurrences than to regard them as separate mental occurrences
on their own account. I shall therefore dismiss the view that
they are separate mental occurrences, and regard them as properties
of such experiences as would be called respectively uncomfortable
and pleasant.</p>

<p>It remains to be examined whether they are actual qualities of
such occurrences, or are merely differences as to causal properties.
I do not myself see any way of deciding this question; either
view seems equally capable of accounting for the facts. If this
is true, it is safer to avoid the assumption that there are such
intrinsic qualities of mental occurrences as are in question,
and to assume only the causal differences which are undeniable.
Without condemning the intrinsic theory, we can define discomfort
and pleasure as consisting in causal properties, and say only
what will hold on either of the two theories. Following this course,
we shall say:</p>

<p>"Discomfort" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,
consisting in the fact that the occurrence in question stimulates
voluntary or reflex movements tending to produce some more or
less definite change involving the cessation of the occurrence.</p>

<p>"Pleasure" is a property of a sensation or other mental occurrence,
consisting in the fact that the occurrence in question either
does not stimulate any voluntary or reflex movement, or, if it
does, stimulates only such as tend to prolong the occurrence in
question.*</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Cf. Thorndike, op. cit., p. 243.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Conscious" desire, which we have now to consider, consists of
desire in the sense hitherto discussed, together with a true belief
as to its "purpose," i.e. as to the state of affairs that will
bring quiescence with cessation of the discomfort. If our theory
of desire is correct, a belief as to its purpose may very well
be erroneous, since only experience can show what causes a discomfort
to cease. When the experience needed is common and simple, as
in the case of hunger, a mistake is not very probable. But in
other cases&mdash;e.g. erotic desire in those who have had little or
no experience of its satisfaction&mdash;mistakes are to be expected,
and do in fact very often occur. The practice of inhibiting impulses,
which is to a great extent necessary to civilized life, makes
mistakes easier, by preventing experience of the actions to which
a desire would otherwise lead, and by often causing the inhibited
impulses themselves to be unnoticed or quickly forgotten. The
perfectly natural mistakes which thus arise constitute a large
proportion of what is, mistakenly in part, called self-deception,
and attributed by Freud to the "censor."</p>

<p>But there is a further point which needs emphasizing, namely,
that a belief that something is desired has often a tendency to
cause the very desire that is believed in. It is this fact that
makes the effect of "consciousness" on desire so complicated.</p>

<p>When we believe that we desire a certain state of affairs, that
often tends to cause a real desire for it. This is due partly
to the influence of words upon our emotions, in rhetoric for example,
and partly to the general fact that discomfort normally belongs
to the belief that we desire such-and-such a thing that we do
not possess. Thus what was originally a false opinion as to the
object of a desire acquires a certain truth: the false opinion
generates a secondary subsidiary desire, which nevertheless becomes
real. Let us take an illustration. Suppose you have been jilted
in a way which wounds your vanity. Your natural impulsive desire
will be of the sort expressed in Donne's poem:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
When by thy scorn, O Murderess, I am dead,

</p>
</div>
<p>in which he explains how he will haunt the poor lady as a ghost,
and prevent her from enjoying a moment's peace. But two things
stand in the way of your expressing yourself so naturally: on
the one hand, your vanity, which will not acknowledge how hard
you are hit; on the other hand, your conviction that you are a
civilized and humane person, who could not possibly indulge so
crude a desire as revenge. You will therefore experience a restlessness
which will at first seem quite aimless, but will finally resolve
itself in a conscious desire to change your profession, or go
round the world, or conceal your identity and live in Putney,
like Arnold Bennett's hero. Although the prime cause of this desire
is a false judgment as to your previous unconscious desire, yet
the new conscious desire has its own derivative genuineness, and
may influence your actions to the extent of sending you round
the world. The initial mistake, however, will have effects of
two kinds. First, in uncontrolled moments, under the influence
of sleepiness or drink or delirium, you will say things calculated
to injure the faithless deceiver. Secondly, you will find travel
disappointing, and the East less fascinating than you had hoped&mdash;unless,
some day, you hear that the wicked one has in turn been jilted.
If this happens, you will believe that you feel sincere sympathy,
but you will suddenly be much more delighted than before with
the beauties of tropical islands or the wonders of Chinese art.
A secondary desire, derived from a false judgment as to a primary
desire, has its own power of influencing action, and is therefore
a real desire according to our definition. But it has not the
same power as a primary desire of bringing thorough satisfaction
when it is realized; so long as the primary desire remains unsatisfied,
restlessness continues in spite of the secondary desire's success.
Hence arises a belief in the vanity of human wishes: the vain
wishes are those that are secondary, but mistaken beliefs prevent
us from realizing that they are secondary.</p>

<p>What may, with some propriety, be called self-deception arises
through the operation of desires for beliefs. We desire many things
which it is not in our power to achieve: that we should be universally
popular and admired, that our work should be the wonder of the
age, and that the universe should be so ordered as to bring ultimate
happiness to all, though not to our enemies until they have repented
and been purified by suffering. Such desires are too large to
be achieved through our own efforts. But it is found that a considerable
portion of the satisfaction which these things would bring us
if they were realized is to be achieved by the much easier operation
of believing that they are or will be realized. This desire for
beliefs, as opposed to desire for the actual facts, is a particular
case of secondary desire, and, like all secondary desire its satisfaction
does not lead to a complete cessation of the initial discomfort.
Nevertheless, desire for beliefs, as opposed to desire for facts,
is exceedingly potent both individually and socially. According
to the form of belief desired, it is called vanity, optimism,
or religion. Those who have sufficient power usually imprison
or put to death any one who tries to shake their faith in their
own excellence or in that of the universe; it is for this reason
that seditious libel and blasphemy have always been, and still
are, criminal offences.</p>

<p>It is very largely through desires for beliefs that the primitive
nature of desire has become so hidden, and that the part played
by consciousness has been so confusing and so exaggerated.</p>

<p>We may now summarize our analysis of desire and feeling.</p>

<p>A mental occurrence of any kind&mdash;sensation, image, belief, or
emotion&mdash;may be a cause of a series of actions, continuing, unless
interrupted, until some more or less definite state of affairs
is realized. Such a series of actions we call a "behaviour-cycle."
The degree of definiteness may vary greatly: hunger requires only
food in general, whereas the sight of a particular piece of food
raises a desire which requires the eating of that piece of food.
The property of causing such a cycle of occurrences is called
"discomfort"; the property of the mental occurrences in which
the cycle ends is called "pleasure." The actions constituting
the cycle must not be purely mechanical, i.e. they must be bodily
movements in whose causation the special properties of nervous
tissue are involved. The cycle ends in a condition of quiescence,
or of such action as tends only to preserve the status quo. The
state of affairs in which this condition of quiescence is achieved
is called the "purpose" of the cycle, and the initial mental occurrence
involving discomfort is called a "desire" for the state of affairs
that brings quiescence. A desire is called "conscious" when it
is accompanied by a true belief as to the state of affairs that
will bring quiescence; otherwise it is called "unconscious." All
primitive desire is unconscious, and in human beings beliefs as
to the purposes of desires are often mistaken. These mistaken
beliefs generate secondary desires, which cause various interesting
complications in the psychology of human desire, without fundamentally
altering the character which it shares with animal desire.</p>
