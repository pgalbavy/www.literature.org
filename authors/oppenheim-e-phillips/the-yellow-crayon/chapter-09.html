<P>
Felix, after an uneventful voyage, landed duly at Liverpool.  To
his amazement the first person he saw upon the quay was Mr. Sabin,
leaning upon his stick and smoking a cigarette.
<P>
"Come, come, Felix!" he exclaimed.  "Don't look at me as though I
were a ghost.  You have very little confidence in me, after all, I
see."
<P>
"But - how did you get here?"
<P>
"The Campania, of course.  I had plenty of time.  It was easy enough
for those fellows to arrest me, but they never had a chance of
holding me."
<P>
"But how did you get away in time?"
<P>
Mr. Sabin sighed.
<P>
"It was very simple," he said.  "One day, while one of those
wonderful spies was sleeping on my doormat I slipped away and went
over to Washington, saw the English Ambassador, convinced him of my
bonafides, told him very nearly the whole truth.  He promised if I
wired him that I was arrested to take my case up at once.  You sent
the despatch, and he kept his word.  I breakfasted on Saturday
morning at the Waldorf, and though a great dray was driven into
my carriage on the way to the boat, I escaped, as I always do - and
here I am."
<P>
"Unhurt!" Felix remarked with a smile, "as usual!"
<P>
Mr. Sabin nodded.
<P>
"The driver of my carriage was killed, and Duson had his arm broken,"
he said.  "I stepped out of the debris without a scratch.  Come into
the Customs House now and get your baggage through.  I have taken a
coupe on the special train and ordered lunch."
<P>
Before long they were on the way to London.  Mr. Sabin, whilst
luncheon was being served, talked only of the lightest matters.
But afterwards, when coffee was served and be had lit a cigarette,
he leaned over towards Felix.
<P>
"Felix," he said, "your sister is dear to you?"
<P>
"She is the only creature on earth," Felix said, "whom I care for.
She is very dear to me, indeed."
<P>
"Am I right," Mr. Sabin asked, "in assuming that the old enmity
between us is dead, that the last few years has wiped away the old
soreness
<P>
"Yes," Felix answered.  "I know that she was happy with you.  That
is enough for me."
<P>
"You and I," Mr. Sabin continued, "must work out her salvation.  Do
not be afraid that I am going to ask you impossibilities.  I know
that our ways must lie apart.  You can go to her at once.  It may
be many, many months before I can catch even a glimpse of her.
Never mind.  Let me feel that she has you within the circle, and I
without, with our lives devoted to her."
<P>
"You may rely upon that," Felix answered.  "Wherever she is I am
going.  I shall be there.  I will watch over her."
<P>
Mr. Sabin sighed.
<P>
"The more difficult task is mine," he said, "but I have no fear of
failure.  I shall find her surrounded by spies, by those who are
now my enemies.  Still, they will find it hard to shake me off.  It
may be that they took her from me only out of revenge.  If that be
so my task will be easier.  If there are other dangers which she is
called upon to face, it is still possible that they might accept my
service instead."
<P>
"You would give it?" Felix exclaimed.
<P>
"To the last drop of blood in my body," Mr. Sabin answered.  "Save
for my love for her I am a dead man upon the earth.  I have no
longer politics or ambition.  So the past can easily be expunged.
Those who must be her guiding influence shall be mine.
<P>
"You will win her back," Felix said.  "I am sure of it."
<P>
"I am willing to pay any price on earth," Mr. Sabin answered.  "If
they can forget the past I can.  I want you to remember this.  I
want her to know it.  I want them to know it.  That is all, Felix."
<P>
Mr. Sabin leaned back in his seat.  He had left this country last
a stricken and defeated man, left it with the echoes of his ruined
schemes crashing in his ears.  He came back to it a man with one
purpose only, and that such a purpose as never before had guided
him - the love of a woman.  Was it a sign of age, he wondered, this
return to the humanities?  His life had been full of great schemes,
he had wielded often a gigantic influence, more than once he had
made history.  And now the love of these things had gone from him.
Their fascination was powerless to quicken by a single beat his
steady pulse.  Monarchy or republic - what did he care?  It was
Lucille he wanted, the woman who had shown him how sweet even defeat
might be, who had made these three years of his life so happy that
they seemed to have passed in one delightful dream.  Were they dead, annihilated, these old
ambitions, the old love of great doings, or
did they only slumber?  He moved in his seat uneasily.
<P>
At Euston the two men separated with a silent handshake.  Mr. Sabin
drove to one of the largest and newest of the modern hotels de luxe.
He entered his name as Mr. Sabin - the old exile's hatred of using
his title in a foreign country had become a confirmed habit with
him - and mingled freely with the crowds who thronged into the
restaurant at night.  There were many faces which he remembered,
there were a few who remembered him.  He neither courted nor shunned
observation.  He sat at dinner-time at a retired table, and found
himself watching the people with a stir of pleasure.  Afterwards he
went round to a famous club, of which he had once been made a life
member, but towards midnight he was wearied of the dull decorum of
his surroundings, and returning to the hotel, sought the restaurant
once more.  The stream of people coming in to supper was greater
even than at dinner-time.  He found a small table, and ordered some
oysters.  The sight of this bevy of pleasure-seekers, all apparently
with multitudes of friends, might have engendered a sense of
loneliness in a man of different disposition.  To Mr. Sabin his
isolation was a luxury.  He had an uninterrupted opportunity of
pursuing his favourite study.
<P>
There entered a party towards midnight, to meet whom the head-waiter
himself came hurrying from the further end of the room, and whose
arrival created a little buzz of interest.  The woman who formed the
central figure of the little group had for two years known no rival
either at Court or in Society.  She was the most beautiful woman in
England, beautiful too with all the subtle grace of her royal descent.
There were women upon the stage whose faces might have borne
comparison with hers, but there was not one who in a room would not
have sunk into insignificance by her side.  Her movements, her
carriage were incomparable - the inherited gifts of a race of women
born in palaces.
<P>
Mr. Sabin, who neither shunned nor courted observation, watched her
with a grim smile which was not devoid of bitterness.  Suddenly she
saw him.  With a little cry of wonder she came towards him with
outstretched hands.
<P>
"It is marvelous," she exclaimed.  "You?  Really you?"
<P>
He bowed low over her hands.
<P>
"It is I, dear Helene," he answered.  "A moment ago I was dreaming.
I thought that I was back once more at Versailles, and in the
presence of my Queen."
<P>
She laughed softly.
<P>
"There may be no Versailles," she murmured, "but you will be a
courtier to the end of your days."
<P>
"At least," he said, "believe me that my congratulations come from
my heart.  Your happiness is written in your face, and your husband
must be the proudest man in England."
<P>
He was standing now by her side, and he held out his hand to Mr.
Sabin.
<P>
"I hope, sir," he said pleasantly, "that you bear me no ill - will."
<P>
"It would be madness," Mr. Sabin answered.  "To be the most beautiful
peeress in England is perhaps for Helene a happier fate than to be
the first queen of a new dynasty."
<P>
"And you, uncle?" Helene said.  "You are back from your exile then.
How often I have felt disposed to smile when I thought of you, of
all men, in America.
<P>
"I went into exile," Mr. Sabin answered, "and I found paradise.  The
three years which have passed since I saw you last have been the
happiest of my life."
<P>
"Lucille!" Helene exclaimed.
<P>
"Is my wife," Mr. Sabin answered.
<P>
"Delightful!" Helene murmured.  "She is with you then, I hope.
Indeed, I felt sure that I saw her the other night at the opera."
<P>
"At the opera!" Mr. Sabin for a moment was silent.  He would have
been ashamed to confess that his heart was beating strongly, that a
crowd of eager questions trembled upon his lips.  He recovered
himself after a moment.
<P>
"Lucille is not with me for the moment," he said in measured tones.
"I am detaining you from your guests, Helene.  If you will permit
me I will call upon you."
<P>
"Won't you join us?" Lord Camperdown asked courteously.  "We are
only a small party - the Portuguese Ambassador and his wife, the
Duke of Medchester, and Stanley Phillipson."
<P>
Mr. Sabin rose at once.
<P>
"I shall be delighted," he said.
<P>
Lord Camperdown hesitated for a moment.
<P>
"I present Monsieur le Due de Souspennier, I presume?" he remarked,
smiling.
<P>
Mr. Sabin bowed.
<P>
"I am Mr. Sabin," he said, "at the hotels and places where one
travels.  To my friends I have no longer an incognito.  It is not
necessary."
<P>
It was a brilliant little supper party, and Mr. Sabin contributed
at least his share to the general entertainment.  Before they
dispersed he had to bring out his tablets to make notes of his
engagements.  He stood on the top of the steps above the palm-court
to wish them good-bye, leaning on his stick.  Helene turned back
and waved her hand.
<P>
"He is unchanged," she murmured, "yet I fear that there must be
trouble."
<P>
"Why?  He seemed cheerful enough," her husband remarked.
<P>
She dropped her voice a little.
<P>
"Lucille is in London.  She is staying at Dorset House."
