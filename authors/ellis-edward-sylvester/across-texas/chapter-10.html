<p><em>THE </em>sun was no more than fairly above the horizon when
the party were on the move, headed in the direction named. The
expected norther did not come, the weather continuing as perfect
as heart could wish. The uneven ground rendered the progress slow
for a couple of hours, the horsemen being obliged to pick their
way with care; but, by bearing to the right, better ground was
reached, and they struck into an easy gallop which lasted for
several hours.</p>

<p>"Strubell," said Herbert, who with Nick was riding beside the
Texan, the other being at the rear with the pack animals, "do
you expect to find any use for that lasso?"</p>

<p>"You mean the <em>lariat</em>," replied the cowboy, looking down
at the rope coiled at his saddle; "can’t say, but Baker and I
make it a rule to go prepared for business. We may strike a job
in New Mexico, after taking a look at the ranch for Mr. Lord."</p>

<p>"But you could get them there."</p>

<p>"Of course, but I’ve used this for years, just as Baker has his,
and we are so accustomed to them that we prefer to take them with
us, just as you will soon grow to prefer your pony and your Winchester
above all others."</p>

<p>"When is the harvest time, as you may call it, for cattle?" asked
Nick, who was always on the lookout for a chance to increase his
store of knowledge.</p>

<p>"The spring; that’s when the big herds are put up for the drive,
and that’s the season too, when the yearly round-up takes place."</p>

<p>"What’s that for?"</p>

<p>"To apportion the unmarked calves and yearlings among the owners
of stock on the range, so they can be branded."</p>

<p>"I should think there would be a confusion of brands."</p>

<p>"No; that can never happen, for the law requires the brand to
be recorded in the county clerk’s office. It is generally the
initials of the owner’s name, with perhaps some device to help
distinguish it. The county clerk sees to it that no two are the
same. But," added the Texan, "the law compels every cattle owner
to record also with the county clerk the ear-marks, crops, half-crops,
upper and under bits, upper and under slopes, splits, swallow-forks,
and jingle-bobs. When all this is done, the ranchman can identify
his property as easily as you could pick out your own father in
a crowd."</p>

<p>"Suppose a lot of branded cattle are sold?" asked Nick.</p>

<p>"That seller is compelled to counterbrand them, and in case they
are driven from the State, the buyer is obliged to road-brand
them with a device different from his regular brand, and must
record it in every county through which he passes."</p>

<p>"I should think some of the cattle would become pretty well covered
with brands."</p>

<p>"So they do; after a few shiftings about, I have seen them so
thickly branded that there seemed no place for anything new in
that line. It doesn’t require many transfers to do this when the
burned letters, as I have seen them, are nearly a foot long."</p>

<p>"How is the branding done?"</p>

<p>"When convenient, the animal is driven between two parallel lines
of fencing, called a chute, bars being placed before and behind
him. He is then helpless, and the operator does the work at his
leisure. But fences (except the wire kind that the big owners
are stretching across the country) are scarce, and we generally
have to go to the help of the brander."</p>

<p>"How do you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Easily enough; slip about eight feet of the end of the lariat
through the ring, and, putting a loop at the other end, over the
pommel of the saddle, I gather the coils into my bridle hand,
holding the noose in my right, and start my pony on a gallop.
The animal that I want breaks into a run. I quickly get near enough
to drop the noose over its head or fore feet, and the pony wheels
the other way and braces himself for the shock that he knows is
coming and which throws the animal to the ground. The minute he
goes down, the branders seize him by the head and tail, and the
hot iron does its work."</p>

<p>"The operation must be painful," suggested Herbert.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Strubell, "I suppose the animal doesn’t enjoy
it overmuch, but it isn’t so bad as many think, for the brander
must take great care not to burn through the skin into the flesh."</p>

<p>"What harm would be done by <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"The brand would be blotched, and a good many dishonest people
would find an excuse for getting their brands mixed; but that
isn’t the worst trouble," added the cowboy, "for after the branding
comes the blow-fly, which is the pest of Texas."</p>

<p>"What is his style of working?"</p>

<p>"He deposits his eggs under the raw sore, and, before long, thousands
of screw worms are eating their way toward the vitals of the animal."</p>

<p>"What is done to check them?"</p>

<p>"We have different remedies, which only half do their work, but
the best that I know of is cresylic ointment. In order to apply
it, however, the animal must be roped and sometimes thrown down."</p>

<p>"It looks as if the cowboy has more work than play in his business,"
said Nick, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Strubell turned and stared at him a moment, as if pitying his
ignorance.</p>

<p>"If you have any doubt about it, just try it for six months or
a year. We spend most of our time in the saddle from daylight
till dark. When on the trail, our diet is bacon, bread, and coffee,
and not overmuch of that. I have gone twenty hours without a mouthful,
for the simple reason that I hadn’t the time to ride to the cook
wagon to get it. When one pony gave out, I jumped on another and
rode him like a house afire."</p>

<p>"What was the cause for such hard work?"</p>

<p>"Chiefly stampedes, which set the animals wild. When following
the Old Cattle Trail, northward through Texas and Kansas, I have
had five thousand cattle scattered to every point of the compass
by a thunder-storm, despite all we could do to keep them together.
Sometimes they become crazy for water, start bellowing on a full
run, and crowd into the first stream so fast that a hundred or
two are drowned; then, when the night is still and no air stirring,
nor the slightest cause, so far as you can see, exists for alarm,
something will set them off again. The only explanation that I
could ever think of was that the animals are troubled now and
then with bad dreams, and by their cavorting frighten the others
out of their wits."</p>

<p>"They must be guarded carefully at night?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; our men are divided into three reliefs, which makes
it a little harder than we have it now. When the stampede breaks
out, the riders have no let up night or day till the cattle are
brought together again. Then, too, the Kiowas or Comanches may
take it into their heads to try a little cattle speculation. They
are all fine horsemen and rifle-shots, and a half dozen of the
scamps can make things as lively on a dark night as a nest of
hornets. However, we like it for all that," said the Texan, "because
it’s the only business we know; but these big cattle owners, that
are fencing in most of Texas with their barbed wire, will soon
take it away from us."</p>

<p>At this juncture, Lattin touched his pony with his spur, and
placed him alongside the others.</p>

<p>"I wish," said he, "that you would p’int that machine of yours
off there to the east, and let us know what you make of it."</p>

<p>His outstretched arm showed the direction named, and his friends
naturally turned their attention toward that point of the compass.
They were on the plain, where the grass grew plentifully, the
hilly portions being in sight several miles to their left.</p>

<p>Before the field glass was called into use, all saw, seemingly
in the very rim of the horizon, several horsemen moving apparently
over a course parallel with their own, since Lattin said they
had been in sight for nearly an hour, and were neither more nor
less distinct than when first observed.</p>

<p>The glasses were passed from one to the other, and the parties
were closely studied. The instruments were of great help, giving
to our friends a knowledge which otherwise they could not have
obtained.</p>

<p>All agreed that there were three horsemen, and that one, possibly
two, were white men. The third might have belonged to the same
race, but, for some cause, the Texans declared that he was a half-breed,
known as Jim-John, one of the worst rogues in the Southwest.</p>

<p>"If you know <em>him</em>," said Nick, "you ought to know the
others."</p>

<p>"So I do," quietly replied Strubell; "one is Bell Rickard, that
you introduced to us last night. They’re a bad lot, and we’re
bound to have trouble with them before morning."</p>

<p>Little did the sagacious Texan suspect the startling manner in
which his words were to be verified.</p>
