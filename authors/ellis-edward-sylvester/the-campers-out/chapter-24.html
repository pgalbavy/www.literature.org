<p>"You blunderhead!" called Bob Budd, forgetting his own peril
in his anger, "you’ve killed Hero. I hope the buck will gore you
to death."</p>

<p>The triumphant animal seemed to be on the point of doing so,
for he stood with head raised, his brown sides rising and falling
like a pair of bellows from his severe exertion, looking at the
young man that had fired the shot which ended the hunting career
of Hero, as if debating with himself how best to end <em>his</em>
hunting career.</p>

<p>It would be putting it mildly to say that Jim McGovern was dumbfounded.
He was transfixed for an instant, and then, awaking to his own
peril, he whirled about, threw down his gun, and dashed for the
tree behind which he was standing a minute before.</p>

<p>Throwing both arms and legs around the trunk, as though it were
a long lost brother, he began climbing fast and furiously.</p>

<p>It may be wondered whether a faint glimmering of the truth did
not force itself through the brain of the buck that had had such
a strange experience.</p>

<p>Can it be that he felt that the lad who had fired the last shot
had in some way done him an inestimable service in removing the
hound from his path?</p>

<p>Probably such a conception is beyond the reach of a wild animal,
but, be that as it may, the buck, after staring a moment at the
flying figure, turned and looked at Tom Wagstaff perched in the
tree, and then gazed down at Bob Budd, who was doing his utmost
to shrink into a smaller space than ever beneath the sloping trunk
of the oak. Then, as if disgusted with the whole party, he turned
about and deliberately trotted off in the woods, showing no further
concern for those with whom he had had such a lively bout.</p>

<p>The wounds given by Bob Budd a short time before were so insignificant
that, though they roused the animal’s rage, they could not have
caused him any inconvenience or suffering.</p>

<p>Finally, when it was apparent that the buck had departed for
good, Tom Wagstaff descended from his perch in the tree, Jim McGovern
slid down to the ground, Bob Budd backed out from beneath the
oak, and each one recovering his gun, they came together in the
open space where the dead Hero lay.</p>

<p>It was a characteristic meeting. Bob was maddened over the loss
of his hound, while he and all three felt an unspeakable relief
in knowing that the terrible buck had withdrawn without killing
them.</p>

<p>"Of all shooting that I ever heard of, <em>that</em> is the worst,"
said Bob, with a sniff of disgust, pointing at the carcass of
Hero.</p>

<p>"It was better than yours," retorted Jim, "for it killed <em>something</em>,
while yours didn’t hurt anything."</p>

<p>"I hit the buck, any way," said Bob, sullenly.</p>

<p>"The buck didn’t act as though he knew it," was the truthful
comment of Tom Wagstaff.</p>

<p>"I don’t see that <em>you</em> have any chance to talk," retorted
Bob; "for you fired both barrels at him and then yelled for us
to come and save you."</p>

<p>"But you didn’t come, and I had to run out here to help you."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the minute you caught sight of the buck you took to
a tree."</p>

<p>"I was only doing what you had done a minute before," said Tom;
"only I had better sense than to try to crawl <em>under</em> a
tree."</p>

<p>"Because you hadn’t any to crawl under, <em>that’s</em> the only
reason."</p>

<p>"There aint any of us in shape to find fault with the others,
for we have all made an exhibition that it’s lucky nobody else
saw."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Bob, "that we don’t amount to much as
hunters; what do you suppose has become of that buck?"</p>

<p>"He isn’t far off, but I don’t believe it will do to hunt him."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"There <em>is too much danger of finding him</em>," was the significant
reply of Bob.</p>

<p>The point of this remark was so apparent to all that they smiled
and agreed that the best thing they could do was to return to
camp. They naturally felt exhausted after their lively experience
with the animal, of whose pluck they had gained a better knowledge
than ever before.</p>

<p>"Suppose there had been <em>two</em> of them," remarked Tom,
leading the way down the mountain path.</p>

<p>"Then there wouldn’t have been any of us," replied Jim, who was
walking next to him, Bob Budd bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe there’s half so much fun in hunting as a good
many people fancy," was the sage observation of young Wagstaff,
who found it so much easier to walk down than up the path, that
he felt inclined to discuss their recent experience.</p>

<p>"Well, for those that like that kind of sport, why, that’s the
kind of sport they like. As for me, I’d rather stretch out in
the camp and take things easy."</p>

<p>This picture was so fascinating to the others that they hastened
their footsteps so as to reach their headquarters with the least
possible delay.</p>

<p>"I can’t help feeling grateful for one thing," remarked Bob,
from the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>"What’s that?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"That Jim shot poor Hero instead of me. I can’t understand how
I escaped, for we weren’t more than twenty feet apart, and Jim
was fully as far as that from the buck when he took such careful
aim."</p>

<p>"My aim was all right," replied Jim, "but after the charge left
the gun the hound and the buck changed places. If they hadn’t
moved the game would have caught it."</p>

<p>Since, as I have explained, large game was exceedingly rare in
that section of the country, and since, also, the Piketown Rangers
had been unusually favored in scaring up a fine buck on such short
notice, it would seem they had no reason to believe there was
any probability of encountering any more quadrupeds larger than
a rabbit.</p>

<p>All the same, however, each member of the party should have seen
to it that his gun was loaded before moving from the scene of
the flurry with the buck. Such is the rule among hunters, and
you will admit that it is a good one.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, all were trudging down the mountain-side with empty
weapons and with never a thought of preparation for meeting any
more game.</p>

<p>Had the buck suddenly made his appearance nothing would have
remained for them but to take to their heels; but inasmuch as
they would have done that if their guns were ready, I don’t see
that it made so much difference after all.</p>

<p>A short distance farther the trio reached a tiny stream of icy
cold and clear water, which bubbled from the rocks only a short
distance away on their left.</p>

<p>Naturally they were athirst again, and, since all their flasks
had been exhausted long before, they were driven to the necessity
of slaking their thirst with the <em>aqua pura</em>.</p>

<p>This was done in the original fashion with which I am quite sure
all my boy readers are familiar. Lying on their faces they touched
their lips to the sparkling fluid, and each drank his fill.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" sighed Jim McGovern, drawing the back of his hand across
his mouth, "that aint so bad when you can’t get anything better."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Bob, "when a fellow is dying with thirst he can
make out very well on that stuff, but it’s mighty thin."</p>

<p>"I would hate to be obliged to stick to it," added Tom.</p>

<p>And yet every one of that precious party knew in his own heart
that the ingenuity of man cannot compound a nectar to be compared
in soulful, refreshing deliciousness with the tasteless, colorless,
odorless drink of nature.</p>

<p>Stick to <em>that</em>, boys, and never touch a drop of the enemy
which, put in the mouth, steals away the brains and wrecks not
only the body but the immortal soul.</p>

<p>"I think I can go a little more of that," said Jim, kneeling
down again and helping himself as before; "I shouldn’t wonder
now that if there was a tax put on water the same as on whiskey
a good deal more of it would be drunk."</p>

<p>Tom Wagstaff was standing a few feet farther up the streamlet,
carefully scrutinizing the ground.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" asked Bob Budd.</p>

<p>"Aint those dents the tracks of some wild animal?" he asked,
pointing to the damp, yielding earth on the other side.</p>

<p>Jim and Bob stepped beside him and scrutinized the marks that
so interested their companion.</p>

<p>"By jingo!" exclaimed Jim, "they are the tracks of <em>something</em>,
and if they were made by a man, then he’s got the queerest feet
I ever seen on anybody."</p>

<p>Bob stepped across the brook and stooped down that he might examine
the impressions more closely.</p>

<p>"What do you s’pose?" he asked, looking up in the faces of his
companions with a scared expression.</p>

<p>"We s’pose we don’t know what made the tracks."</p>

<p>"But <em>guess</em>" insisted Bob, with provoking deliberation.</p>

<p>"An elephant?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A hippopotamus?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"How can we guess?" asked Jim, impatiently; "if you know anything
about it let us know, and if you don’t know, say so."</p>

<p>"Those tracks were made by a <em>big black bear</em>!"</p>
