<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Hélène d'Enver had gone back to the country, and Ogilvy dared
not pursue her thither.</p>

<p>From her fastness at Estwich she defied him in letters, but every
letter of hers seemed to leave some loophole open for further
argument, and Ogilvy replied valiantly from a perfectly safe distance,
vowing that he meant to marry her some day in spite of herself
and threatening to go up and tell her so to her face, until she
became bored to death waiting for him to fulfil this threat.</p>

<p>"There's a perfectly good inn here," she wrote,&mdash;"for of course,
under the circumstances, you would scarcely have the impudence
to expect the hospitality of my own roof. But if you are determined
to have a final 'No' for your answer, I am entirely competent
to give it to you by word of mouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And such a distractingly lovely mouth," sighed Ogilvy, perusing
the letter in his studio. He whistled a slow waltz, thoughtfully,
and as slowly and solemnly kept step to it, turning round and
round, buried in deepest reflection. He had a habit of doing this
when profoundly perplexed.</p>

<p>Annan discovered him waltzing mournfully all by himself:</p>

<p>"What's up?" he inquired cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It's all up, I suppose."</p>

<p>"With you and your countess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry."</p>

<p>"Rot! Why don't you go and talk to her?"</p>

<p>"Because if I remain invisible she might possibly forget my face.
I stand a better chance by letter, Harry."</p>

<p>"Now you're not bad-looking," insisted Annan, kindly. "And besides,
a man's face doesn't count with a girl. Half of 'em are neurotics,
anyway, and they adore the bizarre&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn it," snapped Sam, "do you mean that my countenance resembles
a gargoyle? If you do, say so in English."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," said Annan soothingly,&mdash;"I've seen more awful mugs&mdash;married
mugs, too. What woman has done woman may do again. Buck up! Beauty
and the beast is no idle jest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll punch you good and plenty," began Sam wrathfully, but Annan
fled, weak with laughter.</p>

<p>"There's no vainer man than an ugly one!" he called back, and
slammed the door to escape a flight of paint brushes hurled by
a maddened man.</p>

<p>"I'll go! By jinks, I'll go, anyway!" he exclaimed; "and I don't
care what she thinks of my face ... only I think I'll take Annan
with me&mdash;just for company&mdash;or&mdash;dummy bridge on the way up....
Harry!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Annan cautiously appeared, ready for rapid flight.</p>

<p>"Aw come on in! My face suits me. Besides, thank Heaven I've
got a reputation back of it; but yours breaks the speed laws.
Will you go up there with me&mdash;like a man?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To Estwich?"</p>

<p>"When?" inquired Annan, sceptically.</p>

<p>"Now!&mdash;b' jinks!"</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> sufficient nerve, <em>this</em> time?"</p>

<p>"Watch me."</p>

<p>And he dragged out a suit-case and began wildly throwing articles
of toilet and apparel into it,</p>

<p>"Come on, Harry!" he shouted, hurling a pair of tennis shoes
at the suit-case; "I've got to go while I'm excited or I'll never
budge!"</p>

<p>But when, ten minutes later, Annan arrived, suit-case in hand,
ready for love's journey, he could scarcely contrive to kick and
drag Sam into the elevator, and, later, into a taxicab.</p>

<p>Ogilvy sat there alternately shivering and attempting to invent
imperative engagements in town which he had just remembered, but
Annan said angrily:</p>

<p>"No, you don't. This makes the seventh time I've started with
you for Estwich, and I'm going to put it through or perish in
a hand-to-hand conflict with you."</p>

<p>And he started for the train, dragging Sam with him, talking
angrily all the time.</p>

<p>He talked all the way to Estwich, too, partly to reassure Ogilvy
and give him no time for terrified reflection, partly because
he liked to talk. And when they arrived at the Estwich Arms he
shoved Ogilvy into a room, locked the door, and went away to telephone
to the Countess d'Enver.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she inquired sweetly, "who is it?"</p>

<p>"Me," replied Annan, regardless of an unpopular grammatical convention.
"I'm here with Ogilvy. May we come to tea?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Ogilvy <em>here</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here at the Estwich Arms. May <em>I&mdash;</em>er&mdash;may <em>he</em>
bring <em>me</em> over to call on you?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. Oh, with pleasure, Mr. Annan.... When may I expect hi&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"In about ten minutes," replied Annan firmly.</p>

<p>Then he went back and looked into Ogilvy's room. Sam was seated,
his head clasped in his hands.</p>

<p>"I thought you <em>might</em> tear up your sheets and let yourself
out of the window," said Annan sarcastically. "You're a fine specimen!
Why you're actually lantern-jawed with fright. But I don't care!
Come on; we're expected to tea! Get into your white flannels and
pretty blue coat and put on your dinkey rah-rah, and follow me.
Or, by heaven! &mdash;I'll do murder right now!"</p>

<p>Ogilvy's knees wavered as they entered the gateway.</p>

<p>"Go on!" hissed Annan, giving him a violent shove.</p>

<p>Then, to Ogilvy, came that desperate and hysterical courage that
comes to those whose terrors have at last infuriated them.</p>

<p>"By jinks!" he said with an unearthly smile, "I <em>will</em>
come on!"</p>

<p>And he did, straight through the door and into the pretty living
room where Hélène d'Enver rose in some slight consternation to
receive this astonishingly pale and rather desperate-faced young
man.</p>

<p>"Harry," said Ogilvy, calmly retaining Hélène's hand, "you go
and play around the yard for a few moments. I have something to
tell the Countess d'Enver; and then we'll all have tea."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ogilvy!" she said, amazed.</p>

<p>But Annan had already vanished; and she looked into a pair of
steady eyes that suddenly made her quail.</p>

<p>"Hélène," he said, "I really do love you."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I am scared blue. That's why I'm holding on
to your hand so desperately.'"]</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! I love you! Are you going to let me?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>how on earth&mdash;what a perfectly senseless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it. I'm half senseless from fright. Yes, I am, Hélène!
Now! here! at this very minute, I am scared blue. That's why I'm
holding on to your hand so desperately; I'm afraid to let go."</p>

<p>She flushed brightly with annoyance, or something or other&mdash;but
he held fast to her hand and put one arm around her waist.</p>

<p>"Sam!" she said, exasperated. That was the last perfectly coherent
word she uttered for several minutes. And, later, she was too
busy to say very much.</p>

<p>When Annan returned, Hélène rose from the couch where she and
Ogilvy had been seated and came across the floor, blushing vividly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what on earth you think of me, Mr. Annan, and I
suppose I will have to learn to endure the consequences of Mr.
Ogilvy's eccentricities&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm terribly glad!" said Annan, grinning, and taking her
hand in both of his.</p>

<p>They had tea on the veranda. Ogilvy was too excited and far too
happy to be dignified, and Hélène was so much embarrassed by his
behaviour and so much in love that she made a distractingly pretty
picture between the two young men who, as Rita had said, would
never, never be old enough to grow up.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Hélène, "that your friends the Nevilles have
recently been very nice to me? They have called, and have returned
my call, and have asked me to dinner. I suppose cordiality takes
longer to arrive at maturity in New York State than in any other
part of the Union. But when New York people make up their minds
to be agreeable, they certainly are delightful."</p>

<p>"They're a bunch of snobs," said Ogilvy, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hélène with a distressed glance at Annan.</p>

<p>"He's one, too," observed her affianced, coolly nodding toward
Annan. "We're a sickening lot, Hélène&mdash;until some charming and
genuine person like you comes along to jounce us out of our smiling
and imbecile self-absorption."</p>

<p>"I," said Annan gravely, "am probably the most frightful snob
that ever wandered, in a moment of temporary aberration, north
of lower Fifth Avenue."</p>

<p>"I'm worse," observed Sam gloomily. "Help us, Hélène, toward
loftier aspirations. Be our little uplift girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You silly things!" she said indignantly.</p>

<p>Later two riders passed the house, Cameron and Stephanie Swift,
who saluted Hélène most cordially, and waved airy recognition
to the two men.</p>

<p>"More snobs," commented Sam.</p>

<p>"They are very delightful people!" retorted Hélène hotly.</p>

<p>"Most snobs are when they like you."</p>

<p>"Sam! I won't have you express such sentiments!"</p>

<p>He bent nearer to her:</p>

<p>"Dearest, I never had any sentiments except for you. And only
the inconvenient propinquity of that man Annan prevents me from
expressing them."</p>

<p>"Please, Sam&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid; I won't. He wouldn't care;&mdash;but I won't....
Hello! Why look who's here!" he exclaimed, rising. "Why it's the
great god Kelly and little Sunshine!"&mdash;as Neville and Valerie
sprang out of Mrs. Collis's touring car and came up the walk.</p>

<p>Hélène went forward to meet them, putting one arm around Valerie
and holding out the other to Neville.</p>

<p>"When did you arrive, darling?" she exclaimed. "How do you do,
Mr. Neville? Valerie, child, I'm perfectly enchanted to see you.
But where in the world are you stopping?"</p>

<p>"At Ashuelyn," said the girl, looking straight into Hélène's
eyes. A faint flash of telepathy passed between them; then, slowly,
Hélène turned and looked at Neville.</p>

<p>"Will you wish us happiness?" he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh-h," whispered Hélène under her breath&mdash;"I do&mdash;I do &mdash;God
knows. I wish you everything that makes for happiness in all the
world!" she stammered, for the wonder of it was still on her.</p>

<p>Then Sam's voice sounded close at hand:</p>

<p>"Why," he said admiringly, "it <em>looks</em> like lovey and
dovey!"</p>

<p>"It is," said Valerie, laughing.</p>

<p>"You!&mdash;<em>and</em> Kelly!"</p>

<p>"We two."</p>

<p>Sam in his excitement became a little wild and incongruous:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'My wife's gone to the country!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooray! Hooray!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>he shouted, holding hands with Annan and swinging back and forth.</p>

<p>"Sam!" exclaimed Hélène, mortified.</p>

<p>"Darling?&mdash;oh, gee! I forgot what is due to decorum! Please,
<em>please</em> forgive me, Hélène! And kindly inform these ladies
and gentlemen that you have consented to render me eternally and
supremely happy; because if I tried to express to them that delirious
fact I'd end by standing on my head in the grass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear!" whispered Valerie, holding tightly to Hélène's hands.</p>

<p>"Isn't it dreadful?" murmured Hélène, turning her blue eyes on
the man who never would grow old enough to grow up. "I had no
such intention, I can assure you; and I don't even understand
myself yet."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Valerie, laughing tenderly;&mdash;"then you are
like all other women. What is the use of our ever trying to understand
ourselves?"</p>

<p>Hélène laughed, too:</p>

<p>"No use, dear. Leave it to men who say <em>they</em> understand
us. It's a mercy somebody does."</p>

<p>"Isn't it," nodded Valerie; and they kissed each other, laughing.</p>

<p>"My goodness, it's like the embrace of the two augurs!" said
Ogilvy. "They're laughing at <em>us</em>, Kelly!&mdash;at you, and
me and Harry!&mdash;and at man in general!&mdash;innocent man!&mdash;so charmingly
and guilelessly symbolised by us! Stop it, Hélène! You make me
shiver. You'll frighten Annan so that he'll <em>never</em> marry
if you and Valerie laugh that way at each other."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Hélène, quieting him with a fair hand laid lightly
on his sleeve, "whether you all would remain and dine with me
this evening&mdash;just as you are I mean;&mdash;and I won't dress&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I insist <em>proh pudeur</em>," muttered Sam. "I can't countenance
any such saturnalia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, do be quiet, dear&mdash;" She caught herself up with a blush,
and everybody smiled.</p>

<p>"What do we care!" said Sam. "I'm tired of convention! If I want
to call you darling in public, b'jinks! I will! Darling&mdash;darling&mdash;darling&mdash;there!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Sam!</em>"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>Hélène looked at Valerie:</p>

<p>"There's no use," she sighed, "is there?"</p>

<p>"No use," sighed Valerie, smiling at the man she loved.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
