<p>It was a wise man who said that the biggest kind of courage was
to be able to sit still. I used to feel that when we were getting
shelled in the reserve trenches outside Vermelles. I felt it before
we went over the parapets at Loos, but I never felt it so much
as on the last two days in that cellar. I had simply to set my
teeth and take a pull on myself. Peter had gone on a crazy errand
which I scarcely believed could come off. There were no signs
of Sandy; somewhere within a hundred yards he was fighting his
own battles, and I was tormented by the thought that he might
get jumpy again and wreck everything. A strange Companion brought
us food, a man who spoke only Turkish and could tell us nothing;
Hussin, I judged, was busy about the horses. If I could only have
done something to help on matters I could have scotched my anxiety,
but there was nothing to be done, nothing but wait and brood.
I tell you I began to sympathize with the general behind the lines
in a battle, the fellow who makes the plan which others execute.
Leading a charge can be nothing like so nerve-shaking a business
as sitting in an easy-chair and waiting on the news of it.</p>

<p>It was bitter cold, and we spent most of the day wrapped in our
greatcoats and buried deep in the straw. Blenkiron was a marvel.
There was no light for him to play Patience by, but he never complained.
He slept a lot of the time, and when he was awake talked as cheerily
as if he were starting out on a holiday. He had one great comfort,
his dyspepsia was gone. He sang hymns constantly to the benign
Providence that had squared his duodenum.</p>

<p>My only occupation was to listen for the guns. The first day
after Peter left they were very quiet on the front nearest us,
but in the late evening they started a terrific racket. The next
day they never stopped from dawn to dusk, so that it reminded
me of that tremendous forty-eight hours before Loos. I tried to
read into this some proof that Peter had got through, but it would
not work. It looked more like the opposite, for this desperate
hammering must mean that the frontal assault was still the Russian
game.</p>

<p>Two or three times I climbed on the housetop for fresh air. The
day was foggy and damp, and I could see very little of the countryside.
Transport was still bumping southward along the road to the Palantuken,
and the slow wagon-loads of wounded returning. One thing I noticed,
however; there was a perpetual coming and going between the house
and the city. Motors and mounted messengers were constantly arriving
and departing, and I concluded that Hilda von Einem was getting
ready for her part in the defence of Erzerum.</p>

<p>These ascents were all on the first day after Peter’s going.
The second day, when I tried the trap, I found it closed and heavily
weighted. This must have been done by our friends, and very right,
too. If the house were becoming a place of public resort, it would
never do for me to be journeying roof-ward.</p>

<p>Late on the second night Hussin reappeared. It was after supper,
when Blenkiron had gone peacefully to sleep and I was beginning
to count the hours till the morning. I could not close an eye
during these days and not much at night.</p>

<p>Hussin did not light a lantern. I heard his key in the lock,
and then his light step close to where we lay.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?" he said, and when I answered he sat down beside
me.</p>

<p>"The horses are found," he said, "and the Master bids me tell
you that we start in the morning three hours before dawn."</p>

<p>It was welcome news. "Tell me what is happening," I begged; "we
have been lying in this tomb for three days and heard nothing."</p>

<p>"The guns are busy," he said. "The Allemans come to this place
every hour, I know not for what. Also there has been a great search
for you. The searchers have been here, but they were sent away
empty.... Sleep, my lord, for there is wild work before us."</p>

<p>I did not sleep much, for I was strung too high with expectation,
and I envied Blenkiron his now eupeptic slumbers. But for an hour
or so I dropped off, and my old nightmare came back. Once again
I was in the throat of a pass, hotly pursued, straining for some
sanctuary which I knew I must reach. But I was no longer alone.
Others were with me: how many I could not tell, for when I tried
to see their faces they dissolved in mist. Deep snow was underfoot,
a grey sky was over us, black peaks were on all sides, but ahead
in the mist of the pass was that curious <em>castrol</em> which
I had first seen in my dream on the Erzerum road.</p>

<p>I saw it distinct in every detail. It rose to the left of the
road through the pass, above a hollow where great boulders stood
out in the snow. Its sides were steep, so that the snow had slipped
off in patches, leaving stretches of glistening black shale. The
<em>kranz</em> at the top did not rise sheer, but sloped at an
angle of forty-five, and on the very summit there seemed a hollow,
as if the earth within the rock-rim had been beaten by weather
into a cup.</p>

<p>That is often the way with a South African <em>castrol</em>,
and I knew it was so with this. We were straining for it, but
the snow clogged us, and our enemies were very close behind.</p>

<p>Then I was awakened by a figure at my side. "Get ready, my lord,"
it said; "it is the hour to ride."</p>

<p>Like sleep-walkers we moved into the sharp air. Hussin led us
out of an old postern and then through a place like an orchard
to the shelter of some tall evergreen trees. There horses stood,
champing quietly from their nosebags. "Good," I thought; "a feed
of oats before a big effort."</p>

<p>There were nine beasts for nine riders. We mounted without a
word and filed through a grove of trees to where a broken paling
marked the beginning of cultivated land. There for the matter
of twenty minutes Hussin chose to guide us through deep, clogging
snow. He wanted to avoid any sound till we were well beyond earshot
of the house. Then we struck a by-path which presently merged
in a hard highway, running, as I judged, south-west by west. There
we delayed no longer, but galloped furiously into the dark.</p>

<p>I had got back all my exhilaration. Indeed I was intoxicated
with the movement, and could have laughed out loud and sung. Under
the black canopy of the night perils are either forgotten or terribly
alive. Mine were forgotten. The darkness I galloped into led me
to freedom and friends. Yes, and success, which I had not dared
to hope and scarcely even to dream of.</p>

<p>Hussin rode first, with me at his side. I turned my head and
saw Blenkiron behind me, evidently mortally unhappy about the
pace we set and the mount he sat. He used to say that horse-exercise
was good for his liver, but it was a gentle amble and a short
gallop that he liked, and not this mad helter-skelter. His thighs
were too round to fit a saddle leather. We passed a fire in a
hollow, the bivouac of some Turkish unit, and all the horses shied
violently. I knew by Blenkiron’s oaths that he had lost his stirrups
and was sitting on his horse’s neck.</p>

<p>Beside him rode a tall figure swathed to the eyes in wrappings,
and wearing round his neck some kind of shawl whose ends floated
behind him. Sandy, of course, had no European ulster, for it was
months since he had worn proper clothes. I wanted to speak to
him, but somehow I did not dare. His stillness forbade me. He
was a wonderful fine horseman, with his firm English hunting seat,
and it was as well, for he paid no attention to his beast. His
head was still full of unquiet thoughts.</p>

<p>Then the air around me began to smell acrid and raw, and I saw
that a fog was winding up from the hollows.</p>

<p>"Here’s the devil’s own luck," I cried to Hussin. "Can you guide
us in a mist?"</p>

<p>"I do not know." He shook his head. "I had counted on seeing
the shape of the hills."</p>

<p>"We’ve a map and compass, anyhow. But these make slow travelling.
Pray God it lifts!"</p>

<p>Presently the black vapour changed to grey, and the day broke.
It was little comfort. The fog rolled in waves to the horses’
ears, and riding at the head of the party I could but dimly see
the next rank.</p>

<p>"It is time to leave the road," said Hussin, "or we may meet
inquisitive folk."</p>

<p>We struck to the left, over ground which was for all the world
like a Scotch moor. There were pools of rain on it, and masses
of tangled snow-laden junipers, and long reefs of wet slaty stone.
It was bad going, and the fog made it hopeless to steer a good
course. I had out the map and the compass, and tried to fix our
route so as to round the flank of a spur of the mountains which
separated us from the valley we were aiming at.</p>

<p>"There’s a stream ahead of us," I said to Hussin. "Is it fordable?"</p>

<p>"It is only a trickle," he said, coughing. "This accursed mist
is from Eblis." But I knew long before we reached it that it was
no trickle. It was a hill stream coming down in spate, and, as
I soon guessed, in a deep ravine. Presently we were at its edge,
one long whirl of yeasty falls and brown rapids. We could as soon
get horses over it as to the topmost cliffs of the Palantuken.</p>

<p>Hussin stared at it in consternation. "May Allah forgive my folly,
for I should have known. We must return to the highway and find
a bridge. My sorrow, that I should have led my lords so ill."</p>

<p>Back over that moor we went with my spirits badly damped. We
had none too long a start, and Hilda von Einem would rouse heaven
and earth to catch us up. Hussin was forcing the pace, for his
anxiety was as great as mine.</p>

<p>Before we reached the road the mist blew back and revealed a
wedge of country right across to the hills beyond the river. It
was a clear view, every object standing out wet and sharp in the
light of morning. It showed the bridge with horsemen drawn up
across it, and it showed, too, cavalry pickets moving along the
road.</p>

<p>They saw us at the same instant. A word was passed down the road,
a shrill whistle blew, and the pickets put their horses at the
bank and started across the moor.</p>

<p>"Did I not say this mist was from Eblis?" growled Hussin, as
we swung round and galloped back on our tracks. "These cursed
Zaptiehs have seen us, and our road is cut."</p>

<p>I was for trying the stream at all costs, but Hussin pointed
out that it would do us no good. The cavalry beyond the bridge
was moving up the other bank. "There is a path through the hills
that I know, but it must be travelled on foot. If we can increase
our lead and the mist cloaks us, there is yet a chance."</p>

<p>It was a weary business plodding up to the skirts of the hills.
We had the pursuit behind us now, and that put an edge on every
difficulty. There were long banks of broken screes, I remember,
where the snow slipped in wreaths from under our feet. Great boulders
had to be circumvented, and patches of bog, where the streams
from the snows first made contact with the plains, mired us to
our girths. Happily the mist was down again, but this, though
it hindered the chase, lessened the chances of Hussin finding
the path.</p>

<p>He found it nevertheless. There was the gully and the rough mule-track
leading upwards. But there also had been a landslip, quite recent
from the marks. A large scar of raw earth had broken across the
hillside, which with the snow above it looked like a slice cut
out of an iced chocolate-cake.</p>

<p>We stared blankly for a second, till we recognized its hopelessness.</p>

<p>"I’m trying for the crags," I said. "Where there once was a way
another can be found."</p>

<p>"And be picked off at their leisure by these marksmen," said
Hussin grimly. "Look!"</p>

<p>The mist had opened again, and a glance behind showed me the
pursuit closing up on us. They were now less than three hundred
yards off. We turned our horses and made off east-ward along the
skirts of the cliffs.</p>

<p>Then Sandy spoke for the first time. "I don’t know how you fellows
feel, but I’m not going to be taken. There’s nothing much to do
except to find a place and put up a fight. We can sell our lives
dearly."</p>

<p>"That’s about all," said Blenkiron cheerfully. He had suffered
such tortures on that gallop that he welcomed any kind of stationary
fight.</p>

<p>"Serve out the arms," said Sandy.</p>

<p>The Companions all carried rifles slung across their shoulders.
Hussin, from a deep saddle-bag, brought out rifles and bandoliers
for the rest of us. As I laid mine across my saddle-bow I saw
it was a German Mauser of the latest pattern.</p>

<p>"It’s hell-for-leather till we find a place for a stand," said
Sandy. "The game’s against us this time."</p>

<p>Once more we entered the mist, and presently found better going
on a long stretch of even slope. Then came a rise, and on the
crest of it I saw the sun. Presently we dipped into bright daylight
and looked down on a broad glen, with a road winding up it to
a pass in the range. I had expected this. It was one way to the
Palantuken pass, some miles south of the house where we had been
lodged.</p>

<p>And then, as I looked southward, I saw what I had been watching
for for days. A little hill split the valley, and on its top was
a <em>kranz</em> of rocks. It was the <em>castrol</em> of my persistent
dream.</p>

<p>On that I promptly took charge. "There’s our fort," I cried.
"If we once get there we can hold it for a week. Sit down and
ride for it."</p>

<p>We bucketed down that hillside like men possessed, even Blenkiron
sticking on manfully among the twists and turns and slithers.
Presently we were on the road and were racing past marching infantry
and gun teams and empty wagons. I noted that most seemed to be
moving downward and few going up. Hussin screamed some words in
Turkish that secured us a passage, but indeed our crazy speed
left them staring. Out of a corner of my eye I saw that Sandy
had flung off most of his wrappings and seemed to be all a dazzle
of rich colour. But I had thought for nothing except the little
hill, now almost fronting us across the shallow glen.</p>

<p>No horses could breast that steep. We urged them into the hollow,
and then hastily dismounted, humped the packs, and began to struggle
up the side of the <em>castrol</em>. It was strewn with great
boulders, which gave a kind of cover that very soon was needed.
For, snatching a glance back, I saw that our pursuers were on
the road above us and were getting ready to shoot.</p>

<p>At normal times we would have been easy marks, but, fortunately,
wisps and streamers of mist now clung about that hollow. The rest
could fend for themselves, so I stuck to Blenkiron and dragged
him, wholly breathless, by the least exposed route. Bullets spattered
now and then against the rocks, and one sang unpleasantly near
my head. In this way we covered three-fourths of the distance,
and had only the bare dozen yards where the gradient eased off
up to the edge of the <em>kranz</em>.</p>

<p>Blenkiron got hit in the leg, our only casualty. There was nothing
for it but to carry him, so I swung him on my shoulders, and with
a bursting heart did that last lap. It was hottish work, and the
bullets were pretty thick about us, but we all got safely to the
<em>kranz</em>, and a short scramble took us over the edge. I
laid Blenkiron inside the <em>castrol</em> and started to prepare
our defence.</p>

<p>We had little time to do it. Out of the thin fog figures were
coming, crouching in cover. The place we were in was a natural
redoubt, except that there were no loopholes or sandbags. We had
to show our heads over the rim to shoot, but the danger was lessened
by the superb field of fire given by those last dozen yards of
glacis. I posted the men and waited, and Blenkiron, with a white
face, insisted on taking his share, announcing that he used to
be handy with a gun.</p>

<p>I gave the order that no man was to shoot till the enemy had
come out of the rocks on to the glacis. The thing ran right round
the top, and we had to watch all sides to prevent them getting
us in flank or rear. Hussin’s rifle cracked out presently from
the back, so my precautions had not been needless.</p>

<p>We were all three fair shots, though none of us up to Peter’s
miraculous standard, and the Companions, too, made good practice.
The Mauser was the weapon I knew best, and I didn’t miss much.
The attackers never had a chance, for their only hope was to rush
us by numbers, and, the whole party being not above two dozen,
they were far too few. I think we killed three, for their bodies
were left lying, and wounded at least six, while the rest fell
back towards the road. In a quarter of an hour it was all over.</p>

<p>"They are dogs of Kurds," I heard Hussin say fiercely. "Only
a Kurdish <em>giaour</em> would fire on the livery of the Kaába."</p>

<p>Then I had a good look at Sandy. He had discarded shawls and
wrappings, and stood up in the strangest costume man ever wore
in battle. Somehow he had procured field-boots and an old pair
of riding-breeches. Above these, reaching well below his middle,
he had a wonderful silken jibbah or ephod of a bright emerald.
I call it silk, but it was like no silk I have ever known, so
exquisite in the mesh, with such a sheen and depth in it. Some
strange pattern was woven on the breast, which in the dim light
I could not trace. I’ll warrant no rarer or costlier garment was
ever exposed to lead on a bleak winter hill.</p>

<p>Sandy seemed unconscious of his garb. His eye, listless no more,
scanned the hollow. "That’s only the overture," he cried. "The
opera will soon begin. We must put a breastwork up in these gaps
or they’ll pick us off from a thousand yards."</p>

<p>I had meantime roughly dressed Blenkiron’s wound with a linen
rag which Hussin provided. It was from a ricochet bullet which
had chipped into his left shin. Then I took a hand with the others
in getting up earthworks to complete the circuit of the defence.
It was no easy job, for we wrought only with our knives and had
to dig deep down below the snowy gravel. As we worked I took stock
of our refuge.</p>

<p>The <em>castrol</em> was a rough circle about ten yards in diameter,
its interior filled with boulders and loose stones, and its parapet
about four feet high. The mist had cleared for a considerable
space, and I could see the immediate surroundings. West, beyond
the hollow, was the road we had come, where now the remnants of
the pursuit were clustered. North, the hill fell steeply to the
valley bottom, but to the south, after a dip there was a ridge
which shut the view. East lay another fork of the stream, the
chief fork I guessed, and it was evidently followed by the main
road to the pass, for I saw it crowded with transport. The two
roads seemed to converge somewhere farther south of my sight.</p>

<p>I guessed we could not be very far from the front, for the noise
of guns sounded very near, both the sharp crack of the field-pieces,
and the deeper boom of the howitzers. More, I could hear the chatter
of the machine-guns, a magpie note among the baying of hounds.
I even saw the bursting of Russian shells, evidently trying to
reach the main road. One big fellow—an eight-inch—landed not ten
yards from a convoy to the east of us, and another in the hollow
through which we had come. These were clearly ranging shots, and
I wondered if the Russians had observation-posts on the heights
to mark them. If so, they might soon try a curtain, and we should
be very near its edge. It would be an odd irony if we were the
target of friendly shells.</p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry," I heard Sandy say, "if we had a brace of
machine-guns we could hold this place against a division."</p>

<p>"What price shells?" I asked. "If they get a gun up they can
blow us to atoms in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Please God the Russians keep them too busy for that," was his
answer.</p>

<p>With anxious eyes I watched our enemies on the road. They seemed
to have grown in numbers. They were signalling, too, for a white
flag fluttered. Then the mist rolled down on us again, and our
prospect was limited to ten yards of vapour.</p>

<p>"Steady," I cried; "they may try to rush us at any moment. Every
man keep his eye on the edge of the fog, and shoot at the first
sign."</p>

<p>For nearly half an hour by my watch we waited in that queer white
world, our eyes smarting with the strain of peering. The sound
of the guns seemed to be hushed, and everything grown deathly
quiet. Blenkiron’s squeal, as he knocked his wounded leg against
a rock, made every man start.</p>

<p>Then out of the mist there came a voice.</p>

<p>It was a woman’s voice, high, penetrating, and sweet, but it
spoke in no tongue I knew. Only Sandy understood. He made a sudden
movement as if to defend himself against a blow.</p>

<p>The speaker came into clear sight on the glacis a yard or two
away. Mine was the first face she saw.</p>

<p>"I come to offer terms," she said in English. "Will you permit
me to enter?"</p>

<p>I could do nothing except take off my cap and say, "Yes, ma’am."</p>

<p>Blenkiron, snuggled up against the parapet, was cursing furiously
below his breath.</p>

<p>She climbed up the <em>kranz</em> and stepped over the edge as
lightly as a deer. Her clothes were strange—spurred boots and
breeches over which fell a short green kirtle. A little cap skewered
with a jewelled pin was on her head, and a cape of some coarse
country cloth hung from her shoulders. She had rough gauntlets
on her hands, and she carried for weapon a riding-whip. The fog-crystals
clung to her hair, I remember, and a silvery film of fog lay on
her garments.</p>

<p>I had never before thought of her as beautiful. Strange, uncanny,
wonderful, if you like, but the word beauty had too kindly and
human a sound for such a face. But as she stood with heightened
colour, her eyes like stars, her poise like a wild bird’s, I had
to confess that she had her own loveliness. She might be a devil,
but she was also a queen. I considered that there might be merits
in the prospect of riding by her side into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Sandy stood rigid, his face very grave and set. She held out
both hands to him, speaking softly in Turkish. I noticed that
the six Companions had disappeared from the <em>castrol</em> and
were somewhere out of sight on the farther side.</p>

<p>I do not know what she said, but from her tone, and above all
from her eyes, I judged that she was pleading—pleading for his
return, for his partnership in her great adventure; pleading,
for all I knew, for his love.</p>

<p>His expression was like a death-mask, his brows drawn tight in
a little frown and his jaw rigid.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, "I ask you to tell your business quick and
to tell it in English. My friends must hear it as well as me."</p>

<p>"Your friends!" she cried. "What has a prince to do with these
hirelings? Your slaves, perhaps, but not your friends."</p>

<p>"My friends," Sandy repeated grimly. "You must know, Madam, that
I am a British officer."</p>

<p>That was beyond doubt a clean staggering stroke. What she had
thought of his origin God knows, but she had never dreamed of
this. Her eyes grew larger and more lustrous, her lips parted
as if to speak, but her voice failed her. Then by an effort she
recovered herself, and out of that strange face went all the glow
of youth and ardour. It was again the unholy mask I had first
known.</p>

<p>"And these others?" she asked in a level voice.</p>

<p>"One is a brother officer of my regiment. The other is an American
friend. But all three of us are on the same errand. We came east
to destroy Greenmantle and your devilish ambitions. You have yourself
destroyed your prophets, and now it is your turn to fail and disappear.
Make no mistake, Madam; that folly is over. I will tear this sacred
garment into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the wind. The
people wait today for the revelation, but none will come. You
may kill us if you can, but we have at least crushed a lie and
done service to our country."</p>

<p>I would not have taken my eyes from her face for a king’s ransom.
I have written that she was a queen, and of that there is no manner
of doubt. She had the soul of a conqueror, for not a flicker of
weakness or disappointment marred her air. Only pride and the
stateliest resolution looked out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"I said I came to offer terms. I will still offer them, though
they are other than I thought. For the fat American, I will send
him home safely to his own country. I do not make war on such
as he. He is Germany’s foe, not mine. You," she said, turning
fiercely on me, "I will hang before dusk."</p>

<p>Never in my life had I been so pleased. I had got my revenge
at last. This woman had singled me out above the others as the
object of her wrath, and I almost loved her for it.</p>

<p>She turned to Sandy, and the fierceness went out of her face.</p>

<p>"You seek the truth," she said. "So also do I, and if we use
a lie it is only to break down a greater. You are of my household
in spirit, and you alone of all men I have seen are fit to ride
with me on my mission. Germany may fail, but I shall not fail.
I offer you the greatest career that mortal has known. I offer
you a task which will need every atom of brain and sinew and courage.
Will you refuse that destiny?"</p>

<p>I do not know what effect this vapouring might have had in hot
scented rooms, or in the languor of some rich garden; but up on
that cold hill-top it was as unsubstantial as the mist around
us. It sounded not even impressive, only crazy.</p>

<p>"I stay with my friends," said Sandy.</p>

<p>"Then I will offer more. I will save your friends. They, too,
shall share in my triumph."</p>

<p>This was too much for Blenkiron. He scrambled to his feet to
speak the protest that had been wrung from his soul, forgot his
game leg, and rolled back on the ground with a groan.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to make a last appeal. She spoke in Turkish now,
and I do not know what she said, but I judged it was the plea
of a woman to her lover. Once more she was the proud beauty, but
there was a tremor in her pride—I had almost written tenderness.
To listen to her was like horrid treachery, like eavesdropping
on something pitiful. I know my cheeks grew scarlet and Blenkiron
turned away his head.</p>

<p>Sandy’s face did not move. He spoke in English.</p>

<p>"You can offer me nothing that I desire," he said. "I am the
servant of my country, and her enemies are mine. I can have neither
part nor lot with you. That is my answer, Madam von Einem."</p>

<p>Then her steely restraint broke. It was like a dam giving before
a pent-up mass of icy water. She tore off one of her gauntlets
and hurled it in his face. Implacable hate looked out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"I have done with you," she cried. "You have scorned me, but
you have dug your own grave."</p>

<p>She leaped on the parapet and the next second was on the glacis.
Once more the mist had fled, and across the hollow I saw a field-gun
in place and men around it who were not Turkish. She waved her
hand to them, and hastened down the hillside.</p>

<p>But at that moment I heard the whistle of a long-range Russian
shell. Among the boulders there was the dull shock of an explosion
and a mushroom of red earth. It all passed in an instant of time:
I saw the gunners on the road point their hands and I heard them
cry; I heard too, a kind of sob from Blenkiron—all this before
I realized myself what had happened. The next thing I saw was
Sandy, already beyond the glacis, leaping with great bounds down
the hill. They were shooting at him, but he heeded them not. For
the space of a minute he was out of sight, and his whereabouts
was shown only by the patter of bullets.</p>

<p>Then he came back—walking quite slowly up the last slope, and
he was carrying something in his arms. The enemy fired no more;
they realized what had happened.</p>

<p>He laid his burden down gently in a corner of the <em>castrol</em>.
The cap had fallen off, and the hair was breaking loose. The face
was very white but there was no wound or bruise on it.</p>

<p>"She was killed at once," I heard him saying. "Her back was broken
by a shell-fragment. Dick, we must bury her here ... You see,
she ... she liked me. I can make her no return but this."</p>

<p>We set the Companions to guard, and with infinite slowness, using
our hands and our knives, we made a shallow grave below the eastern
parapet. When it was done we covered her face with the linen cloak
which Sandy had worn that morning. He lifted the body and laid
it reverently in its place.</p>

<p>"I did not know that anything could be so light," he said.</p>

<p>It wasn’t for me to look on at that kind of scene. I went to
the parapet with Blenkiron’s field-glasses and had a stare at
our friends on the road. There was no Turk there, and I guessed
why, for it would not be easy to use the men of Islam against
the wearer of the green ephod. The enemy were German or Austrian,
and they had a field-gun. They seemed to have got it laid on our
fort; but they were waiting. As I looked I saw behind them a massive
figure I seemed to recognize. Stumm had come to see the destruction
of his enemies.</p>

<p>To the east I saw another gun in the fields just below the main
road. They had got us on both sides, and there was no way of escape.
Hilda von Einem was to have a noble pyre and goodly company for
the dark journey.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling now, a clear bright dusk where the stars pricked
through a sheen of amethyst. The artillery were busy all around
the horizon, and towards the pass on the other road, where Fort
Palantuken stood, there was the dust and smoke of a furious bombardment.
It seemed to me, too, that the guns on the other fronts had come
nearer. Deve Boyun was hidden by a spur of hill, but up in the
north, white clouds, like the streamers of evening, were hanging
over the Euphrates glen. The whole firmament hummed and twanged
like a taut string that has been struck ...</p>

<p>As I looked, the gun to the west fired—the gun where Stumm was.
The shell dropped ten yards to our right. A second later another
fell behind us.</p>

<p>Blenkiron had dragged himself to the parapet. I don’t suppose
he had ever been shelled before, but his face showed curiosity
rather than fear.</p>

<p>"Pretty poor shooting, I reckon," he said.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I said, "they know their business. They’re
bracketing ..."</p>

<p>The words were not out of my mouth when one fell right among
us. It struck the far rim of the <em>castrol</em>, shattering
the rock, but bursting mainly outside. We all ducked, and barring
some small scratches no one was a penny the worse. I remember
that much of the debris fell on Hilda von Einem’s grave.</p>

<p>I pulled Blenkiron over the far parapet, and called on the rest
to follow, meaning to take cover on the rough side of the hill.
But as we showed ourselves shots rang out from our front, shots
fired from a range of a few hundred yards. It was easy to see
what had happened. Riflemen had been sent to hold us in rear.
They would not assault so long as we remained in the <em>castrol</em>,
but they would block any attempt to find safety outside it. Stumm
and his gun had us at their mercy.</p>

<p>We crouched below the parapet again. "We may as well toss for
it," I said. "There’s only two ways—to stay here and be shelled
or try to break through those fellows behind. Either’s pretty
unhealthy."</p>

<p>But I knew there was no choice. With Blenkiron crippled we were
pinned to the <em>castrol</em>. Our numbers were up all right.</p>
