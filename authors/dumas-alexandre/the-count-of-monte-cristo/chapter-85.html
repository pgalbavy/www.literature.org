<P>Monte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the
young men together. &quot;Ah, ha!&quot; said he, &quot;I hope all is over,
explained and settled.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Beauchamp; &quot;the absurd reports have died away,
and should they be renewed, I would be the first to oppose
them; so let us speak no more of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Albert will tell you,&quot; replied the count &quot;that I gave him
the same advice. Look,&quot; added he. &quot;I am finishing the most
execrable morning's work.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; said Albert; &quot;arranging your papers,
apparently.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My papers, thank God, no,  -  my papers are all in capital
order, because I have none; but M. Cavalcanti's.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. Cavalcanti's?&quot; asked Beauchamp.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; do you not know that this is a young man whom the
count is introducing?&quot; said Morcerf.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us not misunderstand each other,&quot; replied Monte Cristo;
&quot;I introduce my one, and certainly not M. Cavalcanti.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And who,&quot; said Albert with a forced smile, &quot;is to marry
Mademoiselle Danglars instead of me, which grieves me
cruelly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What? Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?&quot;
asked Beauchamp.</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly; do you come from the end of the world?&quot; said
Monte Cristo; &quot;you, a journalist, the husband of renown? It
is the talk of all Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you, count, have made this match?&quot; asked Beauchamp.</P>
<P>&quot;I? Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report.
I make a match? No, you do not know me; I have done all in
my power to oppose it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, I understand,&quot; said Beauchamp, &quot;on our friend Albert's
account.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On my account?&quot; said the young man; &quot;oh, no, indeed, the
count will do me the justice to assert that I have, on the
contrary, always entreated him to break off my engagement,
and happily it is ended. The count pretends I have not him
to thank;  -  so be it  -  I will erect an altar Deo ignoto.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen,&quot; said Monte Cristo; &quot;I have had little to do with
it, for I am at variance both with the father-in-law and the
young man; there is only Mademoiselle Eugenie, who appears
but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony, and who,
seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her to renounce
her dear liberty, retains any affection for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And do you say this wedding is at hand?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, yes, in spite of all I could say. I do not know the
young man; he is said to be of good family and rich, but I
never trust to vague assertions. I have warned M. Danglars
of it till I am tired, but he is fascinated with his
Luccanese. I have even informed him of a circumstance I
consider very serious; the young man was either charmed by
his nurse, stolen by gypsies, or lost by his tutor, I
scarcely know which. But I do know his father lost sight of
him for more than ten years; what he did during these ten
years, God only knows. Well, all that was useless. They have
commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers, and
here they are. I send them, but like Pilate  -  washing my
hands.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what does Mademoiselle d'Armilly say to you for robbing
her of her pupil?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, well, I don't know; but I understand that she is going
to Italy. Madame Danglars asked me for letters of
recommendation for the impresari; I gave her a few lines for
the director of the Valle Theatre, who is under some
obligation to me. But what is the matter, Albert? you look
dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with
Mademoiselle Eugenie?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am not aware of it,&quot; said Albert, smiling sorrowfully.
Beauchamp turned to look at some paintings. &quot;But,&quot; continued
Monte Cristo, &quot;you are not in your usual spirits?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have a dreadful headache,&quot; said Albert.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my dear viscount,&quot; said Monte Cristo, &quot;I have an
infallible remedy to propose to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked the young man.</P>
<P>&quot;A change.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Albert.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; and as I am just now excessively annoyed, I shall go
from home. Shall we go together?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You annoyed, count?&quot; said Beauchamp; &quot;and by what?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, you think very lightly of it; I should like to see you
with a brief preparing in your house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What brief?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable
assassin  -  some brigand escaped from the gallows
apparently.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True,&quot; said Beauchamp; &quot;I saw it in the paper. Who is this
Caderousse?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Some provincial, it appears. M. de Villefort heard of him
at Marseilles, and M. Danglars recollects having seen him.
Consequently, the procureur is very active in the affair,
and the prefect of police very much interested; and, thanks
to that interest, for which I am very grateful, they send me
all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood, under
pretence of their being Caderousse's murderers, so that in
three months, if this continue, every robber and assassin in
France will have the plan of my house at his fingers' end. I
am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of
the earth, and shall be happy if you will accompany me,
viscount.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Willingly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then it is settled?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but where?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound
soothes, where one is sure to be humbled, however proud may
be his nature. I love that humiliation, I, who am master of
the universe, as was Augustus.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But where are you really going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To sea, viscount; you know I am a sailor. I was rocked when
an infant in the arms of old ocean, and on the bosom of the
beautiful Amphitrite; I have sported with the green mantle
of the one and the azure robe of the other; I love the sea
as a mistress, and pine if I do not often see her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go, count.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To sea?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You accept my proposal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Viscount, there will be in my court-yard this evening
a good travelling britzka, with four post-horses, in which
one may rest as in a bed. M. Beauchamp, it holds four very
well, will you accompany us?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, I have just returned from sea.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What? you have been to sea?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean
Islands.&quot;*</P>
<UL><LI><P>Lake Maggiore.</P>
</UL><P>&quot;What of that? come with us,&quot; said Albert.</P>
<P>&quot;No, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is
impossible. Besides, it is important,&quot; added he in a low
tone, &quot;that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the
paper.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, you are a good and an excellent friend,&quot; said Albert;
&quot;yes, you are right; watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to
discover the enemy who made this disclosure.&quot; Albert and
Beauchamp parted, the last pressure of their hands
expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger.</P>
<P>&quot;Beauchamp is a worthy fellow,&quot; said Monte Cristo, when the
journalist was gone; &quot;is he not, Albert?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly. But now we
are alone,  -  although it is immaterial to me,  -  where are
we going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Into Normandy, if you like.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Delightful; shall we be quite retired? have no society, no
neighbors?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Our companions will be riding-horses, dogs to hunt with,
and a fishing-boat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Exactly what I wish for; I will apprise my mother of my
intention, and return to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I may go where I please.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I am aware you may go alone, since I once met you in
Italy  -  but to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You forget, count, that I have often told you of the deep
interest my mother takes in you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;`Woman is fickle.' said Francis I.; `woman is like a wave
of the sea,' said Shakespeare; both the great king and the
great poet ought to have known woman's nature well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Woman's, yes; my mother is not woman, but a woman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As I am only a humble foreigner, you must pardon me if I do
not understand all the subtle refinements of your language.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What I mean to say is, that my mother is not quick to give
her confidence, but when she does she never changes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, yes, indeed,&quot; said Monte Cristo with a sigh; &quot;and do
you think she is in the least interested in me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I repeat it, you must really be a very strange and superior
man, for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have
excited, that when I am with her she speaks of no one else.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And does she try to make you dislike me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, she often says, `Morcerf, I believe the
count has a noble nature; try to gain his esteem.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Monte Cristo, sighing.</P>
<P>&quot;You see, then,&quot; said Albert, &quot;that instead of opposing, she
will encourage me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Adieu, then, until five o'clock; be punctual, and we shall
arrive at twelve or one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Treport?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; or in the neighborhood.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Easily,&quot; said Monte Cristo.</P>
<P>&quot;You are certainly a prodigy; you will soon not only surpass
the railway, which would not be very difficult in France,
but even the telegraph.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, viscount, since we cannot perform the journey in less
than seven or eight hours, do not keep me waiting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not fear, I have little to prepare.&quot; Monte Cristo smiled
as he nodded to Albert, then remained a moment absorbed in
deep meditation. But passing his hand across his forehead as
if to dispel his revery, he rang the bell twice and
Bertuccio entered. &quot;Bertuccio,&quot; said he, &quot;I intend going
this evening to Normandy, instead of to-morrow or the next
day. You will have sufficient time before five o'clock;
despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first
station. M. de Morcerf will accompany me.&quot; Bertuccio obeyed
and despatched a courier to Pontoise to say the
travelling-carriage would arrive at six o'clock. From
Pontoise another express was sent to the next stage, and in
six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready.
Before his departure, the count went to Haidee's apartments,
told her his intention, and resigned everything to her care.
Albert was punctual. The journey soon became interesting
from its rapidity, of which Morcerf had formed no previous
idea. &quot;Truly,&quot; said Monte Cristo, &quot;with your posthorses
going at the rate of two leagues an hour, and that absurd
law that one traveller shall not pass another without
permission, so that an invalid or ill-tempered traveller may
detain those who are well and active, it is impossible to
move; I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own
postilion and horses; do I not, Ali?&quot;</P>
<P>The count put his head out of the window and whistled, and
the horses appeared to fly. The carriage rolled with a
thundering noise over the pavement, and every one turned to
notice the dazzling meteor. Ali, smiling, repeated the
sound, grasped the reins with a firm hand, and spurred his
horses, whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze. This
child of the desert was in his element, and with his black
face and sparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he
raised, like the genius of the simoom and the god of the
hurricane. &quot;I never knew till now the delight of speed,&quot;
said Morcerf, and the last cloud disappeared from his brow;
&quot;but where the devil do you get such horses? Are they made
to order?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely,&quot; said the count; &quot;six years since I bought a
horse in Hungary remarkable for its swiftness. The
thirty-two that we shall use to-night are its progeny; they
are all entirely black, with the exception of a star upon
the forehead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count,
with all these horses?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see, I travel with them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you are not always travelling.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I no longer require them, Bertuccio will sell them,
and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by
the sale.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier, who will
empty his coffers to purchase them, and refill them by
applying the bastinado to his subjects.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Count, may I suggest one idea to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is that, next to you, Bertuccio must be the richest
gentleman in Europe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are mistaken, viscount; I believe he has not a franc in
his possession.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then he must be a wonder. My dear count, if you tell me
many more marvellous things, I warn you I shall not believe
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I countenance nothing that is marvellous, M. Albert. Tell
me, why does a steward rob his master?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because, I suppose, it is his nature to do so, for the love
of robbing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are mistaken; it is because he has a wife and family,
and ambitious desires for himself and them. Also because he
is not sure of always retaining his situation, and wishes to
provide for the future. Now, M. Bertuccio is alone in the
world; he uses my property without accounting for the use he
makes of it; he is sure never to leave my service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I should never get a better.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Probabilities are deceptive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I deal in certainties; he is the best servant over whom
one has the power of life and death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you possess that right over Bertuccio?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>There are words which close a conversation with an iron
door; such was the count's &quot;yes.&quot; The whole journey was
performed with equal rapidity; the thirty-two horses,
dispersed over seven stages, brought them to their
destination in eight hours. At midnight they arrived at the
gate of a beautiful park. The porter was in attendance; he
had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the
count's approach. At half past two in the morning Morcerf
was conducted to his apartments, where a bath and supper
were prepared. The servant who had travelled at the back of
the carriage waited on him; Baptistin, who rode in front,
attended the count. Albert bathed, took his supper, and went
to bed. All night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of
the surf. On rising, he went to his window, which opened on
a terrace, having the sea in front, and at the back a pretty
park bounded by a small forest. In a creek lay a little
sloop, with a narrow keel and high masts, bearing on its
flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain on a sea
azure, with a cross gules on the shield. Around the schooner
lay a number of small fishing-boats belonging to the
fishermen of the neighboring village, like humble subjects
awaiting orders from their queen. There, as in every spot
where Monte Cristo stopped, if but for two days, luxury
abounded and life went on with the utmost ease.</P>
<P>Albert found in his anteroom two guns, with all the
accoutrements for hunting; a lofty room on the ground-floor
containing all the ingenious instruments the English  - 
eminent in piscatory pursuits, since they are patient and
sluggish  -  have invented for fishing. The day passed in
pursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled.
They killed a dozen pheasants in the park, as many trout in
the stream, dined in a summer-house overlooking the ocean,
and took tea in the library.</P>
<P>Towards the evening of the third day. Albert, completely
exhausted with the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo,
was sleeping in an arm-chair near the window, while the
count was designing with his architect the plan of a
conservatory in his house, when the sound of a horse at full
speed on the high road made Albert look up. He was
disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom
he had not brought, that he might not inconvenience Monte
Cristo.</P>
<P>&quot;Florentin here!&quot; cried he, starting up; &quot;is my mother ill?&quot;
And he hastened to the door. Monte Cristo watched and saw
him approach the valet, who drew a small sealed parcel from
his pocket, containing a newspaper and a letter. &quot;From whom
is this?&quot; said he eagerly. &quot;From M. Beauchamp,&quot; replied
Florentin.</P>
<P>&quot;Did he send you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my
journey, procured a horse, and made me promise not to stop
till I had reached you, I have come in fifteen hours.&quot;</P>
<P>Albert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on
reading the first line, and seized the paper. His sight was
dimmed, his legs sank under him, and he would have fallen
had not Florentin supported him.</P>
<P>&quot;Poor young man,&quot; said Monte Cristo in a low voice; &quot;it is
then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the
children to the third and fourth generation.&quot; Meanwhile
Albert had revived, and, continuing to read, he threw back
his head, saying, &quot;Florentin, is your horse fit to return
immediately?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is a poor lame post-horse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what state was the house when you left?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All was quiet, but on returning from M. Beauchamp's, I
found madame in tears: she had sent for me to know when you
would return. I told her my orders from M. Beauchamp; she
first extended her arms to prevent me, but after a moment's
reflection, `Yes, go, Florentin,' said she, `and may he come
quickly.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my mother,&quot; said Albert, &quot;I will return, and woe to
the infamous wretch! But first of all I must get there.&quot;</P>
<P>He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo.
Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation
in his appearance. His voice had become rough and hoarse;
his face was furrowed with wrinkles; his eyes burned under
the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a drunken man.
&quot;Count,&quot; said he, &quot;I thank you for your hospitality, which I
would gladly have enjoyed longer; but I must return to
Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What has happened?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A great misfortune, more important to me than life. Don't
question me, I beg of you, but lend me a horse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill
yourself by riding on horseback. Take a post-chaise or a
carriage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, it would delay me, and I need the fatigue you warn me
of; it will do me good.&quot; Albert reeled as if he had been
shot, and fell on a chair near the door. Monte Cristo did
not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion; he
was at the window, calling, &quot;Ali, a horse for M. de Morcerf
 -  quick! he is in a hurry!&quot; These words restored Albert; he
darted from the room, followed by the count. &quot;Thank you!&quot;
cried he, throwing himself on his horse. &quot;Return as soon as
you can, Florentin. Must I use any password to procure a
horse?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only dismount; another will be immediately saddled.&quot; Albert
hesitated a moment. &quot;You may think my departure strange and
foolish,&quot; said the young man; &quot;you do not know how a
paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one. Read that,&quot;
said he, &quot;when I am gone, that you may not be witness of my
anger.&quot;</P>
<P>While the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his
horse, which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual
stimulus, and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow. The
count watched him with a feeling of compassion, and when he
had completely disappeared, read as follows:  - </P>
<P>&quot;The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina
alluded to three weeks since in the Impartial, who not only
surrendered the castle of Yanina, but sold his benefactor to
the Turks, styled himself truly at that time Fernand, as our
esteemed contemporary states; but he has since added to his
Christian name a title of nobility and a family name. He now
calls himself the Count of Morcerf, and ranks among the
peers.&quot;</P>
<P>Thus the terrible secret, which Beauchamp had so generously
destroyed, appeared again like an armed phantom; and another
paper, deriving its information from some malicious source,
had published two days after Albert's departure for Normandy
the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man
almost crazy.</P></article>
