<p>These sympathetic women had unanimously set their expectation
in so romantically pessimistic a groove that the most tragic news
of Noble would have surprised them little. But if the truth of
his whereabouts could have been made known to them, as they sat
thus together at what was developing virtually into his wake,
with Herbert as a compulsory participant, they would have turned
the session into a riot of amazement. Noble was in the very last
place (they would have said, when calmer) where anybody in the
world could have even madly dreamed of looking for him! They would
have been right about it. No one could have expected to find Noble
to-night inside the old, four-square brick house of H. I. Atwater,
Senior, chief of the Atwaters and father of too gentle Julia.
Moreover, Mr. Atwater himself was not at present in the house;
he had closed and locked it the day before, giving the servants
a week's vacation and telling them not to return till he sent
for them; and he had then gone out of town to look over a hominy-mill
he thought of buying. And yet, as the wake went on, there was
a light in the house, and under that light sat Noble Dill.</p>

<p>Returning home, after Florence had placed the shattering paper
within his hand, Noble had changed his shoes and his tie. He was
but a mechanism; he had no motive. The shoes he put on were no
better than those he took off; the fresh tie was no lovelier than
the one he had worn; nor had it even the lucidity to be a purple
one, as the banner of grief. No; his action was, if so viewed,
"crazy," as Aunt Fanny had called it. Agitation first took this
form; that was all. Love and change of dress are so closely allied;
and in happier days, when Noble had come home from work and would
see Julia in the evening, he usually changed his clothes. No doubt
there is some faint tracery here, probably too indistinct to repay
contemplation.</p>

<p>When he left the house he walked rapidly downtown, and toward
the end of this one-mile journey he ran; but as he was then approaching
the railway station, no one thought him eccentric. He was, however,
for when he entered the station he went to a bench and sat looking
upward for more than ten minutes before he rose, went to a ticket
window and asked for a time-table.</p>

<p>"What road?" the clerk inquired.</p>

<p>"All points South," said Noble.</p>

<p>He placed the time-table, still folded, in his pocket, rested
an elbow on the brass apron of the window, and would have given
himself up to reflections, though urged to move away. Several
people, wishing to buy tickets, had formed a line behind him;
they perceived that Noble had nothing more to say to the clerk,
and the latter encouraged their protests, even going so far as
to inquire: "For heaven's sakes, can't you let these folk buy
their tickets?" And since Noble still did not move: "My gosh,
haven't you got no <em>feet</em>?"</p>

<p>"Feet? Oh, yes," said Noble gently. "I'm going away." And went
back to his seat.</p>

<p>Afterwhile, he sought to study his time-table. Ordinarily, his
mind was one of those able to decipher and comprehend railway
time-tables; he had few gifts, but this was one of them. It failed
him now; so he wandered back to the ticket-window, and, after
urgent coaching, eventually took his place at the end instead
of at the head of the line that waited there. In his turn he came
again to the window, and departed from it after a conversation
with the clerk that left the latter in accord with Aunt Fanny
Atwater's commiserating adjective, though the clerk's own pity
was expressed in argot. "The poor nut!" he explained to his next
client. "Wants to buy a ticket on a train that don't pull out
until ten thirty-five to-night; and me fillin' it all out, stampin'
it and everything, what for? Turned out all his pockets and couldn't
come within eight dollars o' the price! Where you want to go?"</p>

<p>Noble went back to his bench and sat there for a long time, though
there was no time, long or short, for him. He was not yet consciously
suffering; nor was he thinking at all. True, he had a dim, persistent
impulse to action&mdash;or why should he be at the station?&mdash;but for
the clearest expression of his condition it is necessary to borrow
a culinary symbol; he was jelling. But the state of shock was
slowly dispersing, while a perception of approaching anguish as
slowly increased. He was beginning to swallow nothing at intervals
and the intervals were growing shorter.</p>

<p>Dusk was misting down, outdoors, when with dragging steps he
came out of the station. He looked hazily up and down the street,
where the corner-lamps and shop-windows now were lighted; and,
after dreary hesitation, he went in search of a pawn-shop, and
found one. The old man who operated it must have been a philanthropist,
for Noble was so fortunate as to secure a loan of nine dollars
upon his watch. Surprised at this, he returned to the station,
and went back to the same old bench.</p>

<p>It was fully occupied, and he stood for some time looking with
vague reproach at the large family of coloured people who had
taken it. He had a feeling that he lived there and that these
coloured people were trespassers; but upon becoming aware that
part of an orange was being rubbed over his left shoe by the youngest
of the children, he groaned abruptly and found another bench.</p>

<p>A little after six o'clock a clanging and commotion in the train-shed
outside, attending the arrival of a "through express," stirred
him from his torpor, and he walked heavily across the room to
the same ticket-window he had twice blocked; but there was no
queue attached to it now. He rested his elbow upon the apron and
his chin upon his hand, while the clerk waited until he should
state his wishes. This was a new clerk, who had just relieved
the other.</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" he said at last.</p>

<p>"I'll take it now," Noble responded.</p>

<p>"What'll you take now?"</p>

<p>"That ticket."</p>

<p>"What ticket?"</p>

<p>"The same one I wanted before," Noble sighed.</p>

<p>The clerk gave him a piercing look, glanced out of the window
and saw that there were no other clients, then went to a desk
at the farther end of his compartment, and took up some clerical
work he had in hand.</p>

<p>Noble leaned upon the apron of the window, waiting; and if he
thought anything, he thought the man was serving him.</p>

<p>The high, vaulted room became resonant with voices and the blurred
echoes of mingling footsteps on the marble floor, as passengers
from the express hurried anxiously to the street, or more gaily
straggled through, shouting with friends who came to greet them;
and among these moving groups there walked a youthful fine lady
noticeably enlivening to the dullest eye. She was preceded by
a brisk porter who carried two travelling-bags of a rich sort,
as well as a sack of implements for the game of golf; and she
was warm in dark furs, against which the vasty clump of violets
she wore showed dewy gleamings of blue.</p>

<p>At sight of Noble Dill, more than pensive at the ticket-window,
she hesitated, then stopped and observed him. That she should
observe anybody was in a way a coincidence, for, as it happened,
she was herself the most observed person in all the place. She
was veiled in two veils, but she had been seen in the train without
these, and some of her fellow-travellers, though strangers to
her, were walking near her in a hypocritical way, hoping still
not to lose sight of her, even veiled. And although the shroudings
permitted the most meagre information of her features, what they
did reveal was harmfully piquant; moreover, there was a sweetness
of figure, a disturbing grace; while nothing could disguise her
air of wearing that many violets casually as a daily perquisite
and matter of course.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>"He stared at her. His elbow sagged away from
the window; the whole person of Noble Dill seemed near collapse."</em>]</p>

<p>So this observed lady stopped and observed Noble, who in return
observed her not at all, being but semi-conscious. Looked upon
thoughtfully, it is a coincidence that we breathe; certainly it
is a mighty coincidence that we speak to one another and comprehend;
for these are true marvels. But what petty interlacings of human
action so pique our sense of the theatrical that we call them
coincidences and are astonished! That Julia should arrive during
Noble's long process of buying a ticket to go to her was stranger
than that she stopped to look at him, though still not comparable
in strangeness to the fact that either of them, or any living
creature, stood upon the whirling earth;&mdash;yet when Noble Dill
comprehended what was happening he was amazed.</p>

<p>She spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Noble!" she said.</p>

<p>He stared at her. His elbow sagged away from the window; the
whole person of Noble Dill seemed near collapse. He shook; he
had no voice.</p>

<p>"I just this minute got off the train," she said. "Are you going
away somewhere?"</p>

<p>"No," he whispered; then obtained command of a huskiness somewhat
greater in volume. "I'm just standing here."</p>

<p>"I told the porter to get me a taxicab," she said. "If you're
going home for dinner I'll drop you at your house."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;I'</em>m &mdash;<em>I&#11834;" </em>His articulation encountered
unsurmountable difficulties, but Julia had been with him through
many such trials aforetime. She said briskly, "I'm awfully hungry
and I want to get home. Come on&mdash;if you like?"</p>

<p>He walked waveringly at her side through the station, and followed
her into the dim interior of the cab, which became fragrant of
violets&mdash;an emanation at once ineffable and poisonous.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad I happened to run across you," she said, as they
began to vibrate tremulously in unison with the fierce little
engine that drew them. "I want to hear all the news. Nobody knows
I'm home. I didn't write or telegraph to a soul; and I'll be a
complete surprise to father and everybody &mdash;I don't know
how pleasant a one! <em>You</em> didn't seem so frightfully glad
to see me, Noble!"</p>

<p>"Am I?" he whispered. "I mean&mdash;I mean &mdash;I mean: Didn't I?"</p>

<p>"No!" she laughed. "You looked&mdash;you looked shocked! It couldn't
have been because I'm ill or anything, because I'm not; and if
I were you couldn't have told it through these two veils. Possibly
I'd better take your expression as a compliment." She paused,
then asked hesitatingly, "Shall I?"</p>

<p>This was the style for which the Atwaters held Julia responsible;
but they were mistaken: she was never able to control it. Now
she went cheerily on: "Perhaps not, as you don't answer. I shouldn't
be so bold! Do you suppose anybody at all will be glad to see
me?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&#11834;" </em>He seemed to hope that words would
come in their own good time.</p>

<p>"Noble!" she cried. "Don't be so glum!" And she touched his arm
with her muff, a fluffy contact causing within him a short convulsion,
naturally invisible. "Noble, aren't you going to tell me what's
all the news?"</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;some," he managed to inform her. "Some&mdash;some news."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said soothingly. "Get your breath; I can wait.
I hope nothing's wrong in your family, Noble."</p>

<p>"No. Oh, no."</p>

<p>"It isn't just my turning up unexpectedly that's upset you so,
of course," she dared to say. "Naturally, I know better than to
think such a thing as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Julia!" he said. "Oh, Julia!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Noble?"</p>

<p>"Noth-ing," he murmured, disjointing the word.</p>

<p>"How odd you happened to be there at the station," she said,
"just when my train came in! You're sure you weren't going away
anywhere?"</p>

<p>"No; oh, no."</p>

<p>She was thoughtful, then laughed confidentially. "You're the
only person in town that knows I'm home, Noble."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," he said humbly.</p>

<p>She laughed again. "I came all of a sudden&mdash;on an impulse. It's
a little idiotic. I'll tell you all about it, Noble. You see,
ten or twelve days ago I wrote the family a more or less indiscreet
letter. That is, I told them something I wanted them to be discreet
about, and, of course, when I got to thinking it over, I knew
they wouldn't. You see, I wrote them something I wanted them to
keep a secret, but the more I thought about it, the more I saw
I'd better hurry back. Yesterday it got into my head that I'd
better jump on the next train for home!"</p>

<p>She paused, then added, "So I did! About ten or twelve days is
as long as anybody has a right to expect the Atwater family connection
to keep the deadliest kind of a secret, isn't it?" And as he did
not respond, she explained, modestly, "Of course, it wasn't a
very deadly secret; it was really about something of only the
least importance."</p>

<p>The jar of this understatement restored Noble's voice to a sudden
and startling loudness. "'Only the least importance'!" he shouted.
"With a man named Crum!"</p>

<p>"What!" she cried</p>

<p>"Crum!" Noble insisted. "That's exactly what it said his name
was!"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> said his name was?"</p>

<p>"<em>The North End Daily Oriole!</em>"</p>

<p>"What in heaven's name is that?"</p>

<p>"It's the children's paper, Herbert's and Florence's: your own
niece and nephew, Julia! You don't mean you deny it, do you, Julia?"</p>

<p>She was in great confusion: "Do I deny what?"</p>

<p>"That his name's Crum!" Noble said passionately. "That his name's
Crum and that he's a widower and he's been divorced and's got
nobody knows how many children!"</p>

<p>Julia sought to collect herself. "I don't know what you're talking
about," she said. "If you mean that I happened to meet a very
charming man while I was away, and that his name happened to be
Crum, I don't know why I should go to the trouble of denying it.
But if Mr. Crum has had the experiences you say he has, it is
certainly news to me! I think someone told me he was only twenty-six
years old. He looked rather younger."</p>

<p>"You 'think someone told' you!" Noble groaned. "Oh, Julia! And
here it is, all down in black and white, in my pocket!"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about." Julia's
tone was cold, and she drew herself up haughtily, though the gesture
was ineffective in the darkness of that quivering interior. The
quivering stopped just then, however, as the taxicab came to a
rather abrupt halt before her house.</p>

<p>"Will you come in with me a moment, please?" Julia said as she
got out. "There are some things I want to ask you&mdash;and I'm sure
my father hasn't come home from downtown yet. There's no light
in the front part of the house."</p>
