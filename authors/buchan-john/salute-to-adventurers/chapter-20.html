<p>It took us a heavy day's work to get the stockade finished. There
were only the two axes in the party, besides Shalah's tomahawk,
and no one can know the labour of felling and trimming trees tin
he has tried it. We found the horses useful for dragging trunks,
and but for them should have made a poor job of it. Grey's white
hands were all cut and blistered, and, though I boasted of my
hardiness, mine were little better. Ringan was the surprise, for
you would not think that sailing a ship was a good apprenticeship
to forestry. But he was as skilful as Bertrand and as strong as
Donaldson, and he had a better idea of fortification than us all
put together.</p>

<p>The palisade which ran round the camp was six feet high, made
of logs lashed to upright stakes. There was a gate which could
be barred heavily, and loopholes were made every yard or so for
musket fire. On one side&mdash;that facing the uplift of the ridge&mdash;the
walls rose to nine feet. Inside we made a division. In one half
the horses were picketed at night, and the other was our dwelling.</p>

<p>For Elspeth we made a bower in one corner, which we thatched
with pine branches; but the rest of us slept in the open round
the fire. It was a rough place, but a strong one, for our water
could not be cut off, and, as we had plenty of ball and powder,
a few men could hold it against a host. To each was allotted his
proper station, in case of attack, and we kept watch in succession
like soldiers in war. Ringan, who had fought in many places up
and down the world, was our general in these matters, and a rigid
martinet we found him. Shalah was our scout, and we leaned on
him for all woodland work; but inside the palisade Ringan's word
was law.</p>

<p>Our plan was to make this stockade the centre for exploring the
hills and ascertaining the strength and purposes of the Indian
army. We hoped, and so did Shalah, that our enemies would have
no leisure to follow us to the high ridges; that what risk there
was would be run by the men on their spying journeys; but that
the stockade would be reasonably safe. It was my intention, as
soon as I had sufficient news, to send word to Lawrence, and we
thought that presently the Rappahannock forces would have driven
the Cherokees southward, and the way would be open to get Elspeth
back to the Tidewater.</p>

<p>The worst trouble, as I soon saw, was to be the matter of food.
The supplies we had carried were all but finished by what we ate
after the stockade was completed. After that there remained only
a single bag of flour, another bag of Indian meal, and a pound
or two of boucanned beef, besides three flasks of eau-de-vie,
which Ringan had brought in a leather casket. The forest berries
were not yet ripe, and the only food to be procured was the flesh
of the wild game. Happily in Donaldson and Bertrand we had two
practised trappers; but they were doubtful about success, for
they had no knowledge of what beasts lived in the hills. I have
said that we had plenty of powder and ball, but I did not relish
the idea of shooting in the woods, for the noise would be a signal
to our foes. Still, food we must have, and I thought I might find
a secluded place where the echoes of a shot would be muffled.</p>

<p>The next morning I parcelled up the company according to their
duties, for while Ringan was captain of the stockade, I was the
leader of the venture. I sent out Bertrand and Donaldson to trap
in the woods; Ringan, with Grey and Shalah, stayed at home to
strengthen still further the stockade and protect Elspeth; while
I took my musket and some pack-thongs and went up the hill-side
to look for game. We were trysted to be back an hour before sundown,
and if some one of us did not find food we should go supperless.</p>

<p>That day is a memory which will never pass from me. The weather
was grey and lowering, and though the rain had ceased, the air
was still heavy with it, and every bush and branch dripped with
moisture. It was a poor day for hunting, for the eye could not
see forty yards; but it suited my purpose, since the dull air
would deaden the noise of my musket. I was hunting alone in a
strange land among imminent perils, and my aim was not to glorify
my skill, but to find the means of life. The thought strung me
up to a mood where delight was more notable than care. I was adventuring
with only my hand to guard me in those ancient, haunted woods,
where no white man had ever before travelled. To experience such
moments is to live with the high fervour which God gave to mortals
before towns and laws laid their dreary spell upon them.</p>

<p>Early in the day I met a bear&mdash;the second I had seen in my life.
I did not want him, and he disregarded me and shuffled grumpily
down the hill-side. I had to be very careful, I remember, to mark
my path, so that I could retrace it, and I followed the Border
device of making a chip here and there in the bark of trees, and
often looking backward to remember the look of the place when
seen from the contrary side. Trails were easy to find on the soft
ground, but besides the bear I saw none but those of squirrel
and rabbit, and a rare opossum. But at last, in a marshy glen,
I found the fresh slot of a great stag. For two hours and more
I followed him far north along the ridge, till I came up with
him in a patch of scrub oak. I had to wait long for a shot, but
when at last he rose I planted a bullet fairly behind his shoulder,
and he dropped within ten paces. His size amazed me, for he was
as big as a cart-horse in body, and carried a spread of branching
antlers like a forest tree. To me, accustomed to the little deer
of the Tidewater, this great creature seemed a portent, and I
guessed that he was that elk which I had heard of from the Border
hunters. Anyhow he gave me wealth of food. I hid some in a cool
place, and took the rest with me, packed in bark, in a great bundle
on my shoulders.</p>

<p>The road back was easier than I had feared, for I had the slope
of the hill to guide me; but I was mortally weary of my load before
I plumped it down inside the stockade. Presently Bertrand and
Donaldson returned. They brought only a few rabbits, but they
had set many traps, and in a hill burn they had caught some fine
golden-bellied trout. Soon venison steaks and fish were grilling
in the embers, and Elspeth set to baking cakes on a griddle. Those
left behind had worked well, and the palisade was as perfect as
could be contrived. A runlet of water had been led through a hollow
trunk into a trough&mdash;also hewn from a log&mdash;close by Elspeth's
bower, where she could make her toilet unperplexed by other eyes.
Also they had led a stream into the horses' enclosure, so that
they could be watered with ease.</p>

<p>The weather cleared in the evening, as it often does in a hill
country. From the stockade we had no prospect save the reddening
western sky, but I liked to think that in a little walk I could
see old Studd's Promised Land. That was a joy I reserved for myself
on the morrow, I look back on that late afternoon with delight
as a curious interlude of peace. We had forgotten that we were
fugitives in a treacherous land, I for one had forgotten the grim
purpose of our quest, and we cooked supper as if we were a band
of careless folk taking our pleasure in the wilds. Wood-smoke
is always for me an intoxication like strong drink. It seems the
incense of nature's altar, calling up the shades of the old forest
gods, smacking of rest and comfort in the heart of solitude. And
what odour can vie for hungry folk with that of roasting meat
in the clear hush of twilight? The sight of that little camp is
still in my memory. Elspeth flitted about busied with her cookery,
the glow of the sunset lighting up her dark hair. Bertrand did
the roasting, crouched like a gnome by the edge of the fire. Grey
fetched and carried for the cooks, a docile and cheerful servant,
with nothing in his look to recall the proud gentleman of the
Tidewater. Donaldson sat on a log, contentedly smoking his pipe,
while Ringan, whistling a strathspey, attended to the horses.
Only Shalah stood aloof, his eyes fixed vacantly on the western
sky, and his ear intent on the multitudinous voices of the twilit
woods.</p>

<p>Presently food was ready, and our rude meal in that darkling
place was a merry one. Elspeth sat enthroned on a couch of pine
branches &mdash;I can see her yet shielding her face from the
blaze with one little hand, and dividing her cakes with the other.
Then we lit our pipes, and fell to the long tales of the camp-fire.
Ringan had a story of a black-haired princess of Spain, and how
for love of her two gentlemen did marvels on the seas. The chief
one never returned to claim her, but died in a fight off Cartagena,
and wrote a fine ballad about his mistress which Ringan said was
still sung in the taverns of the Main. He gave a verse of it,
a wild, sad thing, with tears in it and the joy of battle. After
that we all sang, all but me, who have no voice. Bertrand had
a lay of Normandy, about a lady who walked in the apple-orchards
and fell in love with a wandering minstrel; and Donaldson sang
a rough ballad of Virginia, in which a man weighs the worth of
his wife against a tankard of apple-jack. Grey sang an English
song about the north-country maid who came to London, and a bit
of the chanty of the Devon men who sacked Santa Fe and stole the
Almirante's daughter. As for Elspeth, she sang to a soft Scots
tune the tale of the Lady of Cassilis who followed the gipsy's
piping. In it the gipsy tells of what he can offer the lady, and
lo! it was our own case!&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And ye shall wear no silken gown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No maid shall bind your hair;<br/>
&nbsp;The yellow broom shall be your gem,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your braid the heather rare.

</p>
<p>
"Athwart the moor, adown the hill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the world away!<br/>
&nbsp;The path is long for happy hearts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sing to greet the day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sing to greet the day."

</p>
</div>
<p>I remember, too, the last verse of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"And at the last no solemn stole<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall on thy breast be laid;<br/>
&nbsp;No mumbling priest shall speed thy soul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No charnel vault thee shade.<br/>
&nbsp;But by the shadowed hazel copse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aneath the greenwood tree,<br/>
&nbsp;Where airs are soft and waters sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou'lt ever sleep by me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou'lt ever sleep by me."

</p>
</div>
<p>Then we fell to talking about the things in the West that no
man had yet discovered, and Shalah, to whom our songs were nothing,
now lent an ear.</p>

<p>"The first Virginians," said Grey, "thought that over the hills
lay the western ocean and the road to Cathay. I do not know, but
I am confident that but a little way west we should come to water.
A great river or else the ocean."</p>

<p>Ringan differed. He held that the land of America was very wide
in those parts, as wide as south of the isthmus where no man had
yet crossed it. Then he told us of a sea-captain who had travelled
inland in Mexico for five weeks and come to a land where gold
was as common as chuckiestones, and a great people dwelt who worshipped
a god who lived in a mountain. And he spoke of the holy city of
Manoa, which Sir Walter Raleigh sought, and which many had seen
from far hill-tops. Likewise of the wonderful kings who once dwelt
in Peru, and the little isle in the Pacific where all the birds
were nightingales and the Tree of Life flourished; and the mountain
north of the Main which was all one emerald. "I think," he said,
"that, though no man has ever had the fruition of these marvels,
they are likely to be more true than false. I hold that God has
kept this land of America to the last to be the loadstone of adventurers,
and that there are greater wonders to be seen than any that man
has imagined. The pity is that I have spent my best years scratching
like a hen at its doorstep instead of entering. I have a notion
some day to travel straight west to the sunset. I think I should
find death, but I might see some queer things first."</p>

<p>Then Shalah spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was once a man of my own people who, when he came to man's
strength, journeyed westward with a wife. He travelled all his
days, and when his eyes were dim with age he saw a great water.
His spirit left him on its shore, but on his road he had begotten
a son, and that son journeyed back towards the rising sun, and
came after many years to his people again. I have spoken with
him of what he had seen."</p>

<p>"And what was that?" asked Ringan, with eager eyes.</p>

<p>"He told of plains so great that it is a lifetime to travel over
them, and of deserts where the eagle flying from the dawn dies
of drought by midday, and of mountains so high that birds cannot
cross them but are changed by cold into stone, and of rivers to
which our little waters are as reeds to a forest cedar. But especially
he spoke of the fierce warriors that ride like the wind on horses.
It seems, brother, that he who would reach that land must reach
also the Hereafter."</p>

<p>"That's the place for me," Ringan cried. "What say you, Andrew?
When this affair is over, shall we make a bid for these marvels?
I can cull some pretty adventurers from the Free Companions."</p>

<p>"Nay, I am for moving a step at a time," said I. "I am a trader,
and want one venture well done before I begin on another, I shall
be content if we safely cross these mountains on which we are
now perched."</p>

<p>Ringan shook his head. "That was never the way of the Highlands,
'Better a bone on the far-away hills than a fat sheep in the meadows,'
says the Gael. What say you, mistress?" and he turned to Elspeth.</p>

<p>"I think you are the born poet," said she, smiling, "and that
Mr. Garvald is the sober man of affairs. You will leap for the
top of the wall and get a prospect while Mr. Garvald will patiently
pull it down."</p>

<p>"Oh, I grant that Andrew has the wisdom," said Ringan. "That's
why him and me's so well agreed. It's because we differ much,
and so fit together like opposite halves of an apple.... Is your
traveller still in the land of the living?" he asked Shalah.</p>

<p>But the Indian had slipped away from the fireside circle, and
I saw him without in the moonlight standing rigid on a knoll and
gazing at the skies.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Next day dawned cloudless, and Shalah and I spent it in a long
journey along the range. We kept to the highest parts, and at
every vantage-ground we scanned the glens for human traces. By
this time I had found my hill legs, and could keep pace even with
the Indian's swift stride. The ridge of mountains, you must know,
was not a single backbone, but broken up here and there by valleys
into two and even three ranges. This made our scouting more laborious,
and prevented us from getting the full value out of our high station.
Mostly we kept in cover, and never showed on a skyline. But we
saw nothing to prove the need of this stealth. Only the hawks
wheeled, and the wild pigeons crooned; the squirrels frisked among
the branches; and now and then a great deer would leap from its
couch and hasten into the coverts.</p>

<p>But, though we got no news, that journey brought to me a revelation,
for I had my glimpse of Studd's Promised Land. It came to me early
in the day, as we halted in a little glade, gay with willowherb
and goldenrod, which hung on a shelf of the hills looking westwards.
The first streamers of morn had gone, the mists had dried up from
the valleys, and I found myself looking into a deep cleft and
across at a steep pine-clad mountain. Clearly the valley was split
by this mountain into two forks, and I could see only the cool
depth of it and catch a gleam of broken water a mile or two below.
But looking more to the north, I saw where the vale opened, and
then I had a vision worthy of the name by which Studd had baptized
it. An immense green pasture land ran out to the dim horizon.
There were forests scattered athwart it, and single great trees,
and little ridges, too, but at the height where we stood it seemed
to the eye to be one verdant meadow as trim and shapely as the
lawn of a garden. A noble river, the child of many hill streams,
twined through it in shining links. I could see dots, which I
took to be herds of wild cattle grazing, but no sign of any human
dweller.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked unthinkingly.</p>

<p>"The Shenandoah," Shalah said, and I never stopped to ask how
he knew the name. He was gazing at the sight with hungry eyes,
he whose gaze was, for usual, so passionless.</p>

<p>That prospect gave me a happy feeling of comfort; why, I cannot
tell, except that the place looked so bright and habitable. Here
was no sour wilderness, but a land made by God for cheerful human
dwellings. Some day there would be orchards and gardens among
those meadows, and miles of golden corn, and the smoke of hearth
fires. Some day I would enter into that land of Canaan which now
I saw from Pisgah. Some day&mdash;and I scarcely dared the thought&mdash;my
children would call it home.</p>
