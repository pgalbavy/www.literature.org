<p>When the afternoon train from the south drew into Gledsmuir station,
a girl who had been devouring the landscape for the last hour
with eager eyes, rose nervously to prepare for exit. To Alice
Wishart the country was a novel one, and the prospect before her
an unexplored realm of guesses. The daughter of a great merchant,
she had lived most of her days in the ugly environs of a city,
save for such time as she had spent at the conventional schools.
She had never travelled; the world of men and things was merely
a name to her, and a girlhood, lonely and brightened chiefly by
the companionship of books, had not given her self-confidence.
She had casually met Lady Manorwater at some political meeting
in her father's house, and the elder woman had taken a strong
liking to the quiet, abstracted child. Then came an invitation
to Glenavelin, accepted gladly yet with much fear and searching
of heart. Now, as she looked out on the shining mountain land,
she was full of delight that she was about to dwell in the heart
of it. Something of pride, too, was present, that she was to be
the guest of a great lady, and see something of a life which seemed
infinitely remote to her provincial thoughts. But when her journey
drew near its end she was foolishly nervous, and scanned the platform
with anxious eye.</p>

<p>The sight of her hostess reassured her. Lady Manorwater was a
small middle-aged woman, with a thin classical face, large colourless
eyes, and untidy fair hair. She was very plainly dressed, and
as she darted forward to greet the girl with entire frankness
and kindness, Alice forgot her fears and kissed her heartily.
A languid young woman was introduced as Miss Afflint, and in a
few minutes the three were in the Glenavelin carriage with the
wide glen opening in front.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I hope you will enjoy your visit. We are quite
a small party, for Jack says Glenavelin is far too small to entertain
in. You are fond of the country, aren't you? And of course the
place is very pretty. There is tennis and golf and fishing; but
perhaps you don't like these things? We are not very well off
for neighbours, but we are large enough in number to be sufficient
to ourselves. Don't you think so, Bertha?" And Lady Manorwater
smiled at the third member of the group.</p>

<p>Miss Afflint, a silent girl, smiled back and said nothing. She
had been engaged in a secret study of Alice's face, and whenever
the object of the study raised her eyes she found a pair of steady
blue ones beaming on her. It was a little disconcerting, and Alice
gazed out at the landscape with a fictitious curiosity.</p>

<p>They passed out of the Gled valley into the narrower strath of
Avelin, and soon, leaving the meadows behind, went deep into the
recesses of woods. At a narrow glen bridged by the road and bright
with the spray of cascades and the fresh green of ferns, Alice
cried out in delight, "Oh, I must come back here some day and
sketch it. What a Paradise of a place!"</p>

<p>"Then you had better ask Lewie's permission." And Lady Manorwater
laughed.</p>

<p>"Who is Lewie?" asked the girl, anticipating some gamekeeper
or shepherd.</p>

<p>"Lewie is my nephew. He lives at Etterick, up at the head of
the glen."</p>

<p>Miss Afflint spoke for the first time. "A very good man. You
should know Lewie, Miss Wishart. I'm sure you would like him.
He is a great traveller, you know, and has written a famous book.
Lewis Haystoun is his full name."</p>

<p>"Why, I have read it," cried Alice. "You mean the book about
Kashmir. But I thought the author was an old man."</p>

<p>"Lewie is not very old," said his aunt; "but I haven't seen him
for years, so he may be decrepit by this time. He is coming home
soon, he says, but he never writes. I know two of his friends
who pay a Private Inquiry Office to send them news of him."</p>

<p>Alice laughed and became silent. What merry haphazard people
were these she had fallen among! At home everything was docketed
and ordered. Meals were immovable feasts, the hour for bed and
the hour for rising were more regular than the sun's. Her father
was full of proverbs on the virtue of regularity, and was wont
to attribute every vice and misfortune to its absence. And yet
here were men and women who got on very well without it. She did
not wholly like it. The little doctrinaire in her revolted and
she was pleased to be censorious.</p>

<p>"You are a very learned young woman, aren't you?" said Lady Manorwater,
after a short silence. "I have heard wonderful stories about your
learning. Then I hope you will talk to Mr. Stocks, for I am afraid
he is shocked at Bertha's frivolity. He asked her if she was in
favour of the Prisons Regulation Bill, and she was very rude."</p>

<p>"I only said," broke in Miss Afflint, "that owing to my lack
of definite local knowledge I was not in a position to give an
answer commensurate with the gravity of the subject." She spoke
in a perfect imitation of the tone of a pompous man.</p>

<p>"Bertha, I do not approve of you," said Lady Manorwater. "I forbid
you to mimic Mr. Stocks. He is very clever, and very much in earnest
over everything. I don't wonder that a butterfly like you should
laugh, but I hope Miss Wishart will be kind to him."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am very ignorant," said Alice hastily, "and I
am very useless. I never did any work of any sort in my life,
and when I think of you I am ashamed."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear child, please don't think me a paragon," cried her
hostess in horror. "I am a creature of vague enthusiasms and I
have the sense to know it. Sometimes I fancy I am a woman of business,
and then I take up half a dozen things till Jack has to interfere
to prevent financial ruin. I dabble in politics and I dabble in
philanthropy; I write review articles which nobody reads, and
I make speeches which are a horror to myself and a misery to my
hearers. Only by the possession of a sense of humour am I saved
from insignificance."</p>

<p>To Alice the speech was the breaking of idols. Competence, responsibility
were words she had been taught to revere, and to hear them light-heartedly
disavowed seemed an upturning of the foundation of things. You
will perceive that her education had not included that valuable
art, the appreciation of the flippant.</p>

<p>By this time the carriage was entering the gates of the park,
and the thick wood cleared and revealed long vistas of short hill
grass, rising and falling like moorland, and studded with solitary
clumps of firs. Then a turn in the drive brought them once more
into shadow, this time beneath a heath-clad knoll where beeches
and hazels made a pleasant tangle. All this was new, not three
years old; but soon they were in the ancient part of the policy
which had surrounded the old house of Glenavelin. Here the grass
was lusher, the trees antique oaks and beeches, and grey walls
showed the boundary of an old pleasure-ground. Here in the soft
sunlit afternoon sleep hung like a cloud, and the peace of centuries
dwelt in the long avenues and golden pastures. Another turning
and the house came in sight, at first glance a jumble of grey
towers and ivied walls. Wings had been built to the original square
keep, and even now it was not large, a mere moorland dwelling.
But the whitewashed walls, the crow-step gables, and the quaint
Scots baronial turrets gave it a perfection to the eye like a
house in a dream. To Alice, accustomed to the vulgarity of suburban
villas with Italian campaniles, a florid lodge a stone's throw
from the house, darkened too with smoke and tawdry with paint,
this old-world dwelling was a patch of wonderland. Her eyes drank
in the beauty of the place&mdash;the great blue backs of hill beyond,
the acres of sweet pasture, the primeval woods.</p>

<p>"Is this Glenavelin?" she cried. "Oh, what a place to live in!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very pretty, dear." And Lady Manorwater, who possessed
half a dozen houses up and down the land, patted her guest's arm
and looked with pleasure on the flushed girlish face.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Alice, having completed dressing, leaned out
of her bedroom window to drink in the soft air of evening. She
had not brought a maid, and had refused her hostess's offer to
lend her her own on the ground that maids were a superfluity.
It was her desire to be a very practical young person, a scorner
of modes and trivialities, and yet she had taken unusual care
with her toilet this evening, and had spent many minutes before
the glass. Looking at herself carefully, a growing conviction
began to be confirmed&mdash;that she was really rather pretty. She
had reddish-brown hair and&mdash;a rare conjunction&mdash;dark eyes and
eyebrows and a delicate colour. As a small girl she had lamented
bitterly the fate that had not given her the orthodox beauty of
the dark or fair maiden, and in her school days she had passed
for plain. Now it began to dawn on her that she had beauty of
a kind&mdash;the charm of strangeness; and her slim strong figure had
the grace which a wholesome life alone can give. She was in high
spirits, curious, interested, and generous. The people amused
her, the place was a fairyland and outside the golden weather
lay still and fragrant among the hills.</p>

<p>When she came down to the drawing-room she found the whole party
assembled. A tall man with a brown beard and a slight stoop ceased
to assault the handle of a firescreen and came over to greet her.
He had only come back half an hour ago, he explained, and so had
missed her arrival. The face attracted and soothed her. Abundant
kindness lurked in the humorous brown eyes, and a queer pucker
on the brow gave him the air of a benevolent despot. If this was
Lord Manorwater, she had no further dread of the great ones of
the earth. There were four other men, two of them mild, spectacled
people, who had the air of students and a precise affected mode
of talk, and one a boy cousin of whom no one took the slightest
notice. The fourth was a striking figure, a man of about forty
in appearance, tall and a little stout, with a rugged face which
in some way suggested a picture of a prehistoric animal in an
old natural history she had owned. The high cheek-bones, large
nose, and slightly protruding eyes had an unfinished air about
them, as if their owner had escaped prematurely from a mould.
A quantity of bushy black hair&mdash;which he wore longer than most
men&mdash;enhanced the dramatic air of his appearance. It was a face
full of vigour and a kind of strength, shrewd, a little coarse,
and solemn almost to the farcical. He was introduced in a rush
of words by the hostess, but beyond the fact that it was a monosyllable,
Alice did not catch his name.</p>

<p>Lord Manorwater took in Miss Afflint, and Alice fell to the dark
man with the monosyllabic name. He had a way of bowing over his
hand which slightly repelled the girl, who had no taste for elaborate
manners. His first question, too, displeased her. He asked her
if she was one of the Wisharts of some unpronounceable place.</p>

<p>She replied briefly that she did not know. Her grandfathers on
both sides had been farmers.</p>

<p>The gentleman bowed with the smiling unconcern of one to whom
pedigree is a matter of course.</p>

<p>"I have heard often of your father," he said. "He is one of the
local supports of the party to which I have the honour to belong.
He represents one great section of our retainers, our host another.
I am glad to see such friendship between the two." And he smiled
elaborately from Alice to Lord Manorwater.</p>

<p>Alice was uncomfortable. She felt she must be sitting beside
some very great man, and she was tortured by vain efforts to remember
the monosyllable which had stood for his name. She did not like
his voice, and, great man or not, she resented the obvious patronage.
He spoke with a touch of the drawl which is currently supposed
to belong only to the half-educated classes of England.</p>

<p>She turned to the boy who sat on the other side of her. The young
gentleman&mdash;his name was Arthur and, apparently, nothing else&mdash;was
only too ready to talk. He proceeded to explain, compendiously,
his doings of the past week, to which the girl listened politely.
Then anxiety got the upper hand, and she asked in a whisper, <em>a
propos</em> of nothing in particular, the name of her left-hand
neighbour.</p>

<p>"They call him Stocks," said the boy, delighted at the tone of
confidence, and was going on to sketch the character of the gentleman
in question when Alice cut him short.</p>

<p>"Will you take me to fish some day?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Any day," gasped the hilarious Arthur. "I'm ready, and I'll
tell you what, I know the very burn&mdash;" and he babbled on happily
till he saw that Miss Wishart had ceased to listen. It was the
first time a pretty girl had shown herself desirous of his company,
and he was intoxicated with the thought.</p>

<p>But Alice felt that she was in some way bound to make the most
of Mr. Stocks, and she set herself heroically to the task. She
had never heard of him, but then she was not well versed in the
minutiae of things political, and he clearly was a politician.
Doubtless to her father his name was a household word. So she
spoke to him of Glenavelin and its beauties.</p>

<p>He asked her if she had seen Royston Castle, the residence of
his friend the Duke of Sanctamund. When he had stayed there he
had been much impressed&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she spoke wildly of anything, of books and pictures and
people and politics. She found him well-informed, clever, and
dogmatic. The culminating point was reached when she embarked
on a stray remark concerning certain events then happening in
India.</p>

<p>He contradicted her with a lofty politeness.</p>

<p>She quoted a book on Kashmir.</p>

<p>He laughed the authority to scorn. "Lewis Haystoun?" he asked.
"What can he know about such things? A wandering dilettante, the
worst type of the pseudo-culture of our universities. He must
see all things through the spectacles of his upbringing."</p>

<p>Fortunately he spoke in a low voice, but Lord Manorwater caught
the name.</p>

<p>"You are talking about Lewie," he said; and then to the table
at large, "do you know that Lewie is home? I saw him to-day."</p>

<p>Bertha Afflint clapped her hands. "Oh, splendid! When is he coming
over? I shall drive to Etterick to-morrow. No&mdash;bother! I can't
go to-morrow, I shall go on Wednesday."</p>

<p>Lady Manorwater opened mild eyes of surprise. "Why didn't the
boy write?" And the young Arthur indulged in sundry exclamations,
"Oh, ripping, I say! What? A clinking good chap, my cousin Lewie!"</p>

<p>"Who is this Lewis the well-beloved?" said Mr. Stocks. "I was
talking about a very different person &mdash;Lewis Haystoun, the
author of a foolish book on Kashmir."</p>

<p>"Don't you like it?" said Lord Manorwater, pleasantly. "Well,
it's the same man. He is my nephew, Lewie Haystoun. He lives at
Etterick, four miles up the glen. You will see him over here to-morrow
or the day after."</p>

<p>Mr. Stocks coughed loudly to cover his discomfiture. Alice could
not repress a little smile of triumph, but she was forbearing
and for the rest of dinner exerted herself to appease her adversary,
listening to his talk with an air of deference which he found
entrancing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was plain that Lord Manorwater was not quite at
ease with his company. Usually a man of brusque and hearty address,
he showed his discomfort by an air of laborious politeness. He
was patronized for a brief minute by Mr. Stocks, who set him right
on some matter of agricultural reform. Happening to be a specialist
on the subject and an enthusiastic farmer from his earliest days,
he took the rebuke with proper meekness. The spectacled people
were talking earnestly with his wife. Arthur was absorbed in his
dinner and furtive glances at his left-hand neighbour. There remained
Bertha Afflint, whom he had hitherto admired with fear. To talk
with her was exhausting to frail mortality, and he had avoided
the pleasure except in moments of boisterous bodily and mental
health. Now she was his one resource, and the unfortunate man,
rashly entering into a contest of wit, found himself badly worsted
by her ready tongue. He declared that she was worse than her mother,
at which the unabashed young woman replied that the superiority
of parents was the last retort of the vanquished. He registered
an inward vow that Miss Afflint should be used on the morrow as
a weapon to quell Mr. Stocks.</p>

<p>When Alice escaped to the drawing-room she found Bertha and her
sister&mdash;a younger and ruddier copy&mdash;busy with the letters which
had arrived by the evening post. Lady Manorwater, who reserved
her correspondence for the late hours, seized upon the girl and
carried her off to sit by the great French windows from which
lawn and park sloped down to the moorland loch. She chattered
pleasantly about many things, and then innocently and abruptly
asked her if she had not found her companion at table amusing.</p>

<p>Alice, unaccustomed to fiction, gave a hesitating "Yes," at which
her hostess looked pleased. "He is very clever, you know," she
said, "and has been very useful to me on many occasions."</p>

<p>Alice asked his occupation.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has done many things. He has been very brave and quite
the maker of his own fortunes. He educated himself, and then I
think he edited some Nonconformist paper. Then he went into politics,
and became a Churchman. Some old man took a liking to him and
left him his money, and that was the condition. So I believe he
is pretty well off now and is waiting for a seat. He has been
nursing this constituency, and since the election comes off in
a month or two, we asked him down here to stay. He has also written
a lot of things and he is somebody's private secretary." And Lady
Manorwater relapsed into vagueness.</p>

<p>The girl listened without special interest, save that she modified
her verdict on Mr. Stocks, and allowed, some degree of respect
for him to find place in her heart. The fighter in life always
appealed to her, whatever the result of his struggle.</p>

<p>Then Lady Manorwater proceeded to hymn his excellences in an
indeterminate, artificial manner, till the men came into the room,
and conversation became general. Lord Manorwater made his way
to Alice, thereby defeating Mr. Stocks, who tended in the same
direction. "Come outside and see things, Miss Wishart," he said.
"It's a shame to miss a Glenavelin evening if it's fine. We must
appreciate our rarities."</p>

<p>And Alice gladly followed him into the still air of dusk which
made hill and tree seem incredibly distant and the far waters
of the lake merge with the moorland in one shimmering golden haze.
In the rhododendron thickets sparse blooms still remained, and
all along by the stream-side stood stately lines of yellow iris
above the white water-ranunculus. The girl was sensitive to moods
of season and weather, and she had almost laughed at the incongruity
of the two of them in modern clothes in this fit setting for an
old tale. Dickon of Glenavelin, the sworn foe of the Lord of Etterick,
on such nights as this had ridden up the water with his bands
to affront the quiet moonlight. And now his descendant was pointing
out dim shapes in the park which he said were prize cattle.</p>

<p>"Whew! what a weariness is civilization!" said the man, with
comical eyes. "We have been making talk with difficulty all the
evening which serves no purpose in the world. Upon my word, my
kyloes have the best of the bargain. And in a month or so there
will be the election and I shall have to go and rave&mdash;there is
no other word for it, Miss Wishart&mdash;rave on behalf of some fool
or other, and talk Radicalism which would make your friend Dickon
turn in his grave, and be in earnest for weeks when I know in
the bottom of my heart that I am a humbug and care for none of
these things. How lightly politics and such matters sit on us
all!"</p>

<p>"But you know you are talking nonsense," said the serious Alice.
"After all, these things are the most important, for they mean
duty and courage and&mdash;and&mdash;all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Right, little woman," said he, smiling; "that is what Stocks
tells me twice a day, but, somehow, reproof comes better from
you. Dear me! it's a sad thing that a middle-aged legislator should
be reproved by a very little girl. Come and see the herons. The
young birds will be everywhere just now."</p>

<p>For an hour in the moonlight they went a-sightseeing, and came
back very cool and fresh to the open drawing-room window. As they
approached they caught an echo of a loud, bland voice saying,
"We must remember our moral responsibilities, my dear Lady Manorwater.
Now, for instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>And a strange thing happened. For the first time in her life
Miss Alice Wishart felt that the use of loud and solemn words
could jar upon her feelings. She set it down resignedly to the
evil influence of her companion.</p>

<p>In the calm of her bedroom Alice reviewed her recent hours. She
admitted to herself that she would enjoy her visit. A healthy
and active young woman, the mere prospect of an open-air life
gave her pleasure. Also she liked the people. Mentally she epitomized
each of the inmates of the house. Lady Manorwater was all she
had pictured her&mdash;a dear, whimsical, untidy creature, with odd
shreds of cleverness and a heart of gold. She liked the boy Arthur,
and the spectacled people seemed harmless. Bertha she was prepared
to adore, for behind the languor and wit she saw a very kindly
and capable young woman fashioned after her own heart. But of
all she liked Lord Manorwater best. She knew that he had a great
reputation, that he was said to be incessantly laborious, and
she had expected some one of her father's type, prim, angular,
and elderly. Instead she found a boyish person whom she could
scold, and with women reproof is the first stone in the foundation
of friendship. On Mr. Stocks she generously reserved her judgment,
fearing the fate of the hasty.</p>
