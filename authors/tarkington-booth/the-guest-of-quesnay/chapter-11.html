<p>The dining-room at Quesnay is a pretty work of the second of
those three Louises who made so much furniture. It was never a
proper setting for a rusty, out-of-doors painter-man, nor has
such a fellow ever found himself complacently at ease there since
the day its first banquet was spread for a score or so of fine-feathered
epigram jinglers, fiddling Versailles gossip out of a rouge-and-lace
Quesnay marquise newly sent into half-earnest banishment for too
much king-hunting. For my part, however, I should have preferred
a chance at making a place for myself among the wigs and brocades
to the Crusoe's Isle of my chair at Miss Elizabeth's table.</p>

<p>I learned at an early age to look my vanities in the face; I
outfaced them and they quailed, but persisted, surviving for my
discomfort to this day. Here is the confession: It was not until
my arrival at the chateau that I realised what temerity it involved
to dine there in evening clothes purchased, some four or five
or six years previously, in the economical neighbourhood of the
Boulevard St. Michel. Yet the things fitted me well enough; were
clean and not shiny, having been worn no more than a dozen times,
I think; though they might have been better pressed.</p>

<p>Looking over the men of the Quesnay party&mdash;or perhaps I should
signify a reversal of that and say a glance of theirs at me&mdash;revealed
the importance of a particular length of coat-tail, of a certain
rich effect obtained by widely separating the lower points of
the waistcoat, of the display of some imagination in the buttons
upon the same garment, of a doubled-back arrangement of cuffs,
and of a specific design and dimension of tie. Marked uniformity
in these matters denoted their necessity; and clothes differing
from the essential so vitally as did mine must have seemed immodest,
little better than no clothes at all. I doubt if I could have
argued in extenuation my lack of advantages for study, such an
excuse being itself the damning circumstance. Of course eccentricity
is permitted, but (as in the Arts) only to the established. And
I recall a painful change of colour which befell the countenance
of a shining young man I met at Ward's house in Paris: he had
used his handkerchief and was absently putting it in his pocket
when he providentially noticed what he was doing and restored
it to his sleeve.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth had the courage to take me under her wing, placing
me upon her left at dinner; but sprightlier calls than mine demanded
and occupied her attention. At my other side sat a magnificently
upholstered lady, who offered a fine shoulder and the rear wall
of a collar of pearls for my observation throughout the evening,
as she leaned forward talking eagerly with a male personage across
the table. This was a prince, ending in "ski": he permitted himself
the slight vagary of wearing a gold bracelet, and perhaps this
flavour of romance drew the lady. Had my good fortune ever granted
a second meeting, I should not have known her.</p>

<p>Fragments reaching me in my seclusion indicated that the various
conversations up and down the long table were animated; and at
times some topic proved of such high interest as to engage the
comment of the whole company. This was the case when the age of
one of the English king's grandchildren came in question, but
a subject which called for even longer (if less spirited) discourse
concerned the shameful lack of standard on the part of citizens
of the United States, or, as it was put, with no little exasperation,
"What is the trouble with America?" Hereupon brightly gleamed
the fat young man whom I had marked for a wit at Les Trois Pigeons;
he pictured with inimitable mimicry a western senator lately in
France. This outcast, it appeared, had worn a slouch hat at a
garden party and had otherwise betrayed his country to the ridicule
of the intelligent. "But really," said the fat young man, turning
plaintiff in conclusion, "imagine what such things make the English
and the French think of US!" And it finally went by consent that
the trouble with America was the vulgarity of our tourists.</p>

<p>"A dreadful lot!" Miss Elizabeth cheerfully summed up for them
all. "The miseries I undergo with that class of 'prominent Amurricans'
who bring letters to my brother! I remember one awful creature
who said, when I came into the room, 'Well, ma'am, I guess you're
the lady of the house, aren't you?'"</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth sparkled through the chorus of laughter, but I
remembered the "awful creature," a genial and wise old man of
affairs, whose daughter's portrait George painted. Miss Elizabeth
had missed his point: the canvasser's phrase had been intended
with humour, and even had it lacked that, it was not without a
pretty quaintness. So I thought, being "left to my own reflections,"
which may have partaken of my own special kind of snobbery; at
least I regretted the Elizabeth of the morning garden and the
early walk along the fringe of the woods. For she at my side to-night
was another lady.</p>

<p>The banquet was drawing to a close when she leaned toward me
and spoke in an undertone. As this was the first sign, in so protracted
a period, that I might ever again establish relations with the
world of men, it came upon me like a Friday's footprint, and in
the moment of shock I did not catch what she said.</p>

<p>"Anne Elliott, yonder, is asking you a question," she repeated,
nodding at a very pretty gal down and across the table from me.
Miss Anne Elliott's attractive voice had previously enabled me
to recognise her as the young woman who had threatened to serenade
Les Trois Pigeons.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I said, addressing her, and at the sound
my obscurity was illuminated, about half of the company turning
to look at me with wide-eyed surprise. (I spoke in an ordinary
tone, it may need to be explained, and there is nothing remarkable
about my voice).</p>

<p>"I hear you're at Les Trois Pigeons," said Miss Elliott.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"<em>WOULD </em>you mind telling us something of the <em>MYSTERIOUS
</em>Narcissus?"</p>

<p>"If you'll be more definite," I returned, in the tone of a question.</p>

<p>"There couldn't be more than one like <em>THAT," </em>said Miss
Elliott, "at least, not in one neighbourhood, could there? I mean
a <em>RECKLESSLY </em>charming vision with a <em>WHITE </em>tie
and <em>WHITE </em>hair and <em>WHITE </em>flannels."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "HE'S not mysterious."</p>

<p>"But he IS," she returned; "I insist on his being <em>MYSTERIOUS!
</em>Rarely, grandly, <em>STRANGELY </em>mysterious! You <em>WILL
</em>let me think so?" This young lady had a whimsical manner
of emphasising words unexpectedly, with a breathless intensity
that approached violence, a habit dangerously contagious among
nervous persons, so that I answered slowly, out of a fear that
I might echo it.</p>

<p>"It would need a great deal of imagination. He's a young American,
very attractive, very simple&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he's <em>MAD!" </em>she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" I said hastily.</p>

<p>"But he IS! A person told me so in a garden this <em>VERY </em>afternoon,"
she went on eagerly; "a person with a rake and <em>EVER </em>so
many moles on his chin. This person told me all about him. His
name is Oliver Saffren, and he's in the charge of a <em>VERY </em>large
doctor and quite, <em>QUITE </em>mad!"</p>

<p>"Jean Ferret, the gardener." I said deliberately, and with venom,
"is fast acquiring notoriety in these parts as an idiot of purest
ray, and he had his information from another whose continuance
unhanged is every hour more miraculous."</p>

<p>"How <em>RUTHLESS </em>of you," cried Miss Elliott, with exaggerated
reproach, "when I have had such a thrilling happiness all day
in believing that <em>RIOTOUSLY </em>beautiful creature mad! You
are wholly positive he isn't?"</p>

<p>Our dialogue was now all that delayed a general departure from
the table. This, combined with the naive surprise I have mentioned,
served to make us temporarily the centre of attention, and, among
the faces turned toward me, my glance fell unexpectedly upon one
I had not seen since entering the dining-room. Mrs. Harman had
been placed at some distance from me and on the same side of the
table, but now she leaned far back in her chair to look at me,
so that I saw her behind the shoulders of the people between us.
She was watching me with an expression unmistakably of repressed
anxiety and excitement, and as our eyes met, hers shone with a
certain agitation, as of some odd consciousness shared with me.
It was so strangely, suddenly a reminder of the look of secret
understanding given me with good night, twenty-four hours earlier,
by the man whose sanity was Miss Elliott's topic, that, puzzled
and almost disconcerted for the moment, I did not at once reply
to the lively young lady's question.</p>

<p>"You're hesitating!" she cried, clasping her hands. "I believe
there's a <em>DARLING </em>little chance of it, after all! And
if it weren't so, why would he need to be watched over, day <em>AND
</em>night, by an <em>ENORMOUS </em>doctor?"</p>

<p>"This IS romance!" I retorted. "The doctor is Professor Keredec,
illustriously known in this country, but not as a physician, and
they are following some form of scientific research together,
I believe. But, assuming to speak as Mr. Saffren's friend," I
added, rising with the others upon Miss Ward's example, "I'm sure
if he could come to know of your interest, he would much rather
play Hamlet for you than let you find him disappointing."</p>

<p>"If he could come to know of my interest!" she echoed, glancing
down at herself with mock demureness. "Don't you think he could
come to know something more of me than that?"</p>

<p>The windows had been thrown open, allowing passage to a veranda.
Miss Elizabeth led the way outdoors with the prince, the rest
of us following at hazard, and in the mild confusion of this withdrawal
I caught a final glimpse of Mrs. Harman, which revealed that she
was still looking at me with the same tensity; but with the movement
of intervening groups I lost her. Miss Elliott pointedly waited
for me until I came round the table, attached me definitely by
taking my arm, accompanying her action with a dazzling smile.
"Oh, DO you think you can manage it?" she whispered rapturously,
to which I replied&mdash;as vaguely as I could&mdash;that the demands of
scientific research upon the time of its followers were apt to
be exorbitant.</p>

<p>Tables and coffee were waiting on the broad terrace below, with
a big moon rising in the sky. I descended the steps in charge
of this pretty cavalier, allowed her to seat me at the most remote
of the tables, and accepted without unwillingness other gallantries
of hers in the matter of coffee and cigarettes. "And now," she
said, "now that I've done so much for your <em>DEAREST </em>hopes
and comfort, look up at the milky moon, and tell me <em>ALL</em>!"</p>

<p>"If you can bear it?"</p>

<p>She leaned an elbow on the marble railing that protected the
terrace, and, shielding her eyes from the moonlight with her hand,
affected to gaze at me dramatically. "Have no distrust," she bade
me. "Who and <em>WHAT </em>is the glorious stranger?"</p>

<p>Resisting an impulse to chime in with her humour, I gave her
so dry and commonplace an account of my young friend at the inn
that I presently found myself abandoned to solitude again.</p>

<p>"I don't know where to go," she complained as she rose. "These
other people are <em>MOST </em>painful to a girl of my intelligence,
but I cannot linger by your side; untruth long ago lost its interest
for me, and I prefer to believe Mr. Jean Ferret&mdash;if that is the
gentleman's name. I'd join Miss Ward and Cressie Ingle yonder,
but Cressie <em>WOULD </em>be indignant! I shall soothe my hurt
with <em>SWEETEST </em>airs. Adieu."</p>

<p>With that she made me a solemn courtesy and departed, a pretty
little figure, not little in attractiveness, the strong moonlight,
tinged with blue, shimmering over her blond hair and splashing
brightly among the ripples of her silks and laces. She swept across
the terrace languidly, offering an effect of comedy not unfairylike,
and, ascending the steps of the veranda, disappeared into the
orange candle-light of a salon. A moment later some chords were
sounded firmly upon a piano in that room, and a bitter song swam
out to me over the laughter and talk of the people at the other
tables. It was to be observed that Miss Anne Elliott sang very
well, though I thought she over-emphasised one line of the stanza:</p>

<p>"This world is a world of lies!"</p>

<p>Perhaps she had poisoned another little arrow for me, too. Impelled
by the fine night, the groups upon the terrace were tending toward
a wider dispersal, drifting over the sloping lawns by threes and
couples, and I was able to identify two figures threading the
paths of the garden, together, some distance below. Judging by
the pace they kept, I should have concluded that Miss Ward and
Mr. Cresson Ingle sought the healthful effects of exercise. However,
I could see no good reason for wishing their conversation less
obviously absorbing, though Miss Elliott's insinuation that Mr.
Ingle might deplore intrusion upon the interview had struck me
as too definite to be altogether pleasing. Still, such matters
could not discontent me with my solitude. Eastward, over the moonlit
roof of the forest, I could see the quiet ocean, its unending
lines of foam moving slowly to the long beaches, too far away
to be heard. The reproachful voice of the singer came no more
from the house, but the piano ran on into "La Vie de Boheme,"
and out of that into something else, I did not know what, but
it seemed to be music; at least it was musical enough to bring
before me some memory of the faces of pretty girls I had danced
with long ago in my dancing days, so that, what with the music,
and the distant sea, and the soft air, so sparklingly full of
moonshine, and the little dancing memories, I was floated off
into a reverie that was like a prelude for the person who broke
it. She came so quietly that I did not hear her until she was
almost beside me and spoke to me. It was the second time that
had happened.</p>
