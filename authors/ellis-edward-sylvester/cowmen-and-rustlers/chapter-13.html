<p>That mysterious warm-air current known as the Chinook wind steals
through the depressions of the Rocky Mountains, at certain seasons
of the year, from the mild surface of the Pacific, and tempers
the severity of the winters in some portions of Montana, Wyoming,
and the great West to a degree that renders them milder than many
places farther south.</p>

<p>It was early in the month of May, when even in the Middle States
it is not often comfortable to remain seated out of doors after
the close of day, but Sterry and Whitney found it pleasant to
occupy their chairs in front of the building, with no other protection
then their own warm garments.</p>

<p>Whitney's wound was doing so well that he expressed himself ashamed
to wear his arm in a sling. He freed it from the support, moved
it readily about, and declared that after the next morning he
would no longer shirk duty.</p>

<p>In one sense, Monteith Sterry was disappointed. He hoped they
would be joined by Jennie, from whom he parted earlier in the
evening, but he reflected that the hour was late, and she probably
felt that her duty was with her sorrowing mother.</p>

<p>"She belongs there," he concluded, "and I respect her for doing
her duty."</p>

<p>But she heard the murmur of voices after they had talked a few
minutes, and appeared at the outer door, where she greeted her
friend and listened with an intensity of interest that may be
imagined to his account of his brush with the rustlers. Although
she had become accustomed to danger during her life in the West,
there could be no mistaking her solicitude for him. She said little,
however, and, excusing herself, bade the two good-night.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said her brother, when she was gone, "if you stay,
or rather attempt to stay, in this section, Mont, it is suicide&mdash;nothing
more nor less."</p>

<p>"Well, I know times are likely to be warm, but, hang it, I can't
bear the thought of being run out of Wyoming. It's a mighty big
State, and there ought to be room enough for me."</p>

<p>"You persist in treating it lightly, but it is no trifling matter;
you have been warned; were shot at, when we had our flurry with
the rustlers; and, even while attempting to ride across the country,
had the narrowest escape of your life&mdash;an escape so curious that
it couldn't be repeated in a hundred years."</p>

<p>"It's the unexpected that happens."</p>

<p>"Not so often as the expected. Mont, what made you leave us so
abruptly to-night?"</p>

<p>"O, I can hardly tell," replied the other, carelessly flinging
one leg over the other and puffing at his cigar, as though the
matter was of no importance.</p>

<p>"I know; you believed that if you stayed here you would increase
the peril to us."</p>

<p>"You've hit it exactly; that was it."</p>

<p>"What sort of friends do you take us to be?"</p>

<p>"That isn't it; rather, what sort of friend would I be, thus
knowingly to place you and your mother and sister in danger? If
those rustlers knew where I am, a dozen would be here before sunrise."</p>

<p>"What of it? We are ready for them."</p>

<p>"That's a poor answer to my statement; you had enough of that
woeful business yesterday; they hold me in such hatred that they
would burn down your place, if they could reach me in no other
way."</p>

<p>"And yet you propose to stay in Wyoming and have it out with
them?"</p>

<p>"I haven't said that," remarked Sterry, more thoughtfully; "I
may soon leave for a more civilized section, much as I hate to
play the seeming coward; but what you said about my parents, brothers
and sisters at home, gave me something to think over while riding
across the prairie to-night."</p>

<p>"I shall hate to lose your company, for it is like old times
to talk over our school days, but I would not be a friend to allow
my selfishness to stand in the way of your good."</p>

<p>Sterry smoked a moment in silence, and then flung away his cigar
and turned abruptly on his companion.</p>

<p>"Fred, if you could have prevented what took place yesterday
by sacrificing every dollar of the property you have in Wyoming,
you would have done it."</p>

<p>"Yes, God knows I would have done it a thousand times over; mother
will never recover from the blow."</p>

<p>"And yet you may be the next to fall during this frightful state
of affairs. If the situation of your mother and sister is so sad
because of the loss of the head of the household, what will it
be if you should be taken?"</p>

<p>"I appreciate your kindness, Mont, but you put the case too strongly;
in one sense we all stand in danger of sudden death every day.
I might live to threescore and ten in Wyoming, and be killed in
a railroad accident or some other way the first day I left it.
There is no particular enmity between the rustlers and me; that
brush yesterday was one of those sudden outbursts that was not
premeditated by them."</p>

<p>"It didn't look that way to me."</p>

<p>"You were not there when it opened. They were driving a lot of
mavericks toward their ranch down the river, when Budd Hankinson
saw a steer among them with our brand. You know it&mdash;a sort of
cross with father's initials. Without asking for its return, Budd
called them a gang of thieves, cut out the steer and drove him
toward our range. If he had gone at the thing in the right way
there would have been no trouble, but his ugly words made them
mad, and the next thing we were all shooting at each other."</p>

<p>"You inflicted more harm than they, and they won't forget it."</p>

<p>"I don't want them to forget it," said Fred, bitterly, "but they
won't carry their enmity to the extent of making an unprovoked
attack on me or any of my people."</p>

<p>"Possibly not, but you don't want to bank on the theory."</p>

<p>"You must not forget," continued the practical Whitney, "that
all we have in the world is invested in this business, and it
would be a sacrifice for us to sell out and move eastward, where
I would be without any business."</p>

<p>"You could soon make one for yourself."</p>

<p>"Well," said Whitney, thoughtfully, "I will promise to turn it
over in my mind; the associations, however, that will always cling
to this place, and particularly my sympathy for mother and Jennie,
will be the strongest influences actuating me, provided I decide
to change."</p>

<p>Mont Sterry experienced a thrill of delight, for he knew that
when a man talks in that fashion he is on the point of yielding.
He determined to urge the matter upon Jennie, and there was just
enough hope in his heart that the prospect of being on the same
side of the Mississippi with him would have some slight weight.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you speak thus, for it is certain there will
be serious trouble with the rustlers."</p>

<p>"All which emphasizes what I said earlier in the evening about
your duty to make a change of location."</p>

<p>The proposition, now that there was reason to believe that Fred
Whitney had come over to his way of thinking, struck Sterry more
favourably than before. In fact he reflected, with a shudder,
what a dismal, unattractive section this would be, after the removal
of his friends.</p>

<p>"I shall not forget your words; what you said has great influence
with me, and you need not be surprised if I bid adieu to Wyoming
within a week or a few days."</p>

<p>"It can't be too soon for your own safety, much as we shall regret
to lose your company."</p>
