<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I was aroused from my slumber, before it was yet light, by Biddon
shaking me and calling in my ear:</p>

<p>"Come, you chaps, you’ve got only two minutes to swaller yer
feed in."</p>

<p>Nat was already moving about, and I sprang to my feet, determined
to continue in my friend’s good graces, if such a thing were possible,
by a cheerful acquiescence in all his reasonable wishes. Our fire
was kindled, a hasty breakfast swallowed, and just as the sun
made its appearance above the prairie, we moved off toward the
north.</p>

<p>Long before noon we reached the Platte, and forded it at the
point where Fort Grattan now stands. The Platte, during the winter
months, is a boisterous stream of great width, but in summer it
is very shallow (from which circumstance it derives its name),
and at the dry season it almost ceases running, and dwindles down
to an innumerable number of stagnant pools. As it was now the
summer season, we walked over without more than merely wetting
our shoes. The Oregon trail follows the northern shore of this
stream to Washington Territory, or to what was Oregon at the time
of which I write. Leaving the Platte, we shaped our course toward
the northwest, so as to strike the southern spur of the Black
Hills. From Biddon’s conversation, I found that his destination
was the neighborhood of the head-waters of the Tongue or Powder
River, which have their cañons in the Black Hills.</p>

<p>As he allowed his horse to proceed upon a moderate walk, we had
no trouble in keeping him company. We generally started at the
first indication of morning, halting now and then to slake our
thirst in the numerous streams which crossed our path, and resting
an hour at noon. At sunset we struck camp upon some small stream,
cooked our evening meal, spent an hour or two in smoking and conversation,
and turned in for the night.</p>

<p>The country over which we now journeyed was much better timbered
than any through which we had yet passed. For an entire day after
crossing the Platte, we met with thousands of the ash, elm, walnut,
and cottonwood trees. The bark of the latter, I was surprised
to observe, was greatly relished by the trapper’s horse, he often
preferring it to the rich, succulent grass which so abounds in
this region. Besides this there were signs of the buffalo, antelope,
and hundreds of other animals.</p>

<p>One night we halted upon the bank of a large stream some miles
north of the Platte, which emptied into the Missouri. It was quite
broad and rapid, and near the center of the channel a small, sandy
island was visible. We passed over this while fording the stream,
and I noticed that Biddon walked around it, and surveyed several
spots with more than common interest. I did not question him then,
but at night, when we were stretched before the fire, with our
soothing pipes, I ventured the inquiry.</p>

<p>"I seed sights on that chunk of mud one time," said he, with
a dark frown.</p>

<p>"What was it?&mdash;what was it?" asked Nat, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Here’s as what don’t like to think of that time, augh!" he answered,
seeming still unwilling to refer to it.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, beginning to partake of Nat’s curiosity.</p>

<p>"It makes a feller’s blood bile; but, howsomever," he added,
brightening up, "if you wants to hear it, yer kin."</p>

<p>"We do by all means; please give it."</p>

<p>"Yas, that ar’ war’ a time of general wipin’ out, and this yer
water that now looks as black as a wolf’s mouth, <em>run red</em>
that night! It war’ nigh onto ten year ago that it happened. I
was down in Westport one day in the summer when a feller slapped
me on the shoulder and axed me ef I wanted a job. I tole him I
didn’t care much, but if he’s a mind to fork over, and it wan’t
desprit hard, and too much like work, I’s his man. He said as
how thar’ war’ a lot of fellers camped out on the prairie, as
war gwine to start for Oregon, and as wanted a guide; and heerin’
me spoken on as suthin’ extronnery, why he like to know ef I wouldn’t
go; he’d make the pay all right. I cut around the stump awhile
and at last ’cluded to go. I went out onto the perarie, and seed
the company. They were men, women, and children, ’specially the
last ones. I seed they wanted good watchin’, and I kinder hinted
they’d find trouble afore they’d reach Oregon.</p>

<p>"There weren’t many folks trampin’ these parts then, and them
as did go, had to make up thar minds to see fight and ha’r-raisin’.
B’ars and beavers, they did! The reds war the same then all over,
arter you get clear of the States, and no feller’s ha’r war his
own till he’d lost it.</p>

<p>"We started the next day, and struck the Platte afore night.
There war but twenty good men, an’ I made half of ’em stand watch
that night just to get their hands in. In course they didn’t see
nothin’, ’cept one straddlin’ chap, like this feller yer that
is called Nat. He said as how he seed wonders, he did, and thar
war a hundred reds crawlin’ round the camp all night.</p>

<p>"We went purty slow, as it weren’t best to hurry the teams; but
we hadn’t been two days on the way afore the fools got into the
all-firedest scrabble I ever seed. I don’t know what it come ’bout,
but it war so big, they split company, and part of ’em crossed
over and camped on t’other side the Platte. I tole ’em they’d
see stars purty soon, if they didn’t splice agin, but they’s too
rearin’ to do it, and I said if they’s a mind to be sich fools,
they mought be fur all me, and I’d let ’em go on alone. Howsomever,
the smallest party hung on fur me not to leave ’em, and I ’cluded
to stay with ’em as I knowed purty well they’d need me all the
time.</p>

<p>"The biggest company as had crossed the Platte, kept on by it,
and so the others said they’d leave it and cut across fur Oregon.
I tole ’em this war the best way, and so we left ’em. Them I war
with war a heap the smallest, and had but three or four men and
five or six women and children. What made things look wuss, I
seed ‘signs’ when we parted, and I knowed purty well the reds
smelt what war goin’ on. And ’bout a dozen times in the afternoon
I could see ’em off on the perarie stealin’ long and dodgin’ through
cover. I knowed that the imps were follerin’ us, seein’ the other
war a heap more powerful nor us.</p>

<p>"Things got so dubersome afore night, I said to the men ef they’d
take the advice of a feller as knowed what he war ’bout, they’d
turn round and never stop till they cotched the others; for ef
they didn’t, they’d cotch it at night; reds war ’bout them as
thick as flies. They said how ef I’s <em>’fraid</em> I mought
go back, but as for them <em>they’d</em> go through fire and blazes
’fore they would. I felt riled ’nough at this to leave ’em, and
I would ef it hadn’t been fur them poor women; they looked so
sorrerful I made up my mind to stick to ’em fur thar sake.</p>

<p>"We reached the stream just as it war growing dark, and the reds
had got so sassy, that five or six of ’em stood a little ways
off and watched us. This scart the women and men, and they axed
me what war to be done? The women cried and wanted to coax the
Injins up to give ’em sunkthin’ to get thar good will, but they
war cross and sulky, and didn’t say much.</p>

<p>"After some talk and a heap of cryin’, we ’cluded to camp on
that piece of sand in the river. The teams war drew over and we
follered. The water war some deeper nor now, and it took us a
long time to land; but we got over at last. As soon as we war
clean over, I commenced fixing up things fur the reds. We didn’t
build no fire, but put the teams together near the middle, and
the women inside ’em. There war four men without me, and I set
’em round the place to watch fur sign. I made ’em all squat flat
down on the mud close to the water, and told ’em to blaze away
at anything they seed, ef it war a beaver or otter, and gave ’em
pertickler orders not to wink both eyes at a time. I seed they’s
skerish, and there weren’t no danger of thar snoozin’ on watch.</p>

<p>"I’s pretty sartin the reds would come some of thar tricks, and
come down the river; so I went up to the upper part of the thing,
and laid in the mud myself to watch fur ’em. I knowed, too, they
wouldn’t be ’bout ’fore purty late, so I took a short nap as I
laid in the mud. When I woke up the moon war up in the sky, and
the river had riz so my pegs war in the water. I flapped out,
but didn’t see nothin’ yet. I sneaked down round by t’other fellers,
and found ’em all wide awake; and they said, too, as how they
hadn’t seen nothin’ ’cept the river war gettin’ higher, which
they kinder thought the Injins mought ’ve done. Jist as I war
going back I heard some of the purtiest singin’ in the world.
Fust, I thought it war an Injin, ef it hadn’t been so nice; then
I ’cluded it must be an angel. I listened, and found it came from
the wagons. I crept up and seed two little girls all ’lone clus
by the wagons, a singin’ sunkthin’. Shoot me! ef it didn’t make
me feel watery to see them. The moon war shinin’ down through
the flyin’ clouds, right out on ’em. They sot with their arms
round each other and war bare-headed, and ef I hadn’t knowed ’em
I’d swore they were angels sure. I axed what they were singin’
for, and they said the Injins war goin’ to come after ’em that
night, and they war singin’ to their mother in heaven to keep
’em away. Shoot me! when one of ’em throwed her little white arms
round my neck and kissed my ugly meat-trap, I couldn’t stand it.
I went up to my place again and lad down in the mud.</p>

<p>"It was gettin’ colder, and the wind comin’ up, drew the white
clouds ’fore the moon, makin’ it all black. But when it come out
agin I seed sunkthin’ comin’ down the river that looked like a
log. I dug down deeper into the mud, and set my peepers on it,
fur I knowed thar war sunkthin’ else thar, too. It come right
on and struck the mud a little ways from me. I didn’t stir ’cept
to kinder loose my knife. The log stuck a minute, and then swung
round and went down the river. I knowed the boys would see it,
and I didn’t leave my place. Thinkin’ as how this war only sent
down to see what we’d do, I war lookin’ fur other things, when
I heard a noise in the water, and, shoot me, ef a sneakin’ red
didn’t come up out of the water, and commence crawlin’ toward
whar the gals war singin’. (Jist put a little fodder on the fire.)"</p>

<p>I sprang up and threw on some fagots, and then seated myself
and anxiously awaited the rest of his story. He put away his pipe,
filled his mouth with tobacco, and, after several annoying delays,
resumed:</p>

<p>"Thar weren’t no time to lose. I crept ’long behind him mighty
sly, and afore he knowed it, come down <em>spank</em> onto him.
I didn’t make no noise nor he either. I jist grabbed his gullet
and finished him with my knife. I then crawled back agin, and,
shoot me, ef I didn’t see forty logs comin’ down on us; the river
war full of ’em.</p>

<p>"I jumped up and hollered to the other fellers to look out. They
came up aside me and stood ready, but it weren’t no use. ’Fore
we knowed it, I seed over forty of ’em ’long ’side us. We blazed
into ’em and went to usin’ our knives, but I knowed it wouldn’t
do. They set up a yell and pitched fur the wagons, while ’bout
a dozen went at us. The fust thing I knowed the whole four boys
were down and thar ha’r raised, and the women screechin’ murder.
It made me desprit, and I reckon I done some tall work that night.
Most these beauty spots on my mug come from that scrimmage. I
seed a red dart by me with that little gal as was singin’, and
cotched a dead red’s gun and let drive at him; but the gun weren’t
loaded, and so the devil run off with her.</p>

<p>"The oxes war bellerin’, the horses snortin’, and the tomahawks
stoppin’ the women’s screams; the redskins war howlin’ and yellin’
like all mad, and as I had got some big cuts and knocks, I ’cluded
it best to move quarters. So I made a jump for the stream, took
a long dive, and swam for the shore. I come up ’bout whar you’re
setting, and I made a heap of tracks ’fore daylight come."</p>

<p>"And did you never hear anything of the children captured upon
that night?"</p>

<p>"I never seed ’em agin; but I come ’cross a chap at Fort Laramie
when I went down agin, what said he’d seen a gal ’mong some the
redskins up in these parts, and I’ve thought p’r’aps it mought
be one of ’em, and agin it moughtn’t."</p>

<p>"Did you say that all happened out there?" asked Nat, jerking
his thumb toward the island mentioned, without turning his face.</p>

<p>"I reckon I did."</p>

<p>"Bet there’s a lot of Injins there now!" exclaimed he, turning
his head in that direction.</p>

<p>"Jist as like as not," returned Biddon, with a sly look at me.</p>

<p>"I’m goin’ to sleep then," and rolling himself up in his buffalo-blanket,
all but his feet, disappeared from view.</p>

<p>"It’s ’bout time to snooze, I think," remarked the trapper, in
a lower tone, turning toward me.</p>

<p>"I think so, but I suppose there need be no apprehension of molestation
from Injins, need there?"</p>

<p>Biddon looked at me a moment; then one side of his mouth expanded
into a broad grin, and he quietly remarked:</p>

<p>"Times are different from what they used to war."</p>

<p>"Biddon," said I, after a moment’s silence, "before we saw you
we camped upon one side of a stream while you were upon the other.
Now, I do not suppose you would willfully harm a stranger; but
since I have met you, I have a great desire to know why you fired
that shot at Nat. You supposed we were Indians, I presume?"</p>

<p>A quiet smile illumined the trapper’s swarthy visage; and, after
waiting a moment, he answered:</p>

<p>"The way on it war this: I seed you and Nat camping there, and
I s’pected you war gwine to tramp these parts. I watched you awhile,
and was gwine to sing out for you to come over. Then said I, ‘Biddon,
you dog, ain’t there a chance to give them a powerful scare.’
First I drawed bead on you, but when that Nat jumped up, I let
fly at him, and he kerflummuxed splendid. Howsumever, it’s time
to snooze, and I’m in for it."</p>

<p>With this, we wrapped our blankets around us, and in a few moments
were asleep.</p>

<p>On a clear summer morning, we sallied out upon the broad, open
prairie again. The trapper now struck a direction nearly due northwest
toward the Black Hills, and we proceeded with greater speed than
before. The face of the country began to change materially. Vast
groves of timber met the eye, and the soil became rich and productive.
At noon we encountered the most immense drove of buffaloes that
I ever witnessed. They were to the west of us, and proceeding
in a southern direction, cropping the grass clean as they went.
Far away, as far as the vision could reach, nothing but a sea
of black moving bodies could be distinguished. I mounted a small
knoll to ascertain the size of the drove; but only gained a clearer
idea of their enormous number. The whole western horizon, from
the extreme northwest to the southwest, was occupied solely by
them, and nothing else met the eye. They were not under way, and
yet the whole mass was moving slowly onward. The head buffaloes
would seize a mouthful of grass, and then move on a few feet and
grasp another. Those behind did the same, and the whole number
were proceeding in this manner. This constant change of their
position gave an appearance to them, as viewed from my standing-point,
similar to the long heaving of the sea after a violent storm.
It was truly a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>We approached within a short distance. They were more scattered
upon the outside, and with a little trouble the trapper managed
to insinuate himself among them. His object was to drive off a
cow which had a couple of half-grown calves by her side, but they
took the alarm too soon, and rushed off into the drove. We then
prepared to bring down one apiece. I selected an enormous bull,
and sighted for his head. I approached nigh enough to make my
aim sure, and fired. The animal raised his head, his mouth full
of grass, and glaring at me a moment, gave a snort of alarm and
plunged headlong away into the droves. At the same instant I heard
Nat’s rifle beside me, and a moment after that of the trapper.
This gave the alarm to the herd. Those near us uttered a series
of snorts, and dropping their bushy heads, bowled off at a terrific
rate. The motion was rapidly communicated to the others, and in
a few seconds the whole eastern side was rolling simultaneously
onward, like the violent countercurrent of the sea. The air was
filled with such a vast cloud of dust that the sun’s light was
darkened, and for a time it seemed we should suffocate. We remained
in our places for over an hour, when the last of these prairie
monsters thundered by. A strong wind carried the dust off to the
west, and we were at last in clear air again. Yet our appearance
was materially changed, for a thin veil of yellow dust had settled
over and completely enveloped us, and we were like walking figures
of clay.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Gave a snort of alarm and plunged headlong away
into the droves."]</p>

<p>I looked away in the direction of the herd, expecting to see
my buffalo’s lifeless form, but was considerably chagrined at
my disappointment, as was also Nat at his. The trapper’s was a
dozen yards from where it had been struck.</p>

<p>"’Pears to me," said he with a sly smile, "I heer’n your dogs
bark, but I don’t see nothin’ of no buffaloes, ogh!"</p>

<p>"I <em>hit</em> mine," I answered quickly; "I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"In the head, plump and square."</p>

<p>"Whar’d you sight yourn, Greeny?"</p>

<p>"Just back the horns, and I hit him too. If he hasn’t dropped
before this, I’ll bet he’ll have the headache for a week."</p>

<p>"B’ars and beavers, you! Them bufflers didn’t mind your shots
more nor a couple of hailstones. Do you see whar I picked mine?"
asked the trapper, pulling the buffalo’s fore-leg forward, and
disclosing the track of the bullet behind it.</p>

<p>"Isn’t a shot in the head fatal?" I asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You might hit ’em thar with a cannon-ball, and they’d git up
and run agin, and ef you’d pepper ’em all day whar you did yourn,
you’d pick the bullets out thar ha’r and they wouldn’t mind it."</p>

<p>This I afterward found to be true. No shot, however well aimed,
can reach the seat of life in the buffalo through the head, unless
it enter the eye, fair front.[1]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
[1] I may further remark, that the buffalo slain by us when lost<br/>
upon the prairie, was shot in the side as he wheeled, to run<br/>
from us, without our suspecting it was the only place in which<br/>
we could have given him a mortal wound.

</p>
</div>
<p>The trapper’s buffalo was thrown forward upon his face, his legs
bent beneath him, and dressed after the usual fashion. He was
in good condition, and we had a rich feast upon his carcass. The
trapper selected a few choice portions from the inside, relished
only by himself, and cutting several huge pieces for future use,
the rest was left for the beasts of prey.</p>

<p>We proceeded but a few miles further, and encamped upon the banks
of the Dry Fork. This is a small stream, a few miles south of
the Black Hills. There was but a foot or two of sluggish water,
and in the hot season it was often perfectly dry. Here for the
first time I was made aware of the changeable character of the
climate in this latitude. The weather, thus far, had been remarkably
clear and fine, and at noon we found the weather sometimes oppressively
warm. Toward night the wind veered around to the northwest, and
grew colder. At nightfall, when we kindled our fire, the air was
so chilly and cutting that Nat and I were in a shiver. Had it
not been for our blankets we should have suffered considerably,
though Biddon did not call his into requisition. There were a
number of cottonwood trees near at hand, which served partly to
screen us from the blast.</p>

<p>After our evening meal had been cooked, Biddon remarked:</p>

<p>"The fire must go out, boys."</p>

<p>"Why? Do you apprehend danger?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Don’t know as I do; I hain’t seed signs, but we’re gittin’ into
parts whar we’ve got to be summat skeerish."</p>

<p>"I suppose it’s about time for the Indians to come?" remarked
Nat interrogatively, with a look of fear toward the trapper.</p>

<p>"They’re ’bout these parts. Me’n Jack Javin once got into a scrimmage
yer with ’em, when we didn’t ’spect it, and jist ’cause we let
our fire burn while we snoozed. I’d seen sign though then, and
wanted to put it out, but he wan’t afeared."</p>

<p>"Let’s have ours out then," exclaimed Nat excitedly, springing
up and scattering the brands around.</p>

<p>"Needn’t mind ’bout that; it’ll go out soon enough."</p>

<p>As Nat reseated himself, Biddon continued:</p>

<p>"You see, Jarsey, them reds kin smell a white man’s fire a good
way off, and on sich a night as this, ef they’re ’bout they’ll
be bound to give him a call. You needn’t be afeared, howsumever,
to snooze, ’cause they won’t be ’bout."</p>

<p>It was too cold to enjoy our pipes, and we all bundled up for
the night’s rest. In a few moments I heard the trapper’s deep
breathing, and shortly after Nat joined him in sleep. But I found
it impossible to get to sleep myself. The ground was so cold that
my blanket could not protect me, and the cutting wind was terrible.
I used every means that I could devise, but it was of no use,
and I feared I should be compelled to either build the fire again,
or to continue walking all night to prevent freezing to death.</p>

<p>I chose the latter expedient. It was quite dark, yet I had noticed
our situation well enough, I judged, not to lose it. So grasping
my blanket in my hand, I started on a rapid run directly over
the prairie. I continued a long distance, until pretty well exhausted.
I turned to retrace my steps. My blood was warming with the exercise,
and I hurried forward, counting upon sound sleep for the remainder
of the night.</p>

<p>I continued my run for a full half hour, and then stopped in
amazement, as I saw no signs of my companions. Thinking I must
have passed the spot where they were lying, I carefully walked
back again, but still without discovering the men. I had lost
them in the darkness, and it was useless to hunt them at night.
So I concluded to wait till morning, feeling sure that they could
be at no great distance. I now commenced searching for a suitable
place for myself, and at last hit upon a small depression in the
prairie. There was a large stone imbedded in the earth on one
side, which served to protect me from the chilling wind. As I
nestled down, beside this, such a feeling of warmth and comfort
came over me that I congratulated myself upon what at first seemed
a misfortune.</p>

<p>Lying thus, just on the verge of sleep, my nerves painfully alive
to the slightest sound, I suddenly felt a trembling of the ground.
At first it seemed a dream; but, as I became fully awake, I started
in terror and listened. I raised my head, but heard no sound,
and still in the most perplexing wonder sank down again, hoping
it would shortly cease. But there was a steady, regular increase,
and presently I distinguished millions of faint tremblings, like
the distant mutterings of thunder. Gradually these grew plainer
and more distinct, and finally I could distinguish sounds like
the tread of innumerable feet upon the prairie. Still at a loss
to account for this strange occurrence, I listened, every nerve
in my body strung to its highest tension. Still louder and louder
grew the approaching thunder, and every second the jar of the
earth became more perceptible. Suddenly the truth flashed upon
me&mdash;<em>a herd of buffaloes were approaching</em>.</p>

<p>Terror for an instant held me dumb when I realized this awful
danger. My first resolve was to rush forth and warn Nat and Biddon;
but I reflected that they must have been awakened, ere this, and
that I could do nothing to ward off the peril which threatened
all alike. Springing to my feet, I paused a second to collect
my tumultuous thoughts. Could I reach the timber, I could ascend
a tree and be beyond danger; but I knew not what direction to
take, and there was no time to spare. To remain still was to be
trampled to death; to rush away could save me but a few moments
longer. God of heaven! what a death!</p>

<p>Louder and louder grew the thundering tread of the animals, and
I stood like a madman, the cold sweat pouring off me, tormented
by a thousand agonizing thoughts, and expecting death each moment!
Nearer and nearer came the rattle of the clamping hoofs, and I
stood rooted to the spot!</p>

<p>Sinking on my knees, I implored mercy of the One who could give
it in this moment of dire necessity; and while on my knees the
means of preservation presented itself.</p>

<p>"Strange!" I exclaimed, breathing deeply, "that I did not think
of it before."</p>

<p>I have said that I was in a sort of depression or hollow in the
earth, and that a large stone was imbedded on one side. Now a
safer and more secure shelter could not have been found in this
emergency. I wrapped my blanket around me, and crept as far beneath
it as I could, and I was saved!</p>

<p>A few minutes later, and a dark body plunged headlong over me
with the rapidity of lightning, followed instantly by another
and another, and I knew the herd were thundering past. For a long
time I lay there, beneath these thousands of feet, one of which
would have been sufficient to kill me. The incessant crackling
of their hoofs, and rattling of their horns, sounded like the
discharge of musketry. Once a ponderous body tumbled over the
rock which sheltered me, and I caught sight of a dark, writhing,
bellowing mass, and the next instant it regained its feet and
disappeared.</p>

<p>It must have been an hour that I lay here, ere the last animal
leaped over me. Then I looked up and saw the stars shining overhead.
My joy at the sight of those glittering orbs cannot be expressed.
I arose to my feet, and looked about me. It was too dark to discern
objects, yet I could hear the rapidly retreating footfalls of
the herd in the distance, and I knew I had been saved from a frightful
death. Sinking to the earth I offered a sincere prayer of gratitude
to the Almighty for his miraculous preservation of my life!</p>
