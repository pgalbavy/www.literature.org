<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

<P>D'Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris.  He went
therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second,
determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should
choose.  Besides, his intention was formed to make the brave
Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or
weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which
generally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and
vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and
weakened - if conquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist;
if a conqueror, he is accused of foul play and want of courage.</P>
<P>Now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure
seeker, or our readers must have already perceived that
D'Artagnan was not an ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to
himself that his death was inevitable, he did not make up his
mind to die quietly, as one less courageous and less restrained
might have done in his place.  He reflected upon the different
characters of men he had to fight with, and began to view his
situation more clearly.  He hoped, by means of loyal excuses, to
make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and austere bearing
pleased him much.  He flattered himself he should be able to
frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he
might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital
which, well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule.  As to
the astute Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and
supposing he should be able to get so far, he determined to
dispatch him in good style or at least, by hitting him in the
face, as Caesar recommended his soldiers do to those of Pompey,
to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.</P>
<P>In addition to this, D'Artagnan possessed that invincible stock
of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in
his heart: &quot;Endure nothing from anyone but the king, the
cardinal, and Monsieur de Treville.&quot;  He flew, then, rather than
walked, toward the convent of the Carmes Dechausses, or rather
Deschaux, as it was called at that period, a sort of building
without a window, surrounded by barren fields - an accessory to
the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the place
for the duels of men who had no time to lose.</P>
<P>When D'Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which
extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting
about five minutes, and twelve o'clock was striking.  He was,
then, as punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous
casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say.</P>
<P>Athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it
had been dressed anew by M. de Treville's surgeon, was seated on
a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his
feather even touching the ground.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Athos, &quot;I have engaged two of my friends as
seconds; but these two friends are not yet come, at which I am
astonished, as it is not at all their custom.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have no seconds on my part, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;for
having only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but
Monsieur de Treville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who
has the honor to be, in some degree, one of his friends.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos reflected for an instant.  &quot;You know no one but Monsieur de
Treville?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, monsieur, I know only him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but then,&quot; continued Athos, speaking half to himself, &quot;if
I kill you, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not too much so,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, with a bow that was not
deficient in dignity, &quot;since you do me the honor to draw a sword
with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I
can tell you.  But I will take the left hand - it is my custom in
such circumstances.  Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use
either hand easily.  And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a
left-handed man is very troublesome to people who are not
prepared for it.  I regret I did not inform you sooner of this
circumstance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You have truly, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, bowing again, &quot;a
courtesy, for which, I assure you, I am very grateful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You confuse me,&quot; replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; &quot;let
us talk of something else, if you please.  Ah, s'blood, how you
have hurt me!  My shoulder quite burns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you would permit me - &quot; said D'Artagnan, with timidity.</P>
<P>&quot;What, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have a miraculous balsam for wounds - a balsam given to me by
my mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would
cure you; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured - 
well, sir, it would still do me a great honor to be your man.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to
his courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.</P>
<P>&quot;PARDIEU, monsieur!&quot; said Athos, &quot;that's a proposition that
pleases me; not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors
of the gentleman.  Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of
the time of Charlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his
model.  Unfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great
emperor, we live in the times of the cardinal; and three days
hence, however well the secret might be guarded, it would be
known, I say, that we were to fight, and our combat would be
prevented.  I think these fellows will never come.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you are in haste, monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, with the same
simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to
put off the duel for three days, &quot;and if it be your will to
dispatch me at once, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is another word which pleases me,&quot; cried Athos, with a
gracious nod to D'Artagnan.  &quot;That did not come from a man
without a heart.  Monsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I
foresee plainly that if we don't kill each other, I shall
hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation.  We will wait
for these gentlemen, so please you; I have plenty of time, and it
will be more correct.  Ah, here is one of them, I believe.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos
appeared.</P>
<P>&quot;What!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, &quot;is your first witness Monsieur
Porthos?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, that disturbs you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By no means.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And here is the second.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and
perceived Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;What!&quot; cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than
before, &quot;your second witness is Monsieur Aramis?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doubtless!  Are you not aware that we are never seen one without
the others, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the
Guards, at court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or
the Three Inseparables?  And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau - &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;From Tarbes,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,&quot; said
Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;My faith!&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;you are well named, gentlemen;
and my adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at
least that your union is not founded upon contrasts.&quot;</P>
<P>In the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos,
and then turning toward D'Artagnan, stood quite astonished.</P>
<P>Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and
relinquished his cloak.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ah!&quot; said he, &quot;what does this mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is the gentleman I am going to fight with,&quot; said Athos,
pointing to D'Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the
same gesture.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, it is with him I am also going to fight,&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;But not before one o'clock,&quot; replied D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;And I also am to fight with this gentleman,&quot; said Aramis, coming
in his turn onto the place.</P>
<P>&quot;But not until two o'clock,&quot; said D'Artagnan, with the same
calmness.</P>
<P>&quot;But what are you going to fight about, Athos?&quot; asked Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith! I don't very well know.  He hurt my shoulder.  And you,
Porthos?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faith!  I am going to fight - because I am going to fight,&quot;
answered Porthos, reddening.</P>
<P>Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile
pass over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, &quot;We had a
short discussion upon dress.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you, Aramis?&quot; asked Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, ours is a theological quarrel,&quot; replied Aramis, making a
sign to D'Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.</P>
<P>Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,&quot;
said the Gascon.</P>
<P>&quot;Decidedly, this is a clever fellow,&quot; murmured Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;And now you are assembled, gentlemen,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;permit
me to offer you my apologies.</P>
<P>At this word APOLOGIES, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a
haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was
the reply of Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;You do not understand me, gentlemen,&quot; said D'Artagnan, throwing
up his head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment
gilded by a bright ray of the sun.  &quot;I asked to be excused in
case I should not be able to discharge my debt to all three; for
Monsieur Athos has the right to kill me first, which I must abate
your valor in your own estimation, Monsieur Porthos, and render
yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis.  And now, gentlemen, I
repeat, excuse me, but on that account only, and - on guard!&quot;</P>
<P>At these words, with the most gallant air possible, D'Artagnan
drew his sword.</P>
<P>The blood had mounted to the head of D'Artagnan, and at that
moment he would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers
in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos,
and Aramis.</P>
<P>It was a quarter past midday.  The sun was in its zenith, and the
spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full
ardor.</P>
<P>&quot;It is very hot,&quot; said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, &quot;and
yet I cannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound
begin to bleed again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur
with the sight of blood which he has not drawn from me himself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true, Monsieur,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;and whether drawn
by myself or another, I assure you I shall always view with
regret the blood of so brave a gentleman.  I will therefore fight
in my doublet, like yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come, enough of such compliments!&quot; cried Porthos.
&quot;Remember, we are waiting for our turns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such
incongruities,&quot; interrupted Aramis.  &quot;For my part, I think what
they say is very well said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When you please, monsieur,&quot; said Athos, putting himself on
guard.</P>
<P>&quot;I waited your orders,&quot; said D'Artagnan, crossing swords.</P>
<P>But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the
Guards of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the
corner of the convent.</P>
<P>&quot;The cardinal's Guards!&quot; cried Aramis and Porthos at the same
time.  &quot;Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!&quot;</P>
<P>But it was too late.  The two combatants had been seen in a
position which left no doubt of their intentions.</P>
<P>&quot;Halloo!&quot; cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign
to his men to do so likewise, &quot;halloo, Musketeers?  Fighting
here, are you?  And the edicts?  What is become of them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,&quot; said Athos,
full of rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the
preceding day.  &quot;If we were to see you fighting, I can assure you
that we would make no effort to prevent you.  Leave us alone,
then, and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to
yourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Jussac, &quot;it is with great regret that I
pronounce the thing impossible.  Duty before everything.
Sheathe, then, if you please, and follow us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Aramis, parodying Jussac, &quot;it would afford us
great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon
ourselves; but unfortunately the thing is impossible - Monsieur de
Treville has forbidden it.  Pass on your way, then; it is the
best thing to do.&quot;</P>
<P>This raillery exasperated Jussac.  &quot;We will charge upon you,
then,&quot; said he, &quot;if you disobey.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There are five of them,&quot; said Athos, half aloud, &quot;and we are but
three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for,
on my part, I declare I will never appear again before the
captain as a conquered man.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while
Jussac drew up his soldiers.</P>
<P>This short interval was sufficient to determine D'Artagnan on the
part he was to take.  It was one of those events which decide the
life of a man; it was a choice between the king and the
cardinal - the choice made, it must be persisted in.  To fight,
that was to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was
to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the
king himself.  All this young man perceived, and yet, to his
praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second.  Turning
towards Athos and his friends, &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said he, &quot;allow me to
correct your words, if you please.  You said you were but three,
but it appears to me we are four.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you are not one of us,&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;That's true,&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;I have not the uniform, but I
have the spirit.  My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it,
monsieur, and that impels me on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Withdraw, young man,&quot; cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his
gestures and the expression of his countenance, had guessed
D'Artagnan's design.  &quot;You may retire; we consent to that.  Save
your skin; begone quickly.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan did not budge.</P>
<P>&quot;Decidedly, you are a brave fellow,&quot; said Athos, pressing the
young man's hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come, choose your part,&quot; replied Jussac.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Porthos to Aramis, &quot;we must do something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur is full of generosity,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>But all three reflected upon the youth of D'Artagnan, and dreaded
his inexperience.</P>
<P>&quot;We should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the
addition of a boy,&quot; resumed Athos; &quot;and yet it will not be the
less said we were four men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but to yield!&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;That IS difficult,&quot; replied Athos.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.</P>
<P>&quot;Try me, gentlemen,&quot; said he, &quot;and I swear to you by my honor
that I will not go hence if we are conquered.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is your name, my brave fellow?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, forward!&quot;
cried Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, gentlemen, have you decided?&quot; cried Jussac for the third
time.</P>
<P>&quot;It is done, gentlemen,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;And what is your choice?&quot; asked Jussac.</P>
<P>&quot;We are about to have the honor of charging you,&quot; replied Aramis,
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the
other.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! You resist, do you?&quot; cried Jussac.</P>
<P>&quot;S'blood; does that astonish you?&quot;</P>
<P>And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which
however did not exclude a certain degree of method.</P>
<P>Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal's.
Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two
adversaries.  As to D'Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.</P>
<P>The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through
his side - not from fear, God he thanked, he had not the shade of
it, but with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning
ten times round his adversary, and changing his ground and his
guard twenty times.  Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade,
and had had much practice; nevertheless it required all his skill
to defend himself against an adversary who, active and energetic,
departed every instant from received rules, attacking him on all
sides at once, and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest
respect for his own epidermis.</P>
<P>This contest at length exhausted Jussac's patience.  Furious at
being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he
became warm and began to make mistakes.  D'Artagnan, who though
wanting in practice had a sound theory, redoubled his agility.
Jussac, anxious to put an end to this, springing forward, aimed a
terrible thrust at his adversary, but the latter parried it; and
while Jussac was recovering himself, glided like a serpent
beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body.  Jussac
fell like a dead mass.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field
of battle.</P>
<P>Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed
him warmly.  Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and
able to defend himself.</P>
<P>Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits.  Porthos had
received a thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his
thigh.  But neither of these two wounds was serious, and they
only fought more earnestly.</P>
<P>Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did
not give way a foot.  He only changed his sword hand, and fought
with his left hand.</P>
<P>According to the laws of dueling at that period, D'Artagnan was
at liberty to assist whom he pleased.  While he was endeavoring
to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need, he
caught a glance from Athos.  The glance was of sublime eloquence.
Athos would have died rather than appeal for help; but he could
look, and with that look ask assistance.  D'Artagnan interpreted
it; with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac,
crying, &quot;To me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay you!&quot;</P>
<P>Cahusac turned.  It was time; for Athos, whose great courage
alone supported him, sank upon his knee.</P>
<P>&quot;S'blood!&quot; cried he to D'Artagnan, &quot;do not kill him, young man, I
beg of you.  I have an old affair to settle with him when I am
cured and sound again.  Disarm him only - make sure of his sword.
That's it!  Very well done!&quot;</P>
<P>The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of
Cahusac fly twenty paces from him.  D'Artagnan and Cahusac sprang
forward at the same instant, the one to recover, the other to
obtain, the sword; but D'Artagnan, being the more active, reached
it first and placed his foot upon it.</P>
<P>Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed,
seized his rapier, and returned toward D'Artagnan; but on his way
he met Athos, who during his relief which D'Artagnan had procured
him had recovered his breath, and who, for fear that D'Artagnan
would kill his enemy, wished to resume the fight.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to
leave him alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword
thrust through his throat.</P>
<P>At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast
of his fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.</P>
<P>There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat.  Porthos made a
thousand flourishes, asking Bicarat what o'clock it could be, and
offering him his compliments upon his brother's having just
obtained a company in the regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he
might, he gained nothing.  Bicarat was one of those iron men who
never fell dead.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish.  The watch might come
up and take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or
cardinalists.  Athos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan surrounded Bicarat,
and required him to surrender.  Though alone against all and with
a wound in his thigh, Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who
had risen upon his elbow, cried out to him to yield.  Bicarat was
a Gascon, as D'Artagnan was; he turned a deaf ear, and contented
himself with laughing, and between two parries finding time to
point to a spot of earth with his sword, &quot;Here,&quot; cried he,
parodying a verse of the Bible, &quot;here will Bicarat die; for I
only am left, and they seek my life.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But there are four against you; leave off, I command you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, if you command me, that's another thing,&quot; said Bicarat.  &quot;As
you are my commander, it is my duty to obey.&quot;  And springing
backward, he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the
necessity of surrendering it, threw the pieces over the convent
wall, and crossed him arms, whistling a cardinalist air.</P>
<P>Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy.  The Musketeers
saluted Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their
sheaths.  D'Artagnan did the same.  Then, assisted by Bicarat,
the only one left standing, he bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of
Aramis's adversaries who was only wounded, under the porch of the
convent.  The fourth, as we have said, was dead.  They then rang
the bell, and carrying away four swords out of five, they took
their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the hotel of M. de
Treville.</P>
<P>They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street
and taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it
became a triumphal march.  The heart of D'Artagnan swam in
delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them
tenderly.</P>
<P>&quot;If I am not yet a Musketeer,&quot; said he to his new friends, as he
passed through the gateway of M. de Treville's hotel, &quot;at least I
have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven't I?&quot;</P></div>
