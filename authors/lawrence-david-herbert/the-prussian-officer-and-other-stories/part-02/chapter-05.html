<p>Soon she came again with the tray, followed by Fr&auml;ulein Hesse.  The
two women watched him eat, watched the pride and wonder of his
being, as he sat there blond and na&iuml;f again.  Emilie felt rich and
complete.  Ida was a lesser thing than herself.</p>

<p>&quot;And what are you going to do?&quot; asked Fr&auml;ulein Hesse, jealous.</p>

<p>&quot;I must get away,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>But words had no meaning for him.  What did it matter?  He had the
inner satisfaction and liberty.</p>

<p>&quot;But you'll want a bicycle,&quot; said Ida Hesse.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Emilie sat silent, removed and yet with him, connected with him in
passion.  She looked from this talk of bicycles and escape.</p>

<p>They discussed plans.  But in two of them was the one will, that
Bachmann should stay with Emilie.  Ida Hesse was an outsider.</p>

<p>It was arranged, however, that Ida's lover should put out his
bicycle, leave it at the hut where he sometimes watched.  Bachmann
should fetch it in the night, and ride into France.  The hearts of
all three beat hot in suspense, driven to thought.  They sat in a
fire of agitation.</p>

<p>Then Bachmann would get away to America, and Emilie would come and
join him.  They would be in a fine land then.  The tale burned up
again.</p>

<p>Emilie and Ida had to go round to Franz Brand's lodging.  They
departed with slight leave-taking.  Bachmann sat in the dark,
hearing the bugle for retreat sound out of the night.  Then he
remembered his post card to his mother.  He slipped out after
Emilie, gave it her to post.  His manner was careless and
victorious, hers shining and trustful.  He slipped back to shelter.</p>

<p>There he sat on the side of the bed, thinking.  Again he went over
the events of the afternoon, remembering his own anguish of
apprehension because he had known he could not climb the wall
without fainting with fear.  Still, a flush of shame came alight in
him at the memory.  But he said to himself:  &quot;What does it matter? - 
I can't help it, well then I can't.  If I go up a height, I get
absolutely weak, and can't help myself.&quot;  Again memory came over
him, and a gush of shame, like fire.  But he sat and endured it.
It had to be endured, admitted, and accepted.  &quot;I'm not a coward,
for all that,&quot; he continued.  &quot;I'm not afraid of danger.  If I'm
made that way, that heights melt me and make me let go my water&quot; - 
it was torture for him to pluck at this truth - &quot;if I'm made like
that, I shall have to abide by it, that's all.  It isn't all of
me.&quot;  He thought of Emilie, and was satisfied.  &quot;What I am, I am;
and let it be enough,&quot; he thought.</p>

<p>Having accepted his own defect, he sat thinking, waiting for
Emilie, to tell her.  She came at length, saying that Franz could
not arrange about his bicycle this night.  It was broken.  Bachmann
would have to stay over another day.</p>

<p>They were both happy.  Emilie, confused before Ida, who was excited
and prurient, came again to the young man.  She was stiff and
dignified with an agony of unusedness.  But he took her between his
hands, and uncovered her, and enjoyed almost like madness her
helpless, virgin body that suffered so strongly, and that took its
joy so deeply.  While the moisture of torment and modesty was still
in her eyes, she clasped him closer, and closer, to the victory and
the deep satisfaction of both of them.  And they slept together, he
in repose still satisfied and peaceful, and she lying close in her
static reality.</p>
