<P>
THE night after his conversation with Eleanor was the first
night of the bishop's insomnia. It was the definite beginning of
a new phase in his life.
<P>
Doctors explain to us that the immediate cause of insomnia is
always some poisoned or depleted state of the body, and no doubt
the fatigues and hasty meals of the day had left the bishop in a
state of unprecedented chemical disorder, with his nerves
irritated by strange compounds and unsoothed by familiar
lubricants. But chemical disorders follow mental disturbances,
and the core and essence of his trouble was an intellectual
distress. For the first time in his life he was really in doubt,
about himself, about his way of living, about all his
persuasions. It was a general doubt. It was not a specific
suspicion upon this point or that. It was a feeling of detachment
and unreality at once extraordinarily vague and extraordinarily
oppressive. It was as if he discovered himself flimsy and
transparent in a world of minatory solidity and opacity. It was
as if he found himself made not of flesh and blood but of tissue
paper.
<P>
But this intellectual insecurity extended into his physical
sensations. It affected his feeling in his skin, as if it were
not absolutely his own skin.
<P>
And as he lay there, a weak phantom mentally and bodily, an
endless succession and recurrence of anxieties for which he could
find no reassurance besieged him.
<P>
Chief of this was his distress for Eleanor.
<P>
She was the central figure in this new sense of illusion in
familiar and trusted things. It was not only that the world of
his existence which had seemed to be the whole universe had
become diaphanous and betrayed vast and uncontrollable realities
beyond it, but his daughter had as it were suddenly opened a door
in this glassy sphere of insecurity that had been his abiding
refuge, a door upon the stormy rebel outer world, and she stood
there, young, ignorant, confident, adventurous, ready to step
out.
<P>
"Could it be possible that she did not believe?"
<P>
He saw her very vividly as he had seen her in the dining-room,
slender and upright, half child, half woman, so fragile and so
fearless. And the door she opened thus carelessly gave upon a
stormy background like one of the stormy backgrounds that were
popular behind portrait Dianas in eighteenth century paintings.
Did she believe that all be had taught her, all the life he led
was--what was her phrase?--a kind of magic world, not really
real?
<P>
He groaned and turned over and repeated the words:
"A kind of magic world--not really real!"
<P>
The wind blew through the door she opened, and scattered
everything in the room. And still she held the door open.
<P>
He was astonished at himself. He started up in swift
indignation. Had he not taught the child? Had he not brought her
up in an atmosphere of faith? What right had she to turn upon him
in this matter? It was--indeed it was--a sort of insolence, a
lack of reverence....
<P>
It was strange he had not perceived this at the time.
<P>
But indeed at the first mention of "questionings" he ought to
have thundered. He saw that quite clearly now. He ought to have
cried out and said, "On your knees, my Norah, and ask pardon of
God!"
<P>
Because after all faith is an emotional thing....
<P>
He began to think very rapidly and copiously of things he ought
to have said to Eleanor. And now the eloquence of reverie was
upon him. In a little time he was also addressing the tea-party
at Morrice Deans'. Upon them too he ought to have thundered. And
he knew now also all that he should have said to the recalcitrant
employer. Thunder also. Thunder is surely the privilege of the
higher clergy--under Jove.
<P>
But why hadn't he thundered?
<P>
He gesticulated in the darkness, thrust out a clutching hand.
<P>
There are situations that must be gripped--gripped firmly.
And without delay. In the middle ages there had been grip enough
in a purple glove.
<P>
(2)
<P>
<P>
From these belated seizures of the day's lost opportunities the
bishop passed to such a pessimistic estimate of the church as had
never entered his mind before.
<P>
It was as if he had fallen suddenly out of a spiritual balloon
into a world of bleak realism. He found himself asking
unprecedented and devastating questions, questions that implied
the most fundamental shiftings of opinion. Why was the church
such a failure? Why had it no grip upon either masters or men
amidst this vigorous life of modern industrialism, and why had it
no grip upon the questioning young? It was a tolerated thing, he
felt, just as sometimes he had felt that the Crown was a
tolerated thing. He too was a tolerated thing; a curious
survival....
<P>
This was not as things should be. He struggled to recover a
proper attitude. But he remained enormously dissatisfied....
<P>
The church was no Levite to pass by on the other side away from
the struggles and wrongs of the social conflict. It had no right
when the children asked for the bread of life to offer them
Gothic stone....
<P>
He began to make interminable weak plans for fulfilling his
duty to his diocese and his daughter.
<P>
What could he do to revivify his clergy? He wished he had more
personal magnetism, he wished he had a darker and a larger
presence. He wished he had not been saddled with Whippham's
rather futile son as his chaplain. He wished he had a dean
instead of being his own dean. With an unsympathetic rector. He
wished he had it in him to make some resounding appeal. He might
of course preach a series of thumping addresses and sermons,
rather on the lines of "Fors Clavigera," to masters and men, in
the Cathedral. Only it was so difficult to get either masters or
men into the Cathedral.
<P>
Well, if the people will not come to the bishop the bishop must
go out to the people. Should he go outside the Cathedral--to
the place where the trains met?
<P>
Interweaving with such thoughts the problem of Eleanor rose
again into his consciousness.
<P>
Weren't there books she ought to read? Weren't there books she
ought to be made to read? And books--and friends--that ought
to be imperatively forbidden? Imperatively!
<P>
But how to define the forbidden?
<P>
He began to compose an address on Modern Literature
(so-called).
<P>
It became acrimonious.
<P>
Before dawn the birds began to sing.
<P>
His mind had seemed to be a little tranquillized, there had
been a distinct feeling of subsidence sleepwards, when first one
and then another little creature roused itself and the bishop to
greet the gathering daylight.
<P>
It became a little clamour, a misty sea of sound in which
individuality appeared and disappeared. For a time a distant
cuckoo was very perceptible, like a landmark looming up over a
fog, like the cuckoo in the Pastoral Symphony.
<P>
The bishop tried not to heed these sounds, but they were by
their very nature insistent sounds. He lay disregarding them
acutely.
<P>
Presently he pulled the coverlet over his ears.
<P>
A little later he sat up in bed.
<P>
Again in a slight detail he marked his strange and novel
detachment from the world of his upbringing. His hallucination of
disillusionment had spread from himself and his church and his
faith to the whole animate creation. He knew that these were the
voices of "our feathered songsters," that this was "a joyous
chorus" greeting the day. He knew that a wakeful bishop ought to
bless these happy creatures, and join with them by reciting Ken's
morning hymn. He made an effort that was more than half habit, to
repeat and he repeated with a scowling face and the voice of a
schoolmaster:
<P>
<P>
"Awake my soul, and with the sun
<P>
 Thy daily stage of duty run...."
<P>
<P>
He got no further. He stopped short, sat still, thinking what
utterly detestable things singing birds were. A. blackbird had
gripped his attention. Never had he heard such vain repetitions.
He struggled against the dark mood of criticism. "He prayeth best
who loveth best--"
<P>
No, he did not love the birds. It was useless to pretend.
Whatever one may say about other birds a cuckoo is a low
detestable cad of a bird.
<P>
Then the bishop began to be particularly tormented by a bird
that made a short, insistent, wheezing sound at regular intervals
of perhaps twenty seconds. If a bird could have whooping-cough,
that, he thought, was the sort of whoop it would have. But even
if it had whooping-cough he could not pity it. He hung in its
intervals waiting for the return of the wheeze.
<P>
And then that blackbird reasserted itself. It had a rich
boastful note; it seemed proud of its noisy reiteration of simple
self-assertion. For some obscure reason the phrase "oleographic
sounds" drifted into the bishop's thoughts. This bird produced
the peculiar and irrational impression that it had recently made
a considerable sum of money by shrewd industrialism. It was, he
thought grimly, a genuine Princhester blackbird.
<P>
This wickedly uncharitable reference to his diocese ran all
unchallenged through the bishop's mind. And others no less wicked
followed it.
<P>
Once during his summer holidays in Florence he and Lady Ella
had subscribed to an association for the protection of
song-birds. He recalled this now with a mild wonder. It seemed to
him that perhaps after all it was as well to let fruit-growers
and Italians deal with singing-birds in their own way. Perhaps
after all they had a wisdom....
<P>
He passed his hands over his face. The world after all is not
made entirely for singing-birds; there is such a thing as
proportion. Singing-birds may become a luxury, an indulgence, an
excess.
<P>
Did the birds eat the fruit in Paradise?
<P>
Perhaps there they worked for some collective musical effect,
had some sort of conductor in the place of this--hullabaloo....
<P>
He decided to walk about the room for a time and then remake
his bed....
<P>
The sunrise found the bishop with his head and shoulders out of
the window trying to see that blackbird. He just wanted to look
at it. He was persuaded it was a quite exceptional blackbird.
<P>
Again came that oppressive sense of the futility of the
contemporary church, but this time it came in the most grotesque
form. For hanging half out of the casement he was suddenly
reminded of St. Francis of Assisi, and how at his rebuke the
wheeling swallow stilled their cries.
<P>
But it was all so different then.
<P>
(3)
<P>
<P>
It was only after he had passed four similar nights, with
intervening days of lassitude and afternoon siestas, that the
bishop realized that he was in the grip of insomnia.
<P>
He did not go at once to a doctor, but he told his trouble to
every one he met and received much tentative advice. He had meant
to have his talk with Eleanor on the morning next after their
conversation in the dining-room, but his bodily and spiritual
anaemia prevented him.
<P>
The fifth night was the beginning of the Whitsuntide Ember
week, and he wore a red cassock and had a distracting and rather
interesting day welcoming his ordination candidates. They had a
good effect upon him; we spiritualize ourselves when we seek to
spiritualize others, and he went to bed in a happier frame of
mind than he had done since the day of the shock. He woke in the
night, but he woke much more himself than he had been since the
trouble began. He repeated that verse of Ken's:
<P>
"When in the night I sleepless lie,
My soul with heavenly thoughts supply;
Let no ill dreams disturb my rest,
No powers of darkness me molest."
<P>
<P>
Almost immediately after these there floated into his mind, as
if it were a message, the dear familiar words:
<P>
"He giveth his Beloved sleep."
<P>
<P>
These words irradiated and soothed him quite miraculously, the
clouds of doubt seemed to dissolve and vanish and leave him safe
and calm under a clear sky; he knew those words were a promise,
and very speedily he fell asleep and slept until he was called.
<P>
But the next day was a troubled one. Whippham had muddled his
timetable and crowded his afternoon; the strike of the transport
workers had begun, and the ugly noises they made at the tramway
depot, where they were booing some one, penetrated into the
palace. He had to snatch a meal between services, and the sense
of hurry invaded his afternoon lectures to the candidates. He
hated hurry in Ember week. His ideal was one of quiet serenity,
of grave things said slowly, of still, kneeling figures, of a
sort of dark cool spiritual germination. But what sort of dark
cool spiritual germination is possible with an ass like Whippham
about?
<P>
In the fresh courage of the morning the bishop had arranged for
that talk with Eleanor he had already deferred too long, and this
had proved less satisfactory than he had intended it to be.
<P>
The bishop's experience with the ordination candidates was
following the usual course. Before they came there was something
bordering upon distaste for the coming invasion; then always
there was an effect of surprise at the youth and faith of the
neophytes and a real response of the spirit to the occasion.
Throughout the first twenty-four hours they were all simply
neophytes, without individuality to break up their uniformity of
self-devotion. Then afterwards they began to develop little
personal traits, and scarcely ever were these pleasing traits.
Always one or two of them would begin haunting the bishop, giving
way to an appetite for special words, special recognitions. He
knew the expression of that craving on their faces. He knew the
way-laying movements in room and passage that presently began.
<P>
This time in particular there was a freckled underbred young
man who handed in what was evidently a carefully prepared
memorandum upon what he called "my positions." Apparently he had
a muddle of doubts about the early fathers and the dates of the
earlier authentic copies of the gospels, things of no conceivable
significance.
<P>
The bishop glanced through this bale of papers--it had of
course no index and no synopsis, and some of the pages were not
numbered--handed it over to Whippham, and when he proved, as
usual, a broken reed, the bishop had the brilliant idea of
referring the young man to Canon Bliss (of Pringle), "who has a
special knowledge quite beyond my own in this field."
<P>
But he knew from the young man's eye even as he said this that
it was not going to put him off for more than a day or so.
<P>
The immediate result of glancing over these papers was,
however, to enhance in the bishop's mind a growing disposition to
minimize the importance of all dated and explicit evidences and
arguments for orthodox beliefs, and to resort to vague symbolic
and liberal interpretations, and it was in this state that he
came to his talk with Eleanor.
<P>
He did not give her much time to develop her objections. He met
her half way and stated them for her, and overwhelmed her with
sympathy and understanding. She had been "too literal." "Too
literal" was his keynote. He was a little astonished at the
liberality of his own views. He had been getting along now for
some years without looking into his own opinions too closely and
he was by no means prepared to discover how far he had come to
meet his daughter's scepticisms. But he did meet them. He met
them so thoroughly that he almost conveyed that hers was a
needlessly conservative and oldfashioned attitude.
<P>
Occasionally he felt he was being a little evasive, but she did
not seem to notice it. As she took his drift, her relief and
happiness were manifest. And he had never noticed before how
clear and pretty her eyes were; they were the most honest eyes he
had ever seen. She looked at him very steadily as he explained,
and lit up at his points. She brightened wonderfully as she
realized that after all they were not apart, they had not
differed; simply they had misunderstood....
<P>
And before he knew where he was, and in a mere parenthetical
declaration of liberality, he surprised himself by conceding her
demand for Newnham even before she had repeated it. It helped his
case wonderfully.
<P>
"Call in every exterior witness you can. The church will
welcome them.... No, I want you to go, my dear...."
<P>
But his mind was stirred again to its depths by this
discussion. And in particular he was surprised and a little
puzzled by this Newnham concession and the necessity of making
his new attitude clear to Lady Ella....
<P>
It was with a sense of fatality that he found himself awake
again that night, like some one lying drowned and still and yet
perfectly conscious at the bottom of deep cold water.
<P>
He repeated, "He giveth his Beloved sleep," but all the
conviction had gone out of the words.
<P>
(4)
<P>
<P>
Neither the bishop's insomnia nor his incertitudes about
himself and his faith developed in a simple and orderly manner.
There were periods of sustained suffering and periods of
recovery; it was not for a year or so that he regarded these
troubles as more than acute incidental interruptions of his
general tranquillity or realized that he was passing into a new
phase of life and into a new quality of thought. He told every
one of the insomnia and no one of his doubts; these he betrayed
only by an increasing tendency towards vagueness, symbolism,
poetry and toleration. Eleanor seemed satisfied with his
exposition; she did not press for further enlightenment. She
continued all her outward conformities except that after a time
she ceased to communicate; and in September she went away to
Newnham. Her doubts had not visibly affected Clementina or her
other sisters, and the bishop made no further attempts to explore
the spiritual life of his family below the surface of its formal
acquiescence.
<P>
As a matter of fact his own spiritual wrestlings were almost
exclusively nocturnal. During his spells of insomnia he led a
curiously double existence. In the daytime he was largely the
self he had always been, able, assured, ecclesiastical, except
that he was a little jaded and irritable or sleepy instead of
being quick and bright; he believed in God and the church and the
Royal Family and himself securely; in the wakeful night time he
experienced a different and novel self, a bare-minded self,
bleakly fearless at its best, shamelessly weak at its worst,
critical, sceptical, joyless, anxious. The anxiety was quite the
worst element of all. Something sat by his pillow asking grey
questions: "What are you doing? Where are you going? Is it really
well with the children? Is it really well with the church? Is it
really well with the country? Are you indeed doing anything at
all? Are you anything more than an actor wearing a costume in an
archaic play? The people turn their backs on you."
<P>
He would twist over on his pillow. He would whisper hymns and
prayers that had the quality of charms.
<P>
"He giveth his Beloved sleep"; that answered many times, and
many times it failed.
<P>
The labour troubles of 1912 eased off as the year wore on, and
the bitterness of the local press over the palace abated very
considerably. Indeed there was something like a watery gleam of
popularity when he brought down his consistent friend, the dear
old Princess Christiana of Hoch and Unter, black bonnet,
deafness, and all, to open a new wing of the children's hospital.
The Princhester conservative paper took the occasion to inform
the diocese that he was a fluent German scholar and consequently
a persona grata with the royal aunts, and that the Princess
Christiana was merely just one of a number of royalties now
practically at the beck and call of Princhester. It was not true,
but it was very effective locally, and seemed to justify a little
the hauteur of which Lady Ella was so unjustly suspected. Yet it
involved a possibility of disappointments in the future.
<P>
He went to Brighton-Pomfrey too upon the score of his general
health, and Brighton-Pomfrey revised his general regimen,
discouraged indiscreet fasting, and suggested a complete
abstinence from red wine except white port, if indeed that can be
called a red wine, and a moderate use of Egyptian cigarettes.
<P>
But 1913 was a strenuous year. The labour troubles revived, the
suffragette movement increased greatly in violence and
aggressiveness, and there sprang up no less than three
ecclesiastical scandals in the diocese. First, the Kensitites set
themselves firmly to make presentations and prosecutions against
Morrice Deans, who was reserving the sacrament, wearing, they
said, "Babylonish garments," going beyond all reason in the
matter of infant confession, and generally brightening up Mogham
Banks; next, a popular preacher in Wombash, published a book
under the exasperating title, "The Light Under the Altar," in
which he showed himself as something between an Arian and a
Pantheist, and treated the dogma of the Trinity with as little
respect as one would show to an intrusive cat; while thirdly, an
obscure but overworked missioner of a tin mission church in the
new working-class district at Pringle, being discovered in some
sort of polygamous relationship, had seen fit to publish in
pamphlet form a scandalous admission and defence, a pamphlet
entitled "Marriage True and False," taking the public needlessly
into his completest confidence and quoting the affairs of Abraham
and Hosea, reviving many points that are better forgotten about
Luther, and appealing also to such uncanonical authorities as
Milton, Plato, and John Humphrey Noyes. This abnormal concurrence
of indiscipline was extremely unlucky for the bishop. It plunged
him into strenuous controversy upon three fronts, so to speak,
and involved a great number of personal encounters far too vivid
for his mental serenity.
<P>
The Pringle polygamist was the most moving as Morrice Deans was
the most exacting and troublesome and the Wombash Pantheist the
most insidiously destructive figure in these three toilsome
disputes. The Pringle man's soul had apparently missed the normal
distribution of fig-leaves; he was an illiterate, open-eyed,
hard-voiced, freckled, rational-minded creature, with large
expository hands, who had come by a side way into the church
because he was an indefatigable worker, and he insisted upon
telling the bishop with an irrepressible candour and completeness
just exactly what was the matter with his intimate life. The
bishop very earnestly did not want these details, and did his
utmost to avoid the controversial questions that the honest man
pressed respectfully but obstinately upon him.
<P>
"Even St. Paul, my lord, admitted that it is better to marry
than burn," said the Pringle misdemeanant, "and here was I, my
lord, married and still burning!" and, "I think you would find,
my lord, considering all Charlotte's peculiarities, that the
situation was really much more trying than the absolute celibacy
St. Paul had in view."...
<P>
The bishop listened to these arguments as little as possible,
and did not answer them at all. But afterwards the offender came
and wept and said he was ruined and heartbroken and unfairly
treated because he wasn't a gentleman, and that was distressing.
It was so exactly true--and so inevitable. He had been
deprived, rather on account of his voice and apologetics than of
his offence, and public opinion was solidly with the sentence. He
made a gallant effort to found what he called a Labour Church in
Pringle, and after some financial misunderstandings departed with
his unambiguous menage to join the advanced movement on the
Clyde.
<P>
The Morrice Deans enquiry however demanded an amount of
erudition that greatly fatigued the bishop. He had a very fair
general knowledge of vestments, but he had never really cared for
anything but the poetry of ornaments, and he had to work
strenuously to master the legal side of the question. Whippham,
his chaplain, was worse than useless as a helper. The bishop
wanted to end the matter as quickly, quietly, and favourably to
Morrice Deans as possible; he thought Morrice Deans a thoroughly
good man in his parish, and he believed that the substitution of
a low churchman would mean a very complete collapse of church
influence in Mogham Banks, where people were now thoroughly
accustomed to a highly ornate service. But Morrice Deans was
intractable and his pursuers indefatigable, and on several
occasions the bishop sat far into the night devising compromises
and equivocations that should make the Kensitites think that
Morrice Deans wasn't wearing vestments when he was, and that
should make Morrice Deans think he was wearing vestments when he
wasn't. And it was Whippham who first suggested green tea as a
substitute for coffee, which gave the bishop indigestion, as his
stimulant for these nocturnal bouts.
<P>
Now green tea is the most lucid of poisons.
<P>
And while all this extra activity about Morrice Deans, these
vigils and crammings and writings down, were using all and more
energy than the bishop could well spare, he was also doing his
quiet utmost to keep "The Light under the Altar" ease from coming
to a head.
<P>
This man he hated.
<P>
And he dreaded him as well as hated him. Chasters, the author
of "The Light under the Altar," was a man who not only reasoned
closely but indelicately. There was a demonstrating, jeering, air
about his preaching and writing, and everything he said and did
was saturated by the spirit of challenge. He did not so much
imitate as exaggerate the style of Matthew Arnold. And whatever
was done publicly against him would have to be done very publicly
because his book had got him a London reputation.
<P>
From the bishop's point of view Chasters was one of nature's
ignoblemen. He seemed to have subscribed to the Thirty-Nine
Articles and passed all the tests and taken all the pledges that
stand on the way to ordination, chiefly for the pleasure of
attacking them more successfully from the rear; he had been given
the living of Wombash by a cousin, and filled it very largely
because it was not only more piquant but more remunerative and
respectable to be a rationalist lecturer in a surplice. And in a
hard kind of ultra-Protestant way his social and parochial work
was not badly done. But his sermons were terrible. "He takes a
text," said one informant, "and he goes on firstly, secondly,
thirdly, fourthly, like somebody tearing the petals from a
flower. 'Finally,' he says, and throws the bare stalk into the
dustbin."
<P>
The bishop avoided "The Light under the Altar" for nearly a
year. It was only when a second book was announced with the
winning title of "The Core of Truth in Christianity" that he
perceived he must take action. He sat up late one night with a
marked copy, a very indignantly marked copy, of the former work
that an elderly colonel, a Wombash parishioner, an orthodox
Layman of the most virulent type, had sent him. He perceived that
he had to deal with a dialectician of exceptional ability, who
had concentrated a quite considerable weight of scholarship upon
the task of explaining away every scrap of spiritual significance
in the Eucharist. From Chasters the bishop was driven by
reference to the works of Legge and Frazer, and for the first
time he began to measure the dimensions and power of the modern
criticism of church doctrine and observance. Green tea should
have lit his way to refutation; instead it lit up the whole
inquiry with a light of melancholy confirmation. Neither by night
nor by day could the bishop find a proper method of opening a
counter attack upon Chasters, who was indisputably an
intellectually abler man and a very ruthless beast indeed to
assail, and meanwhile the demand that action should be taken
increased.
<P>
The literature of church history and the controversies arising
out of doctrinal development became the employment of the
bishop's leisure and a commanding preoccupation. He would have
liked to discuss with some one else the network of perplexities
in which he was entangling himself, and more particularly with
Canon Bliss, but his own positions were becoming so insecure that
he feared to betray them by argument. He had grown up with a kind
of intellectual modesty. Some things he had never yet talked
about; it made his mind blench to think of talking about them.
And his great aching gaps of wakefulness began now, thanks to the
green tea, to be interspersed with theological dreams and visions
of an extravagant vividness. He would see Frazer's sacrificial
kings butchered picturesquely and terribly amidst strange and
grotesque rituals; he would survey long and elaborate processions
and ceremonials in which the most remarkable symbols were borne
high in the sight of all men; he would cower before a gigantic
and threatening Heaven. These green-tea dreams and visions were
not so much phases of sleep as an intensification and vivid
furnishing forth of insomnia. It added greatly to his disturbance
that--exceeding the instructions of Brighton-Pomfrey--he had
now experimented ignorantly and planlessly with one or two
narcotics and sleeping mixtures that friends and acquaintances
had mentioned in his hearing. For the first time in his life he
became secretive from his wife. He knew he ought not to take
these things, he knew they were physically and morally evil, but
a tormenting craving drove him to them. Subtly and insensibly his
character was being undermined by the growing nervous trouble.
<P>
He astonished himself by the cunning and the hypocritical
dignity he could display in procuring these drugs. He arranged to
have a tea-making set in his bedroom, and secretly substituted
green tea, for which he developed a powerful craving, in the
place of the delicate China tea Lady Ella procured him.
<P>
(5)
<P>
<P>
These doctrinal and physical anxieties and distresses were at
their worst in the spring and early summer of 1914. That was a
time of great mental and moral disturbance. There was premonition
in the air of those days. It was like the uneasiness sensitive
people experience before a thunderstorm. The moral atmosphere was
sullen and close. The whole world seemed irritable and
mischievous. The suffragettes became extraordinarily malignant;
the democratic movement went rotten with sabotage and with a cant
of being "rebels"; the reactionary Tories and a crew of noisy old
peeresses set themselves to create incurable confusion again in
the healing wounds of Ireland, and feuds and frantic folly broke
out at every point of the social and political edifice. And then
a bomb burst at Sarajevo that silenced all this tumult. The
unstable polity of Europe heeled over like a ship that founders.
<P>
Through the swiftest, tensest week in history Europe capsized
into war.
<P>
(6)
<P>
<P>
The first effect of the war upon the mind of the bishop, as
upon most imaginative minds, was to steady and exalt it.
Trivialities and exasperations seemed swept out of existence. Men
lifted up their eyes from disputes that had seemed incurable and
wrangling that promised to be interminable, and discovered a
plain and tragic issue that involved every one in a common call
for devotion. For a great number of men and women who had been
born and bred in security, the August and September of 1914 were
the supremely heroic period of their lives. Myriads of souls were
born again to ideas of service and sacrifice in those tremendous
days.
<P>
Black and evil thing as the war was, it was at any rate a great
thing; it did this much for countless minds that for the first
time they realized the epic quality of history and their own
relationship to the destinies of the race. The flimsy roof under
which we had been living our lives of comedy fell and shattered
the floor under our feet; we saw the stars above and the abyss
below. We perceived that life was insecure and adventurous, part
of one vast adventure in space and time....
<P>
Presently the smoke and dust of battle hid the great distances
again, but they could not altogether destroy the memories of this
revelation.
<P>
For the first two months the bishop's attention was so detached
from his immediate surroundings and employments, so absorbed by
great events, that his history if it were told in detail would
differ scarcely at all from the histories of most comparatively
unemployed minds during those first dramatic days, the days when
the Germans made their great rush upon Paris and it seemed that
France was down, France and the whole fabric of liberal
civilization. He emerged from these stunning apprehensions after
the Battle of the Marne, to find himself busy upon a score of
dispersed and disconnected war jobs, and trying to get all the
new appearances and forces and urgencies of the war into
relations with himself. One thing became very vivid indeed, that
he wasn't being used in any real and effective way in the war.
There was a mighty going to and fro upon Red Cross work and
various war committees, a vast preparation for wounded men and
for the succour of dislocated families; a preparation, that
proved to be needless, for catastrophic unemployment. The war
problem and the puzzle of German psychology ousted for a time all
other intellectual interests; like every one else the bishop swam
deep in Nietzsche, Bernhardi, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and
the like; he preached several sermons upon German materialism and
the astonishing decay of the German character. He also read every
newspaper he could lay his hands on--like any secular man. He
signed an address to the Russian Orthodox church, beginning
"Brethren," and he revised his impressions of the Filioque
controversy. The idea of a reunion of the two great state
churches of Russia and England had always attracted him. But
hitherto it had been a thing quite out of scale, visionary,
utopian. Now in this strange time of altered perspectives it
seemed the most practicable of suggestions. The mayor and
corporation and a detachment of the special reserve in uniform
came to a great intercession service, and in the palace there
were two conferences of local influential people, people of the
most various types, people who had never met tolerantly before,
expressing now opinions of unprecedented breadth and liberality.
<P>
All this sort of thing was fresh and exciting at first, and
then it began to fall into a routine and became habitual, and as
it became habitual he found that old sense of detachment and
futility was creeping back again. One day he realized that indeed
the whole flood and tumult of the war would be going on almost
exactly as it was going on now if there had been neither
cathedral nor bishop in Princhester. It came to him that if
archbishops were rolled into patriarchs and patriarchs into
archbishops, it would matter scarcely more in the world process
that was afoot than if two men shook hands while their house was
afire. At times all of us have inappropriate thoughts. The
unfortunate thought that struck the bishop as a bullet might
strike a man in an exposed trench, as he was hurrying through the
cloisters to a special service and address upon that doubly
glorious day in our English history, the day of St. Crispin, was
of Diogenes rolling his tub.
<P>
It was a poisonous thought.
<P>
It arose perhaps out of an article in a weekly paper at which
he had glanced after lunch, an article written by one of those
sceptical spirits who find all too abundant expression in our
periodical literature. The writer boldly charged the "Christian
churches" with absolute ineffectiveness. This war, he declared,
was above all other wars a war of ideas, of material organization
against rational freedom, of violence against law; it was a war
more copiously discussed than any war had ever been before, the
air was thick with apologetics. And what was the voice of the
church amidst these elemental issues? Bishops and divines who
were patriots one heard discordantly enough, but where were the
bishops and divines who spoke for the Prince of Peace? Where was
the blessing of the church, where was the veto of the church?
When it came to that one discovered only a broad preoccupied back
busied in supplementing the Army Medical Corps with Red Cross
activities, good work in its way--except that the canonicals
seemed superfluous. Who indeed looked to the church for any voice
at all? And so to Diogenes.
<P>
The bishop's mind went hunting for an answer to that
indictment. And came back and came back to the image of Diogenes.
<P>
It was with that image dangling like a barbed arrow from his
mind that the bishop went into the pulpit to preach upon St.
Crispin's day, and looked down upon a thin and scattered
congregation in which the elderly, the childless, and the
unoccupied predominated.
<P>
That night insomnia resumed its sway.
<P>
Of course the church ought to be controlling this great storm,
the greatest storm of war that had ever stirred mankind. It ought
to be standing fearlessly between the combatants like a figure in
a wall painting, with the cross of Christ uplifted and the
restored memory of Christendom softening the eyes of the armed
nations. "Put down those weapons and listen to me," so the church
should speak in irresistible tones, in a voice of silver
trumpets.
<P>
Instead it kept a long way from the fighting, tucked up its
vestments, and was rolling its local tubs quite briskly.
<P>

<P>
<P>
And then came the aggravation of all these distresses by an
abrupt abandonment of smoking and alcohol. Alcoholic relaxation,
a necessary mitigation of the unreality of peacetime politics,
becomes a grave danger in war, and it was with an understandable
desire to forward the interests of his realm that the King
decided to set his statesmen an example--which unhappily was
not very widely followed--by abstaining from alcohol during the
continuance of the struggle. It did however swing over the Bishop
of Princhester to an immediate and complete abandonment of both
drink and tobacco. At that time he was finding comfort for his
nerves in Manila cheroots, and a particularly big and heavy type
of Egyptian cigarette with a considerable amount of opium, and
his disorganized system seized upon this sudden change as a
grievance, and set all his jangling being crying aloud for one
cigarette--just one cigarette.
<P>
The cheroots, it seemed, he could better spare, but a cigarette
became his symbol for his lost steadiness and ease.
<P>
It brought him low.
<P>
The reader has already been told the lamentable incident of the
stolen cigarette and the small boy, and how the bishop, tormented
by that shameful memory, cried aloud in the night.
<P>
The bishop rolled his tub, and is there any tub-rolling in the
world more busy and exacting than a bishop's? He rolled in it
spite of ill-health and insomnia, and all the while he was
tormented by the enormous background of the world war, by his
ineffective realization of vast national needs, by his passionate
desire, for himself and his church, not to be ineffective.
<P>
The distressful alternation between nights of lucid doubt and
days of dull acquiescence was resumed with an intensification of
its contrasts. The brief phase of hope that followed the turn of
the fighting upon the Maine, the hope that after all the war
would end swiftly, dramatically, and justly, and everything be as
it had been before--but pleasanter, gave place to a phase that
bordered upon despair. The fall of Antwerp and the doubts and
uncertainties of the Flanders situation weighed terribly upon the
bishop. He was haunted for a time by nightmares of Zeppelins
presently raining fire upon London. These visions became
Apocalyptic. The Zeppelins came to England with the new year, and
with the close of the year came the struggle for Ypres that was
so near to being a collapse of the allied defensive. The events
of the early spring, the bloody failure of British generalship at
Neuve Chapelle, the naval disaster in the Dardanelles, the
sinking of the Falaba, the Russian defeat in the Masurian Lakes,
all deepened the bishop's impression of the immensity of the
nation's difficulties and of his own unhelpfulness. He was
ashamed that the church should hold back its curates from
enlistment while the French priests were wearing their uniforms
in the trenches; the expedition of the Bishop of London to hold
open-air services at the front seemed merely to accentuate the
tub-rolling. It was rolling the tub just where it was most in the
way.
<P>
What was wrong? What was wanting?
<P>
The Westminster Gazette, The Spectator, and several other of
the most trusted organs of public opinion were intermittently
discussing the same question. Their discussions implied at once
the extreme need that was felt for religion by all sorts of
representative people, and the universal conviction that the
church was in some way muddling and masking her revelation. "What
is wrong with the Churches?" was, for example, the general
heading of The Westminster Gazette's correspondence.
<P>
One day the bishop skimmed a brief incisive utterance by Sir
Harry Johnston that pierced to the marrow of his own shrinking
convictions. Sir Harry is one of those people who seem to write
as well as speak in a quick tenor. "Instead of propounding
plainly and without the acereted mythology of Asia Minor, Greece
and Rome, the pure Gospel of Christ.... they present it
overloaded with unbelievable myths (such as, among a thousand
others, that Massacre of the Innocents which never took
place).... bore their listeners by a Tibetan repetition of creeds
that have ceased to be credible.... Mutually contradictory
propositions.... Prayers and litanies composed in Byzantine and
mediaeval times.... the want of actuality, the curious silliness
which has, ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, hung about
the exposition of Christianity.... But if the Bishops continue
to fuss about the trappings of religion.... the maintenance of
codes compiled by people who lived sixteen hundred or two
thousand five hundred years ago.... the increasingly educated and
practical-minded working classes will not come to church, weekday
or Sunday."
<P>
The bishop held the paper in his hand, and with a mind that he
felt to be terribly open, asked himself how true that sharp
indictment might be, and, granting its general truth, what was
the duty of the church, that is to say of the bishops, for as
Cyprian says, ecelesia est in episcopo. We say the creeds; how
far may we unsay them?
<P>
So far be had taken no open action against Chasters. Suppose
now be were to side with Chasters and let the whole diocese, the
church of Princhester, drift as far as it chose under his
inaction towards an extreme modernism, risking a conflict with,
and if necessary fighting, the archbishop.... It was but for a
moment that his mind swung to this possibility and then recoiled.
The Laymen, that band of bigots, would fight. He could not
contemplate litigation and wrangling about the teaching of the
church. Besides, what were the "trappings of religion" and what
the essentials? What after all was "the pure gospel of Christ" of
which this writer wrote so glibly? He put the paper down and took
a New Testament from his desk and opened it haphazard. He felt a
curious wish that he could read it for the first time. It was
over-familiar. Everything latterly in his theology and beliefs
had become over-familiar. It had all become mechanical and dead
and unmeaning to his tired mind....
<P>
Whippham came with a reminder of more tub-rolling, and the
bishop's speculations were broken off.
