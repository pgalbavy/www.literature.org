<p>Kate went back to her house in Sayula, and Cipriano went back to
his command in the city.</p>

<p>'Will you not come with me?' he said.  'Shall we not make a civil
marriage, and live in the same house together?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said.  'I am married to you by Quetzalcoatl, no other.  I
will be your wife in the world of Quetzalcoatl, no other.  And if
the star has risen between us, we will watch it.'</p>

<p>Conflicting feelings played in his dark eyes.  He could not bear
even to be the least bit thwarted.  Then the strong, rather distant
look came back.</p>

<p>'It is very good,' he said.  'It is the best.'</p>

<p>And he went away without looking back.</p>

<p>Kate returned to her house, to her servants and her rocking-chair.
Inside herself she kept very still and almost thoughtless, taking
no count of time.  What was going to unfold must unfold of itself.</p>

<p>She no longer feared the nights, when she was shut alone in her
darkness.  But she feared the days a little.  She shrank so
mortally from contact.</p>

<p>She opened her bedroom window one morning, and looked down to the
lake.  The sun had come, and queer blotty shadows were on the hills
beyond the water.  Way down at the water's edge a woman was pouring
water from a calabash bowl over a statuesque pig, dipping rapidly
and assiduously.  The little group was seen in silhouette against
the pale, dun lake.</p>

<p>But impossible to stand at her open window looking on the little
lane.  An old man suddenly appeared from nowhere, offering her a
leaf full of tiny fish, charales, like splinters of glass, for ten
centavos, and a girl was unfolding three eggs from the ragged
corner of her rebozo, thrusting them imploringly forward to Kate.
An old woman was shambling up with a sad story, Kate knew.  She
fled from her window and the importunity.</p>

<p>At the same instant the sound that always made her heart stand
still woke on the invisible air.  It was the sound of drums, of
tom-toms rapidly beaten.  The same sound she had heard in the
distance, in the tropical dusk of Ceylon, from the temple at
sunset.  The sound she had heard from the edge of the forests in
the north, when the Red Indians were dancing by the fire.  The
sound that wakes dark, ancient echoes in the heart of every man,
the thud of the primeval world.</p>

<p>Two drums were violently throbbing against one another.  Then
gradually they were slowing down, in a peculiar uneven rhythm, till
at last there was only left one slow, continual, monotonous note,
like a great drop of darkness falling heavily, continually,
dripping in the bright morning.</p>

<p>The re-evoked past is frightening, and if it be re-evoked to
overwhelm the present, it is fiendish.  Kate felt a real terror of
the sound of a tom-tom.  It seemed to beat straight on her solar
plexus, to make her sick.</p>

<p>She went to her window.  Across the lane rose a tall garden-wall of
adobe brick, and above that, the sun on the tops of the orange-
trees, deep gold.  Beyond the orange garden rose three tall,
handsome, shaggy palm-trees, side by side on slim stems.  And from
the very top of the two outer palms rose the twin tips of the
church towers.  She had noticed it so often; the two ironwork Greek
crosses seeming to stand on the mops of the palms.</p>

<p>Now in an instant she saw the glitter of the symbol of Quetzalcoatl
in the places where the cross had been; two circular suns, with the
dark bird at the centre.  The gold of the suns - or the serpents - 
flashed new in the light of the sun, the bird lifted its wings dark
in outline within the circle.</p>

<p>Then again the two drums were speeding up, beating against one
another with the peculiar uneven savage rhythm, which at first
seems no rhythm, and then seems to contain a summons almost
sinister in its power, acting on the helpless blood direct.  Kate
felt her hands flutter on her wrists, in fear.  Almost, too, she
could hear the heart of Cipriano beating; her husband in
Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>'Listen, Ni&ntilde;a!  Listen, Ni&ntilde;a!' came Juana's frightened voice from
the veranda.</p>

<p>Kate went to the veranda.  Ezequiel had rolled up his mattress and
was hitching up his pants.  It was Sunday morning, when he
sometimes lay on after sunrise.  His thick black hair stood up, his
dark face was blank with sleep, but in his quiet aloofness and his
slightly bowed head Kate could see the secret satisfaction he took
in the barbarous sound of the drums.</p>

<p>'It comes from the Church!' said Juana.</p>

<p>Kate caught the other woman's black, reptilian eyes unexpectedly.
Usually, she forgot that Juana was dark, and different.  For days
she would not realize it.  Till suddenly she met that black, void
look with the glint in it, and she started inwardly, involuntarily
asking herself:  'Does she hate me?'</p>

<p>Or was it only the unspeakable difference in blood?</p>

<p>Now, in the dark glitter which Juana showed her for one moment,
Kate read fear, and triumph, and a slow, savage nonchalant
defiance.  Something very inhuman.</p>

<p>'What does it mean?' Kate said to her.</p>

<p>'It means, Ni&ntilde;a, that they won't ring the bells any more.  They
have taken the bells away, and they beat the drums in the church.
Listen!  Listen!'</p>

<p>The drums were shuddering rapidly again.</p>

<p>Kate and Juana went across to the open window.</p>

<p>'Look!  Ni&ntilde;a!  The Eye of the Other One!  No more crosses on the
church.  It is the Eye of the Other One.  Look!  How it shines!
How nice!'</p>

<p>'It means,' said Ezequiel's breaking young voice, which was just
turning deep, 'that it is the church of Quetzalcoatl.  Now it is
the temple of Quetzalcoatl; our own God.'</p>

<p>He was evidently a staunch Man of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>'Think of it!' murmured Juana, in an awed voice.  She seemed like a
heap of darkness low at Kate's side.</p>

<p>Then again she glanced up, and the eyes of the two women met for a
moment.</p>

<p>'See the Ni&ntilde;a's eyes of the sun!' cried Juana, laying her hand on
Kate's arm.  Kate's eyes were a sort of hazel, changing, grey-gold,
flickering at the moment with wonder, and a touch of fear and
dismay.  Juana sounded triumphant.</p>

<p>A man in a white serape, with the blue and black borders, suddenly
appeared at the window, lifting his hat, on which was the sign of
Quetzalcoatl, and pushing a little card through the window.</p>

<p>The card said:  Come to the church when you hear the one big drum;
about seven o'clock. - It was signed with the sign of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>'Very well!' said Kate.  'I will come.'</p>

<p>It was a quarter to seven already.  Outside the room was the noise
of Juana sweeping the veranda.  Kate put on a white dress and a
yellow hat, and a long string of pale-coloured topaz that glimmered
with yellow and mauve.</p>

<p>The earth was all damp with rain, the leaves were all fresh and
tropical thick, yet many old leaves were on the ground, beaten
down.</p>

<p>'Ni&ntilde;a!  You are going out already!  Wait!  Wait!  The coffee.
Concha! quick!'</p>

<p>There was a running of bare feet, the children bringing cup and
plate and sweet buns and sugar, the mother hastily limping with the
coffee.  Ezequiel came striding along the walk, lifting his hat.
He went down to the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>'Ezequiel says - !' Juana came crying.  When suddenly a soft, slack
thud seemed to make a hole in the air, leaving a gap behind it.
Thud! - Thud! - Thud! - rather slowly.  It was the big drum,
irresistible.</p>

<p>Kate rose at once from her coffee.</p>

<p>'I am going to the church,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, Ni&ntilde;a - Ezequiel says - I am coming, Ni&ntilde;a - '</p>

<p>And Juana scuttled away, to get her black rebozo.</p>

<p>The man in the white serape with the blue and black ends was
waiting by the gate.  He lifted his hat, and walked behind Kate and
Juana.</p>

<p>'He is following us!' whispered Juana.</p>

<p>Kate drew her yellow shawl around her shoulders.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, sailing-boats lined the water's edge, with
their black hulls.  But the beach was empty.  As the great drum let
fall its slow, bellowing note, the last people were running towards
the church.</p>

<p>In front of the church was a great throng of natives, the men with
their dark serapes, or their red blankets over their shoulders; the
nights of rain were cold; and their hats in their hands.  The high,
dark Indian heads! - Women in blue rebozos were pressing along.  The
big drum slowly, slackly exploded its note from the church-tower.
Kate had her heart in her mouth.</p>

<p>In the middle of the crowd, a double row of men in the scarlet
serapes of Huitzilopochtli with the black diamond on the shoulders,
stood with rifles, holding open a lane through the crowd.</p>

<p>'Pass!' said her guard to her.  And Kate entered the lane of
scarlet and black serapes, going slow and dazed between watchful
black eyes of the men.  Her guard followed her.  But Juana had been
turned back.</p>

<p>Kate looked at her feet, and stumbled.  Then she looked up.</p>

<p>In the gateway of the yard before the church stood a brilliant
figure in a serape whose zig-zag whorls of scarlet, white, and
black ran curving, dazzling, to the black shoulders; above which
was the face of Cipriano, calm, superb, with the little black beard
and the arching brows.  He lifted his hand to her in salute.</p>

<p>Behind him, stretching from the gateway to the closed door of the
church, was a double row of the guard of Quetzalcoatl, in their
blankets with the blue and black borders.</p>

<p>'What shall I do?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Stand here with me a moment,' said Cipriano, in the gateway.</p>

<p>It was no easy thing to do, to face all those dark faces and black,
glittering eyes.  After all, she was a gringuita, and she felt it.
A sacrifice?  Was she a sacrifice?  She hung her head, under her
yellow hat, and watched the string of topaz twinkling and shaking
its delicate, bog-watery colours against her white dress.  Joachim
had given it her.  He had had it made up for her, the string, in
Cornwall.  So far away!  In another world, in another life, in
another era!  Now she was condemned to go through these strange
ordeals, like a victim.</p>

<p>The big drum overhead ceased, and suddenly the little drums broke
like a shower of hail on the air, and as suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>In low, deep, inward voices, the guard of Quetzalcoatl began to
speak, in heavy unison:</p>

<p>'Oy&eacute;!  Oy&eacute;!  Oy&eacute;!  Oy&eacute;!'</p>

<p>The small, inset door within the heavy doors of the church opened
and Don Ram&oacute;n stepped through.  In his white clothes, wearing the
Quetzalcoatl serape, he stood at the head of his two rows of
guards, until there was a silence.  Then he raised his naked right
arm.</p>

<p>'What is God, we shall never know!' he said, in a strong voice, to
all the people.</p>

<p>The Guard of Quetzalcoatl turned to the people, thrusting up their
right arm.</p>

<p>'What is God, you shall never know!' they repeated.</p>

<p>Then again, in the crowd, the words were re-echoed by the Guard of
Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p>After which there fell a dead silence, in which Kate was aware of a
forest of black eyes glistening with white fire.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'But the Sons of God come and go.<br />
 They come from beyond the Morning Star;<br />
 And thither they return, from the land of men.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>It was again the solemn, powerful voice of Ram&oacute;n.  Kate looked at
his face; it was creamy-brown in its pallor, but changeless in
expression, and seemed to be sending a change over the crowd,
removing them from their vulgar complacency.</p>

<p>The Guard of Quetzalcoatl turned again to the crowd, and repeated
Ram&oacute;n's words to the crowd.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Mary and Jesus have left you, and gone to the place of renewal.<br />
 And Quetzalcoatl has come.  He is here.<br />
 He is your lord.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>With his words, Ram&oacute;n was able to put the power of his heavy,
strong will over the people.  The crowd began to fuse under his
influence.  As he gazed back at all the black eyes, his eyes seemed
to have no expression, save that they seemed to be seeing the heart
of all darkness in front of him, where his unknowable God-mystery
lived and moved.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Those that follow me, must cross the mountains of the sky,<br />
 And pass the houses of the stars by night.<br />
 They shall find me only in the Morning Star.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>But those that will not follow, must not peep.<br />
Peeping, they will lose their sight, and lingering, they<br />
   will fall very lame.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>He stood a moment in silence, gazing with dark brows at the crowd.
Then he dropped his arm, and turned.  The big doors of the church
opened, revealing a dim interior.  Ram&oacute;n entered the church alone.
Inside the church, the drum began to beat.  The guard of
Quetzalcoatl slowly filed into the dim interior, the scarlet guard
of Huitzilopochtli filed into the yard of the church, taking the
place of the guard of Quetzalcoatl.  Cipriano remained in the
gateway of the churchyard.  His voice rang out clear and military.</p>

<p>'Hear me, people.  You may enter the house of Quetzalcoatl.  Men
must go to the right and left, and remove their shoes, and stand
erect.  To the new God no man shall kneel.</p>

<p>'Women must go down the centre, and cover their faces.  And they
may sit upon the floor.</p>

<p>'But men must stand erect.</p>

<p>'Pass now, those who dare.'</p>

<p>Kate went with Cipriano into the church.</p>

<p>It was all different, the floor was black and polished, the walls
were in stripes of colour, the place seemed dark.  Two files of the
white-clad men of Quetzalcoatl stood in a long avenue down the
centre of the church.</p>

<p>'This way,' said one of the men of Quetzalcoatl, in a low voice,
drawing her into the centre between the motionless files of men.</p>

<p>She went alone and afraid over the polished black floor, covering
her face with her yellow shawl.  The pillars of the nave were dark
green, like trees rising to a deep, blue roof.  The walls were
vertically striped in bars of black and white, vermilion and yellow
and green, with the windows between rich with deep blue and crimson
and black glass, having specks of light.  A strange maze, the
windows.</p>

<p>The daylight came only from small windows, high up under the deep
blue roof, where the stripes of the walls had run into a maze of
green, like banana leaves.  Below, the church was all dark, and
rich with hard colour.</p>

<p>Kate went forward to the front, near the altar steps.  High at the
back of the chancel, above where the altar had been, burned a small
but intense bluey-white light, and just below and in front of the
light stood a huge dark figure, a strange looming block, apparently
carved in wood.  It was a naked man, carved archaic and rather
flat, holding his right arm over his head, and on the right arm
balanced a carved wooden eagle with outspread wings whose upper
surface gleamed with gold, near the light, whose under surface was
black shadow.  Round the heavy left leg of the man-image was carved
a serpent, also glimmering gold, and its golden head rested in the
hand of the figure, near the thigh.  The face of the figure was
dark.</p>

<p>This great dark statue loomed stiff like a pillar, rather
frightening in the white-lit blue chancel.</p>

<p>At the foot of the statue was a stone altar with a small fire of
ocote-wood burning.  And on a low throne by the altar sat Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>People were beginning to file into the church.  Kate heard the
strange sound of the naked feet of the men on the black, polished
floor, the white figures stole forward towards the altar steps, the
dark faces gazing round in wonder, men crossing themselves
involuntarily.  Throngs of men slowly flooded in, and woman came
half running, to crouch on the floor and cover their faces.  Kate
crouched down too.</p>

<p>A file of the men of Quetzalcoatl came and stood along the foot of
the altar steps, like a fence with a gap in the middle, facing the
people.  Beyond the gap was the flickering altar, and Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n rose to his feet.  The men of Quetzalcoatl turned to face
him, and shot up their naked right arms, in the gesture of the
statue, Ram&oacute;n lifted his arm, so that his blanket fell in towards
his shoulder, revealing the naked side and the blue sash.</p>

<p>'All men salute Quetzalcoatl!' said a clear voice in command.</p>

<p>The scarlet men of Huitzilopochtli were threading among the men of
the congregation, pulling the kneeling ones to their feet, causing
all to thrust up their right arm, palm flat to heaven, face
uplifted, body erect and tense.  It was the statue receiving the
eagle.</p>

<p>So that around the low dark shrubs of the crouching women stood a
forest of erect, upthrusting men, powerful and tense with
inexplicable passion.  It was a forest of dark wrists and hands up-
pressing, with the striped wall vibrating above, and higher, the
maze of green going to the little, iron-barred windows that stood
open, letting in the light and air of the roof.</p>

<p>'I am the living Quetzalcoatl,' came the solemn, impassive voice of
Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'I am the Son of the Morning Star, and child of the deeps.
No man knows my Father, and I know Him not.
My Father is deep within the deeps, whence He sent me forth.
He sends the eagle of silence down on wide wings
To lean over my head and my neck and my breast
And fill them strong with strength of wings.
He sends the serpent of power up my feet and my loins
So that strength wells up in me like water in hot springs.
But midmost shines as the Morning Star midmost shines
Between night and day, my Soul-star in one,
Which is my Father whom I know not.
I tell you, the day should not turn into glory,
And the night should not turn deep,
Save for the morning and evening stars, upon which they turn.
Night turns upon me, and Day, who am the star between.
Between your breast and belly is a star.
If it be not there
You are empty gourd-shells filled with dust and wind.
When you walk, the star walks with you, between your breast and
   your belly.
When you sleep, it softly shines.
When you speak true and true, it is bright on your lips and your
   teeth.
When you lift your hands in courage and bravery, its glow is clear
   in your palms.
When you turn to your wives as brave men turn to their women
The Morning Star and the Evening Star shine together.
For man is the Morning Star.
And woman is the Star of Evening.
I tell you, you are not men alone.
The star of the beyond is within you.
But have you seen a dead man, how his star has gone out of him?
So the star will go out of you, even as a woman will leave a man if
   his warmth never warms her.
Should you say:  I have no star; I am no star.
So it will leave you, and you will hang like a gourd on the vine of
   life
With nothing but rind:
Waiting for the rats of the dark to come and gnaw your inside.
Do you hear the rats of the darkness gnawing at your inside?
Till you are as empty as rat-gnawed pomegranates hanging hollow on
   the Tree of Life?
If the star shone, they dare not, they could not.
If you were men with the Morning Star.
If the star shone within you
No rat of the dark dared gnaw you.
But I am Quetzalcoatl, of the Morning Star.
I am the living Quetzalcoatl.
And you are men who should be men of the Morning Star.
See you be not rat-gnawed gourds.
I am Quetzalcoatl of the eagle and the snake.
The earth and air.
Of the Morning Star.
I am Lord of the Two Ways - '</p>

<p>The drum began to beat, the men of Quetzalcoatl suddenly took off
their serapes, and Ram&oacute;n did the same.  They were now men naked to
the waist.  The eight men from the altar-steps filed up to the
altar where the fire burned, and one by one kindled tall green
candles, which burned with a clear light.  They ranged themselves
on either side the chancel, holding the lights high, so that the
wooden face of the image glowed as if alive, and the eyes of silver
and jet flashed most curiously.</p>

<p>'A man shall take the wine of his spirit and the blood of his
heart, the oil of his belly and the seed of his loins, and offer
them first to the Morning Star,' said Ram&oacute;n, in a loud voice,
turning to the people.</p>

<p>Four men came to him.  One put a blue crown with the bird on his
brow, one put a red belt round his breast, another put a yellow
belt around his middle, and the last fastened a white belt round
his loins.  Then the first one pressed a small glass bowl to
Ram&oacute;n's brow, and in the bowl was white liquid like bright water.
The next touched a bowl to the breast, and the red shook in the
bowl.  At the navel the man touched a bowl with yellow fluid, and
at the loins a bowl with something dark.  They held them all to the
light.</p>

<p>Then one by one they poured them into a silver mixing-bowl that
Ram&oacute;n held between his hands.</p>

<p>'For save the Unknown God pours His Spirit over my head and fire
into my heart, and sends his power like a fountain of oil into my
belly, and His lightning like a hot spring into my loins, I am not.
I am nothing.  I am a dead gourd.</p>

<p>'And save I take the wine of my spirit and the red of my heart, the
strength of my belly and the power of my loins, and mingle them all
together, and kindle them to the Morning Star, I betray my body, I
betray my soul, I betray my spirit and my God who is Unknown.</p>

<p>'Fourfold is man.  But the star is one star.  And one man is but
one star.'</p>

<p>He took the silver mixing-bowl and slowly circled it between his
hands, in the act of mixing.</p>

<p>Then he turned his back to the people, and lifted the bowl high up,
between his hands, as if offering it to the image.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he threw the contents of the bowl into the altar
fire.</p>

<p>There was a soft puff of explosion, a blue flame leaped high into
the air, followed by a yellow flame, and then a rose-red smoke.  In
three successive instants the faces of the men inside the chancel
were lit bluish, then gold, then dusky red.  And in the same moment
Ram&oacute;n had turned to the people and shot up his hand.</p>

<p>'Salute Quetzalcoatl!' cried a voice, and men began to thrust up
their arms, when another voice came moaning strangely.</p>

<p>'No!  Ah no!  Ah no!' - the voice rose in a hysterical cry.</p>

<p>It came from among the crouching women, who glanced round in fear,
to see a woman in black, kneeling on the floor, her black scarf
falling back from her lifted face, thrusting up her white hands to
the Madonna, in the old gesture.</p>

<p>'No!  No!  It is not permitted!' shrieked the voice.  'Lord!  Lord!
Lord Jesus!  Holy Virgin!  Prevent him!  Prevent him!'</p>

<p>The voice sank again to a moan, the white hands clutched the
breast, and the woman in black began to work her way forward on her
knees, through the throng of women who pressed aside to make her
way, towards the altar steps.  She came with her head lowered,
working her way on her knees, and moaning low prayers of
supplication.</p>

<p>Kate felt her blood run cold.  Crouching near the altar steps, she
looked round.  And she knew, by the shape of the head bent in the
black scarf, it was Carlota, creeping along on her knees to the
altar steps.</p>

<p>The whole church was frozen in horror.  'Saviour!  Saviour!  Jesus!
Oh Holy Virgin!' Carlota was moaning to herself as she crawled
along.</p>

<p>It seemed hours before she reached the altar steps.  Ram&oacute;n still
stood below the great Quetzalcoatl image with arm up-flung.</p>

<p>Carlota crouched black at the altar steps and flung up the white
hands and her white face in the frenzy of the old way.</p>

<p>'Lord!  Lord!' she cried, in a strange ecstatic voice that froze
Kate's bowels with horror:  'Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Jesus!
Jesus!'</p>

<p>Carlota strangled in her ecstasy.  And all the while, Ram&oacute;n, the
living Quetzalcoatl, stood before the flickering altar with naked
arm upraised, looking with dark, inalterable eyes down upon the
woman.</p>

<p>Throes and convulsions tortured the body of Carlota.  She gazed
sightlessly upwards.  Then came her voice, in the mysterious
rhapsody of prayer:</p>

<p>'Lord!  Lord!  Forgive!</p>

<p>'God of love, forgive!  He knows not what he does.</p>

<p>'Lord!  Lord Jesus!  Make an end.  Make an end, Lord of the world,
Christ of the cross, make an end.  Have mercy on him, Father.  Have
pity on him!</p>

<p>'Oh, take his life from him now, now, that his soul may not die.'</p>

<p>Her voice had gathered strength till it rang out metallic and
terrible.</p>

<p>'Almighty God, take his life from him, and save his soul.'</p>

<p>And in the silence after that cry her hands seemed to flicker in
the air like flames of death.</p>

<p>'The Omnipotent,' came the voice of Ram&oacute;n, speaking quietly, as if
to her, 'is with me, and I serve Omnipotence!'</p>

<p>She remained with her white clasped hands upraised, her white arms
and her white face showing mystical, like onyx, from her thin black
dress.  She was absolutely rigid.  And Ram&oacute;n, with his arm too
upraised, looked down on her abstractedly, his black brows a little
contracted.</p>

<p>A strong convulsion seized her body.  She became tense again,
making inarticulate noises.  Then another convulsion seized her.
Once more she recovered herself, and thrust up her clenched hands
in frenzy.  A third convulsion seized her as if from below, and she
fell with a strangling moan in a heap on the altar steps.</p>

<p>Kate had risen suddenly and ran to her, to lift her up.  She found
her stiff, with a little froth on her discoloured lips, and fixed,
glazed eyes.</p>

<p>Kate looked up in consternation at Ram&oacute;n.  He had dropped his arm,
and stood with his hands against his thighs, like a statue.  But he
remained with his wide, absorbed dark eyes watching without any
change.  He met Kate's glance of dismay, and his eyes quickly
glanced, like lightning, for Cipriano.  Then he looked back at
Carlota, across a changeless distance.  Not a muscle of his face
moved.  And Kate could see that his heart had died in its
connection with Carlota, his heart was quite, quite dead in him;
out of the deathly vacancy he watched his wife.  Only his brows
frowned a little, from his smooth, male forehead.  His old
connections were broken.  She could hear him say:  There is no star
between me and Carlota. - And how terribly true it was!</p>

<p>Cipriano came quickly, switched off his brilliant serape, wrapped
it round the poor, stiff figure, and picking up the burden lightly,
walked with it through the lane of women to the door, and out into
the brilliant sun; Kate following.  And as she followed, she heard
the slow, deep voice of Ram&oacute;n:</p>

<p>'I am the Living Quetzalcoatl.
Naked I come from out of the deep
From the place which I call my Father,
Naked have I travelled the long way round
From heaven, past the sleeping sons of God.</p>

<p>Out of the depths of the sky, I came like an eagle.
Out of the bowels of the earth like a snake.</p>

<p>All things that lift in the lift of living between earth and sky,
   know me.</p>

<p>But I am the inward star invisible.
And the star is the lamp in the hand of the Unknown Mover.
Beyond me is a Lord who is terrible, and wonderful, and dark to me
   forever.
Yet I have lain in his loins, ere he begot me in Mother space.</p>

<p>Now I am alone on earth, and this is mine.
The roots are mine, down the dark, moist path of the snake.
And the branches are mine, in the paths of the sky and the bird,
But the spark of me that is me is more than mine own.</p>

<p>And the feet of men, and the hands of the women know me.
And knees and thighs and loins, and the bowels of strength and seed
   are lit with me.
The snake of my left-hand out of the darkness is kissing your feet
   with his mouth of caressive fire,
And putting his strength in your heels and ankles, his flame in
   your knees and your legs and your loins, his circle of rest in
   your belly.
For I am Quetzalcoatl, the feathered snake,
And I am not with you till my serpent has coiled his circle of rest
   in your belly.</p>

<p>And I, Quetzalcoatl, the eagle of the air, am brushing your faces
   with vision.
I am fanning your breasts with my breath.
And building my nest of peace in your bones.
I am Quetzalcoatl, of the Two Ways.'</p>

<p>Kate lingered to hear the end of this hymn.  Cipriano also had
lingered in the porch, with the strange figure in the brilliant
serape in his arms.  His eyes met Kate's.  In his black glance was
a sort of homage, to the mystery of the Two Ways; a sort of secret.
And Kate was uneasy.</p>

<p>They crossed quickly under the trees to the hotel, which was very
near, and Carlota was laid in bed.  A soldier had gone already to
find a doctor; they sent also for a priest.</p>

<p>Kate sat by the bed.  Carlota lay on the bed, making small,
horrible moaning noises.  The drums outside on the church-roof
started to roll, in a savage, complicated rhythm.  Kate went to the
window and looked out.  People were streaming dazzled from the
church.</p>

<p>And then, from the church roof, came the powerful singing of men's
voices, fanning like a dark eagle in the bright air; a deep,
relentless chanting, with an undertone of passionate assurance.
She went to the window to look.  She could see the men on the
church roof, the people swarming down below.  And the roll of that
relentless chanting, with its undertone of exultance in power and
life, rolled through the air like an invisible dark presence.</p>

<p>Cipriano came in again, glancing at Carlota and at Kate.</p>

<p>'They are singing the song of Welcome to Quetzalcoatl,' said he.</p>

<p>'Is that it?' said Kate.  'What are the words?'</p>

<p>'I will find you a song-sheet,' he said.</p>

<p>He stood beside her, putting the spell of his presence over her.
And she still struggled a little, as if she were drowning.  When
she wasn't drowning, she wanted to drown.  But when it actually
came, she fought for her old footing.</p>

<p>There was a crying noise from Carlota.  Kate hurried to the bed.</p>

<p>'Where am I?' said the white-faced, awful, deathly-looking woman.</p>

<p>'You are resting in bed,' said Kate.  'Don't trouble.'</p>

<p>'Where was I?' came Carlota's voice.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the sun gave you a touch of sunstroke,' said Kate.</p>

<p>Carlota closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Then suddenly outside the noise of drums rolled again, a powerful
sound.  And outside in the sunshine life seemed to be rolling in
powerful waves.</p>

<p>Carlota started, and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>'What is that noise?'</p>

<p>'It is a fiesta,' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Ram&oacute;n, he's murdered me, and lost his own soul,' said Carlota.
'He has murdered me, and lost his own soul.  He is a murderer, and
one of the damned.  The man I married!  The man I married!  A
murderer among the damned!'</p>

<p>It was evident she no longer heard the sounds outside.</p>

<p>Cipriano could not bear the sound of her voice.  He came quickly to
the side of the bed.</p>

<p>'Do&ntilde;a Carlota!' he said, looking down at her dulled hazel eyes,
that were fixed and unseeing:  'Do not die with wrong words on your
lips.  If you are murdered, you have murdered yourself.  You were
never married to Ram&oacute;n.  You were married to your own way.'</p>

<p>He spoke fiercely, avengingly.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the dying woman.  'Ah!  I never married Ram&oacute;n.  No!  I
never married him!  How could I?  He was not what I would have him
be.  How could I marry him?  Ah!  I thought I married him.  Ah!  I
am so glad I didn't - so glad.'</p>

<p>'You are glad!  You are glad!' said Cipriano in anger, angry with
the very ghost of the woman, talking to the ghost.  'You are glad
because you never poured the wine of your body into the mixing-
bowl!  Yet in your day you have drunk the wine of his body and been
soothed with his oil.  You are glad you kept yours back?  You are
glad you kept back the wine of your body and the secret oil of your
soul?  That you gave only the water of your charity?  I tell you
the water of charity, the hissing water of the spirit, is bitter at
last in the mouth and in the breast and in the belly; it puts out
the fire.  You would have put out the fire, Do&ntilde;a Carlota. - But you
cannot.  You shall not.  You have been charitable and compassionless
to the man you called your own.  So you have put out your own fire.'</p>

<p>'Who is talking?' said the ghost of Carlota.</p>

<p>'I, Cipriano Viedma, am talking.'</p>

<p>'The oil and the wine!  The oil and the wine and the bread!  They
are the sacrament!  They are the body and the blessing of God!
Where is the priest?  I want the sacrament.  Where is the priest?
I want to confess, and take the sacrament, and have the peace of
God,' said the ghost of Carlota.</p>

<p>'The priest is coming. - But you can take no sacrament, unless you
give it.  The oil and the wine and the bread!  They are not for the
priest to give.  They are to be poured into the mixing-bowl, which
Ram&oacute;n calls the cup of the star.  If you pour neither oil nor wine
into the mixing-bowl, from the mixing-bowl you cannot drink.  So
you have no sacrament.'</p>

<p>'The sacrament!  The bread!' said the ghost of Carlota.</p>

<p>'There is no bread.  There is no body without blood and oil, as
Shylock found out.'</p>

<p>'A murderer, lost among the damned!' murmured Carlota.  'The father
of my children!  The husband of my body!  Ah no!  It is better for
me to call to the Holy Virgin, and die.'</p>

<p>'Call then, and die!' said Cipriano.</p>

<p>'My children!' murmured Carlota.</p>

<p>'It is well you must leave them.  With your beggar's bowl of
charity you have stolen their oil and their wine as well.  It is
good for you to steal from them no more, you stale virgin, you
spinster, you born widow, you weeping mother, you impeccable wife,
you just woman.  You stole the very sunshine out of the sky and the
sap out of the earth.  Because back again, what did you pour?  Only
the water of dead dilution into the mixing-bowl of life, you thief.
Oh die! - die! - die!  Die and be a thousand times dead!  Do nothing
but utterly die!'</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Carlota had relapsed into unconsciousness; even her ghost
refused to hear.  Cipriano flung his sinisterly-flaming serape over
his shoulders and his face, over his nose, till only his black,
glittering eyes were visible as he blew out of the room.</p>

<p>Kate sat by the window, and laughed a little.  The primeval woman
inside her laughed to herself, for she had known all the time about
the two thieves on the Cross with Jesus; the bullying, marauding
thief of the male in his own rights, and the much more subtle,
cold, sly, charitable thief of the woman in HER own rights, forever
chanting her beggar's whine about the love of God and the God of
pity.</p>

<p>But Kate, too, was a modern woman and a woman in her own right.  So
she sat on with Carlota.  And when the doctor came, she accepted
the obsequiousness of the man as part of her rights.  And when the
priest came, she accepted the obsequiousness from him, just the
same, as part of her woman's rights.  These two ministers of love,
what were they for, but to be obsequious to her?  As for herself,
she could hardly be called a thief, and a sneak-thief of the
world's virility, when these men came forcing their obsequiousness
upon her, whining to her to take it and relieve them of the
responsibility of their own manhood.  No, if women are thieves, it
is only because men want to be thieved from.  If women thieve the
world's virility it is only because men want to have it thieved,
since for men to be responsible for their own manhood seems to be
the last thing men want.</p>

<p>So Kate sat on in the room of the dying Carlota, smiling a little
cynically.  Outside she heard the roll of the tom-toms and the deep
chanting of the men of Quetzalcoatl.  Beyond, under the trees, in
the smoothed, cleared space before the church, she saw the half-
naked men dancing in a circle, to the drum; the round dance.  Then
later, dancing a religious dance of the return of Quetzalcoatl.  It
was the old, barefooted, absorbed dancing of the Indians, the dance
of downward-sinking absorption.  It was the dance of these people,
too, just the same: the dance of the Aztecs and Zapotees and the
Huicholes, just the same in essence, indigenous to America; the
curious, silent, absorbed dance of the softly-beating feet and
ankles, the body coming down softly, but with deep weight, upon
powerful knees and ankles, to the tread of the earth, as when a
male bird treads the hen.  And women softly stepping in unison.</p>

<p>And Kate, listening to the drums, and the full-throated singing,
and watching the rich, soft bodies in the dance, thought to herself
a little sceptically:  Yes!  For these it is easier.  But all the
white men, of the dominant race, what are they doing at this
moment?</p>

<p>In the afternoon there was a great dance of the Welcome of
Quetzalcoatl.  Kate could only see a little of it, in front of the
church.</p>

<p>The drums beat vigorously all the time, the dance wound strangely
to the water's edge.  Kate heard afterwards that the procession of
women with baskets on their heads, filled with bread and fruits all
wrapped in leaves, went down to the shore and loaded the boats.
Then dancers and all got into the boats and canoas, and rowed to
the island.</p>

<p>They made a feast on the island, and learned the dance of the
Welcome of Quetzalcoatl, which they would dance every year on that
day.  And they learned the Song of the Welcome of Quetzalcoatl;
which later on Cipriano brought to Kate, as she sat in that dim
room with the unconscious woman, who made small, terrible,
mechanical noises.</p>

<p>The doctor came hastening, and the priest came after a while.
Neither could do anything.  They came in the afternoon again, and
Kate walked out and wandered on the half-deserted beach, looking at
the flock of boats drawing near the island, and feeling that life
was a more terrible issue even than death.  One could die and have
done.  But living was never done, it could never be finished, and
the responsibility could never be shifted.</p>

<p>She went back again to the sick-room, and with the aid of a woman
she undressed poor Carlota and put a nightdress on her.  Another
doctor came from the city.  But the sick woman was dying.  And Kate
was alone with her again.</p>

<p>The men, where were they?</p>

<p>The business of living?  Were they really gone about the great
business of living, abandoning her here to this business of dying?</p>

<p>It was nightfall before she heard the drums returning.  And again
that deep, full, almost martial singing of men, savage and remote,
to the sound of the drum.  Perhaps after all, life would conquer
again, and men would be men, so that women could be women.  Till
men are men indeed, women have no hope to be women.  She knew that
fatally enough.</p>

<p>Cipriano came to her, smelling of sun and sweat, his face darkly
glowing, his eyes flashing.  He glanced at the bed, at the
unconscious woman, at the medicine bottles.</p>

<p>'What do they say?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The doctors think she may come round.'</p>

<p>'She will die,' he said.</p>

<p>Then he went with her to the window.</p>

<p>'See!' he said.  'This is what they are singing.'</p>

<p>It was the Song-sheet of the Welcome to Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>WELCOME TO QUETZALCOATL<br />

</div></blockquote>

<p>Even as she read, she could hear the people outside singing it, as
the reed-flutes unthreaded the melody time after time.  This
strange dumb people of Mexico was opening its voice at last.  It
was as if a stone had been rolled off them all, and she heard their
voice for the first time, deep, wild, with a certain exultance and
menace.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'The naked one climbed in.<br />
 Quetzalcoatl has come!'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She could hear the curious defiance and exultance in the men's
voices.  Then a woman's voice, clear almost as a star itself, went
up the road at the verse:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Blue daylight sinks in my hair.<br />
 The star comes out between the two<br />
 Wonders . . .'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Strange!  The people had opened hearts at last.  They had rolled
the stone of their heaviness away, a new world had begun.  Kate was
frightened.  It was dusk.  She laid her hand on Cipriano's knee,
lost.  And he leaned and put his dark hand against her cheek,
breathing silently.</p>

<p>'To-day,' he said softly, 'we have done well.'</p>

<p>She felt for his hand.  All was so dark.  But oh, so deep, so deep
and beyond her, the vast, soft, living heat!  So beyond her!</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Put sleep as black as beauty in the secret of my belly.<br />
 Put star-oil over me.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She could almost feel her soul appealing to Cipriano for this
sacrament.</p>

<p>They sat side by side in darkness, as the night fell, and he held
his hand loosely on hers.  Outside, the people were still singing.
Some were dancing round the drum.  On the church-towers, where the
bells had been, there were fires flickering, and white forms of
men, the noise of a heavy drum, then again, the chant.  In the
yard before the church doors a fire was blazing, and men of
Huitzilopochtli stood watching two of their men, naked save for a
breech-cloth and the scarlet feathers on their head, dancing the
old spear-dance, whooping challenge in the firelight.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n came in, in his white clothes.  He pulled off his big hat,
and stood looking down at Carlota.  She no longer made noises, and
her eyes were turned up horribly, showing the whites.  Ram&oacute;n closed
his eyes a moment, and turned away, saying nothing.  He came to the
window, where Cipriano still sat in his impenetrable but living
silence, that satisfied where all speech had failed, holding Kate's
hand loosely.  Nor did he let go her hand.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n looked out, at the fires in the church towers, the fire
before the church doors, the little fires on the beach by the lake;
and the figures of men in white, the figures of women in dark
rebozos, with full white skirts, the two naked dancers, the
standing crowd, the occasional scarlet serapes of Huitzilopochtli,
the white and blue of Quetzalcoatl, the creeping away of a motor-
car, the running of boys, the men clustering round the drum, to
sing.</p>

<p>'It is life,' he said, 'which is the mystery.  Death is hardly
mysterious in comparison.'</p>

<p>There was a knocking.  The doctor had come again, and a sister to
nurse the dying woman.  Softly the sister paced round the room and
bent over her charge.</p>

<p>Cipriano and Kate went away in a boat over the dark lake, away from
all the fires and the noise into the deep darkness of the lake
beyond, to Jamiltepec.  Kate felt she wanted to be covered with
deep and living darkness, the deeps where Cipriano could lay her.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Put sleep as black as beauty in the secret of my belly.<br />
Put star-oil over me.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And Cipriano, as he sat in the boat with her, felt the inward sun
rise darkly in him, diffusing through him; and felt the mysterious
flower of her woman's femaleness slowly opening to him, as a sea-
anemone opens deep under the sea, with infinite soft fleshliness.
The hardness of self-will was gone, and the soft anemone of her
deeps blossomed for him of itself, far down under the tides.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n remained behind in the hotel, in the impenetrable sanctuary
of his own stillness.  Carlota remained unconscious.  There was a
consultation of doctors; to no effect.  She died at dawn, before
her boys could arrive from Mexico; as a canoa was putting off from
the shore with a little breeze, and the passengers were singing the
Song of Welcome to Quetzalcoatl, unexpectedly, upon the pale water.</p>
