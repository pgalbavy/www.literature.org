<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The North American Indian is treacherous by nature, and will
take any advantage over a foe, no matter what its nature. The
Sauk had failed to bring down Deerfoot by the same unscrupulous
means he had employed in other instances, but he was on the watch
to repeat his tactics.</p>

<p>When uttering the taunt which brought about the personal collision,
he flung his gun from him, and seized the handle of his tomahawk,
as if with the purpose of throwing that also aside, the manner
of his challenge implying that he meant the battle should be fought
with the knives alone. Even the sagacious Deerfoot did not suspect
him for the moment, when, on the point of grasping his knife,
as he did when defying Tecumseh, the Sauk drew back his tomahawk
and hurled it with incredible swiftness at the head of Deerfoot.
There was a vicious spitefulness in the act which sent the missile
as if fired from a gun.</p>

<p>Nothing could have attested the Shawanoe's miraculous activity
and quickness of eye so clearly as did the ease with which he
dodged the weapon. The flirt of his head was like that of the
loon which dives below the path of the bullet after it sees the
flash of the gun. The tomahawk struck the ground, went end over
end, flinging the dirt and leaves about, and after ricocheting
a couple of times, whirled against the trunk of a small sapling
and stopped.</p>

<p>The act placed the two on the same footing. Each held only his
hunting-knife. The treachery of the Sauk took place without a
word being spoken either by himself or his foe. It was unnecessary,
for there could be nothing to say.</p>

<p>Having avoided the tomahawk, Deerfoot advanced upon Hay-uta with
his knife grasped in his left hand, while the Sauk did precisely
the same thing as regarded him.</p>

<p>They were stripped for the fight, and were in deadly earnest.
The Sauk had learned of the panther-like agility of the Shawanoe,
and he knew no light task was before him. It would not be child's
play to wrench the scalp-lock from the crown of the handsome warrior
who was not afraid of any man, but Hay-uta was warranted in feeling
a strong confidence in his own strength and prowess.</p>

<p>The warriors approached each other with the watchfulness of a
couple of gladiators, seeking each others' lives for the sake
of giving amusement to a Roman populace. Both slightly crouched,
with their heads bent forward, their eyes fixed, while they stepped
softly about, seeking an opening into which the keenly-pointed
hunting knife might be driven with a furious vigor, that would
render a second blow useless.</p>

<p>The situation was one where the slightest forgetfulness or mishap
would prove fatal to him who made it. Both realized the fact,
and did their utmost to guard against it.</p>

<p>When a couple of yards separated the combatants, they approached
no closer, but began slowly circling around each other in the
same stealthy fashion. The action of the Sauk convinced Deerfoot
that his enemy had no friends in that section, for, if any were
within call, he would have summoned them before the quarrel had
gone so far. He could have called any one to his help by signal,
and neglect to do so was proof that there was none to summon.
Had Hay-uta done anything of the kind, Deerfoot would have leaped
upon him and ended the battle in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Partly around, and then back again, the two seemed to oscillate,
their motions corresponding so closely that it was as if both
were moved by the same delicate machinery between them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deerfoot feinted, like a skillful boxer, with the hand
which grasped his knife. The vigilant Sauk was equally quick to
parry and counter. He was as spry as a cat, and never once took
his burning eyes from the face of the hated youth. Then he feinted
in turn, and the Shawanoe, by his action, showed he was prepared
for any demonstration, no matter what.</p>

<p>These preliminaries continued several minutes, when Deerfoot,
in moving to the left, caught the toe of his moccasin in some
obstruction and stumbled. He threw up his arms, as one will instinctively
do, and for a single second was off his guard, though he recovered
with incredible quickness. Any spectator of the strange combat
would have given a gasp of terror, for the instant the stumble
took place, the Sauk bounded forward with upraised knife and brought
it down with a sweep like that of a panther's paw.</p>

<p>But what seemed an accident on the part of Deerfoot was done
with deliberate intent. He wearied of the idle circling, and,
confident of his own ability to outwit his antagonist, he dropped
his guard for the very purpose of drawing out the other. Hay-uta
was so certain of his own triumph that he made the mistake which
the skillful fighter never makes; he drew upon his own strength
and self-poise by emitting a shout of exultation; but the downward
sweeping arm clove vacancy only, and ere he could recover he was
struck in the chest by the head of Deerfoot, who butted him with
the force of a Japanese wrestler, sending the warrior several
feet over on his back. The shock was so unexpected, as well as
tremendous, that the knife flew from his hand, and he nearly fainted
from sheer weakness.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Deerfoot was able to butt him in that style, it will
be admitted that it would have been equally easy for him to have
buried his knife to the hilt in the body of his enemy, but he
chose not to do so. Instead, he quietly picked up the weapon and
held one in each hand, while the Sauk was entirely disarmed. The
latter had been frightfully jarred. The blow in the stomach fairly
lifted him off his feet and drove the wind from his lungs. He
lay for a moment, with his lips compressed, his body griped with
pain, and with no more ability to defend himself than an infant.
He kept his black eyes fixed on the youthful conqueror while writhing,
and the latter stood off several paces and calmly confronted him,
as though viewing the natural phase of such a contest.</p>

<p>But the Sauk was quick to recover, and his old enmity seemed
to blaze up with ten-fold intensity.</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe is a buffalo," said he, from behind his gleaming
paint; "he fights like the buffalo when his foe is stronger and
braver than he."</p>

<p>Deerfoot flung the knife of the warrior to him.</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe will fight as a buffalo no more; he will now use
his knife; let the Sauk do what he can."</p>

<p>A brave warrior could take no exception to this declaration,
accompanied as it was by such significant action; but it cannot
be conceived that the Sauk was free from misgiving, when knowing,
as he did, that he held the position of contestant only through
the grace of his youthful antagonist, who a moment before could
have pierced his heart with his hunting knife.</p>

<p>Having displayed the character of a battering ram, Deerfoot now
assumed another.</p>

<p>"The Sauk is afraid of Deerfoot; he dare not attack him until
he stumbles; Deerfoot's heart was oppressed with pity when he
saw the fear of Hay-uta, and he stumbled that it might give Hay-uta
the courage the Great Spirit did not give him."</p>

<p>These were taunting words, but, convinced they were spoken with
the purpose of disturbing his self-possession, the Sauk only compressed
his lips the tighter, and held himself ready to seize the first
chance that presented itself. His recent experience had taught
him a lesson which he could not forget.</p>

<p>Bending his knees until he assumed a crouching posture, the Sank
centered his burning gaze on the face of Deerfoot, drew back his
lips until his white teeth showed like those of a wild cat, and
uttered a tremulous, sibilant sound, as if he were a serpent ready
to burst with venom.</p>

<p>If he meant to frighten Deerfoot he failed, for the mishap of
the Sauk was too recent to allow such impression to be made. The
figure of the crouching warrior was startling in its hideousness,
but there was never a moment from the opening of the singular
contest, when the young Shawanoe did not feel secure in his mastery
of the situation.</p>

<p>The feinting and retreating went on several minutes longer, when
all at once Deerfoot caught an expression, which the paint on
the face of his antagonist could not hide, that showed he had
resolved on forcing the fight to a conclusion. A couple of quick
feints followed, and then Hay-uta leaped forward, meaning to force
Deerfoot to the earth. Had the Shawanoe remained quiet, such would
have been the result, but he was too supple to be entangled in
that manner. He withdrew, so that when his enemy landed on the
spot, he found himself still confronted by the defiant youth,
who had recoiled but the single step necessary to escape the blow.
Hay-uta, without a second's pause, bounded toward him again, and
brought down his right arm like a flash; but, as before, it cleft
the empty air, and the youth confronted him with his shadowy smile
and defiant expression.</p>

<p>Then, as if feeling he had retreated far enough, the Shawanoe
advanced on his muscular foe, who drew back as if to brace himself
for the assault. Deerfoot uttered no sound, but when he bounded
lightly from the ground, Hay-uta knew the crisis had come; the
trifling had ended.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, when close enough to strike, made a dozen circular
sweeps of his good left hand, as though he had rested it on the
rim of a wheel that was spinning with bewildering swiftness. No
eye could follow the knife in its circlings. There was one smooth
gleam like the polished periphery of the "driver" of a locomotive.</p>

<p>The foes, as is always the case, looked straight in each other's
eyes, but every limb and portion of the body, being in the field
of vision, was clearly seen. The peculiar act of Deerfoot produced
the effect intended. The vision of Hay-uta became confused and
dizzy, and before he could rally the Shawanoe struck his blow.</p>

<p>He could have killed the other as easily as he would have slain
a bear, but he chose not to do so. Instead, he brought his fist
down on the upper part of his right wrist with a quick violence,
which, for the second time, knocked the knife from the grasp of
the more sinewy warrior. So deftly was the trick done that the
weapon of the Sauk flew a dozen feet straight up in the air, turning
rapidly end over end and falling between the two.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>DEERFOOT'S VICTORY</em>.]</p>

<p>If Hay-uta was subject to the will of Deerfoot a minute before,
it will be seen that now he was helpless. He had been again disarmed,
while the lithe youth still grasped his own weapon with the power
to drive it home whenever he so willed.</p>

<p>The last act of Deerfoot accomplished its purpose. Hay-uta at
first was self-confident; again, he was hopeful; but the latter
time he was disarmed, his confidence vanished. He saw that much
as he had despised the youth whose life he sought, he was his
inferior in every respect. He was no match for him in a fight,
nor could he approach him in his peerless woodcraft. The question
of supremacy was settled forever.</p>

<p>Slowly recoiling a couple of steps, he folded his arms, and,
with a dignity that was touching, said, in a slow, deliberate
voice, with his softened gaze fixed on the countenance of his
conqueror:</p>

<p>"Hay-uta is a dog whose teeth have fallen out; he can fight no
more; he is ashamed to go back to his people; the son of a pale
face who is there, when he learns the truth, will point his finger
at him and laugh; Hay-uta cannot go to his lodge; let Deerfoot
bury his knife in his heart!"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot seeks not the life of Hay-uta; had he wished it, he
could have had it long ago; but Deerfoot is a Christian; he will
do Hay-uta no harm."</p>
