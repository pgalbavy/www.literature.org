<p>The American did not reply, but held her gaze upon the little
vessel, whose curving to the right might change at any moment;
but it kept straight on under the propulsion of the breeze until
hidden from sight by the tops of the trees. The three men had
certainly approached land, though it could not be said they had
left the boat.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked Miss Starland.</p>

<p>"Probably three natives have run to shore for a little while
and will soon pass out again and continue on their way."</p>

<p>"Let us keep watch."</p>

<p>They did so, and when an hour had passed and the sun was low
in the sky, the craft had failed to appear. Far to the westward,
a thin, dark, shadowy line lay motionless against the horizon,
too far off to be identified.</p>

<p>"I think it is the smoke of the gunboat," said the Señorita;
"General Yozarro means to come to the Castle over the same course
we followed."</p>

<p>They looked long and anxiously, but the horizontal streak of
vapor gradually faded without bringing the craft into view. The
tug had steamed in the opposite direction, or there had been a
change of mind and the fires were banked or allowed to go out.</p>

<p>Miss Starland was still gazing, hoping and dreading the appearance
of the craft, when her friend pressed her arm and asked in a hurried
undertone:</p>

<p>"Do you see him?"</p>

<p>She indicated a point in the trail no more than a furlong distant,
where it emerged around a mass of rocks, between the Castle and
the waterfall. The path just there was so narrow as to permit
the passage of only a single person or animal. Withdrawing her
gaze from the distance, she made out the form of a man, standing
at the curve. He was motionless, and evidently studying the Castle.</p>

<p>His dress and swarthy countenance, plainly visible in the sunlight,
showed that he was a native, who, for some reason, felt a peculiar
interest in the grim structure. He may have stood thus for some
minutes before the Señorita observed him, but he remained for
a brief while longer, so stationary that he might well have been
taken for a figure of stone.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"Only that he is an Atlamalcan; he wears the blue jacket; that
of the Zalapatans is red,&mdash;the two tints being the distinguishing
features of their uniforms; you observe he is dressed the same
as our guards."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him before?"</p>

<p>"He is too far off for me to observe his countenance clearly,
but, so far as I can say, he is a stranger. I think he is a member
of our guard."</p>

<p>"Why then is he not with them? What is his object in going out
there and posing in that way?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could answer your questions. Perhaps our captain suspects
we are dreaming of escape and he has sent out guards to watch
the Castle from all sides."</p>

<p>"It seems more likely to me that he came from the small boat;
he may be a messenger from General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"If so, his action is inexplicable. If a messenger, he would
hurry to the Castle and deliver his message."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has done so and is going away."</p>

<p>While all was conjecture, the man moved. It was then noted that
he carried no gun though he doubtless had smaller weapons. He
turned slowly about, facing the other way, strode a dozen steps
or so and then passed from sight. Thinking he might appear again
the two watched the spot for the following half hour, during which
he was not seen again. Then, looking in the direction of Atlamalco
they were unable to detect any trace of the finger of smoke which
had faded out and which they thought might come to view again.</p>

<p>"General Yozarro may have sailed further up the river," suggested
the Señorita.</p>

<p>"What could he hope to accomplish by that, except to run away
from General Bambos?"</p>

<p>"He may turn into the main stream, where it bifurcates, and come
down to the junction, when he can steam up to Zalapata."</p>

<p>"Let us stop speculating about him. Just now I am more interested
in the stranger, and, as sure as I live, there he is again!"</p>

<p>The brief twilight was already closing in, when the form of a
man&mdash;presumably the one whom they had already noted&mdash;came into
view at the point where he was first observed. Instead of pausing
as before, he continued to advance toward the plateau on which
stood the Castle. His pace was an ordinary one, showing neither
haste nor hesitation. It was a striking proof of the shortness
of the tropical twilight that although the flickering figure steadily
drew nearer, it as steadily grew more indistinct. When his head
and shoulders rose over the edge of the plateau, it was almost
impossible to see his countenance, though no doubt remained that
he was an Atlamalcan soldier. A little closer approach and he
was hidden from the sight of the watchers in the upper story.</p>

<p>The interior was now so dark that they descended to where the
lamp supported by the bracket at the side of the wall, was lighted.
At the same moment, the knock of the servant Juanita sounded,
and she brought their evening meal. The Señorita questioned her
and she said that a soldier had just arrived and was talking to
Captain Navarro of the guard, but she knew nothing of his errand.</p>

<p>The two friends were in a flutter, and, tarrying only long enough
to partake slightly, they hastened to their lookout. They waited
and looked for a considerable time, but saw nothing of the stranger
in whom they were so much interested.</p>

<p>When it had become wholly dark, they passed to the living apartment,
which was moderately illuminated by the lamp. The gloom outside
would continue until the moon appeared, when the light would be
as vivid almost as mid-day.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one knocked on the door. The peculiar sound showed
that it was not a servant claiming admission. Señorita Estacardo
sprang up, turned the key and drew open the massive structure
for a few inches. Then she recoiled at sight of the soldier in
the blue jacket standing before her, bowing low with hat in hand.</p>

<p>After his "<em>buenas noches</em>," he uttered the amazing words:</p>

<p>"I have come for the American Señorita."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>He stepped softly inside, pushed the door shut and placed his
finger to his lips as a warning for them to be cautious. The young
women were frightened by his presumption, and the Señorita was
about to command him to leave, when, bowing low, he handed a slip
of paper to her.</p>

<p>"It is for the other Señorita," he explained.</p>

<p>The wondering young woman took the paper and handed it to her
friend, who had come forward. Moving a little aside, so as to
stand under the lamp, she saw her name pencilled on the outside
in a familiar handwriting, and unfolding the slip, she read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

"You can trust the bearer fully; he is our friend; do<br/>
exactly as he tells you, and do it quickly, for there is not<br/>
a moment to lose.

</p>
<p>
"Jack Starland."
