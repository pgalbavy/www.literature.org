<p>"Kaspar!  Makan!"</p>

<p>The well-known shrill voice startled Almayer from his dream of
splendid future into the unpleasant realities of the present hour. 
An unpleasant voice too.  He had heard it for many years, and
with every year he liked it less.  No matter; there would be an
end to all this soon.</p>

<p>He shuffled uneasily, but took no further notice of the call. 
Leaning with both his elbows on the balustrade of the verandah,
he went on looking fixedly at the great river that flowed&mdash;indifferent
and hurried&mdash;before his eyes.  He liked to look at it about the
time of sunset; perhaps because at that time the sinking sun would
spread a glowing gold tinge on the waters of the Pantai, and Almayer's
thoughts were often busy with gold; gold he had failed to secure;
gold the others had secured&mdash;dishonestly, of course&mdash;or gold he
meant to secure yet, through his own honest exertions, for himself
and Nina.  He absorbed himself in his dream of wealth and power
away from this coast where he had dwelt for so many years, forgetting
the bitterness of toil and strife in the vision of a great and
splendid reward.  They would live in Europe, he and his daughter. 
They would be rich and respected.  Nobody would think of her mixed
blood in the presence of her great beauty and of his immense wealth. 
Witnessing her triumphs he would grow young again, he would forget
the twenty-five years of heart-breaking struggle on this coast
where he felt like a prisoner.  All this was nearly within his
reach.  Let only Dain return!  And return soon he must&mdash;in his
own interest, for his own share.  He was now more than a week
late!  Perhaps he would return to-night.  Such were Almayer's
thoughts as, standing on the verandah of his new but already decaying
house&mdash;that last failure of his life&mdash;he looked on the broad river. 
There was no tinge of gold on it this evening, for it had been
swollen by the rains, and rolled an angry and muddy flood under
his inattentive eyes, carrying small drift-wood and big dead logs,
and whole uprooted trees with branches and foliage, amongst which
the water swirled and roared angrily.</p>

<p>One of those drifting trees grounded on the shelving shore, just
by the house, and Almayer, neglecting his dream, watched it with
languid interest.  The tree swung slowly round, amid the hiss
and foam of the water, and soon getting free of the obstruction
began to move down stream again, rolling slowly over, raising
upwards a long, denuded branch, like a hand lifted in mute appeal
to heaven against the river's brutal and unnecessary violence. 
Almayer's interest in the fate of that tree increased rapidly. 
He leaned over to see if it would clear the low point below. 
It did; then he drew back, thinking that now its course was free
down to the sea, and he envied the lot of that inanimate thing
now growing small and indistinct in the deepening darkness.  As
he lost sight of it altogether he began to wonder how far out
to sea it would drift. Would the current carry it north or south? 
South, probably, till it drifted in sight of Celebes, as far as
Macassar, perhaps!</p>

<p>Macassar!  Almayer's quickened fancy distanced the tree on its
imaginary voyage, but his memory lagging behind some twenty years
or more in point of time saw a young and slim Almayer, clad all
in white and modest-looking, landing from the Dutch mail-boat
on the dusty jetty of Macassar, coming to woo fortune in the godowns
of old Hudig.  It was an important epoch in his life, the beginning
of a new existence for him. His father, a subordinate official
employed in the Botanical Gardens of Buitenzorg, was no doubt
delighted to place his son in such a firm.  The young man himself
too was nothing loth to leave the poisonous shores of Java, and
the meagre comforts of the parental bungalow, where the father
grumbled all day at the stupidity of native gardeners, and the
mother from the depths of her long easy-chair bewailed the lost
glories of Amsterdam, where she had been brought up, and of her
position as the daughter of a cigar dealer there.</p>

<p>Almayer had left his home with a light heart and a lighter pocket,
speaking English well, and strong in arithmetic; ready to conquer
the world, never doubting that he would.</p>

<p>After those twenty years, standing in the close and stifling
heat of a Bornean evening, he recalled with pleasurable regret
the image of Hudig's lofty and cool warehouses with their long
and straight avenues of gin cases and bales of Manchester goods;
the big door swinging noiselessly; the dim light of the place,
so delightful after the glare of the streets; the little railed-off
spaces amongst piles of merchandise where the Chinese clerks,
neat, cool, and sad-eyed, wrote rapidly and in silence amidst
the din of the working gangs rolling casks or shifting cases to
a muttered song, ending with a desperate yell.  At the upper end,
facing the great door, there was a larger space railed off, well
lighted; there the noise was subdued by distance, and above it
rose the soft and continuous clink of silver guilders which other
discreet Chinamen were counting and piling up under the supervision
of Mr. Vinck, the cashier, the genius presiding in the place&mdash;the
right hand of the Master.</p>

<p>In that clear space Almayer worked at his table not far from
a little green painted door, by which always stood a Malay in
a red sash and turban, and whose hand, holding a small string
dangling from above, moved up and down with the regularity of
a machine.  The string worked a punkah on the other side of the
green door, where the so-called private office was, and where
old Hudig&mdash;the Master&mdash;sat enthroned, holding noisy receptions. 
Sometimes the little door would fly open disclosing to the outer
world, through the bluish haze of tobacco smoke, a long table
loaded with bottles of various shapes and tall water-pitchers,
rattan easy-chairs occupied by noisy men in sprawling attitudes,
while the Master would put his head through and, holding by the
handle, would grunt confidentially to Vinck; perhaps send an order
thundering down the warehouse, or spy a hesitating stranger and
greet him with a friendly roar, "Welgome, Gapitan! ver' you gome
vrom?  Bali, eh?  Got bonies?  I vant bonies!  Vant all you got;
ha! ha! ha!  Gome in!"  Then the stranger was dragged in, in a
tempest of yells, the door was shut, and the usual noises refilled
the place; the song of the workmen, the rumble of barrels, the
scratch of rapid pens; while above all rose the musical chink
of broad silver pieces streaming ceaselessly through the yellow
fingers of the attentive Chinamen.</p>

<p>At that time Macassar was teeming with life and commerce.  It
was the point in the islands where tended all those bold spirits
who, fitting out schooners on the Australian coast, invaded the
Malay Archipelago in search of money and adventure.  Bold, reckless,
keen in business, not disinclined for a brush with the pirates
that were to be found on many a coast as yet, making money fast,
they used to have a general "rendezvous" in the bay for purposes
of trade and dissipation.  The Dutch merchants called those men
English pedlars; some of them were undoubtedly gentlemen for whom
that kind of life had a charm; most were seamen; the acknowledged
king of them all was Tom Lingard, he whom the Malays, honest or
dishonest, quiet fishermen or desperate cut-throats, recognised
as "the Rajah-Laut"&mdash;the King of the Sea.</p>

<p>Almayer had heard of him before he had been three days in Macassar,
had heard the stories of his smart business transactions, his
loves, and also of his desperate fights with the Sulu pirates,
together with the romantic tale of some child&mdash;a girl&mdash;found in
a piratical prau by the victorious Lingard, when, after a long
contest, he boarded the craft, driving the crew overboard.  This
girl, it was generally known, Lingard had adopted, was having
her educated in some convent in Java, and spoke of her as "my
daughter."  He had sworn a mighty oath to marry her to a white
man before he went home and to leave her all his money.  "And
Captain Lingard has lots of money," would say Mr. Vinck solemnly,
with his head on one side, "lots of money; more than Hudig!" 
And after a pause&mdash;just to let his hearers recover from their
astonishment at such an incredible assertion&mdash;he would add in
an explanatory whisper, "You know, he has discovered a river."</p>

<p>That was it!  He had discovered a river!  That was the fact placing
old Lingard so much above the common crowd of sea-going adventurers
who traded with Hudig in the daytime and drank champagne, gambled,
sang noisy songs, and made love to half-caste girls under the
broad verandah of the Sunda Hotel at night.  Into that river,
whose entrances himself only knew, Lingard used to take his assorted
cargo of Manchester goods, brass gongs, rifles and gunpowder. 
His brig <em>Flash</em>, which he commanded himself, would on
those occasions disappear quietly during the night from the roadstead
while his companions were sleeping off the effects of the midnight
carouse, Lingard seeing them drunk under the table before going
on board, himself unaffected by any amount of liquor.  Many tried
to follow him and find that land of plenty for gutta-percha and
rattans, pearl shells and birds' nests, wax and gum-dammar, but
the little <em>Flash</em> could outsail every craft in those seas. 
A few of them came to grief on hidden sandbanks and coral reefs,
losing their all and barely escaping with life from the cruel
grip of this sunny and smiling sea; others got discouraged; and
for many years the green and peaceful-looking islands guarding
the entrances to the promised land kept their secret with all
the merciless serenity of tropical nature.  And so Lingard came
and went on his secret or open expeditions, becoming a hero in
Almayer's eyes by the boldness and enormous profits of his ventures,
seeming to Almayer a very great man indeed as he saw him marching
up the warehouse, grunting a "how are you?" to Vinck, or greeting
Hudig, the Master, with a boisterous "Hallo, old pirate!  Alive
yet?" as a preliminary to transacting business behind the little
green door.  Often of an evening, in the silence of the then deserted
warehouse, Almayer putting away his papers before driving home
with Mr. Vinck, in whose household he lived, would pause listening
to the noise of a hot discussion in the private office, would
hear the deep and monotonous growl of the Master, and the roared-out
interruptions of Lingard&mdash;two mastiffs fighting over a marrowy
bone.  But to Almayer's ears it sounded like a quarrel of Titans&mdash;a
battle of the gods.</p>

<p>After a year or so Lingard, having been brought often in contact
with Almayer in the course of business, took a sudden and, to
the onlookers, a rather inexplicable fancy to the young man. 
He sang his praises, late at night, over a convivial glass to
his cronies in the Sunda Hotel, and one fine morning electrified
Vinck by declaring that he must have "that young fellow for a
supercargo.  Kind of captain's clerk.  Do all my quill-driving
for me."  Hudig consented.  Almayer, with youth's natural craving
for change, was nothing loth, and packing his few belongings,
started in the <em>Flash</em> on one of those long cruises when
the old seaman was wont to visit almost every island in the archipelago. 
Months slipped by, and Lingard's friendship seemed to increase. 
Often pacing the deck with Almayer, when the faint night breeze,
heavy with aromatic exhalations of the islands, shoved the brig
gently along under the peaceful and sparkling sky, did the old
seaman open his heart to his entranced listener.  He spoke of
his past life, of escaped dangers, of big profits in his trade,
of new combinations that were in the future to bring profits bigger
still.  Often he had mentioned his daughter, the girl found in
the pirate prau, speaking of her with a strange assumption of
fatherly tenderness.  "She must be a big girl now," he used to
say. "It's nigh unto four years since I have seen her!  Damme,
Almayer, if I don't think we will run into Sourabaya this trip." 
And after such a declaration he always dived into his cabin muttering
to himself, "Something must be done&mdash;must be done."  More than
once he would astonish Almayer by walking up to him rapidly, clearing
his throat with a powerful "Hem!" as if he was going to say something,
and then turning abruptly away to lean over the bulwarks in silence,
and watch, motionless, for hours, the gleam and sparkle of the
phosphorescent sea along the ship's side.  It was the night before
arriving in Sourabaya when one of those attempts at confidential
communication succeeded.  After clearing his throat he spoke. 
He spoke to some purpose.  He wanted Almayer to marry his adopted
daughter.  "And don't you kick because you're white!" he shouted,
suddenly, not giving the surprised young man the time to say a
word.  "None of that with me!  Nobody will see the colour of your
wife's skin.  The dollars are too thick for that, I tell you! 
And mind you, they will be thicker yet before I die.  There will
be millions, Kaspar! Millions I say!  And all for her&mdash;and for
you, if you do what you are told."</p>

<p>Startled by the unexpected proposal, Almayer hesitated, and remained
silent for a minute.  He was gifted with a strong and active imagination,
and in that short space of time he saw, as in a flash of dazzling
light, great piles of shining guilders, and realised all the possibilities
of an opulent existence.  The consideration, the indolent ease
of life&mdash;for which he felt himself so well fitted&mdash;his ships,
his warehouses, his merchandise (old Lingard would not live for
ever), and, crowning all, in the far future gleamed like a fairy
palace the big mansion in Amsterdam, that earthly paradise of
his dreams, where, made king amongst men by old Lingard's money,
he would pass the evening of his days in inexpressible splendour. 
As to the other side of the picture&mdash;the companionship for life
of a Malay girl, that legacy of a boatful of pirates&mdash;there was
only within him a confused consciousness of shame that he a white
man &mdash;Still, a convent education of four years!&mdash;and then
she may mercifully die.  He was always lucky, and money is powerful! 
Go through it.  Why not?  He had a vague idea of shutting her
up somewhere, anywhere, out of his gorgeous future.  Easy enough
to dispose of a Malay woman, a slave, after all, to his Eastern
mind, convent or no convent, ceremony or no ceremony.</p>

<p>He lifted his head and confronted the anxious yet irate seaman.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>of course&mdash;anything you wish, Captain Lingard."</p>

<p>"Call me father, my boy.  She does," said the mollified old adventurer.
"Damme, though, if I didn't think you were going to refuse.  Mind
you, Kaspar, I always get my way, so it would have been no use. 
But you are no fool."</p>

<p>He remembered well that time&mdash;the look, the accent, the words,
the effect they produced on him, his very surroundings.  He remembered
the narrow slanting deck of the brig, the silent sleeping coast,
the smooth black surface of the sea with a great bar of gold laid
on it by the rising moon.  He remembered it all, and he remembered
his feelings of mad exultation at the thought of that fortune
thrown into his hands.  He was no fool then, and he was no fool
now.  Circumstances had been against him; the fortune was gone,
but hope remained.</p>

<p>He shivered in the night air, and suddenly became aware of the
intense darkness which, on the sun's departure, had closed in
upon the river, blotting out the outlines of the opposite shore. 
Only the fire of dry branches lit outside the stockade of the
Rajah's compound called fitfully into view the ragged trunks of
the surrounding trees, putting a stain of glowing red half-way
across the river where the drifting logs were hurrying towards
the sea through the impenetrable gloom.  He had a hazy recollection
of having been called some time during the evening by his wife. 
To his dinner probably.  But a man busy contemplating the wreckage
of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever
his rice is ready.  Time he went home, though; it was getting
late.</p>

<p>He stepped cautiously on the loose planks towards the ladder. 
A lizard, disturbed by the noise, emitted a plaintive note and
scurried through the long grass growing on the bank.  Almayer
descended the ladder carefully, now thoroughly recalled to the
realities of life by the care necessary to prevent a fall on the
uneven ground where the stones, decaying planks, and half-sawn
beams were piled up in inextricable confusion.  As he turned towards
the house where he lived&mdash;"my old house" he called it&mdash;his ear
detected the splash of paddles away in the darkness of the river. 
He stood still in the path, attentive and surprised at anybody
being on the river at this late hour during such a heavy freshet. 
Now he could hear the paddles distinctly, and even a rapidly exchanged
word in low tones, the heavy breathing of men fighting with the
current, and hugging the bank on which he stood.  Quite close,
too, but it was too dark to distinguish anything under the overhanging
bushes.</p>

<p>"Arabs, no doubt," muttered Almayer to himself, peering into
the solid blackness.  "What are they up to now?  Some of Abdulla's
business; curse him!"</p>

<p>The boat was very close now.</p>

<p>"Oh, ya!  Man!" hailed Almayer.</p>

<p>The sound of voices ceased, but the paddles worked as furiously
as before.  Then the bush in front of Almayer shook, and the sharp
sound of the paddles falling into the canoe rang in the quiet
night.  They were holding on to the bush now; but Almayer could
hardly make out an indistinct dark shape of a man's head and shoulders
above the bank.</p>

<p>"You Abdulla?" said Almayer, doubtfully.</p>

<p>A grave voice answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tuan Almayer is speaking to a friend.  There is no Arab here."</p>

<p>Almayer's heart gave a great leap.</p>

<p>"Dain!" he exclaimed.  "At last! at last!  I have been waiting
for you every day and every night.  I had nearly given you up."</p>

<p>"Nothing could have stopped me from coming back here," said the
other, almost violently.  "Not even death," he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>"This is a friend's talk, and is very good," said Almayer, heartily. 
"But you are too far here.  Drop down to the jetty and let your
men cook their rice in my campong while we talk in the house."</p>

<p>There was no answer to that invitation.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Almayer, uneasily.  "There is nothing wrong
with the brig, I hope?"</p>

<p>"The brig is where no Orang Blanda can lay his hands on her,"
said Dain, with a gloomy tone in his voice, which Almayer, in
his elation, failed to notice.</p>

<p>"Right," he said.  "But where are all your men?  There are only
two with you."</p>

<p>"Listen, Tuan Almayer," said Dain.  "To-morrow's sun shall see
me in your house, and then we will talk.  Now I must go to the
Rajah."</p>

<p>"To the Rajah!  Why?  What do you want with Lakamba?"</p>

<p>"Tuan, to-morrow we talk like friends.  I must see Lakamba to-night."</p>

<p>"Dain, you are not going to abandon me now, when all is ready?"
asked Almayer, in a pleading voice.</p>

<p>"Have I not returned?  But I must see Lakamba first for your
good and mine."</p>

<p>The shadowy head disappeared abruptly.  The bush, released from
the grasp of the bowman, sprung back with a swish, scattering
a shower of muddy water over Almayer, as he bent forward, trying
to see.</p>

<p>In a little while the canoe shot into the streak of light that
streamed on the river from the big fire on the opposite shore,
disclosing the outline of two men bending to their work, and a
third figure in the stern flourishing the steering paddle, his
head covered with an enormous round hat, like a fantastically
exaggerated mushroom.</p>

<p>Almayer watched the canoe till it passed out of the line of light.
Shortly after the murmur of many voices reached him across the
water.  He could see the torches being snatched out of the burning
pile, and rendering visible for a moment the gate in the stockade
round which they crowded.  Then they went in apparently.  The
torches disappeared, and the scattered fire sent out only a dim
and fitful glare.</p>

<p>Almayer stepped homewards with long strides and mind uneasy. 
Surely Dain was not thinking of playing him false.  It was absurd. 
Dain and Lakamba were both too much interested in the success
of his scheme.  Trusting to Malays was poor work; but then even
Malays have some sense and understand their own interest.  All
would be well&mdash;must be well.  At this point in his meditation
he found himself at the foot of the steps leading to the verandah
of his home.  From the low point of land where he stood he could
see both branches of the river.  The main branch of the Pantai
was lost in complete darkness, for the fire at the Rajah's had
gone out altogether; but up the Sambir reach his eye could follow
the long line of Malay houses crowding the bank, with here and
there a dim light twinkling through bamboo walls, or a smoky torch
burning on the platforms built out over the river.  Further away,
where the island ended in a low cliff, rose a dark mass of buildings
towering above the Malay structures. Founded solidly on a firm
ground with plenty of space, starred by many lights burning strong
and white, with a suggestion of paraffin and lampglasses, stood
the house and the godowns of Abdulla bin Selim, the great trader
of Sambir.  To Almayer the sight was very distasteful, and he
shook his fist towards the buildings that in their evident prosperity
looked to him cold and insolent, and contemptuous of his own fallen
fortunes.</p>

<p>He mounted the steps of his house slowly.</p>

<p>In the middle of the verandah there was a round table.  On it
a paraffin lamp without a globe shed a hard glare on the three
inner sides.  The fourth side was open, and faced the river. 
Between the rough supports of the high-pitched roof hung torn
rattan screens.  There was no ceiling, and the harsh brilliance
of the lamp was toned above into a soft halflight that lost itself
in the obscurity amongst the rafters.  The front wall was cut
in two by the doorway of a central passage closed by a red curtain. 
The women's room opened into that passage, which led to the back
courtyard and to the cooking shed.  In one of the side walls there
was a doorway.  Half obliterated words&mdash;"Office: Lingard and Co."&mdash;were
still legible on the dusty door, which looked as if it had not
been opened for a very long time.  Close to the other side wall
stood a bentwood rocking-chair, and by the table and about the
verandah four wooden armchairs straggled forlornly, as if ashamed
of their shabby surroundings.  A heap of common mats lay in one
corner, with an old hammock slung diagonally above.  In the other
corner, his head wrapped in a piece of red calico, huddled into
a shapeless heap, slept a Malay, one of Almayer's domestic slaves&mdash;"my
own people," he used to call them.  A numerous and representative
assembly of moths were holding high revels round the lamp to the
spirited music of swarming mosquitoes.  Under the palm-leaf thatch
lizards raced on the beams calling softly.  A monkey, chained
to one of the verandah supports&mdash;retired for the night under the
eaves&mdash;peered and grinned at Almayer, as it swung to one of the
bamboo roof sticks and caused a shower of dust and bits of dried
leaves to settle on the shabby table.  The floor was uneven, with
many withered plants and dried earth scattered about.  A general
air of squalid neglect pervaded the place.  Great red stains on
the floor and walls testified to frequent and indiscriminate betel-nut
chewing.  The light breeze from the river swayed gently the tattered
blinds, sending from the woods opposite a faint and sickly perfume
as of decaying flowers.</p>

<p>Under Almayer's heavy tread the boards of the verandah creaked
loudly. The sleeper in the corner moved uneasily, muttering indistinct
words. There was a slight rustle behind the curtained doorway,
and a soft voice asked in Malay, "Is it you, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Nina.  I am hungry.  Is everybody asleep in this house?"</p>

<p>Almayer spoke jovially and dropped with a contented sigh into
the armchair nearest to the table.  Nina Almayer came through
the curtained doorway followed by an old Malay woman, who busied
herself in setting upon the table a plateful of rice and fish,
a jar of water, and a bottle half full of genever.  After carefully
placing before her master a cracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon
she went away noiselessly.  Nina stood by the table, one hand
lightly resting on its edge, the other hanging listlessly by her
side.  Her face turned towards the outer darkness, through which
her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing picture, wore a
look of impatient expectancy.  She was tall for a halfcaste, with
the correct profile of the father, modified and strengthened by
the squareness of the lower part of the face inherited from her
maternal ancestors&mdash;the Sulu pirates.  Her firm mouth, with the
lips slightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth, put
a vague suggestion of ferocity into the impatient expression of
her features.  And yet her dark and perfect eyes had all the tender
softness of expression common to Malay women, but with a gleam
of superior intelligence; they looked gravely, wide open and steady,
as if facing something invisible to all other eyes, while she
stood there all in white, straight, flexible, graceful, unconscious
of herself, her low but broad forehead crowned with a shining
mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over her shoulders,
and made her pale olive complexion look paler still by the contrast
of its coal-black hue.</p>

<p>Almayer attacked his rice greedily, but after a few mouthfuls
he paused, spoon in hand, and looked at his daughter curiously.</p>

<p>"Did you hear a boat pass about half an hour ago Nina?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl gave him a quick glance, and moving away from the light
stood with her back to the table.</p>

<p>"No," she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"There was a boat.  At last!  Dain himself; and he went on to
Lakamba.  I know it, for he told me so.  I spoke to him, but he
would not come here to-night.  Will come to-morrow, he said."</p>

<p>He swallowed another spoonful, then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am almost happy to-night, Nina.  I can see the end of a long
road, and it leads us away from this miserable swamp.  We shall
soon get away from here, I and you, my dear little girl, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose from the table and stood looking fixedly before him as
if contemplating some enchanting vision.</p>

<p>"And then," he went on, "we shall be happy, you and I.  Live
rich and respected far from here, and forget this life, and all
this struggle, and all this misery!"</p>

<p>He approached his daughter and passed his hand caressingly over
her hair.</p>

<p>"It is bad to have to trust a Malay," he said, "but I must own
that this Dain is a perfect gentleman&mdash;a perfect gentleman," he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Did you ask him to come here, father?" inquired Nina, not looking
at him.</p>

<p>"Well, of course.  We shall start on the day after to-morrow,"
said Almayer, joyously.  "We must not lose any time.  Are you
glad, little girl?"</p>

<p>She was nearly as tall as himself, but he liked to recall the
time when she was little and they were all in all to each other.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said, very low.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Almayer, vivaciously, "you cannot imagine what
is before you.  I myself have not been to Europe, but I have heard
my mother talk so often that I seem to know all about it.  We
shall live a&mdash;a glorious life.  You shall see."</p>

<p>Again he stood silent by his daughter's side looking at that
enchanting vision.  After a while he shook his clenched hand towards
the sleeping settlement.</p>

<p>"Ah! my friend Abdulla," he cried, "we shall see who will have
the best of it after all these years!"</p>

<p>He looked up the river and remarked calmly:</p>

<p>"Another thunderstorm.  Well!  No thunder will keep me awake
to-night, I know!  Good-night, little girl," he whispered, tenderly
kissing her cheek.  "You do not seem to be very happy to-night,
but to-morrow you will show a brighter face.  Eh?"</p>

<p>Nina had listened to her father with her face unmoved, with her
half-closed eyes still gazing into the night now made more intense
by a heavy thunder-cloud that had crept down from the hills blotting
out the stars, merging sky, forest, and river into one mass of
almost palpable blackness.  The faint breeze had died out, but
the distant rumble of thunder and pale flashes of lightning gave
warning of the approaching storm.  With a sigh the girl turned
towards the table.</p>

<p>Almayer was in his hammock now, already half asleep.</p>

<p>"Take the lamp, Nina," he muttered, drowsily.  "This place is
full of mosquitoes.  Go to sleep, daughter."</p>

<p>But Nina put the lamp out and turned back again towards the balustrade
of the verandah, standing with her arm round the wooden support
and looking eagerly towards the Pantai reach.  And motionless
there in the oppressive calm of the tropical night she could see
at each flash of lightning the forest lining both banks up the
river, bending before the furious blast of the coming tempest,
the upper reach of the river whipped into white foam by the wind,
and the black clouds torn into fantastic shapes trailing low over
the swaying trees.  Round her all was as yet stillness and peace,
but she could hear afar off the roar of the wind, the hiss of
heavy rain, the wash of the waves on the tormented river.  It
came nearer and nearer, with loud thunder-claps and long flashes
of vivid lightning, followed by short periods of appalling blackness. 
When the storm reached the low point dividing the river, the house
shook in the wind, and the rain pattered loudly on the palm-leaf
roof, the thunder spoke in one prolonged roll, and the incessant
