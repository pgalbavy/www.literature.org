O blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,<br/>
Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream<br/>
Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At present such things, since they are her theme,<br/>
So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,<br/>
Bellona, what you will&mdash;they mean but wars.

</p>
<p>
All was prepared&mdash;the fire, the sword, the men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wield them in their terrible array.<br/>
The army, like a lion from his den,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,&mdash;<br/>
A human Hydra, issuing from its fen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To breathe destruction on its winding way,<br/>
Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain<br/>
Immediately in others grew again.

</p>
<p>
History can only take things in the gross;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But could we know them in detail, perchance<br/>
In balancing the profit and the loss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;War's merit it by no means might enhance,<br/>
To waste so much gold for a little dross,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.<br/>
The drying up a single tear has more<br/>
Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.

</p>
<p>
And why?&mdash;because it brings self-approbation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas the other, after all its glare,<br/>
Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,<br/>
A higher title, or a loftier station,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,<br/>
Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,<br/>
Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.

</p>
<p>
And such they are&mdash;and such they will be found:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so Leonidas and Washington,<br/>
Whose every battle-field is holy ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.<br/>
How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the mere victor's may appal or stun<br/>
The servile and the vain, such names will be<br/>
A watchword till the future shall be free.

</p>
<p>
The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,<br/>
Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the Danube's waters shone the same&mdash;<br/>
A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame<br/>
The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes<br/>
Spare, or smite rarely&mdash;man's make millions ashes!

</p>
<p>
The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,<br/>
When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:<br/>
Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;<br/>
While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when<br/>
The restless Titan hiccups in his den.

</p>
<p>
And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same moment, loud as even the roar<br/>
Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore<br/>
Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,<br/>
Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through<br/>
All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'

</p>
<p>
The columns were in movement one and all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But of the portion which attack'd by water,<br/>
Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,<br/>
As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'<br/>
If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and<br/>
Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.

</p>
<p>
The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between<br/>
His cap and head, which proves the head to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic as was ever seen,<br/>
Because it then received no injury<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean<br/>
No harm unto a right legitimate head:<br/>
'Ashes to ashes'&mdash;why not lead to lead?

</p>
<p>
Also the General Markow, Brigadier,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insisting on removal of the prince<br/>
Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,<br/>
And shriek for water into a deaf ear,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Markow, who could thus evince<br/>
His sympathy for rank, by the same token,<br/>
To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.

</p>
<p>
Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills<br/>
Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;<br/>
Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills<br/>
Past, present, and to come;&mdash;but all may yield<br/>
To the true portrait of one battle-field.

</p>
<p>
There the still varying pangs, which multiply<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until their very number makes men hard<br/>
By the infinities of agony,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard&mdash;<br/>
The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn'd back within its socket,&mdash;these reward<br/>
Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest<br/>
May win perhaps a riband at the breast!

</p>
<p>
Yet I love glory;&mdash;glory 's a great thing:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think what it is to be in your old age<br/>
Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,<br/>
And heroes are but made for bards to sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is still better; thus in verse to wage<br/>
Your wars eternally, besides enjoying<br/>
Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.

</p>
<p>
The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a battery on the right; the others,<br/>
Who landed lower down, their landing done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:<br/>
Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,<br/>
O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,<br/>
Quite orderly, as if upon parade.

</p>
<p>
And this was admirable; for so hot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,<br/>
Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.<br/>
Of officers a third fell on the spot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing which victory by no means boded<br/>
To gentlemen engaged in the assault:<br/>
Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.

</p>
<p>
But here I leave the general concern,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To track our hero on his path of fame:<br/>
He must his laurels separately earn;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,<br/>
Though all deserving equally to turn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A couplet, or an elegy to claim,<br/>
Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,<br/>
And what is worse still, a much longer story:

</p>
<p>
And therefore we must give the greater number<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Gazette&mdash;which doubtless fairly dealt<br/>
By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt<br/>
Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt<br/>
In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss<br/>
Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.

</p>
<p>
Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought away with might and main, not knowing<br/>
The way which they had never trod before,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still less guessing where they might be going;<br/>
But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,<br/>
But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,<br/>
To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.

</p>
<p>
Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dead and dying thousands,&mdash;sometimes gaining<br/>
A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To some odd angle for which all were straining;<br/>
At other times, repulsed by the close fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining<br/>
Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er<br/>
A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.

</p>
<p>
Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightly muster and the silent march<br/>
In the chill dark, when courage does not glow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much as under a triumphal arch,<br/>
Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,<br/>
Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;&mdash;<br/>
Yet for all this he did not run away.

</p>
<p>
Indeed he could not. But what if he had?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been and are heroes who begun<br/>
With something not much better, or as bad:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,<br/>
For the first and last time; for, like a pad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one<br/>
Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,<br/>
And fight like fiends for pay or politics.

</p>
<p>
He was what Erin calls, in her sublime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic<br/>
(The antiquarians who can settle time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,<br/>
Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic<br/>
Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational<br/>
As any other notion, and not national);&mdash;

</p>
<p>
But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing of impulse and a child of song;<br/>
Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),<br/>
And afterward, if he must needs destroy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such good company as always throng<br/>
To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,<br/>
No less delighted to employ his leisure;

</p>
<p>
But always without malice: if he warr'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best<br/>
Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be produced when brought up to the test.<br/>
The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer&mdash;ward<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Off each attack, when people are in quest<br/>
Of their designs, by saying they meant well;<br/>
'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'

</p>
<p>
I almost lately have begun to doubt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether hell's pavement&mdash;if it be so paved&mdash;<br/>
Must not have latterly been quite worn out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,<br/>
But by the mass who go below without<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved<br/>
And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell<br/>
Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.

</p>
<p>
Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrior from warrior in their grim career,<br/>
Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at the close of the first bridal year,<br/>
By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,<br/>
When, after a good deal of heavy firing,<br/>
He found himself alone, and friends retiring.

</p>
<p>
I don't know how the thing occurr'd&mdash;it might<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,<br/>
And that the rest had faced unto the right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About; a circumstance which has confounded<br/>
Caesar himself, who, in the very sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his whole army, which so much abounded<br/>
In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,<br/>
And rally back his Romans to the field.

</p>
<p>
Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought<br/>
He knew not why, arriving at this pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought<br/>
For a much longer time; then, like an as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought<br/>
This simile enough for Ajax, Juan<br/>
Perhaps may find it better than a new one)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;<br/>
But seeing, flashing forward, like the day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the hills, a fire enough to blind<br/>
Those who dislike to look upon a fray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled on, to try if he could find<br/>
A path, to add his own slight arm and forces<br/>
To corps, the greater part of which were corses.

</p>
<p>
Perceiving then no more the commandant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had<br/>
Quite disappear'd&mdash;the gods know howl (I can't<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Account for every thing which may look bad<br/>
In history; but we at least may grant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not marvellous that a mere lad,<br/>
In search of glory, should look on before,<br/>
Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left at large, like a young heir, to make<br/>
His way to&mdash;where he knew not&mdash;single handed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As travellers follow over bog and brake<br/>
An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;<br/>
So Juan, following honour and his nose,<br/>
Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.

</p>
<p>
He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins<br/>
Fill'd as with lightning&mdash;for his spirit shared<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour, as is the case with lively brains;<br/>
And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,<br/>
He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken<br/>
By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!

</p>
<p>
And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell in with what was late the second column,<br/>
Under the orders of the General Lascy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now reduced, as is a bulky volume<br/>
Into an elegant extract (much less massy)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of heroism, and took his place with solemn<br/>
Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces<br/>
And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.

</p>
<p>
Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when<br/>
Men run away much rather than go through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;<br/>
But Johnson was a clever fellow, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'<br/>
And never ran away, except when running<br/>
Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.

</p>
<p>
And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose<br/>
More virgin valour never dreamt of flying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From ignorance of danger, which indues<br/>
Its votaries, like innocence relying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,&mdash;<br/>
Johnson retired a little, just to rally<br/>
Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'

</p>
<p>
And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,<br/>
Rampart, wall, casement, house,&mdash;for there was not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extensive city, sore beset<br/>
By Christian soldiery, a single spot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,<br/>
He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd<br/>
By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.

</p>
<p>
And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from<br/>
The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.<br/>
Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,<br/>
And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds<br/>
Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.

</p>
<p>
By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,<br/>
Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his<br/>
Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):<br/>
Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,<br/>
And could be very busy without bustle;

</p>
<p>
And therefore, when he ran away, he did so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reflection, knowing that behind<br/>
He would find others who would fain be rid so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of idle apprehensions, which like wind<br/>
Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,<br/>
But when they light upon immediate death,<br/>
Retire a little, merely to take breath.

</p>
<p>
But Johnson only ran off, to return<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many other warriors, as we said,<br/>
Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.<br/>
To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)<br/>
Acted upon the living as on wire,<br/>
And led them back into the heaviest fire.

</p>
<p>
Egad! they found the second time what they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time thought quite terrible enough<br/>
To fly from, malgre all which people say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glory, and all that immortal stuff<br/>
Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)&mdash;<br/>
They found on their return the self-same welcome,<br/>
Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.

</p>
<p>
They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,<br/>
Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As any other boon for which men stickle.<br/>
The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle<br/>
Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd<br/>
Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.

</p>
<p>
The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,<br/>
And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels<br/>
Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,<br/>
That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,<br/>
Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.

</p>
<p>
First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came mounting quickly up, for it was now<br/>
All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,<br/>
So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentlemen that were the first to show<br/>
Their martial faces on the parapet,<br/>
Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.

</p>
<p>
But those who scaled, found out that their advance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:<br/>
The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder<br/>
To see in forts of Netherlands or France<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)&mdash;<br/>
Right in the middle of the parapet<br/>
Just named, these palisades were primly set:

</p>
<p>
So that on either side some nine or ten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Paces were left, whereon you could contrive<br/>
To march; a great convenience to our men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least to all those who were left alive,<br/>
Who thus could form a line and fight again;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that which farther aided them to strive<br/>
Was, that they could kick down the palisades,<br/>
Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.

</p>
<p>
Among the first,<br/>
&mdash;I will not say the first,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For such precedence upon such occasions<br/>
Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out between friends as well as allied nations:<br/>
The Briton must be bold who really durst<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,<br/>
As say that Wellington at Waterloo<br/>
Was beaten&mdash;though the Prussians say so too;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'<br/>
Had not come up in time to cast an awe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hearts of those who fought till now<br/>
As tigers combat with an empty craw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show<br/>
His orders, also to receive his pensions,<br/>
Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.

</p>
<p>
But never mind;&mdash;'God save the king!' and kings!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer&mdash;<br/>
I think I hear a little bird, who sings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The people by and by will be the stronger:<br/>
The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much into the raw as quite to wrong her<br/>
Beyond the rules of posting,&mdash;and the mob<br/>
At last fall sick of imitating Job.

</p>
<p>
At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;<br/>
At last it takes to weapons such as men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.<br/>
Then comes 'the tug of war;'&mdash;'t will come again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'<br/>
If I had not perceived that revolution<br/>
Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.

</p>
<p>
But to continue:<br/>
&mdash;I say not the first,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But of the first, our little friend Don Juan<br/>
Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst such scenes&mdash;though this was quite a new one<br/>
To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,<br/>
Pervaded him&mdash;although a generous creature,<br/>
As warm in heart as feminine in feature.

</p>
<p>
And here he was&mdash;who upon woman's breast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er<br/>
The man in all the rest might be confest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To him it was Elysium to be there;<br/>
And he could even withstand that awkward test<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,<br/>
'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'<br/>
But Juan never left them, while they had charms,

</p>
<p>
Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or near relations, who are much the same.<br/>
But here he was!&mdash;where each tie that can bind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity must yield to steel and flame:<br/>
And he whose very body was all mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame<br/>
The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,<br/>
Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.

</p>
<p>
So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,<br/>
Or double post and rail, where the existence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,<br/>
The lightest being the safest: at a distance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hated cruelty, as all men hate<br/>
Blood, until heated&mdash;and even then his own<br/>
At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.

</p>
<p>
The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing arrive an aid so opportune<br/>
As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,<br/>
To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,<br/>
Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'<br/>
(As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.

</p>
<p>
Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As much of German as of Sanscrit, and<br/>
In answer made an inclination to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The general who held him in command;<br/>
For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,<br/>
Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,<br/>
He recognised an officer of rank.

</p>
<p>
Short speeches pass between two men who speak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No common language; and besides, in time<br/>
Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime<br/>
Is perpetrated ere a word can break<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime<br/>
In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,<br/>
There cannot be much conversation there.

</p>
<p>
And therefore all we have related in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;<br/>
But in the same small minute, every sin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrived to get itself comprised within it.<br/>
The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,<br/>
As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise<br/>
Of human nature's agonising voice!

</p>
<p>
The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'God made the country and man made the town,'<br/>
So Cowper says&mdash;and I begin to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his opinion, when I see cast down<br/>
Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All walls men know, and many never known;<br/>
And pondering on the present and the past,<br/>
To deem the woods shall be our home at last

</p>
<p>
Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who passes for in life and death most lucky,<br/>
Of the great names which in our faces stare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,<br/>
Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he<br/>
Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days<br/>
Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.

</p>
<p>
Crime came not near him&mdash;she is not the child<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of solitude; Health shrank not from him&mdash;for<br/>
Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where if men seek her not, and death be more<br/>
Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By habit to what their own hearts abhor&mdash;<br/>
In cities caged. The present case in point I<br/>
Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;

</p>
<p>
And what 's still stranger, left behind a name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For which men vainly decimate the throng,<br/>
Not only famous, but of that good fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without which glory 's but a tavern song&mdash;<br/>
Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;<br/>
An active hermit, even in age the child<br/>
Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.

</p>
<p>
'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they built up unto his darling trees,&mdash;<br/>
He moved some hundred miles off, for a station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there were fewer houses and more ease;<br/>
The inconvenience of civilisation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;<br/>
But where he met the individual man,<br/>
He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.

</p>
<p>
He was not all alone: around him grew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,<br/>
Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace<br/>
On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A frown on Nature's or on human face;<br/>
The free-born forest found and kept them free,<br/>
And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.

</p>
<p>
And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,<br/>
Because their thoughts had never been the prey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;<br/>
No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No fashion made them apes of her distortions;<br/>
Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,<br/>
Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.

</p>
<p>
Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;<br/>
Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;<br/>
The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the free foresters divide no spoil;<br/>
Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes<br/>
Of this unsighing people of the woods.

</p>
<p>
So much for Nature:&mdash;by way of variety,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!<br/>
And the sweet consequence of large society,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,<br/>
The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,<br/>
The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,<br/>
With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.

</p>
<p>
The town was enter'd: first one column made<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sanguinary way good&mdash;then another;<br/>
The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother<br/>
With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother<br/>
The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot<br/>
The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.

</p>
<p>
Koutousow, he who afterward beat back<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(With some assistance from the frost and snow)<br/>
Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It happen'd was himself beat back just now;<br/>
He was a jolly fellow, and could crack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His jest alike in face of friend or foe,<br/>
Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;<br/>
But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:

</p>
<p>
For having thrown himself into a ditch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,<br/>
Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He climb'd to where the parapet appears;<br/>
But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's<br/>
Was much regretted), for the Moslem men<br/>
Threw them all down into the ditch again.

</p>
<p>
And had it not been for some stray troops landing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew not where, being carried by the stream<br/>
To some spot, where they lost their understanding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wander'd up and down as in a dream,<br/>
Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That which a portal to their eyes did seem,&mdash;<br/>
The great and gay Koutousow might have lain<br/>
Where three parts of his column yet remain.

</p>
<p>
And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'<br/>
Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,<br/>
Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,<br/>
Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,<br/>
Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.

</p>
<p>
The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I don't much pique myself upon orthography,<br/>
So that I do not grossly err in facts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)&mdash;<br/>
Having been used to serve on horses' backs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no great dilettanti in topography<br/>
Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases<br/>
Their chiefs to order,&mdash;were all cut to pieces.

</p>
<p>
Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,<br/>
And naturally thought they could have plunder'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The city, without being farther hamper'd;<br/>
But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,<br/>
Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,<br/>
From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.

</p>
<p>
Then being taken by the tail&mdash;a taking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatal to bishops as to soldiers&mdash;these<br/>
Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And found their lives were let at a short lease&mdash;<br/>
But perish'd without shivering or shaking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,<br/>
O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi<br/>
March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But could not eat them, being in his turn<br/>
Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without resistance, see their city burn.<br/>
The walls were won, but 't was an even bet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:<br/>
'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,<br/>
For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.

</p>
<p>
Another column also suffer'd much:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here we may remark with the historian,<br/>
You should but give few cartridges to such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:<br/>
When matters must be carried by the touch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,<br/>
They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,<br/>
Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.

</p>
<p>
A junction of the General Meknop's men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Without the General, who had fallen some time<br/>
Before, being badly seconded just then)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was made at length with those who dared to climb<br/>
The death-disgorging rampart once again;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,<br/>
They took the bastion, which the Seraskier<br/>
Defended at a price extremely dear.

</p>
<p>
Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,<br/>
A word which little suits with Seraskiers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.<br/>
He died, deserving well his country's tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A savage sort of military martyr.<br/>
An English naval officer, who wish'd<br/>
To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:

</p>
<p>
For all the answer to his proposition<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;<br/>
On which the rest, without more intermission,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to lay about with steel and lead&mdash;<br/>
The pious metals most in requisition<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On such occasions: not a single head<br/>
Was spared;&mdash;three thousand Moslems perish'd here,<br/>
And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.

</p>
<p>
The city 's taken&mdash;only part by part&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street<br/>
Where fights not to the last some desperate heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.<br/>
Here War forgot his own destructive art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In more destroying Nature; and the heat<br/>
Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,<br/>
Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.

</p>
<p>
A Russian officer, in martial tread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel<br/>
Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:<br/>
In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal&mdash;<br/>
The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,<br/>
As do the subtle snakes described of old.

</p>
<p>
A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit<br/>
The very tendon which is most acute<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(That which some ancient Muse or modern wit<br/>
Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it<br/>
Even with his life&mdash;for (but they lie) 't is said<br/>
To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.

</p>
<p>
However this may be, 't is pretty sure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russian officer for life was lamed,<br/>
For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:<br/>
The regimental surgeon could not cure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed<br/>
More than the head of the inveterate foe,<br/>
Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.

</p>
<p>
But then the fact 's a fact&mdash;and 't is the part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a true poet to escape from fiction<br/>
Whene'er he can; for there is little art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaving verse more free from the restriction<br/>
Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For what is sometimes called poetic diction,<br/>
And that outrageous appetite for lies<br/>
Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.

</p>
<p>
The city 's taken, but not render'd!<br/>
&mdash;No!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:<br/>
The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word<br/>
Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain the yell of victory is roar'd<br/>
By the advancing Muscovite&mdash;the groan<br/>
Of the last foe is echoed by his own.

</p>
<p>
The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,<br/>
As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,<br/>
And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;<br/>
But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,<br/>
As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.

</p>
<p>
It is an awful topic&mdash;but 't is not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My cue for any time to be terrific:<br/>
For checker'd as is seen our human lot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific<br/>
Of melancholy merriment, to quote<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much of one sort would be soporific;&mdash;<br/>
Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,<br/>
I sketch your world exactly as it goes.

</p>
<p>
And one good action in the midst of crimes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase<br/>
Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,<br/>
And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little scorch'd at present with the blaze<br/>
Of conquest and its consequences, which<br/>
Make epic poesy so rare and rich.

</p>
<p>
Upon a taken bastion, where there lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group<br/>
Of murder'd women, who had found their way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop<br/>
And shudder;&mdash;while, as beautiful as May,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A female child of ten years tried to stoop<br/>
And hide her little palpitating breast<br/>
Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.

</p>
<p>
Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,<br/>
The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,&mdash;<br/>
The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whom for this at last must we condemn?<br/>
Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ<br/>
All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?

</p>
<p>
Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,<br/>
Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,<br/>
I shall not say exactly what he said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'<br/>
But what he did, was to lay on their backs,<br/>
The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.

</p>
<p>
One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drove them with their brutal yells to seek<br/>
If there might be chirurgeons who could solder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds they richly merited, and shriek<br/>
Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,<br/>
Don Juan raised his little captive from<br/>
The heap a moment more had made her tomb.

</p>
<p>
And she was chill as they, and on her face<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender streak of blood announced how near<br/>
Her fate had been to that of all her race;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same blow which laid her mother here<br/>
Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the last link with all she had held dear;<br/>
But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,<br/>
And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.

</p>
<p>
Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon each other, with dilated glance,<br/>
In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy to save, and dread of some mischance<br/>
Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,<br/>
A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,<br/>
Like to a lighted alabaster vase;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Up came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace<br/>
On great occasions, such as an attack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On cities, as hath been the present case):<br/>
Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaiming;&mdash;'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace<br/>
Your arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar<br/>
That you and I will win St. George's collar.

</p>
<p>
'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the stone bastion still remains, wherein<br/>
The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din<br/>
Of our artillery and his own: 't is said<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,<br/>
Lie round the battery; but still it batters,<br/>
And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.

</p>
<p>
'Then up with me!'<br/>
&mdash;But Juan answer'd, 'Look<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon this child<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I saved her&mdash;must not leave<br/>
Her life to chance; but point me out some nook<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,<br/>
And I am with you.'<br/>
&mdash;Whereon Johnson took<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A glance around&mdash;and shrugg'd&mdash;and twitch'd his sleeve<br/>
And black silk neckcloth&mdash;and replied, 'You 're right;<br/>
Poor thing! what 's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'

</p>
<p>
Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure<br/>
Of present life a good deal more than we.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;<br/>
But at the least you may die gloriously.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan replied: 'At least I will endure<br/>
Whate'er is to be borne&mdash;but not resign<br/>
This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'

</p>
<p>
Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The child 's a pretty child&mdash;a very pretty&mdash;<br/>
I never saw such eyes&mdash;but hark! now choose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;&mdash;<br/>
Hark! how the roar increases!&mdash;no excuse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will serve when there is plunder in a city;&mdash;<br/>
I should be loth to march without you, but,<br/>
By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'

</p>
<p>
But Juan was immovable; until<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson, who really loved him in his way,<br/>
Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as he thought the least given up to prey;<br/>
And swearing if the infant came to ill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That they should all be shot on the next day;<br/>
But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,<br/>
They should at least have fifty rubles round,

</p>
<p>
And all allowances besides of plunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fair proportion with their comrades;&mdash;then<br/>
Juan consented to march on through thunder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:<br/>
And yet the rest rush'd eagerly&mdash;no wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For they were heated by the hope of gain,<br/>
A thing which happens everywhere each day&mdash;<br/>
No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.

</p>
<p>
And such is victory, and such is man!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least nine tenths of what we call so;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;God<br/>
May have another name for half we scan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As human beings, or his ways are odd.<br/>
But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod<br/>
In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call<br/>
This chieftain&mdash;somehow would not yield at all:

</p>
<p>
But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That she spawns warriors by the score, where none<br/>
Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He never would believe the city won<br/>
While courage clung but to a single twig.<br/>
&mdash;Am I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?<br/>
Neither&mdash;but a good, plain, old, temperate man,<br/>
Who fought with his five children in the van.

</p>
<p>
To take him was the point. The truly brave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,<br/>
Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mixture of wild beasts and demigods<br/>
Are they&mdash;now furious as the sweeping wave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods<br/>
The rugged tree unto the summer wind,<br/>
Compassion breathes along the savage mind.

</p>
<p>
But he would not be taken, and replied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the propositions of surrender<br/>
By mowing Christians down on every side,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.<br/>
His five brave boys no less the foe defied;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,<br/>
As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,<br/>
Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.

</p>
<p>
And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Expended all their Eastern phraseology<br/>
In begging him, for God's sake, just to show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much less fight as might form an apology<br/>
For them in saving such a desperate foe&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hew'd away, like doctors of theology<br/>
When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses<br/>
Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.

</p>
<p>
Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,<br/>
The first with sighs, the second with an oath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,<br/>
And all around were grown exceeding wroth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a pertinacious infidel,<br/>
And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,<br/>
Which they resisted like a sandy plain

</p>
<p>
That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His second son was levell'd by a shot;<br/>
His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;<br/>
The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,<br/>
Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,<br/>
To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.

</p>
<p>
The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As great a scorner of the Nazarene<br/>
As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,<br/>
Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,<br/>
Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,<br/>
Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.

</p>
<p>
And what they pleased to do with the young khan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;<br/>
But doubtless they prefer a fine young man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To tough old heroes, and can do no less;<br/>
And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,<br/>
For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,<br/>
You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.

</p>
<p>
Your houris also have a natural pleasure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In lopping off your lately married men,<br/>
Before the bridal hours have danced their measure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad, second moon grows dim again,<br/>
Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wish him back a bachelor now and then.<br/>
And thus your houri (it may be) disputes<br/>
Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.

</p>
<p>
Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,<br/>
But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, howe'er our better faith derides,<br/>
These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though there were one heaven and none besides,&mdash;<br/>
Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven<br/>
And hell, there must at least be six or seven.

</p>
<p>
So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That when the very lance was in his heart,<br/>
He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,<br/>
And bright eternity without disguise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:&mdash;<br/>
With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried<br/>
In one voluptuous blaze,&mdash;and then he died,

</p>
<p>
But with a heavenly rapture on his face.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The good old khan, who long had ceased to see<br/>
Houris, or aught except his florid race<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who grew like cedars round him gloriously&mdash;<br/>
When he beheld his latest hero grace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,<br/>
Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast<br/>
A glance on that slain son, his first and last.

</p>
<p>
The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede<br/>
Quarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he before had done. He did not heed<br/>
Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,<br/>
As he look'd down upon his children gone,<br/>
And felt&mdash;though done with life&mdash;he was alone

</p>
<p>
But 't was a transient tremor;&mdash;with a spring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,<br/>
As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the light wherein she dies: he clung<br/>
Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;<br/>
And throwing back a dim look on his sons,<br/>
In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.

</p>
<p>
'T is strange enough&mdash;the rough, tough soldiers, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spared neither sex nor age in their career<br/>
Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay before them with his children near,<br/>
Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were melted for a moment: though no tear<br/>
Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,<br/>
They honour'd such determined scorn of life.

</p>
<p>
But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:<br/>
Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And baffled the assaults of all their host;<br/>
At length he condescended to inquire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If yet the city's rest were won or lost;<br/>
And being told the latter, sent a bey<br/>
To answer Ribas' summons to give way.

</p>
<p>
In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking<br/>
Tobacco on a little carpet;<br/>
&mdash;Troy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw nothing like the scene around:&mdash;yet looking<br/>
With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His stern philosophy; but gently stroking<br/>
His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,<br/>
As if he had three lives, as well as tails.

</p>
<p>
The town was taken&mdash;whether he might yield<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:<br/>
His stubborn valour was no future shield.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow<br/>
Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But red with no redeeming gore: the glow<br/>
Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,<br/>
Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.

</p>
<p>
All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the body perpetrates of bad;<br/>
All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that the devil would do if run stark mad;<br/>
All that defies the worst which pen expresses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All by which hell is peopled, or as sad<br/>
As hell&mdash;mere mortals who their power abuse&mdash;<br/>
Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.

</p>
<p>
If here and there some transient trait of pity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through<br/>
Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child, or an aged, helpless man or two&mdash;<br/>
What 's this in one annihilated city,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?<br/>
Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!<br/>
Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.

</p>
<p>
Think how the joys of reading a Gazette<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:<br/>
Or if these do not move you, don't forget<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.<br/>
Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.<br/>
Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,<br/>
Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.

</p>
<p>
But still there is unto a patriot nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which loves so well its country and its king,<br/>
A subject of sublimest exultation&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!<br/>
Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,<br/>
Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne&mdash;<br/>
Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.

</p>
<p>
But let me put an end unto my theme:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an end of Ismail&mdash;hapless town!<br/>
Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And redly ran his blushing waters down.<br/>
The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:<br/>
Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,<br/>
Some hundreds breathed&mdash;the rest were silent all!

</p>
<p>
In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russian army upon this occasion,<br/>
A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore worthy of commemoration:<br/>
The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station<br/>
In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,<br/>
Had made them chaste;&mdash;they ravish'd very little.

</p>
<p>
Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might here and there occur some violation<br/>
In the other line;&mdash;but not to such excess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the French, that dissipated nation,<br/>
Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except cold weather and commiseration;<br/>
But all the ladies, save some twenty score,<br/>
Were almost as much virgins as before.

</p>
<p>
Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste&mdash;<br/>
Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their friends from foes,&mdash;besides such things from haste<br/>
Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of light to save the venerably chaste:<br/>
But six old damsels, each of seventy years,<br/>
Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.

</p>
<p>
But on the whole their continence was great;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that some disappointment there ensued<br/>
To those who had felt the inconvenient state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good<br/>
(Since it was not their fault, but only fate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bear these crosses) for each waning prude<br/>
To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,<br/>
Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.

</p>
<p>
Some voices of the buxom middle-aged<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were also heard to wonder in the din<br/>
(Widows of forty were these birds long caged)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'<br/>
But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was small leisure for superfluous sin;<br/>
But whether they escaped or no, lies hid<br/>
In darkness<br/>
&mdash;I can only hope they did.

</p>
<p>
Suwarrow now was conqueror&mdash;a match<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.<br/>
While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,<br/>
With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here exactly follows what he said:&mdash;<br/>
'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers<br/>
Eternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail 's ours.'

</p>
<p>
Methinks these are the most tremendous words,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'<br/>
Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:<br/>
What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on<br/>
The fate of nations;&mdash;but this Russ so witty<br/>
Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.

</p>
<p>
He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,<br/>
Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I will teach, if possible, the stones<br/>
To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;&mdash;<br/>
But ye&mdash;our children's children! think how we<br/>
Show'd what things were before the world was free!

</p>
<p>
That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as, in the great joy of your millennium,<br/>
You hardly will believe such things were true<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;<br/>
But may their very memory perish too!-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em<br/>
More than you scorn the savages of yore,<br/>
Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.

</p>
<p>
And when you hear historians talk of thrones,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And those that sate upon them, let it be<br/>
As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'And wonder what old world such things could see,<br/>
Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant riddles of futurity&mdash;<br/>
Guessing at what shall happily be hid,<br/>
As the real purpose of a pyramid.

</p>
<p>
Reader! I have kept my word,&mdash;at least so far<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first Canto promised. You have now<br/>
Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All very accurate, you must allow,<br/>
And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have drawn much less with a long bow<br/>
Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,<br/>
But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,

</p>
<p>
With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What farther hath befallen or may befall<br/>
The hero of this grand poetic riddle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I by and by may tell you, if at all:<br/>
But now I choose to break off in the middle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,<br/>
While Juan is sent off with the despatch,<br/>
For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.

</p>
<p>
This special honour was conferr'd, because<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had behaved with courage and humanity&mdash;<br/>
Which last men like, when they have time to pause<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From their ferocities produced by vanity.<br/>
His little captive gain'd him some applause<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For saving her amidst the wild insanity<br/>
Of carnage,&mdash;and I think he was more glad in her<br/>
Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.

</p>
<p>
The Moslem orphan went with her protector,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all<br/>
Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:<br/>
Her very place of birth was but a spectre<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal<br/>
To prayer was heard no more!&mdash;and Juan wept,<br/>
And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.
