<p>The rancher was astonished beyond measure at the success of his
shot. He had looked for nothing of the kind, but there could be
no mistake as to the result; there was nothing to be gained by
any pretence on the part of the Sioux. He certainly was as dead
as dead could be.</p>

<p>How he longed, like a certain famous general, for the coming
of night! A little more darkness and he would flee with his wife
and child under its friendly cover, and place a safe distance
between them and their enemies, before the latter could learn
of their flight.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed without a demonstration on either side,
but while matters stood thus, a new danger presented itself to
the rancher. Why should the Sioux stay where they were? What was
to prevent them moving farther up or down the bank, under the
screen it afforded, and crossing unobserved? The winding course
of the current gave every chance of doing this, and surely they
were not likely to forget such an obvious course.</p>

<p>The thought had hardly presented itself to the watcher when that
very thing was attempted. The one who essayed it, however, forgot
the caution he should have remembered.</p>

<p>The slowly settling night and the falling snow may have misled
him, but when the warrior rode his pony into the stream at a point
considerably above, Starr observed him at the moment he began
descending the bank.</p>

<p>This was something that must be nipped in the bud. He shifted
his position to where the grass gave slightly better protection,
and sighted with the utmost care and deliberation.</p>

<p>The shot was successful, but not precisely as he counted upon.
The bullet, instead of striking the rider, pierced the brain of
the pony, who reared frantically, plunged forward on his knees,
and rolled upon his side, the Sioux dexterously saving himself
by leaping away and scurrying behind the swell before the white
man could fire a second time.</p>

<p>"If they try it at that point, they will do so at some other,"
was the conclusion of the rancher, turning his gaze down stream.
But the current made such a sharp bend near at hand, that his
view was shortened, and the effort could be successfully made
without detection on his part.</p>

<p>An unexpected diversion occurred at this moment. The pack-horse,
that had been contentedly cropping the grass near at hand and
paying no heed to what was going on about him, wandered toward
the bank, and was in imminent peril of being shot by the vigilant
Sioux before he could be turned away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Starr called sharply to him, and her voice caused the prostrate
husband to look around. The pony at that moment was ascending
the swell, to go down on the other side to the water, where he
would have been in plain sight of the red men.</p>

<p>Fearful that words would not check him, the rancher sprang up
and, bending his head to save himself from his foes, ran the few
steps necessary to reach the animal. Catching hold of his bridle,
he jerked his head in the opposite direction, and, to teach him
prudence, delivered a vigorous kick. The startled animal headed
toward the west and broke into a gallop straight across the plain.</p>

<p>"Let him go," said the impatient owner, looking after him: "he
is too lazy to travel far, and we'll follow him soon."</p>

<p>"Why not do so now?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"I fear that they are looking for such a move, and will be across
before we can gain sufficient start."</p>

<p>"But they may do so now."</p>

<p>"Am I not watching them?" asked the husband, beginning to creep
up the swell again, but pausing before he was high enough to discern
the other side.</p>

<p>"They may cross above or below, where you cannot see them," remarked
the wife, giving utterance to the very fear that had troubled
him some minutes before.</p>

<p>"They may do so, but I have just defeated such an attempt, and
they will probably wait a while before repeating it."</p>

<p>"Then we can have no more favorable time to leave them than now."</p>

<p>"Such would be the fact, if I only knew of a surety that they
would wait a while."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are making a mistake, George."</p>

<p>"It may be, but my judgment is against what you propose. Suppose
that, at the moment of starting, they should appear on this side;
they would run us down within a few hundred yards."</p>

<p>"Are not our ponies as fleet as theirs?"</p>

<p>"Probably; but with Dot to look after, you would have more than
your hands full, and nothing could save us."</p>

<p>"I could manage her very well; but do as you think best. We can
only pray to Heaven to protect us all."</p>

<p>Looking to the westward, the rancher saw the pack-pony just vanishing
from sight in the gloom. Brief as was the time that he had left
the Sioux without watching, he felt that it had been too long,
and he now made his way up the swell until he could peer over
at the other bank, where the red men were awaiting the very chance
he gave them that moment.</p>

<p>The narrowest escape of his life followed. Providentially, his
first glance was directed at the precise spot where a crouching
Sioux made a slight movement with his rifle, which gave the white
man an instant's warning of his peril. He ducked his head, and
had he not instinctively closed his eyes, would have been blinded
by the dust and snow thrown against his face, as the leaden ball
whizzed through the air, falling on the prairie a long distance
away.</p>

<p>In its flight it passed directly over the heads of the wife and
child, who noticed the peculiar whistling sound a few feet above
them. But they were as safe from such danger as if a mile away.
The swell of the bank would not allow any missile to come nigh
enough to harm them.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," he said, with a reassuring smile, "they
can't touch you as long as they are on the other side."</p>

<p>"But how long will they stay there?" asked the wife, unable to
repress her uneasiness over the tardiness of her husband.</p>

<p>"Molly," said he, stirred by a sudden thought, "why not ride
after the pack-horse?"</p>

<p>"And leave you here?" was the astonished question.</p>

<p>"Only for a few minutes; you will gain a good start, and it won't
take me long to come up with you. I can put my pony on a run,
and we shall gain invaluable time."</p>

<p>But this was asking more than the obedient wife was willing to
grant. No possible circumstances could justify her in deserting
her husband. If he fell, she had no wish to escape.</p>

<p>Dot, who had held her peace so long, now spoke:</p>

<p>"Papa, don't ask us to leave you, 'cause we don't want to. I
asked mamma to let me go to you, but she says no."</p>

<p>Tears filled the eyes of the father, and his voice trembled as
he said:</p>

<p>"Very well, little one; stay with your mamma, and when the time
comes for us to start we will go together."</p>

<p>"But why don't you go now?" persisted the child, taking her cue,
perhaps, from the words her mother had spoken.</p>

<p>"I will not keep you waiting long," he assured her, more affected
by the question of the child than by the arguments of her mother.</p>

<p>Shifting the point of observation, the rancher raised his head
just enough, cautiously parting the grass in front, to permit
him to see the other bank, becoming more dimly visible in the
falling snow and gathering gloom.</p>

<p>He scanned the points whence had come the shots, but could discover
nothing of his enemies. They might be there, but if so they were
invisible, as could readily be the case; but, somehow or other,
the conviction grew upon him that they were moving, and that to
postpone his departure longer was to invite the worst fate imaginable
for himself and dear ones.</p>

<p>"We cannot leave too soon," he exclaimed, hastening to carry
out the purpose that never ought to have been delayed so long.</p>
