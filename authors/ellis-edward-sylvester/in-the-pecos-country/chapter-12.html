<p>The experience of Fred Munson as a prisoner among the Apaches
was one which he was not likely to forget to his dying day. From
the back of the steed where he was held a captive he gained an
indistinct view of the short, savage struggle between Lone Wolf
and Sut Simpson, and more than once he concluded that it was all
over with the daring hunter, who had ventured out with the purpose
of befriending him. But when the chieftain returned to his warriors
alone and without any scalp strung to his girdle, he knew that
the fellow had pulled through all right.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf was so exasperated at his treatment that he hovered
around for a short time with his entire force, in the hope of
balancing accounts with his old enemy. But he soon saw, however,
the utter impossibility of that in the present shape of things,
and so he summoned all his warriors together and moved off in
a northerly direction, his purpose being, as the hunter said,
to return with a force which would prove itself invincible.</p>

<p>Fred expected to be handed back to the redoubtable chieftain,
who, he supposed, would subject him to the most cruel kind of
treatment; but that worthy did not seem desirous of receiving
his charge back again and permitted him to remain with his deputy.
The lad did not know whether to be pleased by this or not; for
his custodian was the most repulsive looking being he had ever
seen. He was deeply pitted with smallpox, and the enormous nose
which he had once possessed had been splintered by a blow from
a tomahawk, so that in no respect at all did it resemble that
useful and ornamental organ. There was an enormous breadth, too,
between the eyes, or rather temples, the face tapering down to
the chin so rapidly that the contour from the front suggested
the shape of a wedge.</p>

<p>An Indian almost invariably has good teeth but the mouth of the
one in question was filled with snags that projected in every
direction; his chin was excessively retreating, and, to add to
it all, his countenance was daubed with different colored paint,
in such fantastic streakings that an Adonis himself would have
appeared hideous. Such was the jailer of Fred, who heard him addressed
once or twice by a name which sounded to him as if it were Waukko.</p>

<p>He was, in fact, one of the most famous warriors of the Jiccarilla
Apaches, his fame depending as much upon his cruelty as upon his
prowess. There are legends in the southwest crediting Lone Wolf
with having shown some slight signs of mercy on one or two occasions,
but nothing of the kind was ever said of his lieutenant, Waukko,
who brained the innocent babe with the same demon-like enjoyment
that he silenced the pleadings of old age and blooming womanhood.
Fred, as a matter of course, knew nothing of these characteristics;
but the appearance of the redskin himself was so repulsive that
he could not look at him without a shudder of terror.</p>

<p>The lad sat on the blanket directly in front of Waukko, who held
him in place by passing his arm about him. Such was his position
when the entire company headed northward, and struck into a sweeping
gallop.</p>

<p>It was comparatively early in the evening when the start was
made, and the flight was continued without interruption through
the night, the horses scarcely ever varying from that same everlasting
canter.</p>

<p>The novelty of his situation, and the interest which Fred felt
as to what was to be done with him in the end kept him wide awake
for a time, and he indulged in all sorts of surmises and conjectures.
Without brother or sister, and with only one parent, his father,
to whom he was deeply attached, his greatest suffering was the
thought of the sorrow that would be his father's when he should
come to know the dreadful fate of his only son.</p>

<p>Such were his thoughts when he had no hope of ever seeing him
again; but when he reflected that Mickey O'Rooney was still absent
from the settlement, and that Sut Simpson was likely to take up
the hunt, a strong hope arose within his breast and encouraged
him to believe that he might escape from the Apaches.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I only had my handsome Hurricane here!" he murmured,
as he recalled the figure of his sinewy and symmetrical steed.
"Once on his back and with a clear field before me, all the Indians
in the Southwest could n't catch me. If the hunter would only
think to bring him along, it would help a good deal, but I don't
suppose he will."</p>

<p>Then his thoughts wandered away to his father, and the tears
came to his eyes and the sorrow lurked deep in his heart, nourished
by the thought that very likely they would never meet again, and
his father's lonely heart would be sorrowful all the rest of his
life as he thought of how his only child had been murdered by
the Apaches.</p>

<p>The steady sinking and rising of the Indian's horse gradually
became monotonous, and, after a time, the boy's nodding head drooped,
and Waukko knew, from the pressure against his breast, that his
captive was asleep. Could he have had his way, he would have strangled
the life out of him as he lay thus unconscious, but he was carrying
him for Lone Wolf, the chief, and he dare not disobey him.</p>

<p>It is not often that the sleeper rests his head upon the bosom
of his enemy, yet such was the case in the present instance. The
swaying, rocking motion of the bed of Fred Munson not only lulled
him to sleep, but retained him in as sweet and dreamless slumber
as though he were resting upon his bed at home, where no thought
of the treacherous Indian ever entered his head.</p>

<p>The red-skin sat his steed like a statue. Lone Wolf had entrusted
the young captive to his charge, and he would hold him responsible
for his safe deliverance, that was all. He might have slept for
twenty-four hours, using his scarred and evil chest as a pillow,
without protest from him.</p>

<p>When at last Fred opened his eyes, it was several minutes before
he recalled his situation. It was just beginning to grow light,
and when he saw the figures of horses with their riders he remembered
the scene of the night before. When he turned his head and saw
the horrid face of Waukko, no doubt then remained of where he
was. But he looked upon a far different scene from that upon which
he had closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Instead of being upon the broad, sweeping prairie, he was among
the mountains. They towered upon every hand, and the war party
had halted in a sort of canon or valley, where they seemed shut
out from the outer world.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Fred, thinking it polite to open a conversation
with his guardian, with a view of conciliating him; but the red-skin
did not seem to be in a mood for conversation, or it may be that
he did not possess a very profound knowledge of the English tongue,
for he made no reply.</p>

<p>After a time, the lad ventured upon another modest remark, but
receiving no attention, he concluded it hardly worth his while
to attempt to work any further in that direction, and he gave
over the effort.</p>

<p>As soon as the halt was made, Lone Wolf gave a sort of address
to his warriors, which Fred believed to be a sort of harangue,
intended to incite them to deeds of greater daring than any they
had as yet shown. The red-skins became much excited, and answered
his appeals with angry shouts, grunts and gestures. No doubt,
had he chosen to lead them, they would have rushed back to a second
attack upon New Boston, without the addition of another warrior
to their number. The oratory of Lone Wolf was not very graceful,
but it was very effective. He knew how to appeal to his followers
in a way that went directly to their hearts.</p>
