<p>"Peace, come here, I want to talk with you," called Mr. Hartman,
leaning over the fence and beckoning to the child at work in her
melon patch, measuring the mottled green fruit thickly dotted
through the vines.</p>

<p>"It's grown two inches since I measured it last," said the brown-eyed
gardener to herself, leaving her task to see what the man wanted.
"Here I am."</p>

<p>"Do you know what kind of a mess you have got me into now?"</p>

<p>Peace looked her surprise, and answered saucily, "You don't fool
me any more, my friend. You've teased me so often that it is an
old story now. I know just what to 'xpect when I meet you."</p>

<p>At any other time he would have been delighted with this reply,
but under the circumstances&mdash;for he was really much disturbed
over her latest prank&mdash;her jaunty, don't-care air nettled him,
and he said sharply, "<em>This</em> is no joking matter, Miss
Greenfield, I can tell you that! Why did you tie red rags all
over my pasture fence?"</p>

<p>"So's to keep the deacon's bull busy. We couldn't get those berries
any other way."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you succeeded. He broke one horn off and pretty
near skinned himself, I judge. The only wonder is that he didn't
tear the fence down and get loose."</p>

<p>"As long as he didn't, I shouldn't care about his horns," answered
Peace with provoking indifference. "The deacon said I could have
all the berries I could get, and he didn't say how I was to get
them, either. I thought and thought, and I couldn't see any way
out but the red flags. It worked beau&mdash;ti&mdash;fully. We got two buckets
chock-full!"</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned Mr. Hartman; "and got old Skinner red hot at me!
I signed a note a year or two ago for a friend of mine, expecting
by this time that he would be on his feet and able to take care
of it, but he isn't, and I've got to settle. Where the money is
coming from is more than I can tell. It took all my ready cash
to build that new barn, and old Skinner is so blamed mad that
he won't give me any more time. And all this fuss on account of
those berries. Plague take the old bushes, and you, too, you little
rascal!"</p>

<p>Peace drew herself up haughtily and with eyes flashing fire,
demanded, "Do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Every word. I'd just like the chance to give you a good trouncing."</p>

<p>He was not in earnest, but he looked so harsh and stern that
Peace for a moment trembled in her shoes. Then all her natural
childish passion was aroused, and stamping her foot, she declared
wrathfully, "I'll not be friends with you any longer. You said
I could have the berries, and the deacon said I could have all
I could get. You aren't being square with me, and I won't have
anything more to do with you." She turned on her heel and flung
herself indignantly across the garden to the road, leaving Mr.
Hartman still leaning against the fence, lost in thought.</p>

<p>The forest was her favorite retreat in times of trouble, but
today the cool shadows and whispering trees did not soothe her,
and after wandering about until the afternoon began to wane, she
started for home, still wrathful and passionate, for she felt
that Mr. Hartman had been very unfair in his treatment of her.</p>

<p>While she was still some distance from the little brown house,
a carriage drove up to their gate, and stopped, but she did not
recognize the rig, nor could she make out who had alighted; and
for the time being, her rage was lost in her greater curiosity.
"Wonder who it can be," she said to herself. "It isn't the doctor's
horse, nor the Judge's buggy, and that woman is too little for
Mrs. Lacy or Mrs. Edwards. She's got a big bundle. Maybe it's
the Salvation Army bringing us some old duds like they did the
German family last week. But s'posing it was some rich aunt or
grandmother we didn't know we had. It's awfully hard not to have
any relations like other folks. I am going through old Cross-Patch's
cornfield, 'stead of running clear around by the road."</p>

<p>She crawled between the strands of barbed wire and ran swiftly
down the rows of rustling, whispering, silken corn, thinking only
of the unexpected visitors at home, until a big barn loomed up
before her, shining in its newness. Then she stopped abruptly,
having suddenly remembered her grievance.</p>

<p>"He <em>isn't</em> square!" she cried. "I'd like to fight him
good. I'll get even with you some day, Mr. Hardman! Bet he's going
to paint his old barn. Here is a whole ocean of red paint in this
pail, and there is a stack of brushes. I &mdash;I'm going&mdash;to
tell&mdash;him what I think of him in red paint. Yes, sir, I'm going
to do it this very minute!"</p>

<p>All thought of the mysterious visitor at home had vanished, all
thought of the consequences were stifled, and choosing the smallest
brush in the heap beside the pail, she began daubing scrawly,
tipsy letters across the new, white boards: <em>Mister Hardman
isnt square</em>.</p>

<p>"There!" she breathed, as the last straggling "r" was finished.
"I'll bet that makes him mad, but maybe next time he won't blame
me for his old fusses. He <em>said</em> I could have those raspberries."</p>

<p>She dipped the brush into the paint once more, made a few little
red spots below the printed letters, and labelled them <em>raspberries</em>
for fear they might not otherwise be recognized. Then dropping
the brush back where she had found it, she skipped off home, feeling
an uncomfortable sense of guilt and shame in her heart for having
wreaked her revenge in such a manner.</p>

<p>At the gate Allee met her, shouting, "Mrs. Strong is here with
the baby, and she's going to stay for supper. Elva Munson brought
her in their new buggy. Come see Glen. We've hunted all over for
you, and even blew the horn."</p>

<p>The excited child danced up the path, and Peace followed, forgetting
her mean prank in her pleasure at seeing her beloved friends.
Nor did she remember any more about it until the next morning,
when, seated on the shed-roof, under the overhanging boughs of
a great elm, she saw Mr. Hartman striding angrily up the path
to the kitchen door. Then her heart gave a great thump and seemed
to sink clear to her toes, as she thought of her miserable method
of getting even. Her passion had subsided during the night, and
try as she would, she could now think of no justifiable excuse
for her mean act.</p>

<p>Gail answered the imperative knock, and Peace heard him demand
wrathfully, "Where is Peace?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere around the place. She was under the maple there at
the corner a few moments ago. Is something wrong? Has she been
annoying you again?"</p>

<p>"Annoying me? She has daubed letters all over the back of my
new barn. I shall have to paint the whole building now, and it
isn't very funny business. If I had got hold of her when I first
saw her work, I'd have given her a thrashing she wouldn't have
forgotten in one while. You will whip that child like she deserves,
or pay for the damage she has done,&mdash;one or the other, and I mean
it, too!" Without waiting for her reply, he started down the path
again, leaving Gail white-faced and distressed in the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight Peace slid from her perch to the
ground below, deserting the corncob doll she had been dressing,
and scurried away to the barn loft to face the new and undreamed-of
situation. A licking or pay for the damage done! Why had she been
so thoughtless and mean? She might have known that Gail would
be the one to suffer. She hated herself, as she always did after
her mischievous pranks, but that didn't help matters any. She
must take her medicine. There was no money to settle for her wanton
mischief; it would have to be the licking.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether she'll use a shingle or her shoe," she thought
nervously, making ready to descend and brave Gail's displeasure,
when Cherry's head appeared on the ladder, and the older girl
announced excitedly, "Now you've done it, Peace Greenfield! Mr.
Hartman is as mad as a hornet about your painting his barn, and
he says Gail must either whip you hard, or pay for it. There isn't
any money to pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I s'pose I'll have to take the licking," answered Peace
with a great show of indifference, though the pounding of her
heart nearly stifled her.</p>

<p>"But Gail says she can't lick you, and even Faith has backed
out, though at first she said she would give it to you good."</p>

<p>Here was an unlooked-for state of affairs&mdash;no money, and no one
willing to use the rod, though she undoubtedly deserved it.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked Cherry curiously.</p>

<p>"Lick myself likely," retorted Peace sarcastically. "You better
lug those eggs up to the doctor's. I've d'livered my bunch."</p>

<p>Cherry vanished as quickly as she had come, and as the sound
of her footsteps died away in the distance, Peace slid down the
ladder. But instead of going to the house for an interview with
Gail, she slipped through the garden, crawled under the fence,
and presented herself at the door of the new barn where Mr. Hartman,
still in a blaze of anger, was at work.</p>

<p>"What do you want here, you tormented rascal?" he yelled in fury,
shaking a hazel switch threateningly at her.</p>

<p>"I came to get licked," she answered steadily, though quaking
inwardly.</p>

<p>"Wh-at?" he gasped in unbelieving amazement.</p>

<p>"I heard what you said to Gail about paying or licking me, and
she hasn't got any money to pay for my meanness, and she says&mdash;she
says she can't whip me; so I've come to you for it."</p>

<p>She really did not expect him to punish her in that manner, for
ordinarily he was not a hard-hearted man; but in view of Peace's
misdemeanor, Gail's hesitation angered him only the more, and
catching the child by her shoulder, he gave her a dozen sharp,
stinging lashes with his switch, then released her, thoroughly
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>He expected her to cry and scream, but she bit her lips, blinked
her brown eyes rapidly to keep the tears back, and stood like
a statue until he dropped his stick. Then choking back the sobs
in her throat, she faced him with the curt demand, "Give me a
receipt, please."</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a what?"</p>

<p>"A receipt. Gail says we should never settle a bill without getting
a receipt."</p>

<p>"What do you want of a receipt?"</p>

<p>"So's I can show Gail that this bill is settled."</p>

<p>"Aha!" he mocked. "You are afraid Gail will repent and give you
another thrashing, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not! But I want to be sure you don't try to c'llect
twice."</p>

<p>He stared at her open-mouthed, too hurt for words; and she, unaware
that she had deeply offended him, urged impatiently, as she rubbed
her smarting shoulders, "Hurry up! Write it on a piece of paper,
so's I can have it to keep always. Haven't you got any in your
pocket?"</p>

<p>Mechanically he searched his pockets, drew forth a scrap of an
envelope, wrote the receipt she demanded, and handed it to her
gravely. She accepted it as gravely, spelled it through, and turned
to go, saying piously, "Thank you, Mr. Hardman. I hope you will
get your reward in heaven." She meant this in all reverence, thinking
only of the receipt he had given her, but he thought she was sarcastically
referring to the whipping she had suffered at his hands; and with
a queer tightening of his throat, he returned to his work, while
she hurried homeward with her precious bit of paper.</p>

<p>"Here is Mr. Hardman's receipt, Gail," she announced, briefly,
entering the kitchen where the two older girls were still discussing
the new problem.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the money!" asked Faith severely.</p>

<p>"I took the licking," was the short answer.</p>

<p>"Took the licking! From whom!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hardman."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Mr. Hardman whipped you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I went over and told him to."</p>

<p>"Did it hurt?" whispered Allee, with eyes brimming full of sympathy.</p>

<p>"It might have been worse, s'posing he had used a piece of iron
instead of a stick."</p>

<p>Profound silence reigned in the little room. Then Gail said abruptly,
"Come upstairs with me. I want to see you alone."</p>

<p>Peace glanced apprehensively at the pale face, which looked unusually
stern and severe, and said, "That is a sure-enough receipt, but
if you don't b'lieve it, you can ask Mr. Hardman about it."</p>

<p>"I am not doubting your story in the least," answered the big
sister, smiling in spite of herself, "but I want to talk to you,
dear."</p>

<p>When Gail said "dear," she was never angry, so, without further
hesitation, Peace followed her to the small room under the eaves,
wondering what was coming next. Gail seated herself in the rickety
chair by the window, and drawing the small girl down into her
lap, she asked, "Now what is all this trouble about? Tell sister
everything."</p>

<p>So Peace related the story of the raspberries and her anger at
their neighbor, which had led to the painting of the barn.</p>

<p>"What did you write on the building?" questioned Gail when Peace
paused at this point in her recital.</p>

<p>"Just the truth. I said, 'Mr. Hardman isn't square.' Then, so's
he would know what he wasn't square about, I made a lot of raspberries
under the printing."</p>

<p>"Peace! After Mr. Hartman has been so kind to us! What do you
think of a little girl who will do a thing like that!"</p>

<p>"At first I thought she was all right," answered the candid maiden.
"But now I've changed my mind, and I guess she was pretty bad
when she did it. Though he needn't have said what he did to me.
He told me we could have the berries."</p>

<p>"At the same time he warned you about Mr. Skinner's bull."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I warned Mr. Skinflint &mdash;I mean Mr. Skinner."</p>

<p>"Mr. Skinner is a hot-tempered man, and I am afraid if the Hartmans
owe him money, as you say, he will make it very uncomfortable
for them."</p>

<p>"Maybe I better go see old Skinflint &mdash;I mean Mr. Skinner&mdash;and
tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" cried Gail in alarm. "You have done damage enough
already. Promise me that you won't say anything to him about it,
Peace."</p>

<p>"I promise. I ain't anxious to see him anyway, only I thought
if it would do any good I would go and tell him how it happened.
I am awfully sorry now."</p>

<p>"Then don't you think you better apologize to Mr. Hartman?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't the licking a napology enough?"</p>

<p>"The whipping only settled your account. It didn't say you were
sorry. And it was wrong to tell him that you hoped he would get
his reward in heaven."</p>

<p>"Why?" cried Peace in genuine astonishment. "That's what the
lame peddler woman always tells you when you buy a paper of needles
or pins."</p>

<p>"That is different. She means what she says. The words are no
idle mockery to her. Every penny she can earn, helps her that
much, and she is truly grateful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I am truly grateful for my receipt, too! It isn't every
man that would give me one. Old Skinner now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace!"</p>

<p>"But, Gail, dear, I wasn't mocking him. I wanted him to know
that I knew how much that receipt was worth. S'posing he hadn't
written it, how would you have known that I had settled that fuss?"</p>

<p>Gail gave up in despair. She never could argue with this small
sister, who so sadly needed a mother's wisdom to keep her sweet
and good; so she abruptly ended her lecture by gently insisting,
"Mr. Hartman deserves your apology. What if he had made us pay
for the damage you did, or had had you arrested? He was good to
let you off with just a licking, Peace, even if you do think it
was hard punishment. If you are going to be a bad girl, you must
expect whippings."</p>

<p>"I don't think he likes me any more. He may chase me home before
I can apologize," suggested the unhappy culprit, with hanging
head.</p>

<p>"I guess not," smiled Gail behind her hand. "Try it and see."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed miserable Peace, "I s'pose I must, then."</p>

<p>She reluctantly descended the stairs again, and disappeared down
the path toward the Hartman house, wishing with all her heart
that the ground would swallow her up before she had to meet the
enemy. Suddenly a way out of the dilemma presented itself. She
searched hastily through her pockets for paper and pencil, and
folding both among the clutter, she wrote her apology on a ragged,
dirty scrap, and carried it to the green house, intending to leave
it on the doorstep and hurry away, but as she peered cautiously
around the corner of the shed she saw Mrs. Hartman sitting on
the porch, and retreated, murmuring, "Oh, dear, I s'pose I'll
have to say it to him after all. I <em>might</em> pin it to the
barn door, or&mdash;maybe 'twould be better if I fastened it beside
the painting. That's what I'll do!"</p>

<p>She stole away to the barn, tacked the paper to the new boards,
and was about to depart when her eyes chanced to fall upon her
sprawling decorations of the previous day; and she halted, horrified
at the glaring scarlet letters. "Mercy! How they look! No wonder
Mr. Hartman gave me such a tre&mdash;men&mdash;jous switching. The paint
is still here. I will cover it all up."</p>

<p>The big brush did the work this time, and in a brief period a
wide, brilliant stripe of red hid the uneven letters from sight.
But somehow Mr. Hartman did not think the barn had been improved
very much when he found it, and was wrathfully; setting out in
search of the artist when the fluttering paper caught his eye.</p>

<p>"She's a great one for notes," he muttered, jerking the scrawl
down, half impatiently, half amused. "What does she say this time?
Whew!" Involuntarily he whistled a long-drawn-out whistle, for
this is what Peace had written:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I ipolijize for painting your barn cause Gale says I otto and<br/>
anyway I didn't know it was going to look so bad so Ive erased the<br/>
letters with some more paint but I still feel the same way about<br/>
the raspberries. Also I hope you don't get your reward in Heaven.

</p>
<p>
Peace Greenfield.

</p>
<p>
"P.s. Gale said I should come myself and say this but I thot it was<br/>
safest to rite as long as youre still mad."
