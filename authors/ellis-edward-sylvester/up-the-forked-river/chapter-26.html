<p>The sailboat crept slowly out into the middle of the river, the
breeze being so light that only a faint rippling was heard at
the bow, and the craft hardly answered her helm. Major Starland
had noted that the wind was not favorable, and he was compelled
to tack toward the northern shore. He ran close in and was cheered
by a freshening of the breeze which added perceptibly to the speed.</p>

<p>"At this rate," said his sister, "we shall not reach Zalapata
till tomorrow is well advanced."</p>

<p>"It cannot matter, for there is no special need of haste."</p>

<p>"Suppose, when General Yozarro returns, he pursues us?"</p>

<p>"It is not impossible; it will be easy for him to overhaul such
a slow-sailing boat as this, but he dare not offer us harm. Are
we not free born Americans, and will not our government be quick
to punish such an offence?"</p>

<p>"You must not forget that the South American is an idiot, for,
had he not been, he would not have dared to forbid my leaving
the Castle."</p>

<p>"Since a long sail is before us, why not let me adjust a couch
for you to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Sleep! As if I could sleep at such a time as this! I had all
I needed last evening when in prison."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Captain Guzman and Martella were seated
at the bow, facing those at the stern. Thus the moonlit river
beyond was in clear view, and the sombre, motionless form of the
tugboat could be made out where it snuggled against the southern
bank. The deserter was speaking in low tones to the Captain, when
he uttered an exclamation which caused the officer to turn his
gaze to the rear.</p>

<p>That which the former fireman saw was a number of sparks mingling
with the heavy vapor that was beginning to tumble out of the smokestack.
The next moment both saw that the craft was heading out into the
river.</p>

<p>"General Yozarro and his officers have returned!" called Martella;
"the firemen are cramming the furnace with wood; they mean to
pursue us!"</p>

<p>Jack Starland and his sister looked behind them. The Atlamalcan
had spoken the truth. The time seemed much too short for the party
to have made the journey to the Castle and back. In fact, it was
impossible for them to have done so, but there could be no doubt
that they were all on the tugboat. The explanation instantly flashed
upon Martella.</p>

<p>"Captain Navarro suspected the truth some time after we left
and hurried to take us to the Castle again. Some news may have
reached him, or his own sense told him of my trick. He met the
General on the way."</p>

<p>Such undoubtedly was the fact. Had our friends suspected aught
of that nature, they would not have frittered away the precious
minutes as they had done.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the resinous wood flung into the furnace of the tugboat
was doing its work. From the single smokestack poured the murky
vapor, sprinkled with crimson sparks which were tossed right and
left high in air, to drop hissing into the water. In the moonlight,
a snowy winrow at the bow showed that the tug was plowing ahead
with fast increasing speed. Capable of making a dozen miles an
hour, she was already doing her best, and coming up with the sailboat
hand over hand.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes were given the fugitives in which to decide
what to do. A straight away race was hopeless, for the pursuer,
now no more than an eighth of a mile distant, was sure to overhaul
them in a very brief time.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to let General Yozarro come up with us," said
the Major; "I have no fear of his molesting me or Miss Starland,
and I am rather curious to hear what he has to say for himself.
We are in our own boat, or at least not in his, and we have committed
no crime against the Atlamalcan Republic, whatever that name means."</p>

<p>"You must not think for an instant of such a thing," said his
sister with great earnestness.</p>

<p>"Why not? Do you hold him in fear?"</p>

<p>"No; but he will take vengeance upon Martella, who has served
us so faithfully."</p>

<p>"Great heavens! I never thought of that; and he will be as merciless
with Captain Guzman for having helped Martella."</p>

<p>"And with <em>you</em> for crossing his path."</p>

<p>"With me! I long for a meeting with him; but, Captain," added
the American, raising his voice; "it will not do for you and Martella
to be on board when General Yozarro overtakes us."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," replied the Captain; "the General and
I have never loved each other, and even General Bambos would not
object strongly if it is proposed to shoot me for aiding an Atlamalcan
to desert from his navy."</p>

<p>Martella said nothing, but no one understood the situation better
than he.</p>

<p>"I will head the boat for the southern shore, where you two can
look out for yourselves."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will not have the time to reach it."</p>

<p>"It <em>must</em> be done!"</p>

<p>The American had pushed the tiller sharply round, and the boat
was speeding diagonally for the bank. The change of course gave
her a fairer wind, but the tug was coming up so fast that it looked
as if she must head off the fugitives. Full steam had been put
on, and our affrighted friends, when they looked back, saw the
tumbling foam at the bow, the spreading wake streaming fanlike
to the rear, and the dark figures crowding forward, amid whom
it was easy to believe they discerned the form of General Yozarro
cursing the engineer for not attaining better speed.</p>

<p>"If we cannot make it," said Martella to the Captain, "we must
jump over and swim."</p>

<p>"We cannot swim any faster than we are going now, and the water
abounds with enemies."</p>

<p>"None is so treacherous as Yozarro; I at least will try it; I
can let myself over softly and make so long a dive that perhaps
he will not notice me."</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes, Martella, for I do not like your plan."</p>

<p>The brief interval decided the question. It seemed that the sailboat
might touch land before the pursuer could interpose to head them
off. Martella decided to take his chances with the others.</p>

<p>The tug was now so near that Yozarro called:</p>

<p>"Stop or we'll blow you out of the water!"</p>

<p>"Blow and be hanged!" called back Major Jack; "if you fire on
an American citizen, your nuisance of a republic will be wiped
off the earth."</p>

<p>"You have a deserter with you; I demand his surrender."</p>

<p>Therein shone the cunning of General Yozarro. If an American
was fired upon in Atlamalcan waters for carrying off a deserter,
it was little satisfaction our citizen would be able to obtain.
Without hesitation, Major Starland shouted:</p>

<p>"We have the man; come and get him!"</p>
