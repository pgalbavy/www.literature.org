<P>
Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington
Gardens, which is the only house in the whole world that the
fairies have built for humans.  But no one has really seen it,
except just three or four, and they have not only seen it but
slept in it, and unless you sleep in it you never see it.  This
is because it is not there when you lie down, but it is there
when you wake up and step outside.
<P>
In a kind of way everyone may see it, but what you see is not
really it, but only the light in the windows.  You see the light
after Lock-out Time.  David, for instance, saw it quite
distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from
the pantomime, and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so
late at the Temple, which is the name of his father's office. 
Angela Clare, who loves to have a tooth extracted because then
she is treated to tea in a shop, saw more than one light, she saw
hundreds of them all together, and this must have been the
fairies building the house, for they build it every night and
always in a different part of the Gardens.  She thought one of
the lights was bigger than the others, though she was not quite
sure, for they jumped about so, and it might have been another
one that was bigger.  But if it was the same one, it was Peter
Pan's light. Heaps of children have seen the light, so that is
nothing.  But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the
house was first built.
<P>
Maimie was always rather a strange girl, and it was at night that
she was strange.  She was four years of age, and in the daytime
she was the ordinary kind.  She was pleased when her brother
Tony, who was a magnificent fellow of six, took notice of her,
and she looked up to him in the right way, and tried in vain to
imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved
her about.  Also, when she was batting she would pause though the
ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new
shoes. She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime.
<P>
But as the shades of night fell, Tony, the swaggerer, lost his
contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully, and no wonder, for
with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe
only as a leary look.  It was also a serene look that contrasted
grandly with Tony's uneasy glances.  Then he would make her
presents of his favourite toys (which he always took away from
her next morning) and she accepted them with a disturbing smile. 
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious
was (in brief) that they knew they were about to be sent to bed. 
It was then that Maimie was terrible.  Tony entreated her not to
do it to-night, and the mother and their coloured nurse
threatened her, but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile. 
And by-and-by when they were alone with their night-light she
would start up in bed crying "Hsh! what was that?"  Tony
beseeches her!  "It was nothing--don't, Maimie, don't!" and pulls
the sheet over his head. "It is coming nearer!" she cries; "Oh,
look at it, Tony!  It is feeling your bed with its horns--it is
boring for you, oh, Tony, oh!" and she desists not until he
rushes downstairs in his combinations, screeching.  When they
came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping
tranquilly, not shamming, you know, but really sleeping, and
looking like the sweetest little angel, which seems to me to make
it almost worse.
<P>
But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens, and
then Tony did most of the talking.  You could gather from his
talk that he was a very brave boy, and no one was so proud of it
as Maimie.  She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying
that she was his sister.  And at no time did she admire him more
than when he told her, as he often did with splendid firmness,
that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the
gates were closed.
<P>
"Oh, Tony," she would say, with awful respect, "but the fairies
will be so angry!"
<P>
"I daresay," replied Tony, carelessly.
<P>
"Perhaps," she said, thrilling, "Peter Pan will give you a sail
in his boat!"
<P>
"I shall make him," replied Tony; no wonder she was proud of him.
<P>
But they should not have talked so loudly, for one day they were
overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves, from
which the little people weave their summer curtains, and after
that Tony was a marked boy.  They loosened the rails before he
sat on them, so that down he came on the back of his head; they
tripped him up by catching his boot-lace and bribed the ducks to
sink his boat.  Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in
the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to
you, and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them.
<P>
Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing
things, but Tony was not that kind, and when she asked him which
day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he
merely replied, "Just some day;" he was quite vague about which
day except when she asked "Will it be to-day?" and then he could
always say for certain that it would not be to-day.  So she saw
that he was waiting for a real good chance.
<P>
This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with
snow, and there was ice on the Round Pond, not thick enough to
skate on but at least you could spoil it for to-morrow by
flinging stones, and many bright little boys and girls were doing
that.
<P>
When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to
the pond, but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first,
and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when
the Gardens closed that night.  It read half-past five.  Poor
ayah! she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so
many white children in the world, but she was not to laugh much
more that day.
<P>
Well, they went up the Baby Walk and back, and when they returned
to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five
o'clock for closing time.  But she was unacquainted with the
tricky ways of the fairies, and so did not see (as Maimie and
Tony saw at once) that they had changed the hour because there
was to be a ball to-night.  She said there was only time now to
walk to the top of the Hump and back, and as they trotted along
with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little
breasts.  You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball. 
Never, Tony felt, could he hope for a better chance.
<P>
He had to feel this, for Maimie so plainly felt it for him.  Her
eager eyes asked the question, "Is it to-day?" and he gasped and
then nodded.  Maimie slipped her hand into Tony's, and hers was
hot, but his was cold.  She did a very kind thing; she took off
her scarf and gave it to him!  "In case you should feel cold,"
she whispered.  Her face was aglow, but Tony's was very gloomy.
<P>
As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her, "I'm
afraid Nurse would see me, so I sha'n't be able to do it."
<P>
Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but
their ayah, when there were so many unknown terrors to fear, and
she said aloud, "Tony, I shall race you to the gate," and in a
whisper, "Then you can hide," and off they ran.
<P>
Tony could always outdistance her easily, but never had she known
him speed away so quickly as now, and she was sure he hurried
that he might have more time to hide.  "Brave, brave!" her doting
eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock; instead of
hiding, her hero had run out at the gate!  At this bitter sight
Maimie stopped blankly, as if all her lapful of darling treasures
were suddenly spilled, and then for very disdain she could not
sob; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to
St. Govor's Well and hid in Tony's stead.
<P>
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she
thought her other charge was with him and passed out.  Twilight
came on, and scores and hundreds of people passed out, including
the last one, who always has to run for it, but Maimie saw them
not.  She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate
tears.  When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs
and up her arms and dropped into her heart.  It was the stillness
of the Gardens.  Then she heard clang, then from another part
clang, then clang, clang far away.  It was the Closing of the
Gates.
<P>
Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard
a voice say, "So that's all right."  It had a wooden sound and
seemed to come from above, and she looked up in time to see an
elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning.
<P>
She was about to say, "I never knew you could speak!" when a
metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well
remarked to the elm, "I suppose it is a bit coldish up there?"
and the elm replied, "Not particularly, but you do get numb
standing so long on one leg," and he flapped his arms vigorously
just as the cabmen do before they drive off.  Maimie was quite
surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the
same sort of thing, and she stole away to the Baby Walk and
crouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its
shoulders but did not seem to mind her.
<P>
She was not in the least cold.  She was wearing a russet-coloured
pelisse and had the hood over her head, so that nothing of her
showed except her dear little face and her curls.  The rest of
her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments
that in shape she seemed rather like a ball.  She was about forty
round the waist.
<P>
There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk, when Maimie
arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over
the railing and set off for a smart walk.  They moved in a jerky
sort of way certainly, but that was because they used crutches.
An elderberry hobbled across the walk, and stood chatting with
some young quinces, and they all had crutches.  The crutches were
the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs.  They were
quite familiar objects to Maimie, but she had never known what
they were for until to-night.
<P>
She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy.  He was a street
boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees.
The way he did it was this, he pressed a spring in the trunk and
they shut like umbrellas, deluging the little plants beneath with
snow.  "Oh, you naughty, naughty child!" Maimie cried
indignantly, for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella
about your ears.
<P>
Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot, but the
chrysanthemums heard her, and they all said so pointedly "Hoity-
toity, what is this?" that she had to come out and show herself.
Then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do.
<P>
"Of course it is no affair of ours," a spindle tree said after
they had whispered together, "but you know quite well you ought
not to be here, and perhaps our duty is to report you to the
fairies; what do you think yourself?"
<P>
"I think you should not," Maimie replied, which so perplexed them
that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her.  "I
wouldn't ask it of you," she assured them, "if I thought it was
wrong," and of course after this they could not well carry tales.
They then said, "Well-a-day," and "Such is life!" for they can be
frightfully sarcastic, but she felt sorry for those of them who
had no crutches, and she said good-naturedly, "Before I go to the
fairies' ball, I should like to take you for a walk one at a
time; you can lean on me, you know."
<P>
At this they clapped their hands, and she escorted them up to the
Baby Walk and back again, one at a time, putting an arm or a
finger round the very frail, setting their leg right when it got
too ridiculous, and treating the foreign ones quite as
courteously as the English, though she could not understand a
word they said.
<P>
They behaved well on the whole, though some whimpered that she
had not taken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy,
and others jagged her, but it was quite unintentional, and she
was too much of a lady to cry out.  So much walking tired her and
she was anxious to be off to the ball, but she no longer felt
afraid.  The reason she felt no more fear was that it was now
night-time, and in the dark, you remember, Maimie was always
rather strange.
<P>
They were now loath to let her go, for, "If the fairies see you,"
they warned her, "they will mischief you, stab you to death or
compel you to nurse their children or turn you into something
tedious, like an evergreen oak."  As they said this they looked
with affected pity at an evergreen oak, for in winter they are
very envious of the evergreens.
<P>
"Oh, la!" replied the oak bitingly, "how deliciously cosy it is
to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked
creatures shivering!"
<P>
This made them sulky though they had really brought it on
themselves, and they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the
perils that faced her if she insisted on going to the ball.
<P>
She learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its
usual good temper at present, the cause being the tantalising
heart of the Duke of Christmas Daisies.  He was an Oriental
fairy, very poorly of a dreadful complaint, namely, inability to
love, and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could
not fall in love with one of them.  Queen Mab, who rules in the
Gardens, had been confident that her girls would bewitch him, but
alas, his heart, the doctor said, remained cold.  This rather
irritating doctor, who was his private physician, felt the Duke's
heart immediately after any lady was presented, and then always
shook his bald head and murmured, "Cold, quite cold!"  Naturally
Queen Mab felt disgraced, and first she tried the effect of
ordering the court into tears for nine minutes, and then she
blamed the Cupids and decreed that they should wear fools' caps
until they thawed the Duke's frozen heart.
<P>
"How I should love to see the Cupids in their dear little fools'
caps!" Maimie cried, and away she ran to look for them very
recklessly, for the Cupids hate to be laughed at.
<P>
It is always easy to discover where a fairies' ball is being
held, as ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous
parts of the Gardens, on which those invited may walk to the
dance without wetting their pumps.  This night the ribbons were
red and looked very pretty on the snow.
<P>
Maimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without
meeting anybody, but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade
approaching.  To her surprise they seemed to be returning from
the ball, and she had just time to hide from them by bending her
knees and holding out her arms and pretending to be a garden
chair. There were six horsemen in front and six behind, in the
middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held up by two
pages, and on the train, as if it were a couch, reclined a lovely
girl, for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about.  She
was dressed in golden rain, but the most enviable part of her was
her neck, which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture, and
of course showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat
could have glorified it.  The high-born fairies obtain this
admired effect by pricking their skin, which lets the blue blood
come through and dye them, and you cannot imagine anything so
dazzling unless you have seen the ladies' busts in the jewellers'
windows.
<P>
Maimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a
passion, tilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even
fairies to tilt them, and she concluded that this must be another
case in which the doctor had said "Cold, quite cold!"
<P>
Well, she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge
over a dry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been
unable to climb out.  At first this little damsel was afraid of
Maimie, who most kindly went to her aid, but soon she sat in her
hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was Brownie, and
that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the
ball to see if the Duke would have her.
<P>
"Of course," she said, "I am rather plain," and this made Maimie
uncomfortable, for indeed the simple little creature was almost
quite plain for a fairy.
<P>
It was difficult to know what to reply.
<P>
"I see you think I have no chance," Brownie said falteringly.
<P>
"I don't say that," Maimie answered politely, "of course your
face is just a tiny bit homely, but--"  Really it was quite
awkward for her.
<P>
Fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar.  He
had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful
ladies in London were on view for half-a-crown the second day,
but on his return home instead of being dissatisfied with
Maimie's mother he had said, "You can't think, my dear, what a
relief it is to see a homely face again."
<P>
Maimie repeated this story, and it fortified Brownie
tremendously, indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that
the Duke would choose her.  So she scudded away up the ribbon,
calling out to Maimie not to follow lest the Queen should
mischief her.
<P>
But Maimie's curiosity tugged her forward, and presently at the
seven Spanish chestnuts, she saw a wonderful light.  She crept
forward until she was quite near it, and then she peeped from
behind a tree.
<P>
The light, which was as high as your head above the ground, was
composed of myriads of glow-worms all holding on to each other,
and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring.  There were
thousands of little people looking on, but they were in shadow
and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that
luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had
to wink hard all the time she looked at them.
<P>
It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of
Christmas Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a
moment: yet out of love his dusky grace still was: you could see
it by the shamed looks of the Queen and court (though they
pretended not to care), by the way darling ladies brought forward
for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on,
and by his own most dreary face.
<P>
Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke's heart
and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was
particularly sorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools' caps
in obscure places and, every time they heard that "Cold, quite
cold," bowed their disgraced little heads.
<P>
She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell
you now why he was so late that night.  It was because his boat
had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice,
through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty
paddle.
<P>
The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him, for they could not
dance, so heavy were their hearts.  They forget all the steps
when they are sad and remember them again when they are merry. 
David tells me that fairies never say "We feel happy": what they
say is, "We feel dancey."
<P>
Well, they were looking very undancey indeed, when sudden
laughter broke out among the onlookers, caused by Brownie, who
had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented
to the Duke.
<P>
Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared, though
she had really no hope; no one seemed to have the least hope
except Brownie herself, who, however, was absolutely confident.
She was led before his grace, and the doctor putting a finger
carelessly on the ducal heart, which for convenience sake was
reached by a little trapdoor in his diamond shirt, had begun to
say mechanically, "Cold, qui--," when he stopped abruptly.
<P>
"What's this?" he cried, and first he shook the heart like a
watch, and then put his ear to it.
<P>
"Bless my soul!" cried the doctor, and by this time of course the
excitement among the spectators was tremendous, fairies fainting
right and left.
<P>
Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke, who was very much
startled and looked as if he would like to run away.  "Good
gracious me!" the doctor was heard muttering, and now the heart
was evidently on fire, for he had to jerk his fingers away from
it and put them in his mouth.
<P>
The suspense was awful!
<P>
Then in a loud voice, and bowing low, "My Lord Duke," said the
physician elatedly, "I have the honour to inform your excellency
that your grace is in love."
<P>
You can't conceive the effect of it.  Brownie held out her arms
to the Duke and he flung himself into them, the Queen leapt into
the arms of the Lord Chamberlain, and the ladies of the court
leapt into the arms of her gentlemen, for it is etiquette to
follow her example in everything.  Thus in a single moment about
fifty marriages took place, for if you leap into each other's
arms it is a fairy wedding.  Of course a clergyman has to be
present.
<P>
How the crowd cheered and leapt!  Trumpets brayed, the moon came
out, and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays
as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild
abandon round the fairy ring.  Most gladsome sight of all, the
Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps from their heads and cast
them high in the air.  And then Maimie went and spoiled
everything.  She couldn't help it.  She was crazy with delight
over her little friend's good fortune, so she took several steps
forward and cried in an ecstasy, "Oh, Brownie, how splendid!"
<P>
Everybody stood still, the music ceased, the lights went out, and
all in the time you may take to say "Oh dear!"  An awful sense of
her peril came upon Maimie, too late she remembered that she was
a lost child in a place where no human must be between the
locking and the opening of the gates, she heard the murmur of an
angry multitude, she saw a thousand swords flashing for her
blood, and she uttered a cry of terror and fled.
<P>
How she ran! and all the time her eyes were starting out of her
head.  Many times she lay down, and then quickly jumped up and
ran on again.  Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that
she no longer knew she was in the Gardens.  The one thing she was
sure of was that she must never cease to run, and she thought she
was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone
to sleep.  She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were
her mother kissing her good-night.  She thought her coverlet of
snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull it over her head.  And
when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was
mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she
slept. But it was the fairies.
<P>
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to
mischief her.  When she rushed away they had rent the air with
such cries as "Slay her!"  "Turn her into something extremely
unpleasant!" and so on, but the pursuit was delayed while they
discussed who should march in front, and this gave Duchess
Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon.
<P>
Every bride has a right to a boon, and what she asked for was
Maimie's life.  "Anything except that," replied Queen Mab
sternly, and all the fairies chanted "Anything except that."  But
when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so
enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown,
they gave three huzzas for the little human, and set off, like an
army, to thank her, the court advancing in front and the canopy
keeping step with it.  They traced Maimie easily by her
footprints in the snow.
<P>
But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs, it seemed
impossible to thank Maimie, for they could not waken her.  They
went through the form of thanking her, that is to say, the new
King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome,
but she heard not a word of it.  They also cleared the snow off
her, but soon she was covered again, and they saw she was in
danger of perishing of cold.
<P>
"Turn her into something that does not mind the cold," seemed a
good suggestion of the doctor's, but the only thing they could
think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake.  "And it might
melt," the Queen pointed out, so that idea had to be given up.
<P>
A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot,
but though there were so many of them she was too heavy.  By this
time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs, but
presently the Cupids had a lovely idea.  "Build a house round
her," they cried, and at once everybody perceived that this was
the thing to do; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among
the branches, architects were running round Maimie, measuring
her; a bricklayer's yard sprang up at her feet, seventy-five
masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen laid it,
overseers were appointed to keep the boys off, scaffoldings were
run up, the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning
lathes, and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were
putting in the windows.
<P>
The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely.
One of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a
second, but they built a verandah round it, leading to the front
door.  The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and
the door rather smaller, but it would be easy for her to get out
by taking off the roof.  The fairies, as is their custom, clapped
their hands with delight over their cleverness, and they were all
so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear
to think they had finished it.  So they gave it ever so many
little extra touches, and even then they added more extra
touches.
<P>
For instance, two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney.
<P>
"Now we fear it is quite finished," they sighed.  But no, for
another two ran up the ladder, and tied some smoke to the
chimney.
<P>
"That certainly finishes it," they cried reluctantly.
<P>
"Not at all," cried a glow-worm, "if she were to wake without
seeing a night-light she might be frightened, so I shall be her
night-light."
<P>
"Wait one moment," said a china merchant, "and I shall make you a
saucer."
<P>
Now alas, it was absolutely finished.
<P>
Oh, dear no!
<P>
"Gracious me," cried a brass manufacturer, "there's no handle on
the door," and he put one on.
<P>
An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-
mat.  Carpenters arrived with a water-butt, and the painters
insisted on painting it.
<P>
Finished at last!
<P>
"Finished! how can it be finished," the plumber demanded
scornfully, "before hot and cold are put in?" and he put in hot
and cold.  Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and
spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses, and soon they had
a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable
garden to the left, and roses and clematis on the walls of the
house, and in less time than five minutes all these dear things
were in full bloom.
<P>
Oh, how beautiful the little house was now!  But it was at last
finished true as true, and they had to leave it and return to the
dance.  They all kissed their hands to it as they went away, and
the last to go was Brownie.  She stayed a moment behind the
others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney.
<P>
All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in
the Figs taking care of Maimie, and she never knew.  She slept
until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously
cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg, and then she
almost fell asleep again, and then she called out, "Tony," for
she thought she was at home in the nursery.  As Tony made no
answer, she sat up, whereupon her head hit the roof, and it
opened like the lid of a box, and to her bewilderment she saw all
around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow.  As she was
not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself,
so she pinched her cheeks, and then she knew it was herself, and
this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great
adventure.  She remembered now everything that had happened to
her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the
fairies, but however, she asked herself, had she got into this
funny place? She stepped out by the roof, right over the garden,
and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the
night.  It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else.
<P>
"Oh, you darling, oh, you sweet, oh, you love!" she cried.
<P>
Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it
now knew that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken
than it began to grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could
scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could
not contain her now.  It always remained as complete as ever, but
it became smaller and smaller, and the garden dwindled at the
same time, and the snow crept closer, lapping house and garden
up.  Now the house was the size of a little dog's kennel, and now
of a Noah's Ark, but still you could see the smoke and the
door-handle and the roses on the wall, every one complete.  The
glow-worm light was waning too, but it was still there. 
"Darling, loveliest, don't go!" Maimie cried, falling on her
knees, for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread,
but still quite complete.  But as she stretched out her arms
imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself,
and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse
of snow.
