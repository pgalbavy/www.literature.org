<p>In Porfirio Diaz' day, the lake-side began to be the Riviera of
Mexico, and Orilla was to be the Nice, or at least the Mentone of
the country.  But revolutions started erupting again, and in 1911
Don Porfirio fled to Paris with, it is said, thirty million gold
pesos in his pocket: a peso being half a dollar, nearly half-a-
crown.  But we need not believe all that is said, especially by a
man's enemies.</p>

<p>During the subsequent revolutions, Orilla, which had begun to be a
winter paradise for the Americans, lapsed back into barbarism and
broken brickwork.  In 1921 a feeble new start had been made.</p>

<p>The place belonged to a German-Mexican family, who also owned the
adjacent hacienda.  They acquired the property from the American
Hotel Company, who had undertaken to develop the lake-shore, and
who had gone bankrupt during the various revolutions.</p>

<p>The German-Mexican owners were not popular with the natives.  An
angel from heaven would not have been popular, these years, if he
had been known as the owner of property.  However, in 1921 the
hotel was very modestly opened again, with an American manager.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year, Jos&eacute;, son of the German-Mexican owner,
came to stay with his wife and children in the hotel, in the new
wing.  Jos&eacute; was a bit of a fool, as most foreigners are, after the
first generation in Mexico.  Having business to settle, he went
into Guadalajara to the bank and returned with a thousand gold
pesos in a bag, keeping the matter, as he thought, a dead secret.</p>

<p>Everyone had just gone to bed, on a brilliant moonlight night in
winter, when two men appeared in the yard calling for Jos&eacute;: they
had to speak to him.  Jos&eacute;, suspecting nothing, left his wife and
two children, and went down.  In a moment he called for the
American manager.  The manager, thinking it was some bargaining to
be done, also came down.  As he came out of the door, two men
seized him by the arms, and said:  'Don't make a noise!'</p>

<p>'What's amiss?' said Bell, who had built up Orilla, and had been
twenty years on the lake.</p>

<p>Then he noticed that two other men had hold of Jos&eacute;.  'Come,' they
said.</p>

<p>There were five Mexicans - Indians, or half-Indians - and the two
captives.  They went, the captives in slippers and shirtsleeves, to
the little office away at the end of the other part of the hotel,
which had been the old ranch-house.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' asked Bell.</p>

<p>'Give us the money,' said the bandits.</p>

<p>'Oh, all right,' said the American.  There were a few pesos only in
the safe.  He opened, showed them, and they took the money.</p>

<p>'Now give us the rest,' they said.</p>

<p>'There is no more,' said the manager, in all sincerity; for Jos&eacute;
had not confessed to the thousand pesos.</p>

<p>The five peons then began to search the poor little office.  They
found a pile of red blankets - which they appropriated - and a few
bottles of red wine - which they drank.</p>

<p>'Now,' they said, 'give us the money.'</p>

<p>'I can't give you what there isn't to give,' said the manager.</p>

<p>'Good!' they said, and pulled out the hideous machetes, the heavy
knives of the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Jos&eacute;, intimidated, produced the suit-case with the thousand pesos.
The money was wrapped up in the corner of a blanket.</p>

<p>'Now, come with us,' said the bandits.</p>

<p>'Where to?' asked the manager, beginning at last to be scared.</p>

<p>'Only out on to the hill, where we will leave you, so that you
cannot telephone to Ixtlahuacan before we have time to get away,'
said the Indians.</p>

<p>Outside, in the bright moon, the air was chill.  The American
shivered, in his trousers and shirt and a pair of bedroom slippers.</p>

<p>'Let me take a coat,' he said.</p>

<p>'Take a blanket,' said the tall Indian.</p>

<p>He took a blanket, and with two men holding his arms, he followed
Jos&eacute;, who was likewise held captive, out of the little gate, across
the dust of the road, and up the steep little round hill on which
the organ cactus thrust up their sinister clumps, like bunches of
cruel fingers, in the moonlight.  The hill was stony and steep, the
going slow.  Jos&eacute;, a fat young man of twenty-eight, protested in
the feeble manner of the well-to-do Mexicans.</p>

<p>At last they came to the top of the hill.  Three men took Jos&eacute;
apart, leaving Bell alone near a cactus clump.  The moon shone in a
perfect Mexican heaven.  Below, the big lake glimmered faintly,
stretching its length towards the west.  The air was so clear, the
mountains across, thirty miles away, stood sharp and still in the
moonlight.  And not a sound nor a motion anywhere!  At the foot of
the hill was the hacienda, with the peons asleep in their huts.
But what help was there in them?</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; and the three men had gone behind a cactus-tree that stuck up
straight like a great black bundle of poles, poised on one central
foot, and cast a sharp, iron shadow.  The American could hear the
voices, talking low and rapidly, but could not distinguish the
words.  His two guards drew away from him a little, to hear what
the others were saying, behind the cactus.</p>

<p>And the American, who knew the ground he stood on and the sky that
hung over him, felt again the black vibration of death in the air,
the black thrill of the death-lust.  Unmistakable he felt it
seething in the air, as any man may feel it, in Mexico.  And the
strange aboriginal fiendishness, awake now in the five bandits,
communicated itself to his blood.</p>

<p>Loosening his blanket, he listened tensely in the moonlight.  And
came the thud! thud! thud! of a machete striking with lust in a
human body, then the strange voice of Jos&eacute;:  'Perd&oacute;neme! - Forgive
me!' the murdered man cried as he fell.</p>

<p>The American waited for no more.  Dropping his blanket, he jumped
for the cactus cover, and stooping, took the down-slope like a
rabbit.  The pistol-shots rang out after him, but the Mexicans
don't as a rule take good aim.  His bedroom slippers flew off, and
barefoot, the man, thin and light, sped down over the stones and
the cactus, down to the hotel.</p>

<p>When he got down, he found everyone in the hotel awake and
shouting.</p>

<p>'They are killing Jos&eacute;!' he said, and he rushed to the telephone,
expecting every moment the five bandits would be on him.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the old ranch-building, in the dining-room.
There was no answer - no answer - no answer.  In her little bedroom
over the kitchen, the cook-woman, the traitress, was yelling.
Across in the new wing, a little distance away, Jos&eacute;'s Mexican wife
was screaming.  One of the servant boys appeared.</p>

<p>'Try and get the police in Ixtlahuacan,' said the American, and he
ran to the new wing, to get his gun and to barricade the doors.
His daughter, a motherless girl, was crying with Jose's wife.</p>

<p>There was no answer on the telephone.  At dawn, the cook, who said
the bandits would not hurt a woman, went across to the hacienda to
fetch the peons.  And when the sun rose, a man was sent for the
police.</p>

<p>They found the body of Jos&eacute;, pierced with fourteen holes.  The
American was carried to Ixtlahuacan, and kept in bed, having cactus
spines dug out of his feet by two native women.</p>

<p>The bandits fled across the marshes.  Months later, they were
identified by the stolen blankets, away in Michoacan; and, pursued,
one of them betrayed the others.</p>

<p>After this, the hotel was closed again, and had been reopened only
three months when Kate arrived.</p>

<p>But Villiers came with another story.  Last year the peons had
murdered the manager of one of the estates across the lake.  They
had stripped him and left him naked on his back, with his sexual
organs cut off and put into his mouth, his nose slit and pinned
back, the two halves, to his cheeks, with long cactus spines.</p>

<p>'Tell me no more!' said Kate.</p>

<p>She felt there was doom written on the very sky, doom and horror.</p>

<p>She wrote to Don Ram&oacute;n in Sayula, saying she wanted to go back to
Europe.  True, she herself had seen no horrors, apart from the
bull-fight.  And she had had some exquisite moments, as coming to
this hotel in the boat.  The natives had a certain mystery and
beauty, to her.  But she could not bear the unease, and the latest
sense of horror.</p>

<p>True, the peons were poor.  They used to work for twenty cents,
American, a day; and now the standard price was fifty cents, or one
peso.  But then in the old days they received their wage all the
year round.  Now, only at harvest time or sowing time.  No work, no
pay.  And in the long dry season, it was mostly no work.</p>

<p>'Still,' said the German manager of the hotel, a man who had run a
rubber plantation in Tabasco, a sugar plantation in the state of
Vera Cruz, and an hacienda growing wheat, maize, oranges, in
Jalisco: 'still, it isn't a question of money with the peons.  It
doesn't start with the peons.  It starts in Mexico City, with a lot
of malcontents who want to put their spoke in the wheel, and who
lay hold of pious catchwords, to catch the poor.  There's no more
in it than that.  Then the agitators go round and infect the peons.
It is nothing but a sort of infectious disease, like syphilis, all
this revolution and socialism.'</p>

<p>'But why does no one oppose it,' said Kate.  'Why don't the
hacendados put up a fight, instead of caving in and running away?'</p>

<p>'The Mexican HACENDADO!'  The man's German eyes gave out a spark.
'The Mexican GENTLEMAN is such a brave man, that while the soldier
is violating his wife on the bed, he is hiding under the bed and
holding his breath so they shan't find him.  He's as brave as
that.'</p>

<p>Kate looked away uncomfortably.</p>

<p>'They all want the United States to intervene.  They hate the
Americans; but they want the United States to intervene, to save
them their money and their property.  That's how brave they are!
They hate the Americans personally, but they love them because they
can look after money and property.  So they want the United States
to annex Mexico, the beloved patria; leaving the marvellous green
and white and red flag, and the eagle with the snake in its claws,
for the sake of appearances and HONOUR!  They're simply bottled
full of honour; of that sort.'</p>

<p>Always the same violence of bitterness, Kate thought to-herself.
And she was so weary of it.  How, how weary she was of politics, of
the very words 'Labour' and 'SOCIALISM!' and all that sort!  It
suffocated her.</p>

<p>'Have you heard of the men of Quetzalcoatl?' asked Kate.</p>

<p>'Quetzalcoatl!' exclaimed the manager, giving a little click of the
final 'l', in a peculiar native fashion.  'That's another try-on of
the Bolshevists.  They thought socialism needed a god, so they're
going to fish him out of this lake.  He'll do for another pious
catchword in another revolution.'</p>

<p>The man went away, unable to stand any more.</p>

<p>'Oh dear!' thought Kate.  'It really is hard to bear.'</p>

<p>But she wanted to hear more of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>'Did you know,' she said to the man later, showing him the little
pot, 'that they find those things in the lake?'</p>

<p>'They're common enough!' he said.  'They used to throw them in, in
the idolatrous days.  May still do so, for what I know.  Then get
them out again to sell to tourists.'</p>

<p>'They call them ollitas of Quetzalcoatl.'</p>

<p>'That's a new invention.'</p>

<p>'Why, do you think?'</p>

<p>'They're trying to start a new thing, that's all.  They've got this
society on the lake here, of the Men of Quetzalcoatl, and they go
round singing songs.  It's another dodge for national-socialism,
that's all.'</p>

<p>'What do they do, the Men of Quetzalcoatl?'</p>

<p>'I can't see they do anything, except talk and get excited over
their own importance.'</p>

<p>'But what's the idea?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't say.  Don't suppose they have any.  But if they have,
they won't let on to you.  You're a gringo - or a gringita, at the
best.  And this is for pure Mexicans.  For los se&ntilde;ores, the
workmen, and los caballeros, the peons.  Every peon is a caballero
nowadays, and every workman is a se&ntilde;or.  So I suppose they're going
to get themselves a special god, to put the final feather in their
caps.'</p>

<p>'Where did it start, the Quetzalcoatl thing?'</p>

<p>'Down in Sayula.  They say Don Ram&oacute;n Carrasco is at the back of it.
Maybe he wants to be the next President - or maybe he's aiming
higher, and wants to be the first Mexican Pharaoh.'</p>

<p>Ah, how tired it made Kate feel; the hopelessness, the ugliness,
the cynicism, the emptiness.  She felt she could cry aloud, for the
unknown gods to put the magic back into her life, and to save her
from the dry-rot of the world's sterility.</p>

<p>She thought again of going back to Europe.  But what was the good?
She knew it!  It was all politics or jazzing or slushy mysticism or
sordid spiritualism.  And the magic had gone.  The younger
generation, so smart and INTERESTING, but so without any mystery,
any background.  The younger the generation, the flatter and more
jazzy, more and more devoid of wonder.</p>

<p>No, she could not go back to Europe.</p>

<p>And no!  She refused to take the hotel manager's estimate of
Quetzalcoatl.  How should a hotel manager judge? - even if he was
not really an hotel manager, but a ranch-overseer.  She had see
Ram&oacute;n Carrasco, and Cipriano.  And they were men.  They wanted
something beyond.  She would believe in them.  Anything, anything
rather than this sterility of nothingness which was the world, and
into which her life was drifting.</p>

<p>She would send Villiers away, too.  He was nice, she liked him.
But he, too, was widdershins, unwinding the sensations of
disintegration and anti-life.  No, she must send him away.  She
must, she must free herself from these mechanical connections.</p>

<p>Every one of them, like Villiers, was like a cog-wheel in contact
with which all one's workings were reversed.  Everything he said,
everything he did, reversed her real life-flow, made her go against
the sun.</p>

<p>And she did not want to go against the sun.  After all, in spite of
the horrors latent in Mexico, when you got these dark-faced people
away from wrong contacts like agitators and socialism, they made
one feel that life was vast, if fearsome, and death was fathomless.</p>

<p>Horrors might burst out of them.  But something must burst out,
sometimes, if men are not machines.</p>

<p>No! no! no! no! no! she cried to her own soul.  Let me still
believe in some human contact.  Let it not be all cut off for me!</p>

<p>But she made up her mind to be alone, and to cut herself off from
all the mechanical widdershin contacts.  Villiers must go back to
his United States.  She would be alone in her own milieu.  Not to
be touched by any, any of the mechanical cogwheel people.  To be
left alone, not to be touched.  To hide, and be hidden, and never
really be spoken to.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time, with her blood flowing softly sunwise, to
let the sunwise sympathy of unknown people steal in to her.  To
shut doors of iron against the mechanical world.  But to let the
sunwise world steal across to her, and add its motion to her, the
motion of the stress of life, with the big sun and the stars like a
tree holding out its leaves.</p>

<p>She wanted an old Spanish house, with its inner patio of flowers
and water.  Turned inwards, to the few flowers walled in by shadow.
To turn one's back on the cog-wheel world.  Not to look out any
more on to that horrible machine of the world.  To look at one's
own quiet little fountain and one's own little orange-trees, with
only heaven above.</p>

<p>So, having soothed her heart, she wrote Don Ram&oacute;n again, that she
was coming to Sayula to look for a house.  She sent Villiers away.
And the next day she set off with a man-servant, in the old motor-
boat of the hotel, down to the village of Sayula.</p>

<p>It was thirty-five miles to travel, down the long lake.  But the
moment she set off, she felt at peace.  A tall, dark-faced fellow
sat in the stern of the boat, steering and attending to the motor.
She sat on cushions in the middle.  And the young manservant
perched in the prow.</p>

<p>They started before sunrise, when the lake was bathed in motionless
light.  Odd tufts of water-hyacinth were travelling on the soft
spermy water, holding up a green leaf like a little sail of a boat,
and nodding a delicate, mauve-blue flower.</p>

<p>Give me the mystery and let the world live again for me! Kate cried
to her own soul.  And deliver me from man's automatism.</p>

<p>The sun rose, and a whiteness of light played on the tops of the
mountains.  The boat hugged the north shore, turning the promontory
on which the villas had started so jauntily, twenty years ago, but
now were lapsing back to wilderness.  All was still and motionless
in the light.  Sometimes on the little bare patches high up on the
dry hills were white specks; birds?  No, men in their white cotton,
peons hoeing.  They were so tiny and so distinct, they looked like
white birds settled.</p>

<p>Round the bend were the hot springs, the church, the inaccessible
village of the pure Indians, who spoke no Spanish.  There were some
green trees, under the precipitous, dry mountain-side.</p>

<p>So on and on, the motor-boat chugging incessantly, the man in the
bows coiled up like a serpent, watching; the fish-milk water
gleaming and throwing off a dense light, so that the mountains away
across were fused out.  And Kate, under the awning, went into a
kind of sleep.</p>

<p>They were passing the island, with its ruins of fortress and
prison.  It was all rock and dryness, with great broken walls and
the shell of a church among its hurtful stones and its dry grey
herbage.  For a long time the Indians had defended it against the
Spaniards.  Then the Spaniards used the island as a fortress
against the Indians.  Later, as a penal settlement.  And now the
place was a ruin, repellent, full of scorpions, and otherwise empty
of life.  Only one or two fishermen lived in the tiny cove facing
the mainland, and a flock of goats, specks of life creeping among
the rocks.  And an unhappy fellow put there by the Government to
register the weather.</p>

<p>No, Kate did not want to land.  The place looked too sinister.  She
took food from the basket, and ate a little lunch, and dozed.</p>

<p>In this country she was afraid.  But it was her soul more than her
body that knew fear.  She had realized, for the first time, with
finality and fatality, what was the illusion she laboured under.
She had thought that each individual had a complete self, a
complete soul, an accomplished I.  And now she realized as plainly
as if she had turned into a new being, that this was not so.  Men
and women had incomplete selves, made up of bits assembled together
loosely and somewhat haphazard.  Man was not created ready-made.
Men to-day were half-made, and women were half-made.  Creatures
that existed and functioned with certain regularity, but which ran
off into a hopeless jumble of inconsequence.</p>

<p>Half-made, like insects that can run fast and be so busy and
suddenly grow wings, but which are only winged grubs after all.  A
world full of half-made creatures on two legs, eating food and
degrading the one mystery left to them, sex.  Spinning a great lot
of words, burying themselves inside the cocoons of words and ideas
that they spin round themselves, and inside the cocoons, mostly
perishing inert and overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Half-made creatures, rarely more than half-responsible and half-
accountable, acting in terrible swarms, like locusts.</p>

<p>Awful thought!  And with a collective insect-like will, to avoid
the responsibility of achieving any more perfected being or
identity.  The queer, rabid hate of being urged on into purer self.
The morbid fanaticism of the non-integrate.</p>

<p>In the great seething light of the lake, with the terrible blue-
ribbed mountains of Mexico beyond, she seemed swallowed by some
grisly skeleton, in the cage of his death-anatomy.  She was afraid,
mystically, of the man crouching there in the bows with his smooth
thighs and supple loins like a snake, and his black eyes watching.
A half-being, with a will to disintegration and death.  And the
tall man behind her at the tiller, he had the curious smoke-grey
phosphorus eyes under black lashes sometimes met among the Indians.
Handsome, he was, and quiet and seemingly self-contained.  But with
that peculiar devilish half-smile lurking under his face, the half-
jeering look of a part-thing, which knows its power to destroy the
purer thing.</p>

<p>And yet, Kate told herself, both these men were manly fellows.
They would not molest her, unless she communicated the thought to
them, and by a certain cowardliness, prompted them.  Their souls
were nascent, there was no fixed evil in them, they could sway both
ways.</p>

<p>So in her soul she cried aloud to the greater mystery, the higher
power that hovered in the interstices of the hot air, rich and
potent.  It was as if she could lift her hands and clutch the
silent, stormless potency that roved everywhere, waiting.  'Come
then!' she said, drawing a long slow breath, and addressing the
silent life-breath which hung unrevealed in the atmosphere,
waiting.</p>

<p>And as the boat ran on, and her fingers rustled in the warm water
of the lake, she felt the fulness descend into her once more, the
peace, and the power.  The fulfilment filling her soul like the
fulness of ripe grapes.  And she thought to herself:  'Ah, how
wrong I have been, not to turn sooner to the other presence, not to
take the life-breath sooner!  How wrong to be afraid of these two
men.'</p>

<p>She did what she had been half-afraid to do before; she offered
them the oranges and sandwiches still in the basket.  And each of
the men looked at her, the smoke-grey eyes looked her in the eyes,
and the black eyes looked her in the eyes.  And the man with the
smoke-grey eyes, who was cunninger than the other man, but also
prouder, said to her with his eyes:  We are living!  I know your
sex, and you know mine.  The mystery we are glad not to meddle
with.  You leave me my natural honour, and I thank you for the
grace.</p>

<p>In his look, so quick and proud, and in his quiet Muchas gracias!
she heard the touch of male recognition, a man glad to retain his
honour, and to feel the communion of grace.  Perhaps it was the
Spanish word Gracias!  But in her soul she was thinking of the
communion of grace.</p>

<p>With the black-eyed man it was the same.  He was humbler.  But as
he peeled his orange and dropped the yellow peel on the water, she
could see the stillness, the humility, and the pathos of grace in
him; something very beautiful and truly male, and very hard to find
in a civilized white man.  It was not of the spirit.  It was of the
dark, strong, unbroken blood, the flowering of the soul.</p>

<p>Then she thought to herself:  After all, it is good to be here.  It
is very good to be in this boat on this lake with these two silent,
semi-barbarous men.  They can receive the gift of grace, and we can
share it like a communion, they and I.  I am very glad to be here.
It is so much better than love: the love I knew with Joachim.  This
is the fulness of the vine.</p>

<p>'Sayula!' said the man in the bows, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>She saw, away off, a place where there were green trees, where the
shore was flat, and a biggish building stood out.</p>

<p>'What is the building?' she asked.</p>

<p>'The railway station.'</p>

<p>She was suitably impressed, for it was a new-looking, imposing
structure.</p>

<p>A little steamer was smoking, lying off from a wooden jetty in the
loneliness, and black, laden boats were poling out to her, and
merging back to shore.  The vessel gave a hoot, and slowly yet
busily set off on the bosom of the water, heading in a slanting
line across the lake, to which the tiny high white twin-towers of
Tuliap&aacute;n showed above the water-line, tiny and far-off, on the
other side.</p>

<p>They had passed the jetty, and rounding the shoal where the willows
grew, she could see Sayula; white fluted twin-towers of the church,
obelisk shaped above the pepper-trees; beyond, a mound of a hill
standing alone, dotted with dry bushes, distinct and Japanese-
looking; beyond this, the corrugated, blue-ribbed, flat-flanked
mountains of Mexico.</p>

<p>It looked peaceful, delicate, almost Japanese.  As she drew nearer
she saw the beach with the washing spread on the sand; the fleecy
green willow-trees and pepper-trees, and the villas in foliage and
flowers, hanging magenta curtains of bougainvillea, red dots of
hibiscus, pink abundance of tall oleander trees; occasional palm-
trees sticking out.</p>

<p>The boat was steering round a stone jetty, on which, in black
letters, was painted an advertisement for motor-car tyres.  There
were a few seats, some deep fleecy trees growing out of the sand, a
booth for selling drinks, a little promenade, and white boats on a
sandy beach.  A few women sitting under parasols, a few bathers in
the water, and trees in front of the few villas deep in green or
blazing scarlet blossoms.</p>

<p>'This is very good,' thought Kate.  'It is not too savage, and not
over-civilized.  It isn't broken, but it is rather out of repair.
It is in contact with the world, but the world has got a very weak
grip on it.'</p>

<p>She went to the hotel, as Don Ram&oacute;n had advised her.</p>

<p>'Do you come from Orilla?  You are Mrs Leslie?  Don Ram&oacute;n Carrasco
sent us a letter about you.'</p>

<p>There was a house.  Kate paid her boatmen and shook hands with
them.  She was sorry to be cut off from them again.  And they
looked at her with a touch of regret as they left.  She said to
herself:</p>

<p>'There is something rich and alive in these people.  They want to
be able to breathe the Great Breath.  They are like children,
helpless.  And then they're like demons.  But somewhere, I believe,
they want the breath of life and the communion of the brave, more
than anything.'</p>

<p>She was surprised at herself, suddenly using this language.  But
her weariness and her sense of devastation had been so complete,
that the Other Breath in the air, and the bluish dark power in the
earth had become, almost suddenly, more real to her than so-called
reality.  Concrete, jarring, exasperating reality had melted away,
and a soft world of potency stood in its place, the velvety dark
flux from the earth, the delicate yet supreme life-breath in the
inner air.  Behind the fierce sun the dark eyes of a deeper sun
were watching, and between the bluish ribs of the mountains a
powerful heart was secretly beating, the heart of the earth.</p>

<p>Her house was what she wanted; a low, L-shaped, tiled building with
rough red floors and deep veranda, and the other two sides of the
patio completed by the thick, dark little mango-forest outside the
low wall.  The square of the patio, within the precincts of the
house and the mango-trees, was gay with oleanders and hibiscus, and
there was a basin of water in the seedy grass.  The flower-pots
along the veranda were full of flowering geranium and foreign
flowers.  At the far end of the patio the chickens were scratching
under the silent motionlessness of ragged banana-trees.</p>

<p>There she had it; her stone, cool, dark house, every room opening
on to the veranda; her deep, shady veranda, or piazza, or corridor,
looking out to the brilliant sun, the sparkling flowers and the
seed-grass, the still water and the yellowing banana-trees, the
dark splendour of the shadow-dense mango-trees.</p>

<p>With the house went a Mexican Juana with two thick-haired daughters
and one son.  This family lived in a den at the back of the
projecting bay of the dining-room.  There, half screened, was the
well and the toilet, and a little kitchen and a sleeping-room where
the family slept on mats on the floor.  There the paltry chickens
paddled, and the banana-trees made a chitter as the wind came.</p>

<p>Kate had four bedrooms to choose from.  She chose the one whose
low, barred window opened on the rough, grass and cobble-stone
street, closed her doors and windows, and went to sleep, saying to
herself as she lay down:  Now I am alone.  And now I have only one
thing to do: not to get caught up into the world's cog-wheels any
more, and not to lose my hold on the hidden greater thing.</p>

<p>She was tired with a strange weariness, feeling she could make no
further effort.  She woke up at tea-time, but there was no tea.
Juana hastened off to the hotel to buy a bit.</p>

<p>Juana was a woman of about forty, rather short, with full dark
face, centreless dark eyes, untidy hair, and a limping way of
walking.  She spoke rapidly, a rather plum-in-the-mouth Spanish,
adding 'n' to all her words.  Something of a sloven, down to her
speech.</p>

<p>'No, Ni&ntilde;a, no hay masn' - masn instead of mas.  And calling Kate, in
the old Mexican style, Ni&ntilde;a, which means child.  It is the
honourable title for a mistress.</p>

<p>Juana was going to be a bit of a trial.  She was a widow of
doubtful antecedents, a creature with passion, but not much
control, strong with a certain indifference and looseness.  The
hotel owner assured Kate that she was honest, but that if Kate
would rather find another criada, all well and good.</p>

<p>There was a bit of a battle to be fought between the two women.
Juana was obstinate and reckless; she had not been treated very
well by the world.  And there was a touch of bottom-dog insolence
about her.</p>

<p>But also, sudden touches of passionate warmth and the peculiar
selfless generosity of the natives.  She would be honest out of
rough defiance and indifference, so long as she was not in a state
of antagonism.</p>

<p>As yet, however, she was cautiously watching her ground, with that
black-eyed touch of malice and wariness to be expected.  And Kate
felt that the cry:  Ni&ntilde;a - child! by which she was addressed, held
in it a slight note of malevolent mockery.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to do but to go ahead and trust the dark-
faced, centreless woman.</p>

<p>The second day, Kate had the energy to cast out one suite of bent-
wood and cane furniture from her salon, remove pictures and little
stands.</p>

<p>If there is one social instinct more dreary than all the other
social instincts in the world, it is the Mexican.  In the centre of
Kate's red-tiled salon were two crescents: a black bent-wood cane
settee flanked on each side by two black bent-wood cane chairs,
exactly facing a brown bent-wood cane settee flanked on each side
by two brown bent-wood cane chairs.  It was as if the two settees
and the eight chairs were occupied by the ghosts of all the Mexican
banalities ever uttered, sitting facing one another with their
knees towards one another, and their feet on the terrible piece of
green-with-red-roses carpet, in the weary centre of the salon.  The
very sight of it was frightening.</p>

<p>Kate shattered this face-to-face symmetry, and had the two girls,
Maria and Concha, assisted by the ironic Juana, carrying off the
brown bent-wood chairs and the bamboo stands into one of the spare
bedrooms.  Juana looked on cynically, and assisted officiously.
But when Kate had her trunk, and fished out a couple of light rugs
and a couple of fine shawls and a few things to make the place
human, the criada began to exclaim:  'Qu&eacute; bonita!  Qu&eacute; bonita,
Ni&ntilde;a!  Mire que bonita!'</p>
