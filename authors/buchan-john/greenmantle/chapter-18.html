<p>"I’ve often regretted," said Blenkiron, "that miracles have left
off happening."</p>

<p>He got no answer, for I was feeling the walls for something in
the nature of a window.</p>

<p>"For I reckon," he went on, "that it wants a good old-fashioned
copper-bottomed miracle to get us out of this fix. It’s plumb
against all my principles. I’ve spent my life using the talents
God gave me to keep things from getting to the point of rude violence,
and so far I’ve succeeded. But now you come along, Major, and
you hustle a respectable middle-aged citizen into an aboriginal
mix-up. It’s mighty indelicate. I reckon the next move is up to
you, for I’m no good at the housebreaking stunt."</p>

<p>"No more am I," I answered; "but I’m hanged if I’ll chuck up
the sponge. Sandy’s somewhere outside, and he’s got a hefty crowd
at his heels."</p>

<p>I simply could not feel the despair which by every law of common
sense was due to the case. The guns had intoxicated me. I could
still hear their deep voices, though yards of wood and stone separated
us from the upper air.</p>

<p>What vexed us most was our hunger. Barring a few mouthfuls on
the road we had eaten nothing since the morning, and as our diet
for the past days had not been generous we had some leeway to
make up. Stumm had never looked near us since we were shoved into
the car. We had been brought to some kind of house and bundled
into a place like a wine-cellar. It was pitch dark, and after
feeling round the walls, first on my feet and then on Peter’s
back, I decided that there were no windows. It must have been
lit and ventilated by some lattice in the ceiling. There was not
a stick of furniture in the place: nothing but a damp earth floor
and bare stone sides, The door was a relic of the Iron Age, and
I could hear the paces of a sentry outside it.</p>

<p>When things get to the pass that nothing you can do can better
them, the only thing is to live for the moment. All three of us
sought in sleep a refuge from our empty stomachs. The floor was
the poorest kind of bed, but we rolled up our coats for pillows
and made the best of it. Soon I knew by Peter’s regular breathing
that he was asleep, and I presently followed him ...</p>

<p>I was awakened by a pressure below my left ear. I thought it
was Peter, for it is the old hunter’s trick of waking a man so
that he makes no noise. But another voice spoke. It told me that
there was no time to lose and to rise and follow, and the voice
was the voice of Hussin.</p>

<p>Peter was awake, and we stirred Blenkiron out of heavy slumber.
We were bidden take off our boots and hang them by their laces
round our necks as country boys do when they want to go barefoot.
Then we tiptoed to the door, which was ajar.</p>

<p>Outside was a passage with a flight of steps at one end which
led to the open air. On these steps lay a faint shine of starlight,
and by its help I saw a man huddled up at the foot of them. It
was our sentry, neatly and scientifically gagged and tied up.</p>

<p>The steps brought us to a little courtyard about which the walls
of the houses rose like cliffs. We halted while Hussin listened
intently. Apparently the coast was clear and our guide led us
to one side, which was clothed by a stout wooden trellis. Once
it may have supported fig-trees, but now the plants were dead
and only withered tendrils and rotten stumps remained.</p>

<p>It was child’s play for Peter and me to go up that trellis, but
it was the deuce and all for Blenkiron. He was in poor condition
and puffed like a grampus, and he seemed to have no sort of head
for heights. But he was as game as a buffalo, and started in gallantly
till his arms gave out and he fairly stuck. So Peter and I went
up on each side of him, taking an arm apiece, as I had once seen
done to a man with vertigo in the Kloof Chimney on Table Mountain.
I was mighty thankful when I got him panting on the top and Hussin
had shinned up beside us.</p>

<p>We crawled along a broadish wall, with an inch or two of powdery
snow on it, and then up a sloping buttress on to the flat roof
of the house. It was a miserable business for Blenkiron, who would
certainly have fallen if he could have seen what was below him,
and Peter and I had to stand to attention all the time. Then began
a more difficult job. Hussin pointed out a ledge which took us
past a stack of chimneys to another building slightly lower, this
being the route he fancied. At that I sat down resolutely and
put on my boots, and the others followed. Frost-bitten feet would
be a poor asset in this kind of travelling.</p>

<p>It was a bad step for Blenkiron, and we only got him past it
by Peter and I spread-eagling ourselves against the wall and passing
him in front of us with his face towards us. We had no grip, and
if he had stumbled we should all three have been in the courtyard.
But we got it over, and dropped as softly as possible on to the
roof of the next house. Hussin had his finger on his lips, and
I soon saw why. For there was a lighted window in the wall we
had descended.</p>

<p>Some imp prompted me to wait behind and explore. The others followed
Hussin and were soon at the far end of the roof, where a kind
of wooden pavilion broke the line, while I tried to get a look
inside. The window was curtained, and had two folding sashes which
clasped in the middle. Through a gap in the curtain I saw a little
lamp-lit room and a big man sitting at a table littered with papers.</p>

<p>I watched him, fascinated, as he turned to consult some document
and made a marking on the map before him. Then he suddenly rose,
stretched himself, cast a glance at the window, and went out of
the room, making a great clatter in descending the wooden staircase.
He left the door ajar and the lamp burning.</p>

<p>I guessed he had gone to have a look at his prisoners, in which
case the show was up. But what filled my mind was an insane desire
to get a sight of his map. It was one of those mad impulses which
utterly cloud right reason, a thing independent of any plan, a
crazy leap in the dark. But it was so strong that I would have
pulled that window out by its frame, if need be, to get to that
table.</p>

<p>There was no need, for the flimsy clasp gave at the first pull,
and the sashes swung open. I scrambled in, after listening for
steps on the stairs. I crumpled up the map and stuck it in my
pocket, as well as the paper from which I had seen him copying.
Very carefully I removed all marks of my entry, brushed away the
snow from the boards, pulled back the curtain, got out and refastened
the window. Still there was no sound of his return. Then I started
off to catch up the others.</p>

<p>I found them shivering in the roof pavilion. "We’ve got to move
pretty fast," I said, "for I’ve just been burgling old Stumm’s
private cabinet. Hussin, my lad, d’you hear that? They may be
after us any moment, so I pray Heaven we soon strike better going."</p>

<p>Hussin understood. He led us at a smart pace from one roof to
another, for here they were all of the same height, and only low
parapets and screens divided them. We never saw a soul, for a
winter’s night is not the time you choose to saunter on your housetop.
I kept my ears open for trouble behind us, and in about five minutes
I heard it. A riot of voices broke out, with one louder than the
rest, and, looking back, I saw lanterns waving. Stumm had realized
his loss and found the tracks of the thief.</p>

<p>Hussin gave one glance behind and then hurried us on at break-neck
pace, with old Blenkiron gasping and stumbling. The shouts behind
us grew louder, as if some eye quicker than the rest had caught
our movement in the starlit darkness. It was very evident that
if they kept up the chase we should be caught, for Blenkiron was
about as useful on a roof as a hippo.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a big drop, with a kind of ladder down it,
and at the foot a shallow ledge running to the left into a pit
of darkness. Hussin gripped my arm and pointed down it. "Follow
it," he whispered, "and you will reach a roof which spans a street.
Cross it, and on the other side is a mosque. Turn to the right
there and you will find easy going for fifty metres, well screened
from the higher roofs. For Allah’s sake keep in the shelter of
the screen. Somewhere there I will join you."</p>

<p>He hurried us along the ledge for a bit and then went back, and
with snow from the corners covered up our tracks. After that he
went straight on himself, taking strange short steps like a bird.
I saw his game. He wanted to lead our pursuers after him, and
he had to multiply the tracks and trust to Stumm’s fellows not
spotting that they all were made by one man.</p>

<p>But I had quite enough to think of in getting Blenkiron along
that ledge. He was pretty nearly foundered, he was in a sweat
of terror, and as a matter of fact he was taking one of the biggest
risks of his life, for we had no rope and his neck depended on
himself. I could hear him invoking some unknown deity called Holy
Mike. But he ventured gallantly, and we got to the roof which
ran across the street. That was easier, though ticklish enough,
but it was no joke skirting the cupola of that infernal mosque.
At last we found the parapet and breathed more freely, for we
were now under shelter from the direction of danger. I spared
a moment to look round, and thirty yards off, across the street,
I saw a weird spectacle.</p>

<p>The hunt was proceeding along the roofs parallel to the one we
were lodged on. I saw the flicker of the lanterns, waved up and
down as the bearers slipped in the snow, and I heard their cries
like hounds on a trail. Stumm was not among them: he had not the
shape for that sort of business. They passed us and continued
to our left, now hid by a jutting chimney, now clear to view against
the sky line. The roofs they were on were perhaps six feet higher
than ours, so even from our shelter we could mark their course.
If Hussin were going to be hunted across Erzerum it was a bad
look-out for us, for I hadn’t the foggiest notion where we were
or where we were going to.</p>

<p>But as we watched we saw something more. The wavering lanterns
were now three or four hundred yards away, but on the roofs just
opposite us across the street there appeared a man’s figure. I
thought it was one of the hunters, and we all crouched lower,
and then I recognized the lean agility of Hussin. He must have
doubled back, keeping in the dusk to the left of the pursuit,
and taking big risks in the open places. But there he was now,
exactly in front of us, and separated only by the width of the
narrow street.</p>

<p>He took a step backward, gathered himself for a spring, and leaped
clean over the gap. Like a cat he lighted on the parapet above
us, and stumbled forward with the impetus right on our heads.</p>

<p>"We are safe for the moment," he whispered, "but when they miss
me they will return. We must make good haste."</p>

<p>The next half-hour was a maze of twists and turns, slipping down
icy roofs and climbing icier chimney-stacks. The stir of the city
had gone, and from the black streets below came scarcely a sound.
But always the great tattoo of guns beat in the east. Gradually
we descended to a lower level, till we emerged on the top of a
shed in a courtyard. Hussin gave an odd sort of cry, like a demented
owl, and something began to stir below us.</p>

<p>It was a big covered wagon, full of bundles of forage, and drawn
by four mules. As we descended from the shed into the frozen litter
of the yard, a man came out of the shade and spoke low to Hussin.
Peter and I lifted Blenkiron into the cart, and scrambled in beside
him, and I never felt anything more blessed than the warmth and
softness of that place after the frosty roofs. I had forgotten
all about my hunger, and only yearned for sleep. Presently the
wagon moved out of the courtyard into the dark streets.</p>

<p>Then Blenkiron began to laugh, a deep internal rumble which shook
him violently and brought down a heap of forage on his head. I
thought it was hysterics, the relief from the tension of the past
hour. But it wasn’t. His body might be out of training, but there
was never anything the matter with his nerves. He was consumed
with honest merriment.</p>

<p>"Say, Major," he gasped, "I don’t usually cherish dislikes for
my fellow men, but somehow I didn’t cotton to Colonel Stumm. But
now I almost love him. You hit his jaw very bad in Germany, and
now you’ve annexed his private file, and I guess it’s important
or he wouldn’t have been so mighty set on steeple-chasing over
those roofs. I haven’t done such a thing since I broke into neighbour
Brown’s woodshed to steal his tame "possum, and that’s forty years
back. It’s the first piece of genooine amusement I’ve struck in
this game, and I haven’t laughed so much since old Jim Hooker
told the tale of ‘Cousin Sally Dillard’ when we were hunting ducks
in Michigan and his wife’s brother had an apoplexy in the night
and died of it."</p>

<p>To the accompaniment of Blenkiron’s chuckles I did what Peter
had done in the first minute, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I woke it was still dark. The wagon had stopped in a courtyard
which seemed to be shaded by great trees. The snow lay deeper
here, and by the feel of the air we had left the city and climbed
to higher ground. There were big buildings on one side, and on
the other what looked like the lift of a hill. No lights were
shown, the place was in profound gloom, but I felt the presence
near me of others besides Hussin and the driver.</p>

<p>We were hurried, Blenkiron only half awake, into an outbuilding,
and then down some steps to a roomy cellar. There Hussin lit a
lantern, which showed what had once been a storehouse for fruit.
Old husks still strewed the floor and the place smelt of apples.
Straw had been piled in corners for beds, and there was a rude
table and a divan of boards covered with sheepskins.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" I asked Hussin.</p>

<p>"In the house of the Master," he said. "You will be safe here,
but you must keep still till the Master comes."</p>

<p>"Is the Frankish lady here?" I asked.</p>

<p>Hussin nodded, and from a wallet brought out some food—raisins
and cold meat and a loaf of bread. We fell on it like vultures,
and as we ate Hussin disappeared. I noticed that he locked the
door behind him.</p>

<p>As soon as the meal was ended the others returned to their interrupted
sleep. But I was wakeful now and my mind was sharp-set on many
things. I got Blenkiron’s electric torch and lay down on the divan
to study Stumm’s map.</p>

<p>The first glance showed me that I had lit on a treasure. It was
the staff map of the Erzerum defences, showing the forts and the
field trenches, with little notes scribbled in Stumm’s neat small
handwriting. I got out the big map which I had taken from Blenkiron,
and made out the general lie of the land. I saw the horseshoe
of Deve Boyun to the east which the Russian guns were battering.
Stumm’s was just like the kind of squared artillery map we used
in France, 1 in 10,000, with spidery red lines showing the trenches,
but with the difference that it was the Turkish trenches that
were shown in detail and the Russian only roughly indicated. The
thing was really a confidential plan of the whole Erzerum <em>enceinte</em>,
and would be worth untold gold to the enemy. No wonder Stumm had
been in a wax at its loss.</p>

<p>The Deve Boyun lines seemed to me monstrously strong, and I remembered
the merits of the Turk as a fighter behind strong defences. It
looked as if Russia were up against a second Plevna or a new Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Then I took to studying the flanks. South lay the Palantuken
range of mountains, with forts defending the passes, where ran
the roads to Mush and Lake Van. That side, too, looked pretty
strong. North in the valley of the Euphrates I made out two big
forts, Tafta and Kara Gubek, defending the road from Olti. On
this part of the map Stumm’s notes were plentiful, and I gave
them all my attention. I remembered Blenkiron’s news about the
Russians advancing on a broad front, for it was clear that Stumm
was taking pains about the flank of the fortress.</p>

<p>Kara Gubek was the point of interest. It stood on a rib of land
between two peaks, which from the contour lines rose very steep.
So long as it was held it was clear that no invader could move
down the Euphrates glen. Stumm had appended a note to the peaks—"<em>not
fortified</em>"; and about two miles to the north-east there was
a red cross and the name "<em>Prjevalsky</em>". I assumed that
to be the farthest point yet reached by the right wing of the
Russian attack.</p>

<p>Then I turned to the paper from which Stumm had copied the jottings
on to his map. It was typewritten, and consisted of notes on different
points. One was headed "<em>Kara Gubek</em>" and read: "<em>No
time to fortify adjacent peaks. Difficult for enemy to get batteries
there, but not impossible. This the real point of danger, for
if Prjevalsky wins the peaks Kara Gubek and Tafta must fall, and
enemy will be on left rear of Deve Boyun main position</em>."</p>

<p>I was soldier enough to see the tremendous importance of this
note. On Kara Gubek depended the defence of Erzerum, and it was
a broken reed if one knew where the weakness lay. Yet, searching
the map again, I could not believe that any mortal commander would
see any chance in the adjacent peaks, even if he thought them
unfortified. That was information confined to the Turkish and
German staff. But if it could be conveyed to the Grand Duke he
would have Erzerum in his power in a day. Otherwise he would go
on battering at the Deve Boyun ridge for weeks, and long ere he
won it the Gallipoli divisions would arrive, he would be out-numbered
by two to one, and his chance would have vanished.</p>

<p>My discovery set me pacing up and down that cellar in a perfect
fever of excitement. I longed for wireless, a carrier pigeon,
an aeroplane—anything to bridge over that space of half a dozen
miles between me and the Russian lines. It was maddening to have
stumbled on vital news and to be wholly unable to use it. How
could three fugitives in a cellar, with the whole hornet’s nest
of Turkey and Germany stirred up against them, hope to send this
message of life and death?</p>

<p>I went back to the map and examined the nearest Russian positions.
They were carefully marked. Prjevalsky in the north, the main
force beyond Deve Boyun, and the southern columns up to the passes
of the Palantuken but not yet across them. I could not know which
was nearest to us till I discovered where we were. And as I thought
of this I began to see the rudiments of a desperate plan. It depended
on Peter, now slumbering like a tired dog on a couch of straw.</p>

<p>Hussin had locked the door and I must wait for information till
he came back. But suddenly I noticed a trap in the roof, which
had evidently been used for raising and lowering the cellar’s
stores. It looked ill-fitting and might be unbarred, so I pulled
the table below it, and found that with a little effort I could
raise the flap. I knew I was taking immense risks, but I was so
keen on my plan that I disregarded them. After some trouble I
got the thing prised open, and catching the edges of the hole
with my fingers raised my body and got my knees on the edge.</p>

<p>It was the outbuilding of which our refuge was the cellar, and
it was half filled with light. Not a soul was there, and I hunted
about till I found what I wanted. This was a ladder leading to
a sort of loft, which in turn gave access to the roof. Here I
had to be very careful, for I might be overlooked from the high
buildings. But by good luck there was a trellis for grape vines
across the place, which gave a kind of shelter. Lying flat on
my face I stared over a great expanse of country.</p>

<p>Looking north I saw the city in a haze of morning smoke, and,
beyond, the plain of the Euphrates and the opening of the glen
where the river left the hills. Up there, among the snowy heights,
were Tafta and Kara Gubek. To the east was the ridge of Deve Boyun,
where the mist was breaking before the winter’s sun. On the roads
up to it I saw transport moving, I saw the circle of the inner
forts, but for a moment the guns were silent. South rose a great
wall of white mountain, which I took to be the Palantuken. I could
see the roads running to the passes, and the smoke of camps and
horse-lines right under the cliffs.</p>

<p>I had learned what I needed. We were in the outbuildings of a
big country house two or three miles south of the city. The nearest
point of the Russian front was somewhere in the foothills of the
Palantuken.</p>

<p>As I descended I heard, thin and faint and beautiful, like the
cry of a wild bird, the muezzin from the minarets of Erzerum.</p>

<p>When I dropped through the trap the others were awake. Hussin
was setting food on the table, and viewing my descent with anxious
disapproval.</p>

<p>"It’s all right," I said; "I won’t do it again, for I’ve found
out all I wanted. Peter, old man, the biggest job of your life
is before you!"</p>
