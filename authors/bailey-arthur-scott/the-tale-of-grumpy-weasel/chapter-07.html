<p>Sometimes Grumpy Weasel found the hunting poor along the stretch of
stone wall that he called his own--though of course it really belonged
to Farmer Green. And though he disliked to wander much in strange
neighborhoods, once in a while he visited other parts of Pleasant
Valley.
</p>
<p>It was on such an excursion to the bank of the mill pond that he caught
sight, one day, of Paddy Muskrat--or to be more exact, that Paddy
Muskrat caught sight of him.
</p><p>Now it was seldom that anybody spoke to Grumpy Weasel. On the contrary,
most of the forest-folk dodged out of sight whenever they saw him, and
said nothing. So he wheeled like a flash and started to run when
somebody called, "Hullo, stranger!"
</p><p>One quick backward glance at a small wet head in the water told Grumpy
that he had nothing to fear.
</p><p>"Hullo, yourself!" he retorted "And you'd better not call me 'stranger,'
because I'm no stranger than you are."
</p><p>Well, Paddy Muskrat--for it was he who had spied Grumpy Weasel on the
bank of the pond--saw at once that whoever the slender and elegant
person might be, he had the worst of manners. Though Paddy had lived in
the mill pond a long time, he had never met any one that looked exactly
like the newcomer. To be sure, there was Peter Mink, who was
long-bodied and short-tempered, as the stranger appeared to be. But
when Paddy inquired whether the visitor wasn't a distant connection of
the Mink family (as indeed he was!), Grumpy Weasel said, "What! Do you
mean to insult me by asking whether I'm related to such a ragged,
ruffianly crowd?"
</p><p>Somehow Paddy Muskrat rather liked that answer, for Peter Mink and all
his family were fine swimmers and most unwelcome in the mill pond.
</p><p>And perhaps--who knew?--perhaps the spic-and-span chap on the bank, with
the sleek coat and black-tipped tail, was one of the kind that didn't
like to get his feet wet.
</p><p>Then Paddy Muskrat asked the stranger a silly question. He was not the
wisest person, anyhow, in Pleasant Valley, as his wife often reminded
him. "You're not a distant relation of Tommy Fox, are you?" he
inquired.
</p><p>Grumpy Weasel actually almost smiled.
</p><p>"Now, how did you happen to guess that?" he asked.
</p><p>"Because you've got such a sharp nose," Paddy Muskrat replied. And he
was quite pleased with himself, for he thought that he wasn't so stupid
as some people thought.
</p><p>"Any other reason?" Grumpy Weasel inquired, stepping to the edge of the
overhanging bank.
</p><p>"You don't like to get your feet wet," Paddy Muskrat said. And feeling
safe as anything, he swam nearer the spot where the stranger was
crouching.
</p><p>Paddy saw, almost too late, that he had made a bad blunder. For without
the slightest warning Grumpy Weasel leaped at him. And had not Paddy
been a wonderful swimmer and able to dive like a flash, he would never
have dashed, panting, into his house a few moments later.
</p><p>"What on earth is the matter?" his wife asked him.
</p><p>"I've been having a swimming race with a stranger," Paddy explained. "I
don't know his name. But I do know that he'd just as soon get his feet
wet as I would."
</p><p>"Well, why not?" Mrs. Muskrat inquired. "That only shows he's sensible."
</p><p>"Does it show I'm sensible, too?" Paddy asked her.
</p><p>"Certainly not!" said Mrs. Muskrat.
