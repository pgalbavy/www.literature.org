<p>The almost interminable night came to an end at last and the
dull gray of morning appeared in the east.</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry chafed the arms of the little stranger, and even
slapped her vigorously to prevent her succumbing to the cold.
He was forced to rise to his feet himself at intervals and swing
his arms and kick out his legs, to fight off the chilliness which
seemed to penetrate to his very bones.</p>

<p>As soon as the boy could make use of his eyes he found himself
drifting through the open country, where the river was fully double
the width at Damietta. This gave the masses of ice much more "elbow
room," and decreased the danger of capsizing.</p>

<p>Houses and villages were seen at intervals, and multitudes of
people were along the bank gathering driftwood and "loot," and
watching the unparalleled flood of waters.</p>

<p>Ben swung his hat and shouted, and at last caught the notice
of the people on the bank. Two sturdy watermen sprang into a boat
and began fighting their way out to the helpless ones. It was
a hard task, but they succeeded, and Ben and little Dolly Willard
(as she had given her name) were safely taken off. A crowd waited
to welcome them and they received every possible attention. Both
were taken to the nearest farmhouse, where a kind-hearted mother
took Dolly in charge, for the little one needed it sadly enough.</p>

<p>They were within half a mile of a village which was connected
with Damietta by telegraph, and before Ben would do anything more
than swallow a cup of hot coffee, and change his clothing, he
was driven to the office, where he sent the message which was
the first word we received in Damietta to tell us that he was
alive.</p>

<p>I lost no time in hurrying to the humble dwelling of Mrs. Mayberry,
where I made known the joyful tidings. I shall never forget the
holy light which illumined the thin face as she clasped her hands
in thankfulness and said:</p>

<p>"I had not given up all hope, but I was very near doing so."</p>

<p>Ben was driven into Damietta late that afternoon, where a royal
welcome awaited him. He was cheered, shaken by the hand, and congratulated
over and over again, and for a time it looked as though he would
be pulled asunder. When he finally tore himself loose and rushed
into our office, the operators and messenger boys were equally
demonstrative, but he did not mind them.</p>

<p>I stood at my desk with a swelling heart, waiting for him. Suddenly
he turned and caught my hand.</p>

<p>"He that is born to be hanged will never be drowned&#11834;"</p>

<p>He was laughing when he spoke the jest, but his voice trembled,
and all at once he broke down. Quickly withdrawing both hands,
he put them over his face and cried like a heartbroken child.
He had stood it like a hero to this point, but now, with the crowd
outside peering into the windows, he sobbed with uncontrollable
emotion, while my own heart was too full to speak.</p>

<p>As soon as he could master himself he said:</p>

<p>"I must not wait any longer; mother expects me."</p>

<p>He was out of the door in a twinkling, and in a few minutes the
mother and son were in each other's arms.</p>

<p>The reader may think that the most remarkable part of Ben Mayberry's
adventure on the night of the flood has already been told, but
it proved to be the beginning of a train of incidents of such
an extraordinary nature that I hasten to make them known. There
was a direct connection between his experience on that terrible
night in February and the wonderful mystery in which he became
involved, and which exercised such a marked influence on his after-life.</p>

<p>Fortunately, little Dolly Willard suffered no serious consequences
from her frightful shock and exposure. She received such excellent
care that she speedily recovered, and as soon as we could re-establish
communication with Moorestown and engage her in conversation,
we learned something of her history.</p>

<p>She lived in New York City and had come to Moorestown on a visit
with her mother and Uncle George. He was the G. R. Burkhill who
failed to receive the cipher dispatch which Ben Mayberry undertook
to deliver to him on that eventful night.</p>

<p>Dolly said her father was dead, or had been gone from home a
very long time. Uncle George claimed and took her to the city,
first sending a cipher dispatch to a party in the metropolis,
and directing me, in case of an answer, to hold it until he called
or sent for it.</p>

<p>Two days later an answer arrived in the same mystic characters
as before. As it has much to do with the incidents which follow,
I give this remarkable telegram in full:</p>

"New York, February 28th,&#11834;

<p>"George R. Burkhill, Moorestown:</p>

"Tom."

</p>
</div>
<p>Cipher telegrams are sent every day in the week, and we did not
concern ourselves with this particular one, which would have received
no further thought, but for an odd circumstance.</p>

<p>On the day Mr. Burkhill sent his message to New York, he was
followed into our office by a man who was shabbily dressed, and
who impressed me as what is commonly called a "beat." He spoiled
several blanks without sending a message and then abruptly tore
them up, put the pieces in his pocket, and walked out after Mr.
Burkhill.</p>

<p>He was in the office several times the succeeding two days, made
some inquiries, and sent off a couple of messages. Just after
Ben Mayberry had received the cipher telegram given above, I happened
to look across my desk and observed that the fellow had taken
every letter, marking it down, as he easily interpreted it by
sound.</p>

<p>It was only by accident that I made this discovery, for the man
acted precisely as if he were preparing a message to send away.</p>
