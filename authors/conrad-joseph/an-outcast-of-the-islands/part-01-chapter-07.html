<p>There are in our lives short periods which hold no place in memory
but only as the recollection of a feeling. There is no remembrance
of gesture, of action, of any outward manifestation of life; those
are lost in the unearthly brilliance or in the unearthly gloom
of such moments. We are absorbed in the contemplation of that
something, within our bodies, which rejoices or suffers while
the body goes on breathing, instinctively runs away or, not less
instinctively, fights&mdash;perhaps dies. But death in such a moment
is the privilege of the fortunate, it is a high and rare favour,
a supreme grace.</p>

<p>Willems never remembered how and when he parted from Aissa. He
caught himself drinking the muddy water out of the hollow of his
hand, while his canoe was drifting in mid-stream past the last
houses of Sambir. With his returning wits came the fear of something
unknown that had taken possession of his heart, of something inarticulate
and masterful which could not speak and would be obeyed. His first
impulse was that of revolt. He would never go back there. Never!
He looked round slowly at the brilliance of things in the deadly
sunshine and took up his paddle! How changed everything seemed!
The river was broader, the sky was higher. How fast the canoe
flew under the strokes of his paddle! Since when had he acquired
the strength of two men or more? He looked up and down the reach
at the forests of the bank with a confused notion that with one
sweep of his hand he could tumble all these trees into the stream.
His face felt burning. He drank again, and shuddered with a depraved
sense of pleasure at the after-taste of slime in the water.</p>

<p>It was late when he reached Almayer’s house, but he crossed the
dark and uneven courtyard, walking lightly in the radiance of
some light of his own, invisible to other eyes. His host’s sulky
greeting jarred him like a sudden fall down a great height. He
took his place at the table opposite Almayer and tried to speak
cheerfully to his gloomy companion, but when the meal was ended
and they sat smoking in silence he felt an abrupt discouragement,
a lassitude in all his limbs, a sense of immense sadness as after
some great and irreparable loss. The darkness of the night entered
his heart, bringing with it doubt and hesitation and dull anger
with himself and all the world. He had an impulse to shout horrible
curses, to quarrel with Almayer, to do something violent. Quite
without any immediate provocation he thought he would like to
assault the wretched, sulky beast. He glanced at him ferociously
from under his eyebrows. The unconscious Almayer smoked thoughtfully,
planning to-morrow’s work probably. The man’s composure seemed
to Willems an unpardonable insult. Why didn’t that idiot talk
to-night when he wanted him to? . . . on other nights he was ready
enough to chatter. And such dull nonsense too! And Willems, trying
hard to repress his own senseless rage, looked fixedly through
the thick tobacco-smoke at the stained tablecloth.</p>

<p>They retired early, as usual, but in the middle of the night
Willems leaped out of his hammock with a stifled execration and
ran down the steps into the courtyard. The two night watchmen,
who sat by a little fire talking together in a monotonous undertone,
lifted their heads to look wonderingly at the discomposed features
of the white man as he crossed the circle of light thrown out
by their fire. He disappeared in the darkness and then came back
again, passing them close, but with no sign of consciousness of
their presence on his face. Backwards and forwards he paced, muttering
to himself, and the two Malays, after a short consultation in
whispers left the fire quietly, not thinking it safe to remain
in the vicinity of a white man who behaved in such a strange manner.
They retired round the corner of the godown and watched Willems
curiously through the night, till the short daybreak was followed
by the sudden blaze of the rising sun, and Almayer’s establishment
woke up to life and work.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get away unnoticed in the bustle of the busy
riverside, Willems crossed the river on his way to the place where
he had met Aissa. He threw himself down in the grass by the side
of the brook and listened for the sound of her footsteps. The
brilliant light of day fell through the irregular opening in the
high branches of the trees and streamed down, softened, amongst
the shadows of big trunks. Here and there a narrow sunbeam touched
the rugged bark of a tree with a golden splash, sparkled on the
leaping water of the brook, or rested on a leaf that stood out,
shimmering and distinct, on the monotonous background of sombre
green tints. The clear gap of blue above his head was crossed
by the quick flight of white rice-birds whose wings flashed in
the sunlight, while through it the heat poured down from the sky,
clung about the steaming earth, rolled among the trees, and wrapped
up Willems in the soft and odorous folds of air heavy with the
faint scent of blossoms and with the acrid smell of decaying life.
And in that atmosphere of Nature’s workshop Willems felt soothed
and lulled into forgetfulness of his past, into indifference as
to his future. The recollections of his triumphs, of his wrongs
and of his ambition vanished in that warmth, which seemed to melt
all regrets, all hope, all anger, all strength out of his heart.
And he lay there, dreamily contented, in the tepid and perfumed
shelter, thinking of Aissa’s eyes; recalling the sound of her
voice, the quiver of her lips&mdash;her frowns and her smile.</p>

<p>She came, of course. To her he was something new, unknown and
strange. He was bigger, stronger than any man she had seen before,
and altogether different from all those she knew. He was of the
victorious race. With a vivid remembrance of the great catastrophe
of her life he appeared to her with all the fascination of a great
and dangerous thing; of a terror vanquished, surmounted, made
a plaything of. They spoke with just such a deep voice&mdash;those
victorious men; they looked with just such hard blue eyes at their
enemies. And she made that voice speak softly to her, those eyes
look tenderly at her face! He was indeed a man. She could not
understand all he told her of his life, but the fragments she
understood she made up for herself into a story of a man great
amongst his own people, valorous and unfortunate; an undaunted
fugitive dreaming of vengeance against his enemies. He had all
the attractiveness of the vague and the unknown&mdash;of the unforeseen
and of the sudden; of a being strong, dangerous, alive, and human,
ready to be enslaved.</p>

<p>She felt that he was ready. She felt it with the unerring intuition
of a primitive woman confronted by a simple impulse. Day after
day, when they met and she stood a little way off, listening to
his words, holding him with her look, the undefined terror of
the new conquest became faint and blurred like the memory of a
dream, and the certitude grew distinct, and convincing, and visible
to the eyes like some material thing in full sunlight. It was
a deep joy, a great pride, a tangible sweetness that seemed to
leave the taste of honey on her lips. He lay stretched at her
feet without moving, for he knew from experience how a slight
movement of his could frighten her away in those first days of
their intercourse. He lay very quiet, with all the ardour of his
desire ringing in his voice and shining in his eyes, whilst his
body was still, like death itself. And he looked at her, standing
above him, her head lost in the shadow of broad and graceful leaves
that touched her cheek; while the slender spikes of pale green
orchids streamed down from amongst the boughs and mingled with
the black hair that framed her face, as if all those plants claimed
her for their own&mdash;the animated and brilliant flower of all that
exuberant life which, born in gloom, struggles for ever towards
the sunshine.</p>

<p>Every day she came a little nearer. He watched her slow progress&mdash;the
gradual taming of that woman by the words of his love. It was
the monotonous song of praise and desire that, commencing at creation,
wraps up the world like an atmosphere and shall end only in the
end of all things&mdash;when there are no lips to sing and no ears
to hear. He told her that she was beautiful and desirable, and
he repeated it again and again; for when he told her that, he
had said all there was within him&mdash;he had expressed his only thought,
his only feeling. And he watched the startled look of wonder and
mistrust vanish from her face with the passing days, her eyes
soften, the smile dwell longer and longer on her lips; a smile
as of one charmed by a delightful dream; with the slight exaltation
of intoxicating triumph lurking in its dawning tenderness.</p>

<p>And while she was near there was nothing in the whole world&mdash;for
that idle man&mdash;but her look and her smile. Nothing in the past,
nothing in the future; and in the present only the luminous fact
of her existence. But in the sudden darkness of her going he would
be left weak and helpless, as though despoiled violently of all
that was himself. He who had lived all his life with no preoccupation
but that of his own career, contemptuously indifferent to all
feminine influence, full of scorn for men that would submit to
it, if ever so little; he, so strong, so superior even in his
errors, realized at last that his very individuality was snatched
from within himself by the hand of a woman. Where was the assurance
and pride of his cleverness; the belief in success, the anger
of failure, the wish to retrieve his fortune, the certitude of
his ability to accomplish it yet? Gone. All gone. All that had
been a man within him was gone, and there remained only the trouble
of his heart&mdash;that heart which had become a contemptible thing;
which could be fluttered by a look or a smile, tormented by a
word, soothed by a promise.</p>

<p>When the longed-for day came at last, when she sank on the grass
by his side and with a quick gesture took his hand in hers, he
sat up suddenly with the movement and look of a man awakened by
the crash of his own falling house. All his blood, all his sensation,
all his life seemed to rush into that hand leaving him without
strength, in a cold shiver, in the sudden clamminess and collapse
as of a deadly gun-shot wound. He flung her hand away brutally,
like something burning, and sat motionless, his head fallen forward,
staring on the ground and catching his breath in painful gasps.
His impulse of fear and apparent horror did not dismay her in
the least. Her face was grave and her eyes looked seriously at
him. Her fingers touched the hair of his temple, ran in a light
caress down his cheek, twisted gently the end of his long moustache:
and while he sat in the tremor of that contact she ran off with
startling fleetness and disappeared in a peal of clear laughter,
in the stir of grass, in the nod of young twigs growing over the
path; leaving behind only a vanishing trail of motion and sound.</p>

<p>He scrambled to his feet slowly and painfully, like a man with
a burden on his shoulders, and walked towards the riverside. He
hugged to his breast the recollection of his fear and of his delight,
but told himself seriously over and over again that this must
be the end of that adventure. After shoving off his canoe into
the stream he lifted his eyes to the bank and gazed at it long
and steadily, as if taking his last look at a place of charming
memories. He marched up to Almayer’s house with the concentrated
expression and the determined step of a man who had just taken
a momentous resolution. His face was set and rigid, his gestures
and movements were guarded and slow. He was keeping a tight hand
on himself. A very tight hand. He had a vivid illusion&mdash;as vivid
as reality almost&mdash;of being in charge of a slippery prisoner.
He sat opposite Almayer during that dinner&mdash;which was their last
meal together&mdash;with a perfectly calm face and within him a growing
terror of escape from his own self.</p>

<p>Now and then he would grasp the edge of the table and set his
teeth hard in a sudden wave of acute despair, like one who, falling
down a smooth and rapid declivity that ends in a precipice, digs
his finger nails into the yielding surface and feels himself slipping
helplessly to inevitable destruction.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, came a relaxation of his muscles, the giving
way of his will. Something seemed to snap in his head, and that
wish, that idea kept back during all those hours, darted into
his brain with the heat and noise of a conflagration. He must
see her! See her at once! Go now! To-night! He had the raging
regret of the lost hour, of every passing moment. There was no
thought of resistance now. Yet with the instinctive fear of the
irrevocable, with the innate falseness of the human heart, he
wanted to keep open the way of retreat. He had never absented
himself during the night. What did Almayer know? What would Almayer
think? Better ask him for the gun. A moonlight night. . . . Look
for deer. . . . A colourable pretext. He would lie to Almayer.
What did it matter! He lied to himself every minute of his life.
And for what? For a woman. And such. . . .</p>

<p>Almayer’s answer showed him that deception was useless. Everything
gets to be known, even in this place. Well, he did not care. Cared
for nothing but for the lost seconds. What if he should suddenly
die. Die before he saw her. Before he could . . .</p>

<p>As, with the sound of Almayer’s laughter in his ears, he urged
his canoe in a slanting course across the rapid current, he tried
to tell himself that he could return at any moment. He would just
go and look at the place where they used to meet, at the tree
under which he lay when she took his hand, at the spot where she
sat by his side. Just go there and then return&mdash;nothing more;
but when his little skiff touched the bank he leaped out, forgetting
the painter, and the canoe hung for a moment amongst the bushes
and then swung out of sight before he had time to dash into the
water and secure it. He was thunderstruck at first. Now he could
not go back unless he called up the Rajah’s people to get a boat
and rowers&mdash;and the way to Patalolo’s campong led past Aissa’s
house!</p>

<p>He went up the path with the eager eyes and reluctant steps of
a man pursuing a phantom, and when he found himself at a place
where a narrow track branched off to the left towards Omar’s clearing
he stood still, with a look of strained attention on his face
as if listening to a far-off voice&mdash;the voice of his fate. It
was a sound inarticulate but full of meaning; and following it
there came a rending and tearing within his breast. He twisted
his fingers together, and the joints of his hands and arms cracked.
On his forehead the perspiration stood out in small pearly drops.
He looked round wildly. Above the shapeless darkness of the forest
undergrowth rose the treetops with their high boughs and leaves
standing out black on the pale sky&mdash;like fragments of night floating
on moonbeams. Under his feet warm steam rose from the heated earth.
Round him there was a great silence.</p>

<p>He was looking round for help. This silence, this immobility
of his surroundings seemed to him a cold rebuke, a stern refusal,
a cruel unconcern. There was no safety outside of himself&mdash;and
in himself there was no refuge; there was only the image of that
woman. He had a sudden moment of lucidity&mdash;of that cruel lucidity
that comes once in life to the most benighted. He seemed to see
what went on within him, and was horrified at the strange sight.
He, a white man whose worst fault till then had been a little
want of judgment and too much confidence in the rectitude of his
kind! That woman was a complete savage, and . . . He tried to
tell himself that the thing was of no consequence. It was a vain
effort. The novelty of the sensations he had never experienced
before in the slightest degree, yet had despised on hearsay from
his safe position of a civilized man, destroyed his courage. He
was disappointed with himself. He seemed to be surrendering to
a wild creature the unstained purity of his life, of his race,
of his civilization. He had a notion of being lost amongst shapeless
things that were dangerous and ghastly. He struggled with the
sense of certain defeat&mdash;lost his footing&mdash;fell back into the
darkness. With a faint cry and an upward throw of his arms he
gave up as a tired swimmer gives up: because the swamped craft
is gone from under his feet; because the night is dark and the
shore is far&mdash;because death is better than strife.</p>
