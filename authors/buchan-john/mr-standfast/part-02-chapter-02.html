<p>I looked up Eaucourt Sainte-Anne on the map, and the more I studied
its position the less I liked it. It was the knot from which sprang
all the main routes to our Picardy front. If the Boche ever broke
us, it was the place for which old Hindenburg would make. At all
hours troops and transport trains were moving through that insignificant
hamlet. Eminent generals and their staffs passed daily within
sight of the Château. It was a convenient halting-place for battalions
coming back to rest. Supposing, I argued, our enemies wanted a
key-spot for some assault upon the <em>morale</em> or the discipline
or health of the British Army, they couldn’t find a better than
Eaucourt Sainte-Anne. It was the ideal centre of espionage. But
when I guardedly sounded my friends of the Intelligence they didn’t
seem to be worrying about it.</p>

<p>From them I got a chit to the local French authorities, and,
as soon as we came out of the line, towards the end of December,
I made straight for the country town of Douvecourt. By a bit of
luck our divisional quarters were almost next door. I interviewed
a tremendous swell in a black uniform and black kid gloves, who
received me affably and put his archives and registers at my disposal.
By this time I talked French fairly well, having a natural turn
for languages, but half the rapid speech of the <em>sous-prefet</em>
was lost on me. By and by he left me with the papers and a clerk,
and I proceeded to grub up the history of the Château.</p>

<p>It had belonged since long before Agincourt to the noble house
of the D’Eaucourts, now represented by an ancient Marquise who
dwelt at Biarritz. She had never lived in the place, which a dozen
years before had been falling to ruins, when a rich American leased
it and partially restored it. He had soon got sick of it—his daughter
had married a blackguard French cavalry officer with whom he quarrelled,
said the clerk—and since then there had been several tenants.
I wondered why a house so unattractive should have let so readily,
but the clerk explained that the cause was the partridge-shooting.
It was about the best in France, and in 1912 had shown the record
bag.</p>

<p>The list of the tenants was before me. There was a second American,
an Englishman called Halford, a Paris Jew-banker, and an Egyptian
prince. But the space for 1913 was blank, and I asked the clerk
about it. He told me that it had been taken by a woollen manufacturer
from Lille, but he had never shot the partridges, though he had
spent occasional nights in the house. He had a five years’ lease,
and was still paying rent to the Marquise. I asked the name, but
the clerk had forgotten. "It will be written there," he said.</p>

<p>"But, no," I said. "Somebody must have been asleep over this
register. There’s nothing after 1912."</p>

<p>He examined the page and blinked his eyes. "Someone indeed must
have slept. No doubt it was young Louis who is now with the guns
in Champagne. But the name will be on the Commissary’s list. It
is, as I remember, a sort of Flemish."</p>

<p>He hobbled off and returned in five minutes.</p>

<p>"Bommaerts," he said, "Jacques Bommaerts. A young man with no
wife but with money—<em>Dieu de Dieu</em>, what oceans of it!"</p>

<p>That clerk got twenty-five francs, and he was cheap at the price.
I went back to my division with a sense of awe on me. It was a
marvellous fate that had brought me by odd routes to this out-of-the-way
corner. First, the accident of Hamilton’s seeing Gresson; then
the night in the Clearing Station; last the mishap of Archie’s
plane getting lost in the fog. I had three grounds of suspicion—Gresson’s
sudden illness, the Canadian’s ghost, and that horrid old woman
in the dusk. And now I had one tremendous fact. The place was
leased by a man called Bommaerts, and that was one of the two
names I had heard whispered in that far-away cleft in the Coolin
by the stranger from the sea.</p>

<p>A sensible man would have gone off to the <em>contre-espionage</em>
people and told them his story. I couldn’t do this; I felt that
it was my own private find and I was going to do the prospecting
myself. Every moment of leisure I had I was puzzling over the
thing. I rode round by the Château one frosty morning and examined
all the entrances. The main one was the grand avenue with the
locked gates. That led straight to the front of the house where
the terrace was—or you might call it the back, for the main door
was on the other side. Anyhow the drive came up to the edge of
the terrace and then split into two, one branch going to the stables
by way of the outbuildings where I had seen the old woman, the
other circling round the house, skirting the moat, and joining
the back road just before the bridge. If I had gone to the right
instead of the left that first evening with Archie, I should have
circumnavigated the place without any trouble.</p>

<p>Seen in the fresh morning light the house looked commonplace
enough. Part of it was as old as Noah, but most was newish and
jerry-built, the kind of flat-chested, thin French Château, all
front and no depth, and full of draughts and smoky chimneys. I
might have gone in and ransacked the place, but I knew I should
find nothing. It was borne in on me that it was only when evening
fell that that house was interesting and that I must come, like
Nicodemus, by night. Besides I had a private account to settle
with my conscience. I had funked the place in the foggy twilight,
and it does not do to let a matter like that slide. A man’s courage
is like a horse that refuses a fence; you have got to take him
by the head and cram him at it again. If you don’t, he will funk
worse next time. I hadn’t enough courage to be able to take chances
with it, though I was afraid of many things, the thing I feared
most mortally was being afraid.</p>

<p>I did not get a chance till Christmas Eve. The day before there
had been a fall of snow, but the frost set in and the afternoon
ended in a green sunset with the earth crisp and crackling like
a shark’s skin. I dined early, and took with me Geordie Hamilton,
who added to his many accomplishments that of driving a car. He
was the only man in the <em>B.E.F. </em>who guessed anything of
the game I was after, and I knew that he was as discreet as a
tombstone. I put on my oldest trench cap, slacks, and a pair of
scaife-soled boots, that I used to change into in the evening.
I had a useful little electric torch, which lived in my pocket,
and from which a cord led to a small bulb of light that worked
with a switch and could be hung on my belt. That left my arms
free in case of emergencies. Likewise I strapped on my pistol.</p>

<p>There was little traffic in the hamlet of Eaucourt Sainte-Anne
that night. Few cars were on the road, and the <em>M.T. </em>detachment,
judging from the din, seemed to be busy on a private spree. It
was about nine o’clock when we turned into the side road, and
at the entrance to it I saw a solid figure in khaki mounting guard
beside two bicycles. Something in the man’s gesture, as he saluted,
struck me as familiar, but I had no time to hunt for casual memories.
I left the car just short of the bridge, and took the road which
would bring me to the terraced front of the house.</p>

<p>Once I turned the corner of the Château and saw the long ghostly
façade white in the moonlight, I felt less confident. The eeriness
of the place smote me. In that still, snowy world it loomed up
immense and mysterious with its rows of shuttered windows, each
with that air which empty houses have of concealing some wild
story. I longed to have old Peter with me, for he was the man
for this kind of escapade. I had heard that he had been removed
to Switzerland and I pictured him now in some mountain village
where the snow lay deep. I would have given anything to have had
Peter with a whole leg by my side.</p>

<p>I stepped on the terrace and listened. There was not a sound
in the world, not even the distant rumble of a cart. The pile
towered above me like a mausoleum, and I reflected that it must
take some nerve to burgle an empty house. It would be good enough
fun to break into a bustling dwelling and pinch the plate when
the folk were at dinner, but to burgle emptiness and silence meant
a fight with the terrors in a man’s soul. It was worse in my case,
for I wasn’t cheered with prospects of loot. I wanted to get inside
chiefly to soothe my conscience.</p>

<p>I hadn’t much doubt I would find a way, for three years of war
and the frequent presence of untidy headquarters’ staffs have
loosened the joints of most Picardy houses. There’s generally
a window that doesn’t latch or a door that doesn’t bar. But I
tried window after window on the terrace without result. The heavy
green sun-shutters were down over each, and when I broke the hinges
of one there was a long bar within to hold it firm. I was beginning
to think of shinning up a rain-pipe and trying the second floor,
when a shutter I had laid hold on swung back in my hand. It had
been left unfastened, and, kicking the snow from my boots, I entered
a room.</p>

<p>A gleam of moonlight followed me and I saw I was in a big salon
with a polished wood floor and dark lumps of furniture swathed
in sheets. I clicked the bulb at my belt, and the little circle
of light showed a place which had not been dwelt in for years.
At the far end was another door, and as I tiptoed towards it something
caught my eye on the parquet. It was a piece of fresh snow like
that which clumps on the heel of a boot. I had not brought it
there. Some other visitor had passed this way, and not long before
me.</p>

<p>Very gently I opened the door and slipped in. In front of me
was a pile of furniture which made a kind of screen, and behind
that I halted and listened. There was somebody in the room. I
heard the sound of human breathing and soft movements; the man,
whoever he was, was at the far end from me, and though there was
a dim glow of Moon through a broken shutter I could see nothing
of what he was after. I was beginning to enjoy myself now. I knew
of his presence and he did not know of mine, and that is the sport
of stalking.</p>

<p>An unwary movement of my hand caused the screen to creak. Instantly
the movements ceased and there was utter silence. I held my breath,
and after a second or two the tiny sounds began again. I had a
feeling, though my eyes could not assure me, that the man before
me was at work, and was using a very small shaded torch. There
was just the faintest moving shimmer on the wall beyond, though
that might come from the crack of moonlight.</p>

<p>Apparently he was reassured, for his movements became more distinct.
There was a jar as if a table had been pushed back. Once more
there was silence, and I heard only the intake of breath. I have
very quick ears, and to me it sounded as if the man was rattled.
The breathing was quick and anxious.</p>

<p>Suddenly it changed and became the ghost of a whistle—the kind
of sound one makes with the lips and teeth without ever letting
the tune break out clear. We all do it when we are preoccupied
with something—shaving, or writing letters, or reading the newspaper.
But I did not think my man was preoccupied. He was whistling to
quiet fluttering nerves.</p>

<p>Then I caught the air. It was "Cherry Ripe".</p>

<p>In a moment, from being hugely at my ease, I became the nervous
one. I had been playing peep-bo with the unseen, and the tables
were turned. My heart beat against my ribs like a hammer. I shuffled
my feet, and again there fell the tense silence.</p>

<p>"Mary," I said—and the word seemed to explode like a bomb in
the stillness—"Mary! It’s me—Dick Hannay."</p>

<p>There was no answer but a sob and the sound of a timid step.</p>

<p>I took four paces into the darkness and caught in my arms a trembling
girl....</p>

<p>Often in the last months I had pictured the kind of scene which
would be the culminating point of my life. When our work was over
and war had been forgotten, somewhere—perhaps in a green Cotswold
meadow or in a room of an old manor—I would talk with Mary. By
that time we should know each other well and I would have lost
my shyness. I would try to tell her that I loved her, but whenever
I thought of what I should say my heart sank, for I knew I would
make a fool of myself. You can’t live my kind of life for forty
years wholly among men and be of any use at pretty speeches to
women. I knew I should stutter and blunder, and I used despairingly
to invent impossible situations where I might make my love plain
to her without words by some piece of melodramatic sacrifice.</p>

<p>But the kind Fates had saved me the trouble. Without a syllable
save Christian names stammered in that eerie darkness we had come
to complete understanding. The fairies had been at work unseen,
and the thoughts of each of us had been moving towards the other,
till love had germinated like a seed in the dark. As I held her
in my arms I stroked her hair and murmured things which seemed
to spring out of some ancestral memory. Certainly my tongue had
never used them before, nor my mind imagined them.... By and by
she slipped her arms round my neck and with a half sob strained
towards me. She was still trembling.</p>

<p>"Dick," she said, and to hear that name on her lips was the sweetest
thing I had ever known. "Dick, is it really you? Tell me I’m not
dreaming."</p>

<p>"It’s me, sure enough, Mary dear. And now I have found you I
will never let you go again. But, my precious child, how on earth
did you get here?"</p>

<p>She disengaged herself and let her little electric torch wander
over my rough habiliments.</p>

<p>"You look a tremendous warrior, Dick. I have never seen you like
this before. I was in Doubting Castle and very much afraid of
Giant Despair, till you came."</p>

<p>"I think I call it the Interpreter’s House," I said.</p>

<p>"It’s the house of somebody we both know," she went on. "He calls
himself Bommaerts here. That was one of the two names, you remember.
I have seen him since in Paris. Oh, it is a long story and you
shall hear it all soon. I knew he came here sometimes, so I came
here too. I have been nursing for the last fortnight at the Douvecourt
Hospital only four miles away."</p>

<p>"But what brought you alone at night?"</p>

<p>"Madness, I think. Vanity, too. You see I had found out a good
deal, and I wanted to find out the one vital thing which had puzzled
Mr Blenkiron. I told myself it was foolish, but I couldn’t keep
away. And then my courage broke down, and before you came I would
have screamed at the sound of a mouse. If I hadn’t whistled I
would have cried."</p>

<p>"But why alone and at this hour?"</p>

<p>"I couldn’t get off in the day. And it was safest to come alone.
You see he is in love with me, and when he heard I was coming
to Douvecourt forgot his caution and proposed to meet me here.
He said he was going on a long journey and wanted to say goodbye.
If he had found me alone—well, he would have said goodbye. If
there had been anyone with me, he would have suspected, and he
mustn’t suspect <em>me</em>. Mr Blenkiron says that would be fatal
to his great plan. He believes I am like my aunts, and that I
think him an apostle of peace working by his own methods against
the stupidity and wickedness of all the Governments. He talks
more bitterly about Germany than about England. He had told me
how he had to disguise himself and play many parts on his mission,
and of course I have applauded him. Oh, I have had a difficult
autumn."</p>

<p>"Mary," I cried, "tell me you hate him."</p>

<p>"No," she said quietly. "I do not hate him. I am keeping that
for later. I fear him desperately. Some day when we have broken
him utterly I will hate him, and drive all likeness of him out
of my memory like an unclean thing. But till then I won’t waste
energy on hate. We want to hoard every atom of our strength for
the work of beating him."</p>

<p>She had won back her composure, and I turned on my light to look
at her. She was in nurses’ outdoor uniform, and I thought her
eyes seemed tired. The priceless gift that had suddenly come to
me had driven out all recollection of my own errand. I thought
of Ivery only as a would-be lover of Mary, and forgot the manufacturer
from Lille who had rented his house for the partridge-shooting.
"And you, Dick," she asked; "is it part of a general’s duties
to pay visits at night to empty houses?"</p>

<p>"I came to look for traces of M. Bommaerts. I, too, got on his
track from another angle, but that story must wait."</p>

<p>"You observe that he has been here today?"</p>

<p>She pointed to some cigarette ash spilled on the table edge,
and a space on its surface cleared from dust. "In a place like
this the dust would settle again in a few hours, and that is quite
clean. I should say he has been here just after luncheon."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" I cried, "what a close shave! I’m in the mood
at this moment to shoot him at sight. You say you saw him in Paris
and knew his lair. Surely you had a good enough case to have him
collared."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Mr Blenkiron—he’s in Paris too—wouldn’t
hear of it. He hasn’t just figured the thing out yet, he says.
We’ve identified one of your names, but we’re still in doubt about
Chelius."</p>

<p>"Ah, Chelius! Yes, I see. We must get the whole business complete
before we strike. Has old Blenkiron had any luck?"</p>

<p>"Your guess about the ‘Deep-breathing’ advertisement was very
clever, Dick. It was true, and it may give us Chelius. I must
leave Mr Blenkiron to tell you how. But the trouble is this. We
know something of the doings of someone who may be Chelius, but
we can’t link them with Ivery. We know that Ivery is Bommaerts,
and our hope is to link Bommaerts with Chelius. That’s why I came
here. I was trying to burgle this escritoire in an amateur way.
It’s a bad piece of fake Empire and deserves smashing."</p>

<p>I could see that Mary was eager to get my mind back to business,
and with some difficulty I clambered down from the exultant heights.
The intoxication of the thing was on me—the winter night, the
circle of light in that dreary room, the sudden coming together
of two souls from the ends of the earth, the realisation of my
wildest hopes, the gilding and glorifying of all the future. But
she had always twice as much wisdom as me, and we were in the
midst of a campaign which had no use for day-dreaming. I turned
my attention to the desk.</p>

<p>It was a flat table with drawers, and at the back a half-circle
of more drawers with a central cupboard. I tilted it up and most
of the drawers slid out, empty of anything but dust. I forced
two open with my knife and they held empty cigar boxes. Only the
cupboard remained, and that appeared to be locked. I wedged a
key from my pocket into its keyhole, but the thing would not budge.</p>

<p>"It’s no good," I said. "He wouldn’t leave anything he valued
in a place like this. That sort of fellow doesn’t take risks.
If he wanted to hide something there are a hundred holes in this
Château which would puzzle the best detective."</p>

<p>"Can’t you open it?" she asked. "I’ve a fancy about that table.
He was sitting here this afternoon and he may be coming back."</p>

<p>I solved the problem by turning up the escritoire and putting
my knee through the cupboard door. Out of it tumbled a little
dark-green attache case.</p>

<p>"This is getting solemn," said Mary. "Is it locked?"</p>

<p>It was, but I took my knife and cut the lock out and spilled
the contents on the table. There were some papers, a newspaper
or two, and a small bag tied with black cord. The last I opened,
while Mary looked over my shoulder. It contained a fine yellowish
powder.</p>

<p>"Stand back," I said harshly. "For God’s sake, stand back and
don’t breathe."</p>

<p>With trembling hands I tied up the bag again, rolled it in a
newspaper, and stuffed it into my pocket. For I remembered a day
near Peronne when a Boche plane had come over in the night and
had dropped little bags like this. Happily they were all collected,
and the men who found them were wise and took them off to the
nearest laboratory. They proved to be full of anthrax germs....</p>

<p>I remembered how Eaucourt Sainte-Anne stood at the junction of
a dozen roads where all day long troops passed to and from the
lines. From such a vantage ground an enemy could wreck the health
of an army....</p>

<p>I remembered the woman I had seen in the courtyard of this house
in the foggy dusk, and I knew now why she had worn a gas-mask.</p>

<p>This discovery gave me a horrid shock. I was brought down with
a crash from my high sentiment to something earthly and devilish.
I was fairly well used to Boche filthiness, but this seemed too
grim a piece of the utterly damnable. I wanted to have Ivery by
the throat and force the stuff into his body, and watch him decay
slowly into the horror he had contrived for honest men.</p>

<p>"Let’s get out of this infernal place," I said.</p>

<p>But Mary was not listening. She had picked up one of the newspapers
and was gloating over it. I looked and saw that it was open at
an advertisement of Weissmann’s "Deep-breathing" system.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Dick," she cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>The column of type had little dots made by a red pencil below
certain words.</p>

<p>"It’s it," she whispered, "it’s the cipher—I’m almost sure it’s
the cipher!"</p>

<p>"Well, he’d be likely to know it if anyone did."</p>

<p>"But don’t you see it’s the cipher which Chelius uses—the man
in Switzerland? Oh, I can’t explain now, for it’s very long, but
I think—I think—I have found out what we have all been wanting.
Chelius...."</p>

<p>"Whisht!" I said. "What’s that?"</p>

<p>There was a queer sound from the out-of-doors as if a sudden
wind had risen in the still night.</p>

<p>"It’s only a car on the main road," said Mary.</p>

<p>"How did you get in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By the broken window in the next room. I cycled out here one
morning, and walked round the place and found the broken catch."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is left open on purpose. That may be the way M. Bommaerts
visits his country home.... Let’s get off, Mary, for this place
has a curse on it. It deserves fire from heaven."</p>

<p>I slipped the contents of the attache case into my pockets. "I’m
going to drive you back," I said. "I’ve got a car out there."</p>

<p>"Then you must take my bicycle and my servant too. He’s an old
friend of yours—one Andrew Amos."</p>

<p>"Now how on earth did Andrew get over here?"</p>

<p>"He’s one of us," said Mary, laughing at my surprise. "A most
useful member of our party, at present disguised as an <em>infirmier</em>
in Lady Manorwater’s Hospital at Douvecourt. He is learning French,
and...."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I whispered. "There’s someone in the next room."</p>

<p>I swept her behind a stack of furniture, with my eyes glued on
a crack of light below the door. The handle turned and the shadows
raced before a big electric lamp of the kind they have in stables.
I could not see the bearer, but I guessed it was the old woman.</p>

<p>There was a man behind her. A brisk step sounded on the parquet,
and a figure brushed past her. It wore the horizon-blue of a French
officer, very smart, with those French riding-boots that show
the shape of the leg, and a handsome fur-lined pelisse. I would
have called him a young man, not more than thirty-five. The face
was brown and clean-shaven, the eyes bright and masterful....
Yet he did not deceive me. I had not boasted idly to Sir Walter
when I said that there was one man alive who could never again
be mistaken by me.</p>

<p>I had my hand on my pistol, as I motioned Mary farther back into
the shadows. For a second I was about to shoot. I had a perfect
mark and could have put a bullet through his brain with utter
certitude. I think if I had been alone I might have fired. Perhaps
not. Anyhow now I could not do it. It seemed like potting at a
sitting rabbit. I was obliged, though he was my worst enemy, to
give him a chance, while all the while my sober senses kept calling
me a fool.</p>

<p>I stepped into the light.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Mr Ivery," I said. "This is an odd place to meet again!"</p>

<p>In his amazement he fell back a step, while his hungry eyes took
in my face. There was no mistake about the recognition. I saw
something I had seen once before in him, and that was fear. Out
went the light and he sprang for the door.</p>

<p>I fired in the dark, but the shot must have been too high. In
the same instant I heard him slip on the smooth parquet and the
tinkle of glass as the broken window swung open. Hastily I reflected
that his car must be at the moat end of the terrace, and that
therefore to reach it he must pass outside this very room. Seizing
the damaged escritoire, I used it as a ram, and charged the window
nearest me. The panes and shutters went with a crash, for I had
driven the thing out of its rotten frame. The next second I was
on the moonlit snow.</p>

<p>I got a shot at him as he went over the terrace, and again I
went wide. I never was at my best with a pistol. Still I reckoned
I had got him, for the car which was waiting below must come back
by the moat to reach the highroad. But I had forgotten the great
closed park gates. Somehow or other they must have been opened,
for as soon as the car started it headed straight for the grand
avenue. I tried a couple of long-range shots after it, and one
must have damaged either Ivery or his chauffeur, for there came
back a cry of pain.</p>

<p>I turned in deep chagrin to find Mary beside me. She was bubbling
with laughter.</p>

<p>"Were you ever a cinema actor, Dick? The last two minutes have
been a really high-class performance. ‘Featuring Mary Lamington.’
How does the jargon go?"</p>

<p>"I could have got him when he first entered," I said ruefully.</p>

<p>"I know," she said in a graver tone. "Only of course you couldn’t....
Besides, Mr Blenkiron doesn’t want it—yet."</p>

<p>She put her hand on my arm. "Don’t worry about it. It wasn’t
written it should happen that way. It would have been too easy.
We have a long road to travel yet before we clip the wings of
the Wild Birds."</p>

<p>"Look," I cried. "The fire from heaven!"</p>

<p>Red tongues of flame were shooting up from the out-buildings
at the farther end, the place where I had first seen the woman.
Some agreed plan must have been acted on, and Ivery was destroying
all traces of his infamous yellow powder. Even now the <em>concierge</em>
with her odds and ends of belongings would be slipping out to
some refuge in the village.</p>

<p>In the still dry night the flames rose, for the place must have
been made ready for a rapid burning. As I hurried Mary round the
moat I could see that part of the main building had caught fire.
The hamlet was awakened, and before we reached the corner of the
highroad sleepy British soldiers were hurrying towards the scene,
and the Town Major was mustering the fire brigade. I knew that
Ivery had laid his plans well, and that they hadn’t a chance—that
long before dawn the Château of Eaucourt Sainte-Anne would be
a heap of ashes and that in a day or two the lawyers of the aged
Marquise at Biarritz would be wrangling with the insurance company.</p>

<p>At the corner stood Amos beside two bicycles, solid as a graven
image. He recognised me with a gap-toothed grin.</p>

<p>"It’s a cauld night, General, but the home fires keep burnin’.
I havena seen such a cheery lowe since Dickson’s mill at Gawly."</p>

<p>We packed, bicycles and all, into my car with Amos wedged in
the narrow seat beside Hamilton. Recognizing a fellow countryman,
he gave thanks for the lift in the broadest Doric. "For," said
he, "I’m not what you would call a practised hand wi’ a velocipede,
and my feet are dinnled wi’ standin’ in the snaw."</p>

<p>As for me, the miles to Douvecourt passed as in a blissful moment
of time. I wrapped Mary in a fur rug, and after that we did not
speak a word. I had come suddenly into a great possession and
was dazed with the joy of it.</p>
