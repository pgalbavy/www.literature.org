<p>Although Nellie Ribsam was only eight years old at the time she
was lost in the big woods, yet the results of the training received
from her sensible father and mother showed themselves in a marked
degree on that memorable occasion.</p>

<p>She had been taught, as was her brother, that under heaven she
must rely upon herself to get forward in the world. Nick was rarely
if ever allowed to extend her a helping hand in her lessons, and
she was given to understand that whatever was possible for her
to do must be done without the aid of any one.</p>

<p>As for sitting down and crying when in trouble, without making
any effort to help herself, she knew better than to try that when
either her father or mother were likely to find it out.</p>

<p>Her intention, when she left school that afternoon before the
session closed, was to keep on in the direction of Dunbarton until
she met Nick returning.</p>

<p>She turned off at the forks, and did not lessen her gait until
she reached the woods. Her rapid walking caused her to feel quite
warm, and the cool shade of the woods was refreshing.</p>

<p>She began wandering aimlessly forward, swinging her hat in her
hand, singing snatches of school songs, and feeling just as happy
as a little girl can feel who is in bounding health, high spirits,
and without an accusing conscience.</p>

<p>It was not the time of year for flowers, and Nellie knew better
than to look for any. They had drooped and died long ago; but
some of the leaves were turning on the trees, and they gave a
peculiar beauty to the autumnal forest.</p>

<p>At intervals she caught sight of the cleanly, symmetrical maple,
with some of its leaves turning a fiery red and looking like flecks
of flame through the intervening vegetation. At the least rustling
of the wind some of the leaves came fluttering downward as lightly
as flakes of snow; the little brown squirrel scampered up the
shaggy trunks and out upon the limbs, where, perching on his hind
legs, he peeped mischievously down at the girl, as if inviting
her to play hide-and-seek with him; now and then a rabbit, fat
and awkward from his gluttony on the richness around him, jumped
softly a few steps, then munched rapidly with his jaws, flapped
his long silken ears, looked slyly around with his big, pretty
eyes, and, as the girl made a rush toward him, he was off like
a shot.</p>

<p>The woods were fragrant with ripening grapes and decaying vegetation,
and were putting on a garb whose flaming splendor surpassed the
hues of spring.</p>

<p>Indeed, everything conspired to win a boy or girl away from study
or work, and to cause the wish on the part of both that they might
be a bird or squirrel, with no thought of the responsibilities
of life.</p>

<p>Nellie Ribsam forgot for the time everything else except her
own enjoyment; but by-and-by the woods took on such tempting looks
that she turned off from the highway she had been following, with
the intention of taking a stroll, which she meant should not lead
her out of sight of the road.</p>

<p>The first view which stopped her was that of a large vine of
wild grapes.</p>

<p>Some of them were green, some turning, while others were a dark
purple, showing they were fully ripe: the last, as a matter of
course, were at the top.</p>

<p>These wild grapes were small and tart, inferior to those which
grew in the yard of Nellie at home; but they seemed to be trying
to hide in the woods, and they were hard to get, therefore they
were more to be desired than the choicest Catawba, Isabella, or
Concord.</p>

<p>The main vine, where it started from the ground, was as thick
as a man's wrist, and it twisted and wound about an oak sapling
as if it were a great African constrictor seeking to strangle
the young tree. Other vines branched out from the sides until
not only was the particular sapling enfolded and smothered, but
the greedy vine reached out and grasped others growing near it.</p>

<p>Nellie felt like the fox who found the grapes more tempting the
longer he looked at them.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have some of them," she said, and straightway proceeded
to help herself.</p>

<p>She climbed as readily as Nick himself could have done, and never
stopped until she was so high that the sapling bent far over with
her weight. Then she reached out her chubby hand and plucked a
cluster of the wild fruit. They were about the size of buckshot,
and when her sound teeth shut down on them, the juice was so sour
that she shut both eyes and felt a twinge at the crown of her
head as though she had taken a sniff of the spirits of ammonia.</p>

<p>But the grapes were none the less delicious for all that; the
fact that there seemed to be something forbidden about them added
a flavor that nothing else could give.</p>

<p>Nellie had managed to crush a handful of the vinegar-like globules,
when she caught sight of another vine deeper in the woods. It
was much larger and climbed fully a dozen yards from the ground,
winding in and out among the limbs of a ridgy beech, which seemed
to be forever struggling upward to get away from the smothering
embrace of the vegetable python.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Nellie was clambering upward like a monkey,
never pausing until the bending tree-top warned her that if she
went any higher it would yield to her weight.</p>

<p>Nellie disposed of one bunch and that was enough: she concluded
that she was not very hungry for grapes and, without eating or
even gathering more, she devoted herself to another kind of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Standing with one foot on a limb and the other on one near it,
she grasped a branch above her and began swaying back and forth,
with the vim and abandon of a child in a patent swing.</p>

<p>The tree bent far over as she swung outward, then straightened
up and inclined the other way as her weight passed over to that
side. Any one looking at the picture would have said that a general
smash and giving away were certain, in which case the girl was
sure to go spinning through the limbs and branches, as though
driven forth by the springs within the big gun which fling the
young lady outward just as the showman touches off some powder.</p>

<p>But a green sapling is very elastic, and, although the one climbed
by Nellie bent back and forth like a bow, it did not give way.
Her hair streamed from her head, and there was a thrilling feeling
as the wind whistled by her ears, and she seemed to be shooting
like a bird through space.</p>

<p>All this was well enough, and it was no more than natural that
Nellie should have forgotten several important facts: she was
so far from the highway that she could not see any one passing
over it; the rush of the wind in her ears shut out sounds that
otherwise would have been noticed, and she had gone so far and
had lingered so long by the way that it was time to look for Nick
on his return from Dunbarton, even though he was later than he
expected to be.</p>

<p>It was while she was swinging in this wild fashion that her brother
drove by on his way home, without either suspecting how close
they were to each other.</p>

<p>Nellie displayed a natural, childish thoughtlessness by keeping
up this sport for a half hour longer, when she came down to the
ground, simply because she was tired of the amusement.</p>

<p>Although out of sight of the road she managed to find her way
back to it without trouble. With her lunch basket in hand, she
continued in the direction of Dunbarton, taking several mouthfuls
of the bread which had been left over at noon.</p>

<p>In this aimless manner she strolled forward, stopping now and
then to look at the squirrel or rabbit or the yellow-hued warbler,
the noisy and swift-flying finch, the russet-coated thrush, or
dark brown and mottled woodpecker, as his head rattled against
the bark of the tree trunks, into which he bored in quest of worms.</p>

<p>The first real surprise of the girl came when she reached the
bridge. This proved that she was more than four miles from home,
a distance much greater than she had suspected.</p>

<p>"Where can Nick be?" she asked herself, never once thinking that
they might have missed each other when she was swinging in the
tree-top. It struck her that the day was nearly gone, for she
noticed the gathering twilight diffusing itself through the forest.</p>

<p>"I don't think I will go any farther," she said; "Nick will be
along pretty soon, and I'll wait here for him."</p>

<p>Standing on the bridge and looking down the road and listening
for the sound of the carriage wheels were tiresome to one of Nellie's
active habits, and it was not long before she broke off some of
the bread, set down her lunch basket, and then dropped some crumbs
into the water.</p>

<p>As they struck the surface, sending out little rings toward the
shore, several tiny fish came up after the food. Nellie laughed
outright, and, in her eagerness, was careless of how she threw
the crumbs, most of which fell upon the bank.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that she could do better by going down to
the edge of the stream, where she would not mistake her aim.</p>

<p>Childlike, she did not pause to think of the wrong of so doing,
for she ought to have known that her parents never would have
consented to such an act.</p>

<p>Just there, Nellie, like many another little girl, made a great
mistake.</p>
