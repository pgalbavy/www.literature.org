<p><em>TOM WAITED </em>patiently while the captain gave some directions
to his subordinates. At length the robber made him a sign to draw
near.</p>

<p>"Now, youngster," he said, "you may say what you wish."</p>

<p>Tom looked significantly at two of the band who were within hearing.</p>

<p>"I should like to speak to you in private," he said.</p>

<p>The captain frowned slightly, and was on the point of refusing,
but curiosity overcame him.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Follow me."</p>

<p>They went a few rods away.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "speak."</p>

<p>"What I have to say," Tom begun, "is about those bonds."</p>

<p>"You wish to plead for your friend?" interrupted the captain.
"If that is all, I will tell you to begin with, that it is of
no use. I shall not give them up."</p>

<p>"You have made a mistake," said Tom quietly. "In the first place,
that man is not my friend."</p>

<p>"You were traveling together."</p>

<p>"That is true, but I only met him in San Francisco. I was following
him to find out the very thing you helped me to discover to-day."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Whether he had those papers."</p>

<p>"What have you to do with the papers?" demanded the captain,
in surprise.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, sir. For the want of these papers a New York
merchant failed who owed me ten thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Whew! I begin to see."</p>

<p>"This man—he calls himself Morton, but his real name is Lincoln—was
Mr. Armstrong’s clerk. He appropriated these securities, worth
about eighty thousand dollars, and fled. It was supposed, but
not known, that he had come to California. I agreed to follow
him and ascertain."</p>

<p>"It is rather strange that you, a boy, should have undertaken
such a task. It is a man’s work."</p>

<p>"There was no one else to do it. I offered my services, and was
accepted. I arrived in San Francisco three months since. I only
met this man a few days ago."</p>

<p>"How did you know him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Armstrong gave me his description."</p>

<p>"Very good. Having found him, you followed him. What good did
you think it would do? Supposing he had the papers, how did you
expect to get hold of them?"</p>

<p>"That I didn’t know. I had no plan," Tom confessed frankly. "But
if I were with him, some opportunity might offer. I set out in
the hope of that."</p>

<p>"Does he have any suspicion of your motives in accompanying him?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure he does not. Perhaps if he knew my real name he
would. But he thinks I am merely going to the mines in search
of fortune."</p>

<p>"You did not know positively that he had these bonds?"</p>

<p>"Not till you took them from him."</p>

<p>The robber paused for a moment’s reflection, then he fixed his
eyes upon Tom.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me," he said abruptly, "what object you have in telling
me all this?"</p>

<p>"I want you to help me," answered our hero boldly.</p>

<p>The captain laughed.</p>

<p>"Oho! you want me to give you these papers. My young friend,
I gave you credit for more sense. Do you take me for a philanthropist?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, smiling. "I never should make such a mistake."</p>

<p>"Go on, then."</p>

<p>"I will make it worth your while to give me these bonds," said
Tom, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"You! How can that be? I have taken all your money, except the
few dollars I had the consideration to leave you. Of what other
funds have you command?"</p>

<p>"I represent Mr. Armstrong," said Tom. "It is important that
he should recover these securities. I am authorized to offer a
large sum for them."</p>

<p>"But why should I let them go, when I can obtain their whole
value."</p>

<p>"You can’t," said Tom boldly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"For the same reason that they have been useless to the clerk
who took them. They cannot be negotiated."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I am. The authorities have an accurate list of them all. Information
has also been sent to the different institutions and corporations
represented. Whoever undertakes to raise money on them is liable
to arrest."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of all this?" demanded the robber thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"You may be right. In fact, I have sufficient knowledge of business
to believe that you are. I was not always what I am now. Years
since I was engaged in business in St. Louis. I was unfortunate
as so many are. I got into difficulties and made my way out here.
Finally, getting desperate, I organized this band, and begun to
prey upon the community."</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, and as if talking to himself. Tom listened with
surprise and interest. He saw that even robber-captains have a
human side, and are not altogether bad.</p>

<p>"Do you like this kind of life?" asked our hero.</p>

<p>The robber shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"A man must live," he said. "I would rather be a prosperous merchant,
but I must be satisfied with the mode of life that fortune has
opened to me. But that is not to the point," he said, changing
his tone. "You said you had something for my advantage to propose.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Give me up those bonds, give me the means of
returning with them to New York, and you shall have ten thousand
dollars as a reward."</p>

<p>"You speak confidently, but there are difficulties. How do I
know that you will keep faith with me—a social outlaw? Once out
of my clutches you will play me false."</p>

<p>"I shall keep my promise," said Tom proudly. "I pledge you my
word."</p>

<p>"But you may not be able to keep it. Show me your authority to
make this bargain."</p>

<p>Tom drew a paper from his pocket-book—a paper of which we have
not hitherto spoken—signed by Mr. Armstrong, empowering him to
make such terms as he found necessary to secure the papers.</p>

<p>"I should have made this offer to Morton," he said in conclusion,
"but the papers are no longer in his possession. I make them to
you."</p>

<p>"I don’t see how I’m to receive the money, even if I consent.
There is a reward offered for my arrest."</p>

<p>"I wish you could have gone to New York with me," said Tom. "You
could retain the papers until you were sure of the reward. I suppose
that would be impossible."</p>

<p>The captain looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"This a matter of importance," he said. "I will take a night
to think it over. We will speak again on the subject to-morrow.
Meanwhile keep your mouth shut."</p>

<p>"I will," said Tom.</p>

<p>He walked back to the house with his companion But he did not
share the captivity of his fellow travelers. He was allowed to
sleep and eat with the robbers, and to have his freedom.</p>

<p>"He’s only a boy," said the captain by way of explanation. "No
need to shut him up."</p>
