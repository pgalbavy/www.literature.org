<p>David Glasgow Farragut was the greatest naval hero of modern
times. There are many honored names connected with the American
navy, but his towers above them all. The highest honors that his
country could give were freely bestowed upon him and no one will
deny that he earned them all.</p>

<p>His father, although a native of Minorca, came to this country
in 1776 and lost no time in joining the ragged, starving patriots
in their struggle for independence. His skill and gallantry won
him the rank of major. When the war ended he settled on the western
frontier, near Knoxville, Tenn., where at a place called Campbell's
Station his son David was born in 1801. When only nine years old
he was appointed midshipman under Captain David Porter, the heroic
commander of the <em>Essex</em>. Captain Porter and Major Farragut
were old friends, to which fact was due the privilege extended
to a lad of such tender years.</p>

<p>In the sketch of Captain Porter the reader will recall the incident
in which young Farragut learned of the conspiracy among the 500
prisoners on board the <em>Essex</em>, and, by giving his commander
warning, prevented the capture of the ship by the savage plotters.</p>

<p>The boy was on the <em>Essex</em> when, disabled and helpless,
she was pounded into a surrender by two British ships while in
the harbor of Valparaiso, in January, 1814. It was one of the
most sanguinary battles of the war, when the decks ran with blood
and the dead and dying were stretched on every hand. Amid the
terrible carnage the boy Farragut conducted himself with such
coolness and bravery that he was specially complimented by Captain
Porter in his report. Although wounded, he stood unflinchingly
to his guns, winning the admiration of the grim heroes around
him and demonstrating the wonderful qualities which later were
to raise him to the position of the foremost naval hero of the
age.</p>

<p>Peace came, and, although Farragut was in continual service,
promotion was slow. He became lieutenant in 1825, commander in
1841 and captain in 1851. His first wife, whom he married in Norfolk,
became an invalid and did not live long. His second wife was also
a native of Norfolk. Thus he was not only a Southerner himself,
but his wife was a native of that section. When, therefore, civil
war came and it became fashionable for people to express secession
sentiments, it was taken for granted that Farragut would cast
his fortunes with the South; but upon being approached he indignantly
replied: "I would see every man of you damned before I would raise
my hand against that flag!" Being told that it would be unsafe
for him to remain in the South, he added that he wanted only two
hours to find another place of residence. He moved away at once
and with his wife and only son took up his home on the Hudson
near Tarrytown.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>COMMODORE DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT</em>.]</p>

<p>Being a stranger in that neighborhood, he was regarded with suspicion.
He was fond of taking long walks, and it is said that some of
the people suspected that he belonged to a gang of plotters who
intended to cut the Croton Aqueduct, but the quiet man was simply
awaiting the summons of his country to serve her in any capacity
possible.</p>

<p>The call came in the spring of 1861, when he was about threescore
years old. His duty was that of serving on the board appointed
by Congress to retire superannuated officers from the active service.
This duty completed, he was appointed to the command of the expedition
organized for the capture of New Orleans. He sailed from Hampton
Roads on the 3d of February, 1862, in the flagship <em>Hartford</em>
and arrived seventeen days later at Ship Island, the place of
rendezvous. There he set to work to make his arrangements for
the great task which was wholly different from any that had ever
engaged his attention. But how well he completed this grand work,
he being the real supervisor and superintendent, has been referred
to in a previous chapter and is told in every history of our country.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS &</em>mdash;<em>ATTACK
ON FORT PHILIP</em>.]</p>

<p>The skill and courage displayed by Farragut in the capture of
New Orleans attracted national attention and added greatly to
his reputation. In the latter part of June he ran the batteries
of Vicksburg, but notified the Government that though he could
go up and down the river as he chose and silence the batteries
when he pleased, no substantial good would result unless a land
force of ten or twelve thousand men attacked the town from the
rear. It was this plan which brought about the capture of Vicksburg
by General Grant and the opening of the Mississippi River. Farragut,
who had been made rear admiral, afforded great aid in taking Port
Hudson and cleaning out all rebel fortifications along the Father
of Waters.</p>

<p>This immense work having been accomplished, the Government now
gave its attention to Mobile, another of the Confederate strongholds
in the South. The campaign arranged was to attack it with a land
force under the command of Generals Canby and Granger and a naval
force under Farragut. In January, 1864, he made a reconnaissance
of Mobile Bay and informed the Government that if it would supply
him with a slight additional force he would attack and capture
it at once. He knew that the defences were being strengthened
every day and repeatedly urged that he be furnished with the means
of making an immediate assault. But the ill-advised and disastrous
expedition of Banks up the Red River took away the available troops
and the appeal of Farragut remained unheeded until the summer
was well advanced.</p>

<p>By that time the defences of Mobile were well nigh impregnable.
Fort Gaines, on Dauphin Island, had a garrison of 864 men and
mounted three 10-inch columbiads, four 32-pounder rifled guns
and twenty smoothbore guns of 32, 24 and 18-pound calibres. The
principal pass to Mississippi Sound was commanded by Fort Powell,
with one mounted 10-inch gun, one 8-inch columbiad and four rifled
guns. The main fortification was Fort Morgan, whose heavy guns
were placed in three tiers. It mounted seven 10-inch, three 8-inch
and twenty-two 32-pounder smoothbore guns and two 8-inch, two
6.5-inch and four 5.82-inch rifled guns. The exterior batteries
were also heavily armed and the garrison numbered 640 men. The
bay was filled with skilfully placed torpedoes, some of them of
stupendous size and power and sufficient, it would seem, if properly
handled, to destroy all the navies of the world.</p>

<p>All arrangements being completed, the signal for the advance
was hoisted at daylight, August 5, 1864. The Union fleet consisted
of 21 wooden vessels and 6 ironclads. The wooden vessels sailed
in pairs, the larger on the starboard, so that if either was disabled
the other could carry it along. Farragut's intention was to lead
with the flagship <em>Hartford</em>, but he reluctantly allowed
the <em>Brooklyn</em> to take that post, since she carried four
chase guns to the <em>Hartford's</em> one and was provided with
an ingenious apparatus for picking up torpedoes. It was contended
further that the flagship would be the special target of the enemy,
a fact that was likely to cripple her and prevent the employment
of the all-important signals. The last argument bore no weight
with Farragut, who replied that she would be the chief target
anyway, no matter what the position, and exposure to fire was
one of the penalties of rank in the navy. The monitors were to
advance in single file, slightly in advance of the wooden ships,
the <em>Tecumseh</em>, Commander Tunis <em>A.M. </em>Craven, in
the lead.</p>

<p>[Illustration: IN <em>MOBILE BAY</em>.]</p>

<p>In this order the slow advance was begun and at a few minutes
past seven the <em>Tecumseh</em> fired the first gun. The forts
waited twenty minutes when they replied, and the <em>Brooklyn</em>
responded with two 100-pounder Parrot rifles. Under the protection
of Fort Morgan nestled the Confederate rams and ironclads, which
directed their fire principally at the wooden vessels. The great
battle was opened.</p>

<p>The enemy's gunboats and the ram <em>Tennessee</em> moved out
from behind the fort and continued firing at the wooden boats,
giving principal attention, as was expected, to the flagship,
which was struck several times. She soon began returning the fire,
still advancing, and repeatedly drove the gunners from the water
batteries, but they immediately returned and kept bravely at work.</p>

<p>Smokeless powder was unknown in those days, and, as the vapor
enfolded the ships, Farragut kept stepping up the rigging almost
unconsciously until he was so high that he was clinging to the
futtock shrouds. He had his spyglass in one hand and kept raising
it to his eyes. Captain Percival Drayton had been closely watching
the Admiral and now became alarmed, lest some damage to the ropes
should cause him to fall overboard. He told Signal Quartermaster
Knowles to climb the rigging and secure Farragut to the shrouds.
He obeyed and passed a lead line to one of the forward shrouds
and then drew it around the Admiral to the after shroud and made
it fast. Feeling the faithful officer at work, the Admiral looked
down kindly at him and said: "Never mind me, I am all right."
But Knowles persisted and did not descend until he had completed
his work.</p>

<p>By and by the increasing smoke made it necessary for the commander
to ascend still higher, in order to maintain a clear view of the
battle. He untied the fastenings, and, climbing to the futtock
shrouds, passed the rope once more around his body several times
and tied the end to the rigging. The picture of Admiral Farragut
thus lashed to the rigging has been seen thousands of times in
the histories of the Civil War.</p>

<p>While in this perilous position he signalled for closer order.
The bombardment of the fort was terrific and produced great effect.
Commander Craven, with the <em>Tecumseh</em>, singled out the
ram <em>Tennessee</em>, under the command of Admiral Franklin
Buchanan, who had charge of the <em>Merrimac</em> on the first
day of her fight with the <em>Monitor</em>. Both were ironclads
and Buchanan was as anxious to fight Craven as the latter was
to fight him. Craven, fearing his adversary would retreat, pressed
forward so eagerly that he paid no attention to the torpedoes
over which his hull was continually scraping. One or more of these
suddenly exploded, the front dipped and the <em>Tecumseh</em>
plunged bow foremost to the bottom of the bay, carrying with her
93 men out of a crew of 114.</p>

<p>This appalling disaster was accompanied by a touching incident.
When the <em>Tecumseh</em> was diving downward Commander Craven
and the pilot instinctively started for the opening through which
only one man could pass at a time. They reached the foot of the
ladder at the same moment. "You first," said Craven, halting.
The pilot just succeeded in scrambling out, when the <em>Tecumseh</em>
went down, taking her heroic captain with her.</p>

<p>The terrible occurrence was witnessed by friends and foes. A
boat was quickly lowered from the <em>Metacomet</em> and sent
to the relief of the survivors. It passed within a hundred yards
of Fort Morgan, which could have easily blown it out of the water.
But General Page, the Confederate commandant, knowing her errand,
gave the order not to harm the boat, which was on its way to save
drowning men. His soldiers broke into cheers, but he sternly stopped
them, with the advice to wait till the <em>Hartford</em> was sunk.
The boat picked up ten men and officers, while four swam to the
beach and were made prisoners.</p>

<p>When the lull was over Farragut headed his ship for the fort,
signalling to the remainder of the fleet, which followed close
after him. When warned of the torpedoes the wrathful Admiral came
near adding a little profanity to his contemptuous opinion of
them as he passed on. Wheeling, he launched his whole broadside
at the fort, then delivered a second at the <em>Tennessee</em>
and headed for the gunboats <em>Selma</em>, <em>Gaines</em> and
<em>Morgan</em>, all of which were raking him. Casting off his
consort, the <em>Metacomet</em>, he sent her after the <em>Selma</em>,
and, after a hot chase, she captured her. The other two took to
shallow water under the guns of the fort.</p>

<p>The ships, having passed the latter, were about to anchor when
the <em>Tennessee</em> was perceived coming straight for the fleet,
with the intention of attacking it. Farragut signalled to the
vessels to run her down and ordered the pilot of the <em>Hartford</em>
to drive her with full speed at the ironclad. The <em>Monongahela</em>
was the first to reach the monster, struck her fairly, and, swinging
around, let fly with a broadside of 11-inch shot, which dropped
harmlessly from her mailed side. Undaunted, the <em>Monongahela</em>
rammed her again, though she received ten times as much damage
as she inflicted. The <em>Lackawanna</em> passed through a somewhat
similar experience but a gunner drove a 9-inch shell into one
of the shutters, which was shattered and forced within the casemate.
The crews were so close that they taunted each other through the
portholes and even hurled missiles across the brief intervening
space.</p>

<p>At this juncture the <em>Hartford</em> arrived, charging full
speed upon the ram, which so shifted its position that the blow
was a glancing one. Recoiling, the flagship delivered its most
tremendous broadside, doing no harm, while the <em>Hartford</em>
itself was pierced again and again by the exploding shells which
strewed her deck with dead and dying. Nothing daunted, Farragut
prepared to ram once more, when his ship was badly injured by
an accidental blow from the <em>Lackawanna</em>. But Farragut,
seeing that she still floated, called for a full head of steam
that he might deliver a blow that was likely to send his own ship
to the bottom.</p>

<p>By this time the slower going monitors had arrived and were getting
in their fine work. The <em>Tennessee's</em> smokestack was shot
away, her stern port shutter was disabled, making the gun useless,
while her steering chains were smashed. Like a stag beset by a
pack of hounds, she was brought to her knees. The white flag was
raised, and the sorely battered <em>Tennessee</em> became the
captive of the Union fleet. The forts were passed and the victory
of Mobile Bay was secure.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BURNSIDE'S EXPEDITION CROSSING HATTERAS BAR
(1862</em>).]</p>

<p>But it had cost dearly. In addition to the men lost on the <em>Tecumseh</em>,
there had been 25 killed and 28 wounded on the <em>Hartford</em>,
11 killed and 43 wounded on the <em>Brooklyn</em>, the total of
all, including those lost on the <em>Tecumseh</em>, being 145
killed and 170 wounded. The Confederate loss was 12 killed, 20
wounded and 280 prisoners.</p>

<p>Fort Powell was subjected to a severe bombardment that afternoon
and on the following night was abandoned and blown up. Fire being
opened on Fort Gaines, it also surrendered. Fort Morgan, the only
fort in the possession of the enemy, surrendered August 23, before
an attack of the navy and the land forces under General Granger
from New Orleans.</p>

<p>Soon after this splendid victory Admiral Farragut went North,
where he was received with all possible honors. The war ending
soon after, his inestimable services came to a close. That no
reward might be lacking, the office of vice-admiral was specially
created for him in December, 1864, and that of admiral in 1866.
He died in 1870.</p>
