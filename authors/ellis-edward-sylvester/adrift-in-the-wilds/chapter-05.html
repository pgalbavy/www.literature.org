<p>Under the united propulsion of three men and a large Newfoundland
dog, the small raft moved shoreward with no insignificant speed.
It was found amply sufficient to preserve them all from drowning
had none known how to swim, provided they managed the matter prudently.
There is so little difference in the quantity of water and the
human body, that a slight effort, if properly made, will keep
it afloat. The trouble with new beginners is that when they first
go beyond their depth their blind struggles tend to carry them
downward more than upward.</p>

<p>"This is rather pleasant," remarked Mr. Yard. "There is little
doubt, I think, of reaching land. There is only one thing that
makes the shivers run over me."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The thought of <em>sharks</em>!"</p>

<p>"Ugh! Why did you spake of them?" asked Tim, with a strong expression
of disgust. "I've been thinking of 'em ever since I've been in
the water, but I didn't want to skeer the boys."</p>

<p>"They never once entered my head," said Howard.</p>

<p>"Nor mine either," added Elwood. "Are they in this part of the
ocean?"</p>

<p>"You will find them in almost every part of the sea, I was going
to say. They abound off the coast of California."</p>

<p>"But it is night, and they will not be apt to see!"</p>

<p>"This fire and the numbers of drowning people will draw hundreds
of the finny inhabitants toward us. You know a fire at night is
sure to attract fish."</p>

<p>"You seem determined to frighten us," said Howard, "but I shall
continue to think that God who has so mercifully saved us intends
to save us to the end."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, too, but it does no harm to understand all the dangers
to which we are subject."</p>

<p>"I believe with Howard," said Elwood. "I ain't afraid of sharks,
but for all that, they are ugly creatures. They swim under you
and the first thing you know clip goes one of your legs off, just
the same as a pair of snuffers would clip off a piece of wick."</p>

<p>"They are the hyenas of the sea," said Howard, "although I believe
some kinds are stupid and harmless. I think I have heard them
called that by somebody, I don't remember who. They will snap
up anything that is thrown to them."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it make their eyes water to come this way then? Jis'
to think of their saaing four pair of legs dancing over their
hids, not to spake of the dog that could come in by way of dessart."</p>

<p>"O Tim! keep still, it is too dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Worrah! it wasn't meself that introduced the subject, but as
yez have got started, I've no objection to continue the same."</p>

<p>"Let us try and talk about something more pleasant&#11834;"</p>

<p>"A shark! a shark!" suddenly screamed Elwood, springing half
his length out of the water in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Mr. Yard, while the others were speechless
with terror.</p>

<p>"He has hold of my leg! O, save me, for he is pulling me under!"</p>

<p>There was danger for a moment that all would go to the bottom,
but Mr. Yard displayed a remarkable coolness that saved them all.</p>

<p>"It is not a shark," said he, "or he would have had your leg
off before this."</p>

<p>"What is it then? What can it be?"</p>

<p>"It is a drowning man that has caught your foot as he was going
down. You must kick him off or he will drown you. Has he one foot
or both?"</p>

<p>"My left ankle is grasped by something."</p>

<p>"That is good; if he had hold of both feet it would be bad for
you. Use your free foot and force his grasp loose."</p>

<p>Elwood did so with such vigor that he soon had the inexpressible
relief of announcing that the drag weight was loosed and his limbs
were free again.</p>

<p>"That is terrible," said he, as they resumed their progress.
"Just to think of being seized in that way by some poor fellow
who, I don't suppose, really knew what he was doing."</p>

<p>"How came he there?" asked Howard.</p>

<p>"You see, we ain't far from where the steamer sunk, and there
may be more near us. This man has gone down just as we were passing
by him, and in his blind struggles has caught your ankle."</p>

<p>"If a drowning man will catch at a straw, wouldn't he be after
catching at a leg?" inquired Tim.</p>

<p>"It seems natural that he should do so; but we are in the most
dangerous place we could be. Let's keep a sharp lookout."</p>

<p>Our friends peered in every direction, as they rose and sunk
on the long, heaving swell of the sea. They saw pieces of charred
wood and fragments of the wreck, but caught sight of no human
being until Mr. Yard pointed, to a dark mass some distance away.</p>

<p>"That is a raft covered with people," said he.</p>

<p>"They seem to be standing still."</p>

<p>"Yes, they merely want to keep afloat until morning, when no
doubt they will be picked up and cared for. Keep quiet, for if
we talk too loud some one may start for us."</p>

<p>"And work hard," whispered Tim, struggling harder than ever.
"Aich of yees shove like a locomotive."</p>

<p>"Good advice," added Mr. Yard, in the same cautions undertone.
"Let's get away as fast as possible."</p>

<p>Hour after hour the men toiled, following the moon, that appeared
to recede from them as they advanced. They had passed safely the
debris of the wrecked steamer, and were again talking loudly and
rather cheerfully, when Tim O'Rooney interrupted them:</p>

<p>"Yonder is something flowting in the darkness."</p>

<p>"It is a boat full of people," said Mr. Yard. "I have noticed
it for the last few minutes."</p>

<p>All turned their eyes toward the spot indicated, and agreed that
Mr. Yard was correct in his supposition.</p>

<p>"I will hail it," he quietly added, and then called out: "Boat
ahoy!"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" came back in a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"Can you take four drowning passengers on board?"</p>

<p>"Not much," was the unfeeling answer, "Paddle away and you'll
reach California one of these days."</p>

<p>"How far are we from it?"</p>

<p>"Double the distance, divide by two, and you'll have it."</p>

<p>Nothing further was extracted from the men, but they could be
heard laughing and talking boisterously with each other, and the
odor of their pipes was plainly detected, so close were the parties.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven, we are not dependent upon them!" said Mr. Yard.
"If we were, we should fare cruelly indeed."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"A part of the crew of the steamer, who seized the boat at the
first appearance of danger, and left the helpless to perish."</p>

<p>An hour later, long after the boat had disappeared, and when
our friends were toiling bravely forward, a low, dark object directly
in front attracted their notice.</p>

<p>"What is it?" whispered Elwood.</p>

<p>"<em>It is land!</em>" was the joyful reply. "I am walking upon
the sand this minute, and you can do the same!"</p>
