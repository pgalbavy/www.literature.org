<p>At that instant, Nick Ribsam felt himself suddenly lifted in
air and spinning forward with great speed on the back of the vigorous
hog, which plunged between his rather short legs.</p>

<p>The astounded lad instantly stopped laughing, and, dropping his
gun and torch, grasped at something to sustain himself against
the peril, the nature of which he could hardly guess.</p>

<p>The hog had struck him from the front, so that Nick was seated
in reverse position on his back. The object which he grasped was
the spiral tail of the animal, but, before he could make his grip
certain, the porker swerved so suddenly to one side that Nick
rolled off and bumped against a tree.</p>

<p>His body was not hurt to one half the extent that his feelings
were, for he heard Sam Harper roaring with mirth, loud enough
to be heard half a mile; and as Nick hastily clambered upon his
feet, he was certain Herbert's cracked laugh was also rending
the night air.</p>

<p>The porker, having made the round and paid his tribute to each
member of the company in turn, whisked off into the woods, with
a triumphant grunt, as if to say, "I guess you folks and your
dog will let me alone now."</p>

<p>As soon as the boys found their guns, and restored two of the
torches to a blaze, they looked at each other and gave way to
their unrestrained mirth for several minutes before they could
speak so as to be understood.</p>

<p>Never had a pompous expedition ended more ignobly: they had started
out to attack a fierce black bear, and unexpectedly were overturned
by a large-sized pig, which resented the interference with his
slumber.</p>

<p>Some naturalists maintain that many animals possess a sense of
the humorous, and it looked as though the sluggish Bowser enjoyed
the joke as much as did the victims; for, when the latter made
their way back to the camp fire, they saw the hound stretched
out close to the warm blaze with his head between his paws and
apparently asleep; but, watching him closely, he was seen to open
one of his eyes, just a little ways, and, surveying them a minute,
he closed it to open again a minute later.</p>

<p>No animal could have said more plainly:</p>

<p>"I've got the joke on you this time, boys, and I'm laughing so
hard that I can't keep my eyes open."</p>

<p>"I tell you there is a good deal more in the heads of brutes
than many of us think," said Nick Ribsam, after he had studied
the actions of the hound; "I believe he wanted to make us believe
there was some sort of game out there so as to play the fool with
us."</p>

<p>"Do you think he foresaw the trick of the hog?" asked Herbert,
who was rubbing his bruised elbows and knees.</p>

<p>"That would have been impossible, for we could not have foreseen
it ourselves if we had arranged the joke; he simply meant to mislead
us, and then we acted the fool for <em>his</em> amusement."</p>

<p>It looked very much as if Nick Ribsam was correct in his supposition,
and that Bowser enjoyed even more than they the shrewd trick he
had played on them.</p>

<p>"I suppose there are several hundred hogs wandering through the
woods," said Nick, "picking up acorns and nuts that have fallen
off the trees, and making a good living at it."</p>

<p>"Yes, lots of them have been running wild for weeks and months,"
added Sam, "and when their owners try to gather them in, there
will be trouble, for it doesn't take hogs long to become savage."</p>

<p>"It didn't take that hog very long, I'm sure," observed Herbert,
sitting down with care upon the ground.</p>

<p>"But how was it there was but <em>one</em>?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"There wasn't need of any more than one," said Nick; "he had
no trouble in doing as he pleased with us."</p>

<p>"But hogs go in droves, and you wouldn't be apt to find one of
them by himself in the woods."</p>

<p>"There were others close by, for I am sure I heard them; but
it is a little curious that they didn't attack us, for hogs don't
know as much as dogs, and they had no reason to feel that one
of their number was more than enough for us."</p>

<p>"I don't see the use in talking about it," remarked Herbert,
who gently tipped his body to the other side, so as to rest differently
on the ground; "I am sure I never was so upset in all my life."</p>

<p>"Nor were we," added Nick; "hogs are queer creatures; if a drove
finds it is going to be attacked by an enemy, the boars will place
themselves on the outside, with the sows and younger ones within,
so as to offer the best resistance to the bear or whatever it
is, and they will fight with great fury. In a wild state, they
can run fast, and when the tusks of the boars get to be six or
eight inches long, as they do in time, they are afraid of no animal
in the woods."</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Herbert, again shifting his position with
great care, but feeling interested in what the lad was telling.</p>

<p>"I suppose because they haven't any reason to be afraid. With
those frightful tusks curving upward from the lower jaw, and with
a strength like Sampson in their necks, they can rip up a bear,
a tiger, or any animal that dare attack them."</p>

<p>"I s'pose they're very strong, Nick?" continued Herbert.</p>

<p>"So strong, indeed, that one of the wild boars in Germany has
run under the horse of a hunter, and, lifting both clear from
the ground, trotted fifty yards with them, before the struggling
animal could get himself loose."</p>

<p>Herbert looked fixedly at the narrator for a moment, then solemnly
reached out his hand to Sam, for him to shake over the last astounding
statement, which was altogether too much for him to credit.</p>

<p>Sam Harper grasped the hand and wabbled it once or twice, but
said:</p>

<p>"It's as true as gospel, Herbert; I don't know anything about
it myself, but when Nick Ribsam tells you anything for truth,
you can make up your mind it is the truth and nothing else."</p>

<p>The friends lay for a long time by the camp fire, talking over
the events of the day, while Nick Ribsam gave them many wonderful
facts concerning the various wild animals found in different parts
of the world. The lad read everything he could obtain relating
to natural history, and his strong memory retained nearly all
the facts.</p>

<p>But, as the night wore on, all three began to feel drowsy, and
they made ready to sleep.</p>

<p>The arrangements for doing this were not so perfect as they could
wish. Not one of them had anything like a blanket, and, though
it was the time of the balmy Indian summer, the nights were quite
cold.</p>

<p>There was an abundance of wood around them, and they gathered
all they could possibly need. Then they heaped up a big lot of
leaves and lay down as close to each other as possible.</p>

<p>This was the best that could be done; but it gave a great advantage
to the one who lay in the middle, as the warmth of the others
kept him comfortable, while they were forced to turn one side
to the cold air.</p>

<p>By changing about, however, they got along quite well until past
midnight, when the pile of leaves caught fire and caused them
to leap to their feet with so much vigor that the outside ones
got sufficiently warm to last till daylight.</p>

<p>The friends were glad enough when it began growing red in the
east. They rose early, washed their hands and faces in the clear
brook, which flowed near at hand, using their handkerchiefs for
towels. Then a rabbit and couple of squirrels were shot, and,
with the same wolf-like appetites, they made a nourishing and
substantial meal.</p>

<p>The brook, from which they took a draught of clear, strengthening
water, lay a short distance to the south of their camp, that is,
between it and Shark Pond, which they passed the day before.</p>

<p>The three were standing by this stream, considering the best
thing to be done to get on the track of the bear, when Sam Harper
suddenly stopped talking and looked fixedly at a point a few yards
away. Then he walked slowly to it, without removing his gaze,
stooped down, and attentively scrutinized the ground.</p>

<p>Without speaking, he turned and beckoned to the others to approach.</p>
