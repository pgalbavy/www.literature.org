<p>For the sake of peace and quiet Denis had retired earlier on
this same afternoon to his bedroom. He wanted to work, but the
hour was a drowsy one, and lunch, so recently eaten, weighed heavily
on body and mind. The meridian demon was upon him; he was possessed
by that bored and hopeless post-prandial melancholy which the
coenobites of old knew and feared under the name of "accidie."
He felt, like Ernest Dowson, "a little weary." He was in the mood
to write something rather exquisite and gentle and quietist in
tone; something a little droopy and at the same time&mdash;how should
he put it?&mdash;a little infinite. He thought of Anne, of love hopeless
and unattainable. Perhaps that was the ideal kind of love, the
hopeless kind&mdash;the quiet, theoretical kind of love. In this sad
mood of repletion he could well believe it. He began to write.
One elegant quatrain had flowed from beneath his pen:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"A brooding love which is at most

</p>
<p>
The stealth of moonbeams when they slide,

</p>
<p>
Evoking colour’s bloodless ghost,

</p>
<p>
O’er some scarce-breathing breast or side..."

</p>
</div>
<p>when his attention was attracted by a sound from outside. He
looked down from his window; there they were, Anne and Gombauld,
talking, laughing together. They crossed the courtyard in front,
and passed out of sight through the gate in the right-hand wall.
That was the way to the green close and the granary; she was going
to sit for him again. His pleasantly depressing melancholy was
dissipated by a puff of violent emotion; angrily he threw his
quatrain into the waste-paper basket and ran downstairs. "The
stealth of moonbeams," indeed!</p>

<p>In the hall he saw Mr. Scogan; the man seemed to be lying in
wait. Denis tried to escape, but in vain. Mr. Scogan’s eye glittered
like the eye of the Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p>"Not so fast," he said, stretching out a small saurian hand with
pointed nails&mdash;"not so fast. I was just going down to the flower
garden to take the sun. We’ll go together."</p>

<p>Denis abandoned himself; Mr. Scogan put on his hat and they went
out arm in arm. On the shaven turf of the terrace Henry Wimbush
and Mary were playing a solemn game of bowls. They descended by
the yew-tree walk. It was here, thought Denis, here that Anne
had fallen, here that he had kissed her, here&mdash;and he blushed
with retrospective shame at the memory&mdash;here that he had tried
to carry her and failed. Life was awful!</p>

<p>"Sanity!" said Mr. Scogan, suddenly breaking a long silence.
"Sanity&mdash;that’s what’s wrong with me and that’s what will be wrong
with you, my dear Denis, when you’re old enough to be sane or
insane. In a sane world I should be a great man; as things are,
in this curious establishment, I am nothing at all; to all intents
and purposes I don’t exist. I am just Vox et praeterea nihil."</p>

<p>Denis made no response; he was thinking of other things. "After
all,"  he said to himself&mdash;"after all, Gombauld is better looking
than I, more entertaining, more confident; and, besides, he’s
already somebody and I’m still only potential..."</p>

<p>"Everything that ever gets done in this world is done by madmen,"
Mr. Scogan went on. Denis tried not to listen, but the tireless
insistence of Mr. Scogan’s discourse gradually compelled his attention.
"Men such as I am, such as you may possibly become, have never
achieved anything. We’re too sane; we’re merely reasonable. We
lack the human touch, the compelling enthusiastic mania. People
are quite ready to listen to the philosophers for a little amusement,
just as they would listen to a fiddler or a mountebank. But as
to acting on the advice of the men of reason&mdash;never. Wherever
the choice has had to be made between the man of reason and the
madman, the world has unhesitatingly followed the madman. For
the madman appeals to what is fundamental, to passion and the
instincts; the philosophers to what is superficial and supererogatory&mdash;reason."</p>

<p>They entered the garden; at the head of one of the alleys stood
a green wooden bench, embayed in the midst of a fragrant continent
of lavender bushes. It was here, though the place was shadeless
and one breathed hot, dry perfume instead of air&mdash;it was here
that Mr. Scogan elected to sit. He thrived on untempered sunlight.</p>

<p>"Consider, for example, the case of Luther and Erasmus." He took
out his pipe and began to fill it as he talked. "There was Erasmus,
a man of reason if ever there was one. People listened to him
at first&mdash;a new virtuoso performing on that elegant and resourceful
instrument, the intellect; they even admired and venerated him.
But did he move them to behave as he wanted them to behave&mdash;reasonably,
decently, or at least a little less porkishly than usual? He did
not. And then Luther appears, violent, passionate, a madman insanely
convinced about matters in which there can be no conviction. He
shouted, and men rushed to follow him. Erasmus was no longer listened
to; he was reviled for his reasonableness. Luther was serious,
Luther was reality&mdash;like the Great War. Erasmus was only reason
and decency; he lacked the power, being a sage, to move men to
action. Europe followed Luther and embarked on a century and a
half of war and bloody persecution. It’s a melancholy story."
Mr. Scogan lighted a match. In the intense light the flame was
all but invisible. The smell of burning tobacco began to mingle
with the sweetly acrid smell of the lavender.</p>

<p>"If you want to get men to act reasonably, you must set about
persuading them in a maniacal manner. The very sane precepts of
the founders of religions are only made infectious by means of
enthusiasms which to a sane man must appear deplorable. It is
humiliating to find how impotent unadulterated sanity is. Sanity,
for example, informs us that the only way in which we can preserve
civilisation is by behaving decently and intelligently. Sanity
appeals and argues; our rulers persevere in their customary porkishness,
while we acquiesce and obey. The only hope is a maniacal crusade;
I am ready, when it comes, to beat a tambourine with the loudest,
but at the same time I shall feel a little ashamed of myself.
However" &mdash;Mr. Scogan shrugged his shoulders and, pipe in
hand, made a gesture of resignation&mdash;"It’s futile to complain
that things are as they are. The fact remains that sanity unassisted
is useless. What we want, then, is a sane and reasonable exploitation
of the forces of insanity. We sane men will have the power yet."
Mr. Scogan’s eyes shone with a more than ordinary brightness,
and, taking his pipe out of his mouth, he gave vent to his loud,
dry, and somehow rather fiendish laugh.</p>

<p>"But I don’t want power," said Denis. He was sitting in limp
discomfort at one end of the bench, shading his eyes from the
intolerable light. Mr. Scogan, bolt upright at the other end,
laughed again.</p>

<p>"Everybody wants power," he said. "Power in some form or other.
The sort of power you hanker for is literary power. Some people
want power to persecute other human beings; you expend your lust
for power in persecuting words, twisting them, moulding them,
torturing them to obey you. But I divagate."</p>

<p>"Do you?" asked Denis faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Scogan continued, unheeding, "the time will come.
We men of intelligence will learn to harness the insanities to
the service of reason. We can’t leave the world any longer to
the direction of chance. We can’t allow dangerous maniacs like
Luther, mad about dogma, like Napoleon, mad about himself, to
go on casually appearing and turning everything upside down. In
the past it didn’t so much matter; but our modern machine is too
delicate. A few more knocks like the Great War, another Luther
or two, and the whole concern will go to pieces. In future, the
men of reason must see that the madness of the world’s maniacs
is canalised into proper channels, is made to do useful work,
like a mountain torrent driving a dynamo..."</p>

<p>"Making electricity to light a Swiss hotel," said Denis. "You
ought to complete the simile."</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan waved away the interruption. "There’s only one thing
to be done," he said. "The men of intelligence must combine, must
conspire, and seize power from the imbeciles and maniacs who now
direct us. They must found the Rational State."</p>

<p>The heat that was slowly paralysing all Denis’s mental and bodily
faculties, seemed to bring to Mr. Scogan additional vitality.
He talked with an ever-increasing energy, his hands moved in sharp,
quick, precise gestures, his eyes shone. Hard, dry, and continuous,
his voice went on sounding and sounding in Denis’s ears with the
insistence of a mechanical noise.</p>

<p>"In the Rational State," he heard Mr. Scogan saying, "human beings
will be separated out into distinct species, not according to
the colour of their eyes or the shape of their skulls, but according
to the qualities of their mind and temperament. Examining psychologists,
trained to what would now seem an almost superhuman clairvoyance,
will test each child that is born and assign it to its proper
species. Duly labelled and docketed, the child will be given the
education suitable to members of its species, and will be set,
in adult life, to perform those functions which human beings of
his variety are capable of performing."</p>

<p>"How many species will there be?" asked Denis.</p>

<p>"A great many, no doubt," Mr. Scogan answered; "the classification
will be subtle and elaborate. But it is not in the power of a
prophet to go into details, nor is it his business. I will do
more than indicate the three main species into which the subjects
of the Rational State will be divided."</p>

<p>He paused, cleared his throat, and coughed once or twice, evoking
in Denis’s mind the vision of a table with a glass and water-bottle,
and, lying across one corner, a long white pointer for the lantern
pictures.</p>

<p>"The three main species," Mr. Scogan went on, "will be these:
the Directing Intelligences, the Men of Faith, and the Herd. Among
the Intelligences will be found all those capable of thought,
those who know how to attain a certain degree of freedom&mdash;and,
alas, how limited, even among the most intelligent, that freedom
is!&mdash;from the mental bondage of their time. A select body of Intelligences,
drawn from among those who have turned their attention to the
problems of practical life, will be the governors of the Rational
State. They will employ as their instruments of power the second
great species of humanity&mdash;the men of Faith, the Madmen, as I
have been calling them, who believe in things unreasonably, with
passion, and are ready to die for their beliefs and their desires.
These wild men, with their fearful potentialities for good or
for mischief, will no longer be allowed to react casually to a
casual environment. There will be no more Caesar Borgias, no more
Luthers and Mohammeds, no more Joanna Southcotts, no more Comstocks.
The old-fashioned Man of Faith and Desire, that haphazard creature
of brute circumstance, who might drive men to tears and repentance,
or who might equally well set them on to cutting one another’s
throats, will be replaced by a new sort of madman, still externally
the same, still bubbling with a seemingly spontaneous enthusiasm,
but, ah, how very different from the madman of the past! For the
new Man of Faith will be expending his passion, his desire, and
his enthusiasm in the propagation of some reasonable idea. He
will be, all unawares, the tool of some superior intelligence."</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan chuckled maliciously; it was as though he were taking
a revenge, in the name of reason, on enthusiasts. "From their
earliest years, as soon, that is, as the examining psychologists
have assigned them their place in the classified scheme, the Men
of Faith will have had their special education under the eye of
the Intelligences. Moulded by a long process of suggestion, they
will go out into the world, preaching and practising with a generous
mania the coldly reasonable projects of the Directors from above.
When these projects are accomplished, or when the ideas that were
useful a decade ago have ceased to be useful, the Intelligences
will inspire a new generation of madmen with a new eternal truth.
The principal function of the Men of Faith will be to move and
direct the Multitude, that third great species consisting of those
countless millions who lack intelligence and are without valuable
enthusiasm. When any particular effort is required of the Herd,
when it is thought necessary, for the sake of solidarity, that
humanity shall be kindled and united by some single enthusiastic
desire or idea, the Men of Faith, primed with some simple and
satisfying creed, will be sent out on a mission of evangelisation.
At ordinary times, when the high spiritual temperature of a Crusade
would be unhealthy, the Men of Faith will be quietly and earnestly
busy with the great work of education. In the upbringing of the
Herd, humanity’s almost boundless suggestibility will be scientifically
exploited. Systematically, from earliest infancy, its members
will be assured that there is no happiness to be found except
in work and obedience; they will be made to believe that they
are happy, that they are tremendously important beings, and that
everything they do is noble and significant. For the lower species
the earth will be restored to the centre of the universe and man
to pre-eminence on the earth. Oh, I envy the lot of the commonality
in the Rational State! Working their eight hours a day, obeying
their betters, convinced of their own grandeur and significance
and immortality, they will be marvellously happy, happier than
any race of men has ever been. They will go through life in a
rosy state of intoxication, from which they will never awake.
The Men of Faith will play the cup-bearers at this lifelong bacchanal,
filling and ever filling again with the warm liquor that the Intelligences,
in sad and sober privacy behind the scenes, will brew for the
intoxication of their subjects."</p>

<p>"And what will be my place in the Rational State?" Denis drowsily
inquired from under his shading hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan looked at him for a moment in silence. "It’s difficult
to see where you would fit in," he said at last. "You couldn’t
do manual work; you’re too independent and unsuggestible to belong
to the larger Herd; you have none of the characteristics required
in a Man of Faith. As for the Directing Intelligences, they will
have to be marvellously clear and merciless and penetrating."
He paused and shook his head. "No, I can see no place for you;
only the lethal chamber."</p>

<p>Deeply hurt, Denis emitted the imitation of a loud Homeric laugh.
"I’m getting sunstroke here," he said, and got up.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan followed his example, and they walked slowly away
down the narrow path, brushing the blue lavender flowers in their
passage. Denis pulled a sprig of lavender and sniffed at it; then
some dark leaves of rosemary that smelt like incense in a cavernous
church. They passed a bed of opium poppies, dispetaled now; the
round, ripe seedheads were brown and dry&mdash;like Polynesian trophies,
Denis thought; severed heads stuck on poles. He liked the fancy
enough to impart it to Mr. Scogan.</p>

<p>"Like Polynesian trophies..." Uttered aloud, the fancy seemed
less charming and significant than it did when it first occurred
to him.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and in a growing wave of sound the whir
of the reaping machines swelled up from the fields beyond the
garden and then receded into a remoter hum.</p>

<p>"It is satisfactory to think," said Mr. Scogan, as they strolled
slowly onward, "that a multitude of people are toiling in the
harvest fields in order that we may talk of Polynesia. Like every
other good thing in this world, leisure and culture have to be
paid for. Fortunately, however, it is not the leisured and the
cultured who have to pay. Let us be duly thankful for that, my
dear Denis&mdash;duly thankful," he repeated, and knocked the ashes
out of his pipe.</p>

<p>Denis was not listening. He had suddenly remembered Anne. She
was with Gombauld&mdash;alone with him in his studio. It was an intolerable
thought.</p>

<p>"Shall we go and pay a call on Gombauld?" he suggested carelessly.
"It would be amusing to see what he’s doing now."</p>

<p>He laughed inwardly to think how furious Gombauld would be when
he saw them arriving.</p>
