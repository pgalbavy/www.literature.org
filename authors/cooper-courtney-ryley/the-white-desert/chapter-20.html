<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was no time for conjectures.  The woman meant a human life,--in
deadly need of resuscitation, and Barry leaped to his task.
</p>
<p>Warmth was the first consideration, and he hurried to the sheet-iron
stove, with its pile of wood stacked behind, noticing, as he built the
fire, cans and packages of provisions upon the shelf over the small
wooden table, evidence that some one other than the woman herself had
looked after the details of stocking the cabin with food and of
providing against emergencies.  At least a portion of the wood as he
shoved it into the stove crackled and spit with the wetness of snow;
the box had been replenished, evidently within the last few days.
</p><p>Soon water was boiling.  Hot cloths went to the woman's head; quietly,
reverently, Barry had taken the still, small child from the tightly
clenched arm and covered it, on the little table.  And with the touch
of the small, lifeless form, the resentment which had smoldered in
Houston's heart for months seemed to disappear.  Instinctively he knew
what a baby means to a mother,--and she must be its mother.  He
understood that the agony of loss which was hers was far greater even
than the agony which her faithlessness had meant for him.  Gently,
almost tenderly, he went again to the bed, to chafe the cold, thin
wrists, to watch anxiously the eyes, then at last to bend forward.  The
woman was looking at him, staring with fright in her gaze, almost
terror.
</p><p>"Barry--" the word was more of a mumble.  "Barry--" then the eyes
turned, searching for the form that no longer was beside her.
"My--my--"  Then, with a spasm of realization, she was silent.  Houston
strove dully for words.
</p><p>"I'm sorry--Agnes.  Don't be afraid of me.  I'll get help for you."
</p><p>"Don't."  The voice was a monotone, minus expression, almost minus
life.  The face had become blank, so much parchment drawn over bone.
"I've been sick--my baby--where's my baby?"
</p><p>"Don't you know?"
</p><p>"Yes," came at last.  There was the dullness that comes when grief has
reached the breaking point.  "Dead.  It died--yesterday morning."
</p><p>Houston could say nothing in answer.  The simple statement was too
tragic, too full of meaning, too fraught with the agony of that long
day and night of suffering, for any reply in words that would not jar,
or cause even a greater pang.  Quietly he turned to the stove, red-hot
now, and with snow water began the making of gruel from the supplies on
the shelf.  Once he turned, suddenly aware that the eyes of the woman
were centered in his direction.  But they were not upon him; their gaze
was for one thing, one alone,--that tiny, covered form on the table.
</p><p>An hour passed silently, except for the trivialities of speech
accompanying the proffered food.  Then, at last, forcing himself to the
subject, Houston asked a question:
</p><p>"Where is he?"
</p><p>"Who?"  Sudden fright had come into the woman's eyes.  A name formed on
Houston's lips, only to be forced back into the more general query:
</p><p>"Your husband."
</p><p>She smiled faintly.
</p><p>"You've got me, haven't you, Barry?"  A half-hysterical tone came now.
"You know a lot--and you want the rest, so you can pay me back, don't
you?  Oh," and the thin fingers plucked at the bedclothes, "I expected
it!  I expected it!  I knew sooner or later--"
</p><p>"If you're talking about me, Agnes--and what I've been led to believe,
we'll save that for a future time.  I think I'm enough of a man not to
harass a person in time of grief."
</p><p>"Coals of fire, eh?"  A tinge of her old expression had come back, with
returning strength.
</p><p>"Nothing of the kind.  I simply wanted to help you--because you're a
woman in trouble.  You're sick.  Your baby's--gone.  If I can get your
husband for you, I--"
</p><p>But she shook her head, suddenly weak and broken, suddenly only what
Barry was trying to make of her in his mind, a grieving woman, in need.
</p><p>"We're--not married.  You'll know it sooner or later.  I--I don't know
where he is.  He was here three days ago and was coming back that
night.  But he didn't.  Maybe he's gone--he'd threatened it."
</p><p>"He?  You mean--"
</p><p>She pressed her lips tight.
</p><p>"I'm not going to tell--yet.  You've got to do something for me first.
I'm in trouble--" she was speaking rapidly now, the words flooding over
her lips between gasps, her eyes set, her hands knitting.  "My baby's
dead.  You know that, don't you?" she asked suddenly, in apparent
forgetfulness of any previous conversation.  "My baby's dead.  It died
yesterday morning--all day long I held it in my arms and cried.  Then I
slept, didn't I?"
</p><p>"You were unconscious."
</p><p>"Maybe I'm going to die."  There was childishness in the voice.  "Like
my baby.  I baptized her before she went.  Maybe I'm going to die too."
</p><p>"I hope not, Agnes."
</p><p>"You'd like to see me die!"  The frail bonds of an illness-ridden brain
were straining at their leash.  "I can see it in your eyes.  You'd like
to see me die!"
</p><p>"Why?" he could think of nothing else.
</p><p>"Because--" and then she stopped.  "No--you're trying to get me to
tell--but I won't; I'll tell when you come back--I'll tell what I said
and did when you bring me the note from the priest.  You want me to
tell, don't you?  Don't you?  That's what you came here for.  You found
out I was here.  I--did he tell?" she asked sharply.
</p><p>Barry shook his head.
</p><p>"I don't know who you mean, Agnes."
</p><p>"No?  I think you're--"
</p><p>"I was on my way over the range.  I got lost in the storm and stumbled
in here."  He looked out.  "It's let up some now.  Maybe I could find
my way back to town--you must have a doctor."
</p><p>"I don't want a doctor!  I want to go--with my baby.  And I don't want
him to know--understand that--" with a struggle she raised to one
elbow, eyes suddenly blazing with the flashes of her disordered brain,
features strained and excited.  "I don't want him to know!  He ran away
and left me for three days.  The fire went out--my baby--" hysterical
laughter broke from her dry lips--"My baby died, and still he didn't
come.  He--"
</p><p>"Agnes!"  Houston grasped her hands.  "Try to control yourself!  Maybe
he couldn't get back.  The storm--"
</p><p>"Yes, the storm!  It's always the storm!  We would have been
married--but there was the storm.  He couldn't marry me months
ago--when I found out--and when I came back out here!  He couldn't
marry me then.  'Wait'; that's what he always said--'wait--' and I
waited.  Now--" then the voice trailed off--"it's been three days.  He
promised to be back.  But--"
</p><p>Houston sought to end the repetition.
</p><p>"Perhaps I could find him and bring him here."
</p><p>But it was useless.  The woman drifted back to her rambling statements.
Laughter and tears followed one another in quick succession; the
breaking of restraint had come at last.  At last she turned, and
staring with glazed eyes into those of Houston, burst forth.
</p><p>"You hate me, don't you?"
</p><p>"I--"
</p><p>"Don't deny it!"  Querulous imperiousness was in the voice.  "You hate
me--you'll go back to Boston and tell my mother about this.  I
know--you've got the upper hand now.  You'll tell her why I came out
here--you'll tell her about the baby, won't you?  Yes, you'll--"
</p><p>"I'll tell nothing of the sort, Agnes.  I don't fight that way.  You
ought to know that.  You've been my enemy, I'll admit.  I've felt
bitter, terribly so, against you.  I believed that you used my trust to
betray me.  But I believe I know the reason now.  Besides, the harm's
done.  It's in the past.  I fight men, not women."
</p><p>"Do you want help?"  A thin hand stretched out.  "Will you give me a
promise--if I give you one?"
</p><p>"About what, Agnes?"
</p><p>"My baby.  You--you're not going to let it stay there?  You're--"
</p><p>"I hardly know what to do.  I thought after you were better, I'd--"
</p><p>"I'm better now."  She tried to rise.  "I'm better--see?  I've more
strength.  You could leave me alone.  I--I want you to take my baby."
</p><p>"Where?"
</p><p>"Where she can sleep in peace--in hallowed ground.  I--I want a priest
for her.  Tell him that I baptized her Helena."
</p><p>"Yes.  And the other name?"
</p><p>A weird laugh came from the colorless lips.
</p><p>"She hasn't one."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>"Then use mine--so you'll have evidence that I'm not married.  Use
mine, if that's the kind of a man you are--so you can go back and tell
them--back home--that I--I--"  The last bond had snapped.  She caught
at him with clawing hands, her eyes wild, her teeth showing from behind
tightly drawn lips.  "Torture me--that's it--torture me!  At least, I
didn't do that to you!  I told you that I believed in you--at least
that cheered you up when you needed it--I didn't tell you that I
believed you guilty.  Did I?  I didn't continually ask you for the name
of the man you'd killed?  Oh, there were other things--I know there
were other things--" the lips seemed to fairly stream words, "but at
least, I didn't torture you.  I--I--"
</p><p>Then she halted, for the briefest part of a moment, to become suddenly
madly cajoling, crazily cunning:
</p><p>"Listen, Barry, listen to me.  You want to know things.  I can tell
them to you--oh, so many of them.  I'll tell them too--if you'll only
do this for me.  It's my baby--my baby.  Don't you know what that
means?  Won't you promise for me?  Take her to a priest--please,
Barry--for what you once thought I was?  Won't you, Barry?  Haven't I
had punishment enough?  Did you ever lie all day and listen to the wind
shriek, waiting for somebody who didn't come--with your dead baby in
your arms?  Do you want to punish me more?  Do you want me to die
too--or do you want me to live and tell you why I did the things I did?
Do you?  Do you want to know who was back of everything?  I didn't do
it for myself, Barry.  It was some one else--I'll help you, Barry,
honestly I'll help you."
</p><p>"About the murder?"  Houston was leaning forward now, tense, hopeful.
But the woman shook her head.
</p><p>"No--I don't know about that.  Maybe you did it--I can't say.  It's
about other things--the lease, and the contract.  I'll help you about
that--if you'll help me.  Take my baby--"
</p><p>"And keep your secret, Agnes?  Is that it?"
</p><p>"Will you?"  The woman's eyes were gleaming strangely.  "My mother
doesn't know.  She's old--you know her, Barry.  She thinks I'm--what I
should have been.  That's why I came back out here.  I--I--"
</p><p>The man rose.  He walked to the window and stood for a long time
looking out, trying to close his ears to the ramblings of the woman on
the bed, striving to find a way to keep the promise she sought.  For
just a moment the old hatred flooded through him, the resentment toward
this being who had been an integral factor in all the troubles which
had pursued him in his efforts to beat back to a new life.  But as
swift as they came, they faded.  No longer was she an enemy; only a
broken, beaten woman, her empty arms aching as her heart ached;
harassed by fears of exposure to the one woman in whom she still
desired to be held in honor, of the whereabouts of the man who had led
her on through the byways of love into a dismal maze of chicanery.
Only a woman, ill, perhaps dying.  A woman crying out for the one boon
that she could ask of a person she knew to distrust and despise her,
seeking the thing that now was her greatest desire in the world, and
willing to promise--whether truthfully or not, Barry had no way of
telling--to reveal to him secrets of the past, if he would but comply.
Was she honest?  As he stood there looking out at the snow, it seemed
to make little difference.  Was she sincere?  He would strive to aid a
dumb brute if he found it in distress.  At last he turned and walked to
the bed.
</p><p>"I'll promise, Agnes.  If you want to help me afterward, well and good.
If not--you are free to do as you please.  I suppose you want her
dressed before--"
</p><p>"Yes."  The woman had raised eagerly.  "There are clothes--she's never
had on--in the bottom drawer of that old bureau.  Take them with you.
Then look in a box in the top drawer.  You'll find a crucifix.
They--they might want to put it on her."
</p><p>She sank back in the bed, and Barry went to his task of searching the
drawers of the rickety old bureau.  In a mass of tangled, old-fashioned
jewelry, he found the crucifix, its chain broken and twisted, and
placed it in a pocket.  Then he turned to the grimmer task,--and the
good-by.  A half-hour later, white-featured, his arms cupped gently
about a blanket-wrapped form, he stepped forth into the storm, and
bending against the wind, turned toward the railroad in obedience to
the hazy directions of the sobbing woman he had left behind.
</p><p>The snowfall was lighter now; he could find his way more easily.  A
half-hour passed, and he stopped, kneeling and resting the tiny, still
bundle upon his knees to relieve his aching arms.  Then on again in
plodding perseverance,--fulfilling a promise to a woman who had done
her best to wreck his existence.
</p><p>A mile farther, and the railroad telegraph poles appeared.  Houston saw
them with grateful eyes, though with concern.  He knew to a certainty
that there was no priest in Tabernacle, and what his story would be
when he got there was a little more than he could hazard.  To Ba'tiste,
he would tell the truth; to others, there must simply be some
fabrication that would hold for the moment and that would allow him to
go on--while Ba'tiste--
</p><p>But suddenly he ceased his plans.  Black splotches against the snow,
two figures suddenly had come out of the sweeping veil,--a girl and a
man.  Something akin to panic seized Houston.  The man was Lost Wing,
faithfully in the background as usual.  The girl was Medaine Robinette.
</p><p>For once Houston hoped that she would pass him as usual,--with averted
eyes.  He did not care to make explanations, to be forced to lie to
her.  But Fate was against him.  A moment more and the storm closed in
again, with one of its fitful gusts, only to clear at last and to leave
them face to face.  Medaine's eyes went with womanly instinct to the
bundle in his arms.  And even though she could see nothing but the
roundness of the blankets, the tender manner in which Barry Houston
held the poor, inanimate little parcel was enough.
</p><p>"A baby!"  There was surprise in her tone.  Forgetting for the moment
her aversion to the man himself, she came forward, touching the
blankets, then lifting one edge ever so slightly that she might peer
beneath.  "Where did you find it?  Whose is it?"
</p><p>Houston sought vainly for words.  He stammered,--a promise made to an
enemy struggling for supremacy.  And the words seem to come unbidden:
</p><p>"Does it matter?"
</p><p>"Of course not."  She looked at him queerly.  "I merely thought I could
be of assistance."
</p><p>"You can.  Tell me where I can find a priest."
</p><p>"A priest?"
</p><p>"Yes, I need him--the baby is dead."
</p><p>"Oh."  She touched the bundle ever so softly.  "I didn't know."  Then
with a sudden thought; "But her mother.  She must need--"
</p><p>"Only a doctor.  I will try to get Ba'tiste to come out."
</p><p>"But couldn't I--"
</p><p>"I'm sorry."  Barry tried in vain for the words that would tell her the
truth, yet tell her nothing.  He felt that he was miring himself
hopelessly, that his denials and his efforts at secrecy could cause
only one idea to form in her brain.  He wanted to tell her the truth,
to ask her aid, to send her back into the woods to the assistance of
the stricken woman there.  But he could not frame the request.
Instead, "I--I can't tell you.  I've given a woman my word.  She
wouldn't understand--if you went there.  With Ba'tiste, it is
different.  He is a doctor.  He has a right.  I--I--"
</p><p>"I understand," came quietly, and in those two words Houston felt that
her opinion had been formed; that to her, he was the father; the quiet
form in his arms his own child!  It was like a blow to him; yet it was
only what he had expected from the moment that he had recognized her.
And after all, he felt that it did not matter; it was only one more
false accusation to be added to the total, only one more height to be
added to the barrier which already existed between them.  He accepted
her attitude--in spite of the pain it brought--and faced her.
</p><p>"You were willing to help--before you--knew.  You would have been glad
to help in the case of a stranger.  Are you still willing--now?"
</p><p>She hesitated a moment, her eyes downcast, at last to force a smile.
</p><p>"Of course.  But you are asking something almost impossible.  The
nearest priest is at Crestline."
</p><p>"Crestline?"  Houston instinctively turned toward the hills, a bleak,
forbidding wall against the sky.  "I--"
</p><p>"Rather, a mile below there at the Croatian settlement on Mount Harris.
I am afraid you couldn't find it."
</p><p>"I can try.  Will you lend me Lost Wing to run an errand?  I want to
get Ba'tiste--for her."
</p><p>"Certainly."
</p><p>"May I talk to him privately?  He understands English?"
</p><p>She nodded.  Then:
</p><p>"I will tell Lost Wing that anything you have to say to him shall be a
secret even from me.  I--do not want to know it."
</p><p>She spoke to the Indian in Sioux then and drew away, her eyes on the
tracings of a snowshoe.  Houston, pointing with his head, gave the
Indian his directions.
</p><p>"A woman is sick in a cabin, two miles straight west from here.  Get
Ba'tiste Renaud and take him there.  Turn away from the stream at a
tall, dead lodgepole and go to the left.  You will see the cabin.  I
would rather that you would not go in and that you know nothing about
the woman.  Tell Ba'tiste that her name must stay a secret until she
herself is willing that it be otherwise.  Do you understand?"
</p><p>"A'ri."  The Indian went then toward his mistress, waiting her sanction
to the mission.  She looked at Barry Houston.
</p><p>"Have you given him his directions?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then, Lost Wing, do as he has told you."
</p><p>The Sioux started on, soon to be engulfed in the swirling veil of the
storm.  Barry turned again to the girl.
</p><p>"Just one more request: I can't carry the child up there--this way.
Will you help strap her to my pack?"
</p><p>Silently she assisted him in the grim task of mercy.  Then:
</p><p>"Do you know the Pass?"
</p><p>"I can find my way."
</p><p>"Do you know it?"
</p><p>He shook his head.  She tapped one glove against the other.
</p><p>"It is impossible then.  You--"
</p><p>"I'll make it some way.  Thank you--for helping me."
</p><p>He started on.  But she called him back.
</p><p>"It's dangerous--too dangerous," and there was a note of pity in her
voice.  "It's bad enough on foot when there's no snow--if you're not
familiar with it.  I--"
</p><p>"Tell me the way.  Perhaps I could find it.  It's not for myself.  I
made a promise to the child's mother.  I'm afraid she's dying."
</p><p>A new light came into the girl's eyes, a light of compassion, of utmost
pity,--the pity that one can feel for some one who has transgressed,
some one who faces the penalty, who feels the lash of the whip, yet
does not cry out.  Slowly she came toward Houston, then bent to tighten
the fastenings of her snowshoes.
</p><p>"I know the way," came quietly.  "I have been over it--in summer and
winter.  I will show you."
</p><p>"You!  Medaine!  I--I--beg pardon."  The outburst had passed his lips
almost before he realized it.  "Miss Robinette, you don't know what
you're saying.  It's all a man could do to make that climb.  I--"
</p><p>"I know the way," she answered, without indicating that she had heard
his remonstrance.  "I am glad to go--for the sake of--"  She nodded
slightly toward the tenderly wrapped bundle on the pack.  "I would not
feel right otherwise."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>Then she faced him.
</p><p>"I am not afraid," came with a quiet assurance that spoke more than
words.  It told Barry Houston that this little woman of the hills was
willing to help him, although she loathed him; that she was willing to
undergo hardships, to quell her own dislike for the man she aided that
she might give him assistance in a time of death.  And he thrilled with
it, in spite of the false beliefs that he knew existed in the mind of
Medaine Robinette.  It gave him a pride in her,--even though he knew
this pride to be gained at the loss of his own prestige.  And more than
all, it made him glad that he had played the man back there in the
little, lonely cabin, where lay a sorrow-crazed woman, grieving for a
child who was gone; that he too had been big enough and strong enough
to forget the past in the exigencies of the moment; that he had aided
where he might have hindered; that he had soothed where a lesser nature
might have stormed.  He bowed his head in acknowledgment of her
announcement.  Then, side by side, affixing the stout cord that was to
form a bond of safety between two alien souls, they started forth, a
man who had been accused, but who was strong enough to rise above it,
and a woman whose woman-heart had dictated that dislike, distrust, even
physical fear be subjugated to the greater, nobler purpose of human
charity.
