<p>&quot;I'm getting up, Teddilinks,&quot; said Mrs Whiston, and she sprang out
of bed briskly.</p>

<p>&quot;What the Hanover's got you?&quot; asked Whiston.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing.  Can't I get up?&quot; she replied animatedly.</p>

<p>It was about seven o'clock, scarcely light yet in the cold bedroom.
Whiston lay still and looked at his wife.  She was a pretty little
thing, with her fleecy, short black hair all tousled . . .  He
watched her as she dressed quickly, flicking her small, delightful
limbs, throwing her clothes about her.  Her slovenliness and
untidiness did not trouble him.  When she picked up the edge of her
petticoat, ripped off a torn string of white lace, and flung it on
the dressing-table, her careless abandon made his spirit glow.  She
stood before the mirror and roughly scrambled together her profuse
little mane of hair.  He watched the quickness and softness of her
young shoulders, calmly, like a husband, and appreciatively.</p>

<p>&quot;Rise up,&quot; she cried, turning to him with a quick wave of her arm - 
&quot;and shine forth.&quot;</p>

<p>They had been married two years.  But still, when she had gone out
of the room, he felt as if all his light and warmth were taken
away, he became aware of the raw, cold morning.  So he rose
himself, wondering casually what had roused her so early.  Usually
she lay in bed as late as she could.</p>

<p>Whiston fastened a belt round his loins and went downstairs in
shirt and trousers.  He heard her singing in her snatchy fashion.
The stairs creaked under his weight.  He passed down the narrow
little passage, which she called a hall, of the seven and sixpenny
house which was his first home.</p>

<p>He was a shapely young fellow of about twenty-eight, sleepy now and
easy with well-being.  He heard the water drumming into the kettle,
and she began to whistle.  He loved the quick way she dodged the
supper cups under the tap to wash them for breakfast.  She looked
an untidy minx, but she was quick and handy enough.</p>

<p>&quot;Teddilinks,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Light a fire, quick.&quot;</p>

<p>She wore an old, sack-like dressing-jacket of black silk pinned
across her breast.  But one of the sleeves, coming unfastened,
showed some delightful pink upper-arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you sew your sleeve up?&quot; he said, suffering from the
sight of the exposed soft flesh.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; she cried, peering round.  &quot;Nuisance,&quot; she said, seeing
the gap, then with light fingers went on drying the cups.</p>

<p>The kitchen was of fair size, but gloomy.  Whiston poked out the
dead ashes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thud was heard at the door down the passage.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go,&quot; cried Mrs Whiston, and she was gone down the hall.</p>

<p>The postman was a ruddy-faced man who had been a soldier.  He
smiled broadly, handing her some packages.</p>

<p>&quot;They've not forgot you,&quot; he said impudently.</p>

<p>&quot;No - lucky for them,&quot; she said, with a toss of the head.  But she
was interested only in her envelopes this morning.  The postman
waited inquisitively, smiling in an ingratiating fashion.  She
slowly, abstractedly, as if she did not know anyone was there,
closed the door in his face, continuing to look at the addresses on
her letters.</p>

<p>She tore open the thin envelope.  There was a long, hideous,
cartoon valentine.  She smiled briefly and dropped it on the floor.
Struggling with the string of a packet, she opened a white
cardboard box, and there lay a white silk handkerchief packed
neatly under the paper lace of the box, and her initial, worked in
heliotrope, fully displayed.  She smiled pleasantly, and gently put
the box aside.  The third envelope contained another white packet - 
apparently a cotton handkerchief neatly folded.  She shook it out.
It was a long white stocking, but there was a little weight in the
toe.  Quickly, she thrust down her arm, wriggling her fingers into
the toe of the stocking, and brought out a small box.  She peeped
inside the box, then hastily opened a door on her left hand, and
went into the little, cold sitting-room.  She had her lower lip
caught earnestly between her teeth.</p>

<p>With a little flash of triumph, she lifted a pair of pearl ear-
rings from the small box, and she went to the mirror.  There,
earnestly, she began to hook them through her ears, looking at
herself sideways in the glass.  Curiously concentrated and intent
she seemed as she fingered the lobes of her ears, her head bent on
one side.</p>

<p>Then the pearl ear-rings dangled under her rosy, small ears.  She
shook her head sharply, to see the swing of the drops.  They went
chill against her neck, in little, sharp touches.  Then she stood
still to look at herself, bridling her head in the dignified
fashion.  Then she simpered at herself.  Catching her own eye, she
could not help winking at herself and laughing.</p>

<p>She turned to look at the box.  There was a scrap of paper with
this posy:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Pearls may be fair, but thou art fairer.<br />
 Wear these for me, and I'll love the wearer.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She made a grimace and a grin.  But she was drawn to the mirror
again, to look at her ear-rings.</p>

<p>Whiston had made the fire burn, so he came to look for her.  When
she heard him, she started round quickly, guiltily.  She was
watching him with intent blue eyes when he appeared.</p>

<p>He did not see much, in his morning-drowsy warmth.  He gave her, as
ever, a feeling of warmth and slowness.  His eyes were very blue,
very kind, his manner simple.</p>

<p>&quot;What ha' you got?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Valentines,&quot; she said briskly, ostentatiously turning to show him
the silk handkerchief.  She thrust it under his nose.  &quot;Smell how
good,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's that from?&quot; he replied, without smelling.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a valentine,&quot; she cried.  &quot;How da I know who it's from?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll bet you know,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ted! - I don't!&quot; she cried, beginning to shake her head, then
stopping because of the ear-rings.</p>

<p>He stood still a moment, displeased.</p>

<p>&quot;They've no right to send you valentines, now,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ted! - Why not?  You're not jealous, are you?  I haven't the least
idea who it's from.  Look - there's my initial&quot; - she pointed with an
emphatic finger at the heliotrope embroidery - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;E for Elsie,<br />
 Nice little gelsie,&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>she sang.</p>

<p>&quot;Get out,&quot; he said.  &quot;You know who it's from.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truth, I don't,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>He looked round, and saw the white stocking lying on a chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this another?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's a sample,&quot; she said.  &quot;There's only a comic.&quot;  And she
fetched in the long cartoon.</p>

<p>He stretched it out and looked at it solemnly.</p>

<p>&quot;Fools!&quot; he said, and went out of the room.</p>

<p>She flew upstairs and took off the ear-rings.  When she returned,
he was crouched before the fire blowing the coals.  The skin of his
face was flushed, and slightly pitted, as if he had had small-pox.
But his neck was white and smooth and goodly.  She hung her arms
round his neck as he crouched there, and clung to him.  He balanced
on his toes.</p>

<p>&quot;This fire's a slow-coach,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;And who else is a slow-coach?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;One of us two, I know,&quot; he said, and he rose carefully.  She
remained clinging round his neck, so that she was lifted off her
feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha! - swing me,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>He lowered his head, and she hung in the air, swinging from his
neck, laughing.  Then she slipped off.</p>

<p>&quot;The kettle is singing,&quot; she sang, flying for the teapot.  He bent
down again to blow the fire.  The veins in his neck stood out, his
shirt collar seemed too tight.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Doctor Wyer,<br />
 Blow the fire,<br />
 Puff! puff! puff!&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>she sang, laughing.</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>She was so glad because of her pearl ear-rings.</p>

<p>Over the breakfast she grew serious.  He did not notice.  She
became portentous in her gravity.  Almost it penetrated through his
steady good-humour to irritate him.</p>

<p>&quot;Teddy!&quot; she said at last.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you a lie,&quot; she said, humbly tragic.</p>

<p>His soul stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh aye?&quot; he said casually.</p>

<p>She was not satisfied.  He ought to be more moved.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He cut a piece of bread.</p>

<p>&quot;Was it a good one?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>She was piqued.  Then she considered - WAS it a good one?  Then she
laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;it wasn't up to much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said easily, but with a steady strength of fondness for
her in his tone.  &quot;Get it out then.&quot;</p>

<p>It became a little more difficult.</p>

<p>&quot;You know that white stocking,&quot; she said earnestly.  &quot;I told you a
lie.  It wasn't a sample.  It was a valentine.&quot;</p>

<p>A little frown came on his brow.</p>

<p>&quot;Then what did you invent it as a sample for?&quot; he said.  But he
knew this weakness of hers.  The touch of anger in his voice
frightened her.</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid you'd be cross,&quot; she said pathetically.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll bet you were vastly afraid,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I WAS, Teddy.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.  He was resolving one or two things in his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;And who sent it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I can guess,&quot; she said, &quot;though there wasn't a word with it - 
except - &quot;</p>

<p>She ran to the sitting-room and returned with a slip of paper.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;Pearls may be fair, but thou art fairer.<br />
 Wear these for me, and I'll love the wearer.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>He read it twice, then a dull red flush came on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;And WHO do you guess it is?&quot; he asked, with a ringing of anger in
his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I suspect it's Sam Adams,&quot; she said, with a little virtuous
indignation.</p>

<p>Whiston was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Fool!&quot; he said.  &quot;An' what's it got to do with pearls? - and how
can he say 'wear these for me' when there's only one?  He hasn't
got the brain to invent a proper verse.&quot;</p>

<p>He screwed the sup of paper into a ball and flung it into the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose he thinks it'll make a pair with the one last year,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, did he send one then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  I thought you'd be wild if you knew.&quot;</p>

<p>His jaw set rather sullenly.</p>

<p>Presently he rose, and went to wash himself, rolling back his
sleeves and pulling open his shirt at the breast.  It was as if his
fine, clear-cut temples and steady eyes were degraded by the lower,
rather brutal part of his face.  But she loved it.  As she whisked
about, clearing the table, she loved the way in which he stood
washing himself.  He was such a man.  She liked to see his neck
glistening with water as he swilled it.  It amused her and pleased
her and thrilled her.  He was so sure, so permanent, he had her so
utterly in his power.  It gave her a delightful, mischievous sense
of liberty.  Within his grasp, she could dart about excitingly.</p>

<p>He turned round to her, his face red from the cold water, his eyes
fresh and very blue.</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't been seeing anything of him, have you?&quot; he asked
roughly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, after a moment, as if caught guilty.  &quot;He got
into the tram with me, and he asked me to drink a coffee and a
Benedictine in the Royal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've got it off fine and glib,&quot; he said sullenly.  &quot;And did
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, with the air of a traitor before the rack.</p>

<p>The blood came up into his neck and face, he stood motionless,
dangerous.</p>

<p>&quot;It was cold, and it was such fun to go into the Royal,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd go off with a nigger for a packet of chocolate,&quot; he said, in
anger and contempt, and some bitterness.  Queer how he drew away
from her, cut her off from him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ted - how beastly!&quot; she cried.  &quot;You know quite well - &quot;  She caught
her lip, flushed, and the tears came to her eyes.</p>

<p>He turned away, to put on his necktie.  She went about her work,
making a queer pathetic little mouth, down which occasionally
dripped a tear.</p>

<p>He was ready to go.  With his hat jammed down on his head, and his
overcoat buttoned up to his chin, he came to kiss her.  He would be
miserable all the day if he went without.  She allowed herself to
be kissed.  Her cheek was wet under his lips, and his heart burned.
She hurt him so deeply.  And she felt aggrieved, and did not quite
forgive him.</p>

<p>In a moment she went upstairs to her ear-rings.  Sweet they looked
nestling in the little drawer - sweet!  She examined them with
voluptuous pleasure, she threaded them in her ears, she looked at
herself, she posed and postured and smiled, and looked sad and
tragic and winning and appealing, all in turn before the mirror.
And she was happy, and very pretty.</p>

<p>She wore her ear-rings all morning, in the house.  She was self-
conscious, and quite brilliantly winsome, when the baker came,
wondering if he would notice.  All the tradesmen left her door with
a glow in them, feeling elated, and unconsciously favouring the
delightful little creature, though there had been nothing to notice
in her behaviour.</p>

<p>She was stimulated all the day.  She did not think about her
husband.  He was the permanent basis from which she took these
giddy little flights into nowhere.  At night, like chickens and
curses, she would come home to him, to roost.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Whiston, a traveller and confidential support of a small
firm, hastened about his work, his heart all the while anxious for
her, yearning for surety, and kept tense by not getting it.</p>
