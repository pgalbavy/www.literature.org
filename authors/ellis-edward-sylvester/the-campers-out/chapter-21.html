<p>"Take your stations," added Bob Budd, excitedly; "we’re going
to have the tallest kind of fun; I’ll stay here, and you—"</p>

<p>But his friends did not wait for further directions. Tom Wagstaff
sprang up, gun in hand, and went threshing among the trees and
through the undergrowth toward the path on the left (as they faced
the mountain ridge), while Jim McGovern was equally prompt in
hurrying to the trail on the right.</p>

<p>Within a few seconds after the first baying of the hound fell
upon their ears Bob Budd found himself alone.</p>

<p>"They’re such lunkheads," he said to himself, "that the two together
don’t know enough to hit the side of a barn ten feet off. I hope
the deer will take the middle path so that I can show them how
the thing is done, which reminds me that it is time to take another
drink."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dog Hero was getting in his work in brilliant style.</p>

<p>The first sounds of the hound showed that he was over the mountain
crest, and within the following minute it was apparent to all
that he was approaching, his baying rapidly growing more distinct.</p>

<p>This confirmed what his owner had said: he had held his peace
until beyond the wild animal, so that the latter, when he awoke
to the alarming fact that the hound was after him, naturally turned
in the opposite direction, and was, therefore, coming toward the
three hunters, though, of course, it must remain undecided for
a time which trail he would take.</p>

<p>The baying of Hero continued at brief intervals, and drew near
so fast that each of the three hunters knew the game was sure
to pass near him, and one of them was to be favored with a shot
before he was a quarter of an hour older.</p>

<p>Which would it be?</p>

<p>"I think I’m to be the lucky chap," reflected the delighted Tom,
over on the left, "and I’ll show Bob, who thinks he knows so much,
that some things can be done as well as others. What the mischief
is the matter with me?"</p>

<p>This impatient inquiry was caused by Tom’s discovery that a singular
nervousness had taken possession of him and was rapidly increasing.
The belief that a wild animal was bearing down upon him and would
soon break cover affected him as he had never been affected before.</p>

<p>He found himself trembling in every limb, while his teeth rattled
as though he were shaking with the ague. Angered at his weakness,
he strove desperately to overcome it, but, as is the rule at such
times, though he was able to check himself for an instant, he
was powerless to master his strange weakness.</p>

<p>I suppose I hardly need tell you that Tom was suffering from
that peculiar nervousness known as "buck fever."</p>

<p>Experienced hunters laugh at amateurs when they see them overtaken
by the exasperating disease (if it be proper to call it that),
which never attacks them.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" muttered Tom, "I wonder whether Bob or Jim is
affected this way; if I don’t get better, I hope the deer won’t
come in sight of me."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it quickly became apparent that the animal had
taken the path on the left, and was approaching the impatient
hunter, who had stationed himself behind the trunk of a large
oak, with his gun at full cock, ready to let fly with both barrels
the instant he saw the chance.</p>

<p>Each of the trails to which I have alluded were traversed so
rarely that they showed only dimly, and were overhung by the luxuriant
undergrowth and branches growing beside them. This prevented Tom
seeing very far along the path, so that his ear gave him knowledge
of the whereabouts of the animal before the eye located him.</p>

<p>The youth was still striving desperately to get the mastery of
the buck fever, when he heard the crashing tread of the game,
which was advancing along the trail, and unless he wheeled aside
would pass within twenty feet of where he stood.</p>

<p>Suddenly a commotion was discernible among the vegetation, and
the next instant Tom caught sight of the antlers of a noble buck,
who was sailing along with such speed that the next second his
shoulders and body burst into sight.</p>

<p>He was running fast with that peculiar lope natural to the animal,
and no doubt was panic-stricken by the baying of the hound, not
far behind and gaining fast.</p>

<p>The sight of the royal game intensified Tom’s nervousness. He
compressed his lips and held his breath, with the resolve to calm
his agitation or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>But finding it utterly beyond his power, he deliberately stepped
from behind the tree, and when the buck was no more than fifty
feet away, and coming head on, he let fly with both barrels.</p>

<p>Had the animal been perched in the topmost branches of the beech-tree
on the left he would have received a mortal hurt, but as it was,
he was not touched by a single pellet of the numberless shot that
were sent hurtling and rattling among the leaves.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" muttered Tom, aware of his absurd failure; "I’ll
club you to death."</p>

<p>And swinging the butt of his weapon over his shoulder he rushed
savagely at the beast.</p>

<p>In doing so, he ran into a peril of which he did not dream, for
nothing is truer than that "a deer at bay is a dangerous foe,"
and he would have been practically helpless against an assault
of the animal.</p>

<p>Had the latter been wounded there is little doubt that he would
have lowered those beautiful antlers and charged directly at the
ardent hunter, who would have been caught in a most unpleasant
dilemma; but the fact that he was unharmed, added to the terrible
baying coming closer every minute, drove all idea of fight from
the buck, which wheeled sharply to one side and went crashing
through the undergrowth toward the path where Bob Budd was waiting
for him.</p>

<p>Tom Wagstaff was carried away by the excitement of the moment,
and with his gun clubbed started in frantic pursuit of the fleeing
game, resolved to help bring it down, even if he could not shoot
it.</p>

<p>He doubtless would have chased the animal a considerable distance
had the route been favorable, but beside the rocks and boulders
there was no end to the wiry, running vines, one of which wrapped
itself about his ankle in a fashion peculiar to its species, and
Tom sprawled headlong on his face, his gun flying a half-dozen
feet from his hands.</p>

<p>Still determined to keep up the pursuit, he hastily scrambled
to his feet, and catching up the weapon, tore ahead with the same
frantic haste as before.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, however, when he fell he was partly turned
around, and his ideas were so confused that he started back over
his own trail without a suspicion of the fact, not awaking to
his blunder until too late to correct it.</p>

<p>In the meantime the buck was making matters lively not only for
himself, but for the other parties.</p>

<p>The report of Tom’s gun readied the ears of Bob and Jim as a
matter of course, since they were quite near, but Bob knew that
the shot had failed to bring down the game, since he was heard
plunging through the wood toward the path beside which Bob Budd
was excitedly awaiting his approach.</p>

<p>It would have been strange if Bob had not felt something of the
nervousness that had played the mischief with Tom, but it was
to a much less extent, so that he did not doubt his ability to
fire as coolly and effectively as when practicing at a target.</p>

<p>It is a thrilling experience even for the veteran hunter when
a noble buck breaks cover within easy gunshot, and the sight of
the animal, as his leathery sides, proud head, and spreading antlers
burst upon his vision, stirred the pulses of Bob Budd as they
had not been stirred since his encounter with the Widow Finnegan,
a couple of nights before.</p>

<p>"You’re my game!" he exclaimed, aiming at the animal and discharging
the two barrels in quick succession.</p>

<p>He did better than Tom Wagstaff, though he failed to drop the
buck in his tracks, as he expected to do.</p>

<p>In fact, it seems to be one of the impossibilities to kill any
of the <em>cervus</em> species instantly—that is, so as to cause
him to fall at once, like many other animals when mortally hurt.</p>

<p>I once sent a bullet straight through the heart of a deer that
was running broadside past me. He kept straight on with unabated
speed for a dozen yards, when he crashed directly against the
trunk of a tree and fell all in a heap. But for the tree in his
way he would have run considerably further.</p>

<p>Bob lost his head very much as Tom had done a minute before,
for observing that the buck did not fall, he clubbed his gun and
rushed forward with the intention of braining him.</p>

<p>But from this point forward there was no parallelism in the flow
of incidents.</p>

<p>The buck had been slightly wounded, just enough to rouse his
anger. It is not impossible, also, that the sight of a second
hunter and the sound of the baying hound near at hand convinced
him that he was caught in close quarters and must make a fight
for it.</p>

<p>So when Bob rushed to meet him, instead of fleeing, the buck
lowered his antlers and rushed to meet Bob.</p>

<p>"Jewhilakens!" exclaimed the terrified youth, "I didn’t think
of <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>And wheeling about, he fled for his life.</p>

<p>Where to go or precisely what to do except to run was more than
the fugitive could tell.</p>

<p>Accordingly he sped with all the haste at his command, running,
it may be said, as never before. His terror was irrestrainable
when he cast a single glance over his shoulder and saw that the
buck was in savage pursuit.</p>

<p>"Fire! murder! Tom and Jim! where are you? Come to my help, quick,
or I’m a goner!" shouted Bob, dodging to the right and left like
a Digger Indian, seeking to avoid the rifle shots of a pursuing
enemy; "why don’t you help me? The buck has got me and is going
to chaw me all to pieces!"</p>
