<p>When Fred Sheldon had spent some minutes examining the knife
he had picked up from the floor, he opened and closed the blades
several times, and finally dropped it into his pocket, running
his hand to the bottom to make sure there was no hole through
which the precious implement might be lost.</p>

<p>"I think that knife is worth about a thousand dollars," he said,
with a great sigh; "and if Aunt Lizzie and Annie don't get their
silverware and money back, why they can hold on to the jack-knife."</p>

<p>At this juncture it struck the lad as a very strange thing that
the two ladies should sleep in one part of the house and leave
their valuables in another. It would have been more consistent
if they had kept the chest in their own sleeping apartment, but
they were very peculiar in some respects, and there was no accounting
for many things they did.</p>

<p>"Maybe they went in there!" suddenly exclaimed Fred, referring
to the tramp and his friend. "They must have thought it likely
there was something in their bed-room worth hunting for. I'll
see."</p>

<p>He felt faint at heart at the thought that the good ladies had
been molested while they lay unconscious in bed, but he pushed
his way through the house, candle in hand, with the real bravery
which was a part of his nature.</p>

<p>His heart was throbbing rapidly when he reached the door of their
apartment and softly raised the latch.</p>

<p>But it was fastened from within, and when he listened he distinctly
heard the low, gentle breathing of the good souls who had slumbered
so quietly all through these exciting scenes.</p>

<p>"I am so thankful they haven't been disturbed," said Fred, making
his way back to his own room, where he blew out his light, said
his prayers and jumped into bed.</p>

<p>Despite the stirring experiences through which he had passed,
and the chagrin he felt over his stupidity, Fred soon dropped
into a sound slumber, which lasted until the sun shone through
the window.</p>

<p>Even then it was broken by the gentle voice of Aunt Lizzie, as
she was sometimes called, sounding from the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Fred was dressed and down in a twinkling, and in the rushing,
headlong, helter-skelter fashion of youngsters of his age, he
told the story of the robbery that had been committed during the
night.</p>

<p>The old ladies listened quietly, but the news was exciting, indeed,
and when Aunt Lizzie, the mildest soul that ever lived, said:</p>

<p>"I hope you are mistaken, Fred; after breakfast we'll go up-stairs
and see for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I shall see now," said her sister Annie, starting up the steps,
followed by Fred and the other.</p>

<p>There they quickly learned the whole truth. Eight hundred and
odd dollars were in the pocketbook, and the intrinsic worth of
the silver tea service amounted to fully three times as much,
while ten times that sum would not have persuaded the ladies to
part with it.</p>

<p>They were thrown into dismay by the loss, which grew upon them
as they reflected over it.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call us?" asked the white-faced Aunt Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Why, what would you have done if I had called you?" asked Fred,
in turn.</p>

<p>"We would have talked with them and shown them what a wicked
thing they were doing, and reminded them how unlawful and wrong
it is to pick a lock and steal things."</p>

<p>"Gracious alive! if I had undertaken to call you that first man
would have shot me, and it was lucky he didn't see me when I swung
out the back window; but they left something behind them which
I'd rather have than all your silver," said Fred.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>He drew out the pocket-knife and showed it, looking so wistfully
that they did not even take it from his hand, but told the gleeful
lad to keep it for himself.</p>

<p>"You may be sure I will," was his comment as he stowed it away
once more; "a boy don't get a chance at a knife like that more
than once in a lifetime."</p>

<p>The old ladies, mild and sweet-tempered as they were, became
so faint and weak as they fully realized their loss, that they
could eat no breakfast at all, and only swallowed a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Fred was affected in the same manner, but not to so great an
extent. However, he was anxious to do all he could for the good
ladies, and spending only a few minutes at the table he donned
his hat and said he would go for Constable Archie Jackson.</p>

<p>The hired man, Michael Heyland, had arrived, and was at work
out-doors, so there was no call for the boy to remain longer.</p>

<p>As Fred hastened down the lane, he was surprised to hear sounds
of martial music, but when he caught sight of a gorgeous band
and a number of square, box-like wagons with yellow animals painted
on the outside, he recalled that this was the day of the circus,
and his heart gave a great bound of delight.</p>

<p>"I wish Miss Annie and Lizzie hadn't lost their money and silver,"
he said, "for maybe I could have persuaded them to go to the circus
with me, and I'm sure they would have enjoyed themselves."</p>

<p>Running forward, Fred perched himself on the fence until the
last wagon rattled by, when he slipped to the ground and trotted
behind it, feeling that delight which comes to all lads in looking
upon the place where wild animals are known to be housed.</p>

<p>At every dwelling they passed the inmates hastened out, and the
musicians increased the volume of their music until the air seemed
to throb and pulsate with the stirring strains.</p>

<p>When the town of Tottenville was reached, the whole place was
topsy-turvy. The men and wagons, with the tents and poles, had
been on the ground several hours, hard at work, and crowds had
been watching them from the moment of their arrival.</p>

<p>As the rest of the vehicles gathered in a circle, which was to
be enclosed by the canvas, the interest was of such an intense
character that literally nothing else was seen or thought of by
the countrymen and villagers.</p>

<p>There was no one who gaped with more open-mouthed wonder than
Fred Sheldon, who forgot for the time the real business which
had brought him to Tottenville. As usual, he had his trousers
rolled high above his knees, and with his hands deep in his pockets,
walked about with his straw hat flapping in the slight breeze,
staring at everything relating to the menagerie and circus, and
tasting beforehand the delights that awaited him in the afternoon,
when he would be permitted to gaze until tired, if such a thing
were possible.</p>

<p>"That's the cage that has the great African lion," said Fred
to Jimmy Emery and Joe Hunt, who stood beside him; "just look
at that picture where he's got a man in his jaws, running off
with him, and not caring a cent for the hunters firing at him."</p>

<p>"Them's Tottenhots," said Joe Hunt, who was glad of a chance
of airing his knowledge of natural history; "they live in the
upper part of Africa, on the Hang Ho river, close to London."</p>

<p>"My gracious," said Fred, with a laugh; "you've got Europe, Asia
and Africa all mixed up, and the people are the Hottentots; there
isn't anybody in the world with such a name as Tottenhots."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, too; ain't we folks that live in Tottenville
Tottenhots, smarty?"</p>

<p>"Let's ask that big boy there about them; he belongs to the show."</p>

<p>The young man to whom they alluded stood a short distance off,
with a long whip in his hand, watching the operations of those
who were erecting the canvas. He was quite red in the face, had
a bushy head of hair almost of the same hue, and was anything
but attractive in appearance.</p>

<p>His trousers were tucked in his boot-tops; he wore a blue shirt,
sombrero-like hat, and was smoking a strong briar-wood pipe, occasionally
indulging in some remark in which there was a shocking amount
of profanity.</p>

<p>The boys started toward him, and had nearly reached him when
Jimmy Emery said in an excited undertone:</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see who he is? He's Bud Heyland."</p>

<p>"So he is. His father told me last spring he had gone off to
join a circus, but I forgot all about it."</p>

<p>Bud Heyland was the son of Michael Heyland, the man who did the
work for the sisters Perkinpine, and before he left was known
as the bully of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>He was a year or two older than the oldest in school, and he
played the tyrant among the other youngsters, whose life sometimes
became a burden to them when he was near.</p>

<p>He generally punished two or three of the lads each day after
school for some imaginary offense. If they told the teacher, he
would scold and threaten Bud, who would tell some outlandish falsehood,
and then whip the boys again for telling tales.</p>

<p>If they appealed to Mr. McCurtis, the same programme was gone
through as before; and as the original victims continued to be
worsted, they finally gave it up as a losing business and bore
their sorrows uncomplainingly.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon tried several times to get up a confederation against
the bully, with a view of bringing him to justice, but the others
were too timid, and nothing came from it.</p>

<p>Bud was especially ugly in his actions toward Fred, who had no
father to take the matter in hand, while Mr. Heyland himself simply
smoked his pipe and grunted out that he couldn't do anything with
Bud and had given him up long ago.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. McCurtis lost all patience, and summoning his energies
he flogged the young scamp most thoroughly and then bundled him
out of the door, forbidding him to come to school any more.</p>

<p>This suited Bud, who hurled several stones through the window,
and then went home, stayed several days and finally went off with
a circus, with one of whose drivers he had formed an acquaintance.</p>

<p>The boys were a little backward when they recognized Bud, but
concluded he would be glad to see them, especially as they all
intended to visit the menagerie during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bud!" called out Fred, with a grin, as he and his two
friends approached; "how are you?"</p>

<p>The boy, who was sixteen years old, turned about and looked at
them for a minute, and then asked:</p>

<p>"Is that you, younkers? What'er you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, looking around a little. We're all coming this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You are, eh? Do you expect to crawl under the tent?"</p>

<p>"No, we're going to pay our way in; Jim and Joe didn't know whether
they could come or not, but it's all fixed now."</p>

<p>"I watch outside with this cart-whip for boys that try to crawl
under, and it's fun when I bring the lash down on 'em. Do you
see?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, Bud gave a flourish with the whip, whirling the
lash about his head and causing it to snap like a firecracker.</p>
