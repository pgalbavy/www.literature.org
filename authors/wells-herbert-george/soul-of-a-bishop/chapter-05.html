<P>
Dr. DALE exceeded the bishop's worst apprehensions. He was a
lean, lank, dark young man with long black hair and irregular,
rather prolonged features; his chin was right over to the left;
he looked constantly at the bishop's face with a distinctly
sceptical grey eye; he could not have looked harder if he had
been a photographer or a portrait painter. And his voice was
harsh, and the bishop was particularly sensitive to voices.
<P>
He began by understanding far too much of the bishop's illness,
and he insisted on various familiarities with the bishop's heart
and tongue and eye and knee that ruffled the bishop's soul.
<P>
"Brighton-Pomfrey talked of neurasthenia?" he asked. "That was
his diagnosis," said the bishop. "Neurasthenia," said the young
man as though he despised the word.
<P>
The bishop went on buttoning up his coat.
<P>
"You don't of course want to break your vows about drinking and
smoking," said the young man with the very faintest suggestion of
derision in his voice.
<P>
"Not if it can possibly be avoided," the bishop asserted.
"Without a loss, that is, of practical efficiency," he added.
"For I have much to do."
<P>
"I think that it is possible to keep your vow," said the young
man, and the bishop could have sworn at him. "I think we can
manage that all right."
<P>
(2)
<P>
<P>
The bishop sat at the table resting his arm upon it and
awaiting the next development of this unsatisfactory interview.
He was on the verge of asking as unpleasantly as possible when
Brighton-Pomfrey would return.
<P>
The young man stood upon Brighton-Pomfrey's hearth-rug and was
evidently contemplating dissertations.
<P>
"Of course," he said, as though he discussed a problem with
himself, "you must have some sort of comfort. You must get out of
this state, one way or another."
<P>
The bishop nodded assent. He had faint hopes of this young
man's ideas of comfort.
<P>
Dr. Dale reflected. Then he went off away from the question of
comfort altogether. "You see, the trouble in such a case as this
is peculiarly difficult to trace to its sources because it comes
just upon the border-line of bodily and mental things. You may
take a drug or alter your regimen and it disturbs your thoughts,
you may take an idea and it disturbs your health. It is easy
enough to say, as some do, that all ideas have a physical
substratum; it is almost as easy to say with the Christian
Scientist that all bodily states are amenable to our ideas. The
truth doesn't, I think, follow the border between those opposite
opinions very exactly on either side. I can't, for instance, tell
you to go home and pray against these uncertainties and despairs,
because it is just these uncertainties and despairs that rob you
of the power of efficient prayer."
<P>
He did not seem to expect anything from the bishop.
<P>
"I don't see that because a case brings one suddenly right up
against the frontier of metaphysics, why a doctor should
necessarily pull up short at that, why one shouldn't go on into
either metaphysics or psychology if such an extension is
necessary for the understanding of the case. At any rate if
you'll permit it in this consultation...."
<P>
"Go on," said the bishop, holding on to that promise of
comfort. "The best thing is to thrash out the case in your own
way. And then come to what is practical."
<P>
"What is really the matter here--the matter with you that is
--is a disorganization of your tests of reality. It's one of a
group of states hitherto confused. Neurasthenia, that
comprehensive phrase--well, it is one of the neurasthenias.
Here, I confess, I begin to talk of work I am doing, work still
to be published, finished first and then published.... But I go
off from the idea that every living being lives in a state not
differing essentially from a state of hallucination concerning
the things about it. Truth, essential truth, is hidden. Always.
Of course there must be a measure of truth in our working
illusions, a working measure of truth, or the creature would
smash itself up and end itself, but beyond that discretion of the
fire and the pitfall lies a wide margin of error about which we
may be deceived for years. So long as it doesn't matter, it
doesn't matter. I don't know if I make myself clear."
<P>
"I follow you," said the bishop a little wearily, "I follow
you. Phenomena and noumena and so on and so on.  Kant and so
forth. Pragmatism. Yes."
<P>
With a sigh.
<P>
"And all that," completed Dr. Dale in a voice that suggested
mockery. "But you see we grow into a way of life, we settle down
among habits and conventions, we say 'This is all right' and
'That is always so.' We get more and more settled into our life
as a whole and more and more confident. Unless something happens
to shake us out of our sphere of illusion. That may be some
violent contradictory fact, some accident, or it may be some
subtle change in one's health and nerves that makes us feel
doubtful. Or a change of habits. Or, as I believe, some subtle
quickening of the critical faculty. Then suddenly comes the
feeling as though we were lost in a strange world, as though we
had never really seen the world before."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
The bishop was reluctantly interested. "That does describe
something--of the mental side," he admitted. "I never believe
in concealing my own thoughts from an intelligent patient," said
Dr. Dale, with a quiet offensiveness. "That sort of thing belongs
to the dark ages of the 'pothecary's art. I will tell you exactly
my guesses and suppositions about you. At the base of it all is a
slight and subtle kidney trouble, due I suggest to your going to
Princhester and drinking the local water--"
<P>
"But it's excellent water. They boast of it."
<P>
"By all the established tests. As a matter of fact many of our
best drinking waters have all sorts of unspecified qualities.
Burton water, for example, is radioactive by Beetham's standards
up to the ninth degree. But that is by the way. My theory about
your case is that this produced a change in your blood, that
quickened your sensibilities and your critical faculties just at
a time when a good many bothers--I don't of course know what
they were, but I can, so to speak, see the marks all over you--
came into your life."
<P>
The bishop nodded.
<P>
"You were uprooted. You moved from house to house, and failed
to get that curled up safe feeling one has in a real home in any
of them."
<P>
"If you saw the fireplaces and the general decoration of the
new palace!" admitted the bishop. "I had practically no control."
<P>
"That confirms me," said Dr. Dale. "Insomnia followed, and
increased the feeling of physical strangeness by increasing the
bodily disturbance. I suspect an intellectual disturbance."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"There was," said the bishop.
<P>
"You were no longer at home anywhere. You were no longer at
home in your diocese, in your palace, in your body, in your
convictions. And then came the war. Quite apart from everything
else the mind of the whole world is suffering profoundly from the
shock of this war--much more than is generally admitted. One
thing you did that you probably did not observe yourself doing,
you drank rather more at your meals, you smoked a lot more. That
was your natural and proper response to the shock."
<P>
"Ah!" said the bishop, and brightened up.
<P>
"It was remarked by Tolstoy, I think, that few intellectual men
would really tolerate the world as it is if it were not for
smoking and drinking. Even novelists have their moments of
lucidity. Certainly these things soothe the restlessness in men's
minds, deaden their sceptical sensibilities. And just at the time
when you were getting most dislodged--you gave them up."
<P>
"And the sooner I go back to them the better," said the bishop
brightly. "I quite see that."
<P>
"I wouldn't say that," said Dr. Dale....
<P>
(3)
<P>
<P>
"That," said Dr. Dale, "is just where my treatment of this case
differs from the treatment of "--he spoke the name reluctantly
as if he disliked the mere sound of it--"Dr. Brighton-Pomfrey."
<P>
"Hitherto, of course," said the bishop, "I've been in his
hands."
<P>
"He," said Dr. Dale, "would certainly set about trying to
restore your old sphere of illusion, your old familiar sensations
and ideas and confidences. He would in fact turn you back. He
would restore all your habits. He would order you a rest. He
would send you off to some holiday resort, fresh in fact but
familiar in character, the High lands, North Italy, or
Switzerland for example. He would forbid you newspapers and order
you to botanize and prescribe tranquillizing reading; Trollope's
novels, the Life of Gladstone, the works of Mr. A. C. Benson,
memoirs and so on. You'd go somewhere where there was a good
Anglican chaplain, and you'd take some of the services yourself.
And we'd wash out the effects of the Princhester water with
Contrexeville, and afterwards put you on Salutaris or Perrier. I
don't know whether I shouldn't have inclined to some such
treatment before the war began. Only--"
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"You think--?"
<P>
Dr. Dale's face betrayed a sudden sombre passion. "It won't do
now," he said in a voice of quiet intensity. "It won't do now."
<P>
He remained darkly silent for so long that at last the bishop
spoke. "Then what," he asked, "do you suggest?
<P>
"Suppose we don't try to go back," said Dr. Dale. "Suppose we
go on and go through."
<P>
"Where?"
<P>
"To reality.
<P>
"I know it's doubtful, I know it's dangerous," he went on, "but
I am convinced that now we can no longer keep men's minds and
souls in these feathered nests, these spheres of illusion. Behind
these veils there is either God or the Darkness.... Why should we
not go on?"
<P>
The bishop was profoundly perplexed. He heard himself speaking.
"It would be unworthy of my cloth," he was saying.
<P>
Dr. Dale completed the sentence: "to go back."
<P>
"Let me explain a little more," he said, "what I mean by 'going
on.' I think that this loosening of the ties of association that
bind a man to his everyday life and his everyday self is in nine
cases out of ten a loosening of the ties that bind him to
everyday sanity. One common form of this detachment is the form
you have in those cases of people who are found wandering unaware
of their names, unaware of their places of residence, lost
altogether from themselves. They have not only lost their sense
of identity with themselves, but all the circumstances of their
lives have faded out of their minds like an idle story in a book
that has been read and put aside. I have looked into hundreds of
such cases. I don't think that loss of identity is a necessary
thing; it's just another side of the general weakening of the
grip upon reality, a kind of anaemia of the brain so that
interest fades and fails. There is no reason why you should
forget a story because you do not believe it--if your brain is
strong enough to hold it. But if your brain is tired and weak,
then so soon as you lose faith in your records, your mind is glad
to let them go. When you see these lost identity people that is
always your first impression, a tired brain that has let go."
<P>
The bishop felt extremely like letting go.
<P>
"But how does this apply to my case?"
<P>
"I come to that," said Dr. Dale, holding up a long large hand.
"What if we treat this case of yours in a new way? What if we
give you not narcotics but stimulants and tonics? What if we so
touch the blood that we increase your sense of physical
detachment while at the same time feeding up your senses to a new
and more vivid apprehension of things about you?" He looked at
his patient's hesitation and added: "You'd lose all that craving
feeling, that you fancy at present is just the need of a smoke.
The world might grow a trifle--transparent, but you'd keep
real. Instead of drugging oneself back to the old contentment--"
<P>
"You'd drug me on to the new," said the bishop.
<P>
"But just one word more!" said Dr. Dale. "Hear why I would do
this! It was easy and successful to rest and drug people back to
their old states of mind when the world wasn't changing, wasn't
spinning round in the wildest tornado of change that it has ever
been in. But now--Where can I send you for a rest? Where can I
send you to get you out of sight and hearing of the Catastrophe?
Of course old Brighton-Pomfrey would go on sending people away
for rest and a nice little soothing change if the Day of Judgment
was coming in the sky and the earth was opening and the sea was
giving up its dead. He'd send 'em to the seaside. Such things as
that wouldn't shake his faith in the Channel crossing. My idea is
that it's not only right for you to go through with this, but
that it's the only thing to do. If you go right on and right
through with these doubts and intimations--"
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"You may die like a madman," he said, "but you won't die like a
tame rabbit."
<P>
(4)
<P>
<P>
The bishop sat reflecting. What fascinated and attracted him
was the ending of all the cravings and uneasinesses and
restlessness that had distressed his life for over four years;
what deterred him was the personality of this gaunt young man
with his long grey face, his excited manner, his shock of black
hair. He wanted that tonic--with grave misgivings. "If you
think this tonic is the wiser course," he began. "I'd give it you
if you were my father," said Dr. Dale. "I've got everything for
it," he added.
<P>
"You mean you can make it up--without a prescription."
<P>
"I can't give you a prescription. The essence of it--It's a
distillate I have been trying. It isn't in the Pharmacopeia."
<P>
Again the bishop had a twinge of misgiving.
<P>
But in the end he succumbed. He didn't want to take the stuff,
but also he did not want to go without his promised comfort.
<P>
Presently Dale had given him a little phial--and was holding
up to the window a small medicine glass into which he was pouring
very carefully twenty drops of the precious fluid. "Take it
only," he said, "when you feel you must."
<P>
"It is the most golden of liquids," said the bishop, peering at
it.
<P>
"When you want more I will make you more. Later of course, it
will be possible to write a prescription. Now add the water--
so.
<P>
"It becomes opalescent. How beautifully the light plays in it!
<P>
"Take it."
<P>
The bishop dismissed his last discretion and drank.
<P>
"Well?" said Dr. Dale.
<P>
"I am still here," said the bishop, smiling, and feeling a
joyous tingling throughout his body. "It stirs me."
<P>
(5)
<P>
<P>
The bishop stood on the pavement outside Dr. Brighton-Pomfrey's
house. The massive door had closed behind him.
<P>
It had been an act of courage, of rashness if you will, to take
this draught. He was acutely introspective, ready for anything,
for the most disagreeable or the most bizarre sensations. He was
asking himself, Were his feet steady? Was his head swimming?
<P>
His doubts glowed into assurance.
<P>
Suddenly he perceived that he was sure of God.
<P>
Not perhaps of the God of Nicaea, but what did these poor
little quibblings and definitions of the theologians matter? He
had been worrying about these definitions and quibblings for four
long restless years. Now they were just failures to express--
what surely every one knew--and no one would ever express
exactly. Because here was God, and the kingdom of God was
manifestly at hand. The visible world hung before him as a mist
might hang before the rising sun. He stood proudly and
masterfully facing a universe that had heretofore bullied him
into doubt and apologetics, a universe that had hitherto been
opaque and was now betrayed translucent.
<P>
That was the first effect of the new tonic, complete
reassurance, complete courage. He turned to walk towards Mount
Street and Berkeley Square as a sultan might turn to walk among
his slaves.
<P>
But the tonic was only beginning.
<P>
Before he had gone a dozen steps he was aware that he seemed
more solid and larger than the people about him. They had all a
curious miniature effect, as though he was looking at them
through the wrong end of an opera glass. The houses on either
side of the street and the traffic shared this quality in an
equal measure. It was as if he was looking at the world through
apertures in a miniature cinematograph peep-show. This surprised
him and a little dashed his first glow of satisfaction.
<P>
He passed a man in khaki who, he fancied, looked at him with an
odd expression. He observed the next passers-by narrowly and
suspiciously, a couple of smartish young men, a lady with a
poodle, a grocer's boy with a basket, but none seemed to observe
anything remarkable about him. Then he caught the eye of a taxi-
driver and became doubtful again.
<P>
He had a feeling that this tonic was still coming in like a
tide. It seemed to be filling him and distending him, in spite of
the fact that he was already full. After four years of flaccidity
it was pleasant to be distended again, but already he felt more
filled than he had ever been before. At present nothing was
showing, but all his body seemed braced and uplifted. He must be
careful not to become inflated in his bearing.
<P>
And yet it was difficult not to betray a little inflation. He
was so filled with assurance that things were right with him and
that God was there with him. After all it was not mere fancy; he
was looking through the peepholes of his eyes at the world of
illusion and appearance. The world that was so intent upon its
immediate business, so regardless of eternal things, that had so
dominated him but a little while ago, was after all a thing more
mortal than himself.
<P>
Another man in khaki passed him.
<P>
For the first time he saw the war as something measurable, as
something with a beginning and an end, as something less than the
immortal spirit in man. He had been too much oppressed by it. He
perceived all these people in the street were too much oppressed
by it. He wanted to tell them as much, tell them that all was
well with them, bid them be of good cheer. He wanted to bless
them. He found his arm floating up towards gestures of
benediction. Self-control became increasingly difficult.
<P>
All the way down Berkeley Square the bishop was in full-bodied
struggle with himself. He was trying to control himself, trying
to keep within bounds. He felt that he was stepping too high,
that his feet were not properly reaching the ground, that he was
walking upon cushions of air.
<P>
The feeling of largeness increased, and the feeling of
transparency in things about him. He avoided collision with
passers-by--excessively. And he felt his attention was being
drawn more and more to something that was going on beyond the
veil of visible things. He was in Piccadilly now, but at the same
time Piccadilly was very small and he was walking in the presence
of God.
<P>
He had a feeling that God was there though he could not see
him. And at the same time he was in this transitory world, with
people going to and fro, men with umbrellas tucked dangerously
under their arms, men in a hurry, policemen, young women rattling
Red Cross collecting boxes, smart people, loafers. They
distracted one from God.
<P>
He set out to cross the road just opposite Prince's, and
jumping needlessly to give way to an omnibus had the narrowest
escape from a taxicab.
<P>
He paused on the pavement edge to recover himself. The shock of
his near escape had, as people say, pulled him together.
<P>
What was he to do? Manifestly this opalescent draught was
overpowering him. He ought never to have taken it. He ought to
have listened to the voice of his misgivings. It was clear that
he was not in a fit state to walk about the streets. He was--
what had been Dr. Dale's term?--losing his sense of reality.
What was he to do? He was alarmed but not dismayed. His thoughts
were as full-bodied as the rest of his being, they came throbbing
and bumping into his mind. What was he to do?
<P>
Brighton-Pomfrey ought never to have left his practice in the
hands of this wild-eyed experimenter.
<P>
Strange that after a lifetime of discretion and men's respect
one should be standing on the Piccadilly pavement--intoxicated!
<P>
It came into his head that he was not so very far from the
Athenaeum, and surely there if anywhere a bishop may recover his
sense of being--ordinary.
<P>
And behind everything, behind the tall buildings and the
swarming people there was still the sense of a wide illuminated
space, of a light of wonder and a Presence. But he must not give
way to that again! He had already given way altogether too much.
He repeated to himself in a whisper, "I am in Piccadilly."
<P>
If he kept tight hold upon himself he felt he might get to the
Athenaeum before--before anything more happened.
<P>
He murmured directions to himself. "Keep along the pavement.
Turn to the right at the Circus. Now down the hill. Easily down
the hill. Don't float! Junior Army and Navy Stores. And the
bookseller."
<P>
And presently he had a doubt of his name and began to repeat
it.
<P>
"Edward Princhester. Edward Scrope, Lord Bishop of
Princhester."
<P>
And all the while voices within him were asserting, "You are in
the kingdom of Heaven. You are in the presence of God. Place and
time are a texture of illusion and dreamland. Even now, you are
with God."
<P>
(6)
<P>
<P>
The porter of the Athenaeum saw him come in, looking well--
flushed indeed--but queer in expression; his blue eyes were
wide open and unusually vague and blue.
<P>
He wandered across towards the dining-room, hesitated, went to
look at the news, seemed in doubt whether he would not go into
the smoking-room, and then went very slowly upstairs, past the
golden angel up to the great drawing-room.
<P>
In the drawing-room he found only Sir James Mounce, the man who
knew the novels of Sir Walter Scott by heart and had the minutest
and most unsparing knowledge of every detail in the life of that
supreme giant of English literature. He had even, it was said,
acquired a Scotch burr in the enthusiasm of his hero-worship. It
was usually sufficient only to turn an ear towards him for him to
talk for an hour or so. He was now studying Bradshaw.
<P>
The bishop snatched at him desperately. He felt that if he went
away there would be no hold left upon the ordinary things of
life.
<P>
"Sir James," he said, "I was wondering the other day when was
the exact date of the earliest public ascription of Waverley to
Scott."
<P>
"Eh!" said Sir James, "but I'd like to talk that over with ye.
Indeed I would. It would be depending very largely on what ye
called 'public.' But--"
<P>
He explained something about an engagement in Birmingham that
night, a train to catch. Reluctantly but relentlessly he
abandoned the proffered ear. But he promised that the next time
they met in the club he would go into the matter "exhausteevely."
<P>
The door closed upon him. The bishop was alone. He was flooded
with the light of the world that is beyond this world. The things
about him became very small and indistinct.
<P>
He would take himself into a quiet corner in the library of
this doll's house, and sit his little body down in one of the
miniature armchairs. Then if he was going to faint or if the
trancelike feeling was to become altogether a trance--well, a
bishop asleep in an armchair in the library of the Athenaeum is
nothing to startle any one.
<P>
He thought of that convenient hidden room, the North Library,
in which is the bust of Croker. There often one can be quite
alone.... It was empty, and he went across to the window that
looks out upon Pall Mall and sat down in the little uncomfortable
easy chair by the desk with its back to the Benvenuto Cellini.
<P>
And as he sat down, something snapped--like the snapping of a
lute string--in his brain.
<P>
(7)
<P>
<P>
With a sigh of deep relief the bishop realized that this world
had vanished.
<P>
He was in a golden light.
<P>
He perceived it as a place, but it was a place without
buildings or trees or any very definite features. There was a
cloudy suggestion of distant hills, and beneath his feet were
little gem-like flowers, and a feeling of divinity and infinite
friendliness pervaded his being. His impressions grew more
definite. His feet seemed to be bare. He was no longer a bishop
nor clad as a bishop. That had gone with the rest of the world.
He was seated on a slab of starry rock.
<P>
This he knew quite clearly was the place of God.
<P>
He was unable to disentangle thoughts from words. He seemed to
be speaking in his mind.
<P>
"I have been very foolish and confused and perplexed. I have
been like a creature caught among thorns."
<P>
"You served the purpose of God among those thorns." It seemed
to him at first that the answer also was among his thoughts.
<P>
"I seemed so silly and so little. My wits were clay."
<P>
"Clay full of desires."
<P>
"Such desires!"
<P>
"Blind desires. That will presently come to the light."
<P>
"Shall we come to the light?"
<P>
"But here it is, and you see it!"
<P>
(8)
<P>
<P>
It became clearer in the mind of the bishop that a figure sat
beside him, a figure of great strength and beauty, with a smiling
face and kindly eyes. A strange thought and a strange courage
came to the bishop.
<P>
"Tell me," he whispered, "are you God?"
<P>
"I am the Angel of God."
<P>
The bishop thought over that for some moments.
<P>
"I want," he said, "to know about God.
<P>
"I want," he said, with a deepening passion of the soul, "to
know about God. Slowly through four long years I have been
awakening to the need of God. Body and soul I am sick for the
want of God and the knowledge of God. I did not know what was the
matter with me, why my life had become so disordered and confused
that my very appetites and habits are all astray. But I am
perishing for God as a waterless man upon a raft perishes for
drink, and there is nothing but madness if I touch the seas about
me. Not only in my thoughts but in my under thoughts and in my
nerves and bones and arteries I have need of God. You see I grew
up in the delusion that I knew God, I did not know that I was
unprovisioned and unprovided against the tests and strains and
hardships of life. I thought that I was secure and safe. I was
told that we men--who were apes not a quarter of a million
years ago, who still have hair upon our arms and ape's teeth in
our jaws--had come to the full and perfect knowledge of God. It
was all put into a creed. Not a word of it was to be altered, not
a sentence was to be doubted any more. They made me a teacher of
this creed. They seemed to explain it to me. And when I came to
look into it, when my need came and I turned to my creed, it was
old and shrivelled up, it was the patched-up speculations of
vanished Greeks and Egyptians, it was a mummy of ancient
disputes, old and dry, that fell to dust as I unwrapped it. And I
was dressed up in the dress of old dead times and put before an
altar of forgotten sacrifices, and I went through ceremonies as
old as the first seedtime; and suddenly I knew clearly that God
was not there, God was not in my Creed, not in my cathedral, not
in my ceremonies, nowhere in my life. And at the same time I
knew, I knew as I had never known before, that certainly there
was God."
<P>
He paused. "Tell me," said the friend at his side; "tell me."
<P>
"It was as if a child running beside its mother, looked up and
saw that he had never seen her face before, that she was not his
mother, and that the words he had seemed to understand were--
now that he listened--words in an unknown tongue.
<P>
"You see, I am but a common sort of man, dear God; I have
neither lived nor thought in any way greatly, I have gone from
one day to the next day without looking very much farther than
the end of the day, I have gone on as life has befallen; if no
great trouble had come into my life, so I should have lived to
the end of my days. But life which began for me easily and safely
has become constantly more difficult and strange. I could have
held my services and given my benedictions, I could have believed
I believed in what I thought I believed.... But now I am lost and
astray--crying out for God...."
<P>
(9)
<P>
<P>
"Let us talk a little about your troubles," said the Angel.
"Let us talk about God and this creed that worries you and this
church of yours."
<P>
"I feel as though I had been struggling to this talk through
all the years--since my doubts began."
<P>
"The story your Creed is trying to tell is much the same story
that all religions try to tell. In your heart there is God,
beyond the stars there is God. Is it the same God?"
<P>
"I don't know," said the bishop.
<P>
"Does any one know?"
<P>
"I thought I knew."
<P>
"Your creed is full of Levantine phrases and images, full of
the patched contradictions of the human intelligence utterly
puzzled. It is about those two Gods, the God beyond the stars and
the God in your heart. It says that they are the same God, but
different. It says that they have existed together for all time,
and that one is the Son of the other. It has added a third Person
--but we won't go into that."
<P>
The bishop was reminded suddenly of the dispute at Mrs.
Garstein Fellows'. "We won't go into that," he agreed. "No!"
<P>
"Other religions have told the story in a different way. The
Cathars and Gnostics did. They said that the God in your heart is
a rebel against the God beyond the stars, that the Christ in your
heart is like Prometheus--or Hiawatha--or any other of the
sacrificial gods, a rebel. He arises out of man. He rebels
against that high God of the stars and crystals and poisons and
monsters and of the dead emptiness of space.... The Manicheans
and the Persians made out our God to be fighting eternally
against that Being of silence and darkness beyond the stars. The
Buddhists made the Lord Buddha the leader of men out of the
futility and confusion of material existence to the great peace
beyond. But it is all one story really, the story of the two
essential Beings, always the same story and the same perplexity
cropping up under different names, the story of one being who
stirs us, calls to us, and leads us, and of another who is above
and outside and in and beneath all things, inaccessible and
incomprehensible. All these religions are trying to tell
something they do not clearly know--of a relationship between
these two, that eludes them, that eludes the human mind, as water
escapes from the hand. It is unity and opposition they have to
declare at the same time; it is agreement and propitiation, it is
infinity and effort."
<P>
"And the truth?" said the bishop in an eager whisper. "You can
tell me the truth."
<P>
The Angel's answer was a gross familiarity. He thrust his hand
through the bishop's hair and ruffled it affectionately, and
rested for a moment holding the bishop's cranium in his great
palm.
<P>
"But can this hold it?" he said....
<P>
"Not with this little box of brains," said the Angel. "You
could as soon make a meal of the stars and pack them into your
belly. You haven't the things to do it with inside this."
<P>
He gave the bishop's head a little shake and relinquished it.
<P>
He began to argue as an elder brother might.
<P>
"Isn't it enough for you to know something of the God that
comes down to the human scale, who has been born on your planet
and arisen out of Man, who is Man and God, your leader? He's more
than enough to fill your mind and use up every faculty of your
being. He is courage, he is adventure, he is the King, he fights
for you and with you against death...."
<P>
"And he is not infinite? He is not the Creator?" asked the
bishop.
<P>
"So far as you are concerned, no," said the Angel.
<P>
"So far as I am concerned?"
<P>
"What have you to do with creation?"
<P>
And at that question it seemed that a great hand swept
carelessly across the blackness of the farther sky, and smeared
it with stars and suns and shining nebulas as a brush might smear
dry paint across a canvas.
<P>
The bishop stared in front of him. Then slowly he bowed his
head, and covered his face with his hands.
<P>
"And I have been in orders," he murmured; "I have been teaching
people the only orthodox and perfect truth about these things for
seven and twenty years."
<P>
And suddenly he was back in his gaiters and his apron and his
shovel hat, a little black figure exceedingly small in a very
great space....
<P>
(10)
<P>
<P>
It was a very great space indeed because it was all space, and
the roof was the ebony of limitless space from which the stars
swung flaming, held by invisible ties, and the soil beneath his
feet was a dust of atoms and the little beginnings of life. And
long before the bishop bared his face again, he knew that he was
to see his God.
<P>
He looked up slowly, fearing to be dazzled.
<P>
But he was not dazzled. He knew that he saw only the likeness
and bodying forth of a being inconceivable, of One who is greater
than the earth and stars and yet no greater than a man. He saw a
being for ever young, for ever beginning, for ever triumphant.
The quality and texture of this being was a warm and living light
like the effulgence at sunrise; He was hope and courage like a
sunlit morning in spring. He was adventure for ever, and His
courage and adventure flowed into and submerged and possessed the
being of the man who beheld him. And this presence of God stood
over the bishop, and seemed to speak to him in a wordless speech.
<P>
He bade him surrender himself. He bade him come out upon the
Adventure of Life, the great Adventure of the earth that will
make the atoms our bond-slaves and subdue the stars, that will
build up the white fires of ecstasy to submerge pain for ever,
that will overcome death. In Him the spirit of creation had
become incarnate, had joined itself to men, summoning men to Him,
having need of them, having need of them, having need of their
service, even as great kings and generals and leaders need and
use men. For a moment, for an endless age, the bishop bowed
himself in the being and glory of God, felI the glow of the
divine courage and confidence in his marrow, felt himself one
with God.
<P>
For a timeless interval....
<P>
Never had the bishop had so intense a sense of reality. It
seemed that never before had he known anything real. He knew
certainly that God was his King and master, and that his unworthy
service could be acceptable to God. His mind embraced that idea
with an absolute conviction that was also absolute happiness.
<P>
(11)
<P>
<P>
The thoughts and sensations of the bishop seemed to have lifted
for a time clean away from the condition of time, and then
through a vast orbit to be returning to that limitation.
<P>
He was aware presently that things were changing, that the
light was losing its diviner rays, that in some indescribable
manner the glory and the assurance diminished.
<P>
The onset of the new phase was by imperceptible degrees. From a
glowing, serene, and static realization of God, everything
relapsed towards change and activity. He was in time again and
things were happening, it was as if the quicksands of time poured
by him, and it was as if God was passing away from him. He fell
swiftly down from the heaven of self-forgetfulness to a
grotesque, pathetic and earthly self-consciousness.
<P>
He became acutely aware of his episcopal livery. And that God
was passing away from him.
<P>
It was as if God was passing, and as if the bishop was unable
to rise up and follow him.
<P>
Then it was as if God had passed, and as if the bishop was in
headlong pursuit of him and in a great terror lest he should be
left behind. And he was surely being left behind.
<P>
He discovered that in some unaccountable way his gaiters were
loose; most of their buttons seemed to have flown off, and his
episcopal sash had slipped down about his feet. He was sorely
impeded. He kept snatching at these things as he ran, in clumsy
attempts to get them off.
<P>
At last he had to stop altogether and kneel down and fumble
with the last obstinate button.
<P>
"Oh God!" he cried, "God my captain! Wait for me! Be patient
with me!"
<P>
And as he did so God turned back and reached out his hand. It
was indeed as if he stood and smiled. He stood and smiled as a
kind man might do; he dazzled and blinded his worshipper, and yet
it was manifest that he had a hand a man might clasp.
<P>
Unspeakable love and joy irradiated the whole being of the
bishop as he seized God's hand and clasped it desperately with
both his own. It was as if his nerves and arteries and all his
substance were inundated with golden light....
<P>
It was again as if he merged with God and became God....
