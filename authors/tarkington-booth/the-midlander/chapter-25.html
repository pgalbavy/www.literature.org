<p><em>NEITHER </em>Mr. Oliphant’s daughter-in-law nor his grandson
was at home at the time of his death. Lena had gone abroad again,
for a "three-months’ furlough," as she called it; and again in
spite of Dan’s vehement protest that the boy "ought to see his
own country first," she had taken Henry with her.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t mind it so much," Dan said to her before they went;—"but
you never even stop off and show him Niagara Falls when you take
him to New York to visit your family; and when I want to take
him with <em>me</em>, you always say he’s got a cold or something
and has to stay at home. It seems to me pretty near a disgrace
for parents to carry their children all over Europe and pay no
attention to the greatest natural wonders in the world, right
here at home. My father and mother went to Europe with Harlan
and me, but not before they’d taken us to see Mammoth Cave and
Niagara Falls. Why, it’d take <em>five</em> Europes to give me
the thrill I got the first time I ever looked at the Falls! It’s
not fair to Henry, and besides, look what it does to his school
work! He picked up some French, yes, the other time you had him
over there; but he dropped a whole year in his classes. And how
much French is he goin’ to need when I take him into business
with me? Not a thimbleful in a lifetime! He’s the best boy I ever
knew and got the finest nature; and he ought to be given the opportunity
to learn something about his own country instead of too much Paris!"</p>

<p>This patriotic vehemence went for nothing, since Henry intended
to accompany his mother and announced his intentions with a firmness
that left his father nothing to do but grumble helplessly, while
Lena laughed. At fifteen, Henry had his precocities, and among
them a desire (not mentioned) to revisit the Bal Tabarin, as he
retained a pleasant memory of a quiet excursion to this entertainment,
during his previous travels, when he was twelve and already influential
with Parisian hotel guides. Lena had her way, and, having placed
the ocean between herself and further argument on the part of
her husband, remained twice as long as the "furlough" she had
proposed. She did not return until Dan’s term as mayor was concluded,
four months after Mr. Oliphant’s death.</p>

<p>When she finally did arrive, her appearance was mollifying;—she
had always looked far less than her age, and now, fresh from amazing
cosmetic artists, and brilliantly studied by superb milliners,
she was prettier than she had ever been. Strangers would have
believed a firm declaration that she was twenty-four; she knew
this, and her homecoming mood was lively—but when Dan within the
hour of her arrival wished to drive her out to Ornaby to see the
new house, which he had at last begun to build, after years of
planting and landscaping, she declined. Her look of gayety vanished
into the faraway expression that had always come upon her face
when the new house was mentioned.</p>

<p>"Not to-day," she said. "I’m not so sure we ought to go ahead
with it at all. I don’t think we ought to leave your mother; she’d
be too lonely in the old house now—living here all alone."</p>

<p>"But I never dreamed of such a thing," Dan protested. "She’ll
come with us, of course. This old place is going to be sold before
long; I’ve just about talked her into it, and she can get real
money for it now. Land along here is worth something mighty pretty
these days. Why, Fred Oliphant’s family got seven hundred a front
foot for their place three months ago, and an absolutely magnificent
office-building for doctors is goin’ to be put up there. They’ve
got the foundations all in and the first story’s almost up already.
That’s only two blocks below here; and I can get mother almost
any price she wants. I’d buy it myself and sell it again, only
I wouldn’t like to feel I’d taken advantage of her. Why don’t
you come on out now with Henry and me and take a look at our own
doin’s? It’ll surprise you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, some day," she said, the absent look not disappearing from
her eyes. "I’d rather lie down now, I believe. You run along with
Henry."</p>

<p>Henry showed no great enthusiasm about accompanying his father,
and when they arrived at the new house seemed indifferent to the
busy work going on there. Dan was loud and jocose with him, slapping
him on the back at intervals, and inquiring in a shout how it
felt to "be back in God’s country again." Upon each of these manifestations,
Henry smiled with a politeness somewhat constrained, replying
indistinctly; and, as they went over the building, now in a skeleton
stage of structure, Dan would stop frequently and address a workman
with hearty familiarity: "Look what I got with me, Shorty! Just
got him back all the way from Europe! How’d <em>you</em> like
to have a boy as near a man as this? Pretty fine! Yes, sir; pretty
fine, Shorty!" And he would throw his ponderous arm about his
son’s thin shoulders, and Henry would bear the embrace with a
bored patience, but move away as soon as he could find an excuse
to do so.</p>

<p>He was a dark, slender, rather sallow boy, short for the sixteen
years he verged upon, though his face, with its small and shapely
features, like his mother’s, looked older and profoundly reticent.
It was one of those oldish young faces that seem too experienced
not to understand the wisdom of withholding everything; and Henry
appeared to be most of all withholding when he was with his boisterous,
adoring father. Obviously this was not because the boy had any
awe of Dan. On the contrary, as one of the friendly and admiring
carpenters observed, "The Big Fellow, he’s so glad to have that
son of his back he just can’t keep his hands off him; wants to
jest hug him all the time, and it makes the kid tired. Well, I
can remember when I was like that—thought I knew it all, and my
old man didn’t know nothin’! I expect this kid does know a few
things the Big Fellow doesn’t know he knows, mebbe! Looks like
that kind of a kid to me."</p>

<p>The estimate was not ill-founded, as Henry presently demonstrated.
Escaping from his father’s fond and heavy arm, he seated himself
upon a slab of carved stone, produced a beautiful flat gold case,
the size and shape of a letter envelope, and drew from it a tiny
cigarette of a type made in France for women.</p>

<p>Dan stared at him, frowned, and inquired uncomfortably, but with
some severity: "Don’t you think you’re too young for that, Henry?"</p>

<p>"Young?" Henry seemed to be mildly surprised as he lighted the
cigarette. "No, I shouldn’t think so. I’ve smoked for quite some
time now, you know."</p>

<p>"No; I certainly didn’t know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Henry returned placidly. "It’s years since I first
began it."</p>

<p>"Well, but see here——" Dan began; then paused, reddening. "I
don’t believe it’ll be very good for your health," he concluded
feebly.</p>

<p>"My health’s all right," the youth said, with an air that began
to be slightly annoyed. "Mother’s known I smoked a long while."</p>

<p>"Well, but——" Dan stopped again, his embarrassment increasing
and his perplexity increasing with it as he remembered that he
himself had smoked at fifteen, surreptitiously. "Well——" he began
again, after a pause, during which Henry blew a beautifully formed
little smoke ring. "Well——"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well——" Dan said. "Well, I’m glad if you do smoke, you do it
openly, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" Henry returned, with a slight accent of surprise
that suggested his inability to perceive any reason for not smoking
openly. Then, regarding the incident as closed, he asked: "I suppose
you’ll put up a garage in proportion to the house, won’t you?
It’s about time I had a car of my own, don’t you think, sir?"</p>

<p>"I expect so," Dan said, still uncomfortable. "I expect we’ll
have to see about it before long. Anyhow, I would rather you did
it openly, Henry. I—I don’t—I——" He stopped, in difficulties with
a depth of feeling that affected his voice. "I—I don’t ever expect
to be half as good a father to you, Henry, as my—as my own father
was to me, but I—well, your uncle Harlan and I were afraid to
smoke before him until we were almost grown up. We used to sneak
out to the stable to smoke—or in alleys—and though my father was
so much better a man than I am, and so much better a father to
me than I can ever hope to be to you, I guess—I guess this is
better, Henry. I mean I guess it’s better to have you open with
me, like this. It’s an advance, I expect. I don’t know why we
were afraid to smoke before father; he never whipped us and he
was the kindest man—the best—the best father that ever——" He was
unable to continue; and Henry glanced up to see him, red-faced
and swallowing, struggling with an emotion that made the boy wonder
what in the world was the matter with him.</p>

<p>"I suppose he was, probably," Henry said. "How about that car?
Don’t you think I might as well have it pretty soon? How about
this week’s being as good as any other time?"</p>

<p>Dan recovered himself, smiled, and patted his son’s shoulder.
"I expect so, maybe. We’ll drive down to our agents on the avenue
before we go home."</p>

<p>And at this Henry proved that he could still show some animation.
He sprang up, shouting. "Ya-ay!" he cried. "<em>Vive le sport!</em>"
And he leaped into the big Morgan limousine that stood waiting
for them in the cluttered driveway. "Come on!" he shouted. "I’ll
show you how to shoot a little life into this old town!"</p>

<p>Rising from her nap, an hour later, Lena looked from her window
and saw them returning. Henry was still animated, talking busily,
and, as they came into the house, seemed willing to bear the weight
of his father’s arm across his shoulders. The mother, looking
down upon the pair, smiled thoughtfully to herself;—she was not
more indulgent with the boy than his father was; but she knew
that Henry was more hers than he was his father’s. He had always
been so, because of some chord of subtle understanding struck
by her nature and Henry’s. She had sometimes been in a temper
with him when he was a noisy little boy, but as he grew older
she had begun to feel only amusement over his naughtinesses, because
she understood them so well;—she laughed at him sometimes, but
had long since ceased to chide him. She had no blame for him,
and she knew that he would never find fault with her, no matter
what she did. They had a mysterious comprehension of each other—a
comprehension so complete that they had never needed to speak
of it.</p>

<p>She heard him chattering to his grandmother in the hall downstairs,
and knew by his tone that his father had bought him something,
of which the boy would presently tell her;—she remained standing
beside the closed window, waiting for him to come in with his
news. Then, as she stood there, a gust drove down a multitude
of soot flakes from the smokestack of an apartment house that
had been built near by, on the cross street just south of the
Oliphants’, while she was away. After the soot, which flecked
the window, the smoke itself descended, enveloping the house so
thickly that the window became opaque. Sounds were not shut out,
however, and she could still hear all too well the chattering
of a steam drill at work across the street, where a public garage
was being built. She frowned at the noise, for the drill had disturbed
her sleep; and so had the almost unceasing rumble of trucks passing
the house; and so had the constant yelp of automobile signals
rasping at one another for right of way.</p>

<p>The smoke thinned out, revealing the busy street that had been
so different when she had first looked forth upon it from this
same window, a bride. She remembered how quiet it had been then—and
suddenly she spoke aloud.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m still here!"</p>

<p>Then she laughed softly, as her eyes wandered to the north, crossed
the iron picket fence that divided the Oliphants’ yard from the
Shelbys’, and beheld the fountain swan. He was green no longer;
his colour was that of the smoke; and though he still shot a crystal
spray, the flying water was the only clean thing about him, or
in sight.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous old beast!" Lena said; but there was no bitterness
in her tone. It was a long time since she had felt jealous of
Martha; and, although she often told Harlan that Martha would
never marry him, "because she still hopes Dan’ll be a widower
some day," the warning had come to be merely jocular, without
intended sting. Moreover, she practised the same raillery with
her brother after he had taken up his residence in the town; for
George offered himself as a rival to Harlan in the half-serious
manner of a portly bachelor of forty mildly courting a contemporary.</p>

<p>Lena repeated her opinion of the swan. "Ridiculous old beast!"
This time she did not murmur the words as before; but spoke them
in her mind, and she immediately followed them with others, the
connection being made without any more feeling than she had about
the swan. Her thought was merely speculative, even a little compassionate:
"I suppose she does still hope it, poor old thing! She thinks
maybe, if I leave him——"</p>

<p>But Henry came in with the news of his father’s munificence,
and interrupted this thought that had been in her mind ever since
the night of Martha’s return from the long absence in Italy. Throughout
all the long time since then, there had always been in Lena’s
mind a conviction, however obscured or half-forgotten, that some
day she would leave her husband. </p>
