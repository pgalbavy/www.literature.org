<p>Now, it must be told that, five years before the day of the death of
Gudruda the Gentle, Saevuna, the wife of Thorgrimur Iron-Toe, gave birth
to a son, at Coldback in the Marsh, on Ran River, and when his father
came to look upon the child he called out aloud:
</p>
<p>“Here we have a wondrous bairn, for his hair is yellow like gold and his
eyes shine bright as stars.” And Thorgrimur named him Eric Brighteyes.
</p><p>Now, Coldback is but an hour’s ride from Middalhof, and it chanced,
in after years, that Thorgrimur went up to Middalhof, to keep the Yule
feast and worship in the Temple, for he was in the priesthood of Asmund
Asmundson, bringing the boy Eric with him. There also was Groa with
Swanhild, for now she dwelt at Middalhof; and the three fair children
were set together in the hall to play, and men thought it great sport to
see them. Now, Gudruda had a horse of wood and would ride it while Eric
pushed the horse along. But Swanhild smote her from the horse and called
to Eric to make it move; but he comforted Gudruda and would not, and at
that Swanhild was angry and lisped out:
</p><p>“Push thou must, if I will it, Eric.”
</p><p>Then he pushed sideways and with such good will that Swanhild fell
almost into the fire of the hearth, and, leaping up, she snatched a
brand and threw it at Gudruda, firing her clothes. Men laughed at this;
but Groa, standing apart, frowned and muttered witch-words.
</p><p>“Why lookest thou so darkly, housekeeper?” said Asmund; “the boy is
bonny and high of heart.”
</p><p>“Ah, he is bonny as no child is, and he shall be bonny all his
life-days. Nevertheless, she shall not stand against his ill luck. This
I prophesy of him: that women shall bring him to his end, and he shall
die a hero’s death, but not at the hand of his foes.”
</p>
<p>And now the years went by peacefully. Groa dwelt with her daughter
Swanhild up at Middalhof and was the love of Asmund Asmundson. But,
though he forgot his oath thus far, yet he would never take her to wife.
The witchwife was angered at this, and she schemed and plotted much
to bring it about that Asmund should wed her. But still he would not,
though in all things else she led him as it were by a halter.
</p>
<p>Twenty full years had gone by since Gudruda the Gentle was laid in
earth; and now Gudruda the Fair and Swanhild the Fatherless were women
too. Eric, too, was a man of five-and-twenty years, and no such man had
lived in Iceland. For he was strong and great of stature, his hair was
yellow as gold, and his grey eyes shone with the light of swords. He
was gentle and loving as a woman, and even as a lad his strength was the
strength of two men; and there were none in all the quarter who could
leap or swim or wrestle against Eric Brighteyes. Men held him in honour
and spoke well of him, though as yet he had done no deeds, but lived at
home on Coldback, managing the farm, for now Thorgrimur Iron-Toe, his
father, was dead. But women loved him much, and that was his bane--for
of all women he loved but one, Gudruda the Fair, Asmund’s daughter. He
loved her from a child, and her alone till his day of death, and she,
too, loved him and him only. For now Gudruda was a maid of maids, most
beautiful to see and sweet to hear. Her hair, like the hair of Eric, was
golden, and she was white as the snow on Hecla; but her eyes were large
and dark, and black lashes drooped above them. For the rest she was tall
and strong and comely, merry of face, yet tender, and the most witty of
women.
</p><p>Swanhild also was very fair; she was slender, small of limb, and dark of
hue, having eyes blue as the deep sea, and brown curling hair, enough
to veil her to the knees, and a mind of which none knew the end, for,
though she was open in her talk, her thoughts were dark and secret. This
was her joy: to draw the hearts of men to her and then to mock them.
She beguiled many in this fashion, for she was the cunningest girl in
matters of love, and she knew well the arts of women, with which they
bring men to nothing. Nevertheless she was cold at heart, and desired
power and wealth greatly, and she studied magic much, of which her
mother Groa also had a store. But Swanhild, too, loved a man, and that
was the joint in her harness by which the shaft of Fate entered her
heart, for that man was Eric Brighteyes, who loved her not. But she
desired him so sorely that, without him, all the world was dark to
her, and her soul but as a ship driven rudderless upon a winter
night. Therefore she put out all her strength to win him, and bent her
witcheries upon him, and they were not few nor small. Nevertheless they
went by him like the wind, for he dreamed ever of Gudruda alone, and he
saw no eyes but hers, though as yet they spoke no word of love one to
the other.
</p><p>But Swanhild in her wrath took counsel with her mother Groa, though
there was little liking between them; and, when she had heard the
maiden’s tale, Groa laughed aloud:
</p><p>“Dost think me blind, girl?” she said; “all of this I have seen, yea and
foreseen, and I tell thee thou art mad. Let this yeoman Eric go and I
will find thee finer fowl to fly at.”
</p><p>“Nay, that I will not,” quoth Swanhild: “for I love this man alone, and
I would win him; and Gudruda I hate, and I would overthrow her. Give me
of thy counsel.”
</p><p>Groa laughed again. “Things must be as they are fated. This now is my
rede: Asmund would turn Gudruda’s beauty to account, and that man must
be rich in friends and money who gets her to wife, and in this matter
the mind of Björn is as the mind of his father. Now we will watch, and,
when a good time chances, we will bear tales of Gudruda to Asmund and to
her brother Björn, and swear that she oversteps her modesty with
Eric. Then shall Asmund be wroth and drive Eric from Gudruda’s side.
Meanwhile, I will do this: In the north there dwells a man mighty in all
things and blown up with pride. He is named Ospakar Blacktooth. His wife
is but lately dead, and he has given out that he will wed the fairest
maid in Iceland. Now, it is in my mind to send Koll the Half-witted, my
thrall, whom Asmund gave to me, to Ospakar as though by chance. He is a
great talker and very clever, for in his half-wits is more cunning than
in the brains of most; and he shall so bepraise Gudruda’s beauty that
Ospakar will come hither to ask her in marriage; and in this fashion, if
things go well, thou shalt be rid of thy rival, and I of one who looks
scornfully upon me. But, if this fail, then there are two roads left
on which strong feet may travel to their end; and of these, one is that
thou shouldest win Eric away with thine own beauty, and that is not
little. All men are frail, and I have a draught that will make the heart
as wax; but yet the other path is surer.”
</p><p>“And what is that path, my mother?”
</p><p>“It runs through blood to blackness. By thy side is a knife and in
Gudruda’s bosom beats a heart. Dead women are unmeet for love!”
</p><p>Swanhild tossed her head and looked upon the dark face of Groa her
mother.
</p><p>“Methinks, with such an end to win, I should not fear to tread that
path, if there be need, my mother.”
</p><p>“Now I see thou art indeed my daughter. Happiness is to the bold. To
each it comes in uncertain shape. Some love power, some wealth, and
some--a man. Take that which thou lovest--I say, cut thy path to it and
take it; else shall thy life be but a weariness: for what does it serve
to win the wealth and power when thou lovest a man alone, or the man
when thou dost desire gold and the pride of place? This is wisdom: to
satisfy the longing of thy youth; for age creeps on apace and beyond is
darkness. Therefore, if thou seekest this man, and Gudruda blocks thy
path, slay her, girl--by witchcraft or by steel--and take him, and in
his arms forget that thine own are red. But first let us try the
easier plan. Daughter, I too hate this proud girl, who scorns me as her
father’s light-of-love. I too long to see that bright head of hers dull
with the dust of death, or, at the least, those proud eyes weeping tears
of shame as the man she hates leads her hence as a bride. Were it not
for her I should be Asmund’s wife, and, when she is gone, with thy
help--for he loves thee much and has cause to love thee--this I may be
yet. So in this matter, if in no other, let us go hand in hand and match
our wits against her innocence.”
</p>
<p>Now, Koll the Half-witted went upon his errand, and the time passed till
it lacked but a month to Yule, and men sat indoors, for the season was
dark and much snow fell. At length came frost, and with it a clear sky,
and Gudruda, ceasing from her spinning in the hall, went to the woman’s
porch, and, looking out, saw that the snow was hard, and a great longing
came upon her to breathe the fresh air, for there was still an hour of
daylight. So she threw a cloak about her and walked forth, taking the
road towards Coldback in the Marsh that is by Ran River. But Swanhild
watched her till she was over the hill. Then she also took a cloak and
followed on that path, for she always watched Gudruda.
</p><p>Gudruda walked on for the half of an hour or so, when she became aware
that the clouds gathered in the sky, and that the air was heavy with
snow to come. Seeing this she turned homewards, and Swanhild hid
herself to let her pass. Now flakes floated down as big and soft as fifa
flowers. Quicker and more quick they came till all the plain was one
white maze of mist, but through it Gudruda walked on, and after her
crept Swanhild, like a shadow. And now the darkness gathered and the
snow fell thick and fast, covering up the track of her footsteps and she
wandered from the path, and after her wandered Swanhild, being loath to
show herself. For an hour or more Gudruda wandered and then she called
aloud and her voice fell heavily against the cloak of snow. At the last
she grew weary and frightened, and sat down upon a shelving rock whence
the snow had slipped away. Now, a little way behind was another rock and
there Swanhild sat, for she wished to be unseen of Gudruda. So some time
passed, and Swanhild grew heavy as though with sleep, when of a sudden
a moving thing loomed upon the snowy darkness. Then Gudruda leapt to her
feet and called. A man’s voice answered:
</p><p>“Who passes there?”
</p><p>“I, Gudruda, Asmund’s daughter.”
</p><p>The form came nearer; now Swanhild could hear the snorting of a horse,
and now a man leapt from it, and that man was Eric Brighteyes.
</p><p>“Is it thou indeed, Gudruda!” he said with a laugh, and his great shape
showed darkly on the snow mist.
</p><p>“Oh, is it thou, Eric?” she answered. “I was never more joyed to see
thee; for of a truth thou dost come in a good hour. A little while and I
had seen thee no more, for my eyes grow heavy with the death-sleep.”
</p><p>“Nay, say not so. Art lost, then? Why, so am I. I came out to seek three
horses that are strayed, and was overtaken by the snow. May they
dwell in Odin’s stables, for they have led me to thee. Art thou cold,
Gudruda?”
</p><p>“But a little, Eric. Yea, there is place for thee here on the rock.”
</p><p>So he sat down by her on the stone, and Swanhild crept nearer; for now
all weariness had left her. But still the snow fell thick.
</p><p>“It comes into my mind that we two shall die here,” said Gudruda
presently.
</p><p>“Thinkest thou so?” he answered. “Well, I will say this, that I ask no
better end.”
</p><p>“It is a bad end for thee, Eric: to be choked in snow, and with all thy
deeds to do.”
</p><p>“It is a good end, Gudruda, to die at thy side, for so I shall die
happy; but I grieve for thee.”
</p><p>“Grieve not for me, Brighteyes, worse things might befall.”
</p><p>He drew nearer to her, and now he put his arms about her and clasped her
to his bosom; nor did she say him nay. Swanhild saw and lifted herself
up behind them, but for a while she heard nothing but the beating of her
heart.
</p><p>“Listen, Gudruda,” Eric said at last. “Death draws near to us, and
before it comes I would speak to thee, if speak I may.”
</p><p>“Speak on,” she whispers from his breast.
</p><p>“This I would say, then: that I love thee, and that I ask no better fate
than to die in thy arms.”
</p><p>“First shalt thou see me die in thine, Eric.”
</p><p>“Be sure, if that is so, I shall not tarry for long. Oh! Gudruda, since
I was a child I have loved thee with a mighty love, and now thou art all
to me. Better to die thus than to live without thee. Speak, then, while
there is time.”
</p><p>“I will not hide from thee, Eric, that thy words are sweet in my ears.”
</p><p>And now Gudruda sobs and the tears fall fast from her dark eyes.
</p><p>“Nay, weep not. Dost thou, then, love me?”
</p><p>“Ay, sure enough, Eric.”
</p><p>“Then kiss me before we pass. A man should not die thus, and yet men
have died worse.”
</p><p>And so these two kissed, for the first time, out in the snow on
Coldback, and that first kiss was long and sweet.
</p><p>Swanhild heard and her blood seethed within her as water seethes in
a boiling spring when the fires wake beneath. She put her hand to her
kirtle and gripped the knife at her side. She half drew it, then drove
it back.
</p><p>“Cold kills as sure as steel,” she said in her heart. “If I slay her I
cannot save myself or him. Let us die in peace, and let the snow cover
up our troubling.” And once more she listened.
</p><p>“Ah, sweet,” said Eric, “even in the midst of death there is hope of
life. Swear to me, then, that if by chance we live thou wilt love me
always as thou lovest me now.”
</p><p>“Ay, Eric, I swear that and readily.”
</p><p>“And swear, come what may, that thou wilt wed no man but me.”
</p><p>“I swear, if thou dost remain true to me, that I will wed none but thee,
Eric.”
</p><p>“Then I am sure of thee.”
</p><p>“Boast not overmuch, Eric: if thou dost live thy days are all before
thee, and with times come trials.”
</p><p>Now the snow whirled down faster and more thick, till these two, clasped
heart to heart, were but a heap of white, and all white was the horse,
and Swanhild was nearly buried.
</p><p>“Where go we when we die, Eric?” said Gudruda; “in Odin’s house there is
no place for maids, and how shall my feet fare without thee?”
</p><p>“Nay, sweet, my May, Valhalla shuts its gates to me, a deedless man; up
Bifrost’s rainbow bridge I may not travel, for I do not die with byrnie
on breast and sword aloft. To Hela shall we go, and hand in hand.”
</p><p>“Art thou sure, Eric, that men find these abodes? To say sooth, at times
I misdoubt me of them.”
</p><p>“I am not so sure but that I also doubt. Still, I know this: that where
thou goest there I shall be, Gudruda.”
</p><p>“Then things are well, and well work the Norns.[*] Still, Eric, of a
sudden I grow fey: for it comes upon me that I shall not die to-night,
but that, nevertheless, I shall die with thy arms about me, and at thy
side. There, I see it on the snow! I lie by thee, sleeping, and one
comes with hands outstretched and sleep falls from them like a mist--by
Freya, it is Swanhild’s self! Oh! it is gone.”
</p><p>[*] The Northern Fates.
</p><p>“It was nothing, Gudruda, but a vision of the snow--an untimely dream
that comes before the sleep. I grow cold and my eyes are heavy; kiss me
once again.”
</p><p>“It was no dream, Eric, and ever I doubt me of Swanhild, for I think she
loves thee also, and she is fair and my enemy,” says Gudruda, laying her
snow-cold lips on his lips. “Oh, Eric, awake! awake! See, the snow is
done.”
</p><p>He stumbled to his feet and looked forth. Lo! out across the sky flared
the wild Northern fires, throwing light upon the darkness.
</p><p>“Now it seems that I know the land,” said Eric. “Look: yonder are Golden
Falls, though we did not hear them because of the snow; and there, out
at sea, loom the Westmans; and that dark thing is the Temple Hof, and
behind it stands the stead. We are saved, Gudruda, and thus far indeed
thou wast fey. Now rise, ere thy limbs stiffen, and I will set thee on
the horse, if he still can run, and lead thee down to Middalhof before
the witchlights fail us.”
</p><p>“So it shall be, Eric.”
</p><p>Now he led Gudruda to the horse--that, seeing its master, snorted and
shook the snow from its coat, for it was not frozen--and set her on the
saddle, and put his arm about her waist, and they passed slowly through
the deep snow. And Swanhild, too, crept from her place, for her burning
rage had kept the life in her, and followed after them. Many times she
fell, and once she was nearly swallowed in a drift of snow and cried out
in her fear.
</p><p>“Who called aloud?” said Eric, turning; “I thought I heard a voice.”
</p><p>“Nay,” answers Gudruda, “it was but a night-hawk screaming.”
</p><p>Now Swanhild lay quiet in the drift, but she said in her heart:
</p><p>“Ay, a night-hawk that shall tear out those dark eyes of thine, mine
enemy!”
</p><p>The two go on and at length they come to the banked roadway that runs
past the Temple to Asmund’s hall. Here Swanhild leaves them, and,
climbing over the turf-wall into the home meadow, passes round the
hall by the outbuildings and so comes to the west end of the house, and
enters by the men’s door unnoticed of any. For all the people, seeing
a horse coming and a woman seated on it, were gathered in front of the
hall. But Swanhild ran to that shut bed where she slept, and, closing
the curtain, threw off her garments, shook the snow from her hair, and
put on a linen kirtle. Then she rested a while, for she was weary, and,
going to the kitchen, warmed herself at the fire.
</p><p>Meanwhile Eric and Gudruda came to the house and there Asmund greeted
them well, for he was troubled in his heart about his daughter, and very
glad to know her living, seeing that men had but now begun to search for
her, because of the snow and the darkness.
</p><p>Now Gudruda told her tale, but not all of it, and Asmund bade Eric to
the house. Then one asked about Swanhild, and Eric said that he had seen
nothing of her, and Asmund was sad at this, for he loved Swanhild. But
as he told all men to go and search, an old wife came and said that
Swanhild was in the kitchen, and while the carline spoke she came into
the hall, dressed in white, very pale, and with shining eyes and fair to
see.
</p><p>“Where hast thou been, Swanhild?” said Asmund. “I thought certainly thou
wast perishing with Gudruda in the snow, and now all men go to seek thee
while the witchlights burn.”
</p><p>“Nay, foster-father, I have been to the Temple,” she answered, lying.
“So Gudruda has but narrowly escaped the snow, thanks be to Brighteyes
yonder! Surely I am glad of it, for we could ill spare our sweet
sister,” and, going up to her, she kissed her. But Gudruda saw that
her eyes burned like fire and felt that her lips were cold as ice, and
shrank back wondering.
