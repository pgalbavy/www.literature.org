<p>"Billiard, did you ever see a ghost?"</p>

<p>It was almost a week since the bank robbery had occurred, and
still no clue as to the identity of the robbers had been found,
although posses were still searching the country, determined to
catch them if such a thing were possible.  But the excitement
of the event had already died down in the youthful minds of Silver
Bow, and other topics of conversation absorbed their attention.</p>

<p>"Naw," answered Billiard contemptuously, without looking up from
the stick he was whittling.  "What's eating you, Toady?  There
ain't any ghosts, and you know it."</p>

<p>"What about that haunted house in the east end of town?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't haunted."</p>

<p>"Susie says it is."</p>

<p>"And Tabitha has lived alone near it for six or seven years and
she has never seen anything stirring there."</p>

<p>"But ghosts walk only at midnight.  She's never been there at
night."</p>

<p>"Aw, you softy<hr>"</p>

<p>"Susie says the Gates boy declares he saw a ghost in the graveyard
one night."</p>

<p>"Well, that's different.  I don't blame a ghost for walking there."</p>

<p>"Why, Billiard McKittrick, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a lonesomer place on earth than the Silver
Bow graveyard?" demanded Billiard.  "Why, it's the worst looking
cemetery in the country, I believe,&mdash;just heaps of rocks and wooden
sticks to show where folks are buried.  Tabitha says they <em>blast</em>
out the graves with dynamite, six at a time, and fill them up
with people as fast as they die.  Would you rest easy if you were
planted in that style? Wouldn't your ghost want to get out and
walk?"</p>

<p>"<em>Billiard McKittrick</em>!"  Toady looked positively shocked. 
Then after a moment, as the older boy made no reply, the younger
one continued thoughtfully, "Maybe that's what is the matter with
the ghost in the haunted house."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Toady, I tell you there ain't such a thing as a ghost!"</p>

<p>"I'll stump you to go down to the haunted house some time and
find out."</p>

<p>"All right, come along!"</p>

<p>"Not during daylight.  It must be after dark.  Midnight is the
best time, Susie says."</p>

<p>"Bother Susie!  Why don't you get her to go with you?"</p>

<p>"You are afraid to go!" jeered Toady.</p>

<p>"Am not!" retorted Billiard angrily.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you take my dare?"</p>

<p>"It's all tommy-rot," insisted Billiard, with a fine show of
scorn.</p>

<p>"'Fraid cat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll take you up," cried the other, stung into recklessness
by Toady's taunts.  "We'll go to-night."</p>

<p>"To-night?" stammered Toady, much abashed at his brother's sudden
acceptance of the dare.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-night!"</p>

<p>"What's your hurry?"</p>

<p>"Who's the 'fraid cat now?" taunted Billiard.</p>

<p>"Not me!  To-night's the time.  We'll set the alarm-clock for
half-past ten."</p>

<p>"Suppose it wakes the rest of the bunch?"</p>

<p>"They'll think it's a mistake, and in a few minutes will be asleep
again, and we can steal outside without their hearing us at all."</p>

<p>So it was decided, and though each boy, deep down in his heart,
hoped that the other would back out before the hour set, both
resolved not to show the white feather, and as the alarm-clock
pealed forth its summons in the silence of the night, two sleepy
lads crept stealthily out of bed, drew on their clothes, and without
exchanging a word, started for the haunted house at the other
end of town.</p>

<p>Never, it seemed to the quaking boys, had the desert night seemed
so black.  The stars were shining, to be sure, but the very heavens
seemed further away, and the silence was appalling.  Nervous,
excited, dreading the ordeal, each boy waited for the other to
propose that they give up their wild-goose chase; but neither
was willing to acknowledge his cowardice first, so they stumbled
fearfully on, clutching each other's hands to keep from falling,
they told themselves, but really to feel the nearness of another
human being.</p>

<p>At length, however, they reached the old, abandoned shack, where
they were to keep their ghostly vigil, and with bated breath they
opened the sagging door and crept trembling over the threshold
into the black shadows of the interior.  Fear held them tongue-tied,
and they crouched upon the dusty floor as close to the door as
they could get.  The silence was intense, terrifying.</p>

<p>Then the stillness was sharply broken by a hoarse whisper, "What
was that, Bill?"</p>

<p>Billiard, thinking Toady had spoken to him, was about to reply
when a second voice answered, "Only the wind, I reckon.  Shut
up."</p>

<p>"But it sounded like someone opened the door."</p>

<p>"You're as bad as an old woman with the fidgets," said the second
voice crossly.  "Go to sleep, can't you?  At least, let me sleep. 
I tell you we're safe enough.  The fools will never think of looking
for us here. This is a <em>haunted</em> house and no one ever
comes here.  When they get tired of scouring the desert and give
up hunting for us, we'll light out, but until then we've <em>got</em>
to lie low; and we might as well spend our time snoozing as to
be worrying all the while."</p>

<p>"The bank robbers!" thought each boy to himself.  What should
they do? It would be impossible for two small boys to capture
such desperadoes in the dead of night, especially as neither lad
was armed, they argued. Their only course was to steal noiselessly
away, rouse the sheriff, bring back a posse and surprise the men
in hiding.</p>

<p>With one impulse, the terrified boys clasped hands, slipped cautiously
out of the house, hardly daring to breathe for fear of being heard,
and raced off along the road toward the sleeping town with all
the speed they could muster.  Once they fancied they heard a voice
call to them, but this only increased their head-long flight. 
Their feet seemed fairly to skim over the ground, and when they
reached the main street of the town they were breathless, exhausted
and frightened almost past speaking.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;does&mdash;the sheriff&mdash;live?" panted Billiard, as they tore
down the last steep slope.</p>

<p>"Dunno," gasped Toady.</p>

<p>"Then how'll we find him?"</p>

<p>"Drug-store."</p>

<p>"It's shut."</p>

<p>"Ring the night bell."</p>

<p>And ring they did, sending peal after peal echoing through the
silent building until the sleepy proprietor, dishevelled and wrathy,
stumbled through the doorway, and demanded fiercely, "What the
deuce is wanted?"</p>

<p>"The robbers&mdash;" half sobbed the boys.</p>

<p>"Well, they ain't here," snarled the angry druggist, not catching
the meaning of their words.  "Now you hike for home and the next
time you want to play a practical joke<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, this isn't a joke!" cried Toady imploringly.  "We've found
the sure 'nough robbers, but<hr>"</p>

<p>"We aren't big enough to capture them," finished Billiard.</p>

<p>"Aw, come off!" said the man, beginning to see from the boys'
demeanor that something was really wrong.  "You are having a bad
dream.  How do you happen to be wandering around town this time
of night?"</p>

<p>"We dared each other to visit the haunted house to see if there
was a really ghost, like Susie said."</p>

<p>"And you found one, did you?" the druggist laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Oh, this ain't a ghost.  It's burglars, truly!  They talked
and we heard what they said," cried Toady with convincing earnestness.</p>

<p>"And what <em>did</em> they say?" persisted the druggist, though
in a different tone of voice.</p>

<p>Briefly they recounted their adventure in the vacant house, and
as the man listened he took down the telephone, said a few words
which the boys could not hear, and hung up the receiver again. 
Almost immediately there was a sound of footsteps without, and
an armed citizen of Silver Bow appeared in the doorway, then another,
and another, until a score or more had gathered just outside the
building. There was a hasty consultation one with another, then
the boys were bidden to repeat the story they had told the druggist,
and after the men had heard the meagre details, the posse separated,
vanishing one by one in the blackness.  But instinctively the
boys knew that they would attempt to surround the haunted house,
and taking its occupants by surprise, would compel them to surrender.</p>

<p>They wanted to remain at the drug-store until the capture was
effected, but the keeper ordered them home to bed, and they reluctantly
obeyed, listening every step of the way for the sound of shots. 
But nothing occurred to mar the stillness of the night, and they
wondered if the desperadoes had after all escaped.  So anxious
were they, and so nervous over their unusual experience that it
seemed as if sleep would never come to close their eyes, as they
lay once more in their bed at the Eagles' Nest; and they were
astonished to find themselves waking up the next morning at the
sound of someone knocking at their door.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" called Billiard, vaguely wondering if he could have
dreamed all that had transpired during the past twelve hours.</p>

<p>"Susie," answered a voice from the hall.  "The sheriff wants
to see you."</p>

<p>"The sheriff?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Hurry up!  The bank robbers have been caught and you have
to go to the justice of the peace's office."</p>

<p>"Then it's really so," sighed Billiard in relief.</p>

<p>"Course it is!" retorted Toady, now thoroughly awake.  "But what
do you s'pose the <em>sheriff</em> wants us for?"</p>

<p>"Dunno.  Quickest way to find out is to go down and see."</p>

<p>Susie and the twins were waiting for them when they emerged from
their room, and ecstatically announced, "We're all going, too. 
They want you to be <em>witnesses</em>, and Tabitha to take notes. 
No one else in town writes shorthand."</p>

<p>"But what is it all about?" demanded Billiard.  "Ain't the robbers
in jail?"</p>

<p>"We have no real jail here," explained Tabitha, who chanced to
overhear his question.  "When a man does anything that he has
to go to prison for, they take him to the county seat.  This court
only tries to prove whether or not there is evidence enough to
hold him for trial by the county.  Hurry up, they are waiting
for us.  And children, remember, you must come straight back here
after you take a look at the prisoners.  Queer how youngsters
want to see such things, isn't it? Perhaps it will be quite a
while before I can get back, but I know I can trust you to keep
out of mischief and mind Mercedes.  Oh, Glory, I've got nervous
chills already about taking that dictation.  The lawyer who is
to defend the robbers can talk like lightning."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" replied Gloriana reassuringly.  "You won't have any
trouble at all, I know.  They will take into consideration the
fact that you have no experience outside of school.  Is this the
place?  What a funny looking court!  Does he live here, too? 
The justice of peace, I mean."</p>

<p>"Why, Tabitha!" interrupted Irene, clutching the older girl by
the arm. "Look there!  That's our candy man,&mdash;the tallest one&mdash;and
they've got him hand-cuffed.  Does&mdash;  Is <em>he</em> the man they
say robbed the bank?  I don't believe he ever did it!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" warned Inez, giving her twin a vicious dig in the ribs. 
But the damage was already done.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Tabitha, pausing on the threshold
of the tiny, dirty room that served as courthouse for the town
of Silver Bow.</p>

<p>"Yes, what do you mean?" asked one of the lawyers, who had chanced
to overhear the remark.</p>

<p>"He made candy for us the day you went to the river and left
us at home," explained Irene, ignoring the frowns of her partners
in guilt.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it."</p>

<p>Bit by bit the story came out, and to Irene's great grief it
forged another link in the chain of evidence already so strong
against the cheery stranger.  "I don't want him to go to jail,"
she sobbed.  "He's an awfully nice man."</p>

<p>"But, dear, he is a thief," Tabitha told her.  "He ought to go
to jail."</p>

<p>"If they'd only let him loose this time, I'm sure he would never
steal again," the child staunchly maintained.  But in spite of
her faith in him, the "candy man," as the children continued to
call him, was sent to the county seat for trial, convicted, and
sentenced to a long term in prison.</p>

<p>"He shouldn't have stolen if he didn't want to go to prison,"
asserted Billiard virtuously.  "If he hadn't robbed the bank,
he never would have had to hide in the haunted house and we wouldn't
have found them there."</p>

<p>"But as 'tis," added Toady, "they paid Billiard and me each fifty
dollars for finding them.  I mean the town paid us."</p>

<p>"Though you didn't discover whether there are any ghosts or not,"
said Susie much disappointed.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" retorted the boys, drawing out their little hoard
of gold pieces and gloating over them.  "I wish there were more
haunted houses if they'd all pay us as well as this one did. 
Now, what shall we do with our money?"</p>
