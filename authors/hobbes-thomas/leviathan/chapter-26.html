<p>Civill Law what
By CIVILL LAWES, I understand the Lawes, that men are therefore
bound to observe, because they are Members, not of this, or that
Common-wealth in particular, but of a Common-wealth.  For the knowledge
of particular Lawes belongeth to them, that professe the study of
the Lawes of their severall Countries; but the knowledge of Civill Law
in generall, to any man.  The antient Law of Rome was called their
Civil Law, from the word Civitas, which signifies a Common-wealth;
And those Countries, which having been under the Roman Empire,
and governed by that Law, retaine still such part thereof as they
think fit, call that part the Civill Law, to distinguish it from
the rest of their own Civill Lawes.  But that is not it I intend
to speak of here; my designe being not to shew what is Law here,
and there; but what is Law; as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and divers
others have done, without taking upon them the profession of
the study of the Law.</p>

<p>And first it manifest, that Law in generall, is not Counsell,
but Command; nor a Command of any man to any man; but only of him,
whose Command is addressed to one formerly obliged to obey him.
And as for Civill Law, it addeth only the name of the person
Commanding, which is Persona Civitatis, the Person of the Common-wealth.</p>

<p>Which considered, I define Civill Law in this Manner.  &quot;CIVILL LAW,
Is to every Subject, those Rules, which the Common-wealth hath
Commanded him, by Word, Writing, or other sufficient Sign of the Will,
to make use of, for the Distinction of Right, and Wrong; that is to say,
of what is contrary, and what is not contrary to the Rule.&quot;</p>

<p>In which definition, there is nothing that is not at first sight evident.
For every man seeth, that some Lawes are addressed to all the Subjects
in generall; some to particular Provinces; some to particular Vocations;
and some to particular Men; and are therefore Lawes, to every of those
to whom the Command is directed; and to none else.  As also,
that Lawes are the Rules of Just, and Unjust; nothing being
reputed Unjust, that is not contrary to some Law.  Likewise, that
none can make Lawes but the Common-wealth; because our Subjection
is to the Common-wealth only: and that Commands, are to be signified
by sufficient Signs; because a man knows not otherwise how to obey them.
And therefore, whatsoever can from this definition by necessary
consequence be deduced, ought to be acknowledged for truth.
Now I deduce from it this that followeth.</p>

<p>The Soveraign Is Legislator
1. The Legislator in all Common-wealths, is only the Soveraign,
be he one Man, as in a Monarchy, or one Assembly of men, as in
a Democracy, or Aristocracy.  For the Legislator, is he that
maketh the Law.  And the Common-wealth only, praescribes,
and commandeth the observation of those rules, which we call Law:
Therefore the Common-wealth is the Legislator.  But the Common-wealth
is no Person, nor has capacity to doe any thing, but by the
Representative, (that is, the Soveraign;) and therefore the Soveraign
is the sole Legislator.  For the same reason, none can abrogate
a Law made, but the Soveraign; because a Law is not abrogated,
but by another Law, that forbiddeth it to be put in execution.</p>

<p>And Not Subject To Civill Law
2. The Soveraign of a Common-wealth, be it an Assembly, or one Man,
is not subject to the Civill Lawes.  For having power to make,
and repeale Lawes, he may when he pleaseth, free himselfe from
that subjection, by repealing those Lawes that trouble him,
and making of new; and consequently he was free before.  For he is free,
that can be free when he will: Nor is it possible for any person
to be bound to himselfe; because he that can bind, can release;
and therefore he that is bound to himselfe onely, is not bound.</p>

<p>Use, A Law Not By Vertue Of Time, But Of
The Soveraigns Consent
3. When long Use obtaineth the authority of a Law, it is not
the Length of Time that maketh the Authority, but the Will
of the Soveraign signified by his silence, (for Silence is sometimes
an argument of Consent;) and it is no longer Law, then the
Soveraign shall be silent therein.  And therefore if the Soveraign
shall have a question of Right grounded, not upon his present Will,
but upon the Lawes formerly made; the Length of Time shal bring
no prejudice to his Right; but the question shal be judged by Equity.
For many unjust Actions, and unjust Sentences, go uncontrolled
a longer time, than any man can remember.  And our Lawyers account
no Customes Law, but such as are reasonable, and that evill Customes
are to be abolished; But the Judgement of what is reasonable,
and of what is to be abolished, belongeth to him that maketh the Law,
which is the Soveraign Assembly, or Monarch.</p>

<p>The Law Of Nature, And The Civill Law Contain Each Other
4. The Law of Nature, and the Civill Law, contain each other,
and are of equall extent.  For the Lawes of Nature, which consist
in Equity, Justice, Gratitude, and other morall Vertues on
these depending, in the condition of meer Nature (as I have said
before in the end of the 15th Chapter,) are not properly Lawes,
but qualities that dispose men to peace, and to obedience.
When a Common-wealth is once settled, then are they actually Lawes,
and not before; as being then the commands of the Common-wealth;
and therefore also Civill Lawes: for it is the Soveraign Power
that obliges men to obey them.  For in the differences of private men,
to declare, what is Equity, what is Justice, and what is morall Vertue,
and to make them binding, there is need of the Ordinances of
Soveraign Power, and Punishments to be ordained for such as shall
break them; which Ordinances are therefore part of the Civill Law.
The Law of Nature therefore is a part of the Civill Law in all
Common-wealths of the world.  Reciprocally also, the Civill Law
is a part of the Dictates of Nature.  For Justice, that is to say,
Performance of Covenant, and giving to every man his own, is a Dictate
of the Law of Nature.  But every subject in a Common-wealth,
hath covenanted to obey the Civill Law, (either one with another,
as when they assemble to make a common Representative, or with
the Representative it selfe one by one, when subdued by the Sword
they promise obedience, that they may receive life;) And therefore
Obedience to the Civill Law is part also of the Law of Nature.
Civill, and Naturall Law are not different kinds, but different
parts of Law; whereof one part being written, is called Civill,
the other unwritten, Naturall.  But the Right of Nature, that is,
the naturall Liberty of man, may by the Civill Law be abridged,
and restrained: nay, the end of making Lawes, is no other, but such
Restraint; without the which there cannot possibly be any Peace.
And Law was brought into the world for nothing else, but to limit
the naturall liberty of particular men, in such manner, as they
might not hurt, but assist one another, and joyn together against
a common Enemy.</p>

<p>Provinciall Lawes Are Not Made By Custome,
But By The Soveraign Power
5. If the Soveraign of one Common-wealth, subdue a people that
have lived under other written Lawes, and afterwards govern
them by the same Lawes, by which they were governed before;
yet those Lawes are the Civill Lawes of the Victor, and not
of the Vanquished Common-wealth,  For the Legislator is he,
not by whose authority the Lawes were first made, but by whose
authority they now continue to be Lawes.  And therefore where
there be divers Provinces, within the Dominion of a Common-wealth,
and in those Provinces diversity of Lawes, which commonly are called
the Customes of each severall Province, we are not to understand
that such Customes have their Force, onely from Length of Time;
but that they were antiently Lawes written, or otherwise made known,
for the Constitutions, and Statutes of their Soveraigns; and are
now Lawes, not by vertue of the Praescription of time, but by
the Constitutions of their present Soveraigns.  But if an unwritten Law,
in all the Provinces of a Dominion, shall be generally observed,
and no iniquity appear in the use thereof; that law can be no other
but a Law of Nature, equally obliging all man-kind.</p>

<p>Some Foolish Opinions Of Lawyers Concerning
The Making Of Lawes
6. Seeing then all Lawes, written, and unwritten, have their Authority,
and force, from the Will of the Common-wealth; that is to say,
from the Will of the Representative; which in a Monarchy is the Monarch,
and in other Common-wealths the Soveraign Assembly; a man may wonder
from whence proceed such opinions, as are found in the Books
of Lawyers of eminence in severall Common-wealths, directly,
or by consequence making the Legislative Power depend on private men,
or subordinate Judges.  As for example, &quot;That the Common Law, hath no
Controuler but the Parlament;&quot; which is true onely where a Parlament
has the Soveraign Power, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved,
but by their own discretion.  For if there be a right in any else
to dissolve them, there is a right also to controule them,
and consequently to controule their controulings.  And if there be
no such right, then the Controuler of Lawes is not Parlamentum,
but Rex In Parlamento.  And where a Parlament is Soveraign,
if it should assemble never so many, or so wise men, from the
Countries subject to them, for whatsoever cause; yet there is no man
will believe, that such an Assembly hath thereby acquired to themselves
a Legislative Power.  Item, that the two arms of a Common-wealth,
are Force, and Justice; The First Whereof Is In The King; The Other
Deposited In The Hands Of The Parlament.  As if a Common-wealth
could consist, where the Force were in any hand, which Justice had not
the Authority to command and govern.</p>

<h1 class="hft-headings">7. That Law can never be against Reason, our Lawyers are agreed;
and that not the Letter,(that is, every construction of it,) but that
which is according to the Intention of the Legislator, is the Law.
And it is true: but the doubt is, of whose Reason it is, that shall
be received for Law.  It is not meant of any private Reason;
for then there would be as much contradiction in the Lawes,
as there is in the Schooles; nor yet (as Sr. Ed, Coke makes it
(Sir Edward Coke, upon Littleton Lib.2. Ch.6 fol 97.b),) an Artificiall
Perfection of Reason, Gotten By Long Study, Observation, And Experience,
(as his was.)  For it is possible long study may encrease, and confirm
erroneous Sentences: and where men build on false grounds, the more
they build, the greater is the ruine; and of those that study,
and observe with equall time, and diligence, the reasons and
resolutions are, and must remain discordant: and therefore it is not
that Juris Prudentia, or wisedome of subordinate Judges; but the Reason
of this our Artificiall Man the Common-wealth, and his Command,
that maketh Law: And the Common-wealth being in their Representative
but one Person, there cannot easily arise any contradiction in the Lawes;
and when there doth, the same Reason is able, by interpretation,
or alteration, to take it away.  In all Courts of Justice,
the Soveraign (which is the Person of the Common-wealth,) is he
that Judgeth: The subordinate Judge, ought to have regard to the reason,
which moved his Soveraign to make such Law, that his Sentence may be
according thereunto; which then is his Soveraigns Sentence;
otherwise it is his own, and an unjust one.</h1>

<p>Law Made, If Not Also Made Known, Is No Law
8. From this, that the Law is a Command, and a Command consisteth
in declaration, or manifestation of the will of him that commandeth,
by voyce, writing, or some other sufficient argument of the same,
we may understand, that the Command of the Common-wealth, is Law onely
to those, that have means to take notice of it.  Over naturall fooles,
children, or mad-men there is no Law, no more than over brute beasts;
nor are they capable of the title of just, or unjust; because they
had never power to make any covenant, or to understand the consequences
thereof; and consequently never took upon them to authorise the actions
of any Soveraign, as they must do that make to themselves a Common-wealth.
And as those from whom Nature, or Accident hath taken away the notice
of all Lawes in generall; so also every man, from whom any accident,
not proceeding from his own default, hath taken away the means to
take notice of any particular Law, is excused, if he observe it not;
And to speak properly, that Law is no Law to him.  It is therefore
necessary, to consider in this place, what arguments, and signes
be sufficient for the knowledge of what is the Law; that is to say,
what is the will of the Soveraign, as well in Monarchies, as in other
formes of government.</p>

<p>Unwritten Lawes Are All Of Them Lawes Of Nature
And first, if it be a Law that obliges all the Subjects without exception,
and is not written, nor otherwise published in such places as they
may take notice thereof, it is a Law of Nature.  For whatsoever men
are to take knowledge of for Law, not upon other mens words,
but every one from his own reason, must be such as is agreeable
to the reason of all men; which no Law can be, but the Law of Nature.
The Lawes of Nature therefore need not any publishing, nor Proclamation;
as being contained in this one Sentence, approved by all the world,
&quot;Do not that to another, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done
by another to thy selfe.&quot;</p>

<p>Secondly, if it be a Law that obliges only some condition of men,
or one particular man and be not written, nor published by word,
then also it is a Law of Nature; and known by the same arguments, and
signs, that distinguish those in such a condition, from other Subjects.
For whatsoever Law is not written, or some way published by him
that makes it Law, can be known no way, but by the reason of him
that is to obey it; and is therefore also a Law not only Civill,
but Naturall.  For example, if the Soveraign employ a Publique Minister,
without written Instructions what to doe; he is obliged to take
for Instructions the Dictates of Reason; As if he make a Judge,
The Judge is to take notice, that his Sentence ought to be according
to the reason of his Soveraign, which being alwaies understood
to be Equity, he is bound to it by the Law of Nature: Or if an Ambassador,
he is (in al things not conteined in his written Instructions)
to take for Instruction that which Reason dictates to be most
conducing to his Soveraigns interest; and so of all other Ministers
of the Soveraignty, publique and private.  All which Instructions
of naturall Reason may be comprehended under one name of Fidelity;
which is a branch of naturall Justice.</p>

<p>The Law of Nature excepted, it belongeth to the essence of all
other Lawes, to be made known, to every man that shall be obliged
to obey them, either by word, or writing, or some other act,
known to proceed from the Soveraign Authority.  For the will of another,
cannot be understood, but by his own word, or act, or by conjecture
taken from his scope and purpose; which in the person of the
Common-wealth, is to be supposed alwaies consonant to Equity and Reason.
And in antient time, before letters were in common use, the Lawes
were many times put into verse; that the rude people taking pleasure in
singing, or reciting them, might the more easily reteine them in memory.
And for the same reason Solomon adviseth a man, to bind the ten
Commandements (Prov. 7. 3) upon his ten fingers.  And for the Law
which Moses gave to the people of Israel at the renewing of the Covenant,
(Deut. 11. 19) he biddeth them to teach it their Children,
by discoursing of it both at home, and upon the way; at going to bed,
and at rising from bed; and to write it upon the posts, and dores
of their houses; and (Deut. 31. 12) to assemble the people, man,
woman, and child, to heare it read.</p>

<p>Nothing Is Law Where The Legislator Cannot Be Known
Nor is it enough the Law be written, and published; but also that there
be manifest signs, that it proceedeth from the will of the Soveraign.
For private men, when they have, or think they have force enough
to secure their unjust designes, and convoy them safely to their
ambitious ends, may publish for Lawes what they please, without,
or against the Legislative Authority.  There is therefore requisite,
not only a Declaration of the Law, but also sufficient signes
of the Author, and Authority.  The Author, or Legislator is supposed
in every Common-wealth to be evident, because he is the Soveraign,
who having been Constituted by the consent of every one, is supposed
by every one to be sufficiently known.  And though the ignorance,
and security of men be such, for the most part, as that when the memory
of the first Constitution of their Common-wealth is worn out,
they doe not consider, by whose power they use to be defended
against their enemies, and to have their industry protected,
and to be righted when injury is done them; yet because no
man that considers, can make question of it, no excuse can be
derived from the ignorance of where the Soveraignty is placed.
And it is a Dictate of Naturall Reason, and consequently an
evident Law of Nature, that no man ought to weaken that power,
the protection whereof he hath himself demanded, or wittingly received
against others.  Therefore of who is Soveraign, no man, but by
his own fault, (whatsoever evill men suggest,) can make any doubt.
The difficulty consisteth in the evidence of the Authority derived
from him; The removing whereof, dependeth on the knowledge of the
publique Registers, publique Counsels, publique Ministers, and
publique Seales; by which all Lawes are sufficiently verified.</p>

<p>Difference Between Verifying And Authorising
 Verifyed, I say, not Authorised: for the Verification, is but
the Testimony and Record; not the Authority of the law; which consisteth
in the Command of the Soveraign only.</p>

<p>The Law Verifyed By The Subordinate Judge
If therefore a man have a question of Injury, depending on the
Law of Nature; that is to say, on common Equity; the Sentence
of the Judge, that by Commission hath Authority to take cognisance
of such causes, is a sufficient Verification of the Law of Nature
in that individuall case.  For though the advice of one that professeth
the study of the Law, be usefull for the avoyding of contention;
yet it is but advice; tis the Judge must tell men what is Law,
upon the hearing of the Controversy.</p>

<p>By The Publique Registers
But when the question is of injury, or crime, upon a written Law;
every man by recourse to the Registers, by himself, or others,
may (if he will) be sufficiently enformed, before he doe such injury,
or commit the crime, whither it be an injury, or not: Nay he ought to
doe so: for when a man doubts whether the act he goeth about, be just,
or injust; and may informe himself, if he will; the doing is unlawfull.
In like manner, he that supposeth himself injured, in a case determined
by the written Law, which he may by himself, or others see and consider;
if he complaine before he consults with the Law, he does unjustly,
and bewrayeth a disposition rather to vex other men, than to demand
his own right.</p>

<p>By Letters Patent, And Publique Seale
If the question be of Obedience to a publique Officer; To have seen
his Commission, with the Publique Seale, and heard it read; or to
have had the means to be informed of it, if a man would, is a sufficient
Verification of his Authority.  For every man is obliged to doe
his best endeavour, to informe himself of all written Lawes,
that may concerne his own future actions.</p>

<p>The Interpretation Of The Law Dependeth
On The Soveraign Power
The Legislator known; and the Lawes, either by writing, or by the light of Nature, sufficiently published; there wanteth yet another very materiall circumstance to make them obligatory.  For it is not the Letter, but the Intendment, or Meaning; that is to say, the authentique Interpretation of the Law (which is the sense of the Legislator,) in which the nature of the Law consisteth; And therefore the Interpretation of all Lawes dependeth on the Authority Soveraign; and the Interpreters can be none but those, which the Soveraign, (to whom only the Subject oweth obedience) shall appoint.  For else, by the craft of an Interpreter, the Law my be made to beare a sense, contrary to that of the Soveraign; by which means the Interpreter becomes the Legislator.</p>

<p>All Lawes Need Interpretation
All Laws, written, and unwritten, have need of Interpretation.
The unwritten Law of Nature, though it be easy to such, as without
partiality, and passion, make use of their naturall reason,
and therefore leaves the violators thereof without excuse;
yet considering there be very few, perhaps none, that in some cases
are not blinded by self love, or some other passion, it is now become
of all Laws the most obscure; and has consequently the greatest need
of able Interpreters.  The written Laws, if they be short, are easily
mis-interpreted, from the divers significations of a word, or two;
if long, they be more obscure by the diverse significations of
many words: in so much as no written Law, delivered in few,
or many words, can be well understood, without a perfect understanding
of the finall causes, for which the Law was made; the knowledge of
which finall causes is in the Legislator.  To him therefore there can
not be any knot in the Law, insoluble; either by finding out the ends,
to undoe it by; or else by making what ends he will, (as Alexander
did with his sword in the Gordian knot,) by the Legislative power;
which no other Interpreter can doe.</p>

<p>The Authenticall Interpretation Of Law Is Not
That Of Writers
The Interpretation of the Lawes of Nature, in a Common-wealth,
dependeth not on the books of Morall Philosophy.  The Authority
of writers, without the Authority of the Common-wealth, maketh not
their opinions Law, be they never so true.  That which I have written
in this Treatise, concerning the Morall Vertues, and of their necessity,
for the procuring, and maintaining peace, though it bee evident Truth,
is not therefore presently Law; but because in all Common-wealths
in the world, it is part of the Civill Law: For though it be
naturally reasonable; yet it is by the Soveraigne Power that
it is Law: Otherwise, it were a great errour, to call the Lawes
of Nature unwritten Law; whereof wee see so many volumes published,
and in them so many contradictions of one another, and of themselves.</p>

<p>The Interpreter Of The Law Is The Judge Giving Sentence
Viva Voce In Every Particular Case
The Interpretation of the Law of Nature, is the Sentence of the Judge
constituted by the Soveraign Authority, to heare and determine
such controversies, as depend thereon; and consisteth in the
application of the Law to the present case.  For in the act of
Judicature, the Judge doth no more but consider, whither the demand
of the party, be consonant to naturall reason, and Equity;
and the Sentence he giveth, is therefore the Interpretation
of the Law of Nature; which Interpretation is Authentique;
not because it is his private Sentence; but because he giveth it by
Authority of the Soveraign, whereby it becomes the Soveraigns Sentence;
which is Law for that time, to the parties pleading.</p>

<p>The Sentence Of A Judge, Does Not Bind Him, Or Another
Judge To Give Like Sentence In Like Cases Ever After
But because there is no Judge Subordinate, nor Soveraign, but may
erre in a Judgement of Equity; if afterward in another like case
he find it more consonant to Equity to give a contrary Sentence,
he is obliged to doe it.  No mans error becomes his own Law;
nor obliges him to persist in it.  Neither (for the same reason)
becomes it a Law to other Judges, though sworn to follow it.
For though a wrong Sentence given by authority of the Soveraign,
if he know and allow it, in such Lawes as are mutable, be a
constitution of a new Law, in cases, in which every little
circumstance is the same; yet in Lawes immutable, such as are
the Lawes of Nature, they are no Lawes to the same, or other Judges,
in the like cases for ever after.  Princes succeed one another;
and one Judge passeth, another commeth; nay, Heaven and Earth
shall passe; but not one title of the Law of Nature shall passe;
for it is the Eternall Law of God.  Therefore all the Sentences
of precedent Judges that have ever been, cannot all together make
a Law contrary to naturall Equity: Nor any Examples of former Judges,
can warrant an unreasonable Sentence, or discharge the present Judge
of the trouble of studying what is Equity (in the case he is to Judge,)
from the principles of his own naturall reason.  For example sake,
'Tis against the Law of Nature, To Punish The Innocent; and Innocent
is he that acquitteth himselfe Judicially, and is acknowledged
for Innocent by the Judge.  Put the case now, that a man is accused
of a capitall crime, and seeing the powers and malice of some enemy,
and the frequent corruption and partiality of Judges, runneth away
for feare of the event, and afterwards is taken, and brought to a
legall triall, and maketh it sufficiently appear, he was not guilty
of the crime, and being thereof acquitted, is neverthelesse condemned
to lose his goods; this is a manifest condemnation of the Innocent.
I say therefore, that there is no place in the world, where this
can be an interpretation of a Law of Nature, or be made a Law by
the Sentences of precedent Judges, that had done the same.
For he that judged it first, judged unjustly; and no Injustice
can be a pattern of Judgement to succeeding Judges.  A written Law
may forbid innocent men to fly, and they may be punished for flying:
But that flying for feare of injury, should be taken for presumption
of guilt, after a man is already absolved of the crime Judicially,
is contrary to the nature of a Presumption, which hath no place
after Judgement given.  Yet this is set down by a great Lawyer
for the common Law of England.  &quot;If a man,&quot; saith he, &quot;that is Innocent,
be accused of Felony, and for feare flyeth for the same; albeit he
judicially acquitteth himselfe of the Felony; yet if it be found that
he fled for the Felony, he shall notwithstanding his Innocency,
Forfeit all his goods, chattels, debts, and duties.  For as to the
Forfeiture of them, the Law will admit no proofe against the
Presumption in Law, grounded upon his flight.&quot; Here you see,
An Innocent Man, Judicially Acquitted, Notwithstanding His Innocency,
(when no written Law forbad him to fly) after his acquitall,
Upon A Presumption In Law, condemned to lose all the goods he hath.
If the Law ground upon his flight a Presumption of the fact,
(which was Capitall,) the Sentence ought to have been Capitall:
if the presumption were not of the Fact, for what then ought he
to lose his goods?  This therefore is no Law of England; nor is
the condemnation grounded upon a Presumption of Law, but upon
the Presumption of the Judges.  It is also against Law, to say
that no Proofe shall be admitted against a Presumption of Law.
For all Judges, Soveraign and subordinate, if they refuse to
heare Proofe, refuse to do Justice: for though the Sentence be Just,
yet the Judges that condemn without hearing the Proofes offered,
are Unjust Judges; and their Presumption is but Prejudice;
which no man ought to bring with him to the Seat of Justice,
whatsoever precedent judgements, or examples he shall pretend to follow.
There be other things of this nature, wherein mens Judgements
have been perverted, by trusting to Precedents: but this is enough
to shew, that though the Sentence of the Judge, be a Law to the
party pleading, yet it is no Law to any Judge, that shall succeed
him in that Office.</p>

<p>In like manner, when question is of the Meaning of written Lawes,
he is not the Interpreter of them, that writeth a Commentary upon them.
For Commentaries are commonly more subject to cavill, than the Text;
and therefore need other Commentaries; and so there will be no end
of such Interpretation.  And therefore unlesse there be an Interpreter
authorised by the Soveraign, from which the subordinate Judges
are not to recede, the Interpreter can be no other than the ordinary Judges, in the some manner, as they are in cases of the unwritten Law; and their Sentences are to be taken by them that plead, for Lawes in that particular case; but not to bind other Judges, in like cases to give like judgements.  For a Judge may erre in the Interpretation even of written Lawes; but no errour of a subordinate Judge, can change the Law, which is the generall Sentence of the Soveraigne.</p>

<p>The Difference Between The Letter
And Sentence Of The Law
In written Lawes, men use to make a difference between the Letter,
and the Sentence of the Law: And when by the Letter, is meant
whatsoever can be gathered from the bare words, 'tis well distinguished.
For the significations of almost all words, are either in themselves,
or in the metaphoricall use of them, ambiguous; and may be drawn in
argument, to make many senses; but there is onely one sense of the Law.
But if by the Letter, be meant the Literall sense, then the Letter,
and the Sentence or intention of the Law, is all one.  For the literall
sense is that, which the Legislator is alwayes supposed to be Equity:
For it were a great contumely for a Judge to think otherwise
of the Soveraigne.  He ought therefore, if the Word of the Law
doe not fully authorise a reasonable Sentence, to supply it with
the Law of Nature; or if the case be difficult, to respit Judgement
till he have received more ample authority.  For Example, a written Law
ordaineth, that he which is thrust out of his house by force,
shall be restored by force: It happens that a man by negligence
leaves his house empty, and returning is kept out by force,
in which case there is no speciall Law ordained.  It is evident,
that this case is contained in the same Law: for else there is
no remedy for him at all; which is to be supposed against the
Intention of the Legislator.  Again, the word of the Law,
commandeth to Judge according to the Evidence: A man is accused
falsly of a fact, which the Judge saw himself done by another;
and not by him that is accused.  In this case neither shall the
Letter of the Law be followed to the condemnation of the Innocent,
nor shall the Judge give Sentence against the evidence of the Witnesses;
because the Letter of the Law is to the contrary: but procure
of the Soveraign that another be made Judge, and himselfe Witnesse.
So that the incommodity that follows the bare words of a written Law,
may lead him to the Intention of the Law, whereby to interpret
the same the better; though no Incommodity can warrant a Sentence
against the Law.  For every Judge of Right, and Wrong, is not Judge
of what is Commodious, or Incommodious to the Common-wealth.</p>

<p>The Abilities Required In A Judge
The abilities required in a good Interpreter of the Law, that is
to say, in a good Judge, are not the same with those of an Advocate;
namely the study of the Lawes.  For a Judge, as he ought to take
notice of the Fact, from none but the Witnesses; so also he ought
to take notice of the Law, from nothing but the Statutes,
and Constitutions of the Soveraign, alledged in the pleading,
or declared to him by some that have authority from the Soveraign Power
to declare them; and need not take care before-hand, what hee
shall Judge; for it shall bee given him what hee shall say
concerning the Fact, by Witnesses; and what hee shall say in
point of Law, from those that shall in their pleadings shew it,
and by authority interpret it upon the place.  The Lords of Parlament
in England were Judges, and most difficult causes have been heard
and determined by them; yet few of them were much versed in the
study of the Lawes, and fewer had made profession of them:
and though they consulted with Lawyers, that were appointed to be
present there for that purpose; yet they alone had the authority
of giving Sentence.  In like manner, in the ordinary trialls of Right,
Twelve men of the common People, are the Judges, and give Sentence,
not onely of the Fact, but of the Right; and pronounce simply
for the Complaynant, or for the Defendant; that is to say,
are Judges not onely of the Fact, but also of the Right: and in
a question of crime, not onely determine whether done, or not done;
but also whether it be Murder, Homicide, Felony, Assault, and the like,
which are determinations of Law: but because they are not supposed
to know the Law of themselves, there is one that hath Authority
to enforme them of it, in the particular case they are to Judge of.
But yet if they judge not according to that he tells them,
they are not subject thereby to any penalty; unlesse it be made appear,
they did it against their consciences, or had been corrupted by reward.
The things that make a good Judge, or good Interpreter of the Lawes,
are, first A Right Understanding of that principall Law of Nature
called Equity; which depending not on the reading of other mens
Writings, but on the goodnesse of a mans own naturall Reason,
and Meditation, is presumed to be in those most, that have had
most leisure, and had the most inclination to meditate thereon.
Secondly, Contempt Of Unnecessary Riches, and Preferments.
Thirdly, To Be Able In Judgement To Devest Himselfe Of All Feare,
Anger, Hatred, Love, And Compassion.  Fourthly, and lastly,
Patience To Heare; Diligent Attention In Hearing; And Memory To Retain,
Digest And Apply What He Hath Heard.</p>

<p>Divisions Of Law
The difference and division of the Lawes, has been made in divers
manners, according to the different methods, of those men that
have written of them.  For it is a thing that dependeth not on Nature,
but on the scope of the Writer; and is subservient to every mans
proper method.  In the Institutions of Justinian, we find seven
sorts of Civill Lawes.</p>

<h1 class="hft-headings">1. The Edicts, Constitutions, and Epistles Of The Prince, that is,
of the Emperour; because the whole power of the people was in him.
Like these, are the Proclamations of the Kings of England.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">2. The Decrees Of The Whole People Of Rome (comprehending the Senate,)
when they were put to the Question by the Senate.  These were Lawes,
at first, by the vertue of the Soveraign Power residing in the people;
and such of them as by the Emperours were not abrogated, remained Lawes
by the Authority Imperiall.  For all Lawes that bind, are understood
to be Lawes by his authority that has power to repeale them.
Somewhat like to these Lawes, are the Acts of Parliament in England.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">3. The Decrees Of The Common People (excluding the Senate,)
when they were put to the question by the Tribune of the people.
For such of them as were not abrogated by the Emperours,
remained Lawes by the Authority Imperiall.  Like to these,
were the Orders of the House of Commons in England.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">4. Senatus Consulta, the Orders Of The Senate; because when the people
of Rome grew so numerous, as it was inconvenient to assemble them;
it was thought fit by the Emperour, that men should Consult
the Senate in stead of the people: And these have some resemblance
with the Acts of Counsell.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">5. The Edicts Of Praetors, and (in some Cases) of the Aediles:
such as are the Chiefe Justices in the Courts of England.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">6. Responsa Prudentum; which were the Sentences, and Opinions
of those Lawyers, to whom the Emperour gave Authority to interpret
the Law, and to give answer to such as in matter of Law demanded
their advice; which Answers, the Judges in giving Judgement
were obliged by the Constitutions of the Emperour to observe;
And should be like the Reports of Cases Judged, if other Judges
be by the Law of England bound to observe them.  For the Judges
of the Common Law of England, are not properly Judges, but Juris
Consulti; of whom the Judges, who are either the Lords, or Twelve
men of the Country, are in point of Law to ask advice.</h1>

<h1 class="hft-headings">7. Also, Unwritten Customes, (which in their own nature are
an imitation of Law,) by the tacite consent of the Emperour,
in case they be not contrary to the Law of Nature, are very Lawes.</h1>

<p>Another division of Lawes, is into Naturall and Positive.
Naturall are those which have been Lawes from all Eternity;
and are called not onely Naturall, but also Morall Lawes;
consisting in the Morall Vertues, as Justice, Equity, and all
habits of the mind that conduce to Peace, and Charity; of which
I have already spoken in the fourteenth and fifteenth Chapters.</p>

<p>Positive, are those which have not been for Eternity; but have been
made Lawes by the Will of those that have had the Soveraign Power
over others; and are either written, or made known to men,
by some other argument of the Will of their Legislator.</p>

<p>Another Division Of Law
Again, of Positive Lawes some are Humane, some Divine; And of Humane
positive lawes, some are Distributive, some Penal.  Distributive are
those that determine the Rights of the Subjects, declaring to
every man what it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety
in lands, or goods, and a right or liberty of action; and these speak
to all the Subjects.  Penal are those, which declare, what Penalty
shall be inflicted on those that violate the Law; and speak to
the Ministers and Officers ordained for execution.  For though every one
ought to be informed of the Punishments ordained beforehand for their
transgression; neverthelesse the Command is not addressed to the
Delinquent, (who cannot be supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,)
but to publique Ministers appointed to see the Penalty executed.
And these Penal Lawes are for the most part written together with
the Lawes Distributive; and are sometimes called Judgements.
For all Lawes are generall judgements, or Sentences of the Legislator;
as also every particular Judgement, is a Law to him, whose case is Judged.</p>

<p>Divine Positive Law How Made Known To Be Law
Divine Positive Lawes (for Naturall Lawes being Eternall,
and Universall, are all Divine,) are those, which being the
Commandements of God, (not from all Eternity, nor universally
addressed to all men, but onely to a certain people, or to
certain persons,) are declared for such, by those whom God
hath authorised to declare them.  But this Authority of man
to declare what be these Positive Lawes of God, how can it be known?
God may command a man by a supernaturall way, to deliver Lawes
to other men.  But because it is of the essence of Law, that he
who is to be obliged, be assured of the Authority of him that
declareth it, which we cannot naturally take notice to be from God,
How Can A Man Without Supernaturall Revelation Be Assured Of
The Revelation Received By The Declarer? and How Can He Be Bound
To Obey Them?  For the first question, how a man can be assured
of the Revelation of another, without a Revelation particularly
to himselfe, it is evidently impossible: for though a man may be
induced to believe such Revelation, from the Miracles they see him doe,
or from seeing the Extraordinary sanctity of his life, or from seeing
the Extraordinary wisedome, or Extraordinary felicity of his Actions,
all which are marks of Gods extraordinary favour; yet they are not
assured evidence of speciall Revelation.  Miracles are Marvellous workes:
but that which is marvellous to one, may not be so to another.
Sanctity may be feigned; and the visible felicities of this world,
are most often the work of God by Naturall, and ordinary causes.
And therefore no man can infallibly know by naturall reason,
that another has had a supernaturall revelation of Gods will;
but only a beliefe; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear
greater, or lesser) a firmer, or a weaker belief.</p>

<p>But for the second, how he can be bound to obey them; it is not so hard.
For if the Law declared, be not against the Law of Nature (which is
undoubtedly Gods Law) and he undertake to obey it, he is bound by
his own act; bound I say to obey it, but not bound to believe it:
for mens beliefe, and interiour cogitations, are not subject to the
commands, but only to the operation of God, ordinary, or extraordinary.
Faith of Supernaturall Law, is not a fulfilling, but only an assenting
to the same; and not a duty that we exhibite to God, but a gift
which God freely giveth to whom he pleaseth; as also Unbelief is not
a breach of any of his Lawes; but a rejection of them all,
except the Lawes Naturall.  But this that I say, will be made yet cleerer,
by the Examples, and Testimonies concerning this point in holy Scripture.
The Covenant God made with Abraham (in a Supernaturall Manner) was thus,
(Gen. 17. 10) &quot;This is the Covenant which thou shalt observe between
Me and Thee and thy Seed after thee.&quot;  Abrahams Seed had not this
revelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party to the Covenant,
and bound to obey what Abraham should declare to them for Gods Law;
which they could not be, but in vertue of the obedience they owed
to their Parents; who (if they be Subject to no other earthly power,
as here in the case of Abraham) have Soveraign power over their children,
and servants.  Againe, where God saith to Abraham, &quot;In thee shall
all Nations of the earth be blessed: For I know thou wilt command
thy children, and thy house after thee to keep the way of the Lord,
and to observe Righteousnesse and Judgement,&quot; it is manifest,
the obedience of his Family, who had no Revelation, depended on
their former obligation to obey their Soveraign.  At Mount Sinai
Moses only went up to God; the people were forbidden to approach
on paine of death; yet were they bound to obey all that Moses declared
to them for Gods Law.  Upon what ground, but on this submission
of their own, &quot;Speak thou to us, and we will heare thee; but let not God
speak to us, lest we dye?&quot; By which two places it sufficiently appeareth,
that in a Common-wealth, a subject that has no certain and assured
Revelation particularly to himself concerning the Will of God,
is to obey for such, the Command of the Common-wealth: for if men
were at liberty, to take for Gods Commandements, their own dreams,
and fancies, or the dreams and fancies of private men; scarce two men
would agree upon what is Gods Commandement; and yet in respect of them,
every man would despise the Commandements of the Common-wealth.
I conclude therefore, that in all things not contrary to the Morall Law,
(that is to say, to the Law of Nature,) all Subjects are bound
to obey that for divine Law, which is declared to be so, by the Lawes
of the Common-wealth.  Which also is evident to any mans reason;
for whatsoever is not against the Law of Nature, may be made Law
in the name of them that have the Soveraign power; and there is
no reason men should be the lesse obliged by it, when tis propounded
in the name of God.  Besides, there is no place in the world where men
are permitted to pretend other Commandements of God, than are declared
for such by the Common-wealth.  Christian States punish those that
revolt from Christian Religion, and all other States, those that set up
any Religion by them forbidden.  For in whatsoever is not regulated
by the Common-wealth, tis Equity (which is the Law of Nature,
and therefore an eternall Law of God) that every man equally
enjoy his liberty.</p>

<p>Another Division Of Lawes
There is also another distinction of Laws, into Fundamentall,
and Not Fundamentall: but I could never see in any Author,
what a Fundamentall Law signifieth.  Neverthelesse one may very
reasonably distinguish Laws in that manner.</p>

<p>A Fundamentall Law What
For a Fundamentall Law in every Common-wealth is that, which being
taken away, the Common-wealth faileth, and is utterly dissolved;
as a building whose Foundation is destroyed.  And therefore a
Fundamentall Law is that, by which Subjects are bound to uphold
whatsoever power is given to the Soveraign, whether a Monarch,
or a Soveraign Assembly, without which the Common-wealth cannot stand,
such as is the power of War and Peace, of Judicature, of Election
of Officers, and of doing whatsoever he shall think necessary
for the Publique good.  Not Fundamentall is that the abrogating whereof,
draweth not with it the dissolution of the Common-Wealth; such as are
the Lawes Concerning Controversies between subject and subject.
Thus much of the Division of Lawes.</p>

<p>Difference Between Law And Right
I find the words Lex Civilis, and Jus Civile, that is to say,
Law and Right Civil, promiscuously used for the same thing,
even in the most learned Authors; which neverthelesse ought not to be so.
For Right is Liberty, namely that Liberty which the Civil Law leaves us:
But Civill Law is an Obligation; and takes from us the Liberty which
the Law of Nature gave us.  Nature gave a Right to every man to secure
himselfe by his own strength, and to invade a suspected neighbour,
by way of prevention; but the Civill Law takes away that Liberty,
in all cases where the protection of the Lawe may be safely stayd for.
Insomuch as Lex and Jus, are as different as Obligation and Liberty.</p>

<p>And Between A Law And A Charter
Likewise Lawes and Charters are taken promiscuously for the same thing.
Yet Charters are Donations of the Soveraign; and not Lawes, but
exemptions from Law.  The phrase of a Law is Jubeo, Injungo, I Command,
and Enjoyn: the phrase of a Charter is Dedi, Concessi, I Have Given,
I Have Granted: but what is given or granted, to a man, is not forced
upon him, by a Law.  A Law may be made to bind All the Subjects of
a Common-wealth: a Liberty, or Charter is only to One man,
or some One part of the people.  For to say all the people of
a Common-wealth, have Liberty in any case whatsoever; is to say,
that in such case, there hath been no Law made; or else having
been made, is now abrogated.</p>
