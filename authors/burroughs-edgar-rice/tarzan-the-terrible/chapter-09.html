<p>The entrance through which he caught his first glimpse of the interior
was rather beautifully carved in geometric designs, and within the
walls were similarly treated, though as he proceeded from one apartment
to another he found also the figures of animals, birds, and men taking
their places among the more formal figures of the mural decorator's
art. Stone vessels were much in evidence as well as ornaments of gold
and the skins of many animals, but nowhere did he see an indication of
any woven fabric, indicating that in that respect at least the Ho-don
were still low in the scale of evolution, and yet the proportions and
symmetry of the corridors and apartments bespoke a degree of
civilization.
</p>
<p>The way led through several apartments and long corridors, up at least
three flights of stone stairs and finally out upon a ledge upon the
western side of the building overlooking the blue lake. Along this
ledge, or arcade, his guide led him for a hundred yards, to stop at
last before a wide entrance-way leading into another apartment of the
palace.
</p><p>Here Tarzan beheld a considerable concourse of warriors in an enormous
apartment, the domed ceiling of which was fully fifty feet above the
floor. Almost filling the chamber was a great pyramid ascending in
broad steps well up under the dome in which were a number of round
apertures which let in the light. The steps of the pyramid were
occupied by warriors to the very pinnacle, upon which sat a large,
imposing figure of a man whose golden trappings shone brightly in the
light of the afternoon sun, a shaft of which poured through one of the
tiny apertures of the dome.
</p><p>"Ko-tan!" cried Dak-lot, addressing the resplendent figure at the
pinnacle of the pyramid. "Ko-tan and warriors of Pal-ul-don! Behold the
honor that Jad-ben-Otho has done you in sending as his messenger his
own son," and Dak-lot, stepping aside, indicated Tarzan with a dramatic
sweep of his hand.
</p><p>Ko-tan rose to his feet and every warrior within sight craned his neck
to have a better view of the newcomer. Those upon the opposite side of
the pyramid crowded to the front as the words of the old warrior
reached them. Skeptical were the expressions on most of the faces; but
theirs was a skepticism marked with caution. No matter which way
fortune jumped they wished to be upon the right side of the fence. For
a moment all eyes were centered upon Tarzan and then gradually they
drifted to Ko-tan, for from his attitude would they receive the cue
that would determine theirs. But Ko-tan was evidently in the same
quandary as they--the very attitude of his body indicated it--it was
one of indecision and of doubt.
</p><p>The ape-man stood erect, his arms folded upon his broad breast, an
expression of haughty disdain upon his handsome face; but to Dak-lot
there seemed to be indications also of growing anger. The situation was
becoming strained. Dak-lot fidgeted, casting apprehensive glances at
Tarzan and appealing ones at Ko-tan. The silence of the tomb wrapped
the great chamber of the throneroom of Pal-ul-don.
</p><p>At last Ko-tan spoke. "Who says that he is Dor-ul-Otho?" he asked,
casting a terrible look at Dak-lot.
</p><p>"He does!" almost shouted that terrified noble.
</p><p>"And so it must be true?" queried Ko-tan.
</p><p>Could it be that there was a trace of irony in the chief's tone? Otho
forbid! Dak-lot cast a side glance at Tarzan--a glance that he intended
should carry the assurance of his own faith; but that succeeded only in
impressing the ape-man with the other's pitiable terror.
</p><p>"O Ko-tan!" pleaded Dak-lot, "your own eyes must convince you that
indeed he is the son of Otho. Behold his godlike figure, his hands, and
his feet, that are not as ours, and that he is entirely tailless as is
his mighty father."
</p><p>Ko-tan appeared to be perceiving these facts for the first time and
there was an indication that his skepticism was faltering. At that
moment a young warrior who had pushed his way forward from the opposite
side of the pyramid to where he could obtain a good look at Tarzan
raised his voice.
</p><p>"Ko-tan," he cried, "it must be even as Dak-lot says, for I am sure now
that I have seen Dor-ul-Otho before. Yesterday as we were returning
with the Kor-ul-lul prisoners we beheld him seated upon the back of a
great GRYF. We hid in the woods before he came too near, but I saw
enough to make sure that he who rode upon the great beast was none
other than the messenger who stands here now."
</p><p>This evidence seemed to be quite enough to convince the majority of the
warriors that they indeed stood in the presence of deity--their faces
showed it only too plainly, and a sudden modesty that caused them to
shrink behind their neighbors. As their neighbors were attempting to do
the same thing, the result was a sudden melting away of those who stood
nearest the ape-man, until the steps of the pyramid directly before him
lay vacant to the very apex and to Ko-tan. The latter, possibly
influenced as much by the fearful attitude of his followers as by the
evidence adduced, now altered his tone and his manner in such a degree
as might comport with the requirements if the stranger was indeed the
Dor-ul-Otho while leaving his dignity a loophole of escape should it
appear that he had entertained an impostor.
</p><p>"If indeed you are the Dor-ul-Otho," he said, addressing Tarzan, "you
will know that our doubts were but natural since we have received no
sign from Jad-ben-Otho that he intended honoring us so greatly, nor how
could we know, even, that the Great God had a son? If you are he, all
Pal-ul-don rejoices to honor you; if you are not he, swift and terrible
shall be the punishment of your temerity. I, Ko-tan, King of
Pal-ul-don, have spoken."
</p><p>"And spoken well, as a king should speak," said Tarzan, breaking his
long silence, "who fears and honors the god of his people. It is well
that you insist that I indeed be the Dor-ul-Otho before you accord me
the homage that is my due. Jad-ben-Otho charged me specially to
ascertain if you were fit to rule his people. My first experience of
you indicates that Jad-ben-Otho chose well when he breathed the spirit
of a king into the babe at your mother's breast."
</p><p>The effect of this statement, made so casually, was marked in the
expressions and excited whispers of the now awe-struck assemblage. At
last they knew how kings were made! It was decided by Jad-ben-Otho
while the candidate was still a suckling babe!  Wonderful! A miracle!
and this divine creature in whose presence they stood knew all about
it. Doubtless he even discussed such matters with their god daily. If
there had been an atheist among them before, or an agnostic, there was
none now, for had they not looked with their own eyes upon the son of
god?
</p><p>"It is well then," continued the ape-man, "that you should assure
yourself that I am no impostor. Come closer that you may see that I am
not as are men. Furthermore it is not meet that you stand upon a higher
level than the son of your god." There was a sudden scramble to reach
the floor of the throne-room, nor was Ko-tan far behind his warriors,
though he managed to maintain a certain majestic dignity as he
descended the broad stairs that countless naked feet had polished to a
gleaming smoothness through the ages. "And now," said Tarzan as the
king stood before him, "you can have no doubt that I am not of the same
race as you. Your priests have told you that Jad-ben-Otho is tailless.
Tailless, therefore, must be the race of gods that spring from his
loins.  But enough of such proofs as these! You know the power of
Jad-ben-Otho; how his lightnings gleaming out of the sky carry death as
he wills it; how the rains come at his bidding, and the fruits and the
berries and the grains, the grasses, the trees and the flowers spring
to life at his divine direction; you have witnessed birth and death,
and those who honor their god honor him because he controls these
things. How would it fare then with an impostor who claimed to be the
son of this all-powerful god?  This then is all the proof that you
require, for as he would strike you down should you deny me, so would
he strike down one who wrongfully claimed kinship with him."
</p><p>This line of argument being unanswerable must needs be convincing.
There could be no questioning of this creature's statements without the
tacit admission of lack of faith in the omnipotence of Jad-ben-Otho.
Ko-tan was satisfied that he was entertaining deity, but as to just
what form his entertainment should take he was rather at a loss to
know. His conception of god had been rather a vague and hazy affair,
though in common with all primitive people his god was a personal one
as were his devils and demons. The pleasures of Jad-ben-Otho he had
assumed to be the excesses which he himself enjoyed, but devoid of any
unpleasant reaction. It therefore occurred to him that the Dor-ul-Otho
would be greatly entertained by eating--eating large quantities of
everything that Ko-tan liked best and that he had found most injurious;
and there was also a drink that the women of the Ho-don made by
allowing corn to soak in the juices of succulent fruits, to which they
had added certain other ingredients best known to themselves. Ko-tan
knew by experience that a single draught of this potent liquor would
bring happiness and surcease from worry, while several would cause even
a king to do things and enjoy things that he would never even think of
doing or enjoying while not under the magical influence of the potion,
but unfortunately the next morning brought suffering in direct ratio to
the joy of the preceding day. A god, Ko-tan reasoned, could experience
all the pleasure without the headache, but for the immediate present he
must think of the necessary dignities and honors to be accorded his
immortal guest.
</p><p>No foot other than a king's had touched the surface of the apex of the
pyramid in the throneroom at A-lur during all the forgotten ages
through which the kings of Pal-ul-don had ruled from its high eminence.
So what higher honor could Ko-tan offer than to give place beside him
to the Dor-ul-Otho? And so he invited Tarzan to ascend the pyramid and
take his place upon the stone bench that topped it. As they reached the
step below the sacred pinnacle Ko-tan continued as though to mount to
his throne, but Tarzan laid a detaining hand upon his arm.
</p><p>"None may sit upon a level with the gods," he admonished, stepping
confidently up and seating himself upon the throne. The abashed Ko-tan
showed his embarrassment, an embarrassment he feared to voice lest he
incur the wrath of the king of kings.
</p><p>"But," added Tarzan, "a god may honor his faithful servant by inviting
him to a place at his side. Come, Ko-tan; thus would I honor you in the
name of Jad-ben-Otho."
</p><p>The ape-man's policy had for its basis an attempt not only to arouse
the fearful respect of Ko-tan but to do it without making of him an
enemy at heart, for he did not know how strong a hold the religion of
the Ho-don had upon them, for since the time that he had prevented
Ta-den and Om-at from quarreling over a religious difference the
subject had been utterly taboo among them. He was therefore quick to
note the evident though wordless resentment of Ko-tan at the suggestion
that he entirely relinquish his throne to his guest. On the whole,
however, the effect had been satisfactory as he could see from the
renewed evidence of awe upon the faces of the warriors.
</p><p>At Tarzan's direction the business of the court continued where it had
been interrupted by his advent. It consisted principally in the
settling of disputes between warriors. There was present one who stood
upon the step just below the throne and which Tarzan was to learn was
the place reserved for the higher chiefs of the allied tribes which
made up Ko-tan's kingdom. The one who attracted Tarzan's attention was
a stalwart warrior of powerful physique and massive, lion-like
features. He was addressing Ko-tan on a question that is as old as
government and that will continue in unabated importance until man
ceases to exist. It had to do with a boundary dispute with one of his
neighbors.
</p><p>The matter itself held little or no interest for Tarzan, but he was
impressed by the appearance of the speaker and when Ko-tan addressed
him as Ja-don the ape-man's interest was permanently crystallized, for
Ja-don was the father of Ta-den. That the knowledge would benefit him
in any way seemed rather a remote possibility since he could not reveal
to Ja-don his friendly relations with his son without admitting the
falsity of his claims to godship.
</p><p>When the affairs of the audience were concluded Ko-tan suggested that
the son of Jad-ben-Otho might wish to visit the temple in which were
performed the religious rites coincident to the worship of the Great
God. And so the ape-man was conducted by the king himself, followed by
the warriors of his court, through the corridors of the palace toward
the northern end of the group of buildings within the royal enclosure.
</p><p>The temple itself was really a part of the palace and similar in
architecture. There were several ceremonial places of varying sizes,
the purposes of which Tarzan could only conjecture. Each had an altar
in the west end and another in the east and were oval in shape, their
longest diameter lying due east and west.  Each was excavated from the
summit of a small hillock and all were without roofs. The western
altars invariably were a single block of stone the top of which was
hollowed into an oblong basin. Those at the eastern ends were similar
blocks of stone with flat tops and these latter, unlike those at the
opposite ends of the ovals were invariably stained or painted a reddish
brown, nor did Tarzan need to examine them closely to be assured of
what his keen nostrils already had told him--that the brown stains were
dried and drying human blood.
</p><p>Below these temple courts were corridors and apartments reaching far
into the bowels of the hills, dim, gloomy passages that Tarzan glimpsed
as he was led from place to place on his tour of inspection of the
temple. A messenger had been dispatched by Ko-tan to announce the
coming visit of the son of Jad-ben-Otho with the result that they were
accompanied through the temple by a considerable procession of priests
whose distinguishing mark of profession seemed to consist in grotesque
headdresses; sometimes hideous faces carved from wood and entirely
concealing the countenances of their wearers, or again, the head of a
wild beast cunningly fitted over the head of a man. The high priest
alone wore no such head-dress. He was an old man with close-set,
cunning eyes and a cruel, thin-lipped mouth.
</p><p>At first sight of him Tarzan realized that here lay the greatest danger
to his ruse, for he saw at a glance that the man was antagonistic
toward him and his pretensions, and he knew too that doubtless of all
the people of Pal-ul-don the high priest was most likely to harbor the
truest estimate of Jad-ben-Otho, and, therefore, would look with
suspicion on one who claimed to be the son of a fabulous god.
</p><p>No matter what suspicion lurked within his crafty mind, Lu-don, the
high priest of A-lur, did not openly question Tarzan's right to the
title of Dor-ul-Otho, and it may be that he was restrained by the same
doubts which had originally restrained Ko-tan and his warriors--the
doubt that is at the bottom of the minds of all blasphemers even and
which is based upon the fear that after all there may be a god. So, for
the time being at least Lu-don played safe. Yet Tarzan knew as well as
though the man had spoken aloud his inmost thoughts that it was in the
heart of the high priest to tear the veil from his imposture.
</p><p>At the entrance to the temple Ko-tan had relinquished the guidance of
the guest to Lu-don and now the latter led Tarzan through those
portions of the temple that he wished him to see.  He showed him the
great room where the votive offerings were kept, gifts from the
barbaric chiefs of Pal-ul-don and from their followers. These things
ranged in value from presents of dried fruits to massive vessels of
beaten gold, so that in the great main storeroom and its connecting
chambers and corridors was an accumulation of wealth that amazed even
the eyes of the owner of the secret of the treasure vaults of Opar.
</p><p>Moving to and fro throughout the temple were sleek black Waz-don
slaves, fruits of the Ho-don raids upon the villages of their less
civilized neighbors. As they passed the barred entrance to a dim
corridor, Tarzan saw within a great company of pithecanthropi of all
ages and of both sexes, Ho-don as well as Waz-don, the majority of them
squatted upon the stone floor in attitudes of utter dejection while
some paced back and forth, their features stamped with the despair of
utter hopelessness.
</p><p>"And who are these who lie here thus unhappily?" he asked of Lu-don. It
was the first question that he had put to the high priest since
entering the temple, and instantly he regretted that he had asked it,
for Lu-don turned upon him a face upon which the expression of
suspicion was but thinly veiled.
</p><p>"Who should know better than the son of Jad-ben-Otho?" he retorted.
</p><p>"The questions of Dor-ul-Otho are not with impunity answered with other
questions," said the ape-man quietly, "and it may interest Lu-don, the
high priest, to know that the blood of a false priest upon the altar of
his temple is not displeasing in the eyes of Jad-ben-Otho."
</p><p>Lu-don paled as he answered Tarzan's question. "They are the offerings
whose blood must refresh the eastern altars as the sun returns to your
father at the day's end."
</p><p>"And who told you," asked Tarzan, "that Jad-ben-Otho was pleased that
his people were slain upon his altars? What if you were mistaken?"
</p><p>"Then countless thousands have died in vain," replied Lu-don.
</p><p>Ko-tan and the surrounding warriors and priests were listening
attentively to the dialogue. Some of the poor victims behind the barred
gateway had heard and rising, pressed close to the barrier through
which one was conducted just before sunset each day, never to return.
</p><p>"Liberate them!" cried Tarzan with a wave of his hand toward the
imprisoned victims of a cruel superstition, "for I can tell you in the
name of Jad-ben-Otho that you are mistaken."
