<p>The four years of stupendous war came to an end. The sun of the
Southern Confederacy went down in gloom and defeat behind the
hills of Appomattox, never to rise again, and blessed peace brooded
over a reunited nation, which shall endure through the coming
ages to the end of time.</p>

<p>It was only the faint echoes of the mighty struggle that, faintly
reverberating across prairie and mountain, reached the little
mining settlement nestling among the solitudes of the Sierras.
Vose Adams made more frequent journeys to Sacramento, in order
to gather news of the terrific events, which were making history
at an appalling rate. Upon his return, the miners gathered round
Parson Brush, or some other one with a good voice, who stood up,
with every eye centred on him and every ear keyed to the highest
point and they listened with breathless interest until the thrilling
story was read through to the end.</p>

<p>The same diversity of sentiment that appeared at first continued
to the last, but the parson's earnest words and his insistence
that no quarrels should take place among the neighbors prevented
any outbreak, though more than once the point was perilously near.</p>

<p>"If your sympathies are with the Union or with the South," he
said impressively, "there is nothing to prevent your taking up
arms, but it must be on the battle field and not here."</p>

<p>And this wise counsel prevailed. Now and then some ardent partisan
shouldered his rifle, bade his friends a hasty good-by and hurried
away. One by one, they went until the new recruits numbered five.
Thus the population of New Constantinople dwindled to about one-half,
and retaining its exclusive tastes, permitted no new comers to
join them, so that the boom which in its early days was so confidently
looked for sank to zero and vanished. In truth it looked as if
New Constantinople was doomed to die of dry rot.</p>

<p>Strange news came now and then from the men who had gone to the
war. Maurice Dawson wrote often to his daughter Nellie, whose
letters, it can well be understood were the bright spots in his
life of adventure and danger. She had improved wonderfully under
the careful tuition of Parson Brush, who, gaining experience,
as he saw the brightness of her mind, found his work of the most
pleasant nature conceivable. She displayed a thirst for knowledge
and made advances which astonished him. The books needed for her
instruction were procured by Vose Adams in Sacramento, and she
valued such presents more than anything else. The teacher declared
many a time, with a certain pride, that she put him upon his mettle
to make clear the abstruse problems with which he wrestled when
in college.</p>

<p>"How she will surprise the boys and her father when they come
back," reflected the parson; "it won't take her much longer to
reach the point beyond which I cannot lead her."</p>

<p>To her friends who remained, the growth and improvement of the
girl were astonishing. Probably no one of her sex ever gave nature
itself a better chance to show what she can do with a healthy
frame, when untrammeled by the fashions and requirements of modern
usages. Her lithe, comely figure was perfect. She never knew an
hour's illness. The cheeks had the rose tint of health, the eyes
were clear, the teeth perfect and her spirits buoyant. As one
of the men expressed it, she was like a burst of sunshine in the
settlement.</p>

<p>But Parson Brush was thoughtful. He saw that she was crossing
the line into young womanhood, and that her own interests demanded
that she should go out into the world of which he had told her
so much; that she should meet those of her own sex and learn the
mysteries of her own being. The affection of her friends could
not make up for this lack. It cost the honest fellow many a pang
when he thought of this, but his consolation lay in the inevitable
conclusion that nothing could be done until the return of her
parent or until his wishes were made known.</p>

<p>"If it so happens that he shall fall in battle, then a grave
problem must be met. It will not do for her to remain here; I
will talk it over with the others and we shall make some arrangement
for her good," and with this conclusion he was content to await
the issue of events.</p>

<p>Occasionally the parson received a letter from the father. The
missives were models in their way, telling of his experiences
in the service of the battles, of the prospect of victory and
his faith in the final triumph of the great struggle. He thanked
the teacher for his interest in his child and assured him that
his kindness would never be forgotten by father or daughter.</p>

<p>Vose Adams continued his frequent journeys to Sacramento, for
those were stirring times and he was as anxious as his friends
for news. Always on his return he was met by Nellie some distance
down the winding trail, and, as soon as she was in sight, he held
up the plump letter for which she yearned, and over which she
was made happy beyond expression, and he never failed to carry
back with him the reply of the child, who knew how much it cheered
the brave soldier in the distant East and South fighting the battles
of his country.</p>

<p>For two years and more there was not a break in this correspondence.
Dawson must have been a good soldier, for, though he enlisted
as a private, he was soon promoted, and before the close of the
two years, was a full fledged captain, with the brevet of major.
It was about this time that one of his letters gave the story
of Gettysburg. In the hell-blast of Pickett's charge two of his
old friends, who had left New Constantinople to fight for the
South, were riddled, and another, marching at the captain's side,
had his head blown off by an exploding shell. Thus in one engagement
three of the old residents of the mining settlement were wiped
out.</p>

<p>Only once or twice was any news received of Al Bidwell. It was
known that Ruggles was with the Army of Northern Virginia, but
no tidings came of Budge Isham and Ike Hoe. The continued silence
was accepted as almost certain proof of their death, and yet both
were well and unharmed.</p>

<p>One day in early summer, two sunburned, shaggy men rode down
the mountain side and drew up their horses in front of the Heavenly
Bower. They had ridden from the East and had come through many
hardships and dangers. One of them wore a partial uniform of blue,
while the other was of a faded, butternut tinge. The two had been
engaged for years in trying to slay each other, inclusive of their
respective friends, but failing in the effort, gave it up when
the final surrender took place at Appomattox. Both were from New
Constantinople, and they now turned their faces in that direction.
Starting from widely separated points their lines of travel converged
and finally joined. When they met, there was a moment of mutual
sharp scrutiny, then an exclamation of delight, a fervent handclasp
and a moistening of the eyes, as both exclaimed:</p>

<p>"God bless you, old boy! There's no one in the world I would
rather meet than you! Shake again!"</p>

<p>And they did, and henceforward they followed the same trail and
"drank from the same canteen." They shared their rations with
each other, and in the regions of the West, where danger lurked
in the air, one watched while the other slept, ready to interpose
his body as a shield between peril and his comrade.</p>

<p>And what splendid soldiers the Civil War made! How those veterans
could fight! What pluck, what coolness, what nerve, what daring
they displayed! There was one stormy night beyond the Mississippi,
when a band of jayhawkers, believing the two men carried a few
hundred dollars, formed a plan for shooting both for the sake
of the plunder. There were six of the outlaws at the opening of
proceedings, but at the close just half the number was left, and
one of them carried away a wound with him, from which he could
never recover, while the defenders did not receive a scratch.</p>

<p>"When I heard that rebel yell of yours," remarked the veteran
who wore the blue, "it tingled through my veins as it did at Chancellorsville,
Antietam and various other scenes of unpleasantness. I couldn't
help sailing in."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to let out the yawp," returned his companion,
"but when the shooting began, it was so like old times I couldn't
help it. It was real enjoyable."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the dry response, "but rather more so for us than
for the other fellows."</p>

<p>Three days later a band of Indians concluded to try their hand
upon the veterans, but the trouble was that the red men could
not get a fair chance. Before they arrived within effective striking
distance, the veterans began shooting, and whenever they shot
somebody fell. The thing became so monotonous that the hostiles
gave it up in disgust and drew off. Thenceforward the old soldiers
had comparatively an easy time of it.</p>

<p>And so, after a ride of more than two thousand miles on horseback,
these two men entered Dead Man's Gulch and drew rein in front
of the Heavenly Bower. Their coming caused a sensation, for their
looks showed they were veterans of the war and were certain to
bring important news. The couple smiled and whispered to each
other, for they saw that no one suspected their identity.</p>

<p>Among the wondering group that gathered round was Nellie Dawson.
She was profoundly interested, for Vose Adams had made two journeys
to and from Sacramento without bringing a letter from her father.
Doubtless these men could tell her something, and she stood on
the edge of the group, waiting for them to speak and for the opportunity
to question them.</p>

<p>"Do you see her?" whispered one of the men.</p>

<p>"Yes; gracious! hasn't she grown? Why, she was a little girl
when we left and now she's a young woman."</p>

<p>"Blessed if she isn't! She wears such long dresses that you can
see only the tiny toes of her shoes; we've obsarved a good many
purty women since we left these parts, but nothing that could
come up to her."</p>

<p>"You can bet your life! She hasn't any idee of who we are, nor
have the boys, but it looks to me as if the parson is a little
suspicious."</p>

<p>Although the patronage of the Heavenly Bower had shrunk a good
deal, Landlord Ortigies was as genial and hospitable as ever.
The new arrivals had time only for a few secret comments, when
he came forward:</p>

<p>"Strangers, you're welcome to the best we have, which isn't anything
to boast of; look as if you had rid a good many miles and you
must be as tired and thirsty as your animals. If you'll turn 'em
over to Vose Adams, he'll 'tend to them, and, if you'll allow
me, you shall have a good meal, which before the same, I beg to
tender you some distilled home brewed Mountain Dew."</p>

<p>Thanking the landlord for his offer, the men dismounted and waited
outside, while he brought forth two glasses, half-filled with
the fiery stuff of the poetical name. One of the men took his
and eagerly swallowed it. The other held his aloft, where under
the bright sunlight it glowed crimson like blood. With his hand
motionless for a moment, he slowly inverted the glass and allowed
the liquid to run out on the ground.</p>

<p>"Max, I reckon you haven't forgot when I done something like
that some four years ago," said the man, turning toward the astonished
host.</p>
