<p>It must not be supposed that all of Kiddie Katydid's family made the
same neverending din at night. Actually it was only the gentlemen that
so amused themselves. No doubt the ladies, too, knew the secret about
the mysterious Katy--and what she did.
</p>
<p>But for some reason they never, never mentioned the matter. Even when
they gossiped among themselves, as they sometimes did, they never
touched upon that subject.
</p><p>Furthermore, in the daytime Kiddie and his fellows were as quiet as they
could be. Having waked the echoes all night long, they were content,
when morning came, to rest silently among the trees and shrubs. And a
very good reason did they have, too, for such a habit. During the day
there were altogether too many birds flying about, to please the
Katydids. And Kiddie often remarked in a joking way that the only birds
he cared about were those that <u>didn't care about him</u>!
</p><p>Of course, there were a few birds that prowled about Pleasant Valley
after dark. Mr. Nighthawk was one of that crew of nightly wanderers. And
whenever the word was passed around that he had been seen in the
neighborhood, Kiddie Katydid tried to lower his solemn chant, because he
knew that Mr. Nighthawk was usually in search of something to eat.
</p><p>Now, when Kiddie Katydid felt hungry he drove away his gnawing pangs by
browsing upon leaves and tender twigs. But Mr. Nighthawk had no taste
for such fodder.
</p><p>He had an appetite for insects. And between dusk and dawn a good many of
Kiddie Katydid's neighbors of one kind or another found their way into
Mr. Nighthawk's tummy.
</p><p>So you see it was no wonder that Kiddie was not eager to attract the
attention of that night rover. Some of the more timid of Kiddie's
companions even begged him, at times, to hush. They said he was making
such a noise that Mr. Nighthawk would be sure to hear it, even if he
were a quarter of a mile away.
</p><p>But Kiddie Katydid usually laughed at those faint-hearted ones; and
often he shrilled his <u>Katy did, Katy did</u>, more loudly than before,
just to show them that he was not afraid.
</p><p>"A person has to take a few chances," he remarked one day. "If we were
all afraid to make a sound it would be pretty hard on Katy, for then she
would have nobody to take her part. And what would people think of her?"
</p><p>Evidently Kiddie's reason was a good one, because a number of his
cousins spoke up at once and said that they agreed with him perfectly.
</p><p>But their sisters all exclaimed that sooner or later Mr. Nighthawk would
hear them; and then there would certainly be trouble.
</p><p>Strangely enough, the words were scarcely out of their mouths before
they heard a loud call that struck them cold with fear.
</p><p>_Peent! Peent!_ The cry came out of the air above them without the least
warning. And everybody--including Kiddie Katydid--knew that Mr.
Nighthawk had come.
