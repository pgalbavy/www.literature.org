               They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--<br />
               They roused him with mustard and cress--<br />
               They roused him with jam and judicious advice--<br />
               They set him conundrums to guess.
          <P>
               When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br />
               His sad story he offered to tell;<br />
               And the Bellman cried "Silence! Not even a shriek!"<br />
               And excitedly tingled his bell.
          <P>
               There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,<br />
               Scarcely even a howl or a groan,<br />
               As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe<br />
               In an antediluvian tone.
          <P>
               "My father and mother were honest, though poor--"<br />
               "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.<br />
               "If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--<br />
               We have hardly a minute to waste!"
          <P>
               "I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,<br />
               "And proceed without further remark<br />
               To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br />
               To help you in hunting the Snark.
          <P>
               "A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br />
               Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"<br />
               "Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,<br />
               As he angrily tingled his bell.
          <P>
               "He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,<br />
               " 'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:<br />
               Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,<br />
               And it's handy for striking a light.
          <P>
               " 'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;<br />
               You may hunt it with forks and hope;<br />
               You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
               You may charm it with smiles and soap--' "
          <P>
               ("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold<br />
               In a hasty parenthesis cried,<br />
               "That's exactly the way I have always been told<br />
               That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")
          <P>
               " 'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br />
               If your Snark be a Boojum! For then<br />
               You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<br />
               And never be met with again!'
          <P>
               "It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br />
               When I think of my uncle's last words:<br />
               And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br />
               Brimming over with quivering curds!
          <P>
               "It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!"<br />
               The Bellman indignantly said.<br />
               And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.<br />
               It is this, it is this that I dread!
          <P>
               "I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--<br />
               In a dreamy delirious fight:<br />
               I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br />
               And I use it for striking a light:
          <P>
               "But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<br />
               In a moment (of this I am sure),<br />
               I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--<br />
               And the notion I cannot endure!"
