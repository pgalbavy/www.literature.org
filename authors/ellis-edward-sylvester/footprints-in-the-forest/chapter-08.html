<p>None could know better the length of time it is possible for
a person to live under water than did the Pawnees who lined the
shore of the stream from which they awaited the young Shawanoe
to rise and surrender himself.</p>

<p>At such times the seconds seem long, but in due time they grew
into minutes, until one, two, three, four, and fully five had
gone by, and still nothing was seen of the Shawanoe, who, they
were assured, had leaped into the river. Before this, the warriors
looked wonderingly at each other, unable to guess what it could
all mean.</p>

<p>Had he bounded across the creek? Wide as it was, the possibility
had been considered from the first, and, when the seconds were
well along, the leader called to those on the other side to examine
the margin for the imprints of the Indian's moccasins. Striking
with such force, the dents would be in sight from across the stream.
As it was easy to identify the spot where he made the leap, it
was equally easy to determine the precise point where the telltale
footprints should appear.</p>

<p>But the minute scrutiny of the edge of the creek proved that
no moccasin had touched it. And that being the case, the question
came back as to what had become of the fugitive.</p>

<p>"The dog of a Shawanoe is at the bottom," was the natural remark
of the leader. "He has gone down, and the Great Spirit is so angry
with him that he will not permit him to rise."</p>

<p>That was a curious explanation of the occurrence, but it appeared
to be about the only one left to the pursuers, who were not fully
satisfied even with that. We are aware that a person who springs
into the water, even if he can not swim a stroke, is pretty sure
to come up once or twice. The Pawnees knew of a verity that the
Shawanoe must be an excellent swimmer, and it certainly was inexplainable
if he did not reappear.</p>

<p>"Did he leave the shore?" asked one of those who had approached
from the side toward which Deerfoot had sped.</p>

<p>"We saw him run for it as runs the deer," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But the Shawanoe is like the weasel; he may have turned aside
and sped up or down the stream, with his head bent so low that
he could not be seen."</p>

<p>"The eyes of Wimmoroo were open," said the leader, who, in spite
of his assurance, began to feel suspicious that some trick had
been played upon them, though, as yet, he could not define its
nature.</p>

<p>"What did the eyes of Wimmoroo tell him?" asked the other, showing
a Yankee-like persistency in his questions.</p>

<p>"They showed him the dog of a Shawanoe, as he bounded high in
air and strove to reach the other shore."</p>

<p>"Can Wimmoroo make sure the Shawanoe did not leap in the air
and then place his feet on the ground where they were before?"</p>

<p>Could it be possible that such a strategy had been used? He began
an examination, two of his warriors helping him. There were the
footprints of the delicate moccasins in plain sight, showing where
he had leaped clear from the ground, but not the faintest impression
was visible either to the right or left of the spot. Inasmuch
as the fugitive could not have fled in either direction without
leaving a trail, and the closest search failed to show any thing
of the kind, the conclusion was inevitable that no such flight
had taken place.</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;how came Wimmoroo to forget it?&mdash;all caught the splash
of the body as it dropped in the water. As might be expected witnesses
were not wanting to declare they had seen the spray fly upward,
and had caught sight of the eagle feathers in the crown of Deerfoot
as he swam for the other side.</p>

<p>All which being so, the question came back again where could
Deerfoot be?</p>

<p>It is not often that a group of red men are so at their wit's
end as were the Pawnees. They stood looking about them, silent
and bewildered. Wimmoroo took a sly glance at the tree tops as
though he half expected to see the missing Shawanoe perched in
the branches.</p>

<p>But among those red men was one at least with quick intelligence.
He was the last to approach the stream from the side toward which
Deerfoot leaped. He had not yet spoken, but when told the facts,
he glanced here and there, so as to take in all the points, and
it was not long before a suspicion of the truth dawned upon him.</p>

<p>Several facts, which were patent to the others, took connection
in his mind. Let me name one or two &mdash;Deerfoot possessed
a fleetness which no Pawnee could equal; he was seen to run toward
the stream with the utmost speed of which he was capable; he was
observed to make the jump, and the creek itself was a little more
than twenty feet in width. The conclusion, therefore, was certain&mdash;he
had bounded across.</p>

<p>The leap, while a great one, was not beyond the attainment of
the Pawnee himself, who was studying the question. He was sure
that with a running start he could clear the water, though he
could do no more. Still there were no footprints on the margin
that could have been made by the fugitive; but, recalling the
prodigious activity of the fugitive, the Pawnee scrutinized the
ground further back. He had done so only a half minute when he
discovered the truth. Making it known to the others, they refused
for a minute or two to believe him, but the proof was before their
eyes and they disputed no longer.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe, finding that his only escape from the Pawnees,
who seemed to spring from the ground all around him, was by placing
himself on the other side the creek, turned and made for it, as
I have already told, with all the speed he possessed. The stream
was of a width varying from twenty to forty feet or more. Where
he had crossed it before, it was too wide for him to think of
leaping. In fact, his hasty search along shore failed to show
a spot across which he could jump, and he did not expect to do
so in the present instance.</p>

<p>But the extremity of good fortune attended the fleet-footed Deerfoot,
who struck one of the narrowest portions. He anticipated falling
into the water, quite close to the other side, whence he meant
to crawl hastily out and continue his flight. Gathering his muscles,
he made one of the most terrific efforts of his life, and, rising
in air, described a parabola, which carried him fully six feet
past the water, striking the ground beyond a clump of bushes.
There, as I have said, when the search was made, his footprints
were seen too plainly to leave any doubt as to the exploit he
had performed.</p>

<p>At the instant of alighting, he whirled around, stepped close
to the water, and struck it a sharp blow with his long bow. It
was his quickness of resource which led him to do this without
a second's delay. Well aware of the great leap he had made, he
caused the splash, so as to lead his pursuers to think he had
dropped into the current. It has been shown how he succeeded.</p>

<p>Crouching low, so as to keep his body hidden so far as it was
possible to do so, he ran along the stream, sometimes almost on
his hands and knees, until a point was reached where he was able
to straighten up without detection. His keen vision showed him
the Pawnees advancing from the side on which he had taken refuge,
but he easily avoided discovery, and had not far to go, when he
felt that all danger was over.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that, from the moment when he entered the
Pawnee camp and fell into a dispute with Lone Bear, he had been
given little time to rest. It may be said that the sweep of incident
kept him on the jump, from the opening to the close. He was given
no time to think of Hay-uta nor of Jack Carleton, from whom he
was separated by still another stream of water, across which he
was forced to swim, in order to reach the war party. He had done
his utmost to gather some information respecting Otto Relstaub,
for whom the three were searching, but had not picked up the first
grain of knowledge. Lone Bear, who could have told him one or
two surprising facts respecting the young German lad, sought to
mislead him. What his reason was for such a course was beyond
the power of Deerfoot to guess.</p>

<p>It can not be said that the Shawanoe felt any misgivings as to
the situation of the two who had come with him. The Sauk was skillful,
and would be quick to learn the peril in which the young warrior
had become involved. Such knowledge would enable him to guard
against similar slips himself.</p>

<p>Convinced that at last he had shaken off his enemies, Deerfoot
resumed his moderate pace, while he debated with himself the best
course to pursue.</p>

<p>He was back again on the side of the stream where he had first
seen the Pawnees encamped, and doubtless a number of them were
scattered at different points through the wood. There must have
been twenty of them in the neighborhood, for, when summoned by
signal, they appeared to come from all points of the compass.
But none now was in sight, and who of them all was able to outwit
the Shawanoe in woodcraft and cunning?</p>

<p>The clothing which had been saturated by his plunge into the
larger stream was nearly dry, and an examination showed he had
suffered no damage in person or property. More than one bullet
had been fired at him, but not a hair of his head was harmed.
The stained eagle feathers still projected from his crown; the
quiver of arrows rested behind his right shoulder; the string
of his bow was free from moisture; the red sash around his waist,
the fringes of his hunting shirt, his leggings, his moccasins
and even the double string of beads around his neck and the golden
bracelet which clasped one wrist, showed no evidence of the ordeal
through which their owner had so recently passed. Knife, tomahawk
and bow were as ready as ever for any emergency which might call
for them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot reflected that, so far as he was concerned, the result
of his enterprise was a failure&mdash;in truth, it was worse than a
failure, for, having learned nothing of the fate of Otto, he had
put the Pawnees on their guard against giving such information.
Lone Bear showed an unwillingness to tell any thing, and now it
was to be expected that he and his companions would take care
to thwart the wishes of the Shawanoe and what friends he might
have.</p>

<p>The young warrior asked himself whether he must recross the stream
and join Jack Carleton with the confession that he had not been
able to learn any thing about Otto, and that he saw no chance
of doing so. He was loth to make such acknowledgment, and he determined
not to do so, until after making at least one more attempt to
force the truth from some member of the war party.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced when he appeared in the camp
of the hostiles, and it would seem that the incidents which took
place ought to have carried him close to nightfall. But I must
repeat that on account of their hurricane-like rush, they took
a small amount of time, and now, when he found himself free of
his pursuers, the sun was yet a couple of hours above the horizon.
Enough daylight remained for him to do a large amount of work,
always provided the work presented itself to be done.</p>

<p>He decided to take another survey of the camp before returning,
in the hope that possibly some "material" for labor awaited him.
A quick survey of his surroundings caused him to locate himself.
The camp was not far off, and he began making his way toward it.</p>

<p>In doing so he did not steal forward with the slow caution which
his race generally show when approaching an enemy, but he advanced
briskly among the trees, though his motion was as noiseless as
that of the shadow of the cloud overhead.</p>
