"Anne Shirley to Philippa Gordon, greeting.
<P>
"Well-beloved, it's high time I was writing you.  Here am I,
installed once more as a country `schoolma'am' at Valley Road,
boarding at `Wayside,' the home of Miss Janet Sweet.  Janet is a
dear soul and very nicelooking; tall, but not over-tall; stoutish,
yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty
soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of
avoirdupois.  She has a knot of soft, crimpy, brown hair with
a thread of gray in it, a sunny face with rosy cheeks, and big,
kind eyes as blue as forget-me-nots.  Moreover, she is one of those
delightful, old-fashioned cooks who don't care a bit if they ruin
your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things.
<P>
"I like her; and she likes me -- principally, it seems, because
she had a sister named Anne who died young.
<P>
"`I'm real glad to see you,' she said briskly, when I landed in her yard.
`My, you don't look a mite like I expected.  I was sure you'd be dark --
my sister Anne was dark.  And here you're redheaded!'
<P>
"For a few minutes I thought I wasn't going to like Janet as much
as I had expected at first sight.  Then I reminded myself that I
really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any
one simply because she called my hair red.  Probably the word
`auburn' was not in Janet's vocabulary at all.
<P>
"`Wayside' is a dear sort of little spot.  The house is small
and white, set down in a delightful little hollow that drops
away from the road.  Between road and house is an orchard and
flower-garden all mixed up together.  The front door walk is
bordered with quahog clam-shells -- `cow-hawks,' Janet calls them;
there is Virginia Creeper over the porch and moss on the roof.
My room is a neat little spot `off the parlor' -- just big
enough for the bed and me.  Over the head of my bed there is a
picture of Robby Burns standing at Highland Mary's grave,
shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree.  Robby's face is
so lugubrious that it is no wonder I have bad dreams.  Why, the
first night I was here I dreamed I COULDN'T LAUGH.
<P>
"The parlor is tiny and neat.  Its one window is so shaded by a
huge willow that the room has a grotto-like effect of emerald gloom.
There are wonderful tidies on the chairs, and gay mats on the floor,
and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table, and vases
of dried grass on the mantel-piece.  Between the vases is a cheerful
decoration of preserved coffin plates -- five in all, pertaining
respectively to Janet's father and mother, a brother, her sister Anne,
and a hired man who died here once!  If I go suddenly insane some of
these days `know all men by these presents' that those coffin-plates
have caused it.
<P>
"But it's all delightful and I said so.  Janet loved me for it,
just as she detested poor Esther because Esther had said so much
shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed.
Now, I glory in feather-beds, and the more unhygienic and feathery
they are the more I glory.  Janet says it is such a comfort to see
me eat; she had been so afraid I would be like Miss Haythorne, who
wouldn't eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried
to make Janet give up frying things.  Esther is really a dear girl,
but she is rather given to fads.  The trouble is that she hasn't
enough imagination and HAS a tendency to indigestion.
<P>
"Janet told me I could have the use of the parlor when any young
men called!  I don't think there are many to call.  I haven't
seen a young man in Valley Road yet, except the next-door
hired boy -- Sam Toliver, a very tall, lank, tow-haired youth.
He came over one evening recently and sat for an hour on the
garden fence, near the front porch where Janet and I were doing
fancy-work.  The only remarks he volunteered in all that time
were, `Hev a peppermint, miss!  Dew now-fine thing for carARRH,
peppermints,' and, `Powerful lot o' jump-grasses round here
ternight.  Yep.'
<P>
"But there is a love affair going on here.  It seems to be my
fortune to be mixed up, more or less actively, with elderly love
affairs.  Mr. and Mrs. Irving always say that I brought about
their marriage.  Mrs. Stephen Clark of Carmody persists in being
most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would
probably have made if I hadn't.  I do really think, though, that
Ludovic Speed would never have got any further along than placid
courtship if I had not helped him and Theodora Dix out.
<P>
"In the present affair I am only a passive spectator.  I've tried
once to help things along and made an awful mess of it.  So I
shall not meddle again.  I'll tell you all about it when we meet."
