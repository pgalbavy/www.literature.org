<p>The light and heat fell upon the settlement, the clearings, and
the river as if flung down by an angry hand. The land lay silent,
still, and brilliant under the avalanche of burning rays that
had destroyed all sound and all motion, had buried all shadows,
had choked every breath. No living thing dared to affront the
serenity of this cloudless sky, dared to revolt against the oppression
of this glorious and cruel sunshine. Strength and resolution,
body and mind alike were helpless, and tried to hide before the
rush of the fire from heaven. Only the frail butterflies, the
fearless children of the sun, the capricious tyrants of the flowers,
fluttered audaciously in the open, and their minute shadows hovered
in swarms over the drooping blossoms, ran lightly on the withering
grass, or glided on the dry and cracked earth. No voice was heard
in this hot noontide but the faint murmur of the river that hurried
on in swirls and eddies, its sparkling wavelets chasing each other
in their joyous course to the sheltering depths, to the cool refuge
of the sea.</p>

<p>Almayer had dismissed his workmen for the midday rest, and, his
little daughter on his shoulder, ran quickly across the courtyard,
making for the shade of the verandah of his house. He laid the
sleepy child on the seat of the big rocking-chair, on a pillow
which he took out of his own hammock, and stood for a while looking
down at her with tender and pensive eyes. The child, tired and
hot, moved uneasily, sighed, and looked up at him with the veiled
look of sleepy fatigue. He picked up from the floor a broken palm-leaf
fan, and began fanning gently the flushed little face. Her eyelids
fluttered and Almayer smiled. A responsive smile brightened for
a second her heavy eyes, broke with a dimple the soft outline
of her cheek; then the eyelids dropped suddenly, she drew a long
breath through the parted lips&mdash;and was in a deep sleep before
the fleeting smile could vanish from her face.</p>

<p>Almayer moved lightly off, took one of the wooden armchairs,
and placing it close to the balustrade of the verandah sat down
with a sigh of relief. He spread his elbows on the top rail and
resting his chin on his clasped hands looked absently at the river,
at the dance of sunlight on the flowing water. Gradually the forest
of the further bank became smaller, as if sinking below the level
of the river. The outlines wavered, grew thin, dissolved in the
air. Before his eyes there was now only a space of undulating
blue&mdash;one big, empty sky growing dark at times. . . . Where was
the sunshine? . . . He felt soothed and happy, as if some gentle
and invisible hand had removed from his soul the burden of his
body. In another second he seemed to float out into a cool brightness
where there was no such thing as memory or pain. Delicious. His
eyes closed&mdash;opened&mdash;closed again.</p>

<p>"Almayer!"</p>

<p>With a sudden jerk of his whole body he sat up, grasping the
front rail with both his hands, and blinked stupidly.</p>

<p>"What? What’s that?" he muttered, looking round vaguely.</p>

<p>"Here! Down here, Almayer."</p>

<p>Half rising in his chair, Almayer looked over the rail at the
foot of the verandah, and fell back with a low whistle of astonishment.</p>

<p>"A ghost, by heavens!" he exclaimed softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me?" went on the husky voice from the courtyard.
"May I come up, Almayer?"</p>

<p>Almayer stood up and leaned over the rail. "Don’t you dare,"
he said, in a voice subdued but distinct. "Don’t you dare! The
child sleeps here. And I don’t want to hear you&mdash;or speak to you
either."</p>

<p>"You must listen to me! It’s something important."</p>

<p>"Not to me, surely."</p>

<p>"Yes! To you. Very important."</p>

<p>"You were always a humbug," said Almayer, after a short silence,
in an indulgent tone. "Always! I remember the old days. Some fellows
used to say there was no one like you for smartness&mdash;but you never
took me in. Not quite. I never quite believed in you, Mr. Willems."</p>

<p>"I admit your superior intelligence," retorted Willems, with
scornful impatience, from below. "Listening to me would be a further
proof of it. You will be sorry if you don’t."</p>

<p>"Oh, you funny fellow!" said Almayer, banteringly. "Well, come
up. Don’t make a noise, but come up. You’ll catch a sunstroke
down there and die on my doorstep perhaps. I don’t want any tragedy
here. Come on!"</p>

<p>Before he finished speaking Willems’ head appeared above the
level of the floor, then his shoulders rose gradually and he stood
at last before Almayer&mdash;a masquerading spectre of the once so
very confidential clerk of the richest merchant in the islands.
His jacket was soiled and torn; below the waist he was clothed
in a worn-out and faded sarong. He flung off his hat, uncovering
his long, tangled hair that stuck in wisps on his perspiring forehead
and straggled over his eyes, which glittered deep down in the
sockets like the last sparks amongst the black embers of a burnt-out
fire. An unclean beard grew out of the caverns of his sunburnt
cheeks. The hand he put out towards Almayer was very unsteady.
The once firm mouth had the tell-tale droop of mental suffering
and physical exhaustion. He was barefooted. Almayer surveyed him
with leisurely composure.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said at last, without taking the extended hand which
dropped slowly along Willems’ body.</p>

<p>"I am come," began Willems.</p>

<p>"So I see," interrupted Almayer. "You might have spared me this
treat without making me unhappy. You have been away five weeks,
if I am not mistaken. I got on very well without you&mdash;and now
you are here you are not pretty to look at."</p>

<p>"Let me speak, will you!" exclaimed Willems.</p>

<p>"Don’t shout like this. Do you think yourself in the forest with
your . . . your friends? This is a civilized man’s house. A white
man’s. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I am come," began Willems again; "I am come for your good and
mine."</p>

<p>"You look as if you had come for a good feed," chimed in the
irrepressible Almayer, while Willems waved his hand in a discouraged
gesture. "Don’t they give you enough to eat," went on Almayer,
in a tone of easy banter, "those&mdash;what am I to call them&mdash;those
new relations of yours? That old blind scoundrel must be delighted
with your company. You know, he was the greatest thief and murderer
of those seas. Say! do you exchange confidences? Tell me, Willems,
did you kill somebody in Macassar or did you only steal something?"</p>

<p>"It is not true!" exclaimed Willems, hotly. "I only borrowed.
. . . They all lied! I . . ."</p>

<p>"Sh-sh!" hissed Almayer, warningly, with a look at the sleeping
child. "So you did steal," he went on, with repressed exultation.
"I thought there was something of the kind. And now, here, you
steal again."</p>

<p>For the first time Willems raised his eyes to Almayer’s face.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t mean from me. I haven’t missed anything," said Almayer,
with mocking haste. "But that girl. Hey! You stole her. You did
not pay the old fellow. She is no good to him now, is she?"</p>

<p>"Stop that. Almayer!"</p>

<p>Something in Willems’ tone caused Almayer to pause. He looked
narrowly at the man before him, and could not help being shocked
at his appearance.</p>

<p>"Almayer," went on Willems, "listen to me. If you are a human
being you will. I suffer horribly&mdash;and for your sake."</p>

<p>Almayer lifted his eyebrows. "Indeed! How? But you are raving,"
he added, negligently.</p>

<p>"Ah! You don’t know," whispered Willems. "She is gone. Gone,"
he repeated, with tears in his voice, "gone two days ago."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the surprised Almayer. "Gone! I haven’t heard
that news yet." He burst into a subdued laugh. "How funny! Had
enough of you already? You know it’s not flattering for you, my
superior countryman."</p>

<p>Willems&mdash;as if not hearing him&mdash;leaned against one of the columns
of the roof and looked over the river. "At first," he whispered,
dreamily, "my life was like a vision of heaven&mdash;or hell; I didn’t
know which. Since she went I know what perdition means; what darkness
is. I know what it is to be torn to pieces alive. That’s how I
feel."</p>

<p>"You may come and live with me again," said Almayer, coldly.
"After all, Lingard&mdash;whom I call my father and respect as such&mdash;left
you under my care. You pleased yourself by going away. Very good.
Now you want to come back. Be it so. I am no friend of yours.
I act for Captain Lingard."</p>

<p>"Come back?" repeated Willems, passionately. "Come back to you
and abandon her? Do you think I am mad? Without her! Man! what
are you made of? To think that she moves, lives, breathes out
of my sight. I am jealous of the wind that fans her, of the air
she breathes, of the earth that receives the caress of her foot,
of the sun that looks at her now while I . . . I haven’t seen
her for two days&mdash;two days."</p>

<p>The intensity of Willems’ feeling moved Almayer somewhat, but
he affected to yawn elaborately, "You do bore me," he muttered.
"Why don’t you go after her instead of coming here?"</p>

<p>"Why indeed?"</p>

<p>"Don’t you know where she is? She can’t be very far. No native
craft has left this river for the last fortnight."</p>

<p>"No! not very far&mdash;and I will tell you where she is. She is in
Lakamba’s campong." And Willems fixed his eyes steadily on Almayer’s
face.</p>

<p>"Phew! Patalolo never sent to let me know. Strange," said Almayer,
thoughtfully. "Are you afraid of that lot?" he added, after a
short pause.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>afraid!"</p>

<p>"Then is it the care of your dignity which prevents you from
following her there, my high-minded friend?" asked Almayer, with
mock solicitude. "How noble of you!"</p>

<p>There was a short silence; then Willems said, quietly, "You are
a fool. I should like to kick you."</p>

<p>"No fear," answered Almayer, carelessly; "you are too weak for
that. You look starved."</p>

<p>"I don’t think I have eaten anything for the last two days; perhaps
more &mdash;I don’t remember. It does not matter. I am full of
live embers,"  said Willems, gloomily. "Look!" and he bared an
arm covered with fresh scars. "I have been biting myself to forget
in that pain the fire that hurts me there!" He struck his breast
violently with his fist, reeled under his own blow, fell into
a chair that stood near and closed his eyes slowly.</p>

<p>"Disgusting exhibition," said Almayer, loftily. "What could father
ever see in you? You are as estimable as a heap of garbage."</p>

<p>"You talk like that! You, who sold your soul for a few guilders," 
muttered Willems, wearily, without opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Not so few," said Almayer, with instinctive readiness, and stopped
confused for a moment. He recovered himself quickly, however,
and went on: "But you&mdash;you have thrown yours away for nothing;
flung it under the feet of a damned savage woman who has made
you already the thing you are, and will kill you very soon, one
way or another, with her love or with her hate. You spoke just
now about guilders. You meant Lingard’s money, I suppose. Well,
whatever I have sold, and for whatever price, I never meant you&mdash;you
of all people&mdash;to spoil my bargain. I feel pretty safe though.
Even father, even Captain Lingard, would not touch you now with
a pair of tongs; not with a ten-foot pole. . . ."</p>

<p>He spoke excitedly, all in one breath, and, ceasing suddenly,
glared at Willems and breathed hard through his nose in sulky
resentment. Willems looked at him steadily for a moment, then
got up.</p>

<p>"Almayer," he said resolutely, "I want to become a trader in
this place."</p>

<p>Almayer shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes. And you shall set me up. I want a house and trade goods&mdash;perhaps
a little money. I ask you for it."</p>

<p>"Anything else you want? Perhaps this coat?" and here Almayer
unbuttoned his jacket&mdash;"or my house&mdash;or my boots?"</p>

<p>"After all it’s natural," went on Willems, without paying any
attention to Almayer&mdash;"it’s natural that she should expect the
advantages which . . . and then I could shut up that old wretch
and then . . ."</p>

<p>He paused, his face brightened with the soft light of dreamy
enthusiasm, and he turned his eyes upwards. With his gaunt figure
and dilapidated appearance he looked like some ascetic dweller
in a wilderness, finding the reward of a self-denying life in
a vision of dazzling glory. He went on in an impassioned murmur&mdash;</p>

<p>"And then I would have her all to myself away from her people&mdash;all
to myself&mdash;under my own influence&mdash;to fashion&mdash;to mould&mdash;to adore&mdash;to
soften&mdash;to . . . Oh! Delight! And then&mdash;then go away to some distant
place where, far from all she knew, I would be all the world to
her! All the world to her!"</p>

<p>His face changed suddenly. His eyes wandered for awhile and then
became steady all at once.</p>

<p>"I would repay every cent, of course," he said, in a business-like
tone, with something of his old assurance, of his old belief in
himself, in it. "Every cent. I need not interfere with your business.
I shall cut out the small native traders. I have ideas&mdash;but never
mind that now. And Captain Lingard would approve, I feel sure.
After all it’s a loan, and I shall be at hand. Safe thing for
you."</p>

<p>"Ah! Captain Lingard would approve! He would app . . ." Almayer
choked. The notion of Lingard doing something for Willems enraged
him. His face was purple. He spluttered insulting words. Willems
looked at him coolly.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Almayer," he said, gently, "that I have good grounds
for my demand."</p>

<p>"Your cursed impudence!"</p>

<p>"Believe me, Almayer, your position here is not so safe as you
may think. An unscrupulous rival here would destroy your trade
in a year. It would be ruin. Now Lingard’s long absence gives
courage to certain individuals. You know? &mdash;I have heard
much lately. They made proposals to me . . . You are very much
alone here. Even Patalolo . . ."</p>

<p>"Damn Patalolo! I am master in this place."</p>

<p>"But, Almayer, don’t you see . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. I see a mysterious ass," interrupted Almayer, violently.
"What is the meaning of your veiled threats? Don’t you think I
know something also? They have been intriguing for years&mdash;and
nothing has happened. The Arabs have been hanging about outside
this river for years&mdash;and I am still the only trader here; the
master here. Do you bring me a declaration of war? Then it’s from
yourself only. I know all my other enemies. I ought to knock you
on the head. You are not worth powder and shot though. You ought
to be destroyed with a stick&mdash;like a snake."</p>

<p>Almayer’s voice woke up the little girl, who sat up on the pillow
with a sharp cry. He rushed over to the chair, caught up the child
in his arms, walked back blindly, stumbled against Willems’ hat
which lay on the floor, and kicked it furiously down the steps.</p>

<p>"Clear out of this! Clear out!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Willems made an attempt to speak, but Almayer howled him down.</p>

<p>"Take yourself off! Don’t you see you frighten the child&mdash;you
scarecrow! No, no! dear," he went on to his little daughter, soothingly,
while Willems walked down the steps slowly. "No. Don’t cry. See!
Bad man going away. Look! He is afraid of your papa. Nasty, bad
man. Never come back again. He shall live in the woods and never
come near my little girl. If he comes papa will kill him&mdash;so!"
He struck his fist on the rail of the balustrade to show how he
would kill Willems, and, perching the consoled child on his shoulder
held her with one hand, while he pointed toward the retreating
figure of his visitor.</p>

<p>"Look how he runs away, dearest," he said, coaxingly. "Isn’t
he funny. Call ‘pig’ after him, dearest. Call after him."</p>

<p>The seriousness of her face vanished into dimples. Under the
long eyelashes, glistening with recent tears, her big eyes sparkled
and danced with fun. She took firm hold of Almayer’s hair with
one hand, while she waved the other joyously and called out with
all her might, in a clear note, soft and distinct like the pipe
of a bird:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pig! Pig! Pig!"</p>
