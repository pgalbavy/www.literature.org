<p><em>PEOPLE </em>used to say of the two Oliphant brothers that
Harlan Oliphant looked as if he lived in the Oliphants’ house,
but Dan didn’t. This was a poor sort of information to any one
who had never seen the house, but of course the supposition was
that everybody had seen it and was familiar with its significance.
It stood in a great, fine yard, in that row of great, fine yards
at the upper end of National Avenue, before the avenue swung off
obliquely and changed its name to Amberson Boulevard. The houses
in the long row were such houses as are built no more; bricklayers
worked for a dollar a day and the workman’s day was ten hours
long when National Avenue grew into its glory. Those houses were
of a big-walled solidity to withstand time, fire, and tornado,
but they found another assailant not to be resisted by anything:
this conqueror, called Progress, being the growth of the city.
Until the growth came they were indomitable and fit for the centuries.</p>

<p>Moreover, they were of a dignified spaciousness not now to be
accomplished except by millionaires with wives content to spend
their days getting new servants. The New Yorker, admitted to these
interiors upon a visit westward, discovered an amplitude with
which he had little familiarity at home, where the brownstone
fronts and squeezed apartments showed him no such suites of big
rooms; for, of all the million people in New York, only a dozen
families could have houses comparable in size or stateliness.
"Stately" was the word, though here some little care must be taken,
of course, with an eye to those who will not admit that anything
short of Blenheim or the Luxembourg is stately. The stateliness
of the Oliphants’ house was precisely the point in that popular
discrimination between the two young men who lived there: Harlan
Oliphant, like the house, was supposed to partake of this high
quality, but stateliness was the last thing any one ever thought
of in connection with Dan.</p>

<p>The youth of the brothers, in the happy and comfortable nineties
of the last century, is well remembered in their city, where the
Christmas holidays could never be thought really begun till the
two Oliphants had arrived from college and their broad-shouldered,
long-tailed coats and incredibly high white collars were seen
officially moving in the figures of a cotillion. They usually
arrived on the same day, though often not by the same train; but
this was the mark of no disagreement or avoidance of each other,
yet bore some significance upon the difference between them. It
was the fashion to say of them that never were two brothers so
alike yet so unlike; and although both were tall, with blue eyes,
brown hair, and features of pleasant contour decisively outlined
in what is called a family likeness, people who knew them well
found it a satisfying and insoluble puzzle that they were the
offspring of the same father and mother.</p>

<p>The contrast appeared in childhood and was manifest to even the
casual onlooker when Dan Oliphant was eleven or twelve years old
and Harlan ten or eleven. At that age Harlan was already an aristocrat,
and, what is more remarkable, kept himself always immaculate.
If his collar rumpled or was soiled he went immediately to his
room and got a fresh one; he washed his hands three or four times
a day without parental suggestion and he brushed his hair almost
every time he washed his hands. He was fastidious in his choice
of companions, had no taste for chance acquaintances, and on a
school holiday could most frequently be found in the library at
home, reading a book beyond his years. The lively Daniel, on the
contrary, disported himself about the neighbourhood—or about other
neighbourhoods, for that matter—in whatever society offered him
any prospect of gayety. He played marbles "for keeps" with ragtag
and bobtail on every vacant lot in town; he never washed his hands
or face, or brushed his hair, except upon repeated command, yet
loved water well enough to "run off swimming" and dive through
a film of ice upon an early Saturday in March. He regaled himself
with horseplay up and down the alleys and had long talks with
negro coachmen in their stables, acquiring strange wisdom of them;
he learned how to swear with some intricacy, how to smoke almost
anything not fireproof, how to "inhale," how to gamble with implements
more sophisticated than marbles, and how to keep all these accomplishments
from the knowledge of his parents. He kept them from Harlan’s
knowledge, also, though not out of any fear that Harlan would
"tell."</p>

<p>At some time in their early childhood the brothers had made the
discovery that they were uncongenial. This is not to say that
they were unamiable together, but that they had assumed a relation
not wholly unknown among brothers. They spoke to each other when
it was necessary; but usually, if they happened to find themselves
together, they were silent, each apparently unconscious of the
other’s presence. Sometimes, though rarely, they had a short argument,
seldom upon a subject of great importance; and only once did a
difference between them attain the dimensions of a quarrel.</p>

<p>This was on a summer day of feverish temperature, and the heat
may have had something to do with the emotion displayed by young
Daniel, then aged twelve. He was engaged, that afternoon, with
a business friend, Master Sam Kohn, and they were importantly
busy in a latticed summer-house, an ornament of the commodious
lawn. They had entered into a partnership for the sale of "Fancy
Brackets and Fittings," which they manufactured out of old cigar
boxes, with the aid of glue, a jig-saw, and blue paint. The computed
profits were already enormous, though no sales had been attempted,
since the glue was slow to harden on such a hot day; and the partners
worked diligently, glad to shed their perspiration for the steadily
increasing means to obtain riches.</p>

<p>At five o’clock Harlan dropped lightly from the big stone-trimmed
bay window of the library, crossed the lawn, where the grass was
being gilded now by the westering sun, and halted before the entrance
of the summer-house. He was the picture of a cool young gentleman,
perfect in white linen; his coat and trousers of this pleasant
material were unflawed by wrinkle or stain; his patent-leather
pumps, unmarred by the slightest crack, glittered among the short
green blades of grass; his small black satin tie was as smooth
as his brown hair.</p>

<p>To this perfection the busy partners within the summer-house
were a sufficient contrast. Soiled blue upon every available surface,
they continued their labours, paying no visible attention to the
cold-eyed young observer, but consulting each other perhaps the
more importantly because of the presence of an audience, however
skeptical. Master Kohn, swarthy, bow-legged, and somewhat undersized
for his thirteen years, was in fact pleased to be associated with
the superior Harlan, even so tenuously. He was pleased, also,
to be a partner of Dan’s, though this was no great distinction,
because Dan, as the boys’ world knew, would willingly be friendly
(or even intimate) with anybody, and consequently no social advancement
was to be obtained through him. That commodity is to be had of
only those who decline to deal in it, and thus Sam Kohn felt that
he was becoming imbued with a certain amount of superiority because
Harlan Oliphant had come to look on at the work.</p>

<p>Sam decided to make a suggestion. "Look at your brother," he
said to Dan. "Maybe he’d like to git into our partnership. We
could give him a share, if he starts in fresh and works hard."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" Harlan said with cold sarcasm, and addressed his brother:
"Do you know what time it is and what the family is supposed to
do this evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dan answered, not looking up from his jig-saw. "We’re
goin’ to dinner at grandma Savage’s."</p>

<p>"Mother sent me to tell you it’s time for you to come in and
wash yourself and dress up," said Harlan. "The mess you’ve got
yourself in, it’ll take you till after six o’clock, and we’re
supposed to be there then."</p>

<p>"Sam and I got some pretty important jobs to finish," Dan returned
carelessly. "I got plenty time to change my clo’es and get washed
up."</p>

<p>"No, you haven’t. You quit playing with that boy and those dirty
things and go in the house."</p>

<p>Upon this, Dan stopped the operation of the jig-saw and looked
at his brother in a puzzled way. "What you mean callin’ our brackets
and fittin’s ‘dirty things?’" he inquired. "I expect you don’t
hardly realize Sam Kohn and I got a regular factory here, Harlan."</p>

<p>"A ‘factory,’ is it?" said Harlan, and laughed in the manner
of a contemptuous adult. "Well, you close up your old factory
and come in the house and get ready."</p>

<p>"I can’t for a while," Dan returned, beginning his work with
the jig-saw again. "I told you we got lots to do before we quit
to-night."</p>

<p>"You stop playing with that silly little saw," Harlan said sharply,
for he had begun to feel some irritation. "You come in the house
right this instant."</p>

<p>"No; I can’t yet, Harlan. Sam and I got to——"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Harlan interrupted. "You come in the house and
let this boy go home."</p>

<p>There was a frosty sharpness in his way of saying "let this boy
go home" that caused Dan to stop his work again and stare at his
brother challengingly. "Here!" he exclaimed. "This is as much
my father and mother’s yard as it is yours, and you got no business
hintin’ at any friend of mine to go home."</p>

<p>"Haven’t I?" Harlan inquired, adopting a light mockery. "So this
is a friend of yours, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"Oh, a <em>friend</em>?" Harlan mocked. "Oh, <em>excuse</em>
me! I didn’t understand!"</p>

<p>This proved to be intolerably provocative;—Dan abandoned the
jig-saw and stepped out of the summer-house to confront his brother
frowningly. "You shut up, Harlan Oliphant," he said. "This is
Sam Kohn’s and my factory, and he’s got a right here. You quit
your talkin’ so much around here."</p>

<p>"You quit your own talking," Harlan retorted. "You do what mother
sent me to tell you to, and let that dirty little Jew go home!"</p>

<p>"What?" Dan cried.</p>

<p>"You better!" Harlan said, standing his ground, though Dan lifted
his hand threateningly. "We don’t want any dirty little Jews on
our premises."</p>

<p>Dan gulped. "It isn’t his fault he’s a Jew. You take that back!"</p>

<p>"I won’t," said Harlan. "He <em>is</em> little and he <em>is</em>
dirty and he’s a Jew. How you going to deny it?"</p>

<p>Flushed with anger and greatly perplexed, Dan glanced over his
shoulder at Master Kohn, who looked on with an inscrutable expression.
"Well, what if I can’t?" Dan said desperately, after this glance
at his guest and partner. "You got no right to insult him."</p>

<p>"It isn’t an insult if it’s true, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is; and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I got a
notion—I got a notion——"</p>

<p>"What notion have you got?" Harlan asked scornfully, as his brother
paused, swallowing heavily.</p>

<p>"I got a notion to make you ashamed!"</p>

<p>"How would you do it?"</p>

<p>"‘How?’ I’ll show you how!" And again Dan’s clenched right hand
lowered threateningly. The brothers stood eye to eye, and both
faces were red.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Harlan. "Hit me!"</p>

<p>Dan’s fist, like his expression, wavered for a moment, then he
said: "Well, I wish you weren’t my brother; but you are, and I
won’t hit you."</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn’t," Harlan retorted, turning toward the
house. "I guess I’ll have to tell mother you won’t wash yourself
and dress until she comes and sends this dirty little Jew out
of our yard."</p>

<p>Thus, having discovered the tender spot in his opponent’s sensibilities,
he avenged himself for the threat, and went on. His brother moved
impulsively, as if to follow and punish, but Mrs. Oliphant had
long ago impressed her sons heavily with the story of Cain and
Abel, and he halted, while Harlan went on coolly and disappeared
into the house by a side entrance.</p>

<p>"Doggone you!" Dan muttered; then turned back to the factory,
where Master Kohn, his head down and his hands in his pockets,
was scuffing sawdust meditatively with the soles of his shoes.
Dan likewise scuffed sawdust for a time.</p>

<p>"Well," Sam Kohn said finally, "I guess I better go on home before
your mamma comes to turn me out."</p>

<p>"I don’t guess she would," Dan said, not looking at him, but
keeping his gaze upon his own scuffing shoe. "She’s got a good
deal o’ politeness about her, and I don’t guess she would. You
got a right to stay here long as you want, Sammy. It’s half your
factory."</p>

<p>"Not if your family puts me out, it ain’t."</p>

<p>"He had no business to call you that, Sammy."</p>

<p>"To call me which?"</p>

<p>"A—a Jew," said Dan, still keeping his eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Why, I am a Jew."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe; but——" Dan paused uncomfortably, then continued:
"Well, he didn’t have any right to call you one."</p>

<p>"Yes, he had," Sam returned, to his friend’s surprise. "He could
call me a Jew just the same I could call you English."</p>

<p>"English? I’m not English."</p>

<p>"Well, you’re <em>from</em> English."</p>

<p>"No," Dan protested mildly. "Not for a couple o’ hundred years,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain’t from Jews a couple thousand years, maybe."</p>

<p>"But I’m full-blooded American," said Dan.</p>

<p>"So’m I," Sam insisted. "You’re American from English, and I’m
American from Jews. He’s got a right to call me a Jew."</p>

<p>Dan stared at him incredulously. "Don’t you mind it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam admitted, "I do when he says it for a insult. He’s
got a right to call me a Jew, but he hasn’t got no right to call
me a Jew for a insult."</p>

<p>"Well, he did," Dan remarked gloomily. "He meant it the way you
might call somebody ‘Irish’ or ‘Dutchy’ or ‘Nigger.’"</p>

<p>"I know it. He called me dirty and little, too. Well, I am little,
but I ain’t no dirtier than what you are, Dan, and you’re his
own brother."</p>

<p>"Well, then, you oughtn’t to mind his callin’ you dirty, Sam."</p>

<p>"He wouldn’t call you dirty the same way he would me," Sam returned
shrewdly; and then, after a momentary pause, he sighed and turned
to go.</p>

<p>But that sigh of his, which had in it the quality of patience,
strongly affected Dan’s sympathies, for a reason he could not
have explained. "Don’t go, Sammy," he said. "You don’t have to
go just because he——"</p>

<p>"Yeh, I better," Sam said, not looking back, but continuing to
move toward the distant gate. "I better go before your mamma comes
to put me out."</p>

<p>Dan protested again, but Sam shook his head and went on across
the lawn, his hands in his pockets, his head down. The high iron
fence, painted white, culminated in an elaborate gateway, and,
when Sam passed out to the sidewalk there, the iron gateposts
rose far above him. Plodding out between these high white posts,
the shabby little figure did not lack pathos; nor was pathos absent
from it as it went doggedly down the street in the thinning gold
of the late afternoon sunshine. Sam looked back not once; but
Dan watched him until he was out of sight, then returned to the
interior of the summer-house, sat down, and stared broodingly
at the littered floor. The floor was not what he saw, however,
for his actual eyes were without vision just then, and it was
his mind’s eye that was busy. It dwelt upon the picture of the
exiled Sam Kohn departing forlornly, and the longer it thus dwelt
the warmer and more threatening grew a painful feeling that seemed
to locate itself in Dan’s upper chest, not far below his collar
bone.</p>

<p>This feeling remained there while he dressed; and it was still
there when he sat down at his grandmother’s table for dinner.
In fact, it so increased in poignancy that he could not eat with
his customary heartiness; and his lack of appetite, though he
made play with seemingly busy fork and spoon to cover it, fell
under the sharp eye of the lady at the head of the table. She
was a handsome, dominant old woman, with high colour in her cheeks
at seventy-eight, and thick hair, darker than it was gray, under
her lace cap. She sat straight upright in her stiff chair, for
she detested easy-chairs and had never in all her life lounged
in one or sat with her knees crossed; such things were done not
by ladies, but by hoodlums, she said. Her husband, a gentle, submissive
old man, was frail and bent with his years, though they had brought
him great worldly prosperity; and the grandchildren of this couple
never spoke of the house as "Grandpa Savage’s," but always as
"Grandma Savage’s," an intuitive discrimination that revealed
the rulership. Mrs. Savage ruled by means of a talent she had
for destructive criticism, which several times prevented her optimistic
husband from venturing into ruin, and had established her as the
voice of wisdom.</p>

<p>"Daniel," she said presently;—"you’re not eating."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, grandma."</p>

<p>"No. Ever since you came to the table, you’ve been sitting there
with your head bent down like that and moving your hands to pretend
you’re eating, but not eating. What’s the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothin’," he muttered, not lifting his head. "I’m all right."</p>

<p>"Adelaide," Mrs. Savage said to his mother;—"has his appetite
been failing lately?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, mamma," Mrs. Oliphant answered. She was a pretty woman,
quietly cheerful and little given to alarms or anxieties. "Not
seriously," she added, smiling. "He did very well at lunch, at
least."</p>

<p>"He looks sickish," said Mrs. Savage grimly. "He looks as if
he were beginning a serious illness. Well people don’t sit with
their heads down like that. What is the matter with you, Daniel?"</p>

<p>"Nothin’," he said. "I told you I’m all right."</p>

<p>"He isn’t though," Mrs. Savage insisted, addressing the others.
"Do you know what’s the matter with him, Harlan?"</p>

<p>"Too much glue, I expect."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Too much glue," Harlan repeated. "He was playing with a lot
of nasty glue and paint all afternoon, and I expect the smell’s
made him sick. Too much glue and too much Jew."</p>

<p>"Jew?" his grandmother inquired. "What do you mean by ‘too much
Jew,’ Harlan?"</p>

<p>"He had a dirty little bow-legged Jew playing with him."</p>

<p>"See here!" Dan said huskily, but he did not look up. "You be
careful!"</p>

<p>"Careful of what?" Harlan inquired scornfully.</p>

<p>"Careful of what you say."</p>

<p>"Daniel, were you playing with a Jew?" his grandmother asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was."</p>

<p>He still did not look up, but his voice had a tone, plaintive
and badgered, that attracted the attention of his grandfather,
and the old gentleman interposed soothingly: "Don’t let ’em fret
you, Dannie. It wasn’t particularly wicked of you to play with
a Jew, I expect."</p>

<p>"No," said Dan’s father. "I don’t believe I’d let myself be much
worried over that, if I were you, Dan."</p>

<p>"No?" said Mrs. Savage, and inquired further, somewhat formidably:
"You don’t prefer your sons to choose companions from their own
circle, Henry Oliphant?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do, ma’am," he returned amiably. "As a general thing
I believe it’s better for them to be intimate with the children
of their mother’s and father’s old family friends; but at the
same time I hope Dan and Harlan won’t forget that we live in a
country founded on democratic principles. The population seems
to me to begin to show signs of altering with emigration from
Europe; and it’s no harm for the boys to know something of the
new elements, though for that matter we’ve always had Jews, and
they’re certainly not bad citizens. I don’t see any great harm
in Dan’s playing a little with a Jewish boy, if he wants to."</p>

<p>"I wasn’t playin’," Dan said.</p>

<p>"Weren’t you?" his father asked. "What were you doing?"</p>

<p>"We were—we were manufacturing. We were manufacturing useful
articles."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"Ornamental brackets to nail on walls and put things on. We were
goin’ to make good money out of it."</p>

<p>"Well, that was all right," Mr. Oliphant said genially. "Not
a bad idea at all. You’re all right, Dannie."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a word of sympathy often undermines the composure
of the recipient; and upon this Dan’s lower lip began to quiver,
though he inclined his head still farther to conceal the new tokens
of his agitation.</p>

<p>He was not aided by his coolly observant young brother. "Going
to cry about it?" Harlan asked, quietly amused.</p>

<p>"You let Dannie alone," said the grandfather; whereupon Harlan
laughed. "You ought to see what he and his little Jew partner
called brackets!" he said. "Dan’s always thinking he’s making
something, and it’s always something just awful. What he and that
Sam Kohn were really making to-day was a horrible mess of our
summer-house. It’ll take a week’s work for somebody to get it
cleaned up, and he got mad at me and was going to hit me because
mamma sent me to tell him to come in the house and get ready for
dinner."</p>

<p>"I did not," Dan muttered.</p>

<p>"You didn’t? Didn’t you act like you were going to hit me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Dan said. "But it wasn’t because what you say. It was
because you called Sam names."</p>

<p>"I didn’t."</p>

<p>"You did!" And now Dan looked up, showing eyes that glistened
along the lower lids. "You—you hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>Harlan had the air of a self-contained person who begins to be
exasperated by a persistent injustice, and he appealed to the
company. "I told him time and again mamma wanted him to come in
and get ready to come here for dinner, and he simply wouldn’t
do it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage shook her head. "I’ve always told you," she said
to her daughter, "you’ll repent bitterly some day for your lack
of discipline with your children. You’re not raising them the
way I raised mine, and some day——"</p>

<p>But Harlan had not finished his explanation. "So, after I waited
and waited," he continued, "and they just went on messing up our
summer-house, I told him he’d better come in and let the dirty
little Jew boy go home. That’s all I said, and he was going to
hit me for it."</p>

<p>"You—you hurt his fuf-feelings," Dan stammered, as his emotion
increased. "I told you, you hurt his <em>feelings</em>!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" Harlan returned lightly. "What feelings has he got? He
wouldn’t be around where he doesn’t belong if he had any."</p>

<p>"I asked him there," Dan said, the tears in his eyes overflowing
as he spoke; and he began to grope hurriedly through his various
pockets for a handkerchief. "He had a right to be where he was
invited, didn’t he? You—you called him——"</p>

<p>"I said he was just exactly what he is, and if he ever comes
around our yard again, I’ll say it again."</p>

<p>"No, you won’t!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I will," Harlan said with perfect composure; and this
evidence that he believed himself in the right and would certainly
carry out his promise was too much for the suffering Dan, who
startled his relatives by unexpectedly sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>"You dog-gone old <em>thing</em>!" he cried, his shoulders heaving
and his voice choked with the half-swallowed tears in his throat.
"I <em>will</em> hit you now!" He rose, making blind sweeps with
both arms in the direction of Harlan, and, in a kind of anguish,
gurgling out imprecations and epithets that shocked his family;
but Mr. Oliphant caught the flailing hands, took the boy by the
shoulders and impelled him from the room, going with him. A moment
or two later the passionate voice ceased to be coherent; plaintive
sounds were heard, growing fainter with increasing distance; and
Mr. Oliphant, slightly flushed, returned to finish his dinner.</p>

<p>"I sent him home," he explained. "He’ll probably feel better,
out in the dark alone."</p>

<p>"And may I inquire, Henry Oliphant," said the old lady at the
head of the table;—"is that all you intend to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I might talk to him after he cools off a little."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that will be all!" Mrs. Savage returned with
a short laugh, emphatically one of disapproval. "It’s a fine generation
you modern people are raising. When I was fifteen I was supposed
to be a woman, but my father whipped me for a slight expression
of irreverence on Sunday."</p>

<p>"I’m sorry to hear it, ma’am," her son-in-law said genially.</p>

<p>"I’m not sorry it happened," she informed him, not relaxing.
"Such things were part of a discipline that made a strong people."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma’am; I’ve no doubt it’s to your generation we owe what
the country is to-day."</p>

<p>"And it’s your generation that’s going to let it go to the dogs!"
the old lady retorted sharply. "May I ask what you intend to do
to protect Harlan when you go home and his brother attacks him?"</p>

<p>But at this Oliphant laughed. "Dan won’t attack him. By the time
we get home Dan will probably be in bed."</p>

<p>"Then he’ll attack Harlan to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No, he won’t, ma’am. I don’t say Dan won’t sleep on a damp pillow
to-night, the way he was going on, but by to-morrow he’ll have
forgotten all about it."</p>

<p>"He won’t," she declared. "A child can’t have a passion like
that, with its parents doing nothing to discipline it, and then
just forget. Harlan only did his duty, but Dan will attack him
again the first chance he gets. You’ll see!"</p>

<p>Oliphant was content to let her have the last word—perhaps because
he knew she would have it in any event—so he laughed again, placatively,
and began to talk with his father-in-law of Mr. Blaine’s chances
at the approaching national convention; while Mrs. Savage shook
her gloomy, handsome head and made evident her strong opinion
that the episode was anything but closed. There would always henceforth
be hatred between the two brothers, she declared to her daughter,
whom she succeeded in somewhat depressing.</p>

<p>But as a prophet she appeared before long to have failed, at
least in regard to the predicted feeling between her two grandsons.
Dan may have slept on his wrath, but he did not cherish it; and
the next day his relations with Harlan were as usual. The unarmed
neutrality, which was not precisely a mutual ignoring, was resumed
and continued. It continued, indeed, throughout the youth of the
brothers; and prevailed with them during their attendance at the
university at New Haven, whither they went in imitation of their
father before them. The studious Harlan matriculated in company
with his older brother; they were classmates, though not roommates;
and peace was still prevalent between them when they graduated.
Nevertheless, in considering and comprehending the career of a
man like Daniel Oliphant, certain boyhood episodes appear to shed
a light, and the conflict over little Sammy Kohn bears some significance. </p>
