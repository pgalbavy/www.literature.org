<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p><em>ONE </em>day in spring, a border ranger was making his way
through the cane-brakes of Kentucky, in what is now called Lewis
county.</p>

<p>All through the frontier wars, such men were employed by the
generals and leaders of the different forces, and they formed
no insignificant part of their power. Of the American scouts is
this especially true. A more daring, reckless, and effective set
of men the world has never known. Scores of names have come down
to us, whose record is but one long, brilliant array of thrilling
acts, any one of which would have sufficed for the lifetime of
an ordinary individual.</p>

<p>For a period of nearly half a century, the valleys of the Ohio,
Sciota, Miami, Mad, and numerous other rivers, were constantly
ranged by these characters, who generally went alone, but sometimes
in couples, and very rarely in larger companies. Their whole duty
was to spy the hostile Indian tribes. The warlike, revengeful
Shawnees, a mighty and powerful nation in themselves, had so stirred
up the other tribes, that nothing but eternal watchfulness could
guard the settlers from the knife and tomahawk. Many long years
was the government compelled to keep an independent force to protect
the frontier. The disastrous results of many of these campaigns
but prolonged the painful war; and the final success of our arms
is much more due to the prowess of these border rangers, than
we are apt to imagine. Every artifice was adopted by them to secure
the necessary information. Should the tribes collect in unusual
numbers in any village, there was sure to be a pair of keen eyes
watching every movement from some hiding-place. Their deadliest
enemies ventured in disguise among the Indians, dogged their trail
for days, or lay concealed in such proximity that only at night
did they dare to creep forth. All perils were undergone by these
hardy men.</p>

<p>Such a character we have now to deal with.</p>

<p>Had we been in close proximity to him, we might have heard a
slight rustling now and then, and perhaps the breaking of a small
twig. The scout was proceeding with caution, but it was evident
that it was more from habit than from any suspicion of danger.
Were there savages in the vicinity, not the slightest noise would
have betrayed his presence to the most watchful one.</p>

<p>A moment after, the bushes parted, and the ranger, in a half-crouching
position, emerged into the open wood. Here he straightened himself
up, and disclosed a frame wondrously like that of Peterson. Tall,
sinewy, graceful, and thin almost to emaciation, with a sharp-featured
face, half-covered by a thin, straggling beard, and small twinkling
eyes of such glittering blackness that they fairly scintillated
fire in excitement&mdash;these were the noticeable characteristics
of the man.</p>

<p>After coming into the open wood, he stood a moment, as if listening,
and then strode rapidly forward, trailing a long nitid rifle as
he did so. Reaching the edge of the river, he suddenly halted
and darted behind a tree. His quick eye had discovered "sign."
From this point he peered cautiously out, and then instantly jerked
his head back again. This movement was repeated several times,
until, at last he held his head in a stationary position. After
gazing a few minutes, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a flat-boat aground, sure as my name's Dick Dingle.
Things look s'pishus the way it's sticking in the mud thar. Some
of the blasted Shawnees' work, I'll swar; and I'll bet my head
that that ar' Tom McGable's been at the bottom of the whole. Ef
I could only meet that dog in a fair stand-up fight, I wouldn't
ax no other boon. I'd go home, fold my arms, and with a smile
upon my brow, lay down and softly go under. Jest keep docile now,
Dick Dingle, and look around afore you gets nigher that concern
out thar'. Like as not it's a hornet's nest full of reds."</p>

<p>For over two hours Dingle reconnoitered the flat-boat, and all
the time kept himself carefully concealed from it. He glided around
in the wood, viewing it from every imaginable position that could
be reached from the shore. At last he seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"Whosomever is in that flat-boat ain't <em>livin'</em>, that's
sartin; and whosomever is watching it from shore ain't nigh enough
to hurt you, Dingle, so hyer goes."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
[Illustration: "Whosomever is on that flat-boat ain't living, that's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sartin."]

</p>
</div>
<p>With this, he stepped softly into the water, and waded out toward
the flat-boat. After reaching it, he again paused a moment, glanced
toward the shore, and then placing his hand upon the gunwale,
bounded over into the boat. The ranger, probably the first time
in his experience, instead of alighting firmly upon his feet,
slipped and immediately fell flat upon his side; but he instantly
sprang up again, and then saw the cause of his mishap. He had
alighted directly in a pool of dark, thick, sticky blood! The
sight that met his eye was enough to freeze with horror, for a
moment, even him who was used to meeting death in every repulsive
shape! The deck was slippery with blood, and from the cabin came
the sickening smell of death. Blood and brains were scattered
around, against, and upon everything, but not a corpse was visible!</p>

<p>"They've tomahawked 'em all, and pitched 'em overboard. Ef that
ain't enough to make a minister or even a scout swear, then my
name ain't Dick Dingle, that's all. That ar' McGable's been hyer,
sure; 'cause whar <em>he's</em> been nobody lives, and I ca'c'late
nobody of them poor whites has lived in these parts. Wal, wal,
it's bad business. I like scouting it when the killin' is all
on our side; but it ain't, by a heap. Ef it wan't, why we wouldn't
need to scout; but that ar' McGable is bound to squar' accounts
with me yit for this night's business."</p>

<p>The ranger remained a short time longer, examining the flat-boat,
which, as the reader has probably supposed, was the one whose
sad fate was recorded in the preceding chapter. He was satisfied
that not a soul had survived the frightful massacre, and after
a few minutes' further delay, he again dropped into the water,
and made his way to land. He stepped cautiously ashore, and, as
was his invariable custom, commenced talking to himself.</p>

<p>"Old Mad Anthony sent me down in these parts to find out what
the reds ar' drivin at, and reckon as how I've found&mdash;hello, Dingle,
what are ye about?"</p>

<p>With the last question, uttered in a hurried whisper, the ranger
disappeared like a shadow. Had any one been beside him, he would
have been at a loss to understand the cause of the sudden movement,
for not the least noise was audible, nor the slightest movement
visible. But the truth was the scout, all at once, became aware
that some person beside himself was in the wood. The instant of
discovery he dropped upon his hands and knees, and glided swiftly
and noiselessly away, and commenced reconnoitring the stranger
to ascertain his identity and intentions.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that the latter was in precisely the same
situation, and it was a singular coincidence that both should
make the discovery of the other's presence, and commence seeking
to know him at the same moment.</p>

<p>But thus it was, and the stratagems, maneuvers, and artifices
resorted to by each to accomplish his ends, were extraordinary.
For nearly two hours they dodged and feinted, glided and retreated,
without coming any nearer success, and finally made the discovery
by accident. Dingle came to the conclusion that whoever his rival
was, he was certainly a genuine woodsman, and, if an Indian, one
who was well worthy of coping with him. But the consummate tact
and skill displayed, led him to suspect the other was a white
man, and for this reason he became more careless in his movements.
The consequence was that, after he had flitted from one tree to
another, he began to doubt whether he had accomplished the movement
successfully; and, while thus doubting, he heard his name called.</p>

<p>"Shoot me, if that ain't you, Dick Dingle! Why don't you come
out and shake paws with an old friend?"</p>

<p>And the next minute Jim Peterson stepped boldly forth.</p>

<p>"Wal, Jim, I might've knowed that was your ugly picter. Whar'd
you come from?"</p>

<p>The two grasped hands, and gave, what Edward Everett terms, the
genuine <em>tourniquet</em> shake. They had been brother rangers
through Gen. St. Clair's war, and had ever been together, encountering
all imaginable dangers, and were the joint heroes of the most
wonderful escapes. And when we say that neither had seen the face
of the other for over six years, it may well be supposed that
their meeting was of the most pleasant kind. As they stood, grasping
hands, and smilingly exchanging jocose remarks in their characteristic
way, the resemblance between them was most remarkable. In fact,
they had often, when in service, been taken for brothers, and
their identity was often confounded. The Shawnees, who knew them
rather more than they cared about, termed them the "Double Long-Knives."
Both were tall, graceful, and sinewy, as straight as arrows, and
with faces sparsely bearded, and, to increase the perplexity of
separating them, they dressed precisely alike. But Dingle had
small, black eyes, and a sharp Roman nose, while Peterson had
eyes of a light gray color, and a nose a perfect Grecian in cast.</p>

<p>"Come, Dick, what are you doin' in these parts?" asked Peterson.</p>

<p>"I'm out fur Mad Anthony, as you might know, and have been taking
a look at the flat-boat there. Ah! bad business! bad business,
Jim!"</p>

<p>"Yas, if you'd have only seed it, Dick, you might say so."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything 'bout it? Who the poor wretches was?&mdash;when
'twas done?&mdash;how they came to do it?&mdash;and <em>who</em> done it?"
asked Dingle, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I war on that boat, and the only one who saved his hair."</p>

<p>"The only one, Jim?"</p>

<p>"The only one; and when I got clean off, I jist clapped my hand
on my head to see ef my hair was thar still, fur I had strong
doubts of it. I was the only one! I took a long jump and a dive
fur it."</p>

<p>"How was it, when you was on, that they come in for one of the
all-fired decoys?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't hender them;" and Peterson proceeded to give, in
a few words, what is already known to the reader.</p>

<p>"Let me ax you one thing," said Dingle, when he had finished.
"Do you know whether that renegade McGable had anything to do
with this business?"</p>

<p>"He was the decoy himself; but a feller come on board up at the
Kanawha who got the poor fools to run into shore."</p>

<p>"Was he a short, squashy-looking imp?"</p>

<p>"He war exactly so."</p>

<p>"Then 'twas Pete Gammock. I know him. He and McGable have hung
together fur three&mdash;four years that way. That's his plan; he's
tried the same trick afore. He goes on the flat-boats, at some
place up that way, and purtends he's one of us going down the
river to the 'Three Islands', Marysville, or some of the forts.
After he gits on, he fixes so as to pull the wool over thar eyes,
and when McGable bawls out fur 'em to come ashore, he persuades
'em to do it."</p>

<p>"He'll never do it agin, fur I settled the business with him
soon as he owned up he'd come the gammon game. I feel sorry, Dick,
mighty sorry fur them poor whites that was sarved that mean trick;
but thar was one among 'em that went under, and I ain't ashamed
to own it makes me feel watery to think on it. I left her dyin'
on board just as I jumped over and the imps clambered up."</p>

<p>Peterson drew the sleeve of his hunting-shirt across his eyes,
and Dingle, with respect to his feelings, remained silent a moment,
when he returned: "P'r'aps she ain't gone under, Jim; maybe the
reds have gone off with her."</p>

<p>"No they haven't; she's out in the river yender somewhar. The
reds tomahawked every one. I kinder had a faint hope she might
be among 'em, and I've been follerin' them to find out. I seed
all the Injuns, and that infarnal McGable among 'em. They had
plenty of hair hangin' to their girdles, but they hadn't a captive
among 'em. That ar' McGable tried to get Marian Abbot, and because
she wouldn't have him, he has done this. I b'lieve he fired the
gun that killed her, when I had her in my arm just goin' to jump
overboard to take a swim for it. And, Dick, I swear that I'll
never rest till that renegade McGable pays for this."</p>

<p>"I jine you in that!" said Dingle, taking his hand. "We'll hunt
him together. He's murdered enough of his own blood, and we'll
stop it <em>right off</em>."</p>

<p>"I've got to go and tell the old folks of it, and young Mansfield.
I know it'll break their hearts, and I'd rather be shot and burnt
than do it; but it's got to be done, and I must do it."</p>

<p>"Are you goin' now?"</p>

<p>"Yas, right away. As soon as I see 'em, I'll be back agin. I'll
wait fur you down at the fort below."</p>

<p>"And what then, Jim?"</p>

<p>"We'll start off on that hunt," said Peterson, in a low tone,
and with this, the two rangers separated, and took different directions
in the forest.</p>
