<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The new arrival was Hero the hound. He came on the scene with
a rush and proceeded straight to business.</p>

<p>He did not need to pause to take in the situation, but with a
faint whine and short yelp he bounded for the savage buck, which
did not see him until they collided. But the old fellow was game.
Though he had fled in a wild panic when the baying of the dog
rang through the woods, yet now that he was at bay he fought like
a Trojan.</p>

<p>Realizing that it was a fight for life, he whirled about, lowered
those splendid antlers and went for the canine like a steam engine.</p>

<p>The dog had no wish to be bored through by such formidable weapons,
and, with a bark of fear, he leaped back, alert and watchful for
a chance to seize his victim by the throat.</p>

<p>Now was the time for the young hunters to put in the finishing
touches, for the buck was so occupied with his new assailant that
he could give them no attention.</p>

<p>Bob Budd dared not crawl from under the tree and run for his
gun lying some yards away, which would have to be re-loaded before
it could be of use to him.</p>

<p>But the young man was convinced that the golden opportunity for
the others had arrived, and he did not hesitate to proclaim it
in tones that could have been heard a half-mile off.</p>

<p>Tom Wagstaff was persuaded that he was safe so long as he remained
astride of the limb where he had perched himself with such haste
when the buck gave him a lively chase, and if he knew his own
heart (as he was confident he did) he did not mean to descend
from his elevation and run the risk of being elevated or bored
by the antlers of the vicious buck.</p>

<p>"By the time I can get down there and get hold of my gun he will
have the dog knocked out and then he’ll start for <em>me</em>,
and where will Ibe? No; I had enough hard work to climb up here
and <em>I’ll stay</em>."</p>

<p>And so, unmindful of the reproaches and appeals of the howling
Bob, Tom continued to play the part of interested spectator.</p>

<p>The fight between the buck and the hound promised to be a prolonged
one, though it looked as if the fine beast would have to succumb
in the end.</p>

<p>Had he been able to get the dog in a corner where he could not
dodge, it is probable he might have finished him, for one terrific
ramming of those antlers would have been enough, but the agility
of Hero saved him each time. When the horny weapons were lowered
and the buck made a rush which seemed sure to impale the canine,
he sprang nimbly aside like a skillful sparrer, still on the alert
for an opening.</p>

<p>The deer displayed an intelligence that hardly would have been
expected at such a time. He avoided rearing on his hind legs,
and trying to hew his assailant with his fore-paws, as he had
sought to do in the case of the youngsters, for such an effort
on his part would have given Hero the fatal opening he wanted.
One lightning-like bound, and his sharp teeth would have closed
in the throat of the buck, and there they would have stuck until
he gasped his last breath.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the hound would have kept his body out of
reach of the hoofs, while, as a matter of course, the antlers
would have been powerless against such a determined assailant.</p>

<p>It was this fact which must have been understood by the buck,
that caused him to keep his head lowered and toward the hound,
who, despite his rapid darting hither and thither, was unable
for a time to catch him off his guard.</p>

<p>It was a forcible commentary on the incompetence and cowardice
of the hunters, that there were three of them, all armed and one
with both charges in his gun, and yet they dared not interfere
while the feinting and striking was going on between the dog and
buck.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that what I am relating took place in
an exceedingly brief space of time.</p>

<p>But the contest, if such it may be called, between the two animals
might have continued indefinitely, so far as Bob Budd and Tom
Wagstaff were concerned.</p>

<p>The latter, as I have explained, was safely perched among the
branches of a tree, while his unloaded gun lay on the ground some
distance away, and it was certain to lie there until the struggle
between Hero and the larger animal should be settled.</p>

<p>Bob was equally positive that it was his duty to keep himself
squeezed beneath the trunk of the oak, though his dread of the
animal caused him to edge as many inches as he dared toward the
opposite side.</p>

<p>As for Jim McGovern, he was in a quandary. He was as strongly
resolved as the other two to avoid any charge from the buck, reasoning
that if neither of his brother Rangers was able to stay him with
their loaded guns, it was improbable that he could do so with
his single weapon.</p>

<p>But somehow or other he felt it incumbent upon him to make use
of his gun, which he still held in hand with its two hammers raised
and the triggers ready to be pressed.</p>

<p>He inclined to favor the scheme of climbing a tree, where he
could open a bombardment at his leisure and smile at the anger
of the buck that was so much interested in the hound.</p>

<p>But the difficulty with this plan was that of taking the weapon
into the branches with him. To make his way up the trunk, he needed
the use of all his limbs, arms as well as legs, and it was therefore
out of his power to carry a heavy gun with him.</p>

<p>You will understand that the same obstacle would be encountered
in grasping a limb and lifting himself upward, for a lad who drinks
whiskey and smokes cigarettes can never be enough of an athlete
to draw himself upward with a single arm.</p>

<p>At such times as I am describing the most sluggish brain thinks
fast, and the thoughts I have named went through the head of Jim
McGovern in a twentieth of the time taken to narrate them.</p>

<p>He was inclined to the theory that he ought to do <em>something</em>,
though impatient with the continued yelling of Bob.</p>

<p>"Now’s your chance, Jim! What are you waiting for? Shoot quick,
for he’ll soon kill the dog and then he’ll finish <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"If you’ll shut up for a minute," shouted Jim, in reply, "I’ll
shoot, but you’re making such an infernal rumpus that I can’t
take aim."</p>

<p>At this hint Bob ceased his appeals and something like silence
settled over the exciting scene.</p>

<p>The fiery Hero saw that he would soon have the buck at his mercy,
for the animal was tiring himself out by his savage charges. Sometimes
he would lower his antlers and dash forward for twenty paces at
the dog, which deftly avoided him and saved his strength. Then
the buck would slowly fall back, all the time maintaining his
defiant front and charging again, often before he had fully recovered
from his preceding effort.</p>

<p>It was an interesting fact that, during the few minutes occupied
by this singular contest, each of the combatants met with a hair-breadth
escape, so to speak, from the other.</p>

<p>Once when the buck made his rush, Hero, in leaping backward,
collided with an obstruction on the ground which caused him to
roll over and over, and the formidable antlers touched him; but
with inimitable dexterity he regained his feet and escaped the
sword-like thrust that grazed his skin.</p>

<p>No escape could have been narrower, but that which the buck met
within the same minute was fully as narrow.</p>

<p>It may have been that Hero was a victim to some extent of the
impatience which the youths around him felt, for seeing an opportunity
he bounded like a cannon-ball from the earth at the throat of
the buck.</p>

<p>The latter was quick to read the meaning of the crouching figure
which left the ground before he could drop his antlers to receive
him, else it would have gone ill for the assailant, but the buck
flung his head backward just far enough to save his throat from
those merciless fangs.</p>

<p>When it is stated that the flesh of the deer just back of his
jaws was nipped by the same teeth which could not get a hold deep
enough to be retained, it will be admitted that the fellow could
not have had a closer call.</p>

<p>But these furious efforts were far more telling upon the larger
animal than upon the dog, which could not have failed to understand
that he had only to wait a brief while to have the buck at his
mercy, and those teeth, once buried in the throat of the game,
would stay there, as I have said, until the last gasp of life
departed.</p>

<p>By and by Hero saw a better opening than before and instantly
gathered his muscles for a spring.</p>

<p>A few seconds previous to this crisis Jim McGovern had mastered
the idea that there was but one thing to do, and that was to take
careful aim at the buck and kill him; no quicker means of ending
the danger could be devised than that.</p>

<p>He had learned that a good place into which to send the charge,
no matter what the species of the animal may he, is just behind
the foreleg, where a well-aimed bullet or charge of shot fired
at close quarters, is sure to reach the seat of life.</p>

<p>While running his eye along the barrel the buck turned broadside
toward Jim, and thrusting one foot forward gave the very opportunity
he wanted.</p>

<p>Fearful that he would shift his position the next instant, Jim
discharged both barrels in quick succession.</p>

<p>The report was yet ringing through the woods when a rasping howl
rose on the air that made the blood of every one tingle.</p>

<p>"I didn’t know that deer let out such cries as that when they
were shot," muttered Jim, lowering his gun and walking forward,
"but I s’pose I sent both charges through his heart—<em>great
Jewhilakens</em>!"</p>

<p>He had suddenly awakened to the fact that instead of shooting
the buck he had sent both charges into the body of the hound,
just as he was in the act of leaping at the throat of his victim.</p>

<p>The inevitable consequence of this blunder was that Hero lay
stretched on the ground as dead as Julius Cæsar.</p>
