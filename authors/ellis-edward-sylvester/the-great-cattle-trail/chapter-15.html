<p>It was a startling sight, when Captain Shirril, stretched at
full length on the roof of his cabin, gazed in front of him and
saw the head and shoulders of a Comanche Indian slowly rise to
view at the corner of the eaves.</p>

<p>He could not doubt its meaning: the assailants were bent on burning
the structure, and were willing to face the danger that was sure
to meet them in making the attempt.</p>

<p>Even in this exciting moment, the Texan could not help asking
himself the question which he had asked many times before: why
did not the redskins set fire to the side of the house, where
they were involved in no such peril as now? They might have gathered
several armfuls of combustibles, and, heaping them against the
wooden walls, fire them at their leisure, but, for some reason,
they preferred to climb upon the roof, and run the risk of colliding
with the courageous Dinah or her fearless master.</p>

<p>In doing as they did, the Comanches were shrewder than would
be supposed. It is true that the narrow windows commanded only
one side of the cabin, and that the attempt spoken of brought
little if any danger to themselves. In fact, as afterward was
learned, they did their best to set fire to the rear, and at the
end, but the timber was so damp that the flames failed to communicate.
The long continued drought affected the walls to a far less degree
than the roof, where the sun had free play day after day. Had
there been a driving storm, the top would have been less favorable
than the walls, but from the causes named it lost its moisture
much more readily.</p>

<p>Besides, the flames on the roof could not be reached as readily
nor with so much safety by the defenders as at the sides. They
naturally believed there was plenty of water at command. The moment
the fire should begin to show through the crevices in the timbers,
this could be dashed against the other side and brought into play.</p>

<p>It was different on the roof, which could not be reached so well.
There may have been other motives influencing the Comanches in
the first instance, such as supposing that the whites, having
once repulsed the attempt, would not look for its repetition,
since the Indians must expose themselves to the greatest possible
peril.</p>

<p>However, without speculating as to their reasons, the fact remained
that a second Indian was rising like an apparition above the eaves,
with the evident intention of trying to repair the failure of
his companion a short time before.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril felt that it would have been better had he stayed
where he was; for, with his head just above the level of the scuttle,
he could have picked off the wretch the very moment he became
aware of his presence.</p>

<p>But now, while creeping so guardedly along the roof, he had held
his rifle by the barrel, with most of the weapon behind him. Had
it been discharged, in that position, it was he who would have
received the bullet, instead of the Indian.</p>

<p>To make the gun effective, he must bring it around in front and
sight it. While his own form pressed the planking so close that
the savage apparently failed to identify him, though carefully
scanning the surface, there was a strong probability that he would
detect the meaning of the slight noise involved in the act.</p>

<p>The Texan dared not advance nor retreat, though he would have
preferred to withdraw through the opening; but the moment he made
sure of what confronted him, he began bringing his gun forward,
with the resolve to fire the moment he could draw a bead on the
miscreant.</p>

<p>The weapon advanced like the minute-hand over the face of a clock.
Knowing the stake for which he was working, he did not neglect
any precaution that could bring success.</p>

<p>"He can duck his head quickly enough," thought the captain, "but
I'll pick him off the instant there is reason to believe he scents
mischief."</p>

<p>His intention, in such an event, was to bring his Winchester
to the right position and discharge it with the utmost celerity.
His experience in the Civil War and in Texas rendered him an adept
at this business, but, on the other hand, it will be seen that
the precautions of the Comanche himself could be executed in a
twinkling.</p>

<p>"Confound the luck!"</p>

<p>Captain Shirril had almost reached the decisive point, when the
head of the redskin vanished!</p>

<p>Whether or not he saw his danger cannot be said, but it is probable
that the slight noise of the arm and gun struck his ear and decided
him to drop out of sight until an investigation should be made.</p>

<p>The Texan was exasperated, for he was eager to bring down this
scamp, and, up to the moment of his disappearance, was confident
of doing so, but the opportunity was gone.</p>

<p>Instead of retreating to cover again, he decided to remain on
the roof a brief while longer; but he stealthily shifted his position
a little nearer the edge of the building. Now that he was at liberty
for the moment, he laid aside his gun and drew his revolver. That
was the weapon for such an emergency, and he kept it in position
for instant use, without the fatal preliminaries that had just
defeated his purpose.</p>

<p>The captain clung to the belief that, despite the second repulse
of the Comanches, they would persist in their attempt until it
should prove too costly to them.</p>

<p>But he was not shortsighted enough to believe the repetition
would be in the precise fashion of the last: that is to say, he
did not suspect the Indian, after ducking so promptly out of range,
would pop up his head again to invite a shot.</p>

<p>"He will appear at some other corner," was his conclusion, "which
they believe is unguarded."</p>

<p>His eyes had become so accustomed to the gloom that he could
trace the outlines of the eaves around the cabin, and he felt
little fear, therefore, of his enemies stealing upon him unawares.
They might try it, but he was confident of defeating their purpose
at the very onset.</p>

<p>Another fear troubled him: having learned that he was on the
roof, they were likely to begin firing at it from a distance,
raking the entire surface so effectively that some of the bullets
were quite sure to find him. Prudence whispered to him to withdraw
into the interior of the cabin while the chance was his, but there
was a stubborn streak in the Texan's composition which caused
him to hold his place. He had been under fire so often that it
seemed as if nothing could disturb his coolness or ruffle his
presence of mind, and he was so inured to personal peril that
he felt something of the old thrill of which he had spoken earlier
in the evening, when recalling his experience in the war that
had closed only a few years before.</p>

<p>But none of the expected shots came. He heard the sound of more
than one mustang's hoofs, and several signals between the warriors,
but no one sent a bullet skimming along the slope on which he
lay looking and listening, and on the alert for the first appearance
of his assailants.</p>

<p>This led him to suspect that, after all, they were not certain
of his presence. It was sound and not sight that had caused the
sudden withdrawal of the warrior.</p>

<p>If this were the case, there was a greater probability of his
showing up again.</p>

<p>It is at such times that the minutes seem to have ten-fold their
real length. The Texan, after glancing closely along the rim of
the roof, not forgetting to take a peep over the peak, turned
his gaze to the northward, and listened for the sounds that were
so long in coming. Not the glimmer of a light showed in that direction,
nor could he catch the faintest sound of a galloping hoof, other
than such as was made by the mustangs of the Comanches near the
building.</p>

<p>"Avon ought to have arrived before this, and the boys would not
throw away a second after learning the truth from him. He may
have been hindered, but&#11834;"</p>
