<P>
As soon as I was alone, I took from my pocket one of the
handbills which my excitable fellow-traveler had presented to me,
so as to have it ready for Mrs. Baggs the moment we stood face to
face. Armed with this ominous letter of introduction, I kicked a
chair down against the folding-doors, by way of giving a
preliminary knock to arouse the housekeeper's attention. The plan
was immediately successful. Mrs. Baggs opened the doors of
communication violently. A slight smell of spirits entered the
room, and was followed close by the housekeeper herself, with an
indignant face and a disordered head-dress.
<P>
"What do you mean, sir? How dare you--" she began; then stopped
aghast, looking at me in speechless astonishment.
<P>
"I have been obliged to make a slight alteration in my personal
appearance, ma'am," I said. "But I am still Frank Softly."
<P>
"Don't talk to me about personal appearances, sir," cried Mrs.
Baggs recovering. "What do you mean by being here? Leave the
house immediately. I shall write to the doctor, Mr. Softly, this
very night."
<P>
"He has no address you can direct to," I rejoined. "If you don't
believe me, read that." I gave her the handbill without another
word of preface.
<P>
Mrs. Baggs looked at it--lost in an instant some of the fine
color plentifully diffused over her face by sleep and
spirits--sat down in the nearest chair with a thump that seemed
to threaten the very foundations of Number Two, Zion Place--and
stared me hard in the face; the most speechless and helpless
elderly female I ever beheld.
<P>
"Take plenty of time to compose yourself ma'am," I said. "If you
don't see the doctor again soon, under the gallows, you will
probably not have the pleasure of meeting with him for some
considerable time."
<P>
Mrs. Baggs smote both her hands distractedly on her knees, and
whispered a devout ejaculation to herself softly.
<P>
"Allow me to deal with you, ma'am, as a woman of the world," I
went on. "If you will give me half-an-hour's hearing, I will
explain to you how I come to know what I do; how I got here; and
what I have to propose to Miss Alicia and to you."
<P>
"If you have the feelings of a man, sir," said Mrs. Baggs,
shaking her head and raising her eyes to heaven, "you will
remember that I have nerves, and will not presume upon them."
<P>
As the old lady uttered the last words, I thought I saw her eyes
turn from heaven, and take the earthly direction of the sofa in
the front parlor. It struck me also that her lips looked rather
dry. Upon these two hints I spoke.
<P>
"Might I suggest some little stimulant?" I asked, with respectful
earnestness. "I have heard my grandmother (Lady Malkinshaw) say
that, 'a drop in time saves nine.' "
<P>
"You will find it under the sofa pillow," said Mrs. Baggs, with
sudden briskness. " 'A drop in time saves nine'--my sentiments,
if I may put myself on a par with her ladyship. The
liqueur-glass, Mr. Softly, is in the backgammon-board. I hope her
ladyship was well the last time you heard from her? Suffers from
her nerves, does she? Like me, again. In the backgammon-board.
Oh, this news, this awful news!"
<P>
I found the bottle of brandy in the place indicated, but no
liqueur-glass in the backgammon-board. There was, however, a
wine-glass, accidentally left on a chair by the sofa. Mrs. Baggs
did not seem to notice the difference when I brought it into the
back room and filled it with brandy.
<P>
"Take a toothful yourself," said Mrs. Baggs, lightly tossing off
the dram in a moment. " 'A drop in time'--I can't help repeating
it, it's so nicely expressed. Still, with submission to her
ladyship's better judgment, Mr. Softly, the question seems now to
arise, whether, if one drop in time saves nine, two drops in time
may not save eighteen." Here Mrs. Baggs forgot her nerves and
winked. I returned the wink and filled the glass a second time.
"Oh, this news, this awful news!" said Mrs. Baggs, remembering
her nerves again.
<P>
Just then I thought I heard footsteps in front of the house, but,
listening more attentively, found that it had begun to rain, and
that I had been deceived by the pattering of the first heavy
drops against the windows. However, the bare suspicion that the
same stranger who had called already might be watching the house
now, was enough to startle me very seriously, and to suggest the
absolute necessity of occupying no more precious time in paying
attention to the vagaries of Mrs. Baggs' nerves. It was also of
some importance that I should speak to her while she was sober
enough to understand what I meant in a general way.
<P>
Feeling convinced that she was in imminent danger of becoming
downright drunk if I gave her another glass, I kept my hand on
the bottle, and forthwith told my story over again in a very
abridged and unceremonious form, and without allowing her one
moment of leisure for comment on my narrative, whether it might
be of the weeping, winking, drinking, groaning, or ejaculating
kind. As I had anticipated, when I came to a conclusion, and
consequently allowed her an opportunity of saying a few words,
she affected to be extremely shocked and surprised at hearing of
the nature of her master's pursuits, and reproached me in terms
of the most vehement and virtuous indignation for incurring the
guilt of abetting them, even though I had done so from the very
excusable motive of saving my own life. Having a lively sense of
the humorous, I was necessarily rather amused by this; but I
began to get a little surprised as well, when we diverged to the
subject of the doctor's escape, on finding that Mrs. Baggs viewed
the fact of his running away to some hiding-place of his own in
the light of a personal insult to his faithful and attached
housekeeper.
<P>
"It shows a want of confidence in me," said the old lady, "which
I may forgive, but can never forget. The sacrifices I have made
for that ungrateful man are not to be told in words. The very
morning he sent us away here, what did I do? Packed up the moment
he said Go. I had my preserves to pot, and the kitchen chimney to
be swept, and the lock of my box hampered into the bargain. Other
women in my place would have grumbled--I got up directly, as
lively as any girl of eighteen you like to mention. Says he, 'I
want Alicia taken out of young Softly's way, and you must do
it.'---Says I, 'This very morning, sir?'--Says he, 'This very
morning.'--Says I, 'Where to?'--Says he, 'As far off as ever you
can go; coast of Wales--Crickgelly. I won't trust her nearer;
young Softly's too cunning, and she's too fond of him.'--'Any
more orders, sir?' says I.--'Yes; take some fancy name--Simkins,
Johnson, Giles, Jones, James,' says he, 'what you like bu t
Dulcifer; for that scamp Softly will move heaven and earth to
trace her.'--'What else?' says I.--'Nothing, but look sharp,'
says he; 'and mind one thing, that she sees no visitors, and
posts no letters.' Before those last words had been out of his
wicked lips an hour, we were off. A nice job I had to get her
away--a nice job to stop her from writing letters to you--a nice
job to keep her here. But I did it; I followed my orders like a
slave in a plantation with a whip at his bare back. I've had
rheumatics, weak legs, bad nights, and miss in the sulks--all
from obeying the doctor's orders. And what is my reward? He turns
coiner, and runs away without a word to me beforehand, and writes
me a trumpery note, without a date to it, without a farthing of
money in it, telling me nothing! Look at my confidence in him,
and then look at the way he's treated me in return. What woman's
nerves can stand that? Don't keep fidgeting with the bottle! Pass
it this way, Mr. Softly, or you'll break it, and drive me
distracted."
<P>
"He has no excuse, ma'am," I said. "But will you allow me to
change the subject, as I am pressed for time? You appear to be so
well acquainted with the favorable opinion which Miss Alicia and
I entertain of each other, that I hope it will be no fresh shock
to your nerves, if I inform you, in plain words, that I have come
to Crickgelly to marry her."
<P>
"Marry her! marry--If you don't leave off fidgeting with the
bottle, Mr. Softly, and change the subject directly, I shall ring
the bell."
<P>
"Hear me out, ma'am, and then ring if you like. If you persist,
however, in considering yourself still the confidential servant
of a felon who is now flying for his life, and if you decline
allowing the young lady to act as she wishes, I will not be so
rude as to hint that--as she is of age--she may walk out of this
house with me, whenever she likes, without your having the power
to prevent her; but, I will politely ask instead, what you would
propose to do with her, in the straitened position as to money in
which she and you are likely to be placed? You can't find her
father to give her to; and, if you could, who would be the best
protector for her? The doctor, who is the principal criminal in
the eye of the law, or I, who am only the unwilling accomplice?
He is known to the Bow Street runners--I am not. There is a
reward for the taking of him, and none for the taking of me. He
has no respectable relatives and friends, I have plenty. Every
way my chances are the best; and consequently I am, every way,
the fittest person to trust her to. Don't you see that?"
<P>
Mrs. Baggs did not immediately answer. She snatched the bottle
out of my hands--drank off another dram, shook her head at me,
and ejaculated lamentably: "My nerves, my nerves! what a heart of
stone he must have to presume on my poor nerves!"
<P>
"Give me one minute more," I went on. "I propose to take you and
Alicia to-morrow morning to Scotland. Pray don't groan! I only
suggest the journey with a matrimonial object. In Scotland, Mrs.
Baggs, if a man and woman accept each other as husband and wife,
before one witness, it is a lawful marriage; and that kind of
wedding is, as you see plainly enough, the only safe refuge for a
bridegroom in my situation. If you consent to come with us to
Scotland, and serve as witness to the marriage, I shall be
delighted to acknowledge my sense of your kindness in the
eloquent language of the Bank of England, as expressed to the
world in general on the surface of a five-pound note."
<P>
I cautiously snatched away the brandy bottle as I spoke, and was
in the drawing-room with it in an instant. As I suppose, Mrs.
Baggs tried to follow me, for I heard the door rattle, as if she
had got out of her chair, and suddenly slipped back into it
again. I felt certain of her deciding to help us, if she was only
sober enough to reflect on what I had said to her. The journey to
Scotland was a tedious, and perhaps a dangerous, undertaking. But
I had no other alternative to choose.
<P>
In those uncivilized days, the Marriage Act had not been passed,
and there was no convenient hymeneal registrar in England to
change a vagabond runaway couple into a respectable man and wife
at a moment's notice. The trouble and expense of taking Mrs.
Baggs with us, I encountered, of course, solely out of regard for
Alicia's natural prejudices. She had led precisely that kind of
life which makes any woman but a bad one morbidly sensitive on
the subject of small proprieties. If she had been a girl with a
recognized position in society, I should have proposed to her to
run away with me alone. As it was, the very defenselessness of
her situation gave her, in my opinion, the right to expect from
me even the absurdest sacrifices to the narrowest
conventionalities. Mrs. Baggs was not quite so sober in her
habits, perhaps, as matrons in general are expected to be; but,
for my particular purpose, this was only a slight blemish; it
takes so little, after all, to represent the abstract principle
of propriety in the short-sighted eye of the world.
<P>
As I reached the drawing-room door, I looked at my watch.
<P>
Nine o'clock! and nothing done yet to facilitate our escaping
from Crickgelly to the regions of civilized life the next
morning. I was pleased to hear, when I knocked at the door, that
Alicia's voice sounded firmer as she told me to come in. She was
more confused than astonished or frightened when I sat down by
her on the sofa, and repeated the principal topics of my
conversion with Mrs. Baggs.
<P>
"Now, my own love," I said, in conclusion--suiting my gestures,
it is unnecessary to say, to the tenderness of my
language--"there is not the least doubt that Mrs. Baggs will end
by agreeing to my proposals. Nothing remains, therefore, but for
you to give me the answer now, which I have been waiting for ever
since that last day when we met by the riverside. I did not know
then what the motive was for your silence and distress. I know
now, and I love you better after that knowledge than I did before
it."
<P>
Her head dropped into its former position on my bosom, and she
murmured a few words, but too faintly for me to hear them.
<P>
"You knew more about your father, then, than I did?" I whispered.
<P>
"Less than you have told me since," she interposed quickly,
without raising her face.
<P>
"Enough to convince you that he was breaking the laws," I
suggested; "and, to make you, as his daughter, shrink from saying
'yes' to me when we sat together on the river bank?"
<P>
She did not answer. One of her arms, which was hanging over my
shoulder, stole round my neck, and clasped it gently.
<P>
"Since that time," I went on, "your father has compromised me. I
am in some danger, not much, from the law. I have no prospects
that are not of the most doubtful kind; and I have no excuse for
asking you to share them, except that I have fallen into my
present misfortune through trying to discover the obstacle that
kept us apart. If there is any protection in the world that you
can turn to, less doubtful than mine, I suppose I ought to say no
more, and leave the house. But if there should be none, surely I
am not so very selfish in asking you to take your chance with me?
I honestly believe that I shall have little difficulty, with
ordinary caution, in escaping from pursuit, and finding a safe
home somewhere to begin life in again with new interests. Will
you share it with me, Alicia? I can try no fresh persuasions---I
have no right, perhaps, in my present situation to have addressed
so many to you already."
<P>
Her other arm stole round my neck; she laid her cheek against
mine, and whispered--
<P>
"Be kind to me, Frank--I have nobody in the world who loves me
but you!"
<P>
I felt her tears on my face; my own eyes moistened as I tried to
answer her. We sat for some minutes in perfect silence--without
moving, without a thought beyond the moment. The rising of the
wind, and the splashing of the rain outside were the first sounds
that stirred me into action again.
<P>
I summoned my resolution, rose from the sofa, and in a few hasty
words told Alicia what I proposed for the next day, and mentioned
the hour at which I would come in the morning. As I had
anticipated, she seemed re lieved and reassured at the prospect
even of such slight sanction and encouragement, on the part of
another woman, as would be implied by the companionship of Mrs.
Baggs on the journey to Scotland.
<P>
The next and last difficulty I had to encounter was necessarily
connected with her father. He had never been very affectionate;
and he was now, for aught she or I knew to the contrary, parted
from her forever. Still, the instinctive recognition of his
position made her shrink, at the last moment, when she spoke of
him, and thought of the serious nature of her engagement with me.
After some vain arguing and remonstrating, I contrived to quiet
her scruples, by promising that an address should be left at
Crickgelly, to which any second letter that might arrive from the
doctor could be forwarded. When I saw that this prospect of being
able to communicate with him, if he wrote or wished to see her,
had sufficiently composed her mind, I left the drawing-room. It
was vitally important that I should get back to the inn and make
the necessary arrangements for our departure the next morning,
before the primitive people of the place had retired to bed.
<P>
As I passed the back parlor door on my way out, I heard the voice
of Mrs. Baggs raised indignantly. The words "bottle!" "audacity!"
and "nerves!" reached my ear disjointedly. I called out "Good-by!
till to-morrow;" heard a responsive groan of disgust; then opened
the front door, and plunged out into the dark and rainy night.
<P>
It might have been the dropping of water from the cottage roofs
while I passed through the village, or the groundless alarm of my
own suspicious fancy, but I thought I was being followed as I
walked back to the inn. Two or three times I turned round
abruptly. If twenty men had been at my heels, it was too dark to
see them. I went on to the inn.
<P>
The people there were not gone to bed; and I sent for the
landlord to consult with him about a conveyance. Perhaps it was
my suspicious fancy again; but I thought his manner was altered.
He seemed half distrustful, half afraid of me, when I asked him
if there had been any signs, during my absence, of those two
gentlemen, for whom I had already inquired on arriving at his
door that evening. He gave an answer in the negative, looking
away from me while he spoke.
<P>
Thinking it advisable, on the whole, not to let him see that I
noticed a change in him, I proceeded at once to the question of
the conveyance, and was told that I could hire the landlord's
light cart, in which he was accustomed to drive to the market
town. I appointed an hour for starting the next day, and retired
at once to my bedroom. There my thoughts were enough. I was
anxious about Screw and the Bow Street runner. I was uncertain
about the stranger who had called at Number Two, Zion Place. I
was in doubt even about the landlord of the inn. Never did I know
what real suffering from suspense was, until that night, Whatever
my apprehensions might have been, they were none of them realized
the next morning.
<P>
Nobody followed me on my way to Zion Place, and no stranger had
called there before me a second time, when I made inquiries on
entering the house. I found Alicia blushing, and Mrs. Baggs
impenetrably wrapped up in dignified sulkiness. After informing
me with a lofty look that she intended to go to Scotland with us,
and to take my five-pound note--partly under protest, and partly
out of excessive affection for Alicia--she retired to pack up.
The time consumed in performing this process, and the further
delay occasioned by paying small outstanding debts to
tradespeople, and settling with the owner of the house, detained
us till nearly noon before we were ready to get into the
landlord's cart.
<P>
I looked behind me anxiously at starting, and often afterward on
the road; but never saw anything to excite my suspicions. In
settling matters with the landlord over night, I had arranged
that we should be driven to the nearest town at which a
post-chaise could be obtained. My resources were just as likely
to hold out against the expenses of posting, where public
conveyances could not be obtained, as against the expense of
waiting privately at hotels, until the right coaches might start.
According to my calculations, my money would last till we got to
Scotland. After that, I had my watch, rings, shirtpin, and Mr.
Batterbury, to help in replenishing my purse. Anxious, therefore,
as I was about other things, money matters, for once in a way,
did not cause me the smallest uneasiness.
