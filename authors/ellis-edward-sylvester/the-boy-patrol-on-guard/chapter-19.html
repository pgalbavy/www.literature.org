<p>The skies cleared during the night, and the day which succeeded
was perfect. Not a cloud rift obscured the sun, while the air
was crystalline, free from moisture and with enough coolness to
be invigorating to the last degree. It Would not be pleasant for
some hours to stroll through the woods because of their wetness,
but a trifle like that did not check the exuberant youngsters,
who began dividing into small parties as before,—some to delve
into bird lore, some to study trees and others to fish. Breakfast
was prepared out doors, for the food could not help tasting better
than if cooked in the bungalow.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy, Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes, because of their
former association in many adventures, still chummed. While they
were on the most amicable terms with all the other Boy Scouts,
they naturally drew more closely toward one another. It was creditable
to the lads that every little company invited Isaac Rothstein
to become a member of it for the time. The lad was more quiet
and reserved than usual, but he appreciated this special kindness
shown him. He accepted the invitation of the Eagle Patrol, which
was his own and with whose members he was more intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>The breakfast having been eaten and the morning chores finished,
the troop gathered on the beach in front of the clubhouse, where
Scout Master Hall called out:</p>

<p>"We are going to have visitors; all must stay and give them a
welcome."</p>

<p>They saw a canoe paddled by one man, with a woman sitting in
the middle, while in the bow sat a little girl waving her hand
at the group of boys.</p>

<p>"It’s Sunbeam!" exclaimed the delighted Mike, "and her father
and mither. That explains why the sun shines brighter this morning
than iver befoore, as the folks used to say whin thay obsarved
me strolling down the road."</p>

<p>There could be no mistake as to the identity of the callers.
The doctor smiled as he deftly plied the paddle and the boat headed
straight for the small landing.</p>

<p>"Hello, Cousin Mike! Are you glad to see me?" shouted an infantile
voice.</p>

<p>Mike yanked off his hat and waved it.</p>

<p>"If ye hev any doubt of the same I’ll not wait fur ye to come
ashore, but will swim out and shake hands wid ye," was his cheery
reply as he made a pretense of stepping into the water.</p>

<p>"Don’t do that; I’ll be there in a minute."</p>

<p>Alvin and Chester seized the bow of the frail craft and drew
it slightly up the beach. While they were doing this, Sunbeam
made a leap and would have fallen into the lake, had not the watchful
Mike caught her. Her mother sharply chided her and her "cousin"
was ready with an excuse.</p>

<p>"She obsarved me waiting fur her and catched me wink, which asked
her to jump."</p>

<p>The doctor and his wife shook hands with the three youths that
had called upon them, and Alvin introduced them to Scout Master
Hall and the Boy Patrols, who promptly drew up in line and saluted
the visitors.</p>

<p>"You are as welcome as the flowers in spring," said Mr. Hall;
"and must not think of leaving until after dinner at least and
not then unless you must."</p>

<p>"You are kind," said Mrs. Spellman, smiling into the bright faces,
"but we have stopped this time merely to leave Ruth for the day,
unless she will be in the way of the boys."</p>

<p>"Do ye hear <em>that</em>?" asked the aggrieved Mike; "it’s our
intuition to kaap her a waak at least and longer if her folks
will consint."</p>

<p>"This time she is to spend the day."</p>

<p>"A day is twenty-four hours long," insinuated the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"But a work day is half or less than half of that," insisted
the mother.</p>

<p>"This isn’t going to be a <em>work</em> day but a <em>play</em>
day, as Jerry Donovan said after the bull had chased him a mile
and was gaining on him all the time."</p>

<p>"I guess we shall have to compromise, wife," remarked the husband,
"and leave Stubby here until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is no way of escaping it; Mike, you hear the
agreement; you and Alvin and Chester must bring Ruth home to-morrow
at this hour."</p>

<p>"Ye hev me promise," and the other two bowed their heads.</p>

<p>"We are on our way to meet Uncle Elk, as I believe you call him,"
added the physician; "he should drop in on us but, as has been
said, we can afford to waive ceremony when in the backwoods. Mrs.
Spellman has never seen him—nor have I for that matter—and we
want to make his acquaintance."</p>

<p>"You will find him one of nature’s noblemen; we are likely to
see him here at any time."</p>

<p>The leader looked toward the margin of the woods, as if he expected
the coming of their Instructor in Woodcraft, but he did not appear.
The mother gave a few words of advice to her child, who did not
seem to hear or at least to understand one of them, and then was
assisted into the canoe, followed by her husband and the couple
took their departure, heading eastward.</p>

<p>Before leaving, the physician repeated his proffer of services
should any of the party find himself in need of them. The Scouts
cheered him and his wife as they glided along the shore of the
lake, the daughter withdrawing her attention from her new friends
long enough to blow kisses to her parents.</p>

<p>Cousin Mike naturally took charge of Sunbeam, who as naturally
gave herself over to his care, although the others postponed their
departure to their fields of exploration and amusement for the
sake of enjoying her company for the time.</p>

<p>When Corporal George Robe came forward to speak to the child,
Mike waved him off.</p>

<p>"Howld on, me bye; ye haven’t been properly inthrodooced to the
young leddy, who is Queen of Gosling Lake."</p>

<p>The good-natured corporal looked inquiringly into the grave face
of the guardian.</p>

<p>"If ye hev no objection, Sunbeam," said Mike, in his loftiest
manner, "I take the liberty of presinting Corporal Robe of the
Wolf Patrol to yer leddyship. He isn’t half as purty as he thinks
he is, which is the difference between him and mesilf."</p>

<p>The smiling corporal offered his hand to Ruth, who looked shyly
up at him and startled every one by the abrupt question: "Can
you stand on your head?"</p>

<p>"Of course he can," Mike hastened to answer; "he prefers to stand
on his head instid of his feet; whin he slaaps at night he always
rists his shoes aginst the ceiling with his head on the flure,
which is that soft it sarves fur a piller. Corporal, stand on
yer head fur the Queen."</p>

<p>The lad tried to back out, but all the others were vociferously
insistent and he was wise enough to make a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p>"I’ll do anything for you," said he cheerfully; "give me room,
boys."</p>

<p>All stepped back, leaving an open space on the beach for Robe
to exhibit his acrobatic skill. He laid aside his hat, examined
the ground for a few seconds, walked a pace or two and then, amid
the hush, leaned over with the palms of his hands on the earth.
He rested the crown of his head against the ground, his body being
curved like a horseshoe, and then gently pushed upward with his
toes.</p>

<p>At first he did not rise far enough, and dropped back again,
but he kept up the effort, coming nearer and nearer the perpendicular,
but still falling a little short.</p>

<p>"Put more power in yer legs," called Mike, "and don’t be so top-heavy."</p>

<p>"You are not half trying!" shouted several of the spectators;
"there isn’t so much of you to lift from the ground."</p>

<p>Spurred by the taunts, the corporal made so vigorous an effort
that he went too far and landed on his back with a thump that
made him grunt. Sunbeam clapped her hands and all laughed. The
corporal did not crack so much as a smile, but instantly renewed
his efforts with the resolution to do or die. Paying no heed to
the vehement suggestions, he solved the problem by clutching the
grass with each hand and holding fast. Thus when his legs pointed
skyward, he was able to preserve his balance and maintain a wabbling
verticality. He wavered for a time but finally got the right pose
and cracked the heels of his shoes together in triumph. Then proudly
bounding to his feet and clapping on his hat he called to Mike:</p>

<p>"Now, let’s see <em>you</em> do better than that."</p>

<p>"I could do the same wid me eyes shet and me hands tied behind
me, but it would not be fitting to me dignity; I’m superintendent
and give orders. What would the Queen like to hev done nixt?"</p>

<p>She was puzzled for a moment.</p>

<p>"Can you run fast?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I’m the champion of Gosling Lake; I run so fast that out of
pity fur these lumbering coal carts I save their feelings by refusing
to run wid ’em. Would ye like to obsarve a fut race?"</p>

<p>"Yes,—oh yes; I’ll run with you all."</p>

<p>The thought had come to the girl like an inspiration, as she
showed by her favorite act of clapping her hands and laughing.</p>

<p>The whole party were filled with delight.</p>

<p>"I must tell you that I can run awful fast," warned Sunbeam,
as preparations were begun for the test of speed; "I beat my father
and mother every time we race."</p>

<p>"Ye don’t till me!" exclaimed Mike as if frightened; "we’ll hev
to do our darnedst, and angels could do no more; but, Sunbeam,"
he added impressively, "ye mustn’t let up, but show us no mercy."</p>

<p>"I’ll try," she said with a shake of her head.</p>

<p>The preparations were simple and soon completed. Scout Master
Hall was requested to act as umpire and complied. The beach sloped
gently with a varying width of a rod or more. In order to give
play to legs and arms, Mike arranged the contestants in two lines,
one behind the other. Then he gravely paced off a distance of
about a hundred yards, drawing a deep line in the earth by a sweep
of the toe of his shoe, to mark the terminus of the course. Umpire
Hall stationed himself a short distance back of this, so as not
to be in the way of the runners. Mike next placed Sunbeam in front
of the two lines and gave his final orders.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hall will count one-two-three, and at the last word all
will start and run like blazes fur the line I marked wid me toe.
Ye must overtake and pass Sunbeam in order to win the race, and
I wish to add—"</p>

<p>Here he stepped to the eager forms and lowered his voice so that
Ruth could not hear his words——</p>

<p>"It is onnecessary on me part to warn ye that if by any trickery,
desaat, chicanery, or unfair maans, one of ye should overtake
the Queen, the aforesaid villain will have only two minutes to
live. Mind, this is to be an honest race, as Tom Mugges said whin
he chased a railroad train."</p>

<p>A general nodding of heads showed that all "caught on."</p>

<p>One of the necessities when a lad engages in a desperate foot
race is first to spit on his hands and rub the palms together.
Every Boy Scout went through that preliminary, grunted, inched
forward, crowded his companions on the right and left, spoke sharp
words of reproach and intently watched the distant umpire for
the word. Since he was master of ceremonies, Mike took no part
in the contest, but stepped aside and watched proceedings, so
as to make sure his warning was heeded.</p>

<p>"Patrol Leader Chase, I obsarve that ye are grinning, showing
the same waakness that the girls do whin they see me approaching.
Iron out yer face."</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader did his best to obey, but could not quite succeed.</p>

<p>"Captain Landon, ye have turned the toe of yer right fut in,
which is against the rules; p’int the same outward, and save me
the necissity of mashing it. Second Mate Haynes, I saw ye take
off yer hat jest now and scratch yer hid; don’t do it agin, though
of course it’s solid. Corporal Robe, ye still seem to think ye
are standing on yer head. Bear in mind that ye’re right side up
and it depinds upon yersilf how long ye stay so."</p>

<p>Mike made clear the understanding to Sunbeam, who laughingly
nodded several times, glanced over her shoulder and was in a tremor
of excitement. Then he waved his hand to the umpire who from his
station a hundred yards away was watching proceedings.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" called Scout Master Hall.</p>

<p>"Riddy," replied Mike.</p>

<p>In a loud voice the umpire shouted—</p>

<p>"One—two—three!"</p>

<p>And immediately the race was on. Sunbeam came flying like a bird
down the course, her small feet twinkling as they doubled swiftly
under her, her hair streaming straight away, while she struck
a speed which in the circumstances was remarkable.</p>

<p>And how those Boy Scouts did exert themselves! Every one grunted;
most of the eyes seemed to be popping out of their heads; a good
many held their breath or tried to do so, and all appeared to
be putting forth the most strenuous exertions to overtake the
fawn-like figure darting down the course, continually glancing
behind her, and not forgetting to scream with delight, for she
was certainly holding her own, and strive as much as they might,
there wasn’t a lad that seemed able to lessen the distance between
himself and the little one.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, the stocky form of Corporal Robe drew slightly
ahead of the others. This was strange, for, with the exception
of Mike Murphy, he was the slowest sprinter in the whole troop.
The director was able to keep pace beside the boys, and observing
the shameful trickery of the corporal, shook his fist at him.</p>

<p>Just then Robe stubbed his toe—or seemed to do so—tumbled on
his hands and knees and rolled over. Kenneth Henke right behind
him, knew no better than to dive in a heap over him; Ernest Oberlander
and Colgate Craig then mixed in, and after them came Kenneth Mitchell,
Alvin Landon, Bobby Snow, Hubert Wood, Bobby Rice, Chester Haynes,
Harold Hopkins and so many others that it isn’t worth while to
mention their names. In fact, it looked as if it were a football
game in which the corporal was heading for the goal posts when
he was downed and all the rest of the players piled on top of
him.</p>

<p>By the time the mass could disentangle itself and the dazed runners
resume their wild dash for victory, Sunbeam bounded across the
line, whirled about and, jumping up and down, clapped her hands
and of course screamed with joy.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall stood like a sphinx until the rabble came plunging
down the track and drew up in a disorderly crowd in front of him.
Then he raised his hand for silence and called out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Sunbeam wins! You boys ought to be ashamed of yourselves."</p>

<p>The youths tried hard to look as if they were dejected over their
disgrace. Several gouged their eyes; others muttered their discontent,
and Chester Haynes had the audacity to declare loud enough for
all to hear:</p>

<p>"Looks very much as if the ‘empire’ had money on the race."</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall must have heard the insulting words, but, if
so, he showed no evidence of it. Then the defeated runners recovered
from their humiliation sufficiently to crowd around the victor
and congratulate her on her success.</p>

<p>"It’s larned ’em a lesson," said Mike, "which the same is not
to be so cocksure of their smartness whin they haven’t got any
smartness to be cocksure of. But for this desarved defeat some
of ’em would have the imperdence to challenge <em>me</em> to a
foot race."</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts were so charmed by the sweet innocence of the
"Queen" that all remained at home for the remainder of the forenoon.
Alvin drew funny pictures for her on large sheets of paper; Chester
showed no little ingenuity in cutting out dolls and odd figures;
most of the other boys went through scandalous antics for the
sole purpose of winning her applause, while Mike sang some of
the lullabies and folk songs he had learned in Ireland. When he
did this, everything else was hushed and all became listeners,
for the charm of that wonderful voice was irresistible.</p>

<p>At the dinner table the guest was set in a chair elevated for
the occasion, and presided like a veritable queen. Every hearer
bowed his head when she folded her hands, closed her eyes, looked
upward and said:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"O Lord, who giveth all things good,<br/>
To whom the ravens look for food,<br/>
Deign to look on us from heaven,<br/>
And bless the food that thou hast given."

</p>
</div>
<p>There was a general scattering of the boys in the afternoon,
though Mike, Alvin, Chester and Mr. Hall remained behind with
their visitor, it not being thought prudent to take her on a ramble
in the woods, while they were so damp.</p>

<p>It was a rare treat in the evening, when by the light of the
fire and the lamp overhead, all the company gave themselves up
to amusing and being amused by their Queen, Scout Master Hall
pleased the lads no less than the girl by his fairy stories, and
again Mike sang with inimitable sweetness. Thus it went on until
the "sandman" called on Sunbeam and she drowsily said she guessed
it was time for her to sleep. The most luxurious couch in the
bungalow was set apart for her; the leader and Mike gave what
slight help she needed in preparing for bed, and she said her
prayers at the knee of the Irish youth, who tenderly laid his
hand on the silken mass of hair and murmured:</p>

<p>"Of such is the kingdom of heaven." </p>
