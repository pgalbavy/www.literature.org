<p>All that the boatswain, out of a superabundance of yells, could
make clear to Captain MacWhirr was the bizarre intelligence that
"All them Chinamen in the fore 'tween deck have fetched away,
sir."</p>

<p>Jukes to leeward could hear these two shouting within six inches
of his face, as you may hear on a still night half a mile away
two men conversing across a field. He heard Captain MacWhirr's
exasperated "What? What?" and the strained pitch of the other's
hoarseness. "In a lump . . . seen them myself. . . . Awful sight,
sir . . . thought . . . tell you."</p>

<p>Jukes remained indifferent, as if rendered irresponsible by the
force of the hurricane, which made the very thought of action
utterly vain. Besides, being very young, he had found the occupation
of keeping his heart completely steeled against the worst so engrossing
that he had come to feel an overpowering dislike towards any other
form of activity whatever. He was not scared; he knew this because,
firmly believing he would never see another sunrise, he remained
calm in that belief.</p>

<p>These are the moments of do-nothing heroics to which even good
men surrender at times. Many officers of ships can no doubt recall
a case in their experience when just such a trance of confounded
stoicism would come all at once over a whole ship's company. Jukes,
however, had no wide experience of men or storms. He conceived
himself to be calm&mdash;inexorably calm; but as a matter of fact he
was daunted; not abjectly, but only so far as a decent man may,
without becoming loathsome to himself.</p>

<p>It was rather like a forced-on numbness of spirit. The long,
long stress of a gale does it; the suspense of the interminably
culminating catastrophe; and there is a bodily fatigue in the
mere holding on to existence within the excessive tumult; a searching
and insidious fatigue that penetrates deep into a man's breast
to cast down and sadden his heart, which is incorrigible, and
of all the gifts of the earth&mdash;even before life itself&mdash;aspires
to peace.</p>

<p>Jukes was benumbed much more than he supposed. He held on&mdash;very
wet, very cold, stiff in every limb; and in a momentary hallucination
of swift visions (it is said that a drowning man thus reviews
all his life) he beheld all sorts of memories altogether unconnected
with his present situation. He remembered his father, for instance:
a worthy business man, who at an unfortunate crisis in his affairs
went quietly to bed and died forthwith in a state of resignation.
Jukes did not recall these circumstances, of course, but remaining
otherwise unconcerned he seemed to see distinctly the poor man's
face; a certain game of nap played when quite a boy in Table Bay
on board a ship, since lost with all hands; the thick eyebrows
of his first skipper; and without any emotion, as he might years
ago have walked listlessly into her room and found her sitting
there with a book, he remembered his mother&mdash;dead, too, now&mdash;the
resolute woman, left badly off, who had been very firm in his
bringing up.</p>

<p>It could not have lasted more than a second, perhaps not so much.
A heavy arm had fallen about his shoulders; Captain MacWhirr's
voice was speaking his name into his ear.</p>

<p>"Jukes! Jukes!"</p>

<p>He detected the tone of deep concern. The wind had thrown its
weight on the ship, trying to pin her down amongst the seas. They
made a clean breach over her, as over a deep-swimming log; and
the gathered weight of crashes menaced monstrously from afar.
The breakers flung out of the night with a ghostly light on their
crests&mdash;the light of sea-foam that in a ferocious, boiling-up
pale flash showed upon the slender body of the ship the toppling
rush, the downfall, and the seething mad scurry of each wave.
Never for a moment could she shake herself clear of the water;
Jukes, rigid, perceived in her motion the ominous sign of haphazard
floundering. She was no longer struggling intelligently. It was
the beginning of the end; and the note of busy concern in Captain
MacWhirr's voice sickened him like an exhibition of blind and
pernicious folly.</p>

<p>The spell of the storm had fallen upon Jukes. He was penetrated
by it, absorbed by it; he was rooted in it with a rigour of dumb
attention. Captain MacWhirr persisted in his cries, but the wind
got between them like a solid wedge. He hung round Jukes' neck
as heavy as a millstone, and suddenly the sides of their heads
knocked together.</p>

<p>"Jukes! Mr. Jukes, I say!"</p>

<p>He had to answer that voice that would not be silenced. He answered
in the customary manner: ". . . Yes, sir."</p>

<p>And directly, his heart, corrupted by the storm that breeds a
craving for peace, rebelled against the tyranny of training and
command.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr had his mate's head fixed firm in the crook
of his elbow, and pressed it to his yelling lips mysteriously.
Sometimes Jukes would break in, admonishing hastily: "Look out,
sir!" or Captain MacWhirr would bawl an earnest exhortation to
"Hold hard, there!" and the whole black universe seemed to reel
together with the ship. They paused. She floated yet. And Captain
MacWhirr would resume, his shouts. ". . . . Says . . . whole lot
. . . fetched away. . . . Ought to see . . . what's the matter."</p>

<p>Directly the full force of the hurricane had struck the ship,
every part of her deck became untenable; and the sailors, dazed
and dismayed, took shelter in the port alleyway under the bridge.
It had a door aft, which they shut; it was very black, cold, and
dismal. At each heavy fling of the ship they would groan all together
in the dark, and tons of water could be heard scuttling about
as if trying to get at them from above. The boatswain had been
keeping up a gruff talk, but a more unreasonable lot of men, he
said afterwards, he had never been with. They were snug enough
there, out of harm's way, and not wanted to do anything, either;
and yet they did nothing but grumble and complain peevishly like
so many sick kids. Finally, one of them said that if there had
been at least some light to see each other's noses by, it wouldn't
be so bad. It was making him crazy, he declared, to lie there
in the dark waiting for the blamed hooker to sink.</p>

<p>"Why don't you step outside, then, and be done with it at once?"
the boatswain turned on him.</p>

<p>This called up a shout of execration. The boatswain found himself
overwhelmed with reproaches of all sorts. They seemed to take
it ill that a lamp was not instantly created for them out of nothing.
They would whine after a light to get drowned by&mdash;anyhow! And
though the unreason of their revilings was patent&mdash;since no one
could hope to reach the lamp-room, which was forward&mdash;he became
greatly distressed. He did not think it was decent of them to
be nagging at him like this. He told them so, and was met by general
contumely. He sought refuge, therefore, in an embittered silence.
At the same time their grumbling and sighing and muttering worried
him greatly, but by-and-by it occurred to him that there were
six globe lamps hung in the 'tween-deck, and that there could
be no harm in depriving the coolies of one of them.</p>

<p>The Nan-Shan had an athwartship coal-bunker, which, being at
times used as cargo space, communicated by an iron door with the
fore 'tween-deck. It was empty then, and its manhole was the foremost
one in the alleyway. The boatswain could get in, therefore, without
coming out on deck at all; but to his great surprise he found
he could induce no one to help him in taking off the manhole cover.
He groped for it all the same, but one of the crew lying in his
way refused to budge.</p>

<p>"Why, I only want to get you that blamed light you are crying
for," he expostulated, almost pitifully.</p>

<p>Somebody told him to go and put his head in a bag. He regretted
he could not recognize the voice, and that it was too dark to
see, otherwise, as he said, he would have put a head on that son
of a sea-cook, anyway, sink or swim. Nevertheless, he had made
up his mind to show them he could get a light, if he were to die
for it.</p>

<p>Through the violence of the ship's rolling, every movement was
dangerous. To be lying down seemed labour enough. He nearly broke
his neck dropping into the bunker. He fell on his back, and was
sent shooting helplessly from side to side in the dangerous company
of a heavy iron bar&mdash;a coal-trimmer's slice probably&mdash;left down
there by somebody. This thing made him as nervous as though it
had been a wild beast. He could not see it, the inside of the
bunker coated with coal-dust being perfectly and impenetrably
black; but he heard it sliding and clattering, and striking here
and there, always in the neighbourhood of his head. It seemed
to make an extraordinary noise, too&mdash;to give heavy thumps as though
it had been as big as a bridge girder. This was remarkable enough
for him to notice while he was flung from port to starboard and
back again, and clawing desperately the smooth sides of the bunker
in the endeavour to stop himself. The door into the 'tween-deck
not fitting quite true, he saw a thread of dim light at the bottom.</p>

<p>Being a sailor, and a still active man, he did not want much
of a chance to regain his feet; and as luck would have it, in
scrambling up he put his hand on the iron slice, picking it up
as he rose. Otherwise he would have been afraid of the thing breaking
his legs, or at least knocking him down again. At first he stood
still. He felt unsafe in this darkness that seemed to make the
ship's motion unfamiliar, unforeseen, and difficult to counteract.
He felt so much shaken for a moment that he dared not move for
fear of "taking charge again." He had no mind to get battered
to pieces in that bunker.</p>

<p>He had struck his head twice; he was dazed a little. He seemed
to hear yet so plainly the clatter and bangs of the iron slice
flying about his ears that he tightened his grip to prove to himself
he had it there safely in his hand. He was vaguely amazed at the
plainness with which down there he could hear the gale raging.
Its howls and shrieks seemed to take on, in the emptiness of the
bunker, something of the human character, of human rage and pain&mdash;being
not vast but infinitely poignant. And there were, with every roll,
thumps, too&mdash;profound, ponderous thumps, as if a bulky object
of five-ton weight or so had got play in the hold. But there was
no such thing in the cargo. Something on deck? Impossible. Or
alongside? Couldn't be.</p>

<p>He thought all this quickly, clearly, competently, like a seaman,
and in the end remained puzzled. This noise, though, came deadened
from outside, together with the washing and pouring of water on
deck above his head. Was it the wind? Must be. It made down there
a row like the shouting of a big lot of crazed men. And he discovered
in himself a desire for a light, too&mdash;if only to get drowned by&mdash;and
a nervous anxiety to get out of that bunker as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>He pulled back the bolt: the heavy iron plate turned on its hinges;
and it was as though he had opened the door to the sounds of the
tempest. A gust of hoarse yelling met him: the air was still;
and the rushing of water overhead was covered by a tumult of strangled,
throaty shrieks that produced an effect of desperate confusion.
He straddled his legs the whole width of the doorway and stretched
his neck. And at first he perceived only what he had come to seek:
six small yellow flames swinging violently on the great body of
the dusk.</p>

<p>It was stayed like the gallery of a mine, with a row of stanchions
in the middle, and cross-beams overhead, penetrating into the
gloom ahead&mdash;indefinitely. And to port there loomed, like the
caving in of one of the sides, a bulky mass with a slanting outline.
The whole place, with the shadows and the shapes, moved all the
time. The boatswain glared: the ship lurched to starboard, and
a great howl came from that mass that had the slant of fallen
earth.</p>

<p>Pieces of wood whizzed past. Planks, he thought, inexpressibly
startled, and flinging back his head. At his feet a man went sliding
over, open-eyed, on his back, straining with uplifted arms for
nothing: and another came bounding like a detached stone with
his head between his legs and his hands clenched. His pigtail
whipped in the air; he made a grab at the boatswain's legs, and
from his opened hand a bright white disc rolled against the boatswain's
foot. He recognized a silver dollar, and yelled at it with astonishment.
With a precipitated sound of trampling and shuffling of bare feet,
and with guttural cries, the mound of writhing bodies piled up
to port detached itself from the ship's side and sliding, inert
and struggling, shifted to starboard, with a dull, brutal thump.
The cries ceased. The boatswain heard a long moan through the
roar and whistling of the wind; he saw an inextricable confusion
of heads and shoulders, naked soles kicking upwards, fists raised,
tumbling backs, legs, pigtails, faces.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he cried, horrified, and banged-to the iron door
upon this vision.</p>

<p>This was what he had come on the bridge to tell. He could not
keep it to himself; and on board ship there is only one man to
whom it is worth while to unburden yourself. On his passage back
the hands in the alleyway swore at him for a fool. Why didn't
he bring that lamp? What the devil did the coolies matter to anybody?
And when he came out, the extremity of the ship made what went
on inside of her appear of little moment.</p>

<p>At first he thought he had left the alleyway in the very moment
of her sinking. The bridge ladders had been washed away, but an
enormous sea filling the after-deck floated him up. After that
he had to lie on his stomach for some time, holding to a ring-bolt,
getting his breath now and then, and swallowing salt water. He
struggled farther on his hands and knees, too frightened and distracted
to turn back. In this way he reached the after-part of the wheelhouse.
In that comparatively sheltered spot he found the second mate.</p>

<p>The boatswain was pleasantly surprised&mdash;his impression being
that everybody on deck must have been washed away a long time
ago. He asked eagerly where the Captain was.</p>

<p>The second mate was lying low, like a malignant little animal
under a hedge.</p>

<p>"Captain? Gone overboard, after getting us into this mess." The
mate, too, for all he knew or cared. Another fool. Didn't matter.
Everybody was going by-and-by.</p>

<p>The boatswain crawled out again into the strength of the wind;
not because he much expected to find anybody, he said, but just
to get away from "that man." He crawled out as outcasts go to
face an inclement world. Hence his great joy at finding Jukes
and the Captain. But what was going on in the 'tween-deck was
to him a minor matter by that time. Besides, it was difficult
to make yourself heard. But he managed to convey the idea that
the Chinaman had broken adrift together with their boxes, and
that he had come up on purpose to report this. As to the hands,
they were all right. Then, appeased, he subsided on the deck in
a sitting posture, hugging with his arms and legs the stand of
the engine-room telegraph&mdash;an iron casting as thick as a post.
When that went, why, he expected he would go, too. He gave no
more thought to the coolies.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr had made Jukes understand that he wanted him
to go down below&mdash;to see.</p>

<p>"What am I to do then, sir?" And the trembling of his whole wet
body caused Jukes' voice to sound like bleating.</p>

<p>"See first . . . Boss'n . . . says . . . adrift."</p>

<p>"That boss'n is a confounded fool," howled Jukes, shakily.</p>

<p>The absurdity of the demand made upon him revolted Jukes. He
was as unwilling to go as if the moment he had left the deck the
ship were sure to sink.</p>

<p>"I must know . . . can't leave. . . ."</p>

<p>"They'll settle, sir."</p>

<p>"Fight . . . boss'n says they fight. . . . Why? Can't have .
. . fighting . . . board ship. . . . Much rather keep you here
. . . case . . . I should . . . washed overboard myself. . . .
Stop it . . . some way. You see and tell me . . . through engine-room
tube. Don't want you . . . come up here . . . too often. Dangerous
. . . moving about . . . deck."</p>

<p>Jukes, held with his head in chancery, had to listen to what
seemed horrible suggestions.</p>

<p>"Don't want . . . you get lost . . . so long . . . ship isn't.
. . . . Rout . . . Good man . . . Ship . . . may . . . through
this . . . all right yet."</p>

<p>All at once Jukes understood he would have to go.</p>

<p>"Do you think she may?" he screamed.</p>

<p>But the wind devoured the reply, out of which Jukes heard only
the one word, pronounced with great energy ". . . . Always. .
. ."</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr released Jukes, and bending over the boatswain,
yelled, "Get back with the mate." Jukes only knew that the arm
was gone off his shoulders. He was dismissed with his orders&mdash;to
do what? He was exasperated into letting go his hold carelessly,
and on the instant was blown away. It seemed to him that nothing
could stop him from being blown right over the stern. He flung
himself down hastily, and the boatswain, who was following, fell
on him.</p>

<p>"Don't you get up yet, sir," cried the boatswain. "No hurry!"</p>

<p>A sea swept over. Jukes understood the boatswain to splutter
that the bridge ladders were gone. "I'll lower you down, sir,
by your hands,"  he screamed. He shouted also something about
the smoke-stack being as likely to go overboard as not. Jukes
thought it very possible, and imagined the fires out, the ship
helpless. . . . The boatswain by his side kept on yelling. "What?
What is it?" Jukes cried distressfully; and the other repeated,
"What would my old woman say if she saw me now?"</p>

<p>In the alleyway, where a lot of water had got in and splashed
in the dark, the men were still as death, till Jukes stumbled
against one of them and cursed him savagely for being in the way.
Two or three voices then asked, eager and weak, "Any chance for
us, sir?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you fools?" he said brutally. He felt
as though he could throw himself down amongst them and never move
any more. But they seemed cheered; and in the midst of obsequious
warnings, "Look out! Mind that manhole lid, sir," they lowered
him into the bunker. The boatswain tumbled down after him, and
as soon as he had picked himself up he remarked, "She would say,
'Serve you right, you old fool, for going to sea.'"</p>

<p>The boatswain had some means, and made a point of alluding to
them frequently. His wife&mdash;a fat woman&mdash;and two grown-up daughters
kept a greengrocer's shop in the East-end of London.</p>

<p>In the dark, Jukes, unsteady on his legs, listened to a faint
thunderous patter. A deadened screaming went on steadily at his
elbow, as it were; and from above the louder tumult of the storm
descended upon these near sounds. His head swam. To him, too,
in that bunker, the motion of the ship seemed novel and menacing,
sapping his resolution as though he had never been afloat before.</p>

<p>He had half a mind to scramble out again; but the remembrance
of Captain MacWhirr's voice made this impossible. His orders were
to go and see. What was the good of it, he wanted to know. Enraged,
he told himself he would see&mdash;of course. But the boatswain, staggering
clumsily, warned him to be careful how he opened that door; there
was a blamed fight going on. And Jukes, as if in great bodily
pain, desired irritably to know what the devil they were fighting
for.</p>

<p>"Dollars! Dollars, sir. All their rotten chests got burst open.
Blamed money skipping all over the place, and they are tumbling
after it head over heels&mdash;tearing and biting like anything. A
regular little hell in there."</p>

<p>Jukes convulsively opened the door. The short boatswain peered
under his arm.</p>

<p>One of the lamps had gone out, broken perhaps. Rancorous, guttural
cries burst out loudly on their ears, and a strange panting sound,
the working of all these straining breasts. A hard blow hit the
side of the ship: water fell above with a stunning shock, and
in the forefront of the gloom, where the air was reddish and thick,
Jukes saw a head bang the deck violently, two thick calves waving
on high, muscular arms twined round a naked body, a yellow-face,
open-mouthed and with a set wild stare, look up and slide away.
An empty chest clattered turning over; a man fell head first with
a jump, as if lifted by a kick; and farther off, indistinct, others
streamed like a mass of rolling stones down a bank, thumping the
deck with their feet and flourishing their arms wildly. The hatchway
ladder was loaded with coolies swarming on it like bees on a branch.
They hung on the steps in a crawling, stirring cluster, beating
madly with their fists the underside of the battened hatch, and
the headlong rush of the water above was heard in the intervals
of their yelling. The ship heeled over more, and they began to
drop off: first one, then two, then all the rest went away together,
falling straight off with a great cry.</p>

<p>Jukes was confounded. The boatswain, with gruff anxiety, begged
him, "Don't you go in there, sir."</p>

<p>The whole place seemed to twist upon itself, jumping incessantly
the while; and when the ship rose to a sea Jukes fancied that
all these men would be shot upon him in a body. He backed out,
swung the door to, and with trembling hands pushed at the bolt.
. . .</p>

<p>As soon as his mate had gone Captain MacWhirr, left alone on
the bridge, sidled and staggered as far as the wheelhouse. Its
door being hinged forward, he had to fight the gale for admittance,
and when at last he managed to enter, it was with an instantaneous
clatter and a bang, as though he had been fired through the wood.
He stood within, holding on to the handle.</p>

<p>The steering-gear leaked steam, and in the confined space the
glass of the binnacle made a shiny oval of light in a thin white
fog. The wind howled, hummed, whistled, with sudden booming gusts
that rattled the doors and shutters in the vicious patter of sprays.
Two coils of lead-line and a small canvas bag hung on a long lanyard,
swung wide off, and came back clinging to the bulkheads. The gratings
underfoot were nearly afloat; with every sweeping blow of a sea,
water squirted violently through the cracks all round the door,
and the man at the helm had flung down his cap, his coat, and
stood propped against the gear-casing in a striped cotton shirt
open on his breast. The little brass wheel in his hands had the
appearance of a bright and fragile toy. The cords of his neck
stood hard and lean, a dark patch lay in the hollow of his throat,
and his face was still and sunken as in death.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr wiped his eyes. The sea that had nearly taken
him overboard had, to his great annoyance, washed his sou'-wester
hat off his bald head. The fluffy, fair hair, soaked and darkened,
resembled a mean skein of cotton threads festooned round his bare
skull. His face, glistening with sea-water, had been made crimson
with the wind, with the sting of sprays. He looked as though he
had come off sweating from before a furnace.</p>

<p>"You here?" he muttered, heavily.</p>

<p>The second mate had found his way into the wheelhouse some time
before. He had fixed himself in a corner with his knees up, a
fist pressed against each temple; and this attitude suggested
rage, sorrow, resignation, surrender, with a sort of concentrated
unforgiveness. He said mournfully and defiantly, "Well, it's my
watch below now: ain't it?"</p>

<p>The steam gear clattered, stopped, clattered again; and the helmsman's
eyeballs seemed to project out of a hungry face as if the compass
card behind the binnacle glass had been meat. God knows how long
he had been left there to steer, as if forgotten by all his shipmates.
The bells had not been struck; there had been no reliefs; the
ship's routine had gone down wind; but he was trying to keep her
head north-north-east. The rudder might have been gone for all
he knew, the fires out, the engines broken down, the ship ready
to roll over like a corpse. He was anxious not to get muddled
and lose control of her head, because the compass-card swung far
both ways, wriggling on the pivot, and sometimes seemed to whirl
right round. He suffered from mental stress. He was horribly afraid,
also, of the wheelhouse going. Mountains of water kept on tumbling
against it. When the ship took one of her desperate dives the
corners of his lips twitched.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr looked up at the wheelhouse clock. Screwed to
the bulk-head, it had a white face on which the black hands appeared
to stand quite still. It was half-past one in the morning.</p>

<p>"Another day," he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>The second mate heard him, and lifting his head as one grieving
amongst ruins, "You won't see it break," he exclaimed. His wrists
and his knees could be seen to shake violently. "No, by God! You
won't. . . ."</p>

<p>He took his face again between his fists.</p>

<p>The body of the helmsman had moved slightly, but his head didn't
budge on his neck,&mdash;like a stone head fixed to look one way from
a column. During a roll that all but took his booted legs from
under him, and in the very stagger to save himself, Captain MacWhirr
said austerely, "Don't you pay any attention to what that man
says." And then, with an indefinable change of tone, very grave,
he added, "He isn't on duty."</p>

<p>The sailor said nothing.</p>

<p>The hurricane boomed, shaking the little place, which seemed
air-tight; and the light of the binnacle flickered all the time.</p>

<p>"You haven't been relieved," Captain MacWhirr went on, looking
down. "I want you to stick to the helm, though, as long as you
can. You've got the hang of her. Another man coming here might
make a mess of it. Wouldn't do. No child's play. And the hands
are probably busy with a job down below. . . . Think you can?"</p>

<p>The steering-gear leaped into an abrupt short clatter, stopped
smouldering like an ember; and the still man, with a motionless
gaze, burst out, as if all the passion in him had gone into his
lips: "By Heavens, sir! I can steer for ever if nobody talks to
me."</p>

<p>"Oh! aye! All right. . . ." The Captain lifted his eyes for the
first time to the man, ". . . Hackett."</p>

<p>And he seemed to dismiss this matter from his mind. He stooped
to the engine-room speaking-tube, blew in, and bent his head.
Mr. Rout below answered, and at once Captain MacWhirr put his
lips to the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>With the uproar of the gale around him he applied alternately
his lips and his ear, and the engineer's voice mounted to him,
harsh and as if out of the heat of an engagement. One of the stokers
was disabled, the others had given in, the second engineer and
the donkey-man were firing-up. The third engineer was standing
by the steam-valve. The engines were being tended by hand. How
was it above?</p>

<p>"Bad enough. It mostly rests with you," said Captain MacWhirr.
Was the mate down there yet? No? Well, he would be presently.
Would Mr. Rout let him talk through the speaking-tube?&mdash;through
the deck speaking-tube, because he&mdash;the Captain&mdash;was going out
again on the bridge directly. There was some trouble amongst the
Chinamen. They were fighting, it seemed. Couldn't allow fighting
anyhow. . . .</p>

<p>Mr. Rout had gone away, and Captain MacWhirr could feel against
his ear the pulsation of the engines, like the beat of the ship's
heart. Mr. Rout's voice down there shouted something distantly.
The ship pitched headlong, the pulsation leaped with a hissing
tumult, and stopped dead. Captain MacWhirr's face was impassive,
and his eyes were fixed aimlessly on the crouching shape of the
second mate. Again Mr. Rout's voice cried out in the depths, and
the pulsating beats recommenced, with slow strokes&mdash;growing swifter.</p>

<p>Mr. Rout had returned to the tube. "It don't matter much what
they do,"  he said, hastily; and then, with irritation, "She takes
these dives as if she never meant to come up again."</p>

<p>"Awful sea," said the Captain's voice from above.</p>

<p>"Don't let me drive her under," barked Solomon Rout up the pipe.</p>

<p>"Dark and rain. Can't see what's coming," uttered the voice.
"Must&mdash;keep&mdash;her&mdash;moving&mdash;enough to steer&mdash;and chance it," it
went on to state distinctly.</p>

<p>"I am doing as much as I dare."</p>

<p>"We are&mdash;getting&mdash;smashed up&mdash;a good deal up here," proceeded
the voice mildly. "Doing&mdash;fairly well&mdash;though. Of course, if the
wheelhouse should go. . . ."</p>

<p>Mr. Rout, bending an attentive ear, muttered peevishly something
under his breath.</p>

<p>But the deliberate voice up there became animated to ask: "Jukes
turned up yet?" Then, after a short wait, "I wish he would bear
a hand. I want him to be done and come up here in case of anything.
To look after the ship. I am all alone. The second mate's lost.
. . ."</p>

<p>"What?" shouted Mr. Rout into the engine-room, taking his head
away. Then up the tube he cried, "Gone overboard?" and clapped
his ear to.</p>

<p>"Lost his nerve," the voice from above continued in a matter-of-fact
tone. "Damned awkward circumstance."</p>

<p>Mr. Rout, listening with bowed neck, opened his eyes wide at
this. However, he heard something like the sounds of a scuffle
and broken exclamations coming down to him. He strained his hearing;
and all the time Beale, the third engineer, with his arms uplifted,
held between the palms of his hands the rim of a little black
wheel projecting at the side of a big copper pipe.</p>

<p>He seemed to be poising it above his head, as though it were
a correct attitude in some sort of game.</p>

<p>To steady himself, he pressed his shoulder against the white
bulkhead, one knee bent, and a sweat-rag tucked in his belt hanging
on his hip. His smooth cheek was begrimed and flushed, and the
coal dust on his eyelids, like the black pencilling of a make-up,
enhanced the liquid brilliance of the whites, giving to his youthful
face something of a feminine, exotic and fascinating aspect. When
the ship pitched he would with hasty movements of his hands screw
hard at the little wheel.</p>

<p>"Gone crazy," began the Captain's voice suddenly in the tube.
"Rushed at me. . . . Just now. Had to knock him down. . . . This
minute. You heard, Mr. Rout?"</p>

<p>"The devil!" muttered Mr. Rout. "Look out, Beale!"</p>

<p>His shout rang out like the blast of a warning trumpet, between
the iron walls of the engine-room. Painted white, they rose high
into the dusk of the skylight, sloping like a roof; and the whole
lofty space resembled the interior of a monument, divided by floors
of iron grating, with lights flickering at different levels, and
a mass of gloom lingering in the middle, within the columnar stir
of machinery under the motionless swelling of the cylinders. A
loud and wild resonance, made up of all the noises of the hurricane,
dwelt in the still warmth of the air. There was in it the smell
of hot metal, of oil, and a slight mist of steam. The blows of
the sea seemed to traverse it in an unringing, stunning shock,
from side to side.</p>

<p>Gleams, like pale long flames, trembled upon the polish of metal;
from the flooring below the enormous crank-heads emerged in their
turns with a flash of brass and steel&mdash;going over; while the connecting-rods,
big-jointed, like skeleton limbs, seemed to thrust them down and
pull them up again with an irresistible precision. And deep in
the half-light other rods dodged deliberately to and fro, crossheads
nodded, discs of metal rubbed smoothly against each other, slow
and gentle, in a commingling of shadows and gleams.</p>

<p>Sometimes all those powerful and unerring movements would slow
down simultaneously, as if they had been the functions of a living
organism, stricken suddenly by the blight of languor; and Mr.
Rout's eyes would blaze darker in his long sallow face. He was
fighting this fight in a pair of carpet slippers. A short shiny
jacket barely covered his loins, and his white wrists protruded
far out of the tight sleeves, as though the emergency had added
to his stature, had lengthened his limbs, augmented his pallor,
hollowed his eyes.</p>

<p>He moved, climbing high up, disappearing low down, with a restless,
purposeful industry, and when he stood still, holding the guard-rail
in front of the starting-gear, he would keep glancing to the right
at the steam-gauge, at the water-gauge, fixed upon the white wall
in the light of a swaying lamp. The mouths of two speaking-tubes
gaped stupidly at his elbow, and the dial of the engine-room telegraph
resembled a clock of large diameter, bearing on its face curt
words instead of figures. The grouped letters stood out heavily
black, around the pivot-head of the indicator, emphatically symbolic
of loud exclamations: <em>AHEAD, ASTERN, SLOW, </em>Half, <em>STAND
BY; </em>and the fat black hand pointed downwards to the word
<em>FULL, </em>which, thus singled out, captured the eye as a
sharp cry secures attention.</p>

<p>The wood-encased bulk of the low-pressure cylinder, frowning
portly from above, emitted a faint wheeze at every thrust, and
except for that low hiss the engines worked their steel limbs
headlong or slow with a silent, determined smoothness. And all
this, the white walls, the moving steel, the floor plates under
Solomon Rout's feet, the floors of iron grating above his head,
the dusk and the gleams, uprose and sank continuously, with one
accord, upon the harsh wash of the waves against the ship's side.
The whole loftiness of the place, booming hollow to the great
voice of the wind, swayed at the top like a tree, would go over
bodily, as if borne down this way and that by the tremendous blasts.</p>

<p>"You've got to hurry up," shouted Mr. Rout, as soon as he saw
Jukes appear in the stokehold doorway.</p>

<p>Jukes' glance was wandering and tipsy; his red face was puffy,
as though he had overslept himself. He had had an arduous road,
and had travelled over it with immense vivacity, the agitation
of his mind corresponding to the exertions of his body. He had
rushed up out of the bunker, stumbling in the dark alleyway amongst
a lot of bewildered men who, trod upon, asked "What's up, sir?"
in awed mutters all round him;&mdash;down the stokehold ladder, missing
many iron rungs in his hurry, down into a place deep as a well,
black as Tophet, tipping over back and forth like a see-saw. The
water in the bilges thundered at each roll, and lumps of coal
skipped to and fro, from end to end, rattling like an avalanche
of pebbles on a slope of iron.</p>

<p>Somebody in there moaned with pain, and somebody else could be
seen crouching over what seemed the prone body of a dead man;
a lusty voice blasphemed; and the glow under each fire-door was
like a pool of flaming blood radiating quietly in a velvety blackness.</p>

<p>A gust of wind struck upon the nape of Jukes' neck and next moment
he felt it streaming about his wet ankles. The stokehold ventilators
hummed: in front of the six fire-doors two wild figures, stripped
to the waist, staggered and stooped, wrestling with two shovels.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Plenty of draught now," yelled the second engineer at
once, as though he had been all the time looking out for Jukes.
The donkeyman, a dapper little chap with a dazzling fair skin
and a tiny, gingery moustache, worked in a sort of mute transport.
They were keeping a full head of steam, and a profound rumbling,
as of an empty furniture van trotting over a bridge, made a sustained
bass to all the other noises of the place.</p>

<p>"Blowing off all the time," went on yelling the second. With
a sound as of a hundred scoured saucepans, the orifice of a ventilator
spat upon his shoulder a sudden gush of salt water, and he volleyed
a stream of curses upon all things on earth including his own
soul, ripping and raving, and all the time attending to his business.
With a sharp clash of metal the ardent pale glare of the fire
opened upon his bullet head, showing his spluttering lips, his
insolent face, and with another clang closed like the white-hot
wink of an iron eye.</p>

<p>"Where's the blooming ship? Can you tell me? blast my eyes! Under
water&mdash;or what? It's coming down here in tons. Are the condemned
cowls gone to Hades? Hey? Don't you know anything&mdash;you jolly sailor-man
you . . . ?"</p>

<p>Jukes, after a bewildered moment, had been helped by a roll to
dart through; and as soon as his eyes took in the comparative
vastness, peace and brilliance of the engine-room, the ship, setting
her stern heavily in the water, sent him charging head down upon
Mr. Rout.</p>

<p>The chief's arm, long like a tentacle, and straightening as if
worked by a spring, went out to meet him, and deflected his rush
into a spin towards the speaking-tubes. At the same time Mr. Rout
repeated earnestly:</p>

<p>"You've got to hurry up, whatever it is."</p>

<p>Jukes yelled "Are you there, sir?" and listened. Nothing. Suddenly
the roar of the wind fell straight into his ear, but presently
a small voice shoved aside the shouting hurricane quietly.</p>

<p>"You, Jukes? &mdash;Well?"</p>

<p>Jukes was ready to talk: it was only time that seemed to be wanting.
It was easy enough to account for everything. He could perfectly
imagine the coolies battened down in the reeking 'tween-deck,
lying sick and scared between the rows of chests. Then one of
these chests&mdash;or perhaps several at once&mdash;breaking loose in a
roll, knocking out others, sides splitting, lids flying open,
and all these clumsy Chinamen rising up in a body to save their
property. Afterwards every fling of the ship would hurl that tramping,
yelling mob here and there, from side to side, in a whirl of smashed
wood, torn clothing, rolling dollars. A struggle once started,
they would be unable to stop themselves. Nothing could stop them
now except main force. It was a disaster. He had seen it, and
that was all he could say. Some of them must be dead, he believed.
The rest would go on fighting. . . .</p>

<p>He sent up his words, tripping over each other, crowding the
narrow tube. They mounted as if into a silence of an enlightened
comprehension dwelling alone up there with a storm. And Jukes
wanted to be dismissed from the face of that odious trouble intruding
on the great need of the ship.</p>
