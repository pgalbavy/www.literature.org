<p>Further conversation justified the astonishment of Harvey Hamilton.
The countryman, who gave his name as Abisha Wharton, showed a
knowledge of aviation and heavier-than-air machines such as few
amateurs possess. In the midst of his bright remarks he abruptly
checked himself.</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>Harvey glanced at the little watch on his wrist.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes of six."</p>

<p>"You two will take supper with me."</p>

<p>Bohunkus Johnson, who had been silently listening while the three
were standing, heaved an enormous sigh.</p>

<p>"Dat’s what I’se been waitin’ to hear mentioned eber since we
landed; yas, we’ll take supper wid yo’; I neber was so hungry
in my life."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your kindness, which I accept on condition that
we pay you or your wife for it. We have started on an outing,
and that is our rule."</p>

<p>"I didn’t have that in mind when I spoke, but if you insist on
giving the old lady a little tip, we sha’n’t quarrel; leastways
I know <em>she</em> won’t."</p>

<p>"That is settled then. Now I should like to hire you to do me
a favor. I don’t suppose you keep gasoline in your home?"</p>

<p>"Never had a drop; we use only candles and such light as the
fire on the hearth gives."</p>

<p>"How near is there a store where we can buy the stuff?"</p>

<p>"I suppose Peters has it, for he sells everything from a toothpick
to a folding bed. He keeps the main store at Darbytown, two miles
away. I drive there nearly every day."</p>

<p>"Will you do so now, and buy me ten gallons of gasoline and two
gallons of cylinder oil?"</p>

<p>"I don’t see why I shouldn’t; certainly I’ll do it. Do you want
it right off?"</p>

<p>"Can you go to town and back before dark?"</p>

<p>"My horse isn’t noted for his swiftness," replied Abisha with
a grin, "but I can come purty nigh making it, if I start now."</p>

<p>"Dat’s a good idee; while yo’s gone, Harv and me can put ourselves
outside ob dat supper dat yo’ remarked about."</p>

<p>Harvey’s first thought was to accompany his new friend to the
village, but when he saw the rickety animal and the dilapidated
wagon to which he was soon harnessed, he forebore out of consideration
for the brute. Besides, it looked as if he was likely to fail
with the task. Accordingly, our young friend handed a five-dollar
bill to his host and repeated his instructions. Then he and Bohunkus
sauntered to the rude porch, where Mrs. Wharton came forth at
the call of her husband, and was introduced to the visitors, whose
names were given by Harvey. She promised that the evening meal
should suit them and passed inside to look after its preparation.</p>

<p>The winding wagon road was well marked, and Abisha Wharton, seated
in the front of his rattling vehicle, struck his bony horse so
smart a blow that the animal broke into a loping trot, and speedily
passed from sight among the trees in the direction of Darbytown.
Harvey and Bohunkus, having nothing to hold their attention, strolled
to the woodpile and sat down on one of the small logs lying there,
awaiting cutting into proper length and size for the old-fashioned
stove in the kitchen. A few minutes later the wife came out and
gathered all that was ready for use. As she straightened up, she
remarked with a sniff:</p>

<p>"That Abisha Wharton is too lazy ever to cut ’nough wood to last
a day; all he keers about is to smoke his pipe, or fish, or read
his papers and books."</p>

<p>When she had gone in, Harvey said to his companion:</p>

<p>"We haven’t anything to do for an hour or so; let’s make ourselves
useful."</p>

<p>"I’m agreeable," replied Bohunkus, lifting one of the heavy pieces
and depositing it in the two X’s which formed the wood horse.
The saw lay near and was fairly sharp. The colored youth was powerful
and had good wind. He bent to work with a vigor that soon severed
the piece in the middle. He immediately picked up another to subject
it to the same process, while Harvey swung the rather dull axe
and split the wood for the stove. It was all clean white hickory,
with so straight a grain that a slight blow caused it to break
apart. The work was light and Harvey offered to relieve his companion
at the saw.</p>

<p>"Don’t bodder me; dis am fun; besides," added Bohunkus, "I cac’late
to make it up when I git at de supper table; I tell yo’, Harv,
yo’ll hab to gib dat lady a big tip."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall if I wish to save her from losing on you."</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the two wrought without stopping to rest.
By that time, most of the wood was cut and heaped into a sightly
pile. The odor of the hickory was fragrant, and it made a pretty
sight, besides which we all know that it has hardly a superior
for fuel, unless it be applewood.</p>

<p>By and by the woman of the house came to the door and looked
at the two boys. She was delighted, for she saw enough wood ready
cut for the stove to last her for a week at least. Bohunkus was
bending over the saw horse with one knee on the stick, while a
tiny stream of grains shot out above and below, keeping time with
the motion of the implement, and Harvey swung the axe aloft with
an effect that kept the respective tasks equal. Gazing at them
for a moment, the housewife called:</p>

<p>"Supper’s waiting!"</p>

<p>"So am I!" replied Bohunkus, who, having a stick partly sawn
in two worked with such energy that the projecting end quickly
fell to the ground. Harvey would not allow him to leave until
the pieces were split and piled upon the others.</p>

<p>"Now let us each carry in an armful."</p>

<p>They loaded themselves, and Harvey led the way into the house,
where the smiling woman directed them to the kitchen. There being
no box they dumped the wood upon the floor, then seated themselves
at the table, and she waited upon them.</p>

<p>Despite her untidy appearance, Mrs. Wharton gave them an abundant
and well-cooked meal, to which it need not be said both did justice.
They were blessed with good appetites, Bohunkus especially being
noted at home for his capacity in that line. They pleased the
hostess by their compliments, but more so by their enjoyment of
the meal.</p>

<p>It was a mild, balmy night, and at the suggestion of the woman
they carried their stools outside and sat in front of the house
and on the edge of the clearing, to await the return of the master
of the household. Sooner than they expected, they heard the rattle
of the wheels and the sound of his voice, as he urged his tired
animal onward. It took but a few minutes for him to unfasten,
water and lead him to the stable. Then the man came forward and
greeted his friends.</p>

<p>"How did you make out?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"I got what I went after, of course; the gasoline and oil are
in the wagon, and there’s about three dollars coming to you."</p>

<p>"Which you will keep," replied Harvey. "We have finished an excellent
meal and shall wait here for you if you don’t mind."</p>

<p>"I’m agreeable to anything," remarked the man, as he slouched
inside, where by the light of a candle he ate the evening meal
with his wife. Our friends could not help hearing what she said,
for she had a sharp voice and spoke in a high key. She berated
him for his shiftlessness and declared he ought to be ashamed
to allow two strangers to saw and split the wood which had too
long awaited his attention. She made other observations that it
is not worth while to repeat, but evidently the man was used to
nagging, for it did not affect his appetite and he only grunted
now and then by way of reply or to signify that he heard.</p>

<p>When Abisha brought out his chair and lighted his corncob pipe,
it was fully dark. The night was without a moon, and the sky had
so clouded that only here and there a twinkling star showed.</p>

<p>"Do you ever fly at night?" asked their host.</p>

<p>"We have never done so," replied Harvey, "because there is nothing
to be gained and it is dangerous."</p>

<p>"Why dangerous?"</p>

<p>"We can’t carry enough gasoline to keep us in the air more than
two hours, and it is a risky thing to land in the darkness. If
I hadn’t caught sight of this open space, it would have gone hard
with us even when the sun was shining."</p>

<p>"It’s a wonderful discovery," repeated Wharton, as if speaking
with himself, "but a lot of improvements will have to be made.
One of them is to carry more gasoline or find some stuff that
will serve better. How long has anyone been able to sail with
an aeroplane without landing?"</p>

<p>"I believe the record is something like five hours."</p>

<p>"In two or three years or less time, they will keep aloft for
a day or more. They’ll have to do it in order to cross the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"There is little prospect of ever doing that."</p>

<p>"Wellman tried it in a balloon, but was not able to make more
than a start."</p>

<p>"I agree with you that the day is not distant when the Atlantic
will be crossed as regularly by heavier-than-air machines as it
is by the <em>Mauretania</em> and <em>Lusitania</em>, but in the
meantime we have got to make many improvements; that of carrying
enough fuel being the most important."</p>

<p>At this point Bohunkus felt that an observation was due from
him.</p>

<p>"Humph! it’s easy ’nough to fix dat."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Hab reg’lar gasumline stations all de way ’cross de ocean, so
dat anyone can stop and load up when he wants to."</p>

<p>"How would you keep the stations in place?" gravely inquired
Wharton.</p>

<p>"Anchor ’em, ob course."</p>

<p>"But the ocean is several miles in depth in many portions."</p>

<p>"What ob dat? Can’t you make chains or ropes dat long? Seems
to me some folks is mighty dumb."</p>

<p>"I’ve noticed that myself," remarked the host without a smile.
Failing to catch the drift of his comment, Bohunkus held his peace
for the next few minutes, but in the middle of a remark by his
companion, he suddenly leaped to his feet with the gasping question:</p>

<p>"What’s dat?" </p>
