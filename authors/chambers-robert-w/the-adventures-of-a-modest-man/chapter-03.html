"<em>DEAR JIM<br/>
&</em>mdash;Everything is spoiled, after all! Father's failing health<br/>
has suddenly become a serious matter, and we are going to try the<br/>
'nature cure,' or whatever they call it, at Avalon Island. I had no<br/>
idea he was really ill. Evidently he is alarmed, for we have only<br/>
been here six days, and in a few minutes we are to start for<br/>
Avalon. Isn't it perfectly horrid? And to think that you are<br/>
coming this evening and expecting to find us here!

</p>
<p>
"Father says you can't come to Avalon; that only invalids are<br/>
received (I didn't know I was one, but it seems I'm to take the<br/>
treatment, too!), and he says that nobody is received for less<br/>
than a month's treatment, so I suppose that bars you even if you<br/>
were self-sacrificing enough to endure a 'nature cure' for the<br/>
pleasure of spending two weeks with [<em>me</em>, crossed out] us.

</p>
<p>
"I'm actually on the verge of tears when I think of all we had<br/>
planned to do together! And there's my maid at the door, knocking.<br/>
Good-by. You will write, won't you?

<p><em>Mr. James Harroll to Miss Catharine Delancy, Avalon, Balboa
County, Florida.</em></p>

<p>  "<em>HOLY CROSS LIGHT, FEBRUARY 15</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>DEAR CATHARINE<br/>
&</em>mdash;Your father was right: they refuse to take me at<br/>
Avalon. As soon as I found your note I telegraphed to Avalon for<br/>
accommodations. It seems Avalon is an island, and they have to wait<br/>
for the steamers to carry telegrams over from the mainland. So the<br/>
reply has just reached me that they won't take me for less than a<br/>
month; and my limit from business is two weeks or give up my<br/>
position with your father.

</p>
<p>
"Yesterday I came out here to Holy Cross Spring to shoot ducks.<br/>
I'd scarcely begun shooting, at dawn, when along came a couple of<br/>
men through the fog, rowing like the mischief plump into my<br/>
decoys, and I shouted out, 'What the deuce are you about?' and<br/>
they begged my pardon, and said they had thought the point<br/>
unoccupied, and that the fog was thicker than several<br/>
things&mdash;which was true.

</p>
<p>
"So I invited them into the blind to&mdash;oh, the usual ceremony&mdash;and<br/>
they came, and they turned out to be Jack Selden&mdash;the chap I told<br/>
you about who was so decent to me in Paris&mdash;and his guide.

</p>
<p>
"So we had&mdash;ceremonies&mdash;several of them&mdash;and Selden stayed to<br/>
shoot with me over my decoys, and our bag was fifty-three, all big<br/>
duck except fifteen bluebills.

</p>
<p>
"Selden is a godsend to me. We're going to stay out here to-night<br/>
at the lighthouse, and shoot all to-morrow if it doesn't blow too<br/>
hard. It's blowing great guns now. I'm here in the lighthouse,<br/>
writing in the glow of a lamp in the keeper's living-room, with<br/>
his good little wife sewing by the fire and a half-dozen of his<br/>
kids tumbling about on the floor. It's a pretty sight; I love<br/>
children and firesides and that sort of thing. They've got hold of<br/>
Selden now, and are making him tell stories of adventure. He's<br/>
been all over the world, and is perfectly crazy to get married.<br/>
Says he would prefer a widow with yellow hair and blue eyes. Do<br/>
you know any? He's a nice chap."

</p>
<p>
"Catharine, I wish I were in Avalon. They could put me in a<br/>
strait-jacket and I wouldn't care as long as [<em>you were</em>, crossed<br/>
out] I could be with [<em>you</em>, crossed out] your father and you in<br/>
Avalon.

</p>
<p>
"It's growing late, and Selden and I should be on the<br/>
ducking-grounds to-morrow before dawn. The keeper's wife says it<br/>
will blow too hard, but Selden only smiles. He's a cool one, and<br/>
if he has the nerve to go out I'll go, too.

</p>
<p>
"With sincere regards to your father and every wish for his speedy<br/>
recovery, I remain

</p>

<p>In from the open sea drifted the castaways, the sun rising in
tropic splendor behind them, before them a far strip of snowy
surf edging green shores.</p>

<p>Selden sat in the bow, bailing; Harroll dug vigorously into the
Atlantic with both oars; a heavy flood-tide was doing the rest.
Presently Selden picked up the ducking-glass and examined the
shore.</p>

<p>Harroll rested his oars, took a pull at the mineral water, and
sighed deeply. "Except for the scare and the confounded leak it's
been rather amusing, hasn't it?" he said.</p>

<p>"It's all right.... Hope you didn't set that farewell message
afloat."</p>

<p>"What message?"</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;I thought I saw you scribbling in your notebook and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"And stick the leaf into the bottle of gun-oil. If I was mistaken,
kindly give me my bottle of gun-oil."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Harroll. "The storm was magnificent. Can't a man
jot down impressions? Open a can of sardines, will you? And pass
me the bread, you idiot!"</p>

<p>Selden constructed a sandwich and passed it aft. "When we near
those ducks," he said, "we'd better give them a broadside&mdash;our
larder's getting low. I'll load for us both."</p>

<p>He fished about among the cartridge-sacks for some dry shells,
loaded the guns, and laid them ready.</p>

<p>"Bluebills," observed Harroll, as the boat drew near. "How tame
they are! Look, Selden! It would be murder to shoot."</p>

<p>The boat, drifting rapidly, passed in among the raft of ducks;
here and there a glistening silver-breasted bird paddled lazily
out of the way, but the bulk of the flock floated serenely on
either side, riding the swell, bright golden eyes fearlessly observing
the intruders.</p>

<p>"Oh, a man can't shoot at things that act like that!" exclaimed
Selden petulantly. "Shoo! Shoo&mdash;o!" he cried, waving his gun in
hopes that a scurry and rise might justify assassination. But
the birds only watched him in perfect confidence. The boat drove
on; the young men sat staring across the waves, guns idly balanced
across their knees. Presently Harroll finished his sandwich and
resumed the oars.</p>

<p>"Better bail some more," he said. "What are you looking at?"&mdash;for
Selden, using the ducking-glass, had begun to chuckle.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he said slowly&mdash;"of all luck! Where do
you suppose we are?"</p>

<p>"Well, where the devil are we?"</p>

<p>"Off Avalon!"</p>

<p>"Avalon!" repeated Harroll, stupidly. "Why, man, it's a hundred
miles south of Holy Cross!"</p>

<p>"Well, we've made it, I tell you. I can see one of their dinky
little temples shining among the trees. Hark! There go the bells
ringing for meditation!"</p>

<p>A mellow chime came across the water.</p>

<p>"It can't be Avalon," repeated Harroll, not daring to hope for
such fortune. "What do you know about Avalon, anyway?"</p>

<p>"What I've heard."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's a resort for played-out people who've gone the pace.
When a girl dances herself into the fidgets, or a Newport matron
goes to pieces, or a Wall Street man begins to talk to himself,
hither they toddle. It's the fashionable round-up for smashed
nerves and wibbly-wobbly intellects&mdash;a sort of "back-to-nature"
enterprise run by a "doctor." He makes 'em all wear garments cut
in the style of the humble bed-sheet, and then he turns 'em out
to grass; and they may roll on it or frisk on it or eat it if
they like. Incidentally, I believe, they're obliged to wallow
in the ocean several times a day, run races afoot, chuck the classic
discus, go barefooted and sandal-shod, wear wreaths of flowers
instead of hats, meditate in silence when the temple bells ring,
eat grain and fruit and drink milk, and pay enormous bills to
the quack who runs the place. It must be a merry life, Harroll.
No tobacco, no billiards, no bridge. And hit the downy at nine-thirty
by the curfew!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" muttered Harroll.</p>

<p>"That's Avalon," repeated Selden. "And we're almost there. Look
sharp! Stand by for a ducking! This surf means trouble ahead!"</p>

<p>It certainly did; the boat soared skyward on the crest of the
swell; a smashing roller hurled it into the surf, smothering craft
and crew in hissing foam. A second later two heads appeared, and
two half-suffocated young men floundered up the beach and dropped,
dripping and speechless, on the sand.</p>

<p>They lay inert for a while, salt water oozing at every pore.
Harroll was the first to sit up.</p>

<p>"Right?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"All right. Where's the boat?"</p>

<p>"Ashore below us." He rose, dripping, and made off toward the
battered boat, which lay in the shoals, heeled over. Selden followed;
together they dragged the wreck up high and dry; then they sat
down on the sand, eying one another.</p>

<p>"It's a fine day," said Selden, with a vacant grin. He rolled
over on his back, clutching handfuls of hot sand. "Isn't this
immense?" he said. "My! how nice and dry and solid everything
is! Roll on your back, Harroll! You'll enjoy it more that way."</p>

<p>But Harroll got up and began dragging the guns and cartridge-sacks
from the boat.</p>

<p>"I've some friends here," he said briefly. "Come on."</p>

<p>"Are your friends hospitably inclined to the shipwrecked? I'm
about ready to be killed with hospitality," observed Selden, shouldering
gun and sack and slopping along in his wet boots.</p>

<p>They entered a thicket of sweet-bay and palmetto, breast-high,
and forced a path through toward a bit of vivid green lawn, which
gave underfoot like velvet.</p>

<p>"There's a patient now&mdash;in his toga," said Selden, in a low voice.
"Better hit him with a piteous tale of shipwreck, hadn't we?"</p>

<p>The patient was seated on a carved bench of marble under the
shade of a live oak. His attitude suggested <em>ennui</em>; he
yawned at intervals; at intervals he dug in the turf with idle
bare toes.</p>

<p>"The back of that gentleman's head," said Harroll, "resembles
the back of a head I know."</p>

<p>"Oh! One of those friends you mentioned?"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I never saw him in toga and sandals, wearing a wreath
of flowers on his head. Let's take a front view."</p>

<p>The squeaky, sloppy sound of Selden's hip boots aroused the gentleman
in the toga from his attitude of bored meditation.</p>

<p>"How do you do, sir?" said Harroll, blandly, "I thought I'd come
to Avalon."</p>

<p>The old gentleman fumbled in his toga, found a monocle, screwed
it firmly into his eye, and inspected Harroll from head to heel.</p>

<p>"You're rather wet, Jim," he said, steadying his voice.</p>

<p>Harroll admitted it. "This is my old friend, Jack Selden&mdash;the
Lenox Seldens, you know, sir." And, to Selden, he reverently named
Mr. Delancy.</p>

<p>"How do?" said Mr. Delancy. "You're wet, too."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mr. Delancy executed a facial contortion
which released the monocle. Then he touched his faded eyes with
the hem of his handkerchief. The lashes and furrowed cheeks were
moist.</p>

<p>"You're so devilish abrupt, Jim," he said. "Did you get any telegrams
from us?"</p>

<p>"Telegrams? No, sir. When?"</p>

<p>"No matter," said Mr. Delancy.</p>

<p>Another silence, and Harroll said: "Fact is, sir, we were blown
out to sea, and that's how we came here. I fancy Selden wouldn't
mind an invitation to dinner and a chance to dry his clothes."</p>

<p>Selden smiled hopefully and modestly as Mr. Delancy surveyed
him.</p>

<p>"Pray accept my hospitality, gentlemen," said Mr. Delancy, with
a grim smile. "I've been ass enough to take a villa in this forsaken
place. The food I have to offer you might be relished by squirrels,
perhaps; the clothing resembles my own, and can be furnished you
by the simple process of removing the sheets from your beds."</p>

<p>He rose, flung the flap of his toga over one shoulder, and passed
his arm through Harroll's.</p>

<p>"Don't you like it here?" asked Harroll.</p>

<p>"<em>Like</em> it!" repeated Mr. Delancy.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;why did you come?"</p>

<p>"I came," said Mr. Delancy slowly, "because I desired to be rid
of you."</p>

<p>Selden instinctively fell back out of earshot. Harroll reddened.</p>

<p>"I thought your theory was&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You smashed that theory&mdash;now you've shattered this&mdash;you and
Catharine between you."</p>

<p>Harroll looked thoughtfully at Selden, who stood watching two
pretty girls playing handball on the green.</p>

<p>"Young man," said Mr. Delancy, "do you realize what I've been
through in one week? I have been obliged to wear this unspeakable
garment, I've been obliged to endure every species of tomfoolery,
I've been fed on bird seed, deprived of cigars, and sent to bed
at half past nine. And I'm as sound in limb and body as you are.
And all because I desired to be rid of you. I had two theories!
both are smashed. I refuse to entertain any more theories concerning
anything!"</p>

<p>Harroll laughed; then his attention became concentrated on the
exquisite landscape, where amid green foliage white villas of
Georgia marble glimmered, buried in blossoming thickets of oleander,
wistaria, and Cherokee roses&mdash;where through the trees a placid
lake lay reflecting the violet sky&mdash;where fallow-deer wandered,
lipping young maple buds&mdash;where beneath a pergola heavily draped
with golden jasmine a white-robed figure moved in the shade&mdash;a
still, sunny world of green and gold and violet exhaling incense
under a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>"I would like to see Catharine," he said, slowly, "with your
permission&mdash;and in view of the fate of the theories."</p>

<p>"Jim," said Mr. Delancy, "you are doubtless unconscious of the
trouble you have created in my family."</p>

<p>"Trouble, sir?" repeated the young man, flushing up.</p>

<p>"Trouble for two. My daughter and I believed you drowned."</p>

<p>Harroll stood perfectly still. Mr. Delancy took a step or two
forward, turned, and came back across the lawn. "She is sitting
under that pergola yonder, looking out to sea, and I'm afraid
she's crying her eyes out for something she wants. It's probably
not good for her, either. But&mdash;such as it is&mdash;she may have it."</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another steadily.</p>

<p>"I'm rather glad you were not drowned," said Mr. Delancy, "but
I'm not infatuated with you."</p>

<p>They shook hands solemnly, then Mr. Delancy walked over and joined
Selden, who appeared to be fascinated by an attractive girl in
Greek robes and sandals who was playing handball on the green.</p>

<p>"Young man," said Mr. Delancy, "there's always trouble for two
in this world. That young woman with yellow hair and violet eyes
who is playing handball with her sister, and who appears to hypnotize
you, is here to recuperate from the loss of an elderly husband."</p>

<p>"A widow with yellow hair and blue eyes!" murmured Selden, entranced.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Your train, however, leaves to-night&mdash;unless you
mean to remain here on a diet of bird-seed."</p>

<p>Selden smiled absently. Bird-seed had no terror for him.</p>

<p>"Besides," he said, "I'm rather good at handball."</p>

<p>A moment later he looked around, presumably for Harroll. That
young man was already half-way to the jasmine-covered arbor, where
a young girl sat, dry-eyed, deathly pale, staring out to sea.</p>

<p>The sea was blue and smiling; the soft thunder of the surf came
up to her. She heard the gulls mewing in the sky and the hum of
bees in the wind-stirred blossoms; she saw a crested osprey plunge
into the shallows and a great tarpon fling its mass of silver
into the sun. Paroquets gleaming like living jewels rustled and
preened in the china-trees; black and gold butterflies, covered
with pollen, crawled over and over the massed orange bloom. Ah,
the mask of youth that the sly world wore to mock her! Ah, the
living lie of the sky, and the false, smooth sea fawning at her
feet!</p>

<p>Little persuasive breezes came whispering, plucking at the white
hem of her robe to curry favor; the ingratiating surf purred,
blinking with a million iridescent bubbles. The smug smile of
nature appalled her; its hypocrisy sickened her; and she bent
her dark eyes fiercely on the sea and clinched her little hands.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Give up my dead!' she whispered. 'Give up my
dead!'"]</p>

<p>"Give up my dead!" she whispered. "Give up my dead!"</p>

<p>"Catharine!"</p>

<p>Dazed, she rose to her sandalled feet, the white folds of her
robe falling straight and slim.</p>

<p>"Catharine!"</p>

<p>Her voiceless lips repeated his name; she swayed, steadying herself
by the arm around her waist.</p>

<p>Then trouble for two began.</p>

<p>As Williams ended, I looked at him with indignation.</p>

<p>"As far as I can see," I said, "you are acting as attorney for
the defense. That's a fine story to tell a father of two attractive
daughters. You needn't repeat it to them."</p>

<p>"But it happened, old man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'old man,' either. I'll explain to you why." And
I did, peevishly.</p>

<p>After that I saw less of Williams, from choice. He has a literary
way with him in telling a story&mdash;and I didn't wish Alida and Dulcima
to sympathize with young Harroll and that little ninny, Catharine
Delancy. So I kept clear of Williams until we arrived in Paris.</p>
