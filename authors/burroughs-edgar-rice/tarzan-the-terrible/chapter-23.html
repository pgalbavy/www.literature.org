<p>As night fell a warrior from the palace of Ja-lur slipped into the
temple grounds. He made his way to where the lesser priests were
quartered. His presence aroused no suspicion as it was not unusual for
warriors to have business within the temple. He came at last to a
chamber where several priests were congregated after the evening meal.
The rites and ceremonies of the sacrifice had been concluded and there
was nothing more of a religious nature to make call upon their time
until the rites at sunrise.
</p>
<p>Now the warrior knew, as in fact nearly all Pal-ul-don knew, that there
was no strong bond between the temple and the palace at Ja-lur and that
Ja-don only suffered the presence of the priests and permitted their
cruel and abhorrent acts because of the fact that these things had been
the custom of the Ho-don of Pal-ul-don for countless ages, and rash
indeed must have been the man who would have attempted to interfere
with the priests or their ceremonies. That Ja-don never entered the
temple was well known, and that his high priest never entered the
palace, but the people came to the temple with their votive offerings
and the sacrifices were made night and morning as in every other temple
in Pal-ul-don.
</p><p>The warriors knew these things, knew them better perhaps than a simple
warrior should have known them. And so it was here in the temple that
he looked for the aid that he sought in the carrying out of whatever
design he had.
</p><p>As he entered the apartment where the priests were he greeted them
after the manner which was customary in Pal-ul-don, but at the same
time he made a sign with his finger that might have attracted little
attention or scarcely been noticed at all by one who knew not its
meaning. That there were those within the room who noticed it and
interpreted it was quickly apparent, through the fact that two of the
priests rose and came close to him as he stood just within the doorway
and each of them, as he came, returned the signal that the warrior had
made.
</p><p>The three talked for but a moment and then the warrior turned and left
the apartment. A little later one of the priests who had talked with
him left also and shortly after that the other.
</p><p>In the corridor they found the warrior waiting, and led him to a little
chamber which opened upon a smaller corridor just beyond where it
joined the larger. Here the three remained in whispered conversation
for some little time and then the warrior returned to the palace and
the two priests to their quarters.
</p><p>The apartments of the women of the palace at Ja-lur are all upon the
same side of a long, straight corridor. Each has a single door leading
into the corridor and at the opposite end several windows overlooking a
garden. It was in one of these rooms that Jane slept alone. At each end
of the corridor was a sentinel, the main body of the guard being
stationed in a room near the outer entrance to the women's quarters.
</p><p>The palace slept for they kept early hours there where Ja-don ruled.
The pal-e-don-so of the great chieftain of the north knew no such wild
orgies as had resounded through the palace of the king at A-lur. Ja-lur
was a quiet city by comparison with the capital, yet there was always a
guard kept at every entrance to the chambers of Ja-don and his
immediate family as well as at the gate leading into the temple and
that which opened upon the city.
</p><p>These guards, however, were small, consisting usually of not more than
five or six warriors, one of whom remained awake while the others
slept. Such were the conditions then when two warriors presented
themselves, one at either end of the corridor, to the sentries who
watched over the safety of Jane Clayton and the Princess O-lo-a, and
each of the newcomers repeated to the sentinels the stereotyped words
which announced that they were relieved and these others sent to watch
in their stead. Never is a warrior loath to be relieved of sentry duty.
Where, under different circumstances he might ask numerous questions he
is now too well satisfied to escape the monotonies of that universally
hated duty. And so these two men accepted their relief without question
and hastened away to their pallets.
</p><p>And then a third warrior entered the corridor and all of the newcomers
came together before the door of the ape-man's slumbering mate. And one
was the strange warrior who had met Ja-don and Tarzan outside the city
of Ja-lur as they had approached it the previous day; and he was the
same warrior who had entered the temple a short hour before, but the
faces of his fellows were unfamiliar, even to one another, since it is
seldom that a priest removes his hideous headdress in the presence even
of his associates.
</p><p>Silently they lifted the hangings that hid the interior of the room
from the view of those who passed through the corridor, and stealthily
slunk within. Upon a pile of furs in a far corner lay the sleeping form
of Lady Greystoke. The bare feet of the intruders gave forth no sound
as they crossed the stone floor toward her. A ray of moonlight entering
through a window near her couch shone full upon her, revealing the
beautiful contours of an arm and shoulder in cameo-distinctness against
the dark furry pelt beneath which she slept, and the perfect profile
that was turned toward the skulking three.
</p><p>But neither the beauty nor the helplessness of the sleeper aroused such
sentiments of passion or pity as might stir in the breasts of normal
men. To the three priests she was but a lump of clay, nor could they
conceive aught of that passion which had aroused men to intrigue and to
murder for possession of this beautiful American girl, and which even
now was influencing the destiny of undiscovered Pal-ul-don.
</p><p>Upon the floor of the chamber were numerous pelts and as the leader of
the trio came close to the sleeping woman he stooped and gathered up
one of the smaller of these. Standing close to her head he held the rug
outspread above her face. "Now," he whispered and simultaneously he
threw the rug over the woman's head and his two fellows leaped upon
her, seizing her arms and pinioning her body while their leader stifled
her cries with the furry pelt. Quickly and silently they bound her
wrists and gagged her and during the brief time that their work
required there was no sound that might have been heard by occupants of
the adjoining apartments.
</p><p>Jerking her roughly to her feet they forced her toward a window but she
refused to walk, throwing herself instead upon the floor. They were
very angry and would have resorted to cruelties to compel her obedience
but dared not, since the wrath of Lu-don might fall heavily upon
whoever mutilated his fair prize.
</p><p>And so they were forced to lift and carry her bodily. Nor was the task
any sinecure since the captive kicked and struggled as best she might,
making their labor as arduous as possible. But finally they succeeded
in getting her through the window and into the garden beyond where one
of the two priests from the Ja-lur temple directed their steps toward a
small barred gateway in the south wall of the enclosure.
</p><p>Immediately beyond this a flight of stone stairs led downward toward
the river and at the foot of the stairs were moored several canoes.
Pan-sat had indeed been fortunate in enlisting aid from those who knew
the temple and the palace so well, or otherwise he might never have
escaped from Ja-lur with his captive. Placing the woman in the bottom
of a light canoe Pan-sat entered it and took up the paddle. His
companions unfastened the moorings and shoved the little craft out into
the current of the stream. Their traitorous work completed they turned
and retraced their steps toward the temple, while Pan-sat, paddling
strongly with the current, moved rapidly down the river that would
carry him to the Jad-ben-lul and A-lur.
</p><p>The moon had set and the eastern horizon still gave no hint of
approaching day as a long file of warriors wound stealthily through the
darkness into the city of A-lur. Their plans were all laid and there
seemed no likelihood of their miscarriage. A messenger had been
dispatched to Ta-den whose forces lay northwest of the city. Tarzan,
with a small contingent, was to enter the temple through the secret
passageway, the location of which he alone knew, while Ja-don, with the
greater proportion of the warriors, was to attack the palace gates.
</p><p>The ape-man, leading his little band, moved stealthily through the
winding alleys of A-lur, arriving undetected at the building which hid
the entrance to the secret passageway. This spot being best protected
by the fact that its existence was unknown to others than the priests,
was unguarded. To facilitate the passage of his little company through
the narrow winding, uneven tunnel, Tarzan lighted a torch which had
been brought for the purpose and preceding his warriors led the way
toward the temple.
</p><p>That he could accomplish much once he reached the inner chambers of the
temple with his little band of picked warriors the ape-man was
confident since an attack at this point would bring confusion and
consternation to the easily overpowered priests, and permit Tarzan to
attack the palace forces in the rear at the same time that Ja-don
engaged them at the palace gates, while Ta-den and his forces swarmed
the northern walls. Great value had been placed by Ja-don on the moral
effect of the Dor-ul-Otho's mysterious appearance in the heart of the
temple and he had urged Tarzan to take every advantage of the old
chieftain's belief that many of Lu-don's warriors still wavered in
their allegiance between the high priest and the Dor-ul-Otho, being
held to the former more by the fear which he engendered in the breasts
of all his followers than by any love or loyalty they might feel toward
him.
</p><p>There is a Pal-ul-donian proverb setting forth a truth similar to that
contained in the old Scotch adage that "The best laid schemes o' mice
and men gang aft a-gley." Freely translated it might read, "He who
follows the right trail sometimes reaches the wrong destination," and
such apparently was the fate that lay in the footsteps of the great
chieftain of the north and his godlike ally.
</p><p>Tarzan, more familiar with the windings of the corridors than his
fellows and having the advantage of the full light of the torch, which
at best was but a dim and flickering affair, was some distance ahead of
the others, and in his keen anxiety to close with the enemy he gave too
little thought to those who were to support him. Nor is this strange,
since from childhood the ape-man had been accustomed to fight the
battles of life single-handed so that it had become habitual for him to
depend solely upon his own cunning and prowess.
</p><p>And so it was that he came into the upper corridor from which opened
the chambers of Lu-don and the lesser priests far in advance of his
warriors, and as he turned into this corridor with its dim cressets
flickering somberly, he saw another enter it from a corridor before
him--a warrior half carrying, half dragging the figure of a woman.
Instantly Tarzan recognized the gagged and fettered captive whom he had
thought safe in the palace of Ja-don at Ja-lur.
</p><p>The warrior with the woman had seen Tarzan at the same instant that the
latter had discovered him. He heard the low beastlike growl that broke
from the ape-man's lips as he sprang forward to wrest his mate from her
captor and wreak upon him the vengeance that was in the Tarmangani's
savage heart. Across the corridor from Pan-sat was the entrance to a
smaller chamber. Into this he leaped carrying the woman with him.
</p><p>Close behind came Tarzan of the Apes. He had cast aside his torch and
drawn the long knife that had been his father's. With the impetuosity
of a charging bull he rushed into the chamber in pursuit of Pan-sat to
find himself, when the hangings dropped behind him, in utter darkness.
Almost immediately there was a crash of stone on stone before him
followed a moment later by a similar crash behind. No other evidence
was necessary to announce to the ape-man that he was again a prisoner
in Lu-don's temple.
</p><p>He stood perfectly still where he had halted at the first sound of the
descending stone door. Not again would he easily be precipitated to the
GRYF pit, or some similar danger, as had occurred when Lu-don had
trapped him in the Temple of the Gryf.  As he stood there his eyes
slowly grew accustomed to the darkness and he became aware that a dim
light was entering the chamber through some opening, though it was
several minutes before he discovered its source. In the roof of the
chamber he finally discerned a small aperture, possibly three feet in
diameter and it was through this that what was really only a lesser
darkness rather than a light was penetrating its Stygian blackness of
the chamber in which he was imprisoned.
</p><p>Since the doors had fallen he had heard no sound though his keen ears
were constantly strained in an effort to discover a clue to the
direction taken by the abductor of his mate. Presently he could discern
the outlines of his prison cell. It was a small room, not over fifteen
feet across. On hands and knees, with the utmost caution, he examined
the entire area of the floor. In the exact center, directly beneath the
opening in the roof, was a trap, but otherwise the floor was solid.
With this knowledge it was only necessary to avoid this spot in so far
as the floor was concerned. The walls next received his attention.
There were only two openings. One the doorway through which he had
entered, and upon the opposite side that through which the warrior had
borne Jane Clayton. These were both closed by the slabs of stone which
the fleeing warrior had released as he departed.
</p><p>Lu-don, the high priest, licked his thin lips and rubbed his bony white
hands together in gratification as Pan-sat bore Jane Clayton into his
presence and laid her on the floor of the chamber before him.
</p><p>"Good, Pan-sat!" he exclaimed. "You shall be well rewarded for this
service. Now, if we but had the false Dor-ul-Otho in our power all
Pal-ul-don would be at our feet."
</p><p>"Master, I have him!" cried Pan-sat.
</p><p>"What!" exclaimed Lu-don, "you have Tarzan-jad-guru? You have slain him
perhaps. Tell me, my wonderful Pan-sat, tell me quickly. My breast is
bursting with a desire to know."
</p><p>"I have taken him alive, Lu-don, my master," replied Pan-sat. "He is in
the little chamber that the ancients built to trap those who were too
powerful to take alive in personal encounter."
</p><p>"You have done well, Pan-sat, I--"
</p><p>A frightened priest burst into the apartment. "Quick, master, quick,"
he cried, "the corridors are filled with the warriors of Ja-don."
</p><p>"You are mad," cried the high priest. "My warriors hold the palace and
the temple."
</p><p>"I speak the truth, master," replied the priest, "there are warriors in
the corridor approaching this very chamber, and they come from the
direction of the secret passage which leads hither from the city."
</p><p>"It may be even as he says," exclaimed Pan-sat. "It was from that
direction that Tarzan-jad-guru was coming when I discovered and trapped
him. He was leading his warriors to the very holy of holies."
</p><p>Lu-don ran quickly to the doorway and looked out into the corridor. At
a glance he saw that the fears of the frightened priest were well
founded. A dozen warriors were moving along the corridor toward him but
they seemed confused and far from sure of themselves. The high priest
guessed that deprived of the leadership of Tarzan they were little
better than lost in the unknown mazes of the subterranean precincts of
the temple.
</p><p>Stepping back into the apartment he seized a leathern thong that
depended from the ceiling. He pulled upon it sharply and through the
temple boomed the deep tones of a metal gong. Five times the clanging
notes rang through the corridors, then he turned toward the two
priests. "Bring the woman and follow me," he directed.
</p><p>Crossing the chamber he passed through a small doorway, the others
lifting Jane Clayton from the floor and following him.  Through a
narrow corridor and up a flight of steps they went, turning to right
and left and doubling back through a maze of winding passageways which
terminated in a spiral staircase that gave forth at the surface of the
ground within the largest of the inner altar courts close beside the
eastern altar.
</p><p>From all directions now, in the corridors below and the grounds above,
came the sound of hurrying footsteps. The five strokes of the great
gong had summoned the faithful to the defense of Lu-don in his private
chambers. The priests who knew the way led the less familiar warriors
to the spot and presently those who had accompanied Tarzan found
themselves not only leaderless but facing a vastly superior force. They
were brave men but under the circumstances they were helpless and so
they fell back the way they had come, and when they reached the narrow
confines of the smaller passageway their safety was assured since only
one foeman could attack them at a time. But their plans were frustrated
and possibly also their entire cause lost, so heavily had Ja-don banked
upon the success of their venture.
</p><p>With the clanging of the temple gong Ja-don assumed that Tarzan and his
party had struck their initial blow and so he launched his attack upon
the palace gate. To the ears of Lu-don in the inner temple court came
the savage war cries that announced the beginning of the battle.
Leaving Pan-sat and the other priest to guard the woman he hastened
toward the palace personally to direct his force and as he passed
through the temple grounds he dispatched a messenger to learn the
outcome of the fight in the corridors below, and other messengers to
spread the news among his followers that the false Dor-ul-Otho was a
prisoner in the temple.
</p><p>As the din of battle rose above A-lur, Lieutenant Erich Obergatz turned
upon his bed of soft hides and sat up. He rubbed his eyes and looked
about him. It was still dark without.
</p><p>"I am Jad-ben-Otho," he cried, "who dares disturb my slumber?"
</p><p>A slave squatting upon the floor at the foot of his couch shuddered and
touched her forehead to the floor. "It must be that the enemy have
come, O Jad-ben-Otho." She spoke soothingly for she had reason to know
the terrors of the mad frenzy into which trivial things sometimes threw
the Great God.
</p><p>A priest burst suddenly through the hangings of the doorway and falling
upon his hands and knees rubbed his forehead against the stone
flagging. "O Jad-ben-Otho," he cried, "the warriors of Ja-don have
attacked the palace and the temple. Even now they are fighting in the
corridors near the quarters of Lu-don, and the high priest begs that
you come to the palace and encourage your faithful warriors by your
presence."
</p><p>Obergatz sprang to his feet. "I am Jad-ben-Otho," he screamed. "With
lightning I will blast the blasphemers who dare attack the holy city of
A-lur."
</p><p>For a moment he rushed aimlessly and madly about the room, while the
priest and the slave remained upon hands and knees with their foreheads
against the floor.
</p><p>"Come," cried Obergatz, planting a vicious kick in the side of the
slave girl. "Come! Would you wait here all day while the forces of
darkness overwhelm the City of Light?"
</p><p>Thoroughly frightened as were all those who were forced to serve the
Great God, the two arose and followed Obergatz towards the palace.
</p><p>Above the shouting of the warriors rose constantly the cries of the
temple priests: "Jad-ben-Otho is here and the false Dor-ul-Otho is a
prisoner in the temple." The persistent cries reached even to the ears
of the enemy as it was intended that they should.
