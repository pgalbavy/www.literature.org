<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe committed a serious mistake as he himself
was the first to discover, when he upset the Miami warrior into
the Mississippi and made off with his canoe. He had started out
to help his friends, but his course was an injury to them, for
it increased their danger without giving them the least assistance.</p>

<p>What he ought to have done, when he observed the drowsy fisherman,
was to bring the boys to the spot, so that, directly after the
red man was dispossessed, the three could have entered the boat
and hastened across the river.  Had he done so, all that which
followed would have be averted.</p>

<p>In referring to the course of the young Shawano the most incredible
statement is that the blunder was altogether due to his waggishness,
because in his eagerness to play a joke upon an enemy, he forgot
his usual caution; but such was the truth.</p>

<p>The warrior, however, was not the one to stay on the western
shore when his friends were in danger.  Though he had told them
to expect him back at a certain hour, early in the afternoon,
his intention was to return much earlier.  It would have been
folly for him to make for any point near that from which he departed
when he set out from the Kentucky shore.  Such a proceeding would
be seen by his enemies, and would invite them to riddle him with
bullets as he approached.</p>

<p>The moment he touched the Louisiana side, he ran under the overhanging
limbs far enough to be out of sight of any who might be on the
watch, and then pushed vigorously up stream.  He continued until
he had gone fully a half mile and had rounded quite a bend in
the river.  Then he paddled straight across to the other bank,
down which he made his way with the same haste.</p>

<p>He speedily arrived in the vicinity of the lads and prepared,
in his characteristic fashion, to take a hand in their rescue. 
Hoping that the chance for flight would speedily come, he carefully
drew the canoe under cover, where he was confident it would not
be seen by any enemies prowling in the vicinity.  Then he stealthily
plunged into the wood to give what help he could to his friends.</p>

<p>It took him only a little while to find they were at bay within
the log enclosure and in much greater danger than he first supposed.
The discovery caused a change in his plans.  He returned to the
canoe and took out the rifle which he had captured; his bow and,
arrows were not left within the boat, for he valued them too highly
to incur such risk; they were hidden where he knew no one could
possibly steal them away from him.  Then the little phial which
he carried in the receptacle with his Bible was uncorked and the
crimson paint applied with his forefinger to his face.  The ornamentation
was as fantastical as the imagination of the native American could
make it.</p>

<p>Viewed for the first time by those who did not know him, he would
have been classed as one of the fiercest warriors that ever went
on the war trail.  Had he been a pagan instead of a Christian,
the idea would have been a correct one.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot was handicapped from the first by the fact that
he was known to more than one of the party.  It may be said that
at that day there was scarcely a Shawanoe east of the Mississippi
who had not heard of the execrated friend of the white men.  They
knew that his favorite weapons, beside his knife and tomahawk,
were his bow and arrows; that his skill with them approached the
marvelous; they knew that his fleetness surpassed that of any
living person that he possessed a form and features of rare beauty;
that his courage was surpassed by none, for, when but a stripling,
he had handed a knife to the furious Tecumseh, and dared him to
fight unto the death, and that his cunning and subtlety were beyond
the reach of the ordinary warrior.</p>

<p>Deerfoot himself was aware of his general notoriety, and, though
he might not have been seen by the Shawanoes, yet they would identify
him at the first glance, provided he appeared before them in his
own proper person.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, why he disguised his appearance
with such care.  With the shrewdness of one of our modern detectives,
he made a change also, as may be said, in "himself" that is, he
walked differently, and used his arms and legs in style altogether
foreign to his custom.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that there were several strong points in
his favor; his was the tribe whose warriors hated him with unspeakable
hatred, and he therefore was a master of every detail.  When he
was assisted by the gloom of night, he was in scarcely any danger,
though it was far different under the glare of the sun.</p>

<p>Another advantage should be named, inasmuch as the reader is
apt to overlook it; the separate war parties from the Shawanoe
and Miami tribes were not only few in numbers, but they had not
met until after arriving in the neighborhood where the youthful
pioneers were traveling with little fear of molestation.  Thus,
in a certain sense, the warriors, while allies, were comparative
strangers. After disguising himself he believed his identity would
not be discovered by the Miamis, unless, possibly, by the lone
fisherman. There was also a fair prospect that he could avert
suspicion for a time on the part of the Shawanoes, unless particular
attention was directed to him.</p>

<p>The foregoing seems necessary in order to justify what was done
by the wonderful Deerfoot.  He managed to appear on the outer
fringe of the ring of assailants, without drawing special notice,
and he used all his skill in learning what the assailants intended
to do.</p>

<p>The warrior who had been shot while in the act of climbing over
the logs after the boys, met his fate before Deerfoot arrived
on the scene.  The Indians were in a revengeful mood, and were
unanimous in their determination to visit the worst punishment
on the youths who were making such a brave fight for their lives.</p>

<p>"But for Deerfoot they would not be in this sad plight," was
the thought of the young Shawanoe; "therefore the Great Spirit
expects Deerfoot not to think of his own life until they are saved
from the death which threatens them."</p>

<p>Fortunately for this purpose the warriors were scattered to a
considerable extent, and seemed to give their whole thoughts to
those within the enclosure.  Deerfoot knew, when he observed the
heavy log borne forward, and the butt placed on the wall, that
it was meant to be used to carry out some plan not clearly settled
in the minds of the assailants themselves.  When he saw a move
to climb the trees which stood near the rude fort, he feared his
friends would be caught unawares, and he took to a tree with the
hope of being able to give them warning in time.</p>

<p>On this point it will be seen the young warrior underrated the
woodcraft of his friends.  With a thrill of pleasure he glanced
at the rifle of Jack Carleton pointed at him, before he had sought
to open communication.  It was only a natural precaution which
led him to select a tree where he was able to use the sign language,
without being seen by any of his enemies below.  He made sure
that enough foliage intervened to screen him from the inquiring
gaze of his enemies during the proceeding.</p>

<p>Having made certain that his identity was known to his friends,
it will be remembered that the sought to warn them of the very
peril which threatened from the tree on the other side.  Failing
to make himself clear, he raised his own gun with the intention
of shooting the savage from the perch, but providentially Otto
Relstaub averted the necessity.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that had Deerfoot fired the shot he
could have effected his own escape.  The point from which the
gun was discharged must have made itself manifest to more than
one warrior below, and would have involved him in a labyrinth
of peril, where his subtlety must have failed him.</p>

<p>But it need not be repeated that he would not have faltered on
that account, had the need existed.  He believed it his duty to
hesitate at no risk, because he himself was wholly to blame for
the dire straits in which the boys found themselves.</p>

<p>With a grim enjoyment that can hardly be understood, Deerfoot
stood in the background and watched the antics of the warrior
who had wrapped the bear-skin about his shoulders and body.  He
could not avoid a feeling of admiration for the cleverness with
which the front was arranged, so as to resemble that of the beast,
but he felt not the slightest fear that the trick would succeed. 
It was such an antiquated stratagem that he wondered it was attempted,
especially after the defenders had given so convincing evidence
of their watchfulness.</p>

<p>His amazement, therefore, may be appreciated when he saw the
creature slowly make his way to the edge of the fort, look down
on the boys, and then back a few steps and drop to ground.</p>

<p>He could not believe they had failed penetrate a disguise which
could scarcely hope to deceive, except under very favoring circumstance
but concluded they must have refrained good reason of their own.</p>

<p>While these troublesome thoughts were in the mind of Deerfoot,
he kept his eye on the Miami, whose scant clothing had not dried
after his voluntary plunge into the Mississippi, from the bow
of his canoe.  His victim acted as though he entertained some
doubts as to the identity of the individual that did not mingle
with the main body of the warriors.</p>

<p>Deerfoot knew that if he did suspect the truth, his curiosity
was likely to cause trouble.  The time had come when it was the
part of wisdom to withdraw.</p>

<p>At last the Miami walked toward the enclosure, where two of his
own tribe were talking same number of the Shawanoes.   He said
something which stirred up matters at once.  All five began talking
vigorously, and then they turned take a look at the youthful warrior.</p>

<p>He was gone, having vanished as silently as he appeared on the
scene, and it was well that he did so, for the deception could
have been carried no further.</p>

<p>Within the succeeding ten minutes the report of a rifle came
from the direction of the river.  Then a second was heard from
another point in the wood, and again a third report awoke the
echoes among the trees.</p>

<p>The red men did not know what it meant.  All the surviving members
of the two parties were together, and they could not understand
who the new comers were.  They were probably those of their own
race, though the discomforting possibility remained that they
might be white men on their way to the help of the beleaguered
boys.</p>

<p>The truth was, Deerfoot was convinced that if Jack and Otto were
not extricated from their peril long before night, no hope could
remain for them.  It was so clearly in the power of the red men
to capture or destroy them whenever they chose to put forth the
effort, that he knew they would not wait until night.</p>

<p>There were trees on every hand which would shelter the sharp-shooters. 
If they ensconced themselves among the limbs of these, the lads
would be shut off from the chance of protecting themselves, for
on whichsoever side of the space they stood, they would be within
the range of one or two of the gunners.</p>

<p>The plan which he next proceeded to put into execution was in
the mind of Deerfoot from the first moment he learned of the situation
of the endangered ones.  It was impossible to succeed without
a perfect understanding with his friends, for they necessarily
had an important part to play in the programme.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will send them a message," he said to himself, with
a throb of pride over the facility at his command; "that will
tell everything."</p>

<p>Making his way to a safe point in the forest, he sat down on
the ground, tore off a piece from the paper which he carried with
his Bible, and with red chalk, sharpened to a point, he proceeded
to write the words intended only for the eyes of his friends within
the enclosure.  The paper was twisted around the arrow, just back
of the bead, and he then was ready to adopt the means which he
had employed more than once in somewhat similar situations.</p>
