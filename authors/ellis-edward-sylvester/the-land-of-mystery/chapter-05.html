<p>Meanwhile, Fred Ashman and Aaron Johnston the sailor, found themselves
involved in a most stirring experience.</p>

<p>After studying the path or trail which led directly from the
camp into the vast forest, stretching to an unknown distance from
the Xingu, the young man decided to follow the route which he
believed had been formed by persons instead of the wild animals
of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Johnston was disposed to complain, but he was deeply attached
to the manly partner in the exploring enterprise, and there was
no reasonable peril which he would not willingly face in his defence.</p>

<p>The forest wore an unusually gloomy and dismal appearance, now
that the sun had set and night was closing in.</p>

<p>The roar of the rapids, which at first sounded so loud, grew
duller and fainter as they penetrated the wood until it became
like the moaning of the distant ocean.  The men spoke in guarded
undertones and were able to hear each other plainly, while eyes
and ears were on the alert, for the first sight or sound of danger.</p>

<p>Being within the forest, they were favored with but little of
the moonlight, which proved such a help to their friends in their
ascent of the bank of the Xingu to the head of the rapids.  But
here and there a few of the rays penetrated the vegetation overhead
and illuminated the trail sufficiently to prevent their wandering
from it.</p>

<p>Ashman was less than a rod in advance of the sailor and led until
they had traversed perhaps a fifth of a mile, during which they
met no living creature, though the noises from the wood left no
doubt that wild animals were on every hand.</p>

<p>Fred began to think he had gone far enough, though his wish to
obtain a glimpse of the village, which he believed was not far
off, prevented his coming to a full stop.  Johnston noticing his
hesitation put in another vigorous protest, but he was easily
persuaded to venture further under the pledge that if they discovered
nothing within the next ten minutes, they would withdraw and return
to camp.</p>

<p>Knowing that his companion would insist on the fulfillment of
this agreement, Fred pushed on faster than before; the sailor,
however, easily maintaining his place almost on his heels.  It
was only at intervals they spoke, for there was no call to do
so, and it was not wise to allow any cause to interfere with their
watchfulness for the peril which was liable to come with the suddenness
of the thunderbolt.</p>

<p>By stepping carefully they were able to proceed without noise,
and, at the same time, hoped to catch the sound of any other footsteps,
since there was not supposed to be any call on the part of the
natives for the caution which they might have displayed under
different circumstances.</p>

<p>The young man's heart gave a quicker throb than usual when he
caught the sound of something like a shout, and observed a faint
light in the path in front.  It was apparent that the latter made
an abrupt turn, and the cause of the noise was but a brief distance
beyond.</p>

<p>Fred reached back his hand and touched his companion, as a warning
for the most extreme care on his part, but the admonition was
not needed. Johnston understood the situation too well.</p>

<p>Sure enough, less than a couple of rods further, and the path
turned almost at right angles.  Passing guardedly around this,
the explorers came upon a striking scene.</p>

<p>There was an open space with an area of perhaps three or four
acres; it was as clear of trees as a stretch of western prairie. 
It was triangular in shape, the boundary being so regular that
there could be no doubt it was artificially made.</p>

<p>Around three sides of this space were erected huts or cabins,
the excellence and similarity or their structure suggesting that
the natives were the superior in intelligence of any that had
yet been encountered during the ascent of the Xingu.  The huts
were a dozen feet square, half as high, and each had a broad open
entrance in the middle of the front.  They seemed to be built
of logs or heavy limbs, the roofs being flat and composed of the
branches of trees, overlaid with leaves and earth.</p>

<p>In the middle of the open square was a tall pole, like an immense
flag-staff.  The light which had been noticed sometime before
by the whites was the full flood of the moon's rays, there being
no other kind of illumination, so far as they could ascertain,
in the native village.</p>

<p>The huge pole was without any limbs or appurtenances, but around
the space were gathered a score of figures in rapid motion, the
meaning of whose actions was a puzzle to the white spectators,
until they studied them.</p>

<p>Then it was seen they were struggling together, and the conclusion
was that they were engaged in some kind of a rough sport, for
all the rest of the savages were seated in front of their huts
watching the singular spectacle.</p>

<p>Naturally they ought to have come closer, and the fact that they
did not, suggested that they kept back to give the actors plenty
of room for their performances.</p>

<p>Not the least impressive feature of the scene was the profound
silence which marked it.  The shout that first arrested the attention
of Ashman and his companion, must have been some kind of a signal,
probably announcing the opening of the proceedings.</p>

<p>It was evident that the villagers in the square were struggling
hard, for their forms were interlocked and they were divided into
two lines, which swayed back and forth as one gained or yielded
ground.</p>

<p>"It is a wrestling bout," whispered Ashman to his companion,
and then, reflecting that their situation was dangerous, the two
stopped from the path among the trees, where they would not be
noticed by any passing near.</p>

<p>Suddenly something like a groan was heard from the body of contesting
men.  Almost at the same instant, a command was shouted from the
further end of the square, where part of the spectators were gathered.
The two lines fell apart, and ran silently and swiftly to opposite
points a hundred feet distant, where they abruptly halted as if
in obedience to some signal and faced each other.</p>

<p>This was stirring enough, but that which riveted the eyes of
the white men was the sight of three figures lying prone on the
ground, at the foot of the pole.</p>

<p>They were as motionless as so many stones.  There could be no
mistaking the significance of the sight: they were dead.</p>

<p>It may have been some species of sport in which the actors were
engaged for the entertainment of the spectators, but, if so, there
was an awful earnestness about it, for the stake for which they
strove was human life.</p>

<p>The two lines faced each other but a moment, when another shout
rang out, and they rushed together once more with the fury of
two cyclones.</p>

<p>By this time, our friends had discovered that no member of the
parties was furnished with any weapon other than those provided
by nature.</p>

<p>Fearful then must have been the struggle, which had already terminated
in the death of three of the contestants.</p>

<p>But they were at it again with the fierceness of so many cougars
fighting in defence of their young.</p>

<p>The result was terrifying.  The contest had lasted but a few
minutes, and already a couple were on the earth, when one of the
combatants, with a cry of pain dashed in almost a direct line
toward the spot where our friends were hiding.</p>

<p>Had he not been overtaken and dragged back, he would have been
upon them before they could get out of the way, and it is not
difficult to conjecture what would have followed.</p>

<p>The miserable wretch, however, was seized on the very edge of
the wood by four others and carried writhing and resisting back
to the space. There he was flung down, and, being unable to rise,
the others leaped upon him and in a few minutes all was over. 
He was added to the list that were already <em>hors du combat</em>.</p>

<p>Ashman and Johnston had received a shock which drove away all
interest in the fearful spectacle.  Their escape was exceedingly
narrow and they could scarcely hope for such good fortune again.</p>

<p>Fred touched his friend and whispered to him.  Immediately, they
began stealing from the dangerous spot.</p>
