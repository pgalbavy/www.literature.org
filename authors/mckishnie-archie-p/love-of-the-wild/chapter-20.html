<p>Next morning, before daybreak, Mr. Smythe started for St. Thomas. He
reached the settlement just as Colonel Hallibut, with brows puckered
into a scowl, came riding slowly up the brown path through the scattered
timber of the broken land. The Colonel had faced the north winds from
the lake and the veins in his face lay blue beneath his cheeks like tiny
frozen water-runs. As he turned to the right of the path toward his home
Smythe’s white horse rounded a distant copse. The rider was humming a
hymn and his head was bent piously on his breast. The Colonel reined up
and waited for him, quite aware that Smythe’s hawk-like eyes had caught
sight of him fully as soon as he had caught sight of Smythe.
</p>
<p>“Humph,” mused Hallibut, “what’s in the wind now, I wonder? Nothing good
brings that man here this day.”
</p><p>“Well, Smythe,” he called, “it’s easy to see that you couldn’t hire the
old mare this morning, otherwise you’d have walked over. What’s up?”
</p><p>“Why, bless my soul!” exclaimed the dealer, sitting erect in his saddle
with a start, “if it isn’t the dear Colonel himself. Good-morning, sir,”
he smiled, lifting his old coon-skin cap.
</p><p>Hallibut grinned broadly.
</p><p>“Where’s Watson?” he asked.
</p><p>Smythe rolled his light eyes sorrowfully.
</p><p>“He patiently awaits his reward, sir. He has been down trying to whack
some sense into those ungodly Bushwhackers, Colonel, and now lies at the
point of death in my house.”
</p><p>“Dick,” cried Hallibut, “take these horses, and see that Smythe’s mare
gets all the oats she can eat. Lord knows, she looks as though she could
stand a good feed.”
</p><p>He took Smythe by the narrow shoulders and pushed him into the house.
</p><p>“You look rather done up,” he said, “sit up to the table and I’ll have
Rachel get you up a snack. Will you have a drink of anything?”
</p><p>“I have a slight cold that might be remedied by a touch of brandy,”
returned Smythe. “This is the first time I have had the honor of being
in your pleasant and magnificent home, my dear Colonel.”
</p><p>He held the glass his host handed him to his nose and glanced about the
room furtively.
</p><p>“There’s nothing here for you to look frightened about,” laughed the
Colonel. “Hang it all, Smythe, can’t you ever look pleasant? Your eyes
have a cast like a nesting grebe’s. What’s the matter?”
</p><p>Smythe gave a little shiver and drank his brandy at a gulp. The Colonel,
watching him speculatively, shoved the bottle across the table with:
“Help yourself when you want more.”
</p><p>“Thanks,” replied his visitor, stretching out his long blue hands toward
the glowing fire.
</p><p>Hallibut lit a pipe and smoked silently. At last he turned impatiently
toward Smythe.
</p><p>“Well, what’s it all about?” he inquired.
</p><p>“I’m sorry to be the bearer of grievous and disappointing news to you,
sir,” sighed Smythe. “Esau refuses to sell his birthright.”
</p><p>“What the——” commenced the Colonel, and Smythe started as though he
expected something stronger than an expletive.
</p><p>“I mean, sir, the lawless Bushwhackers refuse to sell their timber,” he
explained quickly. “They nearly killed Mr. Watson the other night for
merely venturing on their property. In fact, a man assaulted him and
Simpson, the school-teacher, so brutally, that it is only a matter of
days, sir, before Watson receives the final summons, I fear.”
</p><p>Mr. Smythe glanced at his listener and fortified his pious soul against
the abuse he expected to hear poured out upon the Bushwhackers by taking
another drink. To his surprise and no small disappointment the Colonel
smoked on without a word.
</p><p>A snaky gleam stole into the dealer’s little eyes and he sat huddled up,
waiting for the big man to say something. The Colonel turned slowly and
leaned across the arm of his chair toward his visitor.
</p><p>“What was Watson doing on Bushwhackers’ Place at night? And what was
that school-teacher doing with him? And how does it come about that one
man is able to brutally assault two good-sized men like those two, eh?”
he asked, his bushy brows meeting in a scowl.
</p><p>“They were simply following the directions laid out by yourself, sir,”
explained Smythe, inclining his head. “The Bushwhacker struck them from
behind with a heavy club. He was not alone, sir. Four other men,
including that Hercules of a Big McTavish, helped him, I understand.”
</p><p>“Watson says that, does he?”
</p><p>“He does, and a man by the name of Broadcrook, who was an eye-witness to
the attempted murder, tells the same story, sir.”
</p><p>“Don’t seem at all reasonable to me that those Bushwhackers would half
do anything, even a murder, if they set about it,” mused the Colonel.
“You say Watson was over trying to get them to come to terms about the
timber, and they clubbed him over the head?”
</p><p>“Precisely, both him and Mr. Simpson.”
</p><p>“It’s almost too bad they didn’t finish them,” said Hallibut. “Something
tells me that Watson has given us only his side of this story. Guess I’d
better get the other side from the Bushwhackers.”
</p><p>Smythe raised his skeleton hands.
</p><p>“My dear Colonel, it’s as much as your life’s worth to set foot on their
property,” he warned. “They swear they’ll shoot you on sight, sir.”
</p><p>“What?” Colonel Hallibut sprang up and strode across to where Smythe sat
cowering. “Who told you that?” he shouted.
</p><p>“Why—why——” commenced Smythe, then he wriggled upright and tongued
his dry lips. “—Broadcrook told me for one,” he finished.
</p><p>Hallibut paced to and fro across the wide room. The veins in his neck
were throbbing, and Smythe could see his fingers twitching. Finally, the
big man stopped directly in front of his visitor.
</p><p>“If you heard that,” he said quietly, “and you’ve come over here to warn
me, it’s mighty good of you, Smythe. I’m sorry if I can’t only just
about half believe you—but that’s your fault. I can’t help knowing
you’re a liar, Smythe, any more than you can help being one. Still, I’m
inclined to believe that those Bushwhackers would put me away if they
got the chance. They’ve got a law of their own, I know, and I also know
that they don’t like me any too well. I don’t know why; I never did them
any harm. I wanted that timber, of course, and would have paid them well
for it. I’ve learned, though, that they all have enough natural poetry
in their souls to make them sentimental fanatics as far as their
bushland is concerned, and I’d made up my mind to let them and their
timber go to thunder. Now, after what they’ve lately said, I guess I’ll
show them a thing or two.”
</p><p>“But you won’t take your life in your hands by going among those
murderous men, sir?” asked Smythe fearfully.
</p><p>“Well, now, I’m not saying just <u>what</u> I’ll do. One thing is sure, I’m
too much of an Englishman to be scared out by a Bushwhacker, and I do
like a mix-up, I’ll confess. Besides, Smythe, it won’t do to let them
think I’m scared. My life would always be in jeopardy if they thought
that.”
</p><p>“If you’ll only be patient, sir, we’ll get that timber for you yet,”
promised Smythe.
</p><p>“No,” returned Hallibut, “I’ve given up the idea of ever securing the
timber. Come to think of it, I was a hog to ever want to put my finger
in their pie. I like those wild devils a lot better since I’ve found
they have the sand to stand up for their own. If your village of
Bridgetown had some of the Bushwhacker manhood you’d have a city there
some day, Smythe.”
</p><p>“God forbid,” breathed Mr. Smythe devoutly.
</p><p>“And where did you say Watson was now?” asked the Colonel abruptly.
</p><p>“He is now at my poor abode,” answered Mr. Smythe plaintively. “He is in
pretty bad shape. They must have beaten him unmercifully. He begged that
I give you this note, sir.”
</p><p>Mr. Smythe drew from his pocket a square piece of paper and handed it to
the Colonel. The big man placed his glasses on his nose and read the
note aloud.
</p><p><strong>“COLONEL HALLIBUT,</strong>
</p><p>    <u>Respected Sir</u>: I may never see you in life again. Mr. Smythe
    will explain. I am willing to die in fulfilling my duty to you,
    but, sir, I beg that you will not venture among the
    Bushwhackers. They have sworn to shoot you on sight and to burn
    your schooner if you sail her into the bay. The six hundred
    dollars you gave me toward leasing the timber was taken from me
    as I lay helpless among the ruffians who tried to kill me. It
    proved my salvation, for, as they fought among themselves for
    the money, I managed to crawl away. Good-by, sir, and if we
    never meet again on earth—but I cannot finish.
</p><pre>
                                 Yours,
                                           An erring one
                                    who has been led to the light,
                                                     THOMAS WATSON.”</pre>
<p>The Colonel folded up the letter, pitched it into the coals, and sat
down. He refilled his pipe, a half smile on his face. Then he turned to
Smythe, whose features were working, and who was vainly trying to force
a tear down his cheek.
</p><p>“So you managed to convert poor dying Watson?” he observed. “You’ve led
an erring one to the light, have you?”
</p><p>“In my poor way, sir,” nodded Smythe, “I have.”
</p><p>“Where does Watson want to be buried?” asked the Colonel gravely.
</p><p>The other started.
</p><p>“Buried!” he gasped. “What do you mean, Colonel!”
</p><p>“Why, judging from his letter, he expects to die very soon, and
sometimes people are fanciful about where they are laid to rest——”
</p><p>He paused, and his lips met in a thin line.
</p><p>“Smythe,” he said, holding the visitor with his eyes, “you and Watson
are both danged humbugs. Watson didn’t write that letter: you wrote it.
Watson may be a villain, but there’s not hypocrite enough about him to
dictate a letter like that I just read. I’m not sparing him. He was
quite willing for you to work this game for him. So my money was taken
from him, was it? Well, I suppose it’s just as well to lose it one way
as another. But I want you to confess that you wrote that letter. Did
you?”
</p><p>“I did,” answered Smythe fearfully. “Watson’s arm was too sore. He asked
me to write it. I didn’t mean anything wrong, sir.”
</p><p>“Of course not,” agreed Hallibut dryly.
</p><p>“What do you mean by saying those Bushwhackers will burn my vessel?”
</p><p>“I mean that they intend to do it,” asserted Smythe. “If you doubt me,
sir, you may anchor off Lee Point and convince yourself that I speak the
truth.”
</p><p>“Humph!” grunted Hallibut. “Well, let me tell you something. When the
Bushwhackers burn my schooner, I’ll believe they’re ready to shoot me on
sight; not before. I sent word to them that I would ship a cargo of
lumber—my own lumber—from Lee Creek before the Eau froze over, and
I’ll do it.”
</p><p>He frowned down on Smythe and nodded his shaggy head.
</p><p>“I’ve just come from seeing that same schooner start on her trip to Rond
Eau Bay,” he said, “and heaven help the Bushwhacker that meddles with it
or any other property of Colonel Hallibut’s.”
</p><p>“Perhaps some day you’ll know that Mr. Watson and myself have done our
best for you, Colonel,” said Smythe reproachfully. “I know we’ve erred
in some respects; but over-zealousness is perhaps the cause of failure.
You will pardon my suggesting that you have maybe been unduly influenced
against Mr. Watson on account of his not, as yet, having been able to
convince the Bushwhackers of your good intentions.”
</p><p>“Perhaps you are right,” returned Hallibut coolly.
</p><p>Smythe reached for the bottle and poured some brandy into his glass with
a hand that shook. His face, always pinched and gray-white, was grayer
and more sunken as he arose to go.
</p><p>“Have you any word to send to Mr. Watson, sir?” he asked.
</p><p>“Only that I hope to see him again before he makes up his mind to die,”
smiled the Colonel.
</p><p>Hallibut called to the housekeeper from the dining-room:
</p><p>“Rachel, get this pale rider something to eat, will you, while I have
Dick get out his horse?”
</p><p>He slapped the drooping Smythe between the shoulders and, laughing
loudly, stamped out of the room.
</p><p>As Smythe viciously attacked the cold meat and bread set before him, a
long, weird howl came floating and trembling on the air. He dropped his
fork and sat erect, fear written in his shifting eyes. Once again came
the cry, and Smythe arose and went to the window. Through the narrow
oaken slabs of the kennel-fence, he caught sight of four heavy-chested,
yellow-white dogs. They were creeping slowly across the inclosure with
heavy jaws half open and saliva dripping from their red tongues. As the
watching man gazed, fascinated, one of them lifted its head and sent a
heart-chilling cry upward. Then, chancing to catch sight of the
fear-stricken man at the window, the huge dog hurled itself against the
solid bars of its prison, only to fall back on its haunches. But it
placed its deeply-cloven muzzle against the narrow opening and drew in
its breath with a whistling, sobbing sound that sent a shiver to the
watcher’s heart, for the dog’s red eyes were fastened hungrily upon him.
Colonel Hallibut, entering, noted Smythe’s look, and followed up the
impression the dog had made.
</p><p>“I wouldn’t give a penny for your chance if Trailer there caught you in
the open, Smythe,” he said soberly. “Better not watch him if you care to
sleep to-night. Guess I’d better get rid of that Trailer. He scares me,
and I’m used to him.”
</p><p>“What do you keep those awful animals for?” asked Smythe with a husky
voice.
</p><p>“Smythe,” said Hallibut, “I’ve kept those dogs—well, because they’ve
been good friends to me, and I can’t make up my mind to kill them.”
</p><p>Smythe shuddered and reached for his cap. He walked slowly from the room
and climbed into his saddle. The Colonel watched him take the trail,
then, his duty as a host done, he turned into the house with an
expression of disgust.
</p><p>Once Smythe had rounded the clump of bushes, he slashed the sleepy,
over-fed mare into a gallop, which was not slackened until he was many
miles down the trail. Then he dipped into a hollow, reined up, and
whistled softly. Watson came from among the trees leading a bay horse by
the bridle-rein. He glanced at Smythe’s face and his own darkened.
</p><p>“I told you he wouldn’t believe you,” he flashed. “What did he say?”
</p><p>Smythe leaned forward in the saddle.
</p><p>“‘My friend,’ he answered, ‘tell Watson I hope to see him before he
dies.’”
</p><p>Watson did not reply. He sprang into the saddle and the two rode for a
mile or two in silence. Then Smythe remarked:
</p><p>“Hallibut’s schooner left for Rond Eau to-day, and I think Amos
Broadcrook will not allow me to lose the wager he believes I made with
the dear Colonel. He is waiting for the vessel to drop anchor.”
</p><p>“Then you think the schooner will burn?”
</p><p>“If I read Amos aright—well, yes, I do. Although, let us hope not; let
us hope not.”
</p><p>“Then, when will we kidnap the wood-nymph?” asked Watson. “She must be
got rid of, for Simpson threatens to undo our little plans if we fail
him, you know.”
</p><p>“Yes, I know,” answered Smythe. “Well, we’ll not disappoint Simpson.
Three people there are who must become American citizens soon, and stay
American citizens: Old Noah, Simpson, and——”
</p><p>He clicked his tongue and Watson looked with some sort of admiration at
his friend.
</p><p>“Smythe, you’re a great man,” he asserted.
</p><p>Smythe raised his weak eyes toward the lowering skies.
</p><p>“God knows,” he sighed. “God knows best, my friend. I try to do my
little part well. ’Tis all that I can do.”
</p><p>A little further on Watson broke the oppressive silence again. “When
will we do it, then?”
</p><p>“Say Saturday night,” directed Smythe quietly. “Poor little girl!—But
it must be; it has to be, my friend.”
</p><p>“You are a great man,” flattered Watson. “You deserve success, Smythe. I
hope you win widow Ross and her snug bit of land. And I hope after the
Bushwhackers are convinced that Hallibut would kidnap their queen as a
hostage, they will realize that they need you and me as custodians of
their deeds.”
</p><p>He laughed over his shoulder, and Smythe, digging his spurs into his old
white mare, trotted up alongside him.
</p><p>“Courting was always an unsatisfactory game with me,” he said, “and in
the case of widow Ross it has been no exception. I find she is a selfish
woman. I found her a heathen and I showed her the light——”
</p><p>“And she showed you the door, eh?”
</p><p>“Not so fast, my friend,” smiled Smythe, “she did not. It was that boy
of hers who spoiled my visits. That boy played a nasty trick upon me the
last time I visited the widow. I have not been back since.”
</p><p>“Tell me about it,” said Watson.
</p><p>“Not now.” Smythe shook his head. “Later, perhaps, but not now. Let us
each earnestly review our plans for Saturday night, my friend, and for
our own personal safety, as well as for business motives, think out a
line of action.”
</p><p>Watson shuddered back into his saddle.
</p><p>“I wish to God it was over,” he muttered.
</p><p>He struck his horse with the quirt and it bounded forward, leaving
Bridgetown’s general merchant far in the rear.
</p><p>It was quite agreeable to that gentleman to be left to himself. When he
reached the edge of the town he reined up and gazed southward through
the hazy twilight.
</p><p>Miles away sounded the deep note of a steam whistle.
</p><p>“Hallibut’s mill on Totherside,” mused Smythe. “I wonder if the widow is
waiting and watching for me? I wonder what she is doing now?”
