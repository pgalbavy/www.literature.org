<p>Chatterer was in a peck of trouble. Yes, Sir, he was in a peck
of trouble. There was no doubt about it. "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
If only I had kept my tongue still! If only I had kept my tongue
still!" he kept saying over and over to himself, as he hurried
through the Green Forest. You see, Chatterer was just beginning
to realize what a lot of trouble an unruly tongue can get one
into. Here it was cold weather, the very edge of winter, and Chatterer
didn't dare stay in the Green Forest where he had always made
his home. His storehouses were full of nuts and seeds and corn,
enough and more than enough to keep him in comfort all winter,
and now he must turn his back on them and go he didn't know where,
and all because of his mean disposition and bad tongue.</p>

<p>If he hadn't called Bobby Coon names that morning at the top
of his voice, Shadow the Weasel might not have found him. He knew
that Shadow has a long memory, and that he would never forget
the trick by which Chatterer had escaped, and so the only way
Chatterer would ever be able to have a moment's peace would be
to leave the Green Forest for as long as Shadow the Weasel chose
to stay there. Chatterer shivered inside his warm, red fur coat
as he thought of the long, cold winter and how hard it would be
to find enough to eat. Was ever any one else in such a dreadful
fix?</p>

<p>Presently he came to the edge of the Green Forest. He sat down
to rest in the top of a tree where he could look off over the
Green Meadows. Far, far away he could see the Purple Hills, behind
which jolly, round, red Mr. Sun goes to bed every night. He could
see the old stone wall that separates Farmer Brown's cornfield
from the Green Meadows. He could see Farmer Brown's house and
barn and near them the Old Orchard where Johnny Chuck had spent
the summer with Polly Chuck and their baby Chucks. He knew every
nook and corner in the old stone wall and many times he had been
to the Old Orchard. It was there that he had stolen the eggs of
Drummer the Woodpecker. He grinned at the thought of those eggs
and how he had stolen them, and then he shivered as he remembered
how he had finally been caught and how sharp the bills of Drummer
and Mrs. Drummer were.</p>

<p>But all that was in the past, and thinking about it wasn't going
to help him now. He had got to do something right away. Perhaps
he might find a place to live in the old stone wall, and there
might, there just might, be enough grains of corn scattered over
the ground of the cornfield for him to lay up a supply, if he
worked very hard and fast. Anyway, he would have a look. So he
hurried down from the tree and out along the old stone wall. His
spirits began to rise as he whisked along, peering into every
hole and jumping from stone to stone. It really seemed as though
he might find a snug home somewhere here. Then he remembered something
that made his heart sink again. He remembered having seen Shadow
the Weasel more than once exploring that very wall. Just as likely
as not he would do it again, for it was so very near the Green
Forest. No, the old stone wall wouldn't do.</p>

<p>Just then along came Peter Rabbit. Peter saw right away that
something was wrong with Chatterer, and he wanted to know what
it was. Chatterer told him. He felt that he had just got to tell
some one. Peter looked thoughtful. He scratched his long left
ear with his long right hind foot.</p>

<p>"You know there is another old stone wall up there by the Old
Orchard," said he. "It is pretty near Farmer Brown's house, and
Black Pussy hunts there a great deal, but you ought to be smart
enough to keep out of her clutches."</p>

<p>"I should hope so!" exclaimed Chatterer scornfully. "I have never
seen a cat yet that I was afraid of! believe I'll go over and
have a look at that old wall, Peter Rabbit."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Peter, and off they started together.</p>
