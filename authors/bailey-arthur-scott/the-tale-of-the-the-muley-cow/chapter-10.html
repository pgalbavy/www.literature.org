<p>Mrs. Woodchuck was glad that she had gone to Aunt Polly Woodchuck's
house to tell her the news about the Muley Cow. Aunt Polly was all in a
flutter, she was so eager to see the Muley Cow in her new poke bonnet.
</p>
<p>"Is the poke becoming to her?" Aunt Polly asked Mrs. Woodchuck.
</p><p>"I haven't set eyes on it," Mrs. Woodchuck said. "Old Mr. Crow told me
the news only this morning. I asked him to describe the poke. But all he
could say was that I'd be surprised when I saw it."
</p><p>"That's the way with men folks," Aunt Polly Woodchuck declared. "They
never know anything about the styles--except that queer Mr. Frog, the
tailor."
</p><p>Both ladies giggled at the mere mention of Ferdinand Frog. And while
they were busy tittering, Mrs. Woodchuck's son Billy helped himself to a
piece of carrot from Aunt Polly's store of roots and herbs.
</p><p>"I must have a look at the Muley Cow this very morning," Aunt Polly told
her caller. "Won't you come with me?"
</p><p>Mrs. Woodchuck said that nothing would please her more. So she ordered
Billy to scamper home.
</p><p>"You'll have to wait till I put on my best poke," Aunt Polly said. "If
the Muley Cow has a new one I don't want to call on her in my second
best."
</p><p>So Mrs. Woodchuck waited. And at last they set off together to find the
Muley Cow. They hadn't gone far before old Mr. Crow flapped down on a
hummock near them.
</p><p>"If you're looking for the Muley Cow," he squawked, "you'll find her
down near the lane. And she's wearing her new poke, too."
</p><p>They thanked him. And as soon as they had passed on Mrs. Woodchuck
remarked what a busybody he was.
</p><p>"Always poking his bill into other people's affairs!" Aunt Polly
sniffed.
</p><p>Still, his advice saved them a good many steps. For they found the Muley
Cow just where Mr. Crow had said they would.
</p><p>But she wasn't wearing a poke bonnet at all. They noticed that as soon
as they caught sight of her.
</p><p>"Perhaps it has fallen off her head and she doesn't know it," Aunt Polly
suggested.
</p><p>"I'll ask her," said Mrs. Woodchuck. And she hurried up to the Muley
Cow.
</p><p>"Where's your poke?" she cried. "You haven't lost it--have you?" As she
spoke she noticed a peculiar something about the Muley Cow's neck. It
was a sort of huge wooden collar, with a long stake that stuck out in
front of her.
</p><p>The Muley Cow acted very grumpy.
</p><p>"Don't be impertinent!" she snapped.
</p><p>"Excuse us, please!" Aunt Polly Woodchuck said to the Muley Cow. "We
heard you were wearing a poke; and we wanted to see it. You know, I
always wear a poke in summer. In fact, I put on my best one before
leaving home."
</p><p>The Muley Cow stared at her in a puzzled fashion. And at last the truth
dawned upon her.
</p><p>"You've made a mistake," she said. "You've misunderstood. It's not a
poke bonnet that I have. It's a <u>poke</u>--this thing around my neck."

</p><p>Well, Aunt Polly and Mrs. Woodchuck didn't know what to say. And they
felt so uncomfortable that they turned away and started off.
</p><p>"Wait a moment!" the Muley Cow called to them. "How did you hear about
this poke?"
</p><p>"Old Mr. Crow told me," Mrs. Woodchuck replied.
</p><p>"I thought so," said the Muley Cow. "And I'd like to have a talk with
him."
