<p><em>HARLAN </em>was astonished, but he took his little defeat
well; and Martha in turn encountered a surprise, for he showed
a discomfited kind of pleasure. "So Ornaby Addition’s going to
get its rapid transit at last," he said. "That’s not so bad, you
know. Why, Dan might come out pretty well on the thing after all!"</p>

<p>"But doesn’t that annoy you, Harlan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You mean that I <em>want</em> to see my brother beaten? That
I really haven’t good will toward him?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed I don’t. I mean: Wouldn’t it annoy you to find you’d
always been mistaken about him?"</p>

<p>"But I’m not. I grew up in the same house with him, and I ought
to know him. If he does happen to do anything with his wild old
idea after all, it’ll be by the grace of a series of miracles
no one could possibly have foreseen."</p>

<p>"That is to say," Martha observed, "you’d call him ‘a fool for
luck.’"</p>

<p>"Let’s put it, I <em>hope</em> he is."</p>

<p>"And you were just telling me <em>I</em> didn’t change!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned placidly;—"it seems we’re neither of us wiser
than we used to be. We sit here talking of Dan and his Addition
just as we’d have been talking about them if you’d never been
away. You really ought to be speaking with a slight foreign accent
and unable to put your mind on anything later than the seventeenth
century."</p>

<p>She nodded, agreeing. "Yes, it’s queer; and it makes me <em>feel</em>
a little queer. You go away and stay for ever and ever; then you
come back home and by the time your trunk’s unpacked you’re ready
to wonder if you’ve been away at all;—maybe you’ve just had a
long dream. Of course, too, I knew what was going on at home—not
through papa!—but some of the girls of our old set here have been
faithful about writing, in spite of their every single one of
’em getting married. That makes me feel I belong to the seventeenth
century—almost ‘<em>cinquecento</em>!’"</p>

<p>"I’d prefer the ‘<em>cinquecento</em>,’" Harlan said, and immediately
added: "Not that I care for it myself."</p>

<p>"What!" she cried, her eyes widening. "You’d even criticize the
Renaissance?"</p>

<p>It appeared that he would, and willingly. Offhand he called the
Renaissance "a naïve movement amusingly overrated and with the
single merit that it was better than what had gone before." Martha
was indignant, and they had an argument in which she proved to
be no match for him. He had not been abroad since his junior vacation
as an undergraduate, but he knew a great deal more about Italy
than she did, though she had just come from long residence there.
She continued to disagree with him, and presently was surprised
by the suspicion that she enjoyed hearing him talk, and in a way,
found him congenial in spite of their differences.</p>

<p>"You’re the only person I ever heard of that criticized the Renaissance,"
she said, when he got up to go. "You’re all wrong, of course,
even if I can’t prove it. You’re too much for me, but that’s only
because you’re such an admirable bookworm."</p>

<p>Then, as he went down the long path to the gate, she observed
that his shoulders had acquired a little more habitual stoop in
them than she remembered. Otherwise the tall figure might have
been that of a thin athlete; and Harlan had a well-shaped head;—she
was readily able to comprehend what one of her friends had written
her of him: "And Harlan Oliphant seems to be just as sarcastic
as he used to be, but he <em>is</em> awfully distinguished-looking
as he grows older." Nevertheless, even in this view of his back,
Martha found something irritating, something consciously aristocratic,
over-fastidious, skeptical, and precise. "That’s just what you
are!" she said half-aloud, before she turned to go into the house.
"You can be rather fascinating, but you’re really only an admirable
bookworm in a nice, clean white collar!"</p>

<p>The admirable bookworm, unconscious that the definition of him
had been enlarged, walked down National Avenue, keeping within
the continuous shade of the big maple trees and perplexing himself
with introspections as he went. He was dry and cold, as he knew,
yet far from incapable of ardour, and he had never entirely lost
the ardour he felt for Martha; but what surprised him was the
renewed liveliness of that ancient pain she evoked within him.
He had thought it dead, but evidently it had only fallen into
a doze in her absence.</p>

<p>Of course he asked himself why he should ache because she had
at once resumed with him her old critical attitude, and why, moreover,
he should care about her at all. She had almost no coquetry and
little more of the quality called "sheer feminine charm"; she
was too downright and plain-minded to possess much of either.
She was not masculine yet, as her father said with the plaintive
irascibility of a man who knows because he has suffered, she was
imperious. "A man might as well be dead as bossed to death," he
often complained. And although she was a handsome creature and
graceful, Harlan saw a dozen prettier girls at the new Country
Club every day that he played golf there. Notwithstanding all
this, she had only to let him see her again after years of absence,
and at once his heart leaped, then ached, and he could think of
nothing but this Martha who thought so little of himself.</p>

<p>He was not the only member of his family who found Martha’s return
disturbing; his sister-in-law also had long thoughts connected
with the arrival from Italy. That evening before dinner, Dan was
whistling in his bathroom, shampooing himself lavishly, when Lena
came into his bedroom and addressed him through the open door.</p>

<p>"I suppose you’ve seen her," she said, and gave utterance to
an emotional little titter that quickly stopped his whistling.</p>

<p>He had heard such semblances of amusement from her often enough
to understand their prophetic meaning. "In for it again!" was
instantly his thought. "Seen her?" he said. "Who do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Your fair mountain range," Lena replied, affecting a light mockery.
"Of course you didn’t know she’s home again! Innocent old Dannie!"</p>

<p>"I heard she was to get here to-day, so I suppose she’s here;
but I haven’t seen her. What about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" Lena returned, continuing her archness. "Do you
suppose she can stand it?"</p>

<p>"Stand what?"</p>

<p>"Why, the sight of us—of her old sweetheart married to me," Lena
explained. "She’s stayed away till she thought she could bear
it, but do you suppose she <em>will</em> be able to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she’ll bear it," he said gruffly and went on with
his lathering.</p>

<p>"How about you? Do you think <em>you’ll</em> be able to contain
yourself when you——"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"Why don’t you ask me how she looks?" Lena inquired, still affecting
to rally him gaily. "I know you’re dying to. I’ve seen her; I
was looking from my window and saw her go out and walk up the
street this afternoon. I laughed so!"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"She was such a perfect picture of a big Western woman! Absolutely
typical!"</p>

<p>"You mean like mother, for instance?"</p>

<p>"No; your mother’s a dear thing who’d be lovely anywhere; I never
think of her as Western at all," Lena said. "She isn’t."</p>

<p>"She is as much as Martha is—or anybody else. She was born here
and——"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Lena interrupted airily. "The real Western woman
is like your mountain girl. They <em>love</em> to be huge; that’s
why they live in the prairie country—so they’ll look even bigger.
One reason I laughed was because your friend was just exactly
as much the typical Western woman after all this time abroad as
she was before she went. She was wearing all kinds of expensive
clothes, and I haven’t a doubt she’d got them in Paris, but on
her they looked perfectly as Western as if she’d just bought ’em
and put ’em on downtown at Kohn &amp; Sons! Do you suppose you’ll
be able to control your raptures at all when you meet her again,
old innocent Dannie?"</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "I wish you’d let me get fixed for dinner.
I had a pretty hot day’s work and I’d like to——"</p>

<p>"Of course you would!" Lena said. "You’d like to make yourself
beautiful because you’re going to hurry over there to her just
as soon as you’ve finished your dinner, aren’t you? That’s what
you have been planning, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; certainly," he answered. "I’d like to have you go
with me. She’s an old friend of mine and all our family; she’s
been away a long time, and it wouldn’t look very cordial not to——"</p>

<p>"Why, no; so it wouldn’t!" Lena mocked, but now her mockery was
openly acrid. "It wouldn’t look <em>cordial</em> and naturally
you’d hate to have her think you lacked cordiality—a woman you
were so cordial with you wanted your child to grow up to be like
her instead of like its mother!—a woman you were so cordial with
you had to hold her hand the very day you brought your bride home!
It would be <em>terrible</em> to have her think——"</p>

<p>But here Dan closed the door, though not so sharply as Lena closed
the outer door of his bedroom when she went out of it an instant
later.</p>

<p>The subject of Martha’s return was not again mentioned directly
during the evening; and after dinner, when Lena with arch significance
inquired of her silent husband why he had settled down at the
library table to write business letters when there was "so much
to do in the neighbourhood," Dan replied, without looking up,
that his letters were important—he’d have to beg to be excused
from talking. Lena picked up a book, and retired to the easy-chair
and the lamp in the bay window, which had once been Harlan’s favourite
reading place; but she did not read. She sat looking steadily
at her husband—as he thoroughly and uncomfortably understood,
though he kept doggedly at his writing.</p>

<p>After a time his mother and father were heard in the hall, going
out; and he knew that they were "going over next door" to bid
Martha welcome home. They had not mentioned where they were going,
and he understood the significance of their not mentioning it—and
so did Lena, as she sat watching him. He wondered why he did not
rise and say to her: "There’s an old friend of mine next door;
I haven’t seen her for years; I ought to go over and tell her
I’m glad she’s home, and I want to! There’s no reason I shouldn’t,
and you can make the most of it—I’m going!"</p>

<p>Lena had her own wonderings. She wondered why she was keeping
her husband from going. Her thought was that she ought to say:
"I don’t think I care for you enough any more to have a right
to be jealous. Go to your old friend and tell her you’re glad
she’s home again, since you wish to. I’m not so small about it
as I’m making you think, and I really don’t care."</p>

<p>Lena wondered why she did not say this to her husband;—in a manner
she wanted to say it, and at the same time she knew that she would
say nothing of the kind, but on the contrary, intended to keep
him in fear of what she might do if he made any effort to appear
"cordial," as he had said, to Martha. Thus the husband and wife
sat—the husband bent over his writing and the wife looking at
him, her book in her lap. When she looked away from him it was
not to the book that her gaze went, but to the wall across the
room, where she saw nothing to please her; and when she had looked
at the wall for a time she always looked again at Dan. His own
eyes were kept to the writing upon the table, yet he must have
been conscious of hers when they were upon him, for a deeper frown
came upon his forehead whenever she looked away from the wall
and again at him.</p>

<p>After a while Mr. and Mrs. Oliphant were heard returning, and
in the library it somehow seemed strange, and like an event out
of nature’s order, to hear such brisk and cheerful sounds, when
the front door opened, letting in the two voices and their owners
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Indeed she <em>is</em>!" Mrs. Oliphant was heard to say, while
her husband continued a narrative evidently begun outside.</p>

<p>"And I told her so. I said, ‘By George, if an old maid’s a person
who just gets lovelier and lovelier, Martha, why, then, maybe
you’re——’"</p>

<p>But here his voice so abruptly dropped to a mumble no one could
have doubted that the suppression was in obedience to a tactful
gesture of his wife’s; nor was it difficult to picture this gesture
as a movement of Mrs. Oliphant’s hand toward the open door of
the library. Immediately afterward the two were heard ascending
the stairs; the house again became as quiet as before; Dan went
on with his writing, and Lena with her looking and wondering.</p>

<p>Often such a vigil between husband and wife does not end by leaving
things as they were before it began. Between the two silent people
appear to have taken place communications so imperceptible that
neither is definitely aware of them, yet each may be affected
by them as if by words spoken. It would seem that there is a danger
here; for with couples not well wedded the unspoken words may
be too true, or may carry altogether too much revelation. Lena
stopped wondering; and then rather slowly it became clear to her
that she and her husband no longer cared for each other at all.
Long, long she had clung to her belief that she was still in love
with him; and now all she had left to her of this was that she
could still be jealous of him. "A fine reason for not leaving
a man!" she said to herself;—especially a man who really cared
about nothing but his business and his boy!</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose from her chair, the book in her lap falling
to the floor, where she let it remain; and then she stood still,
while Dan glanced up inquiringly from his work and met the strange,
examining, hostile look she gave him.</p>

<p>There was a final moment of silence between them before Lena
hurried across the room and left him. A minute later Dan rubbed
his forehead, wondering again. Upstairs, Lena had not slammed
her door.</p>

<p>He had an absent-minded impression that something had happened,
but as its nature seemed indefinite, and he had now become more
interested in his letters than in Martha’s return or Lena’s temper,
he bent again to his work and kept at it with zest until after
midnight. </p>
