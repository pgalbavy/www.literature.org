<P>
THE conference between Lady Lydiard and Mr. Troy, on the way back
to London, led to some practical results.
<P>
Hearing from her legal adviser that the inquiry after the missing
money was for a moment at a standstill, Lady Lydiard made one of
those bold suggestions with which she was accustomed to startle
her friends in cases of emergency. She had heard favorable
reports of the extraordinary ingenuity of the French police; and
she now proposed sending to Paris for assistance, after first
consulting her nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir. "Felix knows Paris as
well as he knows London," she remarked. "He is an idle man, and
it is quite likely that he will relieve us of all trouble by
taking the matter into his own hands. In any case, he is sure to
know who are the right people to address in our present
necessity. What do you say?"
<P>
Mr. Troy, in reply, expressed his doubts as to the wisdom of
employing foreigners in a delicate investigation which required
an accurate knowledge of English customs and English character.
Waiving this objection, he approved of the idea of consulting her
Ladyship's nephew. "Mr. Sweetsir is a man of the world," he said.
"In putting the case before him, we are sure to have it presented
to us from a new point of view." Acting on this favorable
expression of opinion, Lady Lydiard wrote to her nephew. On the
day after the visit to Miss Pink, the proposed council of three
was held at Lady Lydiard's house.
<P>
Felix, never punctual at keeping an appointment, was even later
than usual on this occasion. He made his apologies with his hand
pressed upon his forehead, and his voice expressive of the
languor and discouragement of a suffering man.
<P>
"The beastly English climate is telling on my nerves," said Mr.
Sweetsir--"the horrid weight of the atmosphere, after the
exhilarating air of Paris; the intolerable dirt and dullness of
London, you know. I was in bed, my dear aunt, when I received
your letter. You may imagine the completely demoralised?? state I
was in, when I tell you of the effect which the news of the
robbery produced on me. I fell back on my pillow, as if I had
been shot. Your Ladyship should really be a little more careful
in communicating these disagreeable surprises to a
sensitively-organised man. Never mind--my valet is a perfect
treasure; he brought me some drops of ether on a lump of sugar. I
said, 'Alfred' (his name is Alfred), 'put me into my clothes!'
Alfred put me in. I assure you it reminded me of my young days,
when I was put into my first pair of trousers. Has Alfred
forgotten anything? Have I got my braces on? Have I come out in
my shirt-sleeves? Well, dear aunt;--well, Mr. Troy!--what can I
say? What can I do?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard, entirely without sympathy for nervous suffering,
nodded to the lawyer. "You tell him," she said.
<P>
"I believe I speak for her Ladyship," Mr. Troy began, "when I say
that we should like to hear, in the first place, how the whole
case strikes you, Mr. Sweetsir?"
<P>
"Tell it me all over again," said Felix.
<P>
Patient Mr. Troy told it all over again--and waited for the
result.
<P>
"Well?" said Felix.
<P>
"Well?" said Mr. Troy. "Where does the suspicion of robbery rest
in your opinion? You look at the theft of the bank-note with a
fresh eye."
<P>
"You mentioned a clergyman just now," said Felix. "The man, you
know, to whom the money was sent. What was his name?"
<P>
"The Reverend Samuel Bradstock."
<P>
"You want me to name the person whom I suspect?"
<P>
"Yes, if you please," said Mr. Troy.
<P>
"I suspect the Reverend Samuel Bradstock," said Felix.
<P>
"If you have come here to make stupid jokes," interposed Lady
Lydiard, "you had better go back to your bed again. We want a
serious opinion."
<P>
"You _have_ a serious opinion," Felix coolly rejoined. "I never
was more in earnest in my life. Your Ladyship is not aware of the
first principle to be adopted in cases of suspicion. One proceeds
on what I will call the exhaustive system of reasoning. Thus:
Does suspicion point to the honest servants downstairs? No. To
your Ladyship's adopted daughter? Appearances are against the
poor girl; but you know her better than to trust to appearances.
Are you suspicious of Moody? No. Of Hardyman--who was in the
house at the time? Ridiculous! But I was in the house at the
time, too. Do you suspect Me? Just so! That idea is ridiculous,
too. Now let us sum up. Servants, adopted daughter, Moody,
Hardyman, Sweetsir--all beyond suspicion. Who is left? The
Reverend Samuel Bradstock."
<P>
This ingenious exposition of "the exhaustive system of
reasoning," failed to produce any effect on Lady Lydiard. "You
are wasting our time," she said sharply. "You know as well as I
do that you are talking nonsense."
<P>
"I don't," said Felix. "Taking the gentlemanly professions all
round, I know of no men who are so eager to get money, and who
have so few scruples about how they get it, as the parsons. Where
is there a man in any other profession who perpetually worries
you for money?--who holds the bag under your nose for money?--who
sends his clerk round from door to door to beg a few shillings of
you, and calls it an 'Easter offering'? The parson does all this.
Bradstock is a parson. I put it logically. Bowl me over, if you
can."
<P>
Mr. Troy attempted to "bowl him over," nevertheless. Lady Lydiard
wisely interposed.
<P>
"When a man persists in talking nonsense," she said, "silence is
the best answer; anything else only encourages him." She turned
to Felix. "I have a question to ask you," she went on. "You will
either give me a serious reply, or wish me good-morning." With
this brief preface, she made her inquiry as to the wisdom and
possibility of engaging the services of the French police.
<P>
Felix took exactly the view of the matter which had been already
expressed by Mr. Troy. "Superior in intelligence," he said, "but
not superior in courage, to the English police. Capable of
performing wonders on their own ground and among their own
people. But, my dear aunt, the two most dissimilar nations on the
face of the earth are the English and the French. The French
police may speak our language--but they are incapable of
understanding our national character and our national manners.
Set them to work on a private inquiry in the city of Pekin--and
they would get on in time with the Chinese people. Set them to
work in the city of London--and the English people would remain,
from first to last, the same impenetrable mystery to them. In my
belief the London Sunday would be enough of itself to drive them
back to Paris in despair. No balls, no concerts, no theaters, not
even a museum or a picture-gallery open; every shop shut up but
the gin-shop; and nothing moving but the church bells and the men
who sell the penny ices. Hundreds of Frenchmen come to see me on
their first arrival in England. Every man of them rushes back to
Paris on the second Saturday of his visit, rather than confront
the horrors of a second Sunday in London! However, you can try it
if you like. Send me a written abstract of the case, and I will
forward it to one of the official people in the Rue Jerusalem,
who will do anything he can to oblige me. Of course," said Felix,
turning to Mr. Troy, "some of you have got the number of the lost
bank-note? If the thief has tried to pass it in Paris, my man may
be of some use to you."
<P>
"Three of us have got the number of the note," answered Mr. Troy;
"Miss Isabel Miller, Mr. Moody, and myself."
<P>
"Very good," said Felix. "Send me the number, with the abstract
of the case. Is there anything else I can do towards recovering
the money?" he asked, turning to his aunt. "There is one lucky
circumstance in connection with this loss--isn't there? It has
fallen on a person who is rich enough to take it easy. Good
heavens! suppose it had been _my_ loss!"
<P>
"It has fallen doubly on me," said Lady Lydiard; "and I am
certainly not rich enough to take it _that_ easy. The money was
destined to a charitable purpose; and I have felt it my duty to
pay it again."
<P>
Felix rose and approached his aunt's chair with faltering steps,
as became a suffering man. He took Lady Lydiard's hand and kissed
it with enthusiastic admiration.
<P>
"You excellent creature!" he said. "You may not think it, but you
reconcile me to human nature. How generous! how noble! I think
I'll go to bed again, Mr. Troy, if you really don't want any more
of me. My head feels giddy and my legs tremble under me. It
doesn't matter; I shall feel easier when Alfred has taken me out
of my clothes again. God bless you, my dear aunt! I never felt so
proud of being related to you as I do to-day. Good-morning Mr.
Troy! Don't forget the abstract of the case; and don't trouble
yourself to see me to the door. I dare say I shan't tumble
downstairs; and, if I do, there's the porter in the hall to pick
me up again. Enviable porter! as fat as butter and as idle as a
pig! _Au revoir! au revoir!_" He kissed his hand, and drifted
feebly out of the room. Sweetsir one might say, in a state of
eclipse; but still the serviceable Sweetsir, who was never
consulted in vain by the fortunate people privileged to call him
friend!
<P>
"Is he really ill, do you think?" Mr. Troy asked.
<P>
"My nephew has turned fifty," Lady Lydiard answered, "and he
persists in living as if he was a young man. Every now and then
Nature says to him, 'Felix, you are old!' And Felix goes to bed,
and says it's his nerves."
<P>
"I suppose he is to be trusted to keep his word about writing to
Paris?" pursued the lawyer.
<P>
"Oh, yes! He may delay doing it but he will do it. In spite of
his lackadaisical manner, he has moments of energy that would
surprise you. Talking of surprises, I have something to tell you
about Moody. Within the last day or two there has been a marked
change in him--a change for the worse."
<P>
"You astonish me, Lady Lydiard! In what way has Moody
deteriorated?"
<P>
"You shall hear. Yesterday was Friday. You took him out with you,
on business, early in the morning."
<P>
Mr. Troy bowed, and said nothing. He had not thought it desirable
to mention the interview at which Old Sharon had cheated him of
his guinea.
<P>
"In the course of the afternoon," pursued Lady Lydiard, "I
happened to want him, and I was informed that Moody had gone out
again. Where had he gone? Nobody knew. Had he left word when he
would be back? He had left no message of any sort. Of course, he
is not in the position of an ordinary servant. I don't expect him
to ask permission to go out. But I do expect him to leave word
downstairs of the time at which he is likely to return. When he
did
 come back, after an absence of some hours, I naturally asked for
an explanation. Would you believe it? he simply informed me that
he had been away on business of his own; expressed no regret, and
offered no explanation--in short, spoke as if he was an
independent gentleman. You may not think it, but I kept my
temper. I merely remarked that I hoped it would not happen again.
He made me a bow, and he said, 'My business is not completed yet,
my Lady. I cannot guarantee that it may not call me away again at
a moment's notice.' What do you think of that? Nine people out of
ten would have given him warning to leave their service. I begin
to think I am a wonderful woman--I only pointed to the door. One
does hear sometimes of men's brains softening in the most
unexpected manner. I have my suspicions of Moody's brains, I can
tell you."
<P>
Mr. Troy's suspicions took a different direction: they pointed
along the line of streets which led to Old Sharon's lodgings.
Discreetly silent as to the turn which his thoughts had taken, he
merely expressed himself as feeling too much surprised to offer
any opinion at all.
<P>
"Wait a little," said Lady Lydiard, "I haven't done surprising
you yet. You have been a boy here in a page's livery, I think?
Well, he is a good boy; and he has gone home for a week's holiday
with his friends. The proper person to supply his place with the
boots and shoes and other small employments, is of course the
youngest footman, a lad only a few years older than himself. What
do you think Moody does? Engages a stranger, with the house full
of idle men-servants already, to fill the page's place. At
intervals this morning I heard them wonderfully merry in the
servants hall--_so_ merry that the noise and laughter found its
way upstairs to the breakfast-room. I like my servants to be in
good spirits; but it certainly did strike me that they were
getting beyond reasonable limits. I questioned my maid, and was
informed that the noise was all due to the jokes of the strangest
old man that ever was seen. In other words, to the person whom my
steward had taken it on himself to engage in the page's absence.
I spoke to Moody on the subject. He answered in an odd, confused
way, that he had exercised his discretion to the best of his
judgment and that (if I wished it), he would tell the old man to
keep his good spirits under better control. I asked him how he
came to hear of the man. He only answered, 'By accident, my
Lady'--and not one more word could I get out of him, good or bad.
Moody engages the servants, as you know; but on every other
occasion he has invariably consulted me before an engagement was
settled. I really don't feel at all sure about this person who
has been so strangely introduced into the house--he may be a
drunkard or a thief. I wish you would speak to Moody yourself,
Mr. Troy. Do you mind ringing the bell?"
<P>
Mr. Troy rose, as a matter of course, and rang the bell.
<P>
He was by this time, it is needless to say, convinced that Moody
had not only gone back to consult Old Sharon on his own
responsibility, but worse still, had taken the unwarrantable
liberty of introducing him, as a spy, into the house. To
communicate this explanation to Lady Lydiard would, in her
present humor, be simply to produce the dismissal of the steward
from her service. The only other alternative was to ask leave to
interrogate Moody privately, and, after duly reproving him, to
insist on the departure of Old Sharon as the one condition on
which Mr. Troy would consent to keep Lady Lydiard in ignorance of
the truth.
<P>
"I think I shall manage better with Moody, if your Ladyship will
permit me to see him in private," the lawyer said. "Shall I go
downstairs and speak with him in his own room?"
<P>
"Why should you trouble yourself to do that?" said her Ladyship.
"See him here; and I will go into the boudoir."
<P>
As she made that reply, the footman appeared at the drawing-room
door.
<P>
"Send Moody here," said Lady Lydiard.
<P>
The footman's answer, delivered at that moment, assumed an
importance which was not expressed in the footman's words. "My
Lady," he said, "Mr. Moody has gone out."
