<p>Mr. Parcher, that unhappy gentleman, having been driven indoors
from his own porch, had attempted to read Plutarch's Lives in
the library, but, owing to the adjacency of the porch and the
summer necessity for open windows, his escape spared only his
eyes and not his suffering ears. The house was small, being but
half of a double one, with small rooms, and the "parlor," library,
and dining-room all about equally exposed to the porch which ran
along the side of the house. Mr. Parcher had no refuge except
bed or the kitchen, and as he was troubled with chronic insomnia,
and the cook had callers in the kitchen, his case was desperate.
Most unfortunately, too, his reading-lamp, the only one in the
house, was a fixture near a window, and just beyond that window
sat Miss Pratt and William in sweet unconsciousness, while Miss
Parcher entertained the overflow (consisting of Mr. Johnnie Watson)
at the other end of the porch. Listening perforce to the conversation
of the former couple though "conversation" is far from the expression
later used by Mr. Parcher to describe what he heard&mdash;he found
it impossible to sit still in his chair. He jerked and twitched
with continually increasing restlessness; sometimes he gasped,
and other times he moaned a little, and there were times when
he muttered huskily.</p>

<p>"Oh, cute-ums!" came the silvery voice of Miss Pratt from the
likewise silvery porch outside, underneath the summer moon. "Darlin'
Flopit, look! Ickle boy Baxter goin' make imitations of darlin'
Flopit again. See! Ickle boy Baxter puts head one side, then other
side, just like darlin' Flopit. Then barks just like darlin' Flopit!
Ladies and 'entlemen, imitations of darlin' Flopit by ickle boy
Baxter."</p>

<p>"Berp-werp! Berp-werp!" came the voice of William Sylvanus Baxter.</p>

<p>And in the library Plutarch's Lives moved convulsively, while
with writhing lips Mr. Parcher muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"More, more!" cried Miss Pratt, clapping her hands. "Do it again,
ickle boy Baxter!"</p>

<p>"Berp-werp! Berp-werp-werp!"</p>

<p>"<em>WORD!" </em>muttered Mr. Parcher.</p>

<p>Miss Pratt's voice became surcharged with honeyed wonder. "How
did he learn such marv'lous, <em>MARV'LOUS </em>imitations of
darlin' Flopit? He ought to go on the big, big stage and be a
really actor, oughtn't he, darlin' Flopit? He could make milyums
and milyums of dollardies, couldn't he, darlin' Flopit?"</p>

<p>William's modest laugh disclaimed any great ambition for himself
in this line. "Oh, I always could think up imitations of animals;
things like that&mdash;but I hardly would care to&mdash;to adop' the stage
for a career. Would&mdash;you?" (There was a thrill in his voice when
he pronounced the ineffably significant word "you.")</p>

<p>Miss Pratt became intensely serious.</p>

<p>"It's my <em>DREAM!" </em>she said.</p>

<p>William, seated upon a stool at her feet, gazed up at the amber
head, divinely splashed by the rain of moonlight. The fire with
which she spoke stirred him as few things had ever stirred him.
He knew she had just revealed a side of herself which she reserved
for only the chosen few who were capable of understanding her,
and he fell into a hushed rapture. It seemed to him that there
was a sacredness about this moment, and he sought vaguely for
something to say that would live up to it and not be out of keeping.
Then, like an inspiration, there came into his head some words
he had read that day and thought beautiful. He had found them
beneath an illustration in a magazine, and he spoke them almost
instinctively.</p>

<p>"It was wonderful of you to say that to me," he said. "I shall
never forget it!"</p>

<p>"It's my <em>DREAM!" </em>Miss Pratt exclaimed, again, with the
same enthusiasm. "It's my <em>DREAM</em>."</p>

<p>"You would make a glorious actress!" he said.</p>

<p>At that her mood changed. She laughed a laugh like a sweet little
girl's laugh (not Jane's) and, setting her rocking-chair in motion,
cuddled the fuzzy white doglet in her arms. "Ickle boy Baxter
t'yin' flatterbox us, tunnin' Flopit! No'ty, no'ty flatterbox!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" William insisted, earnestly. "I mean it. But&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But whatcums?"</p>

<p>"What do you think about actors and actresses making love to
each other on the stage? Do you think they have to really feel
it, or do they just pretend?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Pratt, weightily, "sometimes one way, sometimes
the other."</p>

<p>William's gravity became more and more profound. "Yes, but how
can they pretend like that? Don't you think love is a sacred thing,
Cousin Lola?"</p>

<p>Fictitious sisterships, brotherships, and cousinships are devices
to push things along, well known to seventeen and even more advanced
ages. On the wonderful evening of their first meeting William
and Miss Pratt had cozily arranged to be called, respectively,
"Ickle boy Baxter" and "Cousin Lola." (Thus they had broken down
the tedious formalities of their first twenty minutes together.)</p>

<p>"Don't you think love is sacred?" he repeated in the deepest
tone of which his vocal cords were capable.</p>

<p>"Ess," said Miss Pratt.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> do!" William was emphatic. "I think love is the most
sacred thing there is. I don't mean <em>SOME </em>kinds of love.
I mean <em>REAL </em>love. You take some people, I don't believe
they ever know what real love means. They <em>TALK </em>about
it, maybe, but they don't understand it. Love is something nobody
can understand unless they feel it and and if they don't understand
it they don't feel it. Don't <em>YOU </em>think so?"</p>

<p>"Ess."</p>

<p>"Love," William continued, his voice lifting and thrilling to
the great theme&mdash;"love is something nobody can ever have but one
time in their lives, and if they don't have it then, why prob'ly
they never will. Now, if a man <em>REALLY </em>loves a girl, why
he'd do anything in the world she wanted him to. Don't <em>YOU
</em>think so?"</p>

<p>"Ess, 'deedums!" said the silvery voice.</p>

<p>"But if he didn't, then he wouldn't," said William vehemently.
"But when a man really loves a girl he will. Now, you take a man
like that and he can generally do just about anything the girl
he loves wants him to. Say, f'rinstance, she wants him to love
her even more than he does already&mdash;or almost anything like that&mdash;and
supposin' she asks him to. Well, he would go ahead and do it.
If they really loved each other he would!"</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then in a lowered tone he said, "I think
<em>REAL </em>love is sacred, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Ess."</p>

<p>"Don't you think love is the most sacred thing there is&mdash;that
is, if it's <em>REAL </em>love?"</p>

<p>"Ess."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> do," said William, warmly. "I &mdash;I'm glad you
feel like that, because I think real love is the kind nobody could
have but just once in their lives, but if it isn't <em>REAL </em>love,
why&mdash;why most people never have it at all, because&mdash;" He paused,
seeming to seek for the exact phrase which would express his meaning.
" &mdash;Because the <em>REAL </em>love a man feels for a girl
and a girl for a man, if they <em>REALLY </em>love each other,
and, you look at a case like that, of course they would <em>BOTH
</em>love each other, or it wouldn't be real love well, what <em>I</em>
say is, if it's <em>REAL </em>love, well, it's&mdash;it's sacred, because
I think that kind of love is always sacred. Don't you think love
is sacred if it's the real thing?"</p>

<p>"Ess," said Miss Pratt. "Do Flopit again. Be Flopit!"</p>

<p>"Berp-werp! Berp-werp-werp."</p>

<p>And within the library an agonized man writhed and muttered:</p>

<p>"<em>WORD! WORD! WORD</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>This hoarse repetition had become almost continuous.</p>

<p>... But out on the porch, that little, jasmine-scented bower
in Arcady where youth cried to youth and golden heads were haloed
in the moonshine, there fell a silence. Not utter silence, for
out there an ethereal music sounded constantly, unheard and forgotten
by older ears. Time was when the sly playwrights used "incidental
music" in their dramas; they knew that an audience would be moved
so long as the music played; credulous while that crafty enchantment
lasted. And when the galled Mr. Parcher wondered how those young
people out on the porch could listen to each other and not die,
it was because he did not hear and had forgotten the music that
throbs in the veins of youth. Nevertheless, it may not be denied
that despite his poor memory this man of fifty was deserving of
a little sympathy.</p>

<p>It was William who broke the silence. "How&mdash;" he began, and his
voice trembled a little. "How&mdash;how do you&mdash;how do you think of
me when I'm not with you?"</p>

<p>"Think nice-cums," Miss Pratt responded. "Flopit an' me think
nice-cums."</p>

<p>"No," said William; "I mean what name do you have for me when
you're when you're thinking about me?"</p>

<p>Miss Pratt seemed to be puzzled, perhaps justifiably, and she
made a cooing sound of interrogation.</p>

<p>"I mean like this," William explained. "F'rinstance, when you
first came, I always thought of you as 'Milady'&mdash;when I wrote
that poem, you know."</p>

<p>"Ess. Boo'fums."</p>

<p>"But now I don't," he said. "Now I think of you by another name
when I'm alone. It&mdash;it just sort of came to me. I was kind of
just sitting around this afternoon, and I didn't know I was thinking
about anything at all very much, and then all of a sudden I said
it to myself out loud. It was about as strange a thing as I ever
knew of. Don't <em>YOU </em>think so?"</p>

<p>"Ess. It uz dest <em>WEIRD!" </em>she answered. "What <em>ARE
</em>dat pitty names?"</p>

<p>"I called you," said William, huskily and reverently, "I called
you 'My Baby-Talk Lady.'"</p>

<p><em>BANG</em>!</p>

<p>They were startled by a crash from within the library; a heavy
weight seemed to have fallen (or to have been hurled) a considerable
distance. Stepping to the window, William beheld a large volume
lying in a distorted attitude at the foot of the wall opposite
to that in which the reading-lamp was a fixture. But of all human
life the room was empty; for Mr. Parcher had given up, and was
now hastening to his bed in the last faint hope of saving his
reason.</p>

<p>His symptoms, however, all pointed to its having fled; and his
wife, looking up from some computations in laundry charges, had
but a vision of windmill gestures as he passed the door of her
room. Then, not only for her, but for the inoffensive people who
lived in the other half of the house, the closing of his own door
took place in a really memorable manner.</p>

<p>William, gazing upon the fallen Plutarch, had just offered the
explanation, "Somebody must 'a' thrown it at a bug or something,
I guess," when the second explosion sent its reverberations through
the house.</p>

<p>"My doodness!" Miss Pratt exclaimed, jumping up.</p>

<p>William laughed reassuringly, remaining calm. "It's only a door
blew shut up-stairs," he said "Let's sit down again&mdash;just the
way we were?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, Mr. Joe Bullitt now made his appearance
at the other end of the porch. Mr. Bullitt, though almost a year
younger than either William or Johnnie Watson, was of a turbulent
and masterful disposition. Moreover, in regard to Miss Pratt,
his affections were in as ardent a state as those of his rivals,
and he lacked Johnnie's meekness. He firmly declined to be shunted
by Miss Parcher, who was trying to favor William's cause, according
to a promise he had won of her by strong pleading. Regardless
of her efforts, Mr. Bullitt descended upon William and his Baby-Talk-Lady,
and received from the latter a honeyed greeting, somewhat to the
former's astonishment and not at all to his pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody-cute!" cried Miss Pratt. "Here's big Bruvva Josie-Joe!"
And she lifted her little dog close to Mr. Bullitt's face, guiding
one of Flopit's paws with her fingers. "Stroke big Bruvva Josie-Joe's
pint teeks, darlin' Flopit." (Josie-Joe's pink cheeks were indicated
by the expression "pint teeks," evidently, for her accompanying
action was to pass Flopit's paw lightly over those glowing surfaces.)
"'At's nice!"  she remarked. "Stroke him gently, p'eshus Flopit,
an' nen we'll coax him to make pitty singin' for us, like us did
yestiday."</p>

<p>She turned to William.</p>

<p>"<em>COAX </em>him to make pitty singin'? I <em>LOVE </em>his
voice &mdash;I'm dest <em>CRAZY </em>over it. Isn't oo?"</p>

<p>William's passion for Mr. Bullitt's voice appeared to be under
control. He laughed coldly, almost harshly. "Him sing?" he said.
"Has he been tryin' to sing around <em>HERE? I </em>wonder the
family didn't call for the police!"</p>

<p>It was to be seen that Mr. Bullitt did not relish the sally.
"Well, they will," he retorted, "if you ever spring one o' your
solos on 'em!" And turning to Miss Pratt, he laughed loudly and
bitterly. "You ought to hear Silly Bill sing&mdash;some time when you
don't mind goin' to bed sick for a couple o' days!"</p>

<p>Symptoms of truculence at once became alarmingly pronounced on
both sides. William was naturally incensed, and as for Mr. Bullitt,
he had endured a great deal from William every evening since Miss
Pratt's arrival. William's evening clothes were hard enough for
both Mr. Watson and Mr. Bullitt to bear, without any additional
insolence on the part of the wearer. Big Bruvva Josie-Joe took
a step toward his enemy and breathed audibly.</p>

<p>"Let's <em>ALL </em>sing," the tactful Miss Pratt proposed, hastily.
"Come on, May and Cousin Johnnie-Jump-Up," she called to Miss
Parcher and Mr. Watson. "Singin'-school, dirls an' boys! Singin'-school!
Ding, ding! Singin'-school bell's a-wingin'!"</p>

<p>The diversion was successful. Miss Parcher and Mr. Watson joined
the other group with alacrity, and the five young people were
presently seated close together upon the steps of the porch, sending
their voices out upon the air and up to Mr. Parcher's window in
the song they found loveliest that summer.</p>

<p>Miss Pratt carried the air. William also carried it part of the
time and hunted for it the rest of the time, though never in silence.
Miss Parcher "sang alto," Mr. Bullitt "sang bass," and Mr. Watson
"sang tenor"&mdash;that is, he sang as high as possible, often making
the top sound of a chord and always repeating the last phrase
of each line before the others finished it. The melody was a little
too sweet, possibly; while the singers thought so highly of the
words that Mr. Parcher missed not one, especially as the vocal
rivalry between Josie-Joe and Ickle Boy Baxter incited each of
them to prevent Miss Pratt from hearing the other.</p>

<p>William sang loudest of all; Mr. Parcher had at no time any difficulty
in recognizing his voice.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Oh, I love my love in the morning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I love my love at night,<br/>
I love my love in the dawning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the stars are bright.<br/>
Some may love the sunshine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may love the dew.<br/>
Some may love the raindrops,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I love only you-<em>OO-</em>oo!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the stars up above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is you I luh-<em>HUV!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yes, <em>I</em> love own-<em>LAY </em>you!"

</p>
</div>
<p>They sang it four times; then Mr. Bullitt sang his solo, "Tell
her, O Golden Moon, how I Adore her," William following with "The
violate loves the cowslip, but <em>I</em> love <em>YEW," </em>and
after that they all sang, "Oh, I love my love in the morning,"
again.</p>

<p>All this while that they sang of love, Mr. Parcher was moving
to and fro upon his bed, not more than eighteen feet in an oblique
upward-slanting line from the heads of the serenaders. Long, long
he tossed, listening to the young voices singing of love; long,
long he thought of love, and many, many times he spoke of it aloud,
though he was alone in the room. And in thus speaking of it, he
would give utterance to phrases and words probably never before
used in connection with love since the world began.</p>

<p>His thoughts, and, at intervals, his mutterings, continued to
be active far into the night, long after the callers had gone,
and though his household and the neighborhood were at rest, with
never a katydid outside to rail at the waning moon. And by a coincidence
not more singular than most coincidences, it happened that at
just about the time he finally fell asleep, a young lady at no
great distance from him awoke to find her self thinking of him.</p>
