<p>Five minutes of plunging and slipping brought him down to the main
road that gleamed a dim gray in the blackness. A quarter of a mile
east lay the wharfs, the general store, and some of the best dwellings
in Freekirk Head.
</p><p>Ahead of him in the road he could see lanterns bobbing, and the
illuminated legs of the men who carried them running. Behind he heard
the muffled pound of boots in thick dust, and the hoarse panting of
others racing toward the scene of the trouble. The frantic screeching
of the steamer's whistle (that was not yet silent) had done its work
well. Freekirk Head was up in arms.
</p><p>Instinctively and naturally Code Schofield ran, just as he had run
from his father's house since he was ten years old. His long, easy
stride carried him quickly over the ground, and he passed two or three
of those ahead with lanterns. They shouted at him.
</p><p>"Hey, what's the trouble?" panted one. "Know anything about it?"
</p><p>"No, but it might be the wharfs," he replied, without stopping. He
veered out to the edge of the road so as to avoid any more queries. He
looked with suspicion now on all these men.
</p><p>Who of them, he wondered, was not, in his heart, convicting him of
those things Elsa Mallaby had mentioned? His straightforward nature
revolted against the hypocrisy in men that bade them treat him as they
had done all his life, and yet think of him only as a criminal.
</p><p>Suddenly the dull red that had glowed dimly against the sky burst into
rosy bloom. A great tongue of fire leaped up and licked the heavens,
while floating down the brisk breeze came the distant mingling of
men's shouts. As he passed a white wooden gate he heard a woman on the
porch crying, and a child's voice in impatient question.
</p><p>Then for the first time he lost sight of his own distress and thought
of the misery of his whole people. It was August, and the Indians
should soon be coming from the mainland to spear porpoises.
</p><p>The dulce-pickers on the back of the island reported a good yield from
the rocks at low tide, but outside of these few there was wretchedness
from Anthony's Nose to Southern Cross.
</p><p>The fish had failed.
</p><p>A hundred years and more had the Grande Mignon fishermen gone out with
net and handline and trawl; and for that length of time the millions
in the sea had fed, clothed, and housed the thousand on the island.
When prices had been good there were even luxuries, and history tells
of men who, in one haul from a weir, have made their twenty-five
thousand dollars in an hour.
</p><p>This was all gone now. The fish had failed.
</p><p>Day after day since early spring the men had put to sea in their
sloops and motor-dories, trawling and hand-lining from twenty miles
out in the Atlantic to four and a half fathoms off Dutch Edge. The
result was the same. The fish were poor and few. Even at Bulkhead Rip,
where the sixty-pounders played among the racing tides, there was
scarcely a bite.
</p><p>A fisherman lives on luck, so for a month there was no remark upon the
suddenly changed condition. But after that, as the days passed and not
a full dory raced up to Bill Boughton's fish stand, muttered whispers
and old tales went up and down the island.
</p><p>It was recalled that the fish left a certain Norwegian coast once for
a period of fifty years, and that the whole occupation of the people
of that coast was changed. Was that to be the fate of Grande Mignon?
If so, what could they do? Extensive farming on the rocky island was
impossible, and not one ship had ever been built there for the trade.
Where would things end?
</p><p>So it had gone until now, in the middle of August, the people of
Freekirk Head, Seal Cove, and Great Harbor, the main villages along
the front or Atlantic side of the island, were face to face with the
question of actual life or death.
</p><p>So far the season's catch was barely up to that of a good month in
normal times; credit was low, and salting and drying were almost
useless, for the people ate most of their own catch. Things were at a
standstill.
</p><p>And now the fire on top of all!
</p><p>Captain Code Schofield thought of all these things as he ran along the
King's Road toward the fire. Now he was almost upon it, and could see
that the fish stand and wharf of the two wealthiest men in the village
were burning furiously. The roar of the flames came to him.
</p><p>A hundred yards back from the water stood Bill Boughton's general
store, and next it, in a row, dwellings; typical white fishermen's
cottages with green blinds and a flower-filled dory in the front
yard.
</p><p>The King's Road divided at Bill Boughton's store, the branch leading
down to the wharfs, while the main road went on to Swallowtail Light.
Schofield plunged down the branch into the full glare of the fire,
where a crowd of men had already gathered.
</p><p>As good luck would have it there was not a vessel tied up to the
stand, the whole fleet being made fast to its moorings in the bay.
Code's first duty when he started running had been to make sure that
his <u>Laughing Lass</u> was riding safely at her anchorage.
</p><p>The burning wharfs faced south. The brisk breeze was southeast and
bore a promise of possible rain. The steamer <u>Grande Mignon</u>, after
giving the first warning, had steamed away from her perilous dockage
to a point half a mile nearer the entrance to the bay, and now lay
there shrieking until the frowning cliffs and abrupt hills echoed with
the hideous noise.
</p><p>"How'd it happen?" asked Schofield of the first man he met.
</p><p>"Dunno exactly. Cal'late some tanks in the oilroom caught first. Can't
do much with them wharfs, I guess."
</p><p>"Who's in charge of things here?"
</p><p>"The squire."
</p><p>Schofield hurried away in search of Squire Hardy, head man of the
village, and local justice of the peace. He found him working like a
Trojan, his white whiskers ruffled into a circle about his face.
</p><p>"Lend us a hand here, Code," yelled the squire, who with three other
men was attempting to get a great circular horse-trough under a huge
pump with a handle long enough for three men to lay hold of. Schofield
fell to with a will and helped move the trough into place. The squire
set the three men to the task of filling it and then went to Code.
</p><p>"Any chance to save those wharfs, d'ye think?"
</p><p>"No, squire. Better leave them and the fish-houses and work on
Boughton's store and the cottages. They're right in the path of the
wind. It'll be tough on Nailor and Thomas to lose their stand and
houses, but you know what will happen if the fire gets into the
dwellings."
</p><p>"I thought so all along--curse me if I didn't!" yelled the judge, and
then, turning toward a crowd of men who were looking apprehensively
here and there, he shouted:
</p><p>"All hands with the buckets now, lively!"
</p><p>Suddenly the basement doors of Boughton's store were thrown open and a
huge, black-bearded man with a great voice appeared there.
</p><p>"Buckets this way!" he bellowed, in a tone that rose clearly above the
roar and crackle of the fire. As the men reached him he handed out the
implements from great stacks at his feet--rubber buckets, wooden
buckets, tin and iron buckets, new, old, rusty and galvanized. It was
Pete Ellinwood, the fire marshal of the village and custodian of the
apparatus.
</p><p>Because in the hundred or more years of its existence there has never
been water pressure in Grande Mignon, the fighting of a fire there
with primitive means has become an exact and beautiful science.
</p><p>A few bold spirits had disputed the wisdom of Squire Hardy's orders to
let the wharf and fish-house burn, and had attempted to give them a
dousing. In less than five minutes they had retreated, singed and
hairless, due to a sudden explosion of a drum of oil.
</p><p>"Play on Bill Boughton's store!" came the order.
</p><p>Already an iron ladder reached to the eaves of the building. Two men
galloped up its length, dragging behind them another ladder with a
pair of huge hooks at the end.
</p><p>Clinging like monkeys, they worked this up over their heads and up the
shingles until the hooks caught squarely across the ridge-pole of the
house. Then, on hands and feet, they trotted up this and sat astride
the ridge-pole. One of these was Code Schofield.
</p><p>Other men now swarmed up the ladders, until there was one on every
rung from the ground to the top of the house.
</p><p>Below, a line of men extended from the foot of the ladder to the great
circular horse-trough. Another line extended from the opposite side of
the store also to the horse-trough, where three men worked the great
pump.
</p><p>Back twenty yards, along the King's Road, a white-faced row of women
and children stood, ready to rush home and move their furniture into
the fields.
</p><p>Code, looking down, made out his mother and returned her friendly
wave. Their house was across the road not a hundred feet away.
</p><p>With a muffled roar another drum on the pier exploded. A great wave of
molten fire shot out in the breeze, and the shingles on Bill
Boughton's store, parched with the drought of a month, burst into
quick flame.
</p><p>The squire ran back to the water-trough.
</p><p>"Dip!" he yelled. Big Pete Ellinwood, with the piles of buckets beside
him, seized one and twitched it full.
</p><p>"Pass!" screamed the squire as it came up dripping. Ellinwood's great
arm swung forward to meet the arm of the man a yard away. The bucket
changed hands and went forward without losing a drop.
</p><p>Up it went swiftly from one to another, to the eaves, to the two men
at the top.
</p><p>Now the fire sent branches out from the burning wharf along the low
frames where some of the season's miserable catch was drying in the
open air after salting. The fish curled and blackened in the fierce
heat.
</p><p>Only two men were not in the bucket brigade. They were Nailor and
Thomas, who stood watching the destruction of their whole property.
They knew the squire had done well in saving the village rather than
their own buildings. It was the tacit understanding in Freekirk Head
that a few should lose rather than the many.
</p><p>Code Schofield, from his perch on the Boughton roof-tree, looked
down again to where he had last seen his mother. Once more he
distinguished the tall figure with its white face looking anxiously
up at him, and he waved his hand reassuringly. Then his eye was
caught by two other figures that lurked in the first shadows farther
up the King's Road. A moment later he made sure of their identity.
</p><p>They were Nellie Tanner and Nat Burns.
</p><p>For years there had been a dislike between the Burnses and the
Schofields. Old Jasper Schofield, Code's father, and Michael Burns had
become enemies over the same girl a quarter of a century before, and
the breach had never been healed. Old Captain Jasper had won, but he
had never forgotten, and Michael had never forgiven.
</p><p>Quite unconsciously the feud had been passed on to the children of
both (for Michael had married within a few years), and from
school-days Code and Nat had been the leaders of rival gangs.
</p><p>When they became young men they matched their season's catches and
raced their father's schooners. They were the two natural leaders of
the Freekirk Head young bloods, but they were never on the same side
of an argument.
</p><p>Schofield wondered why Nat Burns was not at the fire, as usual
attempting to make himself leader of the battle without doing much of
the work, and now the reason was apparent. He preferred to pursue his
courting under the eyes of the village rather than to obey the
unwritten law of service. And he was with Nellie Tanner!
</p><p>Unlike most youths, there had never been a time in Code's life when he
had passed the favor of his affections around. Since the time they
were both five Nellie Tanner had supplied in full all the feminine
requirements he had ever desired. And she did at this moment. But Nat
Burns had seen a great deal of her in the last three months, he
remembered, taking advantage of Code's desperate search for fish.
</p><p>Once in this train his thoughts bore him on and on. Memories,
speculations, and desires crowded his mind, and he forgot that beneath
him the roof of Boughton's store was burning more and more briskly.
</p><p>Suddenly the man beside him on the ridge-pole shook his arm.
</p><p>"Say, Code!" he cried. "What's that burnin' over there? I didn't know
the fire had gone across the street."
</p><p>Schofield looked up quickly and followed the direction of the other's
arm that pointed through the trees to the opposite side of King's Road
and a little to westward.
</p><p>"Good Lord!" he cried excitedly; "it's my own place, and my mother is
all alone down there. Quick! Send somebody up here! I'm going!"
