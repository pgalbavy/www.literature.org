<p> The efficiency of a steamship consists not so much in her courage
as in the power she carries within herself.  It beats and throbs
like a pulsating heart within her iron ribs, and when it stops,
the steamer, whose life is not so much a contest as the disdainful
ignoring of the sea, sickens and dies upon the waves.  The sailing-ship,
with her unthrobbing body, seemed to lead mysteriously a sort
of unearthly existence, bordering upon the magic of the invisible
forces, sustained by the inspiration of life-giving and death-dealing
winds.</p>

<p>So that big steamer, dying by a sudden stroke, drifted, an unwieldy
corpse, away from the track of other ships.  And she would have
been posted really as "overdue," or maybe as "missing," had she
not been sighted in a snowstorm, vaguely, like a strange rolling
island, by a whaler going north from her Polar cruising ground. 
There was plenty of food on board, and I don’t know whether the
nerves of her passengers were at all affected by anything else
than the sense of interminable boredom or the vague fear of that
unusual situation.  Does a passenger ever feel the life of the
ship in which he is being carried like a sort of honoured bale
of highly sensitive goods?  For a man who has never been a passenger
it is impossible to say.  But I know that there is no harder trial
for a seaman than to feel a dead ship under his feet.</p>

<p>There is no mistaking that sensation, so dismal, so tormenting
and so subtle, so full of unhappiness and unrest.  I could imagine
no worse eternal punishment for evil seamen who die unrepentant
upon the earthly sea than that their souls should be condemned
to man the ghosts of disabled ships, drifting for ever across
a ghostly and tempestuous ocean.</p>

<p>She must have looked ghostly enough, that broken-down steamer,
rolling in that snowstorm—a dark apparition in a world of white
snowflakes to the staring eyes of that whaler’s crew.  Evidently
they didn’t believe in ghosts, for on arrival into port her captain
unromantically reported having sighted a disabled steamer in latitude
somewhere about 50 degrees S. and a longitude still more uncertain. 
Other steamers came out to look for her, and ultimately towed
her away from the cold edge of the world into a harbour with docks
and workshops, where, with many blows of hammers, her pulsating
heart of steel was set going again to go forth presently in the
renewed pride of its strength, fed on fire and water, breathing
black smoke into the air, pulsating, throbbing, shouldering its
arrogant way against the great rollers in blind disdain of winds
and sea.</p>

<p>The track she had made when drifting while her heart stood still
within her iron ribs looked like a tangled thread on the white
paper of the chart.  It was shown to me by a friend, her second
officer.  In that surprising tangle there were words in minute
letters—"gales," "thick fog," "ice"—written by him here and there
as memoranda of the weather. She had interminably turned upon
her tracks, she had crossed and recrossed her haphazard path till
it resembled nothing so much as a puzzling maze of pencilled lines
without a meaning.  But in that maze there lurked all the romance
of the "overdue" and a menacing hint of "missing."</p>

<p>"We had three weeks of it," said my friend, "just think of that!"</p>

<p>"How did you feel about it?" I asked.</p>

<p>He waved his hand as much as to say: It’s all in the day’s work. 
But then, abruptly, as if making up his mind:</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you.  Towards the last I used to shut myself up in
my berth and cry."</p>

<p>"Cry?"</p>

<p>"Shed tears," he explained briefly, and rolled up the chart.</p>

<p>I can answer for it, he was a good man—as good as ever stepped
upon a ship’s deck—but he could not bear the feeling of a dead
ship under his feet: the sickly, disheartening feeling which the
men of some "overdue" ships that come into harbour at last under
a jury-rig must have felt, combated, and overcome in the faithful
discharge of their duty.</p>
