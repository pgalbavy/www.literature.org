<p>I have yet said little of the Highlanders. They were all three
of the followers of James More, which bound the accusation very
tight about their master’s neck. All understood a word or two
of English, but Neil was the only one who judged he had enough
of it for general converse, in which (when once he got embarked)
his company was often tempted to the contrary opinion. They were
tractable, simple creatures; showed much more courtesy than might
have been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth appearance,
and fell spontaneously to be like three servants for Andie and
myself.</p>

<p>Dwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of
a prison, and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the
sea-birds, I thought I perceived in them early the effects of
superstitious fear. When there was nothing doing they would either
lie and sleep, for which their appetite appeared insatiable, or
Neil would entertain the others with stories which seemed always
of a terrifying strain. If neither of these delights were within
reach—if perhaps two were sleeping and the third could find no
means to follow their example—I would see him sit and listen and
look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his face
blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow. The nature
of these fears I had never an occasion to find out, but the sight
of them was catching, and the nature of the place that we were
in favourable to alarms. I can find no word for it in the English,
but Andie had an expression for it in the Scots from which he
never varied.</p>

<p>"Ay," he would say, "<em>it’s an unco place</em>, <em>the Bass</em>."</p>

<p>It is so I always think of it. It was an unco place by night,
unco by day; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the
solans, and the plash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung
continually in our ears. It was chiefly so in moderate weather.
When the waves were anyway great they roared about the rock like
thunder and the drums of armies, dreadful but merry to hear; and
it was in the calm days that a man could daunt himself with listening—not
a Highlandman only, as I several times experimented on myself,
so many still, hollow noises haunted and reverberated in the porches
of the rock.</p>

<p>This brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in,
which quite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect
on my departure. It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside
the fire and (that little air of Alan’s coming back to my memory)
began to whistle. A hand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of
Neil bade me to stop, for it was not "canny musics."</p>

<p>"Not canny?" I asked. "How can that be?"</p>

<p>"Na," said he; "it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta
heid upon his body." [13]</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "there can be no bogles here, Neil; for it’s
not likely they would fash themselves to frighten geese."</p>

<p>"Ay?" says Andie, "is that what ye think of it! But I’ll can
tell ye there’s been waur nor bogles here."</p>

<p>"What’s waur than bogles, Andie?" said I.</p>

<p>"Warlocks," said he. "Or a warlock at the least of it. And that’s
a queer tale, too," he added. "And if ye would like, I’ll tell
it ye."</p>

<p>To be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander
that had the least English of the three set himself to listen
with all his might.</p>

<p>The Tale of Tod Lapraik</p>

<p>My faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring
lad in his young days, wi’ little wisdom and little grace. He
was fond of a lass and fond of a glass, and fond of a ran-dan;
but I could never hear tell that he was muckle use for honest
employment. Frae ae thing to anither, he listed at last for a
sodger and was in the garrison of this fort, which was the first
way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot upon the Bass. Sorrow
upon that service! The governor brewed his ain ale; it seems it
was the warst conceivable. The rock was proveesioned free the
shore with vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles
when they but to fish and shoot solans for their diet. To crown
a’, thir was the Days of the Persecution. The perishin’ cauld
chalmers were all occupeed wi’ sants and martyrs, the saut of
the yearth, of which it wasnae worthy. And though Tam Dale carried
a firelock there, a single sodger, and liked a lass and a glass,
as I was sayin,’ the mind of the man was mair just than set with
his position. He had glints of the glory of the kirk; there were
whiles when his dander rase to see the Lord’s sants misguided,
and shame covered him that he should be haulding a can’le (or
carrying a firelock) in so black a business. There were nights
of it when he was here on sentry, the place a’ wheesht, the frosts
o’ winter maybe riving in the wa’s, and he would hear ane o’ the
prisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and the blessed
sounds rising from the different chalmers—or dungeons, I would
raither say—so that this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt
of Heev’n. Black shame was on his saul; his sins hove up before
him muckle as the Bass, and above a’, that chief sin, that he
should have a hand in hagging and hashing at Christ’s Kirk. But
the truth is that he resisted the spirit. Day cam, there were
the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves depairtit.</p>

<p>In thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet
was his name. Ye’ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden. There was
never the wale of him sinsyne, and it’s a question wi’ mony if
there ever was his like afore. He was wild’s a peat-hag, fearsome
to look at, fearsome to hear, his face like the day of judgment.
The voice of him was like a solan’s and dinnle’d in folks’ lugs,
and the words of him like coals of fire.</p>

<p>Now there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little
to do, for it was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she
was bonny, and her and Tam Dale were very well agreed. It befell
that Peden was in the gairden his lane at the praying when Tam
and the lass cam by; and what should the lassie do but mock with
laughter at the sant’s devotions? He rose and lookit at the twa
o’ them, and Tam’s knees knoitered thegether at the look of him.
But whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in anger. "Poor thing,
poor thing!" says he, and it was the lass he lookit at, "I hear
you skirl and laugh," he says, "but the Lord has a deid shot prepared
for you, and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the
ae time!" Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs
wi’ twa-three sodgers, and it was a blawy day. There cam a gowst
of wind, claught her by the coats, and awa’ wi’ her bag and baggage.
And it was remarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl.</p>

<p>Nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it
passed again and him none the better. Ae day he was flyting wi’
anither sodger-lad. "Deil hae me!" quo’ Tam, for he was a profane
swearer. And there was Peden glowering at him, gash an’ waefu’;
Peden wi’ his lang chafts an’ luntin’ een, the maud happed about
his kist, and the hand of him held out wi’ the black nails upon
the finger-nebs—for he had nae care of the body. "Fy, fy, poor
man!" cries he, "the poor fool man! <em>Deil hae me</em>, quo’
he; an’ I see the deil at his oxter." The conviction of guilt
and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang doun the pike
that was in his hands—"I will nae mair lift arms against the cause
o’ Christ!" says he, and was as gude’s word. There was a sair
fyke in the beginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved,
gied him his discharge, and he went and dwallt and merried in
North Berwick, and had aye a gude name with honest folk free that
day on.</p>

<p>It was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam
in the hands o’ the Da’rymples, and there was twa men soucht the
chairge of it. Baith were weel qualified, for they had baith been
sodgers in the garrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and
the seasons and values of them. Forby that they were baith—or
they baith seemed—earnest professors and men of comely conversation.
The first of them was just Tam Dale, my faither. The second was
ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca’d Tod Lapraik maistly, but whether
for his name or his nature I could never hear tell. Weel, Tam
gaed to see Lapraik upon this business, and took me, that was
a toddlin’ laddie, by the hand. Tod had his dwallin’ in the lang
loan benorth the kirkyaird. It’s a dark uncanny loan, forby that
the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o’ James the Saxt
and the deevil’s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on
the seas; and as for Tod’s house, it was in the mirkest end, and
was little liked by some that kenned the best. The door was on
the sneck that day, and me and my faither gaed straucht in. Tod
was a wabster to his trade; his loom stood in the but. There he
sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a man like creish, wi’ a kind
of a holy smile that gart me scunner. The hand of him aye cawed
the shuttle, but his een was steeked. We cried to him by his name,
we skirled in the deid lug of him, we shook him by the shou’ther.
Nae mainner o’ service! There he sat on his dowp, an’ cawed the
shuttle and smiled like creish.</p>

<p>"God be guid to us," says Tam Dale, "this is no canny?"</p>

<p>He had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel’.</p>

<p>"Is this you, Tam?" says he. "Haith, man! I’m blythe to see ye.
I whiles fa’ into a bit dwam like this," he says; "its frae the
stamach."</p>

<p>Weel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa
was to get the warding o’t, and little by little cam to very ill
words, and twined in anger. I mind weel that as my faither and
me gaed hame again, he cam ower and ower the same expression,
how little he likit Tod Lapraik and his dwams.</p>

<p>"Dwam!" says he. "I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon."</p>

<p>Aweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin’. It
was remembered sinsyne what way he had ta’en the thing. "Tam,"
says he, "ye hae gotten the better o’ me aince mair, and I hope,"
says he, "ye’ll find at least a’ that ye expeckit at the Bass."
Which have since been thought remarkable expressions. At last
the time came for Tam Dale to take young solans. This was a business
he was weel used wi’, he had been a craigsman frae a laddie, and
trustit nane but himsel’. So there was he hingin’ by a line an’
speldering on the craig face, whaur its hieest and steighest.
Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin’ the line and mindin’
for his signals. But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the
craig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying. It
was a braw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the
young geese. Mony’s the time I’ve heard him tell of this experience,
and aye the swat ran upon the man.</p>

<p>It chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a
muckle solan, and the solan pyking at the line. He thocht this
by-ordinar and outside the creature’s habits. He minded that ropes
was unco saft things, and the solan’s neb and the Bass Rock unco
hard, and that twa hunner feet were raither mair than he would
care to fa’.</p>

<p>"Shoo!" says Tam. "Awa’, bird! Shoo, awa’ wi’ ye!" says he.</p>

<p>The solan keekit doon into Tam’s face, and there was something
unco in the creature’s ee. Just the ae keek it gied, and back
to the rope. But now it wroucht and warstl’t like a thing dementit.
There never was the solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht;
and it seemed to understand its employ brawly, birzing the saft
rope between the neb of it and a crunkled jag o’ stane.</p>

<p>There gaed a cauld stend o’ fear into Tam’s heart. "This thing
is nae bird," thinks he. His een turnt backward in his heid and
the day gaed black aboot him. "If I get a dwam here," he toucht,
"it’s by wi’ Tam Dale." And he signalled for the lads to pu’ him
up.</p>

<p>And it seemed the solan understood about signals. For nae sooner
was the signal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings,
squawked out loud, took a turn flying, and dashed straucht at
Tam Dale’s een. Tam had a knife, he gart the cauld steel glitter.
And it seemed the solan understood about knives, for nae suner
did the steel glint in the sun than he gied the ae squawk, but
laighter, like a body disappointit, and flegged aff about the
roundness of the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair. And as sune
as that thing was gane, Tam’s heid drapt upon his shouther, and
they pu’d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig.</p>

<p>A dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to
his mind, or what was left of it. Up he sat.</p>

<p>"Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak’ sure of the boat, man—rin!"
he cries, "or yon solan’ll have it awa’," says he.</p>

<p>The fower lads stared at ither, an’ tried to whilly-wha him to
be quiet. But naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o’ them
had startit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat. The ithers askit
if he was for down again.</p>

<p>"Na," says he, "and niether you nor me," says he, "and as sune
as I can win to stand on my twa feet we’ll be aff frae this craig
o’ Sawtan."</p>

<p>Sure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for
before they won to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever. He
lay a’ the simmer; and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him,
but Tod Lapraik! Folk thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam
near the house the fever had worsened. I kenna for that; but what
I ken the best, that was the end of it.</p>

<p>It was about this time o’ the year; my grandfaither was out at
the white fishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi’ him. We
had a grand take, I mind, and the way that the fish lay broucht
us near in by the Bass, whaur we foregaithered wi’ anither boat
that belanged to a man Sandie Fletcher in Castleton. He’s no lang
deid neither, or ye could speir at himsel’. Weel, Sandie hailed.</p>

<p>"What’s yon on the Bass?" says he.</p>

<p>"On the Bass?" says grandfaither.</p>

<p>"Ay," says Sandie, "on the green side o’t."</p>

<p>"Whatten kind of a thing?" says grandfaither. "There cannae be
naething on the Bass but just the sheep."</p>

<p>"It looks unco like a body," quo’ Sandie, who was nearer in.</p>

<p>"A body!" says we, and we none of us likit that. For there was
nae boat that could have brought a man, and the key o’ the prison
yett hung ower my faither’s at hame in the press bed.</p>

<p>We keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer
hand. Grandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and
the captain of a smack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay.
And when we took the glass to it, sure eneuch there was a man.
He was in a crunkle o’ green brae, a wee below the chaipel, a’
by his lee lane, and lowped and flang and danced like a daft quean
at a waddin’.</p>

<p>"It’s Tod," says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sandie.</p>

<p>"Ay, it’s him," says Sandie.</p>

<p>"Or ane in the likeness o’ him," says grandfaither.</p>

<p>"Sma’ is the differ," quo’ Sandie. "De’il or warlock, I’ll try
the gun at him," quo’ he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that
he aye carried, for Sandie was a notable famous shot in all that
country.</p>

<p>"Haud your hand, Sandie," says grandfaither; "we maun see clearer
first," says he, "or this may be a dear day’s wark to the baith
of us."</p>

<p>"Hout!" says Sandie, "this is the Lord’s judgment surely, and
be damned to it," says he.</p>

<p>"Maybe ay, and maybe no," says my grandfaither, worthy man! "But
have you a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye’ll have
foregaithered wi’ before," says he.</p>

<p>This was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee. "Aweel,
Edie," says he, "and what would be your way of it?"</p>

<p>"Ou, just this," says grandfaither. "Let me that has the fastest
boat gang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep
an eye on Thon. If I cannae find Lapraik, I’ll join ye and the
twa of us’ll have a crack wi’ him. But if Lapraik’s at hame, I’ll
rin up the flag at the harbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi’
the gun."</p>

<p>Aweel, so it was agreed between them twa. I was just a bairn,
an’ clum in Sandie’s boat, whaur I thoucht I would see the best
of the employ. My grandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit
in his gun wi’ the leid draps, bein mair deidly again bogles.
And then the as boat set aff for North Berwick, an’ the tither
lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy thing on the brae-side.</p>

<p>A’ the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and
span like a teetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as
it span. I hae seen lassies, the daft queans, that would lowp
and dance a winter’s nicht, and still be lowping and dancing when
the winter’s day cam in. But there would be fowk there to hauld
them company, and the lads to egg them on; and this thing was
its lee-lane. And there would be a fiddler diddling his elbock
in the chimney-side; and this thing had nae music but the skirling
of the solans. And the lassies were bits o’ young things wi’ the
reid life dinnling and stending in their members; and this was
a muckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa’n in the vale o’ years.
Say what ye like, I maun say what I believe. It was joy was in
the creature’s heart, the joy o’ hell, I daursay: joy whatever.
Mony a time I have askit mysel’ why witches and warlocks should
sell their sauls (whilk are their maist dear possessions) and
be auld, duddy, wrunkl’t wives or auld, feckless, doddered men;
and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik dancing a’ the hours by his lane
in the black glory of his heart. Nae doubt they burn for it muckle
in hell, but they have a grand time here of it, whatever!—and
the Lord forgie us!</p>

<p>Weel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-heid
upon the harbour rocks. That was a’ Sandie waited for. He up wi’
the gun, took a deleeberate aim, an’ pu’d the trigger. There cam’
a bang and then ae waefu’ skirl frae the Bass. And there were
we rubbin’ our een and lookin’ at ither like daft folk. For wi’
the bang and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared. The sun
glintit, the wund blew, and there was the bare yaird whaur the
Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second syne.</p>

<p>The hale way hame I roared and grat wi’ the terror o’ that dispensation.
The grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there was little said
in Sandie’s boat but just the name of God; and when we won in
by the pier, the harbour rocks were fair black wi’ the folk waitin’
us. It seems they had fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing
the shuttle and smiling. Ae lad they sent to hoist the flag, and
the rest abode there in the wabster’s house. You may be sure they
liked it little; but it was a means of grace to severals that
stood there praying in to themsel’s (for nane cared to pray out
loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed the shuttle.
Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi’ the ae dreidfu’ skelloch, Tod sprang
up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab, a bluidy corp.</p>

<p>When the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff
upon the warlock’s body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but
there was grandfaither’s siller tester in the puddock’s heart
of him.</p>

<p>Andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair
that had its consequence. Neil, as I have said, was himself a
great narrator. I have heard since that he knew all the stories
in the Highlands; and thought much of himself, and was thought
much of by others on the strength of it. Now Andie’s tale reminded
him of one he had already heard.</p>

<p>"She would ken that story afore," he said. "She was the story
of Uistean More M’Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore."</p>

<p>"It is no sic a thing," cried Andie. "It is the story of my faither
(now wi’ God) and Tod Lapraik. And the same in your beard," says
he; "and keep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts!"</p>

<p>In dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown
in history, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the
thing appears scarce feasible for Lowland commons. I had already
remarked that Andie was continually on the point of quarrelling
with our three MacGregors, and now, sure enough, it was to come.</p>

<p>"Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans," says Neil.</p>

<p>"Shentlemans!" cries Andie. "Shentlemans, ye hielant stot! If
God would give ye the grace to see yoursel’ the way that ithers
see ye, ye would throw your denner up."</p>

<p>There came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black
knife was in his hand that moment.</p>

<p>There was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the
leg, and had him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I
knew what I was doing. His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie
and I were without weapons, the Gregara three to two. It seemed
we were beyond salvation, when Neil screamed in his own tongue,
ordering the others back, and made his submission to myself in
a manner the most abject, even giving me up his knife which (upon
a repetition of his promises) I returned to him on the morrow.</p>

<p>Two things I saw plain: the first, that I must not build too
high on Andie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there,
as pale as death, till the affair was over; the second, the strength
of my own position with the Highlanders, who must have received
extraordinary charges to be tender of my safety. But if I thought
Andie came not very well out in courage, I had no fault to find
with him upon the account of gratitude. It was not so much that
he troubled me with thanks, as that his whole mind and manner
appeared changed; and as he preserved ever after a great timidity
of our companions, he and I were yet more constantly together.</p>
