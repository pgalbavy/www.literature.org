<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Deerfoot, the young Shawanoe, despite his extraordinary exertions
and his own wonderful woodcraft, had fallen into the hands of
the hostile Wyandots, and with a grim satire upon the skill which
had given the youth his great fame, Waughtauk, chief of his enemies,
had decreed that his life should be staked upon the result of
a race with the fleetest runners of the tribe.</p>

<p>The captive would have welcomed such a contest, could it have
been conducted on anything like equal terms, but he seemed in
a pitiable condition, unable to bear the weight of his body for
more than a second on one foot. Had it been otherwise, Waughtauk
never would have made the conditions what they were.</p>

<p>The promised enjoyment was so eagerly looked for by the warriors
that the chief decided to gratify them and himself, without delay.</p>

<p>It was now near noon, and the sun shining overhead gave no indications
of the clouds and snow-fall that came with the close of day. The
"Long Clearing," of which the chief spoke, was an open space,
beginning fifty rods north of the block-house and extending for
a third of a mile, parallel with the Licking river. It had a width
varying from a hundred feet to five times that extent. It was
a natural clearing or opening, which, it would seem, offered a
much better site for a block-house than the one selected by Colonel
Preston, when he erected the building now placed in such danger.</p>

<p>It presented an open space for the distance named, and, before
the founding of the settlement, was often used by Indians for
their games and athletic contests: no more suitable place could
have been found for the extraordinary contest decreed by Waughtauk,
chief of the Wyandots.</p>

<p>As this exhibition was ordered during the time when the siege
was to be maintained, it was impossible that more than a fractional
part of the warriors could take part in or witness it. Waughtauk
selected six of his men who were to be the actors in the tragedy,
he himself purposing to be the leader and director.</p>

<p>As the wolf, before destroying the lamb, sought a pretext for
his cruelty, so the chief assumed a certain air of justice in
arranging for what might be termed a race for life.</p>

<p>The warrior who had struck Deerfoot was given his bow, the youth
being allowed to retain his knife, tomahawk, and quiver. None
of the Wyandots were permitted to carry their guns, the only weapon
of that kind being in the hands of the chief, who was also magnanimous
enough to give the fugitive a start of some fifty yards.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was too proud to open his lips, when the conditions
were explained to him. He stood grim and silent, watching the
preparations and noting the exultation which often reached boisterousness.</p>

<p>"Great is Deerfoot, the swiftest runner of the Shawanoes!" said
one mockingly; "he is the eagle, and he will leave the Wyandots
far out of sight, as the great bird leaves the smaller ones in
his flight through the heavens!"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is the friend of the Yenghese and the Long Knives,
who have come to take away the hunting-grounds of the red man."</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will come to the help of Deerfoot, for who has
been a better friend to them than he?"</p>

<p>These and similar taunts fell upon ears which appeared to hear
them not. Those who uttered the cruel words came close to the
youth and peered into his face, with hideous grimaces, but he
stood calm and silent. He was a shade paler, and there was a strange
gleam in his black eyes, but he looked beyond his tormentors at
Waughtauk, who deliberately paced off the distance, giving liberal
measure, as it is only justice to record.</p>

<p>When the fifty steps had been taken, Waughtauk stopped, stamped
the heel of his moccasin in the earth, and, turning about, beckoned
to Deerfoot to approach. The young Shawanoe, as he hobbled painfully
forward, presented a spectacle which ought to have excited the
pity of the hardest heart; but the Wyandots laughed and were impatient
for the contest, if such it may be called, to open.</p>

<p>Deerfoot limped the greater part of the distance and then stopped
to rest a moment, seemingly unable to advance another step. Several
taunting exclamations followed this display of weakness, and,
summoning his energies, the youth resumed his labored advance,
finally reached the side of Waughtauk, who concealed, as well
as he could, his impatience.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will stand <em>here</em>," said he, pointing to the
indentation the heel of his moccasin had made in the ground; "when
he hears Waughtauk give forth the war-whoop of the Wyandots, he
will teach my warriors how to run."</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe opened his lips to make answer, but they closed
more tightly than before, and not a word was uttered. His self-restraint
was perfect.</p>

<p>Waughtauk walked back to the edge of the Long Clearing, where
the six warriors eagerly awaited the signal for the sport to begin.
Despite the usual stoicism and indifference of their race, the
braves were as frolicsome as so many school-boys. They elbowed
and crowded each other for their places, and one or two vigorous
wrestling bouts occurred, before the chieftain placed them in
line.</p>

<p>At last the six Wyandots were drawn up in position, one foot
thrown forward, while they swayed restlessly back and forth, inching
along the advanced foot, like so many runners eager for the slightest
advantage. Each carried his knife and tomahawk at his girdle,
but the arms were free. He who claimed the bow of Deerfoot had
thrown it aside, now that he was about to run.</p>

<p>Waughtauk looked at his men and then he placed himself in alignment
at their right. He still held his loaded gun, probably as an emblem
of his authority, and as a notification that he would use it in
the event of any warrior disregarding orders.</p>

<p>The seven now looked out upon the Long Clearing at the fugitive
who was to go through this mockery of a race with the sinewy-limbed
Wyandots, eager and thirsting for his life.</p>

<p>The pose of Deerfoot was much the same as that of his enemies.
His left foot was in advance of the other, while his weight gently
oscillated back and forth, like the swinging of a long pendulum.
Unnoticed by any of the Wyandots, he had edged fully ten feet
beyond the proper starting-point. His face was turned as if looking
at the autumnal woods on his right, but as his handsome profile
was thrown against the sky beyond, his eyes were scrutinizing
every action of his foes, as they arranged themselves and awaited
the signal.</p>

<p>At this juncture it must have occurred to more than one that
the Shawanoe was balancing himself with remarkable ease for one
whose sufferings from a sprained ankle were so acute. If such
a thought came to the Wyandots, they did not lose sight of the
fact that the time for an investigation was past.</p>

<p>For a single minute complete quiet prevailed. The river on the
left flowing calmly northward, the solemn autumn woods on the
right, the stretch of the Long Clearing, with its irregular contour,&mdash;the
single solitary youth poised as if he were a Grecian athlete,&mdash;the
seven swarthy Indians, like so many fierce hounds, impatient for
the moment when they might spring at the lamb and bury their fangs
in its throat:&mdash;these made a picture striking beyond imagination
in its details.</p>

<p>"<em>Whoop! whoop! whoop!</em>"</p>

<p>In quick succession the war-cry of the Wyandots rang out on the
still air, and like an electric shock it thrilled through every
being who heard the startling signal.</p>

<p>The ringing shout had scarcely left the lips of Waughtauk, when
Deerfoot made a tremendous leap of nearly a dozen feet, and the
instant he lightly struck the ground he bounded away with a burst
of speed which astounded the spectators. There was no lameness
now&mdash;there had never been the slightest. The young Shawanoe when
he saw his capture was inevitable, resorted to this strategy with
the quickness of inspiration. The sprained ankle was a fiction&mdash;a
fiction not essayed with any thought that he would be subjected
to such a special test, but with the belief that a chance might
come in which he could make a break for freedom and for life.</p>

<p>A series of fierce shouts went up from the thunderstruck Wyandots,
as they saw the fugitive ricocheting over the grounds, as may
be said, like the ball from the throat of a Columbiad.</p>

<p>The halt and the lame who were the first to step into the pool
of Siloam, after the angel had stirred the waters, were no more
quickly healed than was Deerfoot by the ringing war-cry of the
Wyandot chieftain.</p>

<p>A consuming anger like that of the wolf, when the panther robs
him of his prey, must have fired the hearts of the Wyandots, at
the moment they saw the trick played on them by this despised
youth. He, a boy in stature and years, had pitted his skill, his
strategy, his woodcraft, his brains against theirs, and he had
won.</p>

<p>The readiness of Deerfoot added several rods to the advance originally
given, so that a great advantage was thus obtained, and it was
improved to the utmost.</p>

<p>The wonderful youth ran as never before. His lithe legs doubled
under him with inconceivable quickness, the eye seeing naught
but the twinkling of the beaded moccasins. The still wind cut
by his face as though it was a gale. He was a gladiator stripped
for the struggle, and every nerve and muscle was strained to the
last tension. He seemed a swallow skimming close to the ground,
or a shaft driven from his own bow, so graceful was his arrowy
swiftness.</p>

<p>There were swift runners among the Wyandots, and the seven warriors
included their fleetest, who now put forth every exertion of which
they were capable. The difference in their speed was shown by
their immediate separation, with rapidly increasing spaces between
them; but the young Shawanoe drew away from them, as a child draws
away from the stationary object which frightens it.</p>

<p>Deerfoot saw the half mile sweeping under his feet, as the steel
rails glide under the plunging engine, and the single glance he
threw over his shoulder told the glad fact that he had not misjudged
his own matchless ability as a runner. Muscle and nerve and sinew
never did their work more splendidly than now, when their existence
was staked on the manner in which that work was to be done. Human
ingenuity could never construct a piece of mechanism which could
do such marvelous service, as did those limbs of the flying fugitive
on that crisp autumn day nearly a century ago, in Kentucky.</p>

<p>Although, as we have stated, there were many rapid runners among
the Wyandots, there was not one who could attain and hold the
terrific pace of the Shawanoe, whose victory, it may be said,
was assured from the beginning. Fired by their fury and chagrin,
they made prodigious exertions to run down the youth, or at least
to approach close enough to hurl their tomahawks; but this was
useless, and with an exasperation beyond expression they saw their
victim slipping irrecoverably from their grasp.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang out on the frosty air. Waughtauk, the chieftain,
and the only one who had a rifle, came to a dead halt and fired
point blank at the vanishing youth, hoping at least to disable
him, so he would fall into their hands. Deerfoot heard the firing
of the bullet, as it nipped his cheek, but he did not hasten his
pace, because he was unable to do so, and no need existed. From
the first he had done his best, and there was no room for an increase
in the way of speed.</p>

<p>A third of a mile is soon traversed at such a rate of travel,
and in a brief while Deerfoot approached the end of the Long Clearing.
His swiftness was unabated, but, when he once more glanced around
and saw that the whole seven Indians had given up the pursuit
and were standing at varying distances from each other looking
at him, he instantly slackened his pace.</p>

<p>Coming to a dead halt he faced about and, swinging his arms over
his head, gave utterance to whoops and taunting exclamations.</p>

<p>"Have the Wyandots learned to run? Who is Waughtauk, that a youth
of the Shawanoes should teach him to walk? Let the Wyandots go
back to their lodges and tell their squaws that Deerfoot has taught
them knowledge! Are the Wyandots tired that they must sit down
and rest? Shall Deerfoot come back to them and show them what
to do, when their enemies are around them?"</p>

<p>No more stinging taunts than these can be imagined, and the Wyandots
felt their full force. They were silent, possibly because their
tongue contained no words which could give suitable expression
to their feelings.</p>

<p>Clearly it was idle to maintain the pursuit any longer, and the
seven Wyandots, including Waughtauk the chieftain, stalked back
toward the block-house, for the purpose of pressing the siege
with more vigor than ever.</p>

<p>Up to this point they had in reality accomplished nothing toward
the reduction of the place. They had lost several of their warriors,
and Deerfoot, as they all agreed, would make all haste to Wild
Oaks to procure help for the beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>An individual capable of such speed as he, would reach the Ohio
before nightfall; and, under the stress of necessity, the settlers
would be at Fort Bridgman before the sun could cross the meridian
on the morrow.</p>

<p>Such was the reasoning of Waughtauk, and all of his counsellors
agreed with him. A brief while before they would not have believed
it possible that help could be brought before the following night;
but since the occurrence just described they were prepared to
believe Deerfoot capable of doing almost anything.</p>

<p>The precise conversation between the maddened red men, of course,
can never be known to the historian, and it is not desirable that
it should be; but the parties concerned were so interested in
the words that they were close to the stockade of the block-house
before it was recalled that the long valuable bow taken from Deerfoot
was left lying on the ground where the new owner threw it when
ready to join in the chase.</p>

<p>This was too valuable a trophy to be lost, and the Wyandot immediately
turned about and hastened toward the Long Clearing to recover
it, while the others passed on to mingle with those who were striving
so hard to encompass the destruction of the little party in the
garrison.</p>

<p>The Indian who hurried back, it will be remembered, was the one
that had struck Deerfoot when he was a captive. He had been the
most cruel in his taunts, and his hatred of the youth seemed more
malignant, if possible, than that of the others.</p>

<p>He ground his teeth together, as he dropped into a walk, and
recalled the inimitable cleverness with which the young warrior
outwitted them.</p>

<p>"Why did we not know the dog spoke with two tongues? Why did
we not make sure he could not run? Why did not some of our warriors
lie in the woods at the end of the Long Clearing to catch him,
if he should escape us?"</p>

<p>"He is a dog&mdash;he is a traitor!" muttered the fierce Wyandot,
approaching the spot where he had thrown the bow, "and he shall
yet fall by my hand&#11834;"</p>

<p>He was about to stoop forward to pick up the weapon, when a slight
exclamation caught his ear, and he straightened up like a flash.</p>

<p>Less than twenty feet distant stood Deerfoot the Shawanoe, quietly
looking at him. Both had reached the spot on the same errand,
and thus they met.</p>

<p>The youth had the advantage of detecting the other first, and,
as a consequence, was prepared. In the language of the west, it
would have been said, under similar circumstances, that Deerfoot
"had the drop" on the other Indian.</p>

<p>The latter, as he looked up, saw that the hand of the youth grasped
his tomahawk, which was held so far back of his hip that only
a glimpse of its edge could be seen. The arm extended straight
down so that it needed to be thrown upward and backward, before
the formidable missile could be launched.</p>

<p>Fate seemed to favor Deerfoot that day; for not only had he escaped
from a cruel death, but the being whom he hated above all others,
and with an intensity which only a barbarian can feel, now stood
before him.</p>

<p>There was no misunderstanding the situation on the part of either.
The Wyandot would have resorted to any treachery to slay Deerfoot,
and he was aware that Deerfoot knew it. He had inflicted indignities
upon the young Shawanoe which nothing less than the grace of heaven
will enable the North American Indian to forgive.</p>

<p>The two gazed fixedly at each other without speaking, and for
a second or two neither stirred a muscle. Then, while the Wyandot
centered his burning gaze upon the bronzed face before him, his
right hand began slowly stealing up from his hip to his girdle.
It was seeking the handle of his tomahawk, but, guarded as was
the movement, the Shawanoe saw it.</p>

<p>So absolute was Deerfoot's faith in his own prowess and unequalled
celerity that, knowing as he did the meaning of his enemy's action,
he permitted the hand to touch the weapon, before he affected
to notice it.</p>

<p>The instant the Wyandot griped the tough wooden handle, he snatched
it forth with surprising quickness and threw his hand back over
his head with the purpose of hurling it at the defiant youth.</p>

<p>But the latter was the quicker. His left hand made one lightning-like
sweep, and the tomahawk shot from his grasp with the suddenness
of the thunderbolt. Although the Wyandot threw his almost at the
same instant, yet there was just enough difference in time to
make one a success and the other a failure.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's weapon sped as direct as a rifle-ball, and clove the
skull of the Wyandot as though it were card-paper. The tomahawk
of the latter, which was in the act of leaving his hand, was so
disarranged by the shock that it was thrown up in the air and
fell at his feet, as he toppled over backwards, with a shriek
which reached Waughtauk and his warriors, and whose meaning they
knew too well.</p>

<p>Deerfoot advanced and recovered his tomahawk, that had done this
terrible execution. Then he picked up his valued bow from the
ground and examined it to make sure that it had suffered no injury.</p>

<p>He did not stoop to take the scalp of the dead warrior, who hoped
so ardently a brief while before to capture his. The Shawanoe
had never scalped a vanquished foe; but when he caught sight of
several Wyandots hastening to the spot, he flourished his bow
defiantly in the air, gave utterance to several taunting cries,
and, turning his back upon them, plunged into the wilderness with
such speed, as to render all thought of pursuit out of the question.</p>

<p>And as he sped like a hound on a trail, the face of Deerfoot
the Shawanoe was turned toward the settlement of Wild Oaks on
the far-away Ohio.</p>
