<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I was taken, in company with Jack Mount, on Monday morning, the
29th of October, 1774, without warrant or process, without a shadow
of legal right, without the faintest justification or excuse,
save that I had been seen conversing with Mount on the Mall, and
had resisted the thief-taker Bishop and his filthy gang of bailiffs.</p>

<p>From the 29th of October until the 15th day of December, chained
ankle to ankle, wrist to wrist, and wearing a steel collar from
which chains hung and were riveted to the rings on my legs, I
lay in that vile iron cage known as the "Pirates' Chapel," in
company with Mount and eight sullen, cursing ruffians, taken in
piracy off the Virginia capes by his Majesty's ship <em>Hebe</em>,
consort of the frigate <em>Asia</em>.</p>

<p>During those six weeks not a moment passed in which I despaired,
not an hour dragged out its chain of minutes but I believed it
must be the hour for my delivery from this hideous injustice.</p>

<p>From the minute I had entered the "Chapel," the dull amazement
which had fettered mind and body in a strange paralysis gave way
to a deadly patience. My benumbed faculties grew clear; every
sense became abnormally alert. Calmly I faced the terrible dilemma;
I probed its consequences coolly; I understood that while Walter
Butler held the Governor's ear, and while the Governor held the
civil power at his own pleasure, and used it as whim or caprice
moved him, I could neither hope for a hearing before a magistrate
nor dare expect a trial by my countrymen. The soiled hand of England
had polluted the ermine of the judges; the bayonets of England
cleared the court-rooms; the mocking Governor brooded in Province
House, watching the structure of civil rights crumble and collapse,
while his judges, his sheriffs, his bailiffs, and his soldiers
prowled through the débris of a structure which had been reared
by my own people's martyrdom.</p>

<p>As for communication with the outside world, with friends, even
with hostile relatives, or with the Governor himself, there was
no possible chance. Our steel cage was set in the centre of a
stone chamber, the barred windows of which opened on a bare stony
parade, bounded on the east by Cornhill, on the west by Treamount
Street, and on the south by School Street and the dead wall enclosing
King's Chapel. There was not a soul to be seen in the prison or
outside save the marine sentinels, the jailers, the warden of
the prison, and the eight ruffians who were caged with us, among
whom there was but a single Englishman.</p>

<p>Our cage was bedded with straw like a kennel; our food was brought
us three times a day, in earthen bowls. A wooden spoon went with
each bowl, otherwise the feed differed nothing from the feed of
dogs.</p>

<p>Mount, in the beginning, had conducted like a madman, passing
swiftly up and down his cage, pacing to and fro along the ranks
of steel bars, blank fury glaring from his eyes, jaw hanging like
the jowl of a committed panther.</p>

<p>All that first night he stalked the cage, brushing the bars with
brow and thigh, and deep in his blue eyes there burned a terrible
light, like the livid witch-fires which flare in haunted swamps.</p>

<p>At first the manacled ruffians who lay about us in the straw
watched him doggedly, but as the night wore on and his pacing
never ceased, they growled sullen protest. Then he slowly turned
on them, baring his white teeth.</p>

<p>From that moment they gave him room and he ruled the cage as
a silent, powerful beast rules, scarcely conscious of the cringing
creatures who huddle around his legs, and whose presence cannot
invade the solitude of his own fierce misery.</p>

<p>The light in the stone chamber was cool and gray&mdash;clear enough,
yet never tinged with sunlight. Night brought thick, troubled
shadows creeping around the single candle which dripped from an
iron socket riveted to the wall. Then the shades of the jailers
fell across the floor as the large lanthorn was set outside in
the corridor, and all night long the shuffling tread of the sentry
marked the dead march of time.</p>

<p>For three days, now, I had not touched the broth which was set
on the straw beside me; I do not know that I should have made
the effort to eat at all, except for an accident. It happened
in this manner: one day, towards the middle of December, I had
been lying on my belly, trying to think out something of that
future which I had not yet despaired of. Musing there, nose buried
in my arms, I lay almost on the verge of slumber, yet with one
eye on the corridor beyond, when I saw distinctly a woman's face
peer through the thick grating which separated the corridor from
our stone chamber.</p>

<p>After a while the face disappeared; I lay still a moment, then
touched Mount's arm.</p>

<p>He turned his haggard face to me.</p>

<p>"Bishop's daughter is in the corridor," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mount, vacantly.</p>

<p>"Out there behind the grating. She may do something for&mdash;for
you. If she should, I think we had better try to eat."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we must eat." And he turned with a snarl on
one of the caged wretches behind us who for days had been battening
on the food that neither Jack nor I touched.</p>

<p>The man was in the act of dragging Mount's bowl and spoon towards
his own nest in the straw, but he dropped the food and shrank
back as Mount seized it with an oath.</p>

<p>I also secured my own bowl of bread and broth, and, together,
we ate as animals eat, eying the others malevolently and askance.</p>

<p>That night Mount lay awake, watching the grating. At dawn I awoke
to watch, and Mount rolled himself up into a ball of buckskin
and slept the first peaceful sleep which had come to him since
his taking.</p>

<p>The day passed in horrible monotony; our straw had become so
foul that my head swam with the stench. But towards evening came
a jailer and two soldiers, who raked the filthy straw from our
cage, mopped the reeking floor, and when it had partly dried,
shook us down a bedding of sweet rye-straw, into which we burrowed
like dogs.</p>

<p>That night we heard the noise of hammers overhead, and at first
terror seized on all in the cage, for we believed that workmen
had come to build gibbets. In the morning, when our jailer arrived
to fetch us water, I spoke to him, scarcely expecting a reply,
for he had never before paid the faintest attention to questions
from any of us.</p>

<p>I was surprised, therefore, when he hesitated, glanced up at
me, and finally informed me that the hammering we heard was made
by masons and carpenters who were reconstructing the upper tiers
of the prison for the new warden and his family.</p>

<p>Presuming on his pleasant manner, I continued my questioning,
but he soon silenced me with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about your case," he said. "Matters move slowly
here; the prison is crowded with rebels who have defied the Governor's
edict against public assemblies. Their cases come before yours,
young man."</p>

<p>"And the others here?" I asked.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to my question.</p>

<p>I asked for news of the outside world, but he would give me none.</p>

<p>Mount, whose morbid curiosity had been aroused by the sight of
some workmen digging holes in the yard outside the prison, stood
up to watch them. The other prisoners also huddled to the south
side of the cage, their chains making a great clanking as they
moved. At the moment when their backs were turned the jailer looked
at them significantly, then at me, and, to my horror, passed his
withered fingers over his corded throat.</p>

<p>I stared at him, fascinated, but he shrugged his stooping shoulders,
shuffled off to the wicket, let himself out, and slammed the grating.</p>

<p>That night I sat close to Jack Mount, my hand on his broad shoulder,
crushing back the lump in my throat. I believed he was to die
soon; when, I did not know; but the grim gesture of the jailer
had conveyed a hint that could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>At dawn I stood up to gaze fearfully out into the prison yard.
Snow had fallen; workmen were digging at the holes with pick and
crow.</p>

<p>When the jailer brought breakfast to us, he laid two bundles
of sail-cloth on the floor under the windows beyond our cage.
Later he returned and carefully nailed each strip of cloth over
the windows, hiding our view of the prison yard.</p>

<p>Mount asked him why he did that; the other prisoners became restless
and suspicious, calling out to the jailer in Spanish and Portuguese;
even the Englishman broke his long silence with a sneering inquiry
as to the reason of cutting off our view. The jailer continued
his task without answering or even glancing at the imprisoned
men, who now crowded against the bars, clamouring, gesticulating,
and clanking their manacles. They were stunted, swarthy fellows,
bull-necked, shaggy of hair and beard, clothed in filthy shreds
of finery to which the straw stuck.</p>

<p>Some were frightfully scarred; some were still swathed in bandages,
greasy with filth, tied over unhealed sores or wounds. One of
them, who wore large gold hoops in his ears, had lost his right
hand, but he beat against the steel bars with the mangled stump,
and cried ever: "Listen, señor, you good fellow! Hé! Señor! I
say, señor! They will to do me no harm, eh? I am innocent, what?
And thus I say to your señor Governor; eh, you good fellow? What?
It is the holy truth, by Jesu!"</p>

<p>The Englishman laughed scornfully: "They're planting trees in
the yard outside. We'll all climb them soon, won't we, jailer?"</p>

<p>"By God," muttered Mount, "they are planting gallows!"</p>

<p>When he had shrouded the windows, the jailer scrambled briskly
to the floor and hastened out through the wicket, unheeding the
shouts and shrill cries of the ruffians, who had rushed to the
other side of the cage. When the wicket slammed the panic ceased;
a dead silence followed, then one of the Spaniards uttered a piercing
scream and fell down into the straw, tearing and biting at his
chains.</p>

<p>"Die like a man! Die like a man!" said the Englishman, contemptuously;
but terror had seized another of the ruffians, and he began hobbling
around the cage, shrieking out prayer on prayer.</p>

<p>Mount, pale and composed, lay at full length in our corner, watching
the wicket, a straw between his white teeth. I sat beside him,
my heart hammering under my torn shirt, resolutely crushing back
the terror which was feeling my throat with icy fingers.</p>

<p>"Do you believe they are setting the gibbets?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>After a moment he added: "Why did you not leave me, lad? This
is foul company for a gentleman to die in."</p>

<p>Terror choked me. I sank face downward in the straw, blind with
fright, and lay there shaking till the candle was lighted and
the lanthorn in the corridor sent its yellow rays through the
wicket.</p>

<p>Black, whirling thoughts swarmed through my brain; again and
again I fought the battle for courage, only to lose it and again
find myself faint with horror, tearing silently at my chains.</p>

<p>"Now that I know I am to die," said Mount, calmly, "I shall die
easily enough. It was hope that hurt. I shall die easily."</p>

<p>"I shall die hard," I stammered; "no one will know it, but I
shall die hard out there in the snow."</p>

<p>"I will stand next to you if I can," said Mount. "If you feel
weak, reach out and touch me. I shall jest with the hangman. It
is easy; you will see how easy it can be." I raised my head to
look at him.</p>

<p>"You care nothing," I said, fiercely; "you will see Cade Renard,
and you care nothing! But I am leaving <em>her</em>!"</p>

<p>"God will right all that," said Mount, gravely.</p>

<p>"As for death," I blurted out, pronouncing the word with an effort,
"I can die as coolly as you. But&mdash;but a gentleman's son&mdash;on the
gibbet&mdash;hanging in chains between thieves&mdash;the disgrace&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shame strangled the voice in my throat, my head reeled.</p>

<p>"Our Lord so died," said Mount, slowly.</p>

<p>I sat still as a stone. Mount gathered his knees in his hands
and chewed his straw peacefully, blue eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>Presently I plucked his sleeve. "Yes, lad," he said, without
turning.</p>

<p>"You are not afraid that I will not know how to meet&mdash;it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;am not afraid," I whispered. "I mean to bear myself without
fear. I shall speak to you when&mdash;we are ready. You shall see I
am not afraid. Will they pray, Jack?"</p>

<p>"When? Now?"</p>

<p>"No, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"They will say a prayer on the gallows, lad."</p>

<p>"Will they take off our chains?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how long shall we hang?"</p>

<p>"A long time, lad."</p>

<p>"Could anybody know our features?"</p>

<p>"The weather will change them. Have you never seen a cross-roads
gibbet?"</p>

<p>"No. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lad."</p>

<p>After a silence I said, "I hope no one will know me."</p>

<p>He did not reply; the candle-flame in the dripping socket swayed
in icy draughts from the wicket; the Spaniards muttered and moaned
and cried like sick children; the Englishman stood in silence,
staring at the windows through which he could not see.</p>

<p>Presently he came over to our corner. We had never before spoken
to him, nor he to us, but now Mount looked up with a ghost of
a smile and nodded.</p>

<p>"It's all behind that window," said the Englishman, jerking his
thumb over his shoulder; "we'll know all about it this time to-morrow.
Is the young one with you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Not he," said Mount.</p>

<p>The Englishman sat down on his haunches.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose it is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What? Death?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mount.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said the Englishman, with an oath; "and," he added,
"I have dealt it freely enough, too. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mount.</p>

<p>"And he?" glancing at me.</p>

<p>"Once," I replied, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I've watched men die many times," continued the Englishman,
rubbing his thumb reflectively over his irons, "and I'm not a
whit the wiser. I've seen them hang, drown, burn, strangle&mdash;ay,
seen them die o' fright, too. Puff! Out they go at last, and&mdash;leave
me gaping at their shells. I've slid my hanger into men and the
blood came, but I was none the wiser. What makes the dead look
so small? Have you ever killed your enemy? Is there satisfaction
in it? No, by God, for the second you stop his breath he's gone&mdash;escaped!
And all you've got is a thing at your feet with clothes too large
for it."</p>

<p>He looked at me and played with his wrist-chains. "You're six
feet," he said, musingly; "you'll shrink to five foot six. They
all do. I'll wager you are afraid, young man!"</p>

<p>"You lie!" I said.</p>

<p>"Spoken well!" he nodded. "You'll die smiling, yet. As for the
Spaniards yonder, they'll sail off squalling. It's their nature;
I know."</p>

<p>He rose and glanced curiously at Mount.</p>

<p>"You have not followed the sea?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mount shook his head absently.</p>

<p>"Highway?"</p>

<p>"At intervals."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know anything about this place called Death?" asked
the Englishman, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I expect to find a friend there," said Mount, looking up serenely.</p>

<p>At that moment a faint metallic sound broke on our ears. It seemed
to come from the depths of the prison. We listened; the Spaniards
also ceased their moaning and sat up, alert and quiet. The sound
came again&mdash;silence&mdash;then the measured cadence of footfalls.</p>

<p>Mount had risen; I also stood up. The Spaniards burrowed into
the straw, squealing like rats. Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the
heavy footfalls along the corridor; the ruddy gleam of lanthorns
played over the wicket.</p>

<p>"Halt! Ground arms!"</p>

<p>Lights blinded our dazzled eyes; bayonets glittered like slender
flames.</p>

<p>An officer stepped to the lanthorn; a soldier raised it; then
the officer unrolled a parchment and began to read very rapidly.
I could not distinguish a word of it for the cries of the Spaniards,
but I saw the jailer unlocking our cage, and presently two soldiers
stepped in and drove out a Spaniard at the point of their bayonets.</p>

<p>Shrieking, sobbing, supplicating, the Spaniards were thrust out
into the corridor; the Englishman went last, with a contemptuous
nod at Mount and me, and a cool gesture to the soldiers to stand
aside.</p>

<p>Mount followed; but, as he stepped from the cage, a soldier pushed
him back, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Not yet?" asked Mount, quietly.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said the soldier, locking the cage and flinging the
iron key to the jailer.</p>

<p>Into the prison passed the tumult; the solid walls dulled it
at last; then came the far echo of a gate closing, and all was
silent.</p>

<p>I turned to the draped windows. Dawn whitened the sail-cloth
that hung over them. A moment later I heard drums in the distance
beating the "Rogues' March."</p>
