<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I had learned from our host of the "Virginia Arms" that the so-called
"Governor's Hall," which stood within the limits of the fortifications,
had been built by the French in 1755. Poor Braddock's brief début
before Fort Duquesne in that same year interrupted the building
of "Governor's Hall," which was called by the French "La Fortresse
de la Reine," and which, with the exception of our stone fort
at Johnstown, was the only formidable and solidly fortified edifice
of stone west of the Hudson.</p>

<p>When in '58 our troops seized Fort Duquesne and razed it, they
not only spared La Fortresse de la Reine, but completed it&mdash;in
exceeding poor taste&mdash;set the arms of Virginia over the portal,
ran up their red, powder-stained flag, and saluted "Governor's
Hall" with hurrahs of satisfaction, drums and fifes playing "The
White Cockade."</p>

<p>Now the hall served sometimes as a court-house, sometimes as
a temporary jail, often as a ballroom, occasionally as the Governor's
residence when he came to Fort Pitt from Williamsburg.</p>

<p>In it he gave audiences to all plaintiffs, white or Indian; in
it he received deputies from other colonies or from England.</p>

<p>The Governor of Virginia lived on the second floor while sojourning
at Pittsburg; under his white and gold apartments stretched a
long, blank, stone hall, around the walls of which ran a wooden
balcony half way between the stone flagging and the ceiling of
massive buckeye beams.</p>

<p>It was in this naked and gloomy hall, damp and rank with the
penetrating odour of mortar and dropping, mouldy plaster, that
my Lord Dunmore consented to receive the old Cayuga chief, Logan,
of the clan of the Wolf, and by right of birth&mdash;which counts not
with chiefs unless they be sachems, too&mdash;the chief also of the
Oquacho of the Oneida nation.</p>

<p>Towards dusk a company of red-coated British infantry, with drummers
leading, left the barracks opposite our inn, the "Virginia Arms,"
and marched away towards "Governor's Hall," drummers beating "The
Huron." A crowd of men and boys trailed along on either flank
of the column, drawn by curiosity to catch a glimpse of Logan,
"The White Man's Friend," who was to ask justice this night of
the most noble Governor of Virginia, the great Earl of Dunmore.</p>

<p>When the distant batter of the drums, echo and beat, had died
away down the dark vista of the King's Road, I left my window
in the "Virginia Arms" and descended the stairway into the street
below, where Jack Mount and the Weasel ruffled it bravely and
swaggered to and fro, awaiting my coming.</p>

<p>Mulled wine and sundry cups of cider, mixed rashly with long
libations of James Rolfe's humming ale, had set their heads and
tongues a-buzzing. They were glorious in their dingy buckskins,
coon-skin caps cocked over their left ears, thumbs hooked jauntily
under their arm-pits. They now occupied the middle of the street
and patrolled it gayly, singing and shouting and interrupting
traffic, returning a jest for a gibe, a laugh for a smile, or
a terrible threat for any wayfarer who dared complain of being
hustled or trodden on.</p>

<p>Men instinctively accorded them the room they seemed to desire;
women understood them better, and took right of way, smiling the
reproof which always brought the swaggerers up, cap-tails sweeping
the street in extravagant salute. For there appeared, in those
two graceless bibbers of wines, that gravity and politeness of
intoxication which so grotesquely parodies the dignity of gallantry,
and with which it is almost hopeless for sober people to contend.</p>

<p>However, I spoke to them so cuttingly that they relapsed into
injured silence and ambled along on either side of me without
serious offence to passing citizens.</p>

<p>We soon found ourselves in a crowd, the current of which swept
down the King's Road towards the fortress; and we followed in
the wake, while past us rode companies of officers, gentlemen,
and sometimes squads of the Governor's horse&mdash;those same gay,
flame-coloured Virginians whom I had so admired at Johnstown a
month ago.</p>

<p>Coaches passed us, too, rolling towards the fortress, and through
the glass windows we caught glimpses of ladies in cloaks of swan's-down,
with their plumes and jewels shining in the rays of the coach-lamps.
Gilded sedan-chairs began to appear, gayer and more painted and
polished than our chairs in Johnstown, and the bearers often in
handsome liveries, with a major-domo leading the way and footmen
to heel, and my lady peeping out at us shabby foot-farers plodding
along in the street beside her.</p>

<p>Cresap's men were plentiful among the crowd, some of them sullen
and muttering, others loud in their demands for Cresap's release,
threatening trouble for those who had jailed their leader, and
careless who heard them. There were a few forest-runners dressed
as we were, numbers of riflemen in green capes and gray wool shirts,
and rangers in brown and yellow deer-skins, with thrums dyed scarlet
or purple.</p>

<p>A short, thick-set fellow, wearing a baldrick fringed with scalps,
was pointed out by people as one of Boone's and Harrod's dare-devils;
and truly he looked his part, though the scalp-belt pleased me
not.</p>

<p>I heard him boasting that the trophies were Wyandotte scalps,
which news, if true, meant one more ally for the Cayuga and one
more enemy for the colonies when the breach with England came.
It sickened me to hear the great fool boast.</p>

<p>The bulk of the throng, however, was made up of sober, peaceful
citizens, men of the quiet classes, in homespun and snuffy hats,
guiltless of the silver buckle on knee or shoe, silent, reserved,
thoughtful men of moderate gesture and earnest eyes, whose rare
voices disturbed no one and whose inoffensive conduct rebuked
the rufflers as no words could do.</p>

<p>Jack Mount, who at first appeared inclined to play the rôle of
a marching orator and distribute morsels of his wit and learning
to all who would pay him the fee of their attention, subsided
of his own accord among the quiet company wherein we now found
ourselves and contented himself and the Weasel with a series of
prodigious yawns, at which they both never seemed to tire of laughing.</p>

<p>They also sang in a subdued chorus:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Quak'ress, Quak'ress, whither away?<br/>
Pray thee stay thee, Quak'ress gray.<br/>
I thy Quaker fain would be,<br/>
Yet dare not swear I care for thee!"

</p>
</div>
<p>However, the few Quakers in the throng took no offence, and I
presently nudged my mannerless comrades into a snickering silence.</p>

<p>The people ahead of us had now stopped, and, looking over their
heads, I saw the dark shape of the "Governor's Hall," partly illuminated
by two great lanthorns set in iron sockets flanking the portal.
Shining in the feeble light moved the bayonets of the guards above
the darkly massed crowd, while coach after coach rolled up and
chair after chair deposited its burden of bejewelled beauty at
the gateway. And all these people, all these dainty dames and
gallants, had come to see the famous Logan&mdash;to hear the great
Cayuga orator, "The Friend of the White Man," ask why his little
children had been slain by the white men, whose faithful friend
he had been so long. Truly, there might be here something newer
than the stale play at the Theatre Royal. It was not every day
that my lady might hear and see an old man asking why his children
had been murdered.</p>

<p>The crowd in front of us was compact, yet when Mount set his
broad chest against it, the people hastily made a lane for him.
The Weasel and I followed our big companion, elbowing our way
to the portal, where Mr. Patrick Henry awaited us and passed us
through the sentries and guards and pompous big-bellied tip-staves
who turned up their vinous noses at the three shabby men from
the forest.</p>

<p>Candle-light softened the bare walls and benches; candle-light
set silks and jewels in a blaze where the ladies, banked up like
beds of rustling roses, choked the wooden balcony above our heads,
murmuring, whispering, fluttering fans and scarfs till the perfumed
breeze from their stirrings fanned my cheeks. And more of them
were arriving every moment; the wooden stairway leading to the
gallery was ablaze with starred sashes and petticoats, and twinkling
satin shoon, with now and then the sparkle of a hilt as some scented
gallant ascended with his fluttering and gorgeous convoy.</p>

<p>The scarlet coats of colonial and British officers spotted the
galleries; here and there a silver gorget caught the light, blinding
the eyes with brilliancy, only to turn and sink to a cinder as
the wearer moved.</p>

<p>I looked for Silver Heels, but, from the floor below, all faces
were vague and delicate as massed blossoms in a garden, and eyes
sparkled as faintly as dew on velvet petals all unfolded.</p>

<p>At the end of the hall two carpeted steps led to a stone platform
hung with a flag and the arms of Virginia. This was the Governor's
audience-seat; the gilded chair in the centre was for him; the
tables that flanked it for his secretaries.</p>

<p>For envoys, deputies, and for all plaintiffs, red benches faced
the platform; behind these stretched rank on rank of plain, unpainted
seats for the public, or as much of it as the soldiers and tip-staves
thought proper to admit.</p>

<p>This same public was now clamouring at the gate for right of
entrance without favour or discrimination, and I could hear them
protesting and shuffling at the portal behind us, while the soldiers
disputed and the tip-staves tapped furiously on the stones with
their long, tasselled wands.</p>

<p>"Why should not the public enter freely a public place?" I asked
of Patrick Henry.</p>

<p>"They will, one day," he said, with his grave smile.</p>

<p>"Drums beating," added Mount, loudly, but withered at once under
the sharp stare of displeasure with which Mr. Henry favoured him.</p>

<p>We now took seats on the last of the red benches, which stood
near the centre of the hall, and in one corner of which I perceived
Logan sitting bolt upright, eyes fixed on space, brooding, unconscious
of the thronged beauty in the galleries above him or of the restless
public now pouring into the hall behind his back.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry took his seat beside the stricken chief; next followed
Jack Mount, lumbering to his place; and I heard a stir pass around
the gallery with whispers of wonder and admiration for the giant,
followed by a titter as the little Weasel trotted to his seat
next to Mount. I sat down beside the Weasel, closing the row on
our bench, and turned around to watch the people filling up the
hall behind me. They were serious, sober-eyed people, and, unlike
the gay world in the galleries, had apparently not come to seek
amusement in the clothes of three shabby rangers or in the dumb
grief of a savage.</p>

<p>"They are mostly patriots," whispered the Weasel, "peppered with
Tories and sprinkled with Dunmore's spies. But they don't blab
what they know&mdash;trust them for that, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"I can see Paul Cloud and Timothy Boyd sitting together, and
our host of the 'Virginia Arms,' Rolfe," I said, leaning to search
the audience. Then I caught a glimpse of a face I knew better,
the scarred, patched-up visage of the man whom I had made to taste
his own hatchet. Startled, and realizing for the first time the
proximity of Walter Butler, I hunted the hall for him with hopeful
eyes, for I meant to seek him and kill him without ceremony when
the first chance came. I could not find him, however, but in a
corner near the door, whispering together and peeping about, I
discovered his other two creatures, Wraxall, the Johnstown barber,
and Toby Tice, the treacherous tenant of Sir William. Where the
cubs were the old wolf was not far away, that was certain. But
search as I might I could find nothing but the wolf's stale trail.</p>

<p>One circumstance impressed me: behind Wraxall and Tice sat Saul
Shemuel, hands folded on his stomach, apparently dozing while
waiting for the spectacle to begin. But he was not asleep, for
now and again, between his lids, I caught a sparkle of open eyes,
and I knew that his large, soft ears were listening hard.</p>

<p>While I was still watching Shemuel, the Weasel nudged me, and
I turned to see the platform before me alive with gentlemen, moving
about and chatting, seating themselves in groups, while behind
them half a dozen British officers in full uniform lounged or
stared curiously up at the packed balconies.</p>

<p>Some of the gentlemen on the platform exchanged salutes with
ladies in the balconies, some smiled or waved their hands to friends.
But that soon ceased, and the commotion on the platform was stilled
as a gorgeous tip-staff advanced, banging his great stave on the
stones and announcing the coming of his Lordship the Earl of Dunmore,
Royal Governor of his Majesty's colony of Virginia. God save the
King!</p>

<p>Swish! swish! went the silken petticoats as the gallery rose;
the people on the floor rose too, with clatter and shuffle and
scrape of benches shoved over the stones.</p>

<p>Ah! There he was!&mdash;painted cheeks, pale eyes, smirk, laces, bird-claws
and all&mdash;with a splendid order blazing on his flame-coloured sash
and his fleshless legs mincing towards the gilded chair under
the canopy which bore the arms of Virginia and the British flag.</p>

<p>Before he was pleased to seat himself, he peered up into the
balcony and kissed his finger-tips; and I, following his eyes
by instinct, saw Silver Heels sitting in the candle-flare, scarlet
and silent, with her sad eyes fixed, not on my Lord Dunmore, but
on me.</p>

<p>Before I met her eyes I had been sullenly frightened, dreading
to speak aloud in such a company, scarcely hoping to find my tongue
when the time came to voice my demands so that the whole town
could hear. Now, with her deep, steady eyes meeting mine, fear
fell from me like a cloak, and the blood began to race through
every limb and my heart beat "To arms!" so fearlessly and so gayly
that I smiled up at her; and she smiled at me in turn.</p>

<p>Again the Weasel began twitching at my sleeve, and I bent beside
him, listening and watching the gentlemen on the platform.</p>

<p>"That's John Gibson, Dunmore's secretary&mdash;the man in black on
the Governor's left! That loud, bustling fellow on his right is
Doctor Connolly, Dunmore's deputy for Indian affairs. He arrested
Cresap to clear his own skirts of blame for the war. Behind him
sits Connolly's agent, Captain Murdy. Murdy's agent was Greathouse.
You see the links in the chain?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied, calmly; "and I mean to shatter them if
my voice is not scared out of my body."</p>

<p>"Scourge me that ramshackle Dunmore!" whispered Mount, thickly,
leaning across the Weasel. "Give him hell-fire and a&mdash;hic!&mdash;black
eye&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Henry jerked the giant's arm and he relapsed into a wise
silence, nodding his thanks as though Mr. Henry had imparted to
him an acceptable secret instead of a reproof.</p>

<p>We were near enough to the platform to hear the Governor chattering
with Gibson and Doctor Connolly, and sniffing his snuff as he
peeped about with his lack-lustre eyes.</p>

<p>"Que dieu me damne!" he said, spitefully. "But you have a mauvais
quart d'heure ahead, Connolly!&mdash;curse me if you have not! Faith,
I wash my hands of you, and you had best make your sulky savage
yonder some good excuse for the war."</p>

<p>Connolly's deep voice replied evasively, but Dunmore clipped
him short:</p>

<p>"Oh no! Oh no! The people won't have that, Connolly!&mdash;skewer
me if they will! Body o' Judas, Connolly, you can't make them
believe Cresap started this war!"</p>

<p>Connolly whispered something.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? I say I wash my hands o' ye! Didn't you hear me say
I washed my hands? And mind you clear me when you answer your
filthy savage. I'll none of it, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>Connolly flushed darkly and leaned back. Gibson appeared nervous
and dispirited, but Captain Murdy smiled cheerfully on everybody
and took snuff with a zest.</p>

<p>"And, Connolly," observed Dunmore, settling himself in his gilded
chair, "you had best announce the restoration to rank and command
of Cresap. Ged!&mdash;that ought to put the clodhoppers yonder in good
humour, to keep them from snivelling while your dirty savage speaks."</p>

<p>Presently Connolly arose, and, making a motion for silence, briefly
announced the restoration of Cresap to command. There was no sound,
no demonstration. Those in the balconies cared nothing for Cresap,
those on the floor cared too much to compromise him with applause.</p>

<p>I heard Dunmore complaining to Gibson that the first part of
Connolly's programme had fallen flat and that he, Dunmore, wanted
to know what Gibson thought of refusing Logan the right of speech.</p>

<p>Gibson nervously shook his head and signalled to the interpreter,
a grizzled sergeant of the Virginia militia, to take his station;
and when the interpreter advanced, announcing in English and in
the Cayuga language that the Governor of Virginia welcomed his
brother, Logan, chief of the Cayugas, warrior of the clan of the
Wolf, and "The White Man's Friend," I saw Patrick Henry touch
Logan on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Slowly the Indian looked up, then rose like a spectre from his
sombre blanket and fixed his sad eyes on Dunmore.</p>

<p>There was a faint movement, a rustle from the throng on floor
and gallery, then dead silence, as from the old warrior's throat
burst the first hollow, heart-sick word:</p>

<p>"<em>Brother!</em>"</p>

<p>Oh, the grim sadness of that word!&mdash;the mockery of its bitterness!&mdash;the
desolate irony of despair ringing through it! <em>Brother!</em>
That single word cursed the silence with an accusation so merciless
that I saw Connolly's heavy visage grow purple, and Gibson turn
his eyes away. Only my Lord Dunmore sat immovable, with the shadow
of a sneer freezing on his painted face.</p>

<p>Logan slowly raised his arm:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Through that thick night which darkens the history of our subjugation,
through all the degradation and reproach which has been heaped
upon us, there runs one thread of light revealing our former greatness,
pleading the causes of our decay, illuminating the pit of our
downfall, promising that our dead shall live again! Not in the
endless darkness whither priests and men consign us is that thread
of light to be lost; but from the shadowy past it shall break
out in brilliancy, redeeming a people's downfall, and wringing
from you, our subjugators, the greeting&mdash;<em>Brothers!</em></p>

<p>"<em>Fathers</em>: For Logan, that light comes too late. Death
darkens my lodge; my door is closed to sun and moon and stars.
Death darkens my lodge. All within lie dead. Logan is alone. He,
too, is blind and sightless; like the quiet dead his ears are
stopped, he hears not; nor can he see darkness or light.</p>

<p>"For Logan, light or darkness comes too late."</p>

<p>The old man paused; the silence was dreadful.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned and looked straight at Dunmore.</p>

<p>"I appeal to any white man if he ever entered Logan's lodge hungry
and he gave him not meat; if he ever came cold and naked and he
clothed him not!"</p>

<p>The visage of the Earl of Dunmore seemed to be growing smaller
and more corpse-like. Not a feature on his ghastly mask moved,
yet the face was dwindling.</p>

<p>Logan's voice grew gentler.</p>

<p>"Such was my love," he said, slowly. "Such was my great love
for the white men! My brothers pointed at me as they passed, and
said, 'He is the friend of white men.' And I had even thought
to live with you, but for the injuries of my brothers, the white
men.</p>

<p>"Unprovoked, in cold blood, they have slain my kin&mdash;all!&mdash;all!&mdash;not
sparing woman or child. There runs not a drop of my blood in the
veins of any living creature!</p>

<p>"Hearken, <em>Brothers</em>! I have withstood the storms of many
winters. Leaves and branches have been stripped from me. My eyes
are dim, my limbs totter, I must soon fall. I, who could make
the dry leaf turn green again; I, who could take the rattlesnake
in my palm; I, who had communion with the dead, dreaming and waking;
I am powerless. The wind blows hard! The old tree trembles! Its
branches are gone! Its sap is frozen! It bends! It falls! Peace!
Peace!</p>

<p>"Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one!"</p>

<p>The old man bent his withered head and covered his face with
his blanket. Through the frightful stillness the painful breathing
of the people swept like a smothered cry; women in the balcony
were sobbing; somewhere a child wept uncomforted.</p>

<p>Patrick Henry leaned across to me; his eyes were dim, his voice
choked in his throat.</p>

<p>"The great orator!" he whispered. "Oh, the great man!&mdash;greatest
of all! The last word has been said for Logan! I shall not speak,
Mr. Cardigan&mdash;it were sacrilege&mdash;now."</p>

<p>He rose and laid one arm about the motionless chief, then very
gently he drew him out into the aisle. There was not a sound in
the hall as they passed slowly out together, those great men who
had both struck to the hilt for the honour of their kindred and
of their native land.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Now, when at last he had disappeared, a living spectre of reproach,
which the guilt of men had raised to confound the lords of the
New World, those gathered there to listen breathed again, and
hastened to forget that glimpse which they had caught of the raw
heart of all tragedy&mdash;man's inhumanity to man.</p>

<p>Dunmore came slowly from his trance, mechanically preening his
silken plumage and ruffling like a meagre bird; Connolly rose
from his seat and shook himself, and, finding nothing better to
do, went about the platform, snuffing the candles, a duty pertaining
to servants, but which he was doubtless thankful to perform as
it brought his back to the spectators and gave his heavy, burning
face a respite from the pillory of eyes. Gibson leaned heavily
on his writing-table, wan, loose-jawed, and vacant-eyed. As for
Captain Murdy, he sat serenely in his chair, shapely legs crossed,
examining the lid of his snuff-box with ever-freshening interest.</p>

<p>Above us in the galleries some people had risen and were about
to leave. The rustle of silks and satins seemed to break the heavy
quiet; people breathed deeply, shifted in their seats, and turned
around. Some stood up to go; chairs and benches grated on the
stones; shoes shuffled and tapped sharply.</p>

<p>I had already determined to defer my interview with Lord Dunmore,
because, after the great chief's speech, my poor words must fall
stale on ears attuned to the majestic music of a mighty soul.
So, in the stir and noise around us, I rose and touched Jack Mount,
motioning him to follow. But before he could find his feet and
summon his wits to set them in motion, and ere I myself had edged
half-way to the aisle, I heard Doctor Connolly speaking in that
loud, hectoring tone, and I caught the name of Sir William Johnson
shouted from the platform.</p>

<p>"If the messenger from Johnstown be present," continued Doctor
Connolly, "let him be assured of a warm welcome from his Lordship,
the Earl of Dunmore, Governor of Virginia."</p>

<p>So the infatuated Dunmore, grasping at a straw to dam the current
of public sentiment, thought to fill empty minds with the news
of his betrothal, trusting that as all the world loves a lover,
this same planet might find an opportunity to take him to its
sentimental bosom.</p>

<p>His purpose was plain to me and perfectly loathsome; and as I
stood there, watching him, I could see the rouge crack when he
simpered. But I would not speak now.</p>

<p>Presently, looking around, I found that all those who had risen
had again seated themselves, and that I, fascinated by the repulsive
visage of Dunmore, stood there all alone.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to sit down hastily; my next to keep my
feet, for it was too late to seek cover now, and Connolly was
smiling at me, and Gibson nodded like a dazed mandarin. Dunmore,
too, was peering at me and tapping his snuff-box complacently,
and the sight of him brought the blood to my head and opened my
mouth. But no sound issued. A woman in the gallery laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Are you not a messenger from Sir William Johnson?" prompted
Connolly, with his domineering smile of patronage.</p>

<p>"Yes, Doctor Connolly," I replied, slowly. As I spoke, fright
vanished.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Dunmore tapped on his box and moistened his
slitted mouth with a tongue which looked perfectly blue to me,
and he fell a-smirking and bridling, with sly, rheumy glances
at the gallery.</p>

<p>"Lord Dunmore," I said, steadily, "ere I inform you why I am
here, you shall know me better than you think you do.</p>

<p>"I am not here to tell you of that chain which links the Governor
of Virginia with the corpse of Logan's youngest child!&mdash;nor to
count the links of that chain backward, from Greathouse to Murdy,
to Gibson, to Connolly, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" burst out Connolly, springing to his feet. "Who are you?
What are you? How dare you address such language to the Earl of
Dunmore?"</p>

<p>Astonished, furious, eyes injected with blood, he stood shaking
his mottled red fists at me; Dunmore sat in a heap, horrified,
with the simper on his face stamped into a grin of terror. The
interruption stirred up my blood to the boiling; I clutched the
back of the bench in front of me, and fixed my eyes on Connolly.</p>

<p>"I do not reply to servants," I said; "my business here is not
with Lord Dunmore's lackeys. If the Earl of Dunmore knows not
my name and title, he shall know it now! I am Michael Cardigan,
cornet in the Border Horse, and deputy of Sir William Johnson,
Baronet, his Majesty's Superintendent of Indian Affairs for North
America!</p>

<p>"Who dares deny me right of speech?"</p>

<p>Dunmore lay in his chair, a shrunken mess of lace and ribbon;
Connolly appeared paralyzed; Gibson stared at me over his table.</p>

<p>"I am not here," I said, coolly, "to ask your Lordship why this
war, falsely called Cresap's war, should be known to honest men
as 'Dunmore's war.' Nor do I come to ask you why England should
seek the savage allies of the Six Nations, which this war, so
cunningly devised, has given her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Treason! Treason!" bawled a voice behind me. It was Wraxall;
I recognized his whine.</p>

<p>"But," I resumed, pointing my finger straight at the staring
Governor, "I am here to demand an account of your stewardship!
Where are those Cayugas whom you have sworn to protect from the
greed of white men? Where are they? Answer, sir! Where are Sir
William Johnson's wards of the Long House? Where are the Shawanese,
the Wyandottes, the Lenape, the Senecas, who keep the western
portals of the Long House? Answer, sir! for this is my mission
from Sir William Johnson. Answer! lest the King say to him, 'O
thou unfaithful steward!"</p>

<p>Hubbub and outcry and tumult rose around me. Dunmore was getting
on his feet; Connolly flew to his aid, but the Governor snarled
at him and pushed him, and went shambling out of the door behind
the platform, while, in the hall, the uproar swelled into an angry
shout: "Shame on Dunmore! God save Virginia!"</p>

<p>An officer in the gallery leaned over the edge, waving his gold-laced
hat.</p>

<p>"God save the King!" he roared, and many answered, "God save
the King!" but that shout was drowned by a thundering outburst
of cheers: "God save our country! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Boston!" bawled Jack Mount, jumping up on his
bench; and the rolling cheers echoed from balcony to pavement
till the throng went wild and even the sober Quakers flung up
their broad-brimmed hats. In the gallery ladies were cheering,
waving scarfs and mantles; the British soldiers at the door looked
in at the astounding scene, some with sheepish grins, some gaping,
some scowling under their mitred head-gear.</p>

<p>Mount had caught me up in his arms and was shouldering his way
towards the door, yelping like a Mohawk at a corn feast; and presently
others crowded around, patting my legs and cheering, bearing me
onward and out past the sentinels, where, for a moment, I thought
soldiers and people would come to blows.</p>

<p>But Mount waved his cap and shouted an ear-splitting watchword:
"The ladies! Honour the ladies!" and the crowd fell back as the
excited dames and maidens from the balcony issued in silken procession
from the hall, filing between the soldiers and the crowd, to enter
coaches and chairs and disappear into the depths of the starlight.</p>

<p>I could not find Silver Heels, and presently I gave up that hope,
for the throng, hustled by the soldiers, began shoving and scuffling
and pressing, now forward, now backward, until the breath was
near squeezed from my body and I made out to slip back with Mount
and Renard to the open air.</p>

<p>Mount was enthusiastic. "Look sharp!" he said eagerly. "There
will be heads to break anon. Ha! See them running yonder! Hark!
Do you not hear that, Cade? Clink&mdash;whack! Bayonet against cudgel!
They're at it, lad! Come on! Come on! Give it to the damned Tories!"</p>

<p>The next instant we were enveloped in the crowd, buffeted, pushed,
trodden, hurled about like shuttle-cocks, yet ever retreating
before the line of gun-stocks which rose and fell along the outer
edge of the mob.</p>

<p>The fight was desperate and silent, save for the whipping swish
of ramrods whistling, the dull shocks of blows, or the ringing
crack of a cudgel on some luckless pate. Under foot our moccasins
moved and trampled among fallen hats and wigs, and sometimes we
stumbled over an insensible form, victim of gun-stock or club
or a buffet from some swinging fist.</p>

<p>Once, forced to the front where the soldiers were jabbing and
lashing the mob with gun-butt, ramrod, and leather belt, a drummer
boy ran at me and fell to thumping me with his drum, while a soldier
cuffed my ears till I reeled. Astonished and enraged by such scurvy
treatment I made out to wrest the drum from the boy and jam it
violently upon the head of the soldier, so that his head and mitre-cap
stuck out through the bursted parchment.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted the unfortunate man, who backed away,
distracted, clawing at the drum like a cat with its head in a
bag. Then the battle was renewed with fury afresh; a citizen wrested
a firelock from a soldier, drove the butt into the pit of his
stomach, and struck out sturdily in all directions, shouting,
"Long live our country!" Another knocked a soldier senseless and
tore off his white leggings for trophies&mdash;an operation that savoured
of barbarism.</p>

<p>"Scalp their legs! Skin 'em!" bawled the man, waving the leggings
in triumph; and I saw he was that same ranger of Boone and Harrod
who wore a baldrick of Wyandotte scalps.</p>

<p>It began to go hard with the King's soldiers, but they stuck
to the mob like bulldogs, giving blow for blow so stanchly and
so heartily that my blood tingled with pleasure and pride, and
I called out to Jack Mount: "Look at them, Jack! What very gluttons
for punishment! Nobody but British could stand up to us like that!"</p>

<p>A crack on the sconce from a belt transformed my admiration into
fury, and I drove my right fist into the eye of one of these same
British soldiers, and followed it with a swinging blow which sent
him spinning, receiving at the same moment such a jolt in the
body that I, too, went sprawling and gasping about until Mount
pulled me out of the crush.</p>

<p>When I had found my breath again, and had mastered that sick
faintness which comes from a blow in the stomach, I prepared to
return to the fray, which had now taken on a more sinister aspect.
Bayonets had already been used, not as clubs but as daggers; a
man was leaning against a tree near me, bleeding from a wound
in the neck, and another reeled past, tugging at a bayonet which
had transfixed his shoulder. But the end came suddenly now; horsemen
were galloping up behind the jaded soldiers; I saw Shemuel dart
out of the swaying throng and take to his heels, not even stopping
to gather up hats, handkerchiefs, and wigs, of which the sack
on his back was full to the top.</p>

<p>When Shemuel left a stricken field it was time for others to
think of flight; this I perceived at once when the Weasel came
scurrying past and called out to me. Mount followed, lumbering
on at full speed; the throng melted and scattered in every direction,
and I with them. Trust me, there was fine running done that night
in Pittsburg streets, and many a tall fellow worked his legs as
legs are seldom worked, for the gentlemen of the Governor's horse-guards
were riding us hard, and we legged it for cover, each fox to his
own spinny, each rabbit to the first unstopped earth. Tally-ho!
Stole away! Faith, it was merry hunting that night in Pittsburg
town, with the towns-people at every window and the town-watch
bawling at our heels, and the gentlemen riders pelting down the
King's Road till those who could double back doubled, and walked
panting to cover, with as innocent mien as they could muster.</p>

<p>Mount, Renard, Shemuel, and I had crossed the Boundary at respectable
speed, and were now headed for the dirty alley which conducted
to the rear door of Shemuel's den, the "Bear and Cubs." We were
about to enter this lane, no longer fearing pursuit&mdash;and I remember
that Mount was laughing, poking the Weasel in his short-ribs&mdash;when,
without warning, five men rushed at us in a body, overturning
us all save Jack Mount. The next moment we were locked in a struggle;
there was not a cry, not an oath, not a sound but the strained
gasp and heavy breathing, at first; but presently a piercing yell
echoed through the alley, and Shemuel ran squattering into the
inn. He had stuck a handful of needles into his assailant's leg,
and the man bounded madly about, while the alley re-echoed with
his howls of dismay.</p>

<p>As for me, I found myself clutched by that villain, Wraxall,
and I would have shouted with joy had he not held me by the windpipe
until I was nigh past all shouting. The creature was powerful;
he held me while Toby Tice tried to tie my wrists; but the Weasel
fell upon them both and kicked them so heartily that they left
me and took to their heels perdu.</p>

<p>And now came the host of the "Bear and Cubs," lanthorn in one
hand, a meat-knife in the other, and after him a tap-boy, an hostler,
a frowzy maid, and finally Shemuel, white with fear. But reinforcements
had arrived too late&mdash;too late to help us take the impudent band,
which had fled&mdash;too late to bring to life that dark mass lying
at the foot of the wall in the filth of the alley.</p>

<p>Mount seized the lanthorn and lowered it beside the shape on
the ground.</p>

<p>"His neck is broken," he said, briefly. It was his quarry; he
ought to know.</p>

<p>One by one we took the lanthorn and looked in turn on the dead.</p>

<p>"Greathouse," whispered Mount, moving the body with his foot.</p>

<p>"Greathouse, eh?" grumbled the host of the "Bear and Cubs." "Well,
he can't lie here behind <em>my</em> house." And he caught him
by the heels and dragged him to a black spot under a rotten shed.
There was a cistern there. I moved away, feeling strangely faint.
Mount linked his arm in mine.</p>

<p>Presently there sounded a dull noise under the ground, a shock
and thick splashing.</p>

<p>"Greathouse, eh?" muttered the shaggy innkeeper, winking at us.
"Well, Greathouse is in a small house behind a pot-house now,
and the devil, no doubt, will see that he lands in a hot-house!"</p>

<p>Mount shrugged his shoulders and turned away indifferently. He
had done his part; he had no slur for the dead. The Weasel and
I followed, and together we traversed the market-square unmolested,
and headed for the "Virginia Arms," discussing the utterly unprovoked
attack on us by Butler's band.</p>

<p>There had been five of them; I had recognized Wraxall and Tice,
the Weasel identified Murdy, Shemuel had thrust half his stock
of needles into one fellow's leg, whom I knew to be the man who
had supped on his own hatchet, and Mount had sternly accounted
for his assailant.</p>

<p>"So Greathouse is dead," muttered the Weasel.</p>

<p>"One thing is clear: they were after you," observed Mount, turning
on me.</p>

<p>"It is strange," I said, "that Butler was not there. He must
know what it means for him unless he can strike me from behind,
because I shall never miss him, face to face."</p>

<p>I spoke not in boast, nor in angry heat; I meant what I said,
and devoutly believed that nothing on earth could shield such
a man from the man he had so foully misused.</p>

<p>Coming into Pitt Street we found all empty and dark save for
the lanthorn hanging on its pole from every seventh house, and
a lone watchman who lifted his light to scan us, but durst not
question or stop us, though we bore marks enough of the fray to
satisfy any friendly jury of our guilt.</p>

<p>As for Mount, his shirt and leggings were in rags, for he had
played Orlando Furioso to his simple heart's satisfaction, and
now one naked arm peeped coyly from a flapping sleeve, and his
great legs twinkled white under the tattered nether-garments.
The Weasel, who had a genius for keeping himself neat under distressing
circumstances, appeared to be none the worse for wear, but guiltless
he could not be, for he carried a soldier's mitre-cap in his hand
and obstinately refused to part with the proof of his valour.
As for me, there were some seams which needed a thread, and somebody's
blood on my shirt which water would wash away.</p>

<p>"I went this noon to a tailor-woman on the Buckeye Road, and
did command me new deer-skins," said Mount. "I will borrow their
cost of you," he added, naïvely.</p>

<p>I felt for my money-belt and luckily found it safe. Mount accepted
the money cheerfully, promising to show me on the morrow how fine
he could be in new clothes, and mourning the fact that his greasy
garments had cost him a cruel epithet that day from a maid he
had attempted to kiss behind a barn on three minutes' acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Faith, she mocked me for a tankard-tip and called me pottle-pot,"
he said, sadly. "God knows I drink little for my height, and so
I told her, too!"</p>

<p>We were already at the "Virginia Arms," and I took him by the
elbow and drew him firmly past the tap-room.</p>

<p>"Are we not to sniff a posset?" he demanded, in injured surprise.
But he surrendered without a scene, for the late fighting had
cleared his head of alcohol, and we mounted to my chamber, bidding
a servant to fetch ink-horn, wax, sand, quill, and three sheets
of good, clean paper.</p>

<p>When I had lighted my candle, and the materials for writing had
been brought, I sat down on the bed and drew the table up before
me.</p>

<p>"What are we to do while you write?" asked Mount, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Keep out o' mischief and the tap-room," said I, mending the
quill with my hunting-knife.</p>

<p>They stood around rather blankly for a spell while I was composing
the first letter, but presently I noticed they had squatted on
the floor and were playing at jack-straws with pine splinters
from the boards.</p>

<p>My three letters cost me great labour; writing and composition
do ever rack me, mind and body, for I know that I spell not as
others spell, nor write as I ought to write in the Boston style,
and, moreover, those little dots which warn the wise reader that
a phrase is ended mean little to me; so I pepper my sheet well
with them and trust to God that they fall not on barren soil.</p>

<p>Thus armed with my quill, and doubly armed in the innocence of
my ignorance, I made out to accomplish my three letters. The first
was this:</p>
