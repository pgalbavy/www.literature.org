<p>After our escape from Agon and his pious crew we returned to our
quarters in the palace and had a very good time. The two Queens, the
nobles and the people vied with each other in doing us honour and
showering gifts upon us. As for that painful little incident of the
hippopotami it sank into oblivion, where we were quite content to leave
it. Every day deputations and individuals waited on us to examine our
guns and clothing, our chain shirts, and our instruments, especially our
watches, with which they were much delighted. In short, we became quite
the rage, so much so that some of the fashionable young swells among
the Zu-Vendi began to copy the cut of some of our clothes, notably Sir
Henry’s shooting jacket. One day, indeed, a deputation waited on us
and, as usual, Good donned his full-dress uniform for the occasion. This
deputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally
came to visit us. They were little insignificant men of an excessively
polite, not to say servile, demeanour; and their attention appeared
to be chiefly taken up with observing the details of Good’s full-dress
uniform, of which they took copious notes and measurements. Good was
much flattered at the time, not suspecting that he had to deal with the
six leading tailors of Milosis. A fortnight afterwards, however, when
on attending court as usual he had the pleasure of seeing some seven
or eight Zu-Vendi ‘mashers’ arrayed in all the glory of a very fair
imitation of his full-dress uniform, he changed his mind. I shall never
forget his face of astonishment and disgust. It was after this, chiefly
to avoid remark, and also because our clothes were wearing out and had
to be saved up, that we resolved to adopt the native dress; and a very
comfortable one we found it, though I am bound to say that I looked
sufficiently ridiculous in it, and as for Alphonse! Only Umslopogaas
would have none of these things; when his moocha was worn out the fierce
old Zulu made him a new one, and went about unconcerned, as grim and
naked as his own battleaxe.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile we pursued our study of the language steadily and made very
good progress. On the morning following our adventure in the temple,
three grave and reverend signiors presented themselves armed with
manuscript books, ink-horns and feather pens, and indicated that they
had been sent to teach us. So, with the exception of Umslopogaas, we all
buckled to with a will, doing four hours a day. As for Umslopogaas, he
would have none of that either. He did not wish to learn that ‘woman’s
talk’, not he; and when one of the teachers advanced on him with a book
and an ink-horn and waved them before him in a mild persuasive way, much
as a churchwarden invitingly shakes the offertory bag under the nose of
a rich but niggardly parishioner, he sprang up with a fierce oath and
flashed Inkosi-kaas before the eyes of our learned friend, and there was
an end of the attempt to teach <u>him</u> Zu-Vendi.
</p><p>Thus we spent our mornings in useful occupation which grew more and
more interesting as we proceeded, and the afternoons were given up to
recreation. Sometimes we made trips, notably one to the gold mines and
another to the marble quarries both of which I wish I had space and time
to describe; and sometimes we went out hunting buck with dogs trained
for that purpose, and a very exciting sport it is, as the country is
full of agricultural enclosures and our horses were magnificent. This
is not to be wondered at, seeing that the royal stables were at our
command, in addition to which we had four splendid saddle horses given
to us by Nyleptha.
</p><p>Sometimes, again, we went hawking, a pastime that is in great favour
among the Zu-Vendi, who generally fly their birds at a species of
partridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its
flight. When attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head,
and, instead of seeking cover, flies high into the sky, thus offering
wonderful sport. I have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out
of sight when followed by the hawk. Still better sport is offered by a
variety of solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock, which is plentiful
in this country, and which is flown at with a very small, agile, and
highly-trained hawk with an almost red tail. The zigzagging of the great
snipe and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the
red-tailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one. Another variety of
the same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope
with trained eagles; and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the
great bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the
sunlight, and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannon-ball upon
some cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything
but that piercing eye. Still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes
the buck running.
</p><p>On other days we would pay visits to the country seats at some of the
great lords’ beautiful fortified places, and the villages clustering
beneath their walls. Here we saw vineyards and corn-fields and well-kept
park-like grounds, with such timber in them as filled me with delight,
for I do love a good tree. There it stands so strong and sturdy, and yet
so beautiful, a very type of the best sort of man. How proudly it
lifts its bare head to the winter storms, and with what a full heart it
rejoices when the spring has come again! How grand its voice is, too,
when it talks with the wind: a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the
beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf. All day it points to the
sunshine and all night to the stars, and thus passionless, and yet
full of life, it endures through the centuries, come storm, come shine,
drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth, and as
the slow years roll by, learning the great mysteries of growth and of
decay. And so on and on through generations, outliving individuals,
customs, dynasties--all save the landscape it adorns and human
nature--till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and
rejoices over a reclaimed space, or decay puts the last stroke to his
fungus-fingered work.
</p><p>Ah, one should always think twice before one cuts down a tree!
</p><p>In the evenings it was customary for Sir Henry, Good, and myself to
dine, or rather sup, with their Majesties--not every night, indeed, but
about three or four times a week, whenever they had not much company, or
the affairs of state would allow of it. And I am bound to say that those
little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that
I ever had to do with. How true is the saying that the very highest
in rank are always the most simple and kindly. It is from your
half-and-half sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity, the
difference between the two being very much what one sees every day in
England between the old, out-at-elbows, broken-down county family, and
the overbearing, purse-proud people who come and ‘take the place’. I
really think that Nyleptha’s greatest charm is her sweet simplicity, and
her kindly genuine interest even in little things. She is the simplest
woman I ever knew, and where her passions are not involved, one of the
sweetest; but she can look queenly enough when she likes, and be as
fierce as any savage too.
</p><p>For instance, never shall I forget that scene when I for the first time
was sure that she was really in love with Curtis. It came about in this
way--all through Good’s weakness for ladies’ society. When we had been
employed for some three months in learning Zu-Vendi, it struck Master
Good that he was getting rather tired of the old gentlemen who did us
the honour to lead us in the way that we should go, so he proceeded,
without saying a word to anybody else, to inform them that it was a
peculiar fact, but that we could not make any real progress in the
deeper intricacies of a foreign language unless we were taught by
ladies--young ladies, he was careful to explain. In his own country, he
pointed out, it was habitual to choose the very best-looking and most
charming girls who could be found to instruct any strangers who happened
to come that way, etc.
</p><p>All of this the old gentlemen swallowed open-mouthed. There was,
they admitted, reason in what he said, since the contemplation of the
beautiful, as their philosophy taught, induced a certain porosity of
mind similar to that produced upon the physical body by the healthful
influences of sun and air. Consequently it was probable that we might
absorb the Zu-Vendi tongue a little faster if suitable teachers could
be found. Another thing was that, as the female sex was naturally
loquacious, good practice would be gained in the viva voce department of
our studies.
</p><p>To all of this Good gravely assented, and the learned gentlemen
departed, assuring him that their orders were to fall in with our wishes
in every way, and that, if possible, our views should be met.
</p><p>Imagine, therefore the surprise and disgust of myself, and I trust and
believe Sir Henry, when, on entering the room where we were accustomed
to carry on our studies the following morning, we found, instead of
our usual venerable tutors, three of the best-looking young women whom
Milosis could produce--and that is saying a good deal--who blushed and
smiled and curtseyed, and gave us to understand that they were there
to carry on our instruction. Then Good, as we gazed at one another in
bewilderment, thought fit to explain, saying that it had slipped his
memory before--but the old gentlemen had told him, on the previous
evening, that it was absolutely necessary that our further education
should be carried on by the other sex. I was overwhelmed, and appealed
to Sir Henry for advice in such a crisis.
</p><p>‘Well,’ he said, ‘you see the ladies are here, ain’t they? If we sent
them away, don’t you think it might hurt their feelings, eh? One doesn’t
like to be rough, you see; and they look regular <u>blues</u>, don’t they,
eh?’
</p><p>By this time Good had already begun his lessons with the handsomest of
the three, and so with a sigh I yielded. That day everything went very
well: the young ladies were certainly very clever, and they only smiled
when we blundered. I never saw Good so attentive to his books before,
and even Sir Henry appeared to tackle Zu-Vendi with a renewed zest.
‘Ah,’ thought I, ‘will it always be thus?’
</p><p>Next day we were much more lively, our work was pleasingly interspersed
with questions about our native country, what the ladies were like
there, etc., all of which we answered as best as we could in Zu-Vendi,
and I heard Good assuring his teacher that her loveliness was to the
beauties of Europe as the sun to the moon, to which she replied with a
little toss of the head, that she was a plain teaching woman and nothing
else, and that it was not kind ‘to deceive a poor girl so’. Then we had
a little singing that was really charming, so natural and unaffected.
The Zu-Vendi love-songs are most touching. On the third day we were all
quite intimate. Good narrated some of his previous love affairs to his
fair teacher, and so moved was she that her sighs mingled with his own.
I discoursed with mine, a merry blue-eyed girl, upon Zu-Vendian art, and
never saw that she was waiting for an opportunity to drop a specimen of
the cockroach tribe down my back, whilst in the corner Sir Henry and
his governess appeared, so far as I could judge, to be going through a
lesson framed on the great educational principles laid down by Wackford
Squeers Esq., though in a very modified or rather spiritualized form.
The lady softly repeated the Zu-Vendi word for ‘hand’, and he took hers;
‘eyes’, and he gazed deep into her brown orbs; ‘lips’, and--but just at
that moment <u>my</u> young lady dropped the cockroach down my back and ran
away laughing. Now if there is one thing I loathe more than another it
is cockroaches, and moved quite beyond myself, and yet laughing at her
impudence, I took up the cushion she had been sitting on and threw it
after her. Imagine then my shame--my horror, and my distress--when the
door opened, and, attended by two guards only, in walked <u>Nyleptha</u>.
The cushion could not be recalled (it missed the girl and hit one of the
guards on the head), but I instantly and ineffectually tried to look as
though I had not thrown it. Good ceased his sighing, and began to murder
Zu-Vendi at the top of his voice, and Sir Henry whistled and looked
silly. As for the poor girls, they were utterly dumbfounded.
</p><p>And Nyleptha! she drew herself up till her frame seemed to tower even
above that of the tall guards, and her face went first red, and then
pale as death.
</p><p>‘Guards,’ she said in a quiet choked voice, and pointing at the fair but
unconscious disciple of Wackford Squeers, ‘slay me that woman.’
</p><p>The men hesitated, as well they might.
</p><p>‘Will ye do my bidding,’ she said again in the same voice, ‘or will ye
not?’
</p><p>Then they advanced upon the girl with uplifted spears. By this time Sir
Henry had recovered himself, and saw that the comedy was likely to turn
into a tragedy.
</p><p>‘Stand back,’ he said in a voice of thunder, at the same time getting in
front of the terrified girl. ‘Shame on thee, Nyleptha--shame! Thou shalt
not kill her.’
</p><p>‘Doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her. Thou couldst
hardly do less in honour,’ answered the infuriated Queen; ‘but she shall
die--she shall die,’ and she stamped her little foot.
</p><p>‘It is well,’ he answered; ‘then will I die with her. I am thy servant,
oh Queen; do with me even as thou wilt.’ And he bowed towards her, and
fixed his clear eyes contemptuously on her face.
</p><p>‘I could wish to slay thee too,’ she answered; ‘for thou dost make a
mock of me;’ and then feeling that she was mastered, and I suppose not
knowing what else to do, she burst into such a storm of tears and looked
so royally lovely in her passionate distress, that, old as I am, I must
say I envied Curtis his task of supporting her. It was rather odd to see
him holding her in his arms considering what had just passed--a thought
that seemed to occur to herself, for presently she wrenched herself free
and went, leaving us all much disturbed.
</p><p>Presently, however, one of the guards returned with a message to the
girls that they were, on pain of death, to leave the city and return to
their homes in the country, and that no further harm would come to them;
and accordingly they went, one of them remarking philosophically that
it could not be helped, and that it was a satisfaction to know that they
had taught us a little serviceable Zu-Vendi. Mine was an exceedingly
nice girl, and, overlooking the cockroach, I made her a present of my
favourite lucky sixpence with a hole in it when she went away. After
that our former masters resumed their course of instruction, needless to
say to my great relief.
</p><p>That night, when in fear and trembling we attended the royal supper
table, we found that Nyleptha was laid up with a bad headache. That
headache lasted for three whole days; but on the fourth she was present
at supper as usual, and with the most gracious and sweet smile gave Sir
Henry her hand to lead her to the table. No allusion was made to the
little affair described above beyond her saying, with a charming air of
innocence, that when she came to see us at our studies the other day she
had been seized with a giddiness from which she had only now recovered.
She supposed, she added with a touch of the humour that was common to
her, that it was the sight of people working so hard which had affected
her.
</p><p>In reply Sir Henry said, dryly, that he had thought she did not look
quite herself on that day, whereat she flashed one of those quick
glances of hers at him, which if he had the feelings of a man must have
gone through him like a knife, and the subject dropped entirely.
Indeed, after supper was over Nyleptha condescended to put us through
an examination to see what we had learnt, and to express herself well
satisfied with the results. Indeed, she proceeded to give us, especially
Sir Henry, a lesson on her own account, and very interesting we found
it.
</p><p>And all the while that we talked, or rather tried to talk, and laughed,
Sorais would sit there in her carven ivory chair, and look at us and
read us all like a book, only from time to time saying a few words, and
smiling that quick ominous smile of hers which was more like a flash of
summer lightning on a dark cloud than anything else. And as near to her
as he dared would sit Good, worshipping through his eyeglass, for he
really was getting seriously devoted to this sombre beauty, of whom,
speaking personally, I felt terribly afraid. I watched her keenly, and
soon I found out that for all her apparent impassibility she was at
heart bitterly jealous of Nyleptha. Another thing I found out, and
the discovery filled me with dismay, and that was, that she <u>also</u> was
growing devoted to Sir Henry Curtis. Of course I could not be sure; it
is not easy to read so cold and haughty a woman; but I noticed one or
two little things, and, as elephant hunters know, dried grass shows
which way the wind has set.
</p><p>And so another three months passed over us, by which time we had all
attained to a very considerable mastery of the Zu-Vendi language,
which is an easy one to learn. And as the time went on we became great
favourites with the people, and even with the courtiers, gaining an
enormous reputation for cleverness, because, as I think I have said,
Sir Henry was able to show them how to make glass, which was a national
want, and also, by the help of a twenty-year almanac that we had
with us, to predict various heavenly combinations which were
quite unsuspected by the native astronomers. We even succeeded in
demonstrating the principle of the steam-engine to a gathering of the
learned men, who were filled with amazement; and several other things of
the same sort we did. And so it came about that the people made up their
minds that we must on no account be allowed to go out of the country
(which indeed was an apparent impossibility even if we had wished it),
and we were advanced to great honour and made officers to the bodyguards
of the sister Queens while permanent quarters were assigned to us in the
palace, and our opinion was asked upon questions of national policy.
</p><p>But blue as the sky seemed, there was a cloud, and a big one, on the
horizon. We had indeed heard no more of those confounded hippopotami,
but it is not on that account to be supposed that our sacrilege was
forgotten, or the enmity of the great and powerful priesthood headed by
Agon appeased. On the contrary, it was burning the more fiercely because
it was necessarily suppressed, and what had perhaps begun in bigotry
was ending in downright direct hatred born of jealousy. Hitherto, the
priests had been the wise men of the land, and were on this account, as
well as from superstitious causes, looked on with peculiar veneration.
But our arrival, with our outlandish wisdom and our strange inventions
and hints of unimagined things, dealt a serious blow to this state of
affairs, and, among the educated Zu-Vendi, went far towards destroying
the priestly prestige. A still worse affront to them, however, was the
favour with which we were regarded, and the trust that was reposed in
us. All these things tended to make us excessively obnoxious to the
great sacerdotal clan, the most powerful because the most united faction
in the kingdom.
</p><p>Another source of imminent danger to us was the rising envy of some of
the great lords headed by Nasta, whose antagonism to us had at best
been but thinly veiled, and which now threatened to break out into open
flame. Nasta had for some years been a candidate for Nyleptha’s hand in
marriage, and when we appeared on the scene I fancy, from all I could
gather, that though there were still many obstacles in his path, success
was by no means out of his reach. But now all this had changed; the coy
Nyleptha smiled no more in his direction, and he was not slow to guess
the cause. Infuriated and alarmed, he turned his attention to Sorais,
only to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain side. With a
bitter jest or two about his fickleness, that door was closed on him for
ever. So Nasta bethought himself of the thirty thousand wild swordsmen
who would pour down at his bidding through the northern mountain passes,
and no doubt vowed to adorn the gates of Milosis with our heads.
</p><p>But first he determined, as I learned, to make one more attempt and to
demand the hand of Nyleptha in the open Court after the formal annual
ceremony of the signing of the laws that had been proclaimed by the
Queens during the year.
</p><p>Of this astounding fact Nyleptha heard with simulated nonchalance, and
with a little trembling of the voice herself informed us of it as we sat
at supper on the night preceding the great ceremony of the law-giving.
</p><p>Sir Henry bit his lip, and do what he could to prevent it plainly showed
his agitation.
</p><p>‘And what answer will the Queen be pleased to give to the great Lord?’
asked I, in a jesting manner.
</p><p>‘Answer, Macumazahn’ (for we had elected to pass by our Zulu names in
Zu-Vendis), she said, with a pretty shrug of her ivory shoulder. ‘Nay, I
know not; what is a poor woman to do, when the wooer has thirty thousand
swords wherewith to urge his love?’ And from under her long lashes she
glanced at Curtis.
</p><p>Just then we rose from the table to adjourn into another room.
‘Quatermain, a word, quick,’ said Sir Henry to me. ‘Listen. I have never
spoken about it, but surely you have guessed: I love Nyleptha. What am I
to do?’
</p><p>Fortunately, I had more or less already taken the question into
consideration, and was therefore able to give such answer as seemed the
wisest to me.
</p><p>‘You must speak to Nyleptha tonight,’ I said. ‘Now is your time, now or
never. Listen. In the sitting-chamber get near to her, and whisper to
her to meet you at midnight by the Rademas statue at the end of the
great hall. I will keep watch for you there. Now or never, Curtis.’
</p><p>We passed on into the other room. Nyleptha was sitting, her hands before
her, and a sad anxious look upon her lovely face. A little way off was
Sorais talking to Good in her slow measured tones.
</p><p>The time went on; in another quarter of an hour I knew that, according
to their habit, the Queens would retire. As yet, Sir Henry had had no
chance of saying a word in private: indeed, though we saw much of the
royal sisters, it was by no means easy to see them alone. I racked my
brains, and at last an idea came to me.
</p><p>‘Will the Queen be pleased,’ I said, bowing low before Sorais, ‘to sing
to her servants? Our hearts are heavy this night; sing to us, oh Lady of
the Night’ (Sorais’ favourite name among the people).
</p><p>‘My songs, Macumazahn, are not such as to lighten the heavy heart, yet
will I sing if it pleases thee,’ she answered; and she rose and went a
few paces to a table whereon lay an instrument not unlike a zither, and
struck a few wandering chords.
</p><p>Then suddenly, like the notes of some deep-throated bird, her rounded
voice rang out in song so wildly sweet, and yet with so eerie and sad
a refrain, that it made the very blood stand still. Up, up soared the
golden notes, that seemed to melt far away, and then to grow again and
travel on, laden with all the sorrow of the world and all the despair of
the lost. It was a marvellous song, but I had not time to listen to
it properly. However, I got the words of it afterwards, and here is a
translation of its burden, so far as it admits of being translated at
all.
</p>
<p><strong>SORAIS’ SONG</strong>
</p><p>  As a desolate bird that through darkness its lost way is winging,
  As a hand that is helplessly raised when Death’s sickle is swinging,
  So is life! ay, the life that lends passion and breath to my singing.
</p><p>  As the nightingale’s song that is full of a sweetness unspoken,
  As a spirit unbarring the gates of the skies for a token,
  So is love! ay, the love that shall fall when his pinion is broken.
</p><p>  As the tramp of the legions when trumpets their challenge are sending,
  As the shout of the Storm-god when lightnings the black sky are rending,
  So is power! ay, the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending.
</p><p>  So short is our life; yet with space for all things to forsake us,
  A bitter delusion, a dream from which nought can awake us,
  Till Death’s dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall o’ertake us.
</p>
<p>Refrain
</p><p>  Oh, the world is fair at the dawning--dawning--dawning,
  But the red sun sinks in blood--the red sun sinks in blood.
</p>
<p>I only wish that I could write down the music too.
</p><p>‘Now, Curtis, now,’ I whispered, when she began the second verse, and
turned my back.
</p><p>‘Nyleptha,’ he said--for my nerves were so much on the stretch that I
could hear every word, low as it was spoken, even through Sorais’ divine
notes--‘Nyleptha, I must speak with thee this night, upon my life I
must. Say me not nay; oh, say me not nay!’
</p><p>‘How can I speak with thee?’ she answered, looking fixedly before her;
‘Queens are not like other people. I am surrounded and watched.’
</p><p>‘Listen, Nyleptha, thus. I will be before the statue of Rademas in
the great hall at midnight. I have the countersign and can pass in.
Macumazahn will be there to keep guard, and with him the Zulu. Oh come,
my Queen, deny me not.’
</p><p>‘It is not seemly,’ she murmured, ‘and tomorrow--’
</p><p>Just then the music began to die in the last wail of the refrain, and
Sorais slowly turned her round.
</p><p>‘I will be there,’ said Nyleptha, hurriedly; ‘on thy life see that thou
fail me not.’
