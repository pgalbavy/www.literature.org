<p>The faint murmur of the words spoken on that night lingered for
a long time in Lingard's ears, more persistent than the memory
of an uproar; he looked with a fixed gaze at the stars burning
peacefully in the square of the doorway, while after listening
in silence to all he had to say, Belarab, as if seduced by the
strength and audacity of the white man, opened his heart without
reserve. He talked of his youth surrounded by the fury of fanaticism
and war, of battles on the hills, of advances through the forests,
of men's unswerving piety, of their unextinguishable hate. Not
a single wandering cloud obscured the gentle splendour of the
rectangular patch of starlight framed in the opaque blackness
of the hut. Belarab murmured on of a succession of reverses, of
the ring of disasters narrowing round men's fading hopes and undiminished
courage. He whispered of defeat and flight, of the days of despair,
of the nights without sleep, of unending pursuit, of the bewildered
horror and sombre fury, of their women and children killed in
the stockade before the besieged sallied forth to die.</p>

<p>"I have seen all this before I was in years a man," he cried,
low.</p>

<p>His voice vibrated. In the pause that succeeded they heard a
light sigh of the sleeping follower who, clasping his legs above
his ankles, rested his forehead on his knees.</p>

<p>"And there was amongst us," began Belarab again, "one white man
who remained to the end, who was faithful with his strength, with
his courage, with his wisdom. A great man. He had great riches
but a greater heart."</p>

<p>The memory of Jorgenson, emaciated and grey-haired, and trying
to borrow five dollars to get something to eat for the girl, passed
before Lingard suddenly upon the pacific glitter of the stars.</p>

<p>"He resembled you," pursued Belarab, abruptly. "We escaped with
him, and in his ship came here. It was a solitude. The forest
came near to the sheet of water, the rank grass waved upon the
heads of tall men. Telal, my father, died of weariness; we were
only a few, and we all nearly died of trouble and sadness&mdash;here.
On this spot! And no enemies could tell where we had gone. It
was the Shore of Refuge&mdash;and starvation."</p>

<p>He droned on in the night, with rising and falling inflections.
He told how his desperate companions wanted to go out and die
fighting on the sea against the ships from the west, the ships
with high sides and white sails; and how, unflinching and alone,
he kept them battling with the thorny bush, with the rank grass,
with the soaring and enormous trees. Lingard, leaning on his elbow
and staring through the door, recalled the image of the wide fields
outside, sleeping now, in an immensity of serenity and starlight.
This quiet and almost invisible talker had done it all; in him
was the origin, the creation, the fate; and in the wonder of that
thought the shadowy murmuring figure acquired a gigantic greatness
of significance, as if it had been the embodiment of some natural
force, of a force forever masterful and undying.</p>

<p>"And even now my life is unsafe as if I were their enemy," said
Belarab, mournfully. "Eyes do not kill, nor angry words; and curses
have no power, else the Dutch would not grow fat living on our
land, and I would not be alive to-night. Do you understand? Have
you seen the men who fought in the old days? They have not forgotten
the times of war. I have given them homes and quiet hearts and
full bellies. I alone. And they curse my name in the dark, in
each other's ears&mdash;because they can never forget."</p>

<p>This man, whose talk had been of war and violence, discovered
unexpectedly a passionate craving for security and peace. No one
would understand him. Some of those who would not understand had
died. His white teeth gleamed cruelly in the dark. But there were
others he could not kill. The fools. He wanted the land and the
people in it to be forgotten as if they had been swallowed by
the sea. But they had neither wisdom nor patience. Could they
not wait? They chanted prayers five times every day, but they
had not the faith.</p>

<p>"Death comes to all&mdash;and to the believers the end of trouble.
But you white men who are too strong for us, you also die. You
die. And there is a Paradise as great as all earth and all Heaven
together, but not for you&mdash;not for you!"</p>

<p>Lingard, amazed, listened without a sound. The sleeper snored
faintly. Belarab continued very calm after this almost involuntary
outburst of a consoling belief. He explained that he wanted somebody
at his back, somebody strong and whom he could trust, some outside
force that would awe the unruly, that would inspire their ignorance
with fear, and make his rule secure. He groped in the dark and
seizing Lingard's arm above the elbow pressed it with force&mdash;then
let go. And Lingard understood why his temerity had been so successful.</p>

<p>Then and there, in return for Lingard's open support, a few guns
and a little money, Belarab promised his help for the conquest
of Wajo. There was no doubt he could find men who would fight.
He could send messages to friends at a distance and there were
also many unquiet spirits in his own district ready for any adventure.
He spoke of these men with fierce contempt and an angry tenderness,
in mingled accents of envy and disdain. He was wearied by their
folly, by their recklessness, by their impatience&mdash;and he seemed
to resent these as if they had been gifts of which he himself
had been deprived by the fatality of his wisdom. They would fight.
When the time came Lingard had only to speak, and a sign from
him would send them to a vain death&mdash;those men who could not wait
for an opportunity on this earth or for the eternal revenge of
Heaven.</p>

<p>He ceased, and towered upright in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Awake!" he exclaimed, low, bending over the sleeping man.</p>

<p>Their black shapes, passing in turn, eclipsed for two successive
moments the glitter of the stars, and Lingard, who had not stirred,
remained alone. He lay back full length with an arm thrown across
his eyes.</p>

<p>When three days afterward he left Belarab's settlement, it was
on a calm morning of unclouded peace. All the boats of the brig
came up into the lagoon armed and manned to make more impressive
the solemn fact of a concluded alliance. A staring crowd watched
his imposing departure in profound silence and with an increased
sense of wonder at the mystery of his apparition. The progress
of the boats was smooth and slow while they crossed the wide lagoon.
Lingard looked back once. A great stillness had laid its hand
over the earth, the sky, and the men; upon the immobility of landscape
and people. Hassim and Immada, standing out clearly by the side
of the chief, raised their arms in a last salutation; and the
distant gesture appeared sad, futile, lost in space, like a sign
of distress made by castaways in the vain hope of an impossible
help.</p>

<p>He departed, he returned, he went away again, and each time those
two figures, lonely on some sandbank of the Shallows, made at
him the same futile sign of greeting or good-bye. Their arms at
each movement seemed to draw closer around his heart the bonds
of a protecting affection. He worked prosaically, earning money
to pay the cost of the romantic necessity that had invaded his
life. And the money ran like water out of his hands. The owner
of the New England voice remitted not a little of it to his people
in Baltimore. But import houses in the ports of the Far East had
their share. It paid for a fast prau which, commanded by Jaffir,
sailed into unfrequented bays and up unexplored rivers, carrying
secret messages, important news, generous bribes. A good part
of it went to the purchase of the Emma.</p>

<p>The Emma was a battered and decrepit old schooner that, in the
decline of her existence, had been much ill-used by a paunchy
white trader of cunning and gluttonous aspect. This man boasted
outrageously afterward of the good price he had got "for that
rotten old hooker of mine&mdash;you know." The Emma left port mysteriously
in company with the brig and henceforth vanished from the seas
forever. Lingard had her towed up the creek and ran her aground
upon that shore of the lagoon farthest from Belarab's settlement.
There had been at that time a great rise of waters, which retiring
soon after left the old craft cradled in the mud, with her bows
grounded high between the trunks of two big trees, and leaning
over a little as though after a hard life she had settled wearily
to an everlasting rest. There, a few months later, Jorgenson found
her when, called back into the life of men, he reappeared, together
with Lingard, in the Land of Refuge.</p>

<p>"She is better than a fort on shore," said Lingard, as side by
side they leant over the taffrail, looking across the lagoon on
the houses and palm groves of the settlement. "All the guns and
powder I have got together so far are stored in her. Good idea,
wasn't it? There will be, perhaps, no other such flood for years,
and now they can't come alongside unless right under the counter,
and only one boat at a time. I think you are perfectly safe here;
you could keep off a whole fleet of boats; she isn't easy to set
fire to; the forest in front is better than a wall. Well?"</p>

<p>Jorgenson assented in grunts. He looked at the desolate emptiness
of the decks, at the stripped spars, at the dead body of the dismantled
little vessel that would know the life of the seas no more. The
gloom of the forest fell on her, mournful like a winding sheet.
The bushes of the bank tapped their twigs on the bluff of her
bows, and a pendent spike of tiny brown blossoms swung to and
fro over the ruins of her windlass.</p>

<p>Hassim's companions garrisoned the old hulk, and Jorgenson, left
in charge, prowled about from stem to stern, taciturn and anxiously
faithful to his trust. He had been received with astonishment,
respect&mdash;and awe. Belarab visited him often. Sometimes those whom
he had known in their prime years ago, during a struggle for faith
and life, would come to talk with the white man. Their voices
were like the echoes of stirring events, in the pale glamour of
a youth gone by. They nodded their old heads. Do you remember?&mdash;they
said. He remembered only too well! He was like a man raised from
the dead, for whom the fascinating trust in the power of life
is tainted by the black scepticism of the grave.</p>

<p>Only at times the invincible belief in the reality of existence
would come back, insidious and inspiring. He squared his shoulders,
held himself straight, and walked with a firmer step. He felt
a glow within him and the quickened beat of his heart. Then he
calculated in silent excitement Lingard's chances of success,
and he lived for a time with the life of that other man who knew
nothing of the black scepticism of the grave. The chances were
good, very good.</p>

<p>"I should like to see it through," Jorgenson muttered to himself
ardently; and his lustreless eyes would flash for a moment.</p>
