<p>Carson Tinker was in the elevator at the Pantheon, and the operator
was closing the door thereof, about to ascend, but delayed upon
a sound of running footsteps and a call of "Up!" Stewart Canby
plunged into the cage; his hat, clutched in his hand, disclosing
emphatically that he had been at his hair again.</p>

<p>"What's he mean?" he demanded fiercely. "What have I done?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" inquired the calm Tinker.</p>

<p>"What's he called it off for?"</p>

<p>"Called what off?"</p>

<p>"The play! My play!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't seen him since
rehearsal. His Japanese boy called me on the telephone a little
while ago and told me he wanted to see me."</p>

<p>"He did?" cried the distracted Canby. "The Japanese boy wanted
to see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Tinker corrected. "He did."</p>

<p>"And you haven't heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Twelfth," urged the operator, having opened the door. "Twelfth,
if you please, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything to cause excitement," said Tinker,
stepping out. "I haven't heard anything at all." He pressed the
tiny disc beside the door of Potter's apartment. "What's upset
you?"</p>

<p>With a pathetic gesture Canby handed him Potter's note. "What
have I done? What does he think I've done to him?"</p>

<p>Tinker read the note and shook his head. "The Lord knows! You
see he's all moods, and they change&mdash;they change any time. He
knows his business, but you can't count on him. He's liable to
do anything&mdash;anything at all."</p>

<p>"But what reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Japanese boy, Sato, stood bobbing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Mis' Potter kassee," he said courteously. "Ve'y so'y Mis' Potter
kassee nobody."</p>

<p>"Can't see us?" said Tinker. "Yes, he can. You telephoned me
that he wanted to see me, not over a quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>Sato beamed upon him enthusiastically. "Yisso, yisso! See Mis'
Tinker, yisso! You come in, Mis' Tinker. Ve'y so'y. Mis' Potter
kassee nobody."</p>

<p>"You mean he'll see Mister Tinker but won't see anybody else?"
cried the playwright.</p>

<p>"Yisso," said Sato, delighted. "Ve'y so'y. Mis' Potter kassee
nobody."</p>

<p>"I will see him. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait. It's all right," Tinker reassured him soothingly. "It's
all right, Sato. You go and tell Mr. Potter that I'm here and
Mr. Canby came with me."</p>

<p>"Yisso." Sato stood back from the door obediently, and they passed
into the hall. "You sidowm, please."</p>

<p>"Tell him we're waiting in here," said Tinker, leading the way
into the cream-coloured salon.</p>

<p>"Yisso." Sato disappeared.</p>

<p>The pretty room was exquisitely cheerful, a coal fire burning
rosily in the neat little grate, but for its effect upon Canby
it might have been a dentist's anteroom. He was unable to sit,
and began to pace up and down, shampooing himself with both hands.</p>

<p>"I've racked my brains every step of the way here," he groaned.
"All I could think of was that possibly I've unconsciously paralleled
some other play that I never saw. Maybe someone's told him about
a plot like mine. Such things must happen&mdash;they do happen, of
course&mdash;because all plots are old. But I can't believe my treatment
of it could be so like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's that," said Tinker. "It's never anything
you expect&mdash;with him."</p>

<p>"Well, what else can it be?" the playwright demanded. "I haven't
done anything to offend him. What have I done that he should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd better sit down," the manager advised him. "Going plumb
crazy never helped anything yet that I know of."</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! How can I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered Tinker.</p>

<p>A tragic figure made its appearance upon the threshold of the
inner doorway: Potter, his face set with epic woe, gloom burning
in his eyes like the green fire in a tripod at a funeral of state.
His plastic hair hung damp and irregular over his white brow&mdash;a
wreath upon a tombstone in the rain&mdash;and his garment, from throat
to ankle, was a dressing-gown of dead black, embroidered in purple;
soiled, magnificent, awful. Beneath its midnight border were his
bare ankles, final testimony to his desperate condition, for only
in ultimate despair does a suffering man remove his trousers.
The feet themselves were distractedly not of the tableau, being
immersed in bedroom shoes of gay white fur shaped in a Romeo pattern;
but this was the grimmest touch of all&mdash;the merry song of mad
Ophelia.</p>

<p>"Mr. Potter!" the playwright began, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Potter turned without a word and disappeared into the room whence
he came.</p>

<p>"Mr. Potter!" Canby started to follow. "Mr. Pot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered Tinker.</p>

<p>Potter appeared again upon the threshold In one hand he held
a large goblet; in the other a bottle of Bourbon whiskey, just
opened. With solemn tread he approached a delicate table, set
the goblet upon it, and lifted the bottle high above.</p>

<p>"I am in no condition to talk to anybody," he said hoarsely.
"I am about to take my first drink of spirits in five years."</p>

<p>And he tilted the bottle. The liquor clucked and guggled, plashed
into the goblet, and splashed upon the table; but when he set
the bottle down the glass was full to its capacious brim, and
looked, upon the little "Louis Sixteenth" table, like a sot at
the Trianon. Potter stepped back and pointed to it majestically.</p>

<p>"That," he said, "is the size of the drink I am about to take!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Potter," said Canby hotly, "will you tell me what's the
matter with my play? Haven't I made every change you suggested?
Haven't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Potter tossed his arms above his head and flung himself full
length upon the chaise lounge.</p>

<p>"<em>STOP </em>it!" he shouted. "I won't be pestered. I won't!
Nothing's the matter with your play!"</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;"</p>

<p>Potter swung himself round to a sitting position and hammered
with his open palm upon his knee for emphasis: "Nothing's the
matter with it, I tell you! I simply won't play it!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I simply won't play it! I don't like it!"</p>

<p>The playwright dropped into a chair, open-mouthed. "Will you
tell me why you ever accepted it?"</p>

<p>"I don't like any play! I hate 'em all! I'm through with 'em
all! I'm through with the whole business! 'Show-business!' Faugh!"</p>

<p>Old Tinker regarded him thoughtfully, then inquired: "Gone back
on it?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I'm going to buy a farm!" He sprang up, went to the
mantel and struck it a startling blow with his fist, which appeared
to calm him somewhat&mdash;for a moment. "I've been thinking of it
for a long time. I ought never to have been in this business at
all, and I'm going to live in the country. Oh, I'm in my right
mind!" He paused to glare indignantly in response to old Tinker's
steady gaze. "Of course you think 'something's happened' to upset
me. Well, nothing has. Nothing of the slightest consequence has
occurred since I saw you at rehearsal. Can't a man be allowed
to think? I just came home here and got to thinking of the kind
of life I lead&mdash;and I decided that I'm tired of it. And I'm not
going to lead it any longer. That's all."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tinker quietly. "Nerves."</p>

<p>Talbot Potter appealed to the universe with a passionate gesture.
"Nerves!" he cried bitterly. "Yes, that's what they say when an
actor dares to think. 'Go on! Play your part! Be a marionette
forever!' That's what you tell us! 'Slave for your living, you
sordid little puppet! Squirm and sweat and strut, but don't you
ever dare to think!' You tell us that because you know if we ever
did stop to think for one instant about ourselves you wouldn't
have any actors! Actors! Faugh! What do we get, I ask you?"</p>

<p>He strode close to Tinker and shook a frantic forefinger within
a foot of the quiet old fellow's face.</p>

<p>"What do I get?" he demanded, passionately. "Do you think it
means anything to me that some fat old woman sees me making love
to a sawdust actress at a matinee and then goes home and hates
her fat old husband across the dinner-table?"</p>

<p>He returned to the fireplace, seeming appeased, at least infinitesimally,
by this thought. "There wouldn't even be that, except for the
mystery. It's only because I'm mysterious to them&mdash;the way a man
always thinks the girl he doesn't know is prettier than the one
he's with. What's that got to do with acting? What is acting,
anyhow?" His voice rose passionately again. "I'll tell you one
thing it is: It's the most sordid profession in this devilish
world!"</p>

<p>He strode to the centre of the room. "It's at the bottom&mdash;in
the muck! That's where it is. And it ought to be! What am I, out
there on that silly platform they call a stage? A fool, that's
all, making faces, and pretending to be somebody with another
name, for two dollars! A monkey-on-a-stick for the children! Of
course the world despises us! Why shouldn't it? It calls us mummers
and mountebanks, and that's what we are! Buffoons! We aren't men
and women at all&mdash;we're strolling players! We're gypsies! One
of us marries a broker's daughter and her relatives say she's
married 'a damned actor!' That's what they say&mdash;'a damned actor!'
Great heavens, Tinker, can't a man get tired of being called a
'damned actor' without your making all this uproar over it&mdash;squalling
'nerves' in my face till I wish I was dead and done with it!"</p>

<p>He went back to the fireplace again, but omitted another dolorous
stroke upon the mantel. "And look at the women in the profession,"
he continued, as he turned to face his visitors. "My soul! Look
at them! Nothing but sawdust&mdash;sawdust&mdash;sawdust! Do you expect
to go on acting with sawdust? Making sawdust love with sawdust?
Sawdust, I tell you! Sawdust&mdash;sawdust&mdash;saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Tinker easily. "Not all. Not by any means. No."</p>

<p>"Show me one that isn't sawdust!" the tragedian cried fiercely.
"Show me just one!"</p>

<p>"We-ll," said Tinker with extraordinary deliberation, "to start
near home: Wanda Malone."</p>

<p>Potter burst into terrible laughter. "All sawdust! That's why
I discharged her this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You what?" Canby shouted incredulously.</p>

<p>"I dismissed her from my company," said Potter with a startling
change to icy calmness. "I dismissed her from my company this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Old Tinker leaned forward. "You didn't!"</p>

<p>Potter's iciness increased. "Shall I repeat it? I was obliged
to dismiss Miss Wanda Malone from my company, this afternoon,
after rehearsal."</p>

<p>"Why?" Canby gasped.</p>

<p>"Because," said Potter, with the same calmness, "she has an utterly
commonplace mind."</p>

<p>Canby rose in agitation, quite unable, for that moment, to speak;
but Tinker, still leaning forward, gazing intently at the face
of the actor, made a low, long-drawn sound of wonder and affirmation,
the slow exclamation of a man comprehending what amazes him. "So
that's it!"</p>

<p>"Besides being intensely ordinary," said Potter, with superiority,
"I discovered that she is deceitful. That had nothing whatever
to do with my decision to leave the stage." He whirled upon Tinker
suddenly, and shouted: "No matter what you think!"</p>

<p>"No," said Tinker. "No matter."</p>

<p>Potter laughed. "Talbot Potter leaves the stage because a little
'ingenue' understudy tries to break the rules of his company!
Likely, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Looks so," said old Tinker.</p>

<p>"Does it?" retorted Potter with rising fury. "Then I'll tell
you, since you seem not to know it, that I'm not going to leave
the stage! Can't a man give vent to his feelings once in his life
without being caught up and held to it by every old school-teacher
that's stumbled into the 'show-business' by mistake! We're going
right on with this play, I tell you; we rehearse it to-morrow
morning just the same as if this hadn't happened. Only there will
be a new 'ingenue' in Miss Malone's place. People can't break
iron rules in my company. Maybe they could in Mounet-Sully's,
but they can't in mine!"</p>

<p>"What rule did she break?" Canby's voice was unsteady. "What
rule?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Tinker urged. "Tell us what it was."</p>

<p>"After rehearsal," the star began with dignity, "I was &mdash;<em>I&mdash;"
</em>He paused. "I was disappointed in her."</p>

<p>"Ye-es?" drawled Tinker encouragingly.</p>

<p>Potter sent him a vicious glance, but continued: "I had hopes
of her intelligence&mdash;as an actress. She seemed to have, also,
a fairly attractive personality. I felt some little&mdash;ah, interest
in her, personally. There is something about her that&mdash;" Again
he paused. "I talked to her&mdash;about her part&mdash;at length; and finally
<em>I&mdash;</em>ah&mdash;said I should be glad to walk home with her, as
it was after dark. She said no, she wouldn't let me take so much
trouble, because she lived almost at the other end of Brooklyn.
It seemed to me that&mdash;ah, she is very young&mdash;you both probably
noticed that&mdash;so I said I would&mdash;that is, I offered to drive her
home in a taxicab. She thanked me, but said she couldn't. She
kept saying that she was sorry, but she couldn't. It seemed very
peculiar, and, in fact, I insisted. I asked her if she objected
to me as an escort, and she said, 'Oh, no!' and got more and more
embarrassed. I wanted to know what was the matter and why she
couldn't seem to like&mdash;that is, I talked very kindly to her, very
kindly indeed. Nobody could have been kinder!" He cleared his
throat loudly and firmly, with an angry look at Tinker. "I say
nobody could have been kinder to an obscure member of the company
that I was to Miss Malone. But I was decided. That's all. That's
all there was to it. I was merely kind. That's all." He waved
his hand as in dismissal of the subject.</p>

<p>"All?" repeated Canby. "All? You haven't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Potter seemed surprised at his own omission. "Oh,
yes. Right in the midst of&mdash;of what I was saying&mdash;she blurted
out that she couldn't let me take her home, because 'Lancelot'
was waiting for her at a corner drug-store."</p>

<p>"Lancelot!" There was a catch of dismay in Canby's outcry.</p>

<p>"That's what I said, 'Lancelot'!" cried Potter, more desolately
than he intended. "It seems they've been meeting after rehearsal,
in their damn corner drug-store. Lancelot!" His voice rose in
fury. "If I'd known I had a man named Lancelot in my company I'd
have discharged him long ago! If I'd known it was his name I'd
have shot him. 'Lancelot!' He came sneaking in there just after
she'd blundered it all out to me. Got uneasy because she didn't
come, and came to see what was the matter. Naturally, I discharged
them both, on the spot! I've never had a rule of my company broken
yet&mdash;and I never will! He didn't say a word. He didn't dare."</p>

<p>"Who?" shouted Canby and old Tinker together.</p>

<p>"Lancelot!" said Potter savagely.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Packer! His first name's Lancelot, the hypocrite! L. Smith Packer!
She's Mrs. Packer! They were married two days before rehearsals
began. She's Mrs. L. Smith Packer!"</p>
