But for two of us the adventures of the night were not yet over. 
Silence settled down over the old house--the eerie, whisperful,
creeping silence of night.  Felix and Dan were already sound
asleep; I was drifting near the coast o' dreams when I was aroused
by a light tap on the door.
<P>
"Bev, are you asleep?" came in the Story Girl's whisper.
<P>
"No, what is it?"
<P>
"S-s-h.  Get up and dress and come out.  I want you."
<P>
With a good deal of curiosity and some misgiving I obeyed.  What
was in the wind now?  Outside in the hall I found the Story Girl,
with a candle in her hand, and her hat and jacket.
<P>
"Where are you going?" I whispered in amazement.
<P>
"Hush.  I've got to go to the school and you must come with me.  I
left my coral necklace there.  The clasp came loose and I was so
afraid I'd lose it that I took it off and put it in the bookcase. 
I was feeling so upset when the concert was over that I forgot all
about it."
<P>
The coral necklace was a very handsome one which had belonged to
the Story Girl's mother.  She had never been permitted to wear it
before, and it had only been by dint of much coaxing that she had
induced Aunt Janet to let her wear it to the concert.
<P>
"But there's no sense in going for it in the dead of night," I
objected.  "It will be quite safe.  You can go for it in the
morning."
<P>
"Lizzie Paxton and her daughter are going to clean the school
tomorrow, and I heard Lizzie say tonight she meant to be at it by
five o'clock to get through before the heat of the day.  You know
perfectly well what Liz Paxton's reputation is.  If she finds that
necklace I'll never see it again.  Besides, if I wait till the
morning, Aunt Janet may find out that I left it there and she'd
never let me wear it again.  No, I'm going for it now.  If you're
afraid," added the Story Girl with delicate scorn, "of course you
needn't come."
<P>
Afraid!  I'd show her!
<P>
"Come on," I said.
<P>
We slipped out of the house noiselessly and found ourselves in the
unutterable solemnity and strangeness of a dark night.  It was a
new experience, and our hearts thrilled and our nerves tingled to
the charm of it.  Never had we been abroad before at such an hour. 
The world around us was not the world of daylight.  'Twas an alien
place, full of weird, evasive enchantment and magicry.
<P>
Only in the country can one become truly acquainted with the
night.  There it has the solemn calm of the infinite.  The dim
wide fields lie in silence, wrapped in the holy mystery of
darkness.  A wind, loosened from wild places far away, steals out
to blow over dewy, star-lit, immemorial hills.  The air in the
pastures is sweet with the hush of dreams, and one may rest here
like a child on its mother's breast.
<P>
"Isn't it wonderful?" breathed the Story Girl as we went down the
long hill.  "Do you know, I can forgive Sara Ray now.  I thought
tonight I never could--but now it doesn't matter any more.  I can
even see how funny it was.  Oh, wasn't it funny?  'DEAD' in that
squeaky little voice of Sara's!  I'll just behave to her tomorrow
as if nothing had happened.  It seems so long ago now, here in the
night."
<P>
Neither of us ever forgot the subtle delight of that stolen walk. 
A spell of glamour was over us.  The breezes whispered strange
secrets of elf-haunted glens, and the hollows where the ferns grew
were brimmed with mystery and romance.  Ghostlike scents crept out
of the meadows to meet us, and the fir wood before we came to the
church was a living sweetness of Junebells growing in abundance.
<P>
Junebells have another and more scientific name, of course.  But
who could desire a better name than Junebells?  They are so perfect
in their way that they seem to epitomize the very scent and charm
of the forest, as if the old wood's daintiest thoughts had
materialized in blossom; and not all the roses by Bendameer's
stream are as fragrant as a shallow sheet of Junebells under the
boughs of fir.
<P>
There were fireflies abroad that night, too, increasing the
gramarye of it.  There is certainly something a little
supernatural about fireflies.  Nobody pretends to understand them. 
They are akin to the tribes of fairy, survivals of the elder time
when the woods and hills swarmed with the little green folk.  It
is still very easy to believe in fairies when you see those goblin
lanterns glimmering among the fir tassels.
<P>
"Isn't it beautiful?" said the Story Girl in rapture.  "I wouldn't
have missed it for anything.  I'm glad I left my necklace.  And I
am glad you are with me, Bev.  The others wouldn't understand so
well.  I like you because I don't have to talk to you all the
time.  It's so nice to walk with someone you don't have to talk
to.  Here is the graveyard.  Are you frightened to pass it, Bev?"
<P>
"No, I don't think I'm frightened," I answered slowly, "but I have
a queer feeling."
<P>
"So have I.  But it isn't fear.  I don't know what it is.  I feel
as if something was reaching out of the graveyard to hold me--
something that wanted life--I don't like it--let's hurry.  But
isn't it strange to think of all the dead people in there who were
once alive like you and me.  I don't feel as if I could EVER die. 
Do you?"
<P>
"No, but everybody must.  Of course we go on living afterwards,
just the same.  Don't let's talk of such things here," I said
hurriedly.
<P>
When we reached the school I contrived to open a window.  We
scrambled in, lighted a lamp and found the missing necklace.  The
Story Girl stood on the platform and gave an imitation of the
catastrophe of the evening that made me shout with laughter.  We
prowled around for sheer delight over being there at an unearthly
hour when everybody supposed we were sound asleep in our beds.  It
was with regret that we left, and we walked home as slowly as we
could to prolong the adventure.
<P>
"Let's never tell anyone," said the Story Girl, as we reached
home.  "Let's just have it as a secret between us for ever and
ever--something that nobody else knows a thing about but you and
me."
<P>
"We'd better keep it a secret from Aunt Janet anyhow," I
whispered, laughing.  "She'd think we were both crazy."
<P>
"It's real jolly to be crazy once in a while," said the Story
Girl.
