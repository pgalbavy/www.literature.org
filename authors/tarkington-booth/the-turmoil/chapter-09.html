<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Through the open country Bibbs was borne flying between brown
fields and sun-flecked groves of gray trees, to breathe the rushing,
clean air beneath a glorious sky&mdash;that sky so despised in the
city, and so maltreated there, that from early October to mid-May
it was impossible for men to remember that blue is the rightful
color overhead.</p>

<p>Upon each of Bibbs's cheeks there was a hint of something almost
resembling a pinkishness; not actual color, but undeniably its
phantom. How largely this apparition may have been the work of
the wind upon his face it is difficult to calculate, for beyond
a doubt it was partly the result of a lady's bowing to him upon
no more formal introduction than the circumstance of his having
caught her looking into his window a month before. She had bowed
definitely; she had bowed charmingly. And it seemed to Bibbs that
she must have meant to convey her forgiveness.</p>

<p>There had been something in her recognition of him unfamiliar
to his experience, and he rode the warmer for it. Nor did he lack
the impression that he would long remember her as he had just
seen her: her veil tumultuously blowing back, her face glowing
in the wind&mdash;and that look of gay friendliness tossed to him like
a fresh rose in carnival.</p>

<p>By and by, upon a rising ground, the driver halted the car, then
backed and tacked, and sent it forward again with its nose to
the south and the smoke. Far before him Bibbs saw the great smudge
upon the horizon, that nest of cloud in which the city strove
and panted like an engine shrouded in its own steam. But to Bibbs,
who had now to go to the very heart of it, for a commanded interview
with his father, the distant cloud was like an implacable genius
issuing thunderously in smoke from his enchanted bottle, and irresistibly
drawing Bibbs nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>They passed from the farm lands, and came, in the amber light
of November late afternoon, to the farthermost outskirts of the
city; and here the sky shimmered upon the verge of change from
blue to gray; the smoke did not visibly permeate the air, but
it was there, nevertheless&mdash;impalpable, thin, no more than the
dust of smoke. And then, as the car drove on, the chimneys and
stacks of factories came swimming up into view like miles of steamers
advancing abreast, every funnel with its vast plume, savage and
black, sweeping to the horizon, dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation
over league on league already rich and vile with grime.</p>

<p>The sky had become only a dingy thickening of the soiled air;
and a roar and clangor of metals beat deafeningly on Bibbs's ears.
And now the car passed two great blocks of long brick buildings,
hideous in all ways possible to make them hideous; doorways showing
dark one moment and lurid the next with the leap of some virulent
interior flame, revealing blackened giants, half naked, in passionate
action, struggling with formless things in the hot illumination.
And big as these shops were, they were growing bigger, spreading
over a third block, where two new structures were mushrooming
to completion in some hasty cement process of a stability not
over-reassuring. Bibbs pulled the rug closer about him, and not
even the phantom of color was left upon his cheeks as he passed
this place, for he knew it too well. Across the face of one of
the buildings there was an enormous sign: "Sheridan Automatic
Pump Co., Inc."</p>

<p>Thence they went through streets of wooden houses, all grimed,
and adding their own grime from many a sooty chimney; flimsey
wooden houses of a thousand flimsy whimsies in the fashioning,
built on narrow lots and nudging one another crossly, shutting
out the stingy sunlight from one another; bad neighbors who would
destroy one another root and branch some night when the right
wind blew. They were only waiting for that wind and a cigarette,
and then they would all be gone together&mdash;a pinch of incense burned
upon the tripod of the god.</p>

<p>Along these streets there were skinny shade-trees, and here and
there a forest elm or walnut had been left; but these were dying.
Some people said it was the scale; some said it was the smoke;
and some were sure that asphalt and "improving" the streets did
it; but Bigness was in too Big a hurry to bother much about trees.
He had telegraph-poles and telephone-poles and electric-light-poles
and trolley-poles by the thousand to take their places. So he
let the trees die and put up his poles. They were hideous, but
nobody minded that; and sometimes the wires fell and killed people&mdash;but
not often enough to matter at all.</p>

<p>Thence onward the car bore Bibbs through the older parts of the
town where the few solid old houses not already demolished were
in transition: some, with their fronts torn away, were being made
into segments of apartment-buildings; others had gone uproariously
into trade, brazenly putting forth "show-windows" on their first
floors, seeming to mean it for a joke; one or two with unaltered
facades peeped humorously over the tops of temporary office buildings
of one story erected in the old front yards. Altogether, the town
here was like a boarding-house hash the Sunday after Thanksgiving;
the old ingredients were discernible.</p>

<p>This was the fringe of Bigness's own sanctuary, and now Bibbs
reached the roaring holy of holies itself. The car must stop at
every crossing while the dark-garbed crowds, enveloped in maelstroms
of dust, hurried before it. Magnificent new buildings, already
dingy, loomed hundreds of feet above him; newer ones, more magnificent,
were rising beside them, rising higher; old buildings were coming
down; middle-aged buildings were coming down; the streets were
laid open to their entrails and men worked underground between
palisades, and overhead in metal cobwebs like spiders in the sky.
Trolley-cars and long interurban cars, built to split the wind
like torpedo-boats, clanged and shrieked their way round swarming
corners; motor-cars of every kind and shape known to man babbled
frightful warnings and frantic demands; hospital ambulances clamored
wildly for passage; steam-whistles signaled the swinging of titanic
tentacle and claw; riveters rattled like machine-guns; the ground
shook to the thunder of gigantic trucks; and the conglomerate
sound of it all was the sound of earthquake playing accompaniments
for battle and sudden death. On one of the new steel buildings
no work was being done that afternoon. The building had killed
a man in the morning&mdash;and the steel-workers always stop for the
day when that "happens."</p>

<p>And in the hurrying crowds, swirling and sifting through the
brobdingnagian camp of iron and steel, one saw the camp-followers
and the pagan women&mdash;there would be work to-day and dancing to-night.
For the Puritan's dry voice is but the crackling of a leaf underfoot
in the rush and roar of the coming of the new Egypt.</p>

<p>Bibbs was on time. He knew it must be "to the minute" or his
father would consider it an outrage; and the big chronometer in
Sheridan's office marked four precisely when Bibbs walked in.
Coincidentally with his entrance five people who had been at work
in the office, under Sheridan's direction, walked out. They departed
upon no visible or audible suggestion, and with a promptness that
seemed ominous to the new-comer. As the massive door clicked softly
behind the elderly stenographer, the last of the procession, Bibbs
had a feeling that they all understood that he was a failure as
a great man's son, a disappointment, the "queer one" of the family,
and that he had been summoned to judgment&mdash;a well-founded impression,
for that was exactly what they understood.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Sheridan.</p>

<p>It is frequently an advantage for deans, school-masters, and
worried fathers to place delinquents in the sitting-posture. Bibbs
sat.</p>

<p>Sheridan, standing, gazed enigmatically upon his son for a period
of silence, then walked slowly to a window and stood looking out
of it, his big hands, loosely hooked together by the thumbs, behind
his back. They were soiled, as were all other hands down-town,
except such as might be still damp from a basin.</p>

<p>"Well, Bibbs," he said at last, not altering his attitude, "do
you know what I'm goin' to do with you?"</p>

<p>Bibbs, leaning back in his chair, fixed his eyes contemplatively
upon the ceiling. "I heard you tell Jim," he began, in his slow
way. "You said you'd send him to the machine-shop with me if he
didn't propose to Miss Vertrees. So I suppose that must be your
plan for me. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?" said Sheridan, irritably, as the son paused.</p>

<p>"Isn't there somebody you'd let ME propose to?"</p>

<p>That brought his father sharply round to face him. "You beat
the devil! Bibbs, what IS the matter with you? Why can't you be
like anybody else?"</p>

<p>"Liver, maybe," said Bibbs, gently.</p>

<p>"Boh! Even ole Doc Gurney says there's nothin' wrong with you
organically. No. You're a dreamer, Bibbs; that's what's the matter,
and that's <em>ALL </em>the matter. Oh, not one o' these <em>BIG
</em>dreamers that put through the big deals! No, sir! You're
the kind o' dreamer that just sets out on the back fence and thinks
about how much trouble there must be in the world! That ain't
the kind that builds the bridges, Bibbs; it's the kind that borrows
fifteen cents from his wife's uncle's brother-in-law to get ten
cent's worth o' plug tobacco and a nickel's worth o' quinine!"</p>

<p>He put the finishing touch on this etching with a snort, and
turned again to the window.</p>

<p>"Look out there!" he bade his son. "Look out o' that window!
Look at the life and energy down there! I should think <em>ANY
</em>young man's blood would tingle to get into it and be part
of it. Look at the big things young men are doin' in this town!"
He swung about, coming to the mahogany desk in the middle of the
room. "Look at what I was doin' at your age! Look at what your
own brothers are doin'! Look at Roscoe! Yes, and look at Jim!
I made Jim president o' the Sheridan Realty Company last New-Year's,
with charge of every inch o' ground and every brick and every
shingle and stick o' wood we own; and it's an example to any young
man&mdash;or ole man, either&mdash;the way he took ahold of it. Last July
we found out we wanted two more big warehouses at the Pump Works&mdash;wanted
'em quick. Contractors said it couldn't be done; said nine or
ten months at the soonest; couldn't see it any other way. What'd
Jim do? Took the contract himself; found a fellow with a new cement
and concrete process; kept men on the job night and day, and stayed
on it night and day himself&mdash;and, by George! we begin to <em>USE
</em>them warehouses next week! Four months and a half, and every
inch fireproof! I tell you Jim's one o' these fellers that make
miracles happen! Now, I don't say every young man can be like
Jim, because there's mighty few got his ability, but every young
man can go in and do his share. This town is God's own country,
and there's opportunity for anybody with a pound of energy and
an ounce o' gumption. I tell you these young business men I watch
just do my heart good! <em>THEY </em>don't set around on the back
fence&mdash;no, sir! They take enough exercise to keep their health;
and they go to a baseball game once or twice a week in summer,
maybe, and they're raisin' nice families, with sons to take their
places sometime and carry on the work&mdash;because the work's got
to go ON! They're puttin' their life-blood into it, I tell you,
and that's why we're gettin' bigger every minute, and why <em>THEY'RE
</em>gettin' bigger, and why it's all goin' to keep ON gettin'
bigger!"</p>

<p>He slapped the desk resoundingly with his open palm, and then,
observing that Bibbs remained in the same impassive attitude,
with his eyes still fixed upon the ceiling in a contemplation
somewhat plaintive, Sheridan was impelled to groan. "Oh, Lord!"
he said. "This is the way you always were. I don't believe you
understood a darn word I been sayin'! You don't <em>LOOK </em>as
if you did. By George! it's discouraging!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand about getting&mdash;about getting bigger," said
Bibbs, bringing his gaze down to look at his father placatively.
"I don't see just why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT?" </em>Sheridan leaned forward, resting his hands upon
the desk and staring across it incredulously at his son.</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;exactly&mdash;what you want it all bigger for?"</p>

<p>"Great God!" shouted Sheridan, and struck the desk a blow with
his clenched fist. "A son of mine asks me that! You go out and
ask the poorest day-laborer you can find! Ask him that question&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did once," Bibbs interrupted; "when I was in the machine-shop.
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wha'd he say?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'Oh, hell!'" answered Bibbs, mildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon he would!" Sheridan swung away from the desk.
"I reckon he certainly would! And I got plenty sympathy with him
right now, myself!"</p>

<p>"It's the same answer, then?" Bibbs's voice was serious, almost
tremulous.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" Sheridan roared. "Did you ever hear the word Prosperity,
you ninny? Did you ever hear the word Ambition? Did you ever hear
the word <em>PROGRESS</em>?"</p>

<p>He flung himself into a chair after the outburst, his big chest
surging, his throat tumultuous with gutteral incoherences. "Now
then," he said, huskily, when the anguish had somewhat abated,
"what do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"What do you <em>WANT </em>to do, I said."</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Bibbs stammered. "What&mdash;what do &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I'd let you do exactly what you had the whim for, what would
you do?"</p>

<p>Bibbs looked startled; then timidity overwhelmed him&mdash;a profound
shyness. He bent his head and fixed his lowered eyes upon the
toe of his shoe, which he moved to and fro upon the rug, like
a culprit called to the desk in school.</p>

<p>"What would you do? Loaf?"</p>

<p>"No, sir." Bibbs's voice was almost inaudible, and what little
sound it made was unquestionably a guilty sound. "I suppose I'd
&mdash;I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'd try to&mdash;to write."</p>

<p>"Write what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing important&mdash;just poems and essays, perhaps."</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I see," said his father, breathing quickly with the restraint
he was putting upon himself. "That is, you want to write, but
you don't want to write anything of any account."</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheridan got up again. "I take my hat off to the man that can
write a good ad," he said, emphatically. "The best writin' talent
in this country is right spang in the ad business to-day. You
buy a magazine for good writin'&mdash;look on the back of it! Let me
tell you I pay money for that kind o' writin'. Maybe you think
it's easy. Just try it! I've tried it, and I can't do it. I tell
you an ad's got to be written so it makes people do the hardest
thing in this world to <em>GET '</em>em to do: it's got to make
'em give up their <em>MONEY! </em>You talk about 'poems and essays.'
I tell you when it comes to the actual skill o' puttin' words
together so as to make things <em>HAPPEN, R. T. </em>Bloss, right
here in this city, knows more in a minute than George Waldo Emerson
ever knew in his whole life!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you may be&mdash;" Bibbs said, indistinctly, the last word smothered
in a cough.</p>

<p>"Of <em>COURSE I'</em>m right! And if it ain't just like you
to want to take up with the most out-o'-date kind o' writin' there
is! 'Poems and essays'! My Lord, Bibbs, that's <em>WOMEN'S </em>work!
You can't pick up a newspaper without havin' to see where Mrs.
Rumskididle read a paper on 'Jane Eyre,' or 'East Lynne,' at the
God-Knows-What Club. And 'poetry'! Why, look at Edith! I expect
that poem o' hers would set a pretty high-water mark for you,
young man, and it's the only one she's ever managed to write in
her whole <em>LIFE! </em>When I wanted her to go on and write
some more she said it took too much time. Said it took months
and months. And Edith's a smart girl; she's got more energy in
her little finger than you ever give me a chance to see in your
whole body, Bibbs. Now look at the facts: say she could turn out
four or five poems a year and you could turn out maybe two. That
medal she got was worth about fifteen dollars, so there's your
income&mdash;thirty dollars a year! That's a fine success to make of
your life! I'm not sayin' a word against poetry. I wouldn't take
ten thousand dollars right now for that poem of Edith's; and poetry's
all right enough in its place&mdash;but you leave it to the girls.
A man's got to do a man's work in this world!"</p>

<p>He seated himself in a chair at his son's side and, leaning over,
tapped Bibbs confidentially on the knee. "This city's got the
greatest future in America, and if my sons behave right by me
and by themselves they're goin' to have a mighty fair share of
it&mdash;a mighty fair share. I love this town. It's God's own footstool,
and it's made money for me every day right along, I don't know
how many years. I love it like I do my own business, and I'd fight
for it as quick as I'd fight for my own family. It's a beautiful
town. Look at our wholesale district; look at any district you
want to; look at the park system we're puttin' through, and the
boulevards and the public statuary. And she grows. God! how she
grows!" He had become intensely grave; he spoke with solemnity.
"Now, Bibbs, I can't take any of it&mdash;nor any gold or silver nor
buildings nor bonds&mdash;away with me in my shroud when I have to
go. But I want to leave my share in it to my boys. I've worked
for it; I've been a builder and a maker; and two blades of grass
have grown where one grew before, whenever I laid my hand on the
ground and willed 'em to grow. I've built big, and I want the
buildin' to go on. And when my last hour comes I want to know
that my boys are ready to take charge; that they're fit to take
charge and go ON with it. Bibbs, when that hour comes I want to
know that my boys are big men, ready and fit to hold of big things.
Bibbs, when I'm up above I want to know that the big share I've
made mine, here below, is growin' bigger and bigger in the charge
of my boys."</p>

<p>He leaned back, deeply moved. "There!" he said, huskily. "I've
never spoken more what was in my heart in my life. I do it because
I want you to understand&mdash;and not think me a mean father. I never
had to talk that way to Jim and Roscoe. They understood without
any talk, Bibbs."</p>

<p>"I see," said Bibbs. "At least I think I do. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" Sheridan raised his hand. "If you see the least
bit in the world, then you understand how it feels to me to have
my son set here and talk about 'poems and essays' and such-like
fooleries. And you must understand, too, what it meant to start
one o' my boys and have him come back on me the way you did, and
have to be sent to a sanitarium because he couldn't stand work.
Now, let's get right down to it, Bibbs. I've had a whole lot o'
talk with ole Doc Gurney about you, one time another, and I reckon
I understand your case just about as well as he does, anyway!
Now here, I'll be frank with you. I started you in harder than
what I did the other boys, and that was for your own good, because
I saw you needed to be shook up more'n they did. You were always
kind of moody and mopish&mdash;and you needed work that'd keep you
on the jump. Now, why did it make you sick instead of brace you
up and make a man of you the way it ought of done? I pinned ole
Gurney down to it. I says, 'Look here, ain't it really because
he just plain hated it?' 'Yes,' he says, 'that's it. If he'd enjoyed
it, it wouldn't 'a' hurt him. He loathes it, and that affects
his nervous system. The more he tries it, the more he hates it;
and the more he hates it, the more injury it does him.' That ain't
quite his words, but it's what he meant. And that's about the
way it is."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bibbs, "that's about the way it is."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I reckon it's up to me not only to make you do it,
but to make you like it!"</p>

<p>Bibbs shivered. And he turned upon his father a look that was
almost ghostly. "I can't," he said, in a low voice. "I can't."</p>

<p>"Can't go back to the shop?"</p>

<p>"No. Can't like it. I can't."</p>

<p>Sheridan jumped up, his patience gone. To his own view, he had
reasoned exhaustively, had explained fully and had pleaded more
than a father should, only to be met in the end with the unreasoning
and mysterious stubbornness which had been Bibbs's baffling characteristic
from childhood. "By George, you will!" he cried. "You'll go back
there and you'll like it! Gurney says it won't hurt you if you
like it, and he says it'll kill you if you go back and hate it;
so it looks as if it was about up to you not to hate it. Well,
Gurney's a fool! Hatin' work doesn't kill anybody; and this isn't
goin' to kill you, whether you hate it or not. I've never made
a mistake in a serious matter in my life, and it wasn't a mistake
my sendin' you there in the first place. And I'm goin' to prove
it &mdash;I'm goin' to send you back there and vindicate my judgment.
Gurney says it's all 'mental attitude.' Well, you're goin' to
learn the right one! He says in a couple more months this fool
thing that's been the matter with you'll be disappeared completely
and you'll be back in as good or better condition than you were
before you ever went into the shop. And right then is when you
begin over&mdash;right in that same shop! Nobody can call me a hard
man or a mean father. I do the best I can for my chuldern, and
I take full responsibility for bringin' my sons up to be men.
Now, so far, I've failed with you. But I'm not goin' to keep ON
failin'. I never tackled a job <em>YET I </em>didn't put through,
and I'm not goin' to begin with my own son. I'm goin' to make
a <em>MAN </em>of you. By God! I am!"</p>

<p>Bibbs rose and went slowly to the door, where he turned. "You
say you give me a couple of months?" he said.</p>

<p>Sheridan pushed a bell-button on his desk. "Gurney said two months
more would put you back where you were. You go home and begin
to get yourself in the right 'mental attitude' before those two
months are up! Good-by!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, sir," said Bibbs, meekly.</p>
