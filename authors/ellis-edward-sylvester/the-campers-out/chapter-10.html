<p>The stage was within a hundred yards of Black Bear Swamp when
something like a tornado struck it. The horses stopped, and the
vehicle was partly lifted from the ground. For an instant it seemed
to be going over. The driver and the New Englander started with
suppressed exclamations, while Wagstaff emitted a cry of alarm,
as he and his companion attempted to leap out.</p>

<p>"Sit still! you’re all right!" shouted Lenman, striking his horses
with the whip. They broke into a trot, and a few minutes later
entered the dense wood, where they were safe from the danger that
threatened them a moment before. Indeed, the volley of wind was
as brief as a discharge of musketry, passing instantly, though
it still howled through the wood, with a dismal effect, which
made all heartily wish they were somewhere else.</p>

<p>It was so dark that, but for the flashes of lightning, the passengers
would have been unable to see each other’s forms; but the horses
were so familiar with the route that they needed no guidance.
The driver allowed them to walk, while he held the lines taut
to check them on the instant it might be necessary.</p>

<p>Wagstaff and McGovern climbed forward, and crowded themselves
on the seat beside the New Englander, each firmly grasping his
rifle, for, as they advanced into the wood, their thoughts were
of the criminal who they believed would challenge them before
they could reach the other side.</p>

<p>Still the rain held off, though the lightning was almost incessant
and continually showed the way in front. The wind, too, abated,
and all began to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>"I guess the robber won’t dare show himself to-night," said Wagstaff,
speaking rather his wish than his belief.</p>

<p>"What’s to hinder him?" asked Ethan Durrell.</p>

<p>"The storm."</p>

<p>The driver laughed outright.</p>

<p>"It’s just what is in his favor—hulloa!"</p>

<p>"Gracious! what’s the matter?" gasped Wagstaff, as the team suddenly
halted, of their own accord; "let’s get out."</p>

<p>"Something’s wrong," replied Lenman; "don’t speak or make any
noise; we’ll soon know what it is."</p>

<p>While waiting for the flash of lightning to illuminate the gloom,
it never seemed so long coming. A short time before the gleams
were continuous, but now the gloom was like that of Egypt as the
seconds dragged along.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but all eyes were fixed on the impenetrable darkness
in front, while every ear was strained to catch some sound beside
the soughing of the wind among the trees.</p>

<p>All at once, as if the overwhelming storehouse of electricity
could contain itself no longer, the whole space around, in front
and above was lit up by one dazzling flame, which revealed everything
with the vividness of a thousand noonday suns.</p>

<p>By its overpowering glare the figure of a man on horseback was
seen motionless in the middle of the road, less than twenty feet
distant. He knew of the presence of some one in his path, and
he, too, was awaiting the help of the lightning before advancing.</p>

<p>"That’s <em>him</em>,’" whispered Tom Wagstaff; "shall we shoot?"</p>

<p>Ethan Durrell felt the seat tremble under the youth, while the
others noticed the quaver in his voice.</p>

<p>"No," replied the driver; "he hasn’t done nothin’ yet; wait till
he hails us."</p>

<p>"That may be too late, but all right."</p>

<p>"Helloa, Bill, is that you?" came from the horseman.</p>

<p>"Yes; who are you?" called back the driver.</p>

<p>"Don’t you know me, Hank Babcock?" called the other, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I sort of thought it was you, Hank, but wasn’t sure."</p>

<p>"You can be sure of it now; wait a minute till I get out of your
way; I’ll turn aside and let you pass."</p>

<p>Everything was quiet for a moment, except the wind, the snuffing
of his horse, and the sound of his hoofs, as he was forced with
some trouble close to the trees which grew near the highway.</p>

<p>"Now, it’s all right; go ahead," called Hank Babcock.</p>

<p>Lenman spoke to his animals and they moved forward. When opposite
the horseman, another flash revealed him sitting astride the animal,
a few feet to one side. He called a cheery good-night as he drew
back, after the stage had passed, and continued his course.</p>

<p>"Driver," said Wagstaff, when they were moving again; "where
is the spot you thought it likely we would meet him?"</p>

<p>"We’re close to it now; you notice the road goes down a little,
but not enough for me to put on the brake; have your shootin’
irons ready, for, somehow or other, I feel in my bones that you’ll
need ’em."</p>

<p>"Where’s that chap that was here a minute ago?" asked Jim, with
as much tremor in his voice as his friend.</p>

<p>"Who’s that?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"That Yankee that was sitting right here; he’s gone!"</p>

<p>"I guess not," replied the driver, reaching back his hand and
groping vaguely around; "he must be there."</p>

<p>"He isn’t; he was here, but he’s missing."</p>

<p>"Maybe he got so scared he took the back seat," suggested Tom,
who held his rifle in his left hand, while he passed his right
through the vacancy in the rear of the stage; "no, I’ll be hanged
if he is there; he isn’t in the stage."</p>

<p>"That’s mighty queer," remarked the driver; "I didn’t hear him
get out, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I felt him; he was sitting right alongside of us, when
something brushed past me and he was gone—there!"</p>

<p>Once more the lightning brought everything out with intense distinctness,
and all saw that there were only three instead of four persons
in the stage.</p>

<p>The New Englander was missing: what had become of him?</p>

<p>"I guess he was scared," suggested Wagstaff, with a weak attempt
to screw up his courage; "and preferred to hide among the trees
rather than run the risk of meeting that stranger—"</p>

<p>"<em>Sh!</em>" interrupted the driver, "there’s somebody ahead
of us in the road; the horses see him; be ready and remember that
if you miss it’s sure death—"</p>

<p>At that moment the most startling cry that could fall upon their
ears rang from the gloom in front:</p>

<p>"<em>Hands up, every one of you!</em>"</p>
