<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>After that Peace came often to the handsome stone house, half
hidden from the road by its thick hedges and giant trees. Almost
daily the white cloth fluttered its summons from the lilac bushes,
and Elizabeth, having heard the sad story of the young girl mistress,
rejoiced that the tumble-haired, merry-hearted little romp could
bring even a gleam of sunshine into that darkened life.</p>

<p>At first it was the great, beautiful gardens which lured the
child through the iron gates, for she could not understand the
different moods of the imperious young invalid, and secretly stood
somewhat in awe of her. But gradually the natural childish vivacity
and quaint philosophy of the smaller maid tore down the barriers
behind which the older girl had so long screened herself, and
Peace found to her great amazement that the white-faced invalid,
who could never leave her chair again, was a wonderful story-teller
and a perfect witch at inventing new games and planning delightful
surprises to make each visit a real event for this guest. So the
calls grew more and more frequent and the chance acquaintance
blossomed into a deep, tender friendship.</p>

<p>Of course, Peace did not realize how much sweetness and sunshine
she was bringing into the garden with her, but in her ignorance
supposed that the many visits were all for her own happiness.
How could she know that her lively prattle was making the weary
days bearable for the frail sufferer? And had anyone tried to
tell her what an important part she was playing in that life drama,
she would not have believed it. Perhaps it was the very unconsciousness
of her power which made her such a beautiful comrade for the aching
heart imprisoned in the garden. At any rate, Peace not only made
friends with the lonely Lilac Lady, but she also captivated gentle
Aunt Pen and the adoring Hicks, who met her with beaming faces
whenever she entered the garden, and sighed when the brief hours
were over. But none of them would listen to her bringing Elspeth
or the minister, much to her bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It isn't because <em>I</em> don't want them," explained Aunt
Pen one day when Peace had pleaded with her and had been grieved
at her refusal. "Your Lilac Lady isn't ready to receive other
callers yet. You can't understand now, dearie. God grant you may
<em>never</em> understand. She shut herself up four years ago
when she found out that she would never get well enough to walk
again, and you are the first person she has ever seen since that
time, except her own household and the physician. Perhaps you
are the opening wedge, child. Oh, I trust it may be so!"</p>

<p>Peace did not understand what an opening wedge was, but it did
not sound very appetizing, and she had grave doubts as to whether
she had better continue her visits under such conditions. But
when she went to Elizabeth with the story, that wise little woman
answered her by singing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Slightest actions often<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet the sorest needs,<br/>
For the world wants daily,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little kindly deeds;<br/>
Oh, what care and sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may help remove,<br/>
With your songs and courage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sympathy and love.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Peace was comforted and went back to the shady garden with a
deeper desire to brighten the long, dreary, aimless days of the
helpless invalid. She said no more about introducing her beloved
minister's family, but in secret she still mourned because the
lame girl so steadfastly refused to welcome her dearest friends.</p>

<p>So the days flew swiftly by and the month of May was gone. Summer
was early that year, and the first day of June dawned sultry and
still over the sweltering city. It was a half-holiday at the Chestnut
School, so Peace returned home at noon, hot, perspiring, but radiant
at the thought of no more lessons till the morrow. She came a
round-about way in order to pass the great gates of the stone
mansion, hoping to catch a glimpse of the well-known chair under
the lilac bushes; but the lawn was deserted, and she was disappointed,
for she had counted much on spending these unexpected leisure
hours in the cool garden with the lame girl.</p>

<p>To add to her woe, she found Elizabeth lying on the couch in
the darkened study, suffering from a nerve-racking headache, and
the preacher, looking very droll togged out in his little wife's
kitchen-apron, was flying about serving up the scorched, unseasoned
dinner for the forlorn family. He was too much concerned over
the illness of the mistress and the unfinished condition of his
next Sunday's sermon to sample his own cooking, and as Glen fell
asleep over his bowl of bread and milk, Peace was left entirely
to her own devices when the meal was ended.</p>

<p>It was too hot to romp, it was too hot to read, and there was
no one to play with. She swung idly in the hammock until the very
motion was maddening. She prowled through the grove behind the
church, she dug industriously in the small flower garden under
the east window, she did everything she could think of to make
the time pass quickly, but at length threw herself once more into
the hammock with a discouraged sigh.</p>

<p>"School might better have kept all day. It is horrid to stay
home with nothing to do that's int'resting. I've watched all the
afternoon for the Lilac Lady's table-cloth and haven't had a peek
of it yet. But there &mdash;I don't s'pose she'd know there was
only one session today, so she ain't apt to hang it out until
time for school to let out, like she usu'ly does. Guess I'll just
walk over in that d'rection and see if she ain't under the trees
yet. It's been two days since I've seen a glimpse of her. Hicks
says she's been dreadful bad again. P'raps I better take her some
flowers this time&mdash;and there is that little strawberry pie Elspeth
made for my very own. I might take her some sandwiches, too,&mdash;yes,
I'll do it!"</p>

<p>She tiptoed softly into the house, so as not to disturb the two
slumberers, and went in search of the minister in order to lay
her plan before him; but he, too, had fallen asleep and lay sprawled
full length by the open window, beside his half-written manuscript.</p>

<p>"If that ain't just the way!" spluttered Peace under her breath.
"I never did go to tell anyone nice plans but they went to sleep
or were too busy to be disturbed. Well, I'll do it anyway. I know
they won't care a single speck. I'll ask 'em when I get home and
they are awake."</p>

<p>Back to the kitchen she stole, and into the tiny pantry, where
for the next few minutes she industriously cut and buttered bread,
made sandwiches, sliced cake and packed lunch enough for a dozen
in the picnic hamper which she found hanging on a nail in the
shed. With this on her arm, she returned to the little garden
under the window and dug up her choicest flowers, stacked them
in an old shoe-box with plenty of black dirt, as she had often
seen Hicks do, and departed with her luggage for the stone house
across the corner.</p>

<p>She paused at the heavy gates, wondering for the first time whether
or not she would be welcome at this time, when no signal had fluttered
from the lilac bushes, but at sight of the motionless figure under
the largest oak, her doubts vanished, and, boldly opening the
gate, she marched up the gravel path and across the lawn toward
the familiar chair, bearing the lunch-basket on one arm and a
huge box of cheerful-faced pansies on the other.</p>

<p>Hearing the click of the latch and the sound of steps on the
walk, the lame girl frowned impatiently, and without opening her
eyes, said peevishly, "If you have any errand here, go on to the
house. I won't be bothered."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," cried Peace in mournful tones. "I brought a
picnic with me, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big blue eyes flashed wide in surprise, and their owner demanded
sharply, "Why did you come this time of day? I have not sent for
you."</p>

<p>"I didn't say you had. I came 'cause I thought you'd be glad
to see me, but if you ain't, I'll go straight home again and eat
my picnic all alone, and plant my flowers in my garden again.
You don't have to have them if you don't want 'em."</p>

<p>She whirled on her heel and stamped angrily across the grass
toward the gate, too hurt to keep the tears from her eyes, and
too proud to let her companion see how deeply wounded she was.</p>

<p>Astonished at this flash of gunpowder, the lame girl cried contritely,
"Oh, don't go away, Peace! I didn't mean to be cross to you. This
has been <em>such</em> a hard week, dear, I hardly know what I
am doing half the time."</p>

<p>"Is the pain so bad?" whispered Peace tenderly, dropping on her
knees before the sufferer, having already forgotten her own grievance
in her longing to ease and comfort the poor, aching back.</p>

<p>"It is better now," answered the girl, smiling wanly at the sympathetic
face bending over her. "The heat always makes it worse, but I
do believe it is growing cooler now. Feel the breeze? What have
you brought me? A picnic lunch!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;my strawberry pie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Strong know?"</p>

<p>"She made the pie all for my very own self to do just what I
please with. Don't you like strawberry pie?" Peace paused in her
task of unpacking the basket to look up questioningly at the face
among the pillows.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, dear, I am very fond of it, and it is sweet of you
to share yours with me. I shall put my half away for tea."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't do that," protested the ardent little picnicker,
passing her a plate of generously thick, ragged looking sandwiches,
spread with great chunks of butter fresh from the ice-box, and
filled with delicate slices of pink ham. "I want you to eat it
with me. This is a 'specially good pie, and Elspeth can 'most
beat Faith when it comes to dough. Mrs. Deacon Hopper sent us
the ham&mdash;a whole one, all boiled and baked with sugar and cloves.
It's simply <em>fine</em>! The lilacs I took the deacon did the
work all right. He was so tickled that he got over being grumpy,
and calls Saint John a promising preacher now. Please taste the
sandwiches. I know you'll like them even if I didn't get the bread
cut real even and nice. Then after we get through eating, I'll
plant the pansies."</p>

<p>"Pansies!" She stared past the brown head bobbing over the hamper,
to the box of nodding blossoms in the grass. "What made you bring
me pansies?"</p>

<p>"'Cause you ain't got any, and no garden looks quite finished
without some of those flowers in it. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I <em>de-spise</em> pansies!"</p>

<p>Peace eyed her in horrified amazement an instant, then swept
the rejected blossoms out of sight beneath the basket cover, saying
tartly, "You needn't be ugly about it! I can take them home again.
I s'posed of course you liked them. I didn't know the garden was
empty of them 'cause you <em>wouldn't</em> have them. <em>I</em>
think they are the prettiest flower growing, next to lilacs and
roses."</p>

<p>"Those mocking little faces?"</p>

<p>"Those darling, giggly smiles!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever see a giggling pansy?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't say I ever did." A faint trace of amusement stole
around the corners of the white lips.</p>

<p>"Well, here's one. Oh, I forgot! You <em>de-spise</em> them!"
She had half lifted a gorgeous yellow blossom from the hidden
box, but at second thought dropped it back in the loose earth.</p>

<p>"Let me see it!" The Lilac Lady extended one blue-veined hand
with the imperious gesture which Peace had learned to know and
obey. Silently she thrust the moist plant into the outstretched
fingers, and gravely watched while the keen blue eyes studied
the golden petals which, as Peace had declared, seemed fairly
teeming with sunshine and laughter. "It does&mdash;look rather&mdash;cheerful,"
she conceded at length.</p>

<p>"That is just what I thought. I named it Hope."</p>

<p>"Hope! The name is appropriate."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very 'propriate. Hope is always so sunshiny and smily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you named it for your sister."</p>

<p>"Who did you think it was named for?"</p>

<p>"I didn't understand. Is it a habit of yours to name all your
flowers?"</p>

<p>"N-o, not all. But we gener'ly name our pansies, Allee and me.
See, this beautiful white one with just a tiny speck of yellow
in the middle I called my Lilac Lady."</p>

<p>"Why?" A queer little choke came in her throat at these unexpected
words, and she turned her eyes away that Peace might not see the
tears which dimmed her sight.</p>

<p>"You looked so sweet and like a <em>nangel</em> the first time
I saw you, and this pansy has a reg'lar angel face."</p>

<p>"Don't I look sweet and like an angel any more?"</p>

<p>"Some days&mdash;whenever you want to. But lots of times I guess you
don't care how you look," was the reply, as the busy fingers sorted
out the different colored blossoms from the box, all unconscious
of the stinging arrow she had just shot into the heart of her
friend. "This blue one's Allee. Blue means truth, grandma says,
and Allee is true blue. Red in our flag stands for valor. Cherry
ain't very brave, but I named this for her anyway, in hopes she'd
ask why and I could tell her. Then maybe when she found out that
folks thought she was a 'fraid cat, she'd get over it. Don't you
think she would?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;if you were her teacher," the older girl answered absently.
"Who is the black one?"</p>

<p>"Grandpa. Isn't it a whopper? He is real tall but not fat like
the flower. He always wears black at the University&mdash;that's why
I picked that one for him. This one is grandma and here is Gail.
The striped one is Faith. She is good in streaks, but she can
be awful cross sometimes, too,&mdash;like you. This tiny one is Glen,
and the big, brown, spotted feller is Aunt Pen. It makes me think
of old Cockletop, a mother hen we used to have in Parker, which
'dopted everything it could find wandering around loose. That's
what Aunt Pen looks as if she'd like to do."</p>

<p>This was too much for the lame girl's risibles, and she laughed
outright, long and loud, to Peace's secret delight, for when the
Lilac Lady laughed it was a sure sign that she was feeling better.</p>

<p>When she had recovered her composure, she said gravely, "Speaking
of Aunt Pen reminds me that she told me this morning the cook
had made some chicken patties for my special benefit and was hurt
to think I refused them. You might run up to the house and ask
for them now to go with our picnic lunch. Minnie will give them
to you&mdash;cold, please. Some lemonade would taste good, too. Aunt
Pen knows how to make it to perfection."</p>

<p>Peace was gone almost before she had finished giving her directions,
and as she watched the nimble feet skimming through the clover,
she smiled tenderly, then sighed and looked sadly down at her
own useless limbs which would never bear her weight again. How
many years of existence must she endure in her crippled helplessness?
Oh, the bitterness of it! And yet as she gazed at the slippers
which never wore out, and compared her lot with that of the dancing,
curly-haired sprite, tumbling eagerly up the kitchen steps after
the promised goodies, the old, weary look of utter despair did
not quite come back into the deep blue eyes; but through the bitterness
of her rebellion flashed a faint gleam of something akin to hope.
She was thinking of Peace's latest sunshine quotation which had
been laboriously entered in the little brown and gold volume and
brought to her for her inspection:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'To live in hope, to trust in right,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To smile when shadows start,<br/>
To walk through darkness as through light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sunshine in the heart.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Below the little stanza, Peace had penned her own version of
the words in her quaint language: "This means to smile no matter
how bad the world goes round and to keep on smiling till the hurt
is gone. It don't cost any more to smile than it does to be uggly,
and it pays a heep site better."</p>

<p>What a dear little philosopher the child was! A sudden desire
to meet the other sisters of that happy family sprang up within
her heart. Why should she stay shut away from the world like a
nun in her cloister? What had she gained by it? Nothing but bitterness!
And think of the joys she had missed!</p>

<p>An insistent rustling of the lilac bushes behind her caught her
attention, and by carefully raising her head she could see the
thick branches close to the ground bending and giving, as a small,
dark object twisted and grunted and wriggled its way through the
tiny opening it had managed to find in the hedge.</p>

<p>The girl's first impulse was to scream for help, but a second
glance told her that it was not an animal pushing its way through
the twigs, for animals do not wear blue gingham rompers. So she
held her breath and waited, and at last she was rewarded by seeing
a round, flushed, inquisitive baby face peeping through the leaves
at her. She smiled and held out her hands, and with a gurgle of
gladness, the little fellow gave a final struggle, scrambled to
his feet and toddled unsteadily across the lawn to her chair,
jabbering baby lingo, the only word of which she could understand
was, "Peace."</p>

<p>"Are you Glen?" she demanded, smoothing the soft black hair so
like his father's.</p>

<p>"G'en," he repeated, parrot fashion.</p>

<p>"Where is your mamma?"</p>

<p>"Mamma." He pointed in the direction he had come, and gurgled,
"S'eep. Papa s'eep. All gone."</p>

<p>The baby himself looked as if he had just awakened from a nap.
One cheek was rosier than the other, his hair lay in damp rings
all over his head, and his feet were bare and earth-stained from
his scramble through the vegetable garden on the other side of
the hedge.</p>

<p>A sudden gust of cool wind blew through the trees overhead, a
rattling peal of thunder jarred the earth, a blinding flash of
lightning startled both girl and baby, and before either knew
what had happened, a torrent of rain dashed down upon them. The
storm which had been brewing all that sultry day broke in its
fury. Hicks came running from the stable to the rescue of his
helpless young mistress, Aunt Pen flew out of the house like a
distracted hen, and Peace rushed frantically to the garden to
save the precious picnic lunch and the box of pansies which were
to be planted under the gnarled old oak nearest the lame girl's
window.</p>

<p>So it happened that baby Glen was borne away into the great house
to wait until the deluge of rain and hail should cease. In the
flurry of getting everything under shelter, no one thought of
the mother at home, crazed with anxiety and fright; and the whole
group was startled a few moments later to behold a bare-headed,
wild-eyed woman, drenched to the skin, dash through the iron gates,
up the walk, and straight into the house itself, without ever
stopping to knock.</p>

<p>"It's Elspeth!" cried Peace, first to find her voice.</p>

<p>"Glen, where's Glen?" was all the frantic mother could gasp as
she stood tottering and dripping in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Ma-ma," lisped the little runaway, struggling down from Aunt
Pen's lap, where he had been cuddling, and running into Elizabeth's
arms.</p>

<p>"Peace, why did you take him without saying a word?" she reproached,
sinking into the nearest chair, and hugging her small son close
to her breast.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;" Peace began.</p>

<p>"I think he must have run away," volunteered the Lilac Lady,
staring fixedly at Elizabeth's face with almost frightened eyes.
"He squirmed through the hedge while I was alone in the garden.
I had not seen the storm approaching, and it broke before I could
call Peace or&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the sound of the sweet voice, Elizabeth had abruptly risen
to her feet, and after one searching glance at the white face
among the cushions, cried out with girlish glee, "Myra! Can it
be that Peace's Lilac Lady is my dear old chum?"</p>

<p>"You are the same darling Beth!" cried the lame girl hysterically,
clinging to the wet hand outstretched to hers. "Why didn't I guess
it before? Oh, I have wanted you <em>so</em> often&mdash;but I never
dreamed of finding you here. And to think I have refused all this
while to let Peace bring you!"</p>

<p>"No, don't think about that. Her desire is accomplished, however
it came about&mdash;and you are going to let me stay?"</p>

<p>"I would keep you with me always if I could. I have been learning
Peace's philosophy and find it very&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peaceful?" They laughed together, and in that laugh sounded
the doom of the hedges which Peace had lamented so long.</p>
