<p>“Hold, comrade,” said Eric, “I have something to say that songs cannot
carry. Hearken, my shield-mates: we swore to be true to each other,
even to death: is it not so? What then shall be said of that man who cut
loose the Gudruda and left us two to die at the foeman’s hand?”
</p><p>“Who was the man?” asked a voice.
</p><p>“That man was Hall of Lithdale,” said Eric.
</p><p>“It is false!” said Hall, gathering up his courage; “the cable parted
beneath the straining of the ship, and afterwards we could not put about
because of the great sea.”
</p><p>“Thou art false!” roared Skallagrim. “With my eyes I saw thee let thine
axe fall upon the cable. Liar art thou and dastard! Thou art jealous
also of Brighteyes thy lord, and this was in thy mind: to let him die
upon the Raven and then to bind his shoes upon thy cowardly feet. Though
none else saw, I saw; and I say this: that if I may have my will, I will
string thee, living, to the prow in that same cable till gulls tear out
thy fox-heart!”
</p><p>Now Hall grew very white and his knees trembled beneath him. “It is
true,” he said, “that I cut the chain, but not from any thought of evil.
Had I not cut it the vessel must have sunk and all been lost.”
</p><p>“Did we not swear, Hall,” said Eric sternly, “together to fight and
together to fall--together to fare and, if need be, together to cease
from faring, and dost thou read the oath thus? Say, mates, what
reward shall be paid to this man for his good fellowship to us and his
tenderness for your lives?”
</p><p>As with one voice the men answered “_Death!_”
</p><p>“Thou hearest, Hall?” said Eric. “Yet I would deal more gently with one
to whom I swore fellowship so lately. Get thee gone from our company,
and let us see thy cur’s face no more. Get thee gone, I say, before I
repent of my mercy.”
</p><p>Then amidst a loud hooting, Hall took his weapons and without a word
slunk into the boat of the Raven that lay astern, and rowed ashore; nor
did Eric see his face for many months.
</p><p>“Thou hast done foolishly, lord, to let that weasel go,” said
Skallagrim, “for he will live to nip thy hand.”
</p><p>“For good or evil, he is gone,” said Eric, “and now I am worn out and
desire to sleep.”
</p>
<p>After this Eric and Skallagrim rested three full days, and they were so
weary that they were awake for little of this time. But on the third day
they rose up, strong and well, except for their hurts and soreness. Then
they told the men of that which had come to pass, and all wondered at
their might and hardihood. To them indeed Eric seemed as a God, for few
such deeds as his had been told of since the God-kind were on earth.
</p><p>But Brighteyes thought little of his deeds, and much of Gudruda. At
times also he thought of Swanhild, and of that witch-dream she sent him:
for it was wonderful to him that she should have saved him thus from
Ran’s net.
</p><p>Eric was heartily welcomed by the Earl of the Farey Isles, for, when he
heard his deeds, he made a feast in his honour, and set him in the high
seat. It was a great feast, but Skallagrim became drunk at it and ran
down the chamber, axe aloft, roaring for Hall of Lithdale.
</p><p>This angered Eric much and he would scarcely speak to Skallagrim for
many days, though the great Baresark slunk about after him like his
shadow, or a whipped hound at its master’s heel, and at length humbled
his pride so far as to ask pardon for his fault.
</p><p>“I grant it for thy deeds’ sake,” said Eric shortly; “but this is upon
my mind: that thou wilt err thus again, and it shall be my cause of
death--ay, and that of many more.”
</p><p>“First may my bones be white,” said Skallagrim.
</p><p>“They shall be white thereafter,” answered Eric.
</p><p>At Fareys Eric shipped twelve good men and true, to take the seats of
those who had been slain by Ospakar’s folk. Afterwards, when the wounded
were well of their hurts (except one man who died), and the Gudruda was
made fit to take the sea again, Brighteyes bade farewell to the Earl of
those Isles, who gave him a good cloak and a gold ring at parting, and
sailed away.
</p>
<p>Now it were too long to tell of all the deeds that Eric and his men
did. Never, so scalds sing, was there a viking like him for strength
and skill and hardihood, and, in those days, no such war-dragon as the
Gudruda had been known upon the sea. Wherever Eric joined battle, and
that was in many places, he conquered, for none prevailed against him,
till at last foes would fly before the terror of his name, and earls and
kings would send from far craving the aid of his hands. Withal he was
the best and gentlest of men. It is said of Eric that in all his days he
did no base deed, nor hurt the weak, nor refused peace to him who prayed
it, nor lifted sword against prisoner or wounded foe. From traders
he would take a toll of their merchandise only and let them go, and
whatever gains he won he would share equally, asking no larger part than
the meanest of his band. All men loved Eric, and even his foes gave him
honour and spoke well of him. Now that Hall of Lithdale was gone, there
was no man among his mates who would not have passed to death for him,
for they held him dearer than their lives. Women, too, loved him much;
but his heart was set upon Gudruda, and he seldom turned to look on
them.
</p><p>The first summer of his outlawry Eric warred along the coast of Ireland,
but in the winter he came to Dublin, and for a while served in the
body-guard of the king of that town, who held him in honour, and would
have had him stay there. But Eric would not bide there, and next spring,
the Gudruda being ready for sea, he sailed for the shores of England.
There he gave battle to two vikings’ ships of war, and took them after
a hard fight. It was in this fight that Skallagrim Lambstail was wounded
almost to death. For when, having taken one ship, Eric boarded the other
with but few men, he was driven back and fell over a beam, and would
have been slain, had not Skallagrim thrown himself across his body,
taking on his own back that blow of a battle-axe which was aimed at
Eric’s head. This was a great wound, for the axe shore through the steel
of the byrnie and sank into the flesh. But when Eric’s men saw their
lord down, and Skallagrim, as they deemed, dead athwart him, they made
so fierce a rush that the foemen fell before them like leaves before
a winter gale, and the end of it was that the vikings prayed peace of
Eric. Skallagrim lay sick for many days, but he was hard to kill, and
Eric nursed him back to life. After this these two loved each other as
brother loves twin brother, and they could scarcely bear to be apart.
But other people did not love Skallagrim, nor he them.
</p><p>Eric sailed on up the Thames to London, bringing the viking ships with
him, and he delivered their captains bound to Edmund, Edward’s son,
the king who was called Edmund the Magnificent. These captains the King
hung, for they had wrought damage to his ships.
</p><p>Eric found much favour with the King, and, indeed, his fame had
gone before him. So when he came into the court, bravely clad, with
Skallagrim at his back, who was now almost recovered of his wound, the
King called out to him to draw near, saying that he desired to look on
the bravest viking and most beauteous man who sailed the seas, and on
that fierce Baresark whom men called “Eric’s Death-shadow.”
</p><p>So Eric came forward up the long hall that was adorned with things more
splendid than ever his eyes had seen, and stood before the King. With
him came Skallagrim, driving the two captive viking chiefs before him
with his axe, as a flesher drives lambs. Now, during these many months
Brighteyes had grown yet more great in girth and glorious to look on
than he was before. Moreover, his hair was now so long that it flowed
like a flood of gold down towards his girdle, for since Gudruda trimmed
it no shears had come near his head, and his locks grew fast as a
woman’s. The King looked at him and was astonished.
</p><p>“Of a truth,” he said, “men have not lied about thee, Icelander, nor
concerning that great wolf-hound of thine,” and he pointed at Skallagrim
with his sword of state. “Never saw I such a man;” and he bade all the
mightiest men of his body-guard stand forward that he might measure them
against Eric. But Brighteyes was an inch taller than the tallest, and
measured half a span more round the chest than the biggest.
</p><p>“What wouldest thou of me, Icelander?” asked the King.
</p><p>“This, lord,” said Eric: “to serve thee a while, and all my men with
me.”
</p><p>“That is an offer that few would turn from,” answered the King. “Thou
shalt go into my body-guard, and, if I have my will, thou shalt be near
me in battle, and thy wolf-dog also.”
</p><p>Eric said that he asked no better, and thereafter he went up with Edmund
the King to make war on the Danes of Mercia, and he and Skallagrim did
great deeds before the eyes of the Englishmen.
</p><p>That winter Eric and his company came back to London, and abode with
the King in much state and honour. Now, there was a certain lady of
the court named Elfrida. She was both fair and wealthy, the sweetest of
women, and of royal blood by her mother’s side. So soon as her eyes fell
on Eric she loved him, and no one thing did she desire more than to
be his wife. But Brighteyes kept aloof from her, for he loved Gudruda
alone; and so the winter wore away, and in the spring he went away
warring, nor did he come back till autumn was at hand.
</p><p>The Lady Elfrida sat at a window when Eric rode through London Town
in the King’s following, and as he passed she threw him a wreath of
flowers. The King saw it and laughed.
</p><p>“My cold kinswoman seems to melt before those bright eyes of thine,
Icelander,” he said, “as my foes melt before Whitefire’s flame. Well, I
could wish her a worse mate,” and he looked on him strangely.
</p><p>Eric bowed, but made no answer.
</p><p>That night, as they sat at meat in the palace, the Lady Elfrida, being
bidden in jest of Edmund the King to fill the cup of the bravest, passed
down the board, and, before all men, poured wine into Eric’s cup, and,
as she did so, welcomed him back with short sweet words.
</p><p>Eric grew red as dawn, and thanked her graciously; but after the feast
he spoke with Skallagrim, asking him of the Gudruda, and when she could
be ready to take the sea.
</p><p>“In ten days, lord,” said Skallagrim; “but stay we not here with the
King this winter? It is late to sail.”
</p><p>“Nay,” said Eric, “we bide not here. I would winter this year in Fareys,
for they are the nighest place to Iceland that I may reach. Next summer
my three years of outlawry are over, and I would fare back homewards.”
</p><p>“Now, I see the shadow of a woman’s hand,” said Skallagrim. “It is very
late to face the northern seas, and we may sail to Iceland from London
in the spring.”
</p><p>“It is my will that we should sail,” answered Eric.
</p><p>“Past Orkneys runs the road to Fareys,” said Skallagrim, “and in Orkneys
sits a hawk to whom the Lady Elfrida is but a dove. In faring from ill
we may hap on worse.”
</p><p>“It is my will that we sail,” said Eric stubbornly.
</p><p>“As thou wilt, and as the King wills,” answered Skallagrim.
</p><p>On the morrow Eric went in before the King, and craved a boon.
</p><p>“There is little that thou canst ask, Brighteyes,” said the King, “that
I will not give thee, for, by my troth, I hold thee dear.”
</p><p>“I am come back to seek no great thing, lord,” answered Eric, “but this
only: leave to bid thee farewell. I would wend homeward.”
</p><p>“Say, Eric,” said the King, “have I not dealt well with thee?”
</p><p>“Well, and overwell, lord.”
</p><p>“Why, then, wouldst thou leave me? I have this in my mind--to bring thee
to great honour. See, now, there is a fair lady in this court, and in
her veins runs blood that even an Iceland viking might be proud to mate
with. She has great lands, and, mayhap, she shall have more. Canst thou
not find a home on them, thinkest thou, Brighteyes?”
</p><p>“In Iceland only I am at home, lord,” said Eric.
</p><p>Then the King was wroth, and bade him begone when it pleased him, and
Eric bowed before him and went out.
</p><p>Two days afterwards, while Eric was walking in the Palace gardens he met
the Lady Elfrida face to face. She held white flowers in her hand, and
she was fair to see and pale as the flowers she bore.
</p><p>He greeted her, and, after a while, she spoke to him in a gentle voice:
“They say that thou goest from England, Brighteyes?” she said.
</p><p>“Yes, lady; I go,” he answered.
</p><p>She looked on him once and twice and then burst out weeping. “Why goest
thou hence to that cold land of thine?” she sobbed--“that hateful land
of snow and ice! Is not England good enough for thee?”
</p><p>“I am at home there, lady, and there my mother waits me.”
</p><p>“‘There thy mother waits thee,’ Eric?--say, does a maid called Gudruda
the Fair wait thee there also?”
</p><p>“There is such a maid in Iceland,” said Eric.
</p><p>“Yes; I know it--I know it all,” she answered, drying her tears, and
of a sudden growing cold and proud; “Eric, thou art betrothed to this
Gudruda; and, for thy welfare, somewhat overfaithful to thy troth. For
hearken, Eric Brighteyes. I know this: that little luck shall come
to thee from the maid Gudruda. It would become me ill to say more;
nevertheless, this is true--that here, in England, good fortune waits
thy hand, and there in Iceland such fortune as men mete to their foes.
Knowest thou this?”
</p><p>Eric looked at her and answered: “Lady,” he said, “men are not born of
their own will, they live and do little that they will, they do and go,
perchance, whither they would not. Yet it may happen to a man that one
meets him whose hand he fain would hold, if it be but for an hour’s
travel over icy ways; and it is better to hold that hand for this short
hour than to wend his life through at a stranger’s side.”
</p><p>“Perhaps there is wisdom in thy folly,” said the Lady Elfrida. “Still, I
tell thee this: that no good luck waits thee there in Iceland.”
</p><p>“It well may be,” said Eric: “my days have been stormy, and the gale is
still brewing. But it is a poor heart that fears the storm. Better to
sink; for, coward or hero, all must sink at last.”
</p><p>“Say, Eric,” said the lady, “if that hand thou dost desire to hold is
lost to thee, what then?”
</p><p>“If that hand is cold in death, then henceforth I wend my ways alone.”
</p><p>“And if it be held of another hand than thine?”
</p><p>“Then I will journey back to England, lady, and here in this fair garden
I may crave speech of thee again.”
</p><p>They looked one on another. “Fare thee well, Eric!” said the Lady
Elfrida. “Here in this garden we may talk again; and, if we talk no
more--why, fare thee well! Days come and go; the swallow takes flight
at winter, and lo! at spring it twitters round the eaves. And if it come
not again, then farewell to that swallow. The world is a great house,
Eric, and there is room for many swallows. But alas! for her who is left
desolate--alas, alas!” And she turned and went.
</p><p>It is told of this lady Elfrida that she became very wealthy and was
much honoured for her gentleness and wisdom, and that, when she was old,
she built a great church and named it Ericskirk. It is also told that,
though many sought her in marriage, she wedded none.
