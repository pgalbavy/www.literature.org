<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The wind from the south was so strong that most of the large
sparks capable of carrying the fire were thrown beyond the block-house,
falling about the stockade, on the clearing, and among the trees,
where they kindled spiral serpents of flame and smoke, which quickly
died of themselves.</p>

<p>But as the blaze grew hotter and hotter, it seemed to converge
its fierce heat upon the doomed block-house, as the blowpipe melts
the obdurate metal. The upper room became filled with the quivering
air, and more than one wondered how it was the logs withstood
the furnace-like blast so long.</p>

<p>Although the two cabins were closer to each other than to the
fort, yet the untouched one was in no danger because of the direction
of the wind. The structure which had been lighted, burned furiously,
and those who were watching its progress soon detected smoke from
the block-house itself.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was surprised to learn that, instead of being on the
roof, it was from one of the windows almost directly under him&mdash;almost
the last place where he expected the flames to catch.</p>

<p>While he was peering downward through the openings at his feet,
he discovered the blaze.</p>

<p>A quart or two of water, well applied, extinguished it, and he
called at the others to make known at once any other flame they
might see. The warning was scarcely given, when Blossom Brown
shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here it am! here it am! burnin' like all creation!"</p>

<p>The dusky lad was not mistaken, for the logs below them had caught
again, and considerable water was required before it succumbed.
However, it went out at last, and the thick smoke and steam climbed
upward into the face of Blossom, who coughed until he seemed nearly
racked to pieces.</p>

<p>Doubtless the Wyandots could have poured in a volley of shots
through the loopholes, which would have slain a number of the
hapless defenders; but now, when nothing could prevent the capture
of the entire party, the red men preferred that the company should
fall into their hands intact.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was standing at the south-east angle of the block-house,
looking toward the burning building, when he saw something which,
for the time, made him doubt the evidence of his own senses.</p>

<p>His position was such that he could look directly along the western
side of the cabin, which was unharmed by the flames. This, it
will be noted, was the portion that adjoined the burning structure.
On this side of the building, which was not burning, the heat
was not very great, but the illumination was so strong that it
was as light as midday, and no Wyandot ventured near it, through
fear of the rifles of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>The youth was watching the cabin, around and through which the
flames were raging so furiously, when an Indian warrior walked
into view. From what point he came, the watcher could not tell:
the first he saw of him was when he approached the logs of the
other structure. He moved slowly, as if surveying all sides, and
when he turned and reached the door, he was seen to raise his
hand and pass within, where, of course, he vanished from sight.</p>

<p>This of itself would not have been so extraordinary, but for
the fact that the handsome face, distinctly shown in the glare,
the slight, graceful figure, carrying a long bow in his right
hand, and displaying the quiver of arrows over his shoulder, identified
the Indian as Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>Despite the frightful situation, Ned Preston could scarcely restrain
a cheer, for he was thrilled with a pleasure beyond description
over the unexpected discovery that his devoted friend was still
alive.</p>

<p>Ned darted to the side of Jo Stinger and told him what he had
seen.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it, younker?" demanded the scout sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure of it? It is impossible that I should be mistaken; I know
him as well as I do you, and he stood in the full glare of the
firelight."</p>

<p>"You're right; it <em>was</em> the Shawanoe; I seen him; I thought
the young varmint was dead, but he's a good deal more alive this
minute than we are."</p>

<p>"But, Jo, what does it mean? Why did he come out there where
he could be seen, and go into the building?"</p>

<p>"He wanted us to notice him, and it was the best thing he could
do. The varmints toward the river and in the clearin' must have
cotched sight of him; but before they could larn his name and
post-office address, he was inside."</p>

<p>"But I can't understand his cause for entering the cabin any
way; what good can he do us there?"</p>

<p>"I've my 'spicion&mdash;<em>there</em>! that's what I expected!"</p>

<p>A crackling, snapping sound overhead told the alarming truth:
the roof was burning fiercely, and there was no possible way of
putting out the flames. In fact, it had been ablaze some time,
for the fiery points were seen in several places along the ridge-pole,
fast eating their way, so to speak, into the vitals of the building.</p>

<p>A minute after the sparks began falling through upon the floor,
the vapor loaded with fire filtered through the loopholes, and
the upper story had become untenable.</p>

<p>"Down the ladder!" said Jo Stinger; "it won't do to wait any
longer."</p>

<p>He led the way himself, and the others followed in rather a pell-mell
fashion. All, however, safely reached the lower story, where the
situation was improved for a brief time only.</p>

<p>Smoke and fire were around them; the air was thick with strangling
vapor and blistering sparks; the glow illuminated the interior,
as if with a thousand lamps, and the ghastly countenances were
rendered more unearthly by the lurid light which permeated everywhere.</p>

<p>Megill, Turner and Stinger were grim and silent. They had faced
death before, and they were certain always to meet him with the
front of heroes. The pale face of Mrs. Preston was calm, and she
was sustained by the unfaltering trust of the Christian who forgets
not that, however great the sufferings awaiting him, they can
never equal the anguish of Him who gave up his life on Calvary
for the world.</p>

<p>She kept her little ones close to her side. She had held a rifle
when the danger first appeared; but she did not discharge it,
and it was now cast aside. She remained near her husband, who,
in a low voice, spoke encouraging words to her and his little
ones, and who was resolved to die fighting in defence of those
who were a thousand times dearer to him than his own life.</p>

<p>Blossom Brown was stupefied by the overwhelming terror of the
scene. He moved about in a stolid, ox-like fashion, capable of
obeying blindly whatever those around told him to do.</p>

<p>It was apparent even to the little children, who had hushed their
cries, that it was impossible to stay more than a few minutes
longer in the block-house. It was already on fire in a dozen different
places, and was burning furiously. The fugitives might remain
huddled together a short while, but only to meet the most awful
of deaths; or they could venture forth and fall into the hands
of the treacherous Wyandots.</p>

<p>"The door of that cabin over there is partly open, as you can
obsarve," said Jo Stinger; "the logs haven't been scorched by
fire, as you can also obsarve; we'll make a run for that door,
and arter we get inside, we'll fight till the death, as you'll
also obsarve."</p>

<p>"But they can shoot us down while we're on the way," said Colonel
Preston.</p>

<p>"They can, but they won't; for they'd rather make us prisoners.
No red varmint shall ever take <em>me</em> captive."</p>

<p>"Nor me either," added Turner and Megill together.</p>

<p>"That seems to be the only thing we can do. We ought to be able
to make a stand there until to-morrow, when there may be help
from Wild Oaks."</p>

<p>"All make ready; I'll lead the way."</p>

<p>There was not a heart from which a fervent prayer was not sent
up to heaven; but the men compressed their lips and nerved themselves
for the final effort. Colonel Preston caught up Mary the elder,
kissed and pressed her to his heart. She returned the caresses,
and he held her on his left arm, while the right hand grasped
his rifle. The wife did the same with Susie, for the weapon she
had cast aside was too valuable to leave behind.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better lead de way?" asked Blossom Brown, crowding
forward.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I'll kind ob darken tings, so de Injines can't see us."</p>

<p>"Wait till we start, and then you may lead if you can."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger leaned his long rifle against the wall, and with a
firm, strong hand removed the bars one after the other. Then the
door was drawn inward, he picked up his gun, and looked around
at the group.</p>

<p>"Foller me!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he strode forth, the others close on his heels.
Blossom Brown made a plunge to pass the leader, but as he did
not know which way to turn, he fell back.</p>

<p>The scout diverged to the left, and, with the same deliberate
tread, passed over the open space between the burning cabin and
the blazing block-house. A short time before, this would have
been impossible; but the cabin was so nearly destroyed that the
heat could be borne, although it caused each to hold his breath,
it was so intolerable.</p>

<p>Scores of the Wyandots were watching the fugitives, and whoops
and shouts of exultation rent the air, as a dozen advanced to
meet the captives.</p>

<p>The latter hurried forward a few paces more, when Jo Stinger
shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now run for your lives!"</p>

<p>They were within fifty feet of the open door of the second cabin,
through which he plunged the next instant like a cannon-shot,
the others following pell-mell. The movement was so sudden and
unexpected by the Wyandots crowding forward that it was virtually
finished before they could interfere.</p>

<p>Ned Preston purposely threw himself behind the others, that he
might, so far as possible, help protect his aunt and cousins.
He was about to follow them into the building, when one warrior,
more agile than the other, bounded forward with uplifted tomahawk.</p>

<p>Before he could throw it, and before Ned could use his gun, a
resounding twang was heard from the nearest window, and an arrow
from the royal bow of Deerfoot the Shawanoe transfixed him.</p>

<p>Ned Preston was inside in a twinkling. The Wyandots, infuriated
over the trick played them, made a rush, with the intention of
forcing an entrance at all hazards; but they were met by a rattling
fire, which sent them skurrying like rabbits to cover. Every window
seemed to bristle with rifles, and the shots were so numerous
that Waughtauk and his warriors saw that others than the fugitives
were defending the building.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. When Macaiah Preston, the leading settler
at Wild Oaks, sent Deerfoot to apprise Colonel Preston of his
danger, he did not contemplate doing anything more. But his own
son was involved, and he became so uneasy that he consulted his
neighbors, who agreed that help should be dispatched to Fort Bridgman
without delay.</p>

<p>Accompanied by ten skilled riflemen, all of whom had seen service
on the frontier, he set out for the station thirty miles away.
He reached the neighborhood quite late at night of the second
day of the siege, and on the way he met and was joined by Deerfoot,
who had started to obtain his help.</p>

<p>As the Wyandots felt certain of their prey, they had relaxed
their vigilance to a great extent. It was a curious fact that,
while Jo Stinger was engaged on his reconnoissance, Deerfoot and
several of the new arrivals were doing the same, although neither
suspected the presence of the other.</p>

<p>The plan of Waughtauk was soon learned, and it was then decided
to enter the cabin, and be guided by events. This was a task of
extreme difficulty, but with the assistance of Deerfoot, who was
the first to open the way, they got within the building without
detection by their enemies. Then, with loaded and cocked rifles,
they held themselves ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>As the crisis approached, Deerfoot purposely showed himself to
the garrison, that they might recognize him and learn that they
were not deserted. At the same time Macaiah Preston made several
guarded signals to Jo Stinger, which that scout saw and understood,
though no one else did. He said nothing to his friends, but it
was this knowledge which gave such assurance to his movements.</p>

<p>The numbers within the cabin rendered it practically impregnable
to twice the force at the command of Waughtauk, chieftain of the
Wyandots. The illumination from the burning embers was so full
that any warrior who ventured to show himself was riddled before
he could approach within a hundred feet of the building.</p>

<p>This "electric light" lasted until after daylight, at which hour
not a solitary hostile was visible. The single structure that
had been left standing contained a stronger force than that of
the red men who had destroyed the other two.</p>

<p>There was no move made until noon, when Deerfoot ventured into
the woods on a careful and prolonged reconnoissance. When he came
back, he reported of a verity that Waughtauk and his Indians had
gone, and in all probability were miles distant.</p>

<p>It was deemed best, however, for the settlers to stay where they
were, until the succeeding morning. This was done, and, at an
early hour, the whole company started for Wild Oaks, on the Ohio.</p>

<p>The journey was ended without special incident, and just as the
sun went down behind the western wilderness, the settlement was
reached, and all danger was past.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" exclaimed Colonel Preston, looking reverently
upward; "we have been saved by fire indeed."</p>

<p>"And did you ever think we wouldn't be?" asked Susie, his younger
daughter.</p>

<p>"Well, I must own that I gave up once."</p>

<p>"That is wicked, papa," said the little one reproachfully; "I
<em>knew</em> God would take care of us all, and the bad Indians
wouldn't hurt us, 'cause Mary and I prayed to Him, and He heard
us."</p>

<p>"God bless you &mdash;I believe you!" replied the father, with
misty eyes, as he tossed the darlings in air one after the other,
caught them in his arms, and kissed them again and again.</p>

<p>We have not dwelt on the meeting in the cabin, which survived
the flames, between the despairing fugitives and their rescuers.
Its joyful nature may be imagined. The countenance of the handsome,
willowy young Shawanoe was aglow with pleasure, when he grasped
the hand of the no less delighted Ned Preston, who had believed
him dead until he saw him walk forth in the glare of the burning
building.</p>

<p>"You must come and live with us," said Ned, at the end of the
journey, and after the others had thanked the wonderful youth
for his services, which were beyond value.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will visit his friends," said he, holding the hand
of Ned, and looking affectionately in the face of the youthful
pioneer; "but his home is in the woods. He loves to lie under
the trees and listen to the sighing of the wind among the branches;
he loves to watch the clouds, as they float like snowy canoes
across the blue sky; he loves to listen to the soft flow of the
river, to crawl under the edge of the rock, and hear the snowflakes
sifting down on the brown leaves; his soul rejoices at the crashing
of the thunderbolts, which split the trees like rotten fruit.
When Deerfoot is tired, he can wrap his blanket around him and
sleep anywhere; when he is hungry, he has his bow and arrow which
can bring down the deer, and the bear, and the bison; when he
is thirsty, he can drink the cold water which drips from the mossy
rocks; when he is in trouble, he will pray to the Great Spirit
of the white man, who will not turn his ear away.</p>

<p>"No, Deerfoot must live in the forests, but he will always love
the pale-faces, and perhaps," added the Shawanoe, looking Ned
Preston straight in the eye, "it may be the fortune of Deerfoot
to be of help again to you."</p>

<p>"I know how gladly it will be given," said Ned gratefully; "and
if there ever should come any need of <em>our</em> help, it will
be the pleasure of our lives to prove how much we appreciate your
friendship."</p>

<p>The sun had gone down, and the shadows of night were creeping
through the dim, silent woods, when Deerfoot the Shawanoe crossed
the clearing which surrounded the settlement, and, pausing on
the border of the forest, he waved a good-bye to his friends.
Then he turned and vanished from sight.</p>

<p>But there seemed to rest the mantle of prophecy on his graceful
shoulders, when he intimated that it might be his good fortune
to render service to Ned Preston and his friends. The opportunity
came sooner than any one anticipated, and what befell the boy
pioneer, and what was done by the young Shawanoe, will be told
in the second volume of the "Boy Pioneer Series," entitled&mdash;</p>
