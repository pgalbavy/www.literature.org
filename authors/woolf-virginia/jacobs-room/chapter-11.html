<p>"Archer," said Mrs. Flanders with that tenderness which mothers
so often display towards their eldest sons, "will be at Gibraltar
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The post for which she was waiting (strolling up Dods Hill while
the random church bells swung a hymn tune about her head, the
clock striking four straight through the circling notes; the glass
purpling under a storm-cloud; and the two dozen houses of the
village cowering, infinitely humble, in company under a leaf of
shadow), the post, with all its variety of messages, envelopes
addressed in bold hands, in slanting hands, stamped now with English
stamps, again with Colonial stamps, or sometimes hastily dabbed
with a yellow bar, the post was about to scatter a myriad messages
over the world. Whether we gain or not by this habit of profuse
communication it is not for us to say. But that letter-writing
is practised mendaciously nowadays, particularly by young men
travelling in foreign parts, seems likely enough.</p>

<p>For example, take this scene.</p>

<p>Here was Jacob Flanders gone abroad and staying to break his
journey in Paris. (Old Miss Birkbeck, his mother's cousin, had
died last June and left him a hundred pounds.)</p>

<p>"You needn't repeat the whole damned thing over again, Cruttendon,"
said Mallinson, the little bald painter who was sitting at a marble
table, splashed with coffee and ringed with wine, talking very
fast, and undoubtedly more than a little drunk.</p>

<p>"Well, Flanders, finished writing to your lady?" said Cruttendon,
as Jacob came and took his seat beside them, holding in his hand
an envelope addressed to Mrs. Flanders, near Scarborough, England.</p>

<p>"Do you uphold Velasquez?" said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>"By God, he does," said Mallinson.</p>

<p>"He always gets like this," said Cruttendon irritably.</p>

<p>Jacob looked at Mallinson with excessive composure.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you the three greatest things that were ever written
in the whole of literature," Cruttendon burst out. "'Hang there
like fruit my soul.'" he began....</p>

<p>"Don't listen to a man who don't like Velasquez," said Mallinson.</p>

<p>"Adolphe, don't give Mr. Mallinson any more wine," said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>"Fair play, fair play," said Jacob judicially. "Let a man get
drunk if he likes. That's Shakespeare, Cruttendon. I'm with you
there. Shakespeare had more guts than all these damned frogs put
together. 'Hang there like fruit my soul,'" he began quoting,
in a musical rhetorical voice, flourishing his wine-glass. "The
devil damn you black, you cream-faced loon!" he exclaimed as the
wine washed over the rim.</p>

<p>"'Hang there like fruit my soul,'" Cruttendon and Jacob both
began again at the same moment, and both burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Curse these flies," said Mallinson, flicking at his bald head.
"What do they take me for?"</p>

<p>"Something sweet-smelling," said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Cruttendon," said Jacob. "The fellow has no manners,"
he explained to Mallinson very politely. "Wants to cut people
off their drink. Look here. I want grilled bone. What's the French
for grilled bone? Grilled bone, Adolphe. Now you juggins, don't
you understand?"</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you, Flanders, the second most beautiful thing
in the whole of literature," said Cruttendon, bringing his feet
down on to the floor, and leaning right across the table, so that
his face almost touched Jacob's face.</p>

<p>"'Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,'" Mallinson interrupted,
strumming his fingers on the table. "The most ex-qui-sitely beautiful
thing in the whole of literature.... Cruttendon is a very good
fellow," he remarked confidentially. "But he's a bit of a fool."
And he jerked his head forward.</p>

<p>Well, not a word of this was ever told to Mrs. Flanders; nor
what happened when they paid the bill and left the restaurant,
and walked along the Boulevard Raspaille.</p>

<p>Then here is another scrap of conversation; the time about eleven
in the morning; the scene a studio; and the day Sunday.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Flanders," said Cruttendon, "I'd as soon have one
of Mallinson's little pictures as a Chardin. And when I say that
..." he squeezed the tail of an emaciated tube ... "Chardin was
a great swell.... He sells 'em to pay his dinner now. But wait
till the dealers get hold of him. A great swell&mdash;oh, a very great
swell."</p>

<p>"It's an awfully pleasant life," said Jacob, "messing away up
here. Still, it's a stupid art, Cruttendon." He wandered off across
the room. "There's this man, Pierre Louys now." He took up a book.</p>

<p>"Now my good sir, are you going to settle down?" said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>"That's a solid piece of work," said Jacob, standing a canvas
on a chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I did ages ago," said Cruttendon, looking over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty competent painter in my opinion," said Jacob
after a time.</p>

<p>"Now if you'd like to see what I'm after at the present moment,"
said Cruttendon, putting a canvas before Jacob. "There. That's
it. That's more like it. That's ..." he squirmed his thumb in
a circle round a lamp globe painted white.</p>

<p>"A pretty solid piece of work," said Jacob, straddling his legs
in front of it. "But what I wish you'd explain ..."</p>

<p>Miss Jinny Carslake, pale, freckled, morbid, came into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh Jinny, here's a friend. Flanders. An Englishman. Wealthy.
Highly connected. Go on, Flanders...."</p>

<p>Jacob said nothing.</p>

<p>"It's <em>THAT&mdash;</em>that's not right," said Jinny Carslake.</p>

<p>"No," said Cruttendon decidedly. "Can't be done."</p>

<p>He took the canvas off the chair and stood it on the floor with
its back to them.</p>

<p>"Sit down, ladies and gentlemen. Miss Carslake comes from your
part of the world, Flanders. From Devonshire. Oh, I thought you
said Devonshire. Very well. She's a daughter of the church too.
The black sheep of the family. Her mother writes her such letters.
I say&mdash;have you one about you? It's generally Sundays they come.
Sort of church-bell effect, you know."</p>

<p>"Have you met all the painter men?" said Jinny. "Was Mallinson
drunk? If you go to his studio he'll give you one of his pictures.
I say, Teddy...."</p>

<p>"Half a jiff," said Cruttendon. "What's the season of the year?"
He looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"We take a day off on Sundays, Flanders."</p>

<p>"Will he ..." said Jinny, looking at Jacob. "You ..."</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll come with us," said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>And then, here is Versailles. Jinny stood on the stone rim and
leant over the pond, clasped by Cruttendon's arms or she would
have fallen in. "There! There!" she cried. "Right up to the top!"
Some sluggish, sloping-shouldered fish had floated up from the
depths to nip her crumbs. "You look," she said, jumping down.
And then the dazzling white water, rough and throttled, shot up
into the air. The fountain spread itself. Through it came the
sound of military music far away. All the water was puckered with
drops. A blue air-ball gently bumped the surface. How all the
nurses and children and old men and young crowded to the edge,
leant over and waved their sticks! The little girl ran stretching
her arms towards her air-ball, but it sank beneath the fountain.</p>

<p>Edward Cruttendon, Jinny Carslake, and Jacob Flanders walked
in a row along the yellow gravel path; got on to the grass; so
passed under the trees; and came out at the summer-house where
Marie Antoinette used to drink chocolate. In went Edward and Jinny,
but Jacob waited outside, sitting on the handle of his walking-stick.
Out they came again.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Cruttendon, smiling at Jacob.</p>

<p>Jinny waited; Edward waited; and both looked at Jacob.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Jacob, smiling and pressing both hands on his stick.</p>

<p>"Come along," he decided; and started off. The others followed
him, smiling.</p>

<p>And then they went to the little cafe in the by-street where
people sit drinking coffee, watching the soldiers, meditatively
knocking ashes into trays.</p>

<p>"But he's quite different," said Jinny, folding her hands over
the top of her glass. "I don't suppose you know what Ted means
when he says a thing like that," she said, looking at Jacob. "But
I do. Sometimes I could kill myself. Sometimes he lies in bed
all day long&mdash;just lies there.... I don't want you right on the
table"; she waved her hands. Swollen iridescent pigeons were waddling
round their feet.</p>

<p>"Look at that woman's hat," said Cruttendon. "How do they come
to think of it? ... No, Flanders, I don't think I could live like
you. When one walks down that street opposite the British Museum&mdash;what's
it called?&mdash;that's what I mean. It's all like that. Those fat
women&mdash;and the man standing in the middle of the road as if he
were going to have a fit ..."</p>

<p>"Everybody feeds them," said Jinny, waving the pigeons away.
"They're stupid old things."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Jacob, smoking his cigarette. "There's
St. Paul's."</p>

<p>"I mean going to an office," said Cruttendon.</p>

<p>"Hang it all," Jacob expostulated.</p>

<p>"But you don't count," said Jinny, looking at Cruttendon. "You're
mad. I mean, you just think of painting."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. I can't help it. I say, will King George give way
about the peers?"</p>

<p>"He'll jolly well have to," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"There!" said Jinny. "He really knows."</p>

<p>"You see, I would if I could," said Cruttendon, "but I simply
can't."</p>

<p>"I <em>THINK I </em>could," said Jinny. "Only, it's all the people
one dislikes who do it. At home, I mean. They talk of nothing
else. Even people like my mother."</p>

<p>"Now if I came and lived here&#11834;" said Jacob. "What's my share,
Cruttendon? Oh, very well. Have it your own way. Those silly birds,
directly one wants them&mdash;they've flown away."</p>

<p>And finally under the arc lamps in the Gare des Invalides, with
one of those queer movements which are so slight yet so definite,
which may wound or pass unnoticed but generally inflict a good
deal of discomfort, Jinny and Cruttendon drew together; Jacob
stood apart. They had to separate. Something must be said. Nothing
was said. A man wheeled a trolley past Jacob's legs so near that
he almost grazed them. When Jacob recovered his balance the other
two were turning away, though Jinny looked over her shoulder,
and Cruttendon, waving his hand, disappeared like the very great
genius that he was.</p>

<p>No &mdash;Mrs. Flanders was told none of this, though Jacob felt,
it is safe to say, that nothing in the world was of greater importance;
and as for Cruttendon and Jinny, he thought them the most remarkable
people he had ever met&mdash;being of course unable to foresee how
it fell out in the course of time that Cruttendon took to painting
orchards; had therefore to live in Kent; and must, one would think,
see through apple blossom by this time, since his wife, for whose
sake he did it, eloped with a novelist; but no; Cruttendon still
paints orchards, savagely, in solitude. Then Jinny Carslake, after
her affair with Lefanu the American painter, frequented Indian
philosophers, and now you find her in pensions in Italy cherishing
a little jeweller's box containing ordinary pebbles picked off
the road. But if you look at them steadily, she says, multiplicity
becomes unity, which is somehow the secret of life, though it
does not prevent her from following the macaroni as it goes round
the table, and sometimes, on spring nights, she makes the strangest
confidences to shy young Englishmen.</p>

<p>Jacob had nothing to hide from his mother. It was only that he
could make no sense himself of his extraordinary excitement, and
as for writing it down&#11834;</p>

<p>"Jacob's letters are so like him," said Mrs. Jarvis, folding
the sheet.</p>

<p>"Indeed he seems to be having ..." said Mrs. Flanders, and paused,
for she was cutting out a dress and had to straighten the pattern,
"... a very gay time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis thought of Paris. At her back the window was open,
for it was a mild night; a calm night; when the moon seemed muffled
and the apple trees stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>"I never pity the dead," said Mrs. Jarvis, shifting the cushion
at her back, and clasping her hands behind her head. Betty Flanders
did not hear, for her scissors made so much noise on the table.</p>

<p>"They are at rest," said Mrs. Jarvis. "And we spend our days
doing foolish unnecessary things without knowing why."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis was not liked in the village.</p>

<p>"You never walk at this time of night?" she asked Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p>"It is certainly wonderfully mild," said Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p>Yet it was years since she had opened the orchard gate and gone
out on Dods Hill after dinner.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly dry," said Mrs. Jarvis, as they shut the orchard
door and stepped on to the turf.</p>

<p>"I shan't go far," said Betty Flanders. "Yes, Jacob will leave
Paris on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Jacob was always my friend of the three," said Mrs. Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, I am going no further," said Mrs. Flanders. They
had climbed the dark hill and reached the Roman camp.</p>

<p>The rampart rose at their feet&mdash;the smooth circle surrounding
the camp or the grave. How many needles Betty Flanders had lost
there; and her garnet brooch.</p>

<p>"It is much clearer than this sometimes," said Mrs. Jarvis, standing
upon the ridge. There were no clouds, and yet there was a haze
over the sea, and over the moors. The lights of Scarborough flashed,
as if a woman wearing a diamond necklace turned her head this
way and that.</p>

<p>"How quiet it is!" said Mrs. Jarvis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders rubbed the turf with her toe, thinking of her garnet
brooch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis found it difficult to think of herself to-night.
It was so calm. There was no wind; nothing racing, flying, escaping.
Black shadows stood still over the silver moors. The furze bushes
stood perfectly still. Neither did Mrs. Jarvis think of God. There
was a church behind them, of course. The church clock struck ten.
Did the strokes reach the furze bush, or did the thorn tree hear
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders was stooping down to pick up a pebble. Sometimes
people do find things, Mrs. Jarvis thought, and yet in this hazy
moonlight it was impossible to see anything, except bones, and
little pieces of chalk.</p>

<p>"Jacob bought it with his own money, and then I brought Mr. Parker
up to see the view, and it must have dropped&mdash;" Mrs. Flanders
murmured.</p>

<p>Did the bones stir, or the rusty swords? Was Mrs. Flanders's
twopenny-halfpenny brooch for ever part of the rich accumulation?
and if all the ghosts flocked thick and rubbed shoulders with
Mrs. Flanders in the circle, would she not have seemed perfectly
in her place, a live English matron, growing stout?</p>

<p>The clock struck the quarter.</p>

<p>The frail waves of sound broke among the stiff gorse and the
hawthorn twigs as the church clock divided time into quarters.</p>

<p>Motionless and broad-backed the moors received the statement
"It is fifteen minutes past the hour," but made no answer, unless
a bramble stirred.</p>

<p>Yet even in this light the legends on the tombstones could be
read, brief voices saying, "I am Bertha Ruck," "I am Tom Gage."
And they say which day of the year they died, and the New Testament
says something for them, very proud, very emphatic, or consoling.</p>

<p>The moors accept all that too.</p>

<p>The moonlight falls like a pale page upon the church wall, and
illumines the kneeling family in the niche, and the tablet set
up in 1780 to the Squire of the parish who relieved the poor,
and believed in God&mdash;so the measured voice goes on down the marble
scroll, as though it could impose itself upon time and the open
air.</p>

<p>Now a fox steals out from behind the gorse bushes.</p>

<p>Often, even at night, the church seems full of people. The pews
are worn and greasy, and the cassocks in place, and the hymn-books
on the ledges. It is a ship with all its crew aboard. The timbers
strain to hold the dead and the living, the ploughmen, the carpenters,
the fox-hunting gentlemen and the farmers smelling of mud and
brandy. Their tongues join together in syllabling the sharp-cut
words, which for ever slice asunder time and the broad-backed
moors. Plaint and belief and elegy, despair and triumph, but for
the most part good sense and jolly indifference, go trampling
out of the windows any time these five hundred years.</p>

<p>Still, as Mrs. Jarvis said, stepping out on to the moors, "How
quiet it is!" Quiet at midday, except when the hunt scatters across
it; quiet in the afternoon, save for the drifting sheep; at night
the moor is perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>A garnet brooch has dropped into its grass. A fox pads stealthily.
A leaf turns on its edge. Mrs. Jarvis, who is fifty years of age,
reposes in the camp in the hazy moonlight.</p>

<p>"... and," said Mrs. Flanders, straightening her back, "I never
cared for Mr. Parker."</p>

<p>"Neither did I," said Mrs. Jarvis. They began to walk home.</p>

<p>But their voices floated for a little above the camp. The moonlight
destroyed nothing. The moor accepted everything. Tom Gage cries
aloud so long as his tombstone endures. The Roman skeletons are
in safe keeping. Betty Flanders's darning needles are safe too
and her garnet brooch. And sometimes at midday, in the sunshine,
the moor seems to hoard these little treasures, like a nurse.
But at midnight when no one speaks or gallops, and the thorn tree
is perfectly still, it would be foolish to vex the moor with questions&mdash;what?
and why?</p>

<p>The church clock, however, strikes twelve.</p>
