<P>
The Duke's chef had served an Emperor with honor--the billiard
room at Devenham Castle was the most comfortable room upon earth.
The three men who sat together upon a huge divan, the three men
most powerful in directing the councils of their country, felt a
gentle wave of optimism stealing through their quickened blood.
Nevertheless this was a serious matter which occupied their
thoughts.
<P>
"We are becoming," the Prime Minister said, "much too modern. We
are becoming over-civilized out of any similitude to a nation of
men of blood and brawn."
<P>
"You are quoting some impossible person," Sir Edward Bransome
declared.
<P>
"One is always quoting unconsciously," the Prime Minister
admitted with a sigh. "What I mean is that five hundred years ago
we should have locked this young man up in a room hung with black
crape, and with a pleasant array of unfortunately extinct
instruments we should have succeeded, beyond a doubt, in
extorting the truth from him."
<P>
"And if the truth were not satisfactory?" the Duke asked,
lighting a cigar.
<P>
"We should have endeavored to change his point of view," the
Prime Minister continued, "even if we had to change at the same
time the outline of his particularly graceful figure. The age of
thumbscrews and the rack was, after all, a very virile age. Just
consider for a moment our positions--three of the greatest and
most brilliant statesmen of our day--and we can do very little
save wait for this young man to declare himself. We are the
puppets with whom he plays. It rests with him whether our names
are written upon the scroll of fame or whether our administration
is dismissed in half a dozen contemptuous words by the coming
historian. It rests with him whether our friend Bransome here
shall be proclaimed the greatest Foreign Minister that ever
breathed, and whether I myself have a statue erected to me in
Westminster Yard, which shall be crowned with a laurel wreath by
patriotic young ladies on the morning of my anniversary."
<P>
The Duke stretched himself out with a sigh of content. His cigar
was burning well, and the flavor of old Armignac lingered still
upon his palate.
<P>
"Come," he protested, "I think you exaggerate Maiyo's importance
just a little, Haviland. Hesho seems excellently disposed towards
us, and, after all, I should have thought his word would have had
more weight in Tokio than the word of a young man who is new to
diplomacy, and whose claims to distinction seem to rest rather
upon his soldiering and the fact that he is a cousin of the
Emperor."
<P>
The Prime Minister sighed.
<P>
"Dear Duke," he said, "no one of us, not even myself, has ever
done that young man justice. To me he represents everything that
is most strenuous and intellectual in Japanese manhood. The
spirit of that wonderful country runs like the elixir of life
itself through his veins. Since the day he brought me his letter
from the Emperor, I have watched him carefully, and I believe I
can honestly declare that not once in these eighteen months has
he looked away from his task, nor has he given to one single
person even an inkling of the thoughts which have passed through
his mind. He came back from the Continent, from Berlin, from
Paris, from Petersburg, with a mass of acquired information which
would have made some of our blue-books read like Hans Andersen's
Fairy Tales. He had made up his mind exactly what he thought of
each country, of their political systems, of their social life,
of their military importance. He had them all weighed up in the
hollow of his hand. He was willing to talk as long as I, for
instance, was willing to listen. He spoke of everybody whom he
had met and every place which he had visited without reserve, and
yet I guarantee that there is no person in England today, however
much he may have talked with him, who knows in the least what his
true impressions are."
<P>
"Haviland is right," Bransome agreed. "Many a time I have caught
myself wondering, when he talks so easily about his travels, what
the real thoughts are which lie at the back of his brain. We
know, of course, what the object of those travels was. He went as
no tourist. He went with a deep and solemn purpose always before
him. He went to find out whether there was any other European
Power whose alliance would be a more advantageous thing for Japan
than a continuation of their alliance with us. Such a thing has
never been mentioned or hinted at between us, but we know it all
the same."
<P>
"I wonder," the Duke remarked, "whether we shall really get the
truth out of him before he goes."
<P>
The Prime Minister shook his head.
<P>
"Look at him now teaching old Lady Saunderson how to hold her
cue. He singled her out because she was the least attractive
person playing, because no one took any particular notice of her,
and every one seemed disposed to let her go her own way! Those
girls were all buzzing around him as though he were something
holy, but you see how gently he eluded them! Watch what an
interest she is taking in the game now. He has been encouraging
the poor old lady until her last few shots have been quite good.
That is Maiyo all the world over. I will wager that he is
thinking of nothing on earth at this moment but of making that
poor old lady feel at her ease and enjoy her game. A stranger,
looking on, would imagine him to be just a kind-hearted,
simple-minded fellow. Yet there is not one of us three who has
wit enough to get a single word from him against his will. You
shall see. There is an excellent opportunity here. I suppose both
of you read his speech at the Herrick Club last night?"
<P>
<P>
I did," the Duke answered.
<P>
"And I," Bransome echoed. "It seemed to me that he spoke a little
more freely than usual."
<P>
"He went as near to censure as I have ever heard him when
speaking of any of the institutions of our country," the Prime
Minister declared. "I will ask him about it directly we get the
chance. You shall see how he will evade the point."
<P>
"You will have to be quick if you mean to get hold of him," the
Duke remarked. "See, the game is over and there he goes with
Penelope."
<P>
The Prime Minister rose to his feet and intercepted them on their
way to the door.
<P>
"Miss Morse," he said, "may we ransom the Prince? We want to talk
to him."
<P>
"Do you insinuate," she laughed, "that he is a captive of mine?"
<P>
"We are all captives of Miss Morse's," Bransome said with a bow,
"and all enemies of Somerfield's."
<P>
Somerfield, hearing his name, came up to them. The Duchess, too,
strolled over to the fire. The Prime Minister and Bransome
returned with Maiyo towards the corner of the room where they had
been sitting.
<P>
"Prince," the Prime Minister said, "we have been talking about
your speech at the Herrick Club last night."
<P>
The Prince smiled a little gravely.
<P>
"Did I say too much?" he asked. "It all came as a surprise to
me--the toast and everything connected with it. I saw my name
down to reply, and it seemed discourteous of me not to speak.
But, as yet, I do not altogether understand these functions. I
did not altogether understand, for instance, how much I might say
and how much I ought to leave unsaid."
<P>
""We have read what you said," Bransome remarked. "What we should
like to hear, if I may venture to say so, is what you left
unsaid."
<P>
The Prince for a moment was thoughtful. Perhaps he remembered
that the days had passed when it was necessary for him to keep so
jealously his own counsel. Perhaps his natural love of the truth
triumphed. He felt a sudden longing to tell these people who had
been kind to him the things which he had seen amongst them, the
things which only a stranger coming fresh to the country could
perhaps fully comprehend.
<P>
"What I said was of little importance," the Prince remarked, "but
I felt myself placed in a very difficult position. Before I knew
what to expect, I was listening to a glorification of the arms of
my country at the expense of Russia. I was being hailed as one of
a nation who possess military genius which had not been equalled
since the days of Hannibal and Caesar. Many things of that sort
were said, many things much too kind, many things which somehow
it grieved me to listen to. And when I stood up to reply, I felt
that the few words which I must say would sound, perhaps,
ungracious, but they must be said. It was one of those occasions
which seemed to call for the naked truth."
<P>
Penelope and the Duchess had joined the little group.
<P>
"May we stay?" the former asked. "I read every word of your
speech," she added, turning to the Prince. "Do tell us why you
spoke so severely, what it was that you objected to so strongly
in General Ennison's remarks?"
<P>
The Prince turned earnestly towards her.
<P>
"My dear young lady," he said, "all that I objected to was this
over-glorification of the feats of arms accomplished by us.
People over here did not understand. On the one side were the
great armies of Russia,--men drawn, all of them, from the ranks
of the peasant, men of low nerve force, men who were not many
degrees better than animals. They came to fight against us
because it was their business to fight, because for fighting they
drew their scanty pay, their food, and their drink, and the
clothes they wore. They fought because if they refused they faced
the revolver bullets of their officers,--men like themselves, who
also fought because it was their profession, because it was in
the traditions of their family, but who would, I think, have very
much preferred disporting themselves in the dancing halls of
their cities, drinking champagne with the ladies of their choice,
or gambling with cards. I do not say that these were not brave
men, all of them. I myself saw them face death by the hundreds,
but the lust of battle was in their veins then, the taste of
blood upon their palates. We do not claim to be called world
conquerors because we overcame these men. If one could have seen
into the hearts of our own soldiers as they marched into battle,
and seen also into the hearts of those others who lay there
sullenly waiting, one would not have wondered then. There was,
indeed, nothing to wonder at. What we cannot make you understand
over here is that every Japanese soldier who crept across the
bare plains or lay stretched in the trenches, who loaded his
rifle and shot and killed and waited for death,--every man felt
something beating in his heart which those others did not feel.
We have no great army, Mr. Haviland, but what we have is a great
nation who have things beating in their heart the knowledge of
which seems somehow to have grown cold amongst you Western
people. The boy is born with it; it is there in his very soul, as
dear to him as the little home where he lives, the blossoming
trees under which he plays. It leads him to the rifle and the
drill ground as naturally as the boys of your country turn to the
cricket fields and the football ground. Over here you call that
spirit patriotism. It was something which beat in the heart of
every one of those hundreds of thousands of men, something which
kept their eyes clear and bright as they marched into battle,
which made them look Death itself in the face, and fight even
while the blackness crept over them. You see, your own people
have so many interests, so many excitements, so much to distract.
With us it is not so. In the heart of the Japanese comes the love
of his parents, the love of his wife and children, and, deepest,
perhaps, of all the emotions he knows, the strong magnificent
background to his life, the love of the country which bore him,
which shelters them. It is for his home he fights, for his simple
joys amongst those who are dear to him, for the great mysterious
love of the Motherland. Forgive me if I have expressed myself
badly, have repeated myself often. It is a matter which I find it
so hard to talk about, so hard here to make you understand."
<P>
"But you must not think, Prince, that we over here are wholly
lacking in that same instinct," the Duke said. "Remember our
South African war, and the men who came to arms and rallied round
the flag when their services were needed."
<P>
"I do remember that," the Prince answered. "I wish that I could
speak of it in other terms. Yet it seems to me that I must speak
as I find things. You say that the men came to arms. They did,
but how? Untrained, unskilled in carrying weapons, they rushed
across the seas to be the sport of the farmers who cut them off
or shot them down, to be a hindrance in the way of the
mercenaries who fought for you. Yes, you say they rallied to the
call! What brought them? Excitement, necessity, necessities of
their social standing, bravado, cheap heroism--any one of these.
But I tell you that patriotism as we understand it is a deeper
thing. In the land where it flourishes there is no great
pre-eminence in what you call sports or games. It does not come
like a whirlwind on the wings of disaster. It grows with the
limbs and the heart of the boy, grows with his muscles and his
brawn. It is part of his conscience, part of his religion. As he
realizes that he has a country of his own to protect, a dear,
precious heritage come down to him through countless ages, so he
learns that it is his sacred duty to know how to do his share in
defending it. The spare time of our youth, Mr. Haviland, is spent
learning to shoot, to scout, to bear hardships, to acquire the
arts of war. I tell you that there was not one general who went
with our troops to Manchuria, but a hundred thousand. We have no
great army. We are a nation of men whose religion it is to fight
when their country's welfare is threatened."
<P>
There was a short silence. The Prime Minister and Bransome
exchanged rapid glances.
<P>
"These, then," Penelope said slowly, "were the things you left
unsaid."
<P>
The Prince raised his hand a little--a deprecatory gesture.
<P>
"Perhaps even now," he said, "it was scarcely courteous of me to
say them, only I know that they come to you as no new thing.
There are many of your countrymen who are speaking to you now in
the Press as I, a stranger, have spoken. Sometimes it is harder
to believe one of your own family. That is why I have dared to
say so much,--I, a foreigner, eager and anxious only to observe
and to learn. I think, perhaps, that it is to such that the truth
comes easiest."
<P>
Of a purpose, the three men who were there said nothing. The
Prince offered Penelope his arm.
<P>
"I will not be disappointed," he said. "You promised that you
would show me the palm garden. I have talked too much."
