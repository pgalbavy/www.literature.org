<p>"Aunt Maria, will you let me make some molasses taffy? Monday
is Carrie's birthday and I haven't anything else to send her.
She always gives me something on my birthday. I will be real careful
and clean up everything when I am through."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you can try it, though I hate to have you messing
around while I am getting your father's things ready for his trip."</p>

<p>"I won't mess, truly, Aunt Maria," and thankful at receiving
even this grudging permission, she flew out into the tiny kitchen
to the pleasant task of candy-making, reciting, as she rattled
among the pots and pans:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Lars Porsena of Clusium,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Nine Gods he swore<br/>
That the great house of Tarquin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should suffer wrong no more.

</p>
</div>
<p>One cup of molasses, one cup of sugar&mdash;that molasses looks awfully
black; I wonder if the taffy will be dark. I like the light-colored
best.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
'Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the speed ye may;<br/>
I, with two more to help me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hold the foe in play.'

</p>
</div>
<p>A lump of butter and a tablespoon of vinegar. How pretty the
stuff looks boiling up higher and higher every minute. Hm, but
it's hot work bending over this stove.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Four hundred trumpets sounded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A peal of warlike glee,<br/>
As that great host, with measured tread,<br/>
And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,<br/>
Rolled slowly toward the bridge's head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where stood the dauntless Three.

</p>
</div>
<p>My! I would like to have been there and watched them. Isn't Horatius
a splendid name! And Herminius&mdash;isn't it grand! But they are like
Dionysius, no one ever uses them nowadays. I believe that candy
is almost done. It is brittle when I put it into water.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Round turned he, as not deigning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those craven ranks to see;<br/>
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sextus naught spake he."

</p>
</div>
<p>She seized the kettle of boiling syrup and lifted it off the
stove, still speaking the impassioned lines of that stirring poem,
and gesticulating wildly, heedless of the utensils in her hands.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"So he spake, and speaking sheathed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good sword by his side,<br/>
&nbsp;And with his harness on his back,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plunged headlong in the tide."

</p>
</div>
<p>Bang! went the kettle against a chair-back, and the seething,
bubbling mess of sticky brown syrup poured in a flood over furniture,
girl and floor, and trickled in a rivulet around the brim of her
father's hat carelessly laid on the table while he wrestled with
a refractory buckle on his grip, packed ready for his departure.
A gasp of dismay escaped her lips, and Tabitha stood aghast in
the midst of the ruin.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!" exclaimed the aunt, appearing that moment in
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!" echoed the father, looking up at the sound of
the crash. "I never saw such carelessness in my life. Look at
that hat! My best, too!"</p>

<p>"You needn't have left it on the table; that's no place for your
wardrobe," burst out the indignant Tabitha, sucking one blistered
finger, and frantically shaking her foot where the hot drops of
syrup had clung and burned.</p>

<p>Her unfortunate words were like oil to a flame.</p>

<p>"I'll have none of your impertinence, young lady," cried the
irate father, seizing her by the shoulder none too gently and
giving her a shake. "You deserve to be trounced."</p>

<p>Tabitha's heart stood still. The day of the licking had come
at last! He looked around for a stick, but the woodbox contained
nothing but heavy billets, and her sentence might have been suspended
had his eyes not rested upon his house slippers still lying in
the middle of the floor where he had thrown them upon discovering
that fussy Aunt Maria had packed them among his belongings for
his journey to the east. Grabbing one of these, he struck the
trembling girl half a dozen light blows across the shoulders,
and then dropped it, ashamed of himself and startled at the frightened,
pleading look in the black eyes raised to his in mute appeal.
As the first blow descended, the terror in the thin face gave
way to anger, intense, unreasoning; but she stood like a statue,
silent and dry-eyed, until the slipper fell from her father's
hands and he pushed her from him, saying sternly,</p>

<p>"What have you to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>She wheeled and looked at him with scornful eyes; then without
a word of reply, gathered up both slippers from the floor, walked
deliberately to the stove and threw them into the bed of live
coals before either father or aunt could prevent.</p>

<p>"There, Lynne Maximilian Catt!" she exclaimed in a voice tense
with passion, "you will never use that pair to larrup me with
again."</p>

<p>He looked at her in silent amazement, and the rage died in his
heart. She was the image of him. How could he blame her for displaying
the passions that he himself had not learned to control? He turned
back to his satchel on the floor and she, surprised that no further
punishment followed her open rebellion, rushed away to her room,
dribbling taffy as she ran.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, Mrs. Vane's rule doesn't work at all," she moaned,
nursing her blistered fingers and smarting foot, heedless of the
molasses trickling down the front of her dress. "I never remember
to count ten, and I suppose if I did get that far, I would let
the hateful words fly after them. It is just like me. That is
what comes of being a Catt! If I only had a different name maybe
it would be easier; but with a whole cat name, how is anyone going
to keep from scratching?"</p>

<p>The hot tears came, and for a long time she lay sobbing into
the fat pillow which had seen so many floods of this kind that
it had grown very much accustomed to it.</p>

<p>She heard the door open and shut and her father's footsteps died
away in the distance. He had gone without another word to her;
but then this was nothing unusual. He never said good-by to anyone
when he left home&mdash;that is, he had never done so but once. When
he had started on his last trip, he had waved his hand to her,
and called, "Good-by, Tabitha. Be a good girl." She had been startled
at the unexpected words, and little thrills of joy had crept through
her heart every time she thought of them. They were one of the
hoarded treasures in her memory book, and she had hoped he would
always remember to wave a farewell when he went away again. Now
she had made him angry. Well, he had made her angry, too. She
didn't intend to spill the candy; he ought to know that; but he
had struck her. She was twelve years old now and this was the
first licking. She had dreaded it all her life; and was just beginning
to think she had grown beyond the age of whippings when the dreadful
punishment had befallen her. No, it didn't hurt much, the blows
were not heavy enough for that, but the ignominy of it!</p>

<p>Why couldn't her father be like Carrie's? When he had waved his
hand at her, she had thought maybe in time he might become like
Mr. Carson, and now he had punished her with the licking that
had threatened her ever since she could remember. She hated him!</p>

<p>"But I was impudent," she told herself as her fierce anger abated
somewhat. "I needn't have said anything about his hat. Maybe then
he wouldn't have struck me at all. Perhaps if I had said I was
sorry and had cleaned up his hat again, he would have waved good-by
to me. Perhaps&mdash;<em>just</em> perhaps he might have kissed me
as Carrie's father does. But I suppose it would be too soon to
expect kisses."</p>

<p>"Tabitha, have you gone to bed?" It was Aunt Maria's voice nervous
and shaking.</p>

<p>"Not yet. What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you would just as soon sleep in Tom's room tonight.
There's a band of gypsies camping a little way up the road, and
I don't like the idea of us two women folks being left alone all
night. I tried to get Max to stay until morning, but he said he
couldn't make connections if he did. I don't suppose there is
anything to be afraid of, but this is our first night without
a man in the house, and I am as nervous as a witch." This was
a long speech for Aunt Maria, but she had a bad attack of the
fidgets, and found relief in words.</p>

<p>Tabitha had forgotten that her father's departure would mean
she and Aunt Maria must stay alone on the desert, for Tom had
gone away to college ten days before; and now at her aunt's words
she felt a little tremor of fear pass over her. She had never
quite outgrown the feeling of oppression these black nights on
the desert gave her, for the hills shut out the lights of town,
and Carson's house was the only tenanted one near them. Somewhere
she had heard that a man had died in the other little cottage
in their neighborhood which had stood vacant ever since their
arrival at Silver Bow, and it was even hinted that his ghost had
come back to haunt it. True, she had never seen anything to warrant
her believing these stories, but she stood in awful dread of that
house beyond them; so she was only too glad for her aunt's suggestion
that she sleep in Tom's bed.</p>

<p>Trying to put these things out of her mind and to think of more
cheerful subjects, she gathered up her belongings, and crept into
the little box-like room, hardly big enough to turn around in,
saying in reassuring tones to Aunt Maria,</p>

<p>"Of course there is nothing to be afraid of. Those campers aren't
gypsies, but a lot of prospectors, and I think they moved on after
they had cooked supper. At least, I saw them going towards town,
horses and all. I reckon they had to lay in some more supplies
and so camped near the stores to get an early start in the morning."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish there was a man in the house. I never did like
to stay alone at night, and this desert is the blackest place
I ever got into. I don't believe I shall ever get used to it."</p>

<p>"You aren't alone. I'm here, and I'm past twelve. There isn't
anything to hurt us, and we haven't anything that robbers would
want if they should come along. Thieves would know better than
to visit a desert town, Aunt Maria."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the woman's nervous terror found an echo in Tabitha's
heart, and instead of undressing, she exchanged her soiled dress
for a fresh one, removed her shoes, and climbed into bed with
her clothes on. For a long time she lay tossing on the unfamiliar
couch, listening to the night sounds without, and the hideous
brays of the wandering burros; but at last she fell into an uneasy
slumber, and dreamed that she had gone away to boarding school,
but instead of having Carrie for a playmate, her companions were
two blazing shoes who kept offering her molasses taffy out of
her father's hat. She awoke with a start, trembling in every limb,
and frightened at her strange surroundings. Then she remembered
how she came to be there, and lay down again on her pillow; but
she could not sleep.</p>

<p>In the distance she heard the sound of a dog's insistent barking,
and was annoyed by the plaintive howls. She stopped her ears but
could not shut out the sound, and in desperation she sat up and
looked out of the window, wishing that morning would dawn.</p>

<p>The night was very dark, but the starlight seemed to break the
heavy blackness that hung like a pall over the landscape. Off
toward the horizon, in the direction of the dog's barking was
a faint glimmer of wavering light, and Tabitha watched it idly
for a moment, wondering if there were campers in that little hollow,
too. Then the light grew brighter and more flickering, the barking
more frantic, and Tabitha started up in terror.</p>

<p>"It's the hermit's house on fire! What can I do? Neither Tom
nor Dad is here to give the alarm, and town is so far away."</p>

<p>She flew out of bed and to the dresser where her father's pistol
was kept, lifted the ugly weapon from its case and mechanically
cocked it. Tom had taught her to use a rifle, but she had never
been allowed to handle a revolver, though she had watched him
so often that she was familiar with its mechanism, and had no
thought of fear as she sped fleetly out of the house, pausing
only long enough to slip on her sticky shoes.</p>

<p>Bang, bang, bang! went the gun in rapid succession; bang, bang,
bang! Six times the report rang sharply through the still night
air,&mdash;the signal of fire in this little desert town. Then tossing
the empty pistol aside, she ran down the road as fast as her feet
would carry her, all her terror of the night swept away in the
one idea that the townspeople might be too late to help the old
man if he should happen to be in the burning house. She never
stopped to wonder what aid she, a child of twelve, could render,
she never thought of arousing Mr. Carson, but stumbled breathlessly
on in the darkness toward the shack now burning merrily.</p>

<p>Somewhere behind her she heard a second revolver alarm; then
someone passed her in the road, and a man's voice called, "Go
home, Tabitha. This is no place for you." But still she kept on,
having scarcely heard the words, and hardly aware that other help
than her own feeble strength was at hand.</p>

<p>That was a night she never forgot. In these desert mining towns
where water costs a dollar a barrel and the system of piping it
into the houses is yet in its infancy, fire is not an easy thing
to fight, and many a time the whole camp has been destroyed before
the conflagration could be checked or would burn itself out. The
hermit's hut, however, was so isolated that the town was in no
danger, even from the flying sparks, but there was not a drop
of water to throw on the flames, and the roads were too steep
and rough for the volunteer fire department to drag their chemicals
to the rescue.</p>

<p>So the little shack burned to the ground, but Mr. Carson and
Tabitha arrived in time to pull the lone occupant to safety, though
it was a close call for the old miner, for he was almost suffocated
with the smoke and his head and hands were badly burned.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson, too, suffered from his buffeting with the flames,
but Tabitha came out unscathed, and when the men from town arrived,
hatless and anxious, they found the child helping the brave superintendent
in his efforts to revive the unconscious hermit, while the little
yellow cur whined in terror at their feet, and the blaze of the
burning house mounted high in the heavens.</p>

<p>Dr. Vane was among the crowd, and he quietly took charge of the
patient, easing his suffering and binding up his wounds as best
he could while someone went for a rig that the injured man might
be carried back to town more easily.</p>

<p>"Now, put some of that stuff on Mr. Carson's hands," commanded
Tabitha, who had watched the proceedings with interest, holding
bandages and passing ointments under the physician's directions.
"His are all scorched, too."</p>

<p>"How are your own?" someone asked her, noticing how drawn and
white her face was in the lurid glare.</p>

<p>"I did that making candy last evening," she answered, displaying
her blistered fingers, now raw and sore. "I forgot all about them."</p>

<p>Overcome by excitement, weariness and pain, she let the doctor
gather her in his strong arms, and the proud citizens of Silver
Bow bore their little heroine triumphantly home.</p>
