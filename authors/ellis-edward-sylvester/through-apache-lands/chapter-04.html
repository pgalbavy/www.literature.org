<p>"I'll match them Apaches agin the world for shrewd deviltry,"
exclaimed Hardynge, unable to suppress his admiration even in
the moment which told him of his own increased personal danger.
"By some hook or crook, the Old Boy only knows what, they've found
out my game, and are after me. Ah! if I only had my mustang, Thundergust,
with me!"</p>

<p>Tom now changed his direction more to the north, his intention
being to strike the river much sooner than was his original purpose.
It was the only thing he could do to escape the redskins, who
showed such a wonderful skill in following him up.</p>

<p>As near as he could judge, something like ten miles still intervened
between him and the friendly stream&mdash;a distance which he was confident
of passing before daylight, if he did not find his pursuers in
his path. The greatest care was necessary to keep out of the way
of these creatures, and the fugitive had run but a short distance
when he paused and applied his ear to the ground again. Only for
an instant, however, when he bounded up and was off like a shot.
The alarming sounds came to his ear with such distinctness as
to prove that the Apaches were close at hand. Guided by some strange
fatality, they were bearing directly down upon him at full speed.
More than all, those pattering footfalls were such as to indicate
that the swarthy horsemen were not approaching in a compact group.
They had separated so as to cover a wide area of ground, and were
advancing in such an array that the difficulty of escape was increased
tenfold. Everything conspired against poor Tom. The bright moonlight,
the broad level stretch of plain, the fact that he was on foot,
and his pursuers, besides being well mounted, were among the most
skillful riders of the Southwest, made his situation about as
desperate as it is possible to imagine.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the fugitive paused again, but this time
it was not necessary that he should apply his ear to the ground.
The sounds of the mustangs' hoofs came to him very plainly through
the midnight air, and as he looked around he half expected to
see the shadowy figures of the horsemen plunging forward in the
gloom toward him! Nothing was to be seen, however, of them, and,
feeling that the situation was becoming desperate, he changed
his course again, his purpose being simply to get by the approaching
marauders without caring in what direction he went. Had he been
five minutes earlier he might have succeeded, but he was just
that much too late.</p>

<p>He was stealing forward in his cautious manner, with the sound
of the horses' hoofs growing more distinct every second, when,
sure enough, the figure of an Indian horseman suddenly came in
sight, bearing down upon him as straight as an arrow. The very
instant Tom saw it he sank down upon his face, scarcely daring
to hope that his pursuer would pass him, and prepared for whatever
he chose to do.</p>

<p>The scout turned his head so that he could watch every movement
and guard against it, his hand being extended beneath his body
in the most natural position possible, but grasping his loaded
revolver.</p>

<p>It may have been that the Apache would have gone by but for the
action of his mustang. These intelligent animals seem to know,
in many cases, far more than their masters, and the one in question
was yet some yards distant from the prostrate form, when he halted
with a snort. This opened the ball, and the scout anxiously awaited
the fight which seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Indian party had separated to such an extent
that no others were in sight of the fugitive, who thus had but
a single man to contend against, although there was no question
but what any number of others could be summoned to the spot in
a twinkling. The foeman understood the situation at a glance;
that is, he knew that the man for whom he was seeking was prostrate
upon the ground before him, but he had no means of judging whether
he was dead, asleep, or feigning. Under these circumstances he
advanced very cautiously, his mustang betraying considerable reluctance
at walking up to a man stretched out at full length.</p>

<p>This was precisely what Hardynge desired, as every minute that
matters remained in <em>statu quo</em> placed the friends of his
adversary further away and simplified the encounter, which he
considered as certain to take place.</p>

<p>Something like ten minutes were occupied in this stealthy advance
of the horse, at the end of which time he stood so that his head
was directly over the shoulders of the prostrate man, who still
lay as motionless as a statue.</p>

<p>"Hooh!" exclaimed the rider, holding himself ready for any demonstration
upon the part of the suspected white man. But the latter never
stirred, although he shivered a little at the fear that the mustang
might place his hoof upon him.</p>

<p>Tom's peculiar peril will be understood when it is stated that
the Apache was master of the situation from the instant they came
in sight of each other. Had the fugitive fired at him the moment
he caught sight of his horse, he might have tumbled him to the
ground, but it would have brought the rest of the party around
him in an instant. As matters now stood, the Apache would have
fired at the first movement he made, no matter how dexterous,
to draw his hand from beneath his body, and so Tom bided his time.</p>

<p>"Hooh!"</p>

<p>This was repeated several times, when the warrior tried to force
his mustang to step upon him; but the animal was too timid to
be forced into doing such a repugnant thing, and, when angrily
urged thereto, leaped clear of the body with a sniff of terror,
and galloped several rods before he could be brought round and
compelled to face the unknown again. This seemed to convince the
Apache that the man was dead, and without any further hesitation
he slid down from the back of his horse, and advanced to the figure
for the purpose of scalping him.</p>

<p>He had just stooped down, knife in hand, when the form turned
like a flash. There came a blinding flash, then a report and a
cry, almost together, and Tom Hardynge seemed to leap up from
the ground as if a bomb had exploded beneath him, and, dashing
toward the mustang, seized his rein and vaulted upon his back
before the animal really knew what had taken place.</p>

<p>It was a daring deed, but it succeeded to perfection. The scout
had not only extinguished his foe, but had captured his horse
as well. The sound of the pistol might reach the ears of other
Apaches, but he cared nothing for that. He was as well mounted
as they, and, with the start which he had gained, they were welcome
to do all they could. In view of this, it was impossible for him
to restrain his exultation, and the moment he realized that he
was fairly astride of the mustang he let out a shout that might
have been heard a mile away. The steed which bore him was an excellent
one, and he had no fear of being overtaken by any of them. He
knew in what direction to take his flight, and away he sped with
his horse upon a dead run. He scarcely drew rein until daylight
broke over the prairie, when he found himself pursuing a direction
parallel with the river, and making good headway toward the point
where he hoped his own matchless Thundergust was awaiting him.</p>

<p>Hardynge scarcely halted during the greater portion of the next
day, except when his mustang required it, and shortly after the
sun crossed the meridian he was gratified at catching sight of
the rolling prairie and wooded hills where he had turned his horse
loose nearly a week before. While at a distance he gave utterance
to several sharp whistles, which produced the response he desired,
the beautiful glossy mustang galloping forth to meet him with
every appearance of delight. The creature had taken good care
of himself during his absence, having feasted upon the rich, succulent
grass, and was in the best possible condition.</p>

<p>Turning the Indian horse loose Tom bestowed no further attention
upon him, but leaped upon his favorite animal and galloped away
to the rocks where he had carefully concealed his saddle and riding
gear and where they had lain untouched while he was gone.</p>

<p>Just as he dismounted, his eye rested upon a piece of dried buffalo-skin
which was pinned against a tree, the inner side turned outward.
The first glance told him there was something unusual, and his
curiosity led him to approach and scan it closely. There was some
writing scrawled upon it, which he read with little difficulty.
The words were startling enough, and as the hunter finished them
he exclaimed, in a frightened undertone:</p>

<p>"Thunderation! can it be possible?"</p>
