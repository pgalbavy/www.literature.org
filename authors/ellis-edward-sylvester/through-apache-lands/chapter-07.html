<p>The stage which left Santa Fe on that beautiful spring morning,
bound for Fort Havens on the journey heretofore referred to, carried
two passengers. One was Corporal Hugg, a soldier who had been
engaged a dozen years upon the plains&mdash;a rough, good-natured,
chivalrous fellow, who, having lost a leg in the service of his
country, enjoyed a pension, and had become a sort of family servant
in the employ of Colonel Chadmund. He was devotedly attached to
little Ned and his greatest delight was in watching or joining
him at play, exercising a surveillance over him something like
that which a great, shaggy Newfoundland holds over a pet child.
The corporal was able to stump about upon his cork leg, and when
the time came for the lad to make the journey through the mountains
to Fort Havens&mdash;a journey which he had been looking impatiently
forward to for fully a year&mdash;it followed as a natural sequence
that the corporal should bear him company.</p>

<p>Ned bade his mother an affectionate good-bye, and she pressed
him to her breast again and again, the tears filling her eyes,
and a sad misgiving chilling her heart. The reports at the time
were that the Indians to the southwest were unusually quiet, no
word having yet reached the capital of New Mexico of the formidable
raids that were being organized in the Apache country. Besides
this, the stage, which was properly an ambulance, drawn by a single
powerful horse, was escorted by twelve Indian fighters armed to
the teeth, every one of whom had performed similar duty before,
and so, according to all human probabilities, there seemed to
be less cause than usual for fear. Yet the mother felt a woeful
sinking of the heart, natural, perhaps, under the circumstances;
but she could not break the promise of herself and husband to
the boy, who was overflowing with joy at the prospect of that
long journey through the mountains, and a several months' sojourn
at the fort in the far Southwest.</p>

<p>Finally, the cavalcade lost sight of Santa Fe, and the first
night they encamped a good distance away from that historic, then
primitive, town. The lieutenant who had charge of the escort was
more concerned about the treasure in their possession than he
was about the Indians. So far as possible, the fact that he was
carrying a large sum of money to one of the frontier posts had
been kept a secret from the general public; but he was apprehensive
that they might be followed by some of the desperate characters
which infested Santa Fe at that time. But nothing of danger or
lawlessness was seen during their first day and night, and when
they resumed their journey on the morrow, they began to dismiss
all thoughts of danger from that direction.</p>

<p>As they progressed toward Arizona, the country gradually grew
wilder and more rugged, but the trail was followed without trouble,
and when they encamped the second night, they had the satisfaction
of reflecting that they had progressed much further than they
had counted upon at first.</p>

<p>Those were days of delight and happiness to young Ned Chadmund.
The weather was not oppressively warm, and the ever-changing scenery
was like the most entrancing panorama passing before his eyes.
Sometimes he rode upon one of the horses with the lieutenant or
one of the soldiers. Then again he ran along-side the ambulance
until he was tired, when he climbed within, and seated himself
beside Corporal Hugg, and listened to his tales of battle and
adventures.</p>

<p>On the second day the Indians began to show themselves. A party
of horsemen would be seen upon the top of some hill or bluff,
apparently contemplating the little cavalcade, or they would circle
around at a distance upon the prairie, whooping and indulging
in all sorts of tantalizing gestures, in the hope of drawing out
a portion of the party in pursuit. Their hearts' delight would
have been to get them into some exposed position, where they could
be cut off to a man&mdash;and had the cavalry been unaccustomed to
border life, the artifice would have succeeded; but they were
not to be seduced to their ruin by any such transparent stratagem.</p>

<p>Now and then these redskins, a number of Comanches, sent in a
rifle ball or two by way of reminding the cavalry that they were
accustomed to that business. The lieutenant commanding permitted
his men to reply occasionally, but no thought of pursuit was entertained.
None of the soldiers were injured by these shots, although a number
passed uncomfortably close, and the ambulance was pierced several
times.</p>

<p>At one time Corporal Hugg checked his horse, and pointing his
gun out of the stage, took deliberate aim at the nearest redskin,
who was displaying his horsemanship by shooting from beneath the
neck and belly of his mustang, and then, as the latter wheeled,
flopping upon the other side of the animal, and firing as before.
The corporal held his fire until he attempted one of these turn-overs,
when he pulled the trigger and "took him on the wing." The result
was a whoop, a beating of the air with a pair of moccasined feet,
and the mustang galloped away without a rider.</p>

<p>This skillful shot was a good thing for the party, as it taught
the Comanches the very lesson they needed. They instantly retreated
to a further point upon the prairie, and finally vanished from
view altogether.</p>

<p>The company had been on the road for nearly a week. Six of them,
including the lieutenant, were riding at the head, and the remainder
were in the rear of the ambulance. Corporal Hugg was holding the
reins of his horse, who was stepping along with his heavy, ponderous
tread, while the driver was drowsy and indolent from the long,
monotonous ride in which he had been engaged for so many days,
and for so many hours during this last day. It was near the middle
of the afternoon, and Ned Chadmund was the only one of the company
that seemed to be full of life and spirits. He had run along by
the side of the vehicle, until he was pretty well jaded; he had
crawled in again, and was chatting away to the corporal in a fashion
that left no room for his giving way to drowsiness. The men sat
like statues upon their horses, indifferent and silent, and wishing,
in a general way, that the day were over and the time had come
for going into camp, where they might stretch out their legs and
smoke their pipes to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>"Yes, that 'ere is the place they call Devil's Pass," said the
corporal in reply to a question from the boy. "You see that it
was so wide back there at the beginning that you couldn't see
how wide it was, and it keeps geting narrower and narrower till
it reminds me of the canyon of the upper Yellowstone."</p>

<p>"How is that?" was the question that came when he paused to take
breath.</p>

<p>"So narrow that you could toss a ball from one side to the other,
and a thousand feet from the top to bottom, clean and square,
and there are some places where it is all of a half mile."</p>

<p>"But this don't seem as narrow as that."</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose it is; but don't you notice ahead, yonder, that
it ain't more than a hundred yards broad? Well, it keeps it up
for all of two miles just like that."</p>

<p>"Why do they call it Devil's Pass, corporal?"</p>

<p>"I suppose because, if the Old Boy wanted to gobble up a lot
of folks, that is just the place. The walls on each side are straight
up and down, and several hundred feet high, so that a man can't
dodge to the right or left, unless he has a pair of wings to help
him. The only thing he can do is to go forward and backward, and
if he happens to have Injuns in front and rear, you can understand
what a purty muss he would be in. That, I s'pose, is the reason
why it's called the Devil's Pass."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will attack <em>us</em>?" asked Ned, in a
scared voice.</p>

<p>"I can't say," replied the corporal, striving to banish the expression
of alarm from his face. "If they've got any idea of disturbing
us, just here is where they'll do it. It's the worst place on
the route, and if we can get through to the other side all right,
I'll feel as safe as if we was inside the stockades of your father's
fort."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been through here before?"</p>

<p>"Yes; all of half a dozen times."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get into trouble?"</p>

<p>"I never traveled through in all my life without having a scrimmage
with some of the redskins. If you'll take a look round as we drive
along, you'll see the bones of men scattered all along. Some belong
to white, and some to redskins; but they all fell fighting."</p>

<p>"How far ahead is the worst part of the route?"</p>

<p>"We're close upon it now, and I may as well tell you, Ned, that
I think we're going to have a fight."</p>
