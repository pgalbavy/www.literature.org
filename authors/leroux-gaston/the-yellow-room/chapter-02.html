<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry
of young Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about
eight o’clock and I was still in bed reading the article in the
"Matin" relative to the Glandier crime.</p>

<p>But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend
to the reader.</p>

<p>I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter.
At that time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in
the corridors of examining magistrates, when I had gone to get
a "permit to communicate"  for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare.
He had, as they say, "a good nut." He seemed to have taken his
head&mdash;round as a bullet&mdash;out of a box of marbles, and it is from
that, I think, that his comrades of the press&mdash;all determined
billiard-players&mdash;had given him that nickname, which was to stick
to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always as red as
a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while
still so young&mdash;he was only sixteen and a half years old when
I saw him for the first time&mdash;had he already won his way on the
press? That was what everybody who came into contact with him
might have asked, if they had not known his history. At the time
of the affair of the woman cut in pieces in the Rue Oberskampf&mdash;another
forgotten story&mdash;he had taken to one of the editors of the "Epoque,"&mdash;a
paper then rivalling the "Matin"  for information,&mdash;the left foot,
which was missing from the basket in which the gruesome remains
were discovered. For this left foot the police had been vainly
searching for a week, and young Rouletabille had found it in a
drain where nobody had thought of looking for it. To do that he
had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a number engaged
by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an overflow
of the Seine.</p>

<p>When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot
and informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy
had been led to make, he was divided between the admiration he
felt for such detective cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen
years, and delight at being able to exhibit, in the "morgue window"
of his paper, the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf.</p>

<p>"This foot," he cried, "will make a great headline."</p>

<p>Then, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical
lawyer attached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly
to become famous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn
as a general reporter on the "Epoque"?</p>

<p>"Two hundred francs a month," the youngster replied modestly,
hardly able to breathe from surprise at the proposal.</p>

<p>"You shall have two hundred and fifty," said the editor-in-chief;
"only you must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the
paper for a month. Let it be quite understood that it was not
you but the ‘Epoque’ that discovered the left foot of the Rue
Oberskampf. Here, my young friend, the man is nothing, the paper
everything."</p>

<p>Having said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before
the youth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name.
The other replied:</p>

<p>"Joseph Josephine."</p>

<p>"That’s not a name," said the editor-in-chief, "but since you
will not be required to sign what you write it is of no consequence."</p>

<p>The boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for
he was serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted
the most severe-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his
companions. At the Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before
going to any of the courts, or to the Prefecture, in search of
their news of crime, he began to win a reputation as an unraveller
of intricate and obscure affairs which found its way to the office
of the Chief of the Surete. When a case was worth the trouble
and Rouletabille&mdash;he had already been given his nickname&mdash;had
been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he often got
the better of the most famous detective.</p>

<p>It was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with
him. Criminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former
need advertisement, the latter information. We chatted together,
and I soon warmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and
so original!&mdash;and he had a quality of thought such as I have never
found in any other person.</p>

<p>Some time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the
"Cri du Boulevard." My entry into journalism could not but strengthen
the ties which united me to Rouletabille. After a while, my new
friend being allowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence
column, which he was allowed to sign "Business," in the "Epoque,"
I was often able to furnish him with the legal information of
which he stood in need.</p>

<p>Nearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him,
the more I learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless
extravagance, I had discovered in him what was, considering his
age, an extraordinary seriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was
to seeing him gay and, indeed, often too gay, I would many times
find him plunged in the deepest melancholy. I tried then to question
him as to the cause of this change of humour, but each time he
laughed and made me no answer. One day, having questioned him
about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left me, pretending
not to have heard what I said.</p>

<p>While things were in this state between us, the famous case of
The "Yellow Room" took place. It was this case which was to rank
him as the leading newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the
reputation of being the greatest detective in the world. It should
not surprise us to find in the one man the perfection of two such
lines of activity if we remember that the daily press was already
beginning to transform itself and to become what it is to-day&mdash;the
gazette of crime.</p>

<p>Morose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard
it a matter for congratulation. We can never have too many arms,
public or private, against the criminal. To this some people may
answer that, by continually publishing the details of crimes,
the press ends by encouraging their commission. But then, with
some people we can never do right. Rouletabille, as I have said,
entered my room that morning of the 26th of October, 1892. He
was looking redder than usual, and his eyes were bulging out of
his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he appeared to be in
a state of extreme excitement. He waved the "Matin"  with a trembling
hand, and cried:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Sainclair,&mdash;have you read it?"</p>

<p>"The Glandier crime?"</p>

<p>"Yes; "The Yellow Room"! &mdash;What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon
Dieu that committed the crime."</p>

<p>"Be serious!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don’t much believe in murderers* who make their escape
through walls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong
to leave behind him the weapon with which the crime was committed
and, as he occupied the attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
room, the builder’s job ordered by the examining magistrate will
give us the key of the enigma and it will not be long before we
learn by what natural trap, or by what secret door, the old fellow
was able to slip in and out, and return immediately to the laboratory
to Monsieur Stangerson, without his absence being noticed. That,
of course, is only an hypothesis."</p>

<p>   *Although the original English translation often uses the
words    "murder" and "murderer," the reader may substitute "attack"
and    "attacker" since no murder is actually committed.</p>

<p>Rouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he
was never without, smoked for a few minutes in silence&mdash;no doubt
to calm the excitement which, visibly, dominated him&mdash;and then
replied:</p>

<p>"Young man," he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will
not attempt to render, "young man, you are a lawyer and I doubt
not your ability to save the guilty from conviction; but if you
were a magistrate on the bench, how easy it would be for you to
condemn innocent persons! &mdash;You are really gifted, young
man!"</p>

<p>He continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:</p>

<p>"No trap will be found, and the mystery of "The Yellow Room"
will become more and more mysterious. That’s why it interests
me. The examining magistrate is right; nothing stranger than this
crime has ever been known."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"None," replied Rouletabille&mdash;"none, for the present. But I have
an idea as to the revolver; the murderer did not use it."</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;by Mademoiselle Stangerson."</p>

<p>"I don’t understand,&mdash;or rather, I have never understood," I
said.</p>

<p>Rouletabille shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing in this article in the ‘Matin’ by which you
were particularly struck?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, &mdash;I have found the whole of the story it tells
equally strange."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;the locked door&mdash;with the key on the inside?"</p>

<p>"That’s the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article."</p>

<p>"Really! &mdash;And the bolt?"</p>

<p>"The bolt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the bolt&mdash;also inside the room&mdash;a still further protection
against entry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary
precautions! It is clear to me that she feared someone. That was
why she took such precautions&mdash;even Daddy Jacques’s revolver&mdash;without
telling him of it. No doubt she didn’t wish to alarm anybody,
and least of all, her father. What she dreaded took place, and
she defended herself. There was a struggle, and she used the revolver
skilfully enough to wound the assassin in the hand&mdash;which explains
the impression on the wall and on the door of the large, blood-stained
hand of the man who was searching for a means of exit from the
chamber. But she didn’t fire soon enough to avoid the terrible
blow on the right temple."</p>

<p>"Then the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?"</p>

<p>"The paper doesn’t say it was, and I don’t think it was; because
logically it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle
Stangerson against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer
use? The blow on the temple seems to show that the murderer wished
to stun Mademoiselle Stangerson,&mdash;after he had unsuccessfully
tried to strangle her. He must have known that the attic was inhabited
by Daddy Jacques, and that was one of the reasons, I think, why
he must have used a quiet weapon,&mdash;a life-preserver, or a hammer."</p>

<p>"All that doesn’t explain how the murderer got out of "The Yellow
Room","  I observed.</p>

<p>"Evidently," replied Rouletabille, rising, "and that is what
has to be explained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and
have come to see whether you will go with me."</p>

<p>"I?&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy. I want you. The ‘Epoque’ has definitely entrusted
this case to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"But in what way can I be of any use to you?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier."</p>

<p>"That’s true. His despair must be boundless."</p>

<p>"I must have a talk with him."</p>

<p>Rouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.</p>

<p>"Is it because&mdash;you think there is something to be got out of
him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room, begging
me to dress quickly.</p>

<p>I knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service
to him in a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre
Barbet Delatour. Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time
about forty years of age, was a professor of physics at the Sorbonne.
He was intimately acquainted with the Stangersons, and, after
an assiduous seven years’ courtship of the daughter, had been
on the point of marrying her. In spite of the fact that she has
become, as the phrase goes, "a person of a certain age," she was
still remarkably good-looking. While I was dressing I called out
to Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about my sitting-room:</p>

<p>"Have you any idea as to the murderer’s station in life?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "I think if he isn’t a man in society, he
is, at least, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again,
is only an impression."</p>

<p>"What has led you to form it?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks
of the rough boots on the floor," he replied.</p>

<p>"I understand," I said; "murderers don’t leave traces behind
them which tell the truth."</p>

<p>"We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,"
concluded Rouletabille.</p>
