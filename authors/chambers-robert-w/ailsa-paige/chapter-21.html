<p>Early in October the Union Cavalry began their favourite pastime
of "chasing" Stuart.  General Pleasanton with a small force and
a horse battery began it, marching seventy-eight miles in twenty-four
hours; but Stuart marched ninety in the same time.  He had to.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock in the morning of October tenth, General Buford,
chief of cavalry, set the 6th Pennsylvania Lancers galloping after
Stuart.  Part of the 1st Maine Cavalry joined the chase; but Stuart
flourished his heels and cantered gaily into Pennsylvania to the
amazement and horror of that great State, and to the unbounded
mortification of the Union army.  He had with him the 1st, 3d,
4th, 5th and 9th Virginia Cavalry; the 7th and 9th North Carolina,
and two Legions; and after him went pelting the handful that McClellan
could mount.  A few tired troopers galloped up to Whitens Ford
just as Stuart crossed in safety; and the gain of "chasing" Stuart
was over.  Never had the efficiency of the Union Cavalry been
at such a low ebb; but it was low-water mark, indeed, and matters
were destined to mend after a history of nearly two years of neglect,
disorganisation, and misuse.</p>

<p>Bayard took over the cavalry south of Washington; Pleasanton
collected the 6th Regulars, the 3d Indiana, the 8th New York,
the 8th Pennsylvania, and the 8th Illinois, and started in to
do mischief with brigade head-quarters in the saddle.</p>

<p>The 8th New York went with him, but the 8th New York Lancers,
reorganising at Orange Hill, were ordered to recruit the depleted
regiment to twelve companies.</p>

<p>In August, Berkley's ragged blue and yellow jacket had been gaily
embellished with brand-new sergeant's chevrons; at the Stone Bridge
where the infantry recoiled his troop passed over at a gallop.</p>

<p>The War Department, much edified, looked at the cavalry and began
to like it.  And it was ordered that every cavalry regiment be
increased by two troops, L and M.  Which liberality, in combination
with Colonel Arran's early reports concerning Berkley's conduct,
enabled the company tailor to sew a pair of lieutenant's shoulder-straps
on Berkley's soiled jacket.</p>

<p>But there was more than that in store for him; it was all very
well to authorise two new troops to a regiment, but another matter
to recruit them.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran, from his convalescent couch in the North, wrote
to Governor Morgan; and Berkley got his troop, and his orders
to go to New York and recruit it.  And by the same mail came the
first letter Ailsa had been well enough to write him since her
transfer North on the transport <em>Long Branch</em>.</p>

<p>He read it a great many times; it was his only diversion while
awaiting transportation at the old Hygeia Hotel, where, in company
with hundreds of furloughed officers, he slept on the floors in
his blanket; he read it on deck, as the paddle-wheeled transport
weighed anchor, swung churning under the guns of the great Fortress&mdash;so
close that the artillerymen on the water-battery could have tossed
a biscuit aboard&mdash;and, heading north-east, passed out between
the capes, where, seaward, the towering black sides of a sloop
of war rose, bright work aglitter, smoke blowing fitfully from
her single funnel.</p>

<p>At Alexandria he telegraphed her: "Your letter received, I am
on my way North," and signed it with a thrill of boyish pride:
"Philip O. Berkley-Arran, Capt. Cavalry, U. S. V."</p>

<p>To his father he sent a similar telegram from the Willard in
Washington; wasted two days at the State, War, and Navy for an
audience with Mr. Stanton, and finally found himself, valise in
hand, waiting among throngs of officers of all grades, all arms
of the service, for a chance to board his train.</p>

<p>And, as he stood there, he felt cotton-gloved fingers fumbling
for the handle of his valise, and wheeled sharply, and began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Where the devil did you come from, Burgess?  Did they give you
a furlough?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain."</p>

<p>"Well, you got more than I.  What's the matter; do you want to
carry my bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You don't have to."</p>

<p>"No, Captain. . . .  If you don't object, sir, I'll carry it."</p>

<p>They found seats together; Philip, amused, tried to extract from
Burgess something besides the trite and obvious servant's patter&mdash;something
that might signify some possibility of a latent independence&mdash;the
germ of aspiration.  And extracted nothing. Burgess had not changed,
had not developed.  His ways were Philip's ways; his loftier flights
mounted no higher toward infinity than the fashions prevailing
in the year 1862, and their suitability to his master's ultimate
requirements.</p>

<p>For his regiment, for its welfare, its hopes, its glory, he apparently
cared nothing; nor did he appear to consider the part he had borne
in its fluctuating fortunes anything to be proud of.</p>

<p>Penned with the others in the brush field, he had done stolidly
what his superiors demanded of him; and it presently came out
that the only anxiety that assailed him was when, in the smoke
of the tangled thickets, he missed his late master.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do after the regiment is mustered
out?" inquired Philip curiously.</p>

<p>"Wait on you, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>want</em> to do anything else?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."'</p>

<p>Philip looked at him, smiling.</p>

<p>"I suppose you like my cigars, and my brandy and my linen?"</p>

<p>The ghost of .a grin touched the man's features.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said with an impudence that captivated Philip.</p>

<p>"All right, my friend; I can stand it as long as you can. . .
. And kindly feel in my overcoat for a cigar wrapped in paper. 
I'll go forward and smoke for a while."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"The cigar &mdash;I put it in my overcoat pocket wrapped in a
bit of paper. . . .  You&mdash;you don't mean to tell me that it's
not there!"</p>

<p>Burgess searched the pockets with a perfectly grave face.</p>

<p>"It ain't here; no, sir."</p>

<p>Philip flung himself into the corner of his seat, making no effort
to control his laughter:</p>

<p>"Burgess," he managed to say, "the dear old days are returning
already.  I'll stay here and read; you go forward and smoke that
cigar.  Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Again, just as he had done every day since leaving camp, he reread
Ailsa's letter, settling down in his corner by the dirty, rattling
window-pane:</p>

<p>"Everybody writes to you except myself.  I know they have told
you that it is taking a little longer for me to get well than
anybody expected.  I was terribly tired.  Your father has been
so sweet; everybody has been good to me &mdash;Celia, poor little
Camilla, and Stephen.  I know that they all write to you; and
somehow I have been listlessly contented to let them tell you
about home matters, and wait until my strength returned.  But
you must not doubt where every waking memory of mine has centred;
my thoughts have circled always around that central vortex from
which, since I first laid eyes on you, they have never strayed.</p>

<p>"Home news is what all good soldiers want; I write for you all
I know:</p>

<p>"The city is the same hot, noisy, dirty, dusty, muddy, gridiron,
changed in nowise except that everywhere one sees invalid soldiers;
and there are far too many officers lounging about, presumably
on furlough&mdash;too many Captain Dash's, twirling black moustaches
in front of fashionable hotels.  There are no powder stains on
their uniforms, no sun-burn on their cheeks.  They throng the
city; and it is a sinister phenomenon.</p>

<p>"I think Broadway was never as lively, never quite as licentious.
Those vivid cafes, saloons, concert halls, have sprung up everywhere;
theatres, museums, gardens are in full blast; shops are crowded,
hotels, street cars, stages overflowing with careless, noisy,
overdressed people.  The city is <em>en fete</em>; and somehow
when I think of that Dance of Death thundering ceaselessly just
south of us, it appalls me to encounter such gaiety and irresponsibility
in the streets.</p>

<p>"Yet, after all, it may be the safety-valve of a brave people.
Those whirling daily in the Dance of Death have, at least, the
excitement to sustain them.  Here the tension is constant and
terrible; and the human mind cannot endure too much tragedy.</p>

<p>". . . They say our President fits a witticism to the tragedy
of every battle-field; but it may be to preserve his own reason
through these infernal years.  He has the saddest eyes of any
man since the last Martyr died.</p>

<p>"England behaves badly.  It was her God-given opportunity to
stand by us.  She has had chance after chance since the last patriot
died from lack of food and air in this sad old city of New York.
. . . The Prince Consort is kind; his wife is inclined to be what
he is. Napoleon is the sinister shape behind the arras; and the
Tory government licks his patent-leather boots.  Vile is the attitude
of England, vile her threats, her sneers, her wicked contempt
of a great people in agony.  Her murderous government, bludgeon
in hand, stands snarling at us in Mexico; her ministers glare
at us from every war port; her press mocks in infamous caricature
our unhappy President; only her poor are with us&mdash;the poor of
England whom our war is starving.  Again and again we have forgiven
her.  But now, standing on our blood-wet battle-fields, can we
ever again forgive?</p>

<p>"You have heard from your family and from Celia, so what news
I write may be no news.  Yet I know how it is with soldiers; they
never tire of such repetitions.</p>

<p>"Your father is slowly recovering.  But he will never sit his
saddle again, dear.  Don't expect it; the war is over as far as
he is concerned.  But never have my eyes beheld such happiness,
such gratitude, such adoration as I see in his eyes when your
letters come.  I think the burden of his conversation is you. 
I never hear him speak of anything else.  Your father walks now;
and by the time you are here he will be able to drive on Fifth
Avenue and in the new Central Park.  But he is not the man who
left this city at the head of his regiment.  His hair and moustache
are white as snow; there are a thousand tiny wrinkles on his hands
and features.  All that heavy colour is gone; only a slight flush
remains on his thin face.  He is very handsome, Phil.  Once, never
dreaming of what was true, I thought he resembled you.  Do you
recollect my saying so once?  Even you would recognise the likeness
now.  He is absorbed, wrapped up in you. . . .  I can see, now,
that he always has been. How blind we are! How blind!</p>

<p>"Celia, the darling, has not changed one particle.  She is the
prettiest thing you ever saw, cheerful, clever, courageous, self-possessed,
devoted to Stephen, whose leave has been extended and who plays
the role of a pale and interesting invalid hero with placid satisfaction
to himself, adored and hovered over by Paige and Marye and all
their girl friends.  But when poor little Camilla, in her deep
mourning, appears at the door, he clears out the others with a
tyranny characteristic of young men; and I'm somewhat sorry for
his mother and sisters.  But it's the inevitable; and Camilla
is the sweetest thing.</p>

<p>"Celia hears often from Curt, Poor Major Lent!  It seems too
hard that Camilla should be left so utterly alone in the world. 
The Major died as he would have wished to die, Curt writes.  It
was at that terrible Stone Bridge&mdash;where God was merciful to me
when your squadron galloped across.</p>

<p>"He was found, seated against a tree, stone dead, one hand stiffened
over the Mexican war medal at his throat.  Curt says his face
was calm, almost smiling.  Camilla has his sword and medals.</p>

<p>"Did you know that your friend John Casson was dead?  I was with
him; I did not know he was a friend of yours.  He displayed the
same patience, the same desire not to be troublesome that so many
badly wounded do.</p>

<p>"Letty asked me to say that a zouave of the 5th Regiment, a Mr.
Cortlandt, was also killed.  So many, many people I knew or had
heard of have been killed or have died of disease since the war
began.  One sees a great many people wearing mourning in the city&mdash;crape
is so common, on sword-hilts, on arms, veils, gowns, bonnets.</p>

<p>"Letty made the loveliest bride you or I ever beheld.  Usually
brides do not look their best, but Letty was the most charming,
radiant, bewildering creature&mdash;and so absurdly young&mdash;as though
suddenly she had dropped a few years and was again beginning that
girlhood which I sometimes thought she had never had.</p>

<p>"Dr. Benton is a darling.  He looks twenty years younger and
wears a monocle!  They are back from their honeymoon, and are
planning to offer their services to the great central hospital
at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Dear, your letter breaking the news to me that Marye Mead was
burned when the cavalry burned Edmund Ruffin's house was no news
to me.  I saw it on fire.  But, Philip, there was a fiercer flame
consuming me than ever swept that house.  I thank God it Is quenched
for ever and that my heart and soul, refreshed, made new, bear
no scars now of that infernal conflagration.</p>

<p>"I sit here at my window and see below me the folds of the dear
flag stirring; in my ears, often, is the noise of drums from the
dusty avenue where new regiments are passing on into the unknown&mdash;no
longer the unknown to us&mdash;but the saddest of all truths.</p>

<p>"Sometimes Celia comes from the still, leafy seclusion of Fort
Greene Place, to love me, caress me, gently jeer at me for the
hint of melancholy in my gaze, shaming me for a love-sick thing
that droops and pines in the absence of all that animates her
soul and body with the desire to live.</p>

<p>"She is only partly right; I am very tired, Phil.  Not that I
am ill.  I am well, now.  It only needs you.  She knows it; I
have always known it.  Your love, and loving you, is all that
life means to me.</p>

<p>"I see them all here &mdash;Celia fussing with my trousseau,
gowns, stockings, slippers, hovering over them with Paigie and
Marye in murmurous and intimate rapture.  They lead me about to
shops and in busy thoroughfares; and I see and understand, and
I hear my own voice as at an infinite distance, and I am happy
in the same indefinite way.  But, try as I may, I cannot fix my
thoughts on what I am about, on the pretty garments piled around
me, on the necessary arrangements to be made, on the future&mdash;our
future!  I cannot even think clearly about that.  All that my
mind seems able to contain is my love for you, the knowledge that
you are coming, that I am to see you, touch you.</p>

<p>"I try to realise that I am to be your wife; the heavenly reality
seems vaguely impossible.  Yet every moment I am schooling myself
to the belief, telling myself that it is to be, repeating the
divine words again and again.  And all I am capable of understanding
is that I love you, and that the world stands still, waiting for
you as I wait; and that without you nothing is real, and I move
in a world of phantoms.</p>

<p>"I have been to the mirror to look at myself.  To be certain,
I also asked Celia.  She says that you will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>"She sat here searching the morning paper for news of her husband's
regiment, but found none.  What women endure for men no man that
ever lives can understand.</p>

<p>"She is perfectly cheerful about it all.  And, oh, such a rebel!
She read aloud to me with amused malice the order from the War
Department which does away with regimental bands and substitutes
a brigade band.</p>

<p>"I sca'cely blame them,' she observed; 'I'd be ve'y glad myse'f
to hear less of Yankee Doodle and the Star-spangled Banner.  When
they let President Davis alone, and when Curt comes home, I've
got some ve'y pretty songs fo' him to learn to appreciate.'</p>

<p>"She's down stairs now, seated at the piano, singing very softly
to herself some gaily impudent rebel song or other.  I know it's
a rebel song by the way she sings it.</p>

<p>"And, as I sit here, alone, thinking of how I love you&mdash;far away
I hear the 'old line's bugle'&mdash;the quaint, quick rhythm of the
fifes and drums; and it stirs depths in me where my very soul
lies listening&mdash;and the tears spring to my eyes.  And I try to
understand why every separate silver star in the flag is mine
to hold, mine to rescue and replace, mine to adore.  And I try
to understand why all of it is part of the adoration of you, and
of God who gave you to me&mdash;Philip &mdash;Philip&mdash;my lover, my
country, my God&mdash;worshipped and adored of men!"</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
