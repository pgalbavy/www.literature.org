<p>The Sheridan Building was the biggest skyscraper; the Sheridan
Trust Company was the biggest of its kind, and Sheridan himself
had been the biggest builder and breaker and truster and buster
under the smoke. He had come from a country cross-roads, at the
beginning of the growth, and he had gone up and down in the booms
and relapses of that period; but each time he went down he rebounded
a little higher, until finally, after a year of overwork and anxiety&mdash;the
latter not decreased by a chance, remote but possible, of recuperation
from the former in the penitentiary&mdash;he found himself on top,
with solid substance under his feet; and thereafter "played it
safe." But his hunger to get was unabated, for it was in the very
bones of him and grew fiercer.</p>

<p>He was the city incarnate. He loved it, calling it God's country,
as he called the smoke Prosperity, breathing the dingy cloud with
relish. And when soot fell upon his cuff he chuckled; he could
have kissed it. "It's good! It's good!" he said, and smacked his
lips in gusto. "Good, clean soot; it's our life-blood, God bless
it!" The smoke was one of his great enthusiasms; he laughed at
a committee of plaintive housewives who called to beg his aid
against it. "Smoke's what brings your husbands' money home on
Saturday night," he told them, jovially. "Smoke may hurt your
little shrubberies in the front yard some, but it's the catarrhal
climate and the adenoids that starts your chuldern coughing. Smoke
makes the climate better. Smoke means good health: it makes the
people wash more. They have to wash so much they wash off the
microbes. You go home and ask your husbands what smoke puts in
their pockets out o' the pay-roll&mdash;and you'll come around next
time to get me to turn out more smoke instead o' chokin' it off!"</p>

<p>It was Narcissism in him to love the city so well; he saw his
reflection in it; and, like it, he was grimy, big, careless, rich,
strong, and unquenchably optimistic. From the deepest of his inside
all the way out he believed it was the finest city in the world.
"Finest" was his word. He thought of it as his city as he thought
of his family as his family; and just as profoundly believed his
city to be the finest city in the world, so did he believe his
family to be&mdash;in spite of his son Bibbs&mdash;the finest family in
the world. As a matter of fact, he knew nothing worth knowing
about either.</p>

<p>Bibbs Sheridan was a musing sort of boy, poor in health, and
considered the failure&mdash;the "odd one"&mdash;of the family. Born during
that most dangerous and anxious of the early years, when the mother
fretted and the father took his chance, he was an ill-nourished
baby, and grew meagerly, only lengthwise, through a feeble childhood.
At his christening he was committed for life to "Bibbs" mainly
through lack of imagination on his mother's part, for though it
was her maiden name, she had no strong affection for it; but it
was "her turn" to name the baby, and, as she explained later,
she "couldn't think of anything else she liked AT <em>ALL!" </em>She
offered this explanation one day when the sickly boy was nine
and after a long fit of brooding had demanded some reason for
his name's being Bibbs. He requested then with unwonted vehemence
to be allowed to exchange names with his older brother, Roscoe
Conkling Sheridan, or with the oldest, James Sheridan, Junior,
and upon being refused went down into the cellar and remained
there the rest of that day. And the cook, descending toward dusk,
reported that he had vanished; but a search revealed that he was
in the coal-pile, completely covered and still burrowing. Removed
by force and carried upstairs, he maintained a cryptic demeanor,
refusing to utter a syllable of explanation, even under the lash.
This obvious thing was wholly a mystery to both parents; the mother
was nonplussed, failed to trace and connect; and the father regarded
his son as a stubborn and mysterious fool, an impression not effaced
as the years went by.</p>

<p>At twenty-two, Bibbs was physically no more than the outer scaffolding
of a man, waiting for the building to begin inside&mdash;a long-shanked,
long-faced, rickety youth, sallow and hollow and haggard, dark-haired
and dark-eyed, with a peculiar expression of countenance; indeed,
at first sight of Bibbs Sheridan a stranger might well be solicitous,
for he seemed upon the point of tears. But to a slightly longer
gaze, not grief, but mirth, was revealed as his emotion; while
a more searching scrutiny was proportionately more puzzling&mdash;he
seemed about to burst out crying or to burst out laughing, one
or the other, inevitably, but it was impossible to decide which.
And Bibbs never, on any occasion of his life, either laughed aloud
or wept.</p>

<p>He was a "disappointment" to his father. At least that was the
parent's word&mdash;a confirmed and established word after his first
attempt to make a "business man" of the boy. He sent Bibbs to
"begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up" in the machine-shop
of the Sheridan Automatic Pump Works, and at the end of six months
the family physician sent Bibbs to begin at the bottom and learn
from the ground up in a sanitarium.</p>

<p>"You needn't worry, mamma," Sheridan told his wife. "There's
nothin' the matter with Bibbs except he hates work so much it
makes him sick. I put him in the machine-shop, and I guess I know
what I'm doin' about as well as the next man. Ole Doc Gurney always
was one o' them nutty alarmists. Does he think I'd do anything
'd be bad for my own flesh and blood? He makes me tired!"</p>

<p>Anything except perfectly definite health or perfectly definite
disease was incomprehensible to Sheridan. He had a genuine conviction
that lack of physical persistence in any task involving money
must be due to some subtle weakness of character itself, to some
profound shiftlessness or slyness. He understood typhoid fever,
pneumonia, and appendicitis&mdash;one had them, and either died or
got over them and went back to work&mdash;but when the word "nervous"
appeared in a diagnosis he became honestly suspicious: he had
the feeling that there was something contemptible about it, that
there was a nigger in the wood-pile somewhere.</p>

<p>"Look at me," he said. "Look at what I did at his age! Why, when
I was twenty years old, wasn't I up every morning at four o'clock
choppin' wood&mdash;yes! and out in the dark and the snow&mdash;to build
a fire in a country grocery store? And here Bibbs has to go and
have a <em>DOCTOR </em>because he can't &mdash;Pho! it makes me
tired! If he'd gone at it like a man he wouldn't be sick."</p>

<p>He paced the bedroom&mdash;the usual setting for such parental discussions&mdash;in
his nightgown, shaking his big, grizzled head and gesticulating
to his bedded spouse. "My Lord!" he said. "If a little, teeny
bit o' work like this is too much for him, why, he ain't fit for
anything! It's nine-tenths imagination, and the rest of it&mdash;well,
I won't say it's deliberate, but I <em>WOULD </em>like to know
just how much of it's put on!"</p>

<p>"Bibbs didn't want the doctor," said Mrs. Sheridan. "It was when
he was here to dinner that night, and noticed how he couldn't
eat anything. Honey, you better come to bed."</p>

<p>"Eat!" he snorted. "Eat! It's work that makes men eat! And it's
imagination that keeps people from eatin'. Busy men don't get
time for that kind of imagination; and there's another thing you'll
notice about good health, if you'll take the trouble to look around
you Mrs. Sheridan: busy men haven't got time to be sick and they
don't <em>GET </em>sick. You just think it over and you'll find
that ninety-nine per cent. of the sick people you know are either
women or loafers. Yes, ma'am!"</p>

<p>"Honey," she said again, drowsily, "you better come to bed."</p>

<p>"Look at the other boys," her husband bade her. "Look at Jim
and Roscoe. Look at how <em>THEY </em>work! There isn't a shiftless
bone in their bodies. Work never made Jim or Roscoe sick. Jim
takes half the load off my shoulders already. Right now there
isn't a harder-workin', brighter business man in this city than
Jim. I've pushed him, but he give me something to push <em>AGAINST.
</em>You can't push 'nervous dyspepsia'! And look at Roscoe; just
<em>LOOK </em>at what that boy's done for himself, and barely
twenty-seven years old&mdash;married, got a fine wife, and ready to
build for himself with his own money, when I put up the New House
for you and Edie."</p>

<p>"Papa, you'll catch cold in your bare feet," she murmured. "You
better come to bed."</p>

<p>"And I'm just as proud of Edie, for a girl," he continued, emphatically,
"as I am of Jim and Roscoe for boys. She'll make some man a mighty
good wife when the time comes. She's the prettiest and talentedest
girl in the United States! Look at that poem she wrote when she
was in school and took the prize with; it's the best poem I ever
read in my life, and she'd never even tried to write one before.
It's the finest thing I ever read, and R. T. Bloss said so, too;
and I guess he's a good enough literary judge for me&mdash;turns out
more advertisin' liter'cher than any man in the city. I tell you
she's smart! Look at the way she worked me to get me to promise
the New House&mdash;and I guess you had your finger in that, too, mamma!
This old shack's good enough for me, but you and little Edie 'll
have to have your way. I'll get behind her and push her the same
as I will Jim and Roscoe. I tell you I'm mighty proud o' them
three chuldern! But Bibbs&mdash;" He paused, shaking his head. "Honest,
mamma, when I talk to men that got <em>ALL </em>their boys doin'
well and worth their salt, why, I have to keep my mind on Jim
and Roscoe and forget about Bibbs."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan tossed her head fretfully upon the pillow. "You
did the best you could, papa," she said, impatiently, "so come
to bed and quit reproachin' yourself for it."</p>

<p>He glared at her indignantly. "Reproachin' myself!" he snorted.
"I ain't doin' anything of the kind! What in the name o' goodness
would I want to reproach myself for? And it wasn't the 'best I
could,' either. It was the best <em>ANYBODY </em>could! I was
givin' him a chance to show what was in him and make a man of
himself&mdash;and here he goes and gets 'nervous dyspepsia' on me!"</p>

<p>He went to the old-fashioned gas-fixture, turned out the light,
and muttered his way morosely into bed.</p>

<p>"What?" said his wife, crossly, bothered by a subsequent mumbling.</p>

<p>"More like hook-worm, I said," he explained, speaking louder.
"I don't know what to do with him!"</p>
