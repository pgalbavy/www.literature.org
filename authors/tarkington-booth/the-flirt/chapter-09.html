<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Villages are scattered plentifully over the unstable buttresses
of Vesuvius, and the inhabitants sleep o' nights: Why not? Quite
unaware that he was much of their condition, Mr. Madison bade
his incidental gossip and the tiny Lottie good-night, and sought
his early bed. He maintained in good faith that Saturday night
was "a great night to sleep," because of the later hour for rising;
probably having also some factitious conviction that there prevailed
a hush preparative of the Sabbath. As a matter of fact, in summer,
the other members of his family always looked uncommonly haggard
at the Sunday breakfast-table. Accepting without question his
preposterous legend of additional matutinal slumber, they postponed
retiring to a late hour, and were awakened&mdash;simultaneously with
thousands of fellow-sufferers&mdash;at about half-after five on Sunday
morning, by a journalistic uprising. Over the town, in these early
hours, rampaged the small vendors of the manifold sheets: local
papers and papers from greater cities, hawker succeeding hawker
with yell upon yell and brain-piercing shrillings in unbearable
cadences. No good burgher ever complained: the people bore it,
as in winter they bore the smoke that injured their health, ruined
their linen, spoiled their complexions, forbade all hope of beauty
and comfort in their city, and destroyed the sweetness of their
homes and of their wives. It is an incredibly patient citizenry
and exalts its persecutors.</p>

<p>Of the Madison family, Cora probably suffered most; and this
was the time when it was no advantage to have the front bedroom.
She had not slept until close upon dawn, and the hawkers woke
her irreparably; she could but rage upon her hot pillow. By and
by, there came a token that another anguish kept company with
hers. She had left her door open for a better circulation of the
warm and languid air, and from Hedrick's room issued an "<em>oof</em>!"
of agonized disgust. Cora little suspected that the youth reeked
not of newsboys: Hedrick's miseries were introspective.</p>

<p>The cries from the street were interminable; each howler in turn
heard faintly in the distance, then in crescendo until he had
passed and another succeeded him, and all the while Cora lay tossing
and whispering between clenched teeth. Having ample reason, that
morning, to prefer sleep to thinking, sleep was impossible. But
she fought for it: she did not easily surrender what she wanted;
and she struggled on, with closed eyes, long after she had heard
the others go down to breakfast.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards from her windows, to the rear, were the
open windows of a church which fronted the next street, and stood
dos-a-dos to the dwelling of the Madisons. The Sunday-school hour
had been advanced for the hot weather, and, partly on this account,
and partly because of the summer absence of many families, the
attendants were few. But the young voices were conducted, rather
than accompanied, in pious melody by a cornetist who worthily
thought to amend, in his single person, what lack of volume this
paucity occasioned. He was a slender young man in hot black clothes;
he wore the unfacaded collar fatally and unanimously adopted by
all adam's-apple men of morals; he was washed, fair, flat-skulled,
clean-minded, and industrious; and the only noise of any kind
he ever made in the world was on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Prashus joowuls, sweet joowuls, <em>thee</em> jams off iz crowowun,"
sang the little voices feebly. They were almost unheard; but the
young man helped them out: figuratively, he put them out. And
the cornet was heard: it was heard for blocks and blocks; it was
heard over all that part of the town&mdash;in the vicinity of the church
it was the only thing that could be heard. In his daily walk this
cornetist had no enemies: he was kind-hearted; he would not have
shot a mad dog; he gladly nursed the sick. He sat upon the platform
before the children; he swelled, perspired and blew, and felt
that it was a good blowing. If other thoughts vapoured upon the
borders of his mind, they were of the dinner he would eat, soon
after noon, at the house of one of the frilled, white-muslin teachers.
He was serene. His eyes were not blasted; his heart was not instantly
withered; his thin, bluish hair did not fall from his head; his
limbs were not detached from his torso&mdash;yet these misfortunes
had been desired for him, with comprehension and sincerity, at
the first flat blat of his brassy horn.</p>

<p>It is impossible to imagine the state of mind of this young cornetist,
could he have known that he had caused the prettiest girl in town
to jump violently out of bed with what petitions upon her lips
regarding his present whereabouts and future detention! It happened
that during the course of his Sunday walk on Corliss Street, that
very afternoon, he saw her&mdash;was hard-smitten by her beauty, and
for weeks thereafter laid unsuccessful plans to "meet" her. Her
image was imprinted: he talked about her to his boarding-house
friends and office acquaintances, his favourite description being,
"the sweetest-looking lady I ever laid eyes on."</p>

<p>Cora, descending to the breakfast-table rather white herself,
was not unpleasantly shocked by the haggard aspect of Hedrick,
who, with Laura and Mrs. Madison, still lingered.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Cora," he said politely, and while she stared,
in suspicious surprise, he passed her a plate of toast with ostentatious
courtesy; but before she could take one of the slices, "Wait,"
he said; "it's very nice toast, but I'm afraid it isn't hot. I'll
take it to the kitchen and have it warmed for you." And he took
the plate and went out, walking softly.</p>

<p>Cora turned to her mother, appalled. "He'll be sick!" she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Madison shook her head and smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"He helped to wait on all of us: he must have been doing something
awful."</p>

<p>"More likely he wants permission to do something awful."</p>

<p>Laura looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"There, Cora," said Hedrick kindly, when he brought the toast;
"you'll find that nice and hot."</p>

<p>She regarded him steadfastly, but with modesty he avoided her
eye. "You wouldn't make such a radical change in your nature,
Hedrick," she said, with a puzzled frown, "just to get out of
going to church, would you?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to get out of going to church," he said. He gulped
slightly. "I like church."</p>

<p>And church-time found him marching decorously beside his father,
the three ladies forming a rear rank; a small company in the very
thin procession of fanning women and mopping men whose destination
was the gray stone church at the foot of Corliss Street. The locusts
railed overhead: Hedrick looked neither to the right nor to the
left.</p>

<p>They passed a club, of which a lower window was vacated simultaneously
with their coming into view; and a small but ornate figure in
pale gray crash hurried down the steps and attached itself to
the second row of Madisons. "Good-morning," said Mr. Wade Trumble.
"Thought I'd take a look-in at church this morning myself."</p>

<p>Care of this encumbrance was usually expected of Laura and Mrs.
Madison, but to their surprise Cora offered a sprightly rejoinder
and presently dropped behind them with Mr. Trumble. Mr. Trumble
was also surprised and, as naively, pleased.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" he asked with cheerful frankness. "You haven't
given me a chance to talk to you for a long while."</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" she smiled enigmatically. "I don't think you've
tried very hard."</p>

<p>This was too careless; it did not quite serve, even for Trumble.
"What's up?" he asked, not without shrewdness. "Is Richard Lindley
out of town?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I see. Perhaps it's this new chap, Corliss? Has he left?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense! What have they got to do with my being nice to
you?" She gave him a dangerous smile, and it wrought upon him
visibly.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever be nice to me unless you mean it," he said feebly.</p>

<p>Cora looked grave and sweet; she seemed mysteriously moved. "I
never do anything I don't mean," she said in a low voice which
thrilled the little man. This was machine-work, easy and accurate.</p>

<p>"Cora&#11834;" he began, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed, shifting on the instant to a lively brusqueness.
"That's enough for you just <em>now</em>. We're on our way to
church!"</p>

<p>Trumble felt almost that she had accepted him.</p>

<p>"Have you got your penny for the contribution box?" she smiled.
"I suppose you really give a great deal to the church. I hear
you're richer and richer."</p>

<p>"I do pretty well," he returned, coolly. "You can know just how
well, if you like."</p>

<p>"Not on Sunday," she laughed; then went on, admiringly, "I hear
you're very dashing in your speculations."</p>

<p>"Then you've heard wrong, because I don't speculate," he returned.
"I'm not a gambler&mdash;except on certainties. I guess I disappointed
a friend of yours the other day because I wouldn't back him on
a thousand-to-one shot."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" she asked, with an expression entirely veiled.</p>

<p>"Corliss. He came to see me; wanted me to put real money into
an oil scheme. Too thin!"</p>

<p>"Why is it `too thin'?" she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Too far away, for one thing&mdash;somewhere in Italy. Anybody who
put up his cash would have to do it on Corliss's bare word that
he's struck oil."</p>

<p>"Well?" She turned her face to him, and a faint perturbation
was manifest in her tone. "Isn't Mr. Corliss's `bare word' supposed
to be perfectly good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so, but I don't know. He isn't known here: nobody
really knows anything about him except that he was born here.
Besides, I wouldn't make an investment on my own father's bare
word, if he happened to be alive."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not!" Cora spoke impulsively, a sudden anger getting
the better of her, but she controlled it immediately. "Of course
I don't mean that," she laughed, sweetly. "But <em>I</em> happen
to think Mr. Corliss's scheme a very handsome one, and I want
my friends to make their fortunes, of course. Richard Lindley
and papa are going into it."</p>

<p>"I'll bet they don't," said Trumble promptly. "Lindley told me
he'd looked it over and couldn't see his way to."</p>

<p>"He did?" Cora stiffened perceptibly and bit her lip.</p>

<p>Trumble began to laugh. "This is funny: you trying to talk business!
So Corliss has been telling you about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has; and I understand it perfectly. I think there's
an enormous fortune in it, and you'd better not laugh at me: a
woman's instinct about such things is better than a man's experience
sometimes."</p>

<p>"You'll find neither Lindley nor your father are going to think
so," he returned skeptically.</p>

<p>She gave him a deep, sweet look. "But I mustn't be disappointed
in you," she said, with the suggestion of a tremor in her voice,
"whatever <em>they</em> do! You'll take my advice, won't you &mdash;Wade?"</p>

<p>"I'll take your advice in anything but business." He shook his
head ominously.</p>

<p>"And wouldn't you take my advice in business,"&mdash;she asked very
slowly and significantly&mdash;"under <em>any</em> circumstances?"</p>

<p>"You mean," he said huskily, "if you were my wife?"</p>

<p>She looked away, and slightly inclined her head. "No," he answered
doggedly, "I wouldn't. You know mighty well that's what I want
you to be, and I'd give my soul for the tip of your shoe, but
business is an entirely different matter, and I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Wade</em>!" she said, with wonderful and thrilling sweetness.
They had reached the church; Hedrick and his father had entered;
Mrs. Madison and Laura were waiting on the steps. Cora and Trumble
came to a stop some yards away. "Wade, I &mdash;I <em>want</em>
you to go into this."</p>

<p>"Can't do it," he said stubbornly. "If you ever make up your
mind to marry me, I'll spend all the money you like on <em>you</em>,
but you'll have to keep to the woman's side of the house."</p>

<p>"You make it pretty hard for me to be nice to you," she returned,
and the tremor now more evident in her voice was perfectly genuine.
"You positively refuse to do this&mdash;for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes I do. I wouldn't buy sight-unseen to please God 'lmighty,
Cora Madison." He looked at her shrewdly, struck by a sudden thought.
"Did Corliss ask you to try and get me in?"</p>

<p>"He did not," she responded, icily. "Your refusal is final?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" He struck the pavement a smart rap with his walking-stick.
"By George, I believe he <em>did</em> ask you! That spoils church
for me this morning; I'll not go in. When you quit playing games,
let me know. You needn't try to work me any more, because I won't
stand for it, but if you ever get tired of playing, come and tell
me so." He uttered a bark of rueful laughter. "Ha! I must say
that gentleman has an interesting way of combining business with
pleasure!"</p>

<p>Under favourable circumstances the blow Cora dealt him might
have been physically more violent. "Good-morning," she laughed,
gayly. "I'm not bothering much about Mr. Corliss's oil in Italy.
I had a bet with Laura I could keep you from saying `I beg to
differ,' or talking about the weather for five minutes. She'll
have to pay me!"</p>

<p>Then, still laughing, she lowered her parasol, and with superb
impudence, brushed it smartly across his face; turned on her heel,
and, red with fury, joined her mother and sister, and went into
the church.</p>

<p>The service failed to occupy her attention: she had much in her
thoughts to distract her. Nevertheless, she bestowed some wonderment
upon the devotion with which her brother observed each ceremonial
rite. He joined in prayer with real fervour; he sang earnestly
and loudly; a great appeal sounded in his changing voice; and
during the sermon he sat with his eyes upon the minister in a
stricken fixity. All this was so remarkable that Cora could not
choose but ponder upon it, and, observing Hedrick furtively, she
caught, if not a clue itself, at least a glimpse of one. She saw
Laura's clear profile becoming subtly agitated; then noticed a
shimmer of Laura's dark eye as it wandered to Hedrick and so swiftly
away it seemed not to dare to remain. Cora was quick: she perceived
that Laura was repressing a constant desire to laugh and that
she feared to look at Hedrick lest it overwhelm her. So Laura
knew what had wrought the miracle. Cora made up her mind to explore
this secret passage.</p>

<p>When the service was over and the people were placidly buzzing
their way up the aisles, Cora felt herself drawn to look across
the church, and following the telepathic impulse, turned her head
to encounter the gaze of Ray Vilas. He was ascending the opposite
aisle, walking beside Richard Lindley. He looked less pale than
usual, though his thinness was so extreme it was like emaciation;
but his eyes were clear and quiet, and the look he gave her was
strangely gentle. Cora frowned and turned away her head with an
air of annoyance. They came near each other in the convergence
at the doors; but he made no effort to address her, and, moving
away through the crowd as quickly as possible, disappeared.</p>

<p>Valentine Corliss was disclosed in the vestibule. He reached
her an instant in advance of Mr. Lindley, who had suffered himself
to be impeded; and Cora quickly handed the former her parasol,
lightly taking his arm. Thus the slow Richard found himself walking
beside Laura in a scattered group, its detached portion consisting
of his near-betrothed and Corliss; for although the dexterous
pair were first to leave the church, they contrived to be passed
almost at once, and, assuming the position of trailers, lagged
far behind on the homeward way.</p>

<p>Laura and Richard walked in the unmitigated glare of the sun;
he had taken her black umbrella and conscientiously held it aloft,
but over nobody. They walked in silence: they were quiet people,
both of them; and Richard, not "talkative" under any circumstances,
never had anything whatever to say to Laura Madison. He had known
her for many years, ever since her childhood; seldom indeed formulating
or expressing a definite thought about her, though sometimes it
was vaguely of his consciousness that she played the piano nicely,
and even then her music had taken its place as but a colour of
Cora's background. For to him, as to every one else (including
Laura), Laura was in nothing her sister's competitor. She was
a neutral-tinted figure, taken-for-granted, obscured, and so near
being nobody at all, that, as Richard Lindley walked beside her
this morning, he glanced back at the lagging couple and uttered
a long and almost sonorous sigh, which he would have been ashamed
for anybody to hear; and then actually proceeded on his way without
the slightest realization that anybody had heard it.</p>

<p>She understood. And she did not disturb the trance; she did nothing
to make him observe that she was there. She walked on with head,
shoulders, and back scorching in the fierce sun, and allowed him
to continue shading the pavement before them with her umbrella.
When they reached the house she gently took the umbrella from
him and thanked him; and he mechanically raised his hat.</p>

<p>They had walked more than a mile together; he had not spoken
a word, and he did not even know it.</p>
