<P>
FOR a quarter of an hour the drawing-room remained empty. At the
end of that time the council in the boudoir broke up. Lady
Lydiard led the way back into the drawing-room, followed by
Hardyman, Isabel being left to look after the dog. Before the
door closed behind him, Hardyman turned round to reiterate his
last medical directions--or, in plainer words, to take a last
look at Isabel.
<P>
"Plenty of water, Miss Isabel, for the dog to lap, and a little
bread or biscuit, if he wants something to eat. Nothing more, if
you please, till I see him to-morrow."
<P>
"Thank you, sir. I will take the greatest care--"
<P>
At that point Lady Lydiard cut short the interchange of
instructions and civilities. "Shut the door, if you please, Mr.
Hardyman. I feel the draught. Many thanks! I am really at a loss
to tell you how gratefully I feel your kindness. But for you my
poor little dog might be dead by this time."
<P>
Hardyman answered, in the quiet melancholy monotone which was
habitual with him, "Your Ladyship need feel no further anxiety
about the dog. Only be careful not to overfeed him. He will do
very well under Miss Isabel's care. By the bye, her family name
is Miller--is it not? Is she related to the Warwickshire Millers
of Duxborough House?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard looked at him with an expression of satirical
surprise. "Mr. Hardyman," she said, "this makes the fourth time
you have questioned me about Isabel. You seem to take a great
interest in my little companion. Don't make any apologies, pray!
You pay Isabel a compliment, and, as I am very fond of her, I am
naturally gratified when I find her admired. At the same time,"
she added, with one of her abrupt transitions of language, "I had
my eye on you, and I had my eye on her, when you were talking in
the next room; and I don't mean to let you make a fool of the
girl. She is not in your line of life, and the sooner you know it
the better. You make me laugh when you ask if she is related to
gentlefolks. She is the orphan daughter of a chemist in the
country. Her relations haven't a penny to bless themselves with,
except an old aunt, who lives in a village on two or three
hundred a year. I heard of the girl by accident. When she lost
her father and mother, her aunt offered to take her. Isabel said,
'No, thank you; I will not be a burden on a relation who has only
enough for herself. A girl can earn an honest living if she
tries; and I mean to try'--that's what she said. I admired her
independence," her Ladyship proceeded, ascending again to the
higher regions of thought and expression. "My niece's marriage,
just at that time, had left me alone in this great house. I
proposed to Isabel to come to me as companion and reader for a
few weeks, and to decide for herself whether she liked the life
or not. We have never been separated since that time. I could
hardly be fonder of her if she were my own daughter; and she
returns my affection with all her heart. She has excellent
qualities--prudent, cheerful, sweet-tempered; with good sense
enough to understand what her place is in the world, as
distinguished from her place in my regard. I have taken care, for
her own sake, never to leave that part of the question in any
doubt. It would be cruel kindness to deceive her as to her future
position when she marries. I shall take good care that the man
who pays his addresses to her is a man in her rank of life. I
know but too well, in the case of one of my own relatives, what
miseries unequal marriages bring with them. Excuse me for
troubling you at this length on domestic matters. I am very fond
of Isabel; and a girl's head is so easily turned. Now you know
what her position really is, you will also know what limits there
must be to the expression of your interest in her. I am sure we
understand each other; and I say no more."
<P>
Hardyman listened to this long harangue with the immovable
gravity which was part of his character--except when Isabel had
taken him by surprise. When her Ladyship gave him the opportunity
of speaking on his side, he had very little to say, and that
little did not suggest that he had greatly profited by what he
had heard. His mind had been full of Isabel when Lady Lydiard
began, and it remained just as full of her, in just the same way,
when Lady Lydiard had done.
<P>
"Yes," he remarked quietly, "Miss Isabel is an uncommonly nice
girl, as you say. Very pretty, and such frank, unaffected
manners. I don't deny that I feel an interest in her. The young
ladies one meets in society are not much to my taste. Miss Isabel
is my taste."
<P>
Lady Lydiard's face assumed a look of blank dismay. "I am afraid
I have failed to convey my exact meaning to you," she said.
<P>
Hardyman gravely declared that he understood her perfectly.
"Perfectly!" he repeated, with his impenetrable obstinacy. "Your
Ladyship exactly expresses my opinion of Miss Isabel. Prudent,
and cheerful, and sweet-tempered, as you say--all the qualities
in a woman that I admire. With good looks, too--of course, with
good looks. She will be a perfect treasure (as you remarked just
now) to the man who marries her. I may claim to know something
about it. I have twice narrowly escaped being married myself;
and, though I can't exactly explain it, I'm all the harder to
please in consequence. Miss Isabel pleases me. I think I have
said that before? Pardon me for saying it again. I'll call again
to-morrow morning and look at the dog as early as eleven o'clock,
if you will allow me. Later in the day I must be off to France to
attend a sale of horses. Glad to have been of any use to your
Ladyship, I am sure. Good-morning."
<P>
Lady Lydiard let him go, wisely resigning any further attempt to
establish an understanding between her visitor and herself.
<P>
"He is either a person of very limited intelligence when he is
away from his stables," she thought, "or he deliberately declines
to take a plain hint when it is given to him. I can't drop his
acquaintance, on Tommie's account. The only other alternative is
to keep Isabel out of his way. My good little girl shall not
drift into a false position while I am living to look after her.
When Mr. Hardyman calls to-morrow she shall be out on an errand.
When he calls the next time she shall be upstairs with a
headache. And if he tries it again she shall be away at my house
in the country. If he makes any remarks on her absence--well, he
will find that I can be just as dull of understanding as he is
when the occasion calls for it."
<P>
Having arrived at this satisfactory solution of the difficulty,
Lady Lydiard became conscious of an irresistible impulse to
summon Isabel to her presence and caress her. In the nature of a
warm-hearted woman, this was only the inevitable reaction which
followed the subsidence of anxiety about the girl, after her own
resolution had set that anxiety at rest. She threw open the door
and made one of her sudden appearances at the boudoir. Even in
the fervent outpouring of her affection, there was still the
inherent abruptness of manner which so strongly marked Lady
Lydiard's character in all the relations of life.
<P>
"Did I give you a kiss, this morning?" she asked, when Isabel
rose to receive her.
<P>
"Yes, my Lady," said the girl, with her charming smile.
<P>
"Come, then, and give me a kiss in return. Do you love me? Very
well, then, treat me like your mother. Never mind 'my lady' this
time. Give me a good hug!"
<P>
Something in those homely words, or something perhaps in the look
that accompanied them, touched sympathies in Isabel which seldom
showed themselves on the surface. Her smiling lips trembled, the
bright tears rose in her eyes. "You are too good to me," she
murmured, with her head on Lady Lydiard's bosom. "How can I ever
love you enough in return?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard patted the pretty head that rested on her with such
filial tenderness. "There! there!" she said, "Go back and play
with Tommie, my dear. We may be as fond of each other as we like;
but we mustn't cry. God bless you! Go away--go away!"
<P>
She turned aside quickly; her own eyes were moistening, and it
was part of her character to be reluctant to let Isabel see it.
"Why have I made a fool of myself?" she wondered, as she
approached the drawing-room door. "It doesn't matter. I am all
the better for it. Odd, that Mr. Hardyman should have made me
feel fonder of Isabel than ever!"
<P>
With those reflections she re-entered the drawing-room--and
suddenly checked herself with a start. "Good Heavens!" she
exclaimed irritably, "how you frightened me! Why was I not told
you were here?"
<P>
Having left the drawing-room in a state of solitude, Lady Lydiard
on her return found herself suddenly confronted with a gentleman,
mysteriously planted on the hearth-rug in her absence. The new
visitor may be rightly described as a gray man. He had gray hair,
eyebrows, and whiskers; he wore a gray coat, waistcoat, and
trousers, and gray gloves. For the rest, his appearance was
eminently suggestive of wealth and respectability and, in this
case, appearances were really to
 be trusted. The gray man was no other than Lady Lydiard's legal
adviser, Mr. Troy.
<P>
"I regret, my Lady, that I should have been so unfortunate as to
startle you," he said, with a certain underlying embarrassment in
his manner. "I had the honor of sending word by Mr. Moody that I
would call at this hour, on some matters of business connected
with your Ladyship's house property. I presumed that you expected
to find me here, waiting your pleasure--"
<P>
Thus far Lady Lydiard had listened to her legal adviser, fixing
her eyes on his face in her usually frank, straightforward way.
She now stopped him in the middle of a sentence, with a change of
expression in her own face which was undisguisedly a change to
alarm.
<P>
"Don't apologize, Mr. Troy," she said. "I am to blame for
forgetting your appointment and for not keeping my nerves under
proper control." She paused for a moment and took a seat before
she said her next words. "May I ask," she resumed, "if there is
something unpleasant in the business that brings you here?"
<P>
"Nothing whatever, my Lady; mere formalities, which can wait till
to-morrow or next day, if you wish it."
<P>
Lady Lydiard's fingers drummed impatiently on the table. "You
have known me long enough, Mr. Troy, to know that I cannot endure
suspense. You _have_ something unpleasant to tell me."
<P>
The lawyer respectfully remonstrated. "Really, Lady Lydiard!--"
he began.
<P>
"It won't do, Mr. Troy! I know how you look at me on ordinary
occasions, and I see how you look at me now. You are a very
clever lawyer; but, happily for the interests that I commit to
your charge, you are also a thoroughly honest man. After twenty
years' experience of you, you can't deceive _me_. You bring me
bad news. Speak at once, sir, and speak plainly."
<P>
Mr. Troy yielded--inch by inch, as it were. "I bring news which,
I fear, may annoy your Ladyship." He paused, and advanced another
inch. "It is news which I only became acquainted with myself on
entering this house."
<P>
He waited again, and made another advance. "I happened to meet
your Ladyship's steward, Mr. Moody, in the hall--"
<P>
"Where is he?" Lady Lydiard interposed angrily. "I can make _him_
speak out, and I will. Send him here instantly."
<P>
The lawyer made a last effort to hold off the coming disclosure a
little longer. "Mr. Moody will be here directly," he said. "Mr.
Moody requested me to prepare your Ladyship--"
<P>
"Will you ring the bell, Mr. Troy, or must I?"
<P>
Moody had evidently been waiting outside while the lawyer spoke
for him. He saved Mr. Troy the trouble of ringing the bell by
presenting himself in the drawing-room. Lady Lydiard's eyes
searched his face as he approached. Her bright complexion faded
suddenly. Not a word more passed her lips. She looked, and
waited.
<P>
In silence on his part, Moody laid an open sheet of paper on the
table. The paper quivered in his trembling hand.
<P>
Lady Lydiard recovered herself first. "Is that for me?" she
asked.
<P>
"Yes, my Lady."
<P>
She took up the paper without an instant's hesitation. Both the
men watched her anxiously as she read it.
<P>
The handwriting was strange to her. The words were these:--
<P>
"I hereby certify that the bearer of these lines, Robert Moody by
name, has presented to me the letter with which he was charged,
addressed to myself, with the seal intact. I regret to add that
there is, to say the least of it, some mistake. The inclosure
referred to by the anonymous writer of the letter, who signs 'a
friend in need,' has not reached me. No five-hundred pound
bank-note was in the letter when I opened it. My wife was present
when I broke the seal, and can certify to this statement if
necessary. Not knowing who my charitable correspondent is (Mr.
Moody being forbidden to give me any information), I can only
take this means of stating the case exactly as it stands, and
hold myself at the disposal of the writer of the letter. My
private address is at the head of the page. --Samuel Bradstock,
Rector, St. Anne's, Deansbury, London."
<P>
Lady Lydiard dropped the paper on the table. For the moment,
plainly as the Rector's statement was expressed, she appeared to
be incapable of understanding it. "What, in God's name, does this
mean?" she asked.
<P>
The lawyer and the steward looked at each other. Which of the two
was entitled to speak first? Lady Lydiard gave them no time to
decide. "Moody," she said sternly, "you took charge of the
letter--I look to you for an explanation."
<P>
Moody's dark eyes flashed. He answered Lady Lydiard without
caring to conceal that he resented the tone in which she had
spoken to him.
<P>
"I undertook to deliver the letter at its address," he said. "I
found it, sealed, on the table. Your Ladyship has the clergyman's
written testimony that I handed it to him with the seal unbroken.
I have done my duty; and I have no explanation to offer."
<P>
Before Lady Lydiard could speak again, Mr. Troy discreetly
interfered. He saw plainly that his experience was required to
lead the investigation in the right direction.
<P>
"Pardon me, my Lady," he said, with that happy mixture of the
positive and the polite in his manner, of which lawyers alone
possess the secret. "There is only one way of arriving at the
truth in painful matters of this sort. We must begin at the
beginning. May I venture to ask your Ladyship a question?"
<P>
Lady Lydiard felt the composing influence of Mr. Troy. "I am at
your disposal, sir," she said, quietly.
<P>
"Are you absolutely certain that you inclosed the bank-note in
the letter?" the lawyer asked.
<P>
"I certainly believe I inclosed it" Lady Lydiard answered. "But I
was so alarmed at the time by the sudden illness of my dog, that
I do not feel justified in speaking positively."
<P>
"Was anybody in the room with your Ladyship when you put the
inclosure in the letter--as you believe?"
<P>
"_I_ was in the room," said Moody. "I can swear that I saw her
Ladyship put the bank-note in the letter, and the letter in the
envelope."
<P>
"And seal the envelope?" asked Mr. Troy.
<P>
"No, sir. Her Ladyship was called away into the next room to the
dog, before she could seal the envelope."
<P>
Mr. Troy addressed himself once more to Lady Lydiard. "Did your
Ladyship take the letter into the next room with you?"
<P>
"I was too much alarmed to think of it, Mr. Troy. I left it here,
on the table."
<P>
"With the envelope open?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"How long were you absent in the other room?"
<P>
"Half an hour or more."
<P>
"Ha!" said Mr. Troy to himself. "This complicates it a little."
He reflected for a while, and then turned again to Moody. "Did
any of the servants know of this bank-note being in her
Ladyship's possession?"
<P>
"Not one of them," Moody answered.
<P>
"Do you suspect any of the servants?"
<P>
"Certainly not, sir."
<P>
"Are there any workmen employed in the house?"
<P>
"No, sir."
<P>
"Do you know of any persons who had access to the room while Lady
Lydiard was absent from it?"
<P>
"Two visitors called, sir."
<P>
"Who were they?"
<P>
"Her Ladyship's nephew, Mr. Felix Sweetsir, and the Honorable
Alfred Hardyman."
<P>
Mr. Troy shook his head irritably. "I am not speaking of
gentlemen of high position and repute," he said. "It's absurd
even to mention Mr. Sweetsir and Mr. Hardyman. My question
related to strangers who might have obtained access to the
drawing-room--people calling, with her Ladyship's sanction, for
subscriptions, for instance; or people calling with articles of
dress or ornament to be submitted to her Ladyship's inspection.""
<P>
"No such persons came to the house with my knowledge," Moody
answered.
<P>
Mr. Troy suspended the investigation, and took a turn
thoughtfully in the room. The theory on which his inquiries had
proceeded thus far had failed to produce any results. His
experience warned him to waste no more time on it, and to return
to the starting-point of the investigation--in other words, to
the letter. Shifting his point of view, he turned again to Lady
Lydiard, and tried his questions in a new direction.
<P>
"Mr. Moody mentioned just now," he said, "that your Ladyship was
called into the next room before you could seal your letter. On
your return to this room, did you seal the letter?"
<P>
"I was busy with the dog," Lady Lydiard answered. "Isabel Miller
was of no use in the boudoir, and I told her to seal it for
 me."
<P>
Mr. Troy started. The new direction in which he was pushing his
inquiries began to look like the right direction already. "Miss
Isabel Miller," he proceeded, "has been a resident under your
Ladyship's roof for some little time, I believe?"
<P>
"For nearly two years, Mr. Troy."
<P>
"As your Ladyship's companion and reader?"
<P>
"As my adopted daughter," her Ladyship answered, with marked
emphasis.
<P>
Wise Mr. Troy rightly interpreted the emphasis as a warning to
him to suspend the examination of her Ladyship, and to address to
Mr. Moody the far more serious questions which were now to come.
<P>
"Did anyone give you the letter before you left the house with
it?" he said to the steward. "Or did you take it yourself?"
<P>
"I took it myself, from the table here."
<P>
"Was it sealed?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Was anybody present when you took the letter from the table?"
<P>
"Miss Isabel was present."
<P>
"Did you find her alone in the room?"
<P>
"Yes, sir."
<P>
Lady Lydiard opened her lips to speak, and checked herself. Mr.
Troy, having cleared the ground before him, put the fatal
question.
<P>
"Mr. Moody," he said, "when Miss Isabel was instructed to seal
the letter, did she know that a bank-note was inclosed in it?"
<P>
Instead of replying, Robert drew back from the lawyer with a look
of horror. Lady Lydiard started to her feet--and checked herself
again, on the point of speaking.
<P>
"Answer him, Moody," she said, putting a strong constraint on
herself.
<P>
Robert answered very unwillingly. "I took the liberty of
reminding her ladyship that she had left her letter unsealed," he
said. "And I mentioned as my excuse for speaking"--he stopped,
and corrected himself--"_I believe_ I mentioned that a valuable
inclosure was in the letter."
<P>
"You believe?" Mr. Troy repeated. "Can't you speak more
positively than that?"
<P>
"_I_ can speak positively," said Lady Lydiard, with her eyes on
the lawyer. "Moody did mention the inclosure in the letter--in
Isabel Miller's hearing as well as in mine." She paused, steadily
controlling herself. "And what of that, Mr. Troy?" she added,
very quietly and firmly.
<P>
Mr. Troy answered quietly and firmly, on his side. "I am
surprised that your Ladyship should ask the question," he said.
<P>
"I persist in repeating the question," Lady Lydiard rejoined. "I
say that Isabel Miller knew of the inclosure in my letter--and I
ask, What of that?"
<P>
"And I answer," retorted the impenetrable lawyer, "that the
suspicion of theft rests on your Ladyship's adopted daughter, and
on nobody else."
<P>
"It's false!" cried Robert, with a burst of honest indignation.
"I wish to God I had never said a word to you about the loss of
the bank-note! Oh, my Lady! my Lady! don't let him distress you!
What does _he_ know about it?"
<P>
"Hush!" said Lady Lydiard. "Control yourself, and hear what he
has to say." She rested her hand on Moody's shoulder, partly to
encourage him, partly to support herself; and, fixing her eyes
again on Mr. Troy, repeated his last words, " 'Suspicion rests on
my adopted daughter, and on nobody else.' Why on nobody else?"
<P>
"Is your Ladyship prepared to suspect the Rector of St. Anne's of
embezzlement, or your own relatives and equals of theft?" Mr.
Troy asked. "Does a shadow of doubt rest on the servants? Not if
Mr. Moody's evidence is to be believed. Who, to our own certain
knowledge, had access to the letter while it was unsealed? Who
was alone in the room with it? And who knew of the inclosure in
it? I leave the answer to your Ladyship."
<P>
"Isabel Miller is as incapable of an act of theft as I am. There
is my answer, Mr. Troy."
<P>
The lawyer bowed resignedly, and advanced to the door.
<P>
"Am I to take your Ladyship's generous assertion as finally
disposing of the question of the lost bank-note?" he inquired.
<P>
Lady Lydiard met the challenge without shrinking from it.
<P>
"No!" she said. "The loss of the bank-note is known out of my
house. Other persons may suspect this innocent girl as you
suspect her. It is due to Isabel's reputation--her unstained
reputation, Mr. Troy!--that she should know what has happened,
and should have an opportunity of defending herself. She is in
the next room, Moody. Bring her here."
<P>
Robert's courage failed him: he trembled at the bare idea of
exposing Isabel to the terrible ordeal that awaited her. "Oh, my
Lady!" he pleaded, "think again before you tell the poor girl
that she is suspected of theft. Keep it a secret from her--the
shame of it will break her heart!"
<P>
"Keep it a secret," said Lady Lydiard, "when the Rector and the
Rector's wife both know of it! Do you think they will let the
matter rest where it is, even if I could consent to hush it up? I
must write to them; and I can't write anonymously after what has
happened. Put yourself in Isabel's place, and tell me if you
would thank the person who knew you to be innocently exposed to a
disgraceful suspicion, and who concealed it from you? Go, Moody!
The longer you delay, the harder it will be."
<P>
With his head sunk on his breast, with anguish written in every
line of his face, Moody obeyed. Passing slowly down the short
passage which connected the two rooms , and still shrinking from
the duty that had been imposed on him, he paused, looking through
the curtains which hung over the entrance to the boudoir.
