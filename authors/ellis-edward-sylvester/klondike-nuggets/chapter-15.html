<p>It was an unpleasant discovery to the boys that after parting
company with the ill-favored man who was known to be a friend
and comrade of the rogue Ike Hardman, and after travelling hundreds
of miles to this lonely spot, they should meet the fellow again.
Doubtless he was engaged on the same errand as themselves, and
the presumption was that sooner or later he would be joined by
Hardman.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there is any danger," said Roswell; "but it
would be more comfortable to know they were not going to be our
neighbors."</p>

<p>"Let's follow up the man and question him," said Frank, starting
to climb the rocks behind which the other's face had vanished.
It took only a few minutes to reach the spot; but when they did
so, and looked around, nothing was seen of him.</p>

<p>"He evidently doesn't wish to make our acquaintance," said Frank.</p>

<p>"I hope he will continue to feel that way; we must tell Jeff
and Tim about this. Let's hurry back to camp."</p>

<p>They now started to descend the stream, which they had followed
from the point where they left their luggage. By using the brook
as their guide, they were in no danger of losing their way.</p>

<p>About half the distance was passed when they came to a point
where the walking looked better on the other side. The stream
was so narrow that Frank, who was in the lead, easily leaped across.
Roswell started to follow, but tripped and fell on his hands and
knees, one foot splashing in the water, which was only a few inches
in depth and as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Frank, pausing and looking around at him.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I don't know what made me so awkward."</p>

<p>"Halloa! what's that?"</p>

<p>At first Frank thought it was a small fish holding itself stationary
in the brook; but that could not be, and he stooped down to see
more clearly. With an exclamation, he dashed his hand into the
water and drew out a rough, irregular nugget nearly two inches
in diameter each way. It was bright yellow in color, and so heavy
that there could be no doubt of its nature.</p>

<p>"It's gold!" he exclaimed in a half-frightened undertone, as
he passed it to Roswell, who was as much excited as he. He "hefted"
it and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "IT'S <em>GOLD!" HE EXCLAIMED</em>.]</p>

<p>"No mistake, it is. I wonder what it is worth."</p>

<p>"Several hundred dollars at least. I'll bet there are lots more
about here."</p>

<p>They straightway began a vigorous search up and down stream,
confident of finding other similar nuggets, but none was discovered,
and finally they reached the place where their baggage had been
left, and where Tim and Jeff were awaiting them.</p>

<p>"Look!" called the delighted Frank, holding up the nugget. "See
what we found!"</p>

<p>"Begorra, but I shouldn't wonder if that's worth something,"
remarked Tim, catching the contagion. Jeff merely smiled and reached
out his hand without any appearance of excitement.</p>

<p>"Let me have a look at it."</p>

<p>He never used glasses, nor did he bring any acid with which to
test such yellow metals as they might find, for he needed neither.
He had been trained too well in his early manhood.</p>

<p>The instant he noted its great weight he was convinced of the
truth. But, without speaking for a minute or two, he turned the
nugget over, held it up to the light, and then put it between
his big, sound teeth as if it were a hickory-nut which he wished
to crack. He looked at the abrasion made by his teeth, tossed
the nugget several feet in the air, and, catching it in his palm
as it descended, said:</p>

<p>"That's pure gold. Haven't you any more?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Frank; "we searched, but couldn't find any."</p>

<p>Jeff moved his hand up and down and closed one eye, as if that
would help him to estimate the weight more exactly.</p>

<p>"I should say that it is worth from six to eight hundred dollars;
you younkers have made purty good wages for to-day. I hope," he
added quizzically, "you'll be able to keep it up."</p>

<p>"And how have you made out?" asked Roswell.</p>

<p>"Tim says he didn't come onto anything that looks like pay dirt;
but I struck a spot that gives me hope. We'll locate here for
a while."</p>

<p>Of course it was impossible for the party to bring any material
with them from which to construct a dwelling. The regulation miner's
cabin is twelve by fourteen feet, with walls six or seven feet
high, and gables two feet higher. It consists of a single room,
with the roof heavily earthed and the worst sort of ventilation,
owing to the small windows and the necessity of keeping warm in
a climate that sometimes drops to fifty or sixty degrees below
zero. The miners keep close within the cabins during the terrible
winter weather, or, if it permits, they sink a shaft to bed-rock
and then tunnel in different directions. The ground never thaws
below a depth of two feet, so there is no need of shoring to prevent
its caving. The pay dirt is brought up by means of a small windlass
and thrown into a heap, where it remains until spring, when it
is washed out.</p>

<p>Since the season was well advanced, the men and boys prepared
themselves to wash the pay dirt whenever found. But, first of
all, it was necessary to establish a home for themselves while
they remained in the region. They had a single axe and a few utensils
besides the shovels, pans, and articles required in their work.
While Tim was prospecting, he gave more attention to searching
for a site for a home than for gold, and was fortunate enough
to find a place among the rocks, which was fitted up quite comfortably.
The stone furnished three and a part of four walls necessary,
and they cut branches, which were spread over the top and covered
with dirt for the roof. Owing to the moderate weather and the
trouble from smoke, the fire was kindled on the outside when required
for cooking purposes. The Yukon stove, because of its weight,
was left at Dawson City, whither one of them expected to go when
it became necessary to replenish their stores. Although the nights
were still cold, the weather was comparatively comfortable. Before
long it would become oppressive during the middle of the day.</p>

<p>As Jeff figured it out, they had enough food, tobacco, and supplies
to last for a couple of weeks, or possibly longer. If they struck
a claim which they wished to stake out, it would be necessary
for one of them to go to Dawson City to register it, the process
being quite simple.</p>

<p>The prospector is forbidden to exceed five hundred feet up and
down a stream, following the course of the valley, but the width
may run from base to base of the mountains. Thus a miner's claim
is one of the few things that is often broader than it is long.
Should the stream have no other claims located upon it, the one
thus made is known as "the discovery claim," and the stakes used
are marked 0. This claim is the starting-point, the next one up
and the next down the stream being marked No. 1, and there can
be only two such on any stream.</p>

<p>Next, four stakes must be driven in place, each being marked
with the owner's initials and the letters "M. L.," meaning "mining
location," after which it must be bounded with cross or end lines,
and within the ensuing sixty days the claim has to be filed with
the government's recorder at Dawson City. Should a claim be staked
before the discovery of gold, the prospector has sixty days in
which to find the metal. If he fails to do so in the time mentioned,
his claim lapses, since it is absolutely essential that he shall
find gold in order to hold it permanently.</p>
