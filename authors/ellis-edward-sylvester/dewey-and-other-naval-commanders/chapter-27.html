<p>An Unexpected Preacher&mdash;Andrew Hull Foote &mdash;His Character
and Early Career &mdash;His Brilliant Services in the War for
the Union.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning early in the Civil War a large assemblage
had gathered in a prominent church in a Western city for the purpose
of worship. But the hour for opening the services came and passed
and the preacher, the one indispensable individual, did not appear.
The auditors became uneasy. No one knew the cause of his absence
and no word came from the parsonage, which was at some distance
from the church. When the congregation were about to break up
and pass out a stranger, sitting near the front, quietly arose,
walked up the pulpit steps, gave out the opening hymn, led in
prayer and preached a sermon which impressed all by its plain,
practical truths. He held the attention of the people from the
opening to the close, and among the listeners were more than one
who felt that the unexplained absence of the regular pastor had
resulted in a gain, though a brief one, for them.</p>

<p>Naturally there was no little curiosity to learn the name of
the stranger. When approached by some of the leading brethren
at the close of the services, he modestly said he was Captain
Foote of the United States navy. He occasionally preached, when
there seemed to be a call for such work on his part, but preaching
was not his profession, and he would not have thought of entering
the pulpit had he not seen that it was a choice between doing
so and allowing the congregation to go home.</p>

<p>Andrew Hull Foote was born in New Haven, Conn., September 12,
1806. He belonged to a prominent family, his father, Samuel A.
Foote, having served in Congress for several terms, as United
States Senator, and as Governor of his State. The son received
the best educational training and was subjected to the strict
religious discipline characteristic of the Puritan families of
old New England. His romantic nature was deeply stirred by the
accounts of the naval exploits of his countrymen in the War of
1812, and he set his heart upon entering the navy. His mother
opposed, but, when she saw it was useless, wisely yielded. His
father's influence readily procured him the appointment of midshipman,
and he was directed to report on the schooner <em>Grampus</em>,
under the command of Lieutenant (afterward Admiral) Gregory.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>ANDREW HULL FOOTE</em>.]</p>

<p>The <em>Grampus</em> went to the West Indies in quest of pirates,
but never found any. Young Foote was then transferred to the sloop
of war <em>Peacock</em>, which had made such a glorious record
in the last war with Great Britain, his next transfer being to
the frigate <em>United States</em>, the flagship of Commodore
Isaac Hull, who won the famous victory over the <em>Guerriere</em>
in August, 1812.</p>

<p>The cruise lasted three years, and Foote returned to New York
in the spring of 1837. He made a visit to his home, when he was
once more ordered to the West Indies.</p>

<p>About this time he was brought under religious influence. He
read his Bible and spent many hours in prayer, and finally yielded
completely to God. He made his mother inexpressibly happy by sending
her the glad news, and thenceforward throughout his stirring life
he was one of the most humble, devout and consecrated of Christians.</p>

<p>Like Havelock, he did an amount of good among those placed under
his charge, the full extent of which can never be known in this
world. While on duty at the Naval Asylum in Philadelphia he persuaded
the men to give up their grog rations and sign a pledge of total
abstinence, and when executive officer on the <em>Cumberland</em>
he did the same thing with its crew. He was a voluntary chaplain
and gave a religious address on the berth deck every Sunday evening
to those who wished to listen.</p>

<p>Disease of the eyes incapacitated him for duty for a long time,
and he was much disappointed that he was not permitted to take
any part in the Mexican war. One of his most practical temperance
addresses was that, while engaged off the coast of Africa in suppressing
the slave trade, he persuaded the men under him on the <em>Perry</em>,
of which he was the commander, to give up the use of liquor. Although
exposed to one of the most pestilential climates in the world,
he did not lose a man.</p>

<p>At the breaking out of the Civil War he was in command of the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. He was overwhelmed with work for a time, and
was glad when, early in the autumn of 1861, he was ordered to
the West to help in the building of an inland navy on the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Captain Foote worked with the tremendous energy which he threw
into every task, and succeeded in getting together seven boats,
four of which were partly protected by armor. At the beginning
of February, 1862, he started from Cairo to ascend the Tennessee,
his objective point being Fort Henry, though the Confederates
were deceived into thinking it was Columbus, on the Mississippi.
He asked the Government for more men with which to man additional
boats, but they were not furnished, and he went forward with such
as he could get.</p>

<p>On the night preceding the attack on Fort Henry the little fleet
anchored abreast of the army under General Grant, which was encamped
on the bank. The night was cold and tempestuous, but the morning
dawned keen and clear, and no time was lost in preparing the flotilla
for the attack on the fort. He intimated to General Grant that
he must not linger if he wished to cut off the retreat of the
enemy. Grant assured him he would be on time to put his army in
motion.</p>

<p>Fort Henry stood on a bend in the river, which it commanded for
a long distance up and down stream. Foote placed his boats behind
an island a mile below the fort, with a view of avoiding the long
range rifles of the Confederates, which were liable to cripple
the gunboats before they could get into close action. The wooden
vessels halted upon coming in view of the fort, and the ironclads,
as they were called, moved slowly up stream abreast of one another,
firing their bow guns in answer to the shots of the rebels. The
latter had had the time to practice to acquire the exact range,
while the boats had yet to find it. They fired slowly and with
such accuracy that the infantry stationed outside of the works
hastily fled, though the gunners bravely remained at their posts.</p>

<p>Foote opened fire when not quite a mile from the fort. His instructions
were to fire slowly and with care, the result of which was that
guns were continually dismounted and the earth and sandbags sent
flying in every direction. It was while the attack was being pressed
in this vigorous fashion that a shell pierced the boiler of the
<em>Essex</em>, commanded by Lieutenant Porter, and caused so
many deaths, as has been related in a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>This appalling accident was a serious loss to Captain Foote,
for Porter was doing inestimable service when thus driven out
of action, but the daring commander pressed forward in the face
of the murderous fire, encouraged by the visible results of his
shots, which were playing frightful havoc against the defences
of the fort. Tilghman, the Confederate commander, displayed great
bravery, fighting until every one of his guns was dismounted.
Then, finding himself powerless to offer further resistance, he
hauled down his flag. Firing immediately ceased on the part of
the Union flotilla, and Foote sent a boat ashore to take possession.</p>

<p>Despite General Grant's usual promptness, he did not arrive in
time to intercept the flight of the garrison. As a consequence
the prisoners surrendered, including General Tilghman and his
staff, numbered less than a hundred. The others fled overland
to Fort Donelson, only to be compelled to surrender shortly afterward
to Grant in what proved to be the first great Union victory of
the war.</p>

<p>The severity of this battle is shown by the fact that Foote's
ship was struck 31 times, the <em>Essex</em> 15, and the <em>Carondelet</em>
6. The total number of killed, wounded and missing was 48. The
success was so decisive that Foote was applauded throughout the
North, sharing the well-earned honors with General Grant, whose
successful career is known to every boy in the land.</p>

<p>Foote now steamed down the river to Cairo and began the ascent
of the Cumberland, to assist General Grant, who was marching overland
to the attack on Fort Donelson. Dauntless as was the courage of
the naval leader, he knew his task was a hopeless one. He had
not only lost the <em>Essex</em>, but Fort Donelson was greatly
superior in strength to Fort Henry. The water assault, however,
was deemed a military necessity, and he did not hesitate.</p>

<p>On February 14 he advanced resolutely to the attack with his
two wooden gunboats and four partial ironclads. The tremendous
land batteries opened on this weak force the moment it came within
range, and the results were of the most destructive nature. As
usual, the chief attention was given to the flagship, which was
struck again and again by the flying shot and shell. Undismayed
by the awful tempest, Foote pushed steadily onward, cool, calm,
hopeful and prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>His pilot was a brave man, but under the frightful fire he began
to show a nervousness that caught the eye of Foote. Walking up
to him, he placed his hand in a kindly manner on his shoulder
and spoke encouragingly to him. While he was doing so, the poor
fellow was torn into pieces by a shot, and the captain himself
was badly wounded in the foot by a flying splinter. Paying no
heed to the bleeding member, he limped about the boat, swept by
the iron hail, and gave his orders as coolly as before. But the
shot that killed the pilot also smashed the wheel, and the unmanageable
boat began drifting down stream. The tiller ropes of another boat
were also cut about the same time, and she also floated helplessly
with the current. The Confederates increased their fire, and the
other two boats, also greatly damaged, followed the flagship,
and the ferocious fight that had lasted more than an hour was
over, with the Union flotilla badly repulsed.</p>

<p>The flagship had been struck 59 times, and 54 had been killed
and wounded on the different ships; but Foote would have maintained
the fight, with a fair probability of success, but for the destruction
of his steering gear.</p>

<p>Grant and Foote now formed a plan for the capture of Nashville,
but on the eve of starting were stopped by a telegraphic order
from General Halleck not to allow the gunboats to go further up
the river than Clarksville. Foote was greatly disappointed, and,
absolutely certain of capturing the city, telegraphed for permission
to do so, but it was refused. Thus he was left no alternative
but to return to Cairo.</p>

<p>While there, he learned that the Confederate force occupying
Columbus had evacuated the town and fortified themselves on Island
No. 10. They numbered about 8,000 and were under the command of
General Mackall, from Beauregard's army. Foote transferred his
flag to the ironclad <em>Benton</em> and advanced against the
powerful works that had been erected on the island. The bombardment
was continued for three weeks, without inflicting serious damage,
and there was little prospect of capturing the place from the
river, when General Pope arrived with a large land force; but
to reach the fort it was necessary for him to get his troops across
the river, and he had not a single transport to use for that purpose.</p>

<p>Pope's arrival below made it necessary to send a gunboat down
to him, for until that was done he could make no movement against
the rebel force there. The all-important question was whether
any one of the gunboats could run the terrific gauntlet of the
batteries that lined the shore. It looked as if the attempt must
result in the inevitable destruction of any craft before half
the distance could be accomplished. At a council of the officers
it was agreed that it was too hazardous to try to run one of the
gunboats past the batteries. Such was the opinion of every man
except Henry Walke, commander of the <em>Carondelet</em>, who
volunteered to try the seemingly impossible task. Captain Foote
reluctantly gave his consent.</p>

<p>It was understood that Walke was to make the attempt on the first
rainy or foggy night. In the event of success, he was to cooperate
with Pope, and, when he moved, to assist in the attack on the
fortifications. Captain Foote closed his instructions to his faithful
aide with the following impressive words:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
On this delicate and somewhat hazardous service to which I assign<br/>
you I must enjoin upon you the importance of keeping your lights<br/>
secreted in the hold or put out, keeping your officers and men<br/>
from speaking at all, when passing the forts, above a whisper, and<br/>
then only on duty, and of using every other precaution to prevent<br/>
the rebels suspecting that you are dropping below their batteries.

</p>
<p>
If you successfully perform this duty assigned to you, which you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so willingly undertake, it will reflect the highest credit upon you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all belonging to your vessel, and I doubt not but that the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government will fully appreciate and reward you for a service<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, I trust, will enable the army to cross the river and make a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successful attack in the rear, while we storm the batteries in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;front of this stronghold of the rebels.

</p>
<p>
Commending you and all who compose your command to the care and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection of God, who rules the world and directs all things, I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

</p>
<p>
<em>A.H. </em>Foote.

</p>
<p>
<em>P.S.<br/>
&</em>mdash;Should you meet with disaster, you will, as a last resort,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy the steam machinery, and, if possible, to escape, set fire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your gunboat, or sink her, and prevent her falling into the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands of the rebels.

</p>

<p>The night selected &mdash;April 4&mdash;was rainy and of inky blackness,
relieved by vivid flashes of lightning. No precaution that could
be thought of was neglected. Chains were twisted around the pilot-house
and other vulnerable parts, and wood was piled against the boilers,
with which the hose was connected, to make the jets of steam available
to repel boarders. On one side was lashed a boat loaded with pressed
hay, while a barge of coal was fastened on the side furthest from
the dangerous batteries, and the escape steam was led into the
paddle-wheel house in order to muffle the sound. Among the fully
armed crew were twenty of the most expert sharpshooters in the
army.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock when the <em>Carondelet</em> swung round
in the stream and started on its fearful race. The fleet fairly
held its breath, as officers and men listened and peered down
the river in the tempestuous darkness. Now and then the zigzagging
lightning gave a momentary glimpse of the craft moving away, but
the straining eye and ear caught no sight or sound.</p>

<p>But when the <em>Carondelet</em> was close to the batteries a
blaze suddenly shot up several feet above the chimneys. The soot
had caught fire and the reflection was thrown far out on the water.
The engineer immediately opened the flue caps and all was darkness
again. So quickly did this singular glow come and vanish that
it must have been mistaken by the sentinels for a part of the
lightning display, for it caused no alarm; but the turning of
the escape steam into the paddle-box had allowed the soot to get
dry, and they flamed up a second time. Though extinguished as
promptly as before, the sentinels knew something was wrong and
signalled to the batteries below that one of the boats of the
enemy was approaching.</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt concealment any longer. Walke ordered
the engine ahead at full speed and ran close to the shore nearest
the batteries, that their shot might pass over him. Aside from
the enemy, this was dangerous work, for there was no telling into
what obstruction the boat would dash. A man stood at the front
with lead and line, quietly calling out in a guarded voice the
soundings, which were repeated by a second man on deck, who forwarded
the report aft to Walke, standing beside the pilot.</p>

<p>All the time the rain was falling in torrents. Suddenly a dazzling
gleam showed the pilot he was speeding straight for a shoal under
the guns of the Confederate battery.</p>

<p>"Hard aport!" commanded the captain, and the heavy craft barely
missed the island, past which it shot at the highest speed. The
lightning flashes helped the <em>Carondelet</em> in more than
one way. It not only gave the pilot the necessary knowledge to
avoid running aground, but confused the Confederate gunners, who
sent most of their shots over the boat, which was not struck once
during its remarkable run down the Mississippi. Two shots had
entered the barge at her side, but not a man was hurt. The boat
was received with wild cheers by the expectant soldiers, who,
while hoping for the best, feared the worst.</p>

<p>It had been agreed between Walke and Captain Foote that in case
the former was successful, he was to make it known by firing minute
guns. The captain was listening intently, when through the rain
and darkness the welcome signals reached his ears, and he thanked
God that all had come out so well.</p>

<p>Now that General Pope had received the transport for which he
longed, Captain Foote breathed freely and prepared to give what
help he could in the attack upon the rebel fortifications; but,
to his surprise, Pope sent an urgent request that a second boat
should be sent to him on the next night, adding that the success
of the whole movement depended upon a compliance with this request.</p>

<p>Foote replied that it would be as safe to run the batteries at
midday as on a clear night; for a vessel had to pass not only
seven batteries, but be kept "head on" to a battery of eleven
guns, at the upper part of Island No. 10, and to pass within 300
yards of it. In deference to Pope's earnest request, Captain Foote
consented to prepare another boat, but would not permit it to
start until the night was favorable.</p>

<p>The second night was similar to the one described, and Lieutenant
Thompson, in charge of the <em>Pittsburg</em>, started down the
river at two o'clock in the morning. Although exposed to the same
fire as the <em>Carondelet</em>, he was equally fortunate, and
ran the gauntlet with the same good fortune.</p>

<p>The passage of these two ironclads sealed the fate of Island
No. 10, for Pope could now cross the river, and, by taking position
in the rear of the Confederate works, cut off the supplies of
the garrison. The crossing was made and the enemy's batteries
silenced. On the 8th the island was surrendered to Captain Foote
and General Pope, including the garrison of 5,000 men.</p>

<p>Captain Foote's next move was to Fort Pillow. All this time he
was suffering so severely from the wound in his foot that it affected
his spirits, usually buoyant and hopeful. Another disturbing cause
was the continual interference of General Halleck, who prevented
several movements that Foote knew must have resulted in important
successes.</p>

<p>His health continued to decline till finally the day came when
he was compelled to ask for a leave of absence. He went to his
brother's home in Cleveland, where his condition caused great
solicitude throughout the country. Afflictions crowded upon him.
He returned to his home, which was shadowed by the death of his
bright boy at the age of fourteen years. A few months later two
of his daughters died. How hollow sounded the praises of his countrymen
when his head was bowed with such overwhelming sorrow! He had
been made rear admiral, and, though still weak, was by his own
request assigned to the command of the North Atlantic squadron.
He went to New York to complete his preparations, but while there
succumbed to his illness, and died at the Astor House, June 26,
1863.</p>
