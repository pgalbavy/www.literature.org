		<p>Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,<br />
			Beloved from pole to pole!<br />
			To Mary Queen the praise be given!<br />
			She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,<br />
			That slid into my soul.
		</p>
		<p>The silly buckets on the deck,<br />
			That had so long remained,<br />
			I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<br />
			And when I awoke, it rained.
		</p>
		<p>My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<br />
			My garments all were dank;<br />
			Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<br />
			And still my body drank.
		</p>
		<p>I moved, and could not feel my limbs:<br />
			I was so light--almost<br />
			I thought that I had died in sleep,<br />
			And was a blessed ghost.
		</p>
		<p>And soon I heard a roaring wind:<br />
			It did not come anear;<br />
			But with its sound it shook the sails,<br />
			That were so thin and sere.
		</p>
		<p>The upper air burst into life!<br />
			And a hundred fire-flags sheen,<br />
			To and fro they were hurried about!<br />
			And to and fro, and in and out,<br />
			The wan stars danced between.
		</p>
		<p>And the coming wind did roar more loud,<br />
			And the sails did sigh like sedge;<br />
			And the rain poured down from one black cloud;<br />
			The Moon was at its edge.
		</p>
		<p>The thick black cloud was cleft, and still<br />
			The Moon was at its side:<br />
			Like waters shot from some high crag,<br />
			The lightning fell with never a jag,<br />
			A river steep and wide.
		</p>
		<p>The loud wind never reached the ship,<br />
			Yet now the ship moved on!<br />
			Beneath the lightning and the Moon<br />
			The dead men gave a groan.
		</p>
		<p>They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,<br />
			Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;<br />
			It had been strange, even in a dream,<br />
			To have seen those dead men rise.
		</p>
		<p>The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;<br />
			Yet never a breeze up blew;<br />
			The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,<br />
			Where they were wont to do:<br />
			They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--<br />
			We were a ghastly crew.
		</p>
		<p>The body of my brother's son,<br />
			Stood by me, knee to knee:<br />
			The body and I pulled at one rope,<br />
			But he said nought to me.
		</p>
		<p>"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"<br />
			Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
			'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,<br />
			Which to their corses came again,<br />
			But a troop of spirits blest:
		</p>
		<p>For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,<br />
			And clustered round the mast;<br />
			Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br />
			And from their bodies passed.
		</p>
		<p>Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br />
			Then darted to the Sun;<br />
			Slowly the sounds came back again,<br />
			Now mixed, now one by one.
		</p>
		<p>Sometimes a-dropping from the sky<br />
			I heard the sky-lark sing;<br />
			Sometimes all little birds that are,<br />
			How they seemed to fill the sea and air<br />
			With their sweet jargoning!
		</p>
		<p>And now 'twas like all instruments,<br />
			Now like a lonely flute;<br />
			And now it is an angel's song,<br />
			That makes the Heavens be mute.
		</p>
		<p>It ceased; yet still the sails made on<br />
			A pleasant noise till noon,<br />
			A noise like of a hidden brook<br />
			In the leafy month of June,<br />
			That to the sleeping woods all night<br />
			Singeth a quiet tune.
		</p>
		<p>Till noon we quietly sailed on,<br />
			Yet never a breeze did breathe:<br />
			Slowly and smoothly went the ship,<br />
			Moved onward from beneath.
		</p>
		<p>Under the keel nine fathom deep,<br />
			From the land of mist and snow,<br />
			The spirit slid: and it was he<br />
			That made the ship to go.<br />
			The sails at noon left off their tune,<br />
			And the ship stood still also.
		</p>
		<p>The Sun, right up above the mast,<br />
			Had fixed her to the ocean:<br />
			But in a minute she 'gan stir,<br />
			With a short uneasy motion--<br />
			Backwards and forwards half her length<br />
			With a short uneasy motion.
		</p>
		<p>Then like a pawing horse let go,<br />
			She made a sudden bound:<br />
			It flung the blood into my head,<br />
			And I fell down in a swound.
		</p>
		<p>How long in that same fit I lay,<br />
			I have not to declare;<br />
			But ere my living life returned,<br />
			I heard and in my soul discerned<br />
			Two VOICES in the air.
		</p>
		<p>"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?<br />
			By him who died on cross,<br />
			With his cruel bow he laid full low,<br />
			The harmless Albatross.
		</p>
		<p>"The spirit who bideth by himself<br />
			In the land of mist and snow,<br />
			He loved the bird that loved the man<br />
			Who shot him with his bow."
		</p>
		<p>The other was a softer voice,<br />
			As soft as honey-dew:<br />
			Quoth he, "The man hath penance done,<br />
			And penance more will do."
