<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A sigh under the flaming blue, a shiver of the sleeping sea,
a cool breath as if a door had been swung upon the frozen spaces
of the universe, and with a stir of leaves, with the nod of boughs,
with the tremble of slender branches the sea breeze struck the
coast, rushed up the river, swept round the broad reaches, and
travelled on in a soft ripple of darkening water, in the whisper
of branches, in the rustle of leaves of the awakened forests.
It fanned in Lakamba’s campong the dull red of expiring embers
into a pale brilliance; and, under its touch, the slender, upright
spirals of smoke that rose from every glowing heap swayed, wavered,
and eddying down filled the twilight of clustered shade trees
with the aromatic scent of the burning wood. The men who had been
dozing in the shade during the hot hours of the afternoon woke
up, and the silence of the big courtyard was broken by the hesitating
murmur of yet sleepy voices, by coughs and yawns, with now and
then a burst of laughter, a loud hail, a name or a joke sent out
in a soft drawl. Small groups squatted round the little fires,
and the monotonous undertone of talk filled the enclosure; the
talk of barbarians, persistent, steady, repeating itself in the
soft syllables, in musical tones of the never-ending discourses
of those men of the forests and the sea, who can talk most of
the day and all the night; who never exhaust a subject, never
seem able to thresh a matter out; to whom that talk is poetry
and painting and music, all art, all history; their only accomplishment,
their only superiority, their only amusement. The talk of camp
fires, which speaks of bravery and cunning, of strange events
and of far countries, of the news of yesterday and the news of
to-morrow. The talk about the dead and the living&mdash;about those
who fought and those who loved.</p>

<p>Lakamba came out on the platform before his own house and sat
down&mdash;perspiring, half asleep, and sulky&mdash;in a wooden armchair
under the shade of the overhanging eaves. Through the darkness
of the doorway he could hear the soft warbling of his womenkind,
busy round the looms where they were weaving the checkered pattern
of his gala sarongs. Right and left of him on the flexible bamboo
floor those of his followers to whom their distinguished birth,
long devotion, or faithful service had given the privilege of
using the chief’s house, were sleeping on mats or just sat up
rubbing their eyes: while the more wakeful had mustered enough
energy to draw a chessboard with red clay on a fine mat and were
now meditating silently over their moves. Above the prostrate
forms of the players, who lay face downward supported on elbow,
the soles of their feet waving irresolutely about, in the absorbed
meditation of the game, there towered here and there the straight
figure of an attentive spectator looking down with dispassionate
but profound interest. On the edge of the platform a row of high-heeled
leather sandals stood ranged carefully in a level line, and against
the rough wooden rail leaned the slender shafts of the spears
belonging to these gentlemen, the broad blades of dulled steel
looking very black in the reddening light of approaching sunset.</p>

<p>A boy of about twelve&mdash;the personal attendant of Lakamba&mdash;squatted
at his master’s feet and held up towards him a silver siri box.
Slowly Lakamba took the box, opened it, and tearing off a piece
of green leaf deposited in it a pinch of lime, a morsel of gambier,
a small bit of areca nut, and wrapped up the whole with a dexterous
twist. He paused, morsel in hand, seemed to miss something, turned
his head from side to side, slowly, like a man with a stiff neck,
and ejaculated in an ill-humoured bass&mdash;</p>

<p>"Babalatchi!"</p>

<p>The players glanced up quickly, and looked down again directly.
Those men who were standing stirred uneasily as if prodded by
the sound of the chief’s voice. The one nearest to Lakamba repeated
the call, after a while, over the rail into the courtyard. There
was a movement of upturned faces below by the fires, and the cry
trailed over the enclosure in sing-song tones. The thumping of
wooden pestles husking the evening rice stopped for a moment and
Babalatchi’s name rang afresh shrilly on women’s lips in various
keys. A voice far off shouted something&mdash;another, nearer, repeated
it; there was a short hubbub which died out with extreme suddenness.
The first crier turned to Lakamba, saying indolently&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is with the blind Omar."</p>

<p>Lakamba’s lips moved inaudibly. The man who had just spoken was
again deeply absorbed in the game going on at his feet; and the
chief&mdash;as if he had forgotten all about it already&mdash;sat with a
stolid face amongst his silent followers, leaning back squarely
in his chair, his hands on the arms of his seat, his knees apart,
his big blood-shot eyes blinking solemnly, as if dazzled by the
noble vacuity of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Babalatchi had gone to see old Omar late in the afternoon. The
delicate manipulation of the ancient pirate’s susceptibilities,
the skilful management of Aissa’s violent impulses engrossed him
to the exclusion of every other business&mdash;interfered with his
regular attendance upon his chief and protector&mdash;even disturbed
his sleep for the last three nights. That day when he left his
own bamboo hut&mdash;which stood amongst others in Lakamba’s campong&mdash;his
heart was heavy with anxiety and with doubt as to the success
of his intrigue. He walked slowly, with his usual air of detachment
from his surroundings, as if unaware that many sleepy eyes watched
from all parts of the courtyard his progress towards a small gate
at its upper end. That gate gave access to a separate enclosure
in which a rather large house, built of planks, had been prepared
by Lakamba’s orders for the reception of Omar and Aissa. It was
a superior kind of habitation which Lakamba intended for the dwelling
of his chief adviser&mdash;whose abilities were worth that honour,
he thought. But after the consultation in the deserted clearing&mdash;when
Babalatchi had disclosed his plan&mdash;they both had agreed that the
new house should be used at first to shelter Omar and Aissa after
they had been persuaded to leave the Rajah’s place, or had been
kidnapped from there&mdash;as the case might be. Babalatchi did not
mind in the least the putting off of his own occupation of the
house of honour, because it had many advantages for the quiet
working out of his plans. It had a certain seclusion, having an
enclosure of its own, and that enclosure communicated also with
Lakamba’s private courtyard at the back of his residence&mdash;a place
set apart for the female household of the chief. The only communication
with the river was through the great front courtyard always full
of armed men and watchful eyes. Behind the whole group of buildings
there stretched the level ground of rice-clearings, which in their
turn were closed in by the wall of untouched forests with undergrowth
so thick and tangled that nothing but a bullet&mdash;and that fired
at pretty close range&mdash;could penetrate any distance there.</p>

<p>Babalatchi slipped quietly through the little gate and, closing
it, tied up carefully the rattan fastenings. Before the house
there was a square space of ground, beaten hard into the level
smoothness of asphalte. A big buttressed tree, a giant left there
on purpose during the process of clearing the land, roofed in
the clear space with a high canopy of gnarled boughs and thick,
sombre leaves. To the right&mdash;and some small distance away from
the large house&mdash;a little hut of reeds, covered with mats, had
been put up for the special convenience of Omar, who, being blind
and infirm, had some difficulty in ascending the steep plankway
that led to the more substantial dwelling, which was built on
low posts and had an uncovered verandah. Close by the trunk of
the tree, and facing the doorway of the hut, the household fire
glowed in a small handful of embers in the midst of a large circle
of white ashes. An old woman&mdash;some humble relation of one of Lakamba’s
wives, who had been ordered to attend on Aissa&mdash;was squatting
over the fire and lifted up her bleared eyes to gaze at Babalatchi
in an uninterested manner, as he advanced rapidly across the courtyard.</p>

<p>Babalatchi took in the courtyard with a keen glance of his solitary
eye, and without looking down at the old woman muttered a question.
Silently, the woman stretched a tremulous and emaciated arm towards
the hut. Babalatchi made a few steps towards the doorway, but
stopped outside in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"O! Tuan Omar, Omar besar! It is I &mdash;Babalatchi!"</p>

<p>Within the hut there was a feeble groan, a fit of coughing and
an indistinct murmur in the broken tones of a vague plaint. Encouraged
evidently by those signs of dismal life within, Babalatchi entered
the hut, and after some time came out leading with rigid carefulness
the blind Omar, who followed with both his hands on his guide’s
shoulders. There was a rude seat under the tree, and there Babalatchi
led his old chief, who sat down with a sigh of relief and leaned
wearily against the rugged trunk. The rays of the setting sun,
darting under the spreading branches, rested on the white-robed
figure sitting with head thrown back in stiff dignity, on the
thin hands moving uneasily, and on the stolid face with its eyelids
dropped over the destroyed eyeballs; a face set into the immobility
of a plaster cast yellowed by age.</p>

<p>"Is the sun near its setting?" asked Omar, in a dull voice.</p>

<p>"Very near," answered Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"Where am I? Why have I been taken away from the place which
I knew&mdash;where I, blind, could move without fear? It is like black
night to those who see. And the sun is near its setting&mdash;and I
have not heard the sound of her footsteps since the morning! Twice
a strange hand has given me my food to-day. Why? Why? Where is
she?"</p>

<p>"She is near," said Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"And he?" went on Omar, with sudden eagerness, and a drop in
his voice. "Where is he? Not here. Not here!" he repeated, turning
his head from side to side as if in deliberate attempt to see.</p>

<p>"No! He is not here now," said Babalatchi, soothingly. Then,
after a pause, he added very low, "But he shall soon return."</p>

<p>"Return! O crafty one! Will he return? I have cursed him three
times,"  exclaimed Omar, with weak violence.</p>

<p>"He is&mdash;no doubt&mdash;accursed," assented Babalatchi, in a conciliating
manner&mdash;"and yet he will be here before very long &mdash;I know!"</p>

<p>"You are crafty and faithless. I have made you great. You were
dirt under my feet&mdash;less than dirt," said Omar, with tremulous
energy.</p>

<p>"I have fought by your side many times," said Babalatchi, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why did he come?" went on Omar. "Did you send him? Why did he
come to defile the air I breathe&mdash;to mock at my fate&mdash;to poison
her mind and steal her body? She has grown hard of heart to me.
Hard and merciless and stealthy like rocks that tear a ship’s
life out under the smooth sea." He drew a long breath, struggled
with his anger, then broke down suddenly. "I have been hungry,"
he continued, in a whimpering tone&mdash;"often I have been very hungry&mdash;and
cold&mdash;and neglected&mdash;and nobody near me. She has often forgotten
me&mdash;and my sons are dead, and that man is an infidel and a dog.
Why did he come? Did you show him the way?"</p>

<p>"He found the way himself, O Leader of the brave," said Babalatchi,
sadly. "I only saw a way for their destruction and our own greatness.
And if I saw aright, then you shall never suffer from hunger any
more. There shall be peace for us, and glory and riches."</p>

<p>"And I shall die to-morrow," murmured Omar, bitterly.</p>

<p>"Who knows? Those things have been written since the beginning
of the world," whispered Babalatchi, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Do not let him come back," exclaimed Omar.</p>

<p>"Neither can he escape his fate," went on Babalatchi. "He shall
come back, and the power of men we always hated, you and I, shall
crumble into dust in our hand." Then he added with enthusiasm,
"They shall fight amongst themselves and perish both."</p>

<p>"And you shall see all this, while, I . . ."</p>

<p>"True!" murmured Babalatchi, regretfully. "To you life is darkness."</p>

<p>"No! Flame!" exclaimed the old Arab, half rising, then falling
back in his seat. "The flame of that last day! I see it yet&mdash;the
last thing I saw! And I hear the noise of the rent earth&mdash;when
they all died. And I live to be the plaything of a crafty one,"
he added, with inconsequential peevishness.</p>

<p>"You are my master still," said Babalatchi, humbly. "You are
very wise&mdash;and in your wisdom you shall speak to Syed Abdulla
when he comes here&mdash;you shall speak to him as I advised, I, your
servant, the man who fought at your right hand for many years.
I have heard by a messenger that the Syed Abdulla is coming to-night,
perhaps late; for those things must be done secretly, lest the
white man, the trader up the river, should know of them. But he
will be here. There has been a surat delivered to Lakamba. In
it, Syed Abdulla says he will leave his ship, which is anchored
outside the river, at the hour of noon to-day. He will be here
before daylight if Allah wills."</p>

<p>He spoke with his eye fixed on the ground, and did not become
aware of Aissa’s presence till he lifted his head when he ceased
speaking. She had approached so quietly that even Omar did not
hear her footsteps, and she stood now looking at them with troubled
eyes and parted lips, as if she was going to speak; but at Babalatchi’s
entreating gesture she remained silent. Omar sat absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>"Ay wa! Even so!" he said at last, in a weak voice. "I am to
speak your wisdom, O Babalatchi! Tell him to trust the white man!
I do not understand. I am old and blind and weak. I do not understand.
I am very cold," he continued, in a lower tone, moving his shoulders
uneasily. He ceased, then went on rambling in a faint whisper.
"They are the sons of witches, and their father is Satan the stoned.
Sons of witches. Sons of witches." After a short silence he asked
suddenly, in a firmer voice&mdash;"How many white men are there here,
O crafty one?"</p>

<p>"There are two here. Two white men to fight one another," answered
Babalatchi, with alacrity.</p>

<p>"And how many will be left then? How many? Tell me, you who are
wise."</p>

<p>"The downfall of an enemy is the consolation of the unfortunate,"
said Babalatchi, sententiously. "They are on every sea; only the
wisdom of the Most High knows their number&mdash;but you shall know
that some of them suffer."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Babalatchi, will they die? Will they both die?" asked
Omar, in sudden agitation.</p>

<p>Aissa made a movement. Babalatchi held up a warning hand.</p>

<p>"They shall, surely, die," he said steadily, looking at the girl
with unflinching eye.</p>

<p>"Ay wa! But die soon! So that I can pass my hand over their faces
when Allah has made them stiff."</p>

<p>"If such is their fate and yours," answered Babalatchi, without
hesitation. "God is great!"</p>

<p>A violent fit of coughing doubled Omar up, and he rocked himself
to and fro, wheezing and moaning in turns, while Babalatchi and
the girl looked at him in silence. Then he leaned back against
the tree, exhausted.</p>

<p>"I am alone, I am alone," he wailed feebly, groping vaguely about
with his trembling hands. "Is there anybody near me? Is there
anybody? I am afraid of this strange place."</p>

<p>"I am by your side, O Leader of the brave," said Babalatchi,
touching his shoulder lightly. "Always by your side as in the
days when we both were young: as in the time when we both went
with arms in our hands."</p>

<p>"Has there been such a time, Babalatchi?" said Omar, wildly;
"I have forgotten. And now when I die there will be no man, no
fearless man to speak of his father’s bravery. There was a woman!
A woman! And she has forsaken me for an infidel dog. The hand
of the Compassionate is heavy on my head! Oh, my calamity! Oh,
my shame!"</p>

<p>He calmed down after a while, and asked quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the sun set, Babalatchi?"</p>

<p>"It is now as low as the highest tree I can see from here," answered
Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"It is the time of prayer," said Omar, attempting to get up.</p>

<p>Dutifully Babalatchi helped his old chief to rise, and they walked
slowly towards the hut. Omar waited outside, while Babalatchi
went in and came out directly, dragging after him the old Arab’s
praying carpet. Out of a brass vessel he poured the water of ablution
on Omar’s outstretched hands, and eased him carefully down into
a kneeling posture, for the venerable robber was far too infirm
to be able to stand. Then as Omar droned out the first words and
made his first bow towards the Holy City, Babalatchi stepped noiselessly
towards Aissa, who did not move all the time.</p>

<p>Aissa looked steadily at the one-eyed sage, who was approaching
her slowly and with a great show of deference. For a moment they
stood facing each other in silence. Babalatchi appeared embarrassed.
With a sudden and quick gesture she caught hold of his arm, and
with the other hand pointed towards the sinking red disc that
glowed, rayless, through the floating mists of the evening.</p>

<p>"The third sunset! The last! And he is not here," she whispered;
"what have you done, man without faith? What have you done?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have kept my word," murmured Babalatchi, earnestly.
"This morning Bulangi went with a canoe to look for him. He is
a strange man, but our friend, and shall keep close to him and
watch him without ostentation. And at the third hour of the day
I have sent another canoe with four rowers. Indeed, the man you
long for, O daughter of Omar! may come when he likes."</p>

<p>"But he is not here! I waited for him yesterday. To-day! To-morrow
I shall go."</p>

<p>"Not alive!" muttered Babalatchi to himself. "And do you doubt
your power," he went on in a louder tone&mdash;"you that to him are
more beautiful than an houri of the seventh Heaven? He is your
slave."</p>

<p>"A slave does run away sometimes," she said, gloomily, "and then
the master must go and seek him out."</p>

<p>"And do you want to live and die a beggar?" asked Babalatchi,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I care not," she exclaimed, wringing her hands; and the black
pupils of her wide-open eyes darted wildly here and there like
petrels before the storm.</p>

<p>"Sh! Sh!" hissed Babalatchi, with a glance towards Omar. "Do
you think, O girl! that he himself would live like a beggar, even
with you?"</p>

<p>"He is great," she said, ardently. "He despises you all! He despises
you all! He is indeed a man!"</p>

<p>"You know that best," muttered Babalatchi, with a fugitive smile&mdash;"but
remember, woman with the strong heart, that to hold him now you
must be to him like the great sea to thirsty men&mdash;a never-ceasing
torment, and a madness."</p>

<p>He ceased and they stood in silence, both looking on the ground,
and for a time nothing was heard above the crackling of the fire
but the intoning of Omar glorifying the God&mdash;his God, and the
Faith&mdash;his faith. Then Babalatchi cocked his head on one side
and appeared to listen intently to the hum of voices in the big
courtyard. The dull noise swelled into distinct shouts, then into
a great tumult of voices, dying away, recommencing, growing louder,
to cease again abruptly; and in those short pauses the shrill
vociferations of women rushed up, as if released, towards the
quiet heaven. Aissa and Babalatchi started, but the latter gripped
in his turn the girl’s arm and restrained her with a strong grasp.</p>

<p>"Wait," he whispered.</p>

<p>The little door in the heavy stockade which separated Lakamba’s
private ground from Omar’s enclosure swung back quickly, and the
noble exile appeared with disturbed mien and a naked short sword
in his hand. His turban was half unrolled, and the end trailed
on the ground behind him. His jacket was open. He breathed thickly
for a moment before he spoke.</p>

<p>"He came in Bulangi’s boat," he said, "and walked quietly till
he was in my presence, when the senseless fury of white men caused
him to rush upon me. I have been in great danger," went on the
ambitious nobleman in an aggrieved tone. "Do you hear that, Babalatchi?
That eater of swine aimed a blow at my face with his unclean fist.
He tried to rush amongst my household. Six men are holding him
now."</p>

<p>A fresh outburst of yells stopped Lakamba’s discourse. Angry
voices shouted: "Hold him. Beat him down. Strike at his head."</p>

<p>Then the clamour ceased with sudden completeness, as if strangled
by a mighty hand, and after a second of surprising silence the
voice of Willems was heard alone, howling maledictions in Malay,
in Dutch, and in English.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Lakamba, speaking with unsteady lips, "he blasphemes
his God. His speech is like the raving of a mad dog. Can we hold
him for ever? He must be killed!"</p>

<p>"Fool!" muttered Babalatchi, looking up at Aissa, who stood with
set teeth, with gleaming eyes and distended nostrils, yet obedient
to the touch of his restraining hand. "It is the third day, and
I have kept my promise," he said to her, speaking very low. "Remember,"
he added warningly&mdash;"like the sea to the thirsty! And now," he
said aloud, releasing her and stepping back, "go, fearless daughter,
go!"</p>

<p>Like an arrow, rapid and silent she flew down the enclosure,
and disappeared through the gate of the courtyard. Lakamba and
Babalatchi looked after her. They heard the renewed tumult, the
girl’s clear voice calling out, "Let him go!" Then after a pause
in the din no longer than half the human breath the name of Aissa
rang in a shout loud, discordant, and piercing, which sent through
them an involuntary shudder. Old Omar collapsed on his carpet
and moaned feebly; Lakamba stared with gloomy contempt in the
direction of the inhuman sound; but Babalatchi, forcing a smile,
pushed his distinguished protector through the narrow gate in
the stockade, followed him, and closed it quickly.</p>

<p>The old woman, who had been most of the time kneeling by the
fire, now rose, glanced round fearfully and crouched hiding behind
the tree. The gate of the great courtyard flew open with a great
clatter before a frantic kick, and Willems darted in carrying
Aissa in his arms. He rushed up the enclosure like a tornado,
pressing the girl to his breast, her arms round his neck, her
head hanging back over his arm, her eyes closed and her long hair
nearly touching the ground. They appeared for a second in the
glare of the fire, then, with immense strides, he dashed up the
planks and disappeared with his burden in the doorway of the big
house.</p>

<p>Inside and outside the enclosure there was silence. Omar lay
supporting himself on his elbow, his terrified face with its closed
eyes giving him the appearance of a man tormented by a nightmare.</p>

<p>"What is it? Help! Help me to rise!" he called out faintly.</p>

<p>The old hag, still crouching in the shadow, stared with bleared
eyes at the doorway of the big house, and took no notice of his
call. He listened for a while, then his arm gave way, and, with
a deep sigh of discouragement, he let himself fall on the carpet.</p>

<p>The boughs of the tree nodded and trembled in the unsteady currents
of the light wind. A leaf fluttered down slowly from some high
branch and rested on the ground, immobile, as if resting for ever,
in the glow of the fire; but soon it stirred, then soared suddenly,
and flew, spinning and turning before the breath of the perfumed
breeze, driven helplessly into the dark night that had closed
over the land.</p>
