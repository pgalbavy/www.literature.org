<p>Memory, which we are to consider to-day, introduces us to knowledge
in one of its forms. The analysis of knowledge will occupy us
until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult
part of our whole enterprise.</p>

<p>I do not myself believe that the analysis of knowledge can be
effected entirely by means of purely external observation, such
as behaviourists employ. I shall discuss this question in later
lectures. In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis
of memory-knowledge, both as an introduction to the problem of
knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed
in almost all other knowledge. Sensation, we decided, is not a
form of knowledge. It might, however, have been expected that
we should begin our discussion of knowledge with <em>PERCEPTION,
</em>i.e. with that integral experience of things in the environment,
out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis.
What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that
the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates&mdash;images
and expectations of their usual correlates&mdash;all of which are subjectively
indistinguishable from the sensation. The <em>FACT </em>of past
experience is essential in producing this filling-out of sensation,
but not the <em>RECOLLECTION </em>of past experience. The non-sensational
elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of
habit, produced by frequent correlations. Perception, according
to our definition in Lecture <em>VII, </em>is no more a form of
knowledge than sensation is, except in so far as it involves expectations.
The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very
difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially
obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non-sensational
elements of perception. On the other hand, memory raises many
difficult and very important problems, which it is necessary to
consider at the first possible moment.</p>

<p>One reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it
seems to be involved in the fact that images are recognized as
"copies" of past sensible experience. In the preceding lecture
I alluded to Hume's principle "that all our simple ideas in their
first appearance are derived from simple impressions, which are
correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent." Whether
or not this principle is liable to exceptions, everyone would
agree that is has a broad measure of truth, though the word "exactly"
might seem an overstatement, and it might seem more correct to
say that ideas <em>APPROXIMATELY </em>represent impressions. Such
modifications of Hume's principle, however, do not affect the
problem which I wish to present for your consideration, namely:
Why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always, approximately
or exactly, copies of sensations? What sort of evidence is there?
And what sort of evidence is logically possible? The difficulty
of this question arises through the fact that the sensation which
an image is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists,
and can therefore only be known by memory, while, on the other
hand, memory of past sensations seems only possible by means of
present images. How, then, are we to find any way of comparing
the present image and the past sensation? The problem is just
as acute if we say that images differ from their prototypes as
if we say that they resemble them; it is the very possibility
of comparison that is hard to understand.* We think we can know
that they are alike or different, but we cannot bring them together
in one experience and compare them. To deal with this problem,
we must have a theory of memory. In this way the whole status
of images as "copies" is bound up with the analysis of memory.</p>

* How, for example, can we obtain such knowledge as the<br/>
following: "If we look at, say, a red nose and perceive it,<br/>
and after a little while ekphore, its memory-image, we note<br/>
immediately how unlike, in its likeness, this memory-image<br/>
is to the original perception" (A. Wohlgemuth, "On the<br/>
Feelings and their Neural Correlate with an Examination of<br/>
the Nature of Pain," "Journal of Psychology," vol. viii,<br/>
part iv, June, 1917).

</p>
</div>
<p>In investigating memory-beliefs, there are certain points which
must be borne in mind. In the first place, everything constituting
a memory-belief is happening now, not in that past time to which
the belief is said to refer. It is not logically necessary to
the existence of a memory-belief that the event remembered should
have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world
sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with
a population that "remembered" a wholly unreal past. There is
no logically necessary connection between events at different
times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen
in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began
five minutes ago. Hence the occurrences which are <em>CALLED </em>knowledge
of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly
analysable into present contents, which might, theoretically,
be just what they are even if no past had existed.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that the non-existence of the past should
be entertained as a serious hypothesis. Like all sceptical hypotheses,
it is logically tenable, but uninteresting. All that I am doing
is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of
what occurs when we remember.</p>

<p>In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient
to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of
behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record. "Habit"
is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different
times; if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such
a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his
memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
And the same applies to images. If we are to know as it is supposed
we do&mdash;that images are "copies," accurate or inaccurate, of past
events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must
go to constitute this knowledge. For their mere occurrence, by
itself, would not suggest any connection with anything that had
happened before.</p>

<p>Can we constitute memory out of images together with suitable
beliefs? We may take it that memory-images, when they occur in
true memory, are (a) known to be copies, (b) sometimes known to
be imperfect copies (cf. footnote on previous page). How is it
possible to know that a memory-image is an imperfect copy, without
having a more accurate copy by which to replace it? This would
<em>SEEM </em>to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past
which is independent of images, by means of which we can criticize
image-memories. But I do not think such an inference is warranted.</p>

<p>What results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through
images of which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images
must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in
two series, of which one corresponds to the more or less remote
period in the past to which they refer, and the other to our greater
or less confidence in their accuracy. We will take the second
of these points first.</p>

<p>Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory-image
must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of
the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare
it with the present image. It might be suggested that vagueness
is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the
case. We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly
vague, which yet we do not trust&mdash;for example, under the influence
of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but
horribly distorted. In such a case we distrust our image in spite
of its being unusually clear. I think the characteristic by which
we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of <em>FAMILIARITY
</em>that accompanies them. Some images, like some sensations,
feel very familiar, while others feel strange. Familiarity is
a feeling capable of degrees. In an image of a well-known face,
for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when
this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar
parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts. I think it is by this
means that we become critical of images, not by some imageless
memory with which we compare them. I shall return to the consideration
of familiarity shortly.</p>

<p>I come now to the other characteristic which memory-images must
have in order to account for our knowledge of the past. They must
have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring
to more or less remote portions of the past. That is to say if
we suppose that A is the event remembered, B the remembering,
and t the interval of time between A and B, there must be some
characteristic of B which is capable of degrees, and which, in
accurately dated memories, varies as t varies. It may increase
as t increases, or diminish as t increases. The question which
of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability
of the characteristic in question.</p>

<p>In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur
in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some
remembered event. There may be a specific feeling which could
be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate
memory is concerned. But apart from this, there are other marks.
One of these is context. A recent memory has, usually, more context
than a more distant one. When a remembered event has a remembered
context, this may occur in two ways, either (a) by successive
images in the same order as their prototypes, or (b) by remembering
a whole process simultaneously, in the same way in which a present
process may be apprehended, through akoluthic sensations which,
by fading, acquire the mark of just-pastness in an increasing
degree as they fade, and are thus placed in a series while all
sensibly present. It will be context in this second sense, more
specially, that will give us a sense of the nearness or remoteness
of a remembered event.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal
relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the
time-order of two remembered events. Very often our knowledge
of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present
is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events.
It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at
all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation
to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an
essential part in the process of dating remembered events.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less
accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with
two sorts of feelings: (1) Those that may be called feelings of
familiarity; (2) those that may be collected together as feelings
giving a sense of pastness. The first lead us to trust our memories,
the second to assign places to them in the time-order.</p>

<p>We have now to analyse the memory-belief, as opposed to the characteristics
of images which lead us to base memory-beliefs upon them.</p>

<p>If we had retained the "subject" or "act" in knowledge, the whole
problem of memory would have been comparatively simple. We could
then have said that remembering is a direct relation between the
present act or subject and the past occurrence remembered: the
act of remembering is present, though its object is past. But
the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory
necessary. Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some
way resembling, or related to, what is remembered. And it is difficult
to find any ground, except a pragmatic one, for supposing that
memory is not sheer delusion, if, as seems to be the case, there
is not, apart from memory, any way of ascertaining that there
really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our
present remembering. What, if we followed Meinong's terminology,
we should call the "object" in memory, i.e. the past event which
we are said to be remembering, is unpleasantly remote from the
"content," i.e. the present mental occurrence in remembering.
There is an awkward gulf between the two, which raises difficulties
for the theory of knowledge. But we must not falsify observation
to avoid theoretical difficulties. For the present, therefore,
let us forget these problems, and try to discover what actually
occurs in memory.</p>

<p>Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of
memory must arrive at. In this case, as in most others, what may
be taken as certain in advance is rather vague. The study of any
topic is like the continued observation of an object which is
approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is
the quite vague knowledge that there is <em>SOME </em>object on
the road. If you attempt to be less vague, and to assert that
the object is an elephant, or a man, or a mad dog, you run a risk
of error; but the purpose of continued observation is to enable
you to arrive at such more precise knowledge. In like manner,
in the study of memory, the certainties with which you begin are
very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try
to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set
out. Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is
the goal at which we must aim.</p>

<p>The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is
knowledge of the past. We do not yet know with any precision what
we mean by "knowledge," and we must admit that in any given instance
our memory may be at fault. Nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might
urge in theory, we cannot practically doubt that we got up this
morning, that we did various things yesterday, that a great war
has been taking place, and so on. How far our knowledge of the
past is due to memory, and how far to other sources, is of course
a matter to be investigated, but there can be no doubt that memory
forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past.</p>

<p>The second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for
knowing the past than for knowing the future. We know some things
about the future, for example what eclipses there will be; but
this knowledge is a matter of elaborate calculation and inference,
whereas some of our knowledge of the past comes to us without
effort, in the same sort of immediate way in which we acquire
knowledge of occurrences in our present environment. We might
provisionally, though perhaps not quite correctly, define "memory"
as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in
our knowledge of the future; such a definition would at least
serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned, though
some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.</p>

<p>A third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two,
is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists
wish all truth to be. It seems clear that some of the things I
remember are trivial and without any visible importance for the
future, but that my memory is true (or false) in virtue of a past
event, not in virtue of any future consequences of my belief.
The definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs
and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory, as against
not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition
by means of coherence. These considerations, however, are taking
us away from psychology, to which we must now return.</p>

<p>It is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which
Bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his "Matter and
Memory," namely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort
that consists of independent recollection. He gives the instance
of learning a lesson by heart: when I know it by heart I am said
to "remember" it, but this merely means that I have acquired certain
habits; on the other hand, my recollection of (say) the second
time I read the lesson while I was learning it is the recollection
of a unique event, which occurred only once. The recollection
of a unique event cannot, so Bergson contends, be wholly constituted
by habit, and is in fact something radically different from the
memory which is habit. The recollection alone is true memory.
This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory. But
it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in
theory. Habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life,
and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be.
There is, for example, a habit of remembering a unique event.
When we have once described the event, the words we have used
easily become habitual. We may even have used words to describe
it to ourselves while it was happening; in that case, the habit
of these words may fulfil the function of Bergson's true memory,
while in reality it is nothing but habit-memory. A gramophone,
by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents
of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones
as they like to believe.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of a difficulty in distinguishing the two
forms of memory in practice, there can be no doubt that both forms
exist. I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered
before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning,
and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.
It is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of
memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this,
we have not succeeded in understanding memory.</p>

<p>The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort
which is a form of knowledge. Whether knowledge itself is reducible
to habit is a question to which I shall return in a later lecture;
for the present I am only anxious to point out that, whatever
the true analysis of knowledge may be, knowledge of past occurrences
is not proved by behaviour which is due to past experience. The
fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers
any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it. Similarly,
the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to
which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having
been in the same situation before. Arguments in favour of (for
example) memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit-memory,
not of knowledge-memory. Samuel Butler's arguments in favour of
the view that an animal remembers something of the lives of its
ancestors* are, when examined, only arguments in favour of habit-memory.
Semon's two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch
knowledge-memory at all closely. They give laws according to which
images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss
our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which
is what constitutes knowledge-memory. It is this that is of interest
to theory of knowledge. I shall speak of it as "true" memory,
to distinguish it from mere habit acquired through past experience.
Before considering true memory, it will be well to consider two
things which are on the way towards memory, namely the feeling
of familiarity and recognition.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
* See his "Life and Habit and Unconscious Memory."

</p>
</div>
<p>We often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar,
without having any definite recollection of previous occasions
on which we have seen it. We have this feeling normally in places
where we have often been before&mdash;at home, or in well-known streets.
Most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to
spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings, which
are especially comforting when any danger threatens. The feeling
of familiarity has all sorts of degrees, down to the stage where
we dimly feel that we have seen a person before. It is by no means
always reliable; almost everybody has at some time experienced
the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened
before at some time. There are occasions when familiarity does
not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely
a vague feeling that <em>SOMETHING </em>is familiar. This is illustrated
by Turgenev's "Smoke," where the hero is long puzzled by a haunting
sense that something in his present is recalling something in
his past, and at last traces it to the smell of heliotrope. Whenever
the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object, it
leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that
we have found the appropriate object, which leads us to the judgment:
"<em>THIS </em>is familiar." I think we may regard familiarity
as a definite feeling, capable of existing without an object,
but normally standing in a specific relation to some feature of
the environment, the relation being that which we express in words
by saying that the feature in question is familiar. The judgment
that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product
of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such
as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.
Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling
of familiarity alone.</p>

<p>A further stage is <em>RECOGNITION. </em>This may be taken in
two senses, the first when a thing not merely feels familiar,
but we know it is such-and-such. We recognize our friend Jones,
we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on. Here we have
a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any
actual knowledge of the past. When we see a cat, we know it is
a cat because of previous cats we have seen, but we do not, as
a rule, recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we
have seen a cat. Recognition in this sense does not necessarily
involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object we
are seeing at the moment is associated with the word "cat," or
with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic
we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment. We are, of
course, in fact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that
we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and
above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be
impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of
recognition in this first sense of the word.</p>

<p>There is, however, another sense of the word, in which we mean
by recognition, not knowing the name of a thing or some other
property of it, but knowing that we have seen it before In this
sense recognition does involve knowledge about the Fast. This
knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
It does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event,
but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar
to something that happened before. It differs from the sense of
familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which
the sense of familiarity is not. I do not wish to undertake the
analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of
the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize
the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a
belief, which we may express approximately in the words: "This
has existed before."</p>

<p>There are, however, several points in which such an account of
recognition is inadequate. To begin with, it might seem at first
sight more correct to define recognition as "I have seen this
before" than as "this has existed before." We recognize a thing
(it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever
that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in
the world before. I am not sure that there is anything substantial
in this point. The definition of "my experience" is difficult;
broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what
I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms
of memory are among the most important. Thus, if I recognize a
thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which
I recognize it forms part of "my experience" by <em>DEFINITION:
</em>recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience
is singled out from the rest of the world. Of course, the words
"this has existed before" are a very inadequate translation of
what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition,
but that is unavoidable: words are framed to express a level of
thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable
of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition. I
shall return to what is virtually the same question in connection
with true memory, which raises exactly similar problems.</p>

<p>A second point is that, when we recognize something, it was not
in fact the very same thing, but only something similar, that
we experienced on a former occasion. Suppose the object in question
is a friend's face. A person's face is always changing, and is
not exactly the same on any two occasions. Common sense treats
it as one face with varying expressions; but the varying expressions
actually exist, each at its proper time, while the one face is
merely a logical construction. We regard two objects as the same,
for common-sense purposes, when the reaction they call for is
practically the same. Two visual appearances, to both of which
it is appropriate to say: "Hullo, Jones!" are treated as appearances
of one identical object, namely Jones. The name "Jones" is applicable
to both, and it is only reflection that shows us that many diverse
particulars are collected together to form the meaning of the
name "Jones." What we see on any one occasion is not the whole
series of particulars that make up Jones, but only one of them
(or a few in quick succession). On another occasion we see another
member of the series, but it is sufficiently similar to count
as the same from the standpoint of common sense. Accordingly,
when we judge "I have seen <em>THIS </em>before," we judge falsely
if "this" is taken as applying to the actual constituent of the
world that we are seeing at the moment. The word "this" must be
interpreted vaguely so as to include anything sufficiently like
what we are seeing at the moment. Here, again, we shall find a
similar point as regards true memory; and in connection with true
memory we will consider the point again. It is sometimes suggested,
by those who favour behaviourist views, that recognition consists
in behaving in the same way when a stimulus is repeated as we
behaved on the first occasion when it occurred. This seems to
be the exact opposite of the truth. The essence of recognition
is in the <em>DIFFERENCE </em>between a repeated stimulus and
a new one. On the first occasion there is no recognition; on the
second occasion there is. In fact, recognition is another instance
of the peculiarity of causal laws in psychology, namely, that
the causal unit is not a single event, but two or more events
Habit is the great instance of this, but recognition is another.
A stimulus occurring once has a certain effect; occurring twice,
it has the further effect of recognition. Thus the phenomenon
of recognition has as its cause the two occasions when the stimulus
has occurred; either alone is insufficient. This complexity of
causes in psychology might be connected with Bergson's arguments
against repetition in the mental world. It does not prove that
there are no causal laws in psychology, as Bergson suggests; but
it does prove that the causal laws of psychology are Prima facie
very different from those of physics. On the possibility of explaining
away the difference as due to the peculiarities of nervous tissue
I have spoken before, but this possibility must not be forgotten
if we are tempted to draw unwarranted metaphysical deductions.</p>

<p>True memory, which we must now endeavour to understand, consists
of knowledge of past events, but not of all such knowledge. Some
knowledge of past events, for example what we learn through reading
history, is on a par with the knowledge we can acquire concerning
the future: it is obtained by inference, not (so to speak) spontaneously.
There is a similar distinction in our knowledge of the present:
some of it is obtained through the senses, some in more indirect
ways. I know that there are at this moment a number of people
in the streets of New York, but I do not know this in the immediate
way in which I know of the people whom I see by looking out of
my window. It is not easy to state precisely wherein the difference
between these two sorts of knowledge consists, but it is easy
to feel the difference. For the moment, I shall not stop to analyse
it, but shall content myself with saying that, in this respect,
memory resembles the knowledge derived from the senses. It is
immediate, not inferred, not abstract; it differs from perception
mainly by being referred to the past.</p>

<p>In regard to memory, as throughout the analysis of knowledge,
there are two very distinct problems, namely (1) as to the nature
of the present occurrence in knowing; (2) as to the relation of
this occurrence to what is known. When we remember, the knowing
is now, while what is known is in the past. Our two questions
are, in the case of memory:</p>

<p>(1) What is the present occurrence when we remember?</p>

<p>(2) What is the relation of this present occurrence to the past
event which is remembered?</p>

<p>Of these two questions, only the first concerns the psychologist;
the second belongs to theory of knowledge. At the same time, if
we accept the vague datum with which we began, to the effect that,
in some sense, there is knowledge of the past, we shall have to
find, if we can, such an account of the present occurrence in
remembering as will make it not impossible for remembering to
give us knowledge of the past. For the present, however, we shall
do well to forget the problems concerning theory of knowledge,
and concentrate upon the purely psychological problem of memory.</p>

<p>Between memory-image and sensation there is an intermediate experience
concerning the immediate past. For example, a sound that we have
just heard is present to us in a way which differs both from the
sensation while we are hearing the sound and from the memory-image
of something heard days or weeks ago. James states that it is
this way of apprehending the immediate past that is "the <em>ORIGINAL
</em>of our experience of pastness, from whence we get the meaning
of the term"("Psychology," i, p. 604). Everyone knows the experience
of noticing (say) that the clock <em>HAS BEEN </em>striking, when
we did not notice it while it was striking. And when we hear a
remark spoken, we are conscious of the earlier words while the
later ones are being uttered, and this retention feels different
from recollection of something definitely past. A sensation fades
gradually, passing by continuous gradations to the status of an
image. This retention of the immediate past in a condition intermediate
between sensation and image may be called "immediate memory."
Everything belonging to it is included with sensation in what
is called the "specious present." The specious present includes
elements at all stages on the journey from sensation to image.
It is this fact that enables us to apprehend such things as movements,
or the order of the words in a spoken sentence. Succession can
occur within the specious present, of which we can distinguish
some parts as earlier and others as later. It is to be supposed
that the earliest parts are those that have faded most from their
original force, while the latest parts are those that retain their
full sensational character. At the beginning of a stimulus we
have a sensation; then a gradual transition; and at the end an
image. Sensations while they are fading are called "akoluthic"
sensations.* When the process of fading is completed (which happens
very quickly), we arrive at the image, which is capable of being
revived on subsequent occasions with very little change. True
memory, as opposed to "immediate memory," applies only to events
sufficiently distant to have come to an end of the period of fading.
Such events, if they are represented by anything present, can
only be represented by images, not by those intermediate stages,
between sensations and images, which occur during the period of
fading.</p>

<p>Immediate memory is important both because it provides experience
of succession, and because it bridges the gulf between sensations
and the images which are their copies. But it is now time to resume
the consideration of true memory.</p>

<p>Suppose you ask me what I ate for breakfast this morning. Suppose,
further, that I have not thought about my breakfast in the meantime,
and that I did not, while I was eating it, put into words what
it consisted of. In this case my recollection will be true memory,
not habit-memory. The process of remembering will consist of calling
up images of my breakfast, which will come to me with a feeling
of belief such as distinguishes memory-images from mere imagination-images.
Or sometimes words may come without the intermediary of images;
but in this case equally the feeling of belief is essential.</p>

<p>Let us omit from our consideration, for the present, the memories
in which words replace images. These are always, I think, really
habit-memories, the memories that use images being the typical
true memories.</p>

<p>Memory-images and imagination-images do not differ in their intrinsic
qualities, so far as we can discover. They differ by the fact
that the images that constitute memories, unlike those that constitute
imagination, are accompanied by a feeling of belief which may
be expressed in the words "this happened." The mere occurrence
of images, without this feeling of belief, constitutes imagination;
it is the element of belief that is the distinctive thing in memory.*</p>

</div>
<p>There are, if I am not mistaken, at least three different kinds
of belief-feeling, which we may call respectively memory, expectation
and bare assent. In what I call bare assent, there is no time-element
in the feeling of belief, though there may be in the content of
what is believed. If I believe that Caesar landed in Britain in
<em>B.C. 55, </em>the time-determination lies, not in the feeling
of belief, but in what is believed. I do not remember the occurrence,
but have the same feeling towards it as towards the announcement
of an eclipse next year. But when I have seen a flash of lightning
and am waiting for the thunder, I have a belief-feeling analogous
to memory, except that it refers to the future: I have an image
of thunder, combined with a feeling which may be expressed in
the words: "this will happen." So, in memory, the pastness lies,
not in the content of what is believed, but in the nature of the
belief-feeling. I might have just the same images and expect their
realization; I might entertain them without any belief, as in
reading a novel; or I might entertain them together with a time-determination,
and give bare assent, as in reading history. I shall return to
this subject in a later lecture, when we come to the analysis
of belief. For the present, I wish to make it clear that a certain
special kind of belief is the distinctive characteristic of memory.</p>

<p>The problem as to whether memory can be explained as habit or
association requires to be considered afresh in connection with
the causes of our remembering something. Let us take again the
case of my being asked what I had for breakfast this morning.
In this case the question leads to my setting to work to recollect.
It is a little strange that the question should instruct me as
to what it is that I am to recall. This has to do with understanding
words, which will be the topic of the next lecture; but something
must be said about it now. Our understanding of the words "breakfast
this morning" is a habit, in spite of the fact that on each fresh
day they point to a different occasion. "This morning" does not,
whenever it is used, mean the same thing, as "John" or "St. Paul's"
does; it means a different period of time on each different day.
It follows that the habit which constitutes our understanding
of the words "this morning" is not the habit of associating the
words with a fixed object, but the habit of associating them with
something having a fixed time-relation to our present. This morning
has, to-day, the same time-relation to my present that yesterday
morning had yesterday. In order to understand the phrase "this
morning" it is necessary that we should have a way of feeling
time-intervals, and that this feeling should give what is constant
in the meaning of the words "this morning." This appreciation
of time-intervals is, however, obviously a product of memory,
not a presupposition of it. It will be better, therefore, if we
wish to analyse the causation of memory by something not presupposing
memory, to take some other instance than that of a question about
"this morning."</p>

<p>Let us take the case of coming into a familiar room where something
has been changed&mdash;say a new picture hung on the wall. We may at
first have only a sense that <em>SOMETHING </em>is unfamiliar,
but presently we shall remember, and say "that picture was not
on the wall before." In order to make the case definite, we will
suppose that we were only in the room on one former occasion.
In this case it seems fairly clear what happens. The other objects
in the room are associated, through the former occasion, with
a blank space of wall where now there is a picture. They call
up an image of a blank wall, which clashes with perception of
the picture. The image is associated with the belief-feeling which
we found to be distinctive of memory, since it can neither be
abolished nor harmonized with perception. If the room had remained
unchanged, we might have had only the feeling of familiarity without
the definite remembering; it is the change that drives us from
the present to memory of the past.</p>

<p>We may generalize this instance so as to cover the causes of
many memories. Some present feature of the environment is associated,
through past experiences, with something now absent; this absent
something comes before us as an image, and is contrasted with
present sensation. In cases of this sort, habit (or association)
explains why the present feature of the environment brings up
the memory-image, but it does not explain the memory-belief. Perhaps
a more complete analysis could explain the memory-belief also
on lines of association and habit, but the causes of beliefs are
obscure, and we cannot investigate them yet. For the present we
must content ourselves with the fact that the memory-image can
be explained by habit. As regards the memory-belief, we must,
at least provisionally, accept Bergson's view that it cannot be
brought under the head of habit, at any rate when it first occurs,
i.e. when we remember something we never remembered before.</p>

<p>We must now consider somewhat more closely the content of a memory-belief.
The memory-belief confers upon the memory-image something which
we may call "meaning;" it makes us feel that the image points
to an object which existed in the past. In order to deal with
this topic we must consider the verbal expression of the memory-belief.
We might be tempted to put the memory-belief into the words: "Something
like this image occurred." But such words would be very far from
an accurate translation of the simplest kind of memory-belief.
"Something like this image" is a very complicated conception.
In the simplest kind of memory we are not aware of the difference
between an image and the sensation which it copies, which may
be called its "prototype." When the image is before us, we judge
rather "this occurred." The image is not distinguished from the
object which existed in the past: the word "this" covers both,
and enables us to have a memory-belief which does not introduce
the complicated notion "something like this."</p>

<p>It might be objected that, if we judge "this occurred" when in
fact "this" is a present image, we judge falsely, and the memory-belief,
so interpreted, becomes deceptive. This, however, would be a mistake,
produced by attempting to give to words a precision which they
do not possess when used by unsophisticated people. It is true
that the image is not absolutely identical with its prototype,
and if the word "this" meant the image to the exclusion of everything
else, the judgment "this occurred" would be false. But identity
is a precise conception, and no word, in ordinary speech, stands
for anything precise. Ordinary speech does not distinguish between
identity and close similarity. A word always applies, not only
to one particular, but to a group of associated particulars, which
are not recognized as multiple in common thought or speech. Thus
primitive memory, when it judges that "this occurred," is vague,
but not false.</p>

<p>Vague identity, which is really close similarity, has been a
source of many of the confusions by which philosophy has lived.
Of a vague subject, such as a "this," which is both an image and
its prototype, contradictory predicates are true simultaneously:
this existed and does not exist, since it is a thing remembered,
but also this exists and did not exist, since it is a present
image. Hence Bergson's interpenetration of the present by the
past, Hegelian continuity and identity-in-diversity, and a host
of other notions which are thought to be profound because they
are obscure and confused. The contradictions resulting from confounding
image and prototype in memory force us to precision. But when
we become precise, our remembering becomes different from that
of ordinary life, and if we forget this we shall go wrong in the
analysis of ordinary memory.</p>

<p>Vagueness and accuracy are important notions, which it is very
necessary to understand. Both are a matter of degree. All thinking
is vague to some extent, and complete accuracy is a theoretical
ideal not practically attainable. To understand what is meant
by accuracy, it will be well to consider first instruments of
measurement, such as a balance or a thermometer. These are said
to be accurate when they give different results for very slightly
different stimuli.* A clinical thermometer is accurate when it
enables us to detect very slight differences in the temperature
of the blood. We may say generally that an instrument is accurate
in proportion as it reacts differently to very slightly different
stimuli. When a small difference of stimulus produces a great
difference of reaction, the instrument is accurate; in the contrary
case it is not.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. The<br/>
subject of accuracy and vagueness will be considered again<br/>
in Lecture <em>XIII</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Exactly the same thing applies in defining accuracy of thought
or perception. A musician will respond differently to very minute
differences in playing which would be quite imperceptible to the
ordinary mortal. A negro can see the difference between one negro
and another one is his friend, another his enemy. But to us such
different responses are impossible: we can merely apply the word
"negro" indiscriminately. Accuracy of response in regard to any
particular kind of stimulus is improved by practice. Understanding
a language is a case in point. Few Frenchmen can hear any difference
between the sounds "hall" and "hole," which produce quite different
impressions upon us. The two statements "the hall is full of water"
and "the hole is full of water" call for different responses,
and a hearing which cannot distinguish between them is inaccurate
or vague in this respect.</p>

<p>Precision and vagueness in thought, as in perception, depend
upon the degree of difference between responses to more or less
similar stimuli. In the case of thought, the response does not
follow immediately upon the sensational stimulus, but that makes
no difference as regards our present question. Thus to revert
to memory: A memory is "vague" when it is appropriate to many
different occurrences: for instance, "I met a man" is vague, since
any man would verify it. A memory is "precise" when the occurrences
that would verify it are narrowly circumscribed: for instance,
"I met Jones" is precise as compared to "I met a man." A memory
is "accurate" when it is both precise and true, i.e. in the above
instance, if it was Jones I met. It is precise even if it is false,
provided some very definite occurrence would have been required
to make it true.</p>

<p>It follows from what has been said that a vague thought has more
likelihood of being true than a precise one. To try and hit an
object with a vague thought is like trying to hit the bull's eye
with a lump of putty: when the putty reaches the target, it flattens
out all over it, and probably covers the bull's eye along with
the rest. To try and hit an object with a precise thought is like
trying to hit the bull's eye with a bullet. The advantage of the
precise thought is that it distinguishes between the bull's eye
and the rest of the target. For example, if the whole target is
represented by the fungus family and the bull's eye by mushrooms,
a vague thought which can only hit the target as a whole is not
much use from a culinary point of view. And when I merely remember
that I met a man, my memory may be very inadequate to my practical
requirements, since it may make a great difference whether I met
Brown or Jones. The memory "I met Jones" is relatively precise.
It is accurate if I met Jones, inaccurate if I met Brown, but
precise in either case as against the mere recollection that I
met a man.</p>

<p>The distinction between accuracy and precision is however, not
fundamental. We may omit precision from out thoughts and confine
ourselves to the distinction between accuracy and vagueness. We
may then set up the following definitions:</p>

<p>An instrument is "reliable" with respect to a given set of stimuli
when to stimuli which are not relevantly different it gives always
responses which are not relevantly different.</p>

<p>An instrument is a "measure" of a set of stimuli which are serially
ordered when its responses, in all cases where they are relevantly
different, are arranged in a series in the same order.</p>

<p>The "degree of accuracy" of an instrument which is a reliable
measurer is the ratio of the difference of response to the difference
of stimulus in cases where the difference of stimulus is small.*
That is to say, if a small difference of stimulus produces a great
difference of response, the instrument is very accurate; in the
contrary case, very inaccurate.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Strictly speaking, the limit of this, i.e. the derivative<br/>
of the response with respect to the stimulus.

</p>
</div>
<p>A mental response is called "vague" in proportion to its lack
of accuracy, or rather precision.</p>

<p>These definitions will be found useful, not only in the case
of memory, but in almost all questions concerned with knowledge.</p>

<p>It should be observed that vague beliefs, so far from being necessarily
false, have a better chance of truth than precise ones, though
their truth is less valuable than that of precise beliefs, since
they do not distinguish between occurrences which may differ in
important ways.</p>

<p>The whole of the above discussion of vagueness and accuracy was
occasioned by the attempt to interpret the word "this" when we
judge in verbal memory that "this occurred." The word "this,"
in such a judgment, is a vague word, equally applicable to the
present memory-image and to the past occurrence which is its prototype.
A vague word is not to be identified with a general word, though
in practice the distinction may often be blurred. A word is general
when it is understood to be applicable to a number of different
objects in virtue of some common property. A word is vague when
it is in fact applicable to a number of different objects because,
in virtue of some common property, they have not appeared, to
the person using the word, to be distinct. I emphatically do not
mean that he has judged them to be identical, but merely that
he has made the same response to them all and has not judged them
to be different. We may compare a vague word to a jelly and a
general word to a heap of shot. Vague words precede judgments
of identity and difference; both general and particular words
are subsequent to such judgments. The word "this" in the primitive
memory-belief is a vague word, not a general word; it covers both
the image and its prototype because the two are not distinguished.*</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* On the vague and the general cf. Ribot: "Evolution of<br/>
General Ideas," Open Court Co., 1899, p. 32: "The sole<br/>
permissible formula is this: Intelligence progresses from<br/>
the indefinite to the definite. If 'indefinite' is taken as<br/>
synonymous with general, it may be said that the particular<br/>
does not appear at the outset, but neither does the general<br/>
in any exact sense: the vague would be more appropriate. In<br/>
other words, no sooner has the intellect progressed beyond<br/>
the moment of perception and of its immediate reproduction<br/>
in memory, than the generic image makes its appearance, i.e.<br/>
a state intermediate between the particular and the general,<br/>
participating in the nature of the one and of the other&mdash;a<br/>
confused simplification."

</p>
</div>
<p>But we have not yet finished our analysis of the memory-belief.
The tense in the belief that "this occurred" is provided by the
nature of the belief-feeling involved in memory; the word "this,"
as we have seen, has a vagueness which we have tried to describe.
But we must still ask what we mean by "occurred." The image is,
in one sense, occurring now; and therefore we must find some other
sense in which the past event occurred but the image does not
occur.</p>

<p>There are two distinct questions to be asked: (1) What causes
us to say that a thing occurs? (2) What are we feeling when we
say this? As to the first question, in the crude use of the word,
which is what concerns us, memory-images would not be said to
occur; they would not be noticed in themselves, but merely used
as signs of the past event. Images are "merely imaginary"; they
have not, in crude thought, the sort of reality that belongs to
outside bodies. Roughly speaking, "real" things would be those
that can cause sensations, those that have correlations of the
sort that constitute physical objects. A thing is said to be "real"
or to "occur" when it fits into a context of such correlations.
The prototype of our memory-image did fit into a physical context,
while our memory-image does not. This causes us to feel that the
prototype was "real," while the image is "imaginary."</p>

<p>But the answer to our second question, namely as to what we are
feeling when we say a thing "occurs" or is "real," must be somewhat
different. We do not, unless we are unusually reflective, think
about the presence or absence of correlations: we merely have
different feelings which, intellectualized, may be represented
as expectations of the presence or absence of correlations. A
thing which "feels real" inspires us with hopes or fears, expectations
or curiosities, which are wholly absent when a thing "feels imaginary."
The feeling of reality is a feeling akin to respect: it belongs
<em>PRIMARILY </em>to whatever can do things to us without our
voluntary co-operation. This feeling of reality, related to the
memory-image, and referred to the past by the specific kind of
belief-feeling that is characteristic of memory, seems to be what
constitutes the act of remembering in its pure form.</p>

<p>We may now summarize our analysis of pure memory.</p>

<p>Memory demands (a) an image, (b) a belief in past existence.
The belief may be expressed in the words "this existed."</p>

<p>The belief, like every other, may be analysed into (1) the believing,
(2) what is believed. The believing is a specific feeling or sensation
or complex of sensations, different from expectation or bare assent
in a way that makes the belief refer to the past; the reference
to the past lies in the belief-feeling, not in the content believed.
There is a relation between the belief-feeling and the content,
making the belief-feeling refer to the content, and expressed
by saying that the content is what is believed.</p>

<p>The content believed may or may not be expressed in words. Let
us take first the case when it is not. In that case, if we are
merely remembering that something of which we now have an image
occurred, the content consists of (a) the image, (b) the feeling,
analogous to respect, which we translate by saying that something
is "real" as opposed to "imaginary," (c) a relation between the
image and the feeling of reality, of the sort expressed when we
say that the feeling refers to the image. This content does not
contain in itself any time-determination.</p>

<p>The time-determination lies in the nature of the belief feeling,
which is that called "remembering" or (better) "recollecting."
It is only subsequent reflection upon this reference to the past
that makes us realize the distinction between the image and the
event recollected. When we have made this distinction, we can
say that the image "means" the past event.</p>

<p>The content expressed in words is best represented by the words
"the existence of this," since these words do not involve tense,
which belongs to the belief-feeling, not to the content. Here
"this" is a vague term, covering the memory-image and anything
very like it, including its prototype. "Existence" expresses the
feeling of a "reality" aroused primarily by whatever can have
effects upon us without our voluntary co-operation. The word "of"
in the phrase "the existence of this" represents the relation
which subsists between the feeling of reality and the "this."</p>

<p>This analysis of memory is probably extremely faulty, but I do
not know how to improve it.</p>

<p><em>NOTE.-</em>When I speak of a <em>FEELING </em>of belief,
I use the word "feeling" in a popular sense, to cover a sensation
or an image or a complex of sensations or images or both; I use
this word because I do not wish to commit myself to any special
analysis of the belief-feeling.</p>
