<p></p>

<p>On a frosty morning with a little February sun, Clifford and Connie
went for a walk across the park to the wood. That is, Clifford chuffed
in his motor-chair, and Connie walked beside him.</p>

<p>The hard air was still sulphurous, but they were both used to it. Round
the near horizon went the haze, opalescent with frost and smoke, and on
the top lay the small blue sky; so that it was like being inside an
enclosure, always inside. Life always a dream or a frenzy, inside an
enclosure.</p>

<p>The sheep coughed in the rough, sere grass of the park, where frost lay
bluish in the sockets of the tufts. Across the park ran a path to the
wood-gate, a fine ribbon of pink. Clifford had had it newly gravelled
with sifted gravel from the pit-bank. When the rock and refuse of the
underworld had burned and given off its sulphur, it turned bright pink,
shrimp-coloured on dry days, darker, crab-coloured on wet. Now it was
pale shrimp-colour, with a bluish-white hoar of frost. It always
pleased Connie, this underfoot of sifted, bright pink. It's an ill wind
that brings nobody good.</p>

<p>Clifford steered cautiously down the slope of the knoll from the hall,
and Connie kept her hand on the chair. In front lay the wood, the hazel
thicket nearest, the purplish density of oaks beyond. From the wood's
edge rabbits bobbed and nibbled. Rooks suddenly rose in a black train,
and went trailing off over the little sky.</p>

<p>Connie opened the wood-gate, and Clifford puffed slowly through into
the broad riding that ran up an incline between the clean-whipped
thickets of the hazel. The wood was a remnant of the great forest where
Robin Hood hunted, and this riding was an old, old thoroughfare coming
across country. But now, of course, it was only a riding through the
private wood. The road from Mansfield swerved round to the north.</p>

<p>In the wood everything was motionless, the old leaves on the ground
keeping the frost on their underside. A jay called harshly, many little
birds fluttered. But there was no game; no pheasants. They had been
killed off during the war, and the wood had been left unprotected, till
now Clifford had got his game-keeper again.</p>

<p>Clifford loved the wood; he loved the old oak-trees. He felt they were
his own through generations. He wanted to protect them. He wanted this
place inviolate, shut off from the world.</p>

<p>The chair chuffed slowly up the incline, rocking and jolting on the
frozen clods. And suddenly, on the left, came a clearing where there
was nothing but a ravel of dead bracken, a thin and spindly sapling
leaning here and there, big sawn stumps, showing their tops and their
grasping roots, lifeless. And patches of blackness where the woodmen
had burned the brushwood and rubbish.</p>

<p>This was one of the places that Sir Geoffrey had cut during the war for
trench timber. The whole knoll, which rose softly on the right of the
riding, was denuded and strangely forlorn. On the crown of the knoll
where the oaks had stood, now was bareness; and from there you could
look out over the trees to the colliery railway, and the new works at
Stacks Gate. Connie had stood and looked, it was a breach in the pure
seclusion of the wood. It let in the world. But she didn't tell
Clifford.</p>

<p>This denuded place always made Clifford curiously angry. He had been
through the war, had seen what it meant. But he didn't get really angry
till he saw this bare hill. He was having it replanted. But it made him
hate Sir Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Clifford sat with a fixed face as the chair slowly mounted. When they
came to the top of the rise he stopped; he would not risk the long and
very jolty down-slope. He sat looking at the greenish sweep of the
riding downwards, a clear way through the bracken and oaks. It swerved
at the bottom of the hill and disappeared; but it had such a lovely
easy curve, of knights riding and ladies on palfreys.</p>

<p>'I consider this is really the heart of England,' said Clifford to
Connie, as he sat there in the dim February sunshine.</p>

<p>'Do you?' she said, seating herself in her blue knitted dress, on a
stump by the path.</p>

<p>'I do! this is the old England, the heart of it; and I intend to keep
it intact.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes!' said Connie. But, as she said it she heard the eleven-o'clock
hooters at Stacks Gate colliery. Clifford was too used to the sound to
notice.</p>

<p>'I want this wood perfect...untouched. I want nobody to trespass in
it,' said Clifford.</p>

<p>There was a certain pathos. The wood still had some of the mystery of
wild, old England; but Sir Geoffrey's cuttings during the war had given
it a blow. How still the trees were, with their crinkly, innumerable
twigs against the sky, and their grey, obstinate trunks rising from the
brown bracken! How safely the birds flitted among them! And once there
had been deer, and archers, and monks padding along on asses. The place
remembered, still remembered.</p>

<p>Clifford sat in the pale sun, with the light on his smooth, rather
blond hair, his reddish full face inscrutable.</p>

<p>'I mind more, not having a son, when I come here, than any other time,'
he said.</p>

<p>'But the wood is older than your family,' said Connie gently.</p>

<p>'Quite!' said Clifford. 'But we've preserved it. Except for us it would
go...it would be gone already, like the rest of the forest. One must
preserve some of the old England!'</p>

<p>'Must one?' said Connie. 'If it has to be preserved, and preserved
against the new England? It's sad, I know.'</p>

<p>'If some of the old England isn't preserved, there'll be no England at
all,' said Clifford. 'And we who have this kind of property, and the
feeling for it, must preserve it.'</p>

<p>There was a sad pause. 'Yes, for a little while,' said Connie.</p>

<p>'For a little while! It's all we can do. We can only do our bit. I feel
every man of my family has done his bit here, since we've had the
place. One may go against convention, but one must keep up tradition.'
Again there was a pause.</p>

<p>'What tradition?' asked Connie.</p>

<p>'The tradition of England! of this!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said slowly.</p>

<p>'That's why having a son helps; one is only a link in a chain,' he
said.</p>

<p>Connie was not keen on chains, but she said nothing. She was thinking
of the curious impersonality of his desire for a son.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry we can't have a son,' she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily, with his full, pale-blue eyes.</p>

<p>'It would almost be a good thing if you had a child by another man, he
said. 'If we brought it up at Wragby, it would belong to us and to the
place. I don't believe very intensely in fatherhood. If we had the
child to rear, it would be our own, and it would carry on. Don't you
think it's worth considering?'</p>

<p>Connie looked up at him at last. The child, her child, was just an 'it'
to him. It...it...it!</p>

<p>'But what about the other man?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Does it matter very much? Do these things really affect us very
deeply?...You had that lover in Germany...what is it now? Nothing
almost. It seems to me that it isn't these little acts and little
connexions we make in our lives that matter so very much. They pass
away, and where are they? Where...Where are the snows of
yesteryear?...It's what endures through one's life that matters; my own
life matters to me, in its long continuance and development. But what
do the occasional connexions matter? And the occasional sexual
connexions especially! If people don't exaggerate them ridiculously,
they pass like the mating of birds. And so they should. What does it
matter? It's the life-long companionship that matters. It's the living
together from day to day, not the sleeping together once or twice. You
and I are married, no matter what happens to us. We have the habit of
each other. And habit, to my thinking, is more vital than any
occasional excitement. The long, slow, enduring thing...that's what we
live by...not the occasional spasm of any sort. Little by little,
living together, two people fall into a sort of unison, they vibrate so
intricately to one another. That's the real secret of marriage, not
sex; at least not the simple function of sex. You and I are interwoven
in a marriage. If we stick to that we ought to be able to arrange this
sex thing, as we arrange going to the dentist; since fate has given us
a checkmate physically there.'</p>

<p>Connie sat and listened in a sort of wonder, and a sort of fear. She
did not know if he was right or not. There was Michaelis, whom she
loved; so she said to herself. But her love was somehow only an
excursion from her marriage with Clifford; the long, slow habit of
intimacy, formed through years of suffering and patience. Perhaps the
human soul needs excursions, and must not be denied them. But the point
of an excursion is that you come home again.</p>

<p>'And wouldn't you mind WHAT man's child I had?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Why, Connie, I should trust your natural instinct of decency and
selection. You just wouldn't let the wrong sort of fellow touch you.'</p>

<p>She thought of Michaelis! He was absolutely Clifford's idea of the
wrong sort of fellow.</p>

<p>'But men and women may have different feelings about the wrong sort of
fellow,' she said.</p>

<p>'No,' he replied. 'You care for me. I don't believe you would ever care
for a man who was purely antipathetic to me. Your rhythm wouldn't let
you.'</p>

<p>She was silent. Logic might be unanswerable because it was so
absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>'And should you expect me to tell you?' she asked, glancing up at him
almost furtively.</p>

<p>'Not at all, I'd better not know...But you do agree with me, don't you,
that the casual sex thing is nothing, compared to the long life lived
together? Don't you think one can just subordinate the sex thing to the
necessities of a long life? Just use it, since that's what we're driven
to? After all, do these temporary excitements matter? Isn't the whole
problem of life the slow building up of an integral personality,
through the years? living an integrated life? There's no point in a
disintegrated life. If lack of sex is going to disintegrate you, then
go out and have a love-affair. If lack of a child is going to
disintegrate you, then have a child if you possibly can. But only do
these things so that you have an integrated life, that makes a long
harmonious thing. And you and I can do that together...don't you
think?...if we adapt ourselves to the necessities, and at the same time
weave the adaptation together into a piece with our steadily-lived
life. Don't you agree?'</p>

<p>Connie was a little overwhelmed by his words. She knew he was right
theoretically. But when she actually touched her steadily-lived life
with him she...hesitated. Was it actually her destiny to go on weaving
herself into his life all the rest of her life? Nothing else?</p>

<p>Was it just that? She was to be content to weave a steady life with
him, all one fabric, but perhaps brocaded with the occasional flower of
an adventure. But how could she know what she would feel next year? How
could one ever know? How could one say Yes? for years and years? The
little yes, gone on a breath! Why should one be pinned down by that
butterfly word? Of course it had to flutter away and be gone, to be
followed by other yes's and no's! Like the straying of butterflies.</p>

<p>'I think you're right, Clifford. And as far as I can see I agree with
you. Only life may turn quite a new face on it all.'</p>

<p>'But until life turns a new face on it all, you do agree?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! I think I do, really.'</p>

<p>She was watching a brown spaniel that had run out of a side-path, and
was looking towards them with lifted nose, making a soft, fluffy bark.
A man with a gun strode swiftly, softly out after the dog, facing their
way as if about to attack them; then stopped instead, saluted, and was
turning downhill. It was only the new game-keeper, but he had
frightened Connie, he seemed to emerge with such a swift menace. That
was how she had seen him, like the sudden rush of a threat out of
nowhere.</p>

<p>He was a man in dark green velveteens and gaiters...the old style, with
a red face and red moustache and distant eyes. He was going quickly
downhill.</p>

<p>'Mellors!' called Clifford.</p>

<p>The man faced lightly round, and saluted with a quick little gesture, a
soldier!</p>

<p>'Will you turn the chair round and get it started? That makes it
easier,' said Clifford.</p>

<p>The man at once slung his gun over his shoulder, and came forward with
the same curious swift, yet soft movements, as if keeping invisible. He
was moderately tall and lean, and was silent. He did not look at Connie
at all, only at the chair.</p>

<p>'Connie, this is the new game-keeper, Mellors. You haven't spoken to
her ladyship yet, Mellors?'</p>

<p>'No, Sir!' came the ready, neutral words.</p>

<p>The man lifted his hat as he stood, showing his thick, almost fair
hair. He stared straight into Connie's eyes, with a perfect, fearless,
impersonal look, as if he wanted to see what she was like. He made her
feel shy. She bent her head to him shyly, and he changed his hat to his
left hand and made her a slight bow, like a gentleman; but he said
nothing at all. He remained for a moment still, with his hat in his
hand.</p>

<p>'But you've been here some time, haven't you?' Connie said to him.</p>

<p>'Eight months, Madam...your Ladyship!' he corrected himself calmly.</p>

<p>'And do you like it?'</p>

<p>She looked him in the eyes. His eyes narrowed a little, with irony,
perhaps with impudence.</p>

<p>'Why, yes, thank you, your Ladyship! I was reared here...'</p>

<p>He gave another slight bow, turned, put his hat on, and strode to take
hold of the chair. His voice on the last words had fallen into the
heavy broad drag of the dialect...perhaps also in mockery, because
there had been no trace of dialect before. He might almost be a
gentleman. Anyhow, he was a curious, quick, separate fellow, alone, but
sure of himself.</p>

<p>Clifford started the little engine, the man carefully turned the chair,
and set it nose-forwards to the incline that curved gently to the dark
hazel thicket.</p>

<p>'Is that all then, Sir Clifford?' asked the man.</p>

<p>'No, you'd better come along in case she sticks. The engine isn't
really strong enough for the uphill work.' The man glanced round for
his dog...a thoughtful glance. The spaniel looked at him and faintly
moved its tail. A little smile, mocking or teasing her, yet gentle,
came into his eyes for a moment, then faded away, and his face was
expressionless. They went fairly quickly down the slope, the man with
his hand on the rail of the chair, steadying it. He looked like a free
soldier rather than a servant. And something about him reminded Connie
of Tommy Dukes.</p>

<p>When they came to the hazel grove, Connie suddenly ran forward, and
opened the gate into the park. As she stood holding it, the two men
looked at her in passing, Clifford critically, the other man with a
curious, cool wonder; impersonally wanting to see what she looked like.
And she saw in his blue, impersonal eyes a look of suffering and
detachment, yet a certain warmth. But why was he so aloof, apart?</p>

<p>Clifford stopped the chair, once through the gate, and the man came
quickly, courteously, to close it.</p>

<p>'Why did you run to open?' asked Clifford in his quiet, calm voice,
that showed he was displeased. 'Mellors would have done it.'</p>

<p>'I thought you would go straight ahead,' said Connie. 'And leave you to
run after us?' said Clifford.</p>

<p>'Oh, well, I like to run sometimes!'</p>

<p>Mellors took the chair again, looking perfectly unheeding, yet Connie
felt he noted everything. As he pushed the chair up the steepish rise
of the knoll in the park, he breathed rather quickly, through parted
lips. He was rather frail really. Curiously full of vitality, but a
little frail and quenched. Her woman's instinct sensed it.</p>

<p>Connie fell back, let the chair go on. The day had greyed over; the
small blue sky that had poised low on its circular rims of haze was
closed in again, the lid was down, there was a raw coldness. It was
going to snow. All grey, all grey! the world looked worn out.</p>

<p>The chair waited at the top of the pink path. Clifford looked round for
Connie.</p>

<p>'Not tired, are you?' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' she said.</p>

<p>But she was. A strange, weary yearning, a dissatisfaction had started
in her. Clifford did not notice: those were not things he was aware of.
But the stranger knew. To Connie, everything in her world and life
seemed worn out, and her dissatisfaction was older than the hills.</p>

<p>They came to the house, and around to the back, where there were no
steps. Clifford managed to swing himself over on to the low, wheeled
house-chair; he was very strong and agile with his arms. Then Connie
lifted the burden of his dead legs after him.</p>

<p>The keeper, waiting at attention to be dismissed, watched everything
narrowly, missing nothing. He went pale, with a sort of fear, when he
saw Connie lifting the inert legs of the man in her arms, into the
other chair, Clifford pivoting round as she did so. He was frightened.</p>

<p>'Thanks, then, for the help, Mellors,' said Clifford casually, as he
began to wheel down the passage to the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>'Nothing else, Sir?' came the neutral voice, like one in a dream.</p>

<p>'Nothing, good morning!'</p>

<p>'Good morning, Sir.'</p>

<p>'Good morning! it was kind of you to push the chair up that hill...I
hope it wasn't heavy for you,' said Connie, looking back at the keeper
outside the door.</p>

<p>His eyes came to hers in an instant, as if wakened up. He was aware of
her.</p>

<p>'Oh no, not heavy!' he said quickly. Then his voice dropped again into
the broad sound of the vernacular: 'Good mornin' to your Ladyship!'</p>

<p>'Who is your game-keeper?' Connie asked at lunch.</p>

<p>'Mellors! You saw him,' said Clifford.</p>

<p>'Yes, but where did he come from?'</p>

<p>'Nowhere! He was a Tevershall boy...son of a collier, I believe.'</p>

<p>'And was he a collier himself?'</p>

<p>'Blacksmith on the pit-bank, I believe: overhead smith. But he was
keeper here for two years before the war...before he joined up. My
father always had a good Opinion of him, so when he came back, and went
to the pit for a blacksmith's job, I just took him back here as keeper.
I was really very glad to get him...its almost impossible to find a
good man round here for a gamekeeper...and it needs a man who knows the
people.'</p>

<p>'And isn't he married?'</p>

<p>'He was. But his wife went off with...with various men...but finally
with a collier at Stacks Gate, and I believe she's living there still.'</p>

<p>'So this man is alone?'</p>

<p>'More or less! He has a mother in the village...and a child, I
believe.'</p>

<p>Clifford looked at Connie, with his pale, slightly prominent blue eyes,
in which a certain vagueness was coming. He seemed alert in the
foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze,
smoky mist. And the haze seemed to be creeping forward. So when he
stared at Connie in his peculiar way, giving her his peculiar, precise
information, she felt all the background of his mind filling up with
mist, with nothingness. And it frightened her. It made him seem
impersonal, almost to idiocy.</p>

<p>And dimly she realized one of the great laws of the human soul: that
when the emotional soul receives a wounding shock, which does not kill
the body, the soul seems to recover as the body recovers. But this is
only appearance. It is really only the mechanism of the re-assumed
habit. Slowly, slowly the wound to the soul begins to make itself felt,
like a bruise, which Only slowly deepens its terrible ache, till it
fills all the psyche. And when we think we have recovered and
forgotten, it is then that the terrible after-effects have to be
encountered at their worst.</p>

<p>So it was with Clifford. Once he was 'well', once he was back at
Wragby, and writing his stories, and feeling sure of life, in spite of
all, he seemed to forget, and to have recovered all his equanimity. But
now, as the years went by, slowly, slowly, Connie felt the bruise of
fear and horror coming up, and spreading in him. For a time it had been
so deep as to be numb, as it were non-existent. Now slowly it began to
assert itself in a spread of fear, almost paralysis. Mentally he still
was alert. But the paralysis, the bruise of the too-great shock, was
gradually spreading in his affective self.</p>

<p>And as it spread in him, Connie felt it spread in her. An inward dread,
an emptiness, an indifference to everything gradually spread in her
soul. When Clifford was roused, he could still talk brilliantly and, as
it were, command the future: as when, in the wood, he talked about her
having a child, and giving an heir to Wragby. But the day after, all
the brilliant words seemed like dead leaves, crumpling up and turning
to powder, meaning really nothing, blown away on any gust of wind. They
were not the leafy words of an effective life, young with energy and
belonging to the tree. They were the hosts of fallen leaves of a life
that is ineffectual.</p>

<p>So it seemed to her everywhere. The colliers at Tevershall were talking
again of a strike, and it seemed to Connie there again it was not a
manifestation of energy, it was the bruise of the war that had been in
abeyance, slowly rising to the surface and creating the great ache of
unrest, and stupor of discontent. The bruise was deep, deep, deep...the
bruise of the false inhuman war. It would take many years for the
living blood of the generations to dissolve the vast black clot of
bruised blood, deep inside their souls and bodies. And it would need a
new hope.</p>

<p>Poor Connie! As the years drew on it was the fear of nothingness In her
life that affected her. Clifford's mental life and hers gradually began
to feel like nothingness. Their marriage, their integrated life based
on a habit of intimacy, that he talked about: there were days when it
all became utterly blank and nothing. It was words, just so many words.
The only reality was nothingness, and over it a hypocrisy of words.</p>

<p>There was Clifford's success: the bitch-goddess! It was true he was
almost famous, and his books brought him in a thousand pounds. His
photograph appeared everywhere. There was a bust of him in one of the
galleries, and a portrait of him in two galleries. He seemed the most
modern of modern voices. With his uncanny lame instinct for publicity,
he had become in four or five years one of the best known of the young
'intellectuals'. Where the intellect came in, Connie did not quite see.
Clifford was really clever at that slightly humorous analysis of people
and motives which leaves everything in bits at the end. But it was
rather like puppies tearing the sofa cushions to bits; except that it
was not young and playful, but curiously old, and rather obstinately
conceited. It was weird and it was nothing. This was the feeling that
echoed and re-echoed at the bottom of Connie's soul: it was all flag, a
wonderful display of nothingness; At the same time a display. A
display! a display! a display!</p>

<p>Michaelis had seized upon Clifford as the central figure for a play;
already he had sketched in the plot, and written the first act. For
Michaelis was even better than Clifford at making a display of
nothingness. It was the last bit of passion left in these men: the
passion for making a display. Sexually they were passionless, even
dead. And now it was not money that Michaelis was after. Clifford had
never been primarily out for money, though he made it where he could,
for money is the seal and stamp of success. And success was what they
wanted. They wanted, both of them, to make a real display...a man's own
very display of himself that should capture for a time the vast
populace.</p>

<p>It was strange...the prostitution to the bitch-goddess. To Connie,
since she was really outside of it, and since she had grown numb to the
thrill of it, it was again nothingness. Even the prostitution to the
bitch-goddess was nothingness, though the men prostituted themselves
innumerable times. Nothingness even that.</p>

<p>Michaelis wrote to Clifford about the play. Of course she knew about it
long ago. And Clifford was again thrilled. He was going to be displayed
again this time, somebody was going to display him, and to advantage.
He invited Michaelis down to Wragby with Act I.</p>

<p>Michaelis came: in summer, in a pale-coloured suit and white suede
gloves, with mauve orchids for Connie, very lovely, and Act I was a
great success. Even Connie was thrilled...thrilled to what bit of
marrow she had left. And Michaelis, thrilled by his power to thrill,
was really wonderful...and quite beautiful, in Connie's eyes. She saw
in him that ancient motionlessness of a race that can't be
disillusioned any more, an extreme, perhaps, of impurity that is pure.
On the far side of his supreme prostitution to the bitch-goddess he
seemed pure, pure as an African ivory mask that dreams impurity into
purity, in its ivory curves and planes.</p>

<p>His moment of sheer thrill with the two Chatterleys, when he simply
carried Connie and Clifford away, was one of the supreme moments of
Michaelis' life. He had succeeded: he had carried them away. Even
Clifford was temporarily in love with him...if that is the way one can
put it.</p>

<p>So next morning Mick was more uneasy than ever; restless, devoured,
with his hands restless in his trousers pockets. Connie had not visited
him in the night...and he had not known where to find her.
Coquetry!...at his moment of triumph.</p>

<p>He went up to her sitting-room in the morning. She knew he would come.
And his restlessness was evident. He asked her about his play...did she
think it good? He had to hear it praised: that affected him with the
last thin thrill of passion beyond any sexual orgasm. And she praised
it rapturously. Yet all the while, at the bottom of her soul, she knew
it was nothing.</p>

<p>'Look here!' he said suddenly at last. 'Why don't you and I make a
clean thing of it? Why don't we marry?'</p>

<p>'But I am married,' she said, amazed, and yet feeling nothing.</p>

<p>'Oh that!...he'll divorce you all right...Why don't you and I marry? I
want to marry. I know it would be the best thing for me...marry and
lead a regular life. I lead the deuce of a life, simply tearing myself
to pieces. Look here, you and I, we're made for one another...hand and
glove. Why don't we marry? Do you see any reason why we shouldn't?'</p>

<p>Connie looked at him amazed: and yet she felt nothing. These men, they
were all alike, they left everything out. They just went off from the
top of their heads as if they were squibs, and expected you to be
carried heavenwards along with their own thin sticks.</p>

<p>'But I am married already,' she said. 'I can't leave Clifford, you
know.'</p>

<p>'Why not? but why not?' he cried. 'He'll hardly know you've gone, after
six months. He doesn't know that anybody exists, except himself. Why
the man has no use for you at all, as far as I can see; he's entirely
wrapped up in himself.'</p>

<p>Connie felt there was truth in this. But she also felt that Mick was
hardly making a display of selflessness.</p>

<p>'Aren't all men wrapped up in themselves?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, more or less, I allow. A man's got to be, to get through. But
that's not the point. The point is, what sort of a time can a man give
a woman? Can he give her a damn good time, or can't he? If he can't
he's no right to the woman...' He paused and gazed at her with his
full, hazel eyes, almost hypnotic. 'Now I consider,' he added, 'I can
give a woman the darndest good time she can ask for. I think I can
guarantee myself.'</p>

<p>'And what sort of a good time?' asked Connie, gazing on him still with
a sort of amazement, that looked like thrill; and underneath feeling
nothing at all.</p>

<p>'Every sort of a good time, damn it, every sort! Dress, jewels up to a
point, any nightclub you like, know anybody you want to know, live the
pace...travel and be somebody wherever you go...Darn it, every sort of
good time.'</p>

<p>He spoke it almost in a brilliancy of triumph, and Connie looked at him
as if dazzled, and really feeling nothing at all. Hardly even the
surface of her mind was tickled at the glowing prospects he offered
her. Hardly even her most outside self responded, that at any other
time would have been thrilled. She just got no feeling from it, she
couldn't 'go off'. She just sat and stared and looked dazzled, and felt
nothing, only somewhere she smelt the extraordinarily unpleasant smell
of the bitch-goddess.</p>

<p>Mick sat on tenterhooks, leaning forward in his chair, glaring at her
almost hysterically: and whether he was more anxious out of vanity for
her to say Yes! or whether he was more panic-stricken for fear she
SHOULD say Yes! - who can tell?</p>

<p>'I should have to think about it,' she said. 'I couldn't say now. It
may seem to you Clifford doesn't count, but he does. When you think how
disabled he is...'</p>

<p>'Oh damn it all! If a fellow's going to trade on his disabilities, I
might begin to say how lonely I am, and always have been, and all the
rest of the my-eye-Betty-Martin sob-stuff! Damn it all, if a fellow's
got nothing but disabilities to recommend him...'</p>

<p>He turned aside, working his hands furiously in his trousers pockets.
That evening he said to her:</p>

<p>'You're coming round to my room tonight, aren't you? I don't darn know
where your room is.'</p>

<p>'All right!' she said.</p>

<p>He was a more excited lover that night, with his strange, small boy's
frail nakedness. Connie found it impossible to come to her crisis
before he had really finished his. And he roused a certain craving
passion in her, with his little boy's nakedness and softness; she had
to go on after he had finished, in the wild tumult and heaving of her
loins, while he heroically kept himself up, and present in her, with
all his will and self-offering, till she brought about her own crisis,
with weird little cries.</p>

<p>When at last he drew away from her, he said, in a bitter, almost
sneering little voice:</p>

<p>'You couldn't go off at the same time as a man, could you? You'd have
to bring yourself off! You'd have to run the show!'</p>

<p>This little speech, at the moment, was one of the shocks of her life.
Because that passive sort of giving himself was so obviously his only
real mode of intercourse.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' she said.</p>

<p>'You know what I mean. You keep on for hours after I've gone off...and
I have to hang on with my teeth till you bring yourself off by your own
exertions.'</p>

<p>She was stunned by this unexpected piece of brutality, at the moment
when she was glowing with a sort of pleasure beyond words, and a sort
of love for him. Because, after all, like so many modern men, he was
finished almost before he had begun. And that forced the woman to be
active.</p>

<p>'But you want me to go on, to get my own satisfaction?' she said.</p>

<p>He laughed grimly: 'I want it!' he said. 'That's good! I want to hang
on with my teeth clenched, while you go for me!'</p>

<p>'But don't you?' she insisted.</p>

<p>He avoided the question. 'All the darned women are like that,' he said.
'Either they don't go off at all, as if they were dead in there...or
else they wait till a chap's really done, and then they start in to
bring themselves off, and a chap's got to hang on. I never had a woman
yet who went off just at the same moment as I did.'</p>

<p>Connie only half heard this piece of novel, masculine information. She
was only stunned by his feeling against her...his incomprehensible
brutality. She felt so innocent.</p>

<p>'But you want me to have my satisfaction too, don't you?' she repeated.</p>

<p>'Oh, all right! I'm quite willing. But I'm darned if hanging on waiting
for a woman to go off is much of a game for a man...'</p>

<p>This speech was one of the crucial blows of Connie's life. It killed
something in her. She had not been so very keen on Michaelis; till he
started it, she did not want him. It was as if she never positively
wanted him. But once he had started her, it seemed only natural for her
to come to her own crisis with him. Almost she had loved him for
it...almost that night she loved him, and wanted to marry him.</p>

<p>Perhaps instinctively he knew it, and that was why he had to bring down
the whole show with a smash; the house of cards. Her whole sexual
feeling for him, or for any man, collapsed that night. Her life fell
apart from his as completely as if he had never existed.</p>

<p>And she went through the days drearily. There was nothing now but this
empty treadmill of what Clifford called the integrated life, the long
living together of two people, who are in the habit of being in the
same house with one another.</p>

<p>Nothingness! To accept the great nothingness of life seemed to be the
one end of living. All the many busy and important little things that
make up the grand sum-total of nothingness!</p>
