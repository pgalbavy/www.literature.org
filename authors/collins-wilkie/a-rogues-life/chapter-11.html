<P>
ONE morning I was engaged in the principal workroom with my
employer. We were alone. Old File and his son were occupied in
the garrets. Screw had been sent to Barkingham, accompanied, on
the usual precautionary plan, by Mill. They had been gone nearly
an hour when the doctor sent me into the next room to moisten and
knead up some plaster of Paris. While I was engaged in this
occupation, I suddenly heard strange voices in the large
workroom. My curiosity was instantly excited. I drew back the
little shutter from the peephole in the wall, and looked through
it.
<P>
I saw first my old enemy, Screw, with his villainous face much
paler than usual; next, two respectably-dressed strangers whom he
appeared to have brought into the room; and next to them Young
File, addressing himself to the doctor.
<P>
"I beg your pardon, sir," said my friend, the workman-like
footman; "but before these gentlemen say anything for themselves,
I wish to explain, as they seem strangers to you, that I only let
them in after I had heard them give the password. My instructions
are to let anybody in on our side of the door if they can give
the password. No offense, sir, but I want it to be understood
that I have done my duty."
<P>
"Quite right, my man," said the doctor, in his blandest manner.
"You may go back to your work."
<P>
Young File left the room, with a scrutinizing look for the two
strangers and a suspicious frown for Screw.
<P>
"Allow us to introduce ourselves," began the elder of the two
strangers.
<P>
"Pardon me for a moment," interposed the doctor. "Where is Mill?"
he added, turning to Screw.
<P>
"Doing our errands at Barkingham," answered Screw, turning paler
than ever.
<P>
"We happened to meet your two men, and to ask them the way to
your house," said the stranger who had just spoken. "This man,
with a caution that does him infinite credit, required to know
our business before he told us. We managed to introduce the
password--'Happy-go-lucky'--into our answer. This of course
quieted suspicion; and he, at our request, guided us here,
leaving his fellow-workman, as he has just told you, to do all
errands at Barkingham."
<P>
While these words were being spoken, I saw Screw's eyes wandering
discontentedly and amazedly round the room. He had left me in it
with the doctor before he went out: was he disappointed at not
finding me in it on his return?
<P>
While this thought was passing through my mind, the stranger
resumed his explanations.
<P>
"We are here," he said, "as agents appointed to transact private
business, out of London, for Mr. Manasseh, with whom you have
dealings, I think?"
<P>
"Certainly," said the doctor, with a smile.
<P>
"And who owes you a little account, which we are appointed to
settle."
<P>
"Just so!" remarked the doctor, pleasantly rubbing his hands one
over the other. "My good friend, Mr. Manasseh, does not like to
trust the post, I suppose? Very glad to make your acquaintance,
gentlemen. Have you got the little memorandum about you?"
<P>
"Yes; but we think there is a slight inaccuracy in it. Have you
any objection to let us refer to your ledger?"
<P>
"Not the least in the world. Screw, go down into my private
laboratory, open the table-drawer nearest the window, and bring
up a locked book, with a parchment cover, which you will find in
it."
<P>
As Screw obeyed I saw a look pass between him and the two
strangers which made me begin to feel a little uneasy. I thought
the doctor noticed it too; but he preserved his countenance, as
usual, in a state of the most unruffled composure.
<P>
"What a time that fellow is gone!" he exclaimed gayly. "Perhaps I
had better go and get the book myself."
<P>
The two strangers had been gradually lessening the distance
between the doctor and themselves, ever since Screw had left the
room. The last words were barely out of his mouth, before they
both sprang upon him, and pinioned his arms with their hands.
<P>
"Steady, my fine fellow," said Mr. Manasseh's head agent. "It's
no go. We are Bow Street runners, and we've got you for coining."
<P>
"Not a doubt of it," said the doctor, with the most superb
coolness. "You needn't hold me. I'm not fool enough to resist
when I'm fairly caught."
<P>
"Wait till we've searched you; and then we'll talk about that,"
said the runner.*
<P>
The doctor submitted to the searching with the patience of a
martyr. No offensive weapon being found in his pockets, they
allowed him to sit down unmolested in the nearest chair.
<P>
"Screw, I suppose?" said the doctor, looking inquiringly at the
officers.
<P>
"Exactly," said the principal man of the two. "We have been
secretly corresponding with him for weeks past. We have nabbed
the man who went out with him, and got him safe at Barkingham.
Don't expect Screw back with the ledger. As soon as he has made
sure that the rest of you are in the house, he is to fetch
another man or two of our Bow Street lot, who are waiting outside
till they hear from us. We only want an old man and a young one,
and a third pal of yours who is a gentleman born, to make a
regular clearance in the house. When we have once got you all, it
will be the prettiest capture that's ever been made since I was
in the force."
<P>
What the doctor answered to this I cannot say. Just as the
officer had done speaking, I heard footsteps approaching the room
in which I was listening. Was Screw looking for me? I instantly
closed the peephole and got behind the door. It opened back upon
me, and, sure enough, Screw entered cautiously.
<P>
An empty old wardrobe stood opposite the door. Evidently
suspecting that I might have taken the alarm and concealed myself
inside it, he approached it on tiptoe. On tiptoe also I followed
him; and, just as his hands were on the wardrobe door, my hands
were on his throat. He was a little man, and no match for me. I
easily and gently laid him on his back, in a voiceless and
half-suffocated state--throwing myself right over him, to keep
his legs quiet. When I saw his face getting black, and his small
eyes growing largely globular, I let go with one hand, crammed my
empty plaster of Paris bag, which lay close by, into his mouth,
tied it fast, secured his hands and feet, and then left him
perfectly harmless, while I took counsel with myself how best to
secure my own safety.
<P>
I should have made my escape at once; but for what I heard the
officer say about the men who were waiting outside. Were they
waiting near or at a distance? Were they on the watch at the
front or the back of the house? I thought it highly desirable to
give myself a chance of ascertaining their whereabouts from the
talk of the officers in the next room, before I risked the
possibility of running right into their clutches on the outer
side of the door.
<P>
I cautiously opened the peephole once more.
<P>
The doctor appeared to be still on the most friendly terms with
his vigilant guardians from Bow Street.
<P>
"Have you any objection to my ringing for some lunch, before we
are all taken off to London together?" I heard him ask in his
most cheerful tones. "A glass of wine and a bit of bread and
cheese won't do you any harm, gentlemen, if you are as hungry as
I am."
<P>
"If you want to eat and drink, order the victuals at once,"
replied one of the runners, sulkily. "We don't happen to want
anything ourselves."
<P>
"Sorry for it," said the doctor. "I have some of the best old
Madeira in England."
<P>
"Like enough," retorted the officer sarcastically. "But you see
we are not quite such fools as we look; and we have heard of such
a thing, in our time, as hocussed wine."
<P>
"O fie! fie!" exclaimed the doctor merrily. "Remember how well I
am behaving myself, and don't wound my feelings by suspecting me
of such shocking treachery as that!"
<P>
He moved to a corner of the room behind him, and touched a knob
in the wall which I had never before observed. A bell rang
directly, which had a new tone in it to my ears.
<P>
"Too bad," said the doctor, turning round again to the runners;
"really too bad, gentlemen, to suspect me of that!"
<P>
Shaking his head deprecatingly, he moved back to the corner,
pulled aside something in the wall, disclosed the mouth of a pipe
which was a perfect novelty to me, and called down it.
<P>
"Moses!"
<P>
It was the first time I had heard that name in the house.
<P>
"Who is Moses?" inquired the officers both together, advancing on
him suspiciously.
<P>
"Only my servant," answered the doctor. He turned once more to
the pipe, and called down it:
<P>
"Bring up the Stilton Cheese, and a bottle of the Old Madeira."
<P>
The cheese we had in use at that time was of purely Dutch
extraction. I remembered Port, Sherry, and Claret in my palmy
dinner-days at the doctor's family-table; but certainly not Old
Madeira. Perhaps he selfishly kept his best wine and his choicest
cheese for his own consumption.
<P>
"Sam," said one of the runners to the other, "you look to our
civil friend here, and I'll grab Moses when he brings up the
lunch."
<P>
"Would you like to see what the operation of coining is, while my
man is getting the lunch ready?" said the doctor. "It may be of
use to me at the trial, if you can testify that I afforded you
every facility for finding out anything you might want to know.
Only mention my polite anxiety to make things easy and
instructive from the very first, and I may get recommended to
mercy. See here--this queer-looking machine, gentlemen (from
which two of my men derive their nicknames), is what we call a
Mill-and-Screw."
<P>
He began to explain the machine with the manner and tone of a
lecturer at a scientific institution. In spite of themselves, the
officers burst out laughing. I looked round at Screw as the
doctor got deeper into his explanations. The traitor was rolling
his wicked eyes horribly at me. They presented so shocking a
sight, that I looked away again. What was I to do next? The
minutes were getting on, and I had not heard a word yet, through
the peephole, on the subject of the reserve of Bow Street runners
outside. Would it not be best to risk everything, and get away at
once by the back of the house?
<P>
Just as I had resolved on v enturing the worst, and making my
escape forthwith, I heard the officers interrupt the doctor's
lecture.
<P>
"Your lunch is a long time coming," said one of them.
<P>
"Moses is lazy," answered the doctor; "and the Madeira is in a
remote part of the cellar. Shall I ring again?"
<P>
"Hang your ringing again!" growled the runner, impatiently. "I
don't understand why our reserve men are not here yet. Suppose
you go and give them a whistle, Sam."
<P>
"I don't half like leaving you," returned Sam. "This learned
gentleman here is rather a shifty sort of chap; and it strikes me
that two of us isn't a bit too much to watch him."
<P>
"What's that?" exclaimed Sam's comrade, suspiciously.
<P>
A crash of broken crockery in the lower part of the house had
followed that last word of the cautious officer's speech.
Naturally, I could draw no special inference from the sound; but,
for all that, it filled me with a breathless interest and
suspicion, which held me irresistibly at the peephole--though the
moment before I had made up my mind to fly from the house.
<P>
"Moses is awkward as well as lazy," said the doctor. "He has
dropped the tray! Oh, dear, dear me! he has certainly dropped the
tray."
<P>
"Let's take our learned friend downstairs between us," suggested
Sam. "I shan't be easy till we've got him out of the house."
<P>
"And I shan't be easy if we don't handcuff him before we leave
the room," returned the other.
<P>
"Rude conduct, gentlemen--after all that has passed, remarkably
rude conduct," said the doctor. "May I, at least, get my hat
while my hands are at liberty? It hangs on that peg opposite to
us." He moved toward it a few steps into the middle of the room
while he spoke.
<P>
"Stop!" said Sam; "I'll get your hat for you. We'll see if
there's anything inside it or not, before you put it on."
<P>
The doctor stood stockstill, like a soldier at the word, Halt.
<P>
"And I'll get the handcuffs," said the other runner, searching
his coat-pockets.
<P>
The doctor bowed to him assentingly and forgivingly .
<P>
"Only oblige me with my hat, and I shall be quite ready for you,"
he said--paused for one moment, then repeated the words, "Quite
ready," in a louder tone--and instantly disappeared through the
floor!
<P>
I saw the two officers rush from opposite ends of the room to a
great opening in the middle of it. The trap-door on which the
doctor had been standing, and on which he had descended, closed
up with a bang at the same moment; and a friendly voice from the
lower regions called out gayly, "Good-by!"
<P>
The officers next made for the door of the room. It had been
locked from the other side. As they tore furiously at the handle,
the roll of the wheels of the doctor's gig sounded on the drive
in front of the house; and the friendly voice called out once
more, "Good-by!"
<P>
I waited just long enough to see the baffled officers unbarring
the window shutters for the purpose of giving the alarm, before I
closed the peephole, and with a farewell look at the distorted
face of my prostrate enemy, Screw, left the room.
<P>
The doctor's study-door was open as I passed it on my way
downstairs. The locked writing-desk, which probably contained the
only clew to Alicia's retreat that I was likely to find, was in
its usual place on the table. There was no time to break it open
on the spot. I rolled it up in my apron, took it off bodily under
my arm, and descended to the iron door on the staircase. Just as
I was within sight of it, it was opened from the landing on the
other side. I turned to run upstairs again, when a familiar voice
cried, "Stop!" and looking round, I beheld Young File.
<P>
"All right!" he said. "Father's off with the governor in the gig,
and the runners in hiding outside are in full cry after them. If
Bow Street can get within pistol-shot of the blood mare, all I
can say is, I give Bow Street full leave to fire away with both
barrels! Where's Screw?"
<P>
"Gagged by me in the casting-room."
<P>
"Well done, you! Got all your things, I see, under your arm? Wait
two seconds while I grab my money. Never mind the rumpus
upstairs--there's nobody outside to help them; and the gate's
locked, if there was."
<P>
He darted past me up the stairs. I could hear the imprisoned
officers shouting for help from the top windows. Their reserve
men must have been far away, by this time, in pursuit of the gig;
and there was not much chance of their getting useful help from
any stray countryman who might be passing along the road, except
in the way of sending a message to Barkingham. Anyhow we were
sure of a half hour to escape in, at the very least.
<P>
"Now then," said Young File, rejoining me; "let's be off by the
back way through the plantations. How came you to lay your lucky
hands on Screw?" he continued, when we had passed through the
iron door, and had closed it after us.
<P>
"Tell me first how the doctor managed to make a hole in the floor
just in the nick of time."
<P>
"What! did you see the trap sprung?"
<P>
"I saw everything."
<P>
"The devil you did! Had you any notion that signals were going
on, all the while you were on the watch? We have a regular set of
them in case of accidents. It's a rule that father, and me, and
the doctor are never to be in the workroom together--so as to
keep one of us always at liberty to act on the signals.--Where
are you going to?"
<P>
"Only to get the gardener's ladder to help us over the wall. Go
on."
<P>
"The first signal is a private bell--that means, <i>Listen at the
pipe.</i> The next is a call down the pipe for 'Moses'--that means,
<i>Danger! Lock the door.</i> 'Stilton Cheese' means, <i>Put the Mare
to;</i> and 'Old Madeira' <i>Stand by the trap.</i> The trap works in
that locked-up room you never got into; and when our hands are on
the machinery, we are awkward enough to have a little accident
with the luncheon tray. 'Quite Ready' is the signal to lower the
trap, which we do in the regular theater-fashion. We lowered the
doctor smartly enough, as you saw, and got out by the back
staircase. Father went in the gig, and I let them out and locked
the gates after them. Now you know as much as I've got breath to
tell you."
<P>
We scaled the wall easily by the help of the ladder. When we were
down on the other side, Young File suggested that the safest
course for us was to separate, and for each to take his own way.
We shook hands and parted. He went southward, toward London, and
I went westward, toward the sea-coast, with Doctor Dulcifer's
precious writing-desk safe under my arm.
