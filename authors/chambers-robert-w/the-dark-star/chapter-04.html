<p>There came the indeterminate year when Ruhannah finished school
and there was no money available to send her elsewhere for further
embellishment, no farther horizon than the sky over the Gayfield
hills, no other perspective than the main street of Gayfield with
the knitting mill at the end of it.</p>

<p>So into Gayfield Mill the girl walked, and found a place immediately
among the unskilled. And her career appeared to be predetermined
now, and her destiny a simple one&mdash;to work, to share the toil
and the gaieties of Gayfield with the majority of the other girls
she knew; to marry, ultimately, some boy, some clerk in one of
the Gayfield stores, some farmer lad, perhaps, possibly a school
teacher or a local lawyer or physician, or possibly the head of
some department in the mill, or maybe a minister&mdash;she was sufficiently
well bred and educated for any one of these.</p>

<p>The winter of her seventeenth year found her still very much
a child at heart, physically backward, a late adolescent, a little
shy, inclined to silences, romantic, sensitive to all beauty,
and passionately expressing herself only when curled up by the
stove with her pencil and the red light of the coals falling athwart
the slim hand that guided it.</p>

<p>She went sometimes to village parties, learned very easily to
dance, had no preferences among the youths of Gayfield, no romances.
For that matter, while she was liked and even furtively admired,
her slight shyness, reticence, and a vague, indefinite something
about her seemed to discourage familiar rustic gallantry. Also,
she was as thin and awkward as an overgrown lad, not thought to
be pretty, known to be poor. But for all that more than one young
man was vaguely haunted at intervals by some memory of her grey
eyes and the peculiar sweetness of her mouth, forgetting for the
moment several freckles on the delicate bridge of her nose and
several more on her sun-tanned cheeks.</p>

<p>She had an agreeable time that winter, enchanted to learn dancing,
happy at "showers" and parties, at sleigh rides and "chicken suppers,"
and the various species of village gaiety which ranged from moving
pictures every Thursday and Saturday nights to church entertainments,
amateur theatricals at the town hall, and lectures under the auspices
of the aristocratic D. O. F. &mdash;Daughters of the Old Frontier.</p>

<p>But she never saw any boy she preferred to any other, never was
conscious of being preferred, excepting once&mdash;and she was not
quite certain about that.</p>

<p>It was old Dick Neeland's son, Jim&mdash;vaguely understood to have
been for several years in Paris studying art&mdash;and who now turned
up in Gayfield during Christmas week.</p>

<p>Ruhannah remembered seeing him on several occasions when she
was a little child. He was usually tramping across country with
his sturdy father, Dick Neeland of Neeland's Mills&mdash;an odd, picturesque
pair with their setter dogs and burnished guns, and old Dick's
face as red as a wrinkled winter apple, and his hair snow-white.</p>

<p>There was six years' difference between their ages, Jim Neeland's
and hers, and she had always considered him a grown and formidable
man in those days. But that winter, when somebody at the movies
pointed him out to her, she was surprised to find him no older
than the other youths she skated with and danced with.</p>

<p>Afterward, at a noisy village party, she saw him dancing with
every girl in town, and the drop of Irish blood in this handsome,
careless young fellow established him at once as a fascinating
favourite.</p>

<p>Rue became quite tremulous over the prospect of dancing with
him. Presently her turn came; she rose with a sudden odd loss
of self-possession as he was presented, stood dumb, shy, unresponsive,
suffered him to lead her out, became slowly conscious that he
danced rather badly. But awe of him persisted even when he trod
on her slender foot.</p>

<p>He brought her an ice afterward, and seated himself beside her.</p>

<p>"I'm a clumsy dancer," he said. "How many times did I spike you?"</p>

<p>She flushed and would have found a pleasant word to reassure
him, but discovered nothing to say, it being perfectly patent
to them both that she had retired from the floor with a slight
limp.</p>

<p>"I'm a steam roller," he repeated carelessly. "But you dance
very well, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I have only learned to dance this winter."</p>

<p>"I thought you an expert. Do you live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I mean I live at Brookhollow."</p>

<p>"Funny. I don't remember you. Besides, I don't know your name&mdash;people
mumble so when they introduce a man."</p>

<p>"I'm Ruhannah Carew."</p>

<p>"Carew," he repeated, while a crease came between his eyebrows.
"Of Brookhollow&#11834; Oh, I know! Your father is the retired missionary&mdash;red
house facing the bridge."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, taking another look at her; "you're the
little girl daddy and I used to see across the fields when we
were shooting woodcock in the willows."</p>

<p>"I remember you," she said.</p>

<p>"I remember <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>She coloured gratefully.</p>

<p>"Because," he added, "dad and I were always afraid you'd wander
into range and we'd pepper you from the bushes. You've grown a
lot, haven't you?" He had a nice, direct smile though his speech
and manners were a trifle breezy, confident, and <em>sans fa√ßon</em>.
But he was at that age&mdash;which succeeds the age of bumptiousness&mdash;with
life and career before him, attainment, realisation, success,
everything the mystery of life holds for a young man who has just
flung open the gates and who takes the magic road to the future
with a stride instead of his accustomed pace.</p>

<p>He was already a man with a profession, and meant that she should
become aware of it.</p>

<p>Later in the evening somebody told her what a <em>personage</em>
he had become, and she became even more deeply thrilled, impressed,
and tremulously desirous that he should seek her out again, not
venturing to seek him, not dreaming of encouraging him to notice
her by glance or attitude&mdash;not even knowing, as yet, how to do
such things. She thought he had already forgotten her existence.</p>

<p>But that this thin, freckled young thing with grey eyes ought
to learn how much of a man he was remained somewhere in the back
of Neeland's head; and when he heard his hostess say that somebody
would have to see Rue Carew home, he offered to do it. And presently
went over and asked the girl if he might&mdash;not too patronisingly.</p>

<p>In the cutter, under fur, with the moonlight electrically brilliant
and the world buried in white, she ventured to speak of his art,
timidly, as in the presence of the very great.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said. "I studied in Paris. Wish I were back there.
But I've got to draw for magazines and illustrated papers; got
to make a living, you see. I teach at the Art League, too."</p>

<p>"How happy you must be in your career!" she said, devoutly meaning
it, knowing no better than to say it.</p>

<p>"It's a business," he corrected her, kindly.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;yes&mdash;but it is art, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, art!" he laughed. It was the fashion that year to shrug
when art was mentioned&mdash;reaction from too much gabble.</p>

<p>"We don't busy ourselves with art; we busy ourselves with business.
When they use my stuff I feel I'm getting on. You see," he admitted
with reluctant honesty, "I'm young at it yet &mdash;I haven't
had very much of my stuff in magazines yet."</p>

<p>After a silence, cursed by an instinctive truthfulness which
always spoiled any little plan to swagger:</p>

<p>"I've had several&mdash;well, about a dozen pictures reproduced."</p>

<p>One picture accepted by any magazine would have awed her sufficiently.
The mere fact that he was an artist had been enough to impress
her.</p>

<p>"Do you care for that sort of thing&mdash;drawing, painting, I mean?"
he inquired kindly.</p>

<p>She drew a quick breath, steadied her voice, and said she did.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may turn out stuff yourself some day."</p>

<p>She scarcely knew how to take the word "stuff." Vaguely she surmised
it to be professional vernacular.</p>

<p>She admitted shyly that she cared for nothing so much as drawing,
that she longed for instruction, but that such a dream was hopeless.</p>

<p>At first he did not comprehend that poverty barred the way to
her; he urged her to cultivate her talent, bestowed advice concerning
the Art League, boarding houses, studios, ways, means, and ends,
until she felt obliged to tell him how far beyond her means such
magic splendours lay.</p>

<p>He remained silent, sorry for her, thinking also that the chances
were against her having any particular talent, consoling a heart
that was unusually sympathetic and tender with the conclusion
that this girl would be happier here in Brookhollow than scratching
around the purlieus of New York to make both ends meet.</p>

<p>"It's a tough deal," he remarked abruptly. " &mdash;I mean this
art stuff. You work like the dickens and kick your heels in ante-rooms.
If they take your stuff they send you back to alter it or redraw
it. <em>I</em> don't know how anybody makes a living at it&mdash;in
the beginning."</p>

<p>"Don't <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"I? No." He reddened; but she could not notice it in the moonlight.
"No," he repeated; "I have an allowance from my father. I'm new
at it yet."</p>

<p>"Couldn't a man&mdash;a girl&mdash;support herself by drawing pictures
for magazines?" she inquired tremulously.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course there are some who have arrived&mdash;and they
manage to get on. Some even make wads, you know."</p>

<p>"W-wads?" she repeated, mystified.</p>

<p>"I mean a lot of money. There's that girl on the <em>Star</em>,
Jean Throssel, who makes all kinds of wealth, they say, out of
her spidery, filmy girls in ringlets and cheesecloth dinner gowns."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jean Throssel, and that Waythorne girl, Belinda Waythorne,
you know&mdash;does all that stuff for <em>The Looking Glass</em>&mdash;futurist
graft, no mouths on her people&mdash;she makes <em>hers</em>, I understand."</p>

<p>It was rather difficult for Rue to follow him amid the vernacular
mazes.</p>

<p>"Then, of course," he continued, "men like Alexander Fairless
and Philip Lightwood who imitates him, make fortunes out of their
drawing. I could name a dozen, perhaps. But the rest&mdash;hard sledding,
Miss Carew!"</p>

<p>"Is it <em>very</em> hard?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what on earth I'd do if dad didn't back me
as his fancy."</p>

<p>"A father ought to, if he can afford it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll pay my way some day. It's in me. I feel it; I know
it. I'll make plenty of money," he assured her confidently.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he smiled. "My friends tell me I've got it in me.
I have one friend in particular&mdash;the Princess Mistchenka&mdash;who
has all kinds of confidence in my future. When I'm blue she bolsters
me up. She's quite wonderful. I owe her a lot for asking me to
her Sunday nights and for giving me her friendship."</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a princess?" whispered the girl, who had drawn pictures
of thousands but was a little startled to realise that such fabled
creatures really exist.</p>

<p>"Is she <em>very</em> beautiful?" she added.</p>

<p>"She's tremendously pretty."</p>

<p>"Her&mdash;clothes are very beautiful, I suppose," ventured Rue.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;they're very&mdash;smart. Everything about her is smart. Her
Sunday night suppers are wonderful. You meet people who do things&mdash;all
sorts&mdash;everybody who is somebody."</p>

<p>He turned to her frankly:</p>

<p>"I think myself very lucky that the Princess Mistchenka should
be my friend, because, honestly, Miss Carew, I don't see what
there is in me to interest such a woman."</p>

<p>Rue thought she could see, but remained silent.</p>

<p>"If I had my way," said Neeland, a few moments later, "I'd drop
illustrating and paint battle scenes. But it wouldn't pay, you
see."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you support yourself by painting battles?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said honestly. "Of course I have hopes&mdash;intentions&#11834;"
he laughed, drew his reins; the silvery chimes clashed and jingled
and flashed in the moonlight; they had arrived.</p>

<p>At the door he said:</p>

<p>"I hope some day you'll have a chance to take lessons. Thank
you for dancing with me.... If you ever do come to New York to
study, I hope you'll let me know."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I will."</p>

<p>He was halfway to his sleigh, looked back, saw her looking back
as she entered the lighted doorway.</p>

<p>"Good night, Rue," he said impulsively, warmly sorry for her.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said.</p>

<p>The drop of Irish blood in him prompted him to go back to where
she stood framed in the lighted doorway. And the same drop was
no doubt responsible for his taking her by the waist and tilting
back her head in its fur hood and kissing her soft, warm lips.</p>

<p>She looked up at him in a flushed, bewildered sort of way, not
resisting; but his eyes were so gay and mischievous, and his quick
smile so engaging that a breathless, uncertain smile began to
edge her lips; and it remained stamped there, stiffening even
after he had jumped into his cutter and had driven away, jingling
joyously out into the dazzling moonshine.</p>

<p>In bed, the window open, and the covers pulled to her chin, Rue
lay wakeful, living over again the pleasures of the evening; and
Neeland's face was always before her open eyes, and his pleasant
voice seemed to be sounding in her ears. As for the kiss, it did
not trouble her. Girls she went with were not infrequently so
saluted by boys. That, being her own first experience, was important
only in that degree. And she shyly thought the experience agreeable.
And, as she recalled, revived, and considered all that Neeland
had said, it seemed to her that this young man led an enchanted
life and that such as he were indeed companions fit for princesses.</p>

<p>"Princess Mistchenka," she repeated aloud to herself. And somehow
it sounded vaguely familiar to the girl, as though somewhere,
long ago, she had heard another voice pronounce the name.</p>
