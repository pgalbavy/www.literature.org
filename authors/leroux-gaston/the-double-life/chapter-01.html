<p><em>THE </em>strange adventures of M. Théophraste Longuet, which
ended so tragically, originated in a visit to the prison of the
Conciergerie, on the 28th of June, 1899. Therefore this history
is modern; but the writer would say that, having read and examined
all the papers and writings of M. Théophraste Longuet, its recentness
does not detract from its sensational character.</p>

<p>When M. Longuet rang the bell of the Conciergerie he was accompanied
by his wife, Marceline, and M. Adolphe Lecamus. The latter was
a close friend. It was his physique that had attracted M. Longuet.
He was not handsome, but was tall and well built, and every movement
showed that strength which M. Longuet lacked. His forehead was
broad and convex, his eyebrows were heavy and straight. He had
a habit of every now and then lifting them gracefully to express
his disdain of others and his confidence in himself. His grey
eyes twinkled under near-sighted spectacles, and the straight
nose, the proud arch of the underlip, surmounted by a dark, flowing
mustache, the square outline of his chin and his amaranthine complexion,
all combined to accentuate his strong appearance.</p>

<p>He had been employed as postmaster at Turin, and had traveled
considerably. He had crossed the sea. This was also an attraction
to M. Longuet, who had never crossed anything, unless it was the
Seine.</p>

<p>M. Longuet had been a rubber stamp manufacturer, but had made
sufficient money to retire at an early age. He was the antithesis
of Adolphe in build and character. His face showed no marked intelligence,
and his slight build lent almost insignificance to his appearance.
He had, however, imagination, and he used to laughingly say to
Adolphe: "Even if I haven’t traveled, I run just as much risk
in walking the streets of Paris as one who crosses the ocean in
ships. Might not houses collapse or pots of flowers fall on one’s
head?" Thus he lived a monotonous existence, relieved only by
the morbid workings of his mind.</p>

<p>Before his retirement he had worked hard and had little time
to study, therefore, now he had leisure, it occurred to him to
occupy his time in improving his mind. It was with this intention
that we find him visiting the various buildings of historic interest
around Paris.</p>

<p>On ringing the bell of the Conciergerie the iron door turned
heavily on its hinges. A warden shaking the keys demanded of Théophraste
his permit. He had anticipated this and had received it that morning
from the Prefect of Police. He tendered it with satisfaction,
looking around at his companion with the confidence of anticipations
realized.</p>

<p>The gate-keeper turned the little company over to the Chief Warden,
who was passing at the time. Marceline was much impressed, and
as she leaned on Adolphe’s arm, thought of Marie Antoinette’s
dungeon, the Grevin Museum, and all the mysteries of this famous
prison. The Chief Warden said: "Are you French?" to which Théophraste
replied, laughingly, for he was typically French: "Do we look
like English people?"</p>

<p>"This is the first time," explained the Chief Warden, "that any
French people have asked permission to visit the Conciergerie.
French people are indifferent to things of interest in their own
country." "They are wrong, sir," replied Théophraste, wiping his
spectacles. "In the monuments of the past we have foundations
of the future." This idea rather pleased him, and he looked for
approval to Adolphe and Marceline. He continued following the
Warden. "As for me, I am an old Parisian and would have visited
all these places of interest long ago but for my work. I have
worked hard at my trade and the only leisure I got was when I
went to bed. That time is over now, sir, and now is the time for
me to educate myself," and he struck the century-old pavement
with the end of his green umbrella.</p>

<p>Passing a small door and a large wicket, they descended some
steps and were in the guard-room. The first thing to draw attention
made Adolphe laugh, Marceline blush, and Théophraste turn in disgust.
It was the capital of a Gothic column carved to symbolize the
story of Abelard and Heloise. Abelard was pleading with the Carion
Fulbert for his clemency, while the latter was taking the child
from Heloise.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said M. Longuet, "that in the name of art the
Government should tolerate such obscenities. That capital is a
disgrace to the Conciergerie and should be removed." M. Lecamus
did not agree, and said: "Many things are excusable in art if
they are done in the right spirit."</p>

<p>However, the subject was dropped and they were soon interested
in other parts of these old historic buildings. The Chief Warden
conducted them through the Tower of Cæsar, into the Silver Tower,
or Tower of Bon Bee. They thought of the thousand of illustrious
prisoners who had been incarcerated in prison for years. Marceline
could not keep from thinking of the martyred Marie Antoinette,
of Elizabeth, and the little Dauphin, and of the waxen gendarmes
in the museum, who watched over the Royal family. All this impressed
her, and her mind was continually carried back to those stirring
times. The Silver Tower had been transformed into a record office,
and the modern writing desks were in striking contrast to the
old medieval walls. Returning through the guard-room, they directed
their steps towards the Bon Bee Tower. Théophraste had read about
this tower and imagined he knew it well, so wishing to appear
well informed, asked of the Warden, "Is it not there, sir, that
the last meal of the Girondists was served? You ought certainly
to tell us exactly where to find the table, and also the place
which Camille des Moulins occupied." The Warden replied that the
Environdists had dined in the chapel and that they would soon
visit it.</p>

<p>"I wish to know Camille des Moulins’ place," said Théophraste,
"because he was a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"And mine also," said Marceline, with a look towards Adolphe,
which seemed to say, "Not as much as you, Adolphe."</p>

<p>But Adolphe laughed and said Camille was not a Girondist, he
was a Franciscan friar, a friend of Danton, a Septembrian.</p>

<p>Théophraste was vexed, and Marceline protested that if he had
been anything of the sort Lucille would not have married him.
Adolphe did not insist, but as they had by now reached the chamber
of torture, he feigned condescendingly to be interested in the
labels which adorned the drawers decorating the walls, "Hops,"
"Cinnamon," "Spice," etc.</p>

<p>"Here is the room in question. They have transformed it into
the doctor’s store-room."</p>

<p>"It is just as well, perhaps," said Théophraste, "but not so
impressive."</p>

<p>Adolphe and Marceline were of the same opinion. They were not
at all impressed. Here was the famous torture chamber. They expected
something else. They were disillusioned. Outside, when viewed
from the court of the Sundial, the formidable aspect of those
old feudal towers, the last vestige of the palace of the French
monarchy, momentarily brought fear and awe to their minds. That
prison had stood a thousand years, had known so many tragedies,
death rattles, legendary miseries, hidden secrets. It seemed that
one only had to step inside to find an inquisition court in some
dark corner, damp and funereal. Here seemed to be all the tragedies
of the history of Paris, as immortal as the very walls.</p>

<p>What a disillusion here in these towers with a little plaster
and paint they had made the office of the Director of Records,
the store-room of the prison doctor. One could carouse here where
once the hangman held sway. One could laugh where only the cries
of the tortured were heard.</p>

<p>Now there would have been nothing unusual about this visit to
the Conciergerie but for a very extraordinary incident which occurred
after the party had left the torture chamber. The incident was
weird and inexplicable, and while I read M. Longuet’s own description
of it, I confess I found it impossible to believe. Therefore I
went to the Chief Warden, who had shown the party round the prison,
and asked for his account of the incident.</p>

<p>He gave it to me in the following words:</p>

<p>Sir, the affair passed as usual, and the lady, the two gentlemen
and I visited the kitchen of St. Louis, which is now used as a
store-house for plaster. We proceeded towards the dungeon of Marie
Antoinette, which is now the chapel. On the way I showed them
the crucifix, before which she prayed before mounting the cart
which is now in the Director’s room. I told the man with the green
umbrella that we had been obliged to transfer the Queen’s arm-chair
to the Director’s room, because the English visitors had carried
away pieces from it as souvenirs. We had by this time arrived
at the end of the Street of Paris—you know the street that leads
from Paris to the Conciergerie. We passed through that frightfully
dark passage, where we found the grating behind which they cut
off the hair of the women before execution. You know that it is
the very same grating. It is a passage where never a ray of sunlight
penetrates. Marie Antoinette walked through that passage on the
day of her death. It is there that the old Conciergerie stands
just as it was hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>I was describing the Street of Paris, when suddenly the man with
the green umbrella cried out in a voice so unlike the previous
voice, so strangely that the other gentleman and lady looked startled:
"Zounds, it is the walk of the Straw Dealers." He said it in a
weird tone and his whole attitude was changed. He used the expression,
zounds, twice. I told him he was mistaken, that the walk of the
Straw Dealers is what we call to-day the Street of Paris. He answered
me in the same strange voice: "Zounds, you cannot tell me that!
I have lain there on that straw like the others!" I remarked to
him, smilingly, although not without a feeling of fear, that no
one had lain on that straw in the alley of the Straw Dealers for
more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>He was just about to answer me when his wife intervened. "What
are you saying, Théophraste?" said she. "Do you wish to teach
Monsieur his business? You have never been to the Conciergerie
before." Then he said in his natural voice, the voice by which
I had known him at first: "That is so, I have never been here
before."</p>

<p>I could not understand then at all, but thought the incident
closed, when he did something stranger still.</p>

<p>We visited the Queen’s Dungeon, Robespierre’s Dungeon, the Chapel
of the Girondists, and that little gate, which is still the same
as when the unfortunate prisoners, called the Septembrians, leaped
over it to be massacred in the court. We were now in the Street
of Paris. There was a little stairway on the left which we did
not descend. It led to the cellars which I did not deem necessary
to show, as it was dark and difficult of access. The gate at the
bottom of this staircase is closed by a grating which is perhaps
a thousand years old—possibly more. The gentleman, whom they called
Adolphe, proceeded with the lady toward the door leading out of
the guard-room, but without saying a word the man with the green
umbrella descended the little staircase. When he was at the grating
he cried out in that strange, weird voice: "Well, where are you
going? It is here." The gentleman and the lady stopped as if petrified.
The voice was terrible, and nothing in the outward appearance
of the man would make you believe that the voice came from him.
In spite of my fear I ran to the head of the stairs. I was thunderstruck.
He ordered me to open the grating, and I don’t know how I obeyed
him. It was as if I had been hypnotized. I obeyed mechanically.
Then when the grating was opened he disappeared in the darkness
of the cellar. Where had he gone? How could he find his way? Those
subterranean passages of the Conciergerie are plunged in frightful
darkness and nobody has been down there for centuries and centuries.</p>

<p>He had already gone too far for me to stop him. He had hypnotized
me. I stayed about a quarter of an hour at the entrance of that
dark hole. His companions were in the same state as I was. It
was impossible to follow him. Then suddenly we heard his voice,
not his first voice, but his second. I was so startled I had to
cling to the grating for support. He cried out: "It is thou, Simon
l’Anvergust." I could not answer. He passed near me, and as he
passed it seemed to me that he put a scrap of paper in his jacket
pocket. He leaped up the steps with one bound and rejoined the
lady and gentleman. He gave them no explanation. As for me, I
ran to open the door of the prison for them. I wanted to get them
outside. When the wicket was open and the man with the green umbrella
was walking out, without apparent reason he said: "We must avoid
the wheel." I don’t know what he meant, as there was no carriage
near.</p>
