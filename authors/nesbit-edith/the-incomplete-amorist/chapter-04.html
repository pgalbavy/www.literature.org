<p>
Six days of sunlight and clear air, of mornings as enchanting as
dreams, of dreams as full of magic as May mornings. Then an
interminable Sunday hot and sultry, with rolling purple clouds and an
evening of thunder and heavy showers. A magenta sunset, a night
working, hidden in its own darkness, its own secret purposes, and a
Monday morning gray beyond belief, with a soft steady rain.</p>

<p>Betty stood for full five minutes looking out at the straight fine
fall, at the white mist spread on the lawn, the blue mist twined round
the trees, listening to the plash of the drops that gathered and fell
from the big wet ivy leaves, to the guggle of the water-spout, the
hiss of smitten gravel.</p>

<p>&quot;He'll never go,&quot; she thought, and her heart sank.</p>

<p>He, shaving, in the chill damp air by his open dimity-draped window,
was saying:</p>

<p>&quot;She'll be there, of course. Women are all perfectly insensible to
weather.&quot;</p>

<p>Two mackintoshed figures met in the circle of pines.</p>

<p>&quot;You have come,&quot; he said. &quot;I never dreamed you would. How cold your
hand is!&quot;</p>

<p>He held it for a moment warmly clasped.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it might stop any minute,&quot; said Betty; &quot;it seemed a pity to
waste a morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said musingly, &quot;it would be a pity to waste a morning. I
would not waste one of these mornings for a kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p>Betty fumbled with her sketching things as a sort of guarantee of good
faith.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's too wet to work,&quot; said she. &quot;I suppose I'd better go home
again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That seems a dull idea - for me,&quot; he said; &quot;it's very selfish, of
course, but I'm rather sad this morning. Won't you stay a little and
cheer me up?&quot;</p>

<p>Betty asked nothing better. But even to her a tete-a-tete in a wood,
with rain pattering and splashing on leaves and path and resonant
mackintoshes, seemed to demand some excuse.</p>

<p>&quot;I should think breakfast and being dry would cheer you up better than
anything,&quot; said she. &quot;And it's very wet here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hang breakfast! But you're right about the wetness. There's a shed in
the field yonder. A harrow and a plough live there; they're sure to be
at home on a day like this. Let's go and ask for their hospitality.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope they'll be nice to us,&quot; laughed Betty; &quot;it's dreadful to go
where you're not wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; he asked, laughing too. &quot;Come, give me your hand
and let's run for it.&quot;</p>

<p>They ran, hand in hand, the wet mackintoshes flapping and slapping
about their knees, and drew up laughing and breathless in the dry
quiet of the shed. Vernon thought of Love and Mr. Lewisham, but it was
not the moment to say so.</p>

<p>&quot;See, they are quite pleased to see us,&quot; said he, &quot;they don't say a
word against our sheltering here. The plough looks a bit glum, but
she'll grow to like us presently. As for harrow, look how he's smiling
welcome at you with all his teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad he can't come forward to welcome us,&quot; said Betty. &quot;His teeth
look very fierce.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He could, of course, only he's enchanted. He used to be able to move
about, but now he's condemned to sit still and only smile till - till
he sees two perfectly happy people. Are you perfectly happy?&quot; he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Betty truly. &quot;Are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No - not quite perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad,&quot; said Betty. &quot;I shouldn't like the harrow to begin to
move while we're here. I'm sure it would bite us.&quot;</p>

<p>He sighed and looked grave. &quot;So you don't want me to be perfectly
happy?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him with her head on one side.</p>

<p>&quot;Not here,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't trust that harrow.&quot;</p>

<p>His eyelids narrowed over his eyes - then relaxed. No, she was merely
playing at enchanted harrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you cold still?&quot; he asked, and reached for her hand. She gave it
frankly.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; she said, and took it away again. &quot;The run warmed me. In
fact - &quot;</p>

<p>She unbuttoned the mackintosh and spread it on the bar of the plough
and sat down. Her white dress lighted up the shadows of the shed.
Outside the rain fell steadily.</p>

<p>&quot;May I sit down too? Can Mrs. Plough find room for two children on her
lap?&quot;</p>

<p>She drew aside the folds of her dress, but even then only a little
space was left. The plough had been carelessly housed and nearly half
of it was where the rain drove in on it. So that they were very close
together.</p>

<p>So close that he had to throw his head back to see clearly how the
rain had made the short hair curl round her forehead and ears, and how
fresh were the tints of face and lips. Also he had to support himself
by an arm stretched out behind her. His arm was not round her, but it
might just as well have been, as far as the look of the thing went. He
thought of the arm of Mr. Lewisham.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you ever have your fortune told?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, never. I've always wanted to, but Father hates gipsies. When I
was a little girl I used to put on my best clothes, and go out into
the lanes and sit about and hope the gipsies would steal me, but they
never did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're a degenerate race, blind to their own interests. But they
haven't a monopoly of chances - fortunately.&quot; His eyes were on her
face.</p>

<p>&quot;I never had my fortune told,&quot; said Betty. &quot;I'd love it, but I think I
should be afraid, all the same. Something might come true.&quot;</p>

<p>Vernon was more surprised than he had ever been in his life at the
sudden involuntary movement in his right arm. It cost him a conscious
effort not to let the arm follow its inclination and fall across her
slender shoulders, while he should say:</p>

<p>&quot;Your fortune is that I love you. Is it good or bad fortune?&quot;</p>

<p>He braced the muscles of his arm, and kept it where it was. That
sudden unreasonable impulse was a mortification, an insult to the man
whose pride it was to believe that his impulses were always planned.</p>

<p>&quot;I can tell fortunes,&quot; he said. &quot;When I was a boy I spent a couple of
months with some gipsies. They taught me lots of things.&quot;</p>

<p>His memory, excellently trained, did not allow itself to dwell for an
instant on his reason for following those gipsies, on the dark-eyed
black-haired girl with the skin like pale amber, who had taught him,
by the flicker of the camp-fire, the lines of head and heart and life,
and other things beside. Oh, but many other things! That was before he
became an artist. He was only an amateur in those days.</p>

<p>&quot;Did they teach you how to tell fortunes - really and truly?&quot; asked
Betty. &quot;We had a fortune-teller's tent at the School Bazaar last year,
and the youngest Smithson girl dressed up in spangles and a red dress
and said she was Zara, the Eastern Mystic Hand-Reader, and Foreteller
of the Future. But she got it all out of Napoleon's Book of Fate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't get my fortune-telling out of anybody's book of anything,&quot; he
said. &quot;I get it out of people's hands, and their faces. Some people's
faces are their fortunes, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know they are,&quot; she said a little sadly, &quot;but everybody's got a
hand and a fortune, whether they've got that sort of fortune-face or
not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the fortunes of the fortune-faced people are the ones one likes
best to tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; she admitted wistfully, &quot;but what's going to happen to
you is just as interesting to <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span>, even if your face isn't
interesting to anybody. Do you always tell fortunes quite truly; I
mean do you follow the real rules? or do you make up pretty fortunes
for the people with the pretty fortune-faces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no need to 'make up.' The pretty fortunes are always there
for the pretty fortune-faces: unless of course the hand contradicts
the face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But can it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't it? There may be a face that all the beautiful things in the
world are promised to: just by being so beautiful itself it draws
beautiful happenings to it. But if the hand contradicts the face, if
the hand is one of those narrow niggardly distrustful hands, one of
the hands that will give nothing and take nothing, a hand without
courage, without generosity - well then one might as well be born
without a fortune-face, for any good it will ever do one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you don't care to tell fortunes for people who haven't fortune
faces?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to tell yours, if you would let me. Shall I?&quot;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, but her hand was withheld.</p>

<p>&quot;I ought to cross your hand with silver, oughtn't I?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's considered correct - but - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't let's neglect any proper precaution,&quot; she said. &quot;I haven't
got any money. Tell it me to-morrow, and I will bring a sixpence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could cross my hand with your watch,&quot; he said, &quot;and I could take
the crossing as an I.O.U. of the sixpence.&quot;</p>

<p>She detached the old watch. He held out his hand and she gravely
traced a cross on it.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said, &quot;all preliminary formalities being complied with, let
the prophet do his work. Give me your hand, pretty lady, and the old
gipsy will tell you your fortune true.&quot;</p>

<p>He held the hand in his, bending back the pink finger-tips with his
thumb, and looked earnestly at its lines. Then he looked in her face,
longer than he had ever permitted himself to look. He looked till her
eyes fell. It was a charming picture. He was tall, strong, well-built
and quite as good-looking as a clever man has any need to be. And she
was as pretty as any oleograph of them all.</p>

<p>It seemed a thousand pities that there should be no witness to such a
well-posed tableau, no audience to such a charming scene. The pity of
it struck Destiny, and Destiny flashed the white of Betty's dress, a
shrill point of light, into an eye a hundred yards away. The eye's
owner, with true rustic finesse, drew back into the wood's shadow,
shaded one eye with a brown rustic hand, looked again, and began a
detour which landed the rustic boots, all silently, behind the shed,
at a spot where a knot-hole served as frame for the little picture.
The rustic eye was fitted to the knot-hole while Vernon holding
Betty's hand gazed in Betty's face, and decided that this was no time
to analyse his sensations.</p>

<p>Neither heard the furtive rustic tread, or noted the gleam of the pale
rustic eye.</p>

<p>The labourer shook his head as he hurried quickly away. He had
daughters of his own, and the Rector had been kind when one of those
daughters had suddenly come home from service, ill, and with no
prospect of another place.</p>

<p>&quot;A-holdin' of hands and a-castin' of sheep's eyes,&quot; said he. &quot;We knows
what that's the beginnings of! Well, well, youth's the season for
silliness, but there's bounds - there's bounds. And all of a mornin' so
early too. Lord above knows what it wouldn't be like of a evenin'.&quot; He
shook his head again, and made haste.</p>

<p>Vernon had forced his eyes to leave the face of Betty.</p>

<p>&quot;Your fortune,&quot; he was saying, &quot;is, curiously enough, just one of
those fortunes I was speaking of. You will have great chances of
happiness, if you have the courage to take them. You will cross the
sea. You've never travelled, have you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, - never further than Torquay; I was at school there, you know; and
London, of course. But I should love it. Isn't it horrid to think that
one might grow quite old and never have been anywhere or done
anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That depends on oneself, doesn't it? Adventures are to the
adventurous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's all very well - girls can't be adventurous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, - it's the Prince who sets out to seek his fortune, isn't it? The
Princess has to sit at home and wait for hers to come to her. It
generally does if she's a real Princess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But half the fun must be the seeking for it,&quot; said Betty.</p>

<p>&quot;You're right,&quot; said he, &quot;it is.&quot;</p>

<p>The labourer had reached the park-gate. His pace had quickened to the
quickening remembrance of his own daughter, sitting at home silent and
sullen.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really see it in my hand?&quot; asked Betty, - &quot;about my crossing
the sea, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's there; but it depends on yourself, like everything else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did ask my step-father to let me go,&quot; she said, &quot;after that first
day, you know, when you said I ought to study in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he wouldn't, of course?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; he said Paris was a wicked place. It isn't really, is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Every place is wicked,&quot; said he, &quot;and every place is good. It's all
as one takes things.&quot;</p>

<p>The Rectory gate clicked sharply as it swung to behind the labourer.
The Rectory gravel scrunched beneath the labourer's boots.</p>

<p>Yes, the Master was up; he could be seen.</p>

<p>The heavy boots were being rubbed against the birch broom that, rooted
at Kentish back doors, stands to receive on its purple twigs the
scrapings of Kentish clay from rustic feet.</p>

<p>&quot;You have the artistic lines very strongly marked,&quot; Vernon was saying.
&quot;One, two, three - yes, painting - music perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am very fond of music,&quot; said Betty, thinking of the hour's daily
struggle with the Mikado and the Moonlight Sonata. &quot;But three arts.
What could the third one be?&quot; Her thoughts played for an instant with
unheard-of triumphs achieved behind footlights - rapturous applause,
showers of bouquets.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever it is, you've enormous talent for it,&quot; he said; &quot;you'll find
out what it is in good time. Perhaps it'll be something much more
important than the other two put together, and perhaps you've got even
more talent for it than you have for others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there isn't any other talent that I can think of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can think of a few. There's the stage, - but it's not that, I fancy,
or not exactly that. There's literature - confess now, don't you write
poetry sometimes when you're all alone at night? Then there's the art
of being amusing, and the art of being - of being liked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I be successful in any of the arts?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In one, certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Betty, &quot;if I could only go to Paris!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not always necessary to go to Paris for success in one's art,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p>&quot;But I want to go. I'm sure I could do better there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't you satisfied with your present Master?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; - It was a cry of genuine distress, of heartfelt disclaim. &quot;You
<span style="text-decoration: underline">know</span> I didn't mean that! But you won't always be here, and when
you've gone - why then - &quot;</p>

<p>Again he had to control the involuntary movement of his left arm.</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm not going for months yet. Don't let us cross a bridge till we
come to it. Your head-line promises all sorts of wonderful things. And
your heart-line - &quot; he turned her hand more fully to the light.</p>

<p>In the Rector's study the labourer was speaking, standing shufflingly
on the margin of the Turkey carpet. The Rector listened, his hand on
an open folio where fat infants peered through the ornamental
initials.</p>

<p>&quot;And so I come straight up to you, Sir, me being a father and you the
same, Sir, for all the difference betwixt our ways in life. Says I to
myself, says I, and bitter hard I feels it too, I says: 'George,' says
I, 'you've got a daughter as begun that way, not a doubt of
it - holdin' of hands and sittin' close alongside, and you know what's
come to her!'&quot;</p>

<p>The Rector shivered at the implication.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I says, says I: 'Like as not the Rector won't thank you for
interferin'. Least said soonest mended,' says I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very much obliged to you,&quot; said the Rector difficultly, and his
hand shook on Ambrosius's yellow page.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, Sir,&quot; the man's tone held all that deferent apology that
truth telling demands, &quot;gells is gells, be they never so up in the
world, all the world over, bless their hearts; and young men is young
men, d - n them, asking your pardon, Sir, I'm sure, but the word
slipped out. And I shouldn't ha' been easy if anything had have gone
wrong with Miss, God bless her, all along of the want of a word in
season. Asking your pardon, Sir, but even young ladies is flesh and
blood, when it comes to the point. Ain't they now?&quot; he ended
appealingly.</p>

<p>The Rector spoke with an obvious effort, got his hand off the page and
closed the folio.</p>

<p>&quot;You've done quite right, George,&quot; he said, &quot;and I'm greatly obliged
to you. Only I do ask you to keep this to yourself. You wouldn't have
liked it if people had heard a thing like that about your Ruby
before - I mean when she was at home.&quot;</p>

<p>He replaced the two folios on the shelf.</p>

<p>&quot;Not me, Sir,&quot; George answered. &quot;I'm mum, I do assure you, Sir. And if
I might make so bold, you just pop on your hat and step acrost
directly minute. There's that little hole back of the shed what I told
you of. You ain't only got to pop your reverend eye to that there, and
you'll see for yourself as I ain't give tongue for no dragged scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, George,&quot; said the Rector, &quot;I will. Good morning. God bless
you.&quot;</p>

<p>The formula came glibly, but it was from the lips only that it came.</p>

<p>Lizzie - his white innocent Lily-girl! In a shed - a man, a stranger,
holding her hand, his arm around her, his eyes - his lips perhaps,
daring - </p>

<p>The Rector was half way down his garden drive.</p>

<p>&quot;Your heart-line,&quot; Vernon was saying, &quot;it's a little difficult. You
will be deeply beloved.&quot;</p>

<p>To have one's fortune told is disquieting. To keep silence during the
telling deepens the disquiet curiously. It seemed good to Betty to
laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor,&quot; she said, &quot;which am I going to
marry, kind gipsy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe the gipsies who say they can see marriage in a hand,&quot;
he answered gravely, and Betty feared he had thought her flippant, or
even vulgar; &quot;what one sees are not the shadows of coming conventions.
One sees the great emotional events, the things that change and mould
and develop character. Yes, you will be greatly beloved, and you will
love deeply.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not to be happy in my affairs of the heart then.&quot; Still a careful
flippancy seemed best to Betty.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I say so? Do you really think that there are no happy love
affairs but those that end in a wedding breakfast and bridesmaids,
with a Bazaar show of hideous silver and still more hideous crockery,
and all one's relations assembled to dissect one's most sacred
secrets?&quot;</p>

<p>Betty had thought so, but it seemed coarse to own it.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you imagine,&quot; he went on dreamily, &quot;a love affair so perfect
that it could not but lose its finest fragrance if the world were
called to watch the plucking of love's flower? Can't you imagine a
love so great, so deep, so tender, so absolutely possessing the whole
life of the lover that he would almost grudge any manifestation of it?
Because such a manifestation must necessarily be a repetition of some
of the ways in which unworthy loves have been manifested, by less
happy lovers? I can seem to see that one might love the one love of a
life-time, and be content to hold the treasure in one's heart, a
treasure such as no other man ever had, and grudge even a word or a
look that might make it less the single perfect rose of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Betty to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm talking like a book,&quot; he said, and laughed. &quot;I always get
dreamy and absurd when I tell fortunes. Anyway, as I said before, you
will be greatly beloved. Indeed, unless your hand is very untruthful,
which I'm sure it never could be, you are beloved now, far more than
you can possibly guess.&quot;</p>

<p>Betty caught at her flippancy but it evaded her, and all she found to
say was, &quot;Oh,&quot; and her eyes fell.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Vernon still held her hand, but he was no longer
looking at it.</p>

<p>A black figure darkened the daylight.</p>

<p>The two on the plough started up - started apart. Nothing more was
wanted to convince the Rector of all that he least wished to believe.</p>

<p>&quot;Go home, Lizzie,&quot; he said, &quot;go to your room,&quot; and to her his face
looked the face of a fiend. It is hard to control the muscles under a
sudden emotion compounded of sorrow, sympathy and an immeasurable
pity. &quot;Go to your room and stay there till I send for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Betty went, like a beaten dog.</p>

<p>The Rector turned to the young man.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Sir,&quot; he said.</p>
