<p>EXCEPT for the work that his father made him do now and then, there was
only one thing that bothered Johnnie Green in making his collection of
butterflies. The weather was not so good as it might have been. He soon
found that there was no use hunting for butterflies except in the
sunshine. So when a three days' rain came, Johnnie began to wish he
had started a different sort of collection.
</p>
<p>But the weather cleared at last. And the sun came out so bright that
Johnnie fairly pulled old Ebenezer away from the watering-trough and
hustled him back to his stall; for he was in a hurry to get to the
flower garden with his butterfly net. As for the chickens, they had
very little food that day.
</p><p>Once in the garden, Johnnie Green found more butterflies than he had
ever noticed before. But as soon as he began chasing them, they flew
away to the meadow. That is, all but Betsy Butterfly. She said she was
sure Johnnie Green wouldn't annoy her.
</p><p>And that was where she was wrong. The moment he caught sight of her,
with her mottled red-and-brown wings with the violet tips, Johnnie
cried: "There's a beauty!"
</p><p>But Betsy Butterfly was so used to such remarks that she paid little
heed to him. Even when he crept nearer and nearer to her, with old dog
Spot at his heels, she did not take fright.
</p><p>With her tongue deep in a fragrant blossom she was enjoying its
delicious sweetness when Johnnie Green, bearing his net aloft, sprang
at her.
</p><p>When Johnnie jumped, Betsy Butterfly started up in alarm. She had really
waited until it was too late. And if something unexpected hadn't
happened to Johnnie Green, Betsy would surely have had a place in his
collection.
</p><p>But luckily for her, Johnnie met with a fall. He may have tripped on a
vine. Or his foot may have slipped on the wet ground. Anyhow, he fell
sprawling among the flowers, dropping his precious net as he stretched
out his hands to save himself.
</p><p>Johnnie's fall gave Betsy Butterfly her only chance. Coiling her long
tongue out of her way, she quickly made her escape.
</p><p>So Johnnie Green lost her. But she was not all that he lost. A strange
accident happened just as he fell, for old dog Spot leaped forward at
the same time. And, much to his surprise, Spot found his head inside the
butterfly net. The long broomstick handle thumped him sharply on his
back. And the silly fellow took fright at once.
</p><p>With yelps of terror he scurried out of the flower garden. And Johnnie
picked himself up just in time to see Spot tearing across the meadow
toward the woods.
</p><p>"Spot! Spot! Come back!" Johnnie Green shouted. But old Spot paid no
attention to his young master. Perhaps he was too scared to hear him.
</p><p>Spot wanted to get rid of that net that covered his head. And he knew of
no better place to go than the woods where he hoped to be able to free
himself from his odd muzzle by rubbing against a tree or nosing among
some bushes.
</p><p>Johnnie ran a little way after him. But when he saw Spot duck into the
woods he turned back sadly towards the house. For all he knew, old Spot
might run a mile further before he stopped.
</p><p>Johnnie would have to make a new net if he wanted to catch any more
butterflies for his collection.
</p><p>And the trouble was, he had no more mosquito netting.
</p><p>A good many of the field people saw old Spot as he dashed off with the
butterfly net over his head. And they enjoyed a hearty laugh at the
strange sight.
</p><p>As for Betsy Butterfly, she had learned to watch out for Johnnie Green.
And she knew that another time he would have to be twice as spry as he
had shown himself, if he expected to capture her.
</p><p>Old Spot didn't come home till afternoon. When he appeared at last he
looked very sheepish. He hoped no one had noticed his fright. And he
wouldn't go near the flower garden again for a whole week.
