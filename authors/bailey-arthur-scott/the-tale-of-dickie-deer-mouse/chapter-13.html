<p>"I'm glad to see you," Solomon Owl told his cousin Simon Screecher,
while Dickie Deer Mouse stood stock still on the ground beneath the tree
where the two cousins were sitting. "I'm glad to see you. And I hope
you're enjoying good health."
</p>
<p>"I'm well enough," Simon Screecher grunted.
</p><p>"Do you find plenty to eat nowadays?" Solomon asked him.
</p><p>Simon Screecher admitted that he was not starving.
</p><p>"Ah!" Solomon exclaimed. "Then you can have no objection to sharing a
specially nice tidbit with your own cousin."
</p><p>Dickie Deer Mouse shivered. But he did not dare move, with one of Simon
Screecher's great, glassy eyes staring straight at him. And there was
something else that did not help to put him at his ease: Solomon Owl
seemed to be watching him likewise!
</p><p>"Haven't you dined to-night?" Simon Screecher inquired in a testy tone.
</p><p>"Yes!" Solomon admitted. "But I haven't had my dessert yet.... What are
you looking at so closely, Cousin Simon, down there on the ground?"
</p><p>An angry light came into Simon Screecher's eyes.
</p><p>"Can't I look where I please?" he snapped.
</p><p>And he changed his seat again, so that he might get a better view of
Dickie and Solomon at the same time.
</p><p>Solomon Owl promptly moved to another limb behind Simon, and slightly
higher.
</p><p>And Dickie Deer Mouse took heart when Simon Screecher began to make a
queer sound by opening his beak and shutting it with a snap, as if he
would like to nip somebody.
</p><p>Dickie knew that Simon Screecher was in a terrible rage. And unless his
threatening actions scared Solomon Owl away, Dickie thought there was
likely to be a cousinly fight.
</p><p>He was pleased to notice that Solomon Owl showed no sign of dismay.
There was really no reason why he should. He was much bigger than his
peppery cousin. And he looked at Simon in a calm and unruffled fashion
that seemed to make that quarrelsome fellow angrier than ever.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Solomon Owl asked Simon Screecher. "If you had any
teeth I'd think they were chattering.... Are you having a chill?"
</p><p>Simon made no answer.
</p><p>"Maybe you're afraid of something," Solomon Owl suggested. "Can it be
that young Deer Mouse down there on the ground?" And he laughed loudly
at what <u>he</u> thought was a joke.
</p><p>"That's <u>my</u> Deer Mouse!" Simon Screecher squalled, suddenly finding his
voice. "I saw him first. And he's my prize."
</p><p>"He looks to me like the one I lost a few nights ago," Solomon Owl
announced solemnly. "In that case, of course I saw him first. So you'd
better fly home to your old apple tree in the orchard."
</p><p>"I'll do nothing of the sort!" Simon Screecher declared; and his voice
rose to a shrill quaver.
</p><p>Turning swiftly, he flew straight at his cousin. And then how the
feathers did fly!
</p><p>Dickie Deer Mouse wanted to stay right there, for he hated to miss any
of the fun. But he remembered that he was a "tidbit"; so he scampered
away through the woods. And though he never knew how the fight ended, he
was sure of one thing: There was no prize for the winner.
