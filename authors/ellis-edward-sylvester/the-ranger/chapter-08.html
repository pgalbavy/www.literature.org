<p>When Leland left the boat, he wandered forward for a considerable
distance, not noticing the direction in which he was going, only
intent upon securing game of some sort or other. Still, he exercised
considerable caution in his movements, and determined not to risk
a shot unless he was certain of his success. Birds and quadrupeds
were plenty, and he did not entertain any doubts of his ability
to secure all that he wished. He permitted several good shots
to pass, for the reason that he did not wish to fire until the
hour was up. By this means he unconsciously increased the distance
between himself and Leslie, until it occurred to him that the
hour had nearly expired. A few minutes after, having a good opportunity,
he improved it, and, securing his prize, turned to retrace his
steps.</p>

<p>Then it flashed upon him, for the first time, that he was lost.
As we said, he had failed to notice the direction, and had no
idea of the course to pursue in order to reach the river. The
only means left was to proceed by guess; contrary to what might
be expected, he took the right course. His anxiety caused him
to be somewhat heedless; and after proceeding a short distance,
he again discharged his rifle. Then hearing the report of Leslie's
rifle but a short distance away, he set joyously forward, confident
of soon coming up to him. He had not gone far when he heard a
suppressed, significant whistle. Hardly conscious of its meaning,
he paused and listened. It was repeated, and becoming suspicious,
he sprung behind a tree. While listening, the subdued voice of
Kent reached him:</p>

<p>"Make for the river, George; the imps are on your trail."</p>

<p>He turned to obey this injunction, but had not taken a dozen
steps when a rifle flamed from some concealment, and a twinge
in his side told him that he was wounded. At the same instant
several savages sprung toward him, setting up their demoniac howls.
The pain of his wound maddened him, and, regardless of consequences,
he raised his rifle and shot the foremost through the breast,
when scarcely the length of his gun from him.</p>

<p>This act, though rash, and one which he would not have done in
his cooler moments, was the means eventually of saving his life.
The intention of the savages was to kill him on the spot; but
the death of one of their number increased their fury and thirst
for vengeance, and the chief or leader deterred the others from
further violence, determined that his death should be at the stake.</p>

<p>"You shoot Indian, eh?" said one, through his closed teeth, brandishing
his knife at the same time in the face of the young man.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "You shoot Indian, eh?" said one, brandishing
his knife at the same time.]</p>

<p>He made no reply; but weakened by the loss of blood, sunk fainting
to the ground. He was jerked to his feet, and although barely
able to stand, was forced forward, and compelled to keep pace
with the others.</p>

<p>The Indians who had thus captured Leland were the same band who
had pursued him and Kent. The latter had taken a circuitous course,
and, after placing a considerable distance between himself and
his enemies, took the back track and reached the gorge where Leslie
had fallen, hoping to find him there; but being disappointed,
followed his trail to the river where he saw that he had embarked
in the boat.</p>

<p>Kent knew that his own trail would be followed. In order to mislead
the savages, he took to the water and swam about a half-mile down-stream
before he landed upon the opposite side. But it seemed that fate
was against him. The savages in pursuing him had separated somewhat.
Kent's ruse one of them accidentally discovered, and apprised
his companions. They collected and immediately took the right
trail. The first intimation the ranger had of his danger was the
whistling of a bullet a few inches from his head, as he was nearing
the bank; and when his feet rested upon land, his unwearied and
tenacious enemies were in the river, boldly crossing toward him.</p>

<p>When the Indians reached the bank, Kent was already at a great
distance, yet they continued their pursuit, and had gone some
distance, when the first report of Leland's rifle reached their
ears. This they mistook for Kent's, and abandoning the trail,
made directly toward it. The second discharge of the young man's
gun occurred when he was but a short distance from them. Kent
endeavored to warn him of his danger, but as we have seen, it
was too late. He himself was discovered and hotly pursued to the
boat, where he barely succeeded in making his escape.</p>

<p>Leland's captors took up their march toward the Ohio. Here, although
their captive was suffering intense agony, they forced him into
the water, and compelled him to swim across. Every stroke he thought
would be his last, yet he reached the shore in safety. The band
set forward at once. There were six savages, upon two of whom
the duty of attending Leland devolved. Yet he required little
watching or attention. The thought of escape was far from his
mind; he was in a sad situation to rebel or offer resistance.
Both hands were firmly secured behind him, and his strength was
taxed to the utmost to keep up with his captors.</p>

<p>In the course of a couple of hours they came upon two of their
companions, seated around and amusing themselves with a negro.
Each appeared to enjoy himself prodigiously at the expense of
the poor African, who was boiling over with furious rage.</p>

<p>"Get out, niggers!" he shouted, "my head's split wide open now,
sure!"</p>

<p>Here one of the savages amused himself by letting the end of
a weighty stick fall upon the head of the negro. The luxuriant
wool caused it to re-bound again, to the infinite delight of the
tormentors, who smiled horribly at it.</p>

<p>Leland recognized Zeb as he came up. It gave him a sort of pleasure,
or rather served to lighten his pain, to know that they were to
be companions in captivity. He could probably obtain information
of Rosalind, while the conversation of the slave might assist
to keep off the gloom which was settling over him.</p>

<p>"Gorra, ef dar ain't massa Leland," exclaimed the negro, turning
toward the approaching Indians. "High! whar'd <em>you</em> come
from, George? What did you let 'em cotch <em>you</em> fur?"</p>

<p>"Because I could not prevent it," returned he, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Well, now, if't had been dis pusson, you see, dey'd 've had
some trouble."</p>

<p>"How is it that you are here, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, dat question requires considerable explanation. I know'd
as how dey's agoin' to git <em>you</em>, and so I just come along
to help you out de scrape."</p>

<p>Here the conversation ceased for the present. Leland had stretched
himself upon the ground, and the pain of his wound increased.
A savage noticing this, prepared a sort of poultice of pounded
leaves and herbs, and placed it upon his side. Had this been done
with a view to alleviate his suffering and not to preserve him
for a great and awful torture, as it really was, Leland might
have felt disposed to thank him for it.</p>

<p>It had now begun to grow dark. A fire was started, and in a short
time a large quantity of meat was roasted. A piece of this was
offered to Leland, but, though a short time before he had felt
keenly the pangs of hunger, the sight of food now filled him with
loathing.</p>

<p>"S'posen you offer dis pusson a few pounds, just to see if he'll
take it," suggested Zeb, gazing wistfully toward the Indian who
held it.</p>

<p>Several pieces were given him, all of which he devoured voraciously
and demanded more. An Indian approached him, and holding a piece
within a few inches of his mouth, jerked it away as he was about
to seize it. This was repeated several times, until Zeb, losing
all patience, became morose and sullen and refused to snap at
it. The savage seemed disposed to humor him and held it still
closer. Zeb, watching his opportunity, made a quick motion, and
nearly severed the finger of his tormentor's hand, between his
teeth. The savage dropped the meat with a howl, and furiously
shaking his wounded member, fairly danced with pain. He would
have undoubtedly killed the negro had not his companions prevented.
They enjoyed the sport and encouraged Zeb, who devoured his food
for some time in dignified silence.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't mind tryin' some more. S'posen you hold out yer other
hand!"</p>

<p>No one noticed this remark, and the negro was obliged to rest
satisfied with what he had obtained.</p>

<p>As night came on, the savages stretched themselves upon the earth
and left the prisoners to themselves. Each was securely fastened.
Leland was within a few feet of Zeb, yet he concluded to wait
until all were asleep before he ventured to hold converse with
him.</p>

<p>At length when the night had considerably advanced, and the heavy
breathing of the savages showed that slumber had at last settled
upon them, George turned his head so that he faced the negro,
and abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"Zeb, what do you know of my sister?"</p>

<p>"Noffin'!" returned the negro, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Were you not taken off together?"</p>

<p>"At fust we was; but dey took her one way and me anoder." He
then proceeded to narrate all the circumstances which had occurred
to him, since the burning of the house, in his own characteristic
way.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will soon have your last adventure," said Leland.</p>

<p>"Gorra! does you s'pose dat dey'd dare to shake a stick at me
when I's mad."</p>

<p>"I think they were engaged at that when I came up."</p>

<p>"Well, dat you see is a mistake."</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything hinted of the manner in which they intend
to dispose of you?"</p>

<p>"Not much, but I consates dat I knows. Dey'll just make me dar
chief, if I'll stay wid 'em, and I's bout 'cluded dat I would,
just so dat I can pay 'em for dis trick."</p>

<p>"Have they made the proposition yet?" asked George, feeling a
strange impulse to amuse himself.</p>

<p>"Well, 'bout as good. Dey axed me not to hurt 'em, and said somefin'
'bout tying somebody to a tree and roastin' 'em. S'pose dey's
'fraid I'll do it to all ob 'em one dese days, if dey isn't careful."</p>

<p>"Why do they misuse you, if they intend to elevate you?"</p>

<p>"Well, dat's hard to tell. They've gone and went and cut all
my curls off."</p>

<p>"Never mind such things," said Leland, again feeling depressed.
"In all probability neither you nor I will see many more days.
Unless we are rescued pretty soon, we shall be past all human
help. I advise you, Zeb, to let serious thoughts enter your mind.
Think of the world which you are soon to enter, and try and make
some preparation for it."</p>

<p>The negro gazed wonderingly at Leland, then turned his head without
speaking. The words probably had some effect upon him, for he
made no further observations. His silence seemed occasioned by
the doom pending over him.</p>

<p>That night was one never to be forgotten by Leland. The pain
of his wound, and the still greater pain of his thoughts, prevented
a moment's sleep. Hour after hour he gazed into the smoldering
embers before him, buried in deep meditation, and conjuring up
fantastic figures in the glowing coals. Then he watched the few
stars which were twinkling through the branches overhead, and
the sighing of the solemn night-wind made music that chorded with
the feelings of his soul.</p>

<p>Far in the small hours of the night, he lay still awake, sending
up his prayer to the only eye that saw him, and to the only one
that could assist him.</p>
