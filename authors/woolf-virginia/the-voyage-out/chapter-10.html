<p>Among the promises which Mrs. Ambrose had made her niece should
she stay was a room cut off from the rest of the house, large,
private&mdash;a room in which she could play, read, think, defy the
world, a fortress as well as a sanctuary. Rooms, she knew, became
more like worlds than rooms at the age of twenty-four. Her judgment
was correct, and when she shut the door Rachel entered an enchanted
place, where the poets sang and things fell into their right proportions.
Some days after the vision of the hotel by night she was sitting
alone, sunk in an arm-chair, reading a brightly-covered red volume
lettered on the back <em>Works</em> <em>of</em> <em>Henrik</em>
<em>Ibsen</em>. Music was open on the piano, and books of music
rose in two jagged pillars on the floor; but for the moment music
was deserted.</p>

<p>Far from looking bored or absent-minded, her eyes were concentrated
almost sternly upon the page, and from her breathing, which was
slow but repressed, it could be seen that her whole body was constrained
by the working of her mind. At last she shut the book sharply,
lay back, and drew a deep breath, expressive of the wonder which
always marks the transition from the imaginary world to the real
world.</p>

<p>"What I want to know," she said aloud, "is this: What is the
truth? What's the truth of it all?" She was speaking partly as
herself, and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read.
The landscape outside, because she had seen nothing but print
for the space of two hours, now appeared amazingly solid and clear,
but although there were men on the hill washing the trunks of
olive trees with a white liquid, for the moment she herself was
the most vivid thing in it&mdash;an heroic statue in the middle of
the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen's plays always left
her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly
to Helen's amusement; and then it would be Meredith's turn and
she became Diana of the Crossways. But Helen was aware that it
was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place
in the human being. When Rachel became tired of the rigidity of
her pose on the back of the chair, she turned round, slid comfortably
down into it, and gazed out over the furniture through the window
opposite which opened on the garden. (Her mind wandered away from
Nora, but she went on thinking of things that the book suggested
to her, of women and life.)</p>

<p>During the three months she had been here she had made up considerably,
as Helen meant she should, for time spent in interminable walks
round sheltered gardens, and the household gossip of her aunts.
But Mrs. Ambrose would have been the first to disclaim any influence,
or indeed any belief that to influence was within her power. She
saw her less shy, and less serious, which was all to the good,
and the violent leaps and the interminable mazes which had led
to that result were usually not even guessed at by her. Talk was
the medicine she trusted to, talk about everything, talk that
was free, unguarded, and as candid as a habit of talking with
men made natural in her own case. Nor did she encourage those
habits of unselfishness and amiability founded upon insincerity
which are put at so high a value in mixed households of men and
women. She desired that Rachel should think, and for this reason
offered books and discouraged too entire a dependence upon Bach
and Beethoven and Wagner. But when Mrs. Ambrose would have suggested
Defoe, Maupassant, or some spacious chronicle of family life,
Rachel chose modern books, books in shiny yellow covers, books
with a great deal of gilding on the back, which were tokens in
her aunt's eyes of harsh wrangling and disputes about facts which
had no such importance as the moderns claimed for them. But she
did not interfere. Rachel read what she chose, reading with the
curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar,
and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately
of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables or chairs.
In this way she came to conclusions, which had to be remodelled
according to the adventures of the day, and were indeed recast
as liberally as any one could desire, leaving always a small grain
of belief behind them.</p>

<p>Ibsen was succeeded by a novel such as Mrs. Ambrose detested,
whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman's downfall
upon the right shoulders; a purpose which was achieved, if the
reader's discomfort were any proof of it. She threw the book down,
looked out of the window, turned away from the window, and relapsed
into an arm-chair.</p>

<p>The morning was hot, and the exercise of reading left her mind
contracting and expanding like the main-spring of a clock, and
the small noises of midday, which one can ascribe to no definite
cause, in a regular rhythm. It was all very real, very big, very
impersonal, and after a moment or two she began to raise her first
finger and to let it fall on the arm of her chair so as to bring
back to herself some consciousness of her own existence. She was
next overcome by the unspeakable queerness of the fact that she
should be sitting in an arm-chair, in the morning, in the middle
of the world. Who were the people moving in the house&mdash;moving
things from one place to another? And life, what was that? It
was only a light passing over the surface and vanishing, as in
time she would vanish, though the furniture in the room would
remain. Her dissolution became so complete that she could not
raise her finger any more, and sat perfectly still, listening
and looking always at the same spot. It became stranger and stranger.
She was overcome with awe that things should exist at all. . .
. She forgot that she had any fingers to raise. . . . The things
that existed were so immense and so desolate. . . . She continued
to be conscious of these vast masses of substance for a long stretch
of time, the clock still ticking in the midst of the universal
silence.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said mechanically, for a string in her brain seemed
to be pulled by a persistent knocking at the door. With great
slowness the door opened and a tall human being came towards her,
holding out her arm and saying:</p>

<p>"What am I to say to this?"</p>

<p>The utter absurdity of a woman coming into a room with a piece
of paper in her hand amazed Rachel.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to answer, or who Terence Hewet is," Helen
continued, in the toneless voice of a ghost. She put a paper before
Rachel on which were written the incredible words:</p>

<p><em>DEAR MRS. AMBROSE &</em>mdash;I am getting up a picnic for
next Friday, when we propose to start at eleven-thirty if the
weather is fine, and to make the ascent of Monte Rosa. It will
take some time, but the view should be magnificent. It would give
me great pleasure if you and Miss Vinrace would consent to be
of the party.&mdash;</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, <em>TERENCE HEWET</em></p>

<p>Rachel read the words aloud to make herself believe in them.
For the same reason she put her hand on Helen's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Books&mdash;books&mdash;books," said Helen, in her absent-minded way.
"More new books &mdash;I wonder what you find in them. . . ."</p>

<p>For the second time Rachel read the letter, but to herself. This
time, instead of seeming vague as ghosts, each word was astonishingly
prominent; they came out as the tops of mountains come through
a mist. <em>Friday</em>&mdash;<em>eleven-thirty</em>&mdash;<em>Miss</em>
<em>Vinrace</em>. The blood began to run in her veins; she felt
her eyes brighten.</p>

<p>"We must go," she said, rather surprising Helen by her decision.
"We must certainly go"&mdash;such was the relief of finding that things
still happened, and indeed they appeared the brighter for the
mist surrounding them.</p>

<p>"Monte Rosa&mdash;that's the mountain over there, isn't it?" said
Helen; "but Hewet&mdash;who's he? One of the young men Ridley met,
I suppose. Shall I say yes, then? It may be dreadfully dull."</p>

<p>She took the letter back and went, for the messenger was waiting
for her answer.</p>

<p>The party which had been suggested a few nights ago in Mr. Hirst's
bedroom had taken shape and was the source of great satisfaction
to Mr. Hewet, who had seldom used his practical abilities, and
was pleased to find them equal to the strain. His invitations
had been universally accepted, which was the more encouraging
as they had been issued against Hirst's advice to people who were
very dull, not at all suited to each other, and sure not to come.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," he said, as he twirled and untwirled a note signed
Helen Ambrose, "the gifts needed to make a great commander have
been absurdly overrated. About half the intellectual effort which
is needed to review a book of modern poetry has enabled me to
get together seven or eight people, of opposite sexes, at the
same spot at the same hour on the same day. What else is generalship,
Hirst? What more did Wellington do on the field of Waterloo? It's
like counting the number of pebbles of a path, tedious but not
difficult."</p>

<p>He was sitting in his bedroom, one leg over the arm of the chair,
and Hirst was writing a letter opposite. Hirst was quick to point
out that all the difficulties remained.</p>

<p>"For instance, here are two women you've never seen. Suppose
one of them suffers from mountain-sickness, as my sister does,
and the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, the women are for you," Hewet interrupted. "I asked them
solely for your benefit. What you want, Hirst, you know, is the
society of young women of your own age. You don't know how to
get on with women, which is a great defect, considering that half
the world consists of women."</p>

<p>Hirst groaned that he was quite aware of that.</p>

<p>But Hewet's complacency was a little chilled as he walked with
Hirst to the place where a general meeting had been appointed.
He wondered why on earth he had asked these people, and what one
really expected to get from bunching human beings up together.</p>

<p>"Cows," he reflected, "draw together in a field; ships in a calm;
and we're just the same when we've nothing else to do. But why
do we do it?&mdash;is it to prevent ourselves from seeing to the bottom
of things" (he stopped by a stream and began stirring it with
his walking-stick and clouding the water with mud), "making cities
and mountains and whole universes out of nothing, or do we really
love each other, or do we, on the other hand, live in a state
of perpetual uncertainty, knowing nothing, leaping from moment
to moment as from world to world?&mdash;which is, on the whole, the
view <em>I</em> incline to."</p>

<p>He jumped over the stream; Hirst went round and joined him, remarking
that he had long ceased to look for the reason of any human action.</p>

<p>Half a mile further, they came to a group of plane trees and
the salmon-pink farmhouse standing by the stream which had been
chosen as meeting-place. It was a shady spot, lying conveniently
just where the hill sprung out from the flat. Between the thin
stems of the plane trees the young men could see little knots
of donkeys pasturing, and a tall woman rubbing the nose of one
of them, while another woman was kneeling by the stream lapping
water out of her palms.</p>

<p>As they entered the shady place, Helen looked up and then held
out her hand.</p>

<p>"I must introduce myself," she said. "I am Mrs. Ambrose."</p>

<p>Having shaken hands, she said, "That's my niece."</p>

<p>Rachel approached awkwardly. She held out her hand, but withdrew
it. "It's all wet," she said.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they spoken, when the first carriage drew up.</p>

<p>The donkeys were quickly jerked into attention, and the second
carriage arrived. By degrees the grove filled with people&mdash;the
Elliots, the Thornburys, Mr. Venning and Susan, Miss Allan, Evelyn
Murgatroyd, and Mr. Perrott. Mr. Hirst acted the part of hoarse
energetic sheep-dog. By means of a few words of caustic Latin
he had the animals marshalled, and by inclining a sharp shoulder
he lifted the ladies. "What Hewet fails to understand," he remarked,
"is that we must break the back of the ascent before midday."
He was assisting a young lady, by name Evelyn Murgatroyd, as he
spoke. She rose light as a bubble to her seat. With a feather
drooping from a broad-brimmed hat, in white from top to toe, she
looked like a gallant lady of the time of Charles the First leading
royalist troops into action.</p>

<p>"Ride with me," she commanded; and, as soon as Hirst had swung
himself across a mule, the two started, leading the cavalcade.</p>

<p>"You're not to call me Miss Murgatroyd. I hate it," she said.
"My name's Evelyn. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"St. John," he said.</p>

<p>"I like that," said Evelyn. "And what's your friend's name?"</p>

<p>"His initials being R. S. T., we call him Monk," said Hirst.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're all too clever," she said. "Which way? Pick me a
branch. Let's canter."</p>

<p>She gave her donkey a sharp cut with a switch and started forward.
The full and romantic career of Evelyn Murgatroyd is best hit
off by her own words, "Call me Evelyn and I'll call you St. John."
She said that on very slight provocation&mdash;her surname was enough&mdash;but
although a great many young men had answered her already with
considerable spirit she went on saying it and making choice of
none. But her donkey stumbled to a jog-trot, and she had to ride
in advance alone, for the path when it began to ascend one of
the spines of the hill became narrow and scattered with stones.
The cavalcade wound on like a jointed caterpillar, tufted with
the white parasols of the ladies, and the panama hats of the gentlemen.
At one point where the ground rose sharply, Evelyn M. jumped off,
threw her reins to the native boy, and adjured St. John Hirst
to dismount too. Their example was followed by those who felt
the need of stretching.</p>

<p>"I don't see any need to get off," said Miss Allan to Mrs. Elliot
just behind her, "considering the difficulty I had getting on."</p>

<p>"These little donkeys stand anything, <em>n'est-ce</em> <em>pas</em>?"
Mrs. Elliot addressed the guide, who obligingly bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Flowers," said Helen, stooping to pick the lovely little bright
flowers which grew separately here and there. "You pinch their
leaves and then they smell," she said, laying one on Miss Allan's
knee.</p>

<p>"Haven't we met before?" asked Miss Allan, looking at her.</p>

<p>"I was taking it for granted," Helen laughed, for in the confusion
of meeting they had not been introduced.</p>

<p>"How sensible!" chirped Mrs. Elliot. "That's just what one would
always like&mdash;only unfortunately it's not possible." "Not possible?"
said Helen. "Everything's possible. Who knows what mayn't happen
before night-fall?" she continued, mocking the poor lady's timidity,
who depended implicitly upon one thing following another that
the mere glimpse of a world where dinner could be disregarded,
or the table moved one inch from its accustomed place, filled
her with fears for her own stability.</p>

<p>Higher and higher they went, becoming separated from the world.
The world, when they turned to look back, flattened itself out,
and was marked with squares of thin green and grey.</p>

<p>"Towns are very small," Rachel remarked, obscuring the whole
of Santa Marina and its suburbs with one hand. The sea filled
in all the angles of the coast smoothly, breaking in a white frill,
and here and there ships were set firmly in the blue. The sea
was stained with purple and green blots, and there was a glittering
line upon the rim where it met the sky. The air was very clear
and silent save for the sharp noise of grasshoppers and the hum
of bees, which sounded loud in the ear as they shot past and vanished.
The party halted and sat for a time in a quarry on the hillside.</p>

<p>"Amazingly clear," exclaimed St. John, identifying one cleft
in the land after another.</p>

<p>Evelyn M. sat beside him, propping her chin on her hand. She
surveyed the view with a certain look of triumph.</p>

<p>"D'you think Garibaldi was ever up here?" she asked Mr. Hirst.
Oh, if she had been his bride! If, instead of a picnic party,
this was a party of patriots, and she, red-shirted like the rest,
had lain among grim men, flat on the turf, aiming her gun at the
white turrets beneath them, screening her eyes to pierce through
the smoke! So thinking, her foot stirred restlessly, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I don't call this <em>life</em>, do you?"</p>

<p>"What do you call life?" said St. John.</p>

<p>"Fighting&mdash;revolution," she said, still gazing at the doomed
city. "You only care for books, I know."</p>

<p>"You're quite wrong," said St. John.</p>

<p>"Explain," she urged, for there were no guns to be aimed at bodies,
and she turned to another kind of warfare.</p>

<p>"What do I care for? People," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>am</em> surprised!" she exclaimed. "You look so
awfully serious. Do let's be friends and tell each other what
we're like. I hate being cautious, don't you?"</p>

<p>But St. John was decidedly cautious, as she could see by the
sudden constriction of his lips, and had no intention of revealing
his soul to a young lady. "The ass is eating my hat," he remarked,
and stretched out for it instead of answering her. Evelyn blushed
very slightly and then turned with some impetuosity upon Mr. Perrott,
and when they mounted again it was Mr. Perrott who lifted her
to her seat.</p>

<p>"When one has laid the eggs one eats the omelette," said Hughling
Elliot, exquisitely in French, a hint to the rest of them that
it was time to ride on again.</p>

<p>The midday sun which Hirst had foretold was beginning to beat
down hotly. The higher they got the more of the sky appeared,
until the mountain was only a small tent of earth against an enormous
blue background. The English fell silent; the natives who walked
beside the donkeys broke into queer wavering songs and tossed
jokes from one to the other. The way grew very steep, and each
rider kept his eyes fixed on the hobbling curved form of the rider
and donkey directly in front of him. Rather more strain was being
put upon their bodies than is quite legitimate in a party of pleasure,
and Hewet overheard one or two slightly grumbling remarks.</p>

<p>"Expeditions in such heat are perhaps a little unwise," Mrs.
Elliot murmured to Miss Allan.</p>

<p>But Miss Allan returned, "I always like to get to the top"; and
it was true, although she was a big woman, stiff in the joints,
and unused to donkey-riding, but as her holidays were few she
made the most of them.</p>

<p>The vivacious white figure rode well in front; she had somehow
possessed herself of a leafy branch and wore it round her hat
like a garland. They went on for a few minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"The view will be wonderful," Hewet assured them, turning round
in his saddle and smiling encouragement. Rachel caught his eye
and smiled too. They struggled on for some time longer, nothing
being heard but the clatter of hooves striving on the loose stones.
Then they saw that Evelyn was off her ass, and that Mr. Perrott
was standing in the attitude of a statesman in Parliament Square,
stretching an arm of stone towards the view. A little to the left
of them was a low ruined wall, the stump of an Elizabethan watch-tower.</p>

<p>"I couldn't have stood it much longer," Mrs. Elliot confided
to Mrs. Thornbury, but the excitement of being at the top in another
moment and seeing the view prevented any one from answering her.
One after another they came out on the flat space at the top and
stood overcome with wonder. Before them they beheld an immense
space&mdash;grey sands running into forest, and forest merging in mountains,
and mountains washed by air, the infinite distances of South America.
A river ran across the plain, as flat as the land, and appearing
quite as stationary. The effect of so much space was at first
rather chilling. They felt themselves very small, and for some
time no one said anything. Then Evelyn exclaimed, "Splendid!"
She took hold of the hand that was next her; it chanced to be
Miss Allan's hand.</p>

<p>"North&mdash;South&mdash;East &mdash;West," said Miss Allan, jerking her
head slightly towards the points of the compass.</p>

<p>Hewet, who had gone a little in front, looked up at his guests
as if to justify himself for having brought them. He observed
how strangely the people standing in a row with their figures
bent slightly forward and their clothes plastered by the wind
to the shape of their bodies resembled naked statues. On their
pedestal of earth they looked unfamiliar and noble, but in another
moment they had broken their rank, and he had to see to the laying
out of food. Hirst came to his help, and they handed packets of
chicken and bread from one to another.</p>

<p>As St. John gave Helen her packet she looked him full in the
face and said:</p>

<p>"Do you remember&mdash;two women?"</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>"I do," he answered.</p>

<p>"So you're the two women!" Hewet exclaimed, looking from Helen
to Rachel.</p>

<p>"Your lights tempted us," said Helen. "We watched you playing
cards, but we never knew that we were being watched."</p>

<p>"It was like a thing in a play," Rachel added.</p>

<p>"And Hirst couldn't describe you," said Hewet.</p>

<p>It was certainly odd to have seen Helen and to find nothing to
say about her.</p>

<p>Hughling Elliot put up his eyeglass and grasped the situation.</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything more dreadful," he said, pulling at
the joint of a chicken's leg, "than being seen when one isn't
conscious of it. One feels sure one has been caught doing something
ridiculous&mdash;looking at one's tongue in a hansom, for instance."</p>

<p>Now the others ceased to look at the view, and drawing together
sat down in a circle round the baskets.</p>

<p>"And yet those little looking-glasses in hansoms have a fascination
of their own," said Mrs. Thornbury. "One's features look so different
when one can only see a bit of them."</p>

<p>"There will soon be very few hansom cabs left," said Mrs. Elliot.
"And four-wheeled cabs &mdash;I assure you even at Oxford it's
almost impossible to get a four-wheeled cab."</p>

<p>"I wonder what happens to the horses," said Susan.</p>

<p>"Veal pie," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"It's high time that horses should become extinct anyhow," said
Hirst. "They're distressingly ugly, besides being vicious."</p>

<p>But Susan, who had been brought up to understand that the horse
is the noblest of God's creatures, could not agree, and Venning
thought Hirst an unspeakable ass, but was too polite not to continue
the conversation.</p>

<p>"When they see us falling out of aeroplanes they get some of
their own back, I expect," he remarked.</p>

<p>"You fly?" said old Mr. Thornbury, putting on his spectacles
to look at him.</p>

<p>"I hope to, some day," said Arthur.</p>

<p>Here flying was discussed at length, and Mrs. Thornbury delivered
an opinion which was almost a speech to the effect that it would
be quite necessary in time of war, and in England we were terribly
behind-hand. "If I were a young fellow," she concluded, "I should
certainly qualify." It was odd to look at the little elderly lady,
in her grey coat and skirt, with a sandwich in her hand, her eyes
lighting up with zeal as she imagined herself a young man in an
aeroplane. For some reason, however, the talk did not run easily
after this, and all they said was about drink and salt and the
view. Suddenly Miss Allan, who was seated with her back to the
ruined wall, put down her sandwich, picked something off her neck,
and remarked, "I'm covered with little creatures." It was true,
and the discovery was very welcome. The ants were pouring down
a glacier of loose earth heaped between the stones of the ruin&mdash;large
brown ants with polished bodies. She held out one on the back
of her hand for Helen to look at.</p>

<p>"Suppose they sting?" said Helen.</p>

<p>"They will not sting, but they may infest the victuals," said
Miss Allan, and measures were taken at once to divert the ants
from their course. At Hewet's suggestion it was decided to adopt
the methods of modern warfare against an invading army. The table-cloth
represented the invaded country, and round it they built barricades
of baskets, set up the wine bottles in a rampart, made fortifications
of bread and dug fosses of salt. When an ant got through it was
exposed to a fire of bread-crumbs, until Susan pronounced that
that was cruel, and rewarded those brave spirits with spoil in
the shape of tongue. Playing this game they lost their stiffness,
and even became unusually daring, for Mr. Perrott, who was very
shy, said, "Permit me," and removed an ant from Evelyn's neck.</p>

<p>"It would be no laughing matter really," said Mrs. Elliot confidentially
to Mrs. Thornbury, "if an ant did get between the vest and the
skin."</p>

<p>The noise grew suddenly more clamorous, for it was discovered
that a long line of ants had found their way on to the table-cloth
by a back entrance, and if success could be gauged by noise, Hewet
had every reason to think his party a success. Nevertheless he
became, for no reason at all, profoundly depressed.</p>

<p>"They are not satisfactory; they are ignoble," he thought, surveying
his guests from a little distance, where he was gathering together
the plates. He glanced at them all, stooping and swaying and gesticulating
round the table-cloth. Amiable and modest, respectable in many
ways, lovable even in their contentment and desire to be kind,
how mediocre they all were, and capable of what insipid cruelty
to one another! There was Mrs. Thornbury, sweet but trivial in
her maternal egoism; Mrs. Elliot, perpetually complaining of her
lot; her husband a mere pea in a pod; and Susan&mdash;she had no self,
and counted neither one way nor the other; Venning was as honest
and as brutal as a schoolboy; poor old Thornbury merely trod his
round like a horse in a mill; and the less one examined into Evelyn's
character the better, he suspected. Yet these were the people
with money, and to them rather than to others was given the management
of the world. Put among them some one more vital, who cared for
life or for beauty, and what an agony, what a waste would they
inflict on him if he tried to share with them and not to scourge!</p>

<p>"There's Hirst," he concluded, coming to the figure of his friend;
with his usual little frown of concentration upon his forehead
he was peeling the skin off a banana. "And he's as ugly as sin."
For the ugliness of St. John Hirst, and the limitations that went
with it, he made the rest in some way responsible. It was their
fault that he had to live alone. Then he came to Helen, attracted
to her by the sound of her laugh. She was laughing at Miss Allan.
"You wear combinations in this heat?" she said in a voice which
was meant to be private. He liked the look of her immensely, not
so much her beauty, but her largeness and simplicity, which made
her stand out from the rest like a great stone woman, and he passed
on in a gentler mood. His eye fell upon Rachel. She was lying
back rather behind the others resting on one elbow; she might
have been thinking precisely the same thoughts as Hewet himself.
Her eyes were fixed rather sadly but not intently upon the row
of people opposite her. Hewet crawled up to her on his knees,
with a piece of bread in his hand.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at?" he asked.</p>

<p>She was a little startled, but answered directly, "Human beings."</p>
