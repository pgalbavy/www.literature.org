<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was a world of Mexicans in the plaza when Hooker rode down
through the town. Never, it seemed to him, had he seen so many or liked
them less.
</p><p>To the handful of Americans who remained to man the mill and mine, they
were easily a hundred to one; and though their eyes were wide with fear
of the imminent rebels, they had an evil way of staring at him which he
did not relish.
</p><p>Even at the hotel, where the Spanish-Mexican aristocracy was massed
ten deep, he sensed the same feeling of veiled hostility and wondered
vaguely what it might portend. If Philip De Lancey, for making love to
a girl, was drafted into the army, what would happen to him if these
people should ever break loose? And did they have the courage to do
their worst?
</p><p>He lingered around the door for a while, hoping to meet Don Juan
or some American who would tell him the news; then, disgusted with
everything, he flung away and left them to themselves. Fortuna was not
a white man's country--he could see that without a diagram--but at the
same time he intended to hold his mine until he could hear from Phil.
</p><p>Let the tides of insurrection come and go, let the red-flaggers take
the town and the Federals take it back again--at the end he would still
be found at the Eagle Tail, unless Phil received his title to the mine.
</p><p>As for Aragon, whose fine Italian hand he perceived behind the sudden
taking off of Phil, let him make what trades he would with the
<u>rurales</u> and Manuel del Rey, even to the giving of his daughter's
hand; but if, taking advantage of the unsettled times, he dared to try
to steal their mine, then there would be war to the knife.
</p><p>It is a fine, comforting thing to be single-minded and of one purpose.
All the rest of life is simplified and ordered then, and a man knows
when to raise his hand and when to hold it back.
</p><p>In his letter Phil had said nothing about their mine, but he was a
Mexican citizen still, and the mine was in his name. But he was his
pardner and free to hold it in his stead; and that he determined to
do--not only hold it, but work it for a stake. Then, when the title was
passed and all made certain, they could turn it over to Kruger and quit
the accursed country.
</p><p>As for the girl, Bud decided that she could take care of herself
without any assistance from him, and dismissed her from his mind.
</p><p>Back at the mine he found Amigo guarding camp from the hilltop, and
after telling him the gist of his troubles, the two of them went to
work. Every day, while one of them dug out the ore, the other crushed
and washed it and watched as he horned out the gold. Their rifles they
kept beside them and pistols in their belts; and every time a Mexican
dropped into camp, as one did now and then in the general unrest, he
felt the silent menace of arms in readiness and continued on his way.
</p><p>For a week they labored on together, grim, watchful, expectant--then,
at the break of day, they heard a distant rattle of arms, like the
tearing of a cloth, and knew that the battle was on.
</p><p>The great whistle at Fortuna opened with its full, bass roar, and Amigo
snatched up his gun and went loping down the cañon, drawn irresistibly
by the sound of conflict. Bud lingered, climbing higher and higher to
get a view of the country. But his young blood clamored for action too,
and soon he was mounted and gone.
</p><p>The fighting was not at the American town, but down the valley by Old
Fortuna, and as Hooker galloped on toward the sound of the firing he
noticed that it was on the move. Already the cowardly rebels were
retreating--the volunteers from Fortuna were hurrying to get closer
to them, the <u>rurales</u> were riding to flank them; and when Bud jumped
his horse up the last hill and looked down into the broad, cultivated
valley he saw the dust of their flight.
</p><p>Down the fenced trail that led to the lower country the mounted
<u>insurrectos</u> were spurring in a rout; across the newly plowed fields
of Aragon the men on foot were making a short cut for the hills; and
all about them, like leaping grasshoppers, sprang up puffs of dust.
</p><p>Now they plunged into the willow brush along the river, where it swung
in against the ridge; and as their pursuers broke into the open they
halted and returned the fire. The bullets struck up the dust like
hailstones in front of the oncoming irregulars, a man or two in the
lead went down, and they faltered. Then, as frantically as the rebels,
they turned and ran for cover.
</p><p>While defenders and invaders shot back and forth across the broad
field, Bud put spurs to his horse and rode closer, and when he came
out on another hilltop he was just in time to see the <u>rurales</u> come
pelting in from the west, and take the <u>revoltosos</u> on the flank. There
was a great deal of long-distance firing then, while the rebels slowly
retreated, and finally, with a last defiant volley, the defenders
turned back from their pursuit and marched triumphantly to Old Fortuna.
</p><p>There, amid numerous <u>vivas</u>, Don Cipriano rolled out a cask of
<u>mescal</u> and, after a fiery speech, invited the victors to help
themselves. So they fell to drinking and carousing, and the one
defender who had been wounded was bandaged and made much of, while a
great crowd from the upper town looked on in awe and admiration.
</p><p>At last Manuel del Rey and his <u>rurales</u> returned from harassing
the enemy and, with several wounded prisoners in their midst, the
valor-drunk Mexicans formed a riotous procession and went marching
back to town. Every horse and mule was carrying double, guns were
being dropped, broad hats knocked off, and ever, as they marched, they
shouted:
</p><p>"_Viva Madero! Viva Mejico! Muerte á los revoltosos!_"
</p><p>It was an edifying spectacle to an American, and with the rest Bud
tagged along to the plaza, where they had speeches and cheers galore
and more <u>mescal</u> at the company's <u>cantina</u>. But in the midst of it,
while he sat laughing on his horse by the hotel, Bud felt a gravel
strike his broad hat from above and, looking furtively up, he beheld
Gracia Aragon smiling down at him from the balcony.
</p><p>She beckoned him with a swift movement and gazed out over the
assemblage again, and after a few moments of deliberation Hooker tied
his horse and wandered into the hotel.
</p><p>A tingle of excitement went over him as he tramped up to the ladies'
parlor, for he had never met Gracia face to face. But he disguised his
qualms by assuming a mask-like grimness of countenance and, when the
glorious Gracia glided out of her room to meet him, he only blinked and
stood pat.
</p><p>A long experience as a poker-player was all that saved him from
betrayal, for there was something in her very presence which made his
heart leap and pound. But he only gazed at her somberly, without even
so much as raising his hat.
</p><p>Back in Texas, in his social world, it was considered almost unmanly
thus to salute the ladies. So he stood there, his big sombrero pulled
down over his mop of light hair, gazing at her without a blink.
</p><p>Perhaps it was not altogether so friendly a scrutiny of her charming
features as Gracia expected, for he remembered what she had done to
his pardner; but if she sensed such a rare thing as disapproval from
a young man, she was too excited to show it. Her lips trembled, and
she looked back furtively, meanwhile drawing him into an alcove by the
slightest twitch of his sleeve.
</p><p>"Don't talk too loud," she whispered. "My mother is listening from the
room--but for the love of God, tell me, where is Phil?"
</p><p>"I don't know," answered Bud, trying to lower his big voice to
a boudoir softness; "he joined the <u>rurales</u> and was ordered
north--that's all I know."
</p><p>"Yes, yes, to be sure; but haven't you heard from him?"
</p><p>She seemed to be all impatience to snatch his news and fly with it, but
Bud was in no such hurry. And so far was he from being a carpet knight
that he immediately raised his voice to its normal bass. It was all
right for Phil and his kind to talk by signs and whispers, but that was
not his style.
</p><p>"Not since he went away," he said. "He left me a little note, then,
saying--"
</p><p>"Saying what?" she demanded breathlessly.
</p><p>"Well, saying that he had enlisted to keep from being executed,
and--that's about all!"
</p><p>"And not a word about me?"
</p><p>"Yes," admitted Bud; "he said he'd try to put up with it--on account of
you--and--"
</p><p>"What?" she entreated, taking him beseechingly by the coat.
</p><p>"Well," stammered Hooker, shifting his feet and looking away, "he told
me to kinder take care of you--while he was gone."
</p><p>"Ah!" she breathed, still standing close to him, "and will you do it?"
</p><p>"I reckon so," said Bud, "if we have any trouble."
</p><p>"But I'm in trouble now!" she cried. "I'm watched--I can't get
away--and I'm afraid!"
</p><p>"Afraid of what?" he demanded.
</p><p>"Of him," she answered, her voice breaking--"of Manuel del Rey!"
</p><p>"Well," replied Hooker bluntly, "I've got nothing to do with that--I
can't interfere in your love-affairs--but if the's war and they try to
take the town, you can count on me."
</p><p>"Oh, thank you," she said, bowing satirically. "And do you expect a
war?"
</p><p>"Not with that bunch of <u>hombres</u>!" returned Bud, waving a disparaging
hand toward the noise of the shouting. At this she broke down and
laughed. Evidently she was not so fearful of discovery after all.
</p><p>"You forget, sir," she said, "that I am a Mexican!"
</p><p>Then, as he failed to show any signs of contrition, she changed her
mood again.
</p><p>"But wait!" she ran on, her eyes flashing. "Perhaps we are not so eager
to defend our government when we have a new one every year. But if the
men who are gathering in Chihuahua invade our country, you will find
that as Sonorans those men will fight to the death.
</p><p>"You laugh because you do not understand. But why should we Sonorans
fight side by side with the Federals and <u>rurales</u>? Are they not the
soldiers of Diaz, who have simply changed to another master? That
Manuel del Rey was last year hunting down Maderistas in the hills; now
he is fighting for Madero! And to-morrow? Who can say?"
</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders scornfully, and Hooker perceived that she
was in earnest in her dislike of the dashing captain, but prudence
warned him to say nothing if he would escape being drawn into the
quarrel.
</p><p>"No," she went on, after an expectant pause, "let the <u>rurales</u> pursue
these bandits--they are hired for that purpose! But if Orozco and
Salazar join this <u>ladrón</u>, Bernardo Bravo, and seek to capture our
towns, then, Señor Americano, you will see real war and men fighting to
the death! Ah, you laugh again--you are a Texan and judge us Sonorans
by the cowardly Chihuahuans--but it is the truth. And I, for one," she
added naïvely, "would be almost glad to have war. Do you know why? To
see if you would really defend me!"
</p><p>She smiled, looking frankly into his eyes, and Bud blushed to the roots
of his hair, but once again he held his peace.
</p><p>"What, <u>señor</u>," she bantered; "you do not speak? Surely, then, your
friend De Lancey was wrong when he said you would save me! For look,
Mr. Hooker, I am promised to marry dear Phil; but how can I manage that
when Manuel del Rey is watching me? It is impossible, is it not?"
</p><p>"Seems so," muttered Bud, and in the back of his head he began to think
quickly. Here was the fountainhead of his misfortunes, and if she had
her way she would lay all his plans in ruins--and even then not marry
Phil. In fact, from the light way she spoke, he sensed that she did
not intend to marry him. Her grudge was against Manuel del Rey who
drove away all her lovers.
</p><p>"Well," he ventured, "there's no rush, I reckon--Phil's enlisted for
five years."
</p><p>"Ha!" she cried contemptuously. "And do you think he will serve? No! At
a word from me he will flee to the border and I shall join him in the
United States!"
</p><p>"What?" demanded Bud. "Phil desert?"
</p><p>In a moment he saw what such a move would mean to him--to Kruger and
the Eagle Tail--and he woke suddenly from his calm.
</p><p>"Here now," he said, scowling as he saw that she was laughing at him,
"you've made me and Phil enough trouble. You let that boy alone, savvy?"
</p><p>He stooped toward her as he spoke, fixing her with masterful eyes that
had tamed many a bad horse and man, and she shrank away instinctively.
Then she glanced at him shyly and edged over toward the open door.
</p><p>"I will do what I please, Mr. Hooker," she returned, balancing on the
verge of flight.
</p><p>"All right," Bud came back; "but don't you call me in on it. You've
made a fool out of Phil--I suppose you'd like to get me, too. Then your
father would grab our mine."
</p><p>"What do you mean?" she challenged, turning back upon him.
</p><p>"I mean this," responded Hooker warmly: "Phil holds the title to our
mine. If he deserts he loses his Mexican citizenship and his claim is
no good. But you don't need to think that your father will get the
mine then, because he'll have to whip me first!"
</p><p>"O-ho!" she sneered. "So that is what you are thinking of? You are a
true Gringo, Mr. Hooker--always thinking about the money!"
</p><p>"Yes," returned Bud; "and even at that I believe your old man will best
me!"
</p><p>She laughed again, with sudden capriciousness, and stood tapping the
floor with her foot.
</p><p>"Ah, I see," she said at length, gazing at him reproachfully; "you
think I am working for my father. You think I got poor Phil into all
this trouble in order to cheat him of his mine. But let me tell you,
Señor Gringo," she cried with sudden fire, "that I did not! I have
nothing to do with my father and his schemes. But if you do not trust
me--"
</p><p>She turned dramatically to go, but when Hooker made no effort to stay
her she returned once more to the attack.
</p><p>"No," she said, "it was because he was an American--because he was
brave--that I put my faith in Phil. These Mexican men are cowards--they
are afraid to stand up and fight! But Philip dared to make love to
me--he dared to sing to me at night--and when Manuel del Rey tried to
stop him he stood up and made a fight!
</p><p>"Ah, that is what I admire--a man who is brave. And let me tell you,
Señor Hooker, I shall always love your friend! If I could run away I
would marry him to-morrow; but this cur, Manuel del Rey, stands in the
way. Even my own father is against me. But I don't care--I don't care
what happens--only do not think that I am not your friend!"
</p><p>She paused now and glanced at him shyly, and as her eloquent eyes
met his own Bud felt suddenly that she was sincere. The gnawing and
corrosive doubts that had eaten at his heart fell away, and he saw her
now in her true beauty, with no uneasy thoughts of treachery to poison
his honest love.
</p><p>"I believe you, lady," he said, "and I'm glad to know you," he added,
taking off his hat and bowing awkwardly. "Anything I can do for you,
don't hesitate to ask for it--only I can't go against my pardners on
this mine."
</p><p>He bowed again and retreated toward the door, but she followed him
impulsively.
</p><p>"Shake hands," she said, holding out both her own, "and will you help
me?"
</p><p>"Sure!" answered Bud, and as her soft fingers closed on his he took
them gently, for fear that he might crush them and never know.
