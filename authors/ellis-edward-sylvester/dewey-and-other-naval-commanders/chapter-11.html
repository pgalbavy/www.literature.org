<p>Cause of the War of 1812 &mdash;Discreditable Work of the Land
Forces&mdash;Brilliant Record of the Navy&mdash;The <em>Constitution</em>
&mdash;Captain Isaac Hull&mdash;Battle Between the <em>Constitution</em>
and <em>Guerriere</em> &mdash;Winning a Wager.</p>

<p>Probably no hostilities in which the United States was ever engaged
so abound with stirring, romantic and remarkable exploits as those
upon the ocean in the War of 1812.</p>

<p>Now, as to the cause of the war between England and our country:
Great Britain was engaged in a tremendous conflict with France,
at the head of which was the greatest military leader of the world,
Napoleon Bonaparte. England needed every soldier and sailor she
could get. Some of them deserted to our ships, so her officers
began the practice of stopping such vessels on the ocean, searching
them for deserters, and if found they were taken away. Sometimes
she took Americans, because she knew they were good seamen, and,
to excuse her action, she declared they were deserters from the
British navy.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>IMPRESSING AMERICAN SAILORS</em>.]</p>

<p>This action was against the law of nations. She had no more right
to molest an American vessel than she had to land a force on our
coast, march inland and search the house of a private family.
We protested, but she paid no attention. It happened more than
once that when our vessels refused to be searched the English
fired into them and killed and wounded some of the American crews.
If any nation acted that way toward England to-day she would declare
war at once, and so would any other nation.</p>

<p>Finding there was no peaceable way of stopping the unbearable
conduct of Great Britain, our country, in the month of June, 1812,
declared war against her, and it lasted until the early part of
1815.</p>

<p>There was one feature of that war which it is not pleasant for
Americans to recall. It opened with a cowardly surrender by General
William Hull of Detroit to the English army, and for two years
our land forces did very little to their credit. They set out
to invade Canada several times, but in every instance were beaten.
The leading generals were "poor sticks," quarreled among themselves,
and for a time failed to gain any advantage. The trouble was not
with the soldiers. They were among the best in the world, but
their leaders were of no account. By and by, however, the poor
officers were weeded out and good ones took their places. Then
something was accomplished in which we all could feel pride.</p>

<p>It was just the other way on the ocean. From the very start our
naval vessels and privateers won the most brilliant of victories.
This was the more remarkable when several facts are kept in mind.
Great Britain had been at war so long that she had the most powerful
navy by far in the world. It numbered one thousand and thirty-six
vessels, of which two hundred and fifty-four were ships-of-the-line,
not one of which carried less than seventy guns of large calibre.
This prodigious navy was manned by one hundred and forty-four
thousand sailors, and eighty-five of her war vessels were on the
American coast, equipped and ready for action.</p>

<p>In amazing contrast to all this, we had only twenty large war
vessels and a number of gunboats that were of little account.
The disparity was so great that our Government, after looking
at the situation and discussing the matter, decided that it would
be folly to fight England on the ocean, and it was decided not
to do so. When Captains Stewart and Bainbridge learned of this
decision, they went to President Madison and his advisers and
insisted that the American navy, weak as it was, should be given
a chance of showing what it could do. Consent was finally given,
and then opened the wonderful career of our cruisers and privateers.</p>

<p>Among the frigates that had been built during our war with France
was the <em>Constitution</em>, which carried 44 guns. She earned
the name of being one of the luckiest ships in the navy, and because
of her astonishing record was named "Old Ironsides." The old hulk
of this historical ship is still carefully preserved in remembrance
of her brilliant record, which in some respects has never been
equalled.</p>

<p>Sailors are superstitious, and the good name which the <em>Constitution</em>
gained made it easy to get all the seamen needed. When you come
to look into the matter you will find that the <em>Constitution</em>
was a lucky ship, because it was always officered by the best
men we had, and they were wise enough to choose the finest crews.</p>

<p>The captain of the <em>Constitution</em>, when the war broke
out, was Isaac Hull, a nephew of General William Hull, who made
the cowardly surrender of Detroit. He was born in Connecticut
in 1773, and died in 1843. He was one of the brilliant young officers
who received his commission in 1798, and was commander of the
<em>Argus</em> during the war with Tripoli. He was made a captain
in 1806, and the following year was given command of the <em>Constitution</em>.</p>

<p>Upon learning that the war had broken out, Captain Hull left
the Chesapeake, with orders to join the squadron under the command
of Captain Rodgers at New York. When off Barnegat, New Jersey,
he was sighted by the blockading squadron of Captain Philip Bowes
Vere Broke, which gave chase. The ingenuity and skill displayed
by Captain Hull in escaping from the enemy, when all escape seemed
hopeless, is still referred to as one of the most remarkable exploits
in the history of the American navy. The chase lasted for more
than two days and three nights, and it is safe to say that very
few commanders placed in the situation of Captain Hull would have
been able to save themselves from capture.</p>

<p>Captain Hull sailed on a cruise from Boston on August 21, just
in time to dodge an order from Washington to remain in port until
further orders. On the afternoon of August 19, when several hundred
miles to the eastward of Halifax, he sighted the British frigate
<em>Guerriere</em>. Her commander, Captain James E. Dacres, was
an old acquaintance of Hull, and the two had made a wager of a
hat during peace that if they ever met in battle the other would
run.</p>

<p>The British officer was as anxious as Hull for a fight, and they
drew near each other, both confident of winning the wager made
half in jest a brief time before.</p>

<p>Great interest attaches to this naval battle, for it was the
first of its kind and a fair test of the respective prowess of
ships of and crews of that nature. The <em>Constitution</em> was
somewhat the superior, carrying 55 guns and four hundred and sixty-eight
men, while the <em>Guerriere</em> had 49 guns and two hundred
and sixty-three men, but all of the latter were under fine discipline,
while most of the Americans were green hands. Captain Dacres was
confident of his superiority, and had no doubt that when the two
frigates met the <em>Constitution</em> would be compelled speedily
to strike her colors. He waited for the American to come up, each
having cleared for action.</p>

<p>A little after four o'clock the two exchanged broadsides, but
they were so far apart that no damage was done. Dacres manoeuvred
for a raking position, but Hull would not permit it, nor could
he obtain one for himself. There was much wearing and manoeuvring,
which prevented the firing on either side from being effective.
Each was wary of the other and took the utmost pains to prevent
his securing any advantage.</p>

<p>When it became certain that the battle was to be one at close
range, Hull ordered the firing to cease, in order that the fullest
preparation could be made for the next broadside. He knew the
skill of his men in marksmanship, and determined to hold his fire
until the most advantageous position was reached. As he drew near
his enemy, the latter continued firing, and some of her shots
were so effective that the crews cheered. The Americans, most
of them barefooted and stripped to the waist, were standing beside
their guns eager and impatient for the order to fire, but Hull,
when appealed to, shook his head. It was a proof of the fine discipline
of the American crew that when they saw two of their comrades
killed by the fire of the enemy, they silently waited without
murmur for the order whose delay they could not comprehend.</p>

<p>Not until about a hundred feet distant and in the exact position
desired did Captain Hull give the order to fire as the guns bore.
To quote Maclay: "In an instant the frigate belched forth a storm
of iron hail that carried death and destruction into the opposing
ship. The effect of this carefully aimed broadside at short range
was terrific. The splinters were seen to fly over the British
frigate like a cloud, some of them reaching as high as the mizzen
top, while the cheers of her men abruptly ceased and the shrieks
and groans of the wounded were heard. The Americans had struck
their first earnest blow, and it was a staggering one. The Englishman
felt its full weight, and perhaps for the first time realized
that this was no child's play."</p>

<p>The Americans displayed remarkable skill in their gunnery, as
it may be said they have always done. The main yard of the enemy
was shot away in the slings, and hull, rigging and sails were
badly mangled. A shot passing through the mizzenmast close to
the deck, added to the stress from the sails, caused it to break
in two and fall over the quarter. One curious effect of this dragging
in the water was to make the wreckage act like a rudder, bringing
her up to the wind in spite of the opposition of the helm. While
the damage on the <em>Constitution</em> was less, it clogged her
action, but she secured a position from which she delivered two
raking broadsides. Then as the vessel see-sawed, the jibboom of
the <em>Guerriere</em> crossed the <em>Constitution's</em> quarter
deck. Both crews made ready to board, but each found the other
so fully prepared that neither attempted it. Meanwhile the riflemen
in the rigging were working with destructive energy. In each of
the <em>Constitution's</em> tops were seven marines, six loading
for the seventh, who was the best marksman. A good many officers
were wounded and killed on both sides.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE "CONSTITUTION" AND THE "GUERRIERE</em>."]</p>

<p>Although the vessels had been lashed together, their lurching
broke them apart, and the Englishman gained a chance to use his
broadsides. A fire broke out on the <em>Constitution</em>, but
it was quickly extinguished, and the shot of the American soon
made a complete wreck of the enemy. When it became clear that
the <em>Guerriere</em> could make no further resistance, Captain
Hull drew off to repair the damages to his own ship. Another English
frigate was likely to appear at any moment, and she would make
short work of the <em>Constitution</em> in her crippled condition.
It took but a short time to complete the work, when she returned
to her former position beside the wallowing <em>Guerriere</em>.
A lieutenant was sent on board to receive the surrender, which
Dacres gave with painful reluctance. When brought to the side
of the <em>Constitution</em>, Hull assisted him up the rope ladder.
Dacres extended his sword.</p>

<p>"No" replied Hull, "I will not take it from one who knows so
well how to use it, but I must trouble you to pay me that hat
I have won."</p>
