A THRUSH was feeding on a myrtle-tree and did not move from it
because its berries were so delicious.  A Fowler observed her
staying so long in one spot, and having well bird-limed his

exclaimed, "O foolish creature that I am! For the sake of a
little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my life."
