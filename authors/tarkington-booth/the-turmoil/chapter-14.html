<p>The outward usualness of things continued after dinner. It was
Sheridan's custom to read the evening paper beside the fire in
the library, while his wife, sitting near by, either sewed (from
old habit) or allowed herself to be repeatedly baffled by one
of the simpler forms of solitaire. To-night she did neither, but
sat in her customary chair, gazing at the fire, while Sheridan
let the unfolded paper rest upon his lap, though now and then
he lifted it, as if to read, and let it fall back upon his knees
again. Bibbs came in noiselessly and sat in a corner, doing nothing;
and from a "reception-room" across the hall an indistinct vocal
murmur became just audible at intervals. Once, when this murmur
grew louder, under stress of some irrepressible merriment, Edith's
voice could be heard&mdash;"Bobby, aren't you awful!" and Sheridan
glanced across at his wife appealingly.</p>

<p>She rose at once and went into the "reception-room"; there was
a flurry of whispering, and the sound of tiptoeing in the hall
&mdash;Edith and her suitor changing quarters to a more distant
room. Mrs. Sheridan returned to her chair in the library.</p>

<p>"They won't bother you any more, papa," she said, in a comforting
voice. "She told me at lunch he'd 'phoned he wanted to come up
this evening, and I said I thought he'd better wait a few days,
but she said she'd already told him he could." She paused, then
added, rather guiltily: "I got kind of a notion maybe Roscoe don't
like him as much as he used to. Maybe&mdash;maybe you better ask Roscoe,
papa." And as Sheridan nodded solemnly, she concluded, in haste:
"Don't say I said to. I might be wrong about it, anyway."</p>

<p>He nodded again, and they sat for some time in a silence which
Mrs. Sheridan broke with a little sniff, having fallen into a
reverie that brought tears. "That Miss Vertrees was a good girl,"
she said. "<em>SHE </em>was all right."</p>

<p>Her husband evidently had no difficulty in following her train
of thought, for he nodded once more, affirmatively.</p>

<p>"Did you &mdash;How did you fix it about the&mdash;the Realty Company?"
she faltered. "Did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose heavily, helping himself to his feet by the arms of his
chair. "I fixed it," he said, in a husky voice. "I moved Cantwell
up, and put Johnston in Cantwell's place, and split up Johnston's
work among the four men with salaries high enough to take it."
He went to her, put his hand upon her shoulder, and drew a long,
audible, tremulous breath. "It's my bedtime, mamma; I'm goin'
up." He dropped the hand from her shoulder and moved slowly away,
but when he reached the door he stopped and spoke again, without
turning to look at her. "The Realty Company'll go right on just
the same," he said. "It's like&mdash;it's like sand, mamma. It puts
me in mind of chuldern playin' in a sand-pile. One of 'em sticks
his finger in the sand and makes a hole, and another of 'em'll
pat the place with his hand, and all the little grains of sand
run in and fill it up and settle against one another; and then,
right away it's flat on top again, and you can't tell there ever
was a hole there. The Realty Company'll go on all right, mamma.
There ain't anything anywhere, I reckon, that wouldn't go right
on&mdash;just the same."</p>

<p>And he passed out slowly into the hall; then they heard his heavy
tread upon the stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan, rising to follow him, turned a piteous face to
her son. "It's so forlone," she said, chokingly. "That's the first
time he spoke since he came in the house this evening. I know
it must 'a' hurt him to hear Edith laughin' with that Lamhorn.
She'd oughtn't to let him come, right the very first evening this
way; she'd oughtn't to done it! She just seems to lose her head
over him, and it scares me. You heard what Sibyl said the other
day, and&mdash;and you heard what&mdash;what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What Edith said to Sibyl?" Bibbs finished the sentence for her.</p>

<p>"We <em>CAN'T </em>have any trouble o' <em>THAT </em>kind!" she
wailed. "Oh, it looks as if movin' up to this New House had brought
us awful bad luck! It scares me!" She put both her hands over
her face. "Oh, Bibbs, Bibbs! if you only wasn't so <em>QUEER!
</em>If you could only been a kind of dependable son! I don't
know what we're all comin' to!" And, weeping, she followed her
husband.</p>

<p>Bibbs gazed for a while at the fire; then he rose abruptly, like
a man who has come to a decision, and briskly sought the room&mdash;it
was called "the smoking-room"&mdash;where Edith sat with Mr. Lamhorn.
They looked up in no welcoming manner, at Bibbs's entrance, and
moved their chairs to a less conspicuous adjacency.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Bibbs, pleasantly; and he seated himself
in a leather easy-chair near them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Edith, plainly astonished.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he returned, smiling.</p>

<p>She frowned. "Did you want something?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing in the world. Father and mother have gone up-stairs;
I sha'n't be going up for several hours, and there didn't seem
to be anybody left for me to chat with except you and Mr. Lamhorn."</p>

<p>"'<em>CHAT </em>with'!" she echoed, incredulously.</p>

<p>"I can talk about almost anything," said Bibbs with an air of
genial politeness. "It doesn't matter to <em>ME. I </em>don't
know much about business&mdash;if that's what you happened to be talking
about. But you aren't in business, are you, Mr. Lamhorn?"</p>

<p>"Not now," returned Lamhorn, shortly.</p>

<p>"I'm not, either," said Bibbs. "It was getting cloudier than
usual, I noticed, just before dark, and there was wind from the
southwest. Rain to-morrow, I shouldn't be surprised."</p>

<p>He seemed to feel that he had begun a conversation the support
of which had now become the pleasurable duty of other parties;
and he sat expectantly, looking first at his sister, then at Lamhorn,
as if implying that it was their turn to speak. Edith returned
his gaze with a mixture of astonishment and increasing anger,
while Mr. Lamhorn was obviously disturbed, though Bibbs had been
as considerate as possible in presenting the weather as a topic.
Bibbs had perceived that Lamhorn had nothing in his mind at any
time except "personalities"&mdash;he could talk about people and he
could make love. Bibbs, wishing to be courteous, offered the weather.</p>

<p>Lamhorn refused it, and concluded from Bibbs's luxurious attitude
in the leather chair that this half-crazy brother was a permanent
fixture for the rest of the evening. There was not reason to hope
that he would move, and Lamhorn found himself in danger of looking
silly.</p>

<p>"I was just going," he said, rising.</p>

<p>"Oh NO!" Edith cried, sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes. Good night! I think I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Bibbs, genially, walking to the door with the
visitor, while Edith stood staring as the two disappeared in the
hall. She heard Bibbs offering to "help" Lamhorn with his overcoat
and the latter rather curtly declining assistance, these episodes
of departure being followed by the closing of the outer door.
She ran into the hall.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" she cried, furiously. "What do
you <em>MEAN? </em>How did you dare come in there when you knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice broke; she made a gesture of rage and despair, and
ran up the stairs, sobbing. She fled to her mother's room, and
when Bibbs came up, a few minutes later, Mrs. Sheridan met him
at his door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bibbs," she said, shaking her head woefully, "you'd oughtn't
to distress your sister! She says you drove that young man right
out of the house. You'd ought to been more considerate."</p>

<p>Bibbs smiled faintly, noting that Edith's door was open, with
Edith's naive shadow motionless across its threshold. "Yes," he
said. "He doesn't appear to be much of a 'man's man.' He ran at
just a glimpse of one."</p>

<p>Edith's shadow moved; her voice came quavering: "You call yourself
one?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he answered. "I said, 'just a glimpse of one.' I didn't
claim&mdash;" But her door slammed angrily; and he turned to his mother.</p>

<p>"There," he said, sighing. "That's almost the first time in my
life I ever tried to be a man of action, mother, and I succeeded
perfectly in what I tried to do. As a consequence I feel like
a horse-thief!"</p>

<p>"You hurt her feelin's," she groaned. "You must 'a' gone at it
too rough, Bibbs."</p>

<p>He looked upon her wanly. "That's my trouble, mother," he murmured.
"I'm a plain, blunt fellow. I have rough ways, and I'm a rough
man."</p>

<p>For once she perceived some meaning in his queerness. "Hush your
nonsense!" she said, good-naturedly, the astral of a troubled
smile appearing. "You go to bed."</p>

<p>He kissed her and obeyed.</p>

<p>Edith gave him a cold greeting the next morning at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"You mustn't do that under a misapprehension," he warned her,
when they were alone in the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Do what under a what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Speak to me. I came into the smoking-room last night 'on purpose,'"
he told her, gravely. "I have a prejudice against that young man."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I guess you think it means a great deal who you
have prejudices against!" In mockery she adopted the manner of
one who implores. "Bibbs, for pity's sake <em>PROMISE </em>me,
<em>DON'T </em>use <em>YOUR </em>influence with papa against him!"
And she laughed louder.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, with peculiar earnestness. "I'll tell you
now, because&mdash;because I've decided I'm one of the family." And
then, as if the earnestness were too heavy for him to carry it
further, he continued, in his usual tone, "I'm drunk with power,
Edith."</p>

<p>"What do you want to tell me?" she demanded, brusquely.</p>

<p>"Lamhorn made love to Sibyl," he said.</p>

<p>Edith hooted. "<em>SHE </em>did to <em>HIM! </em>And because
you overheard that spat between us the other day when I the same
as accused her of it, and said something like that to you afterward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said, gravely. "I <em>KNOW</em>."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I was there, one day a week ago, with Roscoe, and I heard Sibyl
and Lamhorn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edith screamed with laughter. "You were with <em>ROSCOE&mdash;</em>and
you heard Lamhorn making love to Sibyl!"</p>

<p>"No. I heard them quarreling."</p>

<p>"You're funnier than ever, Bibbs!" she cried. "You say he made
love to her because you heard them quarreling!"</p>

<p>"That's it. If you want to know what's 'between' people, you
can&mdash;by the way they quarrel."</p>

<p>"You'll kill me, Bibbs! What were they quarreling about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's how I knew. People who quarrel over nothing!&mdash;it's
always certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edith stopped laughing abruptly, but continued her mockery. "You
ought to know. You've had so much experience, yourself!"</p>

<p>"I haven't any, Edith," he said. "My life has been about as exciting
as an incubator chicken's. But I look out through the glass at
things."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she said, "if you look out through the glass you
must know what effect such stuff would have upon ME!" She rose,
visibly agitated. "What if it <em>WAS </em>true?" she demanded,
bitterly. "What if it was true a hundred times over? You sit there
with your silly face half ready to giggle and half ready to sniffle,
and tell me stories like that, about Sibyl picking on Bobby Lamhorn
and worrying him to death, and you think it matters to ME? What
if I already <em>KNEW </em>all about their 'quarreling'? What
if I understood <em>WHY </em>she&mdash;" She broke off with a violent
gesture, a sweep of her arm extended at full length, as if she
hurled something to the ground. "Do you think a girl that really
cared for a man would pay any attention to <em>THAT? </em>Or to
<em>YOU, </em>Bibbs Sheridan!"</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily, and his gaze was as keen as it was
steady. She met it with unwavering pride. Finally he nodded slowly,
as if she had spoken and he meant to agree with what she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said. "I won't come into the smoking-room again.
I'm sorry, Edith. Nobody can make you see anything now. You'll
never see until you see for yourself. The rest of us will do better
to keep out of it&mdash;especially me!"</p>

<p>"That's sensible," she responded, curtly. "You're most surprising
of all when you're sensible, Bibbs."</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed. "I'm a dull dog. Shake hands and forgive me,
Edith."</p>

<p>Thawing so far as to smile, she underwent this brief ceremony,
and George appeared, summoning Bibbs to the library; Dr. Gurney
was waiting there, he announced. And Bibbs gave his sister a shy
but friendly touch upon the shoulder as a complement to the handshaking,
and left her.</p>

<p>Dr. Gurney was sitting by the log fire, alone in the room, and
he merely glanced over his shoulder when his patient came in.
He was not over fifty, in spite of Sheridan's habitual "ole Doc
Gurney." He was gray, however, almost as thin as Bibbs, and nearly
always he looked drowsy.</p>

<p>"Your father telephoned me yesterday afternoon, Bibbs," he said,
not rising. "Wants me to 'look you over' again. Come around here
in front of me&mdash;between me and the fire. I want to see if I can
see through you."</p>

<p>"You mean you're too sleepy to move," returned Bibbs, complying.
"I think you'll notice that I'm getting worse."</p>

<p>"Taken on about twelve pounds," said Gurney. "Thirteen, maybe."</p>

<p>"Twelve."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't do." The doctor rubbed his eyelids. "You're so
much better I'll have to use some machinery on you before we can
know just where you are. You come down to my place this afternoon.
Walk down&mdash;all the way. I suppose you know why your father wants
to know."</p>

<p>Bibbs nodded. "Machine-shop."</p>

<p>"Still hate it?"</p>

<p>Bibbs nodded again.</p>

<p>"Don't blame you!" the doctor grunted. "Yes, I expect it'll make
a lump in your gizzard again. Well, what do you say? Shall I tell
him you've got the old lump there yet? You still want to write,
do you?"</p>

<p>"What's the use?" Bibbs said, smiling ruefully. "My kind of writing!"</p>

<p>"Yes," the doctor agreed. "I suppose it you broke away and lived
on roots and berries until you began to 'attract the favorable
attention of editors' you might be able to hope for an income
of four or five hundred dollars a year by the time you're fifty."</p>

<p>"That's about it," Bibbs murmured.</p>

<p>"Of course I know what you want to do," said Gurney, drowsily.
"You don't hate the machine-shop only; you hate the whole show&mdash;the
noise and jar and dirt, the scramble&mdash;the whole bloomin' craze
to 'get on.' You'd like to go somewhere in Algiers, or to Taormina,
perhaps, and bask on a balcony, smelling flowers and writing sonnets.
You'd grow fat on it and have a delicate little life all to yourself.
Well, what do you say? I can lie like sixty, Bibbs! Shall I tell
your father he'll lose another of his boys if you don't go to
Sicily?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Sicily," said Bibbs. "I want to stay right
here."</p>

<p>The doctor's drowsiness disappeared for a moment, and he gave
his patient a sharp glance. "It's a risk," he said. "I think we'll
find you're so much better he'll send you back to the shop pretty
quick. Something's got hold of you lately; you're not quite so
lackadaisical as you used to be. But I warn you: I think the shop
will knock you just as it did before, and perhaps even harder,
Bibbs."</p>

<p>He rose, shook himself, and rubbed his eyelids. "Well, when we
go over you this afternoon what are we going to say about it?"</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm ready," said Bibbs, looking at the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Gurney laughed. "Not quite yet; but you may be almost.
We'll see. Don't forget I said to walk down."</p>

<p>And when the examination was concluded, that afternoon, the doctor
informed Bibbs that the result was much too satisfactory to be
pleasing. "Here's a new 'situation' for a one-act farce," he said,
gloomily, to his next patient when Bibbs had gone. "Doctor tells
a man he's well, and that's his death sentence, likely. Dam' funny
world!"</p>

<p>Bibbs decided to walk home, though Gurney had not instructed
him upon this point. In fact, Gurney seemed to have no more instructions
on any point, so discouraging was the young man's improvement.
It was a dingy afternoon, and the smoke was evident not only to
Bibbs's sight, but to his nostrils, though most of the pedestrians
were so saturated with the smell they could no longer detect it.
Nearly all of them walked hurriedly, too intent upon their destinations
to be more than half aware of the wayside; they wore the expressions
of people under a vague yet constant strain. They were all lightly
powdered, inside and out, with fine dust and grit from the hard-paved
streets, and they were unaware of that also. They did not even
notice that they saw the smoke, though the thickened air was like
a shrouding mist. And when Bibbs passed the new "Sheridan Apartments,"
now almost completed, he observed that the marble of the vestibule
was already streaky with soot, like his gloves, which were new.</p>

<p>That recalled to him the faint odor of gasolene in the coupe
on the way from his brother's funeral, and this incited a train
of thought which continued till he reached the vicinity of his
home. His route was by a street parallel to that on which the
New House fronted, and in his preoccupation he walked a block
farther than he intended, so that, having crossed to his own street,
he approached the New House from the north, and as he came to
the corner of Mr. Vertrees's lot Mr. Vertrees's daughter emerged
from the front door and walked thoughtfully down the path to the
old picket gate. She was unconscious of the approach of the pedestrian
from the north, and did not see him until she had opened the gate
and he was almost beside her. Then she looked up, and as she saw
him she started visibly. And if this thing had happened to Robert
Lamhorn, he would have had a thought far beyond the horizon of
faint-hearted Bibbs's thoughts. Lamhorn, indeed, would have spoken
his thought. He would have said: "You jumped because you were
thinking of me!"</p>
