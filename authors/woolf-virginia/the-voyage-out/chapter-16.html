<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Hewet and Rachel had long ago reached the particular place on
the edge of the cliff where, looking down into the sea, you might
chance on jelly-fish and dolphins. Looking the other way, the
vast expanse of land gave them a sensation which is given by no
view, however extended, in England; the villages and the hills
there having names, and the farthest horizon of hills as often
as not dipping and showing a line of mist which is the sea; here
the view was one of infinite sun-dried earth, earth pointed in
pinnacles, heaped in vast barriers, earth widening and spreading
away and away like the immense floor of the sea, earth chequered
by day and by night, and partitioned into different lands, where
famous cities were founded, and the races of men changed from
dark savages to white civilised men, and back to dark savages
again. Perhaps their English blood made this prospect uncomfortably
impersonal and hostile to them, for having once turned their faces
that way they next turned them to the sea, and for the rest of
the time sat looking at the sea. The sea, though it was a thin
and sparkling water here, which seemed incapable of surge or anger,
eventually narrowed itself, clouded its pure tint with grey, and
swirled through narrow channels and dashed in a shiver of broken
waters against massive granite rocks. It was this sea that flowed
up to the mouth of the Thames; and the Thames washed the roots
of the city of London.</p>

<p>Hewet's thoughts had followed some such course as this, for the
first thing he said as they stood on the edge of the cliff was&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'd like to be in England!"</p>

<p>Rachel lay down on her elbow, and parted the tall grasses which
grew on the edge, so that she might have a clear view. The water
was very calm; rocking up and down at the base of the cliff, and
so clear that one could see the red of the stones at the bottom
of it. So it had been at the birth of the world, and so it had
remained ever since. Probably no human being had ever broken that
water with boat or with body. Obeying some impulse, she determined
to mar that eternity of peace, and threw the largest pebble she
could find. It struck the water, and the ripples spread out and
out. Hewet looked down too.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," he said, as they widened and ceased. The freshness
and the newness seemed to him wonderful. He threw a pebble next.
There was scarcely any sound.</p>

<p>"But England," Rachel murmured in the absorbed tone of one whose
eyes are concentrated upon some sight. "What d'you want with England?"</p>

<p>"My friends chiefly," he said, "and all the things one does."</p>

<p>He could look at Rachel without her noticing it. She was still
absorbed in the water and the exquisitely pleasant sensations
which a little depth of the sea washing over rocks suggests. He
noticed that she was wearing a dress of deep blue colour, made
of a soft thin cotton stuff, which clung to the shape of her body.
It was a body with the angles and hollows of a young woman's body
not yet developed, but in no way distorted, and thus interesting
and even lovable. Raising his eyes Hewet observed her head; she
had taken her hat off, and the face rested on her hand. As she
looked down into the sea, her lips were slightly parted. The expression
was one of childlike intentness, as if she were watching for a
fish to swim past over the clear red rocks. Nevertheless her twenty-four
years of life had given her a look of reserve. Her hand, which
lay on the ground, the fingers curling slightly in, was well shaped
and competent; the square-tipped and nervous fingers were the
fingers of a musician. With something like anguish Hewet realised
that, far from being unattractive, her body was very attractive
to him. She looked up suddenly. Her eyes were full of eagerness
and interest.</p>

<p>"You write novels?" she asked.</p>

<p>For the moment he could not think what he was saying. He was
overcome with the desire to hold her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," he said. "That is, I want to write them."</p>

<p>She would not take her large grey eyes off his face.</p>

<p>"Novels," she repeated. "Why do you write novels? You ought to
write music. Music, you see"&mdash;she shifted her eyes, and became
less desirable as her brain began to work, inflicting a certain
change upon her face&mdash;"music goes straight for things. It says
all there is to say at once. With writing it seems to me there's
so much"&mdash;she paused for an expression, and rubbed her fingers
in the earth&mdash;"scratching on the matchbox. Most of the time when
I was reading Gibbon this afternoon I was horribly, oh infernally,
damnably bored!" She gave a shake of laughter, looking at Hewet,
who laughed too.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shan't lend you books," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Why is it," Rachel continued, "that I can laugh at Mr. Hirst
to you, but not to his face? At tea I was completely overwhelmed,
not by his ugliness&mdash;by his mind." She enclosed a circle in the
air with her hands. She realised with a great sense of comfort
who easily she could talk to Hewet, those thorns or ragged corners
which tear the surface of some relationships being smoothed away.</p>

<p>"So I observed," said Hewet. "That's a thing that never ceases
to amaze me." He had recovered his composure to such an extent
that he could light and smoke a cigarette, and feeling her ease,
became happy and easy himself.</p>

<p>"The respect that women, even well-educated, very able women,
have for men," he went on. "I believe we must have the sort of
power over you that we're said to have over horses. They see us
three times as big as we are or they'd never obey us. For that
very reason, I'm inclined to doubt that you'll ever do anything
even when you have the vote." He looked at her reflectively. She
appeared very smooth and sensitive and young. "It'll take at least
six generations before you're sufficiently thick-skinned to go
into law courts and business offices. Consider what a bully the
ordinary man is," he continued, "the ordinary hard-working, rather
ambitious solicitor or man of business with a family to bring
up and a certain position to maintain. And then, of course, the
daughters have to give way to the sons; the sons have to be educated;
they have to bully and shove for their wives and families, and
so it all comes over again. And meanwhile there are the women
in the background. . . . Do you really think that the vote will
do you any good?"</p>

<p>"The vote?" Rachel repeated. She had to visualise it as a little
bit of paper which she dropped into a box before she understood
his question, and looking at each other they smiled at something
absurd in the question.</p>

<p>"Not to me," she said. "But I play the piano. . . . Are men really
like that?" she asked, returning to the question that interested
her. "I'm not afraid of you." She looked at him easily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm different," Hewet replied. "I've got between six and
seven hundred a year of my own. And then no one takes a novelist
seriously, thank heavens. There's no doubt it helps to make up
for the drudgery of a profession if a man's taken very, very seriously
by every one&mdash;if he gets appointments, and has offices and a title,
and lots of letters after his name, and bits of ribbon and degrees.
I don't grudge it 'em, though sometimes it comes over me&mdash;what
an amazing concoction! What a miracle the masculine conception
of life is&mdash;judges, civil servants, army, navy, Houses of Parliament,
lord mayors&mdash;what a world we've made of it! Look at Hirst now.
I assure you," he said, "not a day's passed since we came here
without a discussion as to whether he's to stay on at Cambridge
or to go to the Bar. It's his career&mdash;his sacred career. And if
I've heard it twenty times, I'm sure his mother and sister have
heard it five hundred times. Can't you imagine the family conclaves,
and the sister told to run out and feed the rabbits because St.
John must have the school-room to himself&mdash;'St. John's working,'
'St. John wants his tea brought to him.' Don't you know the kind
of thing? No wonder that St. John thinks it a matter of considerable
importance. It is too. He has to earn his living. But St. John's
sister&mdash;" Hewet puffed in silence. "No one takes her seriously,
poor dear. She feeds the rabbits."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rachel. "I've fed rabbits for twenty-four years;
it seems odd now." She looked meditative, and Hewet, who had been
talking much at random and instinctively adopting the feminine
point of view, saw that she would now talk about herself, which
was what he wanted, for so they might come to know each other.</p>

<p>She looked back meditatively upon her past life.</p>

<p>"How do you spend your day?" he asked.</p>

<p>She meditated still. When she thought of their day it seemed
to her it was cut into four pieces by their meals. These divisions
were absolutely rigid, the contents of the day having to accommodate
themselves within the four rigid bars. Looking back at her life,
that was what she saw.</p>

<p>"Breakfast nine; luncheon one; tea five; dinner eight," she said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hewet, "what d'you do in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I need to play the piano for hours and hours."</p>

<p>"And after luncheon?"</p>

<p>"Then I went shopping with one of my aunts. Or we went to see
some one, or we took a message; or we did something that had to
be done&mdash;the taps might be leaking. They visit the poor a good
deal&mdash;old char-women with bad legs, women who want tickets for
hospitals. Or I used to walk in the park by myself. And after
tea people sometimes called; or in summer we sat in the garden
or played croquet; in winter I read aloud, while they worked;
after dinner I played the piano and they wrote letters. If father
was at home we had friends of his to dinner, and about once a
month we went up to the play. Every now and then we dined out;
sometimes I went to a dance in London, but that was difficult
because of getting back. The people we saw were old family friends,
and relations, but we didn't see many people. There was the clergyman,
Mr. Pepper, and the Hunts. Father generally wanted to be quiet
when he came home, because he works very hard at Hull. Also my
aunts aren't very strong. A house takes up a lot of time if you
do it properly. Our servants were always bad, and so Aunt Lucy
used to do a good deal in the kitchen, and Aunt Clara, I think,
spent most of the morning dusting the drawing-room and going through
the linen and silver. Then there were the dogs. They had to be
exercised, besides being washed and brushed. Now Sandy's dead,
but Aunt Clara has a very old cockatoo that came from India. Everything
in our house," she exclaimed, "comes from somewhere! It's full
of old furniture, not really old, Victorian, things mother's family
had or father's family had, which they didn't like to get rid
of, I suppose, though we've really no room for them. It's rather
a nice house," she continued, "except that it's a little dingy&mdash;dull
I should say." She called up before her eyes a vision of the drawing-room
at home; it was a large oblong room, with a square window opening
on the garden. Green plush chairs stood against the wall; there
was a heavy carved book-case, with glass doors, and a general
impression of faded sofa covers, large spaces of pale green, and
baskets with pieces of wool-work dropping out of them. Photographs
from old Italian masterpieces hung on the walls, and views of
Venetian bridges and Swedish waterfalls which members of the family
had seen years ago. There were also one or two portraits of fathers
and grandmothers, and an engraving of John Stuart Mill, after
the picture by Watts. It was a room without definite character,
being neither typically and openly hideous, nor strenuously artistic,
nor really comfortable. Rachel roused herself from the contemplation
of this familiar picture.</p>

<p>"But this isn't very interesting for you," she said, looking
up.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Hewet exclaimed. "I've never been so much interested
in my life." She then realised that while she had been thinking
of Richmond, his eyes had never left her face. The knowledge of
this excited her.</p>

<p>"Go on, please go on," he urged. "Let's imagine it's a Wednesday.
You're all at luncheon. You sit there, and Aunt Lucy there, and
Aunt Clara here"; he arranged three pebbles on the grass between
them.</p>

<p>"Aunt Clara carves the neck of lamb," Rachel continued. She fixed
her gaze upon the pebbles. "There's a very ugly yellow china stand
in front of me, called a dumb waiter, on which are three dishes,
one for biscuits, one for butter, and one for cheese. There's
a pot of ferns. Then there's Blanche the maid, who snuffles because
of her nose. We talk&mdash;oh yes, it's Aunt Lucy's afternoon at Walworth,
so we're rather quick over luncheon. She goes off. She has a purple
bag, and a black notebook. Aunt Clara has what they call a <em>G.F.S.
</em>meeting in the drawing-room on Wednesday, so I take the dogs
out. I go up Richmond Hill, along the terrace, into the park.
It's the 18th of April&mdash;the same day as it is here. It's spring
in England. The ground is rather damp. However, I cross the road
and get on to the grass and we walk along, and I sing as I always
do when I'm alone, until we come to the open place where you can
see the whole of London beneath you on a clear day. Hampstead
Church spire there, Westminster Cathedral over there, and factory
chimneys about here. There's generally a haze over the low parts
of London; but it's often blue over the park when London's in
a mist. It's the open place that the balloons cross going over
to Hurlingham. They're pale yellow. Well, then, it smells very
good, particularly if they happen to be burning wood in the keeper's
lodge which is there. I could tell you now how to get from place
to place, and exactly what trees you'd pass, and where you'd cross
the roads. You see, I played there when I was small. Spring is
good, but it's best in the autumn when the deer are barking; then
it gets dusky, and I go back through the streets, and you can't
see people properly; they come past very quick, you just see their
faces and then they're gone&mdash;that's what I like&mdash;and no one knows
in the least what you're doing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you have to be back for tea, I suppose?" Hewet checked her.</p>

<p>"Tea? Oh yes. Five o'clock. Then I say what I've done, and my
aunts say what they've done, and perhaps some one comes in: Mrs.
Hunt, let's suppose. She's an old lady with a lame leg. She has
or she once had eight children; so we ask after them. They're
all over the world; so we ask where they are, and sometimes they're
ill, or they're stationed in a cholera district, or in some place
where it only rains once in five months. Mrs. Hunt," she said
with a smile, "had a son who was hugged to death by a bear."</p>

<p>Here she stopped and looked at Hewet to see whether he was amused
by the same things that amused her. She was reassured. But she
thought it necessary to apologise again; she had been talking
too much.</p>

<p>"You can't conceive how it interests me," he said. Indeed, his
cigarette had gone out, and he had to light another.</p>

<p>"Why does it interest you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Partly because you're a woman," he replied. When he said this,
Rachel, who had become oblivious of anything, and had reverted
to a childlike state of interest and pleasure, lost her freedom
and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and
under observation, as she felt with St. John Hirst. She was about
to launch into an argument which would have made them both feel
bitterly against each other, and to define sensations which had
no such importance as words were bound to give them when Hewet
led her thoughts in a different direction.</p>

<p>"I've often walked along the streets where people live all in
a row, and one house is exactly like another house, and wondered
what on earth the women were doing inside," he said. "Just consider:
it's the beginning of the twentieth century, and until a few years
ago no woman had ever come out by herself and said things at all.
There it was going on in the background, for all those thousands
of years, this curious silent unrepresented life. Of course we're
always writing about women&mdash;abusing them, or jeering at them,
or worshipping them; but it's never come from women themselves.
I believe we still don't know in the least how they live, or what
they feel, or what they do precisely. If one's a man, the only
confidences one gets are from young women about their love affairs.
But the lives of women of forty, of unmarried women, of working
women, of women who keep shops and bring up children, of women
like your aunts or Mrs. Thornbury or Miss Allan&mdash;one knows nothing
whatever about them. They won't tell you. Either they're afraid,
or they've got a way of treating men. It's the man's view that's
represented, you see. Think of a railway train: fifteen carriages
for men who want to smoke. Doesn't it make your blood boil? If
I were a woman I'd blow some one's brains out. Don't you laugh
at us a great deal? Don't you think it all a great humbug? You,
I mean&mdash;how does it all strike you?"</p>

<p>His determination to know, while it gave meaning to their talk,
hampered her; he seemed to press further and further, and made
it appear so important. She took some time to answer, and during
that time she went over and over the course of her twenty-four
years, lighting now on one point, now on another&mdash;on her aunts,
her mother, her father, and at last her mind fixed upon her aunts
and her father, and she tried to describe them as at this distance
they appeared to her.</p>

<p>They were very much afraid of her father. He was a great dim
force in the house, by means of which they held on to the great
world which is represented every morning in the <em>Times</em>.
But the real life of the house was something quite different from
this. It went on independently of Mr. Vinrace, and tended to hide
itself from him. He was good-humoured towards them, but contemptuous.
She had always taken it for granted that his point of view was
just, and founded upon an ideal scale of things where the life
of one person was absolutely more important than the life of another,
and that in that scale they were much less importance than he
was. But did she really believe that? Hewet's words made her think.
She always submitted to her father, just as they did, but it was
her aunts who influenced her really; her aunts who built up the
fine, closely woven substance of their life at home. They were
less splendid but more natural than her father was. All her rages
had been against them; it was their world with its four meals,
its punctuality, and servants on the stairs at half-past ten,
that she examined so closely and wanted so vehemently to smash
to atoms. Following these thoughts she looked up and said:</p>

<p>"And there's a sort of beauty in it&mdash;there they are at Richmond
at this very moment building things up. They're all wrong, perhaps,
but there's a sort of beauty in it," she repeated. "It's so unconscious,
so modest. And yet they feel things. They do mind if people die.
Old spinsters are always doing things. I don't quite know what
they do. Only that was what I felt when I lived with them. It
was very real."</p>

<p>She reviewed their little journeys to and fro, to Walworth, to
charwomen with bad legs, to meetings for this and that, their
minute acts of charity and unselfishness which flowered punctually
from a definite view of what they ought to do, their friendships,
their tastes and habits; she saw all these things like grains
of sand falling, falling through innumerable days, making an atmosphere
and building up a solid mass, a background. Hewet observed her
as she considered this.</p>

<p>"Were you happy?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Again she had become absorbed in something else, and he called
her back to an unusually vivid consciousness of herself.</p>

<p>"I was both," she replied. "I was happy and I was miserable.
You've no conception what it's like&mdash;to be a young woman." She
looked straight at him. "There are terrors and agonies," she said,
keeping her eye on him as if to detect the slightest hint of laughter.</p>

<p>"I can believe it," he said. He returned her look with perfect
sincerity.</p>

<p>"Women one sees in the streets," she said.</p>

<p>"Prostitutes?"</p>

<p>"Men kissing one."</p>

<p>He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"You were never told?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"And then," she began and stopped. Here came in the great space
of life into which no one had ever penetrated. All that she had
been saying about her father and her aunts and walks in Richmond
Park, and what they did from hour to hour, was merely on the surface.
Hewet was watching her. Did he demand that she should describe
that also? Why did he sit so near and keep his eye on her? Why
did they not have done with this searching and agony? Why did
they not kiss each other simply? She wished to kiss him. But all
the time she went on spinning out words.</p>

<p>"A girl is more lonely than a boy. No one cares in the least
what she does. Nothing's expected of her. Unless one's very pretty
people don't listen to what you say. . . . And that is what I
like," she added energetically, as if the memory were very happy.
"I like walking in Richmond Park and singing to myself and knowing
it doesn't matter a damn to anybody. I like seeing things go on&mdash;as
we saw you that night when you didn't see us &mdash;I love the
freedom of it&mdash;it's like being the wind or the sea." She turned
with a curious fling of her hands and looked at the sea. It was
still very blue, dancing away as far as the eye could reach, but
the light on it was yellower, and the clouds were turning flamingo
red.</p>

<p>A feeling of intense depression crossed Hewet's mind as she spoke.
It seemed plain that she would never care for one person rather
than another; she was evidently quite indifferent to him; they
seemed to come very near, and then they were as far apart as ever
again; and her gesture as she turned away had been oddly beautiful.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said abruptly. "You like people. You like admiration.
Your real grudge against Hirst is that he doesn't admire you."</p>

<p>She made no answer for some time. Then she said:</p>

<p>"That's probably true. Of course I like people &mdash;I like
almost every one I've ever met."</p>

<p>She turned her back on the sea and regarded Hewet with friendly
if critical eyes. He was good-looking in the sense that he had
always had a sufficiency of beef to eat and fresh air to breathe.
His head was big; the eyes were also large; though generally vague
they could be forcible; and the lips were sensitive. One might
account him a man of considerable passion and fitful energy, likely
to be at the mercy of moods which had little relation to facts;
at once tolerant and fastidious. The breadth of his forehead showed
capacity for thought. The interest with which Rachel looked at
him was heard in her voice.</p>

<p>"What novels do you write?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I want to write a novel about Silence," he said; "the things
people don't say. But the difficulty is immense." He sighed. "However,
you don't care," he continued. He looked at her almost severely.
"Nobody cares. All you read a novel for is to see what sort of
person the writer is, and, if you know him, which of his friends
he's put in. As for the novel itself, the whole conception, the
way one's seen the thing, felt about it, make it stand in relation
to other things, not one in a million cares for that. And yet
I sometimes wonder whether there's anything else in the whole
world worth doing. These other people," he indicated the hotel,
"are always wanting something they can't get. But there's an extraordinary
satisfaction in writing, even in the attempt to write. What you
said just now is true: one doesn't want to be things; one wants
merely to be allowed to see them."</p>

<p>Some of the satisfaction of which he spoke came into his face
as he gazed out to sea.</p>

<p>It was Rachel's turn now to feel depressed. As he talked of writing
he had become suddenly impersonal. He might never care for any
one; all that desire to know her and get at her, which she had
felt pressing on her almost painfully, had completely vanished.</p>

<p>"Are you a good writer?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I'm not first-rate, of course; I'm good second-rate;
about as good as Thackeray, I should say."</p>

<p>Rachel was amazed. For one thing it amazed her to hear Thackeray
called second-rate; and then she could not widen her point of
view to believe that there could be great writers in existence
at the present day, or if there were, that any one she knew could
be a great writer, and his self-confidence astounded her, and
he became more and more remote.</p>

<p>"My other novel," Hewet continued, "is about a young man who
is obsessed by an idea&mdash;the idea of being a gentleman. He manages
to exist at Cambridge on a hundred pounds a year. He has a coat;
it was once a very good coat. But the trousers&mdash;they're not so
good. Well, he goes up to London, gets into good society, owing
to an early-morning adventure on the banks of the Serpentine.
He is led into telling lies&mdash;my idea, you see, is to show the
gradual corruption of the soul&mdash;calls himself the son of some
great landed proprietor in Devonshire. Meanwhile the coat becomes
older and older, and he hardly dares to wear the trousers. Can't
you imagine the wretched man, after some splendid evening of debauchery,
contemplating these garments&mdash;hanging them over the end of the
bed, arranging them now in full light, now in shade, and wondering
whether they will survive him, or he will survive them? Thoughts
of suicide cross his mind. He has a friend, too, a man who somehow
subsists upon selling small birds, for which he sets traps in
the fields near Uxbridge. They're scholars, both of them. I know
one or two wretched starving creatures like that who quote Aristotle
at you over a fried herring and a pint of porter. Fashionable
life, too, I have to represent at some length, in order to show
my hero under all circumstances. Lady Theo Bingham Bingley, whose
bay mare he had the good fortune to stop, is the daughter of a
very fine old Tory peer. I'm going to describe the kind of parties
I once went to&mdash;the fashionable intellectuals, you know, who like
to have the latest book on their tables. They give parties, river
parties, parties where you play games. There's no difficulty in
conceiving incidents; the difficulty is to put them into shape&mdash;not
to get run away with, as Lady Theo was. It ended disastrously
for her, poor woman, for the book, as I planned it, was going
to end in profound and sordid respectability. Disowned by her
father, she marries my hero, and they live in a snug little villa
outside Croydon, in which town he is set up as a house agent.
He never succeeds in becoming a real gentleman after all. That's
the interesting part of it. Does it seem to you the kind of book
you'd like to read?" he enquired; "or perhaps you'd like my Stuart
tragedy better," he continued, without waiting for her to answer
him. "My idea is that there's a certain quality of beauty in the
past, which the ordinary historical novelist completely ruins
by his absurd conventions. The moon becomes the Regent of the
Skies. People clap spurs to their horses, and so on. I'm going
to treat people as though they were exactly the same as we are.
The advantage is that, detached from modern conditions, one can
make them more intense and more abstract then people who live
as we do."</p>

<p>Rachel had listened to all this with attention, but with a certain
amount of bewilderment. They both sat thinking their own thoughts.</p>

<p>"I'm not like Hirst," said Hewet, after a pause; he spoke meditatively;
"I don't see circles of chalk between people's feet. I sometimes
wish I did. It seems to me so tremendously complicated and confused.
One can't come to any decision at all; one's less and less capable
of making judgments. D'you find that? And then one never knows
what any one feels. We're all in the dark. We try to find out,
but can you imagine anything more ludicrous than one person's
opinion of another person? One goes along thinking one knows;
but one really doesn't know."</p>

<p>As he said this he was leaning on his elbow arranging and rearranging
in the grass the stones which had represented Rachel and her aunts
at luncheon. He was speaking as much to himself as to Rachel.
He was reasoning against the desire, which had returned with intensity,
to take her in his arms; to have done with indirectness; to explain
exactly what he felt. What he said was against his belief; all
the things that were important about her he knew; he felt them
in the air around them; but he said nothing; he went on arranging
the stones.</p>

<p>"I like you; d'you like me?" Rachel suddenly observed.</p>

<p>"I like you immensely," Hewet replied, speaking with the relief
of a person who is unexpectedly given an opportunity of saying
what he wants to say. He stopped moving the pebbles.</p>

<p>"Mightn't we call each other Rachel and Terence?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Terence," Rachel repeated. "Terence&mdash;that's like the cry of
an owl."</p>

<p>She looked up with a sudden rush of delight, and in looking at
Terence with eyes widened by pleasure she was struck by the change
that had come over the sky behind them. The substantial blue day
had faded to a paler and more ethereal blue; the clouds were pink,
far away and closely packed together; and the peace of evening
had replaced the heat of the southern afternoon, in which they
had started on their walk.</p>

<p>"It must be late!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"But eight o'clock doesn't count here, does it?" Terence asked,
as they got up and turned inland again. They began to walk rather
quickly down the hill on a little path between the olive trees.</p>

<p>They felt more intimate because they shared the knowledge of
what eight o'clock in Richmond meant. Terence walked in front,
for there was not room for them side by side.</p>

<p>"What I want to do in writing novels is very much what you want
to do when you play the piano, I expect," he began, turning and
speaking over his shoulder. "We want to find out what's behind
things, don't we? &mdash;Look at the lights down there," he continued,
"scattered about anyhow. Things I feel come to me like lights.
. . . I want to combine them. . . . Have you ever seen fireworks
that make figures? . . . I want to make figures. . . . Is that
what you want to do?"</p>

<p>Now they were out on the road and could walk side by side.</p>

<p>"When I play the piano? Music is different. . . . But I see what
you mean." They tried to invent theories and to make their theories
agree. As Hewet had no knowledge of music, Rachel took his stick
and drew figures in the thin white dust to explain how Bach wrote
his fugues.</p>

<p>"My musical gift was ruined," he explained, as they walked on
after one of these demonstrations, "by the village organist at
home, who had invented a system of notation which he tried to
teach me, with the result that I never got to the tune-playing
at all. My mother thought music wasn't manly for boys; she wanted
me to kill rats and birds&mdash;that's the worst of living in the country.
We live in Devonshire. It's the loveliest place in the world.
Only&mdash;it's always difficult at home when one's grown up. I'd like
you to know one of my sisters. . . . Oh, here's your gate&mdash;" He
pushed it open. They paused for a moment. She could not ask him
to come in. She could not say that she hoped they would meet again;
there was nothing to be said, and so without a word she went through
the gate, and was soon invisible. Directly Hewet lost sight of
her, he felt the old discomfort return, even more strongly than
before. Their talk had been interrupted in the middle, just as
he was beginning to say the things he wanted to say. After all,
what had they been able to say? He ran his mind over the things
they had said, the random, unnecessary things which had eddied
round and round and used up all the time, and drawn them so close
together and flung them so far apart, and left him in the end
unsatisfied, ignorant still of what she felt and of what she was
like. What was the use of talking, talking, merely talking?</p>
