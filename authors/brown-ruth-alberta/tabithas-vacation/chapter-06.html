<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There was a glorious moon that night, and as the girls were washing
the supper dishes, Tabitha proposed, "Let's go up to the peak
when we are through here and watch the moon rise."</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence in the room.  Usually the
two inexperienced young housekeepers sought to hustle their restless,
boisterous brood into bed as soon as the evening meal had ended
and the night's chores were done.  What had come over her to suggest
such a thing as an evening stroll, or climb, as it would be if
they went up to the peak?  Susie looked at Tabitha with incredulous
eyes, then glanced questioningly at Mercedes, but the older sister
was as much mystified as were the rest.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, or are you joking?" demanded Irene bluntly.</p>

<p>"I mean it," replied Tabitha calmly, though her face flushed
uncomfortably under the surprised stare of eight pair of eyes.</p>

<p>"You usually chase us off to bed, you know," said Susie, still
wondering what the unexpected proposal meant.</p>

<p>"Well, it is such a lovely night, I thought it would be fun to
follow the trail to the top of the mountain, and watch the moon
come up."</p>

<p>"And tell stories?" breathed Irene, clasping her hands ecstatically.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you wish," laughed the senior housekeeper.</p>

<p>"And speak pieces!" cried Mercedes, who was never tired of hearing
Tabitha recite.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"And sing songs," suggested Rosslyn, who loved to listen to Gloriana's
rich, sweet voice carolling joyous lays or softly crooning lullabyes.</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"And build a bonfire to roast&mdash;" began Billiard, but paused,
remembering that it was too early for green corn yet, and not
being able to think of anything else roastable.</p>

<p>"Mosquitoes," finished Toady mischievously.</p>

<p>But Tabitha's face clouded anxiously.  "I am afraid we'll have
to let the bonfire go this time," she said gravely.  "There is
a law against such things here in Silver Bow.  A fire is such
a hard thing to fight on the desert, supposing it once gets started;
so no one takes any risks."</p>

<p>Toady's face fell and Billiard looked rebellious, seeing which,
Tabitha hastily continued, "Some day we will go down to the river<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, and have a picnic!" squealed Susie, giving such an eager
little hop of anticipation that the cup she was drying flew out
of her hand and half-way across the room, falling with a dull
thud in a pan of bread sponge which Tabitha had just been mixing.</p>

<p>"My!" breathed Irene enviously, "I wish my dishes would do that! 
When <em>I</em> drop one it always bu'sts."</p>

<p>Her peculiar grievance, coupled with Susie's look of utter amazement
at the performance of her cup, caused a merry laugh all around,
and the subject of bonfire was speedily forgotten, to Tabitha's
unbounded relief.</p>

<p>The dishes were soon washed and piled away in the cupboard, the
evening chores completed, and the troop of eager children romped
gaily up the rocky trail to the summit of the mountain, on which
the Eagles' Nest was built.  It was just such a night as Tabitha
loved, and she would gladly have sat in silence the whole evening
through, watching the barren landscape lying glorified in the
white moonlight; but not so with the younger members of the party. 
To be sure, it was a pretty picture that the old moon revealed
to their eyes, but even the most beautiful pictures cannot hold
a child's attention long.  It is excitement that they desire;
so scarcely had the party reached their goal than Inez demanded
imperiously, "Now Tabitha, speak something for us."</p>

<p>"Oh, not right away," protested the older girl, glancing wistfully
about her at the beauties of the night, and longing for a few
moments of solitude that she might enjoy herself in her own peculiar
fashion. "Let's watch the moon come up."</p>

<p>"No," clamored the boys, who had heard Tabitha's many talents
lauded by their cousins until their curiosity had well-nigh reached
the bursting point.  "Speak right away.  It's no fun watching
the old moon come up! Besides, it's high enough now to make things
as plain as day."</p>

<p>"Suppose you recite something first, then," suggested Gloriana,
noting the wistfulness in the big, black eyes of her new sister.</p>

<p>"Not on your tin-type!" Billiard emphatically declared.  "It's
ladies first, you know!  We want Tabitha to spiel."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what shall it be?" sighed that young lady resignedly.</p>

<p>"Something with ginger in it," was Toady's prompt reply.  "Not
a sissy-girl piece."</p>

<p>"About a battle or a prize-fight," suggested Billiard with amusing
impartiality.</p>

<p>"<em>Barbara Fritchie</em>," put in eager Irene.</p>

<p>"No, don't," cried Susie.  "We've heard that so often.  Speak
<em>Sheridan's Ride</em>."</p>

<p>"Or <em>Driving Home the Cows</em>," suggested Mercedes.  "I
think that is so pretty, and it is a war piece, too."</p>

<p>"But it is too sad," promptly vetoed Susie.  "We want something&mdash;noisy."</p>

<p>"With cannons and guns," seconded the boys.</p>

<p>So Tabitha obligingly recited the thrilling lines:</p>

<p>  "'Up from the South at break of day,   Bringing to Winchester
fresh dismay,   The affrighted air with a shudder bore,   Like
a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door,   The terrible grumble,
and rumble, and roar,   Telling the battle was on once more,  
And Sheridan twenty miles away.'"</p>

<p>And her thoughts flew back to that black day in the dingy old
town hall, when she had declaimed those very lines, and of the
dire punishment which had overtaken her; but the sting of it was
all gone now, and she found herself smiling at the recollection
of that fateful encore.  Everything was so different these days. 
She could afford to forget the old heartaches and longings in
the happiness which had come to her during the past year.</p>

<p>  "'Here is the steed that saved the day   By carrying Sheridan
into the fight,   From Winchester, twenty miles away!'"</p>

<p>she finished; and before the enthusiastic audience realized that
the recitation was ended, she began <em>Horatius at the Bridge</em>. 
Then followed in quick succession all the thrilling wartime pieces
at her tongue's command, while the delighted children held their
breath in wondering admiration.</p>

<p>Breathless at length, she paused, and surveying the circle of
faces about her, said whimsically, "That's a plenty, I reckon. 
My throat is as dry as the desert!"</p>

<p>"Just one more!" they pleaded eagerly.</p>

<p>"But I have spoken all I can think of now with guns and cannons
in them."</p>

<p>"Then give us a different kind," wheedled Irene, in her most
persuasive tones.</p>

<p>"That one you spoke May Day at Ivy Hall," suggested Mercedes,
"when you tumbled off the platform."</p>

<p>"Tumbled off the platform?" echoed the boys in great surprise. 
This was an adventure which had never been recounted to them. 
"How did she tumble off the platform?  Tell us about it."</p>

<p>Tabitha merely laughed and shook her head, but Mercedes, elated
at the opportunity of singing the praises of her idol, regaled
them with a laughable description of Tabitha's mishap.  This led
to other boarding school reminiscences,&mdash;the christening of the
vessel, when Cassandra took her memorable plunge into the ocean;
the night of the opera and their experiences with the runaway
ostriches; the voice of the mysterious singer in the bell-tower,
which some of the more timid students had mistaken for a ghost;
and finally, the appearance of the Ivy Hall ghost itself.  The
McKittrick girls had heard all these events recounted so often
that they knew them almost by heart; but, nevertheless, they were
never tired of listening, and drank in the stories of all those
delightful mishaps with almost as much eagerness as was displayed
by Billiard and Toady, hearing them for the first time.</p>

<p>But all frolics come to an end, and Tabitha at length roused
with a start to announce, "That clock struck ten, I am positive."</p>

<p>"What clock?"</p>

<p>"Yours.  The one in the kitchen.  We were unusually quiet, I
reckon, for I was able to count ten strokes.  We must fly into
bed as fast as we can get there.  I had no idea it was so late,
although Janie and Rosslyn have been snoozing for ages.  Come
on, let's march.  See who can get to the house first."</p>

<p>Away they scampered as hard as they could run down the rough
path, while Tabitha and Glory wrestled with the two little sleepers,
trying to rouse them from their slumber so they might walk down
to the cottage instead of having to be carried.  But Rosslyn refused
to waken thoroughly, and created such a scene that it was some
minutes before they could coax him to follow them down the trail. 
So when they entered the moonlit kitchen, leading the stumbling
boy and carrying Janie, who could not keep her eyes open or her
feet under her, the rest of the family had vanished completely.</p>

<p>"Can they be in bed already?" asked Tabitha in surprise.  "Have
we been wrestling with those children so long?"</p>

<p>Gloriana tiptoed across the floor and opened the door to the
room where the four sisters slept, and disclosed four flushed
faces peacefully reposing on their pillows.  Mercedes and Irene
were already fast asleep, and the other two so near the land of
Nod that their eyes merely fluttered open for an instant at the
sound of the opening door, and then drowsily fell again.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Gloriana turned to Tabitha, busy trying to slip Rosslyn's
nightgown over his limp body, and whispered, "All serene!"</p>

<p>"Then skip off to bed," said the other girl.  "I will bring Janie
when I come."</p>

<p>"But<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is just the bread.  I want to knead it down once more. 
It won't take me half a jiffy, but if I don't do it now, it will
be all over the floor by morning."</p>

<p>So Gloriana crept wearily away to her room, for it had been a
long, hard, disappointing day, but a moment later she scurried
back into the kitchen; and when Tabitha wheeled about in surprise
at her hasty entrance, she laughed nervously, half apologetically,
"I kicked someone's shoes under the bed!  Don't know whether they
are my own or a burglar's!"</p>

<p>Knowing how timid the red-haired girl still felt on the desert
at night, Tabitha refrained from smiling at what seemed an uncalled-for
fright, and said reassuringly, "No burglars ever visit Silver
Bow. There is nothing in a miner's shack to tempt them."</p>

<p>"I should think there would be plenty of gold nuggets," answered
Gloriana in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not many in Silver Bow houses, I reckon," Tabitha placidly replied,
"But if you are afraid to go to bed alone, you better wait for
me. I'll be ready in a minute."</p>

<p>She did not mean to speak scornfully, for she sympathized heartily
with the sensitive gain remembering with what horror the desert
nights used to fill her when Silver Bow first became her home. 
But Gloriana thought she detected a hint of ridicule in her companion's
voice, and hurriedly departed for their room once more, saying
with a great show of bravado, "Oh, I'm not afraid!  Come to think
of it, I believe I left my slippers at the foot of the bed, and
that is probably what I hit."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her again, and Tabitha, smiling sympathetically
at the girl's attempt at bravery, began to cover the mound of
soft, white dough in the huge pan, when a wild, unearthly shriek
echoed through the house, followed by the sharp crack of a pistol,
and the muffled fall of a body.</p>

<p>For one brief instant Tabitha stood rooted to the spot, fairly
paralyzed with horror.  Then the thought of Glory gave wings to
her feet, and, heedless of her own danger, she flew for the scene
of disaster, whispering to herself, "Oh, why did I leave the house
unlocked all the evening while we were gone?"</p>

<p>As the door of her room swung back on its hinges, the first thing
her eyes fell upon was the flickering, smoking, chimneyless lamp
standing on the low dresser; and even in her terror she wondered
how it chanced that careful Glory had neglected to protect the
light properly.  The next object that met her gaze was Glory herself,
leaning white and limp against the closet door, holding a battered,
smoking pistol at arm's length from her.</p>

<p>"Glory, are you hurt?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"But the gun&mdash;the shot<hr>"</p>

<p>"No one's shot&mdash;only the lamp chimney!  I aimed at the&mdash;the burglars
under the bed, and shot off the lamp chimney," she panted, beginning
to laugh hysterically, and tightening her grasp on the rusty gun.</p>

<p>"Where is the burglar?"  Intrepidly she stooped and peered under
the bed, half expecting to see the disturber of their peace still
hiding there.</p>

<p>"In the closet,&mdash;-both of them!"</p>

<p>"Two?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Glory!"</p>

<p>"They are locked in.  Here is the key."</p>

<p>"I must go for the constable."</p>

<p>A scuffling sound suddenly issued from the closet, and Gloriana
cried in terror, "And leave me here alone with them?"</p>

<p>"There is no other way.  I'll be gone but a minute.  They surely
can't get loose in that time!"  And she darted from the room without
giving Gloriana opportunity for further objections.</p>

<p>Hardly had the sound of her racing footsteps died away in the
distance, however, when the red-haired guard, leaning against
the door, half dead with fear, was electrified at hearing a muffled
voice call through the keyhole, "I say, Glory, let us out, do! 
We were just a-foolin'. Didn't you know 'twas us?  Please don't
turn us over to the sheriff!"</p>

<p>"'Twas Tabitha's story about the Ivy Hall ghost that made us
think of it," pleaded Toady.  "We ain't sure-enough burglars. 
We just meant to scare you a little bit."</p>

<p>"And you sure scared <em>us</em> enough to make up," coaxed Billiard. 
"Please let us out before Tabitha gets back.  She said she'd write
Uncle Hogan the next time we got into trouble."</p>

<p>"And that will mean he will take us away from here," wheedled
Toady. "He's awful hard on a fellow."</p>

<p>"You deserve it!" suddenly answered Glory, with a grimness that
startled even the girl herself.</p>

<p>"Then you won't let us out?" cried the boys in great dismay.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I haven't decided yet," Gloriana was forced to admit.</p>

<p>"But Tabitha will be back directly."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's a swift runner.  I don't think she will be gone long."
Glory was beginning to enjoy the strange situation.</p>

<p>"Oh, Glory, don't keep us here, please!  prayed Billiard desperately.</p>

<p>"We'll <em>never</em> play burglar again!" promised repentant
Toady.</p>

<p>"No, it will be something else the next time," said their jailer
heartlessly.</p>

<p>"If you'll just set us free this time, we'll be reg'lar sissy
girls all the rest of the summer," they cried.</p>

<p>"You have promised so many times&mdash;" Glory began wearily.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can hear her coming!" cried Toady, half frantic at thought
of the constable whom Tabitha had gone to summon.</p>

<p>Gloriana thought she could, also, and swiftly turning the key
in the lock, she let the quaking prisoners out, urging them on
with a violent push as they scurried past her, and hissing in
their ears, "Scamper! If you aren't in bed when she gets here,
she'll know you did it."</p>

<p>But they needed no urging.  Their feet scarcely touched the floor,
it seemed to Gloriana, as they made a mad rush for their room;
and when Tabitha returned a moment later, alone, they lay tense
and breathless under the coverlets of the cot.</p>

<p>"Glory!" they heard her ejaculate.  "You let them get away from
you!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," replied the red-haired girl in excited
tones. "Couldn't you get anyone?  Wasn't the constable at home?"</p>

<p>"No, but he'll investigate as soon as<hr>"</p>

<p>The rest of the sentence was lost in the slamming of a door;
but the two culprits lay and quaked with fear long after the rest
of the household was fast asleep, little dreaming that as soon
as the door was tightly closed so they could no longer distinguish
the voices, Glory had wheeled on Tabitha and giggled accusingly,
"You knew all the time!"</p>

<p>"Not until I ran past their door and saw their bed was empty,"
whispered the black-haired girl with her hand over her mouth to
stifle the laughter she could no longer suppress.</p>

<p>"What possessed you to keep on, then?'</p>

<p>"I surmised what would happen, and decided to scare <em>them</em>
a little, too.  So I crept around the house and listened to you
talking with them.  When they thought they heard me coming back,
I concluded it was time I did put in appearance again; but I thought
I'd die laughing to hear them scuttling into bed.  Now I reckon
the score is even!"</p>

<p>"Then you won't tell their Uncle this time?"</p>

<p>"I ought to."</p>

<p>"They've had a big punishment already, Puss."</p>

<p>"They deserve it."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I scared them stiff when I shot."</p>

<p>"Poor girlie, and you were as badly scared yourself.  My brave
Glory!"</p>

<p>"Don't praise me, Kitty.  I'm an awful coward.  My teeth are
chattering yet."</p>

<p>"And you are trembling as if you had the ague.  Are you sure
you're not hurt?  I thought I heard something fall."</p>

<p>"The gun kicked and knocked me over," Gloriana admitted.  "That
is what gave the boys a chance to scramble into the closet.  I
didn't know it was Billiard and Toady then, because the bullet
splintered the lamp chimney and I couldn't see real well."</p>

<p>"But you locked them in."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was easy!  They were holding the door shut with all
their might, and the only thing left to do was to turn the key
in the lock. I am so thankful it was only a prank!"</p>

<p>"So am I," Tabitha admitted grudgingly.  "But I can't say I relish
that class of pranks."</p>

<p>"Give them another chance, Tabitha.  I think they really are
trying to be good."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll&mdash;see.  We'll forget all about it now and go to sleep.
Morning can't be very far off."</p>
