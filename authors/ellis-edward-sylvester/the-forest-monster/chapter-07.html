<p>"I b’lieve I’ll dig out of these parts," said Black Tom, with
a sigh, after he had heard the explanation of Fred Hammond.</p>

<p>"Why so?" quietly asked the latter.</p>

<p>"Things don’t look right to me; I don’t understand ’bout that
speckled critter, nor ’bout the critter I’ve seen on the kenyon
on horseback. I b’lieve <em>she’s</em> a sperit."</p>

<p>"No; she’s as much flesh and blood as you are. I have spoken
to her."</p>

<p>"Have you axed her to dig out of these parts?"</p>

<p>"I have, more than once."</p>

<p>"Why don’t she do it?"</p>

<p>"We’ll let the answer to that question remain in abeyance for
the present," was the graceful response of Hammond. "I think she
will do so, but the time has not yet come for such an important
step to be taken."</p>

<p>"Let me ax you something else, then. Do them Blackfeet where
she’s stayin’ <em>b’long thar</em>?"</p>

<p>"They have lived there a long time, and no doubt expect to remain
there for a long time to come, but they do not belong to the Blackfeet
tribe."</p>

<p>"What tribe, then?"</p>

<p>"They are the Meagans."</p>

<p>"I’ve heard tell of them, years ago, but I thought they war all
dead."</p>

<p>"They were once a powerful tribe, and these are all that are
left of them, scarcely a hundred souls. You know they are <em>Christians</em>."</p>

<p>Black Tom did not know that, nor did he know any thing of them,
except that such a tribe had once been a power in the West, but
he had supposed hitherto that they had vanished from the earth
long since.</p>

<p>"They have been Christianized through the efforts of the good
Moravian missionaries," continued Hammond, "and they live a quiet,
unobtrusive life among themselves, disturbing nobody, and desirous
of being left alone by all who pass through this region."</p>

<p>"What is the gal doing with them?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we drop all reference to her for the present," was the
pleasant reply of his companion; "you are here for the purpose
of hunting gold, and I must warn you not to interfere with the
Meagans."</p>

<p>"We won’t hurt them if they let us alone," was the sturdy reply
of the trapper, "but they must keep thar hands off."</p>

<p>"They won’t be likely to disturb you, although they do not like
the presence of any one in these parts."</p>

<p>"Why don’t they?"</p>

<p>"Because they are aware of the existence of gold, and they know
if that fact becomes generally known, they will have to pack up
and leave."</p>

<p>"Be thar any other white men besides us hyar?"</p>

<p>"Quite a number have passed through, but I don’t think there
are any besides your company."</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet are here sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; their hunting and war parties occasionally pass through,
but they know of the Meagans, respect their character, and never
offer to molest them."</p>

<p>"I see; but how ’bout us?" asked Black Tom, with a grin.</p>

<p>"It ain’t likely they would be so careful about treading on your
corns. Heigho!"</p>

<p>This exclamation on the part of Hammond was caused by the growing
light around them showing that day was breaking. The trapper was
startled somewhat, but he was deeply interested in his new acquaintance,
and continued chatting some time longer. As he was ready to move
away, Tom said:</p>

<p>"See hyar, Hammond, our mansion is down near t’other end the
kenyon, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know very well where it is," interrupted the young man, bowing
slightly and smiling.</p>

<p>"Wal, what I war goin’ to hit at war this: come thar and make
your head-quarters with us. We’re huntin’ gold and you are huntin’
the gal; but we’ve got to do a little sleepin’ now and then, and
why can’t you bunk with us?"</p>

<p>"I thank you, Tom; I may accept your invitation, but not just
at present. However, we will keep up the acquaintance so pleasantly
commenced, and I will call on you now and then."</p>

<p>This was their parting, and making their way out of the bushes,
Black Tom continued on down the cañon, reaching his friends, when
both were quite anxious regarding him.</p>

<p>After telling his story, there was a consultation. All were quite
hungry, and it was agreed that old Stebbins should start off on
a quest for food, and Teddy should keep guard during his absence,
which time Black Tom proposed to devote to sleep.</p>

<p>This arrangement was carried out to the letter. Tom secured two
good hours’ rest, which were all that he needed, Teddy acted faithfully
his part as sentinel, and old Stebbins came back with the hind-quarters
of a young antelope slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Some was broiled over the fire, and the three hunters devoured
it with an appetite that was absolutely wolfish, scarcely speaking
until it was finished, when Tom asked, somewhat bluntly:</p>

<p>"Did you see nothin’ of the speckled and ring-tailed critter?"</p>

<p>"Nothin’, but I see’d sign."</p>

<p>"Blazes! whar?"</p>

<p>"Off yonder."</p>

<p>As he replied he pointed off to the left, which was in a totally
different direction from the one leading toward the Meagan village,
proof that they were hostile Indians.</p>

<p>"Thar’s ’bout a dozen," added old Stebbins. "They’re Blackfeet
in thar war-paint, and they’re goin’ fur somebody."</p>

<p>"Bad ’cess to ’em!" exclaimed Teddy, who had managed to light
his pipe. "Give us the chance and we’ll show ’em a thing or two."</p>

<p>The matter was discussed pro and con, when it was agreed that
the three should separate and take different directions. Each
of the three were to search for gold and Indians. By this means
there was a better prospect of finding the precious metal than
if they went in company, and if danger from the Blackfeet threatened,
there was scarcely a possibility that it would escape the vigilance
of all three.</p>

<p>Old Stebbins took somewhat the same route that he followed in
his morning hunt, his principal purpose being to look out for
Blackfeet. Teddy went up the brook, his object being gold, while
Black Tom, after getting clear of the cañon, diverged to the right,
his purpose being both.</p>

<p>Leaving the two former to themselves for the present, it becomes
necessary once more to follow the adventures of Black Tom.</p>

<p>His course led him across a short space of open prairie, when
he entered a wild section, better fitted for the habitations of
the chamois or mountain goat, than for any other animal.</p>

<p>He was constantly passing around deep chasms, climbing rocks,
clambering through bushes, sometimes leaving the debris and loose
stones rattling behind him, with a noise that was startling, until
he found himself in a small, narrow valley, through which ran
a stream somewhat larger than the one in the cañon that he had
left a short time before.</p>

<p>The trapper carefully surveyed the bluffs and elevated points
surrounding him, but all was as quiet as at "creation’s morn."
Not even the cry of a bird, or the whirr of its wing broke the
impressive stillness of the solitude.</p>

<p>Tom was somewhat affected by the grand solemnity of the scene
around him, and he stood a moment leaning upon his rifle, silent
and thoughtful, swayed by those reverential emotions which, at
times, come over the most ignorant of mankind.</p>

<p>While standing thus with his eyes fixed upon the ascending side
of the valley, he was startled by seeing the loose dirt and stones,
directly beneath a clump of bushes, rattle down the declivity,
as though they had been dislodged by the foot of some person or
animal.</p>

<p>The trapper was on the alert instantly. His eagle eye was fixed
upon the bushes, with the sharp, penetrating glance of suspicion;
but the vegetation was too dense and luxuriant for him to discover
whether there was any thing beneath them or not.</p>

<p>"Wonder ef that was a Blackfoot," he muttered, as he held his
rifle ready for use at a second’s warning. "Some confounded varmint
like as not is follerin’ me. I’ll see ef I can."</p>

<p>Raising his gun to his shoulder, he aimed directly at the center
of the bushes and discharged it. No response followed, not even
the rattling of an additional pebble. All remained as quiet and
motionless as before the disturbance took place.</p>

<p>This almost convinced the trapper that there was no man or animal
concealed there. Even had he not hit him with his bullet, the
shot itself would have caused a movement that would have loosened
the debris again.</p>

<p>"I guess the thing done itself," he concluded, as he reloaded
his piece, and scrutinized a moment or two longer.</p>

<p>As he moved away, he occasionally turned his head and glanced
back, but saw nothing to renew his suspicions, and by the time
he had passed a hundred yards down the valley, he had come to
the opinion that there was but one eye that was surveying his
movements&mdash;and that was the eye that looked upon him in kindness
and mercy, as it does upon all mortals.</p>

<p>Still no signs of gold.</p>

<p>He was now following the course of the stream down the valley.
In some places it brawled over stones, with a noise that shut
out all other sounds, and then it flowed calmly and still, like
the current of a deep river.</p>

<p>It was of crystal clearness, and there was no place where he
could not distinguish the bottom, as easily as though it were
"liquid air" floating at his feet.</p>

<p>"Wonder ef thar’s any use of my wadin’ in thar, turnin’ over
them stones, and lookin’ under them&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused. What did he see?</p>

<p>He looked steadily a moment, and his heart gave a jump, as he
plainly distinguished something yellow glistening in the center
of the bed. The next instant he had plunged into the stream, which
was about a foot in depth, and thrusting his arm down, brought
it to the surface and held it up to view.</p>

<p>Yes; it was a solid lump of pure gold!</p>

<p>Black Tom was certain of it. It was about the size of a hen’s
egg, very heavy, and bright and glistening. There could be no
doubt of its nature.</p>

<p>He waded ashore again, and then "hefted" it, turned it over and
over, tossed it in the air, caught it, smelled of it, put his
tongue to it and was delighted.</p>

<p>Why should he not be delighted? Was not this what had brought
him to this region? Was it not worth more than many days’ labor
of trapping?</p>

<p>"That’s the fust crop!" he exclaimed, as he carefully put it
away about his person; "and it follers that thar must be more
of the same sort ’bout hyar."</p>

<p>The day was quite cool, and he was pretty wet; but he felt it
not. His feelings were excited, and he was tenfold more anxious
for the precious metal than he had ever been before. It seemed
as if there was an all-controlling appetite that had hitherto
been latent, that was now aroused to action, and that overcame
every other emotion.</p>

<p>He thought nothing now of personal danger. Gold, gold, was his
thirst, and it led him on his eager search.</p>

<p>The trapper walked along the edge of the stream, totally oblivious
to every thing but the one thing that just then occupied his thoughts,
to the exclusion of every thing else.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed thus, when he was aroused from this condition
by a sharp voice, calling almost in his very ears:</p>

<p>"Hello there!" Starting back, Tom looked up and saw Fred Hammond
standing a few feet in front of him.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter?" asked the hunter.</p>

<p>"You must get out of here, without a moment’s delay."</p>

<p>"What’s the matter?" exclaimed Tom, staring about him as though
he had just awakened to a sense of his perilous condition.</p>

<p>"The Blackfeet are after you."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere," replied Hammond, somewhat excitedly; "there are
two or three coming up the stream, and several coming down. They
are trying to surround you, and if you remain here five minutes
longer, you are a dead man."</p>

<p>"I ain’t killed quite so easy as that," said Tom, somewhat sullenly.
"Ef thar ar’ any red-skins that ar’ goin’ to make a dead man of
me, jest fetch ’em along; that’s what’s the matter."</p>

<p>"Follow me, and don’t wait an instant," commanded Hammond, fairly
seizing upon him.</p>

<p>Instead of running either up or down-stream, the young man led
the way to the high, steep side of the valley, which was thickly
wooded, and extended full five hundred feet upward from where
they stood.</p>

<p>Up this the two hounded like goats, half crawling and climbing
through the wood and undergrowth, until, panting and almost exhausted,
they reached the high ground above, where they paused awhile to
gain their breath before proceeding further in this dangerous
territory.</p>

<p>They had penetrated such a distance that they were effectually
concealed from the view of whatever Indians there might be in
the valley below, although, of course, the red-skins could easily
follow their trail.</p>

<p>They stood a moment in silence, and then, when they had recovered
their breath, Hammond placed his hand familiarly upon the shoulder
of the trapper, and said, earnestly and kindly:</p>

<p>"Tom, you are an old hunter, and know more of the red-men and
their ways than I do, but that doesn’t signify that you are in
no need of counsel. I was wandering through this section, when
I discovered your danger. It was not the situation of your body,
so much as it was the condition of your mind. You had found gold,
and were so excited over it, that a Blackfoot might have slipped
up behind and tomahawked you. I saw it, and I got you up here,
that you might recover your senses. There is gold down there&mdash;plenty
of it; hunt carefully and you will find, but don’t look down all
the while &mdash;<em>LOOK UP</em>!"</p>
