Day had broken before the several denizens of the
Wilderness had all returned to their homes, the police
finished their inquiries, and all come back to its normal
quiet.  Mrs. Westmacott had been left sleeping peacefully
with a small chloral draught to steady her nerves and a
handkerchief soaked in arnica bound round her head.  It
was with some surprise, therefore, that the Admiral
received a note from her about ten o'clock, asking him to
be good enough to step in to her.  He hurried in, fearing
that she might have taken some turn for the worse, but he
was reassured to find her sitting up in her bed, with
Clara and Ida Walker in attendance upon her.  She had
removed the handkerchief, and had put on a little cap
with pink ribbons, and a maroon dressing-jacket, daintily
fulled at the neck and sleeves.
<P>
"My dear friend," said she as he entered, "I wish to
make a last few remarks to you.  No, no," she continued,
laughing, as she saw a look of dismay upon his face.  "I
shall not dream of dying for at least another thirty
years.  A woman should be ashamed to die before she is
seventy.  I wish, Clara, that you would ask
your father to step up.  And you, Ida, just pass me
my cigarettes, and open me a bottle of stout."
<P>
"Now then," she continued, as the doctor joined their
party.  "I don't quite know what I ought to say to you,
Admiral.  You want some very plain speaking to."
<P>
"'Pon my word, ma'am, I don't know what you are
talking about."
<P>
"The idea of you at your age talking of going to sea,
and leaving that dear, patient little wife of yours at
home, who has seen nothing of you all her life!  It's all
very well for you.  You have the life, and the change,
and the excitement, but you don't think of her eating her
heart out in a dreary London lodging.  You men are all
the same."
<P>
"Well, ma'am, since you know so much, you probably
know also that I have sold my pension.  How am I to live
if I do not turn my hand to work?"
<P>
Mrs. Westmacott produced a large registered envelope
from beneath the sheets and tossed it over to the old
seaman.
<P>
"That excuse won't do.  There are your pension
papers.  Just see if they are right."
<P>
He broke the seal, and out tumbled the very papers
which he had made over to McAdam two days before.
<P>
"But what am I to do with these now?" he cried in
bewilderment.
<P>
"You will put them in a safe place, or get a friend
to do so, and, if you do your duty, you will go to your
wife and beg her pardon for having even for an instant
thought of leaving her."
<P>
The Admiral passed his hand over his rugged forehead. 
"This is very good of you, ma'am" said he, "very good and
kind, and I know that you are a staunch friend, but for
all that these papers mean money, and though we may have
been in broken water lately, we are not quite in such
straits as to have to signal to our friends.  When we do,
ma'am, there's no one we would look to sooner than to
you."
<P>
"Don't be ridiculous!" said the widow.  "You know
nothing whatever about it, and yet you stand there laying
down the law.  I'll have my way in the matter, and you
shall take the papers, for it is no favor that I am doing
you, but simply a restoration of stolen property."
<P>
"How that, ma'am?"
<P>
"I am just going to explain, though you might take a
lady's word for it without asking any questions.  Now,
what I am going to say is just between you four, and must
go no farther.  I have my own reasons for wishing to keep
it from the police.  Who do you think it was who struck
me last night, Admiral?"
<P>
"Some villain, ma'am.  I don't know his name."
<P>
"But I do.  It was the same man who ruined or tried
to ruin your son.  It was my only brother, Jeremiah."
<P>
"Ah!"
<P>
"I will tell you about him--or a little about him,
for he has done much which I would not care to talk of,
nor you to listen to.  He was always a villain,
smooth-spoken and plausible, but a dangerous, subtle
villain all the same.  If I have some hard thoughts about
mankind I can trace them back to the childhood which I
spent with my brother.  He is my only living relative,
for my other brother, Charles's father, was killed in the
Indian mutiny.
<P>
"Our father was rich, and when he died he made a good
provision both for Jeremiah and for me.  He knew Jeremiah
and he mistrusted him, however; so instead of giving him
all that he meant him to have he handed me over a part of
it, telling me, with what was almost his dying breath, to
hold it in trust for my brother, and to use it in his
behalf when he should have squandered or lost all that he
had.  This arrangement was meant to be a secret between
my father and myself, but unfortunately his words were
overheard by the nurse, and she repeated them afterwards
to my brother, so that he came to know that I held some
money in trust for him.  I suppose tobacco will not harm
my head, Doctor?  Thank you, then I shall trouble
you for the matches, Ida."  She lit a cigarette, and
leaned back upon the pillow, with the blue wreaths
curling from her lips.
<P>
"I cannot tell you how often he has attempted to get
that money from me.  He has bullied, cajoled, threatened,
coaxed, done all that a man could do.  I still held it
with the presentiment that a need for it would come. 
When I heard of this villainous business, his flight, and
his leaving his partner to face the storm, above all that
my old friend had been driven to surrender his income in
order to make up for my brother's defalcations, I felt
that now indeed I had a need for it.  I sent in Charles
yesterday to Mr. McAdam, and his client, upon hearing the
facts of the case, very graciously consented to give back
the papers, and to take the money which he had advanced. 
Not a word of thanks to me, Admiral.  I tell you that it
was very cheap benevolence, for it was all done with his
own money, and how could I use it better?
<P>
"I thought that I should probably hear from him soon,
and I did.  Last evening there was handed in a note of
the usual whining, cringing tone.  He had come back from
abroad at the risk of his life and liberty, just in order
that he might say good-bye to the only sister he ever
had, and to entreat my forgiveness for any pain
which he had caused me.  He would never trouble me again,
and he begged only that I would hand over to him the sum
which I held in trust for him.  That, with what he had
already, would be enough to start him as an honest man in
the new world, when he would ever remember and pray for
the dear sister who had been his savior.  That was the
style of the letter, and it ended by imploring me to
leave the window-latch open, and to be in the front room
at three in the morning, when he would come to receive my
last kiss and to bid me farewell.
<P>
"Bad as he was, I could not, when he trusted me,
betray him.  I said nothing, but I was there at the hour. 
He entered through the window, and implored me to give
him the money.  He was terribly changed; gaunt, wolfish,
and spoke like a madman.  I told him that I had spent the
money.  He gnashed his teeth at me, and swore it was his
money.  I told him that I had spent it on him.  He asked
me how.  I said in trying to make him an honest man, and
in repairing the results of his villainy.  He shrieked
out a curse, and pulling something out of the breast of
his coat--a loaded stick, I think--he struck me with it,
and I remembered nothing more."
<P>
"The blackguard!" cried the Doctor, "but the police
must be hot upon his track."
<P>
"I fancy not," Mrs. Westmacott answered calmly.  "As
my brother is a particularly tall, thin man, and as the
police are looking for a short, fat one, I do not think
that it is very probable that they will catch him.  It is
best, I think, that these little family matters should be
adjusted in private."
<P>
"My dear ma'am," said the Admiral, "if it is indeed
this man's money that has bought back my pension, then I
can have no scruples about taking it.  You have brought
sunshine upon us, ma'am, when the clouds were at their
darkest, for here is my boy who insists upon returning
the money which I got.  He can keep it now to pay his
debts.  For what you have done I can only ask God to
bless you, ma'am, and as to thanking you I can't even----"
<P>
"Then pray don't try," said the widow.  "Now run
away, Admiral, and make your peace with Mrs. Denver.  I
am sure if I were she it would be a long time before I
should forgive you.  As for me, I am going to America
when Charles goes.  You'll take me so far, won't you,
Ida?  There is a college being built in Denver which is
to equip the woman of the future for the struggle of
life, and especially for her battle against man.  Some
months ago the committee offered me a responsible
situation upon the staff, and I have decided now to
accept it, for Charles's marriage removes the last tie
which binds me to England.  You will write to me
sometimes, my friends, and you will address your letters
to Professor Westmacott, Emancipation College, Denver. 
From there I shall watch how the glorious struggle goes
in conservative old England, and if I am needed you will
find me here again fighting in the forefront of the fray. 
Good-bye--but not you, girls; I have still a word I wish
to say to you.
<P>
"Give me your hand, Ida, and yours, Clara," said she
when they were alone.  "Oh, you naughty little pusses,
aren't you ashamed to look me in the face?  Did you
think--did you really think that I was so very blind, and
could not see your little plot?  You did it very well, I
must say that, and really I think that I like you better
as you are.  But you had all your pains for nothing, you
little conspirators, for I give you my word that I had
quite made up my mind not to have him."
<P>
And so within a few weeks our little ladies from
their observatory saw a mighty bustle in the Wilderness,
when two-horse carriages came, and coachmen with favors,
to bear away the twos who were destined to come back one. 
And they themselves in their crackling silk dresses went
across, as invited, to the big double wedding breakfast
which was held in the house of Doctor Walker.  Then there
was health-drinking, and laughter, and changing of
dresses, and rice-throwing when the carriages drove
up again, and two more couples started on that journey
which ends only with life itself.
<P>
Charles Westmacott is now a flourishing ranchman in
the western part of Texas, where he and his sweet little
wife are the two most popular persons in all that county. 
Of their aunt they see little, but from time to time they
see notices in the papers that there is a focus of light
in Denver, where mighty thunderbolts are being forged
which will one day bring the dominant sex upon their
knees.  The Admiral and his wife still live at number
one, while Harold and Clara have taken number two, where
Doctor Walker continues to reside.  As to the business,
it had been reconstructed, and the energy and ability of
the junior partner had soon made up for all the ill that
had been done by his senior.  Yet with his sweet and
refined home atmosphere he is able to realize his wish,
and to keep himself free from the sordid aims and base
ambitions which drag down the man whose business lies too
exclusively in the money market of the vast Babylon.  As
he goes back every evening from the crowds of Throgmorton
Street to the tree-lined peaceful avenues of Norwood, so
he has found it possible in spirit also to do one's
duties amidst the babel of the City, and yet to live
beyond it.
