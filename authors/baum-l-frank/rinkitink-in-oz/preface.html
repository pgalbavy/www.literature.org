Introducing this Story
<P>
<P>
Here is a story with a boy hero, and a boy of whom
you have never before heard. There are girls in the
story, too, including our old friend Dorothy, and some
of the characters wander a good way from the Land of Oz
before they all assemble in the Emerald City to take
part in Ozma's banquet. Indeed, I think you will find
this story  quite different from the other histories
of Oz, but I hope you will not like it the less on that
account.
<P>
If I am permitted to write another Oz book it will
tell of some thrilling adventures encountered by
Dorothy, Betsy Bobbin, Trot and the Patchwork Girl
right in the Land of Oz, and how they discovered some
amazing creatures that never could have existed outside
a fairy-land. I have an idea that about the time you
are reading this story of Rinkitink I shall be writing
that story of Adventures in Oz.
<P>
Don't fail to write me often and give me your advice
and suggestions, which I always appreciate. I get a
good many letters from my readers, but every one is a
joy to me and I answer them as soon as I can find time
to do so.
