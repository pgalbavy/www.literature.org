<p>In its inception the Fortuna hotel had not been intended for the use
of Mexicans--in fact, its rates were practically prohibitive for any
one not being paid in gold--but, since most of the Americans had left,
and seven dollars a day Mex was no deterrent to the rich refugee
landowners, it became of a sudden international, with a fine mixture of
purse-proud Spaniards and race-proud American adventurers.
</p><p>Not a very pleasing combination for the parents of romantic damsels
destined for some prearranged marriage of state, but very exciting for
the damsels and most provocative to the Americans.
</p><p>After the promenade in the plaza the mothers by common consent
preempted the up-stairs reception-room, gathering their precious
charges in close; while the Americans, after their custom, forgathered
in the lobby, convenient to the bar. Hot arguments about the
revolution, and predictions of events to come, served to pass the early
evening, with many scornful glances at the Mexican dandies who went so
insolently up the stairs. And then, as the refugees retired to their
apartments and the spirit of adventure rose uppermost, Phil De Lancey
made a dash out into the darkness and came back with a Mexican string
band.
</p><p>"A serenade, boys!" he announced, as the musicians filed sheepishly
into the hotel. "Our guests, the fair <u>se単oritas</u>, you know! We'll
make those young Mexican dudes look like two-spots before the war is
over. Who's game now for a song beneath the windows? You know the old
stand-bys--'La Paloma' and 'Teresita Mia'--and you want to listen to
me sing 'Me Gustan Todas' to Gracia, the fairest of the fair! Come on,
fellows, out in the plaza, and then listen to the old folks cuss!"
</p><p>They adjourned then, after a drink for courage, to the moonlight
and the plaza; and there, beneath the shuttered windows and vacant
balconies, the guitars and violins took up "La Paloma," while Phil and
a few brave spirits sang.
</p><p>A silence followed their first attempt, as well as their second and
third, and the <u>comisario</u> of police, a mild creature owned and paid by
the company, came around and made a few ineffectual protests.
</p><p>But inside the company's concession, where by common consent the
militant <u>rurales</u> kept their hands off, the Americans knew they were
safe, and they soon jollied the <u>comisario</u> into taking a drink and
departing. Then De Lancey took up the burden, and the string band,
hired by the hour, strummed on as if for eternity.
</p><p>One by one the windows opened; fretful fathers stepped out on the
balcony and, bound by the custom and convention of the country, thanked
them and bade them good night. But the two windows behind which the
Se単or Aragon and his family reposed did not open and, though the
dwindling band stood directly under their balcony, and all knew that
his daughter was the fairest of the fair, Don Cipriano did not wish
them good night.
</p><p>Perhaps he recognized the leading tenor--and the big voice of Bud
Hooker, trying to still the riot--but, however it was, he would not
speak to them, and De Lancey would not quit.
</p><p>"Try 'em on American music," he cried, as every one but Bud went away
in disgust, "the latest rag from Broadwa-ay, New York. Here, gimme that
guitar, <u>hombre</u>, and listen to this now!"
</p><p>He picked out a clever bit of syncopation and pitched his voice to a
heady twang:
</p><p>  "Down in the garden where the red roses grow,
  Oh my, I long to go!<br/>
  Pluck me like a flower, cuddle me an hour,
  Lovie, let me learn the Rose Red Ra-ag!"
</p><p>There was some swing to that, and it seemed to make an impression,
for just as he was well started on the chorus the slats of one of the
shutters parted and a patch of white shone through the spaces. It was
the ladies, then, who were getting interested! Phil wailed on:
</p><p>  "Swee-eet honey-bee, be sweet to me!<br/>
  My heart is free, but here's the key!"
</p><p>And then, positively, he could see that patch of white beat time. He
took heart of grace at that and sang on to the end, and at a suggestion
of clapping in dumb-show he gave an encore and ragged it over again.
</p><p>"Ev'rybody's doin' it, doin' it, doin' it!'" he began, as the shadow
dance ceased.
</p><p>"'Honey, I declare, it's a bear, it's a bear, it's a bear!'" he
continued temptingly, and was well on his way to further extravagancies
when the figure in white swiftly vanished and a door slammed hard
inside the house.
</p><p>Several minutes later the form of Don Juan appeared at the lower door,
and in no uncertain tones he requested them to cease.
</p><p>"The Se単or Aragon informs me," he said, "that your music annoys him."
</p><p>"Well, let him come to the balcony and say his '<u>buenas noches</u>,'"
answered Phil resentfully.
</p><p>"The gentleman refuses to do that," responded Don Juan briefly.
</p><p>"Then let him go to bed!" replied De Lancey, strumming a few syncopated
chords. "I'm singing to his daughter."
</p><p>At that Don Juan came down off the porch in his slippers and they
engaged in a protracted argument.
</p><p>"What, don't I get a word," demanded Phil grievously, "not a pleasant
look from anybody? 'Swee-eet honey-bee, be sweet to me!'" he pleaded,
turning pathetically to the lady's balcony; and then, with a sudden
flourish, a white handkerchief appeared through the crack of the
shutters and Gracia waved him good night.
</p><p>"Enough, Don Juan!" he cried, laying down the guitar with a thump.
"This ends our evening's entertainment!"
</p><p>After paying and thanking the stolid musicians Phil joined Bud and the
pair adjourned to their room where, in the intervals of undressing,
Phil favored the occupants of the adjoining apartments with an aria
from "Beautiful Doll."
</p><p>But for all such nights of romance and music there is always a morning
afterward; and a fine tenor voice set to rag-time never helped much
in the development of a mine. Though Bud had remained loyally by his
friend in his evening serenade he, for one, never forgot for a moment
that they were in Fortuna to work the Eagle Tail and not to win the
hearts of Spanish-Mexican <u>se単oritas</u>, no matter how attractive they
might be.
</p><p>Bud was a practical man who, if he ever made love, would doubtless do
it in a perfectly businesslike way, without hiring any string bands.
But at the same time he was willing to make some concessions.
</p><p>"Well, go ahead and get your sleep, then," he growled, after trying
three times in the morning to get his pardner up; "I'm going out to the
mine!"
</p><p>Then, with a saddle-gun under his knee and his six-shooter hung at his
hip, he rode rapidly down the road, turning out from time to time to
let long cavalcades of mules string by. The dead-eyed <u>arrieros</u>, each
with his combined mule-blind and whip-lash swinging free, seemed to
have very little on their minds but their pack-lashings, and yet they
must be three days out from Moctezuma.
</p><p>Their mules, too, were well loaded with the products of the hot
country--<u>fanegas</u> of corn in red leather sacks, oranges and fruits in
hand-made crates, <u>panoches</u> of sugar in balanced frames, long joints
of sugar-cane for the <u>dulce</u> pedlers, and nothing to indicate either
haste or flight.
</p><p>Three times he let long pack-trains go by without a word, and then at
last, overcome by curiosity, he inquired about the <u>revoltosos</u>.
</p><p>"What <u>revoltosos</u>?" queried the old man to whom he spoke.
</p><p>"Why, the men of Bernardo Bravo," answered Bud; "the men who are
marching to take Moctezuma."
</p><p>"When I left Moctezuma," returned the old man politely, "all was
quiet--there were no <u>revoltosos</u>. Since then, I cannot say."
</p><p>"But the soldiers!" cried Bud. "Surely you saw them! They were marching
to fight the rebels."
</p><p>"Perhaps so," shrugged the <u>arriero</u>, laying the lash of his <u>topojo</u>
across the rump of a mule; "but I know nothing about it."
</p><p>"No," muttered Bud, as he continued on his way; "and I'll bet nobody
else does."
</p><p>Inquiry showed that in this, too, he was correct. From those who
traveled fast and from those who traveled slow he received the same
wondering answer--the country might be filled with <u>revoltosos</u>; but as
for them, they knew nothing about it.
</p><p>Not until he got back to Fortuna and the busy Federals' telegraph-wire
did he hear any more news of rapine and bloodshed, and the light which
dawned upon him then was gradually dawning upon the whole town.
</p><p>It was a false alarm, given out for purposes of state and the "higher
politics" with which Mexico is cursed, and the most that was ever seen
of Bernardo Bravo and his lawless men was twenty miserable creatures,
half-starved, but with guns in their hand, who had come down out of the
mountains east of Moctezuma and killed a few cows for beef.
</p><p>Thoroughly disgusted, and yet vaguely alarmed at this bit of
opera-bouffe warfare, Bud set himself resolutely to work to hunt up men
for their mine, and, as many poor people were out of employment because
of the general stagnation of business, he soon had ten Mexicans at his
call.
</p><p>Then, as Phil had dropped out of sight, he ordered supplies at the
store and engaged Cruz Mendez--who had spent his fortune in three
days--to pack the goods out on his mules.
</p><p>They were ready to start the next morning if De Lancey could be found
to order the powder and tools, and as the afternoon wore on and no Phil
appeared, Bud went on a long hunt which finally discovered him in the
balcony of their window, making signs in the language of the bear.[2]
</p><p>[Footnote 2: In Mexico a man who flirts with a woman, or courts her
surreptitiously through the bars of her window, is called a "bear."]
</p><p>"Say, Phil," he hailed, disregarding his pardner's obvious
preoccupation; "break away for a minute and tell me what kind of powder
to get to break that schist--the store closes at five o'clock, and--"
</p><p>He thrust his head out the door as he spoke and paused, abashed.
Through the half-closed portal of the next balcony but one he beheld
the golden hair of Gracia Aragon, and she fixed her brown eyes upon him
with a dazzling, mischievous smile.
</p><p>"O-ho!" murmured Bud, laying a compelling hand on De Lancey and backing
swiftly out of range; "so this is what you're up to--talking signs! But
say, Phil," he continued, beckoning him peremptorily with a jerk of his
head, "I got ten men hired and a lot of grub bought, and if you don't
pick out that mining stuff we're going to lose a day. So get the lady
to excuse you and come on now."
</p><p>"In a minute," pleaded Phil, and he went at the end of his allotted
time, and perhaps it was the imp of jealousy that put strength into
Hooker's arm.
</p><p>"Well, that's all right," said Bud, as Phil began his laughing excuses;
"but you want to remember the Maine, pardner--we didn't come down here
to play the bear. When there's any love-making to be done I want to be
in on it. And you want to remember that promise you made me--you said
you wouldn't have a thing to do with the Aragon outfit unless I was
with you!"
</p><p>"Why, you aren't--you aren't jealous, are you, Bud?"
</p><p>"Yes, I'm jealous," answered Hooker harshly; "jealous as the devil! And
I want you to keep that promise, see?"
</p><p>"Aw, Bud--" began De Lancey incredulously; but Hooker silenced him with
a look. Perhaps he was really jealous, or perhaps he only said so to
have his way, but Phil saw that he was in earnest, and he went quietly
by his side.
</p><p>But love had set his brain in a whirl, and he thought no more of his
promise--only of some subtler way of meeting his inamorata, some way
which Bud would fail to see.
