<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was gray stone, with long roofs of thick green slate. An architect
who loved the milder "Gothic motives" had built what he liked:
it was to be seen at once that he had been left unhampered, and
he had wrought a picture out of his head into a noble and exultant
reality. At the same time a landscape-designer had played so good
a second, with ready-made accessories of screen, approach and
vista, that already whatever look of newness remained upon the
place was to its advantage, as showing at least one thing yet
clean under the grimy sky. For, though the smoke was thinner in
this direction, and at this long distance from the heart of the
town, it was not absent, and under tutelage of wind and weather
could be malignant even here, where cows had wandered in the meadows
and corn had been growing not ten years gone.</p>

<p>Altogether, the New House was a success. It was one of those
architects' successes which leave the owners veiled in privacy;
it revealed nothing of the people who lived in it save that they
were rich. There are houses that cannot be detached from their
own people without protesting: every inch of mortar seems to mourn
the separation, and such a house&mdash;no matter what be done to it&mdash;is
ever murmurous with regret, whispering the old name sadly to itself
unceasingly. But the New House was of a kind to change hands without
emotion. In our swelling cities, great places of its type are
useful as financial gauges of the business tides; rich families,
one after another, take title and occupy such houses as fortunes
rise and fall&mdash;they mark the high tide. It was impossible to imagine
a child's toy wagon left upon a walk or driveway of the New House,
and yet it was&mdash;as Bibbs rightly called it&mdash;"beautiful."</p>

<p>What the architect thought of the "Golfo di Napoli," which hung
in its vast gold revel of rococo frame against the gray wood of
the hall, is to be conjectured&mdash;perhaps he had not seen it.</p>

<p>"Edith, did you say only eleven feet?" Bibbs panted, staring
at it, as the white-jacketed twin of a Pullman porter helped him
to get out of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Eleven without the frame," she explained. "It's splendid, don't
you think? It lightens things up so. The hall was kind of gloomy
before."</p>

<p>"No gloom now!" said Bibbs.</p>

<p>"This statue in the corner is pretty, too," she remarked. "Mamma
and I bought that." And Bibbs turned at her direction to behold,
amid a grove of tubbed palms, a "life-size," black-bearded Moor,
of a plastic composition painted with unappeasable gloss and brilliancy.
Upon his chocolate head he wore a gold turban; in his hand he
held a gold-tipped spear; and for the rest, he was red and yellow
and black and silver.</p>

<p>"Hallelujah!" was the sole comment of the returned wanderer,
and Edith, saying she would "find mamma," left him blinking at
the Moor. Presently, after she had disappeared, he turned to the
colored man who stood waiting, Bibbs's traveling-bag in his hand.
"What do <em>YOU </em>think of it?"  Bibbs asked, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Gran'!" replied the servitor. "She mighty hard to dus'. Dus'
git in all 'em wrinkles. Yessuh, she mighty hard to dus'."</p>

<p>"I expect she must be," said Bibbs, his glance returning reflectively
to the black bull beard for a moment. "Is there a place anywhere
I could lie down?"</p>

<p>"Yessuh. We got one nem spare rooms all fix up fo' you, suh.
Right up staihs, suh. Nice room."</p>

<p>He led the way, and Bibbs followed slowly, stopping at intervals
to rest, and noting a heavy increase in the staff of service since
the exodus from the "old" house. Maids and scrubwomen were at
work under the patently nominal direction of another Pullman porter,
who was profoundly enjoying his own affectation of being harassed
with care.</p>

<p>"Ev'ything got look spick an' span fo' the big doin's to-night,"
Bibbs's guide explained, chuckling. "Yessuh, we got big doin's
to-night! Big doin's!"</p>

<p>The room to which he conducted his lagging charge was furnished
in every particular like a room in a new hotel; and Bibbs found
it pleasant&mdash;though, indeed, any room with a good bed would have
seemed pleasant to him after his journey. He stretched himself
flat immediately, and having replied "Not now" to the attendant's
offer to unpack the bag, closed his eyes wearily.</p>

<p>White-jacket, racially sympathetic, lowered the window-shades
and made an exit on tiptoe, encountering the other white-jacket&mdash;the
harassed overseer&mdash;in the hall without. Said the emerging one:
"He mighty shaky, Mist' Jackson. Drop right down an' shet his
eyes. Eyelids all black. Rich folks gotta go same as anybody else.
Anybody ast me if I change 'ith 'at ole boy &mdash;No, suh! Le'm
keep 'is money; I keep my black skin an' keep out the ground!"</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson expressed the same preference. "Yessuh, he look tuh
me like somebody awready laid out," he concluded. And upon the
stairway landing, near by, two old women, on all-fours at their
work, were likewise pessimistic.</p>

<p>"Hech!" said one, lamenting in a whisper. "It give me a turn
to see him go by&mdash;white as wax an' bony as a dead fish! Mrs. Cronin,
tell me: d'it make ye kind o' sick to look at um?"</p>

<p>"Sick? No more than the face of a blessed angel already in heaven!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, "I'd a b'y o' me own come home t' die
once&mdash;"  She fell silent at a rustling of skirts in the corridor
above them.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Sheridan hurrying to greet her son.</p>

<p>She was one of those fat, pink people who fade and contract with
age like drying fruit; and her outside was a true portrait of
her. Her husband and her daughter had long ago absorbed her. What
intelligence she had was given almost wholly to comprehending
and serving those two, and except in the presence of one of them
she was nearly always absent-minded. Edith lived all day with
her mother, as daughters do; and Sheridan so held his wife to
her unity with him that she had long ago become unconscious of
her existence as a thing separate from his. She invariably perceived
his moods, and nursed him through them when she did not share
them; and she gave him a profound sympathy with the inmost spirit
and purpose of his being, even though she did not comprehend it
and partook of it only as a spectator. They had known but one
actual altercation in their lives, and that was thirty years past,
in the early days of Sheridan's struggle, when, in order to enhance
the favorable impression he believed himself to be making upon
some capitalists, he had thought it necessary to accompany them
to a performance of "The Black Crook." But she had not once referred
to this during the last ten years.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheridan's manner was hurried and inconsequent; her clothes
rustled more than other women's clothes; she seemed to wear too
many at a time and to be vaguely troubled by them, and she was
patting a skirt down over some unruly internal dissension at the
moment she opened Bibbs's door.</p>

<p>At sight of the recumbent figure she began to close the door
softly, withdrawing, but the young man had heard the turning of
the knob and the rustling of skirts, and he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't go, mother," he said. "I'm not asleep." He swung his long
legs over the side of the bed to rise, but she set a hand on his
shoulder, restraining him; and he lay flat again.</p>

<p>"No," she said, bending over to kiss his cheek, "I just come
for a minute, but I want to see how you seem. Edith said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor Edith!" he murmured. "She couldn't look at me. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mrs. Sheridan, having let in the light at a window,
came back to the bedside. "You look a great deal better than what
you did before you went to the sanitarium, anyway. It's done you
good; a body can see that right away. You need fatting up, of
course, and you haven't got much color&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I haven't much color."</p>

<p>"But you will have when you get your strength back."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" he responded, cheerfully. "<em>THEN I </em>will."</p>

<p>"You look a great deal better than what I expected."</p>

<p>"Edith must have a great vocabulary!" he chuckled.</p>

<p>"She's too sensitive," said Mrs. Sheridan, "and it makes her
exaggerate a little. What about your diet?"</p>

<p>"That's all right. They told me to eat anything."</p>

<p>"Anything at all?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;anything I could."</p>

<p>"That's good," she said, nodding. "They mean for you just to
build up your strength. That's what they told me the last time
I went to see you at the sanitarium. You look better than what
you did then, and that's only a little time ago. How long was
it?"</p>

<p>"Eight months, I think."</p>

<p>"No, it couldn't be. I know it ain't <em>THAT </em>long, but
maybe it was longer'n I thought. And this last month or so I haven't
had scarcely even time to write more than just a line to ask how
you were gettin' along, but I told Edith to write, the weeks I
couldn't, and I asked Jim to, too, and they both said they would,
so I suppose you've kept up pretty well on the home news."</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>"What I think you need," said the mother, gravely, "is to liven
up a little and take an interest in things. That's what papa was
sayin' this morning, after we got your telegram; and that's what'll
stimilate your appetite, too. He was talkin' over his plans for
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plans?" Bibbs, turning on his side, shielded his eyes from the
light with his hand, so that he might see her better. "What&mdash;"
He paused. "What plans is he making for me, mother?"</p>

<p>She turned away, going back to the window to draw down the shade.
"Well, you better talk it over with <em>HIM," </em>she said, with
perceptible nervousness. "He better tell you himself. I don't
feel as if I had any call, exactly, to go into it; and you better
get to sleep now, anyway."  She came and stood by the bedside
once more. "But you must remember, Bibbs, whatever papa does is
for the best. He loves his chuldern and wants to do what's right
by <em>ALL </em>of 'em&mdash;and you'll always find he's right in the
end."</p>

<p>He made a little gesture of assent, which seemed to content her;
and she rustled to the door, turning to speak again after she
had opened it. "You get a good nap, now, so as to be all rested
up for to-night."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mean&mdash;he&mdash;" Bibbs stammered, having begun to speak
too quickly. Checking himself, he drew a long breath, then asked,
quietly, "Does father expect me to come down-stairs this evening?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think he does," she answered. "You see, it's the 'house-warming,'
as he calls it, and he said he thinks all our chuldern ought to
be around us, as well as the old friends and other folks. It's
just what he thinks you need&mdash;to take an interest and liven up.
You don't feel too bad to come down, do you?"</p>

<p>"Mother?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Take a good look at me," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, see here!" she cried, with brusque cheerfulness. "You're
not so bad off as you think you are, Bibbs. You're on the mend;
and it won't do you any harm to please your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't that," he interrupted. "Honestly, I'm only afraid it
might spoil somebody's appetite. Edith&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you the child was too sensitive," she interrupted, in
turn. "You're a plenty good-lookin' enough young man for anybody!
You look like you been through a long spell and begun to get well,
and that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll come to the party. If the rest of you can stand
it, I can!"</p>

<p>"It 'll do you good," she returned, rustling into the hall. "Now
take a nap, and I'll send one o' the help to wake you in time
for you to get dressed up before dinner. You go to sleep right
away, now, Bibbs!"</p>

<p>Bibbs was unable to obey, though he kept his eyes closed. Something
she had said kept running in his mind, repeating itself over and
over interminably. "His plans for you&mdash;his plans for you&mdash;his
plans for you&mdash;his plans for you&mdash;" And then, taking the place
of "his plans for you," after what seemed a long, long while,
her flurried voice came back to him insistently, seeming to whisper
in his ear: "He loves his chuldern&mdash;he loves his chuldern&mdash;he
loves his chuldern"&mdash;"you'll find he's always right&mdash;you'll find
he's always right&mdash;" Until at last, as he drifted into the state
of half-dreams and distorted realities, the voice seemed to murmur
from beyond a great black wing that came out of the wall and stretched
over his bed&mdash;it was a black wing within the room, and at the
same time it was a black cloud crossing the sky, bridging the
whole earth from pole to pole. It was a cloud of black smoke,
and out of the heart of it came a flurried voice whispering over
and over, "His plans for you&mdash;his plans for you&mdash;his plans for
you&mdash;" And then there was nothing.</p>

<p>He woke refreshed, stretched himself gingerly&mdash;as one might have
a care against too quick or too long a pull upon a frayed elastic&mdash;and,
getting to his feet, went blinking to the window and touched the
shade so that it flew up, letting in a pale sunset.</p>

<p>He looked out into the lemon-colored light and smiled wanly at
the next house, as Edith's grandiose phrase came to mind, "the
old Vertrees country mansion." It stood in a broad lawn which
was separated from the Sheridans' by a young hedge; and it was
a big, square, plain old box of a house with a giant salt-cellar
atop for a cupola. Paint had been spared for a long time, and
no one could have put a name to the color of it, but in spite
of that the place had no look of being out at heel, and the sward
was as neatly trimmed as the Sheridans' own.</p>

<p>The separating hedge ran almost beneath Bibbs's window&mdash;for this
wing of the New House extended here almost to the edge of the
lot&mdash;and, directly opposite the window, the Vertreeses' lawn had
been graded so as to make a little knoll upon which stood a small
rustic "summer-house." It was almost on a level with Bibbs's window
and not thirty feet away; and it was easy for him to imagine the
present dynasty of Vertreeses in grievous outcry when they had
found this retreat ruined by the juxtaposition of the parvenu
intruder. Probably the "summer-house" was pleasant and pretty
in summer. It had the look of a place wherein little girls had
played for a generation or so with dolls and "housekeeping," 
or where a lovely old lady might come to read something dull on
warm afternoons; but now in the thin light it was desolate, the
color of dust, and hung with haggard vines which had lost their
leaves.</p>

<p>Bibbs looked at it with grave sympathy, probably feeling some
kinship with anything so dismantled; then he turned to a cheval-glass
beside the window and paid himself the dubious tribute of a thorough
inspection. He looked the mirror up and down, slowly, repeatedly,
but came in the end to a long and earnest scrutiny of the face.
Throughout this cryptic seance his manner was profoundly impersonal;
he had the air of an entomologist intent upon classifying a specimen,
but finally he appeared to become pessimistic. He shook his head
solemnly; then gazed again and shook his head again, and continued
to shake it slowly, in complete disapproval.</p>

<p>"You certainly are one horrible sight!" he said, aloud.</p>

<p>And at that he was instantly aware of an observer. Turning quickly,
he was vouchsafed the picture of a charming lady, framed in a
rustic aperture of the "summer-house" and staring full into his
window&mdash;straight into his eyes, too, for the infinitesimal fraction
of a second before the flashingly censorious withdrawal of her
own. Composedly, she pulled several dead twigs from a vine, the
manner of her action conveying a message or proclamation to the
effect that she was in the summer-house for the sole purpose of
such-like pruning and tending, and that no gentleman could suppose
her presence there to be due to any other purpose whatsoever,
or that, being there on that account, she had allowed her attention
to wander for one instant in the direction of things of which
she was in reality unconscious.</p>

<p>Having pulled enough twigs to emphasize her unconsciousness&mdash;and
at the same time her disapproval&mdash;of everything in the nature
of a Sheridan or belonging to a Sheridan, she descended the knoll
with maintained composure, and sauntered toward a side-door of
the country mansion of the Vertreeses. An elderly lady, bonneted
and cloaked, opened the door and came to meet her.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Mary? I've been looking for you. What were you
doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Just looking into one of Sheridans' windows," said
Mary Vertrees. "I got caught at it."</p>

<p>"Mary!" cried her mother. "Just as we were going to call! Good
heavens!"</p>

<p>"We'll go, just the same," the daughter returned. "I suppose
those women would be glad to have us if we'd burned their house
to the ground."</p>

<p>"But <em>WHO </em>saw you?" insisted Mrs. Vertrees.</p>

<p>"One of the sons, I suppose he was. I believe he's insane, or
something. At least I hear they keep him in a sanitarium somewhere,
and never talk about him. He was staring at himself in a mirror
and talking to himself. Then he looked out and caught me."</p>

<p>"What did he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, of course."</p>

<p>"How did he look?"</p>

<p>"Like a ghost in a blue suit," said Miss Vertrees, moving toward
the street and waving a white-gloved hand in farewell to her father,
who was observing them from the window of his library. "Rather
tragic and altogether impossible. Do come on, mother, and let's
get it over!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Vertrees, with many misgivings, set forth with her daughter
for their gracious assault upon the New House next door.</p>
