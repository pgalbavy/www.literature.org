<p>Desboro came for her in his car at five and found her standing
alone in her office, dressed in a blue travelling dress, hatted
and closely veiled. He partly lifted the veil, kissed the cold,
unresponsive lips, the pallid cheek, the white-gloved fingers.</p>

<p>"Is Her Royal Shyness ready?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim."</p>

<p>"All her affairs of state accomplished?" he asked laughingly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the day's work is done."</p>

<p>"Was it a hard day for you, sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;hard."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," he murmured.</p>

<p>She rearranged her veil in silence.</p>

<p>Again, as the big car rolled away northward, and they were alone
once more in the comfortable limousine, he took possession of
her unresisting hand, whispering:</p>

<p>"I am so sorry you have had a hard day, dear. You really look
very pale and tired."</p>

<p>"It was a&mdash;tiresome day."</p>

<p>He lifted her hand to his lips: "Do you love me, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Above everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you know that I love you above everything in the world?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!" he urged. "Don't you <em>know</em> it?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think you&mdash;care for me."</p>

<p>He laughed: "Will Your Royal Shyness never unbend! Is <em>that</em>
all the credit you give me for my worship and adoration?"</p>

<p>She said, after a silence: "If it lies with me, you really will
love me some day."</p>

<p>"Dearest!" he protested, laughing but perplexed. "Don't you know
that I love you <em>now</em>&mdash;that I am absolutely mad about you?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he waited, striving to see her expression
through the veil. But when he offered to lift it, she gently avoided
him.</p>

<p>"Did you go to business?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I? Oh, yes, I went back to the office. But Lord! Jacqueline,
I couldn't keep my attention on the tape or on the silly orders
people fired at me over the wire. So I left young Seely in charge
and went to lunch with Jack Cairns; and then he and I returned
to the office, where I've been fidgeting about ever since. I think
it's been the longest day I ever lived."</p>

<p>"It has been a long day," she assented gravely. "Did Mr. Cairns
speak to you of Cynthia?"</p>

<p>"He mentioned her, I believe."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what he said about her?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes. I think he spoke about her very nicely&mdash;about her
being interesting and ambitious and talented&mdash;something of that
sort&mdash;but how could I keep my mind on what he was saying about
another girl?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline looked out of the window across a waste of swamp and
trestle and squalid buildings toward University Heights. She said
presently, without turning:</p>

<p>"Some day, may I ask Cynthia to visit me?"</p>

<p>"Dearest girl! Of course! Isn't it your house&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, Jim."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What I say. Silverwood is not yet even partly mine. It must
remain entirely yours&mdash;until I know you&mdash;better."</p>

<p>"Why on earth do you say such silly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What is yours must remain yours," she repeated, in a low voice,
"just as my shop, and office, and my apartment must remain mine&mdash;for
a time."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"I can not tell."</p>

<p>"Do you mean for always?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"And I don't understand you, dear," he said impatiently.</p>

<p>"You will, Jim."</p>

<p>He smiled uneasily: "For how long must we twain, who are now
one, maintain solitary sovereignty over our separate domains?"</p>

<p>"Until I know you better."</p>

<p>"And how long is that going to take?" he asked, smilingly apprehensive
and deeply perplexed by her quiet and serious attitude toward
him.</p>

<p>"I don't know how long, I wish I did."</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, dear, has anything unpleasant happened to disturb
you since I last saw you?"</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me, dear," he insisted uneasily.</p>

<p>"I will tell you this, Jim. Whatever may have occurred to disturb
me is already a matter of the past. Life and its business lie
before us; that is all I know. This is our beginning, Jim; and
happiness depends on what we make of our lives from now on&mdash;from
now on."</p>

<p>The stray lock of golden hair had fallen across her cheek, accenting
the skin's pallor through the veil. She rested her elbow on the
window ledge, her tired head on her hand, and gazed at the sunset
behind the Palisades. Far below, over the grey and wrinkled river,
smoke from a steamboat drifted, a streak of bronze and purple,
in the sunset light.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> has happened?" he muttered under his breath. And,
turning toward her: "You must tell me, Jacqueline. It is now my
right to know."</p>

<p>"Don't ask me."</p>

<p>His face hardened; for a moment the lean muscles of the jaw worked
visibly.</p>

<p>"Has anybody said anything about me to you?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;has Mrs. Hammerton been to see you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you now, Jacqueline; she did not wish me to marry
you. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that she has been capable of warning you
against me. Did she?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"And yet you married me?" he said, after a silence.</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>"So you could not have believed her, whatever she may have said,"
he concluded calmly.</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"I married you because I loved you. I love you still. Remember
it when you are impatient with me&mdash;when you are hurt&mdash;perhaps
angry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Angry with <em>you</em>, my darling!"</p>

<p>"You are going to be&mdash;very often &mdash;I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Angry?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know. I don't know how it will be with us.
If only you will remember that I love you&mdash;no matter how I seem&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dear, if you tell me that you do love me, I will know that it
must be so!"</p>

<p>"I tell you that I do. I could never love anybody else. You are
all that I have in the world; all I care for. You are absolutely
everything to me. I loved you and married you; I took you for
mine just as you were and are. And if I didn't quite understand
all that&mdash;that you are &mdash;I took you, nevertheless&mdash;for better
or for worse&mdash;and I mean to hold you. And I know now that, knowing
more about you, I would do the same thing if it were to be done
again. I would marry you to-morrow&mdash;knowing what I know."</p>

<p>"What more do you know about me than you did this morning, Jacqueline?"
he asked, terribly troubled.</p>

<p>But she refused to answer.</p>

<p>He said, reddening: "If you have heard any gossip concerning
Mrs. Clydesdale, it is false. Was <em>that</em> what you heard?
Because it is an absolute lie."</p>

<p>But she had learned from Mrs. Clydesdale's reckless lips the
contrary, and she rested her aching head on her hand and stared
out at the endless lines of houses along Broadway, as the car
swung into Yonkers, veered to the west past the ancient manor
house, then rolled northward again toward Hastings.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe me?" he asked at length. "That gossip is a
lie&mdash;if that is what you heard."</p>

<p>She thought: "This is how gentlemen are supposed to behave under
such circumstances." And she shivered.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" he asked, with an effort.</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>He drew the fur robe closer around her, and leaned back in his
corner, deeply worried, impatient, but helpless in the face of
her evident weariness and reticence, which he could not seem to
penetrate or comprehend. Only that something ominous had happened&mdash;that
something was dreadfully wrong&mdash;he now thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>In the purposeless career of a man of his sort, there is much
that it is well to forget. And in Desboro's brief career there
were many things that he would not care to have such a girl as
Jacqueline hear about&mdash;so much, alas! of folly and stupidity,
so much of idleness, so much unworthy, that now in his increasing
chagrin and mortification, in the painful reaction from happy
pride to alarm and self-contempt, he could not even guess what
had occurred, or for which particular folly he was beginning to
pay.</p>

<p>Long since, both in his rooms in town, and at Silverwood, he
had destroyed the silly souvenirs of idleness and folly. He thought
now of the burning sacrifice he had so carelessly made that day
in the library&mdash;and how the flames had shrivelled up letter and
fan, photograph and slipper. And he could not remember that he
had left a rag of lace or a perfumed envelope unburned.</p>

<p>Had the ghosts of their owners risen to confront him on his own
hearthstone, standing already between him and this young girl
he had married?</p>

<p>What whisper had reached her guiltless ears? What rumour, what
breath of innuendo? Must a man still be harassed who has done
with folly for all time&mdash;who aspires to better things&mdash;who strives
to change his whole mode of life merely for the sake of the woman
he loves&mdash;merely to be more worthy of her?</p>

<p>As he sat there so silently in the car beside her, his dark thoughts
travelled back again along the weary, endless road to yesterday.
Since he had known and loved her, his thoughts had often and unwillingly
sought that shadowy road where the only company were ghosts&mdash;phantoms
of dead years that sometimes smiled, sometimes reproached, sometimes
menaced him with suddenly remembered eyes and voiceless but familiar
words forever printed on his memory.</p>

<p>Out of that grey vista, out of that immaterial waste where only
impalpable shapes peopled the void, vanished, grew out of nothing
only to reappear, <em>something</em> had come to trouble the peace
of mind of the woman he loved&mdash;some spectre of folly had arisen
and had whispered in her ear, so that, at the mockery, the light
had died out in her fearless eyes and her pure mind was clouded
and her tender heart was weighted with this thing&mdash;whatever it
might be&mdash;this echo of folly which had returned to mock them both.</p>

<p>"Dearest," he said, drawing her to him so that her cold cheek
rested against his, "whatever I was, I am no longer. You said
you could forgive."</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;forgive."</p>

<p>"Can you not forget, too?"</p>

<p>"I will try&mdash;with your help."</p>

<p>"How can I help you? Tell me."</p>

<p>"By letting me love you&mdash;as wisely as I can&mdash;in my own fashion.
By letting me learn more of you&mdash;more about men. I don't understand
men. I thought I did&mdash;but I don't. By letting me find out what
is the wisest and the best and the most unselfish way to love
you. For I don't know yet. I don't know. All I know is that I
am married to the man I loved&mdash;the man I still love. But how I
am going to love him I &mdash;I don't yet know."</p>

<p>He was silent; the hot flush on his face did not seem to warm
her cheek where it rested so coldly against his.</p>

<p>"I want to hold you because it is best for us both," she said,
as though speaking to herself.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you need make no effort to hold me, Jacqueline!" e protested,
amazed.</p>

<p>"I want to hold you, Jim," she repeated. "You are my husband.
I &mdash;I must hold you. And I don't know how I am to do it.
I don't know how."</p>

<p>"My darling! Who has been talking to you? What have they said?"</p>

<p>"It has <em>got</em> to be done, somehow," she interrupted, wearily.
"I must learn how to hold you; and you must give me time, Jim&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Give you time!" he repeated, exasperated.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to learn how to love you best&mdash;so I can serve you best.
That is why I married you&mdash;not selfishly, Jim&mdash;and I thought I
knew &mdash;I thought I knew&#11834;"</p>

<p>Her cheek slipped from his and rested on his shoulder. He put
his arm around her and she covered her face with her gloved hands.</p>

<p>"I love you dearly, dearly," he whispered brokenly. "If the whisper
of any past stupidity of mine has hurt you, God knows best what
punishment He visits on me at this moment! If there were any torture
I could endure to spare you, Jacqueline, I would beg for it&mdash;welcome
it! It is a bitter and a hopeless and a ridiculous thing to say;
but if I had only known there was such a woman as you in the world
I would have understood better how to live. I suppose many a man
understands it when it is too late. I realise now, for the first
time, how changeless, how irrevocably fixed, are the truths youth
learns to smile at&mdash;the immutable laws youth scoffs at&#11834;"</p>

<p>He choked, controlled his voice, and went on:</p>

<p>"If youth could only understand it, the truths of childhood are
the only truths. The first laws we learn are the eternal ones.
And their only meaning is self-discipline. But youth is restive
and mistakes curiosity for intelligence, insubordination for the
courage of independence. The stupidity of orthodoxy incites revolt.
To disregard becomes less difficult; to forget becomes a habit.
To think for one's self seems admirable; but when youth attempts
that, it thinks only what it pleases or does not think at all.
I am not trying to find excuses or to evade my responsibility,
dear. I had every chance, no excuse for what I have&mdash;sometimes&mdash;been.
And now&mdash;on this day&mdash;this most blessed and most solemn day of
my life &mdash;I can only say to you I am sorry, and that I mean
so to live&mdash;always&mdash;that no man or woman can reproach me."</p>

<p>She lay very silent against his shoulder. Blindly striving to
understand him, and men&mdash;blindly searching for some clue to the
path of duty&mdash;the path she must find somehow and follow for his
sake&mdash;through the obscurity and mental confusion she seemed to
hear at moments Elena Clydesdale's shameless and merciless words,
and the deadly repetition seemed to stun her.</p>

<p>Vainly she strove against the recurring horror; once or twice,
unconsciously, her hands crept upward and closed her ears, as
though she could shut out what was dinning in her brain.</p>

<p>With every reserve atom of mental strength and self-control she
battled against this thing which was stupefying her, fought it
off, held it, drove it back&mdash;not very far, but far enough to give
her breathing room. But no sooner did she attempt to fix her mind
on the man beside her, and begin once more to grope for the clue
to duty&mdash;how most unselfishly she might serve him for his salvation
and her own&mdash;than the horror she had driven back stirred stealthily
and crawled nearer. And the battle was on once more.</p>

<p>Twilight had fallen over the Westchester hills; a familiar country
lay along the road they travelled. In the early darkness, glancing
from the windows he divined unseen landmarks, counted the miles
unconsciously as the car sped across invisible bridges that clattered
or resounded under the heavy wheels.</p>

<p>The stars came out; against them woodlands and hills took shadowy
shape, marking for him remembered haunts. And at last, far across
the hills the lighted windows of Silverwood glimmered all a-row;
the wet gravel crunched under the slowing wheels, tall Norway
spruces towered phantomlike on every side; the car stopped.</p>

<p>"Home," he whispered to her; and she rested her arm on his shoulder
and drew herself erect.</p>

<p>Every servant and employee on the Desboro estate was there to
receive them; she offered her slim hand and spoke to every one.
Then, on her husband's arm, and her proud little head held high,
she entered the House of Desboro for the first time bearing the
family name&mdash;entered smiling, with death in her heart.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>At last the dinner was at an end. Farris served the coffee and
set the silver lamp and cigarettes on the library table, and retired.</p>

<p>Luminous red shadows from the fireplace played over wall and
ceiling&mdash;the same fireplace where Desboro had made his offering&mdash;as
though flame could purify and ashes end the things that men have
done!</p>

<p>In her frail dinner gown of lace, she lay in a great chair before
the blaze, gazing at nothing. He, seated on the rug beside her
chair, held her limp hand and rested his face against it, staring
at the ashes on the hearth.</p>

<p>And this was marriage! Thus he was beginning his wedded life&mdash;here
in the house of his fathers, here at the same hearthstone where
the dead brides of dead forebears had sat as his bride was sitting
now.</p>

<p>But had any bride ever before faced that hearth so silent, so
motionless, so pale as was this young girl whose fingers rested
so limply in his and whose cold palm grew no warmer against his
cheek?</p>

<p>What had he done to her? What had he done to himself&mdash;that the
joy of things had died out in her eyes&mdash;that speech had died on
her lips&mdash;that nothing in her seemed alive, nothing responded,
nothing stirred.</p>

<p>Now, all the bitterness that life and its unwisdom had stored
up for him through the swift and reckless years, he tasted. For
that cup may not pass. Somewhere, sooner or later, the same lips
that have so lightly emptied sweeter draughts must drain this
one. None may refuse it, none wave it away until the cup be empty.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>She moved slightly in her chair.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "what is it that can make amends?"</p>

<p>"They&mdash;are made."</p>

<p>"But the hurt is still there. What can heal it, dear?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know."</p>

<p>"Time?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Love?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in time."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Jim."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what is there for me to do?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Have patience&mdash;with me."</p>

<p>"With <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"It will be necessary."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, dear?"</p>

<p>"I mean you must have patience with me&mdash;in many ways. And still
be in love with me. And still be loyal to me&mdash;and&mdash;faithful. I
don't know whether a man can do these things. I don't know men.
But I know myself&mdash;and what I require of men&mdash;and of you."</p>

<p>"What you require of me I can be if you love me."</p>

<p>"Then never doubt it. And when I know that you have become what
I require you to be, you could not doubt my loving you even if
you wished to. <em>Then</em> you will know; <em>until</em> then&mdash;you
must <em>believe</em>."</p>

<p>He sat thinking before the hearth, the slow flush rising to his
temples and remaining.</p>

<p>"What is it you mean to do, Jacqueline?" he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing, except what I have always done. The business of life
remains unchanged; it is always there to be done."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;are you going to&mdash;change&mdash;toward me?"</p>

<p>"I have not changed."</p>

<p>"Your confidence in me has gone."</p>

<p>"I have recovered it."</p>

<p>"You believe in me still?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes!" Her little hand inside his clenched convulsively
and her voice broke.</p>

<p>Kneeling beside her, he drew her into his arms and felt her breath
suddenly hot and feverish against his shoulder. But if there had
been tears in her eyes they dried unshed, for he saw no traces
of them when he kissed her.</p>

<p>"In God's name," he whispered, "let the past bury its accursed
dead and give me a chance. I love you, worship you, adore you.
Give me my chance in life again, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I give it to you&mdash;as far as in me lies. But it rests
with you, Jim, what you will be."</p>

<p>His own philosophy returned to mock him out of the stainless
mouth of this young girl! But he said passionately:</p>

<p>"How can I be arbiter of my own fate unless I have all you can
give me of love and faith and unswerving loyalty?"</p>

<p>"I give you these."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;as a sign&mdash;return the kiss I give you&mdash;now."</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>"Can you not, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you can not respond!"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;that way&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;have <em>I&mdash;</em>has what you know of me killed all feeling,
all tenderness in you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;why can you not respond&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I can not, Jim &mdash;I can not."</p>

<p>He flushed hotly: "Do you&mdash;do I inspire you with&mdash;do I repel
you&mdash;physically?"</p>

<p>She caught his hand, cheeks afire, dismayed, striving to check
him:</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;don't say such&mdash;it is&mdash;not&mdash;true&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It seems to be&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No! I &mdash;I ask you&mdash;not to say it&mdash;think it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How can I help thinking it&mdash;thinking that you only care for
me&mdash;that the only attraction on your part is&mdash;is intellectual&#11834;"</p>

<p>She disengaged her hand from his and shrank away into the velvet
depths of her chair.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," he said. "I've got to say what I think. Never
since I have told you I loved you have you ever hinted at any
response, even to the lightest caress. We are married. Whatever&mdash;however
foolish I may have been &mdash;God knows you have made me pay
for it this day. How long am I to continue paying? I tell you
a man can't remain repentant too long under the stern and chilling
eyes of retribution. If you are going to treat me as though I
were physically unfit to touch, I can make no further protest.
But, Jacqueline, no man was ever aided by a punishment that wounds
his self-respect."</p>

<p>"I must consider mine, too," she said, in a ghost of a voice.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "if you think you must maintain it at the
expense of mine&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>The low cry left her lips trembling.</p>

<p>"What?" he said, angrily.</p>

<p>"Have&mdash;have you already forgotten what I said?"</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"I asked&mdash;I asked you to be patient with me&mdash;because &mdash;I
love you&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the words halted; she bowed her head in her hands, quivering,
scarcely conscious that he was on his knees again at her feet,
scarcely hearing his broken words of repentance and shame for
the sorry and contemptible rôle he had been playing.</p>

<p>No tears came to help her even then, only a dry, still agony
possessed her. But the crisis passed and wore away; sight and
hearing and the sense of touch returned to her. She saw his head
bowed in contrition on her knees, heard his voice, bitter in self-accusation,
felt his hands crisping over hers, crushing them till her new
rings cut her.</p>

<p>For a while she looked down at him as though dazed; then the
real pain from her wedding ring aroused her and she gently withdrew
that hand and rested it on his thick, short, curly hair.</p>

<p>For a long while they remained so. He had ceased to speak; her
brooding gaze rested on him, unchanged save for the subtle tenderness
of the lips, which still quivered at moments.</p>

<p>Clocks somewhere in the house were striking midnight. A little
later a log fell from the dying fire, breaking in ashes.</p>

<p>He felt her stir, change her position slightly; and he lifted
his head. After a moment she laid her hand on his arm, and he
aided her to rise.</p>

<p>As they moved slowly, side by side, through the house, they saw
that it was filled with flowers everywhere, twisted ropes of them
on the banisters, too, where they ascended.</p>

<p>Her own maid, who had arrived by train, rose from a seat in the
upper corridor to meet her. The two rooms, which were connected
by a sitting room, disclosed themselves, almost smothered in flowers.</p>

<p>Jacqueline stood in the sitting room for a moment, gazing vaguely
around her at the flowers and steadying herself by one hand on
the centre-table, which a great bowlful of white carnations almost
covered.</p>

<p>Then, as her maid reappeared at the door of her room, she turned
and looked at Desboro.</p>

<p>There was a silence; his face was very white, hers was deathly.</p>

<p>He said: "Shall we say good-night?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;for you&mdash;to say."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;good-night, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She turned ... looked back, hesitated"]</p>

<p>She turned, took a step or two&mdash;looked back, hesitated, then
slowly retraced her steps to where he was standing by the flower-covered
table.</p>

<p>From the mass of blossoms she drew a white carnation, touched
it to her lips, and, eyes still lowered, offered it to him. In
her palm, beside it, lay a key. But he took only the blossom,
touching it to his lips as she had done.</p>

<p>She looked at the key, lying in her trembling hand, then lifted
her confused eyes to his once more, whispering:</p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;and thank you."</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said, "until to-morrow."</p>

<p>And they went their separate ways.</p>
