		<p>The Sun now rose upon the right:<br />
			Out of the sea came he,<br />
			Still hid in mist, and on the left<br />
			Went down into the sea.
		</p>
		<p>And the good south wind still blew behind<br />
			But no sweet bird did follow,<br />
			Nor any day for food or play<br />
			Came to the mariners' hollo!
		</p>
		<p>And I had done an hellish thing,<br />
			And it would work 'em woe:<br />
			For all averred, I had killed the bird<br />
			That made the breeze to blow.<br />
			Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay<br />
			That made the breeze to blow!
		</p>
		<p>Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,<br />
			The glorious Sun uprist:<br />
			Then all averred, I had killed the bird<br />
			That brought the fog and mist.<br />
			'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<br />
			That bring the fog and mist.
		</p>
		<p>The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,<br />
			The furrow followed free:<br />
			We were the first that ever burst<br />
			Into that silent sea.
		</p>
		<p>Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,<br />
			'Twas sad as sad could be;<br />
			And we did speak only to break<br />
			The silence of the sea!
		</p>
		<p>All in a hot and copper sky,<br />
			The bloody Sun, at noon,<br />
			Right up above the mast did stand,<br />
			No bigger than the Moon.
		</p>
		<p>Day after day, day after day,<br />
			We stuck, nor breath nor motion;<br />
			As idle as a painted ship<br />
			Upon a painted ocean.
		</p>
		<p>Water, water, every where,<br />
			And all the boards did shrink;<br />
			Water, water, every where,<br />
			Nor any drop to drink.
		</p>
		<p>The very deep did rot: O Christ!<br />
			That ever this should be!<br />
			Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br />
			Upon the slimy sea.
		</p>
		<p>About, about, in reel and rout<br />
			The death-fires danced at night;<br />
			The water, like a witch's oils,<br />
			Burnt green, and blue and white.
		</p>
		<p>And some in dreams assured were<br />
			Of the spirit that plagued us so:<br />
			Nine fathom deep he had followed us<br />
			From the land of mist and snow.
		</p>
		<p>And every tongue, through utter drought,<br />
			Was withered at the root;<br />
			We could not speak, no more than if<br />
			We had been choked with soot.
		</p>
		<p>Ah! well a-day! what evil looks<br />
			Had I from old and young!<br />
			Instead of the cross, the Albatross<br />
			About my neck was hung.
