<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My readers have now been steadily at Oxford for six months without
moving. Most people find such a spell of the place without a change
quite as much as they care to take; perhaps too, it may do our
hero good to let him alone for a little, that he may have time
to look steadily into the pit which he has been so near falling
down, which is still yawning awkwardly in his path; moreover,
the exigencies of a story teller must lead him away from home
now and then. Like the rest of us, his family must have change
of air, or he has to go off to see a friend properly married,
or a connexion buried; to wear white or black gloves with or for
some one, carrying such sympathy as he can with him, so that he
may come back from every journey, however short, with a wider
horizon. Yes; to come back home after every stage of life's journeying
with a wider horizon&mdash;more in sympathy with men and nature, knowing
ever more of the righteous and eternal laws which govern them,
and of the righteous and loving will which is above all, and around
all, and beneath all&mdash;this must be the end and aim of all of us,
or we shall be wandering about blindfold, and spending time and
labor and journey-money on that which profiteth nothing. So now
I must ask my readers to forget the old buildings and quadrangles
of the fairest of England's cities, the caps and the gowns, the
reading and rowing for a short space, and take a flight with me
to other scenes and pastures new.</p>

<p>The nights are pleasant in May, short and pleasant for travel.
We will leave the ancient city asleep, and do our flight in the
night to save time. Trust yourself then to the story-teller's
aerial machine. It is but a rough affair, I own, rough and humble,
unfitted for high or great flights, with no gilded panels or dainty
cushions, or C-springs&mdash;not that we shall care about springs,
by the way, until we alight on terra firma again&mdash;still, there
is much to be learned in a third-class carriage if we will only
not look while in it for cushions and fine panels, and forty miles
an hour traveling, and will not be shocked at our fellow passengers
for being weak in their h's and smelling of fustian. Mount in
it, then, you who will, after this warning; the fares are holiday
fares, the tickets return tickets. Take with you nothing but the
poet's luggage,</p>

<p>   "A smile for Hope, a tear for Pain,    A breath to swell the
voice of Prayer."</p>

<p>and may you have a pleasant journey, for it is time that the
stoker should be looking to his going gear.</p>

<p>So now we rise slowly in the moonlight from St. Ambrose's quadrangle,
and, when we are clear of the clock-tower, steer away southwards,
over Oxford city and all its sleeping wisdom and folly, over street
and past spire, over Christ Church and the canons' houses, and
the fountain in Tom quad; over St. Aldate's and the river, along
which the moonbeams lie in a pathway of twinkling silver, over
the railway sheds&mdash;no, there was then no railway, but only the
quiet fields and footpaths of Hincksey hamlet. Well, no matter;
at any rate, the hills beyond, and Bagley Wood, were there then
as now; and over hills and wood we rise, catching the purr of
the night-jar, the trill of the nightingale, and the first crow
of the earliest cock-pheasant, as he stretches his jewelled wings,
conscious of his strength and his beauty, heedless of the fellows
of St. John's, who slumber within sight of his perch, on whose
hospitable board he shall one day lie, prone on his back, with
fair larded breast turned upwards for the carving-knife, having
crowed his last crow. He knows it not; what matters it to him?
If he knew it, could a Bagley Wood cock-pheasant desire a better
ending?</p>

<p>We pass over the vale beyond; hall and hamlet, church, and meadow,
and copse, folded in mist and shadow below us, each hamlet holding
in its bosom the material of three volumed novels by the dozen,
if we could only pull off the roofs of the houses and look steadily
into the interiors; but our destination is farther yet. The faint
white streak behind the distant Chilterns reminds us that we have
no time for gossip by the way; May nights are short, and the sun
will be up by four. No matter; our journey will now be soon over,
for the broad vale is crossed, and the chalk hills and downs beyond.
Larks quiver up by us, "higher, ever higher," hastening up to
get a first glimpse of the coming monarch, careless of food, flooding
the fresh air with song. Steadily plodding rooks labour along
below us, and lively starlings rush by on the look-out for the
early worm; lark and swallow, rook and starling, each on his appointed
round. The sun arises, and they get them to it; he is up now,
and these breezy uplands over which we hang are swimming in the
light of horizontal rays, though the shadows and mists still lie
on the wooded dells which slope away southwards.</p>

<p>Here let us bring to, over the village of Englebourn, and try
to get acquainted with the outside of the place before the good
folk are about, and we have to go down among them and their sayings
and doings.</p>

<p>The village lies on the southern slopes of the Berkshire hills,
on the opposite side to that under which our hero was born. Another
soil altogether is here, we remark in the first place. This is
no chalk; this high knoll which rises above&mdash;one may almost say
hangs over&mdash;the village, crowned with Scotch firs, its sides tufted
with gorse and heather. It is the Hawk's Lynch, the favorite resort
of Englebourn folk, who come up for the view, for the air, because
their fathers and mothers came up before them, because they came
up themselves as children&mdash;from an instinct which moves them all
in leisure hours and Sunday evenings, when the sun shines and
the birds sing, whether they care for view or air or not. Something
guides all their feet hitherward; the children, to play hide-and-seek
and look for nests in the gorse-bushes; young men and maidens,
to saunter and look and talk, as they will till the world's end&mdash;or
as long, at any rate, as the Hawk's Lynch and Englebourn last&mdash;and
to cut their initials, enclosed in a true lover's knot, on the
short rabbit's turf; steady married couples, to plod along together
consulting on hard times and growing families; even old tottering
men, who love to sit at the feet of the firs, with chins leaning
on their sticks, prattling of days long past, to anyone who will
listen, or looking silently with dim eyes into the summer air,
feeling perhaps in their spirits after a wider and more peaceful
view which will soon open for them. A common knoll, open to all,
up in the silent air, well away from every-day Englebourn life,
with the Hampshire range and the distant Beacon Hill lying soft
on the horizon, and nothing higher between you and the southern
sea, what a blessing the Hawk's Lynch is to the village folk,
one and all! May Heaven and a thankless soil long preserve it
and them from an enclosure under the Act!</p>

<p>There is much temptation lying about, though, for the enclosers
of the world. The rough common land stretches over the whole of
the knoll, and down to its base, and away along the hills behind,
of which the Hawk's Lynch is an outlying spur. Rough common land,
broken only by pine woods of a few acres each in extent, an occasional
woodman's or squatter's cottage and little patch of attempted
garden. But immediately below, and on each flank of the spur,
and half-way up the slopes, come small farm enclosures, breaking
here and there the belt of woodlands, which generally lies between
the rough wild upland, and the cultivated country below. As you
stand on the knoll you can see common land just below you at its
foot narrow into a mere road, with a border of waste on each side
which runs into Englebourn street. At the end of the straggling
village stands the church with its square tower, a lofty grey
stone building, with bits of fine decorated architecture about
it, but much of churchwarden Gothic supervening. The churchyard
is large, and the graves, as you can see plainly even from this
distance, are all crowded on the southern side. The rector's sheep
are feeding in the northern part, nearest to us, and a small gate
at one corner opens into his garden. The Rectory looks large and
comfortable, and its grounds well cared for and extensive, with
a rookery of elms at the lawn's end. It is the chief house of
the place, for there is no resident squire. The principal street
contains a few shops, some dozen, perhaps, in all; and several
farm houses lie a little back from it, with gardens in front,
and yards and barns and orchards behind; and there are two public-houses.
The other dwellings are mere cottages, and very bad ones for the
most part, with floors below the level of the street. Almost every
house in the village is thatched, which adds to the beauty though
not to the comfort of the place. The rest of the population who
do not live in the street are dotted about the neighboring lanes,
chiefly towards the west, on our right as we look down from the
Hawk's Lynch. On this side the country is more open, and here
most of the farmers live, as we may see by the number of homesteads.
And there is a small brook on that side too, which with careful
damming is made to turn a mill, there where you see the clump
of poplars. On our left as we look down, the country to the east
of the village is thickly wooded; but we can see that there is
a village green on that side, and a few scattered cottages, the
farthest of which stands looking out like a little white eye,
from the end of a dense copse.</p>

<p>Beyond it there is no sign of habitation for some two miles;
then you can see the tall chimneys of a great house, and a well
timbered park round it. The Grange is not in Englebourn parish&mdash;happily
for that parish, one is sorry to remark. It must be a very bad
squire who does not do more good than harm by living in a country
village. But there are very bad squires, and the owner of the
Grange is one of them. He is, however, for the most part, an absentee,
so that we are little concerned with him, and in fact, have only
to notice this one of his bad habits, that he keeps that long
belt of woodlands, which runs into Englebourn parish, and comes
almost up to the village, full of hares and pheasants. He has
only succeeded to the property some three or four years, and yet
the head of game on the estate, and above all in the woods, has
trebled or quadrupled. Pheasants by hundreds are reared under
hens, from eggs bought in London, and run about the keepers' houses
as tame as barn door fowls all the summer. When the first party
comes down for the first <em>battue</em> early in October, it
is often as much as the beaters can do to persuade these pampered
fowls that they are wild game, whose duty it is to get up and
fly away, and be shot at. However, they soon learn more of the
world&mdash;such of them, at least, as are not slain&mdash;and are unmistakable
wild birds in a few days. Then they take to roosting farther from
their old haunts, more in the outskirts of the woods, and the
time comes for others besides the squire's guests to take their
education in hand, and teach pheasants at least that they are
no native British birds. These are a wild set, living scattered
about the wild country; turf-cutters, broom-makers, squatters,
with indefinite occupations, and nameless habits, a race hated
of keepers and constables. These have increased and flourished
of late years; and, notwithstanding the imprisonments and transportations
which deprive them periodically of the most enterprising members
of their community, one and all give thanks for the day when the
owner of the Grange took to pheasant breeding. If the demoralization
stopped with them, little harm might come of it, as they would
steal fowls in the homesteads if there were no pheasants in the
woods&mdash;which latter are less dangerous to get, and worth more
when gotten. But, unhappily, this method of earning a livelihood
has strong attractions, and is catching; and the cases of farm
labourers who get into trouble about game are more frequent season
by season in the neighbouring parishes, and Englebourn is no better
than the rest. And the men are not likely to be much discouraged
from these practices, or taught better by the fanners; for, if
there is one thing more than another that drives that sturdy set
of men, the Englebourn yeomen, into a frenzy, it is talk of the
game in the Grange covers. Not that they dislike sport; they like
it too well, and, moreover, have been used to their fair share
of it. For the late squire left the game entirely in their hands.
"You know best how much game your land will carry without serious
damage to the crops," he used to say. "I like to show my friends
a fair day's sport when they are with me, and have enough game
to supply the house and make a few presents. Beyond that, it is
no affair of mine. You can course whenever you like; and let me
know when you want a day's shooting, and you shall have it." Under
this system the yeomen became keen sportsmen; they and all their
labourers took a keen interest in preserving, and the whole district
would have risen on a poacher. The keeper's place became a sinecure,
and the squire had as much game as he wanted without expense,
and was, moreover, the most popular man in the county. Even after
the new man came, and all was changed, the mere revocation of
their sporting liberties, and the increase of game, unpopular
as these things were, would not alone have made the farmers so
bitter, and have raised that sense of outraged justice in them.
But with these changes came in a custom new in the country&mdash;the
custom of selling the game. At first the report was not believed;
but soon it became notorious that no head of game from the Grange
estates was ever given away, that not only did the tenants never
get a brace of birds or a hare, or the labourers a rabbit, but
not one of the gentlemen who helped to kill the game ever found
any of the bag in his dog-cart after the day's shooting. Nay,
so shameless had the system become, and so highly was the art
of turning the game to account cultivated at the Grange, that
the keepers sold powder and shot to any of the guests who had
emptied their own belts or flasks at something over the market
retail price. The light cart drove to the market-town twice a
week in the season, loaded heavily with game, but more heavily
with the hatred and scorn of the farmers; and, if deep and bitter
curses could break patent axles or necks, the new squire and his
game-cart would not long have vexed the countryside. As it was,
not a man but his own tenants would salute him in the market-place;
and these repaid themselves for the unwilling courtesy by bitter
reflections on a squire who was mean enough to pay his butcher's
and poulterer's bills out of their pockets.</p>

<p>Alas that the manly instinct of sport which is so strong in all
of us Englishmen&mdash;which sends Oswells single handed against the
mightiest beasts that walk the earth, and takes the poor cockney
journeyman out a ten miles' walk almost before daylight, on the
rare summer holiday mornings, to angle with rude tackle in reservoir
or canal&mdash;should be dragged through such mire as this in many
an English shire in our day. If English landlords want to go on
shooting game much longer, they must give up selling it. For if
selling game becomes the rule, and not the exception (as it seems
likely to do before long), good-bye to sport in England. Every
man who loves his country more than his pleasure or his pocket&mdash;and,
thank God, that includes the great majority of us yet, however
much we may delight in gun and rod, let any demagogue in the land
say what he pleases&mdash;will cry, "Down with it," and lend a hand
to put it down for ever.</p>

<p>But to return to our perch on the Hawk's Lynch above Englebourn
village. The rector is the fourth of his race who holds the family
living&mdash;a kind, easy-going, gentlemanly old man, a Doctor of Divinity,
as becomes his position, though he only went into orders because
there was the living ready for him. In his day he had been a good
magistrate and neighbour, living with and much in the same way
as the squires round about. But his contemporaries had dropped
off one by one; his own health had long been failing; his wife
was dead; and the young generation did not seek him. His work
and the parish had no real hold on him; so he had nothing to fall
back on, and had become a confirmed invalid, seldom leaving the
house and garden even to go to church, and thinking more of his
dinner and his health than of all other things in earth or heaven.</p>

<p>The only child who remained at home with him was a daughter,
a girl of nineteen or thereabouts, whose acquaintance we shall
make presently, and who was doing all that a good heart and sound
head prompted in nursing an old hypochondriac, and filling his
place in the parish. But though the old man was weak and selfish,
he was kind in his way, and ready to give freely or do anything
that his daughter suggested for the good of his people, provided
the trouble were taken off his shoulders. In the year before our
tale opens, he had allowed some thirty acres of his glebe to be
parcelled out in allotments amongst the poor; and his daughter
spent almost what she pleased in clothing-clubs, and sick-clubs,
and the school, without a word from him. Whenever he did remonstrate,
she managed to get what she wanted out of the house-money, or
her own allowance.</p>

<p>We must make acquaintance with such other of the inhabitants
as it concerns us to know in the course of the story; for it is
broad daylight, and the villagers will be astir directly. Folk
who go to bed before nine, after a hard day's work, get into the
habit of turning out soon after the sun calls them. So now, descending
from the Hawk's Lynch, we will alight at the east end of Englebourn,
opposite the little white cottage which looks out at the end of
the great wood, near the village green.</p>

<p>Soon after five on that bright Sunday morning, Harry Winburn
unbolted the door of his mother's cottage, and stepped out in
his shirt-sleeves on to the little walk in front, paved with pebbles.
Perhaps some of my readers will recognize the name of an old acquaintance,
and wonder how he got here; so let us explain at once. Soon after
our hero went to school, Harry's father had died of a fever. He
had been a journeyman blacksmith, and in the receipt, consequently,
of rather better wages than generally fall to the lot of the peasantry,
but not enough to leave much of a margin over current expenditure.
Moreover, the Winburns had always been open-handed with whatever
money they had; so that all he left for his widow and child, of
worldly goods, was their "few sticks" of furniture, L5 in the
savings bank, and the money from his burial-club which was not
more than enough to give him a creditable funeral&mdash;that object
of honorable ambition to all the independent poor. He left, however,
another inheritance to them, which is in price above rubies, neither
shall silver be named in comparison thereof,&mdash;the inheritance
of an honest name, of which his widow was proud, and which was
not likely to suffer in her hands.</p>

<p>After the funeral, she removed to Englebourn, her own native
village, and kept her old father's house till his death. He was
one of the woodmen to the Grange, and lived in the cottage at
the corner of the wood in which his work lay. When he, too, died,
hard times came on Widow Winburn. The steward allowed her to keep
on the cottage. The rent was a sore burden to her, but she would
sooner have starved than leave it. Parish relief was out of the
question for her father's child and her husband's widow; so she
turned her hand to every odd job which offered, and went to work
in the fields when nothing else could be had. Whenever there was
sickness in the place, she was an untiring nurse; and, at one
time, for some nine months, she took the office of postman, and
walked daily some nine miles through a severe winter. The fatigue
and exposure had broken down her health, and made her an old woman
before her time. At last, in a lucky hour, the Doctor came to
hear of her praiseworthy struggles, and gave her the Rectory washing,
which had made her life a comparatively easy one again.</p>

<p>During all this time her poor neighbors had stood by her as the
poor do stand by one another, helping her in numberless small
ways, so that she had been able to realize the great object of
her life, and keep Harry at school till he was nearly fourteen.
By this time he had learned all that the village pedagogue could
teach, and had in fact become an object of mingled pride and jealousy
to that worthy man, who had his misgivings lest Harry's fame as
a scholar should eclipse his own before many years were over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winburn's character was so good, that no sooner was her
son ready for a place than a place was ready for him; he stepped
at once into the dignity of carter's boy, and his earnings, when
added to his mother's, made them comfortable enough. Of course
she was wrapped up in him, and believed that there was no such
boy in the parish. And indeed she was nearer the truth than most
mothers, for he soon grew into a famous specimen of a countryman;
tall and lithe, full of nervous strength, and not yet bowed down
or stiffened by the constant toil of a labourer's daily life.
In these matters, however, he had rivals in the village; but in
intellectual accomplishments he was unrivalled. He was full of
learning according to the village standard, could write and cipher
well, was fond of reading such books as came in his way, and spoke
his native English almost without an accent. He is one-and-twenty
at the time when our story takes him up; a thoroughly skilled
labourer, the best hedger and ditcher in the parish; and, when
his blood is up, he can shear twenty sheep in a day, without razing
the skin, or mow for sixteen hours at a stretch, with rests of
half an hour for meals twice in the day.</p>

<p>Harry shaded his eyes with his hand for a minute, as he stood
outside the cottage drinking in the fresh, pure air, laden with
the scent of the honeysuckle which he had trained over the porch,
and listening to the chorus of linnets and finches from the copse
at the back of the house; he then set about the household duties,
which he always made it a point of honour to attend to himself
on Sundays. First he unshuttered the little lattice-window of
the room on the ground floor; a simple enough operation, for the
shutter was a mere wooden flap, which was closed over the window
at night and bolted with a wooden bolt on the outside, and thrown
back against the wall in the daytime. Any one who would could
have opened it at any moment of the night; but the poor sleep
sound without bolts. Then he took the one old bucket of the establishment,
and strode away to the well on the village green, and filled it
with clear, cold water, doing the same kind office for the vessels
of two or three rosy little damsels and boys, of ages varying
from ten to fourteen, who were already astir, and to whom the
winding-up of the parish chain and bucket would have been a work
of difficulty. Returning to the cottage, he proceeded to fill
his mother's kettle, sweep the hearth, strike a light, and make
up the fire with a faggot from the little stack in the corner
of the garden. Then he hauled the three-legged round table before
the fire, and dusted it carefully over, and laid out the black
Japan tea-tray with two delf cups and saucers of gorgeous pattern,
and diminutive plates to match, and placed the sugar and slop
basins, the big loaf and small piece of salt butter, in their
accustomed places, and the little black teapot on the hob to get
properly warm. There was little more to be done indoors, for the
furniture was scanty enough; but everything in turn received its
fair share of attention, and the little room, with its sunken
tiled floor and yellow-washed walls, looked cheerful and homely.
Then Harry turned his attention to the shed of his own contriving,
which stood beside the faggot-stack, and from which expostulatory
and plaintive grunts had been issuing ever since his first appearance
at the door, telling of a faithful and useful friend who was sharp
set on Sunday mornings, and desired his poor breakfast, and to
be dismissed for the day to pick up the rest of his livelihood
with his brethren porkers of the village on the green and in the
lanes. Harry served out to the porker the poor mess which the
wash of the cottage and the odds and ends of the little garden
afforded; which that virtuous animal forthwith began to discuss
with both fore-feet in the trough&mdash;by way, probably, of adding
to the flavor&mdash;while his master scratched him gently between the
ears and on the back with a short stick till the repast was concluded.
Then he opened the door of the stye, and the grateful animal rushed
out into the lane, and away to the green with a joyful squeal
and flirt of his hind-quarters in the air; and Harry, after picking
a bunch of wall-flowers, and pansies, and hyacinths, a line of
which flowers skirted the narrow garden walk, and putting them
in a long-necked glass which he took from the mantel-piece, proceeded
to his morning ablutions, ample materials for which remained at
the bottom of the family bucket, which he had put down on a little
bench by the side of the porch. These finished, he retired indoors
to shave and dress himself.</p>
