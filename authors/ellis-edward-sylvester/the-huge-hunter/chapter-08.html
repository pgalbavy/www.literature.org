<p><em>THE STEAM </em>man was headed straight toward the emigrant
train, and advanced at a speed which rapidly came up with it.</p>

<p>They could see, while yet a considerable distance away, that
they had attracted notice, and the emigrants had paused and ware
surveying them with a wonder which it would be difficult to express.</p>

<p>It is said that when Robert Fulton's first steamboat ascended
the Hudson, it created a consternation and terror such as had
never before been known, many believing that it was the harbinger
of the final destruction of the world.</p>

<p>Of course, at this late day, no such excitement can be created
by any human invention, but the sight of a creature speeding over
the country, impelled by steam, and bearing such a grotesque resemblance
to a gigantic man, could not but startle all who should see it
for the first time.</p>

<p>The steam man advanced at a rate which was quite moderate, until
within a quarter of a mile of the astonished train, when the boy
let on a full head of steam and instantly bounded forward like
a meteor. As it came opposite the amazed company, the whistle
was palled, and it-gave forth a shriek hideous enough to set a
man crazy.</p>

<p>The horses and animals of the emigrant train could be seen rearing
and plunging, while the men stood too appalled to do anything
except gaze in stupid and speechless amazement.</p>

<p>There were one or two, however, who had sense enough to perceive
that there was nothing at all very supernatural about it, and
they shouted to them to halt; but our two friends concluded it
was not desirable to have any company, and they only slackened
their speed, without halting.</p>

<p>But there was one of the emigrants who determined to know something
more about it and, mounting his horse, he started after it on
a full run. The trapper did not perceive him until he had approached
quite close, when they again put on a full head of steam, and
they went bounding forward at a rate which threatened to tear
them to pieces.</p>

<p>But the keen perception of the boy had detected what they were
able to do without real risk: and, without putting his invention
to its very best, he kept up a speed which steadily drew them
away from their pursuer, who finally became discouraged, checked
his animal, and turned round and rode back to his friends, a not
much wiser man.</p>

<p>This performance gave our friends great delight. It showed them
that they were really the owners of a prize whose value was incalculable.</p>

<p>'Ef the old thing will only last,' said Baldy, when they had
sunk down to a moderate trot again.</p>

<p>'What's to binder?'</p>

<p>'Dunno; yer oughter be able to tell. But these new-fangled things
generally go well at first, and then, afore yer know it, they
bust all to blazes.'</p>

<p>'No fear of this. I made this fellow so big that there is plenty
of room to have everything strong and give it a chance to work.'</p>

<p>'Wal, you're the smartest feller I ever seen, big or little.
Whoever heard of a man going by steam?'</p>

<p>'I have, often; but I never saw it. I expect when I go back to
make steam horses.'</p>

<p>'And birds, I s'pose?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so; it will take some time to get such things in shape,
but I hope to do it after awhile.'</p>

<p>'Skulp me! but thar must be some things that you can't do, and
I think you've mentioned 'em.</p>

<p>'Perhaps so,' was the quiet reply. 'When you git through with
this 'Western trip, what are you goin' to do with this old feller?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. I may sell him, if anybody wants him.'</p>

<p>'No fear of that; I'll take him off your hands, and give you
a good price for him.'</p>

<p>'What good will' he do you?'</p>

<p>'Why, you can make more money with him than Barnum ever did with
his Woolly Home.'</p>

<p>'How so?' inquired the boy, with great simplicity.</p>

<p>'Take him through the country and show him to the people. I tell
yer they'd run after such things. Get out yer pictures of him,
and the folks would break thar necks to see him. I tell yer, thar's
a fortune thar!'</p>

<p>The trapper spoke emphatically like one who knows.</p>

<p>As it was growing dusk, they deemed it best to look for some
camping-place. There was considerable danger in running at night,
as there was no moon, and they might run into some gully or ravine
and dislocate or wrench some portion of their machinery, which
might result in an irreparable catastrophe.</p>

<p>Before it was fairly dark they headed toward a small clump of
trees, where everything looked favorable.</p>

<p>'You see we must find a place where there is plenty water and
fuel, for we need both,' remarked the boy.</p>

<p>'Thar's plenty of wood, as yer see with yer eyes,' replied Baldy,
'and when trees look as keen as that, thar's purty sure sign thar's
water not fur off.'</p>

<p>'That's all we want,' was the observation of the engineer as
he headed toward the point indicated.</p>

<p>Things were growing quite indistinct, when the steam man gave
its last puff, and came to rest in the margin of the grove. The
fires were instantly drawn, and every-thing was put in as good
shape as possible, by the boy, while the trapper made a tour of
examination through the grove. He came back with the report that
everything was as they wished.</p>

<p>'Thar's a big stream of water runnin' right through the middle,
and yer can see the wood fur yourself.'</p>

<p>'Any signs of Indians?' asked the boy, in a low voice, as if
fearful of being overheard. 'Dunno; it's too dark to tell.'</p>

<p>'If it's dangerous here, we had better go on.'</p>

<p>'Yer ain't much used to this part the world. You may keep powerful
easy till mornin'.'</p>

<p>As they could not feel certain whether in danger or not, it was
the part of prudence to believe that some peril threatened them.
Accordingly they ate their evening meal in silence, and curled
up in the bottom of their wagon, first taking the precaution to
fill their tank with water, and placing a portion of wood and
kindlings in the bowels of the steam man, so that in case of danger,
they would be able to leave at a short notice.</p>

<p>Johnny Brainerd was soon sound asleep, and the trapper followed,
but it was with that light, restless slumber which is disturbed
by the slightest noise.</p>

<p>So it came about that, but a few hours had passed, when he was
aroused by some slight disturbance in the grove. Raising his head
he endeavored to peer into the darkness, but he could detect nothing.</p>

<p>But he was certain that something was there, and he gently aroused
the boy beside him.</p>

<p>'What is it?' queried the latter in a whisper, but fully wide-awake.</p>

<p>'I think thar ar Ingins among the trees.' 'Good heavens! what
shall we do?'</p>

<p>'Keep still and don't git skeart! sh!' At this juncture he heard
a slight noise, and cautiously raising his head, he caught the
outlines of an Indian, in a crouching position, stealing along
in front of the wagon, as though examining the curious contrivance.
He undoubtedly was greatly puzzled, but he remained only a few
minutes, when he withdrew as silently as he had come.</p>

<p>'Stay yer, while I take a look around!' whispered Baldy, as he
slid softly out the wagon, while the boy did the same, waiting;
until sure that the trapper would not see him.</p>

<p>Baldy spent a half-hour in making his reconnoissance. The result
of it was that he found there were fully twenty Indians, thoroughly
wide-awake, who were moving stealthily through the grove.</p>

<p>When he came back, it was with the conviction that their only
safety lay in getting away without delay.</p>

<p>'We've got to learn,' said he, 'how long it will take yer to
git up steam, youngster?'</p>

<p>'There is a full head on now. I fired up the minute you left
the-wagon.'</p>

<p>'Good!' exclaimed Baldy, who in his excitement did not observe
that the steam man was seething, and apparently ready to explode
with the tremendous power pent up in its vitals. </p>
