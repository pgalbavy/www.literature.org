<P>
HE had followed the trail of his fleeing people for eleven days, 
and his pursuit had been in itself a flight; for behind him he knew 
full well were the dreaded Russians, toiling through the swampy 
lowlands and over the steep divides, bent on no less than the 
extermination of all his people.  He was travelling light.  A 
rabbit-skin sleeping-robe, a muzzle-loading rifle, and a few pounds 
of sun-dried salmon constituted his outfit.  He would have 
marvelled that a whole people - women and children and aged - could 
travel so swiftly, had he not known the terror that drove them on.
<P>
It was in the old days of the Russian occupancy of Alaska, when the 
nineteenth century had run but half its course, that Negore fled 
after his fleeing tribe and came upon it this summer night by the 
head waters of the Pee-lat.  Though near the midnight hour, it was 
bright day as he passed through the weary camp.  Many saw him, all 
knew him, but few and cold were the greetings he received.
<P>
"Negore, the Coward," he heard Illiha, a young woman, laugh, and 
Sun-ne, his sister's daughter, laughed with her.
<P>
Black anger ate at his heart; but he gave no sign, threading his 
way among the camp-fires until he came to one where sat an old man.  
A young woman was kneading with skilful fingers the tired muscles 
of his legs.  He raised a sightless face and listened intently as 
Negore's foot crackled a dead twig.
<P>
"Who comes?" he queried in a thin, tremulous voice.
<P>
"Negore," said the young woman, scarcely looking up from her task.
<P>
Negore's face was expressionless.  For many minutes he stood and 
waited.  The old man's head had sunk back upon his chest.  The 
young woman pressed and prodded the wasted muscles, resting her 
body on her knees, her bowed head hidden as in a cloud by her black 
wealth of hair.  Negore watched the supple body, bending at the 
hips as a lynx's body might bend, pliant as a young willow stalk, 
and, withal, strong as only youth is strong.  He looked, and was 
aware of a great yearning, akin in sensation to physical hunger.  
At last he spoke, saying:
<P>
"Is there no greeting for Negore, who has been long gone and has 
but now come back?"
<P>
She looked up at him with cold eyes.  The old man chuckled to 
himself after the manner of the old.
<P>
"Thou art my woman, Oona," Negore said, his tones dominant and 
conveying a hint of menace.
<P>
She arose with catlike ease and suddenness to her full height, her 
eyes flashing, her nostrils quivering like a deer's.
<P>
"I was thy woman to be, Negore, but thou art a coward; the daughter 
of Old Kinoos mates not with a coward!"
<P>
She silenced him with an imperious gesture as he strove to speak.
<P>
"Old Kinoos and I came among you from a strange land.  Thy people 
took us in by their fires and made us warm, nor asked whence or why 
we wandered.  It was their thought that Old Kinoos had lost the 
sight of his eyes from age; nor did Old Kinoos say otherwise, nor 
did I, his daughter.  Old Kinoos is a brave man, but Old Kinoos was 
never a boaster.  And now, when I tell thee of how his blindness 
came to be, thou wilt know, beyond question, that the daughter of 
Kinoos cannot mother the children of a coward such as thou art, 
Negore."
<P>
Again she silenced the speech that rushed up to his tongue.
<P>
"Know, Negore, if journey be added unto journey of all thy 
journeyings through this land, thou wouldst not come to the unknown 
Sitka on the Great Salt Sea.  In that place there be many Russian 
folk, and their rule is harsh.  And from Sitka, Old Kinoos, who was 
Young Kinoos in those days, fled away with me, a babe in his arms, 
along the islands in the midst of the sea.  My mother dead tells 
the tale of his wrong; a Russian, dead with a spear through breast 
and back, tells the tale of the vengeance of Kinoos.
<P>
"But wherever we fled, and however far we fled, always did we find 
the hated Russian folk.  Kinoos was unafraid, but the sight of them 
was a hurt to his eyes; so we fled on and on, through the seas and 
years, till we came to the Great Fog Sea, Negore, of which thou 
hast heard, but which thou hast never seen.  We lived among many 
peoples, and I grew to be a woman; but Kinoos, growing old, took to 
him no other woman, nor did I take a man.
<P>
"At last we came to Pastolik, which is where the Yukon drowns 
itself in the Great Fog Sea.  Here we lived long, on the rim of the 
sea, among a people by whom the Russians were well hated.  But 
sometimes they came, these Russians, in great ships, and made the 
people of Pastolik show them the way through the islands 
uncountable of the many-mouthed Yukon.  And sometimes the men they 
took to show them the way never came back, till the people became 
angry and planned a great plan.
<P>
"So, when there came a ship, Old Kinoos stepped forward and said he 
would show the way.  He was an old man then, and his hair was 
white; but he was unafraid.  And he was cunning, for he took the 
ship to where the sea sucks in to the land and the waves beat white 
on the mountain called Romanoff.  The sea sucked the ship in to 
where the waves beat white, and it ground upon the rocks and broke 
open its sides.  Then came all the people of Pastolik, (for this 
was the plan), with their war-spears, and arrows, and some few 
guns.  But first the Russians put out the eyes of Old Kinoos that 
he might never show the way again, and then they fought, where the 
waves beat white, with the people of Pastolik.
<P>
"Now the head-man of these Russians was Ivan.  He it was, with his 
two thumbs, who drove out the eyes of Kinoos.  He it was who fought 
his way through the white water, with two men left of all his men, 
and went away along the rim of the Great Fog Sea into the north.  
Kinoos was wise.  He could see no more and was helpless as a child.  
So he fled away from the sea, up the great, strange Yukon, even to 
Nulato, and I fled with him.
<P>
"This was the deed my father did, Kinoos, an old man.  But how did 
the young man, Negore?"
<P>
Once again she silenced him.
<P>
"With my own eyes I saw, at Nulato, before the gates of the great 
fort, and but few days gone.  I saw the Russian, Ivan, who thrust 
out my father's eyes, lay the lash of his dog-whip upon thee and 
beat thee like a dog.  This I saw, and knew thee for a coward.  But 
I saw thee not, that night, when all thy people - yea, even the 
boys not yet hunters - fell upon the Russians and slew them all."
<P>
"Not Ivan," said Negore, quietly.  "Even now is he on our heels, 
and with him many Russians fresh up from the sea."
<P>
Oona made no effort to hide her surprise and chagrin that Ivan was 
not dead, but went on:
<P>
"In the day I saw thee a coward; in the night, when all men fought, 
even the boys not yet hunters, I saw thee not and knew thee doubly 
a coward."
<P>
"Thou art done?  All done?" Negore asked.
<P>
She nodded her head and looked at him askance, as though astonished 
that he should have aught to say.
<P>
"Know then that Negore is no coward," he said; and his speech was 
very low and quiet.  "Know that when I was yet a boy I journeyed 
alone down to the place where the Yukon drowns itself in the Great 
Fog Sea.  Even to Pastolik I journeyed, and even beyond, into the 
north, along the rim of the sea.  This I did when I was a boy, and 
I was no coward.  Nor was I coward when I journeyed, a young man 
and alone, up the Yukon farther than man had ever been, so far that 
I came to another folk, with white faces, who live in a great fort 
and talk speech other than that the Russians talk.  Also have I 
killed the great bear of the Tanana country, where no one of my 
people hath ever been.  And I have fought with the Nuklukyets, and 
the Kaltags, and the Sticks in far regions, even I, and alone.  
These deeds, whereof no man knows, I speak for myself.  Let my 
people speak for me of things I have done which they know.  They 
will not say Negore is a coward."
<P>
He finished proudly, and proudly waited.
<P>
"These be things which happened before I came into the land," she 
said, "and I know not of them.  Only do I know what I know, and I 
know I saw thee lashed like a dog in the day; and in the night, 
when the great fort flamed red and the men killed and were killed, 
I saw thee not.  Also, thy people do call thee Negore, the Coward.  
It is thy name now, Negore, the Coward."
<P>
"It is not a good name," Old Kinoos chuckled.
<P>
"Thou dost not understand, Kinoos," Negore said gently.  "But I 
shall make thee understand.  Know that I was away on the hunt of 
the bear, with Kamo-tah, my mother's son.  And Kamo-tah fought with 
a great bear.  We had no meat for three days, and Kamo-tah was not 
strong of arm nor swift of foot.  And the great bear crushed him, 
so, till his bones cracked like dry sticks.  Thus I found him, very 
sick and groaning upon the ground.  And there was no meat, nor 
could I kill aught that the sick man might eat.
<P>
"So I said, 'I will go to Nulato and bring thee food, also strong 
men to carry thee to camp.'  And Kamo-tah said, 'Go thou to Nulato 
and get food, but say no word of what has befallen me.  And when I 
have eaten, and am grown well and strong, I will kill this bear.  
Then will I return in honor to Nulato, and no man may laugh and say 
Kamo-tah was undone by a bear.'
<P>
"So I gave heed to my brother's words; and when I was come to 
Nulato, and the Russian, Ivan, laid the lash of his dog-whip upon 
me, I knew I must not fight.  For no man knew of Kamo-tah, sick and 
groaning and hungry; and did I fight with Ivan, and die, then would 
my brother die, too.  So it was, Oona, that thou sawest me beaten 
like a dog.
<P>
"Then I heard the talk of the shamans and chiefs that the Russians 
had brought strange sicknesses upon the people, and killed our men, 
and stolen our women, and that the land must be made clean.  As I 
say, I heard the talk, and I knew it for good talk, and I knew that 
in the night the Russians were to be killed.  But there was my 
brother, Kamo-tah, sick and groaning and with no meat; so I could 
not stay and fight with the men and the boys not yet hunters.
<P>
"And I took with me meat and fish, and the lash-marks of Ivan, and 
I found Kamo-tah no longer groaning, but dead.  Then I went back to 
Nulato, and, behold, there was no Nulato - only ashes where the 
great fort had stood, and the bodies of many men.  And I saw the 
Russians come up the Yukon in boats, fresh from the sea, many 
Russians; and I saw Ivan creep forth from where he lay hid and make 
talk with them.  And the next day I saw Ivan lead them upon the 
trail of the tribe.  Even now are they upon the trail, and I am 
here, Negore, but no coward."
<P>
"This is a tale I hear," said Oona, though her voice was gentler 
than before.  "Kamo-tah is dead and cannot speak for thee, and I 
know only what I know, and I must know thee of my own eyes for no 
coward."
<P>
Negore made an impatient gesture.
<P>
"There be ways and ways," she added.  "Art thou willing to do no 
less than what Old Kinoos hath done?"
<P>
He nodded his head, and waited.
<P>
"As thou hast said, they seek for us even now, these Russians.  
Show them the way, Negore, even as Old Kinoos showed them the way, 
so that they come, unprepared, to where we wait for them, in a 
passage up the rocks.  Thou knowest the place, where the wall is 
broken and high.  Then will we destroy them, even Ivan.  When they 
cling like flies to the wall, and top is no less near than bottom, 
our men shall fall upon them from above and either side, with 
spears, and arrows, and guns.  And the women and children, from 
above, shall loosen the great rocks and hurl them down upon them.  
It will be a great day, for the Russians will be killed, the land 
will be made clean, and Ivan, even Ivan who thrust out my father's 
eyes and laid the lash of his dog-whip upon thee, will be killed.  
Like a dog gone mad will he die, his breath crushed out of him 
beneath the rocks.  And when the fighting begins, it is for thee, 
Negore, to crawl secretly away so that thou be not slain."
<P>
"Even so," he answered.  "Negore will show them the way.  And 
then?"
<P>
"And then I shall be thy woman, Negore's woman, the brave man's 
woman.  And thou shalt hunt meat for me and Old Kinoos, and I shall 
cook thy food, and sew thee warm parkas and strong, and make thee 
moccasins after the way of my people, which is a better way than 
thy people's way.  And as I say, I shall be thy woman, Negore, 
always thy woman.  And I shall make thy life glad for thee, so that 
all thy days will be a song and laughter, and thou wilt know the 
woman Oona as unlike all other women, for she has journeyed far, 
and lived in strange places, and is wise in the ways of men and in 
the ways they may be made glad.  And in thine old age will she 
still make thee glad, and thy memory of her in the days of thy 
strength will be sweet, for thou wilt know always that she was ease 
to thee, and peace, and rest, and that beyond all women to other 
men has she been woman to thee."
<P>
"Even so," said Negore, and the hunger for her ate at his heart, 
and his arms went out for her as a hungry man's arms might go out 
for food.
<P>
"When thou hast shown the way, Negore," she chided him; but her 
eyes were soft, and warm, and he knew she looked upon him as woman 
had never looked before.
<P>
"It is well", he said, turning resolutely on his heel.  "I go now 
to make talk with the chiefs, so that they may know I am gone to 
show the Russians the way."
<P>
"Oh, Negore, my man! my man!" she said to herself, as she watched 
him go, but she said it so softly that even Old Kinoos did not 
hear, and his ears were over keen, what of his blindness.
<P>
<P>
Three days later, having with craft ill-concealed his hiding-place, 
Negore was dragged forth like a rat and brought before Ivan - "Ivan 
the Terrible" he was known by the men who marched at his back.  
Negore was armed with a miserable bone-barbed spear, and he kept 
his rabbit-skin robe wrapped closely about him, and though the day 
was warm he shivered as with an ague.  He shook his head that he 
did not understand the speech Ivan put at him, and made that he was 
very weary and sick, and wished only to sit down and rest, pointing 
the while to his stomach in sign of his sickness, and shivering 
fiercely.  But Ivan had with him a man from Pastolik who talked the 
speech of Negore, and many and vain were the questions they asked 
him concerning his tribe, till the man from Pastolik, who was 
called Karduk, said:
<P>
"It is the word of Ivan that thou shalt be lashed till thou diest 
if thou dost not speak.  And know, strange brother, when I tell 
thee the word of Ivan is the law, that I am thy friend and no 
friend of Ivan.  For I come not willingly from my country by the 
sea, and I desire greatly to live; wherefore I obey the will of my 
master - as thou wilt obey, strange brother, if thou art wise, and 
wouldst live."
<P>
"Nay, strange brother," Negore answered, "I know not the way my 
people are gone, for I was sick, and they fled so fast my legs gave 
out from under me, and I fell behind."
<P>
Negore waited while Karduk talked with Ivan.  Then Negore saw the 
Russian's face go dark, and he saw the men step to either side of 
him, snapping the lashes of their whips.  Whereupon he betrayed a 
great fright, and cried aloud that he was a sick man and knew 
nothing, but would tell what he knew.  And to such purpose did he 
tell, that Ivan gave the word to his men to march, and on either 
side of Negore marched the men with the whips, that he might not 
run away.  And when he made that he was weak of his sickness, and 
stumbled and walked not so fast as they walked, they laid their 
lashes upon him till he screamed with pain and discovered new 
strength.  And when Karduk told him all would he well with him when 
they had overtaken his tribe, he asked, "And then may I rest and 
move not?"
<P>
Continually he asked, "And then may I rest and move not?"
<P>
And while he appeared very sick and looked about him with dull 
eyes, he noted the fighting strength of Ivan's men, and noted with 
satisfaction that Ivan did not recognize him as the man he had 
beaten before the gates of the fort.  It was a strange following 
his dull eyes saw.  There were Slavonian hunters, fair-skinned and 
mighty-muscled; short, squat Finns, with flat noses and round 
faces; Siberian half-breeds, whose noses were more like eagle-
beaks; and lean, slant-eyed men, who bore in their veins the Mongol 
and Tartar blood as well as the blood of the Slav.  Wild 
adventurers they were, forayers and destroyers from the far lands 
beyond the Sea of Bering, who blasted the new and unknown world 
with fire and sword and clutched greedily for its wealth of fur and 
hide.  Negore looked upon them with satisfaction, and in his mind's 
eye he saw them crushed and lifeless at the passage up the rocks.  
And ever he saw, waiting for him at the passage up the rocks, the 
face and the form of Oona, and ever he heard her voice in his ears 
and felt the soft, warm glow of her eyes.  But never did he forget 
to shiver, nor to stumble where the footing was rough, nor to cry 
aloud at the bite of the lash.  Also, he was afraid of Karduk, for 
he knew him for no true man.  His was a false eye, and an easy 
tongue - a tongue too easy, he judged, for the awkwardness of 
honest speech.
<P>
All that day they marched.  And on the next, when Karduk asked him 
at command of Ivan, he said he doubted they would meet with his 
tribe till the morrow.  But Ivan, who had once been shown the way 
by Old Kinoos, and had found that way to lead through the white 
water and a deadly fight, believed no more in anything.  So when 
they came to a passage up the rocks, he halted his forty men, and 
through Karduk demanded if the way were clear.
<P>
Negore looked at it shortly and carelessly.  It was a vast slide 
that broke the straight wall of a cliff, and was overrun with brush 
and creeping plants, where a score of tribes could have lain well 
hidden.
<P>
He shook his head.  "Nay, there be nothing there," he said.  "The 
way is clear."
<P>
Again Ivan spoke to Karduk, and Karduk said:
<P>
"Know, strange brother, if thy talk be not straight, and if thy 
people block the way and fall upon Ivan and his men, that thou 
shalt die, and at once."
<P>
"My talk is straight," Negore said.  "The way is clear."
<P>
Still Ivan doubted, and ordered two of his Slavonian hunters to go 
up alone.  Two other men he ordered to the side of Negore.  They 
placed their guns against his breast and waited.  All waited.  And 
Negore knew, should one arrow fly, or one spear be flung, that his 
death would come upon him.  The two Slavonian hunters toiled upward 
till they grew small and smaller, and when they reached the top and 
waved their hats that all was well, they were like black specks 
against the sky.
<P>
The guns were lowered from Negore's breast and Ivan gave the order 
for his men to go forward.  Ivan was silent, lost in thought.  For 
an hour he marched, as though puzzled, and then, through Karduk's 
mouth, he said to Negore:
<P>
"How didst thou know the way was clear when thou didst look so 
briefly upon it?"
<P>
Negore thought of the little birds he had seen perched among the 
rocks and upon the bushes, and smiled, it was so simple; but he 
shrugged his shoulders and made no answer.  For he was thinking, 
likewise, of another passage up the rocks, to which they would soon 
come, and where the little birds would all be gone.  And he was 
glad that Karduk came from the Great Fog Sea, where there were no 
trees or bushes, and where men learned water-craft instead of land-
craft and wood-craft.
<P>
Three hours later, when the sun rode overhead, they came to another 
passage up the rocks, and Karduk said:
<P>
"Look with all thine eyes, strange brother, and see if the way be 
clear, for Ivan is not minded this time to wait while men go up 
before."
<P>
Negore looked, and he looked with two men by his side, their guns 
resting against his breast.  He saw that the little birds were all 
gone, and once he saw the glint of sunlight on a rifle-barrel.  And 
he thought of Oona, and of her words:  "And when the fighting 
begins, it is for thee, Negore, to crawl secretly away so that thou 
be not slain."
<P>
He felt the two guns pressing on his breast.  This was not the way 
she had planned.  There would be no crawling secretly away.  He 
would be the first to die when the fighting began.  But he said, 
and his voice was steady, and he still feigned to see with dull 
eyes and to shiver from his sickness:
<P>
"The way is clear."
<P>
And they started up, Ivan and his forty men from the far lands 
beyond the Sea of Bering.  And there was Karduk, the man from 
Pastolik, and Negore, with the two guns always upon him.  It was a 
long climb, and they could not go fast; but very fast to Negore 
they seemed to approach the midway point where top was no less near 
than bottom.
<P>
A gun cracked among the rocks to the right, and Negore heard the 
war-yell of all his tribe, and for an instant saw the rocks and 
bushes bristle alive with his kinfolk.  Then he felt torn asunder 
by a burst of flame hot through his being, and as he fell he knew 
the sharp pangs of life as it wrenches at the flesh to be free.
<P>
But he gripped his life with a miser's clutch and would not let it 
go.  He still breathed the air, which bit his lungs with a painful 
sweetness; and dimly he saw and heard, with passing spells of 
blindness and deafness, the flashes of sight and sound again 
wherein he saw the hunters of Ivan falling to their deaths, and his 
own brothers fringing the carnage and filling the air with the 
tumult of their cries and weapons, and, far above, the women and 
children loosing the great rocks that leaped like things alive and 
thundered down.
<P>
The sun danced above him in the sky, the huge walls reeled and 
swung, and still he heard and saw dimly.  And when the great Ivan 
fell across his legs, hurled there lifeless and crushed by a down-
rushing rock, he remembered the blind eyes of Old Kinoos and was 
glad.
<P>
Then the sounds died down, and the rocks no longer thundered past, 
and he saw his tribespeople creeping close and closer, spearing the 
wounded as they came.  And near to him he heard the scuffle of a 
mighty Slavonian hunter, loath to die, and, half uprisen, borne 
back and down by the thirsty spears.
<P>
Then he saw above him the face of Oona, and felt about him the arms 
of Oona; and for a moment the sun steadied and stood still, and the 
great walls were upright and moved not.
<P>
"Thou art a brave man, Negore," he heard her say in his ear; "thou 
art my man, Negore."
<P>
And in that moment he lived all the life of gladness of which she 
had told him, and the laughter and the song, and as the sun went 
out of the sky above him, as in his old age, he knew the memory of 
her was sweet.  And as even the memories dimmed and died in the 
darkness that fell upon him, he knew in her arms the fulfilment of 
all the ease and rest she had promised him.  And as black night 
wrapped around him, his head upon her breast, he felt a great peace 
steal about him, and he was aware of the hush of many twilights and 
the mystery of silence.
