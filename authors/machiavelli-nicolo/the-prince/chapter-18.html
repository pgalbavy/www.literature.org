<p> [1] "The present chapter has given greater offence than any
other  portion of Machiavelli’s writings." Burd, "Il Principe,"
p. 297.</p>

<p>Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith,
and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our
experience has been that those princes who have done great things
have held good faith of little account, and have known how to
circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have
overcome those who have relied on their word. You must know there
are two ways of contesting,[2] the one by the law, the other by
force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts;
but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary
to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for
a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the
man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers,
who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given
to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;
which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was
half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know
how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other
is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly
to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because
the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot
defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be
a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.
Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they
are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep
faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when
the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men
were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they
are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound
to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince
legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless
modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and
engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness
of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has
succeeded best.</p>

<p> [2] "Contesting," <em>i.e</em>. "striving for mastery." Mr Burd
points out  that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero’s
"De Officiis":  "Nam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per
disceptationem, alterum  per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis,
hoc beluarum; confugiendum  est ad posterius, si uti non licet
superiore."</p>

<p>But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,
and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple,
and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive
will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived.
One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the
Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing
otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a
man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths
would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless
his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,[3] because
he well understood this side of mankind.</p>

<p> [3] "Nondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum)."
The  words "ad votum" are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.</p>

<p>Alexander never did what he said, Cesare never said what he did.</p>

<p>Italian Proverb.</p>

<p>Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good
qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear
to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have
them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear
to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane,
religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that
should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how
to change to the opposite.</p>

<p>And you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a
new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed,
being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary
to fidelity,[4] friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore
it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly
as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have
said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing
so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.</p>

<p> [4] "Contrary to fidelity" or "faith," "contro alla fede," and
"tutto  fede," "altogether faithful," in the next paragraph. It
is noteworthy  that these two phrases, "contro alla fede" and
"tutto fede," were  omitted in the Testina edition, which was
published with the sanction  of the papal authorities. It may
be that the meaning attached to the  word "fede" was "the faith,"
<em>i.e</em>. the Catholic creed, and not as  rendered here "fidelity"
and "faithful." Observe that the word  "religione" was suffered
to stand in the text of the Testina, being  used to signify indifferently
every shade of belief, as witness "the  religion," a phrase inevitably
employed to designate the Huguenot  heresy. South in his Sermon
IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this  passage as follows: "That
great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,  Nicolo Machiavel,
laid down this for a master rule in his political  scheme: ‘That
the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but  the reality
of it hurtful and pernicious.’"</p>

<p>For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets
anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named
five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him
altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious.
There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last
quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than
by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few
to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be,
few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves
to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state
to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially
of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by
the result.</p>

<p>For that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and
holding his state, the means will always be considered honest,
and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always
taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and
in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place
there only when the many have no ground to rest on.</p>

<p>One prince[5] of the present time, whom it is not well to name,
never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to
both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would
have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.</p>

<p> [5] Ferdinand of Aragon. "When Machiavelli was writing <em>The
Prince</em> it  would have been clearly impossible to mention
Ferdinand’s name here  without giving offence." Burd’s "Il Principe,"
p. 308.</p>
