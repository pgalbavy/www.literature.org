<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The hot summer was drawing to a close. Two weeks more and September
would be ushered in, bringing with it the State Fair, always an
event in the lives of the busy farmers of the State, and particularly
of those around Martindale and Pendennis, as the fairgrounds were
located midway between the two big cities.</p>

<p>Peace had never attended a State Fair in all her short life,
but she had heard it talked about so much by the residents of
Parker that she was wildly excited when Faith decided to enter
a cake in the cooking exhibit, and immediately she determined
to visit the Fair in person and see her sister's handiwork fitly
rewarded. However, when she made known this decision to the rest
of the family Gail said quietly, "I am afraid you can't, dear.
It costs fifty cents to enter the grounds, and even if they admit
children at half price, that would mean twenty-five cents for
each of you three youngest, and Hope would have to pay the full
amount, as she is now in her 'teens. We can't afford to go this
year."</p>

<p>This was an item that Peace had not considered. Of course, if
she went, the rest of the family were entitled to the same pleasure,
and that would mean three half dollars and three quarters. She
found her slate and laboriously added up the column of figures.
"Two dollars and twenty-five cents! Mercy, that is a lot to spend
just to go to the Fair for one day, isn't it? Oh, dear, why is
it we always have to stop and think about the money? I wish dollars
grew on trees, and all we had to do when we wanted any would be
to go out and pick them. What fun we'd have! I do want to go to
the Fair so much, though. If only there was some way to earn the
money!"</p>

<p>She wandered down to the melon patch, the pride of her childish
heart, and sat down on one of the green balls to meditate on the
subject.</p>

<p>"I never saw the beat how your melons do grow," exclaimed a voice
behind her, as Mrs. Grinnell, on her way to the brown house, paused
to admire the tempting fruit. "If there was just some way of getting
them into the city, you might make a pretty penny off them. Now,
mine don't begin to be as big as yours, and there aren't half
so many on the vines. That's a whopper you are sitting on. You
ought to take it to the Fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Grinnell, do folks take <em>melons</em> to the Fair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, every year. Why, I've seen lots there that weren't
as big as yours. Of course it's the biggest that win the ribbons,
and you might not stand a show, but there would be no harm trying.
I am intending to enter my two mammoth pumpkins and that Hubbard
squash, along with my corn."</p>

<p>"Do you s'pose Gail would let me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I'll take it in with mine if you like. I am
to lug Faith's cake."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I'll do it! These two whollipers. That one is almost
as big as the one I play is my armchair. The rest are too little
to have a chance, aren't they? Maybe they will be big enough by
Fair time, though. They have two weeks more to grow in."</p>

<p>"No telling what they will do in that time," laughed Mrs. Grinnell,
moving briskly away up the path, leaving Peace still perched on
top of the largest melon busily making her fortune from her small
garden patch.</p>

<p>"If only we hadn't sold Black Prince," she mourned, "we could
just cart these melons into Martindale and make a whole lot on
them. There, why didn't I think of that before? Mike peddles garden
truck in the city, 'most every day. I'll just have him tote these
along. I've got&mdash;let me see&mdash;twelve, sixteen, seventeen, twenty-one
good ones, besides my big fellows. I wonder if that will be enough.
I'm going right over and see Mike now. He is at home today; I
saw him."</p>

<p>She skipped away through the garden to the O'Hara place, some
distance below them, and finding the red-haired boy grinding an
ax in the dooryard, she startled him by her breathless demand,
"How much do watermelons sell for in the city?"</p>

<p>"Shure an' it depinds on the size."</p>

<p>"Mine are great big ones. Mrs. Grinnell says they ought to bring
a pretty penny in Martindale."</p>

<p>"Well, thin, I think maybe they'd be bringing a quarter."</p>

<p>"Each one?"</p>

<p>"Shure!"</p>

<p>"And how much would that make if twenty-one were sold?"</p>

<p>"Five dollars and a quarter," promptly answered Mike, who was
quick at figures and proud of the accomplishment.</p>

<p>"That would be enough," cried Peace in great glee. "All I need
is two dollars and a quarter. Come on over to my house and pick
them right away."</p>

<p>"What?" yelled Mike, wondering if the child had gone crazy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot! I haven't told you yet, have I? You can sell my
melons in the city for me if you like and save me the trouble."</p>

<p>The boy stared at her, transfixed by her complacent self-assurance.</p>

<p>"Has the cat got your tongue?" Peace asked, when he did not speak.</p>

<p>"No, but you have your nerve," he stuttered. "What d'ye take
me for,&mdash;a dray horse?"</p>

<p>"You've got a mule team, haven't you?" flared Peace, seeing no
occasion for his anger. "And you peddle truck nearly every day.
Then I don't see why you can't take my melons and sell them. Black
Prince is gone, and we can't drive about any more ourselves."</p>

<p>"Well, where do I come in? Melons take up a sight of wagon room,
nothing said of the time it will take to sell them. And then you
expict me to do it all for nothing!"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I hadn't thought about that," faltered Peace; and,
sitting down on the windmill platform, she pulled a pencil stub
from her pocket and began to do some figuring on the sole of her
shoe.</p>

<p>Mike watched her serious face in amusement, and grinned broadly
when, after five minutes of vigorous scratching and hard thinking,
she released her foot and said in her most business-like tones,
"I'll tell you what I will do. If you can sell all those twenty-one
melons at twenty-five cents each, you can have half the money
for your trouble. That will still leave me enough to get our family
inside the Fair. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>Mike scratched his head thoughtfully and then replied, "I'll
take a look at thim melons first."</p>

<p>So she led him to the small patch and proudly displayed her treasures.
"You see there are more than twenty-one melons on the vines. Those
two big ones Mrs. Grinnell is going to tote along with her pumpkins
to the Fair, and the little ones and the crooked fellers we'll
eat at home; but there are twenty-one nice ones to sell."</p>

<p>Mike expressed his admiration by the boyish exclamation, "Gee,
ain't them bouncers? How 'd ye do it? Our'n don't amount to shucks
this year."</p>

<p>"That's what Mrs. Grinnell said about hers. I guess it's 'cause
I know how to grow watermelons," answered Peace, with charming
frankness. "Mr. Strong says that must be the reason. You see,
I planted sweet-peas and these came up. Maybe it's a sweet-pea
melon. Do you s'pose it is?"</p>

<p>"I niver heard tell of such a thing," Mike soberly replied, "but
maybe that's what's the matter."</p>

<p>"Will you sell them for me?"</p>

<p>Mike was busy thumping the green balls with his knuckles, and
feeling of the stems, and when he had tested each in turn, he
answered, "Yis, I'll sell thim for you, but ye'd better wait a
week or two. They aren't ripe enough yit."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," mourned the child, plainly disappointed. "The Fair
begins in two weeks, and that is what I wanted the money for.
Don't you think they will be ripe enough before that?"</p>

<p>"Don't look as if they would," Mike replied firmly. "And green
melons won't sell well. Besides, the longer they grow, the bigger
they will be."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I must wait; but don't you tell the girls. I
want to s'prise them if we can go, for they don't think we can."</p>

<p>So, with many promises of secrecy, Mike departed, and Peace from
that moment became a devoted slave of the melon patch.</p>

<p>As soon as she was out of bed in the morning she flew down to
the garden to exult over her treasures, and with the last gleam
of the dying day she might be seen bending over the mottled fruit
whispering encouraging messages to them, coaxing them to grow.
Bucket after bucket of water she tugged from the well to pour
on their thirsty roots, and load after load of fertilizer she
dragged in Allee's little cart to spread over the ground in her
eager desire to increase their size. But when Gail found her with
soap and scrub-brush polishing off each precious ball, she was
forced to curb her zealous gardening. However, the vines throve
through all this heroic treatment, and it seemed to Peace that
she could almost see the fruit grow in circumference. Each night
she consulted Mike, convinced that they had ripened sufficiently
during the day to be picked, but the boy steadfastly shook his
head.</p>

<p>At length, as the second week of anxious waiting was drawing
to a close, Peace could endure the suspense no longer, and one
warm afternoon, while her sisters were occupied with their various
duties, she snatched the sharp bread-knife from the pantry shelf,
and with Allee in tow, stole down to her garden plot.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" whispered the blue-eyed tot, as if
still fearful that she might be overheard at the house.</p>

<p>"Try one of my melons and see if it isn't ripe. This feller will
do, I guess. It is big, but not too big." She plunged the shining
blade deep into the green rind, and as the two halves fell apart,
disclosing the bright red heart thickly dotted with black and
white seeds, she cried triumphantly, "There, I knew I was right!
Just taste it, Allee. Ain't it sweet and nice? Let's lug it down
to the hedge and eat it up."</p>

<p>"That's a piggy," answered the smaller girl, smacking her lips
over the delicious morsel.</p>

<p>"We can 'ford to be pigs this once, I guess," Peace retorted.
"If we take it up to the house they will want to know why we cut
it, and we'll have to tell them about Mike and the Fair. You don't
want them to know that, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, but we are too little to eat it all ourselves."</p>

<p>"Half a melon each ain't much. Why, Len Abbott must have eaten
two whole ones at the church sociable the other night. Can you
carry your half?"</p>

<p>"Yes," panted the younger lass, bravely tugging at her heavy
load.</p>

<p>So, with much puffing, and many stops for breath, they dragged
the fruit through the cornfield to the creek road, scrambled in
behind the dense brush and blackberry vines, and began to dispose
of the sweet, juicy center.</p>

<p>"Let's eat one-half all up 'fore we begin the other," proposed
Allee, who seemed to have some doubts as to the capacity of her
stomach.</p>

<p>"All right," Peace agreed. "The melon <em>does</em> look pretty
big, and maybe we can't hold it all at one sitting. I'll push
the other half under the bushes and cover my handkerchief over
it to keep off the flies. What a lot of seed this one has! Let's
save some for planting next year. S'posing each of these seeds
was a ticket to the State Fairgrounds, we could all of us go every
day and invite everyone else in town, pretty near. Hush! There's
a team coming up the road. Let's peek and see if it's anyone we
know."</p>

<p>She drew aside the branches as she spoke, and two inquisitive,
fruit-stained faces peered out of the opening just as a two-seated
carryall drew up by the roadside, and a woman's voice said imperatively,
"There is a cluster, Henry,&mdash;lovely berries. I thought they were
all gone by this time."</p>

<p>Henry leaped over the wheel to the ground, gathered a handful
of dust-covered blackberries, and passed them up to the other
three occupants of the rig, remarking, "It's a shame we can't
find watermelons growing wild along the roadside. I am afraid
if we have a melon social at the church tomorrow night we must
patronize the groceryman for the fruit."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have caused you this wild-goose chase," said a
meek voice from the back seat. "But last year we drove through
this town when watermelon vines were the only things in sight."</p>

<p>"That is everything in sight today," laughed Henry teasingly.
"The trouble is, they don't bear any decent fruit. I'd give five
dollars if anyone would show me twenty good, fair-sized watermelons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, sir!" exclaimed an eager voice at his feet. "Give
me the five dollars, and I'll show you twenty-two!"</p>

<p>The man jumped as if shot, the three ladies screamed, and even
the horses started at the unexpected sound, or perhaps it was
at sight of a tousled brown head wriggling excitedly through the
thicket, followed by an equally tousled golden head.</p>

<p>"Well, who are you?" stammered the startled young man, as the
children gained their feet and stood shyly eyeing the city folks.</p>

<p>"Two of the Greenfield kids," answered Peace. "We were just trying
one of my melons when we heard what you said. We've got some fine
ones in our garden, and I'll sell them cheap. They b'long to me.
I planted sweet-pea seeds and they came up."</p>

<p>The man roared, the young ladies giggled, and then one of them
said sweetly, "Have you some of your melon left so we can see
what it is like?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Peace, diving into the brush and dragging forth
the untouched half, covered with her dirty handkerchief. "Here
it is. You can eat it. Allee and me are 'most full now. Oh, it's
black with ants! Never mind, just brush them off; they won't change
the taste any."</p>

<p>But though the ladies admired the ripe red fruit, they seemed
to have no appetite for it, and Henry was the only one of the
party who sampled it.</p>

<p>"It's lickum good," he announced, after the first mouthful. "Better
have some, girls. No? Well, I shall lug this piece back with us
for refreshments. Say, Curly-locks, are all your melons as big
as that?"</p>

<p>"Bigger&mdash;that is, most of them are. Mrs. Grinnell is going to
take two in to the Fair, but there are twenty-one big ones besides.
I mean twenty. This is the twenty-oneth."</p>

<p>They laughed again, and Henry proposed, "Let's go over and see
them anyway. If we can't find the melons, we can have a good time
today at least."</p>

<p>"Just as you say," chorused the girls; and bundling the soiled,
sticky children into the carriage with them, they drove on to
the little brown house.</p>

<p>As the team drew up in front of the gate the group of workers
on the porch started to their feet in surprise, but Peace called,
"Go on with your sewing! This is my company! They are going to
look at my twenty watermelons to see if they are any good; and
then I am going to charge them five dollars for them."</p>

<p>The laughing young people came up the walk to meet the embarrassed
mistress of the house, and the situation was briefly explained.
"Our League is planning for a lawn social tomorrow night," said
one young lady.</p>

<p>"Ice-cream and cake," added the second.</p>

<p>"With watermelons for a side-dish," the young man put in.</p>

<p>"And we thought we could get better melons if we came out here
in the country to buy them," said the fourth member of the party.</p>

<p>"The melon patch belongs to Peace," Gail told them. "We think
she has some pretty good fruit. Come this way and see for yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, what big ones!" cried the visiting quartette. "Surely you
won't sell all these for five dollars?"</p>

<p>"No, only twenty," answered Peace gravely. "You can't have the
two biggest ones, and of course you don't want the crooked fellers.
Mike says they will sell for twenty-five cents each in Martindale."</p>

<p>So the twenty splendid melons were cut and loaded into the wagon,
Peace was paid a spandy new five-dollar bill, and the visitors
departed merrily. The child watched them out of sight, still holding
fast to her money, and then turned to Gail, sighing contentedly,
"Now we can go to the Fair! I've had an awful job getting rid
of those things, but they are gone at last, and here is the money.
I 'xpect Mike will be mad as hops, but he didn't know beans when
he said they weren't ripe. I've raised melons enough so I know."</p>

<p>"But, dearie," interrupted the oldest sister, "you mustn't spend
your money so recklessly for our pleasure. It will take almost
half of that five dollars just to pay our way into the grounds,
and another dollar for carfare."</p>

<p>"Then it's lucky Mike didn't sell the melons for me," said Peace,
"or I 'xpect we'd have had to walk. I sold those watermelons just
so's we all could go to the Fair, Gail, and now you mustn't say
no."</p>

<p>"Then I won't," suddenly whispered the tired mother-sister, seeing
the longing in the somber brown eyes, and realizing the child's
unselfish love. "When is Mrs. Grinnell to take your big melons
away?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," she said. "The Fair begins Monday, you know."</p>

<p>"Then you better go say good-bye to them now," teased Faith.
"It is nearly supper time, and you will hardly have a chance in
the morning."</p>

<p>But Peace shook her head, declaring seriously, "There will be
time enough. And if the melons don't win a prize, we'll bring
them back home, Mrs. Grinnell says."</p>

<p>When the morning dawned, however, and Peace ran eagerly down
to visit her garden, she stopped in dismay at the sight which
greeted her eyes. On the ground, strewn all over the patch, were
broken, battered melon-rinds; and the two mammoth balls were gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darlings! my precious melons!" she cried in grief. "Someone
has eaten them all up!" Throwing herself flat amid the wreck,
she sobbed as if her heart would break, so overwhelmed by her
loss that it never occurred to her to report the disaster to the
rest of the family. It was too cruel!</p>

<p>When the hot tears had relieved the little heart somewhat, she
sat up and looked about her once more, saying, with quivering
lips, "I don't s'pose they would have won a prize anyway, but
it was hatefully mean of whoever took them. I'll bet Mike O'Hara
did it to get even with me for selling the others to the city
folks and keeping all the money myself! I'm going straight over
and tell him what a nice kind of a gentleman he is."</p>

<p>She bounced to her feet, started swiftly across the patch, caught
her toe in a tough vine and fell sprawling on the ground again,
rapping her head smartly on a small, unripe melon at the edge
of the field. "Mercy! you're a hard-shelled old sinner!" she exclaimed,
rubbing her bruised forehead and glaring at the offending fruit.
"Well, no wonder! I hit a knife, as sure as you're alive! It ain't
Mike's either. It's &mdash;Hector Abbott's! Why didn't I think
of him before? Of course he is the <em>culvert</em>; but I'll
bet he will wish he hadn't seen those melons when I get through
with him."</p>

<p>Burning with indignation, she sped away to the village, never
pausing until the Judge's house was reached. As she approached
the place she could see the family gathered around the breakfast
table, set on the wide, screened porch; and forgetting to knock,
she threw open the door and rushed in as if on the wings of the
wind. Straight to Hector's chair she stalked, and before the surprised
family could recover their breath, she clutched the unhappy youth
by the hair and jerked him out of his seat, crying accusingly,
"Hec Abbott, you disgraceful son of a judge! You stole my melons,
my State Fair melons! You can't say you didn't, 'cause I've found
your knife in the garden! I s'pose it walked there, didn't it?
Well, maybe it did, but <em>you</em> walked it! You can just settle
for damages this very minute!"</p>

<p>By this time the Judge had found his tongue, and loosening the
angry fingers from his youngest son's luxuriant topknot, he demanded
of Peace, "What do you mean by such actions? Where are your manners?
Why didn't you knock? Who brought you up?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't <em>Hec</em> knock when he came for my melons last
night? Where are <em>his</em> manners? What did <em>he</em> mean
by such actions? <em>You brung him up!</em>"</p>

<p>Len Abbott choked over his coffee, Cecile hid her face in her
napkin, and even the anxious mother smiled, but the Judge looked
more ruffled than abashed, and he fairly thundered, "How do you
know the knife is Hector's?"</p>

<p>"Don't you s'pose I have seen it enough to know whose it is?
Didn't I grab it from him the day he pretended to cut off Lola
Hunt's ears? I cut his hand, too, but he deserved it! He's the
meanest boy at school next to Jimmy Jones. Teacher took the knife
away one time when he was skinning a frog, and I saw it then.
Anyway, it's got his name on it,&mdash;not just his 'nitials, but his
whole name. And there it is!"</p>

<p>She held out the article for the Judge's inspection, and that
worthy gentleman, seeing the look of guilt in his small son's
face, pocketed it, saying whimsically to the wrathful accuser,
"That is merely circumstantial evidence. He might yet be innocent
of the charge."</p>

<p>"He might," Peace retorted grimly; "but he ain't! Ask him!"</p>

<p>The Judge turned gravely to the crimson-cheeked lad and asked
severely, "Son, are you guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Guilty," muttered the miserable culprit.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you?" triumphed the girl.</p>

<p>"What would you recommend as his sentence?" asked the Judge.</p>

<p>"Sentence?" repeated Peace, with the uncomfortable feeling that
she was being laughed at.</p>

<p>"Punishment, I mean."</p>

<p>"A good, sound thrashing that ain't all show and no hurt," was
the harsh verdict.</p>

<p>"Very well! I will administer it now. Len, hand me that strap.
Hector, come here!"</p>

<p>Leonard passed the strap to his father, the younger son shuffled
across the porch to receive his sentence, and Peace stood breathlessly
by, watching with frightened eyes. The Judge raised the strip
of leather and brought it down with a resounding thwack across
the boy's legs. He squirmed, let out a wild yell, and began to
blubber. The strap rose and fell the second time, there was a
second yell, and Peace, with blazing eyes and blanched face, flew
in between man and boy, snatched the upraised strap and flung
it clear across the room, screaming in fierce indignation, "Don't
you touch him again! You're a pretty kind of a judge! Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?"</p>

<p>"You sentenced him yourself," stammered the surprised man.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll let him off this time," she replied slowly, "but
he will have to pay for those melons."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"A dollar each."</p>

<p>"Whew! They are pretty expensive fruit, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"I've put more'n a dollar's worth of trouble into getting them
ready for the Fair, and now he's et up my blue ribbon."</p>

<p>"Your blue ribbon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe those melons would have won a blue ribbon. Now I'll
never know."</p>

<p>"Well, well, that's too bad," sympathized the amused Judge. "Hector
will have to pay for them, surely. Son, go get the money out of
your bank."</p>

<p>"I didn't eat all of them. Jimmy Jones and Ted Fenton and the
Beldon boys helped," said Hector, wiping his eyes sullenly.</p>

<p>"You can c'lect from them later," retorted Peace. "You were at
the head of it, I know."</p>

<p>"Get the money, son," repeated the father sternly, and the unhappy
boy thought it wise to obey without further demur.</p>

<p>When the two silver dollars were laid in her hand Peace smiled
her relief, and with a curt "Thank you," turned to go, when to
the utter amazement of the whole family, she whirled suddenly
about and confronted Hector again, saying calmly, "While I am
here, I might as well c'lect for that cake you stole more'n a
year ago."</p>

<p>"Cake?" echoed the group, while the boy's face grew scarlet with
guilt once more.</p>

<p>"Yes, cake! We thought my tramp took it at first. Faith made
it for the minister's reception and put it on the wash-bench under
a dishpan to cool. 'Twas gone when she went to get it again. Hec
stole it."</p>

<p>"Hector, did you?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded, too miserable to speak.</p>

<p>"How much was that worth, Peace?"</p>

<p>"It was bigger'n a fifty-cent one. I guess it will be seventy-five
cents."</p>

<p>"Get your bank and settle your account, Hector."</p>

<p>And once more the boy was forced to obey.</p>

<p>"There!" breathed Peace, closing her fingers over the added coins.
"I guess we are square now. I just happened to think of the cake.
Isn't it lucky I did? I wasn't quite sure he took it, but seeing
that my tramp didn't do it, I knew it must be someone in town,
and I couldn't think of anyone else mean enough. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She ran lightly down the steps and away toward home, chanting
to herself, "He had to pay up, he had to pay up!" Suddenly she
halted by the roadside and listened. "Yes, sir! That's Hec a-howling!
I guess the Judge got hold of that strap again. Well, he deserves
a good licking, but I'm glad I'm not there to see him dance."</p>
