<p>At this point I let Theophrastus once more take up the narrative.</p>

<p>"I had the strongest desire," he writes, "to see and touch that
wax which had been moulded on my own skin; and this desire grew,
if possible, stronger when Adolphe told me that the Château of
Saint-Germain-en-Laye had contained the wax portrait of the famous
Cartouche since the 25th of April, 1849. It had been presented
to it by an Abbé Niallier, who had inherited it under the will
of a Monsieur Richot, an Officer of the Household of Louis <em>XVI,
</em>who had had it for many years. It was all the more valuable
for having belonged to the Royal Family.</p>

<p>"This bust was moulded by a Florentine artist a few days before
my execution. On it is a cap of wool or rough leather; and it
is dressed in a coarse linen shirt covered with soot, and a waistcoat
and a jacket of black camlet. But the most extraordinary thing
about it is, that my hair and moustache were cut off after I was
executed, and glued on to my mask! The portrait is enclosed in
a large, deep, gilded frame, a very pretty piece of work. A sheet
of Venetian glass protects the portrait; and one can still see
on the frame faint traces of the arms of France.</p>

<p>"I asked Adolphe how he had obtained these exact details. He
answered that they were the result of two days' work in the National
Library.</p>

<p>"My hair! my moustache! my clothes! All as they were two hundred
years ago! In spite of the horror with which the relics of a man
who had committed so many crimes should have inspired me, I could
hardly contain myself in my impatience to see and touch them.
O mystery of Nature! Profound abyss of the soul! Giddy precipice
of the heart! I, Theophrastus Longuet, whose name is the synonym
of honour, I who was always afraid of bloodshed, I already <em>cherished</em>
in my heart the relics of the greatest brigand in the world!</p>

<p>"When I recovered my senses after the sight of the portrait in
Guénégaud Street, I was at first amazed not to find myself in
a state of despair bitter enough to disgust me with life, and
plunge me once more into the tomb. No: I did not dream of suppressing
this envelope, with the face of an honest man, which in the twentieth
century was labelled 'Theophrastus Longuet,' which enclosed and
bore about the world the soul of Cartouche. Undoubtedly at the
first moment of such a revelation the least I could do was to
faint; and I did so. But instead of finding despair in my heart
I found a great compassion, which not only drew tears from me
for the misfortune of myself, Theophrastus, but also for Cartouche.
I asked myself in fact which was having the best time of it, the
honest Theophrastus dragging the brigand Cartouche about inside
him or the brigand Cartouche shut up in the honest Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"'We must try and understand one another,' I said out loud.</p>

<p>"The words had scarcely passed my lips when a dazzling light
broke on me, as I recalled the theory of Reincarnation which M.
Lecamus had revealed to me.</p>

<p>"The whole object of evolution is the evolution of the reincarnate
soul towards the Better. It is the Progressive Ascent of Being
of which Commissary Mifroid had spoken to us with such delightful
earnestness. It was quite plain that the powers who regulate the
process of reincarnation had found nothing more honest on earth
than the body of Theophrastus Longuet to enable the criminal soul
of Cartouche to evolve towards the Better.</p>

<p>"I must admit that when this idea took hold of me, instead of
the childish despair which had caused me to faint, I felt myself
filled with a sentiment more akin to pride. I was charged by the
Planetary Logos, I, the humble, honest Theophrastus, to regenerate
in ideal splendour that soul of darkness and of blood, the soul
of Louis-Dominique Cartouche, known as the <em>Child</em>. I accepted
willingly, since I could not do otherwise, this unexpected mission
and at once I was on my guard. I did not repeat the phrase, 'We
must understand one another'; but I at once commanded Cartouche
to obey Theophrastus; and I promised myself that I would give
him such a time of it that I could not prevent myself from saying
with a smile: 'Poor old Cartouche!'</p>

<p>"I confided these reflections to Adolphe, who received them with
approval, but at the same time warned me against my tendency to
separate Theophrastus from Cartouche.</p>

<p>"'You must not forget,' he said, 'that they are one. You have
the instincts of Theophrastus, that is to say, of the cabbage-planters
(gardeners, market-gardeners) of Ferté-sous-Jouarre. These instincts
are good. But you have also the soul of Cartouche, which is detestable.
Take care: war is declared. The question is, which will conquer,
the soul of long ago or the instincts of to-day.'</p>

<p>"I asked him if the soul of Cartouche was truly altogether detestable,
which would have grieved me. I was pleased to learn that it had
its good points.</p>

<p>"'Cartouche,' said he, 'expressly forbade his men to kill, or
even wound, wayfarers without some reason. When he was at work
in Paris with any of his bands, and his men brought him prisoners,
he spoke to them with the utmost politeness and gentleness and
made them restore a part of their spoil. Sometimes the affair
was confined to a mere exchange of clothes. When he found in the
pockets of the coat thus exchanged letters of importance, he ran
after its late owner to give them back to him, wished him a pleasant
evening, and gave him the password. It was a maxim of this extraordinary
man that no one ought to be robbed twice on the same night, or
treated too harshly, in order that the Parisians might not take
a dislike to going out in the evening.'</p>

<p>"Since, then, he was opposed to unreasonable murder, it is clear
that this man was not utterly wicked. I regret, however, that,
as far as he himself was concerned, he should have had in the
course of his life a hundred and fifty reasons for assassinating
his contemporaries.</p>

<p>"But to come back to the wax mask, my friend Adolphe and myself
had just descended from the train at Saint-Germain station when
I fancied that I saw among a group of passengers a figure which
I knew. Moved by a sentiment which was not altogether under my
control, I dashed towards the group, but the figure had disappeared.</p>

<p>"'That form is essentially repugnant to me. Where have I seen
it?' said I to myself; and Adolphe asked me the reason of my excitement.
All at once I remembered.</p>

<p>"'I could swear that it was Signor Petito, the Professor of Italian
who lives in the flat above us!' I cried. 'What is Signor Petito
up to at Saint-Germain? He had better not get in my way!'</p>

<p>"'What is it he's done?' said Adolphe, in some surprise at the
emphasis with which I uttered the last sentence.</p>

<p>"'Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing. Only if he gets in my way I swear to
you <em>I'll clip his ears for him</em>!'</p>

<p>"<em>And I would have done as I said, you know.</em></p>

<p>"We went on then, without bothering any more about Signor Petito,
to the Château, that wonderful Château. We went into the museum;
and I was extremely annoyed to find that those chambers which
knew the whole history of France, and would have served as the
frame of our past, even had they been empty, should be serving
to-day as a bazaar for Roman plaster casts, prehistoric arms,
elephants' tusks, and bas-reliefs from the Arch of Constantine.
But my annoyance turned to fury when I learnt that the mask of
Cartouche was not there. I had just stealthily thrust the ferule
of my green umbrella into the eye of a plaster legionary and smashed
it, when an old custodian came to us and said that he was sure
there was a mask of Cartouche at Saint-Germain and he thought
it was in the library; but that had, for a week, been closed for
repairs.</p>

<p>"We decided that we would return at a more favourable opportunity;
for the further the mask withdrew itself, the fiercer I burned
to touch it.</p>

<p>"We went out on to the terrace, for it was a glorious day, and
plunged into the forest, down a magnificent aisle of it, which
brought us to the lodges built in front of the Château by the
desire of Queen Anne of Austria.</p>

<p>"As we reached the left corner of the wall, I thought I once
more recognised, slinking into a thicket, the abominable silhouette
and repulsive face of Signor Petito. Adolphe maintained that I
was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Was it because I was treading this old soil which I knew, because
I found myself in that friendly forest among those familiar trees,
or was it the result of a long, suggestive conversation about
old times and the people of long ago? Of a sudden memory sprang
to birth in me, a very pleasant memory, as sometimes a moving
remembrance of one's youthful days comes back to one, days which
one believed for ever lost, buried in the memory. And then I saw
quite clearly that I was <em>the same</em> soul, for I recalled
Cartouche as if we had not been separated <em>by two hundred years
of death</em>.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had the same soul, a long same soul indeed: at one end
was Cartouche, at the other Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"I remembered the old days; and above all I remembered them when
we had passed the northern wall, plunging always deeper into the
forest. I threw myself down on the turf at the foot of an immemorial
tree, my eyes sparkling with an amazing youthful fire, and looking
round the spot I knew so well, I said:</p>

<p>"'Ah, Adolphe! the last time I was here my fortune was at its
height. I was feared and loved by all. I was even loved, Adolphe,
by my victims, I plundered them so gracefully that afterwards
they went about Paris singing my praises. I was not yet a prey
to that dreadful thirst for blood which was some months later
to drive me to commit the most atrocious crimes. Everything went
well with me, feared and loved by all, I was happy, light-hearted,
of a splendid daring, magnificent in love, of the finest nature
in the world, and <em>master of Paris</em>.</p>

<p>"'Do you remember that glorious September night when we broke
into the house of the Ambassador of Spain, made our way into his
wife's bedroom, took all her embroidered robes of silk and velvet,
a buckle set with twenty-seven large diamonds (one might almost
fancy that it happened yesterday), a necklace of fine pearls,
six gold plates, six gold knives and forks, and ten silver-gilt
goblets (what a thing what a wonderful thing, my dear Adolphe,
the phenomenon of memory is!)? Do you remember how we wrapped
up the jewels and plate in napkins, and went off to supper (oh,
what an evening it was!) at La Belle Hélène's, who, <em>you remember</em>,
kept the Heart tavern?</p>

<p>"Now why, I wonder, did I say '<em>You remember</em>'? It must
be that I regard you as a friend I had in those days, as trusty
as yourself, of whom I was just as fond &mdash;Old Easy-Going&mdash;my
favourite friend. <em>By the throttle of Madame Phalaris!</em>
he was a fine fellow&mdash;sergeant of the City Guard and one of my
lieutenants. What a lot of those City Guards I did have among
my men! Why, when I was arrested, <em>a hundred and fifty of them,
officers and men, fled to the colonies</em> for fear I should
split. They had no need to: torture never drew a word from me!</p>

<p>"'Do you remember the night you were on duty at the Palais-Royal
and stole the Regent's silver-gilt candlesticks?'"</p>

<p>The voice of Theophrastus died dreamily away down the vistas
of the past; but M. Adolphe Lecamus said nothing: his face was
flushed; and he was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Presently Theophrastus woke from his dream to tell his friend
of yet another outrageous exploit, the theft of Mississippi Bonds
to the value of a million and three hundred thousand francs from
the great financier Law. He ended the story by saying, "How two
hundred years do change a man!"</p>

<p>Then he began to laugh at the phrase. He was joking, positively
joking. That is the way with the Parisian tradesman of to-day:
he begins by being scared to death by a mere nothing, and ends
by laughing at everything. Theophrastus Longuet had reached the
point of laughing at himself. The preternatural and terrifying
antithesis between Cartouche and Longuet, which had at first plunged
him into the gloomiest terror, a few days later became a joke!
The wretched man was insulting Destiny! He was mocking the thunder!
His excuse is that he did not realise the gravity of his case.</p>

<p>Adolphe showed but little appreciation of his humour. At dusk
they returned to Paris; and as they came out of Saint-Lazare station,
he said to Theophrastus:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Theophrastus, when you're Cartouche and are walking
about Paris and observing its life, what astonishes you most?
Is it the telephone, or the railway, or the motorcars, or the
Eiffel Tower?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Theophrastus quickly. "It's the policemen!"</p>
