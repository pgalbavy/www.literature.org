<p>By the first of January it became plain that there was not very
much left of Colonel Mallett's fortune, less of his business reputation,
and even less of his wife's health. But she was now able to travel,
and toward the middle of the month she sailed with Naïda and one
maid for Naples, leaving her son to gather up and straighten out
what little of value still remained in the wreckage of the house
of Mallett. What he cared most about was to straighten out his
father's personal reputation; and this was possible only as far
as it concerned Colonel Mallett's individual honesty. But the
rehabilitation was accomplished at the expense of his father's
reputation for business intelligence; and New York never really
excuses such things.</p>

<p>Not much remained after the amounts due every creditor had been
checked up and provided for; and it took practically all Duane
had, almost all Naïda had, and also the sacrifice of the town
house and country villa to properly protect those who had suffered.
Part of his mother's estate remained intact, enough to permit
her and her daughter to live by practising those inconsequential
economies, the necessity for which fills Europe with about the
only sort of Americans cultivated foreigners can tolerate, and
for which predatory Europeans have no use whatever.</p>

<p>As for Duane, matters were now in such shape that he found it
possible to rent a studio with adjoining bath and bedroom&mdash;an
installation which, at one time, was more than he expected to
be able to afford.</p>

<p>The loss of that luxury, which custom had made a necessity, filled
his daily life full of trifling annoyances and surprises which
were often unpleasant and sometimes humorous; but the new and
arid order of things kept him so busy that he had little time
for the apathy, bitterness, or self-commiseration which, in linked
sequence, usually follow sudden disaster.</p>

<p>Sooner or later it was inevitable that he must feel more keenly
the death of a father who, until in the shadow of impending disaster,
had never offered him a very close intimacy. Their relations had
been merely warm and pleasant&mdash;an easy camaraderie between friends&mdash;neither
questioned the other's rights to reticence and privacy. Their
mutual silence concerning business pursuits was instinctive; neither
father nor son understood the other's affairs, nor were they interested
except in the success of a good comrade.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that, in years to come, the realisation of
his loss would become keener and deeper; but now, in the reaction
from shock, and in the anxiety and stress and dire necessity for
activity, only the surface sorrow was understood&mdash;the pity of
it, the distressing circumstances surrounding the death of a good
father, a good friend, and a personally upright man.</p>

<p>The funeral was private; only the immediate family attended.
Duane had written to Geraldine, Kathleen, and Scott not to come,
and he had also asked if he might not go to them when the chance
arrived.</p>

<p>And now the chance had come at last, in the dead of winter; but
the prospect of escape to Geraldine brightened the whole world
for him and gilded the snowy streets of the city with that magic
radiance no flaming planet ever cast.</p>

<p>He had already shipped a crate of canvases to Roya-Neh; his trunk
had gone, and now, checking with an amused shrug a natural impulse
to hail a cab, he swung his suit-case and himself aboard a car,
bound for the Patroons Club, where he meant to lunch before taking
the train for Roya-Neh.</p>

<p>He had not been to the club since the catastrophe and his father's
death, and he was very serious and sombre and slightly embarrassed
when he entered.</p>

<p>A servant took his coat and suit-case with marked but subdued
respect. Men whom he knew and some men whom he scarcely knew at
all made it a point to speak to him or bow to him with a cordiality
too pointed not to affect him, because in it he recognised the
acceptance of what he had fought for&mdash;the verdict that publicly
exonerated his father from anything worse than a bad but honest
mistake.</p>

<p>For a second or two he stood in the great marble rotunda looking
around him. In that club familiar figures were lacking&mdash;men whose
social and financial position only a few months before seemed
impregnable, men who had gone down in ruin, one or two who had
perished by their own hand, several whose physical and financial
stamina had been shattered at the same terrible moment. Some were
ill, some dead, some had resigned, others had been forced to write
their resignations&mdash;such men as Dysart for example, and James
Skelton, now in prison, unable to furnish bail.</p>

<p>But the Patroons was a club of men above the average; a number
among them even belonged to the Pyramid; and the financial disasters
of that summer and winter had spared no club in the five boroughs
and no membership list had been immune from the sinister consequences
of a crash that had resounded from ocean to ocean and had set
humble and great scurrying to cover in every Bourse of the civilised
world.</p>

<p>As he entered the dining-room and passed to his usual table,
he caught sight of Delancy Grandcourt lunching alone at the table
directly behind him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Delancy," he said; "shall we join forces?"</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to; it's very kind of you, Duane," replied Grandcourt,
showing his pleasure at the proposal in the direct honesty of
his response. Few men considered it worth while to cultivate Grandcourt.
To lunch with him was a bore; a tête-à-tête with him assumed the
proportions of a visitation; his slowness and stupidity had become
proverbial in that club; and yet almost the only foundation for
it had been Dysart's attitude toward him; and men's estimate of
him was the more illogical because few men really cared for Dysart's
opinions. But Dysart had introduced him, elected him, and somehow
had contrived to make the public accept his half-sneering measure
of Grandcourt as Grandcourt's true stature. And the man, being
shy, reticent, slow to anger, slower still to take his own part,
was tolerated and good-humouredly avoided when decently possible.
So much for the average man's judgment of an average man.</p>

<p>Seated opposite to Duane, Grandcourt expressed his pleasure at
seeing him with a simplicity that touched the other. Then, in
perfectly good taste, but with great diffidence, he spoke of Duane's
bereavement.</p>

<p>For a little while they asked and answered those amiably formal
questions convention requires under similar circumstances; then
Duane spoke of Dysart gravely, because new rumours were rife concerning
him, even a veiled hint of possible indictment and arrest.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Grandcourt, his heavy features becoming troubled;
"he is a broken man, and no court and jury can punish him more
severely than he has been punished. Nor do I know what they could
get out of him. He has nothing left; everything he possessed has
been turned over. He sits all day in a house that is no longer
his, doing nothing, hoping nothing, hearing nothing, except the
childish babble of his old father or the voices from the hall
below, where his servants are fighting off reporters and cranks
and people with grievances. Oh, I tell you, Duane, it's pitiable,
all right!"</p>

<p>"There was a rumour yesterday of his suicide," said Duane in
a low voice. "I did not credit it."</p>

<p>Grandcourt shook his head: "He never would do that. He totally
lacks whatever you call it&mdash;cowardice or courage&mdash;to do that.
It is not like Dysart; it is not in him to do it. He never will,
never could. I know him, Duane."</p>

<p>Duane nodded.</p>

<p>Grandcourt spoke again: "He cares for few things; life is one
of them. His father, his social position, his harmless&mdash;success
with women&mdash;" Grandcourt hesitated, caught Duane's eye. Both men's
features became expressionless.</p>

<p>Duane said: "I had an exceedingly nice note from Rosalie the
other day. She has bought one of those double-deck apartments&mdash;but
I fancy you know about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandcourt, turning red. "She was good enough to
ask my opinion." He added with a laugh: "I shouldn't think anybody
would want my opinion after the way I've smashed my own affairs."</p>

<p>Duane smiled, too. "I've heard," he said, "that yours was the
decentest smash of the season. What is that scriptural business
about&mdash;about a man who lays down his fortune for a friend?"</p>

<p>"His <em>life</em>," corrected Grandcourt, very red, "but please
don't confound what I did with anything of importance to anybody."
He lighted a cigar from the burning match offered by Duane, very
much embarrassed for a moment, then suddenly brightened up:</p>

<p>"I'm in business now," he observed, with a glance at the other,
partly timid, partly of pride. "My father was thoroughly disgusted
with me&mdash;and nobody blames him&mdash;so he bought me a seat and, Duane,
do you know that I am doing rather well, considering that nobody
is doing anything at all."</p>

<p>Duane laughed heartily, but his mirth did not hurt Grandcourt,
who sat smiling and enjoying his cigar, and looking with confidence
into a face that was so frankly and unusually friendly.</p>

<p>"You know I always admired you, Duane&mdash;even in the days when
you never bothered your head about me," he added naïvely. "Do
you remember at school the caricature you drew of me&mdash;all hands
and feet and face, and absolutely no body? I've got that yet;
and I'm very proud to have it when I hear people speak of your
artistic success. Some day, if I ever have any money again, I'll
ask you to paint a better portrait of me, if you have time."</p>

<p>They laughed again over this mild pleasantry; a cordial understanding
was developing between them, which meant much to Grandcourt, for
he was a lonely man and his shyness had always deprived him of
what he most cared for&mdash;what really might have been his only resource&mdash;the
friendship of other men.</p>

<p>For some time, while they were talking, Duane had noticed out
of the corner of his eye another man at a neighbouring table&mdash;a
thin, pop-eyed, hollow-chested, unhealthy young fellow, who, at
intervals, stared insolently at Grandcourt, and once or twice
contrived to knock over his glass of whiskey while reaching unsteadily
for a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>The man was Stuyvesant Quest, drunk as usual, and evidently in
an unpleasant mood.</p>

<p>Grandcourt's back was toward him; Duane paid him no particular
attention, though at moments he noticed him scowling in their
direction and seemed to hear him fussing and muttering over his
whiskey and soda, which, with cigarettes, comprised his luncheon.</p>

<p>"I wish I were going up to Roya-Neh with you," repeated Grandcourt.
"I had a bully time up there&mdash;everybody was unusually nice to
me, and I had a fine time."</p>

<p>"I know they'll ask you up whenever you can get away," said Duane.
"Geraldine Seagrave likes you immensely."</p>

<p>"Does she?" exclaimed Grandcourt, blushing. "I'd rather believe
that than almost anything! She was very, very kind to me, I can
tell you; and Lord knows why, because I've nothing intellectual
to offer anybody, and I certainly am not pretty!"</p>

<p>Duane, very much amused, looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"When does your train leave?" asked Grandcourt.</p>

<p>"I've an hour yet."</p>

<p>"Come up to my room and smoke. I've better whiskey than we dispense
down here. I'm living at the club, you know. They haven't yet
got over my fiasco at home and I can't stand their joshing."</p>

<p>Neither of the men noticed that a third man followed them, stumbling
up the stairs as they took the elevator. Duane was seated in an
easy chair by the fire, Grandcourt in another, the decanter stood
on a low table between them, when, without formality, the door
opened and young Quest appeared on the threshold, white, self-assertive,
and aggressively at his ease:</p>

<p>"If you fellows don't mind, I'll butt in a moment," he said.
"How are you, Mallett? How are you?" giving Grandcourt an impertinent
look; and added: "Do you, by any chance, expect your friend Dysart
in here this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Dysart is no longer a member of this club," said Grandcourt
quietly. "I've told you that a dozen times."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll ask you two dozen times more, if I choose,"
retorted Quest. "Why not?" And he gave him an ugly stare.</p>

<p>The man was just drunk enough to be quarrelsome. Duane paid him
no further attention; Grandcourt asked him very civilly if he
could do anything for him.</p>

<p>"Sure," sneered Quest. "You can tell Dysart that if I ever come
across him I'll shoot him on sight! Tell him that and be damned!"</p>

<p>"I've already told him that," said Grandcourt with a shrug of
contempt.</p>

<p>The weak, vicious face of the other reddened:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by taking that tone with me?" he demanded loudly.
"Do you think I won't make good?" He fumbled around in his clothing
for a moment and presently jerked a pistol free&mdash;one of the automatic
kind with rubber butt and blued barrel.</p>

<p>"Unless you are drunker than I've ever seen you," said Grandcourt,
"you'll put up that pistol before I do."</p>

<p>Quest cursed him steadily for a minute: "Do you think I haven't
got the nerve to use it when m' honour's 'volved? I tell you,"
he said thickly, "when m' honour's 'volved&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You get drunk, don't you?" observed Duane. "What a pitiful pup
you are, anyway. Go to bed."</p>

<p>Quest stood swaying slightly on his heels and considering Duane
with the inquiring solemnity of one who is in process of grasping
and digesting an abstruse proposition.</p>

<p>"B-bed?" he repeated; "me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. A member of this club disgracefully drunk in the
afternoon will certainly hear from the governing board unless
he keeps out of sight until he's sane again."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Quest with owlish condescension; "I'm indebted
to you for calling 'tention to m-matters which 'volve honour of
m' own club and&#11834;"</p>

<p>His voice rambled off into a mutter; he sat or rather fell into
an armchair and lay there twitching and mumbling to himself and
inspecting his automatic pistol with prominent watery eyes.</p>

<p>"You'd better leave that squirt-gun with me," said Grandcourt.</p>

<p>Quest refused with an oath, and, leaning forward and hammering
the padded chair-arm with his unhealthy looking fist, he broke
out into a violent arraignment of Dysart:</p>

<p>"Damn him!" he yelled, "I've written him, I've asked for an explanation,
I've 'm-manded t' know why his name's coupled with my sister's&#11834;"</p>

<p>Duane leaned over, slammed the door, and turned short on Quest:</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he said sharply. "Do you hear! Shut up!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't shut up! I'll say what I damn please&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Haven't you any decency at all&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've enough to fix Dysart good and plenty, and I'll do it! I'll&mdash;let
go of me, Mallett!&mdash;let go, I tell you or&#11834;"</p>

<p>Duane jerked the pistol from his shaky fingers, and when Quest
struggled to his feet with a baffled howl, jammed him back into
the chair again and handed the pistol to Grandcourt, who locked
it in a bureau drawer and pocketed the key.</p>

<p>"You belong in Matteawan," said the latter, flinging Quest back
into the chair again as the infuriated man still struggled to
rise. "You miserable drunken kid&mdash;do you think you would be enhancing
your sister's reputation by dragging her name into a murder trial?
What are you, anyway? By God, if I didn't know your sister as
a thoroughbred, I'd have you posted here for a mongrel and sent
packing. The pound is your proper place, not a club-house"; which
was an astonishing speech for Delancy Grandcourt.</p>

<p>Again, half contemptuously, but with something almost vicious
in his violence, Grandcourt slammed young Quest back into the
chair from which he had attempted to hurl himself: "Keep quiet,"
he said; "you're a particularly vile little wretch, particularly
pitiable; but your sister is a girl of gentle breeding&mdash;a sweet,
charming, sincere young girl whom everybody admires and respects.
If you are anything but a gutter-mut, you'll respect her, too,
and the only way you can do it is by shutting that unsanitary
whiskey-trap of yours&mdash;and keeping it shut&mdash;and by remaining as
far away from her as you can, permanently."</p>

<p>There were one or two more encounters, brief ones; then Quest
collapsed and began to cry. He was shaking, too, all over, apparently
on the verge of some alcoholic crisis.</p>

<p>Grandcourt went over to Duane:</p>

<p>"The man is sick, helplessly sick in mind and body. If you'll
telephone Bailey at the Knickerbocker Hospital, he'll send an
ambulance and I'll go up there with this fool boy. He's been like
this before. Bailey knows what to do. Telephone from the station;
I don't want the club servants to gossip any more than is necessary.
Do you mind doing it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Duane. He glanced at the miserable, snivelling,
twitching creature by the fire: "Do you think he'll get over this,
or will he buy another pistol the next time he gets the jumps?"</p>

<p>Grandcourt looked troubled:</p>

<p>"I don't know what this breed is likely to do. He's absolutely
no good. He's the only person in the world that is left of the
family&mdash;except his sister. He's all she has had to look out for
her&mdash;a fine legacy, a fine prop for her to lean on. That's the
sort of protection she has had all her life; that's the example
set her in her own home. I don't know what she's done; it's none
of my business; but, Duane, I'm for her!"</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>They stood together in silence for a moment; maudlin sniffles
of self-pity arose from the corner by the fire, alternating with
more hysterical and more ominous sounds presaging some spasmodic
crisis.</p>

<p>Grandcourt said: "Bunny Gray has helped me kennel this pup once
or twice. He's in the club; I think I'll send for him."</p>

<p>"You'll need help," nodded Duane. "I'll call up the hospital
on my way to the station. Good-bye, Delancy."</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>At the station Duane telephoned to the hospital, got Dr. Bailey,
arranged for a room in a private ward, and had barely time to
catch his train&mdash;in fact, he was in such a hurry that he passed
by without seeing the sister of the very man for whom he had been
making such significant arrangements.</p>

<p>She wore, as usual, her pretty chinchilla furs, but was so closely
veiled that he might not have recognised her under any circumstances.
She, however, forgetting that she was veiled, remained uncertain
as to whether his failure to speak to her had been intentional
or otherwise. She had halted, expecting him to speak; now she
passed on, cheeks burning, a faint sinking sensation in her heart.</p>

<p>For she cared a great deal about Duane's friendship; and she
was very unhappy, and morbid and more easily wounded than ever,
because somehow it had come to her ears that rumour was busily
hinting things unthinkable concerning her&mdash;nothing definite; yet
the very vagueness of it added to her distress and horror.</p>

<p>Around her silly head trouble was accumulating very fast since
Jack Dysart had come sauntering into her youthful isolation; and
in the beginning it had been what it usually is to lonely hearts&mdash;shy
and grateful recognition of a friendship that flattered; fascination,
an infatuation, innocent enough, until the man in the combination
awoke her to the terrors of stranger emotions involving her deeper
and deeper until she lost her head, and he, for the first time
in all his career, lost his coolly selfish caution.</p>

<p>How any rumours concerning herself and him had arisen nobody
could explain. There never is any explanation. But they always
arise.</p>

<p>In their small but pretty house, terrible scenes had already
occurred between her and her brother&mdash;consternation, anger, and
passionate denial on her part; on his, fury, threats, maudlin
paroxysms of self-pity, and every attitude that drink and utter
demoralisation can distort into a parody on what a brother might
say and do.</p>

<p>To escape it she had gone to Tuxedo for a week; now, fear and
foreboding had brought her back&mdash;fear intensified at the very
threshold of the city when Duane seemed to look straight at her
and pass her by without recognition. Men don't do that, but she
was too inexperienced to know it; and she hastened on with a heavy
heart, found a taxi-cab to take her to the only home she had ever
known, descended, and rang for admittance.</p>

<p>In these miserable days she had come to look for hidden meaning
even in the expressionless faces of her trained servants, and
now she misconstrued the respectful smile of welcome, brushed
hastily past the maid who admitted her, and ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Except for the servants she was alone. She rang for information
concerning her brother; nobody had any. He had not been home in
a week.</p>

<p>Her toilet, after the journey, took her two hours or more to
accomplish; it was dark at five o'clock and snowing heavily when
tea was served. She tasted it, then, unable to subdue her restlessness,
went to the telephone; and after a long delay, heard the voice
she tremblingly expected:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Jack?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"H-how are you?"</p>

<p>"Not very well."</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything new about certain proceedings?" she
inquired tremulously.</p>

<p>"Yes; she's begun them."</p>

<p>"On&mdash;on w-what grounds?"</p>

<p>"Not on any grounds to scare you. It will be a Western matter."</p>

<p>Her frightened sigh of relief turned her voice to a whisper:</p>

<p>"Has Stuyve&mdash;has a certain relative&mdash;annoyed you since I've been
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, over the telephone, drunk, as usual."</p>

<p>"Did he make&mdash;make any more threats, Jack?"</p>

<p>"The usual string. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said; "he hasn't been home in a week, they
tell me. Jack, do you think it safe for you to drop in here for
a few moments before dinner?"</p>

<p>"Just as you say. If he comes in, there may be trouble. Which
isn't a good idea, on your account."</p>

<p>No woman in such circumstances is moved very much by an appeal
to her caution.</p>

<p>"But I want to see you, Jack," she said miserably.</p>

<p>"That seems to be the only instinct that governs you," he retorted,
slightly impatient. "Can't you ever learn the elements of prudence?
It seems to me about time that you substituted common sense for
immature impulse in dealing with present problems."</p>

<p>His voice was cold, emotionless, unpleasant. She stood with the
receiver at her ears, flushing to the tips of them under his rebuke.
She always did; she had known many, recently, but the quick pang
of pain was never any less keen. On the contrary.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to see me? I have been away for ten days."</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to see you, of course, but I'm not anxious to spring
a mine under myself&mdash;under us both by going into your house at
this time."</p>

<p>"My brother has not been here in a week."</p>

<p>"Does that accidental fact bar his possible appearance ten minutes
from now?"</p>

<p>She wondered, vaguely, whether he was afraid of anything except
possible damage to her reputation. She had, lately, considered
this question on several occasions. Being no coward, as far as
mere fear for her life was concerned, she found it difficult to
attribute such fear to him. Indeed, one of the traits in her which
he found inexplicable and which he disliked was a curious fearlessness
of death&mdash;not uncommon among women who, all their lives, have
had little to live for.</p>

<p>She said: "If I am not worth a little risk, what is my value
to you?"</p>

<p>"You talk like a baby," he retorted. "Is an interview worth risking
a scandal that will spatter the whole town?"</p>

<p>"I never count such risks," she said wearily. "Do as you please."</p>

<p>His voice became angry: "Haven't I enough to face already without
hunting more trouble at present? I supposed I could look to you
for sympathy and aid and common sense, and every day you call
me up and demand that I shall drop everything and fling caution
to the winds, and meet you somewhere! Every day of the year you
do it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I have been away ten days&mdash;" she faltered, turning sick and
white at the words he was shouting through the telephone.</p>

<p>"Well, it was understood you'd stay for a month, wasn't it? Can't
you give me time to turn around? Can't you give me half a chance?
Do you realise what I'm facing? <em>Do</em> you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm sorry I called you; I was so miserable and lonely&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, try to think of somebody besides yourself. You're not
the only miserable person in this city. I've all the misery I
can carry at present; and if you wish to help me, don't make any
demands on me until I'm clear of the tangle that's choking me."</p>

<p>"Dear, I only wanted to help you&mdash;" she stammered, appalled at
his tone and words.</p>

<p>"All right, then, let me alone!" he snarled, losing all self-command.
"I've stood about all of this I'm going to, from you and your
brother both! Is that plain? I want to be let alone. That is plainer
still, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. Her face had become deathly white; she stood
frozen, motionless, clutching the receiver in her small hand.</p>

<p>His voice altered as he spoke again:</p>

<p>"Don't feel hurt; I lost my temper and I ask your pardon. But
I'm half crazy with worry&mdash;you've seen to-day's papers, I suppose&mdash;so
you can understand a man's losing his temper. Please forgive me;
I'll try to see you when I can&mdash;when it's advisable. Does that
satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a dull voice.</p>

<p>She put away the receiver and, turning, dropped onto her bed.
At eight o'clock the maid who had come to announce dinner found
her young mistress lying there, clenched hands over her eyes,
lying slim and rigid on her back in the darkness.</p>

<p>When the electric lamps were lighted she rose, went to the mirror
and looked steadily at herself for a long, long time.</p>

<p>She tasted what was offered, seeing nothing, hearing nothing;
later, in her room, a servant came saying that Mr. Gray begged
a moment's interview on a matter of importance connected with
her brother.</p>

<p>It was the only thing that could have moved her to see him. She
had denied herself to him all that winter; she had been obliged
to make it plainer after a letter from him&mdash;a nice, stupid, boyish
letter, asking her to marry him. And her reply terminated the
attempts of Bunbury Gray to secure a hearing from the girl who
had apparently taken so sudden and so strange an aversion to a
man who had been nice to her all her life.</p>

<p>They had, at one time, been virtually engaged, after Geraldine
Seagrave had cut him loose, and before Dysart took the trouble
to seriously notice her. But Bunny was youthful and frisky and
his tastes were catholic, and it did not seem to make much difference
that Dysart again stepped casually between them in his graceful
way. Yet, curiously enough, each preserved for the other a shy
sort of admiration which, until last autumn, had made their somewhat
infrequent encounters exceedingly interesting. Autumn had altered
their attitudes; Bunny became serious in proportion to the distance
she put between them&mdash;which is of course the usual incentive to
masculine importunity. They had had one or two little scenes at
Roya-Neh; the girl even hesitated, unquietly curious, perplexed
at her own attitude, yet diffidently interested in the man.</p>

<p>A straw was all that her balance required to incline it; Dysart
dropped it, casually. And there were no more pretty scenes between
Bunny Gray and his lady-love that autumn, only sulks from the
youth, and, after many attempts to secure a hearing, a very direct
and honest letter that winter, which had resulted in his dismissal.</p>

<p>She came down to the drawing-room, looking the spectre of herself,
but her stillness and self-possession kept Bunny at his distance,
staring, restless, amazed&mdash;all of which very evident symptoms
and emotions she ignored.</p>

<p>"I have your message," she said. "Has anything happened to my
brother?"</p>

<p>He began: "You mustn't be alarmed, but he is not very well&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I am alarmed. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In the Knickerbocker Hospital."</p>

<p>"Seriously ill?"</p>

<p>"No. He is in a private ward&#11834;"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;alcoholic?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, flushing with the shame that had not burnt her
white face.</p>

<p>"May I go to him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed, horrified.</p>

<p>She seated herself, hands folded loosely on her lap:</p>

<p>"What am I to do, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.... I only came to tell you so that you'd know. To-morrow
if you care to telephone Bailey&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes; thank you." She closed her eyes; opened them with an effort.</p>

<p>"If you'll let me, Sylvia, I'll keep you informed," he ventured.</p>

<p>"Would you? I'd be very glad."</p>

<p>"Sure thing!" he said with great animation; "I'll go to the hospital
as many times a day as I am allowed, and I'll bring you back a
full account of Stuyve's progress after every visit.... May I,
Sylvie?"</p>

<p>She said nothing. He sat looking at her. He had no great amount
of intellect, but he possessed an undue proportion of heart under
the somewhat striking waistcoats which at all times characterised
his attire.</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry for you," he said, his eyes very wide and
round.</p>

<p>She gazed into space, past him.</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;would you prefer to have me go?" he stammered.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Because," he said miserably, "I take it that you haven't much
use for me."</p>

<p>No word from her.</p>

<p>"Sylvie?"</p>

<p>Silence; but she looked up at him. "I haven't changed," he said,
and the healthy colour turned him pink. "<em>I&mdash;</em>just&mdash;wanted
you to know. I thought perhaps you might like to know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why?" Her voice was utterly unlike her own.</p>

<p>"Why?" he repeated, getting redder. "I don't know &mdash;I only
thought you might&mdash;it might&mdash;amuse you&mdash;to know that I haven't
changed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"As others have? Is that what you mean, Bunny?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I didn't think &mdash;I didn't mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did. Why not say it to me? You mean that you, and others,
have heard rumours. You mean that you, unlike others, are trying
to make me understand that you are still loyal to me. Is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes. Good Lord! Loyal! Why, of course I am. Why, you didn't
suppose I'd be anything else, did you?"</p>

<p>She opened her pallid lips to speak and could not.</p>

<p>"Loyal!" he repeated indignantly. "There's no merit in that when
a man's been in love with a girl all his life and didn't know
it until she'd got good and tired of him! You know I'm for you
every time, Sylvia; what's the game in pretending you didn't know
it?"</p>

<p>"No game.... I didn't&mdash;know it."</p>

<p>"Well, you do now, don't you?"</p>

<p>Her face was colourless as marble. She said, looking at him:
"Suppose the rumour is true?"</p>

<p>His face flamed: "You don't know what you are saying!" he retorted,
horrified.</p>

<p>"Suppose it is true?"</p>

<p>"Sylvia&mdash;for Heaven's sake&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Suppose it <em>is</em> true," she repeated in a dead, even voice;
"how loyal would you remain to me then?"</p>

<p>"As loyal as I am now!" he answered angrily, "if you insist on
my answering such a silly question&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is that your answer?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you <em>sure</em>?"</p>

<p>He glared at her; something struck coldly through him, checking
breath and pulse, then releasing both till the heavy beating of
his heart made speech impossible.</p>

<p>"I thought you were not sure," she said.</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> sure!" he broke out. "Good God, Sylvia, what are
you doing to me?"</p>

<p>"Destroying your faith in me."</p>

<p>"You can't! I love you!"</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp:</p>

<p>"The rumour <em>is</em> true," she said.</p>

<p>He reeled to his feet; she sat looking up at him, white, silent
hands twisted on her lap.</p>

<p>"Now you know," she managed to say. "Why don't you go? If you've
any self-respect, you'll go. I've told you what I am; do you want
me to speak more plainly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Very well; what do you wish to know?"</p>

<p>"Only one thing.... Do you&mdash;care for him?"</p>

<p>She sat, minute after minute, head bent, thinking, thinking.
He never moved a muscle; and at last she lifted her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Could you care for&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>She made a gesture as though to check him, half rose, fell back,
sat swaying a moment, and suddenly tumbled over sideways, lying
a white heap on the rug at his feet.</p>
