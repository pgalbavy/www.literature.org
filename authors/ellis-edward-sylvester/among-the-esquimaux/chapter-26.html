<p>By daybreak, when all the party were awake, the blizzard foretold
by the native had fully arrived.</p>

<p>It was a terror, indeed. The cold was frightful, and the air
outside was white with snow, which was driven horizontally by
the hurricane, as though shot from the mouths of myriad pieces
of ordnance. It shrieked about the cavern, and drove the white
particles so fiercely through the narrow crevice that Docak hastened
to shove his bear-skin into it. This only partially filled the
opening and the snow spun in around it clean across the flinty
floor.</p>

<p>The regular entrance was partly protected by its own projection,
but, at times, a blast entered that fairly took away their breath.
The fire was necessary to keep from freezing, but the supply of
fuel was growing low, and the last stick must soon be reached.
What then would be the fate of the party if the blizzard continued?</p>

<p>It was useless to discuss the future and no one did so; the present
was with them, and the question was how to live from hour to hour.</p>

<p>On shooting the intruding wolf, Rob had flung his carcass away.
The report awakened the others, and, rising to his feet, Docak
passed far enough outside to bring it in again. He did not speak,
but all understood the meaning of the action; that body might
be the means of saving them from starvation.</p>

<p>Enough of the previous night's meal remained to afford a nourishing
breakfast, but they partook sparingly, preferring to use that
in preference to the new supply. Happily thirst was a torture
that need never be apprehended.</p>

<p>Jack Cosgrove braved the blast to that degree that he forced
himself through the opening and stood several minutes outside,
shading his eyes and striving to pierce the blinding turmoil.</p>

<p>All in vain. The gale almost carried him off his feet, and his
vision could no more penetrate the furious swirl of snow than
if it were the darkest night that ever covered the earth. The
cold was so piercing that he was glad to hasten back among his
friends, and shiver and crouch over the fire.</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon, Docak! s'pose we had started for
home last night?"</p>

<p>"Wish had," was the sententious response.</p>

<p>"Why, we wouldn't have been half-way there by this time, and
we would have perished all together."</p>

<p>"We trabel fast&mdash;mebbe storm not dere yet."</p>

<p>This intimation that the blizzard might be less terrific at so
slight a distance was incredible, but the Esquimau was positive
that it would have been far better had they set out early in the
evening. By rapid traveling they might have covered the greater
part of the distance before morning, and could have fought the
few remaining miles in the teeth of the gale.</p>

<p>But it was equally useless to discuss what might have been. They
were imprisoned in the cavern, thirty miles from succor and with
no possibility that any friends would ever take the trouble to
search for their bodies. All they could do was to rely upon Heaven
and their own exertions.</p>

<p>Without any explanation as to his intentions, and leaving his
gun behind him, the native plunged through the opening and disappeared
in the blizzard outside.</p>

<p>Born and reared in Greenland, amid Arctic snows and appalling
tempests, the hardy Esquimau was far better fitted to undergo
such trials of endurance than could be any native of a temperate
clime.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose he has gone?" asked Rob, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Jack; "but if he goes far he'll never
come back again."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem to me," said Fred, coming to the question of
the present for the first time, "that the outlook is as bad as
he would make us believe."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We have enough food to last a week or two, or even longer, and
the blizzard certainly won't keep it up that long."</p>

<p>"You can't be sartin about that," said Jack; "it may last for
several weeks, but s'pose it's only for three or four days, there
are two big things that we must face."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"What to do after it stops; the snow will be several feet deep
on top of that which is now on the ground; it will be too fine
and soft to bear our weight, and can be traveled over only with
snow-shoes which we haven't got. How then are we going to fight
our way thirty miles through it?"</p>

<p>"It will be a hard job, but no greater than that which many explorers
have undergone. With Docak as our guide, I think we can pull through."</p>

<p>"But what is the other matter you refer to?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"This wood will soon go, and then how are we going to keep from
freezing to death?"</p>

<p>"If we will huddle together as closely as we can with the bear-skin
wrapped about us I think we can stand it."</p>

<p>"I like the way you chaps talk," said the sailor, admiringly,
"and if we have to go down we'll do so with colors flying. It's
the downheartedness of Docak that knocks me askew; if he would
show a braver front I would feel better."</p>

<p>"Possibly he is more hopeful than he pretends."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't that sort of chap; he knows better than we just
what all this means. Whew!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by a sudden outburst that sent the
snow whirling through the opening and the crevice, from which
the bear-skin dropped, as if struck a blow from the other side.
Jack ran forward, picked it up, and thrust it back, hardly able
to breathe from the fury of the gale in his face.</p>

<p>The snow shot through the opening, too, scattering the brands
of fire in every direction. Had the shelter been anything else
excepting the solid rock that it was, it must have been swept
like chaff from its foundations.</p>

<p>The explosion, as it may be called, lasted but a minute or so.
The boys hastily gathered up the scattered brands and flinging
them together they were fanned by the tempest into a vigorous
flame, whose warmth, slight as it was, was grateful beyond measure
to the three gathered around it.</p>

<p>"Docak is wrong in regretting that we did not start last night,"
said Jack Cosgrove; "that style of storm is raging at this moment
over hundreds of miles, and it would have made short work of us."</p>

<p>"What about the 'Nautilus,' if she is in it?"</p>

<p>"She can manage it if she has plenty of sea room, but I hope
she is far enough off to dodge this blizzard. She ought to be
at any rate."</p>

<p>The gale did the party an unexpected favor. It was a substantial
one, too, which they appreciated. It drove the snow against the
troublesome crevice with such fury that it quickly formed a solid
bank, extending far above it. This ended the drifting of the particles
inside and protected them from the cutting wind.</p>

<p>At the same time it did something of the same nature with the
entrance, where it soon became banked to that extent that little
blew within, and the gale hardly disturbed them.</p>

<p>Seeing what had taken place, Jack withdrew the bear-skin from
where it had been stuffed into the opening and spread it in the
farthermost corner of the cavern.</p>

<p>"Come, my hearties," said he, cheerfully, "we've got nothing
to do but to make ourselves comfortable. We won't burn any more
wood till Docak comes back."</p>

<p>They huddled together, and, though the cold made their teeth
chatter and their bodies shiver, they found considerable relief
and were willing to hope on.</p>

<p>They could feel no anxiety about the absent native. It was certain
he would not go far enough from the cavern to endanger his safety
or to imperil his return. Some definite object must have led him
forth.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it is for food," suggested Fred.</p>

<p>"No; for there's no possibility that the wolves left anything,"
replied Rob; "and then, too, we have enough to last a good while."</p>

<p>At that moment there was a flurry at the entrance and the Esquimau,
resembling a snow man, stooped and pushed his way in.</p>

<p>Entering, he flung a half-dozen small sticks upon the tiny pile
at the side of the cavern. He had gone forth in quest of fuel
and was able to secure only that miserable supply, really not
worth taking into account.</p>
