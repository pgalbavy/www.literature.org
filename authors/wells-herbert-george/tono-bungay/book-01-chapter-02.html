I
<P>
When I was thus banished from Bladesover House, as it was then
thought for good and all, I was sent by my mother in a vindictive
spirit, first to her cousin Nicodemus Frapp, and then, as a
fully indentured apprentice, to my uncle Ponderevo.
<P>
I ran away from the care of my cousin Nicodemus back to
Bladesover House.
<P>
My cousin Nicodemus Frapp was a baker in a back street--a slum
rather--just off that miserable narrow mean high road that
threads those exquisite beads, Rochester and Chatham.  He was, I
must admit, a shock to me, much dominated by a young, plump,
prolific, malingering wife; a bent, slow-moving, unwilling dark
man with flour in his hair and eyelashes, in the lines of his
face and the seams of his coat.  I've never had a chance to
correct my early impression of him, and he still remains an
almost dreadful memory, a sort of caricature of incompetent
simplicity.  As I remember him, indeed, he presented the servile
tradition perfected.  He had no pride in his person; fine clothes
and dressing up wasn't "for the likes of" him, so that he got his
wife, who was no artist at it, to cut his black hair at irregular
intervals, and let his nails become disagreeable to the
fastidious eye; he had no pride in his business nor any
initiative; his only virtues were not doing certain things and
hard work.  "Your uncle," said my mother--all grown-up cousins
were uncles by courtesy among the Victorian middle-class-- "isn't
much to look at or talk to, but he's a Good Hard-Working Man." 
There was a sort of base honourableness about toil, however
needless, in that system of inversion.  Another point of honour
was to rise at or before dawn, and then laboriously muddle about.
<P>
It was very distinctly impressed  on my mind that the Good
Hard-Working Man would have thought it "fal-lallish" to own a
pocket handkerchief.  Poor old Frapp--dirty and crushed by,
product of, Bladesover's magnificence!  He made no fight against
the world at all, he was floundering in small debts that were not
so small but that finally they overwhelmed him, whenever there
was occasion for any exertion his wife fell back upon pains and
her "condition,"  and God sent them many children, most of whom
died, and so, by their coming and going, gave a double exercise
in the virtues of submission.
<P>
Resignation to God's will was the common device of these people
in the face of every duty and every emergency.  There were no
books in the house; I doubt if either of them had retained the
capacity for reading consecutively for more than a minute or so,
and it was with amazement that day after day, over and above
stale bread, one beheld food and again more food amidst the
litter that held permanent session on the living-room table.
<P>
One might have doubted if either of them felt discomfort in this
dusty darkness of existence, if it was not that they did visibly
seek consolation.  They sought this and found it of a Sunday, not
in strong drink and raving, but in imaginary draughts of blood. 
They met with twenty or thirty other darkened and unclean people,
all dressed in dingy colours that would not show the dirt, in a
little brick-built chapel equipped with a spavined roarer of a
harmonium, and there solaced their minds on the thought that all
that was fair and free in life, all that struggled, all that
planned and made, all pride and beauty and honour, all fine and
enjoyable things, were irrevocably damned to everlasting
torments.  They were the self-appointed confidants of God's
mockery of his own creation.  So at any rate they stick in my
mind.  Vaguer, and yet hardly less agreeable than this cosmic
jest, this coming "Yah, clever!" and general serving out and
"showing up" of the lucky, the bold, and the cheerful, was their
own predestination to Glory.
<P>
      "There is a Fountain, filled with Blood
        Drawn from Emmanuel's Veins,"
<P>
so they sang.  I hear the drone and wheeze of that hymn now.  I
hated them with the bitter uncharitable condemnation of boyhood,
and a twinge of that hate comes back to me.  As I write the
words, the sounds and then the scene return, these obscure,
undignified people, a fat woman with asthma, an old Welsh
milk-seller with a tumour on his bald head, who was the
intellectual leader of the sect, a huge-voiced haberdasher with a
big black beard, a white-faced, extraordinarily pregnant woman,
his wife, a spectacled rate collector with a bent back.... I
hear the talk about souls, the strange battered old phrases that
were coined ages ago in the seaports of the sun-dry Levant, of
balm of Gilead and manna in the desert, of gourds that give shade
and water in a thirsty land; I recall again the way in which at
the conclusion of the service the talk remained pious in form but
became medical in substance, and how the women got together for
obstetric whisperings.  I, as a boy, did not matter, and might
overhear.
<P>
If Bladesover is my key for the explanation of England, I think
my invincible persuasion that I understand Russia was engendered
by the circle of Uncle Frapp.
<P>
I slept in a dingy sheeted bed with the two elder survivors of
Frapp fecundity, and spent my week days in helping in the
laborious disorder of the shop and bakehouse, in incidental
deliveries of bread and so forth, and in parrying the probings of
my uncle into my relations with the Blood, and his confidential
explanations that ten shillings a week--which was what my mother
paid him--was not enough to cover my accommodation.  He was very
anxious to keep that, but also he wanted more.  There were
neither books nor any seat nor corner in that house where reading
was possible, no newspaper ever brought the clash of worldly
things into its heavenward seclusion; horror of it all grew in me
daily, and whenever I could I escaped into the streets and
tramped about Chatham.  The news shops appealed to me
particularly.  One saw there smudgy illustrated sheets, the
Police News in particular, in which vilely drawn pictures brought
home to the dullest intelligence an interminable succession of
squalid crimes, women murdered and put into boxes, buried under
floors, old men bludgeoned at midnight by robbers, people thrust
suddenly out of trains, happy lovers shot, vitrioled and so forth
by rivals.  I got my first glimpse of the life of pleasure in
foully drawn pictures of "police raids" on this and that. 
Interspersed with these sheets were others in which Sloper, the
urban John Bull, had his fling with gin bottle and obese
umbrella, or the kindly empty faces of the Royal Family appeared
and reappeared, visiting this, opening that, getting married,
getting offspring, lying in state, doing everything but anything,
a wonderful, good-meaning, impenetrable race apart.
<P>
I have never revisited Chatham; the impression it has left on my
mind is one of squalid compression, unlit by any gleam of a
maturer charity.  All its effects arranged themselves as
antithetical to the Bladesover effects.  They confirmed and
intensified all that Bladesover  suggested.  Bladesover declared
itself to be the land, to be essentially England; I have already
told how its airy spaciousness, its wide dignity, seemed to
thrust village, church, and vicarage into corners, into a
secondary  and conditional significance.  Here one gathered the
corollary of that.  Since the whole wide country of Kent was
made up of contiguous Bladesovers and for the gentlefolk, the
surplus of population, all who were not good tenants nor good
labourers, Church of England, submissive and respectful, were
necessarily thrust together, jostled out of sight, to fester as
they might in this place that had the colours and even the smells
of a well-packed dustbin.  They should be grateful even for
that; that, one felt, was the theory of it all.
<P>
And I loafed about this wilderness of crowded dinginess, with
young, receptive, wide-open eyes, and through the blessing (or
curse) of some fairy godmother of mine, asking and asking again: 
"But after all, WHY--"
<P>
I wandered up through Rochester once, and had a glimpse of the
Stour valley above the town, all horrible with cement works and
foully smoking chimneys and rows of workmen's cottages, minute,
ugly, uncomfortable, and grimy.  So I had my first intimation of
how industrialism must live in a landlord's land.  I spent some
hours, too, in the streets that give upon the river, drawn by the
spell of the sea.  But I saw barges and ships stripped of magic
and mostly devoted to cement, ice, timber, and coal.  The sailors
looked to me gross and slovenly men, and the shipping struck me
as clumsy, ugly, old, and dirty.  I discovered that most sails
don't fit the ships that hoist them, and that there may be as
pitiful and squalid a display of poverty with a vessel as with a
man.  When I saw colliers unloading, watched the workers in the
hold filling up silly little sacks and the succession of
blackened, half-naked men that ran to and fro with these along a
plank over a thirty-foot drop into filth and mud, I was first
seized with admiration  of their courage and toughness and then,
"But after all, WHY--?" and the stupid ugliness of all this waste
of muscle and endurance came home to me.  Among other things it
obviously wasted and deteriorated the coal....  And I had
imagined great things of the sea!
<P>
Well, anyhow, for a time that vocation was stilled.
<P>
But such impressions came into my leisure, and of that I had no
excess.  Most of my time was spent doing things for Uncle Frapp,
and my evenings and nights perforce in the company of the two
eldest of my cousins.  He was errand boy at an oil shop and
fervently pious, and of him I saw nothing until the evening
except at meals; the other was enjoying the midsummer holidays
without any great elation; a singularly  thin and abject, stunted
creature he was, whose chief liveliness was to pretend to be a
monkey, and who I am now convinced had some secret disease that
drained his vitality away.  If I met him now I should think him a
pitiful little creature and be extremely sorry for him.  Then I
felt only a wondering aversion.  He sniffed horribly, he was
tired out by a couple of miles of loafing, he never started any
conversation, and he seemed to prefer his own company to mine. 
His mother, poor woman, said he was the "thoughtful one."
<P>
Serious trouble came suddenly out of a conversation we held in
bed one night.  Some particularly pious phrase of my elder
cousin's irritated me extremely, and I avowed outright my entire
disbelief in the whole scheme of revealed religion.  I had never
said a word about my doubts to any one before, except to Ewart
who had first evolved them.  I had never settled my doubts until
at this moment when I spoke.  But it came to me then that the
whole scheme of salvation of the Frappes was not simply doubtful,
but impossible.  I fired this discovery out into the darkness
with the greatest promptitude.
<P>
My abrupt denials certainly scared my cousin amazingly.
<P>
At first they could not understand what I was saying, and when
they did I fully believe they expected an instant answer in
thunderbolts and flames.  They gave me more room in the bed
forthwith, and then the elder sat up and expressed his sense of
my awfulness.  I was already a little frightened at my temerity,
but when he asked me categorically to unsay what I had said, what
could I do but confirm my repudiation?
<P>
"There's no hell," I said, "and no eternal punishment.  No God
would be such a fool as that."
<P>
My elder cousin cried aloud in horror, and the younger lay
scared, but listening.  "Then you mean," said my elder cousin,
when at last he could bring himself to argue, "you might do just
as you liked?"
<P>
"If you were cad enough," said I.
<P>
Our little voices went on interminably, and at one stage my
cousin got out of bed and made his brother do likewise, and knelt
in the night dimness and prayed at me.  That I found trying, but
I held out valiantly.  "Forgive him, "said my cousin, "he knows
not what he sayeth."
<P>
"You can pray if you like," I said, "but if you're going to cheek
me in your prayers I draw the line."
<P>
The last I remember of that great discussion was my cousin
deploring the fact that he "should ever sleep in the same bed
with an Infidel!"
<P>
The next day he astonished me by telling the whole business to
his father.  This was quite outside all my codes.  Uncle
Nicodemus sprang it upon me at the midday meal.
<P>
"You been sayin' queer things, George," he said abruptly.  "You
better mind what you're saying."
<P>
"What did he say, father?" said Mrs. Frapp.
<P>
"Things I couldn't' repeat," said he.
<P>
"What things?" I asked hotly.
<P>
"Ask 'IM," said my uncle, pointing with his knife to his
informant, and making me realise the nature of my offence.  My
aunt looked at the witness.  "Not--?" she framed a question.
<P>
"Wuss," said my uncle.  "Blarsphemy."
<P>
My aunt couldn't touch another mouthful.  I was already a little
troubled in my conscience by my daring, and now I began to feel
the black enormity of the course upon which I had embarked.
<P>
"I was only talking sense," I said.
<P>
I had a still more dreadful moment when presently I met my cousin
in the brick alley behind the yard, that led back to his grocer's
shop.
<P>
"You sneak!" I said, and smacked his face hard forthwith.  "Now
then," said I.
<P>
He started back, astonished and alarmed.  His eyes met mine, and
I saw a sudden gleam of resolution.  He turned his other cheek to
me.
<P>
"'It 'it," he said."'It 'it.  I'LL forgive you."
<P>
I felt I had never encountered a more detestable way of evading a
licking.  I shoved him against the wall and left him there,
forgiving me, and went back into the house.
<P>
"You better not speak to your cousins, George," said my aunt,
"till you're in a better state of mind."
<P>
I became an outcast forthwith.  At supper that night a gloomy
silence was broken by my cousin saying
<P>
"'E 'it me for telling you, and I turned the other cheek,
muvver."
<P>
"'E's got the evil one be'ind 'im now, a ridin' on 'is back,"
said my aunt, to the grave discomfort of the eldest girl, who sat
beside me.
<P>
After supper my uncle, in a few ill-chosen words, prayed me to
repent before I slept.
<P>
"Suppose you was took in your sleep, George," he said; "where'd
you be then?  You jest think of that me boy."  By this time I was
thoroughly miserable and frightened, and this suggestion unnerved
me dreadfully but I kept up an impenitent front.  "To wake in
'ell," said Uncle Nicodemus, in gentle tones.  "You don't want to
wake in 'ell, George, burnin' and screamin' for ever, do you? 
You wouldn't like that?"
<P>
He tried very hard to get me to "jest 'ave a look at the
bake'ouse fire" before I retired.  "It might move you," he said.
<P>
I was awake longest that night.  My cousins slept, the sleep of
faith on either side of me.  I decided I would whisper my
prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, and perhaps
also because I had an idea one didn't square God like that.
<P>
"No," I said, with a sudden confidence, "damn me if you're coward
enough.... But you're not.  No! You couldn't be!"
<P>
I woke my cousins up with emphatic digs, and told them as much,
triumphantly, and went very peacefully to sleep with my act of
faith accomplished.
<P>
I slept not only through that night, but for all my nights since
then.  So far as any fear of Divine injustice  goes, I sleep
soundly, and shall, I know, to the end of things.  That
declaration was an epoch in my spiritual life.
<P>
II
<P>
But I didn't expect to have the whole meeting on Sunday turned on
to me.
<P>
It was.  It all comes back to me, that convergence of attention,
even the faint leathery smell of its atmosphere returns, and the
coarse feel of my aunt's black dress beside me in contact with my
hand.  I see again the old Welsh milkman "wrestling" with me,
they all wrestled with me, by prayer or exhortation.  And I was
holding out stoutly, though convinced now by the contagion of
their universal conviction that by doing so I was certainly and
hopelessly damned.  I felt that they were right, that God was
probably like them, and that on the whole it didn't matter.  And
to simplify the business thoroughly I had declared I didn't
believe anything at all.  They confuted me by texts from
Scripture which I now perceive was an illegitimate method of
reply.  When I got home, still impenitent and eternally lost and
secretly very lonely and miserable and alarmed, Uncle Nicodemus
docked my Sunday pudding.
<P>
One person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of
wrath, and that was the younger Frapp. He came up to me in the
afternoon while I was confined upstairs with a Bible and my own
thoughts.
<P>
"'Ello," he said, and fretted about.
<P>
"D'you mean to say there isn't--no one," he said, funking the
word.
<P>
"No one?"
<P>
"No one watching yer--always."
<P>
"Why should there be?" I asked.
<P>
"You can't 'elp thoughts," said my cousin, "anyhow. You mean--"
He stopped hovering.  "I s'pose I oughtn't to be talking to you."
<P>
He hesitated and flitted away with a guilty back glance over his
shoulder....
<P>
The following week made life quite intolerable for me; these
people forced me at last into an Atheism that terrified me.  When
I learnt that next Sunday the wrestling was to be resumed, my
courage failed me altogether.
<P>
I happened upon a map of Kent in a stationer's window on
Saturday, and that set me thinking of one form of release.  I
studied it intently for half an hour perhaps, on Saturday night,
got a route list of villages well fixed in my memory, and got up
and started for Bladesover about five on Sunday morning while my
two bed mates were still fast asleep.
<P>
III
<P>
I remember something, but not so much of it as I should like to
recall, of my long tramp to Bladesover House.  The distance from
Chatham is almost exactly seventeen miles, and it took me until
nearly one.  It was very interesting and I do not think I was
very fatigued, though I got rather pinched by one boot.
<P>
The morning must have been very clear, because I remember that
near Itchinstow Hall I looked back and saw the estuary of the
Thames, that river that has since played so large a part in my
life.  But at the time I did not know it was the Thames, I
thought this great expanse of mud flats and water was the sea,
which I had never yet seen nearly.  And out upon it stood ships,
sailing ships and a steamer or so, going up to London or down out
into the great seas of the world.  I stood for a long time
watching these and thinking whether after all I should not have
done better to have run away to sea.
<P>
The nearer I drew to Bladesover, the more doubtful I grew of the
duality of my reception, and the more I regretted that
alternative.  I suppose it was the dirty clumsiness of the
shipping I had seen nearly, that put me out of mind of that.  I
took a short cut through the Warren across the corner of the main
park to intercept the people from the church.  I wanted to avoid
meeting any one before I met my mother, and so I went to a place
where the path passed between banks, and without exactly hiding,
stood up among the bushes. This place among other advantages
eliminated any chance of seeing Lady Drew, who would drive round
by the carriage road.
<P>
Standing up to waylay in this fashion I had a queer feeling of
brigandage, as though I was some intrusive sort of bandit among
these orderly things.  It is the first time I remember having
that outlaw feeling distinctly,  a feeling that has played a
large part in my subsequent life.  I felt there existed no place
for me that I had to drive myself in.
<P>
Presently, down the hill, the servants appeared, straggling by
twos and threes, first some of the garden people and the butler's
wife with them, then the two laundry maids, odd inseparable old
creatures, then the first footman talking to the butler's little
girl, and at last, walking grave and breathless beside old Ann
and Miss Fison, the black figure of my mother.
<P>
My boyish mind suggested the adoption of a playful form of
appearance.  "Coo-ee, mother" said I, coming out against the
sky,"Coo-ee!"
<P>
My mother looked up, went very white, and put her hand to her
bosom.
<P>
I suppose there was a fearful fuss about me.  And of course I was
quite unable to explain my reappearance.  But I held out
stoutly, "I won't go back to Chatham; I'll drown myself first." 
The next day my mother carried me off to Wimblehurst, took me
fiercely and aggressively to an uncle I had never heard of
before, near though the place was to us.  She gave me no word
as to what was to happen, and I was too subdued by her manifest
wrath and humiliation at my last misdemeanour to demand
information.  I don't for one moment think Lady Drew was "nice"
about me.  The finality of my banishment was endorsed and
underlined and stamped home.  I wished very much now that I had
run away to sea, in spite of the coal dust and squalour Rochester
had revealed to me.  Perhaps over seas one came to different
lands.
<P>
<P>
IV
<P>
I do not remember much of my journey to Wimblehurst with my
mother except the image of her as sitting bolt upright, as rather
disdaining the third-class carriage in which we traveled, and
how she looked away from me out of the window when she spoke of
my uncle.  "I have not seen your uncle," she said, "since he was
a boy...."  She added grudgingly, "Then he was supposed to be
clever."
<P>
She took little interest in such qualities as cleverness.
<P>
"He married about three years ago, and set up for himself in
Wimblehurst....  So I suppose she had some money."
<P>
She mused on scenes she had long dismissed from her mind. 
"Teddy," she said at last in the tone of one who has been feeling
in the dark and finds.  "He was called Teddy...  about your
age.... Now he must be twenty-six or seven."
<P>
I thought of my uncle as Teddy directly I saw him; there was
something in his personal appearance that in the light of that
memory phrased itself at once as Teddiness--a certain Teddidity. 
To describe it in and other terms is more difficult.  It is
nimbleness without grace, and alertness without intelligence.  He
whisked out of his shop upon the pavement, a short figure in grey
and wearing grey carpet slippers; one had a sense of a young
fattish face behind gilt glasses, wiry hair that stuck up and
forward over the forehead, an irregular nose that had its
aquiline moments, and that the body betrayed an equatorial
laxity, an incipient "bow window" as the image goes.  He jerked
out of the shop, came to a stand on the pavement outside,
regarded something in the window with infinite appreciation, 
stroked his chin, and, as abruptly, shot sideways into the door
again, charging through it as it were behind an extended hand.
<P>
"That must be him," said my mother, catching at her breath.
<P>
We came past the window whose contents I was presently to know by
heart, a very ordinary chemist's window except that there was a
frictional electrical machine, an air pump and two or three
tripods and retorts replacing the customary blue, yellow, and red
bottles above.  There was a plaster of Paris horse to indicate
veterinary medicines among these breakables, and below were scent
packets and diffusers and sponges and soda-water syphons and
such-like things.  Only in the middle there was a rubricated
card, very neatly painted by hand, with these words--
<P>
                Buy Ponderevo's Cough Linctus NOW.
                           NOW!
                           WHY?
               Twopence Cheaper than in Winter.
            You Store apples! why not the Medicine    
                   You are Bound to Need?
<P>
in which appeal I was to recognise presently my uncle's
distinctive note.
<P>
My uncle's face appeared above a card of infant's comforters in
the glass pane of the door.  I perceived his eyes were brown, and
that his glasses creased his nose.  It was manifest he did not
know us from Adam.  A stare of scrutiny allowed an expression of
commercial deference to appear in front of it, and my uncle flung
open the door.
<P>
"You don't know me?" panted my mother.
<P>
My uncle would not own he did not, but his curiosity was
manifest.  My mother sat down on one of the little chairs before
the soap and patent medicine-piled counter,  and her lips opened
and closed.
<P>
"A glass of water, madam," said my uncle, waved his hand in a
sort of curve and shot away.
<P>
My mother drank the water and spoke.  "That boy," she said,
"takes after his father.  He grows more like him every day.... 
And so I have brought him to you."
<P>
"His father, madam?"
<P>
"George."
<P>
For a moment the chemist was still at a loss.  He stood behind
the counter with the glass my mother had returned to him in his
hand.  Then comprehension grew.
<P>
"By Gosh!" he said.  "Lord!" he cried.  His glasses fell off.  He
disappeared replacing them, behind a pile of boxed-up bottles of
blood mixture.  "Eleven thousand virgins!" I heard him cry.  The
glass was banged down.  "O-ri-ental Gums!"
<P>
He shot away out of the shop through some masked door.  One heard
his voice.  "Susan! Susan!"
<P>
Then he reappeared with an extended hand.  "Well, how are you?"
he said.  "I was never so surprised in my life.  Fancy!... You!"
<P>
He shook my mother's impassive hand and then mine very warmly
holding his glasses on with his left forefinger.
<P>
"Come right in!" he cried--"come right in!  Better late than
never!" and led the way into the parlour behind the shop.
<P>
After Bladesover that apartment struck me as stuffy and petty,
but it was very comfortable in comparison with the Frapp
living-room.  It had a faint, disintegrating smell of meals
about it, and my most immediate impression was of the remarkable
fact that something was hung about or wrapped round or draped
over everything.  There was bright-patterned muslin round the
gas-bracket in the middle of the room, round the mirror over the
mantel, stuff with ball-fringe along the mantel and casing in the
fireplace,--I first saw ball-fringe here--and even the lamp on
the little bureau wore a shade like a large muslin hat.  The
table-cloth had ball-fringe and so had the window curtains, and
the carpet was a bed of roses.  There were little cupboards on
either side of the fireplace, and in the recesses, ill-made
shelves packed with books, and enriched with pinked American
cloth.  There was a dictionary lying face downward on the table,
and the open bureau was littered with foolscap paper and the
evidences of recently abandoned toil.  My eye caught "The
Ponderevo Patent Flat, a Machine you can Live in," written in
large firm letters.  My uncle opened a little door like a
cupboard door in the corner of this room, and revealed the
narrowest twist of staircase I had ever set eyes upon.  "Susan!"
he bawled again.  "Wantje. Some one to see you.  Surprisin'."
<P>
There came an inaudible reply, and a sudden loud bump over our
heads as of some article of domestic utility pettishly flung
aside, then the cautious steps of someone descending the twist,
and then my aunt appeared in the doorway with her hand upon the
jamb.
<P>
"It's Aunt Ponderevo," cried my uncle.  "George's wife--and she's
brought over her son!"  His eye roamed about the room.  He darted
to the bureau with a sudden impulse, and turned the sheet about
the patent flat face down.  Then he waved his glasses at us, "You
know, Susan, my elder brother George.  I told you about 'im lots
of times."
<P>
He fretted across to the hearthrug and took up a position there,
replaced his glasses and coughed.
<P>
My aunt Susan seemed to be taking it in.  She was then rather a
pretty slender woman of twenty-three or four, I suppose, and I
remember being struck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear
freshness of her complexion.  She had little features, a button
nose, a pretty chin and a long graceful neck that stuck out of
her pale blue cotton morning dress.  There was a look of
half-assumed perplexity on her face, a little quizzical wrinkle
of the brow that suggested a faintly amused attempt to follow my
uncle's mental operations, a vain attempt and a certain
hopelessness that had in succession  become habitual.  She seemed
to be saying, "Oh Lord! What's he giving me THIS time?"  And as
came to know her better I detected, as a complication of her
effort of apprehension, a subsidiary riddle to "What's he giving
me?" and that was--to borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language
"Is it keeps?"  She looked at my mother and me, and back to her
husband again.
<P>
"You know," he said.  "George."
<P>
"Well," she said to my mother, descending the last three steps of
the staircase and holding out her hand! "you're welcome.  Though
it's a surprise.... I can't ask you to HAVE anything, I'm
afraid, for there isn't anything in the house."  She smiled, and
looked at her husband banteringly.  "Unless he makes up something
with his old chemicals, which he's quite equal to doing."
<P>
My mother shook hands stiffly, and told me to kiss my aunt....
<P>
"Well, let's all sit down," said my uncle, suddenly whistling
through his clenched teeth, and briskly rubbing  his hands
together.  He put up a chair for my mother, raised the blind of
the little window, lowered it again, and returned to his
hearthrug.  "I'm sure," he said, as one who decides, "I'm very
glad to see you."
<P>
V
<P>
As they talked I gave my attention pretty exclusively to my
uncle.
<P>
I noted him in great detail.  I remember now his partially
unbuttoned waistcoat, as though something had occurred to
distract him as he did it up, and a little cut upon his chin.  I
liked a certain humour in his eyes.  I watched, too, with the
fascination that things have for an observant boy, the play of
his lips--they were a little oblique, and there was something
"slipshod," if one may strain a word so far, about his mouth, so
that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the coming and
going of a curious expression, triumphant in quality it was, upon
his face as he talked. He fingered his glasses, which did not
seem to fit his nose, fretted with things in his waistcoat
pockets or put his hands behind him, looked over our heads, and
ever and again rose to his toes and dropped back on his heels. 
He had a way of drawing air in at times through his teeth that
gave a whispering zest to his speech It's a sound I can only
represent as a soft Zzzz.
<P>
He did most of the talking.  My mother repeated what she had
already said in the shop, "I have brought George over to you,"
and then desisted for a time from the real business in hand. 
"You find this a comfortable  house?" she asked; and this being
affirmed:  "It looks--very convenient.... Not too big to be a
trouble--no.  You like Wimblehurst, I suppose?"
<P>
My uncle retorted with some inquiries about the great people of
Bladesover, and my mother answered in the character of a personal
friend of Lady Drew's.  The talk hung for a time, and then my
uncle embarked upon a dissertation upon Wimblehurst.
<P>
"This place," he began, "isn't of course quite the place I ought
to be in."
<P>
My mother nodded as though she had expected that.
<P>
"It gives me no Scope," he went on.  "It's dead-and-alive.
Nothing happens."
<P>
"He's always wanting something to happen," said my aunt Susan. 
"Some day he'll get a shower of things and they'll be too much
for him."
<P>
"Not they," said my uncle, buoyantly.
<P>
"Do you find business--slack?" asked my mother.
<P>
"Oh! one rubs along.  But there's no Development--no growth. 
They just come along here and buy pills when they want 'em--and a
horseball or such.  They've got to be ill before there's a
prescription.  That sort they are.  You can't get 'em to launch
out, you can't get 'em to take up anything new.  For instance,
I've been trying lately--induce them to buy their medicines in
advance, and in larger quantities.  But they won't look for it!
Then I tried to float a little notion of mine, sort of an
insurance scheme for colds; you pay so much a week, and when
you've got a cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus so long as
you can produce a substantial sniff.  See?  But Lord! they've no
capacity for ideas, they don't catch on; no Jump about the place,
no Life.  Live!--they trickle, and what one has to do here is to
trickle too-- Zzzz."
<P>
"Ah!" said my mother.
<P>
"It doesn't suit me," said my uncle.  "I'm the cascading sort."
<P>
"George was that," said my mother after a pondering moment.
<P>
My aunt Susan took up the parable with an affectionate glance at
her husband.
<P>
"He's always trying to make his old business jump," she said. 
"Always putting fresh cards in the window, or getting up to
something.  You'd hardly believe.  It makes ME jump sometimes."
<P>
"But it does no good," said my uncle.
<P>
"It does no good," said his wife.  "It's not his miloo..."
<P>
Presently they came upon a wide pause.
<P>
From the beginning of their conversation there had been the
promise of this pause, and I pricked my ears.  I knew perfectly
what was bound to come; they were going to talk of my father.  I
was enormously strengthened in my persuasion when I found my
mother's eyes resting thoughtfully upon me in the silence, and
than my uncle looked at me and then my aunt.  I struggled
unavailingly to produce an expression of meek stupidity.
<P>
"I think," said my uncle, "that George will find it more amusing
to have a turn in the market-place than to sit here talking with
us.  There's a pair of stocks there, George--very interesting. 
Old-fashioned stocks."
<P>
"I don't mind sitting here," I said.
<P>
My uncle rose and in the most friendly way led me through the
shop.  He stood on his doorstep and jerked amiable directions to
me.
<P>
"Ain't it sleepy, George, eh?  There's the butcher's dog over
there, asleep in the road-half an hour from midday!  If the last
Trump sounded I don't believe it would wake.  Nobody would wake!
The chaps up there in the churchyard--they'd just turn over and
say:  'Naar--you don't catch us, you don't! See?'.... Well,
you'll find the stocks just round that corner."
<P>
He watched me out of sight.
<P>
So I never heard what they said about my father after all.
<P>
VI
<P>
When I returned, my uncle had in some remarkable way become
larger and central.  "Tha'chu, George?" he cried, when the
shop-door bell sounded.  "Come right through"; and I found him,
as it were, in the chairman's place before the draped grate.
<P>
The three of them regarded me.
<P>
"We have been talking of making you a chemist, George," said my
uncle.
<P>
My mother looked at me.  "I had hoped," she said, "that Lady Drew
would have done something for him--" She stopped.
<P>
"In what way?" said my uncle.
<P>
"She might have spoken to some one, got him into something
perhaps...."  She had the servant's invincible  persuasion that
all good things are done by patronage.
<P>
"He is not the sort of boy for whom things are done," she added,
dismissing these dreams.  "He doesn't accommodate himself.  When
he thinks Lady Drew wishes a thing, he seems not to wish it. 
Towards Mr. Redgrave, too, he has been--disrespectful--he is like
his father."
<P>
"Who's Mr. Redgrave?"
<P>
"The Vicar."
<P>
"A bit independent?" said my uncle, briskly.
<P>
"Disobedient," said my mother.  "He has no idea of his place.  He
seems to think he can get on by slighting people and flouting
them.  He'll learn perhaps before it is too late."
<P>
My uncle stroked his cut chin and me. "Have you learnt any
Latin?" he asked abruptly.
<P>
I said I had not.
<P>
"He'll have to learn a little Latin," he explained to my mother,
"to qualify.  H'm.  He could go down to the chap at the grammar
school here--it's just been routed into existence again by the
Charity Commissioners and have lessons."
<P>
"What, me learn Latin!" I cried, with emotion.
<P>
"A little," he said.
<P>
"I've always wanted" I said and; "LATIN!"
<P>
I had long been obsessed by the idea that having no Latin was a
disadvantage in the world, and Archie Garvell had driven the
point of this pretty earnestly home.  The literature I had read
at Bladesover had all tended that way.  Latin had had a quality
of emancipation for me that I find it difficult to convey.  And
suddenly, when I had supposed all learning was at an end for me,
I heard this!
<P>
"It's no good to you, of course," said my uncle, "except to pass
exams with, but there you are!"
<P>
"You'll have to learn Latin because you have to learn Latin,"
said my mother, "not because you want to.  And afterwards you
will have to learn all sorts of other things...."
<P>
The idea that I was to go on learning, that to read and master
the contents of books was still to be justifiable  as a duty,
overwhelmed all other facts.  I had had it rather clear in my
mind for some weeks that all that kind of opportunity might close
to me for ever.  I began to take a lively interest in this new
project.
<P>
"Then shall I live here?" I asked, "with you, and study... as
well as work in the shop?"
<P>
"That's the way of it," said my uncle.
<P>
I parted from my mother that day in a dream, so sudden and
important was this new aspect of things to me.  I was to learn
Latin!  Now that the humiliation of my failure at Bladesover was
past for her, now that she had a little got over her first
intense repugnance at this resort to my uncle and contrived
something that seemed like a possible provision for my future,
the tenderness natural to a parting far more significant than any
of our previous partings crept into her manner.
<P>
She sat in the train to return, I remember, and I stood at the
open door of her compartment, and neither of us knew how soon we
should cease for ever to be a trouble to one another.
<P>
"You must be a good boy, George," she said.  "You must learn.... 
And you mustn't set yourself up against those who are above you
and better than you.... Or envy them."
<P>
"No, mother," I said.
<P>
I promised carelessly.  Her eyes were fixed upon me. I was
wondering whether I could by any means begin Latin that night.
<P>
Something touched her heart then, some thought, some memory;
perhaps some premonition.... The solitary porter began slamming
carriage doors.
<P>
"George" she said hastily, almost shamefully, "kiss me!"
<P>
I stepped up into her compartment as she bent downward.  
<P>
She caught me in her arms quite eagerly, she pressed me to her--a
strange thing for her to do.  I perceived her eyes were
extraordinarily bright, and then this brightness burst along the
lower lids and rolled down her cheeks.
<P>
For the first and last time in my life I saw my mother's tears. 
Then she had gone, leaving me discomforted  and perplexed,
forgetting for a time even that I was to learn Latin, thinking of
my mother as of something new and strange.
<P>
The thing recurred though I sought to dismiss it, it stuck itself
into my memory against the day of fuller understanding.  Poor,
proud, habitual, sternly narrow soul! poor difficult and
misunderstanding son! it was the first time that ever it dawned
upon me that my mother also might perhaps feel.
<P>
VII
<P>
My mother died suddenly and, it was thought by Lady Drew,
inconsiderately, the following spring.  Her ladyship instantly
fled to Folkestone with Miss Somerville  and Fison, until the
funeral should be over and my mother's successor installed.
<P>
My uncle took me over to the funeral.  I remember there was a
sort of prolonged crisis in the days preceding  this because,
directly he heard of my loss, he had sent a pair of check
trousers to the Judkins people in London to be dyed black, and
they did not come back in time.  He became very excited on the
third day, and sent a number of increasingly fiery telegrams
without any result whatever, and succumbed next morning with a
very ill grace to my aunt Susan's insistence upon the resources
of his dress-suit.  In my memory those black legs of his, in a
particularly thin and shiny black cloth--for evidently his
dress-suit dated from adolescent and slenderer days--straddle
like the Colossus of Rhodes over my approach to my mother's
funeral.  Moreover, I was inconvenienced and distracted by a silk
hat he had bought me, my first silk hat, much ennobled, as his
was also, by a deep mourning band.
<P>
I remember, but rather indistinctly, my mother's white paneled
housekeeper's room and the touch of oddness about it that she was
not there, and the various familiar faces made strange by black,
and I seem to recall the exaggerated self-consciousness that
arose out of their focussed attention.  No doubt the sense of the
new silk hat came and went and came again in my emotional chaos. 
Then something comes out clear and sorrowful, rises out clear and
sheer from among all these rather base and inconsequent things,
and once again I walk before all the other mourners close behind
her coffin as it is carried along the churchyard path to her
grave, with the old vicar's slow voice saying regretfully and
unconvincingly above me, triumphant solemn things.
<P>
"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord; he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
<P>
Never die!  The day was a high and glorious morning in spring,
and all the trees were budding and bursting into green. 
Everywhere there were blossoms and flowers; the pear trees and
cherry trees in the sexton's garden were sunlit snow, there were
nodding daffodils and early tulips in the graveyard beds, great
multitudes of daisies, and everywhere the birds seemed singing.
And in the middle was the brown coffin end, tilting on men's
shoulders and half occluded by the vicar's Oxford hood.
<P>
And so we came to my mother's waiting grave.
<P>
For a time I was very observant, watching the coffin lowered,
hearing the words of the ritual.  It seemed a very curious
business altogether.
<P>
Suddenly as the service drew to its end, I felt something had
still to be said which had not been said, realised that she had
withdrawn in silence, neither forgiving  me nor hearing from
me--those now lost assurances.   Suddenly I knew I had not
understood.  Suddenly  I saw her tenderly; remembered not so much
tender or kindly things of her as her crossed wishes and the ways
in which I had thwarted her.  Surprisingly  I realised that
behind all her hardness and severity she had loved me, that I was
the only thing she had ever loved and that until this moment I
had never loved her.  And now she was there and deaf and blind to
me, pitifully defeated in her designs for me, covered from me so
that she could not know....
<P>
I dug my nails into the palms of my hands, I set my teeth, but
tears blinded me, sobs would have choked me had speech been
required of me.  The old vicar read on, there came a mumbled
response--and so on to the end.  I wept as it were internally,
and only when we had come out of the churchyard could I think and
speak calmly again.
<P>
Stamped across this memory are the little black figures of my
uncle and Rabbits, telling Avebury, the sexton and undertaker,
that "it had all passed off very well--very well indeed."
<P>
VIII
<P>
That is the last I shall tell of Bladesover.  The dropscene 
falls on that, and it comes no more as an actual presence into
this novel.  I did indeed go back there once again, but under
circumstances quite immaterial to my story.  But in a sense
Bladesover has never left me; it is, as I said at the outset, one
of those dominant explanatory impressions that make the framework
of my mind.  Bladesover illuminates England; it has become all
that is spacious, dignified pretentious, and truly conservative
in English life.  It is my social datum.  That is why I have
drawn it here on so large a scale.
<P>
When I came back at last to the real Bladesover on an
inconsequent visit, everything was far smaller than I could have
supposed possible.  It was as though everything had shivered and
shrivelled a little at the Lichtenstein touch.  The harp was
still in the saloon, but there was a different grand piano with a
painted lid and a metrostyle pianola, and an extraordinary
quantity of artistic litter and bric-a-brac scattered about. 
There was the trail of the Bond Street showroom over it all.  The
furniture was still under chintz, but it wasn't the same sort of
chintz although it pretended to be, and the lustre-dangling
chandeliers had passed away.  Lady Lichtenstein's books replaced
the brown volumes I had browsed among--they were mostly
presentation copies of contemporary novels and the National
Review and the Empire Review, and the Nineteenth Century and
after jostled current books on the tables--English new books in
gaudy catchpenny "artistic" covers, French and Italian novels in
yellow, German art handbooks of almost incredible ugliness. 
There were abundant evidences that her ladyship was playing with
the Keltic renascence, and a great number of ugly cats made of
china--she "collected" china and stoneware cats--stood about
everywhere--in all colours, in all kinds of deliberately comic,
highly glazed distortion.
<P>
It is nonsense to pretend that finance makes any better
aristocrats than rent.  Nothing can make an aristocrat but pride,
knowledge, training, and the sword.  These people were no
improvement on the Drews, none whatever.  There was no effect of
a beneficial replacement of passive unintelligent people by
active intelligent ones.  One felt that a smaller but more
enterprising and intensely undignified variety of stupidity had
replaced the large dullness of the old gentry, and that was all. 
Bladesover, I thought, had undergone just the same change between
the seventies and the new century that had overtaken the dear old
Times, and heaven knows how much more of the decorous British
fabric.  These Lichtensteins and their like seem to have no
promise in them at all of any fresh vitality for the kingdom.  I
do not believe in their intelligence or their power--they have
nothing new about them at all, nothing creative nor
rejuvenescent, no more than a disorderly instinct of acquisition;
and the prevalence of them and their kind is but a phase in the
broad slow decay of the great social organism of England.  They
could not have made Bladesover they cannot replace it; they just
happen to break out over it--saprophytically.
<P>
Well--that was my last impression of Bladesover.
