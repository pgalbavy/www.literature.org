As a rule the jetty on its poles straddling a little way into the sea
was as deserted as if it were some relic left by an old invader. Then it
had spurts of activity, when steamer after steamer came blorting and
hanging miserably round, like cows to the cowshed on a winter afternoon.
Then a little engine would chuff along the pier, shoving a string of
tip-up trucks, and little men would saunter across the sky-line, and
there would be a fine dimness of black dust round the low, red ship and
the end of the jetty. Luckily it was far enough away, so that Harriet
need not fear for her beautiful white washing. She washed her linen
herself for the sheer joy of it, and loved nothing so much as thinking
of it getting whiter and whiter, like the Spenserian maid, in the sun
and sea, and visiting it on the grass every five minutes, and finding it
every time really whiter, till Somers said it would reach a point of
whiteness where the colours would break up, and she'd go out and find
pieces of rainbow on the grass and bushes, instead of towels and shirts.</p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn't I be startled!&quot; she said, accepting it as quite a possible
contingency, and adding thoughtfully: &quot;No, not really.&quot;</p>

<p>One of these afternoons when Somers was walking down on the sands,
looking at the different shells, their sea-colours of pink and brown and
rainbow and brilliant violet and shrimp-red, and when the boats were
loading coal on the moderately quiet sea, he noticed the little engine
standing steaming on the jetty, just overhead where he was going to pass
under. Then his attention was drawn away to the men picking up the
rounded, sea-smooth pebbles of coal in one little place where the beach
was just a black slope of perfectly clean coal-pebbles: just like any
other pebbles. There were usually some men, or women or children,
picking here, putting the bigger pebbles of sea-coal into sacks. From
the edge of the small waves Somers heard one man talking to another, and
the English tones - unconsciously he expected a foreign language - and
particularly the peculiar educated-artisan quality, almost a kind of
uppishness that there is in the speech of Australian working men, struck
him as incongruous with their picking up the coal-cobs from the shore.
He watched them, in the chill of the shadow. Yes, they thought as much
of themselves as anybody. But one was palpably a Welshman, and loved
picking up something for nothing; and the other mixed his democratic
uppishness with a queer lousy quality, like a bushranger. &quot;They are ten
times more foreign to me,&quot; said Somers, &quot;than Italian scoundrels, or
even Indians. They are so FOREIGN to me. And yet their manner of life,
their ordinary way of living is almost exactly what I was used to as a
boy. Why are they so foreign to me?&quot;</p>

<p>They silently objected to his looking, so he went on. He had come to the
huge, high timbers of the tall jetty. There stood the little engine
still overhead: and in the gloom among the timbers underneath water was
dripping down from her, which gave Somers a distaste for passing just
then. He looked up. There was the engine-driver in his dirty shirt and
dirty bare arms, talking to another man. The other man saluted - and to
Somers' surprise it was William James. He stood quite still, and a
surprised smile of recognition greeted the other man, who saluted.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what are you doing here?&quot; called Somers.</p>

<p>William James came to the edge of the jetty, but could not hear, because
of the noise of the sea. His face had that small, subtle smile that was
characteristic of him, and which Somers was never quite sure of, whether
it was really jeering or in a cunning way friendly.</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you come up a minute?&quot; roared William James.</p>

<p>So Somers scrambled round up the banks, on to the railway track.</p>

<p>&quot;I couldn't come down for the moment,&quot; said William James. &quot;I'll have to
see the manager, then I'm off on this boat. We're ready to go. You heard
her blowing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you going? Back to Sydney.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I come down occasionally on this coal-business, and if I like I go
back on the collier. The sea is quiet, and I needn't wait for a train.
Well, an' how're you gettin' on, like? Pleased with it down here all by
yourselves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A bit lonely for you. I suppose you wouldn't like to know the manager
here - Mr. Thomas? He's a decent chap - from South Wales originally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I like it best when I don't know anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a compliment for some of us. However - I know what you mean. I
know what you mean. Jack tells me you saw Kangaroo. Made quite a fuss of
you, I hear. I knew he would. Oh, Kangaroo knew all about you: all he
wanted to know, anyhow. I say, if ye think of stoppin' down here, you
might get in a ton of coal. It looks as if this strike might come off.
That Arbitration Board's a fine failure, what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As far as I can gather.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, bound to be. Bound to be. They talk about scraps of paper, why,
every agreement that's ever come to in this country, you could wrap your
next red herring in it, for all it's worth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it's like Ireland, they don't want to agree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's about it. The Labour people want this revolution of theirs.
What?&quot; - and he looked at Somers with a long, smiling, sardonic leer,
like a wink. &quot;There's a certain fact,&quot; he continued, &quot;as far as any
electioneering success goes, they're out of the running for a spell.
What do you think of Trades Unions, one way and another?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dislike them on the whole rather intensely. They're just the nastiest
profiteering side of the working man - they make a fool of him too, in my
opinion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just my opinion. They make a fool of him. Wouldn't it be nice to have
them for bosses of the whole country? They very nearly are. But I doubt
very much if they'll ever cover the last lap - what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not if Kangaroo can help it,&quot; said Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; William James flashed a quick look at him from his queer grey
eyes. &quot;What did you make of him then? Could you make him out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not quite. I never met anyone like him. The wonder to me is, he seems
to have as much spare time for entertaining and amusing his guests, as
if he had no work at all on hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that was just a special occasion. But he's a funny sort of Saviour,
isn't he? Not much crown of thorns about him. Why, he'd look funny on a
cross, what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's no intention of being on one, I think,&quot; said Somers stiffly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't know. If the wrong party got hold of him. There's many
mites in a pound of cheese, they say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'll toast my cheese.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha-ha! Oh yes, I like a bit of toasted cheese myself - or a Welsh
rabbit, as well as any man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't think they'd ever let him down, do you? - these
Australians?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No-o,&quot; said William James. &quot;I doubt if they'd ever let him down. But if
he happened to FALL down, you know, they'd soon forget him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't sound a very warm follower yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, warm isn't my way, in anything. I like to see what I'm about. I can
see that Kangaroo's a wonder. Oh yes, he's a world wonder. And I'd
rather be in with him than anybody, if it was only for the sake of the
spree, you know. Bound to be a spree some time - and before long, I
should say, things going as they are. I wouldn't like to be left out of
the fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't feel any strong devotion to your leader?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, no; I won't say it's exactly strong devotion. But I think he's a
world wonder. He's not quite the SHAPE of a man that I should throw away
my eyes for, that's all I mean.&quot; Again William James looked at Somers
with that long, perhaps mocking little smile in his grey eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought even his shape beautiful, when he talked to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, it's wonderful what a spell he can cast over you. But I'm a
stuggy fellow myself, maybe that's how it is I can't ever quite see him
in the same light as the thin chaps do. But that's just the looks of the
thing. I can see there isn't another man in the world like him, and I'd
cross the seas to join in with him, if only for the fun of the thing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what about the end of the fun?&quot; asked Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that I don't know. And nobody does, for that matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But surely if one believes - .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One believes a lot, and one believes very little, seems to me. Taking
all in all, seems to me we live from hand to mouth, as far as beliefs
go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You never WOULD believe,&quot; said Somers, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Not till I was made to,&quot; replied Jaz, twisting his face in his
enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>Somers looked at the thick, stocky, silent figure in the well-made dark
clothes that didn't in the least belong to him. There was something
about him like a prisoner in prison uniform, in his town clothes - and
something of that in his bearing. A stocky, silent, unconquerable
prisoner. And in his imprisoned soul another kind of mystery, another
sort of appeal.</p>

<p>The two men stood still in the cold wind that came up the sands to the
south-west. To the left, as they faced the wind, went the black railway
track on the pier, and the small engine stood dribbling. On the right
the track ran curiously black past a little farm-place with a corrugated
iron roof, and past a big field where the stubble of maize or beans
stood ragged and sere, on into the little hollow of bush, where the mine
was, beyond the stagnant creek. It was curious how intensely black,
velvety and unnatural, the railway-track looked on this numb
coast-front. The steamer hooted again.</p>

<p>&quot;Cold it is up here,&quot; said Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;It is cold. He's coming now, though,&quot; replied William James.</p>

<p>They stood together still another minute, looking down the pale sands at
the foam and the dark-blue sea, the sere grass scattered with bungalows.</p>

<p>It was a strange, different bond of sympathy united them, from that that
subsisted between Somers and Jack, or Somers and Kangaroo. Hardly
sympathy at all, but an ancient sort of root-knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, good-bye,&quot; said Somers, wanting to be gone before the manager
came up with the papers. He shook hands with William James - but as
usual, Jaz gave him a slack hand. Their eyes met - and the look,
something like a taunt, in Trewhella's secretive grey eye, made Somers
stiffen his back, and a kind of haughtiness flew into his soul.</p>

<p>&quot;Different men, different ways, Mr. Trewhella,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>William James did not answer, but smiled rather stubbornly. It seemed to
Somers the man would be smiling that stubborn, taunting smile till the
crack of doom.</p>

<p>&quot;I told Mrs. Somers what I think about it,&quot; said Jaz, with a very
Cornish accent. &quot;I doubt if she'll ever do much more believin' than I
shall.&quot; And the taunt was forked this time.</p>

<p>&quot;She says she believes entirely in Kangaroo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does she now? Who did she tell it to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me.&quot;</p>

<p>Trewhella still stood with that faint grin on his face, short and stocky
and erect like a little post left standing. Somers looked at him again,
frowning, and turned abruptly down the bank. The smile left the face of
the Cornishman, and he just looked obstinate, indifferent, and curiously
alone, as if he stood there all alone in the world. He watched Somers
emerge on the sands below, and go walking slowly among the sea-ragged
flat shelves of the coast-bed rocks, his head dropping, looking in the
pools, his hands in his pockets. And the obstinate light never changed
in the eyes of the watcher, not even when he turned to the approaching
manager.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this meeting which made Somers want to see Kangaroo once
more. Everything had suddenly become unreal to him. He went to Sydney
and to Cooley's rooms. But during the first half hour, the revulsion
from the First persisted. Somers disliked his appearance, and the
kangaroo look made him feel devilish. And then the queer, slow manner of
approach. Kangaroo was not really ready for his visitor, and he seemed
dense, heavy, absent, clownish. It was that kangarooish clownishness
that made a vicious kind of hate spring into Somers' face. He talked in
a hard, cutting voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Whom can you depend on, in this world?&quot; he was saying. &quot;Look at these
Australians - they're awfully nice, but they've got no inside to them.
They're hollow. How are you going to build on such hollow stalks? They
may well call them corn-stalks. They're marvellous and manly and
independent and all that, outside. But inside, they are not. When
they're QUITE alone, they don't exist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet many of them have been alone a long time, in the bush,&quot; said
Kangaroo, watching his visitor with slow, dumb, unchanging eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Alone, what sort of alone? Physically alone. And they've just gone
hollow. They're never alone in spirit: quite, quite alone in spirit. And
the people who are are the only people you can depend on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where shall I find them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not here. It seems to me, least of all here. The Colonies make for
OUTWARDNESS. Everything is outward - like hollow stalks of corn. The life
makes this inevitable: all that struggle with bush and water and
what-not, all the mad struggle with the material necessities and
conveniences - the inside soul just withers and goes into the outside,
and they're all just lusty robust stalks of people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The corn-stalks bear the corn. I find them generous to
recklessness - the greatest quality. The old world is cautious and
forever bargaining about its soul. Here they don't bother to bargain.&quot;</p>

<p>They've no soul to bargain about. But they're even more full of conceit.
What do you expect to do with such people. Build a straw castle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see I believe in them - perhaps I know them a little better than you
do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps you do. It'll be cornstalk castle, for all that. What DO you
expect to build on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're generous - generous to recklessness,&quot; shouted Kangaroo. &quot;And I
love them. I love them. Don't you come here carping to me about them.
They are my children, I love them. If I'm not to believe in their
generosity, am I to believe in your cautious, old-world carping, do you
think, I WON'T!&quot; he shouted fiercely. &quot;I WON'T. Do you hear that!&quot; And
he sat hulked in his chair glowering like some queer dark god at bay.
Somers paused, and his heart failed.</p>

<p>&quot;Then make me believe in them and their generosity,&quot; he said dryly.
&quot;They're nice. But they haven't got the last everlasting central bit of
soul, solitary soul, that makes a man himself. The central bit of
himself. They all merge to the outside, away from the centre. And what
can you do, PERMANENTLY, with such people? You can have a fine
corn-stalk blaze. But as for anything permanent - .</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you I HATE permanency,&quot; barked Kangaroo. &quot;The phoenix rises out
of the ashes.&quot; He rolled over angrily in his chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Let her! Like Rider Haggard's 'She', I don't feel like risking it a
second time,&quot; said Somers, like the venomous serpent he was.</p>

<p>&quot;Generous, generous men!&quot; Kangaroo muttered to himself. &quot;At least you
can get a blaze out of them. Not like European wet matches, that will
never again strike alight - as you've said yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But a blaze for what? What's your blaze for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care,&quot; yelled Kangaroo, springing with sudden magnificent
swiftness to his feet, and facing Somers, and seizing him by the
shoulders and shaking him till his head nearly fell off, yelling all the
time: &quot;I don't care, I tell you, I don't care. Where there's fire
there's change. And where the fire is love, there's creation. Seeds of
fire. That's enough for me! Fire, and seeds of fire, and love. That's
all I care about. Don't carp at me, I tell you. Don't carp at me with
your old, European, damp spirit. If you can't take fire, WE CAN. That's
all. Generous, passionate men - and you dare to carp at them. You. What
have you to show?&quot; And he went back to his chair like a great, sulky
bear-god.</p>

<p>Somers sat rather stupefied than convinced. But he found himself again
WANTING to be convinced, wanting to be carried away. The desire hankered
in his heart. Kangaroo had become again beautiful: huge and beautiful
like some god that sways and seems clumsy, then suddenly flashes with
all the agility of thunder and lightning. Huge and beautiful as he sat
hulked in his chair. Somers DID wish he would get up again, and carry
him quite away.</p>

<p>But where to? Where to? Where is one carried to when one is carried
away? He had a bitter mistrust of seventh heavens and all heavens in
general. But then the experience. If Kangaroo had got up at that moment
Somers would have given him heart and soul and body, for the asking, and
damn all consequences. He longed to do it. He knew that by just going
over and laying a hand on the great figure of the sullen god he could
achieve it. Kangaroo would leap like a thunder-cloud and catch him
up - catch him up and away into a transport. A transport that should last
for life. He knew it.</p>

<p>But alas, it was just too late. In some strange way Somers felt he had
come to the end of transports: they had no more mystery for him; at
least this kind: or perhaps no more charm. Some bubble or other had
burst in his heart. All his body and fibres wanted to go over and touch
the other great being into a storm of response. But his soul wouldn't.
The coloured bubble had burst.</p>

<p>Kangaroo sat up and adjusted his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you run away with the idea, though,&quot; he said, &quot;that I am just an
emotional fool.&quot; His voice was almost menacing, and with a strange cold,
intellectual quality that Somers had never heard before.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe in the one fire of love. I believe it is the one inspiration
of all creative activity. I trust myself entirely to the fire of love.
This I do with my reason also. I don't discard my reason. I use it at
the service of love, like a sharp weapon. I try to keep it very
sharp - and very dangerous. Where I don't love, I use only my will and my
wits. Where I love, I trust to love alone.&quot; The voice came cold and
static.</p>

<p>Somers sat rather blank. The change frightened him almost as something
obscene. This was the reverse to the passionate thunder-god.</p>

<p>&quot;But is love the only inspiration of creative activity?&quot; he asked,
rather feebly.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the first time I have heard it questioned. Do you know of any
other?&quot;</p>

<p>Somers thought he did, but he was not going to give himself away to that
sharp weapon of a voice, so he did not answer.</p>

<p>&quot;IS there any other inspirational force than the force of love?&quot;
continued Kangaroo. &quot;There is no other. Love makes the trees flower and
shed their seed, love makes the animals mate and birds put on their best
feather, and sing their best songs. And all that man has ever created on
the face of the earth, or ever will create - if you will allow me the use
of the word create, with regard to man's highest productive activities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's the word I always use myself,&quot; said Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally, since you know how to think inspiredly. Well then, all that
man ever has created or ever will create, while he remains man, has been
created in the inspiration and by the force of love. And not only
man - all the living creatures are swayed to creation, to new creation,
to the creation of song and beauty and lovely gesture, by love. I will
go further. I believe the sun's attraction for the earth is a form of
love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why doesn't the earth fly into the sun?&quot; said Somers.</p>

<p>&quot;For the same reason. Love is mutual. Each attracts the other. But in
natural love each tries at the same time to withhold the other, to keep
the other true to its own beloved nature. To any true lover, it would be
the greatest disaster if the beloved broke down from her own nature and
self and began to identify herself with him, with his nature and self. I
say, to any genuine lover this is the greatest disaster, and he tries by
every means in his power to prevent this. The earth and sun, on their
plane, have discovered a perfect equilibrium. But man has not yet begun.
His lesson is so much harder. His consciousness is at once so
complicated and so cruelly limited. This is the lesson before us. Man
has loved the beloved for the sake of love, so far, but rarely, rarely
has he CONSCIOUSLY known that he could only love her for her own
separate, strange self: forever strange and a joyful mystery to him.
Lovers henceforth have got to KNOW one another. A terrible mistake, and
a self-delusion. True lovers only learn that as they know less, and
less, and less of each other, the mystery of each grows more startling
to the other. The tangible unknown: that is the magic, the mystery, and
the grandeur of love, that it puts the tangible unknown in our arms, and
against our breast: the beloved. We have made a fatal mistake. We have
got to know so much ABOUT things, that we think we know the actuality,
and contain it. The sun is as much outside us, and as eternally unknown,
as ever it was. And the same with each man's beloved: like the sun. What
do the facts we know ABOUT a man amount to? Only two things we can know
of him, and this by pure soul-intuition: we can know if he is true to
the flame of life and love which is inside his heart, or if he is false
to it. If he is true, he is friend. If he is wilfully false, and
inimical to the fire of life and love in his own heart, then he is my
enemy as well as his own.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers listened. He seemed to see it all and hear it all with marvellous
clarity. And he believed that it was all true.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I believe that is all true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it then that you disbelieve?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't quite believe that love is the one and only exclusive force or
mystery of living inspiration. I don't quite believe that. There is
something else.&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo looked at him for once overbearingly and with a sort of
contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me what it is,&quot; he replied briefly.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not very clear myself. And, you see, what I want to say, you don't
want to hear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; snapped Kangaroo.</p>

<p>&quot;With your ears and your critical mind only.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say it anyhow, say it.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard sat feeling very stupid. The communicative soul is like the ass,
you can lead him to the water, but you can't make him drink.</p>

<p>&quot;Why,&quot; he said, &quot;it means an end of us and what we are, in the first
place. And then a re-entry into us of the great God, who enters us from
below, not from above.&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo sat bunched up like some creature watching round-eyed out of a
darker corner.</p>

<p>&quot;How do you mean, enters us from below?&quot; he barked.</p>

<p>&quot;Not through the spirit. Enters us from the lower self, the dark self,
the phallic self, if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enters us from the phallic self?&quot; snapped Kangaroo sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;Sacredly. The god you can never see or visualise, who stands dark on
the threshold of the phallic me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The phallic you, my dear young friend, what is that but love?&quot;</p>

<p>Richard shook his head in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, in a slow, remote voice. &quot;I know your love, Kangaroo.
Working everything from the spirit, from the head. You work the lower
self as an instrument of the spirit. Now it is time for the spirit to
leave us again; it is time for the Son of Man to depart, and leave us
dark, in front of the unspoken God: who is just beyond the dark
threshold of the lower self, my lower self. There is a great God on the
threshold of my lower self, whom I fear while he is my glory. And the
spirit goes out like a spent candle.&quot;</p>

<p>Kangaroo watched with a heavy face like a mask.</p>

<p>&quot;It is time for the spirit to leave us,&quot; he murmured in a somnambulist
voice. &quot;Time for the spirit to leave us.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers, who had dropped his face, hiding it as he spoke, watched the
other man from under his brows. Kangaroo, who still sat impassive, like
a frozen, antagonised Buddha, gave himself a jerk of recovery.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well!&quot; he sighed, with a weary, impatient, condescending sigh. &quot;I
was never able to follow mysticism and metaphysics. One of my many
limitations. I don't know what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what is your 'love' but a mystical thing?&quot; asked Richard
indignantly.</p>

<p>&quot;My love? Why, that is something I FEEL, as plain as toothache.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, so do I feel the other: and love has become like cardboard to
me,&quot; said Richard, still indignant.</p>

<p>&quot;Like cardboard? Well, I don't quite see love like cardboard, dear boy.
For you ARE a dear boy, in spite of yourself. Oh yes, you are. There's
some demon inside you makes you perverse, and won't let you be the dear,
beautiful thing you are. But I'm going to exorcise that demon.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers gave a short laugh, the very voice of the demon speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes I am,&quot; said Kangaroo, in a steely voice. &quot;I'm going to exorcise
that demon, and release your beautiful Andromeda soul.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try,&quot; ejaculated Richard dryly, turning aside his face in distaste.</p>

<p>Kangaroo leapt to his feet and stood towering over the little enemy as
if he would stoop over him and smother him in violent warmth and drive
out the demon in that way. But Richard sat cold and withheld, and
Kangaroo had not the power to touch him.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to try,&quot; shouted the lawyer, in his slightly husky roar.
&quot;You've made it my prerogative by telling me to try. I'm going to love
you, and you won't get away from that. I'm the hound of heaven after
you, my boy, and I'm fatal to the hell hound that's leading you. Do you
know I love you? - that I loved you long before I met you?&quot;</p>

<p>Richard, curled narrow in his chair like a snake, glanced up at the big
man projecting over him. A sort of magnetic effusion seemed to come out
of Kangaroo's body, and Richard's hand was almost drawn in spite of
himself to touch the other man's body. He had deliberately to refrain
from laying his hand on the near, generous stomach of the Kangaroo,
because automatically his hand would have lifted and sought that rest.
But he prevented himself, and the eyes of the two men met. Kangaroo
searched Lovat's eyes: but they seemed to be of cloudy blue like
hell-smoke, impenetrable and devilish. Kangaroo watched a long time: but
the other man was the unchangeable. Kangaroo turned aside suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well,&quot; he said. &quot;I can see there is a beast in the way. There is a
beast in your eyes, Lovat, and if I can't conquer him then - then, woe
betide you, my dear. But I love you, you see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like a threat,&quot; laughed Somers.</p>

<p>Kangaroo leaned and laid his hand gently on Lovat's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say that,&quot; his voice was small now, and very gentle. &quot;I loved you
before I knew you. My soul cries for you. And you hurt me with the demon
that is in you.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard became very pale, and was silent for some moments. The hand sank
heavier, nearer, on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; said Somers, trying hard to be fair, &quot;what you call my demon
is what I identify myself with. It's my best me, and I stick to it. I
think love, all this love of ours, is a devilish thing now: a slow
poison. Really, I know the dark god at the lower threshold - even if I
have to repeat it like a phrase. And in the sacred dark men meet and
touch, and it is a great communion. But it isn't this love. There's no
love in it. But something deeper. Love seems to me somehow trivial: and
the spirit seems like something that belongs to paper. I can't help
it - I know another God.&quot;</p>

<p>The pressure of the hand became inert.</p>

<p>&quot;But aren't you merely inventing other terms for the same thing that I
mean, and that I call love?&quot; said Kangaroo, in a strange, toneless
voice, looking aside.</p>

<p>&quot;Does it seem to you that I am?&quot; asked Lovat, gently and
dispassionately.</p>

<p>The strange, great passionate cloud of Kangaroo still hung there,
hovering over the pale, sharp isolation of Somers, who lay looking up.
And then it seemed as if the glow and vibration left Kangaroo's body,
the cloud became grey and heavy. He sighed, and removed his hand, and
turned away.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well?&quot; he said. &quot;Ah well!&quot;</p>

<p>Somers rose, trembling now, and feeling frail.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, do go,&quot; said Kangaroo.</p>

<p>And without another word Somers went, leaving the other man sunk in a
great heap in his chair, as if defeated. Somers did not even pity him.
His heart felt queer and cave-like and devoid of emotion.</p>

<p>He was spending the night at the Callcotts. Harriet, too, was there. But
he was in no hurry to get back there. It was a clear and very starry
night. He took the tram-car away from the centre of the town, then
walked. As was always the case with him, in this country, the land and
the world disappeared as night fell, as if the day had been an illusion,
and the sky came bending down. There was the Milky Way, in clouds of
star-fume, bending down right in front of him, right down till it seemed
as if he would walk on to it, if he kept going. The pale, fumy drift of
the Milky Way drooped down and seemed so near, straight in front, that
it seemed the obvious road to take. And one would avoid the strange dark
gaps, gulfs, in the way overhead. And one would look across to the
floating isles of star-fume, to the south, across the gulfs where the
sharp stars flashed like lighthouses, and one would be in a new way
denizen of a new plane, walking by oneself. There would be a real new
way to take. And the mechanical earth quite obliterated, sunk out.</p>

<p>Only he saw, on the sea's high black horizon, the various reddish
sore-looking lights of a ship. There they were - the signs of the ways of
men - hot-looking and weary. He turned quickly away from the marks of the
far-off ship, to look again at the downward slope of the great hill of
the Milky Way. He wanted so much to get out of this lit-up cloy of
humanity, and the exhaust of love, and the fretfulness of desire. Why
not swing away into cold separation? Why should desire always be
fretting, fretting like a tugged chain? Why not break the bond and be
single, take a fierce stoop and a swing back, as when a gannet plunges
like a white, metallic arrow into the sea, raising a burst of spray,
disappearing, completing the downward curve of the parabola in the
invisible underwater where it seizes the object of desire, then away,
away with success upwards, back flashing into the air and white space?
Why not? Why want to urge, urge, urge oneself down the causeways of
desirous love, hard pavements of love? Even like Kangaroo. Why shouldn't
meeting be a stoop as a gannet stoops into the sea, or a hawk, or a
kite, in a swift rapacious parabola downwards, to touch at the lowermost
turn of the curve, then up again?</p>

<p>It is a world of slaves: all love-professing. Why unite with them? Why
pander to them? Why go with them at all? Why not strike at communion out
of the unseen, as the gannet strikes into the unseen underwater, or the
kite from above at a mouse? One seizure, and away again, back away into
isolation. A touch, and away. Always back, away into isolation. Why be
cloyed and clogged down like billions of fish in water, or billions of
mice on land? It is a world of slaves. Then why not gannets in the upper
air, having two worlds? Why only one element? If I am to have a meeting
it shall be down, down in the invisible, and the moment I re-emerge it
shall be alone. In the visible world I am alone, an isolate instance. My
meeting is in the underworld, the dark. Beneath every gannet that jumps
from the water ten thousand fish are swimming still. But they are
swimming in a shudder of silver fear. That is the magic of the ocean.
Let them shudder the huge ocean aglimmer.</p>

<p>He arrived at Wyewurk at last, and found a little party. William James
was there, and Victoria had made, by coincidence, a Welsh rarebit. The
beer was on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Just in time,&quot; said Jack. &quot;As well you're not half an hour later, or
there might a' been no booze. How did you come - tram?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes - and walked part of the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of an evening did you have?&quot; said Harriet.</p>

<p>He looked at her. A chill fell upon the little gathering, from his
presence.</p>

<p>&quot;We didn't agree,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you wouldn't - not for long, anyhow,&quot; she replied. &quot;I don't see
you agreeing and playing second fiddle for long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see me as a fiddler at all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've seen you fiddling away hard enough many times,&quot; retorted Harriet.
&quot;Why, what else do you do, all your life, but fiddle some tune or
other?&quot;</p>

<p>He did not reply, and there was a pause. His face was pale and very
definite, as if it were some curious seashell.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you get the wind up about, between you?&quot; said Jack soothingly,
pouring Somers a glass of beer.</p>

<p>&quot;No wind. We're only not the same pair of shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could have told you that before you went,&quot; said Jaz with quiet
elation in his tones.</p>

<p>Victoria looked at Somers with dark, bright eyes. She was quite
fascinated by him, as an Australian bird by some adder.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't Mr. Somers queer?&quot; she said. &quot;He doesn't seem to mind a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers looked at her quickly, a smile round his eyes, and a curious,
smiling devil inside them, cold as ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, he minds. Don't take any notice of his pretence. He's only in a
bad temper,&quot; cried Harriet. &quot;I know him by now. He's been in a temper
for days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh why?&quot; cried Victoria. &quot;I thought he was lovely this afternoon when
he was here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Harriet grimly. &quot;Lovely! You should live with him.&quot;</p>

<p>But again Victoria looked at his clear, fixed face, with the false smile
round the eyes, and her fascination did not diminish.</p>

<p>&quot;What an excellent Welsh rarebit,&quot; he said. &quot;If there were a little red
pepper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Red pepper?&quot; cried Victoria. &quot;There is!&quot; And she sprang up to get it
for him. As she handed it to him he looked into her dilated, dark bright
eyes, and thanked her courteously. When he was in this state his voice
and tone in speaking were very melodious. Of course it set Harriet on
edge. But Victoria stood fluttering with her hands over the table,
bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you feeling for?&quot; asked Jack.</p>

<p>She only gave a little blind laugh, and remembered that she was going to
sit down. So she sat down, and then wondered what it was she was going
to do after that.</p>

<p>&quot;So you don't cotton on to Kangaroo either?&quot; said Jack easily.</p>

<p>&quot;I have the greatest admiration for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not alone there. But you don't fall over yourself, loving him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I only trip, and recover my balance for the moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Jaz gave a loud laugh, across his cheese.</p>

<p>&quot;That's good!&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;You trip, and recover your balance,&quot; said Jack. &quot;You're a wary one. The
rest of us falls right in, flop, and are never heard of again. And how
did you part then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We parted in mutual esteem. I said I would go, and he asked me please
to do so as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Jack made round eyes, and even Jaz left off eating.</p>

<p>Did you QUARREL?&quot; cried Harriet.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, violently. But, of course, not vulgarly. We parted, as I said,
in mutual esteem, bowing each other out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ARE awful. You only went on purpose to upset him. I knew that all
along. Why must you be so spiteful?&quot; said Harriet. &quot;You're never happy
unless you're upsetting somebody's apple-cart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I doomed to agree with everybody, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But you needn't SET OUT to be disagreeable. And to Mr. Cooley
especially, who likes you and is such a warm, big man. You ought to be
flattered that he CARES what you think. No, you have to go and try and
undermine him. Ah - why was I ever pestered with such a viperish husband
as you!&quot; said Harriet.</p>

<p>Victoria made alert, frightened eyes. But Somers sat on with the same
little smile and courteous bearing.</p>

<p>&quot;I am, of course, immensely flattered at his noticing me,&quot; he replied.
&quot;Otherwise, naturally, I should have resented being told to leave. As it
was I didn't resent it a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you!&quot; cried Harriet. &quot;I know you and your pretences. That is
what has put you in such a temper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you remember I've been in a temper for days,&quot; he replied calmly and
gravely. &quot;Therefore there could be no putting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it only made you worse. I'm tired of your temper, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Mr. Somers isn't in a temper at all!&quot; cried Victoria. &quot;He's nicer
than any of us, really. Jack would be as angry as anything if I said all
those things to him. Shouldn't you, Jack?&quot; And she cuddled his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd be shut up in the coal-shed for the night before you got half way
through with it, if ever you started trying it on,&quot; he replied, with
marital humour.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I shouldn't either: or it would be the last door you'd shut on ME,
so there. But anyhow you'd be in a waxy old temper.&quot;</p>

<p>And she smiled at Somers as she cuddled her husband's arm.</p>

<p>&quot;If my hostess says I'm nice,&quot; said Somers, &quot;I am not going to feel
guilty whatever my WIFE may say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, you do feel guilty,&quot; said Harriet.</p>

<p>&quot;Your hostess doesn't find any fault with you at all,&quot; cried Victoria.
She was looking very pretty, in a brown chiffon dress. &quot;She thinks
you're the nicest of anybody here, there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; cried Jack. &quot;When I'm here as well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whether you're here or not. You're not very nice to me to-night, and
William James never is. But Mr. Somers is AWFULLY nice.&quot; She blushed
suddenly quite vividly, looking under her long lashes at him. He smiled
a little more intensely to himself.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you what, Mrs. Somers,&quot; said Jack. &quot;We'd better make a swap of
it, till they alter their opinion. You and me had better strike up a
match, and let them two elope with one another for a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what about William James?&quot; cried Victoria, with hurried, vivid
excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nobody need trouble themselves about William James,&quot; replied that
individual. &quot;It's about time he was rolling home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Harriet, in answer to Jack. &quot;I'm striking off no more
matches, thank you. The game's not worth the candle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, maybe you've only struck on the rough side, you know,&quot; said Jack.
&quot;You might strike on the smooth next time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Harriet. &quot;I'm going to bed, and leave you all to your
striking and your bad tempers. Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p>She rose roughly. Victoria jumped up to accompany her to her room. The
Somers had had a room each in Torestin, so Victoria had put them each
separately into a nice little room in her house.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it right,&quot; said Jack, &quot;that you got the wind up to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Somers. &quot;At least we only quite lovingly agreed to differ.
Nothing else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought it would be like that,&quot; said Jack. &quot;He thinks the world of
you, I can see that.&quot;</p>

<p>William James stood ready to leave. He looked at Somers cunningly, as if
reading into him with his light-grey, sceptical eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Somers doesn't care to commit himself so easily,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Jack. &quot;You blighters from the old country are so mighty
careful of risking yourselves. That's what I'm not. When I feel a thing
I jump up and go for it, and damn the consequences. There's always
plenty of time to think about a thing after you've done it. And then if
you're fool enough to wish you hadn't done it, why, that shows you
SHOULDN'T have. I don't go in for regrets, myself. I do what I want. And
if I wanted to do a thing, then it's ALL RIGHT when it's done. All a
man's got to do is to keep his mouth shut and his fist ready, and go
down on his knees to NOTHING. Then he can damn well do as he pleases.
And all he asks is that other folks shall do as they please, men or
women. Damn all this careful stunt. I'll step along as far as the tram
with you, Jaz, I feel like walking the Welsh rabbit down into his
burrow. Vicky prefers Mr. Somers to me pro tem. - and I don't begrudge it
her. Why should I?&quot;</p>

<p>Victoria was putting away the dishes, and seemed not to hear. The two
men went. Somers still sat in his chair. He was truly in a devil of a
temper, with everybody and everything: a wicked, fiendish mood that made
him LOOK quite handsome, as fate would have it. He had heard Jack's
hint. He knew Victoria was attracted to him: that she imagined no
nonsense about love, she was too remote from the old world, and too
momentary for that. The moment - that was all her feelings were to her.
And at this moment she was fascinated, and when she said, in her
slightly contralto voice:</p>

<p>&quot;You're not in a temper with ME, though, are you Mr. Somers?&quot; she was so
comely, like a maiden just ready for love, and like a comely, desirous
virgin offering herself to the wayfarer, in the name of the god of
bright desire, that Somers stretched out his hand and stroked her hot
cheek very delicately with the tips of his fingers, replying:</p>

<p>&quot;I could never be angry with you. You're much too winsome.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him with her dark eyes dilated into a glow, a glow of
offering. He smiled faintly, rising to his feet, and desire in all his
limbs like a power. The moment - and the power of the moment. Again he
felt his limbs full of desire, like a power. And his days of anger
seemed to culminate now in this moment, like bitter smouldering that at
last leaps into flame. Not love - just weapon-like desire. He knew it.
The god Bacchus. Iacchos! Iacchos! Bacchanals with weapon hands. She had
the sacred glow in her eyes. Bacchus, the true Bacchus. Jack would not
begrudge the god. And the fire was very clean and steely, after the
smoke. And he felt the velvety fire from her face in his finger-tips.</p>

<p>And still his old stubborn self intervened. He decided almost
involuntarily. Perhaps it was fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; he said to her. &quot;Jack will be back in a moment. You look
bonnie to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>And he went to his room. When he had shut the door, he wondered if it
was merely a sort of cowardice. Honour? No need as far as Jack was
concerned, apparently. And Harriet? She was too honest a female. She
would know that the dishonour, as far as she felt it, lay in the desire,
not in the act. For her, too, honour did not consist in a pledged word
kept according to pledge, but in a genuine feeling faithfully followed.
He had not to reckon with honour there.</p>

<p>What then? Why not follow the flame, the moment sacred to Bacchus? Why
not, if it was the way of life? He did not know why not. Perhaps only
old moral habit, or fear, as Jack said, of committing himself. Perhaps
only that. It was Victoria's high moment; all her high moments would
have this Bacchic, weapon-like momentaneity: since Victoria was
Victoria. Why then deny it?</p>

<p>The pagan way, the many gods, the different service, the sacred moments
of Bacchus. Other sacred moments: Zeus and Hera, for example, Ares and
Aphrodite, all the great moments of the gods. Why not know them all, all
the great moments of the gods, from the major moment with Hera to the
swift short moments of Io or Leda or Ganymede? Should not a man know the
whole range? And especially the bright, swift, weapon-like Bacchic
occasion, should not any man seize it when it offered?</p>

<p>But his heart of hearts was stubbornly puritanical. And his innermost
soul was dark and sullen, black with a sort of scorn. These moments bred
in the head and born in the eye: he had enough of them. These flashes of
desire for a visual object would no longer carry him into action. He had
no use for them. There was a downslope into Orcus, and a vast, phallic,
sacred darkness, where one was enveloped into the greater god as in an
Egyptian darkness. He would meet there or nowhere. To the visual
travesty he would lend himself no more.</p>

<p>Pondering and turning recklessly he heard Jack come back. Then he began
to doze. He did not sleep well in Australia, it seemed as if the
aboriginal daimon entered his body as he slept, to destroy its old
constitution. Sleep was almost pain, and too full of dreams. This night
he woke almost at once from a vivid little dream. The fact of the
soonness troubled him too, for at home he never dreamed till morning.</p>

<p>But the dream had been just this. He was standing in the living room at
Coo-ee, bending forward doing some little thing by the couch, perhaps
folding the newspaper, making the room tidy at the last moment before
going to bed, when suddenly a violent darkness came over him, he felt
his arms pinned, and he heard a man's voice speaking mockingly behind
him, with a laugh. It was as if he saw the man's face too - a stranger, a
rough, strong sort of Australian. And he realised with horror: &quot;Now they
have put a sack over my head, and fastened my arms, and I am in the
dark, and they are going to steal my little brown handbag from the
bedroom, which contains all the money we have.&quot; The shock of intense
reality made him fight his way out of the depths of the first sleep, but
it was some time before he could really lay hold of facts, like: &quot;I am
not at Coo-ee. I am not at Mullumbimby. I am in Sydney at Wyewurk, and
the Callcotts are in the next room.&quot; So he came really awake. But if the
thing had really happened, it could hardly have happened to him more
than in this dream.</p>

<p>In the morning they were returning to the South Coast. But Jack said to
Somers, a little sarcastically:</p>

<p>&quot;You aren't altogether pleased with us, then?&quot;</p>

<p>Somers hesitated before replying:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not altogether pleased with myself, am I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to be so particular, in this life,&quot; said Jack.</p>

<p>&quot;I may have to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can't have it all perfect beforehand, you know. You've got to sink
a few times before you can swim.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sink in what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, it seems to me you want to have a thing all ready in your hand,
know all about it, before you'll try it. And there's some things you
can't do that with. You've just got to flop into them, like when you
chuck a dog into water.&quot;</p>

<p>Somers received this rebuke rather sourly. This was the first wintry day
they had really had. There was a cold fog in Sydney in the morning, and
rain in the fog. In the hills it would be snow - away in the Blue
Mountains. But the fog lifted, and the rain held off, and there was a
wash of yellowish sunshine.</p>

<p>Harriet of course had to talk to a fellow-passenger in the train,
because Lovat was his glummest. It was a red-moustached Welshman with a
slightly injured look in his pale blue eyes, as if everything hadn't
been as good to him as he thought it ought, considering his merit. He
said his name was Evans, and he kept a store. He had been sixteen years
in the country.</p>

<p>And is it VERY hot in the summer?&quot; said Harriet. &quot;I suppose it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it's very hot. I've known the days when I've had to lie
down at two o'clock in the afternoon, and not been able to move.
Overpowered, that's what it is, overpowered.&quot;</p>

<p>Harriet was suitably impressed, having tried heat in India.</p>

<p>&quot;And do you think it takes one long to get used to this country?&quot; she
asked after a while.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I should say it takes about four or five years for your blood
properly to thin down. You can't say you've begun, under two years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four or five years!&quot; re-echoed Harriet. But what she was really turning
over in her mind was this phrase: &quot;For your blood to thin down.&quot; To thin
down! how queer! Lovat also heard the sentence, and realized that his
blood took this thinning very badly, and still about four years of
simmering ahead, apparently, if he stayed in this country. And when the
blood had finished its thinning, what then? He looked at Mr. Evans, with
the sharp pale nose and the reddish hair and the injured look in his
pale-blue eyes. Mr. Evans seemed to find it sweet still to talk to
people from the &quot;old country&quot;. &quot;You're from the old country?&quot; - the
inevitable question. The thinning down had left him looking as if he
felt he lacked something. Yet he wouldn't go back to South Wales. Oh no,
he wouldn't go back.</p>

<p>&quot;The blood is thinner out here than in the old country.&quot; The Australians
seemed to accept this as a scientific fact. Richard felt he didn't want
his blood thinned down to the Australian constituency. Yet no doubt in
the night, in his sleep, the metabolic change was taking place fast and
furious.</p>

<p>It was raining a little in the late afternoon when Somers and Harriet
got back to Coo-ee. With infinite relief she stepped across her own
threshold.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; she said, taking a long breath. &quot;Thank God to be back.&quot; She looked
round, and went to rearrange on the sofa the cushions that they had
whacked so hard to get the dust out.</p>

<p>Somers went to the edge of the grass to be near the sea. It was raving
in long, rasping lines of hissing breakers - not very high ones, but very
long. The sky hung grey, with veils of dark rain out to sea, and in the
south a blackness of much rain blowing nearer in the wind. At the end of
the jetty, in the mist of the sea-wind's spray, a long, heavy
coal-steamer was slowly toiling to cast loose and get away. The waves
were so long and the current so strong, they would hardly let her turn
and get clear of the misty-black jetty.</p>

<p>Under the dark-grey sky the sea looked bright, but coldly bright, with
its yellow-green waves and its ramparts of white foam. There were
usually three white ramparts, one behind the other, of rasping surf: and
sometimes four. Then the long swish and surge of the shoreward wash. The
coast was quite deserted: the steep sand wet as the backwash slid away:
the rocks wet with rain: the low, long black steamer still laboured in
the fume of the wind, indistinctly.</p>

<p>Somers turned indoors, and suddenly began taking off his clothes. In a
minute he was running naked in the rain which fell with lovely freshness
on his skin. Ah, he felt so stuffy after that sort of emotional heat in
town. Harriet in amazement saw him whitely disappearing over the edge of
the low cliff-bank, and came to the edge to look.</p>

<p>He ran quickly over the sands, where the wind blew cold but velvety, and
the raindrops fell loosely. He walked straight into the fore-wash, and
fell into an advancing ripple. At least it looked a ripple, but was
enough to roll him over so that he went under and got a little taste of
the Pacific. Ah, the fresh cold wetness! - the fresh cold wetness! The
water rushed in the back-wash and the sand melted under him, leaving him
stranded like a fish. He turned again to the water. The walls of surf
were some distance off, but near enough to look rather awful as they
raced in high white walls shattering towards him. And above the ridge of
the raving whiteness the dimness of the labouring steamer, as if it were
perched on a bough.</p>

<p>Of course he did not go near the surf. No, the last green ripples of the
broken swell were enough to catch him by the scruff of the neck and
tumble him rudely up the beach, in a pell-mell. But even the blow did
one good, as the sea struck one heavily on the back, if one were
fleeing; full on the chest, if one were advancing.</p>

<p>It was raining quite heavily as he walked out, and the skies hung low
over the sea, dark over the green and white vigour of the ocean. The
shore was so foam-white it almost suggested sun. The rain felt almost
warm.</p>

<p>Harriet came walking across the grass with a towel.</p>

<p>&quot;What a good idea!&quot; she said. &quot;If I'd known I'd have come. I wish I
had.&quot;</p>

<p>But he ignored the towel, and went into the little wash-place and under
the shower, to wash off the sticky, strong Pacific. Harriet came along
with the towel, and he put his hand to her face and nodded to her. She
knew what he meant, and went wondering, and when he had rubbed the wet
off himself he came to her.</p>

<p>To the end she was more wondering than anything. But when it was the
end, and the night was falling outside, she laughed and said to him:</p>

<p>&quot;That was done in style. That was chic. Straight from the sea, like
another creature.&quot;</p>

<p>Style and chic seemed to him somewhat ill suited to the occasion, but he
brought her a bowl of warm water and went and made the tea. The wind was
getting noisier, and the sea was shut out but still calling outside the
house. They had tea and toast and quince jam, and one of the seven brown
teapots with a bit off the spout shone quite nicely and brightly at a
corner of the little red-and-white check tea-cloth, which itself
occupied a corner of the big, polished jarrah table. But, thank God, he
felt cool and fresh and detached, not cosy and domestic. He was so
thankful not to be feeling cosy and &quot;homely&quot;. The room felt as
penetrable to the outside influence as if it were a sea-shell lying on
the beach, cool with the freshness and insistence of the sea, not a
snug, cosy box to be secured inside.</p>

<p>And Jack Callcott's rebuke stuck in his throat. Perhaps after all he was
just a Pommy, prescribing things with overmuch emphasis, and wanting to
feel God-Almighty in the face of unborn events. A Pommy is a newcomer in
Australia, from the Old Country.</p>

<p>Teacher: Why did you hit him, Georgie?</p>

<p>Georgie: Please miss, he called me a Pommy.</p>

<p>Aussie (with a discoloured eye): Well, you're one, ain'cher? Can I help
it that ch'are one?</p>

<p>Pommy is supposed to be short for pomegranate. Pomegranate, pronounced
invariably pommygranate, is a near enough rhyme to immigrant, in a
naturally rhyming country. Furthermore, immigrants are known in their
first months, before their blood &quot;thins down,&quot; by their round and ruddy
cheeks. So we are told. Hence again, pomegranate, and hence Pommy. Let
etymologists be appeased: it is the authorised derivation.</p>

<p>Perhaps, said Somers to himself, I am just a Pommy and a fool. If my
blood had thinned down, I shouldn't make all this fuss over sharing in
with Kangaroo or being mates with Jack Callcott. If I am not a ruddy
Pommy, I am a green one. Of course they take the thing as it comes to
them, and they expect me to do the same. Yet there I am hopping and
hissing like a fish in a frying-pan. Putting too much &quot;soul&quot; into it.
Far too much. When your blood has thinned down, out here, there's
nothing but the merest sediment of a soul left, and your wits and your
feelings are clear of it. You take things as they come, as Jack says.
Isn't that the sanest way to take them, instead of trying to drive them
through the exact hole in the hedge that you've managed to poke your
head through? Oh, you unlearn a lot as your blood thins down. But
there's an awful lot to be unlearnt. And when you've unlearnt it, you
never say so. In the first place, because it's dead against the sane old
British tradition. And in the second place, because you don't really
care about telling what you feel, once your blood has thinned down and
is clear of soul.</p>

<p>&quot;Thin, you Australian burgundy,&quot; said Somers to his own body, when he
caught a glimpse of it unawares, reflected in the glass as he was going
to bed. &quot;You're thin enough as a bottle, but the wine needs a lot of
maturing. I've made a fool of myself latterly.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet he said to himself: &quot;Do I want my blood to thin down like
theirs? - that peculiar emptiness that is in them, because of the
thinning that's gone out of them? Do I want this curious transparent
blood of the antipodes, with its momentaneous feelings, and its sort of
ABSENTNESS? But of course till my blood has thinned down I shan't see
with their eyes. And how in the name of heaven is this world-brotherhood
mankind going to see with one eye, eye to eye, when the very blood is of
different thickness on different continents, and with the difference in
blood, the inevitable psychic difference? Different vision!&quot;</p>
