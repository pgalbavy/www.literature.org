<p>When Jimmy got home that night he saw a light in the Lizard's room and
entered.
</p><p>"Well," said the cracksman, "how's every little thing?"
</p><p>Jimmy smiled ruefully.
</p><p>"Canned again," he announced, and then he told the Lizard the story of
his downfall, attributing the results of the third round, however, to
Brophy's unwarranted action at the end of the second.
</p><p>"Well," said the Lizard, "you certainly are the champion boob.  There
you had a chance to cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and
instead you kill it for yourself and everybody else."
</p><p>"You don't think," said Jimmy, "that I would have put any money on that
crooked scrap."
</p><p>"Why not?" asked the Lizard, and then he shook his head sadly.  "No, I
don't suppose you would. There's lots of things about you that I can't
understand, and one of them is the fact that you would rather starve to
death than take a little easy money off of birds that have got more than
they got any business to have. Why, with your education and front we two
could pull off some of the classiest stuff that this burg ever saw."
</p><p>"Forget it," admonished Jimmy.
</p><p>"What are you going to do now?" asked the Lizard.
</p><p>"Go out and hunt for another job," said Jimmy.
</p><p>"Well, I wish you luck," said the Lizard.
</p><p>"Maybe I can find something for you.  I'll try, and in the mean time if
you need any mazuma I always got a little roll tucked away in my sock."
</p><p>"Thanks," said Jimmy, "and I don't mind telling you that you're the one
man I know whom I'd just as soon borrow from and would like the
opportunity of loaning to. You say that you can't understand me, and yet
you're a whole lot more of an enigma yourself! You admit, in fact,
you're inclined to boast, that you're a pickpocket and a safe-blower and
yet I'd trust you, Lizard, with anything that I had."
</p><p>The Lizard smiled, and for the first time since he had known him Jimmy
noticed that his eyes smiled with his lips.
</p><p>"I've always had the reputation," said the Lizard, "of being a white guy
with my friends. As a matter of fact, I ain't no different from what
you'd probably be if you were in business and what most of your friends
are. Morally they're a bunch of thieves and crooks. Of course, they
don't go out and frisk any one and they don't work with a jimmy or a
bottle of soup. They work their graft with the help of contracts and
lawyers, and they'd gyp a friend or a pauper almost as soon as they
would an enemy. I don't know much about morality, but when it comes
right down to a question of morals I believe my trade is just as decent
as that of a lot of these birds you see rolling up and down Mich Boul in
their limousines."
</p><p>"It's all in the point of view," said Jimmy.
</p><p>"Yes," said the Lizard.  "It's all in the point of view, and my point of
view ain't warped by no college education."
</p><p>Jimmy grinned.  "Eventually, Lizard, you may win me over; but when you
do why fritter away our abilities upon this simple village when we have
the capitals of all Europe to play around in?"
</p><p>"There's something in that," said the Lizard; "but don't get it into
your head for a minute that I am tryin' to drag you from the straight
and narrow. I think I like you better the way you are."
</p><p>"Did you ever," said Harriet Holden, "see anything so weird as the way
we keep bumping into that stocking-counter young man?"
</p><p>"No," said Elizabeth, "it's commencing to get on my nerves.  Every time
I turn a corner now I expect to bump into him. I suppose we see other
people many times without recognizing them, but he is so utterly
good-looking that he sort of sticks in one's memory."
</p><p>"Do you know," said Harriet, "that I have a suspicion that he recognized
us. I saw him looking up at us just after that other person knocked him
down and I could have sworn that he blushed. And then, you know, he went
in and was entirely different from what he had been in the two preceding
rounds. Billy said that he is really a wonderful fighter, and there are
not very many good fights that Billy misses. What in the world do you
suppose his profession is anyway? Since we first noticed him he has been
a hosiery clerk, a waiter, and a prize-fighter."
</p><p>"I don't know, I am sure," said Elizabeth, yawning.  "You seem to be
terribly interested in him."
</p><p>"I am," admitted Harriet frankly.  "He's a regular adventure all in
himself--a whole series of adventures."
</p><p>"I've never been partial to serials," said Elizabeth.
</p><p>"Well, I should think one would be a relief after a whole winter of
heavy tragedy," retorted Harriet.
</p><p>"What do you mean?" asked Elizabeth.
</p><p>"Oh, I mean Harold, of course," said Harriet.  "He's gone around all
winter with a grouch and a face a mile long. What's the matter with him
anyway?"
</p><p>"I don't know," sighed Elizabeth.  "I'm afraid he's working too hard."
</p><p>Harriet giggled.
</p><p>"Oh, fiddlesticks!" she exclaimed.  "You know perfectly well that
Harold Bince will never work himself to death."
</p><p>"Well, he is working hard, Harriet.  Father says so.  And he's worrying
about the business, too. He's trying so hard to make good."
</p><p>"I will admit that he has stuck to his job more faithfully than anybody
expected him to."
</p><p>Elizabeth turned slowly upon her friend, "You don't like Harold," she
said; "why is it?"
</p><p>Harriet shook her head.
</p><p>"I do like him, Elizabeth, for your sake.  I suppose the trouble is that
I realize that he is not good enough for you. I have known him all my
life, and even as a little child he was never sincere. Possibly he has
changed now. I hope so. And then again I know as well as you do that you
are not in love with him."
</p><p>"How perfectly ridiculous!" cried Elizabeth.  "Do you suppose that I
would marry a man whom I didn't love?"
</p><p>"You haven't the remotest idea what love is.  You've never been in
love."
</p><p>"Have you?" asked Elizabeth.
</p><p>"No," replied Harriet, "I haven't, but I know the symptoms and you
certainly haven't got one of them. Whenever Harold isn't going to be up
for dinner or for the evening you're always relieved. Possibly you don't
realize it yourself, but you show it to any one who knows you."
</p><p>"Well, I do love him," insisted Elizabeth, "and I intend to marry him.
I never had any patience with this silly, love-sick business that
requires people to pine away when they are not together and bore
everybody else to death when they were."
</p><p>"All of which proves," said Harriet, "that you haven't been stung yet,
and I sincerely hope that you may never be unless it happens before you
marry Harold."
