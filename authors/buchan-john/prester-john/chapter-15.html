<p>I was perhaps half a mile the nearer to the glen, and was likely
to get there first.  And after that?  I could see the track winding
by the waterside and then crossing a hill-shoulder which diverted
the stream. It was a road a man could scarcely ride, and a tired
man would have a hard job to climb.  I do not think that I had
any hope.  My exhilaration had died as suddenly as it had been
born.  I saw myself caught and carried off to Laputa, who must
now be close on the rendezvous at Inanda's Kraal.  I had no weapon
to make a fight for it. My foemen were many and untired.  It must
be only a matter of minutes till I was in their hands.</p>

<p>More in a dogged fury of disappointment than with any hope of
escape I forced my sore legs up the glen.  Ten minutes ago I had
been exulting in the glories of the morning, and now the sun was
not less bright or the colours less fair, but the heart had gone
out of the spectator.  At first I managed to get some pace out
of myself, partly from fear and partly from anger.  But I soon
found that my body had been tried too far. I could plod along,
but to save my life I could not have hurried. Any healthy savage
could have caught me in a hundred yards.</p>

<p>The track, I remember, was overhung with creepers, and often
I had to squeeze through thickets of tree-ferns.  Countless little
brooks ran down from the hillside, threads of silver among the
green pastures. Soon I left the stream and climbed up on the shoulder,
where the road was not much better than a precipice.  Every step
was a weariness.  I could hardly drag one foot after the other,
and my heart was beating like the fanners of a mill, I had spasms
of acute sickness, and it took all my resolution to keep me from
lying down by the roadside.</p>

<p>At last I was at the top of the shoulder and could look back.
There was no sign of anybody on the road so far as I could see. 
Could I have escaped them?  I had been in the shadow of the trees
for the first part, and they might have lost sight of me and concluded
that I had avoided the glen or tried one of the faces.  Before
me, I remember, there stretched the upper glen, a green cup-shaped
hollow with the sides scarred by ravines. There was a high waterfall
in one of them which was white as snow against the red rocks. 
My wits must have been shaky, for I took the fall for a snowdrift,
and wondered sillily why the Berg had grown so Alpine.</p>

<p>A faint spasm of hope took me into that green cup.  The bracken
was as thick as on the Pentlands, and there was a multitude of
small lovely flowers in the grass.  It was like a water-meadow
at home, such a place as I had often in boyhood searched for moss-cheepers'
and corncrakes' eggs.  Birds were crying round me as I broke this
solitude, and one small buck&mdash;a klipspringer&mdash;rose from my feet
and dashed up one of the gullies.  Before me was a steep green
wall with the sky blue above it. Beyond it was safety, but as
my sweat-dimmed eyes looked at it I knew that I could never reach
it.</p>

<p>Then I saw my pursuers.  High up on the left side, and rounding
the rim of the cup, were little black figures.  They had not followed
my trail, but, certain of my purpose, had gone forward to intercept
me.  I remember feeling a puny weakling compared with those lusty
natives who could make such good going on steep mountains.  They
were certainly no men of the plains, but hillmen, probably some
remnants of old Machudi's tribe who still squatted in the glen. 
Machudi was a blackguard chief whom the Boers long ago smashed
in one of their native wars.  He was a fierce old warrior and
had put up a good fight to the last, till a hired impi of Swazis
had surrounded his hiding-place in the forest and destroyed him. 
A Boer farmer on the plateau had his skull, and used to drink
whisky out of it when he was merry.</p>

<p>The sight of the pursuit was the last straw.  I gave up hope,
and my intentions were narrowed to one frantic desire&mdash;to hide
the jewels. Patriotism, which I had almost forgotten, flickered
up in that crisis. At any rate Laputa should not have the Snake. 
If he drove out the white man, he should not clasp the Prester's
rubies on his great neck.</p>

<p>There was no cover in the green cup, so I turned up the ravine
on the right side.  The enemy, so far as I could judge, were on
the left and in front, and in the gully I might find a pot-hole
to bury the necklet in.  Only a desperate resolution took me through
the tangle of juniper bushes into the red screes of the gully. 
At first I could not find what I sought.  The stream in the ravine
slid down a long slope like a mill-race, and the sides were bare
and stony.  Still I plodded on, helping myself with a hand on
Colin's back, for my legs were numb with fatigue.  By-and-by the
gully narrowed, and I came to a flat place with a long pool. 
Beyond was a little fall, and up this I climbed into a network
of tiny cascades.  Over one pool hung a dead tree-fern, and a
bay from it ran into a hole of the rock. I slipped the jewels
far into the hole, where they lay on the firm sand, showing odd
lights through the dim blue water. Then I scrambled down again
to the flat space and the pool, and looked round to see if any
one had reached the edge of the ravine.  There was no sign as
yet of the pursuit, so I dropped limply on the shingle and waited. 
For I had suddenly conceived a plan.</p>

<p>As my breath came back to me my wits came back from their wandering.
These men were not there to kill me, but to capture me.  They
could know nothing of the jewels, for Laputa would never have
dared to make the loss of the sacred Snake public.  Therefore
they would not suspect what I had done, and would simply lead
me to Laputa at Inanda's Kraal. I began to see the glimmerings
of a plan for saving my life, and by God's grace, for saving my
country from the horrors of rebellion.  The more I thought the
better I liked it.  It demanded a bold front, and it might well
miscarry, but I had taken such desperate hazards during the past
days that I was less afraid of fortune.  Anyhow, the choice lay
between certain death and a slender chance of life, and it was
easy to decide.</p>

<p>Playing football, I used to notice how towards the end of a game
I might be sore and weary, without a kick in my body; but when
I had a straight job of tackling a man my strength miraculously
returned.  It was even so now.  I lay on my side, luxuriating
in being still, and slowly a sort of vigour crept back into my
limbs.  Perhaps a half-hour of rest was given me before, on the
lip of the gully, I saw figures appear.  Looking down I saw several
men who had come across from the opposite side of the valley,
scrambling up the stream.  I got to my feet, with Colin bristling
beside me, and awaited them with the stiffest face I could muster.</p>

<p>As I expected, they were Machudi's men.  I recognized them by
the red ochre in their hair and their copper-wire necklets. Big
fellows they were, long-legged and deep in the chest, the true
breed of mountaineers.  I admired their light tread on the slippery
rock.  It was hopeless to think of evading such men in their own
hills.</p>

<p>The men from the side joined the men in front, and they stood
looking at me from about twelve yards off.  They were armed only
with knobkerries, and very clearly were no part of Laputa's army. 
This made their errand plain to me.</p>

<p>'Halt!' I said in Kaffir, as one of them made a hesitating step
to advance.  'Who are you and what do you seek?'</p>

<p>There was no answer, but they looked at me curiously. Then one
made a motion with his stick.  Colin gave a growl, and would have
been on him if I had not kept a hand on his collar. The rash man
drew back, and all stood stiff and perplexed.</p>

<p>'Keep your hands by your side,' I said, 'or the dog, who has
a devil, will devour you.  One of you speak for the rest and tell
me your purpose.'</p>

<p>For a moment I had a wild notion that they might be friends,
some of Arcoll's scouts, and out to help me.  But the first words
shattered the fancy.</p>

<p>'We are sent by Inkulu,' the biggest of them said.  'He bade
us bring you to him.'</p>

<p>'And what if I refuse to go?'</p>

<p>'Then, Baas, we must take you to him.  We are under the vow of
the Snake.'</p>

<p>'Vow of fiddlestick!' I cried.  'Who do you think is the bigger
chief, the Inkulu or Ratitswan?  I tell you Ratitswan is now driving
Inkulu before him as a wind drives rotten leaves.  It will be
well for you, men of Machudi, to make peace with Ratitswan and
take me to him on the Berg.  If you bring me to him, I and he
will reward you; but if you do Inkulu's bidding you will soon
be hunted like buck out of your hills.'</p>

<p>They grinned at one another, but I could see that my words had
no effect.  Laputa had done his business too well.</p>

<p>The spokesman shrugged his shoulders in the way the Kaffirs have.
'We wish you no ill, Baas, but we have been bidden to take you
to Inkulu. We cannot disobey the command of the Snake.'</p>

<p>My weakness was coming on me again, and I could talk no more. 
I sat down plump on the ground, almost falling into the pool. 
'Take me to Inkulu,' I stammered with a dry throat, 'I do not
fear him;' and I rolled half-fainting on my back.</p>

<p>These clansmen of Machudi were decent fellows.  One of them had
some Kaffir beer in a calabash, which he gave me to drink.  The
stuff was thin and sickly, but the fermentation in it did me good. 
I had the sense to remember my need of sleep. 'The day is young,'
I said, 'and I have come far.  I ask to be allowed to sleep for
an hour.'</p>

<p>The men made no difficulty, and with my head between Colin's
paws I slipped into dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>When they wakened me the sun was beginning to climb the sky,
I judged it to be about eight o'clock.  They had made a little
fire and roasted mealies.  Some of the food they gave me, and
I ate it thankfully.  I was feeling better, and I think a pipe
would have almost completed my cure.</p>

<p>But when I stood up I found that I was worse than I had thought. 
The truth is, I was leg-weary, which you often see in horses,
but rarely in men.  What the proper explanation is I do not know,
but the muscles simply refuse to answer the direction of the will. 
I found my legs sprawling like a child's who is learning to walk.</p>

<p>'If you want me to go to the Inkulu, you must carry me,' I said,
as I dropped once more on the ground.</p>

<p>The men nodded, and set to work to make a kind of litter out
of their knobkerries and some old ropes they carried.  As they
worked and chattered I looked idly at the left bank of the ravine&mdash;that
is, the left as you ascend it.  Some of Machudi's men had come
down there, and, though the place looked sheer and perilous, I
saw how they had managed it.  I followed out bit by bit the track
upwards, not with any thought of escape, but merely to keep my
mind under control.  The right road was from the foot of the pool
up a long shelf to a clump of juniper. Then there was an easy
chimney; then a piece of good hand-and-foot climbing; and last,
another ledge which led by an easy gradient to the top.  I figured
all this out as I have heard a condemned man will count the windows
of the houses on his way to the scaffold.</p>

<p>Presently the litter was ready, and the men made signs to me
to get into it.  They carried me down the ravine and up the Machudi
burn to the green walls at its head.  I admired their bodily fitness,
for they bore me up those steep slopes with never a halt, zigzagging
in the proper style of mountain transport.  In less than an hour
we had topped the ridge, and the plateau was before me.</p>

<p>It looked very homelike and gracious, rolling in gentle undulations
to the western horizon, with clumps of wood in its hollows.  Far
away I saw smoke rising from what should be the village of the
Iron Kranz.  It was the country of my own people, and my captors
behoved to go cautiously.  They were old hands at veld-craft,
and it was wonderful the way in which they kept out of sight even
on the bare ridges. Arcoll could have taught them nothing in the
art of scouting.  At an incredible pace they hurried me along,
now in a meadow by a stream side, now through a patch of forest,
and now skirting a green shoulder of hill.</p>

<p>Once they clapped down suddenly, and crawled into the lee of
some thick bracken.  Then very quietly they tied my hands and
feet, and, not urgently, wound a dirty length of cotton over my
mouth.  Colin was meantime held tight and muzzled with a kind
of bag strapped over his head.  To get this over his snapping
jaws took the whole strength of the party.  I guessed that we
were nearing the highroad which runs from the plateau down the
Great Letaba valley to the mining township of Wesselsburg, away
out on the plain.  The police patrols must be on this road, and
there was risk in crossing.  Sure enough I seemed to catch a jingle
of bridles as if from some company of men riding in haste.</p>

<p>We lay still for a little till the scouts came back and reported
the coast clear.  Then we made a dart for the road, crossed it,
and got into cover on the other side, where the ground sloped
down to the Letaba glen.  I noticed in crossing that the dust
of the highway was thick with the marks of shod horses.  I was
very near and yet very far from my own people.</p>

<p>Once in the rocky gorge of the Letaba we advanced with less care. 
We scrambled up a steep side gorge and came on to the small plateau
from which the Cloud Mountains rise.  After that I was so tired
that I drowsed away, heedless of the bumping of the litter.  We
went up and up, and when I next opened my eyes we had gone through
a pass into a hollow of the hills. There was a flat space a mile
or two square, and all round it stern black ramparts of rock. 
This must be Inanda's Kraal, a strong place if ever one existed,
for a few men could defend all the approaches.  Considering that
I had warned Arcoll of this rendezvous, I marvelled that no attempt
had been made to hold the entrance.  The place was impregnable
unless guns were brought up to the heights.  I remember thinking
of a story I had heard&mdash;how in the war Beyers took his guns into
the Wolkberg, and thereby saved them from our troops.  Could Arcoll
be meditating the same exploit?</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard the sound of loud voices, and my litter was
dropped roughly on the ground.  I woke to clear consciousness
in the midst of pandemonium.</p>
