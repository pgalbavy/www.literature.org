<p>The Muley Cow rather enjoyed the talk she caused because she had eaten
Jack O'Lantern. And feeling that any one so brave ought not to appear
too meek and mild, she sometimes tried to look as fierce as she could.
</p>
<p>Somehow she could never manage a frown when old dog Spot was about. But
if she came across Master Meadow Mouse all alone in the pasture she
never failed to bellow at him and ask him in a gruff tone what he was
doing there.
</p><p>When she first spoke to him like that Master Meadow Mouse was startled.
</p><p>"I'm only taking a stroll," he piped.
</p><p>The Muley Cow glared at him for a few moments. She wanted to act
ferocious; but unfortunately she could think of nothing more to say. And
not wishing to seem at a loss for words, she began to cough.
</p><p>Before she had stopped coughing Master Meadow Mouse ran away. And that
was exactly what the Muley Cow had hoped he would do. It would have been
very awkward for her if he had waited until she had stopped coughing.
For try as she would, she could think of nothing ferocious to say.
</p><p>The next time the Muley Cow met Master Meadow Mouse she bellowed at him
again and stamped her feet at him, so that the ground trembled beneath
him. He was too frightened to run. So he stood still and shivered. And
that made the Muley Cow quite uncomfortable. Master Meadow Mouse stared
at her while he panted with fright. And again the Muley Cow could think
of nothing but pleasant remarks to make.
</p><p>So she began coughing once more. But to her great dismay Master Meadow
Mouse didn't run away. And since she couldn't cough forever, but had to
stop sometime, she paused to get her breath. And then she asked him a
question.
</p><p>"Can't you see I'm very fierce?" she inquired. "Why don't you run away?"
</p><p>"I was waiting to see what happened," said Master Meadow Mouse
pleasantly. "I thought maybe you'd choke."
</p><p>Well, the Muley Cow was so surprised she didn't know what to say to
that. And to hide her confusion she started coughing again.
</p><p>Again she stopped, for of course she soon had to. Master Meadow Mouse
had waited hopefully, watching her closely to see if she were not going
to choke that time, anyhow. And when she didn't he was quite
disappointed.
</p><p>"Try it again--will you?" he besought the Muley Cow.
</p><p>"What!" she bawled. "Do you <u>want</u> me to choke?"
</p><p>"Yes!" he told her. "I thought that if you did, Farmer Green would come
and run a whip-stock down your throat. And that would be great fun to
watch, you know."
</p><p>The Muley Cow gasped. She saw that Master Meadow Mouse knew all about
her choking over an apple, in the orchard. And that was something she
never liked to talk about. To tell the truth, she was somewhat ashamed
of the whole affair. "Go away!" she bade Master Meadow Mouse. "Go away!
I don't want anything to do with you." But her voice wasn't the least
bit fierce. Nor was he the least bit frightened.
</p><p>In the end it was the Muley Cow herself that ran off. And Master Meadow
Mouse even followed her all the way to the bars.
</p><p>The Muley Cow was so ashamed to have been chased by a Meadow Mouse (and
a young one, at that!) that she scarcely dared look anybody in the face
until milking-time.
