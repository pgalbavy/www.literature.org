<p>The new arrivals resembled Burt Hawkins in their dress and accoutrements.
They wore coon-skin caps, hunting dress, leggings, coarse shoes,
etc., and each carried a long rifle and hunting knife as his weapons.
They were rugged, powerful fellows, whose long experience in the
wilderness had given them a knowledge of its ways and mysteries,
beyond that of ordinary men. They were hardy and active, with
the faculties of hearing, seeing and smelling cultivated to a
point almost incredible. They contrasted with Hawkins in one respect;
both wore their faces smooth. Although far removed from civilization,
they kept themselves provided with the means of shaving their
cheeks. Perhaps through indifference, their beards were sometimes
allowed to grow for weeks, but they made sure they were in presentable
shape when they rode into the trading post of St. Louis, with
their peltries, and, receiving pay therefor, joined their families
in that frontier town.</p>

<p>The three men had been hunters and trappers for many years. Sometimes
they pursued their work alone, and sometimes in the company of
others. They trapped principally for beavers and otters, though
they generally bagged a few foxes and other fur-bearing animals.
A hundred years ago, there were numerous beaver runs in the central
portions of our country, and for a long time many men were employed
in gathering their valuable furs, hundred and thousands of which
were brought from the mountain streams and solitudes of the West
to St. Louis, whence they were sent eastward and distributed.</p>

<p>The trapper's pursuit has always been a severe one, for, aside
from the fierce storms, sudden changes, and violent weather, the
men as a rule were exposed to the rifles of lurking Indians, who
resented the intrusion of any one into their territory. And yet
there was an attraction about the solitary life, far beyond the
confines of civilization, which took men from their families and
buried them in the wilderness, frequently for years at a time.
It is not difficult to understand the fascination which kept Daniel
Boone wandering for months through the woods and cane-brakes of
Kentucky, without a single companion and with the Indians almost
continually at his heels.</p>

<p>When Burt Hawkins and his two friends left St. Louis, late in
summer or early in the fall, each rode a mule or horse, besides
having two pack animals to carry their supplies and peltries.
They followed some faintly marked trail, made perhaps by the hoofs
of their own animals, and did not reach their destination for
several weeks. When they halted, it was among the tributaries
of the Missouri, which have their rise in the Ozark range in the
present State of Missouri.</p>

<p>The traps and implements which from time to time were taken westward,
were not, as a matter of course, brought back, for that would
have encumbered their animals to no purpose. When warm weather
approached and the fur bearers began shedding their hair, the
traps were gathered and stowed away until needed again in the
autumn. Then the skins that had been taken from time to time through
the winter, were brought forth and strapped on the backs of the
animals, and the journey homeward was begun. There was no trouble
for the trappers to "float their sticks," as the expression went;
for the Northwest Fur Company and other wealthy corporations had
their agents in St. Louis and at other points, where they were
glad to buy at liberal prices all the peltries within reach.</p>

<p>No trapper was likely to accumulate wealth by the method named,
but it cost him little to live, and frequently during the summer
he found some other employment that brought return for his labor.</p>

<p>Hawkins, Kellogg and Crumpet were on their way home, having started
a little later than their custom, and they had reached the point
referred to on the preceding night, when they halted and went
into camp. In the morning, when they began to reload their animals,
it was found that a rifle belonging to Kit Kellogg was missing.
It had been strapped on the package which one of the mules carried,
but had worked loose and fallen unnoticed to the ground. It was
too valuable to be abandoned, and Kit and Crumpet started back
to hunt for it. They went on foot, leaving the animals cropping
some succulent grass a short distance away.</p>

<p>The quadrupeds underwent a hard time during the winter, when
grass was scanty, so that such halts were appreciated by them.
The spot where they were grazing was far enough removed to screen
them from the sight of Deerfoot, when he was reconnoitering the
camp. While two of the company were hunting for the weapon, the
third remained behind, smoking his pipe, and, when the time came,
prepared dinner against the return of the other ones. The meat
was good, but not so delicate as the beaver tails on which they
frequently feasted during the cold season.</p>

<p>It has been said more than once that the Indians along the western
bank of the Mississippi were less aggressive than those who so
often crimsoned the soil of Kentucky and Ohio with the blood of
the pioneers. Such was the truth, but those who were found on
the very outermost fringe of civilization, from far up toward
the headwaters of the Yellowstone down to the Gulf, were anything
but harmless creatures. As the more warlike tribes in the East
were pushed over into that region, they carried their vindictive
natures with them, and the reader knows too well the history of
the great West to require anything further to be said in that
direction.</p>

<p>When Hawkins went to the beaver-runs with his friends in the
autumn preceding his meeting with Deerfoot, he had as his companions,
besides the two named, a third &mdash;Albert Rushton, who, like
the others, was a veteran trapper. One snowy day in mid-winter,
when the weather was unusually severe, he started on his round
of his division of the traps and never came back. His prolonged
absence led to a search, and his dead body was found beside one
of the demolished traps. The bullet hole through his forehead
and the missing scalp that had been torn from his crown, told
plainly the manner of his death.</p>

<p>This was a shocking occurrence, but the fate of Rushton was that
to which every one of his friends was liable, and they did not
sit down and repine over what could not be helped. The saddest
thought connected with the matter was that one of the three must
break the news to the invalid wife, who lived with her two children
in one of the frontier settlements through which they passed on
the way to St. Louis.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot told Hawkins the others were returning, the trapper
turned his head and saw that Kellogg had found the missing rifle.
The couple looked sharply at the warrior as they advanced, and
evidently were surprised to see him in camp. Kellogg and Crumpet
were men in middle life, strong limbed, sinewy and vigilant.</p>

<p>Deerfoot rose from the log whereon he was sitting, and extended
his hand to each in turn, as Hawkins pronounced his name. Kit
Kellogg scrutinized him and shook his hand with considerable warmth.
Crumpet did the same, though with less cordiality in his manner.
It was plain (and plainer to none than Deerfoot) that he was one
of that numerous class of frontiersmen who regard the American
Indian as an unmitigated nuisance, which, so far as possible,
every white man should do his utmost to abate. He had been engaged
in more than one desperate encounter with them and his hatred
was of the most ferocious nature. It was not to be expected, however,
that his detestation would show itself without regard to time
and place. Kellogg and Hawkins watched him with some curiosity,
as he extended his horny hand and shook that of the handsome Indian
youth.</p>

<p>"You've heard of Deerfoot," added Burt, as he proceeded to divide
the enormous piece of meat into quarters; "he is the youngster
that helped Colonel Preston and his friends from the Wyandots
at the time the block-house was burned."</p>

<p>"How should we hear of it," asked Crumpet with a growl, "when
we was on this side of the Mississippi?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't I over in Kentucky about three years ago? I rather think
I was, and would have been froze to death with Simon Kenton and
a few of the other boys if it hadn't been for this copper-colored
rascal&mdash;ain't that so, Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>And that the young warrior might not err as to the one who was
expected to impart light on the subject, Burt gave him a resounding
whack on the shoulder that almost knocked him off the log. The
youth was in the act of conveying some of the meat to his mouth
when saluted in that fashion, and it came like the shock of an
earthquake.</p>

<p>"Why can't you talk with a fellow," asked Kellogg, "without breaking
his neck?"</p>

<p>"Whose neck is broke?"</p>

<p>"Why that fellow's is pretty well jarred."</p>

<p>"Well, as long as <em>he</em> don't object I don't see what it
is to <em>you</em>," was the good-natured response of Hawkins,
who resumed chewing the juicy meat.</p>

<p>"Some of these days, somebody will give you a whack in return
when you ain't expecting it, and it will be a whack too that will
cure you of that sort of business. I believe, Deerfoot, that you
are a Shawanoe, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a Shawanoe," was the answer, his jaws at work on
the food just furnished him.</p>

<p>"I've heard tell of you; you're the chap that always uses a bow
and arrow instead of a gun?"</p>

<p>The youth answered the query by a nod of the head. As he did
so, Tom Crumpet, who sat further away, vigorously working his
jaws, uttered a contemptuous grunt. Kit turned his head and looked
inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Maybe you think he can't use the bow and arrow. I s'pose, Deerfoot,
that's the bow you fired the arrow through the window of the block-house
that was nigh a hundred yards off, with a letter tied around it,
and fired it agin out on the flatboat with another piece of paper
twisted around it&mdash;isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Despite his loose-jointed sentences, Deerfoot caught his meaning
well enough to nod his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Did you see it done?" asked Crumpet, with a grin at Hawkins.</p>

<p>"How could I see it when I wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"I guess no one else was there," growled Tom; "I've noticed whenever
that sort of business is going on it's always a good ways off,
and the people as sees it are the kind that don't amount to much
in the way of telling the truth."</p>

<p>These were irritating words, made more so by the contemptuous
manner in which they were spoken. Deerfoot clearly understood
their meaning, but he showed no offence because of them. He was
not vain of his wonderful skill in woodcraft, and, though he had
a fiery temper, which sometimes flashed to the surface, he could
not be disturbed by any slurs upon his attainments.</p>

<p>Kit Kellogg was impatient with his companion, but he knew him
so well that he did not discuss the matter. Had not the beard
of Burt Hawkins hidden his countenance, the others would have
perceived the flush which overspread it. He was angered, and said,
hotly:</p>

<p>"It might do for some folks to say that other folks didn't tell
the truth, but I don't think <em>you're</em> the one to say it."</p>

<p>Crumpet champed his meat in silence, using his hunting knife
for fork and knife, and drinking water from the tin cup which
he had filled a short distance away, and from which the others,
excepting Deerfoot, also drank. Instead of answering the slur
of Hawkins, he acted as though he did not fully catch his meaning,
and did not care to learn. What he had said, however, rankled
in the heart of Burt, who, holding his peace until all were through
eating, addressed the surly fellow:</p>

<p>"If you doubt the skill of Deerfoot, I'll make you a wager that
he can outshoot you, you using your gun and he his bow and arrow,
or you can both use a gun."</p>

<p>"He might do all that," said Kellogg, with a twinkle of the eye,
"and it wouldn't prove that Tom was any sort of a marksman."</p>

<p>Crumpet was able to catch the meaning of that remark, and it
goaded him almost to the striking point.</p>
