<p> For, after all, a gale of wind, the thing of mighty sound, is
inarticulate.  It is man who, in a chance phrase, interprets the
elemental passion of his enemy.  Thus there is another gale in
my memory, a thing of endless, deep, humming roar, moonlight,
and a spoken sentence.</p>

<p>It was off that other cape which is always deprived of its title
as the Cape of Good Hope is robbed of its name.  It was off the
Horn.  For a true expression of dishevelled wildness there is
nothing like a gale in the bright moonlight of a high latitude.</p>

<p>The ship, brought-to and bowing to enormous flashing seas, glistened
wet from deck to trucks; her one set sail stood out a coal-black
shape upon the gloomy blueness of the air.  I was a youngster
then, and suffering from weariness, cold, and imperfect oilskins
which let water in at every seam.  I craved human companionship,
and, coming off the poop, took my place by the side of the boatswain
(a man whom I did not like) in a comparatively dry spot where
at worst we had water only up to our knees. Above our heads the
explosive booming gusts of wind passed continuously, justifying
the sailor’s saying "It blows great guns."  And just from that
need of human companionship, being very close to the man, I said,
or rather shouted:</p>

<p>"Blows very hard, boatswain."</p>

<p>His answer was:</p>

<p>"Ay, and if it blows only a little harder things will begin to
go.  I don’t mind as long as everything holds, but when things
begin to go it’s bad."</p>

<p>The note of dread in the shouting voice, the practical truth
of these words, heard years ago from a man I did not like, have
stamped its peculiar character on that gale.</p>

<p>A look in the eyes of a shipmate, a low murmur in the most sheltered
spot where the watch on duty are huddled together, a meaning moan
from one to the other with a glance at the windward sky, a sigh
of weariness, a gesture of disgust passing into the keeping of
the great wind, become part and parcel of the gale.  The olive
hue of hurricane clouds presents an aspect peculiarly appalling. 
The inky ragged wrack, flying before a nor’-west wind, makes you
dizzy with its headlong speed that depicts the rush of the invisible
air.  A hard sou’-wester startles you with its close horizon and
its low gray sky, as if the world were a dungeon wherein there
is no rest for body or soul.  And there are black squalls, white
squalls, thunder squalls, and unexpected gusts that come without
a single sign in the sky; and of each kind no one of them resembles
another.</p>

<p>There is infinite variety in the gales of wind at sea, and except
for the peculiar, terrible, and mysterious moaning that may be
heard sometimes passing through the roar of a hurricane—except
for that unforgettable sound, as if the soul of the universe had
been goaded into a mournful groan—it is, after all, the human
voice that stamps the mark of human consciousness upon the character
of a gale.</p>
