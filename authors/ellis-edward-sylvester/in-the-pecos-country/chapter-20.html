<p>A more astounding surprise than before awaited the lad. His hair
almost lifted itself as he found himself staring at vacancy, with
no sign of a living person in sight. Whatever had been the cause
of this mysterious performance, it was very apparent that the
solution rested not with the young fugitive.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of this," he exclaimed, impatiently, after he had
waited several minutes, "and it is n't going to be played on me
again."</p>

<p>With this, he began clambering up out of the ravine, with the
resolve to reach some place where no shadowy horseman could ride
over him.</p>

<p>The climbing was difficult at first, but he soon reached a point
where the inclination was not so steep, and where he could progress
with much more ease and facility. In this way he in time reached
the upper level, and, believing himself out of range of his phantom
pursuer, had time to look about for some sleeping-place for the
night.</p>

<p>He frequently paused and listened, but could not see or hear
anything of man or beast, and, confident that no danger was to
be apprehended from either, he devoted himself to hunting for
some refuge, that he could consider secure against molestation.
His first inclination was to seek out a place among the rocks,
as he was likely to gain room where he could stretch out at his
ease and enjoy a few hours' slumber, but, on reflection, there
were several objections to this.</p>

<p>In that part of the world were an abundance of poisonous serpents,
and he had a natural dread of disturbing some of them.</p>

<p>"If I can find the right kind of tree, I think that will be the
best sort of a place, for nothing could get at me there, and there
may be all the limbs I want to make a bed. I guess there's the
location now."</p>

<p>He was walking along all the time that he had been thinking and
talking, and, at this juncture, he approached a straggling group
of trees, which seemed likely to offer the very refuge he was
seeking. He made his way toward them with quickened steps.</p>

<p>Fred found himself upon a sort of plateau, broken here and there
by rocks, boulders, and irregularities of surface, but in the
main easy to be traversed, and he lost no time in making a survey
of the grove which had caught his eye. There were some twenty
in all, and several of them offered the very shelter. The limbs
were no more than six or eight feet above the ground, and the
largest trees were fifty feet in height, the branches appearing
dense, and capable, apparently, of affording as firm a support
as anyone could need while asleep.</p>

<p>"I guess that will do," he concluded, after surveying the largest,
which happened to stand on the outer edge of the grove. "If I
can get the bed, there ain't any danger of being bothered by snakes
and wild animals."</p>

<p>Fred naturally pondered a moment as to the best means of climbing
into the tree with his gun. It was full size, and of such weight
that he had been considerably wearied in carrying it such a distance,
but it contained a precious charge, to be used in some emergency
that was likely to arise, and no man was wealthy enough to buy
it from him. The way that he decided upon was to leave the gun
against the trunk of the tree, and then climb in the way that
comes natural to a boy. The barrel of course, would bother him
a little, but he could pull through very well, and he immediately
set about doing so.</p>

<p>As he expected, the gun got in his way, but he managed it very
well, without knocking it down, and in a few minutes had climbed
high enough to grasp the first limb with one hand, which was all
that he desired, as he could easily draw himself up in that fashion.</p>

<p>Fred had just made his grasp certain, when he heard a peculiar
yelp, and a rush of something by him.</p>

<p>Not knowing what it meant, but apprehending some new danger,
he drew himself upon the limb with a spasmodic effort, and then
turned to see what it meant. To his amazement and terror, he discovered
that it was an immense wolf, which had made a snap at and narrowly
missed his heels. It had come like a shadow, making no announcement
of its presence, and a second or two sooner would have brought
the two into collision.</p>

<p>As Fred looked downward the wolf looked upward, and the two glared
at each other for a minute or so, as if they meant to stare each
other out of countenance. The wolf was unusually large, belonging
to what is known as the mountain species, and he seemed capable
of leaping up among the limbs without any extra effort; but wolves
are not addicted to climbing trees, and the one in question seemed
to content himself with looking up and meditating upon the situation.
It seemed to the lad that he was saying:</p>

<p>"Well, young man, you're up there out of my reach, but I can
afford to wait; you'll have to come down pretty soon."</p>

<p>"If I only had some powder and ball," reflected Fred, "I'd soon
wipe you out."</p>

<p>The temptation was very strong to spend the last bullet upon
him, but he could not fail to see the absurdity of the thing;
besides which, his gun was seated upon the ground, with the muzzle
pointed upward at him. He could reach it from his perch on the
lowermost limb, but it was hardly safe to attempt it while his
enemy was seated there upon his haunches, as if debating whether
he should go up or not.</p>

<p>The boy was in terror lest the brute should strike the piece
and knock it down, in which case it was likely to be discharged
and to be placed altogether beyond his reach. But the dreaded
creature sat as motionless as if he were a carved statue in front
of some gentleman's residence, his eyes fixed upon his supper,
which had escaped him by such a narrow chance. The situation was
about as interesting as it could well be, and, in fact, it was
rather too interesting for Fred, who was alarmed at the prospect
of being besieged by a mountain wolf.</p>

<p>After the lapse of a minute or two, the brute quietly rose from
his haunches, trotted a few paces, and then gave utterance to
the dismal wail peculiar to his species. It had a baying, howling
tone, which made the chills creep over the boy from head to foot.
He had heard the barking and howling of wolves when crossing the
prairies, but there was deep, thunderous bass to the one which
now struck upon his ear such as he had never before heard, and
which gave it a significance that was like a voice from the tomb.</p>

<p>The instant the brute left his station, Fred reached down, seized
the muzzle of his gun, and drew it up. Then he made his way some
twenty feet above, where he could feel secure against any daring
leap from his foe. He had scarcely perched himself in this position,
when the bay of the wolf was answered from fully a dozen different
directions.</p>

<p>He had called to his comrades, and their replies came from every
point of the compass&mdash;the same rumbling, hoarse, wailing howls
that had notified them where a prize awaited them. A minute later,
the brute trotted back to his place, where he sat down until the
arrival of reinforcements.</p>

<p>"It isn't one wolf, but a hundred, that going to besiege me!"
gasped the terrified boy.</p>

<p>He spoke the truth.</p>
