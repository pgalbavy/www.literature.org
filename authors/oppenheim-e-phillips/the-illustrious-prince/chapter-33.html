<P>
The Prince, still fully attired, save that in place of his dress
coat he wore a loose smoking jacket, stood at the windows of his
sitting room at Devenham Castle, looking across the park. In the
somewhat fitful moonlight the trees had taken to themselves
grotesque shapes. Away in the distance the glimmer of the sea
shone like a thin belt of quicksilver. The stable clock had
struck two. The whole place seemed at rest. Only one light was
gleaming from a long low building which had been added to the
coach houses of recent years for a motor garage. That one light,
the Prince knew, was on his account. There his chauffeur waited,
untiring and sleepless, with his car always ready for that last
rush to the coast, the advisability of which the Prince had
considered more than once during the last twenty-four hours. The
excitement of the evening, the excitement of his unwonted
outburst, was still troubling him. It was not often that he had
so far overstepped the bounds which his natural caution, his
ever-present self-restraint, imposed upon him. He paced
restlessly to and fro from the sitting room to the bedroom and
back again. He had told the truth,--the bare, simple truth. He
had seen the letters of fire in the sky, and he had read them to
these people because of their kindness, because of a certain
affection which he bore them. To them it must have sounded like a
man speaking in a strange tongue. They had not understood.
Perhaps, even, they would not believe in the absolute sincerity
of his motives. Again he paused at the window and looked over the
park to that narrow, glittering stretch of sea. Why should he not
for once forget the traditions of his race, the pride which kept
him there to face the end! There was still time. The cruiser
which the emperor had sent was waiting for him in Southampton
Harbor. In twenty-four hours he would be in foreign waters. He
thought of these things earnestly, even wistfully, and yet he
knew that he could not go. Perhaps they would be glad of an
opportunity of getting rid of him now that he had spoken his
mind. In any case, right was on their side. The end, if it must
come, was simple enough!
<P>
He turned away from the window with a little shrug of the
shoulders. Even as he did so, there came a faint knocking at the
door. His servant had already retired. For a moment it seemed to
him that it could mean but one thing. While he hesitated, the
handle was softly turned and the door opened. To his amazement,
it was Penelope who stood upon the threshold.
<P>
"Miss Morse!" he exclaimed breathlessly.
<P>
She held out her hand as though to bid him remain silent. For
several seconds she seemed to be listening. Then very softly she
closed the door behind her.
<P>
"Miss Penelope," he cried softly, "you must not come in here!
Please!"
<P>
She ignored his outstretched hand, advancing a little further
into the room. There was tragedy in her white face. She seemed to
be shaking in every limb, but not with nervousness. Directly he
looked into her eyes, he knew very well that the thing was close
at hand!
<P>
"Listen!" she whispered. "I had to come! You don't know what is
going on! For the last half hour the telephone has been ringing
continuously. It is about you! The Home Office has been ringing
up to speak to the Prime Minister. The Chief Inspector of
Scotland Yard has been to see them. One of their detectives has
collected evidence which justifies them in issuing a warrant for
your arrest."
<P>
"For my arrest," the Prince repeated.
<P>
"Don't you understand?" she continued breathlessly. "Don't you
see how horrible it is? They mean to arrest you for the murder of
Hamilton Fynes and Dicky Vanderpole!"
<P>
"If this must be so," the Prince answered, "why do they not come?
I am here."
<P>
"But you must not stay here!" she exclaimed. "You must escape! It
is too terrible to think that you should--oh, I can't say
it!--that you should have to face these charges. If you are
guilty, well, Heaven help you!--If you are guilty, I want you to
escape all the same!"
<P>
He looked at her with the puzzled air of one who tries to reason
with a child.
<P>
"Dear Miss Penelope," he said, "This is kind of you, but, after
all, remember that I am a man, and I must not run away."
<P>
"But you cannot meet these charges!" she interrupted. "You cannot
meet them! You know it! Oh, don't think I can't appreciate your
point of view! If you killed those men, you killed them to obtain
papers which you believed were necessary for the welfare of your
country. Oh, it is not I who judge you! You did not do it, I
know, for your own gain. You did it because you are, heart and
soul, a patriot. But here, alas! they do not understand. Their
whole standpoint is different. They will judge you as they would
a common criminal. You must fly,--you must, indeed!"
<P>
"Dear Miss Penelope," he said, "I cannot do that! I cannot run
away like a thief in the dark. If this thing is to come, it must
come."
<P>
"But you don't understand!" she continued, wringing her hands.
"You think because you are a great prince and a prince of a
friendly nation that the law will treat you differently. It will
not! They have talked of it downstairs. You are not formally
attached to any one in this country. You are not even upon the
staff of the Embassy. You are here on a private mission as a
private person, and there is no way in which the Government can
intervene, even if it would. You are subject to its laws and you
have broken them. For Heaven's sake, fly! You have your motor car
here. Let your man drive you to Southampton and get on board the
Japanese cruiser. You mustn't wait a single moment. I believe
that tomorrow morning will be too late!"
<P>
He took her hands in his very tenderly and yet with something of
reverence in his gesture. He looked into her eyes and he spoke
very earnestly. Every word seemed to come from his heart.
<P>
"Dear Miss Penelope," he said, "it is very, very kind of you to
have come here and warned me. Only you cannot quite understand
what this thing means to me. Remember what I told you once. Life
and death to your people in this country seem to be the greatest
things which the mind of man can hold. It is not so with us. We
are brought up differently. In a worthy cause a true Japanese is
ready to take death by the hand at any moment. So it is with me
now. I have no regret. Even if I had, even if life were a garden
of roses for me, what is ordained must come. A little sooner or a
little later, it makes no matter.
<P>
She sank on her knees before him.
<P>
"Can't you understand why I am here?" she cried passionately. "It
was I who told of the silken cord and knife!"
<P>
He was wholly unmoved. He even smiled, as though the thing were
of no moment.
<P>
"It was right that you should do so," he declared. "You must not
reproach yourself with that."
<P>
"But I do! I do!" she cried again. "I always shall! Don't you
understand that if you stay here they will treat you--"
<P>
He interrupted, laying his hand gently upon her shoulder.
<P>
"Dear young lady," he said, "you need never fear that I shall
wait for the touch of your men of law. Death is too easily won
for that. If the end which you have spoken of comes, there is
another way--another house of rest which I can reach."
<P>
She rose slowly to her feet. The absolute serenity of his manner
bespoke an impregnability of purpose before which the words died
away on her lips. She realized that she might as well plead with
the dead!
<P>
"You do not mind," he whispered, "if I tell you that you must not
stay here any longer?"
<P>
He led her toward the door. Upon the threshold he took her cold
fingers into his hand and kissed them reverently.
<P>
"Do not be too despondent," he said. "I have a star somewhere
which burns for me. Tonight I have been looking for it. It is
there still," he added, pointing to the wide open window. "It is
there, undimmed, clearer and brighter than ever. I have no fear."
<P>
She passed away without looking up again. The Prince listened to
her footsteps dying away in the corridor. Then he closed the
door, and, entering his bedroom, undressed himself and slept . .
.
<P>
When Prince Maiyo awoke on the following morning, the sunshine
was streaming into the room, and his grave-faced valet was
standing over his bed.
<P>
"His Highness' bath is ready," he announced.
<P>
The Prince dressed quickly and was first in the pleasant morning
room, with its open windows leading on to the terrace. He
strolled outside and wandered amongst the flower beds. Here he
was found, soon afterwards, by the Duke's valet.
<P>
"Your Highness," the latter said, "His Grace has sent me to look
for you. He would be glad if you could spare him a moment or two
in the library."
<P>
The Prince followed the man to the room where his host was
waiting for him. The Duke, with his hands behind his back, was
pacing restlessly up and down the apartment.
<P>
"Good morning, Duke," the Prince said cheerfully. "Another of
your wonderful spring mornings. Upon the terrace the sun is
almost hot. Soon I shall begin to fancy that the perfume of your
spring flowers is the perfume of almond and cherry blossom."
<P>
"Prince," the Duke said quietly, "I have sent for you as your
host. I speak to you now unofficially, as an Englishman to his
guest. I have been besieged through the night, and even this
morning, with incomprehensible messages which come to me from
those who administer the law in this country. Prince, I want you
to remember that however effete you may find us as a nation from
your somewhat romantic point of view, we have at least realized
the highest ideals any nation has ever conceived in the
administration of the law. Nobleman and pauper here are judged
alike. If their crime is the same, their punishment is the same.
There is no man in this country who is strong enough to arrest
the hand of justice."
<P>
The Prince bowed.
<P>
"My dear Duke," he said, "it has given me very much pleasure, in
the course of my investigations, to realize the truth of what you
have just said. I agree with you entirely. You could teach us in
Japan a great lesson on the fearless administration of the law.
Now in some other countries--"
<P>
"Never mind those other countries," the Duke interrupted gravely.
"I did not send for you to enter into an academic discussion. I
want you clearly to understand how I am placed, supposing a
distinguished member of my household--supposing even you, Prince
Maiyo--were to come within the arm of the law. Even the great
claims of hospitality would leave me powerless."
<P>
"This," the Prince admitted, "I fully apprehend. It is surely
reasonable that the stranger in your country should be subject to
your laws."
<P>
"Very well, then," the Duke continued. "Listen to me, Prince.
This morning a London magistrate will grant what is called a
search warrant which will enable the police to search, from attic
to cellar, your house in St. James' Square. An Inspector from
Scotland Yard will be there this afternoon awaiting your return,
and he believes that he has witnesses who will be able to
identify you as one who has broken the laws of this country. I
ask you no questions. There is the telephone on the table. My
eighty-horse-power Daimler is at the door and at your service. I
understand that your cruiser in Southampton Harbor is always
under steam. If there is anything more, in reason, that I can do,
you have only to speak." The Prince shook his head slowly.
<P>
"Duke," he said, "please send away your car, unless it will take
me to London quicker than my own. What I have done I have done,
and for what I have done I will pay."
<P>
The Duke laid his hands upon the young man's shoulders and looked
down into his face. The Duke was over six feet high, and broad in
proportion. Before him the Prince seemed almost like a boy.
<P>
"Maiyo," he said, "we have grown fond of you,--my wife, my
daughter, all of us. We don't want harm to come to you, but there
is the American Ambassador watching all the time. Already he more
than half suspects. For our sakes, Prince,--come, I will say for
the sake of those who are grateful to you for your candor and
truthfulness, for the lessons you have tried to teach us,--make
use of my car. You will reach Southampton in half an hour."
<P>
The Prince shook his head. His lips had parted in what was
certainly a smile. At the corners they quivered, a little
tremulous.
<P>
"My dear friend," he said, and his voice had softened almost to
affection, "you do not quite understand. You look upon the things
which may come from your point of view and not from mine.
Remember that, to your philosophy, life itself is the greatest
thing born into the world. To us it is the least. If you would do
me a service, please see that I am able to start for London in
half an hour."
