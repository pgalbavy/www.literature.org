<P>
When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the
Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival.
The little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed,
and looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting
up on his bench and yawning.  So the Wizard went in to him.
<P>
"Zeb," said he, "my balloon is of no further use in this strange
country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell.  But
in the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me.  I
wish you would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of
kerosene oil that is under the seat.  There is nothing else that I
care about."
<P>
So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had
returned Dorothy was awake.  Then the three held a counsel to decide
what they should do next, but could think of no way to better
their condition.
<P>
"I don't like these veg'table people," said the little girl.  "They're
cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness."
<P>
"I agree with you.  It is because there is no warm blood in them,"
remarked the Wizard.
<P>
"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even
themselves," declared the boy.
<P>
"The Princess is lovely to look at," continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;
"but I don't care much for her, after all.  If there was any other
place to go, I'd like to go there."
<P>
"But IS there any other place?" asked the Wizard.
<P>
"I don't know," she answered.
<P>
Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,
and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess
and a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.
<P>
So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to them:
<P>
"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we
have decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and
must not remain here."
<P>
"How can we go away?" asked Dorothy.
<P>
"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed," was
the answer.
<P>
"In what way?" enquired the Wizard.
<P>
"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining
Vines," said the Princess, "and they will soon crush you and devour
your bodies to make themselves grow bigger.  The animals you have with
you we will drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit.  Then
our country will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors."
<P>
"But you are in need of a Sorcerer," said the Wizard, "and not one of
those growing is yet ripe enough to pick.  I am greater than any
thorn-covered sorcerer that every grew in your garden.  Why destroy me?"
<P>
"It is true we need a Sorcerer," acknowledged the Princess, "but I am
informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to
take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him
to be planted.  Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able
to perform.  Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others
or not."
<P>
At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of
producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again.  He
did it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange
piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person
could be.  But afterward she said:
<P>
"I have heard of this wonderful magic.  But it accomplishes nothing of
value.  What else can you do?"
<P>
The Wizard tried to think.  Then he jointed together the blades of his
sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose.  But
even that did not satisfy the Princess.
<P>
Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil
which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever
idea from those commonplace things.
<P>
"Your Highness," said he, "I will now proceed to prove my magic by
creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit
a Destroyer much more dreadful that your Clinging Vines."
<P>
So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other
and set a lantern upon each of their heads.
<P>
"Don't laugh," he whispered to them, "or you will spoil the effect of
my magic."
<P>
Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his
wrinkled face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two
lanterns. The glare they made was very small when compared with the
radiance of the six great colored suns; but still they gleamed
steadily and clearly.  The Mangaboos were much impressed because
they had never before seen any light that did not come directly
from their suns.
<P>
Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,
where it covered quite a broad surface.  When he lighted the oil a hundred
tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.
<P>
"Now, Princess," exclaimed the Wizard, "those of your advisors who
wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within
this circle of light.  If they advised you well, and were in the
right, they will not be injured in any way.  But if any advised you
wrongly, the light will wither him."
<P>
The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded
them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were
scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that
of baked potatoes.  Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be
dragged from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be
necessary to plant them at once.
<P>
"Sir," said the Princess to the Wizard, "you are greater than any Sorcerer
we have ever known.  As it is evident that my people have advised me
wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful Garden of
the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the Black Pit
in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them around."
<P>
The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself
that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had
gone both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the
Black Pit, and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to
save them from such a fate.
<P>
For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between
sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends
were not disturbed in any way.  They were even permitted to occupy the
House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to
wander in the gardens in search of food.
<P>
Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and
walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest.
They saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing
and twisting around like a nest of great snakes.  Everything the vines
touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have
escaped being cast among them.
<P>
Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets
from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to
amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his
glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom
part of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka
could.  They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to
where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.
<P>
The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches
and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.
<P>
"Don't be rough!" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the
round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and
enjoyed the sport very greatly.
<P>
Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,
solemn-eyed Mangaboos.  Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch
covered with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the
horse, the kitten and the piglets.
<P>
"Here--stop this foolishness!" Jim roared, angrily; but after being
pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the
way of the thorns.
<P>
The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to
the doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they
were driven from the room and out upon the street.  Here were more of
the vegetable people with thorns,and silently they urged the now
frightened creatures down the street.  Jim had to be careful not to
step upon the tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and
squealing, while Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed
toward her, also tried to protect the pretty little things from
injury.  Slowly but steadily the heartless Mangaboos drove them on,
until they had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the
broad plains leading to the mountain.
<P>
"What does all this mean, anyhow?" asked the horse, jumping to escape
a thorn.
<P>
"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they
threatened to cast us," replied the kitten.  "If I were as big as you
are, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!"
<P>
"What would you do?" enquired Jim.
<P>
"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs."
<P>
"All right," said the horse; "I'll do it."
<P>
An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and
kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could.  A dozen of them smashed
together and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked
again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in
all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron
heels.  Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and
scratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many
vegetable complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they
did the horse.
<P>
But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long.  They tired Jim
and Eureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered
with mashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up
at last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.
