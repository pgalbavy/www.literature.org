<P>Whilst the burghers of the Hague were tearing in pieces the 
bodies of John and Cornelius de Witt, and whilst William of 
Orange, after having made sure that his two antagonists were 
really dead, was galloping over the Leyden road, followed by 
Captain van Deken, whom he found a little too compassionate 
to honour him any longer with his confidence, Craeke, the 
faithful servant, mounted on a good horse, and little 
suspecting what terrible events had taken place since his 
departure, proceeded along the high road lined with trees, 
until he was clear of the town and the neighbouring 
villages.</P>
<P>Being once safe, he left his horse at a livery stable in 
order not to arouse suspicion, and tranquilly continued his 
journey on the canal-boats, which conveyed him by easy 
stages to Dort, pursuing their way under skilful guidance by 
the shortest possible routes through the windings of the 
river, which held in its watery embrace so many enchanting 
little islands, edged with willows and rushes, and abounding 
in luxurious vegetation, whereon flocks of fat sheep browsed 
in peaceful sleepiness. Craeke from afar off recognised 
Dort, the smiling city, at the foot of a hill dotted with 
windmills. He saw the fine red brick houses, mortared in 
white lines, standing on the edge of the water, and their 
balconies, open towards the river, decked out with silk 
tapestry embroidered with gold flowers, the wonderful 
manufacture of India and China; and near these brilliant 
stuffs, large lines set to catch the voracious eels, which 
are attracted towards the houses by the garbage thrown every 
day from the kitchens into the river.</P>
<P>Craeke, standing on the deck of the boat, saw, across the 
moving sails of the windmills, on the slope of the hill, the 
red and pink house which was the goal of his errand. The 
outlines of its roof were merging in the yellow foliage of a 
curtain of poplar trees, the whole habitation having for 
background a dark grove of gigantic elms. The mansion was 
situated in such a way that the sun, falling on it as into a 
funnel, dried up, warmed, and fertilised the mist which the 
verdant screen could not prevent the river wind from 
carrying there every morning and evening.</P>
<P>Having disembarked unobserved amid the usual bustle of the 
city, Craeke at once directed his steps towards the house 
which we have just described, and which  -  white, trim, and 
tidy, even more cleanly scoured and more carefully waxed in 
the hidden corners than in the places which were exposed to 
view  -  enclosed a truly happy mortal.</P>
<P>This happy mortal, rara avis, was Dr. van Baerle, the godson 
of Cornelius de Witt. He had inhabited the same house ever 
since his childhood, for it was the house in which his 
father and grandfather, old established princely merchants 
of the princely city of Dort, were born.</P>
<P>Mynheer van Baerle the father had amassed in the Indian 
trade three or four hundred thousand guilders, which Mynheer 
van Baerle the son, at the death of his dear and worthy 
parents, found still quite new, although one set of them 
bore the date of coinage of 1640, and the other that of 
1610, a fact which proved that they were guilders of Van 
Baerle the father and of Van Baerle the grandfather; but we 
will inform the reader at once that these three or four 
hundred thousand guilders were only the pocket money, or 
sort of purse, for Cornelius van Baerle, the hero of this 
story, as his landed property in the province yielded him an 
income of about ten thousand guilders a year.</P>
<P>When the worthy citizen, the father of Cornelius, passed 
from time into eternity, three months after having buried 
his wife, who seemed to have departed first to smooth for 
him the path of death as she had smoothed for him the path 
of life, he said to his son, as he embraced him for the last 
time,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Eat, drink, and spend your money, if you wish to know what 
life really is, for as to toiling from morn to evening on a 
wooden stool, or a leathern chair, in a counting-house or a 
laboratory, that certainly is not living. Your time to die 
will also come; and if you are not then so fortunate as to 
have a son, you will let my name grow extinct, and my 
guilders, which no one has ever fingered but my father, 
myself, and the coiner, will have the surprise of passing to 
an unknown master. And least of all, imitate the example of 
your godfather, Cornelius de Witt, who has plunged into 
politics, the most ungrateful of all careers, and who will 
certainly come to an untimely end.&quot;</P>
<P>Having given utterance to this paternal advice, the worthy 
Mynheer van Baerle died, to the intense grief of his son 
Cornelius, who cared very little for the guilders, and very 
much for his father.</P>
<P>Cornelius then remained alone in his large house. In vain 
his godfather offered to him a place in the public service, 
 -  in vain did he try to give him a taste for glory,  -  
although Cornelius, to gratify his godfather, did embark 
with De Ruyter upon &quot;The Seven Provinces,&quot; the flagship of a 
fleet of one hundred and thirty-nine sail, with which the 
famous admiral set out to contend singlehanded against the 
combined forces of France and England. When, guided by the 
pilot Leger, he had come within musket-shot of the &quot;Prince,&quot; 
with the Duke of York (the English king's brother) aboard, 
upon which De Ruyter, his mentor, made so sharp and well 
directed an attack that the Duke, perceiving that his vessel 
would soon have to strike, made the best of his way aboard 
the &quot;Saint Michael&quot;; when he had seen the &quot;Saint Michael,&quot; 
riddled and shattered by the Dutch broadside, drift out of 
the line; when he had witnessed the sinking of the &quot;Earl of 
Sandwich,&quot; and the death by fire or drowning of four hundred 
sailors; when he realized that the result of all this 
destruction  -  after twenty ships had been blown to pieces, 
three thousand men killed and five thousand injured  -  was 
that nothing was decided, that both sides claimed the 
victory, that the fighting would soon begin again, and that 
just one more name, that of Southwold Bay, had been added to 
the list of battles; when he had estimated how much time is 
lost simply in shutting his eyes and ears by a man who likes 
to use his reflective powers even while his fellow creatures 
are cannonading one another;  -  Cornelius bade farewell to 
De Ruyter, to the Ruart de Pulten, and to glory, kissed the 
knees of the Grand Pensionary, for whom he entertained the 
deepest veneration, and retired to his house at Dort, rich 
in his well-earned repose, his twenty-eight years, an iron 
constitution and keen perceptions, and his capital of more 
than four hundred thousands of florins and income of ten 
thousand, convinced that a man is always endowed by Heaven 
with too much for his own happiness, and just enough to make 
him miserable.</P>
<P>Consequently, and to indulge his own idea of happiness, 
Cornelius began to be interested in the study of plants and 
insects, collected and classified the Flora of all the Dutch 
islands, arranged the whole entomology of the province, on 
which he wrote a treatise, with plates drawn by his own 
hands; and at last, being at a loss what to do with his 
time, and especially with his money, which went on 
accumulating at a most alarming rate, he took it into his 
head to select for himself, from all the follies of his 
country and of his age, one of the most elegant and 
expensive,  -  he became a tulip-fancier.</P>
<P>It was the time when the Dutch and the Portuguese, rivalling 
each other in this branch of horticulture, had begun to 
worship that flower, and to make more of a cult of it than 
ever naturalists dared to make of the human race for fear of 
arousing the jealousy of God.</P>
<P>Soon people from Dort to Mons began to talk of Mynheer van 
Baerle's tulips; and his beds, pits, drying-rooms, and 
drawers of bulbs were visited, as the galleries and 
libraries of Alexandria were by illustrious Roman 
travellers.</P>
<P>Van Baerle began by expending his yearly revenue in laying 
the groundwork of his collection, after which he broke in 
upon his new guilders to bring it to perfection. His 
exertions, indeed, were crowned with a most magnificent 
result: he produced three new tulips, which he called the 
&quot;Jane,&quot; after his mother; the &quot;Van Baerle,&quot; after his 
father; and the &quot;Cornelius,&quot; after his godfather; the other 
names have escaped us, but the fanciers will be sure to find 
them in the catalogues of the times.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1672, Cornelius de Witt came to 
Dort for three months, to live at his old family mansion; 
for not only was he born in that city, but his family had 
been resident there for centuries.</P>
<P>Cornelius, at that period, as William of Orange said, began 
to enjoy the most perfect unpopularity. To his fellow 
citizens, the good burghers of Dort, however, he did not 
appear in the light of a criminal who deserved to be hung. 
It is true, they did not particularly like his somewhat 
austere republicanism, but they were proud of his valour; 
and when he made his entrance into their town, the cup of 
honour was offered to him, readily enough, in the name of 
the city.</P>
<P>After having thanked his fellow citizens, Cornelius 
proceeded to his old paternal house, and gave directions for 
some repairs, which he wished to have executed before the 
arrival of his wife and children; and thence he wended his 
way to the house of his godson, who perhaps was the only 
person in Dort as yet unacquainted with the presence of 
Cornelius in the town.</P>
<P>In the same degree as Cornelius de Witt had excited the 
hatred of the people by sowing those evil seeds which are 
called political passions, Van Baerle had gained the 
affections of his fellow citizens by completely shunning the 
pursuit of politics, absorbed as he was in the peaceful 
pursuit of cultivating tulips.</P>
<P>Van Baerle was truly beloved by his servants and labourers; 
nor had he any conception that there was in this world a man 
who wished ill to another.</P>
<P>And yet it must be said, to the disgrace of mankind, that 
Cornelius van Baerle, without being aware of the fact, had a 
much more ferocious, fierce, and implacable enemy than the 
Grand Pensionary and his brother had among the Orange party, 
who were most hostile to the devoted brothers, who had never 
been sundered by the least misunderstanding during their 
lives, and by their mutual devotion in the face of death 
made sure the existence of their brotherly affection beyond 
the grave.</P>
<P>At the time when Cornelius van Baerle began to devote 
himself to tulip-growing, expending on this hobby his yearly 
revenue and the guilders of his father, there was at Dort, 
living next door to him, a citizen of the name of Isaac 
Boxtel who from the age when he was able to think for 
himself had indulged the same fancy, and who was in 
ecstasies at the mere mention of the word &quot;tulban,&quot; which 
(as we are assured by the &quot;Floriste Francaise,&quot; the most 
highly considered authority in matters relating to this 
flower) is the first word in the Cingalese tongue which was 
ever used to designate that masterpiece of floriculture 
which is now called the tulip.</P>
<P>Boxtel had not the good fortune of being rich, like Van 
Baerle. He had therefore, with great care and patience, and 
by dint of strenuous exertions, laid out near his house at 
Dort a garden fit for the culture of his cherished flower; 
he had mixed the soil according to the most approved 
prescriptions, and given to his hotbeds just as much heat 
and fresh air as the strictest rules of horticulture exact.</P>
<P>Isaac knew the temperature of his frames to the twentieth 
part of a degree. He knew the strength of the current of 
air, and tempered it so as to adapt it to the wave of the 
stems of his flowers. His productions also began to meet 
with the favour of the public. They were beautiful, nay, 
distinguished. Several fanciers had come to see Boxtel's 
tulips. At last he had even started amongst all the 
Linnaeuses and Tourneforts a tulip which bore his name, and 
which, after having travelled all through France, had found 
its way into Spain, and penetrated as far as Portugal; and 
the King, Don Alfonso VI.  -  who, being expelled from 
Lisbon, had retired to the island of Terceira, where he 
amused himself, not, like the great Conde, with watering his 
carnations, but with growing tulips  -  had, on seeing the 
Boxtel tulip, exclaimed, &quot;Not so bad, by any means!&quot;</P>
<P>All at once, Cornelius van Baerle, who, after all his 
learned pursuits, had been seized with the tulipomania, made 
some changes in his house at Dort, which, as we have stated, 
was next door to that of Boxtel. He raised a certain 
building in his court-yard by a story, which shutting out 
the sun, took half a degree of warmth from Boxtel's garden, 
and, on the other hand, added half a degree of cold in 
winter; not to mention that it cut the wind, and disturbed 
all the horticultural calculations and arrangements of his 
neighbour.</P>
<P>After all, this mishap appeared to Boxtel of no great 
consequence. Van Baerle was but a painter, a sort of fool 
who tried to reproduce and disfigure on canvas the wonders 
of nature. The painter, he thought, had raised his studio by 
a story to get better light, and thus far he had only been 
in the right. Mynheer van Baerle was a painter, as Mynheer 
Boxtel was a tulip-grower; he wanted somewhat more sun for 
his paintings, and he took half a degree from his 
neighbour's tulips.</P>
<P>The law was for Van Baerle, and Boxtel had to abide by it.</P>
<P>Besides, Isaac had made the discovery that too much sun was 
injurious to tulips, and that this flower grew quicker, and 
had a better colouring, with the temperate warmth of 
morning, than with the powerful heat of the midday sun. He 
therefore felt almost grateful to Cornelius van Baerle for 
having given him a screen gratis.</P>
<P>Maybe this was not quite in accordance with the true state 
of things in general, and of Isaac Boxtel's feelings in 
particular. It is certainly astonishing what rich comfort 
great minds, in the midst of momentous catastrophes, will 
derive from the consolations of philosophy.</P>
<P>But alas! What was the agony of the unfortunate Boxtel on 
seeing the windows of the new story set out with bulbs and 
seedlings of tulips for the border, and tulips in pots; in 
short, with everything pertaining to the pursuits of a 
tulip-monomaniac!</P>
<P>There were bundles of labels, cupboards, and drawers with 
compartments, and wire guards for the cupboards, to allow 
free access to the air whilst keeping out slugs, mice, 
dormice, and rats, all of them very curious fanciers of 
tulips at two thousand francs a bulb.</P>
<P>Boxtel was quite amazed when he saw all this apparatus, but 
he was not as yet aware of the full extent of his 
misfortune. Van Baerle was known to be fond of everything 
that pleases the eye. He studied Nature in all her aspects 
for the benefit of his paintings, which were as minutely 
finished as those of Gerard Dow, his master, and of Mieris, 
his friend. Was it not possible, that, having to paint the 
interior of a tulip-grower's, he had collected in his new 
studio all the accessories of decoration?</P>
<P>Yet, although thus consoling himself with illusory 
suppositions, Boxtel was not able to resist the burning 
curiosity which was devouring him. In the evening, 
therefore, he placed a ladder against the partition wall 
between their gardens, and, looking into that of his 
neighbour Van Baerle, he convinced himself that the soil of 
a large square bed, which had formerly been occupied by 
different plants, was removed, and the ground disposed in 
beds of loam mixed with river mud (a combination which is 
particularly favourable to the tulip), and the whole 
surrounded by a border of turf to keep the soil in its 
place. Besides this, sufficient shade to temper the noonday 
heat; aspect south-southwest; water in abundant supply, and 
at hand; in short, every requirement to insure not only 
success but also progress. There could not be a doubt that 
Van Baerle had become a tulip-grower.</P>
<P>Boxtel at once pictured to himself this learned man, with a 
capital of four hundred thousand and a yearly income of ten 
thousand guilders, devoting all his intellectual and 
financial resources to the cultivation of the tulip. He 
foresaw his neighbour's success, and he felt such a pang at 
the mere idea of this success that his hands dropped 
powerless, his knees trembled, and he fell in despair from 
the ladder.</P>
<P>And thus it was not for the sake of painted tulips, but for 
real ones, that Van Baerle took from him half a degree of 
warmth. And thus Van Baerle was to have the most admirably 
fitted aspect, and, besides, a large, airy, and well 
ventilated chamber where to preserve his bulbs and 
seedlings; while he, Boxtel, had been obliged to give up for 
this purpose his bedroom, and, lest his sleeping in the same 
apartment might injure his bulbs and seedlings, had taken up 
his abode in a miserable garret.</P>
<P>Boxtel, then, was to have next door to him a rival and 
successful competitor; and his rival, instead of being some 
unknown, obscure gardener, was the godson of Mynheer 
Cornelius de Witt, that is to say, a celebrity.</P>
<P>Boxtel, as the reader may see, was not possessed of the 
spirit of Porus, who, on being conquered by Alexander, 
consoled himself with the celebrity of his conqueror.</P>
<P>And now if Van Baerle produced a new tulip, and named it the 
John de Witt, after having named one the Cornelius? It was 
indeed enough to choke one with rage.</P>
<P>Thus Boxtel, with jealous foreboding, became the prophet of 
his own misfortune. And, after having made this melancholy 
discovery, he passed the most wretched night imaginable. </P></article>
