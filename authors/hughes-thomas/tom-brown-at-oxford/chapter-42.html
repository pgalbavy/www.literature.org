<p>East returned to his regiment in a few days, and at the end of
the month the gallant 101st embarked for India. Tom wrote several
letters to the lieutenant, inclosing notes to Harry, with gleanings
of news from Englebourn, where his escape on the night of the
riot had been a nine-days' wonder; and, now that he was fairly
"'listed," and out of the way, public opinion was beginning to
turn in his favor. In due course a letter arrived from the lieutenant,
dated Cape Town, giving a prosperous account of the voyage so
far. East did not say much about "your convict," as he still insisted
on calling Harry; but the little he did say was very satisfactory,
and Tom sent off this part of the letter to Katie, to whom he
had confided the whole story, entreating her to make the best
use of it in the interest of the young soldier. And, after this
out-of-the-way beginning, he settled down into the usual routine
of his Oxford life.</p>

<p>This change in his opinions and objects of interest brought him
now into more intimate relations with a set of whom he had, as
yet, seen little. For want of a better name, we may call them
"the party of progress." At their parties, instead of practical
jokes, and boisterous mirth, and talk of boats, and bats, and
guns, and horses, the highest and deepest questions of morals,
and politics, and metaphysics, were discussed, and discussed with
a. freshness and enthusiasm which is apt to wear off when doing
has to take the place of talking, but has a strange charm of its
own while it lasts, and is looked back to with loving regret by
those for whom it is no longer a possibility.</p>

<p>With this set Tom soon fraternized, and drank in many new ideas,
and took to himself also many new crotchets besides those with
which he was already weighted. Almost all his new acquaintances
were Liberal in politics, but a few only were ready to go all
lengths with him. They were all Union men, and Tom, of course,
followed the fashion, and soon propounded theories in that institution
which gained him the name of Chartist Brown.</p>

<p>There was a strong mixture of self-conceit in it all. He had
a kind of idea that he had discovered something which it was creditable
to have discovered, and that it was a very fine thing to have
all these feelings for, and sympathies with, "the masses", and
to believe in democracy, and "glorious humanity," and "a good
time coming," and I know not what other big matters. And, although
it startled and pained him at first to hear himself called ugly
names, which he had hated and despised from his youth up, and
to know that many of his old acquaintances looked upon him, not
simply as a madman, but as a madman with snobbish proclivities;
yet, when the first plunge was over, there was a good deal on
the other hand which tickled his vanity, and was far from being
unpleasant.</p>

<p>To do him justice, however, the disagreeables were such that,
had there not been some genuine belief at the bottom, he would
certainly have been headed back very speedily into the fold of
political and social orthodoxy. As it was, amidst the cloud of
sophisms, and platitudes, and big, one-sided ideas half-mastered,
which filled his thoughts and overflowed in his talk, there was
growing in him, and taking firmer hold on him daily, a true and
broad sympathy for men as men, and especially for poor men as
poor men, and a righteous and burning hatred against all laws,
customs, or notions, which, according to his light, either were
or seemed to be setting aside, or putting anything else in the
place of, or above, the man. It was with him the natural outgrowth
of the child's and boy's training (though his father would have
been much astonished to be told so), and the instincts of those
early days were now getting rapidly set into habits and faiths,
and becoming a part of himself.</p>

<p>In this stage of his life, as in so many former ones, Tom got
great help from his intercourse with Hardy, now the rising tutor
of the college. Hardy was travelling much the same road himself
as our hero, but was somewhat further on, and had come into it
from a different country, and though quite other obstacles. Their
early lives had been very different; and, both by nature and from
long and severe self-restraint and discipline, Hardy was much
the less impetuous and demonstrative of the two. He did not rush
out, therefore (as Tom was too much inclined to do), the moment
he had seized hold of the end of a new idea which he felt to be
good for <em>him</em> and what <em>he</em> wanted, and brandish
it in the face of all comers, and think himself a traitor to the
truth if he wasn't trying to make everybody he met with eat it.
Hardy, on the contrary, would test his new idea, and turn it over,
and prove it as far as he could, and try to get hold of the whole
of it, and ruthlessly strip off any tinsel or rose-pink sentiment
with which it might happen to be mixed up.</p>

<p>Often and often did Tom suffer under this severe method, and
rebel against it, and accuse his friend, both to his face and
in his own secret thoughts, of coldness, and want of faith, and
all manner of other sins of omission and commission. In the end,
however, he generally came round, with more or less of rebellion,
according to the severity of the treatment, and acknowledge that,
when Hardy brought him down from riding the high horse, it was
not without good reason, and that the dust in which he was rolled
was always most wholesome dust.</p>

<p>For instance, there was no phrase more frequently in the mouths
of the party of progress than "the good cause." It was a fine
big-sounding phrase, which could be used with great effect in
perorations of speeches at the Union, and was sufficiently indefinite
to be easily defended from ordinary attacks, while it saved him
who used it the trouble of ascertaining accurately for himself,
or settling for his hearers, what it really did mean. But, however
satisfactory it might be before promiscuous audiences, and so
long as vehement assertion or declaration was all that was required
to uphold it, this same "good cause" was liable to come to much
grief when it had to get itself defined. Hardy was particularly
given to persecution on this subject, when he could get Tom, and,
perhaps, one or two others, in a quiet room by themselves. While
professing the utmost sympathy for "the good cause," and a hope
as strong as theirs that all its enemies might find themselves
suspended to lamp-posts as soon as possible, he would pursue it
into corners from which escape was most difficult, asking it and
its supporters what it exactly was, and driving them from one
cloud-land to another, and from "the good cause" to the "people's
cause," the "cause of labor," and other like troublesome definitions,
until the great idea seemed to have no shape or existence any
longer even in their own brains.</p>

<p>But Hardy's persecution, provoking as it was for the time, never
went to the undermining of any real conviction in the minds of
his juniors, or the shaking of anything which did not need shaking,
but only helped them to clear their ideas and brains as to what
they were talking and thinking about, and gave them glimpses&mdash;soon
clouded over again, but most useful, nevertheless&mdash;of the truth;
that there were a good many knotty questions to be solved before
a man could be quite sure that he had found out the way to set
the world thoroughly to rights, and heal all the ills that flesh
is heir to.</p>

<p>Hardy treated another of his friend's most favorite notions even
with less respect than this one of "the good cause." Democracy,
that "universal democracy," which their favourite author had recently
declared to be "an inevitable fact of the days in which we live",
was, perhaps, on the whole, the pet idea of the small section
of liberal young Oxford, with whom Tom was now hand and glove.
They lost no opportunity of worshipping it, and doing battle for
it; and, indeed, most of them did very truly believe that that
state of the world which this universal democracy was to bring
about, and which was coming no man could say how soon, was to
be in fact that age of peace and good-will which men had dreamt
of in all times, when the lion should lie down with the kid, and
nation should not vex nation any more.</p>

<p>After hearing something to this effect from Tom on several occasions,
Hardy cunningly lured him to his rooms on the pretence of talking
over the prospects of the boat club, and then, having seated him
by the fire, which he himself proceeded to assault gently with
the poker, propounded suddenly to him the question,</p>

<p>"Brown, I should like to know what you mean by 'democracy'?"</p>

<p>Tom at once saw the trap into which he had fallen, and made several
efforts to break away, but unsuccessfully; and, being seated to
a cup of tea, and allowed to smoke, was then and there grievously
oppressed, and mangled, and sat upon, by his oldest and best friend.
He took his ground carefully, and propounded only what he felt
sure that Hardy himself would at once accept&mdash;what no man of any
worth could possibly take exception to. "He meant much more,"
he said, "than this; but for the present purpose it would be enough
for him to say that, whatever else it might mean, democracy in
his mouth always meant that every man should have a share in the
government of his country."</p>

<p>Hardy, seeming to acquiesce, and making a sudden change in the
subject of their talk, decoyed his innocent guest away from the
thought of democracy for a few minutes, by holding up to him the
flag of hero-worship, in which worship Tom was, of course, a sedulous
believer. Then, having involved him in most difficult country,
his persecutor opened fire upon him from masked batteries of the
most deadly kind, the guns being all from the armory of his own
prophets.</p>

<p>"You long for the rule of the ablest man, everywhere, at all
times? To find your ablest man, and then give him power, and obey
him&mdash;that you hold to be about the highest act of wisdom which
a nation can be capable of?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and you know you believe that to, Hardy, just as firmly
as I do."</p>

<p>"I hope so. But then, how about our universal democracy, and
every man having a share in the government of his country?"</p>

<p>Tom felt that his flank was turned; in fact, the contrast of
his two beliefs had never struck him vividly before, and he was
consequently much confused. But Hardy went on tapping a big coal
gently with the poker, and gave him time to recover himself and
collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I don't mean, of course, that every man is to have an actual
share in the government," he said at last.</p>

<p>"But every man is somehow to have a share; and, if not an actual
one, I can't see what the proposition comes to."</p>

<p>"I call it having a share in the government when a man has share
in saying who shall govern him."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll own that's a very different thing. But let's see;
will that find our wisest governor for us&mdash;letting all the most
foolish men in the nation have a say as to who he is to be?"</p>

<p>"Come now, Hardy, I've heard you say that you are for manhood
suffrage."</p>

<p>"That's another question; you let in another idea there. At present
we are considering whether the <em>vox populi</em> is the best
test for finding your best man. I'm afraid all history is against
you."</p>

<p>"That's a good joke. Now, there I defy you, Hardy."</p>

<p>"Begin at the beginning, then, and let us see."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll say, then, that the Egyptian and Babylonian
empires were better than the little Jewish republic."</p>

<p>"Republic! well, let that pass. But I never heard that the Jews
elected Moses, or any of the judges."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind the Jews; they're an exceptional case; you
can't argue from them."</p>

<p>"I don't admit that. I believe just the contrary. But go on."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what do you say to the glorious Greek republics,
with Athens at the head of them?"</p>

<p>"I say that no nation ever treated their best men so badly. I
see I must put on a lecture in Aristophanes for your special benefit.
Vain, irritable, shallow, suspicious old Demus, with his two oboli
in his cheek, and doubting only between Cleon and the sausage-seller,
which he shall choose for his wisest man&mdash;not to govern, but to
serve his whims and caprices. You must call another witness, I
think."</p>

<p>"But that's a caricature."</p>

<p>"Take the picture, then, out of Thucydides, Plato, Xenophon,
how you will&mdash;you won't mend the matter much. You shouldn't go
so fast, Brown; you won't mind my saying so, I know. You don't
get clear in your own mind before you pitch into everyone who
comes across you, and so do your own side (which I admit is mostly
the right one) more harm than good."</p>

<p>Tom couldn't stand being put down so summarily, and fought over
the ground from one country to another, from Rome to the United
States, with all the arguments he could muster, but with little
success. That unfortunate first admission of his, he felt it throughout,
like a millstone round his neck, and could not help admitting
to himself, when he left, that there was a good deal in Hardy's
concluding remark,&mdash;"You'll find it rather a tough business to
get your 'universal democracy' and 'government by the wisest'
to pull together in one coach."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all such occasional reverses and cold baths,
however, Tom went on strengthening himself in his new opinions,
and maintaining them with all the zeal of a convert. The shelves
of his bookcase, and the walls of his room, soon began to show
signs of the change which was taking place in his ways of looking
at men and things. Hitherto a framed engraving of George <em>III
</em>had hung over his mantle-piece; but early in this, his third
year, the frame had disappeared for a few days, and when it reappeared,
the solemn face of John Milton looked out from it, while the honest
monarch had retired into a portfolio. A facsimile of Magna Charta
soon displaced a large colored print of "A Day With the Pycheley",
and soon afterwards the death warrant of Charles I. with its grim
and resolute rows of signatures and seals, appeared on the wall
in a place of honour, in the neighbourhood of Milton.</p>

<p>Squire Brown was passing through Oxford, and paid his son a visit
soon after this last arrangement had been completed. He dined
in hall, at the high table, being still a member of the college,
and afterwards came with Hardy to Tom's rooms to have a quiet
glass of wine, and spend the evening with his son and a few of
his friends, who had been asked to meet "the governor."</p>

<p>Tom had a struggle with himself whether he should not remove
the death-warrant into his bedroom for the evening, and had actually
taken if down with this view; but in the end he could not stomach
such a backsliding, and so restored it to its place. "I have never
concealed my opinions from my father," he thought, "though I don't
think he quite knows what they are. But if he doesn't, he ought,
and the sooner the better. I should be a sneak to try to hide
them. I know he won't like it, but he is always just and fair,
and will make allowances. At any rate, up it goes again."</p>

<p>And so he re-hung the death-warrant, but with the devout secret
hope that his father might not see it.</p>

<p>The wine-party went off admirably. The men were nice, gentlemanly,
intelligent fellows; and the Squire, who had been carefully planted
by Tom with his back to the death-warrant, enjoyed himself very
much. At last they all went, except Hardy; and now the nervous
time approached. For a short time longer the three sat at the
wine-table while the squire enlarged upon the great improvement
in young men, and the habits of the University, especially in
the matter of drinking. Tom had only opened three bottles of port.
In his time the men would have drunk certainly not less than a
bottle a man; and other like remarks he made, as he sipped his
coffee, and then, pushing back his chair, said, "Well, Tom, hadn't
your servant better clear away, and then we can draw round the
fire, and have a talk."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to take a turn while he is clearing? There's
the Martyr's Memorial you haven't seen."</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I know the place well enough. I don't come to
walk about in the dark. We sha'n't be in your man's way."</p>

<p>And so Tom's scout came in to clear away, took out the extra
leaves of the table, put on the cloth, and laid tea. During these
operations Mr. Brown was standing with his back to the fire, looking
about him as he talked. When there was more space to move in,
he began to walk up and down, and very soon took to remarking
the furniture and arrangements of the room. One after the other
the pictures came under his notice. Most of them escaped without
comment, the Squire simply pausing a moment, and then taking up
his walk again. Magna Charta drew forth his hearty approval. It
was a capital notion to hang such things on his walls, instead
of bad prints of steeple-chases, or trash of that sort. "Ah, here's
something else of the same kind. Why, Tom, what's this?" said
the squire, as he paused before the death-warrant. There was a
moment or two of dead silence, while the Squire's eyes ran down
the names, from Jo. Bradshaw to Miles Corbet; and then he turned,
and came and sat down opposite to his son. Tom expected his father
to be vexed, but was not the least prepared for the tone of pain,
and sorrow, and anger, in which he first inquired, and then remonstrated.</p>

<p>For some time past the Squire and his son had not felt so comfortable
together as of old. Mr. Brown had been annoyed by much that Tom
had done in the case of Harry Winburn, though he did not know
all. There had sprung up a barrier somehow or other between them,
neither of them knew how. They had often felt embarrassed at being
left alone together during the past year, and found that there
were certain topics which they could not talk upon, which they
avoided by mutual consent. Every now and then the constraint and
embarrassment fell off for a short time, for at bottom they loved
and appreciated one another heartily; but the divergences in their
thoughts and habits had become very serious, and seemed likely
to increase rather than not. They felt keenly the chasm between
the two generations. As they looked at one another from opposite
banks, each in his secret heart blamed the other in great measure
for that which was the fault of neither. Mixed with the longings
which each felt for a better understanding was enough of reserve
and indignation to prevent them from coming to it. The discovery
of their differences was too recent, and they were too much alike
in character and temper, for either to make large enough allowance
for, or to be really tolerant of, the other.</p>

<p>This was the first occasion on which they had come to outspoken
and serious difference; and though the collision had been exceedingly
painful to both, yet when they parted for the night, it was with
a feeling of relief that the ice had been thoroughly broken. Before
his father left the room, Tom had torn the facsimile of the death-warrant
out of its frame, and put it in the fire, protesting, however,
at the same time, that, though "he did thist out of deference
to his father, and was deeply grieved at having given him pain,
he could not and would not give up his convictions, or pretend
that they were changed, or even shaken."</p>

<p>The Squire walked back to his hotel deeply moved. Who can wonder?
He was a man full of living and vehement convictions. One of his
early recollections had been the arrival in England of the news
of the beheading of Louis <em>XVI, </em>and the doings of the
Reign of Terror. He had been bred in the times when it was held
impossible for a gentleman or a Christian to hold such views as
his son had been maintaining, and, like many of the noblest Englishmen
of his time, had gone with and accepted the creed of the day.</p>

<p>Tom remained behind, dejected and melancholy; now accusing his
father of injustice and bigotry, now longing to go after him,
and give up everything. What were all his opinions and convictions
compared with his father's confidence and love? At breakfast the
next morning, however, after each of them had had time for thinking
over what had passed, they met with a cordiality which was as
pleasant to each as it was unlooked for; and from this visit of
his father to him at Oxford, Tom dated a new and more satisfactory
epoch in their intercourse.</p>

<p>The fact had begun to dawn on the Squire that the world had changed
a good deal since his time. He saw that young men were much improved
in some ways, and acknowledged the fact heartily; on the other
hand, they had taken up with a lot of new notions which he could
not understand, and thought mischievous and bad. Perhaps Tom might
get over them as he got to be older and wiser, and in the meantime
he must take the evil with the good. At any rate he was too fair
a man to try to dragoon his son out of anything which he really
believed. Tom on his part gratefully accepted the change in his
father's manner, and took all means of showing his gratitude by
consulting and talking freely to him on such subjects as they
could agree upon, which were numerous, keeping in the back-ground
the questions which had provoked painful discussions between them.
By degrees these even could be tenderly approached; and, now that
they were approached in a different spirit, the honest beliefs
of the father and son no longer looked so monstrous to one another,
the hard and sharp outlines began to wear off, and the views of
each of them to be modified. Thus, bit by bit, by a slow but sure
process, a better understanding than ever was re-established between
them.</p>

<p>This beginning of a better state of things in his relations with
his father consoled Tom for many other matters that seemed to
go wrong with him, and was a constant bit of bright sky to turn
to when the rest of his horizon looked dark and dreary, as it
did often enough.</p>

<p>For it proved a very trying year to him, this his third and last
year at the University; a year full of large dreams and small
performances, of unfulfilled hopes and struggles to set himself
right, ending ever more surely in failure and disappointment.
The common pursuits of the place had lost their freshness, and
with it much of their charm. He was beginning to feel himself
in a cage, and to beat against the bars of it.</p>

<p>Often, in spite of all his natural hopefulness, his heart seemed
to sicken and turn cold, without any apparent reason; his old
pursuits palled on him, and he scarcely cared to turn to new ones.
What was it that made life so blank to him at these times? How
was it that he could not keep the spirit within him alive and
warm?</p>

<p>It was easier to ask such questions than to get an answer. Was
it not this place he was living in and the ways of it? No, for
the place and its ways were the same as ever, and his own way
of life in it better than ever before. Was it the want of sight
or tidings of Mary? Sometimes he thought so, and then cast the
thought away as treason. His love for her was ever sinking deeper
into him, and raising and purifying him. Light and strength and
life came from that source; craven weariness and coldness of heart,
come from whence they might, were not from that quarter. But precious
as his love was to him, and deeply as it affected his whole life,
he felt that there must be something beyond it&mdash;that its full
satisfaction would not be enough for him. The bed was too narrow
for a man to stretch himself on. What he was in search of must
underlie and embrace his human love, and support it. Beyond and
above all private and personal desires and hopes and longings,
he was conscious of a restless craving and feeling about after
something, which he could not grasp, and yet which was not avoiding
him, which seemed to be mysteriously laying hold of him and surrounding
him.</p>

<p>The routine of chapels, and lectures, and reading for degree,
boating, cricketing, Union-debating,&mdash;all well enough in their
way&mdash;left this vacuum unfilled. There was a great outer visible
world, the problems and puzzles of which were rising before him
and haunting him more and more; and a great inner and invisible
world opening round him in awful depth. He seemed to be standing
on the brink of each&mdash;now shivering and helpless, feeling like
an atom about to be whirled into the great flood and carried he
knew not where&mdash;now ready to plunge in and take his part, full
of hope and belief that he was meant to buffet in the strength
of a man with the seen and the unseen, and to be subdued by neither.</p>

<p>In such a year as this, a bit of steady, bright blue sky was
a boon beyond all price, and so he felt it to be. And it was not
only with his father that Tom regained lost ground in this year.
He was in a state of mind in which he could not bear to neglect
or lose any particle of human sympathy, and so he turned to old
friendships, and revived the correspondence with several of his
old school-fellows, and particularly with Arthur, to the great
delight of the latter, who had mourned bitterly over the few half-yearly
lines, all he had got from Tom of late, in answer to his own letters,
which had themselves, under the weight of neglect, gradually dwindled
down to mere formal matters. A specimen of the later correspondence
may fitly close the chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>ST. AMBROSE</em></p>

<p>"Dear Geordie &mdash;I can hardly pardon you for having gone
to Cambridge, though you have got a Trinity scholarship&mdash;which
I suppose is, on the whole, quite as good a thing as anything
of the sort you could have got up here. I had so looked forward
to having you here though, and now I feel that we shall probably
scarcely ever meet. You will go your way and I mine; and one alters
so quickly, and gets into such strange new grooves, that unless
one sees a man about once a week at least, you may be just like
strangers when you are thrown together again. If you had come
up here it would have been all right, and we should have gone
all through life as we were when I left school, and as I know
we should be again in no time if you had come here. But now, who
can tell?</p>

<p>"What makes me think so much of this is a visit of a few days
that East paid me just before his regiment went to India. I feel
that if he hadn't done it, and we had not met till he came back&mdash;years
hence perhaps&mdash;we should never have been to one another what we
shall be now. The break would have been too great. Now it's all
right. You would have liked to see the old fellow grown into a
man, but not a bit altered&mdash;just the quiet, old way, pooh-poohing
you, and pretending to care for nothing, but ready to cut the
nose off his face, or go through fire and water for you at a pinch,
if you'll only let him go his own way about it, and have his grumble,
and say that he does it all from the worst possible motives.</p>

<p>"But we must try not to lose hold of one another, Geordie. It
would be a bitter day to me if I thought anything of the kind
could ever happen again. We must write more to one another. I've
been awfully lazy, I know, about it for this last year and more;
but then I always thought you would be coming up here, and so
that it didn't matter much. But now I will turn over a new leaf,
and write to you about my secret thoughts, my works and ways;
and you must do it too. If we can only tide over the next year
or two we shall get into plain sailing, and I suppose it will
all right then. At least, I can't believe that one is likely to
have many such up-and-down years in one's life as the last two.
If one is, goodness knows where I shall end. You know the outline
of what has happened to me from my letters, and the talks we have
had in my flying visits to the old school, but you haven't a notion
of the troubles of mind I've been in, and the changes I've gone
through. I can hardly believe it myself when I look back. However
I'm quite sure I have <em>got on</em>; that's my great comfort.
It is a strange blind sort of world, that's a fact, with lots
of blind alleys, down which you go blundering in the fog after
some seedy gaslight, which you take for the sun till you run against
the wall at the end, and find out that the light is a gaslight,
and that there's no thoroughfare. But for all that one does get
on. You get to know the sun's light better and better, and to
keep out of the blind alleys; and I am surer and surer every day,
that there's always sunlight enough for every honest fellow&mdash;though
I didn't think so a few months back&mdash;and a good sound road under
his feet, if he will only step out on it.</p>

<p>"Talking of blind alleys puts me in mind of your last. Aren't
you going down a blind alley, or something worse? There's no wall
to bring you up, that I can see down the turn you've taken; and
then, what's the practical use of it all? What good would you
do to yourself, or anyone else, if you could get to the end of
it? I can't for the life of me fancy, I confess, what you think
will come of speculating about necessity and free will. I only
know that I can hold out my hand before me, and can move it to
the right or left, despite of all the powers in heaven or earth.
As I sit here writing to you, I can let into my heart, and give
the reins to, all sorts of devil's passions, or to the Spirit
of God. Well, that's enough for me. I <em>know</em> it of myself,
and I believe you know it of yourself, and everybody knows it
of themselves or himself; and why you can't be satisfied with
that, passes my comprehension. As if one hasn't got puzzles enough,
and bothers enough, under one's nose, without going a-field after
a lot of metaphysical quibbles. No, I'm wrong,&mdash;not going a-field,&mdash;anything
one has to go a-field for is all right. What a fellow meets outside
himself he isn't responsible for, and must do the best he can
with. But to go on for ever looking inside of one's self, and
groping about amongst one's own sensations, and ideas, and whimsies
of one kind and another, I can't conceive a poorer line of business
than that. Don't you get into it now, that's a dear boy.</p>

<p>"Very likely you'll tell me you can't help it; that every one
has his own difficulties, and must fight them out, and that mine
are one sort, and yours another. Well, perhaps you may be right.
I hope I'm getting to know that my plummet isn't to measure all
the world. But it does seem a pity that men shouldn't be thinking
about how to cure some of the wrongs which poor dear old England
is pretty near dying of, instead of taking the edge off their
brains, and spending all their steam in speculating about all
kinds of things, which wouldn't make any poor man in the world&mdash;or
rich one either, for that matter&mdash;a bit better off, if they were
all found out, and settled to-morrow. But here I am at the end
of my paper. Don't be angry at my jobation; but write me a long
answer of your own free will, and believe me ever affectionately
yours,</p>
