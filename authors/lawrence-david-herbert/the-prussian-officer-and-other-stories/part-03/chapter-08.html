<p>No one remarked on her exit.  She put on her fur hat, that the
village people knew so well, and the old Norfolk jacket.  Louisa
was short and plump and plain.  She had her mother's heavy jaw, her
father's proud brow, and her own grey, brooding eyes that were very
beautiful when she smiled.  It was true, as the people said, that
she looked sulky.  Her chief attraction was her glistening, heavy,
deep-blond hair, which shone and gleamed with a richness that was
not entirely foreign to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Where am I going?&quot; she said to herself, when she got outside in
the snow.  She did not hesitate, however, but by mechanical walking
found herself descending the hill towards Old Aldecross.  In the
valley that was black with trees, the colliery breathed in
stertorous pants, sending out high conical columns of steam that
remained upright, whiter than the snow on the hills, yet shadowy,
in the dead air.  Louisa would not acknowledge to herself whither
she was making her way, till she came to the railway crossing.
Then the bunches of snow in the twigs of the apple tree that leaned
towards the fence told her she must go and see Mrs Durant.  The
tree was in Mrs Durant's garden.</p>

<p>Alfred was now at home again, living with his mother in the cottage
below the road.  From the highway hedge, by the railway crossing,
the snowy garden sheered down steeply, like the side of a hole,
then dropped straight in a wall.  In this depth the house was snug,
its chimney just level with the road.  Miss Louisa descended the
stone stairs, and stood below in the little backyard, in the
dimness and the semi-secrecy.  A big tree leaned overhead, above
the paraffin hut.  Louisa felt secure from all the world down
there.  She knocked at the open door, then looked round.  The
tongue of garden narrowing in from the quarry bed was white with
snow: she thought of the thick fringes of snowdrops it would show
beneath the currant bushes in a month's time.  The ragged fringe of
pinks hanging over the garden brim behind her was whitened now with
snow-flakes, that in summer held white blossom to Louisa's face.
It was pleasant, she thought, to gather flowers that stooped to
one's face from above.</p>

<p>She knocked again.  Peeping in, she saw the scarlet glow of the
kitchen, red firelight falling on the brick floor and on the bright
chintz cushions.  It was alive and bright as a peep-show.  She
crossed the scullery, where still an almanac hung.  There was no
one about.  &quot;Mrs Durant,&quot; called Louisa softly, &quot;Mrs Durant.&quot;</p>

<p>She went up the brick step into the front room, that still had its
little shop counter and its bundles of goods, and she called from
the stair-foot.  Then she knew Mrs Durant was out.</p>

<p>She went into the yard to follow the old woman's footsteps up the
garden path.</p>

<p>She emerged from the bushes and raspberry canes.  There was the
whole quarry bed, a wide garden white and dimmed, brindled with
dark bushes, lying half submerged.  On the left, overhead, the
little colliery train rumbled by.  Right away at the back was a
mass of trees.</p>

<p>Louisa followed the open path, looking from right to left, and then
she gave a cry of concern.  The old woman was sitting rocking
slightly among the ragged snowy cabbages.  Louisa ran to her, found
her whimpering with little, involuntary cries.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever have you done?&quot; cried Louisa, kneeling in the snow.</p>

<p>&quot;I've - I've - I was pulling a brussel-sprout stalk - and - oh-h! - 
something tore inside me.  I've had a pain,&quot; the old woman wept
from shock and suffering, gasping between her whimpers, - &quot;I've had
a pain there - a long time - and now - oh - oh!&quot;  She panted, pressed
her hand on her side, leaned as if she would faint, looking yellow
against the snow.  Louisa supported her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think you could walk now?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; gasped the old woman.</p>

<p>Louisa helped her to her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Get the cabbage - I want it for Alfred's dinner,&quot; panted Mrs
Durant.  Louisa picked up the stalk of brussel-sprouts, and with
difficulty got the old woman indoors.  She gave her brandy, laid
her on the couch, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to send for a doctor - wait just a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The young woman ran up the steps to the public-house a few yards
away.  The landlady was astonished to see Miss Louisa.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you send for a doctor at once to Mrs Durant,&quot; she said, with
some of her father in her commanding tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Is something the matter?&quot; fluttered the landlady in concern.</p>

<p>Louisa, glancing out up the road, saw the grocer's cart driving to
Eastwood.  She ran and stopped the man, and told him.</p>

<p>Mrs Durant lay on the sofa, her face turned away, when the young
woman came back.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me put you to bed,&quot; Louisa said.  Mrs Durant did not resist.</p>

<p>Louisa knew the ways of the working people.  In the bottom drawer
of the dresser she found dusters and flannels.  With the old pit-
flannel she snatched out the oven shelves, wrapped them up, and put
them in the bed.  From the son's bed she took a blanket, and,
running down, set it before the fire.  Having undressed the little
old woman, Louisa carried her upstairs.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll drop me, you'll drop me!&quot; cried Mrs Durant.</p>

<p>Louisa did not answer, but bore her burden quickly.  She could not
light a fire, because there was no fire-place in the bedroom.  And
the floor was plaster.  So she fetched the lamp, and stood it
lighted in one corner.</p>

<p>&quot;It will air the room,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; moaned the old woman.</p>

<p>Louisa ran with more hot flannels, replacing those from the oven
shelves.  Then she made a bran-bag and laid it on the woman's side.
There was a big lump on the side of the abdomen.</p>

<p>&quot;I've felt it coming a long time,&quot; moaned the old lady, when the
pain was easier, &quot;but I've not said anything; I didn't want to
upset our Alfred.&quot;</p>

<p>Louisa did not see why &quot;our Alfred&quot; should be spared.</p>

<p>&quot;What time is it?&quot; came the plaintive voice.</p>

<p>&quot;A quarter to four.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; wailed the old lady, &quot;he'll be here in half an hour, and no
dinner ready for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me do it?&quot; said Louisa, gently.</p>

<p>&quot;There's that cabbage - and you'll find the meat in the pantry - and
there's an apple pie you can hot up.  But DON'T YOU do it - !&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who will, then?&quot; asked Louisa.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; moaned the sick woman, unable to consider.</p>

<p>Louisa did it.  The doctor came and gave serious examination.  He
looked very grave.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, doctor?&quot; asked the old lady, looking up at him with
old, pathetic eyes in which already hope was dead.</p>

<p>&quot;I think you've torn the skin in which a tumour hangs,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; she murmured, and she turned away.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, she may die any minute - and it MAY be swaled away,&quot; said
the old doctor to Louisa.</p>

<p>The young woman went upstairs again.</p>

<p>&quot;He says the lump may be swaled away, and you may get quite well
again,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ay!&quot; murmured the old lady.  It did not deceive her.  Presently
she asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a good fire?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so,&quot; answered Louisa.</p>

<p>&quot;He'll want a good fire,&quot; the mother said.  Louisa attended to it.</p>

<p>Since the death of Durant, the widow had come to church
occasionally, and Louisa had been friendly to her.  In the girl's
heart the purpose was fixed.  No man had affected her as Alfred
Durant had done, and to that she kept.  In her heart, she adhered
to him.  A natural sympathy existed between her and his rather
hard, materialistic mother.</p>

<p>Alfred was the most lovable of the old woman's sons.  He had grown
up like the rest, however, headstrong and blind to everything but
his own will.  Like the other boys, he had insisted on going into
the pit as soon as he left school, because that was the only way
speedily to become a man, level with all the other men.  This was a
great chagrin to his mother, who would have liked to have this last
of her sons a gentleman.</p>

<p>But still he remained constant to her.  His feeling for her was
deep and unexpressed.  He noticed when she was tired, or when she
had a new cap.  And he bought little things for her occasionally.
She was not wise enough to see how much he lived by her.</p>

<p>At the bottom he did not satisfy her, he did not seem manly enough.
He liked to read books occasionally, and better still he liked to
play the piccolo.  It amused her to see his head nod over the
instrument as he made an effort to get the right note.  It made her
fond of him, with tenderness, almost pity, but not with respect.
She wanted a man to be fixed, going his own way without knowledge
of women.  Whereas she knew Alfred depended on her.  He sang in the
choir because he liked singing.  In the summer he worked in the
garden, attended to the fowls and pigs.  He kept pigeons.  He
played on Saturday in the cricket or football team.  But to her he
did not seem the man, the independent man her other boys had been.
He was her baby - and whilst she loved him for it, she was a little
bit contemptuous of him.</p>

<p>There grew up a little hostility between them.  Then he began to
drink, as the others had done; but not in their blind, oblivious
way.  He was a little self-conscious over it.  She saw this, and
she pitied it in him.  She loved him most, but she was not
satisfied with him because he was not free of her.  He could not
quite go his own way.</p>

<p>Then at twenty he ran away and served his time in the Navy.  This
made a man of him.  He had hated it bitterly, the service, the
subordination.  For years he fought with himself under the military
discipline, for his own self-respect, struggling through blind
anger and shame and a cramping sense of inferiority.  Out of
humiliation and self-hatred, he rose into a sort of inner freedom.
And his love for his mother, whom he idealised, remained the fact
of hope and of belief.</p>

<p>He came home again, nearly thirty years old, but na&iuml;ve and
inexperienced as a boy, only with a silence about him that was new:
a sort of dumb humility before life, a fear of living.  He was
almost quite chaste.  A strong sensitiveness had kept him from
women.  Sexual talk was all very well among men, but somehow it had
no application to living women.  There were two things for him, the
IDEA of women, with which he sometimes debauched himself, and real
women, before whom he felt a deep uneasiness, and a need to draw
away.  He shrank and defended himself from the approach of any
woman.  And then he felt ashamed.  In his innermost soul he felt he
was not a man, he was less than the normal man.  In Genoa he went
with an under officer to a drinking house where the cheaper sort of
girl came in to look for lovers.  He sat there with his glass, the
girls looked at him, but they never came to him.  He knew that if
they did come he could only pay for food and drink for them,
because he felt a pity for them, and was anxious lest they lacked
good necessities.  He could not have gone with one of them: he knew
it, and was ashamed, looking with curious envy at the swaggering,
easy-passionate Italian whose body went to a woman by instinctive
impersonal attraction.  They were men, he was not a man.  He sat
feeling short, feeling like a leper.  And he went away imagining
sexual scenes between himself and a woman, walking wrapt in this
indulgence.  But when the ready woman presented herself, the very
fact that she was a palpable woman made it impossible for him to
touch her.  And this incapacity was like a core of rottenness in
him.</p>

<p>So several times he went, drunk, with his companions, to the
licensed prostitute houses abroad.  But the sordid insignificance
of the experience appalled him.  It had not been anything really:
it meant nothing.  He felt as if he were, not physically, but
spiritually impotent: not actually impotent, but intrinsically so.</p>

<p>He came home with this secret, never changing burden of his
unknown, unbestowed self torturing him.  His navy training left him
in perfect physical condition.  He was sensible of, and proud of
his body.  He bathed and used dumb-bells, and kept himself fit.  He
played cricket and football.  He read books and began to hold fixed
ideas which he got from the Fabians.  He played his piccolo, and
was considered an expert.  But at the bottom of his soul was always
this canker of shame and incompleteness: he was miserable beneath
all his healthy cheerfulness, he was uneasy and felt despicable
among all his confidence and superiority of ideas.  He would have
changed with any mere brute, just to be free of himself, to be free
of this shame of self-consciousness.  He saw some collier lurching
straight forward without misgiving, pursuing his own satisfactions,
and he envied him.  Anything, he would have given anything for this
spontaneity and this blind stupidity which went to its own
satisfaction direct.</p>
