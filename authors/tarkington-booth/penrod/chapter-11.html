<p>The returning students, that afternoon, observed that Penrod's
desk was vacant&mdash;and nothing could have been more impressive than
that sinister mere emptiness. The accepted theory was that Penrod
had been arrested. How breathtaking, then, the sensation when,
at the beginning of the second hour, he strolled&mdash;in with inimitable
carelessness and, rubbing his eyes, somewhat noticeably in the
manner of one who has snatched an hour of much needed sleep, took
his place as if nothing in particular had happened. This, at first
supposed to be a superhuman exhibition of sheer audacity, became
but the more dumfounding when Miss Spence&mdash;looking up from her
desk&mdash;greeted him with a pleasant little nod. Even after school,
Penrod gave numerous maddened investigators no relief. All he
would consent to say was:</p>

<p>"Oh, I just <em>TALKED </em>to her."</p>

<p>A mystification not entirely unconnected with the one thus produced
was manifested at his own family dinner-table the following evening.
Aunt Clara had been out rather late, and came to the table after
the rest were seated. She wore a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"Do you ever see Mary Spence nowadays?" she inquired, as she
unfolded her napkin, addressing Mrs. Schofield. Penrod abruptly
set down his soup-spoon and gazed at his aunt with flattering
attention.</p>

<p>"Yes; sometimes," said Mrs. Schofield. "She's Penrod's teacher."</p>

<p>"Is she?" said Mrs. Farry. "Do you&mdash;" She paused. "Do people
think her a little&mdash;queer, these days?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," returned her sister. "What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"She has acquired a very odd manner," said Mrs. Farry decidedly.
"At least, she seemed odd to <em>ME. I </em>met her at the corner
just before I got to the house, a few minutes ago, and after we'd
said howdy-do to each other, she kept hold of my hand and looked
as though she was going to cry. She seemed to be trying to say
something, and choking&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I don't think that's so very queer, Clara. She knew you
in school, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And she hadn't seen you for so many years, I think it's perfectly
natural she&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait! She stood there squeezing my hand, and struggling to get
her voice&mdash;and I got really embarrassed&mdash;and then finally she
said, in a kind of tearful whisper, 'Be of good cheer&mdash;this trial
will pass!'"</p>

<p>"How queer!" exclaimed Margaret.</p>

<p>Penrod sighed, and returned somewhat absently to his soup.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Mrs. Schofield thoughtfully. "Of course
she's heard about the outbreak of measles in Dayton, since they
had to close the schools, and she knows you live there&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But doesn't it seem a <em>VERY </em>exaggerated way," suggested
Margaret, "to talk about measles?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" begged Aunt Clara. "After she said that, she said something
even queerer, and then put her handkerchief to her eyes and hurried
away."</p>

<p>Penrod laid down his spoon again and moved his chair slightly
back from the table. A spirit of prophecy was upon him: he knew
that someone was going to ask a question which he felt might better
remain unspoken.</p>

<p>"What <em>WAS </em>the other thing she said?" Mr. Schofield inquired,
thus immediately fulfilling his son's premonition.</p>

<p>"She said," returned Mrs. Farry slowly, looking about the table,
"she said, 'I know that Penrod is a great, great comfort to you!'"</p>

<p>There was a general exclamation of surprise. It was a singular
thing, and in no manner may it be considered complimentary to
Penrod, that this speech of Miss Spence's should have immediately
confirmed Mrs. Farry's doubts about her in the minds of all his
family.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield shook his head pityingly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she's a goner," he went so far as to say.</p>

<p>"Of all the weird ideas!" cried Margaret.</p>

<p>"I never heard anything like it in my life!" Mrs. Schofield exclaimed.
"Was that <em>ALL </em>she said?"</p>

<p>"Every word!"</p>

<p>Penrod again resumed attention to his soup. His mother looked
at him curiously, and then, struck by a sudden thought, gathered
the glances of the adults of the table by a significant movement
of the head, and, by another, conveyed an admonition to drop the
subject until later. Miss Spence was Penrod's teacher: it was
better, for many reasons, not to discuss the subject of her queerness
before him. This was Mrs. Schofield's thought at the time. Later
she had another, and it kept her awake.</p>

<p>The next afternoon, Mr. Schofield, returning at five o'clock
from the cares of the day, found the house deserted, and sat down
to read his evening paper in what appeared to be an uninhabited
apartment known to its own world as the "drawing-room." A sneeze,
unexpected both to him and the owner, informed him of the presence
of another person.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Penrod?" the parent asked, looking about.</p>

<p>"Here," said Penrod meekly.</p>

<p>Stooping, Mr. Schofield discovered his son squatting under the
piano, near an open window&mdash;his wistful Duke lying beside him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Why under the piano?"</p>

<p>"Well," the boy returned, with grave sweetness, "I was just kind
of sitting here&mdash;thinking."</p>

<p>"All right." Mr. Schofield, rather touched, returned to the digestion
of a murder, his back once more to the piano; and Penrod silently
drew from beneath his jacket (where he had slipped it simultaneously
with the sneeze) a paper-backed volume entitled: "Slimsy, the
Sioux City Squealer, or, 'Not Guilty, Your Honor.'"</p>

<p>In this manner the reading-club continued in peace, absorbed,
contented, the world well forgot&mdash;until a sudden, violently irritated
slam-bang of the front door startled the members; and Mrs. Schofield
burst into the room and threw herself into a chair, moaning.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, mamma?" asked her husband laying aside his
paper.</p>

<p>"Henry Passloe Schofield," returned the lady, "I don't know what
IS to be done with that boy; I do <em>NOT</em>!"</p>

<p>"You mean Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Who else could I mean?" She sat up, exasperated, to stare at
him. "Henry Passloe Schofield, you've got to take this matter
in your hands&mdash;it's beyond me!"</p>

<p>"Well, what has he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Last night I got to thinking," she began rapidly, "about what
Clara told us&mdash;thank Heaven she and Margaret and little Clara
have gone to tea at Cousin Charlotte's!&mdash;but they'll be home soon&mdash;about
what she said about Miss Spence&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean about Penrod's being a comfort?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I kept thinking and thinking and thinking about it
till I couldn't stand it any&#11834;"</p>

<p>"By <em>GEORGE!" </em>shouted Mr. Schofield startlingly, stooping
to look under the piano. A statement that he had suddenly remembered
his son's presence would be lacking in accuracy, for the highly
sensitized Penrod was, in fact, no longer present. No more was
Duke, his faithful dog.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he returned, striding to the open window and looking
out. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Oh," she moaned, "it must be kept from Clara&mdash;and I'll never
hold up my head again if John Farry ever hears of it!"</p>

<p>"Hears of <em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, I just couldn't stand it, I got so curious; and I thought
of course if Miss Spence <em>HAD </em>become a little unbalanced
it was my duty to know it, as Penrod's mother and she his teacher;
so I thought I would just call on her at her apartment after school
and have a chat and see and I did and&mdash;oh&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I've just come from there, and she told me&mdash;she told me! Oh,
I've <em>NEVER </em>known anything like this!"</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT </em>did she tell you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Schofield, making a great effort, managed to assume a temporary
appearance of calm. "Henry," she said solemnly, "bear this in
mind: whatever you do to Penrod, it must be done in some place
when Clara won't hear it. But the first thing to do is to find
him."</p>

<p>Within view of the window from which Mr. Schofield was gazing
was the closed door of the storeroom in the stable, and just outside
this door Duke was performing a most engaging trick.</p>

<p>His young master had taught Duke to "sit up and beg" when he
wanted anything, and if that didn't get it, to "speak." Duke was
facing the closed door and sitting up and begging, and now he
also spoke&mdash;in a loud, clear bark.</p>

<p>There was an open transom over the door, and from this descended&mdash;hurled
by an unseen agency&mdash;a can half filled with old paint.</p>

<p>It caught the small besieger of the door on his thoroughly surprised
right ear, encouraged him to some remarkable acrobatics, and turned
large portions of him a dull blue. Allowing only a moment to perplexity,
and deciding, after a single and evidently unappetizing experiment,
not to cleanse himself of paint, the loyal animal resumed his
quaint, upright posture.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield seated himself on the window-sill, whence he could
keep in view that pathetic picture of unrequited love.</p>

<p>"Go on with your story, mamma," he said. "I think I can find
Penrod when we want him."</p>

<p>And a few minutes later he added, "And I think I know the place
to do it in."</p>

<p>Again the faithful voice of Duke was heard, pleading outside
the bolted door.</p>
