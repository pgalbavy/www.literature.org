A TRUMPETER, bravely leading on the soldiers, was captured by the
enemy.  He cried out to his captors, "Pray spare me, and do not
take my life without cause or without inquiry.  I have not slain
a single man of your troop.  I have no arms, and carry nothing
but this one brass trumpet."  "That is the very reason for which
you should be put to death," they said; "for, while you do not
fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others to battle."
