<p>It was well along in November. And Turkey Proudfoot was feeling
fidgetty. Whenever Farmer Green or the hired man stepped into the yard,
he started up with a wild look in his eye.
</p>
<p>Turkey Proudfoot was no longer roosting at night in the tree near the
farmhouse.
</p><p>With the coming of cold weather he had been glad enough to roost under a
shed beside the barn.
</p><p>Ever since the winter before, Turkey Proudfoot had enjoyed sound sleeps
at night. But for weeks now he had often waked up in the middle of the
night and found himself all a-shiver.
</p><p>"It's the fault of that horrid old Mr. Crow," Turkey Proudfoot
complained to old dog Spot one day. "He would talk about cranberry sauce
and drumsticks. And of course a person can't sleep well with such things
on his mind."
</p><p>Old dog Spot nodded.
</p><p>"Isn't it about time for you to go on your yearly vacation?" he
inquired.
</p><p>"Don't talk so loud!" Turkey Proudfoot hissed. And he took a quick
glance all around. Then he said to old dog Spot, in almost a whisper,
"To-morrow morning I'll be missing. Now, don't tell anybody!"
</p><p>"Certainly not!" Spot promised. "I'm glad you're going away for a little
change. I've thought lately that you were getting more peevish and
quarrelsome than ever."
</p><p>"I'm not!" Turkey Proudfoot gobbled. "I may be a bit excitable because
I've lost a good deal of sleep lately. But I'm as good-natured as I ever
was."
</p><p>"Oh, very well!" said Spot. "I'll admit all that. I certainly don't want
to quarrel with you just as you're going to leave us for a while.... We
shall miss you while you're gone," he added with a sly smile. "The place
will seem very quiet without your gobble."
</p><p>"Yes, I dare say it will be lonesome around here," Turkey Proudfoot
agreed. "And I suppose things will be in a muddle in the farmyard by the
time I get back, with nobody to keep order there."
</p><p>"I'll do the best I can while you're away," old dog Spot promised.
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot seemed doubtful that Spot could take his place.
</p><p>"Keep your tail still when you bark," he told the old dog. "These
farmyard fowls won't pay much attention to you if they see your tail
a-wagging."
</p><p>"I'll remember what you say," Spot answered.
</p><p>"Be sure to keep a sharp eye on that Rooster." Turkey Proudfoot went on.
"I don't want him to get the idea into his head that he's running things
in this, farmyard."
</p><p>"Very well!" said Spot. "Shall I let him crow a bit, if he wants to?"
</p><p>"Let him crow--yes!" Turkey Proudfoot answered. "But if he starts to
gobbling--well, you'd better send for me at once."
</p><p>"What about the Peacock?" Spot inquired wickedly. He knew that Turkey
Proudfoot was frightfully jealous of Johnnie Green's newest pet.
</p><p>"The Peacock!" Turkey Proudfoot squawked. "Pull out his tail
feathers--every one of them! I've been intending to do that myself. But
I've been so busy that I haven't had the time for it."
</p><p>Then they said good-by.
</p><p>"You ought to tell me where you're going," Spot suggested. "If the
Rooster should gobble I must know where to find you."
</p><p>So Turkey Proudfoot told him. He told him in such a low tone that nobody
else could hear.
