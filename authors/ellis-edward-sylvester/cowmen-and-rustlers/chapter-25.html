<p>In one important respect the combatants showed commendable discretion.
Although there had been considerable firing on the part of the
rustlers, none of the cattlemen were hurt. It is not unlikely
that the bullets were intended to frighten them, since such excellent
marksmen otherwise could not have discharged their weapons without
execution.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury and his men had not returned a shot. When their
enemies appeared on more than one side of the building it would
have been easy to pick off several without risk to those sheltered
within the house, but he gave orders that nothing of that sort
should be done.</p>

<p>The bitterness between the parties was already intense. There
were hot-heads on both sides eager to open the lamentable conflict,
but were it done, there was no saying where it would end. It was
wise, therefore, that the leaders forbore from active hostilities
at this early stage of the business.</p>

<p>From the front of the structure the plain stretched in the direction
of the Big Horn Mountains. It was across this that Jennie Whitney
descried, two days before, the return of her friends with the
body of her father. She now ascended to the second story and peered
long and frequently in the same direction, in the hope of catching
sight of her brother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Capt. Asbury disposed of the members of his party as
best he could. They needed no instructions from him to avoid in
every way possible annoying the ladies, who were considerate and
kind.</p>

<p>About midday, excitement was caused among the besieged by the
appearance of a flag of truce. A man rode over the ridge, down
which the cattlemen had come in such haste, holding a white handkerchief
fluttering over his head. His horse walked slowly and the rider
kept his gaze on the front of the house, as though in doubt of
the reception awaiting him. A hundred feet away he came to a halt,
still flourishing the peace signal above his hat.</p>

<p>Capt. Asbury was the first to discover the messenger and hurriedly
arranged for the interview.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as that fellow is neither Inman, Cadmus, nor anyone
of the leaders, it is not the thing for me to meet him."</p>

<p>"You have recognized him?" was the inquiring remark of Hawkridge,
glancing with a smile at the officer.</p>

<p>"No. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Duke Vesey, who does not feel particularly amiable toward you."</p>

<p>"I will meet him," volunteered Monteith Sterry. The captain shook
his head.</p>

<p>"While that fellow is friendly to you, perhaps, others of the
company are very resentful; it isn't best to tempt them. Hawkridge,
you are the best one to act."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will do so."</p>

<p>The horseman had come to a stop and was gazing fixedly at the
building, as if waiting for a response to his advance.</p>

<p>Jennie Whitney descended the stairs at this moment.</p>

<p>"I think I see Fred coming," she said, with some agitation; "will
they do him any harm?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sterry, "they have nothing against him."</p>

<p>"But the other day&mdash;" she ventured, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Was a scrimmage, likely to take place at any time; that is ended,
but they will probably hold him prisoner."</p>

<p>During this brief conversation a brisk search was going on among
the three men for a white pocket-handkerchief. None of them possessed
such an article, the hue in each case being different. Hawkridge
appealed to Miss Whitney, and she produced a linen handkerchief
of snowy whiteness.</p>

<p>"Just the thing," he said, drawing back the door sufficiently
to allow him to pass out. "I don't think I will be detained long.
It is understood," he added, turning to the captain, "that we
don't consider the question of surrender under any terms."</p>

<p>"It will be better to report, and then decide what to do."</p>

<p>Hawkridge bowed and passed out. He waved the spotless linen in
front of his face as he walked toward the horseman, and both smiled
when they recognized each other.</p>

<p>"Well, Duke, what is it?" asked the footman, as though he were
asking an ordinary question of a friend.</p>

<p>"I reckon you can guess. Since the two companies came together
Ira Inman is at the head of the army. Some of the boys are wild
to begin shooting, and they'll do it pretty soon. Before that,
Inman decided to offer you folks a chance to give in. That's my
business."</p>

<p>"You simply demand our surrender, as I understand it?"</p>

<p>"You've guessed it the first time," replied Vesey, with a nod
of his head.</p>

<p>"What terms do you offer?"</p>

<p>"You'll be treated as prisoners of war; but," added the rustler,
"it is hardly right to say that. It's Inman's idea to hold you
as hostages for the right treatment of any of our boys that may
fall into the hands of the stockmen."</p>

<p>"That is quite different. Let me ask, Duke, whether this treatment
is guaranteed to all of our folks?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could say it was, Dick, but I can't; Inman makes two
exceptions &mdash;Capt. Asbury and Mont Sterry. That Sterry showed
himself so much of a man and was so square toward me when I was
caught that I would do anything I could for him. I appealed to
Inman to let up on him, but he won't; some of the boys are so
mad they will shoot him on sight."</p>

<p>"And Capt. Asbury?"</p>

<p>Vesey's face became hard.</p>

<p>"He ought to be hanged because of the way he acted last night."</p>

<p>"But what is proposed to do with him and Sterry?"</p>

<p>"Give them a fair trial."</p>

<p>Hawkridge shook his head with a meaning smile.</p>

<p>"It won't work, Duke; there isn't a man in our company who would
consent to anything of the kind. There could be but one issue
to such a trial, and it would be nothing less than the betrayal
of our leader or a comrade by us."</p>

<p>"Inman declares he will burn down the house if you refuse his
terms."</p>

<p>"Let him try it as soon as he pleases; you can tell him for Capt.
Asbury that his terms are rejected."</p>
