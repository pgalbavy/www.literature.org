<p>The American leaned on the bottom of the slide, with his face
scarcely two feet from the other, and with the revolver at his
hip within instant reach.</p>

<p>"Captain Ortega, will you answer a question truly?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon the question, Señor; if I answer at all, it
shall be truly, but I may choose to leave it unanswered."</p>

<p>"Did you run this boat aground on purpose?"</p>

<p>Captain Ortega took two or three complacent whiffs, gazed off
over the moonlit river and then removing the wisp of tobacco from
between his lips, smiled, and looking into the face before him,
coolly replied:</p>

<p>"I did, Señor."</p>

<p>"It was after my warning to you."</p>

<p>"Begging pardon, Señor, it could not well have been before."</p>

<p>"What did you hope to accomplish?"</p>

<p>"To help General Yozarro to recover his boat."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I expected him to dash forward and board."</p>

<p>"He lacked the courage to attempt it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to agree with you."</p>

<p>"But he was wise; I kept one of the guns continually bearing
upon him and would have blown him and his men to kingdom come."</p>

<p>Again the Captain puffed his cigarette. He looked dreamily down
the river where the sailing craft had passed from sight.</p>

<p>"You would not have harmed General Yozarro or anyone in the boat."</p>

<p>"You are insulting, Captain; I could not have missed them."</p>

<p>"The port gun had no charge in it!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! is that the truth?" demanded the astounded American.</p>

<p>"You have only to examine the piece for yourself to learn that
it is."</p>

<p>"Did General Yozarro know it?"</p>

<p>The Captain puffed several times so hard that the point of fire
touched his mustache, then he impatiently flung the bit out of
the window. Superbly self-possessed as he was, he could not conceal
his anger.</p>

<p>"How could he help knowing it, when by his own orders the charge
was withdrawn before we left Atlamalco? What his whim was I didn't
ask and do not care."</p>

<p>"Knowing that, why did he hesitate?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied Captain Ortega with a sneer, "he feared you
might have learned the truth, and reloaded the gun. I had no way
of telling him different."</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>Looking straight in the eyes of the American, the Captain said:</p>

<p>"I am an Atlamalcan!"</p>

<p>"And the best of the lot! But, Captain, did you not fear I would
carry out my threat of shooting you when you ran the boat aground?"</p>

<p>"I expected you to <em>try</em> to do so, but I, too, should
have done some shooting also."</p>

<p>"You told me you were unarmed."</p>

<p>"And when I said I had no weapon on me, it was the truth, but
I did not tell you that I did not know where to lay hand on a
revolver whenever it should become necessary."</p>

<p>"I respect your frankness; I can suspect your plan, but may I
not hear it from your own lips?"</p>

<p>"I was on guard, and had you raised your weapon when standing
below, I should have fired my own first, and pardon me, Señor,
I should not have missed. Your two friends were also in fair range
and would have received my attention in the same moment."</p>

<p>"I must consider it fortunate that I did not act on my impulse,
for at no time did I fear anything of that nature from you. Having
refrained, what then was your plan?"</p>

<p>"I had not a doubt that General Yozarro would board, having every
reason to believe the port gun was empty, without any such thought
on your part. The moment he tried to do so, I should have left
the wheel and done what I could to help him; I think I should
have been able to give him some assistance, Señor &mdash;I beg
your pardon, I think I heard you called Major."</p>

<p>"Little doubt you would; it was that I feared more than anything
else, though I doubted your having a pistol. My fear of you was
my chief reason for trying to frighten them off from boarding."</p>

<p>Captain Ortega seemed to think the subject entertaining, for
he lit another cigarette&mdash;first offering the box to the American&mdash;crossed
his legs, leaned back at his leisure, looked smilingly up in the
American's face, and said in an even voice:</p>

<p>"It may be treason, Major, but General Yozarro is a coward! He
spoiled everything by refusing to attack, when nearly every man
in his boat was eager for it. When I was on the point of calling
to him that the gun was empty, he tumbled back in the boat at
your threat. I was so filled with contempt that I vowed I would
give him no help; I shall do nothing more to aid him, for, after
I opened the door, he was too scared to enter it. To prove I am
in earnest, Major, I now surrender my only weapon."</p>

<p>With which he drew out a beautiful silver-mounted revolver from
under his loose jacket and extended it, with the muzzle turned
toward himself, to the wondering American.</p>

<p>"I decline to take it, provided you will give me your parole
to remain neutral in whatever may occur while I am on this craft."</p>

<p>"You have my pledge," said the Captain, shoving the weapon back.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what General Yozarro is likely to do?"</p>

<p>"I can, but to do so, would be a violation of my neutrality."</p>

<p>"A fair hit!" laughed the American; "I spoke without thought,
but it will not touch the question of neutrality if you tell me
how much longer we are likely to remain fast in the mud."</p>

<p>"You may be aware that we feel the ocean tide to some extent
in this part of the Rio Rubio. Some time beyond midnight, if we
do not drive farther upon the shoal, the tide will lift us clear.
You may not have noticed, Major, that the screw has been driving
us forward most of the time, instead of backward. It is doing
so now, but with your permission, I will order the engineer to
reverse."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged! I heard you do that a good while ago."</p>

<p>"That signal was for <em>your</em> benefit; there was another
sent down the tube for the private ear of the engineer which you
did not hear."</p>
