1. THE WORLD DAWN
<P>
<P>
As yet those who may be counted as belonging definitely to the new 
religion are few and scattered and unconfessed, their realisations 
are still uncertain and incomplete.  But that is no augury for the 
continuance of this state of affairs even for the next few decades.  
There are many signs that the revival is coming very swiftly, it may 
be coming as swiftly as the morning comes after a tropical night.  
It may seem at present as though nothing very much were happening, 
except for the fact that the old familiar constellations of theology 
have become a little pallid and lost something of their multitude of 
points.  But nothing fades of itself.  The deep stillness of the 
late night is broken by a stirring, and the morning star of 
creedless faith, the last and brightest of the stars, the star that 
owes its light to the coming sun is in the sky.
<P>
There is a stirring and a movement.  There is a stir, like the stir 
before a breeze.  Men are beginning to speak of religion without the 
bluster of the Christian formulae; they have begun to speak of God 
without any reference to Omnipresence, Omniscience, Omnipotence.  
The Deists and Theists of an older generation, be it noted, never 
did that.  Their "Supreme Being" repudiated nothing.  He was merely 
the whittled stump of the Trinity.  It is in the last few decades 
that the western mind has slipped loose from this absolutist 
conception of God that has dominated the intelligence of Christendom 
at least, for many centuries.  Almost unconsciously the new thought 
is taking a course that will lead it far away from the moorings of 
Omnipotence.  It is like a ship that has slipped its anchors and 
drifts, still sleeping, under the pale and vanishing stars, out to 
the open sea. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. CONVERGENT RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS
<P>
<P>
In quite a little while the whole world may be alive with this 
renascent faith.
<P>
For emancipation from the Trinitarian formularies and from a belief 
in an infinite God means not merely a great revivification of minds 
trained under the decadence of orthodox Christianity, minds which 
have hitherto been hopelessly embarrassed by the choice between 
pseudo-Christian religion or denial, but also it opens the way 
towards the completest understanding and sympathy and participation 
with the kindred movements for release and for an intensification of 
the religious life, that are going on outside the sphere of the 
Christian tradition and influence altogether.  Allusion has already 
been made to the sympathetic devotional poetry of Rabindranath 
Tagore; he stands for a movement in Brahminism parallel with and 
assimilable to the worship of the true God of mankind.
<P>
It is too often supposed that the religious tendency of the East is 
entirely towards other-worldness, to a treatment of this life as an 
evil entanglement and of death as a release and a blessing.  It is 
too easily assumed that Eastern teaching is wholly concerned with 
renunciation, not merely of self but of being, with the escape from 
all effort of any sort into an exalted vacuity.  This is indeed 
neither the spirit of China nor of Islam nor of the every-day life 
of any people in the world.  It is not the spirit of the Sikh nor of 
these newer developments of Hindu thought.  It has never been the 
spirit of Japan.  To-day less than ever does Asia seem disposed to 
give up life and the effort of life.  Just as readily as Europeans, 
do the Asiatics reach out their arms to that fuller life we can 
live, that greater intensity of existence, to which we can attain by 
escaping from ourselves.  All mankind is seeking God.  There is not 
a nation nor a city in the globe where men are not being urged at 
this moment by the spirit of God in them towards the discovery of 
God.  This is not an age of despair but an age of hope in Asia as in 
all the world besides.
<P>
Islam is undergoing a process of revision closely parallel to that 
which ransacks Christianity.  Tradition and mediaeval doctrines are 
being thrust aside in a similar way.  There is much probing into the 
spirit and intention of the Founder.  The time is almost ripe for a 
heart-searching Dialogue of the Dead, "How we settled our religions 
for ever and ever," between, let us say, Eusebius of Caesarea and 
one of Nizam-al-Mulk's tame theologians.  They would be drawn 
together by the same tribulations; they would be in the closest 
sympathy against the temerity of the moderns; they would have a 
common courtliness.  The Quran is but little read by Europeans; it 
is ignorantly supposed to contain many things that it does not 
contain; there is much confusion in people's minds between its text 
and the ancient Semitic traditions and usages retained by its 
followers; in places it may seem formless and barbaric; but what it 
has chiefly to tell of is the leadership of one individualised 
militant God who claims the rule of the whole world, who favours 
neither rank nor race, who would lead men to righteousness.  It is 
much more free from sacramentalism, from vestiges of the ancient 
blood sacrifice, and its associated sacerdotalism, than 
Christianity.  The religion that will presently sway mankind can be 
reached more easily from that starting-point than from the confused 
mysteries of Trinitarian theology.  Islam was never saddled with a 
creed.  With the very name "Islam" (submission to God) there is no 
quarrel for those who hold the new faith. . . .
<P>
All the world over there is this stirring in the dry bones of the 
old beliefs.  There is scarcely a religion that has not its Bahaism, 
its Modernists, its Brahmo Somaj, its "religion without theology," 
its attempts to escape from old forms and hampering associations to 
that living and world-wide spiritual reality upon which the human 
mind almost instinctively insists. . . .
<P>
It is the same God we all seek; he becomes more and more plainly the 
same God.
<P>
So that all this religious stir, which seems so multifold and 
incidental and disconnected and confused and entirely ineffective 
to-day, may be and most probably will be, in quite a few years a 
great flood of religious unanimity pouring over and changing all 
human affairs, sweeping away the old priesthoods and tabernacles and 
symbols and shrines, the last crumb of the Orphic victim and the 
last rag of the Serapeum, and turning all men about into one 
direction, as the ships and houseboats swing round together in some 
great river with the uprush of the tide. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. CAN THERE BE A TRUE CHURCH?
<P>
<P>
Among those who are beginning to realise the differences and 
identities of the revived religion that has returned to them, 
certain questions of organisation and assembly are being discussed.  
Every new religious development is haunted by the precedents of the 
religion it replaces, and it was only to be expected that among 
those who have recovered their faith there should be a search for 
apostles and disciples, an attempt to determine sources and to form 
original congregations, especially among people with European 
traditions.
<P>
These dispositions mark a relapse from understanding.  They are 
imitative.  This time there has been no revelation here or there; 
there is no claim to a revelation but simply that God has become 
visible.  Men have thought and sought until insensibly the fog of 
obsolete theology has cleared away.  There seems no need therefore 
for special teachers or a special propaganda, or any ritual or 
observances that will seem to insist upon differences.  The 
Christian precedent of a church is particularly misleading.  The 
church with its sacraments and its sacerdotalism is the disease of 
Christianity.  Save for a few doubtful interpolations there is no 
evidence that Christ tolerated either blood sacrifices or the 
mysteries of priesthood.  All these antique grossnesses were 
superadded after his martyrdom.  He preached not a cult but a 
gospel; he sent out not medicine men but apostles.
<P>
No doubt all who believe owe an apostolic service to God.  They 
become naturally apostolic.  As men perceive and realise God, each 
will be disposed in his own fashion to call his neighbour's 
attention to what he sees.  The necessary elements of religion could 
be written on a post card; this book, small as it is, bulks large 
not by what it tells positively but because it deals with 
misconceptions.  We may (little doubt have I that we do) need 
special propagandas and organisations to discuss errors and keep 
back the jungle of false ideas, to maintain free speech and restrain 
the enterprise of the persecutor, but we do not want a church to 
keep our faith for us.  We want our faith spread, but for that there 
is no need for orthodoxies and controlling organisations of 
statement.  It is for each man to follow his own impulse, and to 
speak to his like in his own fashion.
<P>
Whatever religious congregations men may form henceforth in the name 
of the true God must be for their own sakes and not to take charge 
of religion.
<P>
The history of Christianity, with its encrustation and suffocation 
in dogmas and usages, its dire persecutions of the faithful by the 
unfaithful, its desiccation and its unlovely decay, its invasion by 
robes and rites and all the tricks and vices of the Pharisees whom 
Christ detested and denounced, is full of warning against the 
dangers of a church.  Organisation is an excellent thing for the 
material needs of men, for the draining of towns, the marshalling of 
traffic, the collecting of eggs, and the carrying of letters, the 
distribution of bread, the notification of measles, for hygiene and 
economics and suchlike affairs.  The better we organise such things, 
the freer and better equipped we leave men's minds for nobler 
purposes, for those adventures and experiments towards God's purpose 
which are the reality of life.  But all organisations must be 
watched, for whatever is organised can be "captured" and misused.  
Repentance, moreover, is the beginning and essential of the 
religious life, and organisations (acting through their secretaries 
and officials) never repent.  God deals only with the individual for 
the individual's surrender.  He takes no cognisance of committees.
<P>
Those who are most alive to the realities of living religion are 
most mistrustful of this congregating tendency.  To gather together 
is to purchase a benefit at the price of a greater loss, to 
strengthen one's sense of brotherhood by excluding the majority of 
mankind.  Before you know where you are you will have exchanged the 
spirit of God for ESPRIT DE CORPS.  You will have reinvented the 
SYMBOL; you will have begun to keep anniversaries and establish 
sacramental ceremonies.  The disposition to form cliques and exclude 
and conspire against unlike people is all too strong in humanity, to 
permit of its formal encouragement.  Even such organisation as is 
implied by a creed is to be avoided, for all living faith coagulates 
as you phrase it.  In this book I have not given so much as a 
definite name to the faith of the true God.  Organisation for 
worship and collective exaltation also, it may be urged, is of 
little manifest good.  You cannot appoint beforehand a time and 
place for God to irradiate your soul.
<P>
All these are very valid objections to the church-forming 
disposition.
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. ORGANISATIONS UNDER GOD
<P>
<P>
Yet still this leaves many dissatisfied.  They want to shout out 
about God.  They want to share this great thing with all mankind.
<P>
Why should they not shout and share?
<P>
Let them express all that they desire to express in their own 
fashion by themselves or grouped with their friends as they will.  
Let them shout chorally if they are so disposed.  Let them work in a 
gang if so they can work the better.  But let them guard themselves 
against the idea that they can have God particularly or exclusively 
with them in any such undertaking.  Or that so they can express God 
rather than themselves.
<P>
That I think states the attitude of the modern spirit towards the 
idea of a church.  Mankind passes for ever out of the idolatry of 
altars, away from the obscene rites of circumcision and symbolical 
cannibalism, beyond the sway of the ceremonial priest.  But if the 
modern spirit holds that religion cannot be organised or any 
intermediary thrust between God and man, that does not preclude 
infinite possibilities of organisation and collective action UNDER 
God and within the compass of religion.  There is no reason why 
religious men should not band themselves the better to attain 
specific ends.  To borrow a term from British politics, there is no 
objection to AD HOC organisations.  The objection lies not against 
subsidiary organisations for service but against organisations that 
may claim to be comprehensive.
<P>
For example there is no reason why one should not--and in many cases 
there are good reasons why one should--organise or join associations 
for the criticism of religious ideas, an employment that may pass 
very readily into propaganda.
<P>
Many people feel the need of prayer to resist the evil in themselves 
and to keep them in mind of divine emotion.  And many want not 
merely prayer but formal prayer and the support of others, praying 
in unison.  The writer does not understand this desire or need for 
collective prayer very well, but there are people who appear to do 
so and there is no reason why they should not assemble for that 
purpose.  And there is no doubt that divine poetry, divine maxims, 
religious thought finely expressed, may be heard, rehearsed, 
collected, published, and distributed by associations.  The desire 
for expression implies a sort of assembly, a hearer at least as well 
as a speaker.  And expression has many forms.  People with a strong 
artistic impulse will necessarily want to express themselves by art 
when religion touches them, and many arts, architecture and the 
drama for example, are collective undertakings.  I do not see why 
there should not be, under God, associations for building cathedrals 
and suchlike great still places urgent with beauty, into which men 
and women may go to rest from the clamour of the day's confusions; I 
do not see why men should not make great shrines and pictures 
expressing their sense of divine things, and why they should not 
combine in such enterprises rather than work to fill heterogeneous 
and chaotic art galleries.  A wave of religious revival and 
religious clarification, such as I foresee, will most certainly 
bring with it a great revival of art, religious art, music, songs, 
and writings of all sorts, drama, the making of shrines, praying 
places, tempies and retreats, the creation of pictures and 
sculptures.  It is not necessary to have priestcraft and an 
organised church for such ends.  Such enrichments of feeling and 
thought are part of the service of God.
<P>
And again, under God, there may be associations and fraternities for 
research in pure science; associations for the teaching and 
simplification of languages; associations for promoting and watching 
education; associations for the discussion of political problems and 
the determination of right policies.  In all these ways men may 
multiply their use by union.  Only when associations seek to control 
things of belief, to dictate formulae, restrict religious activities 
or the freedom of religious thought and teaching, when they tend to 
subdivide those who believe and to set up jealousies or exclusions, 
do they become antagonistic to the spirit of modern religion.
<P>
<P>
<P>
5. THE STATE IS GOD'S INSTRUMENT
<P>
<P>
Because religion cannot be organised, because God is everywhere and 
immediately accessible to every human being, it does not follow that 
religion cannot organise every other human affair.  It is indeed 
essential to the idea that God is the Invisible King of this round 
world and all mankind, that we should see in every government, great 
and small, from the council of the world-state that is presently 
coming, down to the village assembly, the instrument of God's 
practical control.  Religion which is free, speaking freely through 
whom it will, subject to a perpetual unlimited criticism, will be 
the life and driving power of the whole organised world.  So that if 
you prefer not to say that there will be no church, if you choose 
rather to declare that the world-state is God's church, you may have 
it so if you will.  Provided that you leave conscience and speech 
and writing and teaching about divine things absolutely free, and 
that you try to set no nets about God.
<P>
The world is God's and he takes it.  But he himself remains freedom, 
and we find our freedom in him.
<P>
<P>
<P>
THE ENVOY
<P>
<P>
So I end this compact statement of the renascent religion which I 
believe to be crystallising out of the intellectual, social, and 
spiritual confusions of this time.  It is an account rendered.  It 
is a statement and record; not a theory.  There is nothing in all 
this that has been invented or constructed by the writer; I have 
been but scribe to the spirit of my generation; I have at most 
assembled and put together things and thoughts that I have come 
upon, have transferred the statements of "science" into religious 
terminology, rejected obsolescent definitions, and re-coordinated 
propositions that had drifted into opposition.  Thus, I see, ideas 
are developing, and thus have I written them down.  It is a 
secondary matter that I am convinced that this trend of intelligent 
opinion is a discovery of truth.  The reader is told of my own 
belief merely to avoid an affectation of impartiality and aloofness.
<P>
The theogony here set forth is ancient; one can trace it appearing 
and disappearing and recurring in the mutilated records of many 
different schools of speculation; the conception of God as finite is 
one that has been discussed very illuminatingly in recent years in 
the work of one I am happy to write of as my friend and master, that 
very great American, the late William James.  It was an idea that 
became increasingly important to him towards the end of his life.  
And it is the most releasing idea in the system.
<P>
Only in the most general terms can I trace the other origins of 
these present views.  I do not think modern religion owes much to 
what is called Deism or Theism.  The rather abstract and futile 
Deism of the eighteenth century, of "votre Etre supreme" who bored 
the friends of Robespierre, was a sterile thing, it has little 
relation to these modern developments, it conceived of God as an 
infinite Being of no particular character whereas God is a finite 
being of a very especial character.  On the other hand men and women 
who have set themselves, with unavoidable theological 
preconceptions, it is true, to speculate upon the actual teachings 
and quality of Christ, have produced interpretations that have 
interwoven insensibly with thoughts more apparently new.  There is a 
curious modernity about very many of Christ's recorded sayings.  
Revived religion has also, no doubt, been the receiver of many 
religious bankruptcies, of Positivism for example, which failed 
through its bleak abstraction and an unspiritual texture.  Religion, 
thus restated, must, I think, presently incorporate great sections 
of thought that are still attached to formal Christianity.  The time 
is at hand when many of the organised Christian churches will be 
forced to define their positions, either in terms that will identify 
them with this renascence, or that will lead to the release of their 
more liberal adherents.  Its probable obligations to Eastern thought 
are less readily estimated by a European writer.
<P>
Modern religion has no revelation and no founder; it is the 
privilege and possession of no coterie of disciples or exponents; it 
is appearing simultaneously round and about the world exactly as a 
crystallising substance appears here and there in a super-saturated 
solution.  It is a process of truth, guided by the divinity in men.  
It needs no other guidance, and no protection.  It needs nothing but 
freedom, free speech, and honest statement.  Out of the most mixed 
and impure solutions a growing crystal is infallibly able to select 
its substance.  The diamond arises bright, definite, and pure out of 
a dark matrix of structureless confusion.
<P>
This metaphor of crystallisation is perhaps the best symbol of the 
advent and growth of the new understanding.  It has no church, no 
authorities, no teachers, no orthodoxy.  It does not even thrust and 
struggle among the other things; simply it grows clear.  There will 
be no putting an end to it.  It arrives inevitably, and it will 
continue to separate itself out from confusing ideas.  It becomes, 
as it were the Koh-i-noor; it is a Mountain of Light, growing and 
increasing.  It is an all-pervading lucidity, a brightness and 
clearness.  It has no head to smite, no body you can destroy; it 
overleaps all barriers; it breaks out in despite of every enclosure.  
It will compel all things to orient themselves to it.
<P>
It comes as the dawn comes, through whatever clouds and mists may be 
here or whatever smoke and curtains may be there.  It comes as the 
day comes to the ships that put to sea.
<P>
It is the Kingdom of God at hand.
