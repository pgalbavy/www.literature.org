<p>The question for the moment took away the breath of the American.
He looked into the crimson, flabby countenance and wondered if
the man was in earnest. He was. By great effort, Major Starland
held back the laugh tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, pulling himself together and speaking slowly,
"perhaps you come, say within a thousand miles of each. I don't
see how the distance can be shortened."</p>

<p>"That depends upon the place you give others," blandly observed
the Dictator, who accepted the rating as a compliment; "where
do you place General Bolivar?"</p>

<p>"I should have to make careful calculation; he might come within
a mile or two, but remember that the modern world has not yet
produced the peer of George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, nor
do I see any signs that she is likely to do so. Have you been
figuring on a comparison yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am too modest to claim to stand on the same plane with either
of your great heroes, but reflection convinces me that I have
been selected by heaven to be the successor of General Simon Bolivar."</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as to when?" said the Major gravely.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon; I do not understand your question, Major."</p>

<p>"I wait for you to explain <em>your</em> meaning: what is your
ambition?"</p>

<p>"It is to form a grand confederation of South American states;
as you know, our continent is divided into no end of petty republics.
Why should they not unite into one powerful, resistless whole?"</p>

<p>"The only obstacle is themselves; each country is so jealous
of every other that it prefers to fight rather than to fuse. Zalapata
and Atlamalco are illustrations; they are continually quarreling
and at war over trifles that would shame a couple of schoolboys."</p>

<p>"All that is ended; henceforth General Yozarro and I are brothers,
and the two republics will join hands in the path of progress.
Our example will be quickly followed by Venezuela, by Colombia,
by Ecuador, by Bolivia, by Brazil and all the states down to and
including Patagonia. Will not that be the grandest confederation
the world ever saw?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly&mdash;when it is formed. Is the conception your own,
General?"</p>

<p>"It is; it has been forming in my mind for weeks and months;
more than once I was in despair, and not until last evening did
the splendor of the scheme burst upon me in all its fulness."</p>

<p>"You are dreaming what others dreamed before you, but the only
one who made a fair start toward its realization was Simon Bolivar,
and he died disappointed and brokenhearted. I suppose the first
step will be to send ambassadors, or whatever you choose to call
them, to the different republics of South America, proposing a
meeting of representatives to consider the great scheme?"</p>

<p>"That will be the first step. It will take some time for a full
exchange of views, and a committee will be named from each government
to draw up the plan for confederation."</p>

<p>"Your scheme contemplates that this union shall be a republic,
like my own country?"</p>

<p>"No other form can flourish in the clear sunlight of liberty
of South America."</p>

<p>"Not the least important step, after the plan has been formulated,
will be the choice of the Chief Magistrate; who should he be?"</p>

<p>The American knew what was coming, but the enjoyment of prodding
the bulky ignoramus was none the less exquisite.</p>

<p>"The thoughts of all would naturally turn to the man who originated
the grand scheme; they would feel profound gratitude, and inquire
whether he is competent to carry out the plan and make the dream
a realization; an immense majority will insist that the responsibility
and honor shall go to him."</p>

<p>"And in that case you would be the man?"</p>

<p>The little head wabbled forward on the short neck.</p>

<p>"There can be no forecasting the whims of the public; the hero
of today is the traitor of tomorrow, and vice versa; suppose some
one other than you should be fixed upon; suppose General Yozarro
should be called to the head of the confederation?"</p>

<p>The crimson countenance became more crimson; the breaths shifted
to pants, and the tiny eyes twinkled with a sinister light.</p>

<p>"Impossible! Such an outrage can never be."</p>

<p>"Let us assume that it does come about; it is best, you know,
to consider all sides of an important question."</p>

<p>"I would never consent! I would withdraw from the union! I would
shatter the whole scheme, if I were treated with such shameless
ingratitude."</p>

<p>"You forget that each republic would bring forth its own particular
crop of favorite sons, and you would stand no more chance of selection
than I. You declare yourself warmly in favor of the confederation;
which do you place the higher,&mdash;the beneficent scheme itself or
your own ambition?"</p>

<p>"It is not ambition, sir, but simple justice that I demand <em>and
will have</em>!"</p>

<p>"Do you consider yourself the only man on the South American
continent qualified to be the president of such a union?"</p>

<p>"By no means; there are plenty beside me, but none with such
paramount claims to the honor."</p>

<p>"Admitting this, our own Washington or Lincoln, or any one of
our leaders, was ready at all times to lay down his office for
the good of his country; that, and only that spirit, is true patriotism;
I don't believe there are ten native men between Nicaragua and
the Straits of Magellan, who have ever experienced the feeling.
Your strongest republics refuse to pay their just debts, and when
England, Germany and some of the European Powers try to compel
them to be honest, they bellow over the Monroe Doctrine and are
ready to fight the United States because she won't come down and
help them play the defaulter.</p>

<p>"No, General; the first step toward the success of your scheme
is an impossible one; that is, the reconstruction and making over
of the <em>genus</em> South American. When somewhere a so-called
republic is set up, and a President elected for a term strictly
defined by its Constitution, the President refuses to go out of
office at the close of that term and starts a revolution. Several
others with a similar ambition do the same, and there you have
the normal republic in this part of the world. Atlamalco, Zalapata
and most of your governments are simply world's nuisances."</p>

<p>"Your statements, sir, are not only false but insulting; I have
more faith in my patriotic countrymen than you, for I know them
better; they are brave, unselfish, long suffering&#11834;"</p>

<p>General Bambos had progressed thus far in his speech, when he
emitted a rasping shriek, clapped his hand behind him and made
so tremendous a leap that his crown bumped against the ceiling
of the cabin. At the same time, the tenor of his remarks abruptly
changed, and he danced and rubbed with pain. One of the pestilent
"fire ants" of his country had managed to snuggle among the crevices
of the lounge, and its nip was like that of a red hot pair of
pincers.</p>
