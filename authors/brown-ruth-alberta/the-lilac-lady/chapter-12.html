<p>"Oh, Elspeth, you can't guess where I've been!" shrieked Peace,
puffing with excitement as she stumbled up the steps after her
long run home.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you were playing with Giuseppe and the Lilac
Lady," replied the young mother, looking up in surprise from the
little white dress she was hemstitching.</p>

<p>"But I went down to the drug store to telephone grandma!"</p>

<p>"I know you did, but I thought you stopped to tell the news at
the stone house on your way home."</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"That the invalids have run away and left you."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"The postman came just after you left, and he brought a letter
from Dr. Campbell, explaining all about it."</p>

<p>"Then he did take time to write, did he? I was pretty hot about
it at first," Peace admitted candidly, "But I don't care at all
now. I've had such a splendid time here with you all the while
they've been shut up sick, that no matter how long they stay in
the Pine Woods, it couldn't make up for all they've missed by
not being me."</p>

<p>"Do you really feel that way about it, dear?" cried Elizabeth,
much pleased and touched at the child's unlooked-for declaration.</p>

<p>"You just better b'lieve I do! Why, I've had just the nicest
time! I 'xpected I'd miss seeing the girls just dreadfully, but
Gail and Faith have come up every single week, and I've telephoned
home 'most every day, and the rest of the time has been filled
so full that I haven't minded how long I've been away at all.
This must be my other home, I guess."</p>

<p>"You little sweetheart! I wonder if you have any idea how much
we are going to miss you when grandpa takes you away again."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I 'magine I do. I make such a racket wherever I go
that when I leave, the stillness seems like a hole. But don't
you fret! I'm coming up here real often&mdash;just as often as grandma
will let me. 'Cause I've got not only you to visit now, but the
Lilac Lady and Juiceharpie and the Home children &mdash;Oh, that's
what I started to tell you about when I first came up.</p>

<p>"I've just been there. I never knew there was a Home so near
here, or I'd have been there before this. And what do you think?
There's a girl living in it named Lottie, which looks so much
like me that when we changed aprons the other children didn't
know the difference at first. They think she must be my twin sister
or some cousin I don't know anything about, though I kept telling
them there weren't any cousins in our family, and if mother'd
ever had twins, she'd have kept 'em both and not throwed one away
to grow up without knowing who her people were. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"I most assuredly do," Elizabeth answered promptly. "Gail has
often told me that your papa was an only child, and the one brother
your mamma had died when he was a little fellow. So there can't
be any near cousins, and you are not a twin, so Lottie isn't your
sister. How did it all come about?"</p>

<p>The story was quickly told, to Elizabeth's mingled amusement
and horror; and Peace ended by sagely remarking, "So I'm going
to ask Allee if she's willing that we should use some of our Fourth
of July money to buy them a treat of sugar and butter for a whole
day&mdash;or a week, if it doesn't take too much, and grandpa don't
sit down on the plan. I don't think he will, 'cause these children
aren't fakes. They really d'serve having some good times 'casionally,
and it did make them so happy to have someone extra to play with.
I s'pose they get awfully tired of fighting the same children
all the time. Besides, we've got lots of money in our bank, 'cause
we used only about ten dollars of our furnishing money to dec'rate
our room with, and the rest we saved for patriotism. I am awful
glad there are such places for poor children to go to when their
own people can't take care of 'em, but I do wish the Lady Boards
weren't so stingy."</p>

<p>Elizabeth knew it would do no good to argue the matter, and besides,
she was not well posted concerning this particular Home, so she
merely agreed that Peace's plan would no doubt make the little
folks happy, but wisely suggested that she say no more about it
until she had consulted with the family at home and received their
consent. "Because, you see, dear, if you make some rash promises
which you can't fulfill, it will only make the children unhappy,
instead of bringing sunshine into their lives."</p>

<p>"But isn't it a good way to spend money? They ain't beggars with
bank accounts somewhere, like the old woman which got Gail's dollar
last spring."</p>

<p>"I think it is a very nice way, dearie, and I am sure grandpa
will not object a mite; but the best way is not to make any promises
that we don't intend to carry out, or that we are not sure we
can fulfill. Then no one will be disappointed if our plans don't
come through the way we hoped they would. Do you see what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes; never promise to do <em>anything</em> until you're sure
you can. But that would keep me from doing lots of things, Elspeth.
I could not ever promise to be good, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace, I didn't mean that!" Elizabeth never could get accustomed
to this literal streak in the small maiden's character; and, in
consequence, her little preachments often received an unexpected
shower-bath. "I meant not to promise to do favors for other folks
unless we can and will see that they are done."</p>

<p>"Ain't it a favor to be good when it's easier and naturaler to
be bad&mdash;not really bad, either, but just yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, dear. We ought to <em>try</em> to be good without anyone's
asking us to, and just because it is easier to do wrong than right
is no excuse for us at all."</p>

<p>Unconsciously she said this very severely, for she thought she
heard Saint John chuckling behind the curtains of the study window;
but Peace interpreted the lecture literally, and hastily jumping
up from the step, said, "I think I'll go and tell the Lilac Lady
about the children, and see if she hasn't got more roses than
she knows what to do with, 'cause I know they'd like 'em at the
Home. Do you care?"</p>

<p>"No, Peace. Glen is asleep. But don't stay long, for it is nearly
five o'clock now, and tea will soon be ready."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll bring you some roses for the table if she has
any to spare today, and she ought to, 'cause the pink and white
bushes have just begun to open."</p>

<p>She whisked out of sight around the corner in a twinkling, and
was soon perched on the stool beside the lame girl's chair, regaling
her with an account of the afternoon's adventures.</p>

<p>The white signal fluttering from the lilac bushes had been discarded
long ago, and Peace was welcome whenever she came now, for with
her peculiar childish instinct, she seemed to know when the invalid
found her chatter wearisome. At such times she would sit in the
grass beside the chair, silently weaving clover chains, or wander
quietly about the premises, revelling in the beauty and perfume
of the garden flowers, or better still, whistling softly the sweet
tunes which the pain-racked body always found so soothing.</p>

<p>But this afternoon the young mistress of the stone house was
lonely, for Aunt Pen and Giuseppe were in town shopping, and she
wished to be amused; so Peace was doubly welcome, and felt very
much flattered at the attention her lengthy story received. To
tell the truth of the matter, the lame girl had just discovered
how cunningly the small, round face was dimpled, and in watching
these little Cupid's love kisses come and go with the child's
different expressions and moods, she did not hear a word that
was said until Peace heaved a great, sympathetic sigh, and closed
her tale with the remark, "And so I'm going to see if I can't
take them some&mdash;enough to last a week maybe&mdash;for it must be <em>dreadful</em>
to eat bread and potatoes every day without any butter or gravy."</p>

<p>The older girl roused herself with a start, and promptly began
asking questions in such an adroit fashion that in a moment or
two she had the gist of the whole story, and was much interested
in the picture Peace drew of the Home children's life. "Why, do
you know, I used to go there with Aunt Pen&mdash;years ago&mdash;to carry
flowers and trinkets, and sometimes to sing. My! How glad they
used to be! They would sit and listen with eyes and mouths wide
open as if they simply couldn't get enough. Aunt Pen used to be
quite interested in the Home. Poor Aunt Pen! She gave up all her
pet hobbies when I was hurt."</p>

<p>"Didn't you like to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was flattering to have such an appreciative audience,
of course; but&mdash;my ambitions soared higher than that. They were
as well satisfied with a hand-organ."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tony ain't! And neither is Ethel! They both just <em>love</em>
music, and they kept me whistling until I was tired. And how they
do love stories! I 'magined for them till my thinker ran empty.
I couldn't help wishing I was you, so's I could tell them all
the beau-ti-ful fancies you make up as you lie here under the
trees day in and day out. I told 'em about you and pictured this
garden for 'em, and the flowers which Hicks cuts by the <em>bushel-basket</em>,
and Juiceharpie which plays the fiddle and dances and sings like
a cheer-up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cherub, do you mean? Giuseppe is inconsolable to think he
can't teach you to say his name correctly."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm the same thing to think he's got such a name that
won't be said right. He doesn't like Jessup any better. But never
mind, I know he'd like Tony and the other Home boys; and I thought
maybe you would let him go some day and play for the children
there. Miss Chase is awfully sweet and nice, even if she is fat,
and she'd be tickled to pieces to give him a permit any time he
could come."</p>

<p>The lame girl laid a thin, waxen hand on the curly head bobbing
so enthusiastically at her side, and murmured gently, "How do
you think up so many beautiful things to do for other people?"</p>

<p>"I don't," Peace frankly replied. "I guess they just think themselves.
You see, I know what it is to be poor and not have nice things
like other folks, and now that grandpa's taken us home to live
with him in a great, big house where there's always plenty and
enough to spare, seems like it was just the proper thing to give
some of it away to make the less <em>forchinit</em> a little happier.
It takes <em>such</em> a little to make folks smile!"</p>

<p>"Indeed it does, little philosopher. Your name should have been
Lady Bountiful. Giuseppe may go with you to the Home as often
as he wishes with his violin, and help you make them happy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're such a darling!" cried Peace in ecstasy, hugging
the hand between her own pink palms. "I wish you could go, too.
Tony says they have song services every Sunday afternoon, and
they are great! I'm to go next Sunday and hear them, but I wish
you could, too."</p>

<p>"You are very generous," murmured the lame girl a trifle huskily.
Then&mdash;perhaps it was because Peace's enthusiasm was contagious,
perhaps it was due to a growing desire in her own heart for the
world from which she had shut herself so long ago&mdash;the older girl
suddenly electrified her companion by adding, "I should like to
hear them myself. Do you think the matron would allow them to
visit me in my garden, seeing that I can't go to the Home as other
folks do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Every word!"</p>

<p>"Miss Chase couldn't say no to anything so beautiful, and I don't
think the Lady Boards would object, either; but I'll find out.
Saint John can tell me, I'm sure. Oh, I never dreamed of anything
so lovely! I wouldn't have <em>dared</em> dream it!" She hugged
herself in rapture, and her eyes beamed like stars. How grand
it was to have friends like the Lilac Lady!</p>

<p>So it came about that a few days later fifty shining-faced, bright-eyed
boys and girls from the Home marched proudly up Hill Street and
in through the great iron gates to the Enchanted Garden, where
the lame girl, with Aunt Pen and the parsonage household to assist
her, waited to greet them.</p>

<p>That was a gala day, talked about for weeks afterward, dreamed
of in the silent watches of the night, and recorded in memory's
treasure book to be lived over again and again in later years,&mdash;one
of those heart's delights, the fragrance of which never dies.</p>

<p>The Home children were charmed with the beautiful garden and
its cool fountain, just as Peace had known they would be, and
the frail young hostess was as charmed with her guests. They had
games on the wide lawn, they sang their sweet, happy choruses,
Giuseppe played and danced, Peace and the preacher whistled, Elizabeth
told them stories, and Aunt Pen surprised them all by serving
sparkling frappé with huge slices of fig cake, such as only Minnie,
the cook, could make. Then, as the afternoon drew to a close,
and the matron began lining up her charges for the homeward walk,
Tony and Lottie stepped out of the ranks and sang a pretty little
verse of thanks for the good time all had enjoyed.</p>

<p>So surprised was the Lilac Lady at this unexpected little turn,
that for an instant her eyes grew misty with unshed tears; then
she smiled happily, and obeying a sudden impulse, she lifted her
voice and carolled,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Come again, my little friends,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have brought me joy today;<br/>
In my heart you've left a hymn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That shall linger, live alway."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Oh, my!" cried Peace, squeezing Elizabeth's hand in her astonishment
and pleasure, "is it an angel singing?"</p>

<p>"Your Lilac Lady, dear. Didn't you know she could sing?"</p>

<p>"She told me she used to once, but I never heard her before."</p>

<p>"At college she was our lark. How we loved that voice! I think,
little girl, you have saved a soul."</p>

<p>But Peace did not hear the words. She was joining in the wild
applause that greeted this burst of melody from the long silent
throat. Everyone had been taken by surprise, the children were
dancing with delight, the matron's homely face was beaming, Aunt
Pen's lips worked pathetically, and Hicks, still busy filling
small arms with the choicest flowers from the garden, could only
whisper over and over again, "Praise be, praise be, she has found
her voice!"</p>

<p>The Lilac Lady herself seemed almost unconscious of the fact
that she had torn down this last and strongest barrier between
self and the world, and if she noticed the pathetic surprise on
the loving faces hovering about her, she did not show it, but
smiled serenely and naturally when the applause had died away.
She would sing no more that afternoon, however, and the little
visitors had to be contented with a promise of another song the
next time they came. So they said good-bye to their charming hostess
and filed happily down the walk to the street.</p>

<p>As the iron gates closed behind the little company homeward bound,
Peace turned to blow a good-night kiss between the high palings
to the young mistress, lying in her chair where they had left
her, but paused enraptured by the picture her eyes beheld. A rosy
ray of the setting sun filtered through the oak boughs overhanging
her couch and fell full upon the white face among the cushions,
bringing out the rich auburn tints of the heavy hair till it almost
seemed as if a crown of gleaming gold rested upon her head, and
the wonderful blue eyes reflected the light like sea-water, clear
and deep and&mdash;unfathomable.</p>

<p>"Oh," whispered Peace, thrilling with delight, "I ought to have
called her my <em>Angel</em> Lady!"</p>
