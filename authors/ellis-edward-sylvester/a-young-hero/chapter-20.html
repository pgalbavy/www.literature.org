<p>Between nine and ten o'clock on the Saturday evening succeeding
the incidents I have described, a wagon similar to the one wrecked
the night before, drove out of Tottenville with two persons on
the front seat.</p>

<p>The driver was Jacob Kincade, who, having safely passed the recaptured
lion over to Colonel Bandman, secured a couple of days' leave
of absence and hurried back to Tottenville, where he engaged the
team, and, accompanied by Bud Heyland, drove out in the direction
of the wood where matters went so unsatisfactorily when Bud assumed
charge.</p>

<p>"I was awful 'fraid you wouldn't come to time," said Bud, when
they were fairly beyond the village, "which is why I tried to
run the machine myself and got things mixed. Sutton insisted on
waiting till you arriv', but when he seen how sot I was he give
in and 'greed to meet me at the place."</p>

<p>"That was all well enough," observed Mr. Kincade; "but there's
some things you tell me which I don't like. You said some one
was listening behind the fence the other night when you and Sutton
was talking about this business."</p>

<p>"That's so; but Sutton showed me afterwards that the man, who
was short and stumpy, couldn't have heard anything that would
let him know what he was driving at. We have a way of talking
that anybody else might hear every word and yet he wouldn't understand
it. That's an idee of mine."</p>

<p>"But you said some one&mdash;and I've no doubt it's the same chap&mdash;was
whistling round the wood last night and scared you, so you made
up your mind to wait till to-night."</p>

<p>"That rather got me, but Sut says that no man that 'spected anything
wrong would go whistling round the woods in that style. That ain't
the way detectives do."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but are you sure there ain't any of them detectives
about?"</p>

<p>"Me and Sut have been on the watch, and there hasn't been a stranger
in the village that we don't know all about. That's the biggest
joke I ever heard of," laughed Bud, "that 'ere Jackson going out
to Walsingham and arresting the colonel and Gibby."</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Kincade, "it took place just as I was coming away.
I wish they'd locked up the colonel for awhile, just for the fun
of the thing. But he and Gibby were discharged at once. I came
on in the same train with Jackson, though I didn't talk with him
about it, for I saw he felt pretty cheap.</p>

<p>"However," added Kincade, "that's got nothing to do with this
business, which I feel a little nervous over. It was a mighty
big load for us to get out in the wood last Monday night, and
I felt as though my back was broke when we put the last piece
in the tree. S'pose somebody has found it!"</p>

<p>"No danger of that," said Bud. "I was out there to-day and seen
that it was all right."</p>

<p>"Sure nobody was watching you?"</p>

<p>"I took good care of that. We'll find it there just as we left
it, and after we get it into the wagon we'll drive over to Tom
Carmen's and he'll dispose of it for us."</p>

<p>Tom Carmen lived at the "Four Corners," as the place was called,
and had the reputation of being engaged in more than one kind
of unlawful business. It was about ten miles off, and the thieves
intended to drive there and place their plunder in his hands,
he agreeing to melt it up and give them full value, less a small
commission for his services.</p>

<p>The arrangement with Carmen had not been made until after the
robbery, which accounts for the hiding of the spoils for several
days. It did not take long, however, to come to an understanding
with him, and the plunder would have been taken away the preceding
night by Bud Heyland and Cyrus Sutton but for the mishaps already
mentioned.</p>

<p>"You're sure Sutton will be there?" asked Kincade, as they approached
the wood.</p>

<p>"You can depend on him every time," was the confident response;
"he was to go out after dark to make sure that no one else is
prowling around. He's one of the best fellows I ever met," added
Bud, who was enthusiastic over his new acquaintance; "we've fixed
up half a dozen schemes that we're going into as soon as we get
this off our hands."</p>

<p>"Am I in?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Bud; "the gang is to be us three, and each
goes in on the ground floor. We're going to make a bigger pile
than Colonel Bandman himself, even with all his menagerie and
circus."</p>

<p>"I liked Sutton&mdash;what little I seen of him," said Kincade.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's true blue&mdash;well, here we are."</p>

<p>Both ceased talking as they entered the shadow of the wood, for,
bad as they were, they could not help feeling somewhat nervous
over the prospect.</p>

<p>The weather had been clear and pleasant all the week, and the
stars were shining in an unclouded sky, in which there was no
moon. A few minutes after they met a farmer's wagon, which was
avoided with some difficulty, as it was hard to see each other,
but the two passed in safety, and reached the spot they had in
mind.</p>

<p>Here Bud Heyland took the reins, because he knew the place so
well, and drew the horse aside until he and the vehicle would
clear any team that might come along.</p>

<p>To prevent any such accident as that of the preceding night the
animal was secured, and the man and big boy stepped carefully
a little further into the wood, Bud uttering the same signal as
before.</p>

<p>It was instantly answered from a point near at hand, and the
next minute Cyrus Sutton came forward, faintly visible as he stepped
close to them and spoke:</p>

<p>"I've been waiting more than two hours, and thought I heard you
coming a half dozen times."</p>

<p>He shook hands with Kincade and Bud, the latter asking:</p>

<p>"Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've had my eyes open, you may depend."</p>

<p>"Will there be any risk in leaving the horse here?" asked Kincade.</p>

<p>"None at all&mdash;no one will disturb him."</p>

<p>"Then we had better go on, for there's a pretty good load to
carry."</p>

<p>"I guess I can find the way best," said Bud, taking the lead.
"I've been over the route so often I can follow it with my eyes
shut."</p>

<p>Sutton was also familiar with it, and though it cost some trouble
and not a little care, they advanced without much difficulty.
Bud regretted that he had not brought his bull's eye lantern with
him, and beyond question it would have been of service, but Sutton
said it might attract attention, and it was better to get along
without it if possible.</p>

<p>The distance was considerable, and all of half an hour was taken
in making their way through the wood, the darkness being such
in many places that they had to hold their hands in front of them
to escape collision with limbs and trunks of trees.</p>

<p>"Here we are!"</p>

<p>It was Bud Heyland who spoke, and in the dim light his companions
saw that he was right. There was a small, natural clearing, which
enabled them to observe the blasted oak without difficulty.</p>

<p>The little party stood close by the hiding-place of the plunder
that had been taken from the old brick mansion several nights
before.</p>

<p>"You can reach down to it, can't you?" asked Sutton, addressing
Bud Heyland.</p>

<p>"Yes; it's only a little ways down."</p>

<p>"Hand it out, then," added Kincade; "I shan't feel right till
we have all this loot safely stowed away with Tom Carmen at the
'Four Corners.'"</p>

<p>"All right," responded Bud, who immediately thrust his head and
shoulders into the cavity.</p>

<p>He remained in this bent position less than a minute, when he
jerked out his head as though some serpent had struck at him with
his fangs, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It's all gone!"</p>

<p>"What?" gasped Jake Kincade.</p>

<p>"Somebody has taken everything away&#11834;"</p>

<p>In the dim light, Bud Heyland at that juncture observed something
which amazed him still more. Instead of two men there were three,
and two of them were struggling fiercely together.</p>

<p>These were Cyrus Sutton and Jacob Kincade, but the struggle was
short. In a twinkling the showman was thrown on his back, and
the nippers placed on his wrists.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Sutton, as he had called himself, in a low
voice; "the game is up, Jacob."</p>

<p>Before Bud Heyland could understand that he and Kincade were
entrapped, the third man sprang forward and manipulated the handcuffs
so dexterously that Bud quickly realized he was a helpless captive.</p>

<p>This third man was Archie Jackson, the constable, who could not
avoid declaring in a louder voice than was necessary.</p>

<p>"We've got you both, and you may as well take it like men. This
gentleman whom you two took for Cyrus Sutton, a cattle drover,
is my old friend James Carter, the detective, from New York."</p>

<p>And such was the truth indeed.</p>
