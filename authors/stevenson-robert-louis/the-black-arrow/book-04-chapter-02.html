<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Sir Daniel's residence in Shoreby was a tall, commodious, plastered
mansion, framed in carven oak, and covered by a low-pitched roof of
thatch. To the back there stretched a garden, full of fruit-trees,
alleys, and thick arbours, and overlooked from the far end by the tower
of the abbey church.
</p><p>The house might contain, upon a pinch, the retinue of a greater person
than Sir Daniel; but even now it was filled with hubbub. The court rang
with arms and horseshoe-iron; the kitchens roared with cookery like a
bees'-hive; minstrels, and the players of instruments, and the cries of
tumblers, sounded from the hall. Sir Daniel, in his profusion, in the
gaiety and gallantry of his establishment, rivalled with Lord Shoreby,
and eclipsed Lord Risingham.
</p><p>All guests were made welcome. Minstrels, tumblers, players of chess, the
sellers of relics, medicines, perfumes, and enchantments, and along with
these every sort of priest, friar, or pilgrim, were made welcome to the
lower table, and slept together in the ample lofts, or on the bare
boards of the long dining-hall.
</p><p>On the afternoon following the wreck of the <u>Good Hope</u>, the buttery,
the kitchens, the stables, the covered cartshed that surrounded two
sides of the court, were all crowded by idle people, partly belonging to
Sir Daniel's establishment, and attired in his livery of murrey and
blue, partly nondescript strangers attracted to the town by greed, and
received by the knight through policy, and because it was the fashion of
the time.
</p><p>The snow, which still fell without interruption, the extreme chill of
the air, and the approach of night, combined to keep them under shelter.
Wine, ale, and money were all plentiful; many sprawled gambling in the
straw of the barn, many were still drunken from the noontide meal. To
the eye of a modern it would have looked like the sack of a city; to the
eye of a contemporary it was like any other rich and noble household at
a festive season.
</p><p>Two monks--a young and an old--had arrived late, and were now warming
themselves at a bonfire in a corner of the shed. A mixed crowd
surrounded them--jugglers, mountebanks, and soldiers; and with these the
elder of the two had soon engaged so brisk a conversation, and exchanged
so many loud guffaws and country witticisms, that the group momentarily
increased in number.
</p><p>The younger companion, in whom the reader has already recognised Dick
Shelton, sat from the first somewhat backward, and gradually drew
himself away. He listened, indeed, closely, but he opened not his mouth;
and by the grave expression of his countenance, he made but little
account of his companion's pleasantries.
</p><p>At last his eye, which travelled continually to and fro, and kept a
guard upon all the entrances of the house, lit upon a little procession
entering by the main gate and crossing the court in an oblique
direction. Two ladies, muffled in thick furs, led the way, and were
followed by a pair of waiting-women and four stout men-at-arms. The next
moment they had disappeared within the house; and Dick, slipping through
the crowd of loiterers in the shed, was already giving hot pursuit.
</p><p>"The taller of these twain was Lady Brackley," he thought; "and where
Lady Brackley is, Joan will not be far."
</p><p>At the door of the house the four men-at-arms had ceased to follow, and
the ladies were now mounting the stairway of polished oak, under no
better escort than that of the two waiting-women. Dick followed close
behind. It was already the dusk of the day; and in the house the
darkness of the night had almost come. On the stair-landings, torches
flared in iron holders; down the long, tapestried corridors, a lamp
burned by every door. And where the door stood open, Dick could look in
upon arras-covered walls and rush-bescattered floors, glowing in the
light of the wood fires.
</p><p>Two floors were passed, and at every landing the younger and shorter of
the two ladies had looked back keenly at the monk. He, keeping his eyes
lowered, and affecting the demure manners that suited his disguise, had
but seen her once, and was unaware that he had attracted her attention.
And now, on the third floor, the party separated, the younger lady
continuing to ascend alone, the other, followed by the Waiting-maids,
descending the corridor to the right.
</p><p>Dick mounted with a swift foot, and holding to the corner, thrust forth
his head and followed the three women with his eyes. Without turning or
looking behind them, they continued to descend the corridor.
</p><p>"It is right well," thought Dick. "Let me but know my Lady Brackley's
chamber, and it will go hard an I find not Dame Hatch upon an errand."
</p><p>And just then a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and, with a bound and a
choked cry, he turned to grapple his assailant.
</p><p>He was somewhat abashed to find, in the person whom he had so roughly
seized, the short young lady in the furs. She, on her part, was shocked
and terrified beyond expression, and hung trembling in his grasp.
</p><p>"Madam," said Dick, releasing her, "I cry you a thousand pardons; but I
have no eyes behind, and, by the mass, I could not tell ye were a maid."
</p><p>The girl continued to look at him, but, by this time, terror began to be
succeeded by surprise, and surprise by suspicion. Dick, who could read
these changes on her face, became alarmed for his own safety in that
hostile house.
</p><p>"Fair maid," he said, affecting easiness, "suffer me to kiss your hand,
in token ye forgive my roughness, and I will even go."
</p><p>"Y'are a strange monk, young sir," returned the young lady, looking him
both boldly and shrewdly in the face; "and now that my first
astonishment hath somewhat passed away, I can spy the layman in each
word you utter. What do ye here? Why are ye thus sacrilegiously tricked
out? Come ye in peace or war? And why spy ye after Lady Brackley like a
thief?"
</p><p>"Madam," quoth Dick, "of one thing I pray you to be very sure: I am no
thief. And even if I come here in war, as in some degree I do, I make no
war upon fair maids, and I hereby entreat them to copy me so far, and to
leave me be. For, indeed, fair mistress, cry out--if such be your
pleasure--cry but once, and say what ye have seen, and the poor
gentleman before you is merely a dead man. I cannot think ye would be
cruel," added Dick; and taking the girl's hand gently in both of his, he
looked at her with courteous admiration.
</p><p>"Are ye, then, a spy--a Yorkist?" asked the maid.
</p><p>"Madam," he replied, "I am indeed a Yorkist, and, in some sort, a spy.
But that which bringeth me into this house, the same which will win for
me the pity and interest of your kind heart, is neither of York nor
Lancaster. I will wholly put my life in your discretion. I am a lover,
and my name----"
</p><p>But here the young lady clapped her hand suddenly upon Dick's mouth,
looked hastily up and down and east and west, and, seeing the coast
clear, began to drag the young man, with great strength and vehemence,
up-stairs.
</p><p>"Hush!" she said, "and come! Shalt talk hereafter."
</p><p>Somewhat bewildered, Dick suffered himself to be pulled up-stairs,
bustled along a corridor, and thrust suddenly into a chamber, lit, like
so many of the others, by a blazing log upon the hearth.
</p><p>"Now," said the young lady, forcing him down upon a stool, "sit ye there
and attend my sovereign good pleasure. I have life and death over you,
and I will not scruple to abuse my power. Look to yourself; y' 'ave
cruelly mauled my arm. He knew not I was a maid, quoth he! Had he known
I was a maid, he had ta'en his belt to me, forsooth!"
</p><p>And with these words, she whipped out of the room and left Dick gaping
with wonder, and not very sure if he were dreaming or awake.
</p><p>"Ta'en my belt to her!" he repeated. "Ta'en my belt to her!" And the
recollection of that evening in the forest flowed back upon his mind,
and he once more saw Matcham's wincing body and beseeching eyes.
</p><p>And then he was recalled to the dangers of the present. In the next room
he heard a stir, as of a person moving; then followed a sigh, which
sounded strangely near; and then the rustle of skirts and tap of feet
once more began. As he stood hearkening, he saw the arras wave along the
wall; there was the sound of a door being opened, the hangings divided,
and, lamp in hand, Joanna Sedley entered the apartment.
</p><p>She was attired in costly stuffs of deep and warm colours, such as befit
the winter and the snow. Upon her head, her hair had been gathered
together and became her as a crown. And she, who had seemed so little
and so awkward in the attire of Matcham, was now tall like a young
willow, and swam across the floor as though she scorned the drudgery of
walking.
</p><p>Without a start, without a tremor, she raised her lamp and looked at the
young monk.
</p><p>"What make ye here, good brother?" she inquired. "Ye are doubtless
ill-directed. Whom do ye require?" And she set her lamp upon the
bracket.
</p><p>"Joanna," said Dick; and then his voice failed him. "Joanna," he began
again, "ye said ye loved me; and the more fool I, but I believed it!"
</p><p>"Dick!" she cried. "Dick!"
</p><p>And then, to the wonder of the lad, this beautiful and tall young lady
made but one step of it, and threw her arms about his neck and gave him
a hundred kisses all in one.
</p><p>"Oh, the fool fellow!" she cried. "Oh, dear Dick! Oh, if ye could see
yourself! Alack!" she added, pausing. "I have spoilt you, Dick! I have
knocked some of the paint off. But that can be mended. What cannot be
mended, Dick--or I much fear it cannot!--is my marriage with Lord
Shoreby."
</p><p>"Is it decided, then?" asked the lad.
</p><p>"To-morrow, before noon, Dick, in the abbey church," she answered, "John
Matcham and Joanna Sedley both shall come to a right miserable end.
There is no help in tears, or I could weep mine eyes out. I have not
spared myself to pray, but Heaven frowns on my petition. And, dear
Dick--good Dick--but that ye can get me forth of this house before the
morning, we must even kiss and say good-bye."
</p><p>"Nay," said Dick, "not I; I will never say that word. 'Tis like despair;
but while there's life, Joanna, there is hope. Yet will I hope. Ay, by
the mass, and triumph! Look ye, now, when ye were but a name to me, did
I not follow--did I not rouse good men--did I not stake my life upon the
quarrel? And now that I have seen you for what ye are--the fairest maid
and stateliest of England--think ye I would turn?--if the deep sea were
there, I would straight through it; if the way were full of lions, I
would scatter them like mice."
</p><p>"Ay," she said, drily, "ye make a great ado about a sky-blue robe!"
</p><p>"Nay, Joan," protested Dick, "'tis not alone the robe. But, lass, ye
were disguised. Here am I disguised; and, to the proof, do I not cut a
figure of fun--a right fool's figure?"
</p><p>"Ay, Dick, an' that ye do!" she answered, smiling.
</p><p>"Well, then!" he returned, triumphant. "So was it with you, poor
Matcham, in the forest. In sooth, ye were a wench to laugh at. But now!"
</p><p>So they ran on, holding each other by both hands, exchanging smiles and
lovely looks, and melting minutes into seconds; and so they might have
continued all night long. But presently there was a noise behind them;
and they were aware of the short young lady, with her finger on her
lips.
</p><p>"Saints!" she cried, "but what a noise ye keep! Can ye not speak in
compass? And now, Joanna, my fair maid of the woods, what will ye give
your gossip for bringing you your sweetheart?"
</p><p>Joanna ran to her, by way of answer, and embraced her fierily.
</p><p>"And you, sir," added the young lady, "what do ye give me?"
</p><p>"Madam," said Dick, "I would fain offer to pay you in the same money."
"Come, then," said the lady, "it is permitted you."
</p><p>But Dick, blushing like a peony, only kissed her hand.
</p><p>"What ails ye at my face, fair sir?" she inquired, curtseying to the
very ground; and then, when Dick had at length and most tepidly embraced
her, "Joanna," she added, "your sweetheart is very backwards under your
eyes; but I warrant you, when first we met, he was more ready. I am all
black and blue, wench; trust me never, if I be not black and blue! And
now," she continued, "have ye said your sayings? for I must speedily
dismiss the paladin."
</p><p>But at this they both cried out that they had said nothing, that the
night was still very young, and that they would not be separated so
early.
</p><p>"And supper?" asked the young lady. "Must we not go down to supper?"
</p><p>"Nay, to be sure!" cried Joan. "I had forgotten."
</p><p>"Hide me, then," said Dick, "put me behind the arras, shut me in a
chest, or what ye will, so that I may be here on your return. Indeed,
fair lady," he added, "bear this in mind, that we are sore bested, and
may never look upon each other's face from this night forward till we
die."
</p><p>At this the young lady melted; and when, a little after, the bell
summoned Sir Daniel's household to the board, Dick was planted very
stiffly against the wall, at a place where a division in the tapestry
permitted him to breathe the more freely, and even to see into the room.
</p><p>He had not been long in this position, when he was somewhat strangely
disturbed. The silence in that upper storey of the house, was only
broken by the flickering of the flames and the hissing of a green log
in the chimney; but presently, to Dick's strained hearing, there came
the sound of some one walking with extreme precaution; and soon after
the door opened, and a little black-faced, dwarfish fellow, in Lord
Shoreby's colours, pushed first his head, and then his crooked body,
into the chamber. His mouth was open, as though to hear the better; and
his eyes, which were very bright, flitted restlessly and swiftly to and
fro. He went round and round the room, striking here and there upon the
hangings; but Dick, by a miracle, escaped his notice. Then he looked
below the furniture, and examined the lamp; and, at last, with an air of
cruel disappointment, was preparing to go away as silently as he had
come, when down he dropped upon his knees, picked up something from
among the rushes on the floor, examined it, and, with every signal of
delight, concealed it in the wallet at his belt.
</p><p>Dick's heart sank, for the object in question was a tassel from his own
girdle; and it was plain to him that this dwarfish spy, who took a
malign delight in his employment, would lose no time in bearing it to
his master, the baron. He was half tempted to throw aside the arras,
fall upon the scoundrel, and, at the risk of his life, remove the
tell-tale token. And while he was still hesitating, a new cause of
concern was added. A voice, hoarse and broken by drink, began to be
audible from the stair; and presently after, uneven, wandering, and
heavy footsteps sounded without along the passage.
</p><p>"What make ye here, my merry men, among the greenwood shaws?" sang the
voice. "What make ye here? Hey! sots, what make ye here?" it added,
with a rattle of drunken laughter; and then, once more breaking into
song:
</p><p>    "If ye should drink the clary wine,
</p><pre>
     Fat Friar John, ye friend o' mine--
     If I should eat, and ye should drink,
     Who shall sing the mass, d'ye think?"</pre>
<p>Lawless, alas! rolling drunk, was wandering the house, seeking for a
corner wherein to slumber off the effect of his potations. Dick inwardly
raged. The spy, at first terrified, had grown reassured as he found he
had to deal with an intoxicated man, and now, with a movement of
cat-like rapidity, slipped from the chamber, and was gone from Richard's
eyes.
</p><p>What was to be done? If he lost touch of Lawless for the night, he was
left impotent, whether to plan or carry forth Joanna's rescue. If, on
the other hand, he dared to address the drunken outlaw, the spy might
still be lingering within sight, and the most fatal consequences ensue.
</p><p>It was, nevertheless, upon this last hazard that Dick decided. Slipping
from behind the tapestry, he stood ready in the doorway of the chamber,
with a warning hand upraised. Lawless, flushed crimson, with his eyes
injected, vacillating on his feet, drew still unsteadily nearer. At last
he hazily caught sight of his commander, and, in despite of Dick's
imperious signals, hailed him instantly and loudly by his name.
</p><p>Dick leaped upon and shook the drunkard furiously.
</p><p>"Beast!" he hissed--"beast and no man! It is worse than treachery to be
so witless. We may all be shent for thy sotting."
</p><p>But Lawless only laughed and staggered, and tried to clap young Shelton
on the back.
</p><p>And just then Dick's quick ear caught a rapid brushing in the arras. He
leaped towards the sound, and the next moment a piece of the
wall-hanging had been torn down, and Dick and the spy were sprawling
together in its folds. Over and over they rolled, grappling for each
other's throat, and still baffled by the arras, and still silent in
their deadly fury. But Dick was by much the stronger, and soon the spy
lay prostrate under his knee, and, with a single stroke of the long
poniard, ceased to breathe.
