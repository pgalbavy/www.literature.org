<p>The first person he encountered in the gun-room was Quarrier,
who favoured him with an expressionless stare, then with a bow,
quite perfunctory and non-committal. It was plain enough that
he had not expected to meet Siward at Shotover House.</p>

<p>Kemp Ferrall, a dark, stocky, active man of forty, was in the
act of draining a glass, when, though the bottom he caught sight
of Siward. He finished in a gulp, and advanced, one muscular hand
outstretched: "Hello, Stephen! Heard you'd arrived, tried the
Scotch, and bolted with Sylvia Landis! That's all right, too,
but you should have come for the opening day. Lots of native woodcock&mdash;eh,
Blinky?" turning to Lord Alderdene; and again to Siward: "You
know all these fellows &mdash;Mortimer yonder&mdash;" There was the
slightest ring in his voice; and Leroy Mortimer, red-necked, bulky,
and heavy eyed, emptied his glass and came over, followed by Lord
Alderdene blinking madly though his shooting-goggles and showing
all his teeth like a pointer with a "tic." Captain Voucher, a
gentleman with the vivid colouring of a healthy groom on a cold
day, came up, followed by the Page boys, Willis and Gordon, who
shook hands shyly, enchanted to be on easy terms with the notorious
Mr. Siward. And last of all Tom O'Hara arrived, reeking of the
saddle and clinking a pair of trooper's spurs over the floor&mdash;relics
of his bloodless Porto Rico campaign with Squadron A.</p>

<p>It was patent to every man present that the Kemp Ferralls had
determined to ignore Siward's recent foolishness, which indicated
that he might reasonably expect the continued good-will of several
sets, the orbits of which intersected in the social system of
his native city. Indeed, the few qualified to snub him cared nothing
about the matter, and it was not likely that anybody else would
take the initiative in being disagreeable to a young man, the
fortunes and misfortunes of whose race were part of the history
of Manhattan Island. Siwards, good or bad, were a matter of course
in New York.</p>

<p>So everybody in the gun-room was civil enough, and he chose Scotch
and found a seat beside Alderdene, who sat biting at a smoky pipe
and fingering a tumbler of smokier Scotch, blinking away like
mad through his shooting-goggles at everybody.</p>

<p>"These little brown snipe you call woodcock," he began; "we bagged
nine brace, d'you see? But of all the damnable bogs and covers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Mortimer thickly; "Ferrall, you're all calf and
biceps, and it's well enough for you to go floundering into bogs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where do you expect to find native woodcock?" demanded Ferrall,
laughing.</p>

<p>"On the table hereafter," growled Mortimer.</p>

<p>"Oh, go and pot Beverly Plank's tame pheasants," retorted Ferrall
amiably; "Captain Voucher had a blank day, but he isn't kicking."</p>

<p>"Not I," said Voucher; "the sport is capital&mdash;if one can manage
to hit the beggars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody misses in snap-shooting," observed Ferrall; "that
is, everybody except Stephen Siward with his unholy left barrel.
Crack! and," turning to Alderdene, "it's like taking money from
you, Blinky&mdash;which reminds me that we've time for a little Preference
before dressing."</p>

<p>His squinting lordship declined and took an easier position in
his chair, extending a pair of little bandy legs draped in baggy
tweed knickerbockers and heather-spats. Mortimer, industriously
distending his skin with whiskey, reached for the decanter. The
aromatic perfume of the spirits aroused Siward, and he instinctively
nodded his desire to a servant.</p>

<p>"This salt air keeps one thirsty," he observed to Ferrall; then
something in his host's expression arrested the glass at his lips.
He had already been using the decanter a good deal; except Mortimer,
nobody was doing that sort of thing as freely as he.</p>

<p>He set his glass on the table thoughtfully; a tinge of colour
had crept into his lean checks.</p>

<p>Ferrall, too, suddenly uncomfortable, stood up saying something
about dressing; several men arose a trifle stiffly, feeling in
every joint the result of the first day's shooting after all those
idle months. Mortimer got up with an unfeigned groan; Siward followed,
leaving his glass untouched.</p>

<p>One or two other men came in from the billiard-room. All greeted
Siward amiably&mdash;all excepting one who may not have seen him&mdash;an
elderly, pink, soft gentleman with white downy chop-whiskers and
the profile of a benevolent buck rabbit.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Major Belwether?" said Siward in a low voice
without offering his hand.</p>

<p>Then Major Belwether saw him, bless you! yes indeed! And though
Siward continued not to offer his hand, Major Belwether meant
to have it, bless your heart! And he fussed and fussed and beamed
cordiality until he secured it in his plump white fingers and
pressed it effusively.</p>

<p>There was something about his soft, warm hands which had always
reminded Siward of the temperature and texture of a newly hatched
bird. It had been some time since he had shaken hands with Major
Belwether; it was apparent that the bird had not aged any.</p>

<p>"And now for the shooting!" said the Major with an arch smile.
"Now for the stag at bay and the winding horn&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
'Where sleeps the moon On Mona's rill&mdash;'

</p>
</div>
<p>Eh, Siward?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'And here's to the hound With his nose upon the ground&mdash;'

</p>
</div>
<p>Eh, my boy? That reminds me of a story&mdash;" He chuckled and chuckled,
his lambent eyes suffused with mirth; and slipping his arm through
the pivot-sleeve of Lord Alderdene's shooting-jacket, hooking
the other in Siward's reluctant elbow, and driving Mortimer ahead
of him, he went garrulously away up the stairs, his lordship's
bandy little legs trotting beside him, the soaking gaiters and
shoes slopping at every step.</p>

<p>Mortimer, his mottled skin now sufficiently distended, greeted
the story with a yawn from ear to ear; his lordship, blinking
madly, burst into that remarkable laugh which seemed to reveal
the absence of certain vocal cords requisite to perfect harmony;
and Siward smiled in his listless, pleasant way, and turned off
down his corridor, unaware that the Sagamore pup was following
close at his heels until he heard Quarrier's even, colourless
voice: "Ferrall, would you be good enough to send Sagamore to
your kennels?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;he's your dog! I forgot," said Siward turning around.</p>

<p>Quarrier looked at him, pausing a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said coldly, "he's my dog."</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second the two men's eyes encountered; then
Siward glanced at the dog, and turned on his heel with the slightest
shrug. And that is all there was to the incident&mdash;an anxious,
perplexed puppy lugged off by a servant, turning, jerking, twisting,
resisting, looking piteously back as his unwilling feet slid over
the polished floor.</p>

<p>So Siward walked on alone through the long eastern wing to his
room overlooking the sea. He sat down on the edge of his bed,
glancing at the clothing laid out for him. He felt tired and disinclined
for the exertion of undressing. The shades were up; night quicksilvered
the window-panes so that they were like a dark mirror reflecting
his face. He inspected his darkened features curiously; the blurred
and sombre-tinted visage returned the stare.</p>

<p>"Not a man at all&mdash;the shadow of a man," he said aloud&mdash;"with
no will, no courage&mdash;always putting off the battle, always avoiding
conclusions, always skulking. What chance is there for a man like
that?"</p>

<p>As one who raises a glass to drink wine and unexpectedly finds
water, he shrugged his shoulders disgustedly and got up. A bath
followed; he dressed leisurely, and was pacing the room, fussing
with his collar, when Ferrall knocked and entered, finding a seat
on the bed.</p>

<p>"Stephen," he said bluntly, "I haven't seen you since that break
of yours at the club."</p>

<p>"Rotten, wasn't it?" commented Siward, tying his tie.</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Of course it doesn't make any difference to Grace
or to me, but I fancy you've already heard from it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. All I care about is how my mother took it."</p>

<p>"Of course; she was cut up I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you know how she would look at a thing of that sort; not
that any of the nine and seventy jarring sets would care, but
those few thousands invading the edges, butting in&mdash;half or three-quarters
inside&mdash;are the people who can't afford to overlook the victim
of a fashionable club's displeasure&mdash;those, and a woman like my
mother, and several other decent-minded people who happen to count
in town."</p>

<p>Ferrall, his legs swinging busily, thought again; then: "Who
was the girl, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"I don't think the papers mentioned her name," said Siward gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;I beg your pardon; I thought she was some notorious
actress&mdash;everybody said so. … Who were those callow fools who
put you up to it? … Never mind if you don't care to tell. But
it strikes me they are candidates for club discipline as well
as you. It was up to them to face the governors I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I think not."</p>

<p>Ferrall, legs swinging busily, considered him.</p>

<p>"Too bad," he mused; "they need not have dropped you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, they had to. But as long as the Lenox takes no action I
can live that down."</p>

<p>Ferrall nodded: "I came in to say something&mdash;a message from Grace&mdash;confound
it! what was it? Oh&mdash;could you&mdash;before dinner&mdash;now&mdash;just sit down
and with that infernal facility of yours make a sketch of a man
chasing a gun-shy dog?"</p>

<p>"Why yes&mdash;if Mrs. Ferrall wishes&mdash;"</p>

<p>He walked over to the desk in his shirt-sleeves, sat down, drew
a blank sheet of paper toward him, and, dipping his pen, drew
carelessly a gun-shy setter dog rushing frantically across the
stubble, and after him, bare-headed, gun in hand, the maddest
of men.</p>

<p>"Put a Vandyke beard on him," grinned Ferrall over his shoulder.
"There! O Lord! but you have hit it! Put a ticked saddle on the
cur&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"Who is this supposed to be?" began Siward, looking up. But "Wait!" 
chuckled his host, seizing the still wet sketch, and made for
the door.</p>

<p>Siward strolled into the bath-room, washed a spot or two of ink
from his fingers, returned and buttoned his waistcoat, then, completing
an unhurried toilet, went out and down the stairway to the big
living-room. There were two or three people there &mdash;Mrs.
Leroy Mortimer, very fetching with her Japanese-like colouring,
black hair and eyes that slanted just enough; Rena Bonnesdel,
smooth, violet-eyed, blonde, and rather stunning in a peculiarly
innocent way; Miss Caithness, very pale and slimly attractive;
and the Page boys, Willis and Gordon, delightfully shy and interested,
and having a splendid time with any woman who could afford the
intellectual leisure.</p>

<p>Siward spoke pleasantly to them all. Other people drifted down
&mdash;Marion Page who looked like a school-marm and rode like
a demon; Eileen Shannon, pink and white as a thorn blossom, with
the deuce to pay lurking in her grey eyes; Kathryn Tassel and
Mrs. Vendenning whom he did not know, and finally his hostess
Grace Ferrall with her piquant, almost boyish, freckled face and
sweet frank eyes and the figure of an adolescent.</p>

<p>She gave Siward one pretty sun-browned hand and laid the other
above his, holding it a moment in her light clasp.</p>

<p>"Stephen! Stephen!" she said under her breath, "it's because
I've a few things to scold you about that I've asked you to Shotover."</p>

<p>"I suppose I know," he said.</p>

<p>"I should hope you do. I've a letter to-night from your mother."</p>

<p>"From my mother?"</p>

<p>"I want you to go over it&mdash;with me&mdash;if we can find a minute after
dinner." She released his hand, turning partly around: "Kemp,
dinner's been announced, so cut that dog story in two! Will you
give me your arm Major Belwether? Howard!"&mdash;to her cousin, Mr.
Quarrier, who turned from Miss Landis to listen&mdash;"will you please
try to recollect whom you are to take in&mdash;and do it?" And, as
she passed Siward, in a low voice, mischievous and slangy: "Sylvia
Landis for yours&mdash;as she says she didn't have enough of you on
the cliffs."</p>

<p>The others appeared to know how to pair according to some previous
notice. Siward turned to Sylvia Landis with the pleasure of his
good fortune so plainly visible in his face, that her own brightened
in response.</p>

<p>"You see," she said gaily, "you cannot escape me. There is no
use in looking wildly at Agatha Caithness"&mdash;he wasn't&mdash;"or pretending
you're pleased," slipping her rounded, bare arm through the arm
he offered. "You can't guess what I've done to-night&mdash;nobody can
guess except Grace Ferrall and one other person. And if you try
to look happy beside me, I may tell you&mdash;somewhere between sherry
and cognac &mdash;Oh, yes; I've done two things: I have your dog
for you!"</p>

<p>"Not Sagamore?" he said incredulously as he was seating her.</p>

<p>"Certainly Sagamore. I said to Mr. Quarrier, 'I want Sagamore,'
and when he tried to give him to me, I made him take my cheque.
Now you may draw another for me at your leisure, Mr. Siward. Tell
me, are you pleased?"&mdash;for she was looking for the troubled hesitation
in his face and she saw it dawning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quarrier doesn't like me, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do," she said coolly. "I told him how much pleasure it
would give me. That is sufficient&mdash;is it not?&mdash;for everybody concerned."</p>

<p>"He knew that you meant to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, that concerns only you and me. Are you trying to spoil my
pleasure in what I have done?"</p>

<p>"I can't take the dog, Miss Landis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, vexed; "I had no idea you were vindictive&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a silence; he bent forward a trifle, gravely scrutinising
a "hand-painted" name card, though it might not have astonished
him to learn that somebody's foot had held the brush. Somewhere
in the vicinity Grace Ferrall had discovered a woman who supported
dozens of relatives by painting that sort of thing for the summer
residents at Vermillion Point down the coast. So being charitable
she left an order, and being thrifty, insisted on using the cards,
spite of her husband's gibes.</p>

<p>People were now inspecting them with more or less curiosity;
Siward found his "hand-painting" so unattractive that he had just
tipped it over to avoid seeing it, when a burst of laughter from
Lord Alderdene made everybody turn. Mrs. Vendenning was laughing;
so was Rena Bonnesdel looking over Quarrier's shoulder at a card
he was holding&mdash;not one of the "hand-decorated," but a sheet of
note-paper containing a drawing of a man rushing after a gun-shy
dog.</p>

<p>The extraordinary cackling laughter of his lordship obliterated
other sounds for a while; Rena Bonnesdel possessed herself of
the drawing and held it up amid a shout of laughter. And, to his
excessive annoyance, Siward saw that, unconsciously, he had caricatured
Quarrier &mdash;Ferrall's malicious request for a Vandyke beard
making the caricature dreadfully apparent.</p>

<p>Quarrier had at first flushed up; then he forced a smile; but
his symmetrical features were never cordial when he smiled.</p>

<p>"Who on earth did that?" whispered Sylvia Landis apprehensively.
"Mr. Quarrier dislikes that sort of thing&mdash;but of course he'll
take it well."</p>

<p>"Did he ever chase his own dog?" asked Siward, biting his lip.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;so Blinky says&mdash;in the Carolinas last season. It's Blinky!&mdash;that's
his notion of humour. Did you ever hear such a laugh? No wonder
Mr. Quarrier is annoyed."</p>

<p>The gay uproar had partly subsided, renewed here and there as
the sketch was passed along, and finally, making the circle, returned
like a bad penny to Quarrier. He smiled again, symmetrically,
as he received it, nodding his compliments to Alderdene.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," cackled his lordship; "I didn't draw it, old chap!"</p>

<p>"Nor I! I only wish I could," added Captain Voucher.</p>

<p>"Nor <em>I&mdash;</em>nor <em>I&mdash;</em>who did it?" ran the chorus
along the table.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it!" said Sylvia gravely, looking across at Quarrier.
And suddenly Quarrier's large, handsome eyes met Siward's for
the briefest fraction of a second, then were averted. But into
his face there crept an expressionless pallor that did not escape
Siward&mdash;no, nor Sylvia Landis.</p>

<p>Presently under cover of a rapid fire of chatter she said: "Did
you draw that?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had no idea it was meant for him. You may imagine how
likely I'd be to take any liberty with a man who already dislikes
me."</p>

<p>"But it resembles him&mdash;in a very dreadful way."</p>

<p>"I know it. You must take my word for what I have told you."</p>

<p>She looked up at him: "I do." Then: "It's a pity; Mr. Quarrier
does not consider such things humourous. He&mdash;he is very sensitive.
… Oh, I wish that fool Englishman had been in Ballyhoo!"</p>

<p>"But he didn't do it!"</p>

<p>"No, but he put you up to it&mdash;or Grace Ferrall did. I wish Grace
would let Mr. Quarrier alone; she has always been perfectly possessed
to plague him; she seems unable to take him seriously and he simply
hates it. I don't think he'd tolerate her if she were not his
cousin.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," was all Siward said; and for a while he
gloomily busied himself with whatever was brought to him.</p>

<p>"Don't look that way," came a low voice beside him.</p>

<p>"Do I show everything as plainly as that?" he asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"I seem to read you&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"It's very nice of you," he said.</p>

<p>"Nice?"</p>

<p>"To look at me&mdash;now and then."</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried resentfully, "don't be grateful."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>really am not you know," he said laughing.</p>

<p>"That," she rejoined slowly, "is the truth. You say conventional
things in a manner&mdash;in an agreeably personal manner that interests
women. But you are not grateful to anybody for anything; you are
indifferent, and you can't help being nice to people, so&mdash;some
day&mdash;some girl will think you are grateful, and will have a miserable
time of it."</p>

<p>"Miserable time?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for you to say what never will enter your head to say."</p>

<p>"You mean I &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Flirt? No, I mean that you don't flirt; that you are always
dreamily occupied with your own affairs, from which listlessly
congenial occupation, when drawn, you are so unexpectedly nice
that a girl immediately desires to see how nice you can be."</p>

<p>"What a charming indictment you draw!" he said, amused.</p>

<p>"It's a grave one I assure you. I've been talking about you to
Grace Ferrall; I asked to be placed beside you at dinner; I told
her I hadn't had half enough of you on the cliff. Now what do
you think of yourself for being too nice to a susceptible girl?
I think it's immoral."</p>

<p>They both were laughing now; several people glanced at them,
smiling in sympathy. Alderdene took that opportunity to revert
to the sketch, furnishing a specimen of his own inimitable laughter
as a running accompaniment to the story of Quarrier and his dog
in North Carolina, until he had everybody, as usual, laughing,
not at the story but at him. All of which demonstration was bitterly
offensive to Quarrier. He turned his eyes once on Miss Landis
and on Siward, then dropped them.</p>

<p>The hostess arose; a rustle and flurry of silk and lace and the
scraping of chairs, a lingering word or laugh, and the colour
vanished from the room leaving a circle of men in black standing
around the table.</p>

<p>Here and there a man, lighting a cigarette, bolted his coffee
and cognac and strolled out to the gun-room. Ferrall, gesticulating
vigorously, resumed his preprandial dog story to Captain Voucher;
Belwether buttonholed Alderdene and bored him with an interminably
facetious tale until that nobleman, threatened with maxillary
dislocation, fairly wrenched himself loose and came over to Siward,
squinting furiously.</p>

<p>"Old ass!" he muttered; "his chop whiskers look like the chops
of a Southdown ram&mdash;and he's got the wits of one. Look here, Stephen,
I hear you fell into no end of a scrape in town&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tu quoque, Blinky? Oh, read the newspapers and let it go at
that!"</p>

<p>"Just as you like old chap!" returned his lordship unabashed.
"All I meant was&mdash;anything Voucher and I can do&mdash;of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're very good. I'm not dead you know."</p>

<p>"'Not dead, you know'," repeated Major Belwether coming up behind
them with his sprightly step; "that reminds me of a good one&mdash;"
He sat down and lighted a cigar, then, vainly attempting to control
his countenance as though roguishly anticipating the treat awaiting
them, he began another endless story.</p>

<p>Tradition had hallowed the popular notion that Major Belwether
was a wit. The sycophant of the outer world seldom even awaited
his first word before bursting into premature mirth. Besides he
was very wealthy.</p>

<p>Siward watched him with mixed emotions; the lambent-eyed, sheepy
expression had given place to the buck rabbit; his smooth baby-pink
skin and downy white side whiskers quivered in premature sympathy
with his listener's overwhelming hilarity.</p>

<p>The Page boys, very callow, very much delighted, and a little
in awe of such a celebrated personage, laughed heartily. And altogether
there was sufficient attention and sufficient laughter to make
a very respectable noise. This, being the major's cue for an exit,
he rose, one sleek hand raised in sprightly protest as though
to shield the invisible ladies, to whose bournes he was bound,
from an uproar too masculine and mighty for the ears of such a
sex.</p>

<p>"Ass!" muttered Alderdene, getting up and pattering about the
room in his big, shiny pumps. "Give me a peg&mdash;somebody!"</p>

<p>Mortimer swallowed his brandy, lingered, lifted the decanter,
mechanically considering its remaining contents and his own capacity;
then:</p>

<p>"Bridge, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Captain Voucher briskly.</p>

<p>"I'll go and shoo the major into the gun-room," observed Ferrall&mdash;"unless&mdash;"
looking questioningly at Siward.</p>

<p>"I've a date with your wife," observed that young man, strolling
toward the hall.</p>

<p>The Page boys, Rena Bonnesdel, and Eileen Shannon were seated
at a card table together, very much engaged with one another,
the sealed pack lying neglected on the green cloth, a vast pink
box of bon-bons beside it, not neglected.</p>

<p>O'Hara and Quarrier with Marion Page and Mrs. Mortimer were immersed
in the game, already stony faced and oblivious to outer sounds.</p>

<p>About the rooms were distributed girls en tête-à-tête, girls
eating bon-bons and watching the cards&mdash;among them Sylvia Landis,
hands loosely clasped behind her, standing at Quarrier's elbow
to observe and profit by an expert performance.</p>

<p>As Siward strolled in she raised her dainty head for an instant,
smiled in silence, and resumed a study of her fiancé's game.</p>

<p>A moment later, when Quarrier had emerged brilliantly from the
mêlée, she looked up again, triumphantly, supposing Siward was
lingering somewhere waiting to join her. And she was just a trifle
surprised and disappointed to find him nowhere in sight. She had
wished him to observe the brilliancy of Mr. Quarrier's game.</p>

<p>But Siward, outside on the veranda, was saying at that moment
to his hostess: "I shall be very glad to read my mother's letter
at any time you choose."</p>

<p>"It must be later, Stephen. I'm to cut in when Kemp sends for
me. He has a lot of letters to attend to. … Tell me, what do you
think of Sylvia Landis?"</p>

<p>"I like her, of course," he replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>Grace Ferrall stood thinking a moment: "That sketch you made
proved a great success, didn't it?" And she laughed under her
breath.</p>

<p>"Did it? I thought Mr. Quarrier seemed annoyed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really? What a muff that cousin of mine is. He's such a muff,
you know, that the very sight of his pointed beard and pompadour
hair and his complacency sets me in fidgets to stir him up."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'd best use me for the stick next time," said
Siward. "He's not my cousin you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall shrugged her boyish shoulders: "By the way"&mdash;she
said curiously&mdash;"who was that girl?"</p>

<p>"What girl," he asked coolly, looking at his hostess, now the
very incarnation of delicate mockery with her pretty laughing
mouth, her boyish sunburn and freckles.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was she pretty, Stephen?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said sulkily; "I wish you wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Do you think I'm going to let you off without some
sort of confession? If I had time now&mdash;but I haven't. Kemp has
business letters: he'll be furious; so I've got to take his cards
or we won't have any pennies to buy gasoline for our adored and
shrieking Mercedes."</p>

<p>She retreated backward with a gay nod of malice, turned to enter
the house, and met Sylvia Landis face to face in the hallway.</p>

<p>"You minx!" she whispered; "aren't you ashamed?"</p>

<p>"Very much, dear. What for?" And catching sight of Siward outside
in the starlight, divined perhaps something of her hostess' meaning,
for she laughed uneasily, like a child who winces under a stern
eye.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose for a moment," she began, "that I have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I do. You always do."</p>

<p>"Not with that sort of man," she returned naïvely; "he won't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall regarded her suspiciously: "You always pick out
exactly the wrong man to play with&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had moved back side by side into the hall, the hostess'
arm linked in the arm of the younger girl.</p>

<p>"The wrong man?" repeated Sylvia, instinctively freeing her arm,
her straight brows beginning to bend inward.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that&mdash;exactly. You know how much I care for his
mother&mdash;and for him." The obstinate downward trend of the brows,
the narrowing blue gaze signalled mutiny to the woman who knew
her so well.</p>

<p>"What is so wrong with Mr. Siward?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. There was an affair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This spring in town. I know it. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;for the present," replied Grace Ferrall uncomfortably;
then: "For goodness' sake, Sylvia, don't cross examine me that
way! I care a great deal for that boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So do I. I've made him take my dog."</p>

<p>There was an abrupt pause, and presently Mrs. Ferrall began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"I mean it&mdash;really," said Sylvia quietly; "I like him immensely."</p>

<p>"Dearest, you mean it generously&mdash;with your usual exaggeration.
You have heard that he has been foolish, and because he's so young,
so likable, every instinct, every impulse in you is aroused to&mdash;to
be nice to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if that were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no harm, dear&mdash;" Mrs. Ferrall hesitated, her grey eyes
softening to a graver revery. Then looking up: "It's rather pathetic," 
she said in a low voice. "Kemp thinks he's foredoomed&mdash;like all
the Siwards. It's an hereditary failing with him,&mdash;no, it's hereditary
damnation. Siward after Siward, generation after generation you
know&mdash;"  She bit her lip, thinking a moment. "His grandfather
was a friend of my grand-parents, brilliant, handsome, generous,
and&mdash;doomed! His own father was found dying in a dreadful resort
in London where he had wandered when stupefied&mdash;a Siward! Think
of it! So you see what that outbreak of Stephen's means to those
whose families have been New Yorkers since New York was. It is
ominous, it is more than ominous&mdash;it means that the master-vice
has seized on one more Siward. But I shall never, never admit
it to his mother."</p>

<p>The younger girl sat wide-eyed, silent; the elder's gaze was
upon her, but her thoughts, remote, centred on the hapless mother
of such a son.</p>

<p>"Such indulgence was once fashionable; moderation is the present
fashion. Perhaps he will fall into line," said Mrs. Ferrall thoughtfully.
"The main thing is to keep him among people, not to drop him.
The gregarious may be shamed, but if anything, any incident, happens
to drive him outside by himself, if he should become solitary,
there's not a chance in the world for him. … It's a pity. I know
he meant to make himself the exception to the rule&mdash;and look!
Already one carouse of his has landed him in the daily papers!"</p>

<p>Sylvia flushed and looked up: "Grace, may I ask you a plain question?"</p>

<p>"Yes, child," she answered absently.</p>

<p>"Has it occurred to you that what you have said about this boy
touches me very closely?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall's wits returned nimbly from woolgathering, and she
shot a startled, inquiring glance at the girl beside her.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mean the matter of heredity, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think my uncle Major Belwether chose you as his august
mouthpiece for that little sermon on the dangers of heredity&mdash;the
danger of being ignorant concerning what women of my race had
done&mdash;before I came into the world they found so amusing."</p>

<p>"I told you several things," returned Mrs. Ferrall composedly.
"Your uncle thought it best for you to know."</p>

<p>"Yes. The marriage vows sat lightly upon some of my ancestors,
I gather. In fact," she added coolly, "where the women of my race
loved they usually found the way&mdash;rather unconventionally. There
was, if I understood you, enough of divorce, of general indiscretion
and irregularity to seriously complicate any family tree and coat
of arms I might care to claim&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sylvia!"</p>

<p>The girl lifted her pretty bare shoulders. "I'm sorry, but could
I help it? Very well; all I can do is to prove a decent exception.
Very well; I'm doing it, am I not?&mdash;practically scared into the
first solidly suitable marriage offered&mdash;seizing the unfortunate
Howard with both hands for fear he'd get away and leave me alone
with only a queer family record for company! Very well! Now then,
I want to ask you why everybody, in my case, didn't go about with
sanctimonious faces and dolorous mien repeating: 'Her grand-mother
eloped! Her mother ran away. Poor child, she's doomed! doomed!'"</p>

<p>"Sylvia, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;why didn't they? That's the way they talk about that boy
out there!" She swept a rounded arm toward the veranda.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he has already broken loose, while you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So did <em>I&mdash;</em>nearly! Had it not been for you, you know
well enough I might have run away with that dreadful Englishman
at Newport! For I adored him &mdash;I did! I did! and you know
it. And look at my endless escapes from compromising myself! Can
you count them?&mdash;all those indiscretions when mere living seemed
to intoxicate me that first winter&mdash;and only my uncle and you
to break me in!"</p>

<p>"In other words," said Mrs. Ferrall slowly, "you don't think
Mr. Siward is getting what is known as a square deal?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Major Belwether has already hinted&mdash;no, not even
that&mdash;but has somehow managed to dampen my pleasure in Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall considered the girl beside her&mdash;now very lovely
and flushed in her suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "you are going to marry somebody else.
So why become quite so animated about a man you may never again
see?"</p>

<p>"I shall see him if I desire to!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I am not taking the black veil, am I?" asked the girl hotly.</p>

<p>"Only the wedding veil, dear. But after all your husband ought
to have something to suggest concerning a common visiting list&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He may suggest&mdash;certainly. In the meantime I shall be loyal
to my own friends&mdash;and afterward, too," she murmured to herself,
as her hostess rose, calmly dropping care like a mantle from her
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Go and be good to this poor young man then; I adore rows&mdash;and
you'll have a few on your hands I'll warrant. Let me remind you
that your uncle can make it unpleasant for you yet, and that your
amiable fiancé has a will of his own under his pompadour and silky
beard."</p>

<p>"What a pity to have it clash with mine," said the girl serenely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall looked at her: "Mercy on us! Howard's pompadour
would stick up straight with horror if he could hear you! Don't
be silly; don't for an impulse, for a caprice, break off anything
desirable on account of a man for whom you really care nothing&mdash;whose
amiable exterior and prospective misfortune merely enlist a very
natural and generous sympathy in you."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that I shall endure interference from anybody?&mdash;from
my uncle, from Howard?"</p>

<p>"Dear, you are making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Don't be
emotional; don't let loose impulses that you and I know about,
knew about in our school years, know all about now, and which
you and I have decided must be eliminated&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean subdued; they'll always be there."</p>

<p>"Very well; who cares, as long as you have them in leash?"</p>

<p>Looking at one another, the excited colour cooling in the younger
girl's cheeks, they laughed, one with relief, the other a little
ashamed.</p>

<p>"Kemp will be furious; I simply must cut in!" said Mrs. Ferrall,
hastily turning toward the gun-room. Miss Landis looked after
her, subdued, vaguely repentant, the consciousness dawning upon
her that she had probably made considerable conversation about
nothing.</p>

<p>"It's been so all day," she thought impatiently; "I've exaggerated;
I've worked up a scene about a man whose habits are not the slightest
concern of mine. Besides that I've neglected Howard shamefully!"
She was walking slowly, her thoughts outstripping her errant feet,
but it seemed that neither her thoughts nor her steps were leading
her toward the neglected gentleman within; for presently she found
herself at the breezy veranda door, looking rather fixedly at
the stars.</p>

<p>The stars, shining impartially upon the just and the unjust,
illuminated the person of Siward, who sat alone, rather limply,
one knee crossed above the other. He looked up by chance, and,
seeing her star-gazing in the doorway, straightened out and rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>Aware of him apparently for the first time, she stepped across
the threshold meeting his advance half-way.</p>

<p>"Would you care to go down to the rocks?" he asked. "The surf
is terrific."</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I don't think I care&mdash;"</p>

<p>They stood listening a moment to the stupendous roar.</p>

<p>"A storm somewhere at sea," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Is it very fine&mdash;the surf?"</p>

<p>"Very fine&mdash;and very relentless&mdash;" he laughed; "it is an unfriendly
creature, the sea, you know."</p>

<p>She had begun to move toward the cliffs, he fell into step beside
her; they spoke little, a word now and then.</p>

<p>The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild
fragrance; dew lay heavy on the lawns; she lifted her skirts enough
to clear the grass, heedless that her silk-shod feet were now
soaking. Then at the cliffs' edge, as she looked down into the
white fury of the surf, the stunning crash of the ocean saluted
her.</p>

<p>For a long while they watched in silence; once she leaned a trifle
too far over the star-lit gulf and, recoiling, involuntarily steadied
herself on his arm.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "no swimmer could endure that battering."</p>

<p>"Not long."</p>

<p>"Would there be no chance?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>She bent farther outward, fascinated, stirred, by the splendid
frenzy of the breakers.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think&mdash;," he began quietly; then a firm hand fell
over her left hand; and, half encircled by his arm she found herself
drawn back. Neither spoke; two things she was coolly aware of,
that, urged, drawn by something subtly irresistible she had leaned
too far out from the cliff, and would have leaned farther had
he not taken matters into his own keeping without apology. Another
thing; the pressure of his hand over hers remained a sensation
still&mdash;a strong, steady, masterful imprint lacking hesitation
or vacillation. She was as conscious of it as though her hand
still tightened under his&mdash;and she was conscious, too, that nothing
of his touch had offended; that there had arisen in her no tremor
of instinctive recoil. For never before had she touched or suffered
a touch from a man, even a gloved greeting, that had not in some
measure subtly repelled her, nor, for that matter, a caress from
a woman without a reaction of faint discomfort.</p>

<p>"Was I in any actual danger?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I think not. But it was too much responsibility for me."</p>

<p>"I see. Any time I wish to break my neck I am to please do it
alone in future."</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;if you don't mind," he said smiling.</p>

<p>They turned, shoulder to shoulder, walking back through the drenched
herbage.</p>

<p>"That," she said impulsively, "is not what I said a few moments
ago to a woman."</p>

<p>"What did you say a few moments ago to a woman?"</p>

<p>"I said, Mr. Siward, that I would not leave a&mdash;a certain man
to go to the devil alone!"</p>

<p>"Do you know any man who is going to the devil?"</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked, letting herself go swinging out upon a tide
of intimacy she had never dreamed of risking&mdash;nor had she the
slightest idea whither the current would carry her.</p>

<p>They had stopped on the lawn, ankle deep in wet grass, the stars
overhead sparkling magnificently, and in their ears the outcrash
of the sea.</p>

<p>"You mean me," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Do I?"</p>

<p>He looked up into the lovely face; her eyes were very sweet,
very clear&mdash;clear with excitement&mdash;but very friendly.</p>

<p>"Let us sit here on the steps a little while, will you?" she
asked.</p>

<p>So he found a place beside her, one step lower, and she leaned
forward, elbows on knees, rounded white chin in her palms, the
starlight giving her bare arms and shoulders a marble lustre and
tinting her eyes a deeper amethyst.</p>

<p>And now, innocently untethered, mission and all, she laid her
heart quite bare&mdash;one chapter of it. And, like other women-errant
who believe in the influence of their sex individually and collectively,
she began wrong by telling him of her engagement&mdash;perhaps to emphasise
her pure disinterestedness in a crusade for principle only. Which
naturally dampened in him any nascent enthusiasm for being ministered
to, and so preoccupied him that he turned deaf ears to some very
sweet platitudes which might otherwise have impressed him as discoveries
in philosophy.</p>

<p>Officially her creed was the fashionable one in town; privately
she had her own religion, lacking some details truly enough, but
shaped upon youthful notions of right and wrong. As she had not
read very widely, she supposed that she had discovered this religion
for herself; she was not aware that everybody else had passed
that way&mdash;it being the first immature moult in young people after
rejecting dogma.</p>

<p>And the ripened fruit of all this philosophy she helpfully dispensed
for Siward's benefit as bearing directly on his case.</p>

<p>Had he not been immersed in the unexpected proposition of her
impending matrimony, he might have been impressed, for the spell
of her beauty counted something, and besides, he had recently
formulated for himself a code of ethics, tinctured with Omar,
and slightly resembling her own discoveries in that dog-eared
science.</p>

<p>So it was, when she was most eloquent, most earnestly inspired&mdash;nay
in the very middle of a plea for sweetness and light and simple
living, that his reasonings found voice in the material comment:</p>

<p>"I never imagined you were engaged!"</p>

<p>"Is that what you have been thinking about?" she asked, innocently
astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not? I never for one instant supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Siward, why should you have concerned yourself with
supposing anything? Why indulge in any speculation of that sort
about me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I didn't," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't; you'd known me for about three hours&mdash;there
on the cliff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But &mdash;Quarrier&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Over his youthful face a sullen shadow had fallen&mdash;flickering,
not yet settled. He would not for anything on earth have talked
freely to the woman destined to be Quarrier's wife. He had talked
too much anyway. Something in her, something about her had loosened
his tongue. He had made a plain ass of himself&mdash;that was all,&mdash;a
garrulous ass. And truly it seemed that the girl beside him, even
in the starlight, could follow and divine what he had scarcely
expressed to himself; or her instincts had taken a shorter cut
to forestall his own conclusion.</p>

<p>"Don't think the things you are thinking!" she said in a fierce
little voice, leaning toward him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, taken aback.</p>

<p>"You know! Don't! It is unfair&mdash;it is&mdash;is faithless&mdash;to me. I
am your friend; why not? Does it make any difference to you whom
I marry? Cannot two people remain in accord anyway? Their friendship
concerns each other and&mdash;nobody else!" She was letting herself
go now; she was conscious of it, conscious that impulse and emotion
were the currents unloosed and hurrying her onward. And with it
all came exhilaration, a faint intoxication, a delicate delight
in daring to let go all and trust to impulse and emotions.</p>

<p>"Why should you feel hurt because for a moment you let me see&mdash;gave
me a glimpse of yourself&mdash;of life's battle as you foresee it?
What if there is always a reaction from all confidences exchanged?
What if that miserable French cynic did say that never was he
more alone than after confessing to a friend? He died crazy anyhow.
Is not a rare moment of confidence worth the reaction&mdash;the subsidence
into the armored shell of self? Tell me truly, Mr. Siward, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Breathless, confused, exhilarated by her own rapid voice she
bent her face, brilliant with colour, and very sweet; and he looked
up into it, expectant, uncertain.</p>

<p>"If such a friendship as ours is to become worth anything to
you&mdash;to me, why should it trouble you that I know&mdash;and am thinking
of things that concern you? Is it because the confidence is one-sided?
Is it because you have given and I have listened and given nothing
in return to balance the account? I do give&mdash;interest, deep interest,
sympathy if you ask it; I give confidence in return&mdash;if you desire
it!"</p>

<p>"What can a girl like you need of sympathy?" he said smiling.</p>

<p>"You don't know! you don't know! If heredity is a dark vista,
and if you must stare through it all your life, sword in hand,
always on your guard, do you think you are the only one?"</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;one?" he said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;with an involuntary shudder&mdash;"not that way. It is easier
for me; I think it is &mdash;I know it is. But there are things
to combat&mdash;impulses, a recklessness, perhaps something almost
ruthless. What else I do not know, for I have never experienced
violent emotions of any sort&mdash;never even deep emotion."</p>

<p>"You are in love!"</p>

<p>"Yes, thoroughly," she added with conviction, "but not violently.
<em>I&mdash;"  </em>she hesitated, stopped short, leaning forward,
peering at him through the dusk; and: "Mr. Siward! are you laughing?"
She rose and he stood up instantly.</p>

<p>There was lightning in her darkening eyes now; in his something
that glimmered and danced. She watched it, fascinated, then of
a sudden the storm broke and they were both laughing convulsively,
face to face there under the stars.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward," she breathed, "I don't know what I am laughing
at; do you? Is it at you? At myself? At my poor philosophy in
shreds and tatters? Is it some infernal mirth that you seem to
be able to kindle in me&mdash;for I never knew a man like you before?"</p>

<p>"You don't know what you were laughing at?" he repeated. "It
was something about love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No I don't know why I laughed! I &mdash;I don't wish to, Mr.
Siward. I do not desire to laugh at anything you have made me
say&mdash;anything you may infer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't infer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do! You made me say something&mdash;about my being ignorant of
deep, of violent emotion, when I had just informed you that I
am thoroughly, thoroughly in love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I make you say all that, Miss Landis?"</p>

<p>"You did. Then you laughed and made me laugh too. Then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did I do then?" he asked, far too humbly.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you infer that I am either not in love or incapable of
it, or too ignorant of it to know what I'm talking about. That,
Mr. Siward, is what you have done to me to-night."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be anyway," he said.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate; an utterly inexcusable laughter seemed to
bewitch them, hovering always close to his lips and hers.</p>

<p>"How can you laugh!" she said. "How dare you! I don't care for
you nearly as violently as I did, Mr. Siward. A friendship between
us would not be at all good for me. Things pass too swiftly&mdash;too
intimately. There is too much mockery in you&mdash;" She ceased suddenly,
watching the sombre alteration of his face; and, "Have I hurt
you?" she asked penitently.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have I, Mr. Siward? I did not mean it." The attitude, the words,
slackening to a trailing sweetness, and then the moment's silence,
stirred him.</p>

<p>"I'm rather ignorant myself of violent emotion," he said. "I
suspect normal people are. You know better than I do whether love
is usually a sedative."</p>

<p>"Am I normal&mdash;after what I have confessed?" she asked. "Can't
love be well-bred?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly I should say&mdash;only perhaps you are not an expert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>"In self-analysis, for example."</p>

<p>There was a vague meaning in the gaze they exchanged.</p>

<p>"As for our friendship, we'll do the best we can for it, no matter
what occurs," he added, thinking of Quarrier. And, thinking of
him, glanced up to see him within ear-shot and moving straight
toward them from the veranda above.</p>

<p>There was a short silence; a tentative civil word from Siward;
then Miss Landis took command of something that had a grotesque
resemblance to a situation. A few minutes later they returned
slowly to the house, the girl walking serenely between Siward
and her preoccupied affianced.</p>

<p>"If your shoes are as wet as my skirts and slippers you had better
change, Mr. Siward," she said, pausing at the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>So he took his congé, leaving her standing there with Quarrier,
and mounted to his room.</p>

<p>In the corridor he passed Ferrall, who had finished his business
correspondence and was returning to the card-room.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter that Grace wants you to see," he said. "Read
it before you turn in, Stephen."</p>

<p>"All right; but I'll be down later," replied Siward passing on,
the letter in his hand. Entering his room he kicked off his wet
pumps and found dry ones. Then moved about, whistling a gay air
from some recent vaudeville, busy with rough towels and silken
foot-gear, until, reshod and dry, he was ready to descend once
more.</p>

<p>The encounter, the suddenly informal acquaintance with this young
girl had stirred him agreeably, leaving a slight exhilaration.
Even her engagement to Quarrier added a tinge of malice to his
interest. Besides he was young enough to feel the flattery of
her concern for him&mdash;of her rebuke, of her imprudence, her generous
emotional and childish philosophy.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as like recognises like, he recognised in her the instincts
of the born drifter, momentarily at anchor&mdash;the temporary inertia
of the opportunist, the latent capacity of an unformed character
for all things and anything. Add to these her few years, her beauty,
and the wholesome ignorance so confidently acknowledged, what
man could remain unconcerned, uninterested in the development
of such possibilities? Not Siward, amused by her sagacious and
impulsive prudence, worldliness, and innocence in accepting Quarrier;
and touched by her profitless, frank, and unworldly friendliness
for himself.</p>

<p>Not that he objected to her marrying Quarrier; he rather admired
her for being able to do it, considering the general scramble
for Quarrier. But let that take care of itself; meanwhile, their
sudden and capricious intimacy had aroused him from the morbid
reaction consequent upon the cheap notoriety which he had brought
upon himself. Let him sponge his slate clean and begin again a
better record, flattered by the solicitude she had so prettily
displayed.</p>

<p>Whistling under his breath the same gay, empty melody, he opened
the top drawer of his dresser, dropped in his mother's letter,
and locking the drawer, pocketed the key. He would have time enough
to read the letter when he went to bed; he did not just now feel
exactly like skimming through the fond, foolish sermon which he
knew had been preached at him through his mother's favourite missionary,
Grace Ferrall. What was the use of dragging in the sad old questions
again&mdash;of repeating his assurances of good behaviour, of reiterating
his promises of moderation and watchfulness, of explaining his
own self-confidence? Better that the letter await his bed time&mdash;his
prayers would be the sincerer the fresher the impression; for
he was old-fashioned enough to say the prayers that an immature
philosophy proved superfluous. For, he thought, if prayer is any
use, it takes only a few minutes to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>So he went down-stairs leisurely, prepared to acquiesce in any
suggestion from anybody, but rather hoping to saunter across Sylvia
Landis' path before being committed.</p>

<p>She was standing beside the fire with Quarrier, one foot on the
fender, apparently too preoccupied to notice him; so he strolled
into the gun-room, which was blue with tobacco smoke and aromatic
with the volatile odours from decanters.</p>

<p>There were a few women there, and the majority of the men. Lord
Alderdene, Major Belwether, and Mortimer were at a table by themselves;
stacks of ivory chips and five cards spread in the centre of the
green explained the nature of their game; and Mortimer, raising
his heavy inflamed eyes and seeing Siward unoccupied, said wheezily:
"Cut out that 'widow,' and give Siward his stack! Anything above
two pairs for a jack triples the ante. Come on, Siward, there's
a decent chap!"</p>

<p>So he seated himself for a sacrifice to the blind goddess balanced
upon her winged wheel; and the cards ran high&mdash;so high that stacks
dwindled or toppled within the half-hour, and Mortimer grew redder
and redder, and Major Belwether blander and blander, and Alderdene's
face wore a continual nervous snicker, showing every white hound's
tooth, and the ice in the tall glasses clinked ceaselessly.</p>

<p>It was late when Quarrier "sat in," with an expressionless acknowledgment
of Siward's presence, and an emotionless raid upon his neighbour's
resources with the first hand dealt, in which he participated
without drawing a card.</p>

<p>And always Siward, eyes on his cards, seemed to see Quarrier
before him, his overmanicured fingers caressing his silky beard,
the symmetrical pompadour dark and thick as the winter fur on
a rat, tufting his smooth blank forehead.</p>

<p>It was very late when Siward first began to be aware of his increasing
deafness, the difficulty, too, that he had in making people hear,
the annoying contempt in Quarrier's woman-like eyes. He felt that
he was making a fool of himself, very noiselessly somehow&mdash;but
with more racket than he expected when he miscalculated the distance
between his hand and a decanter.</p>

<p>It was time for him to go&mdash;unless he chose to ask Quarrier for
an explanation of that sneer which he found distasteful. But there
was too much noise, too much laughter.</p>

<p>Besides he had a matter to attend to&mdash;the careful perusal of
his mother's letter to Mrs. Ferrall.</p>

<p>Very white, he rose. After an indeterminate interval he found
himself entering his room.</p>

<p>The letter was in the dresser; several things seemed to fall
and break, but he got the letter, sank down on the bed's edge
and strove to read,&mdash;set his teeth grimly, forcing his blurred
eyes to a focus. But he could make nothing of it&mdash;nor of his toilet
either, nor of Ferrall, who came in on his way to bed having noticed
the electricity still in full glare over the open transom, and
who straightened out matters for the stunned man lying face downward
across the bed, his mother's letter crushed in his nerveless hand.</p>
