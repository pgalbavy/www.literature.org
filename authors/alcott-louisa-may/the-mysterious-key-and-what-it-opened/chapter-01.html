<blockquote><div>&quot;Trevlyn lands and Trevlyn gold,<br />
Heir nor heiress e'er shall hold,<br />
Undisturbed, till, spite of rust,<br />
Truth is found in Trevlyn dust.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>&quot;This is the third time I've found you poring over that old rhyme. What
is the charm, Richard? Not its poetry I fancy.&quot; And the young wife laid
a slender hand on the yellow, time-worn page where, in Old English text,
appeared the lines she laughed at.</p>

<p>Richard Trevlyn looked up with a smile and threw by the book, as if
annoyed at being discovered reading it. Drawing his wife's hand through
his own, he led her back to her couch, folded the soft shawls about her,
and, sitting in a low chair beside her, said in a cheerful tone, though
his eyes betrayed some hidden care, &quot;My love, that book is a history of
our family for centuries, and that old prophecy has never yet been
fulfilled, except the 'heir and heiress' line. I am the last Trevlyn,
and as the time draws near when my child shall be born, I naturally
think of his future, and hope he will enjoy his heritage in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God grant it!&quot; softly echoed Lady Trevlyn, adding, with a look askance
at the old book, &quot;I read that history once, and fancied it must be a
romance, such dreadful things are recorded in it. Is it all true,
Richard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear. I wish it was not. Ours has been a wild, unhappy race till
the last generation or two. The stormy nature came in with old Sir
Ralph, the fierce Norman knight, who killed his only son in a fit of
wrath, by a blow with his steel gauntlet, because the boy's strong will
would not yield to his.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I remember, and his daughter Clotilde held the castle during a
siege, and married her cousin, Count Hugo. 'Tis a warlike race, and I
like it in spite of the mad deeds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Married her cousin! That has been the bane of our family in times past.
Being too proud to mate elsewhere, we have kept to ourselves till idiots
and lunatics began to appear. My father was the first who broke the law
among us, and I followed his example: choosing the freshest, sturdiest
flower I could find to transplant into our exhausted soil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope it will do you honor by blossoming bravely. I never forget that
you took me from a very humble home, and have made me the happiest wife
in England.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I never forget that you, a girl of eighteen, consented to leave
your hills and come to cheer the long-deserted house of an old man like
me,&quot; returned her husband fondly.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, don't call yourself old, Richard; you are only forty-five, the
boldest, handsomest man in Warwickshire. But lately you look worried;
what is it? Tell me, and let me advise or comfort you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is nothing, Alice, except my natural anxiety for you - Well,
Kingston, what do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>Trevlyn's tender tones grew sharp as he addressed the entering servant,
and the smile on his lips vanished, leaving them dry and white as he
glanced at the card he handed him. An instant he stood staring at it,
then asked, &quot;Is the man here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the library, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll come.&quot;</p>

<p>Flinging the card into the fire, he watched it turn to ashes before he
spoke, with averted eyes: &quot;Only some annoying business, love; I shall
soon be with you again. Lie and rest till I come.&quot;</p>

<p>With a hasty caress he left her, but as he passed a mirror, his wife saw
an expression of intense excitement in his face. She said nothing, and
lay motionless for several minutes evidently struggling with some strong
impulse.</p>

<p>&quot;He is ill and anxious, but hides it from me; I have a right to know,
and he'll forgive me when I prove that it does no harm.&quot;</p>

<p>As she spoke to herself she rose, glided noiselessly through the hall,
entered a small closet built in the thickness of the wall, and, bending
to the keyhole of a narrow door, listened with a half-smile on her lips
at the trespass she was committing. A murmur of voices met her ear. Her
husband spoke oftenest, and suddenly some word of his dashed the smile
from her face as if with a blow. She started, shrank, and shivered,
bending lower with set teeth, white cheeks, and panic-stricken heart.
Paler and paler grew her lips, wilder and wilder her eyes, fainter and
fainter her breath, till, with a long sigh, a vain effort to save
herself, she sank prone upon the threshold of the door, as if struck
down by death.</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy on us, my lady, are you ill?&quot; cried Hester, the maid, as her
mistress glided into the room looking like a ghost, half an hour later.</p>

<p>&quot;I am faint and cold. Help me to my bed, but do not disturb Sir
Richard.&quot;</p>

<p>A shiver crept over her as she spoke, and, casting a wild, woeful look
about her, she laid her head upon the pillow like one who never cared to
lift it up again. Hester, a sharp-eyed, middle-aged woman, watched the
pale creature for a moment, then left the room muttering, &quot;Something is
wrong, and Sir Richard must know it. That black-bearded man came for no
good, I'll warrant.&quot;</p>

<p>At the door of the library she paused. No sound of voices came from
within; a stifled groan was all she heard; and without waiting to knock
she went in, fearing she knew not what. Sir Richard sat at his writing
table pen in hand, but his face was hidden on his arm, and his whole
attitude betrayed the presence of some overwhelming despair.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, sir, my lady is ill. Shall I send for anyone?&quot;</p>

<p>No answer. Hester repeated her words, but Sir Richard never stirred.
Much alarmed, the woman raised his head, saw that he was unconscious,
and rang for help. But Richard Trevlyn was past help, though he lingered
for some hours. He spoke but once, murmuring faintly, &quot;Will Alice come
to say good-bye?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bring her if she can come,&quot; said the physician.</p>

<p>Hester went, found her mistress lying as she left her, like a figure
carved in stone. When she gave the message, Lady Trevlyn answered
sternly, &quot;Tell him I will not come,&quot; and turned her face to the wall,
with an expression which daunted the woman too much for another word.</p>

<p>Hester whispered the hard answer to the physician, fearing to utter it
aloud, but Sir Richard heard it, and died with a despairing prayer for
pardon on his lips.</p>

<p>When day dawned Sir Richard lay in his shroud and his little daughter in
her cradle, the one unwept, the other unwelcomed by the wife and mother,
who, twelve hours before, had called herself the happiest woman in
England. They thought her dying, and at her own command gave her the
sealed letter bearing her address which her husband left behind him. She
read it, laid it in her bosom, and, waking from the trance which seemed
to have so strongly chilled and changed her, besought those about her
with passionate earnestness to save her life.</p>

<p>For two days she hovered on the brink of the grave, and nothing but the
indomitable will to live saved her, the doctors said. On the third day
she rallied wonderfully, and some purpose seemed to gift her with
unnatural strength. Evening came, and the house was very still, for all
the sad bustle of preparation for Sir Richard's funeral was over, and he
lay for the last night under his own roof. Hester sat in the darkened
chamber of her mistress, and no sound broke the hush but the low lullaby
the nurse was singing to the fatherless baby in the adjoining room. Lady
Trevlyn seemed to sleep, but suddenly put back the curtain, saying
abruptly, &quot;Where does he lie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the state chamber, my lady,&quot; replied Hester, anxiously watching the
feverish glitter of her mistress's eye, the flush on her cheek, and the
unnatural calmness of her manner.</p>

<p>&quot;Help me to go there; I must see him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be your death, my lady. I beseech you, don't think of it,&quot;
began the woman; but Lady Trevlyn seemed not to hear her, and something
in the stern pallor of her face awed the woman into submission.</p>

<p>Wrapping the slight form of her mistress in a warm cloak, Hester
half-led, half-carried her to the state room, and left her on the
threshold.</p>

<p>&quot;I must go in alone; fear nothing, but wait for me here,&quot; she said, and
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>Five minutes had not elapsed when she reappeared with no sign of grief
on her rigid face.</p>

<p>&quot;Take me to my bed and bring my jewel box,&quot; she said, with a shuddering
sigh, as the faithful servant received her with an exclamation of
thankfulness.</p>

<p>When her orders had been obeyed, she drew from her bosom the portrait of
Sir Richard which she always wore, and, removing the ivory oval from the
gold case, she locked the former in a tiny drawer of the casket,
replaced the empty locket in her breast, and bade Hester give the jewels
to Watson, her lawyer, who would see them put in a safe place till the
child was grown.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear heart, my lady, you'll wear them yet, for you're too young to
grieve all your days, even for so good a man as my blessed master. Take
comfort, and cheer up, for the dear child's sake if no more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall never wear them again&quot; was all the answer as Lady Trevlyn drew
the curtains, as if to shut out hope.</p>

<p>Sir Richard was buried and, the nine days' gossip over, the mystery of
his death died for want of food, for the only person who could have
explained it was in a state which forbade all allusion to that tragic
day.</p>

<p>For a year Lady Trevlyn's reason was in danger. A long fever left her so
weak in mind and body that there was little hope of recovery, and her
days were passed in a state of apathy sad to witness. She seemed to have
forgotten everything, even the shock which had so sorely stricken her.
The sight of her child failed to rouse her, and month after month
slipped by, leaving no trace of their passage on her mind, and but
slightly renovating her feeble body.</p>

<p>Who the stranger was, what his aim in coming, or why he never
reappeared, no one discovered. The contents of the letter left by Sir
Richard were unknown, for the paper had been destroyed by Lady Trevlyn
and no clue could be got from her. Sir Richard had died of heart
disease, the physicians said, though he might have lived years had no
sudden shock assailed him. There were few relatives to make
investigations, and friends soon forgot the sad young widow; so the
years rolled on, and Lillian the heiress grew from infancy to childhood
in the shadow of this mystery.</p>
