<P>
THE letters to Lady Lundie and to Mr. Crum having been dispatched
on Monday, the return of the post might be looked for on
Wednesday afternoon at Ham Farm.
<P>
Sir Patrick and Arnold held more than one private consultation,
during the interval, on the delicate and difficult subject of
admitting Blanche to a knowledge of what had happened. The wise
elder advised and the inexperienced junior listened. "Think of
it," said Sir Patrick; "and do it." And Arnold thought of it--and
left it undone.
<P>
Let those who feel inclined to blame him remember that he had
only been married a fortnight. It is hard, surely, after but two
weeks' possession of your wife, to appear before her in the
character of an offender on trial--and to find that an angel of
retribution has been thrown into the bargain by the liberal
destiny which bestowed on you the woman whom you adore!
<P>
They were all three at home on the Wednesday afternoon, looking
out for the postman.
<P>
The correspondence delivered included (exactly as Sir Patrick had
foreseen) a letter from Lady Lundie. Further investigation, on
the far more interesting subject of the expected news from
Glasgow, revealed--nothing. The lawyer had not answered Sir
Patrick's inquiry by return of post.
<P>
"Is that a bad sign?" asked Blanche.
<P>
"It is a sign that something has happened," answered her uncle.
"Mr. Crum is possibly expecting to receive some special
information, and is waiting on the chance of being able to
communicate it. We must hope, my dear, in to-morrow's post."
<P>
"Open Lady Lundie's letter in the mean time," said Blanche. "Are
you sure it is for you--and not for me?"
<P>
There was no doubt about it. Her ladyship's reply was ominously
addressed to her ladyship's brother-in-law. "I know what that
means." said Blanche, eying her uncle eagerly while he was
reading the letter. "If you mention Anne's name you insult my
step-mother. I have mentioned it freely. Lady Lundie is mortally
offended with me."
<P>
Rash judgment of youth! A lady who takes a dignified attitude, in
a family emergency, is never mortally offended--she is only
deeply grieved. Lady Lundie took a dignified attitude. "I well
know," wrote this estimable and Christian woman, "that I have
been all along regarded in the light of an intruder by the family
connections of my late beloved husband. But I was hardly prepared
to find myself entirely shut out from all domestic confidence, at
a time when some serious domestic catastrophe has but too
evidently taken place. I have no desire, dear Sir Patrick, to
intrude. Feeling it, however, to be quite inconsistent with a due
regard for my own position--after what has happened--to
correspond with Blanche, I address myself to the head of the
family, purely in the interests of propriety. Permit me to ask
whether--under circumstances which appear to be serious enough to
require the recall of my step-daughter and her husband from their
wedding tour--you think it DECENT to keep the widow of the late
Sir Thomas Lundie entirely in the dark? Pray consider this--not
at all out of regard for Me!--but out of regard for your own
position with Society. Curiosity is, as you know, foreign to my
nature. But when this dreadful scandal (whatever it may be) comes
out--which, dear Sir Patrick, it can not fail to do--what will
the world think, when it asks for Lady Lundie's, opinion, and
hears that Lady Lundie knew nothing about it? Whichever way you
may decide I shall take no offense. I may possibly be
wounded--but that won't matter. My little round of duties will
find me still earnest, still cheerful. And even if you shut me
out, my best wishes will find their way, nevertheless, to Ham
Farm. May I add--without encountering a sneer--that the prayers
of a lonely woman are offered for the welfare of all?"
<P>
"Well?" said Blanche.
<P>
Sir Patrick folded up the letter, and put it in his pocket.
<P>
"You have your step-mother's best wishes, my dear." Having
answered in those terms, he bowed to his niece with his best
grace, and walked out of the room.
<P>
"Do I think it decent,"  he repeated to himself, as he closed the
door, "to leave the widow of the late Sir Thomas Lundie in the
dark? When a lady's temper is a little ruffled, I think it more
than decent, I think it absolutely desirable, to let that lady
have the last word." He went into the library, and dropped his
sister-in-law's remonstrance into a box, labeled "Unanswered
Letters." Having got rid of it in that way, he hummed his
favorite little Scotch air--and put on his hat, and went out to
sun himself in the garden.
<P>
Meanwhile, Blanche was not quite satisfied with Sir Patrick's
reply. She appealed to her husband. "There is something wrong,"
she said--"and my uncle is hiding it from me."
<P>
Arnold could have desired no better opportunity than she had
offered to him, in those words, for making the long-deferred
disclosure to her of the truth. He lifted his eyes to Blanche's
face. By an unhappy fatality she was looking charmingly that
morning. How would she look if he told her the story of the
hiding at the inn? Arnold was still in love with her--and Arnold
said nothing.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The next day's post brought not only the anticipated letter from
Mr. Crum, but an unexpected Glasgow newspaper as well.
<P>
This time Blanche had no reason to complain that her uncle kept
his correspondence a secret from her. After reading the lawyer's
letter, with an interest and agitation which showed that the
contents had taken him by surprise, he handed it to Arnold and
his niece. "Bad news there," he said. "We must share it
together."
<P>
After acknowledging the receipt of Sir Patrick's letter of
inquiry, Mr. Crum began by stating all that he knew of Miss
Silvester's movements--dating from the time when she had left the
Sheep's Head Hotel. About a fortnight since he had received a
letter from her informing him that she had found a suitable place
of residence in a village near Glasgow. Feeling a strong interest
in Miss Silvester, Mr. Crum had visited her some few days
afterward. He had satisfied himself that she was lodging with
respectable people, and was as comfortably situated as
circumstances would permit. For a week more he had heard nothing
from the lady. At the expiration of that time he had received a
letter from her, telling him that she had read something in a
Glasgow newspaper, of that day's date, which seriously concerned
herself, and which would oblige her to travel northward
immediately as fast as her strength would permit. At a later
period, when she would be more certain of her own movements, she
engaged to write again, and let Mr. Crum know where he might
communicate with her if necessary. In the mean time, she could
only thank him for his kindness, and beg him to take care of any
letters or messages which might be left for her. Since the
receipt of this communication the lawyer had heard nothing
further. He had waited for the morning's post in the hope of
being able to report that he had received some further
intelligence. The hope had not been realized. He had now stated
all that he knew himself thus far--and he had forwarded a copy of
the newspaper alluded to by Miss Silvester, on the chance that an
examination of it by Sir Patrick might possibly lead to further
discoveries. In conclusion, he pledged himself to write again the
moment he had any information to send.
<P>
Blanche snatched up the newspaper, and opened it. "Let me look!"
she said. "I can find what Anne saw here if any body can!"
<P>
She ran her eye eagerly over column after column and page after
page--and dropped the newspaper on her lap with a gesture of
despair.
<P>
"Nothing!" she exclaimed. "Nothing any where, that I can see, to
interest Anne. Nothing to interest any body--except Lady Lundie,"
she went on, brushing the newspaper off her lap. "It turns out to
be all true, Arnold, at Swanhaven. Geoffrey Delamayn is going to
marry Mrs. Glenarm."
<P>
"What!" cried Arnold; the idea instantly flashing on him that
this was the news which Anne had seen.
<P>
Sir Patrick gave him a warning look, and picked up the newspaper
from the floor.
<P>
"I may as well run through it, Blanche, and make quite sure that
you have missed nothing," he said.
<P>
The report to which Blanche had referred was among the paragraphs
arranged under the heading of "Fashionable News." "A matrimonial
alliance" (the Glasgow journal announced) "was in prospect
between the Honorable Geoffrey Delamayn and the lovely and
accomplished relict of the late Mathew Glenarm, Esq., formerly
Miss Newenden." The, marriage would, in all probability, "be
solemnized in Scotland, before the end of the present autumn;"
and the wedding breakfast, it was whispered, "would collect a
large and fashionable party at Swanhaven Lodge."
<P>
Sir Patrick handed the newspaper silently to Arnold. It was plain
to any one who knew Anne Silvester's story that those were the
words which had found their fatal way to her in her place of
rest. The inference that followed seemed to be hardly less clear.
But one intelligible object, in the opinion of Sir Patrick, could
be at the end of her journey to the north. The deserted woman had
rallied the last relics of her old energy--and had devoted
herself to the desperate purpose of stopping the marriage of Mrs.
Glenarm.
<P>
Blanche was the first to break the silence.
<P>
"It seems like a fatality," she said. "Perpetual failure!
Perpetual disappointment! Are Anne and I doomed never to meet
again?"
<P>
She looked at her uncle. Sir Patrick showed none of his customary
cheerfulness in the face of disaster.
<P>
"She has promised to write to Mr. Crum," he said. "And Mr. Crum
has promised to let us know when he hears from her. That is the
only prospect before us. We must accept it as resignedly as we
can."
<P>
Blanche wandered out listlessly among the flowers in the
conservatory. Sir Patrick made no secret of the impression
produced upon him by Mr. Crum's letter, when he and Arnold were
left alone.
<P>
"There is no denying," he said, "that matters have taken a very
serious turn. My plans and calculations are all thrown out. It is
impossible to foresee what new mischief may not come of it, if
those two women meet; or what desperate act Delamayn may not
commit, if he finds himself driven to the wall. As things are, I
own frankly I don't know what to do next. A great light of the
Presbyterian Church," he added, with a momentary outbreak of his
whimsical humor, "once declared, in my hearing, that the
invention of printing was nothing more or less than a proof of
the intellectual activity of the Devil. Upon my honor, I feel for
the first time in my life inclined to agree with him."
<P>
He mechanically took up the Glasgow journal, which Arnold had
laid aside, while he spoke.
<P>
"What's this!" he exclaimed, as a name caught his eye in the
first line of the newspaper at which he happened to look. "Mrs.
Glenarm again! Are they turning the iron-master's widow into a
public character?"
<P>
There the name of the widow was, unquestionably; figuring for the
second time in type, in a letter of the gossiping sort, supplied
by an "Occasional Correspondent," and distinguished by the title
of "Sayings and Doings in the North." After tattling pleasantly
of the prospects of the shooting season, of the fashions from
Paris, of an accident to a tourist, and of a scandal in the
Scottish Kirk, the writer proceeded to the narrative of a case of
interest, relating to a marriage in the sphere known (in the
language of footmen) as the sphere of "high life."
<P>
Considerable sensation (the correspondent announced) had been
caused in Perth and its neighborhood, by the exposure of an
anonymous attempt at extortion, of which a lady of distinction
had lately been made the object. As her name had already been
publicly mentioned in an application to the magistrates, there
could be no impropriety in stating that the lady in question was
Mrs. Glenarm--whose approaching union with the Honorable Geoffrey
Delamayn was alluded to in another column of the journal.
<P>
Mrs. Glenarm had, it appeared, received an anonymous letter, on
the first day of her arrival as guest at the house of a friend,
residing in the neighborhood of Perth. The letter warned her that
there was an obstacle, of which she was herself probably not
aware, in the way of her projected marriage with Mr. Geoffrey
Delamayn. That gentleman had seriously compr omised himself with
another lady; and the lady would oppose his marriage to Mrs.
Glenarm, with proof in writing to produce in support of her
claim. The proof was contained in two letters exchanged between
the parties, and signed by their names; and the correspondence
was placed at Mrs. Glenarm's disposal, on two conditions, as
follows:
<P>
First, that she should offer a sufficiently liberal price to
induce the present possessor of the letters to part with them.
Secondly, that she should consent to adopt such a method of
paying the money as should satisfy the person that he was in no
danger of finding himself brought within reach of the law. The
answer to these two proposals was directed to be made through the
medium of an advertisement in the local newspaper--distinguished
by this address, "To a Friend in the Dark."
<P>
Certain turns of expression, and one or two mistakes in spelling,
pointed to this insolent letter as being, in all probability, the
production of a Scotchman, in the lower ranks of life. Mrs.
Glenarm had at once shown it to her nearest relative, Captain
Newenden. The captain had sought legal advice in Perth. It had
been decided, after due consideration, to insert the
advertisement demanded, and to take measures to entrap the writer
of the letter into revealing himself--without, it is needless to
add, allowing the fellow really to profit by his attempted act of
extortion.
<P>
The cunning of the "Friend in the Dark" (whoever he might be)
had, on trying the proposed experiment, proved to be more than a
match for the lawyers. He had successfully eluded not only the
snare first set for him, but others subsequently laid. A second,
and a third, anonymous letter, one more impudent than the other
had been received by Mrs. Glenarm, assuring that lady and the
friends who were acting for her that they were only wasting time
and raising the price which would be asked for the
correspondence, by the course they were taking. Captain Newenden
had thereupon, in default of knowing what other course to pursue,
appealed publicly to the city magistrates, and a reward had been
offered, under the sanction of the municipal authorities, for the
discovery of the man. This proceeding also having proved quite
fruitless, it was understood that the captain had arranged, with
the concurrence of his English solicitors, to place the matter in
the hands of an experienced officer of the London police.
<P>
Here, so far as the newspaper correspondent was aware, the affair
rested for the present.
<P>
It was only necessary to add, that Mrs. Glenarm had left the
neighborhood of Perth, in order to escape further annoyance; and
had placed herself under the protection of friends in another
part of the county. Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn, whose fair fame had
been assailed (it was needless, the correspondent added in
parenthesis, to say how groundlessly), was understood to have
expressed, not only the indignation natural under the
circumstances but also his extreme regret at not finding himself
in a position to aid Captain Newenden's efforts to bring the
anonymous slanderer to justice. The honorable gentleman was, as
the sporting public were well aware, then in course of strict
training for his forthcoming appearance at the Fulham Foot-Race.
So important was it considered that his mind should not be
harassed by annoyances, in his present responsible position, that
his trainer and his principal backers had thought it desirable to
hasten his removal to the neighborhood of Fulham--where the
exercises which were to prepare him for the race were now being
continued on the spot.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"The mystery seems to thicken," said Arnold.
<P>
"Quite the contrary," returned Sir Patrick, briskly. "The mystery
is clearing fast--thanks to the Glasgow newspaper. I shall be
spared the trouble of dealing with Bishopriggs for the stolen
letter. Miss Silvester has gone to Perth, to recover her
correspondence with Geoffrey Delamayn."
<P>
"Do you think she would recognize it," said Arnold, pointing to
the newspaper, "in the account given of it here?"
<P>
"Certainly! And she could hardly fail, in my opinion, to get a
step farther than that. Unless I am entirely mistaken, the
authorship of the anonymous letters has not mystified _her._"
<P>
"How could she guess at that?"
<P>
"In this way, as I think. Whatever she may have previously
thought, she must suspect, by this time, that the missing
correspondence has been stolen, and not lost. Now, there are only
two persons whom she can think of, as probably guilty of the
theft--Mrs. Inchbare or Bishopriggs. The newspaper description of
the style of the anonymous letters declares it to be the style of
a Scotchman in the lower ranks of life--in other words, points
plainly to Bishopriggs. You see that? Very well. Now suppose she
recovers the stolen property. What is likely to happen then? She
will be more or less than woman if she doesn't make her way next,
provided with her proofs in writing, to Mrs. Glenarm. She may
innocently help, or she may innocently frustrate, the end we have
in view--either way, our course is clear before us again. Our
interest in communicating with Miss Silvester remains precisely
the same interest that it was before we received the Glasgow
newspaper. I propose to wait till Sunday, on the chance that Mr.
Crum may write again. If we don't hear from him, I shall start
for Scotland on Monday morning, and take my chance of finding my
way to Miss Silvester, through Mrs. Glenarm."
<P>
"Leaving me behind?"
<P>
"Leaving you behind. Somebody must stay with Blanche. After
having only been a fortnight married, must I remind you of that?"
<P>
"Don't you think Mr. Crum will write before Monday?"
<P>
"It will be such a fortunate circumstance for us, if he does
write, that I don't venture to anticipate it."
<P>
"You are down on our luck, Sir."
<P>
"I detest slang, Arnold. But slang, I own, expresses my state of
mind, in this instance, with an accuracy which almost reconciles
me to the use of it--for once in a way."
<P>
"Every body's luck turns sooner or later," persisted Arnold. "I
can't help thinking our luck is on the turn at last. Would you
mind taking a bet, Sir Patrick?"
<P>
"Apply at the stables. I leave betting, as I leave cleaning the
horses, to my groom."
<P>
With that crabbed answer he closed the conversation for the day.
<P>
The hours passed, and time brought the post again in due
course--and the post decided in Arnold's favor! Sir Patrick's
want of confidence in the favoring patronage of Fortune was
practically rebuked by the arrival of a second letter from the
Glasgow lawyer on the next day.
<P>
"I have the pleasure of announcing" (Mr. Crum wrote) "that I have
heard from Miss Silvester, by the next postal delivery ensuing,
after I had dispatched my letter to Ham Farm. She writes, very
briefly, to inform me that she has decided on establishing her
next place of residence in London. The reason assigned for taking
this step--which she certainly did not contemplate when I last
saw her--is that she finds herself approaching the end of her
pecuniary resources. Having already decided on adopting, as a
means of living, the calling of a concert-singer, she has
arranged to place her interests in the hands of an old friend of
her late mother (who appears to have belonged also to the musical
profession): a dramatic and musical agent long established in the
metropolis, and well known to her as a trustworthy and
respectable man. She sends me the name and address of this
person--a copy of which you will find on the inclosed slip of
paper--in the event of my having occasion to write to her, before
she is settled in London. This is the whole substance of her
letter. I have only to add, that it does not contain the
slightest allusion to the nature of the errand on which she left
Glasgow."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Sir Patrick happened to be alone when he opened Mr. Crum's
letter.
<P>
His first proceeding, after reading it, was to consult the
railway time-table hanging in the hall. Having done this, he
returned to the library--wrote a short note of inquiry, addressed
to the musical agent--and rang the bell.
<P>
"Miss Silvester is expected in London, Duncan. I want a discreet
person to communicate with her. You are the person."
<P>
Duncan bowed. Sir Pa trick handed him the note.
<P>
"If you start at once you will be in time to catch the train. Go
to that address, and inquire for Miss Silvester. If she has
arrived, give her my compliments, and say I will have the honor
of calling on her (on Mr. Brinkworth's behalf) at the earliest
date which she may find it convenient to appoint. Be quick about
it--and you will have time to get back before the last train.
Have Mr. and Mrs. Brinkworth returned from their drive?"
<P>
"No, Sir Patrick."
<P>
Pending the return of Arnold and Blanche, Sir Patrick looked at
Mr. Crum's letter for the second time.
<P>
He was not quite satisfied that the pecuniary motive was really
the motive at the bottom of Anne's journey south. Remembering
that Geoffrey's trainers had removed him to the neighborhood of
London, he was inclined to doubt whether some serious quarrel had
not taken place between Anne and Mrs. Glenarm--and whether some
direct appeal to Geoffrey himself might not be in contemplation
as the result. In that event, Sir Patrick's advice and assistance
would be placed, without scruple, at Miss Silvester's disposal.
By asserting her claim, in opposition to the claim of Mrs.
Glenarm, she was also asserting herself to be an unmarried woman,
and was thus serving Blanche's interests as well as her own. "I
owe it to Blanche to help her," thought Sir Patrick. "And I owe
it to myself to bring Geoffrey Delamayn to a day of reckoning if
I can."
<P>
The barking of the dogs in the yard announced the return of the
carriage. Sir Patrick went out to meet Arnold and Blanche at the
gate, and tell them the news.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Punctual to the time at which he was expected, the discreet
Duncan reappeared with a note from the musical agent.
<P>
Miss Silvester had not yet reached London; but she was expected
to arrive not later than Tuesday in the ensuing week. The agent
had already been favored with her instructions to pay the
strictest attention to any commands received from Sir Patrick
Lundie. He would take care that Sir Patrick's message should be
given to Miss Silvester as soon as she arrived.
<P>
At last, then, there was news to be relied on! At last there was
a prospect of seeing her! Blanche was radiant with happiness,
Arnold was in high spirits for the first time since his return
from Baden.
<P>
Sir Patrick tried hard to catch the infection of gayety from his
young friends; but, to his own surprise, not less than to theirs,
the effort proved fruitless. With the tide of events turning
decidedly in his favor--relieved of the necessity of taking a
doubtful journey to Scotland; assured of obtaining his interview
with Anne in a few days' time--he was out of spirits all through
the evening.
<P>
"Still down on our luck!" exclaimed Arnold, as he and his host
finished their last game of billiards, and parted for the night.
"Surely, we couldn't wish for a more promising prospect than
_our_ prospect next week?"
<P>
Sir Patrick laid his hand on Arnold's shoulder.
<P>
"Let us look indulgently together," he said, in his whimsically
grave way, "at the humiliating spectacle of an old man's folly. I
feel, at this moment, Arnold, as if I would give every thing that
I possess in the world to have passed over next week, and to be
landed safely in the time beyond it."
<P>
"But why?"
<P>
"There is the folly! I can't tell why. With every reason to be in
better spirits than usual, I am unaccountably, irrationally,
invincibly depressed. What are we to conclude from that? Am I the
object of a supernatural warning of misfortune to come? Or am I
the object of a temporary derangement of the functions of the
liver? There is the question. Who is to decide it? How
contemptible is humanity, Arnold, rightly understood! Give me my
candle, and let's hope it's the liver."
