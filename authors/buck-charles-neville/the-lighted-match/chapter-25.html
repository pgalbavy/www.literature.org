<p>Martin, tall and aggressively British, from the black silk tassel on his
red fez to the battered puttees and brown boots that had once come out
of Bond Street, stood watching the <u>Isis</u> outlined against the opposite
walls of the Yildiz Kiosk.
</p><p>Few pleasure-craft call at Constantinople.
</p><p>"If you had not, as usual, been so damned late"--he turned with a
gesture of raw impatience to the heavy-faced <u>Osmanli</u> at his side--"I
could have pointed them out to you on Galata Bridge. As it is, they have
returned to the yacht."
</p><p>"May Heaven never again thwart your wish with delay, Martin <u>Effendi</u>."
The Turk spoke placidly, his oily voice soft as a benediction, "I was
delayed by pigs, and sons of pigs! Your annoyance is my desolating
sorrow, yet"--he waved his hand with a bland gesture--"I am but the
servant of His Majesty, the Sultan--whom Allah preserve--and the
official is frequently detained."
</p><p>"What is done, is done. <u>Bismillah</u>--no matter!" The Englishman curbed
his annoyance and spoke as one resigned. "What now remains is this: We
must see them, and you must learn to recognize them. You understand?"
</p><p>The other bowed in unperturbed assent.
</p><p>"All Europeans," he suggested, "dine at the Pera Palace Hotel--it is the
Mecca of their hunger."
</p><p>To the white man's voice returned the ring of asperity. "And at the Pera
Palace, we shall not only see, but be seen. Likewise unless we have a
care in this enterprise, we shall not only eat, but be eaten. A man may
stare at whom he chooses on Galata Bridge."
</p><p>"When I dine in a public place"--the <u>Osmanli</u> smiled cunningly from the
depths of small pig-like eyes--"I shield myself behind a screen. Thus
may I observe unobserved."
</p><p>The sun had set, but the yellow after-glow still lingered in the sky
behind Stamboul as the two men stood looking toward Galata Bridge, where
their quarry had escaped them, and across the Golden Horn.
</p><p>A pyramid of domes, flanked by a pair of slender minarets, daintily
proclaimed the Mosque Yeni-Djami against the fading amber. On Galata
Bridge itself, the day-long tide of medleyed life was thinning. Where
there had been an eddying current of turbans and <u>tarbooshes</u>,
bespeaking all the tribes and styles which foregather at the meeting
place of two Continents and two seas, there were now only the belated
few.
</p><p>To the jaded imagination of Martin <u>Effendi</u> and his companion, Abdul
Said <u>Bey</u>, the falling of night over the quadruple city, smothering
more than a million souls under a single blanket of blackness, made no
appeal. They were watching a yacht.
</p><p>Over the Pera roofs swept flocks of crows to roost in their garden
rookeries at the center of the town. Across the harbor water, now too
gloomy to reveal its thousands of jelly-fish, drifted the complaining
cries of the loons. Then as the occasional city lamps began to twinkle,
making the darkness murkier by their inadequacy, there arose from the
twisting ways of Pera, Galata and Stamboul the night howling of thirty
thousand dogs.
</p><p>At length Martin held up the dial of his watch to the uncertain light.
</p><p>"I must be off," he announced. "Jusseret is waiting at the Pera Palace.
Don't fail us at seven-thirty."
</p><p>The tireless features of Abdul Said <u>Bey</u> once more shaped themselves
into a deliberate smile. "Of a surety, <u>Effendi</u>. May your virtues ever
find favor in the sight of Allah."
</p><p>For a moment the pig-like eyes followed the well-knit figure of the
Englishman as it went swinging along the street. Then the Turk turned
and lost himself in the darkness.
</p><p>The Pera Palace Hotel stands in the European quarter of the town. To its
doors your steps are guided by a trail of shop signs in English, French,
German and Greek, among which appear only occasional characters in the
native Arabic.
</p><p>Almost immediately after Cara, Pagratide and Benton had seated
themselves in the dining-room that evening, Arab servants secluded a
corner table, close to their own, behind <u>mushrabieh</u> screens. The party
for whom this distinguished aloofness had been arranged made its
entrance through an unseen door, but the voices indicated that several
were at table there. The waiter who served this table apart might have
testified that one was an Englishman, wearing in addition to European
evening dress the native <u>tarboosh</u>, or fez. Also, that against his
white shirt-front glittered the Star of Galavia. The second diner wore
one of the many elaborate uniforms that signify Ottoman officialdom. His
eyes were small and pig-like, and as he talked no feature or gesture at
the table beyond escaped his appraising scrutiny.
</p><p>There was one other behind the <u>mushrabieh</u> screens. The niceties of his
dress were Parisian, punctilious, perfect. In his right lapel was the
unostentatious button of the <u>Legion d'Honneur</u>.
</p><p>The Englishman spoke. "Much of your story, <u>Monsieur</u> Jusseret, is
familiar to me. It will, however, prove interesting <u>in toto</u>, I
daresay, to our friend Abdul Said <u>Bey</u>, whom Allah preserve."
</p><p>There was a murmur of compliment from the Turk, adding his assurance of
interest, and the Frenchman took up the thread of his narrative.
</p><p>"We supposed that Karyl was dead--the Throne of Galavia clear for
Delgado. Alas, we were in error!" The speaker shook his head in deep
regret, as, turning to Martin, he added:
</p><p>"It was a pardonable mistake. Let us hope the announcement was merely
premature." He lifted his wine-glass with the air of one proposing a
toast. "It becomes our duty to make that statement true. <u>Messieurs</u>,
our success!"
</p><p>When the three glasses had been set down, the Englishman questioned:
"How did it occur?"
</p><p>In the smooth manner of an after-dinner narrative, Jusseret explained
the occurrences of the night when he had brought his plans to an almost
successful termination. He told his story with charm of recital, verve
and humor, and gave it withal a touch of vivid realism, so that even his
auditors, long since graduated from the stage where a tale of
adventurous undertaking thrilled them, yet listened with profound
interest.
</p><p>With the salad Jusseret sighed regretfully.
</p><p>"I rather plume myself on one quality of my work, <u>Monsieur</u> Martin. I
rarely overlook an integral detail. I, however, find myself growing
alarmingly faulty of judgment."
</p><p>"Indeed!" The Englishman was not greatly engrossed in the
autobiographical phases of Jusseret's diplomatic felonies.
</p><p>"I regret to acknowledge it, but it is, alas, true. I reflected that the
world would resent harsh treatment of a man like Von Ritz. He had
committed no crime. We could not charge treason against a government not
yet born. I opposed even exile. He immediately rejoined his fleeing
King--and has since returned to Puntal, where one can only surmise what
mischief he agitates. It may be as well to consider his future."
</p><p>"And now," callously supplemented the Englishman, "our new King feels an
uncertainty of tenure so long as the old King lives, and I am rushed
after this refugee Monarch with brief instructions to dispose of him."
</p><p>There was a certain eloquence in the shrug of Jusseret's shoulders.
"<u>Messieurs</u>, we have wrecked Karyl's dynasty, but it still devolves
upon us in workmanlike fashion to clear away the d√©bris."
</p><p>Martin leaned forward and put his query like an attorney cross-examining
a witness.
</p><p>"Where was this Queen when the King was taken?"
</p><p>"That," replied Jusseret, "is a question to be put to Von Ritz or
Karyl. It would appear that Von Ritz suspected the end and, wise as he
is in the cards of diplomacy, resolved that should his King be taken, he
would still hold his Queen in reserve. That Kingdom does not hold to the
Salic Law--a Queen may reign! And so you see, my colleagues," he
summarized, "we, representing the plans of Europe, find ourselves
confronted with questions unanswered, and with matters yet to do."
</p><p>Martin's voice was matter-of-fact. "After all," he observed, "what are
the odds, where the King was or where the Queen was at a given time in
the past, so long as we jolly well know where they are to-night?"
Turning to the Sultan's officer, he spoke rapidly. "You understand what
is expected?" He pointed one hand to the party from the yacht. "The man
nearest us is the King who failed to remain dead. That failure is
curable if you play your game." He paused. "The lady," he added, "has
the misfortune to have been the Queen of Galavia. You understand, my
brother?"
</p><p>The Turk rose, pushing back his chair.
</p><p>"Your words are illuminating." He spoke with a profound bow. "In serving
you, I shall bring honor to my children, and my children's children."
With the Turkish gesture of farewell, his fingers touching heart, lips
and forehead, he betook himself backward to the door.
</p><p>Two hours later, alighting from a rickety victoria by the landing-stage,
Cara made her way between the two men, toward the waiting launch from
the <u>Isis</u>. Filthy looking Arabs, to the number of a dozen, rose out of
the shadows and crowded about the trio, pleading piteously for
<u>backshish</u> in the name of Allah. The party found itself forced back
towards the carriage, and Benton fingered the grip of the revolver in
his pocket as the other hand held the girl's arm. At the same moment
there was a sudden clamor of shouting and the patter of running feet.
Then the throng of beggars dropped back under the pelting blows from
heavy <u>naboots</u> in the hands of <u>kavasses</u>.
</p><p>An instant later a stout Turk in official uniform broke through the
confusion, shouting imprecations.
</p><p>"Back, you children of swine!" he declaimed. "Back to your mires, you
pigs! Do you dare to affront the great <u>Pashas</u>?" Then, turning
obsequiously, he bowed with profound apology. "It is a bitter sorrow
that you should be annoyed," he assured them, "but it is over."
</p><p>"To whom have we the honor of expressing our thanks?" smiled Pagratide.
</p><p>The <u>Osmanli</u> responded with a deprecating gesture of self-effacement.
</p><p>"To one of the least of men," he said. "I am called Abdul Said <u>Bey</u>. I
am the humble servant of His Majesty, the Sultan--whom Allah preserve."
</p><p>As the launch put off, the elliptical figure of Abdul Said <u>Bey</u>, on the
lowest step of the landing, speeded its departure with a gesture of
ceremonious farewell--fingers sweeping heart, lips and forehead. "If you
go to shop in Stamboul," he shouted after them, "have a care. The pigs
will cheat you--all save Mohammed Abbas."
</p><p>When the reflected lights of the launch shimmered in vague downward
shafts at a distance, he turned and the scattered throng of beggars
regathered to group themselves about him with no trace of fear.
</p><p>"You will know them when you see them in the bazaars?" he demanded. "You
shall be taught in time what is expected--likewise <u>bastinadoed</u> upon
your bare soles if you fail. Now you have only to remember the faces of
the Infidels. Go!" He swept out his hand and the Bedouins scattered like
rats into a dozen dark places.
</p><hr/>
<p>If the panorama of Constantinople fades from a lurid silhouette to a
sooty monotone by night, it at least makes amends by day. Then the sun,
shining out of a sky of intense blue, on water vividly green, catches
the tiled color-chips of the sprawling town; glints on dome and
minaret, and makes such a city as might be seen in a kaleidoscope.
</p><p>Her insatiable appetite for beauty had brought Cara on deck early. The
early shore-wind tossed unruly brown curls into her eyes and across the
delicate pink of her cheeks.
</p><p>When the yachtsman joined her, she read in his eyes that he had been
long awake and was deeply troubled. In the shadow of the after-cabin she
stopped him with a light touch on his arm.
</p><p>"Now tell me," she demanded, "what is the matter?"
</p><p>His voice was quiet. "There is nothing in my thoughts that you cannot
read--so--" He lifted the eyes in question, half-despairing despite the
smile he had schooled into them. "Why rehearse it all again?"
</p><p>Her face clouded.
</p><p>He turned his gaze on the single dome and four minarets of the Mosque of
Suleyman.
</p><p>"Besides," he added at length, speaking in a steady monotone, "I
couldn't tell it without saying things that are forbidden."
</p><p>When she spoke the dominant note in her voice was weariness.
</p><p>"My life," she said, "is a miserable serial of calling on you and
sending you away. Back there"--she waved her hand to the vague west--"it
is summer--wonderful American summer! The woods are thick and green....
The big rocks by the creek are splotched yellow with the sun, and green
with the moss.... I wonder who rides Spartan now, when the hounds are
out!" She broke off suddenly, with a sobbing catch in her throat, then
she shook her head sadly. "You see, you must go!" she added. "You will
take my heart with you--but that is better than this."
</p><p>She turned and led the way forward and for the length of the deck he
walked at her side in silence.
</p><p>As they halted he demanded, very low; "And you--?"
</p><p>Her answering smile was pallid as she quoted, "'More than a little
lonely'--" then, reverting to her old name for him, she laughed with
counterfeited gayety--"as, Sir Gray Eyes, people must be--who try to be
good."
