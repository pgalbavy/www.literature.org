<p>Every boy and girl should cultivate a cheerful disposition. You
will have grief and trouble, and must shed many a tear; but cheerfulness
does more than anything else to lighten the burdens of life.</p>

<p>Have a kind word for every one. If there is a deformed boy or
girl in school, never notice it by look or word. If a boy has
a drunken father or any disgrace attaches to his family, always
act as though you never heard of it. If he is poor and in need,
make him such presents as you can afford. It will add much to
your own happiness if now and then you give something which you
think you cannot afford.</p>

<p>If some little girl wears odd-looking dresses, do not hurt her
feelings by laughing at her. Show her kindness and make her feel
at home when in your company.</p>

<p>Be respectful to old age. Elderly persons are sometimes fretful
and say provoking things to children; but it is easy for you to
keep back all impudent replies and to show that you feel no ill
will toward them.</p>

<p>You should not only be obedient to your parents, but should feel
pleasure in obeying them. No matter how you are employed, or what
your own wishes are, show an eagerness to do whatever they may
request. When father and mother leave you forever, you will be
thankful beyond expression, if you can say you never caused them
to shed a tear or feel any sorrow.</p>

<p>Be respectful and obedient to your teacher. Strive to obey all
his rules in spirit and letter. Be attentive to what he says,
and show by your conduct as well as by your words that you are
grateful for his interest in and labors for you. It is you who
will feel the most pleasure at all times, by striving to be cheerful.
In truth, you will not have to strive long, for it will come natural
to be cheerful.</p>

<p>Don't sulk and never repay evil for evil. If some one has done
you an injury, the best way to "get even" is by an act of kindness;
but be ready to protect the helpless against those who would oppress
them. There are persons whose coming is like so much beautiful
sunshine; there are others who are cross and disagreeable and
whom no one likes. Strive, every day, to make some one happy,
and live by the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have
others do to you."</p>

<p>  What should every boy and girl cultivate? Why?</p>

<p>  What about kind words? Suppose you have a deformed class-mate,
or   one to whom some disgrace attaches?</p>

<p>  Suppose some little girl wears odd-looking clothes?</p>

<p>  What of old age?</p>

<p>  In what does true obedience to your parents consist? What will
be   the result of such obedience?</p>

<p>  How should you treat your teacher? Who is most benefited by
such a   course of action?</p>

<p>  What of sulking? What is the best manner of "getting even"
with some   one who has done you a wrong? What should you strive
every day to   do? What is the Golden Rule of life? </p>
