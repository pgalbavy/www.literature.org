<P>
In the meanwhile Emily had been true to her promise to relieve
Mirabel's anxieties, on the subject of Miss Jethro. Entering the
drawing-room in search of Alban, she found him talking with
Cecilia, and heard her own name mentioned as she opened the door.
<P>
"Here she is at last!" Cecilia exclaimed. "What in the world has
kept you all this time in the rose garden?"
<P>
"Has Mr. Mirabel been more interesting than usual?" Alban asked
gayly. Whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in Emily's
absence, was forgotten the moment she appeared; all traces of
trouble in his face vanished when they looked at each other.
<P>
"You shall judge for yourself," Emily replied with a smile. "Mr.
Mirabel has been speaking to me of a relative who is very dear to
him--his sister."
<P>
Cecilia was surprised. "Why has he never spoken to _us_ of his
sister?" she asked.
<P>
"It's a sad subject to speak of, my dear. His sister lives a life
of suffering--she has been for years a prisoner in her room. He
writes to her constantly. His letters from Monksmoor have
interested her, poor soul. It seems he said something about
me--and she has sent a kind message, inviting me to visit her one
of these days. Do you understand it now, Cecilia?"
<P>
"Of course I do! Tell me--is Mr. Mirabel's sister older or
younger than he is?"
<P>
"Older."
<P>
"Is she married?"
<P>
"She is a widow."
<P>
"Does she live with her brother?" Alban asked.
<P>
"Oh, no! She has her own house--far away in Northumberland."
<P>
"Is she near Sir Jervis Redwood?"
<P>
"I fancy not. Her house is on the coast."
<P>
"Any children?" Cecilia inquired.
<P>
"No; she is quite alone. Now, Cecilia, I have told you all I
know--and I have something to say to Mr. Morris. No, you needn't
leave us; it's a subject in which you are interested. A subject,"
she repeated, turning to Alban, "which you may have noticed is
not very agreeable to me."
<P>
"Miss Jethro?" Alban guessed.
<P>
"Yes; Miss Jethro."
<P>
Cecilia's curiosity instantly asserted itself.
<P>
"_We_ have tried to get Mr. Mirabel to enlighten us, and tried in
vain," she said. "You are a favorite. Have you succeeded?"
<P>
"I have made no attempt to succeed," Emily replied. "My only
object is to relieve Mr. Mirabel's anxiety, if I can--with your
help, Mr. Morris."
<P>
"In what way can I help you?"
<P>
"You mustn't be angry."
<P>
"Do I look angry?"
<P>
"You look serious. It is a very simple thing. Mr. Mirabel is
afraid that Miss Jethro may have said something disagreeable
about him, which you might hesitate to repeat. Is he making
himself uneasy without any reason?"
<P>
"Without the slightest reason. I have concealed nothing from Mr.
Mirabel."
<P>
"Thank you for the explanation." She turned to Cecilia. "May I
send one of the servants with a message? I may as well put an end
to Mr. Mirabel's suspense."
<P>
The man was summoned, and was dispatched with the message. Emily
would have done well, after this, if she had abstained from
speaking further of Miss Jethro. But Mirabel's doubts had,
unhappily, inspired a similar feeling of uncertainty in her own
mind. She was now disposed to attribute the tone of mystery in
Alban's unlucky letter to some possible concealment suggested by
regard for herself. "I wonder whether _I_ have any reason to feel
uneasy?" she said--half in jest, half in earnest.
<P>
"Uneasy about what?" Alban inquired.
<P>
"About Miss Jethro, of course! Has she said anything of me which
your kindness has concealed?"
<P>
Alban seemed to be a little hurt by the doubt which her question
implied. "Was that your motive," he asked, "for answering my
letter as cautiously as if you had been writing to a stranger?"
<P>
"Indeed you are quite wrong!" Emily earnestly assured him. "I was
perplexed and startled--and I took Mr. Wyvil's advice, before I
wrote to you. Shall we drop the subject?"
<P>
Alban would have willingly dropped the subject--but for that
unfortunate allusion to Mr. Wyvil. Emily had unconsciously
touched him on a sore place. He had already heard from Cecilia of
the consultation over his letter, and had disapproved of it. "I
think you were wrong to trouble Mr. Wyvil," he said.
<P>
The altered tone of his voice suggested to Emily that he would
have spoken more severely, if Cecilia had not been in the room.
She thought him needlessly ready to complain of a harmless
proceeding--and she too returned to the subject, after having
proposed to drop it not a minute since!
<P>
"You didn't tell me I was to keep your letter a secret," she
replied.
<P>
Cecilia made matters worse--with the best intentions. "I'm sure,
Mr. Morris, my father was only too glad to give Emily his
advice."
<P>
Alban remained silent--ungraciously silent as Emily thought,
after Mr. Wyvil's kindness to him.
<P>
"The thing to regret," she remarked, "is that Mr. Morris allowed
Miss Jethro to leave him without explaining herself. In his
place, I should have insisted on knowing why she wanted to
prevent me from meeting Mr. Mirabel in this house."
<P>
Cecilia made another unlucky attempt at judicious interference.
This time, she tried a gentle remonstrance.
<P>
"Remember, Emily, how Mr. Morris was situated. He could hardly be
rude to a lady. And I daresay Miss Jethro had good reasons for
not wishing to explain herself."
<P>
Francine opened the drawing-room door and heard Cecilia's last
words.
<P>
"Miss Jethro again!" she exclaimed.
<P>
"Where is Mr. Mirabel?" Emily asked. "I sent him a message."
<P>
"He regrets to say he is otherwise engaged for the present,"
Francine replied with spiteful politeness. "Don't let me
interrupt the conversation. Who is this Miss Jethro, whose name
is on everybody's lips?"
<P>
Alban could keep silent no longer. "We have done with the
subject," he said sharply.
<P>
"Because I am here?"
<P>
"Because we have said more than enough about Miss Jethro
already."
<P>
"Speak for yourself, Mr. Morris," Emily answered, resenting the
masterful tone which Alban's interference had assumed. "I have
not done with Miss Jethro yet, I can assure you."
<P>
"My dear, you don't know where she lives," Cecilia reminded her.
<P>
"Leave me to discover i t!" Emily answered hotly. "Perhaps Mr.
Mirabel knows. I shall ask Mr. Mirabel."
<P>
"I thought you would find a reason for returning to Mr. Mirabel,"
Francine remarked.
<P>
Before Emily could reply, one of the maids entered the room with
a wreath of roses in her hand.
<P>
"Mr. Mirabel sends you these flowers, miss," the woman said,
addressing Emily. "The boy told me they were to be taken to your
room. I thought it was a mistake, and I have brought them to you
here."
<P>
Francine, who happened to be nearest to the door, took the roses
from the girl on pretense of handing them to Emily. Her jealous
vigilance detected the one visible morsel of Mirabel's letter,
twisted up with the flowers. Had Emily entrapped him into a
secret correspondence with her? "A scrap of waste paper among
your roses," she said, crumpling it up in her hand as if she
meant to throw it away.
<P>
But Emily was too quick for her. She caught Francine by the
wrist. "Waste paper or not," she said; "it was among my flowers
and it belongs to me."
<P>
Francine gave up the letter, with a look which might have
startled Emily if she had noticed it. She handed the roses to
Cecilia. "I was making a wreath for you to wear this evening, my
dear--and I left it in the garden. It's not quite finished yet."
<P>
Cecilia was delighted. "How lovely it is!" she exclaimed. "And
how very kind of you! I'll finish it myself." She turned away to
the conservatory.
<P>
"I had no idea I was interfering with a letter," said Francine;
watching Emily with fiercely-attentive eyes, while she smoothed
out the crumpled paper.
<P>
Having read what Mirabel had written to her, Emily looked up, and
saw that Alban was on the point of following Cecilia into the
conservatory. He had noticed something in Francine's face which
he was at a loss to understand, but which made her presence in
the room absolutely hateful to him. Emily followed and spoke to
him.
<P>
"I am going back to the rose garden," she said.
<P>
"For any particular purpose?" Alban inquired
<P>
"For a purpose which, I am afraid, you won't approve of. I mean
to ask Mr. Mirabel if he knows Miss Jethro's address."
<P>
"I hope he is as ignorant of it as I am," Alban answered gravely.
<P>
"Are we going to quarrel over Miss Jethro, as we once quarreled
over Mrs. Rook?" Emily asked--with the readiest recovery of her
good humor. "Come! come! I am sure you are as anxious, in your
own private mind, to have this matter cleared up as I am."
<P>
"With one difference--that I think of consequences, and you
don't." He said it, in his gentlest and kindest manner, and
stepped into the conservatory.
<P>
"Never mind the consequences," she called after him, "if we can
only get at the truth. I hate being deceived!"
<P>
"There is no person living who has better reason than you have to
say that."
<P>
Emily looked round with a start. Alban was out of hearing. It was
Francine who had answered her.
<P>
"What do you mean?" she said.
<P>
Francine hesitated. A ghastly paleness overspread her face.
<P>
"Are you ill?" Emily asked.
<P>
"No--I am thinking."
<P>
After waiting for a moment in silence, Emily moved away toward
the door of the drawing-room. Francine suddenly held up her hand.
<P>
"Stop!" she cried.
<P>
Emily stood still.
<P>
"My mind is made up," Francine said.
<P>
"Made up--to what?"
<P>
"You asked what I meant, just now."
<P>
"I did."
<P>
"Well, my mind is made up to answer you. Miss Emily Brown, you
are leading a sadly frivolous life in this house. I am going to
give you something more serious to think about than your
flirtation with Mr. Mirabel. Oh, don't be impatient! I am coming
to the point. Without knowing it yourself, you have been the
victim of deception for years past--cruel deception--wicked
deception that puts on the mask of mercy."
<P>
"Are you alluding to Miss Jethro?" Emily asked, in astonishment.
"I thought you were strangers to each other. Just now, you wanted
to know who she was."
<P>
"I know nothing about her. I care nothing about her. I am not
thinking of Miss Jethro."
<P>
"Who are you thinking of?"
<P>
"I am thinking," Francine answered, "of your dead father."
