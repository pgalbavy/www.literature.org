<p>An instant later, with a roar of fury, as he realized the trick that had
been played upon him, Bas was beating his fists against the panels and
hurling against them the weight of his powerful shoulders. But those hot
moments of agitation and mental riot had left him breathless, too, and
presently he drew away for a quieter survey of the situation. He
strolled insolently over to the window which was still open and leaned
with his elbows on the sill looking in. The room was empty, and he
guessed that Dorothy had hurried out to bar the back door, forgetting,
in her excitement, the nearer danger of the raised sash.
</p>
<p>Bas had started to draw himself up over the sill when caution prompted
him to turn first for a look at the road.
</p><p>He ground his teeth and abandoned his intention of immediate entry for
there swinging around the turn, with her buxom vigour of stride, came
Elviry Prooner.
</p><p>Rowlett scowled as he folded his arms and leaned by the window, and then
he saw Dorothy appear in the back door of the room and he cautioned her
in a low voice: "Elviry's comin' back. I warns ye not ter make no
commotion."
</p><p>But to his astonishment Dorothy, whose face was as pale as paper no
longer, wore in her eyes the desperation of terror or the fluttering
agitation that seemed likely to make outcry. In her hand she held a
kitchen knife which had been sharpened and re-sharpened on the
grindstone until its point was as taperingly keen as that of a dirk.
</p><p>She laid this weapon down on the table and hastily rearranged her
dishevelled hair, and then she said in a still and ominous voice, more
indicative of aggressive temerity than shrinking timidity:
</p><p>"Don't go yit, Bas, I'm comin' out thar ter hev speech with ye--an' ef
ye fails ter hearken ter me--God knows I pities ye!"
</p><p>Waiting a little while to recover from the pallid advertising of her
recent agitation she opened the front door and went firmly out as
Elviry, with a toss of her head that ignored the visitor, passed around
the house to the rear.
</p><p>Dorothy's right hand, armed with the blade, rested inconspicuously under
her apron, but the glitter in her eyes was unconcealed and to Bas, who
smiled indulgently at her arming, she gave the brief command, "Come out
hyar under ther tree whar Elviry won't hear us."
</p><p>Curious and somewhat mystified at the transformation from helplessness
to aggression of bearing the man followed her and as she wheeled to face
him with her left hand groping against the bark, he dropped down into
the grass with insolent mockery in his face and sat cross-legged,
looking up at her.
</p><p>"Ef I'd hed this knife a minute ago," she began in a low voice,
throbbing like a muffled engine, "I'd hev cut yore heart out. Now I've
decided not ter do hit--jest yit."
</p><p>"Would ye ruther wait an' let ther man with siv'ral diff'rent names
ondertake hit fer ye?" he queried, mockingly, and Dorothy Thornton shook
her head.
</p><p>"No, I wouldn't hev him dirty his hands with no sich job," she answered
with icy disdain. "Albeit he'd t'ar hit out with his bare fingers, I
reckon--ef he knowed."
</p><p>Bas Rowlett's swarthy face stiffened and his teeth bared themselves in
a snarl of hurt vanity, but as he started to speak he changed his mind
and sat for a while silent, watching the splendid figure she made as she
leaned against the tree with a breast rising and falling to the storm
tide of her indignation.
</p><p>Rowlett's thoughts had been active in these minutes since the craters of
his sensuous nature had burst into eruption, and already he was cursing
himself for a fool who had prematurely revealed his hand.
</p><p>"Dorothy," he began, slowly, and a self-abasing pretence of penitence
sounded through his words, "my reason plum left me a while ago an' I was
p'int blank crazed fer a spell. I've got ter crave yore pardon right
humbly--but I reckon ye don't begin ter know how much I loves ye."
</p><p>"How much ye loves me!" She echoed the words with a scorn so
incandescent that he winced. "Love's an honest thing, an' ye hain't
nuver knowed ther meanin' of honesty!"
</p><p>"Ye've got a right good license ter git mad with me, Dorothy," he made
generous concession, "an' I wouldn't esteem ye ef ye hedn't done
hit--but afore ye lets thet wrath settle inter a fixed hate ye ought ter
think of somethin' ye've done fergot."
</p><p>He paused but received no invitation to present his plea in extenuation,
so he proceeded without it:
</p><p>"I kissed ye erginst yore will, an' I cussed an' damned yore husband,
but I did both them things in sudden heat an' passion. Ye ought ter take
thought afore ye disgusts me too everlastin'ly much thet I've done loved
ye ever since we was both kids tergither. I've done been compelled ter
put behind me all ther hopes I ever hed endurin' my whole lifetime an'
hit's been makin' a hell of tormint outen my days an' nights hyar of
late."
</p><p>He had risen now, and into his argument as he bowed a bared and
allegedly stricken head he was managing to put an excellent semblance of
sincerity.
</p><p>But it was before a court of feminine intuition that Bas Rowlett stood
arraigned, and his specious contriteness fell flat as it came from his
lips. Dorothy was looking at him now in the glare of revelation--and
seeing a loathsome portrait.
</p><p>"An hour ago," she declared with no relenting in the deep blaze of her
eyes, "I believed all good of ye. Now I sees ye fer what ye air an' I
suspicions iniquities thet I hedn't nuver dreamp' of afore. I wouldn't
put hit past ye ter hev deevised Cal's lay-wayin' yoreself. I wouldn't
be none astonished ef ye hired ther man thet shot him ... an' yit I'd
nigh cut my tongue afore I'd drap a hint of thet ter him."
</p><p>That last statement both amazed and gratified the intriguer. He had now
two avowed enemies in this house and each stood pledged to a solitary
reckoning. His warfare against one of them was prompted by murder-lust
and against the other by love-lust, but the cardinal essence of good
strategy is to dispose of hostile forces in detail and to prevent their
uniting for defence or offence. It seemed to Bas that, in this, the
woman was preparing to play into his hands, but he inquired, without
visible eagerness:
</p><p>"Fer why does ye say thet?"
</p><p>Out of Dorothy's wide eyes was blazing upon him torrential fury and
contempt. Yet she did not give him her truest reasons in her answer. She
had no longer any fear of him for herself, but she trembled inwardly at
the menace of his treachery against her man.
</p><p>"I says hit," she answered, still in that level, ominously pitched voice
that spoke from a heart too profoundly outraged for gusty vehemence,
"because, now thet I knows ye, I don't need nobody ter fight ye fer me.
He trusts ye an' thinks ye're his friend, an' so long es ye don't lift
no finger ter harm him I'm willin' ter let him go on trustin' ye." She
paused, and to her ears with a soothing whisper came the rustle of the
crisp leaves overhead. Then she resumed, "Ef he ever got any hint of
what's come ter pass terday, I mout es well try ter hold back a
flood-tide with a splash-dam es ter hinder him from follerin' atter ye
an' trompin' ye in ther dirt like he'd tromple a rattlesnake.... But he
stands pledged ter peace an' I don't aim ter bring on no feud war ergin
by hevin' him break hit."
</p><p>"Ef him an' me fell out," admitted Bas with wily encouragement of her
confessed belief, "right like others would mix inter hit."
</p><p>"But ef _I_ kills ye hit won't start no war," she retorted. "A woman's
got a right ter defend herself, even hyar."
</p><p>"Dorothy, I've done told ye I jest lost my head in a swivet of wrath.
Ye're jedgin' me by one minute of frenzy and lookin' over a lifetime of
trustiness."
</p><p>"Ef I kills ye hit won't start no war," she reiterated, implacably,
ignoring his interruption, "an' betwixt ther two of us, I'm ther best
man--because I'm honest, an' ye're as craven as Judas was when he earned
his silver money. Ye needn't hev no fear of my tellin' Cal, but ye've
got a right good cause ter fear <u>me</u>!"
</p><p>"All right, then," once more the hypocritical mask of dissimulation fell
away and the swarthy face showed black with the savagery of frustration.
"Ef ye won't hev hit no other way, go on disgustin' me--but I warns ye
thet ye kain't hold out erginst me. Ther time'll come when ye won't kick
an' fly inter tantrums erginst my kisses ... ye'll plum welcome 'em."
</p><p>"Hit won't be in this world," she declared, fiercely, as her eyes
narrowed and the hand that held the knife crept out from under the
apron.
</p><p>The man laughed again.
</p><p>"Hit'll be right hyar on y'arth," he declared with undiminished
self-assurance; "you an' me air meant ter mate tergither like a pair of
eagles, an' some day ye're goin' ter come inter my arms of yore own free
will. I reckon I kin bide my time twell ye does."
</p><p>"Eagles don't mate with snakes," she shot out at him, with a bosom
heaving to the tempest of her disgust. Then she added: "I don't even
caution ye ter stay away from this house. I hain't afeared of ye, an' I
don't want Cal ter suspicion nothin'--but don't come hyar too often ...
ye fouls ther air I breathes whenever ye enters hit."
</p><p>She paused and brushed her free arm across her lips in shuddering
remembrance of his kiss, then she continued with the tone of finality:
</p><p>"Now I've told ye what I wanted ter tell ye ... ef need arises ergin,
I'm goin' ter kill ye ... this matter lays betwixt me an' you ... an'
nobody else hain't agoin' ter be brung inter hit.... Does ye onderstand
thet full clear?"
</p><p>"Thet's agreed," he gave answer, but his voice trembled with passion,
"an' I've done told <u>you</u> what I wants ye ter know. I loves ye an' I'm
goin' ter hev ye. I don't keer no master amount how hit comes ter pass,
but sooner or later I gits me what I goes atter--an' from now on I'm
goin' atter <u>you</u>."
</p><p>He turned and walked insolently away and the girl, with the strain of
necessity removed, sank back weakly against the cool solidity of the
walnut trunk. Except for its support she would have fallen, and after
awhile, hearing Elviry's voice singing off at the back of the house and
realizing that she was not watched, she turned weakly and spread her
outstretched hands upward in embrace against the rough wood, as a
frightened child might throw its arms about a protecting mother.
</p><p>When Sam Opdyke had been taken from the courtroom to the "jail-house"
that his wrath might cool into submissiveness, and when later he had
been held to the grand jury, he knew in his heart that ahead of him lay
the prospect of leaving the mountains. The hated lowlands meant to him
the penitentiary at Frankfort, and with Jim Rowlett and Parish Thornton
united against him, this was his sure prospect.
</p><p>The two men who had shared with him the sensational notability of that
entrance and the deflated drama of that exit had gone home rankling
under a chagrin not wholly concerned with the interests of the
defendant.
</p><p>Enmities were planted that day that carried the infection of bitterness
toward Harpers and Doanes alike, and the resentful minority began taking
thought of new organization; a thought secretly fanned and inflamed by
emissaries of the resourceful Bas Rowlett.
</p><p>Back in the days following on the War of Secession the word Ku Klux had
carried a meaning of both terror and authority. It had functioned in the
mountains as well as elsewhere through the South, but it had been, in
its beginnings, a secret body of regulators filling a void left by the
law's failure, and one boasting some colour of legitimacy.
</p><p>Since then occasional organizations of imitative origin had risen for a
time and fallen rapidly into decay, but these were all gangs of
predatory activity and outrage.
</p><p>Now once more in the talk of wayside store and highroad meeting one
began to hear that name "Ku Klux" though it came vaguely from the tongue
as a thing of which no man had seen any tangible evidence. If it had
anywhere an actual nucleus, that centre remained as impalpable and
unmaterial as fox-fire.
</p><p>But the rumour of night meetings and oath-bound secrecy persisted, and
some of these shreds of gossip came to Dorothy Thornton over the
dooryard fence as passersby drew rein in the shadow of the black walnut.
Nearer anxieties just now made her mind unreceptive to loose and
improbable stories of that nature, and she gave them scant attention.
</p><p>She found herself coming out to stand under the tree often, because it
seemed to her that here she could feel the presence of the man who had
gone away on a parlous mission--and it was during that time of his
absence that she found more to fear in a seemingly trivial matter than
in the disquieting talk of a mysterious body of avengers stirring into
life.
</p><p>When she looked up into the branches that were colouring toward autumnal
hues she discovered here and there a small, fungus-like growth and
leaves that were dying unnaturally, as though through the agency of some
blight that diseased the vigour of the tree.
</p><p>Her heart was ready to be frightened by small things, and through her
thoughts ran that old prophecy:
</p><p>"I have ye strong faithe that whilst that tree stands and grows stronge
and weathers ye thunder and wind and is revered, ye stem and branches of
our family alsoe will waxe stronge and robust, but that when it fails,
likewise will disaster fall upon our house."
