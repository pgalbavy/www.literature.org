<P>As the fair Rosa, with foreboding doubt, had foretold, so it 
happened. Whilst John de Witt was climbing the narrow 
winding stairs which led to the prison of his brother 
Cornelius, the burghers did their best to have the troop of 
Tilly, which was in their way, removed.</P>
<P>Seeing this disposition, King Mob, who fully appreciated the 
laudable intentions of his own beloved militia, shouted most 
lustily,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Hurrah for the burghers!&quot;</P>
<P>As to Count Tilly, who was as prudent as he was firm, he 
began to parley with the burghers, under the protection of 
the cocked pistols of his dragoons, explaining to the 
valiant townsmen, that his order from the States commanded 
him to guard the prison and its approaches with three 
companies.</P>
<P>&quot;Wherefore such an order? Why guard the prison?&quot; cried the 
Orangists.</P>
<P>&quot;Stop,&quot; replied the Count, &quot;there you at once ask me more 
than I can tell you. I was told, 'Guard the prison,' and I 
guard it. You, gentlemen, who are almost military men 
yourselves, you are aware that an order must never be 
gainsaid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But this order has been given to you that the traitors may 
be enabled to leave the town.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very possibly, as the traitors are condemned to exile,&quot; 
replied Tilly.</P>
<P>&quot;But who has given this order?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The States, to be sure!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The States are traitors.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know anything about that!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you are a traitor yourself!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, as to that, let us understand each other gentlemen. 
Whom should I betray? The States? Why, I cannot betray them, 
whilst, being in their pay, I faithfully obey their orders.&quot;</P>
<P>As the Count was so indisputably in the right that it was 
impossible to argue against him, the mob answered only by 
redoubled clamour and horrible threats, to which the Count 
opposed the most perfect urbanity.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;uncock your muskets, one of them may 
go off by accident; and if the shot chanced to wound one of 
my men, we should knock over a couple of hundreds of yours, 
for which we should, indeed, be very sorry, but you even 
more so; especially as such a thing is neither contemplated 
by you nor by myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you did that,&quot; cried the burghers, &quot;we should have a pop 
at you, too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course you would; but suppose you killed every man Jack 
of us, those whom we should have killed would not, for all 
that, be less dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then leave the place to us, and you will perform the part 
of a good citizen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;First of all,&quot; said the Count, &quot;I am not a citizen, but an 
officer, which is a very different thing; and secondly, I am 
not a Hollander, but a Frenchman, which is more different 
still. I have to do with no one but the States, by whom I am 
paid; let me see an order from them to leave the place to 
you, and I shall only be too glad to wheel off in an 
instant, as I am confoundedly bored here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; cried a hundred voices; the din of which was 
immediately swelled by five hundred others; &quot;let us march to 
the Town-hall; let us go and see the deputies! Come along! 
come along!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's it,&quot; Tilly muttered between his teeth, as he saw the 
most violent among the crowd turning away; &quot;go and ask for a 
meanness at the Town-hall, and you will see whether they 
will grant it; go, my fine fellows, go!&quot;</P>
<P>The worthy officer relied on the honour of the magistrates, 
who, on their side, relied on his honour as a soldier.</P>
<P>&quot;I say, Captain,&quot; the first lieutenant whispered into the 
ear of the Count, &quot;I hope the deputies will give these 
madmen a flat refusal; but, after all, it would do no harm 
if they would send us some reinforcement.&quot;</P>
<P>In the meanwhile, John de Witt, whom we left climbing the 
stairs, after the conversation with the jailer Gryphus and 
his daughter Rosa, had reached the door of the cell, where 
on a mattress his brother Cornelius was resting, after 
having undergone the preparatory degrees of the torture. The 
sentence of banishment having been pronounced, there was no 
occasion for inflicting the torture extraordinary.</P>
<P>Cornelius was stretched on his couch, with broken wrists and 
crushed fingers. He had not confessed a crime of which he 
was not guilty; and now, after three days of agony, he once 
more breathed freely, on being informed that the judges, 
from whom he had expected death, were only condemning him to 
exile.</P>
<P>Endowed with an iron frame and a stout heart, how would he 
have disappointed his enemies if they could only have seen, 
in the dark cell of the Buytenhof, his pale face lit up by 
the smile of the martyr, who forgets the dross of this earth 
after having obtained a glimpse of the bright glory of 
heaven.</P>
<P>The warden, indeed, had already recovered his full strength, 
much more owing to the force of his own strong will than to 
actual aid; and he was calculating how long the formalities 
of the law would still detain him in prison.</P>
<P>This was just at the very moment when the mingled shouts of 
the burgher guard and of the mob were raging against the two 
brothers, and threatening Captain Tilly, who served as a 
rampart to them. This noise, which roared outside of the 
walls of the prison, as the surf dashing against the rocks, 
now reached the ears of the prisoner.</P>
<P>But, threatening as it sounded, Cornelius appeared not to 
dream it worth his while to inquire after its cause; nor did 
he get up to look out of the narrow grated window, which 
gave access to the light and to the noise of the world 
without.</P>
<P>He was so absorbed in his never-ceasing pain that it had 
almost become a habit with him. He felt with such delight 
the bonds which connected his immortal being with his 
perishable frame gradually loosening, that it seemed to him 
as if his spirit, freed from the trammels of the body, were 
hovering above it, like the expiring flame which rises from 
the half-extinguished embers.</P>
<P>He also thought of his brother; and whilst the latter was 
thus vividly present to his mind the door opened, and John 
entered, hurrying to the bedside of the prisoner, who 
stretched out his broken limbs and his hands tied up in 
bandages towards that glorious brother, whom he now 
excelled, not in services rendered to the country, but in 
the hatred which the Dutch bore him.</P>
<P>John tenderly kissed his brother on the forehead, and put 
his sore hands gently back on the mattress.</P>
<P>&quot;Cornelius, my poor brother, you are suffering great pain, 
are you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am suffering no longer, since I see you, my brother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, my poor dear Cornelius! I feel most wretched to see you 
in such a state.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And, indeed, I have thought more of you than of myself; and 
whilst they were torturing me, I never thought of uttering a 
complaint, except once, to say, 'Poor brother!' But now that 
you are here, let us forget all. You are coming to take me 
away, are you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am quite healed; help me to get up, and you shall see how 
I can walk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will not have to walk far, as I have my coach near the 
pond, behind Tilly's dragoons.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tilly's dragoons! What are they near the pond for?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said the Grand Pensionary with a melancholy smile 
which was habitual to him, &quot;the gentlemen at the Town-hall 
expect that the people at the Hague would like to see you 
depart, and there is some apprehension of a tumult.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of a tumult?&quot; replied Cornelius, fixing his eyes on his 
perplexed brother; &quot;a tumult?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Cornelius.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! that's what I heard just now,&quot; said the prisoner, as if 
speaking to himself. Then, turning to his brother, he 
continued,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Are there many persons down before the prison.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my brother, there are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But then, to come here to me  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How is it that they have allowed you to pass?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know well that we are not very popular, Cornelius,&quot; 
said the Grand Pensionary, with gloomy bitterness. &quot;I have 
made my way through all sorts of bystreets and alleys.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You hid yourself, John?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wished to reach you without loss of time, and I did what 
people will do in politics, or on the sea when the wind is 
against them,  -  I tacked.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment the noise in the square below was heard to 
roar with increasing fury. Tilly was parleying with the 
burghers.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;you are a very skilful pilot, 
John; but I doubt whether you will as safely guide your 
brother out of the Buytenhof in the midst of this gale, and 
through the raging surf of popular hatred, as you did the 
fleet of Van Tromp past the shoals of the Scheldt to 
Antwerp.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;With the help of God, Cornelius, we'll at least try,&quot; 
answered John; &quot;but, first of all, a word with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak!&quot;</P>
<P>The shouts began anew.</P>
<P>&quot;Hark, hark!&quot; continued Cornelius, &quot;how angry those people 
are! Is it against you, or against me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should say it is against us both, Cornelius. I told you, 
my dear brother, that the Orange party, while assailing us 
with their absurd calumnies, have also made it a reproach 
against us that we have negotiated with France.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What blockheads they are!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, indeed, they reproach us with it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet, if these negotiations had been successful, they 
would have prevented the defeats of Rees, Orsay, Wesel, and 
Rheinberg; the Rhine would not have been crossed, and 
Holland might still consider herself invincible in the midst 
of her marshes and canals.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All this is quite true, my dear Cornelius, but still more 
certain it is, that if at this moment our correspondence 
with the Marquis de Louvois were discovered, skilful pilot 
as I am, I should not be able to save the frail barque which 
is to carry the brothers De Witt and their fortunes out of 
Holland. That correspondence, which might prove to honest 
people how dearly I love my country, and what sacrifices I 
have offered to make for its liberty and glory, would be 
ruin to us if it fell into the hands of the Orange party. I 
hope you have burned the letters before you left Dort to 
join me at the Hague.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear brother,&quot; Cornelius answered, &quot;your correspondence 
with M. de Louvois affords ample proof of your having been 
of late the greatest, most generous, and most able citizen 
of the Seven United Provinces. I rejoice in the glory of my 
country; and particularly do I rejoice in your glory, John. 
I have taken good care not to burn that correspondence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then we are lost, as far as this life is concerned,&quot; 
quietly said the Grand Pensionary, approaching the window.</P>
<P>&quot;No, on the contrary, John, we shall at the same time save 
our lives and regain our popularity.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what have you done with these letters?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have intrusted them to the care of Cornelius van Baerle, 
my godson, whom you know, and who lives at Dort.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Poor honest Van Baerle! who knows so much, and yet thinks 
of nothing but of flowers and of God who made them. You have 
intrusted him with this fatal secret; it will be his ruin, 
poor soul!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His ruin?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, for he will either be strong or he will be weak. If he 
is strong, he will, when he hears of what has happened to 
us, boast of our acquaintance; if he is weak, he will be 
afraid on account of his connection with us: if he is 
strong, he will betray the secret by his boldness; if he is 
weak, he will allow it to be forced from him. In either case 
he is lost, and so are we. Let us, therefore, fly, fly, as 
long as there is still time.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius de Witt, raising himself on his couch, and 
grasping the hand of his brother, who shuddered at the touch 
of his linen bandages, replied,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Do not I know my godson? have not I been enabled to read 
every thought in Van Baerle's mind, and every sentiment in 
his heart? You ask whether he is strong or weak. He is 
neither the one nor the other; but that is not now the 
question. The principal point is, that he is sure not to 
divulge the secret, for the very good reason that he does 
not know it himself.&quot;</P>
<P>John turned round in surprise.</P>
<P>&quot;You must know, my dear brother, that I have been trained in 
the school of that distinguished politician John de Witt; 
and I repeat to you, that Van Baerle is not aware of the 
nature and importance of the deposit which I have intrusted 
to him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quick then,&quot; cried John, &quot;as there is still time, let us 
convey to him directions to burn the parcel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Through whom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Through my servant Craeke, who was to have accompanied us 
on horseback, and who has entered the prison with me, to 
assist you downstairs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Consider well before having those precious documents burnt, 
John!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I consider, above all things, that the brothers De Witt 
must necessarily save their lives, to be able to save their 
character. If we are dead, who will defend us? Who will have 
fully understood our intentions?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You expect, then, that they would kill us if those papers 
were found?&quot;</P>
<P>John, without answering, pointed with his hand to the 
square, whence, at that very moment, fierce shouts and 
savage yells made themselves heard.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Cornelius, &quot;I hear these shouts very 
plainly, but what is their meaning?&quot;</P>
<P>John opened the window.</P>
<P>&quot;Death to the traitors!&quot; howled the populace.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you hear now, Cornelius?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To the traitors! that means us!&quot; said the prisoner, raising 
his eyes to heaven and shrugging his shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, it means us,&quot; repeated John.</P>
<P>&quot;Where is Craeke?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At the door of your cell, I suppose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let him enter then.&quot;</P>
<P>John opened the door; the faithful servant was waiting on 
the threshold.</P>
<P>&quot;Come in, Craeke, and mind well what my brother will tell 
you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, John; it will not suffice to send a verbal message; 
unfortunately, I shall be obliged to write.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And why that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because Van Baerle will neither give up the parcel nor burn 
it without a special command to do so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But will you be able to write, poor old fellow?&quot; John 
asked, with a look on the scorched and bruised hands of the 
unfortunate sufferer.</P>
<P>&quot;If I had pen and ink you would soon see,&quot; said Cornelius.</P>
<P>&quot;Here is a pencil, at any rate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you any paper? for they have left me nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here, take this Bible, and tear out the fly-leaf.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, that will do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But your writing will be illegible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just leave me alone for that,&quot; said Cornelius. &quot;The 
executioners have indeed pinched me badly enough, but my 
hand will not tremble once in tracing the few lines which 
are requisite.&quot;</P>
<P>And really Cornelius took the pencil and began to write, 
when through the white linen bandages drops of blood oozed 
out which the pressure of the fingers against the pencil 
squeezed from the raw flesh.</P>
<P>A cold sweat stood on the brow of the Grand Pensionary.</P>
<P>Cornelius wrote:  - </P>
<P>&quot;My dear Godson,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you. Burn it 
without looking at it, and without opening it, so that its 
contents may for ever remain unknown to yourself. Secrets of 
this description are death to those with whom they are 
deposited. Burn it, and you will have saved John and 
Cornelius de Witt.</P>
<P>&quot;Farewell, and love me.</P>
<P>&quot;Cornelius de Witt</P>
<P>&quot;August 20th, 1672.&quot;</P>
<P>John, with tears in his eyes, wiped off a drop of the noble 
blood which had soiled the leaf, and, after having handed 
the despatch to Craeke with a last direction, returned to 
Cornelius, who seemed overcome by intense pain, and near 
fainting.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;when honest Craeke sounds his coxswain's 
whistle, it will be a signal of his being clear of the 
crowd, and of his having reached the other side of the pond. 
And then it will be our turn to depart.&quot;</P>
<P>Five minutes had not elapsed, before a long and shrill 
whistle was heard through the din and noise of the square of 
the Buytenhof.</P>
<P>John gratefully raised his eyes to heaven.</P>
<P>&quot;And now,&quot; said he, &quot;let us off, Cornelius.&quot; </P></article>
