<p>Oftener than we suppose does heaven interfere directly in the
affairs of men. Minutes had passed since Sanders and Storms had
agreed that no earthly occurrence could avert a fight with the
dusky demons, with scarcely a grain of hope for escape from them,
when Inez uttered the astounding exclamation:</p>

<p>"We are gaining on them!"</p>

<p>It was inconceivable, and the two looked again to the rear to
learn the cause of her unaccountable delusion. Five minutes later
Sanders added in a husky gasp:</p>

<p>"She is right; we are not only gaining, but we are gaining fast."</p>

<p>"How do you account for it?"</p>

<p>"I can't account for it."</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the amazed youth.</p>

<p>"God interposes many times when mortals do not see it," said
the New Englander reverently; "there is joy in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth. You have repented, and He has extended
his hand to help you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," replied Sanders, much impressed.</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> I am right."</p>

<p>"And I hope to prove worthy of such undeserved kindness. All
I ask is the opportunity."</p>

<p>"It shall be granted you. But, humanly speaking, there has been
some accident on board that craft yonder."</p>

<p>"It must be that; as a sailor, you know any one of a half dozen
things would be sufficient to throw them out of the race. A ripping
of the sail, a fracture of the mast, the breaking of the steering
gear, or some sudden quarrel would do the trick. Sufficient for
us is it to know that it has been done."</p>

<p>"God helps them that helps themselves," added Storms, "and we
must improve to the utmost the chance thrown in our way."</p>

<p>Naturally the fear of the two was that their pursuers might repair
the accident which was throwing them to the rear for the time,
and regain what was lost. They steadily fell behind, and, as soon
as invisible, the proa made an abrupt change in her course, with
the view of defeating the calamity that they feared threatened
them. When this had lasted for an hour, another change was effected,
with the result, as Sanders announced, that they were now heading
directly for Wauparmur.</p>

<p>The eyes peering backward through the vivid moonlight failed
to bring the dreaded craft to view, and it was not yet midnight
when Sanders announced the thrilling fact that the twinkling lights,
which appeared in front like a constellation in the horizon, were
made by the dwellings in the native South Sea town of Wauparmur.
All danger was past, and about an hour later the proa glided in
among the shipping in that excellent harbor, made fast to the
wharf, and the three disembarked.</p>

<p>Fred led the way to a house of entertainment near the harbor,
in which he found good lodging for his friends.</p>

<p>Abram Storms carried all the precious pearls to his room and
carefully secured the door, after which he threw himself upon
the bed and slept as soundly as an infant.</p>

<p>Inez Hawthorne, in the solitude of her apartment, devoutly thanked
her Heavenly Father for His care, and then she, too, slept the
sleep of exhaustion and perfect health.</p>

<p>It was near noon on the succeeding day when both rose and found
Fred Sanders awaiting them. The young man had not slept at all,
and was uneasy.</p>

<p>"It won't do to stay here another night," said he, in explanation,
as soon as the meal was concluded.</p>

<p>"I am sure we have no wish to do so," replied Storms. "But wherein
lies the particular peril?"</p>

<p>"That whole crew of the double canoe are scattered through town,
and they only await the chance to kill us. They will find the
chance, too, to-night, if we remain here."</p>

<p>"But what is the prospect of getting away?"</p>

<p>"I was in despair nearly all the forenoon; but a little while
ago I came upon a schooner which sails for San Francisco at three
o'clock this afternoon. I have engaged passage on it for us three,
for you know I go with you."</p>

<p>"How can we ever repay you for your kindness?" said Inez, her
lustrous eyes speaking eloquently her gratitude to the youth.</p>

<p>"There's no service on earth that I can render you which will
compare with what you have done for me," was the reply of Captain
Fred, whose manner showed his sincerity. Inez Hawthorne did not
understand what all this meant, but the speaker ventured upon
no explanation at the time.</p>

<p>As the three were about to start upon a long voyage, it was decided
that some indispensable articles should be procured, and, since
they had little spare time at command, the three set out immediately
after dinner.</p>

<p>Wauparmur, as we have already intimated, is a town numbering
several hundreds&mdash;perhaps more than a thousand&mdash;in population.
Among these are a number of foreign shopkeepers, whose places
are close along shore, so as to be the more readily accessible
to their customers, who are almost exclusively confined to those
on board the vessels which stop at the island.</p>

<p>Back from the town the land rises into hills, and the settlement
becomes straggling and scattered. In these portions it is composed
entirely of rude huts and cabins, in which none but natives live,
and they are a bad lot.</p>

<p>It was from among those who lived in the "suburbs" that the wretches
were gathered with which to attempt to capture and murder the
little party of Europeans for the sake of the invaluable pearls
they had in their possession.</p>

<p>Fred Sanders shuddered when he thought of the risk he and his
friends ran by going straight to the inn and taking quarters for
the night, for these miscreants must, after all, have reached
Wauparmur only a few hours after the proa, and the wonder was
that they did not manage to slay the fugitives in their beds.</p>

<p>The first thing Fred did in the morning was to slip out and buy
a revolver, and his second act was to load it.</p>

<p>While engaged in hunting a vessel upon which to take passage,
he encountered his own acquaintances continually, and he needed
not their black faces and scowling eyes to tell how they thirsted
to kill him for his treachery. It was only by his bold front and
constant watchfulness that he kept the dusky demons at a distance.
Some of them were seen when the three ventured out, and though
the pirates dared not attack them in open daylight, they were
on the verge of doing so more than once. But their fury was directed
principally against Captain Fred Sanders, and there can be no
doubt the youth spoke the truth when he declared that if he attempted
to stay on land until morning, he would not live till midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. Storms laid in a good supply of clothing, shoes and knick-knacks
for himself and Inez, and with as little delay as possible. When
they reached the wharf and approached the plank leading to the
deck of the schooner, Mr. Storms noticed a small man standing
a few feet off, with a blanket drawn up about his shoulders and
neck like an Indian. His legs, feet and head were bare, but a
huge bandage was bound around his forehead, giving him a grotesque
appearance.</p>

<p>His position was like a statue, and he held the blanket so high
that little could be seen except his black, glittering eyes. Some
distance off, on the street close to the shop-houses, was a group
of other natives, who looked as if they were expecting some important
event.</p>

<p>So they were, indeed!</p>
