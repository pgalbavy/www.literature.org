<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The full moon was shining on the second night succeeding the
conflict which Budd Hankinson described between the rustlers and
the cowmen of Whitney's ranch. The man that had fallen was laid
away in a grave back of the house, and mother, son and daughter
mourned him with a sorrow that was soothed by the consciousness
that he had been a good husband and father in every sense of the
word.</p>

<p>On this night, before the hour was late, three persons were seated
in the balmy air on the outside of the dwelling, talking together
in low tones.</p>

<p>They were Fred Whitney, whose bandaged arm rested in a sling,
Monteith Sterry, and Jennie Whitney. The memory of the recent
affliction suffered in the death of the father naturally subdued
the voices and tinged the words with a seriousness that would
not have been felt at other times.</p>

<p>Young Sterry, as already stated, had accepted an engagement with
the Live Stock Association, which required him to investigate
the operations of the rustlers over a large portion of Wyoming
and Montana, and to report at regular intervals to his superior
officers.</p>

<p>This was perilous business, but Sterry set about the work with
a vigour, directness and intelligence that were felt over an extent
of territory numbering hundreds of square miles, and made him
a marked man by the rustlers, who are always quick to identify
their friends and enemies. It seemed to make little difference,
however, to him, who loved the excitement. He was a capital pistol
and rifle-shot, a fine horseman, and as devoid of fear as the
men against whom he directed his movements.</p>

<p>Unconsciously Monteith Sterry brought a grievous peril upon his
friends, who held him in so high regard. Hated intensely by the
rustlers, they were not long in learning that he spent a great
deal of his time at the Whitneys. They came to be regarded, therefore,
as aiders and abettors of his. This enmity was emphasized by the
attack of which an account has been given.</p>

<p>"I think, Fred," said his sister, oppressed by the shadow that
had fallen across the threshold, "we ought to sell out and leave
this country."</p>

<p>"Why?" he gently asked.</p>

<p>"Because not only of what happened yesterday, but of the certainty
that such attacks will be repeated."</p>

<p>"What reason have you to fear their repetition?" asked Monteith.</p>

<p>"Matters are growing worse between the cowmen and the rustlers;
I have heard our men talk, and you have said so yourself."</p>

<p>"I cannot deny it," replied their visitor, thoughtfully smoking
his cigar. He would have been pleased had her brother, now the
head of the little household, decided to make his home once more
in the East, for then he would take up the study of his profession
of law and be placed where he could often meet them.</p>

<p>"It would be cowardly to sell out and abandon the country through
fear of those men," said the brother, to whom the proposition
was not pleasant.</p>

<p>"But suppose you should be their next victim?" suggested Jennie,
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall be a victim," he quietly responded; "this
wound won't bother me long, and with Budd and Grizzly to help,
we can laugh at all the rustlers in the country."</p>

<p>"It is hardly a matter of courage," ventured Sterry, "for no
one knowing you or your sister would question your bravery, but
it is rather the peace of mind of your mother and her. It will
be a long time, if ever, before your parent recovers from the
shock of yesterday. No matter how confident and plucky you may
be, Fred, you know it is no guarantee against a bullet from one
of those scamps at five hundred or a thousand yards. I shudder
to think of what might happen."</p>

<p>Fred turned and looked full in the handsome face of the fellow
beside him.</p>

<p>"It strikes me that you are showing little faith in your own
words. Why do you remain where you are a marked man when there
is no need of it, and where your personal danger is certainly
as great as mine?"</p>

<p>This <em>argumentum ad hominem</em> was so unexpected that Sterry
was embarrassed for the moment, but found voice to reply:</p>

<p>"I have no mother and sister dependent on me, as you have."</p>

<p>"But you have brothers, sisters, father and mother, and therefore
the more to mourn if you should fall. The fact is, Mont, I feel
that it is a duty you owe to them to give up the dangerous calling
you have adopted. You not only do not need it, but are squandering
time that ought to be given to the study of your profession, and
you have become so feared and hated by the rustlers that they
will go to any length to 'remove' you."</p>

<p>"The more cause, therefore, why I should stay," responded the
other.</p>

<p>"A poor argument&mdash;"</p>

<p>The discussion was interrupted by the sound of a horse's hoofs.
Some one was riding toward them on a gallop, and speedily loomed
to view in the bright moonlight. The three instinctively ceased
speaking and gazed curiously at the horseman, who reined up in
front of where they were sitting.</p>

<p>Hospitality is limitless in the West, and, before the stranger
had halted, Fred Whitney rose from his chair and walked forward
to welcome him.</p>

<p>The man was in the costume of a cowboy, with rifle, revolver
and all the paraphernalia of the craft.</p>

<p>"Is your name Whitney?" asked the horseman, speaking first.</p>

<p>"It is; what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Do you know Mont Sterry?"</p>

<p>"He is a particular friend of mine," replied Whitney, refraining
from adding that he was the young man sitting a few paces away
with his sister and hearing every word said.</p>

<p>"Well, there's a letter for him; if I knew where to find him
I would deliver it myself. Will you hand it to him the next time
you meet him?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he leaned forward from his saddle and handed a sealed
envelope to Fred Whitney, who remarked, as he accepted it:</p>

<p>"I will do as you wish; I expect to see him soon; won't you dismount
and stay over night with us?"</p>

<p>"No; I have business elsewhere," was the curt answer, as the
fellow wheeled and spurred off on a gallop.</p>

<p>Budd Hankinson and Grizzly Weber, the two hired men, were absent,
looking after the cattle, for the rustler is a night hawk who
often gets in the best part of his work between the set and rise
of sun.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitney was sitting in the gloom, alone in her sorrow. Jennie
wished to stay with her, but the mother gently refused, saying
she preferred to have none with her. No light was burning in the
building, and that night the weather was unusually mild.</p>

<p>Mont Sterry accepted the paper from the hand of his friend and
remarked, with a smile:</p>

<p>"I suspect what it is. When the rustlers don't like a man they
have a frank way of telling him so, supplemented by a little good
advice, I fancy I have been honoured in a similar way."</p>

<p>He deliberately tore open the envelope, while Jennie and her
brother looked curiously at him. The moonlight, although strong,
was not sufficiently so to show the words, which were written
in lead-pencil. Fred Whitney, therefore, struck a match and held
it in front of the paper, while the recipient read in a low voice,
loud enough, however, to be heard in the impressive hush:</p>

"<em>MONT STERRY: </em>If you stay in the Powder River country twenty-four<br/>
hours longer you are a dead man. Over fifty of us rustlers have<br/>
sworn to shoot you on sight, whether it is at Fort McKinley,<br/>
Buffalo, or on the streets of Cheyenne. I have persuaded the<br/>
majority to hold off for the time named, but not one of them will<br/>
do so an hour longer, nor will I ask them to do so. We are bound<br/>
to make an honest living, and it is weak for me to give you this<br/>
warning, but I do it, repeating that if you are within reach<br/>
twenty-four hours from the night on which this is handed to<br/>
Whitney I will join them in hunting you down, wherever you may be.
