<p>Captain Dohm Shirril was never more in earnest than when he declared
that the Comanches meant to renew their attempt to fire his cabin.</p>

<p>Having come so near success, they would resort to the same means,
taking care to provide against a second ignominious defeat at
the hands of the defenders.</p>

<p>The darkness, on the whole, was far more helpful to the latter
than to their assailants, for, if care was used, it was beyond
the power of the Indians to discover the presence of any person
on the roof. The Comanches, from the force of circumstances, would
have to move back some rods from the building, to see the cover,
and that distance was sufficient to shut out all sight of a figure,
so long as it remained prone. If a man rose to his feet, as Dinah
had done, his outlines would show, and he would become an instant
target for the redskins.</p>

<p>It was with a full conviction of these important facts that the
Texan, imitating the action of his servant, unfastened the scuttle,
and noiselessly let it fall back behind him. Then he thrust his
head and shoulders through and scanned the half of the roof in
his field of vision.</p>

<p>Nothing to cause alarm was discerned, and rising still higher,
he peered over the peak to the other side.</p>

<p>The air had the odor of burning wood, and the cavity burned in
the roof showed signs of life, but they were so slight as to be
harmless. They would soon die out, despite the strong wind still
blowing.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the Texan had not the remotest intention
of following the example of his servant. If he should discover
the presence of an Indian on the roof, little fear of an attempt
to steal upon him unaware and fling him to the earth below. The
captain held his Winchester firmly grasped and most of its chambers
were charged. That offered the true solution of his problem, in
case of the appearance of danger, and he was not the man to hesitate
in such an emergency.</p>

<p>He did not fail to notice that which was observed by his nephew:
the Comanches had ceased their whooping and firing, though the
tramping of their mustangs proved that most of the warriors were
still mounted and circling back and forth in the aimless effort
to detect some means of getting at the defiant inmates of the
house.</p>

<p>"Avon has given them the slip," was his conclusion, "though he
must have had a close call. There is one Indian less, at any rate,
than when he stole out of the cabin."</p>

<p>Such was the fact, though, as we have shown, he did not fall
by the rifle of the youth.</p>

<p>The Texan was standing on the chair in the upper room, with his
head and shoulders through the opening, all his senses on the
alert, when he caught the faint report of a rifle, repeated several
times. The sounds came from a point a long way off, and he could
only conjecture their cause.</p>

<p>"If it was over yonder," he added, referring to a point of the
compass almost opposite, "I would believe the boy fired the gun
and had come in collision with some more of the scamps that are
so plenty to-night, but he can't be over there, because that would
lead him further from the camp of the cattlemen."</p>

<p>And yet, as the reader suspects, the rifle was discharged by
the young man, who, in obedience to the general law, had strayed
in the wrong direction in his blind search for his friends.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to give any attention to matters below stairs.
He could not believe that danger threatened there, but, should
it appear in an unexpected form, the women would give quick notice,
and he could hasten to their aid.</p>

<p>"Avon ought to reach camp in half an hour," continued the Texan,
following his train of thought; "true, he is on foot, but he knows
every step of the way, and won't allow the grass to grow under
his feet; it will take the boys about half a minute to make ready;
the cattle can be left to themselves, so they ought to be here
within three-quarters of an hour, and won't they make fur fly
when they do come!" added the Texan with a thrill; "they will
welcome such a chance to even up matters with these cattle thieves,
who have been hanging round the country for nearly a week; they
will give them a lesson which will make it safe for the women
until we get back, even if gone six months."</p>

<p>Despite his watchfulness against his foes, his gaze continually
wandered to the northward, whence the expected aid was to come.
His elevation was not sufficient to permit him to see beyond the
ridge which his relative must pass to reach camp, but he listened
for the assuring shouts which were sure to proclaim the arrival
of the brave fellows who were always ready to risk their lives
for a friend.</p>

<p>Although the captain relied chiefly upon the darkness to screen
him from sight of the Comanches, he could not feel sure of entire
safety in his situation. In order to hold all of the roof in his
field of vision, he had to keep not only his head but his shoulders
above the level of the scuttle. By doing this, he could look over
the peak, but his danger lay in the evident fact that the Indians
knew the location of the opening, and would use their eyes for
all they were worth in striving to detect anyone venturing out
of it.</p>

<p>The conviction, therefore, was that his conspicuous posture was
likely to reveal his outlines to some watchful warrior, who might
rise to his feet on the back of his steed so as to permit a closer
view of the roof.</p>

<p>No more uncomfortable sensation can be imagined than that of
one who continually invites the skill of a sharp-shooter, and
the Texan met the difficulty not by shrinking, like a turtle,
within his protection, but by climbing stealthily out upon the
planking, where he remained extended at full length.</p>

<p>This rendered him less liable to be seen, but if his assailants
should take a notion to sweep the deck, as may be said, with rifle
bullets, he was far more likely to receive some of them in his
person than he would be by retaining his former place.</p>

<p>But a greater or less degree of danger must attend any effort
to frustrate the designs of the red men, who were inspired by
a hatred intensified by the loss of two of their number.</p>

<p>With his face almost pressing the planking the Texan drew himself,
inch by inch, along the roof, until he was some six feet distant.
Then he paused and listened, slightly raising his head and peering
around in the gloom.</p>

<p>Once he heard the hoofs of a galloping horse, which, however,
quickly ceased. Then several whistle-like signals passed between
the marauders, and he was able to catch the murmur of voices within
the cabin. The wife and servant were talking together, and, though
their words were low, the open doors allowed the slight noise
to reach the ears of the Texan, without telling him what words
were spoken.</p>

<p>Holding his position several minutes, he turned a little to the
left and crept along, until able to look over the low peak of
the roof. He did this by raising his head the few inches necessary
to bring his eyes just above the level.</p>

<p>Everything, so far as he could judge, was the same as before.
The smouldering in the cavity had died out, though the smoke was
as pungent as ever.</p>

<p>"Dinah could not have done her work more effectively, and a reasonable
person ought to be satisfied&#11834;"</p>

<p>His keen sense of hearing apprised him of a noise, slight but
significant, near him. His first thought was that it was in front,
but the next moment he knew it came from the rear. Turning his
head in that direction, without moving his body, he caught the
outlines of a Comanche's head at the lower corner of the roof
behind him. It slowly rose until the shoulders appeared, and no
doubt remained that the Indian was cautiously climbing upon the
roof, to renew the attempt to set fire to it.</p>
