<p>Has any person of any nation or language, found out and given
to the world any occupation, work, diversion, or pursuit, more
subtlely dangerous to the susceptible youth of both sexes than
that of nutting in pairs. If so, who, where, what? A few years
later in life perhaps district visiting, and attending schools
together, may in certain instances be more fatal; but, in the
first bright days of youth, a day's nutting against the world!
A day in autumn, warm enough to make sitting in the sheltered
nooks in the woods, where ever the sunshine lies, very pleasant,
and yet not too warm to make exercise uncomfortable&mdash;two young
people who have been thrown much together, one of whom is conscious
of the state of his feelings towards the other, and is, moreover,
aware that his hours are numbered, and that in a few days at furthest
they will be separated for many months, that persons in authority
on both sides are beginning to suspect something (as is apparent
from the difficulty they have had in getting away together at
all on this same afternoon) here is a conjunction of persons and
circumstances, if ever there was one in the world, which is surely
likely to end in a catastrophe. Indeed, so obvious to the meanest
capacity is the danger of the situation, that, as Tom had, in
his own mind, staked his character for resolution with his private
self on the keeping of his secret till after he was of age, it
is hard to conceive how he can have been foolish enough to get
himself into a hazel copse alone with Miss Mary on the earliest
day he could manage it after the arrival of the Porters, on their
visit to Mr. and Mrs. Brown. That is to say, it would be hard
to conceive, if it didn't just happen to be the most natural thing
in the world.</p>

<p>For the first twenty-four hours after their meeting in the home
of his fathers, the two young people, and Tom in particular, felt
very uncomfortable. Mary, being a young lady of very high spirits,
and, as our readers may probably have discovered, much given to
that kind of conversation which borders as nearly upon what men
commonly call chaff as a well-bred girl can venture on, was annoyed
to find herself quite at fault in all her attempts to get her
old antagonist of Commemoration to show fight. She felt in a moment
how changed his manner was, and thought it by no means changed
for the better. As for Tom, he felt foolish and shy at first,
to an extent which drove him half wild; his words stuck in his
throat, and he took to blushing again like a boy of fourteen.
In fact, he got so angry with himself that he rather avoided her
actual presence, though she was scarcely a moment out of his sight.
Mr. Brown made the best of his son's retreat, devoted himself
most gallantly to Mary, and was completely captivated by her before
bedtime on the first night of their visit. He triumphed over his
wife when they were alone, and laughed at the groundlessness of
her suspicions. But she was by no means so satisfied on the subject
as her husband.</p>

<p>In a day or two, however, Tom began to take heart of grace, and
to find himself oftener at Mary's side, with something to say,
and more to look. But now she, in her turn, began to be embarrassed;
for all attempts to re-establish their old footing failed, and
the difficulty of finding a satisfactory new one remained to be
solved. So for the present, though neither of them found it quite
satisfactory, they took refuge in the presence of a third party,
and attached themselves to Katie, talking at one another through
her. Nothing could exceed Katie's judiciousness as a medium of
communication; and through her a better understanding began to
establish itself, and the visit which both of them had been looking
forward to so eagerly seemed likely, after all, to be as pleasant
in fact as it had been in anticipation. As they became more at
ease, the vigilance of Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Porter seemed likely
to revive. But in a country house there must be plenty of chances
for young folks who mean it, to be together; and so they found
and made use of their opportunities, giving at the same time as
little cause to their natural guardians as possible for any serious
interference. The families got on, on the whole, so well together,
that the visit was prolonged from the original four or five days
to a fortnight; and this time of grace was drawing to a close
when the event happened which made the visit memorable to our
hero.</p>

<p>On the morning in question, Mr. Brown arranged at breakfast that
he and his wife should drive Mr. and Mrs. Porter to make calls
on several of the neighbors. Tom declared his intention of taking
a long day after the partridges, and the young ladies were to
go and make a sketch of the house from a point which Katie had
chosen. Accordingly, directly after luncheon, the carriage came
round, and the elders departed; and the young ladies started together,
carrying their sketching apparatus with them.</p>

<p>It was probably a bad day for scent; for they had not been gone
a quarter of an hour when Tom came home, deposited his gun, and
followed on their steps. He found them sitting under the lee of
a high bank, sufficiently intent on their drawings, but neither
surprised nor sorry to find that he had altered his mind, and
come back to interrupt them. So he lay down near them, and talked
of Oxford and Englebourn, and so from one thing to another, till
he got upon the subject of nutting, and the sylvan beauties of
a neighbouring wood. Mary was getting on badly with her drawing,
and jumped at the idea of a ramble in the wood; but Katie was
obdurate, and resisted all their solicitations to move. She suggested,
however, that they might go; and, as Tom declared that they should
not be out of call, and would be back in half an hour at furthest,
Mary consented; and they left the sketcher and strolled together
out of the fields, and into the road, and so through a gate into
the wood. It was a pleasant oak wood. The wild flowers were over,
but the great masses of ferns, four or five feet high, made a
grand carpet round the stems of the forest monarchs, and a fitting
couch for here and there one of them which had been lately felled,
and lay in fallen majesty, with bare shrouded trunk awaiting the
sawyers. Further on, the hazel underwood stood thickly on each
side of the green rides, down which they sauntered side by side.
Tom talked of the beauty of the wood in spring-time, and the glorious
succession of colouring&mdash;pale yellow, and deep blue and white,
and purple&mdash;which the primroses, and hyacinths and starwort, and
foxgloves gave, each in their turn, in the early year, and mourned
over their absence. But Mary preferred Autumn, and would not agree
with him. She was enthusiastic for ferns and heather. He gathered
some sprigs of the latter for her, from a little sandy patch which
they passed, and some more for his own button-hole, and then they
engaged in the absorbing pursuit of nutting, and the talk almost
ceased. He caught the higher branches, and bent them down to her,
and watched her as she gathered them, and wondered at the ease
and grace of all her movements, and the unconscious beauty of
her attitudes. Soon she became more enterprising herself, and
made little excursions into the copse, surmounting briers, and
passing through tangled places like a Naiad, before he could be
there to help her. And so they went on, along the rides and through
the copse, forgetting Katie and time, till they were brought up
by the fence on the further side of the wood. The ditch was on
the outside, and on the inside a bank with a hedge on the top,
full of tempting hazel-bushes. She clapped her hands at the sight,
and, declining his help, stepped lightly up the bank and began
gathering. He turned away for a moment, jumped up the bank himself,
and followed her example.</p>

<p>He was standing up in the hedge, and reaching after a tempting
cluster of nuts, when he heard a short sharp cry of pain behind
him, which made him spring backwards, and nearly miss his footing
as he came to the ground. Recovering himself, and turning round,
he saw Mary lying at the foot of the bank, writhing in pain.</p>

<p>He was at her side in a minute and dreadfully alarmed.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what has happened?" he said.</p>

<p>"My ankle!" she cried; and the effort of speaking brought the
sudden flush of pain to her brow.</p>

<p>"Oh! what can I do?"</p>

<p>"The boot! the boot!" she said, leaning forward to unlace it,
and then sinking back against the bank. "It is so painful. I hope
I sha'n't faint!"</p>

<p>Poor Tom could only clasp his hands as he knelt by her, and repeat,
"Oh, what can I do&mdash;what can I do?" His utter bewilderment presently
aroused Mary, and her natural high courage was beginning to master
the pain.</p>

<p>"Have you a knife?"</p>

<p>"Yes here," he said, pulling one out of his pocket, and opening
it; "here it is."</p>

<p>"Please cut the lace."</p>

<p>Tom, with beating heart and trembling hand, cut the lace and
then looked up at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, be quick&mdash;cut it again! Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>He cut it again; and, without taking hold of the foot, gently
pulled out the ends of the lace.</p>

<p>She again leaned forward, and tried to take off the boot; but
the pain was too great, and she sank back, and put her hand up
to her flushed face.</p>

<p>"May I try?&mdash;perhaps I could do it."</p>

<p>"Yes, pray do. Oh, I can't bear the pain!" she added, next moment;
and Tom felt ready to hang himself for having been the cause of
it.</p>

<p>"You must cut the boot off, please."</p>

<p>"But perhaps I may cut you. Do you really mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really. There, take care. How your hand shakes. You will
never do for a doctor."</p>

<p>His hand did shake, certainly. He had cut a little hole the stocking;
but, under the circumstances, we need not wonder&mdash;the situation
was new and trying. Urged on by her, he cut and cut away, and,
at last, off came the boot, and her beautiful little foot lay
on the green turf. She was much relieved at once, but still in
great pain; and now he began to recover his head.</p>

<p>"The ankle should be bound up; may I try?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but what with?"</p>

<p>Tom dived into his shooting-coat pocket, and produced one of
the large, many-colored neck-wrappers which were fashionable at
Oxford in those days.</p>

<p>"How lucky!" he said, as he tore it into strips. "I think this
will do. Now, you'll stop me, won't you, if I hurt you, or don't
do it right?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, I'm much better. Bind it tight, tighter than
that."</p>

<p>He wound the strips as tenderly as he could round her foot and
ankle, with hands all alive with nerves, and wondering more and
more at her courage as she kept urging him to draw the bandage
tighter yet. Then, still under her direction, he fastened and
pinned down the ends; and as he was rather neat with his fingers,
from the practice of tying flies and splicing rods and bats, produced,
on the whole, a creditable sort of bandage. Then he looked up
at her, the perspiration standing on his forehead, as if he had
been pulling a race, and said,</p>

<p>"Will that do? I'm afraid it's very awkward."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; thank you so much! But I'm so sorry you have torn your
handkerchief."</p>

<p>Tom made no answer to this remark, except by a look. What could
he say, but that he would gladly have torn his skin off for the
same purpose, if it would have been of any use. But this speech
did not seem quite the thing for the moment.</p>

<p>"But how do you feel? Is it very painful?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rather. But don't look so anxious. Indeed, it is very bearable.
But what are we to do now?"</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and said, with something like a sigh&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shall I run home, and bring the servants and a sofa, or something
to carry you on?"</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't like to be left here alone."</p>

<p>His face brightened again.</p>

<p>"How near is the nearest cottage?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There's none nearer than the one which we passed on the road&mdash;on
the other side of the wood, you know."</p>

<p>"Then I must try to get there. You must help me up."</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and stooped over her, doubting how to begin
helping her. He had never felt so shy in his life. He held out
his hands.</p>

<p>"I think you must put your arm round me," she said, after looking
at him for a moment. He lifted her on to her feet.</p>

<p>"Now let me lean on your arm. There, I dare say I shall manage
to hobble along well enough;" and she made a brave attempt to
walk. But the moment the injured foot touched the ground, she
stopped with a catch at her breath, and a shiver, which went through
Tom like a knife; and the flush came back into her face, and she
would have fallen had he not again put his arm round her waist,
and held her up. "I am better again now," she said, after a second
or two.</p>

<p>"But Mary, dear Mary, don't try to walk again. For my sake. I
can't bear it."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" she said. "I must get back somehow."</p>

<p>"Will you let me carry you?"</p>

<p>She looked in his face again, and then dropped her eyes, and
hesitated.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't offer, dear, if there were any other way. But you
mustn't walk. Indeed, you must not; you may lame yourself for
life."</p>

<p>He spoke very quietly, with his eyes fixed on the ground, though
his heart was beating so that he feared she would hear it.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said; "but I'm very heavy."</p>

<p>So he lifted her gently, and stepped off down the ride, carrying
his whole world in his arms, in an indescribable flutter of joy,
and triumph, and fear. He had gone some forty yards or so, when
he staggered, and stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray put me down&mdash;pray do! You'll hurt yourself. I'm too
heavy."</p>

<p>For the credit of muscular Christianity, one must say that it
was not her weight, but the tumult in his own inner man, which
made her bearer totter. Nevertheless, if one is wholly unused
to the exercise, the carrying of a healthy young English girl
weighing a good eight stone, is as much as most men can conveniently
manage.</p>

<p>"I'll just put you down for a moment," he said. "Now, take care
of the foot;" and he stooped and placed her tenderly against one
of the oaks which bordered the ride, standing by her side without
looking at her. Neither of them spoke for a minute. Then he asked,
still looking away down the ride, "How is the foot?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty well," she answered, cheerfully. "Now, leave me here,
and go for help. It is absurd of me to mind being left, and you
mustn't carry me any more."</p>

<p>He turned, and their eyes met for a moment, but that was enough.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but take care. Don't go far. Stop directly you feel tired."</p>

<p>Then he lifted her again, and this time carried her without faltering,
till they came to a hillock covered with soft grass. Here they
rested again, and so by easy stages he carried her through the
wood, and out into the road, to the nearest cottage, neither of
them speaking.</p>

<p>An old woman came to the door in answer to his kick, and went
off into ejaculations of pity and wonder in the broadest Berkshire,
at seeing Master Tom and his burthen. But he pushed into the house
and cut her short with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Pike, don't talk, that's a dear good woman, but bustle
about, and bring that arm-chair here, and the other low one, with
a pillow on it, for the young lady's foot to rest on."</p>

<p>The old woman obeyed his injunctions, except as to talking; and,
while she placed the chairs and shook up the pillow, descanted
on the sovereign virtues of some green oil and opodeldoc, which
was as good as a charm for sprains and bruises.</p>

<p>Mary gave him one grateful look as he lowered her tenderly and
reluctantly into the chair, and then spoke cheerfully to Mrs.
Pike, who was foraging in a cupboard, to find if there was any
of her famous specific in the bottom of the bottle. As he stood
up, and thought what to do next, he heard the sound of distant
wheels, and looking through the window saw the carriage coming
homewards. It was a sorrowful sight to him.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Pike," he said, "never mind the oil. Here's the carriage
coming; just step out and stop it."</p>

<p>The old dame scuttled out into the road. The carriage was within
one hundred yards. He leant over the rough arm-chair in which
Mary was leaning back, looked once more into her eyes; and then,
stooping forwards, kissed her lips, and the next moment was by
the side of Mrs. Pike, signalling the coachman to stop.</p>

<p>In the bustle which followed he stood aside, and watched Mary
with his heart in his mouth. She never looked at him, but there
was no anger, but only a dreamy look in her sweet face, which
seemed to him a thousand times more beautiful than ever before.
Then, to avoid inquiries, and to realize all that had passed in
the last wonderful three hours, he slipped away while they were
getting her into the carriage, and wandered back into the wood,
pausing at each of their halting places. At last he reached the
scene of the accident, and here his cup of happiness was likely
to brim over, for he found the mangled little boot and the cut
lace, and securing the precious prize, hurried back home, to be
in time for dinner.</p>

<p>Mary did not come down; but Katie, the only person of whom he
dared to inquire, assured him that she was doing famously. The
dinner was very embarrassing, and he had the greatest difficulty
in answering the searching inquiries of his mother and Mrs. Porter,
as to how, when, where, and in whose presence the accident had
happened. As soon as the ladies rose, he left his father and Mr.
Porter over their old port and politics, and went out in the twilight
into the garden, burthened with the weight of sweet thought. He
felt that he had something to do&mdash;to set himself quite right with
Mary; he must speak somehow, that night, if possible, or he should
not be comfortable or at peace with his conscience. There were
lights in her room. He guessed by the shadows that she was lying
on a couch by the open window, round which the other ladies were
flitting.</p>

<p>Presently lights appeared in the drawing-room; and, as the shutters
were being closed, he saw his mother and Mrs. Porter come in,
and sit down near the fire. Listening intently, he heard Katie
talking in a low voice in the room above, and saw her head against
the light as she sat down close to the window, probably at the
head of the couch where Mary was lying. Should he call to her?
If he did, how could he say what he wanted to say through her?</p>

<p>A happy thought struck him. He turned to the flowerbeds, hunted
about, and gathered a bunch of heliotrope, hurried up to his room,
took the sprig of heather out of his shooting coat, tied them
together, caught up a reel and line from his table, and went into
the room over Mary's. He threw the window open, and, leaning out,
said gently,</p>

<p>"Katie." No answer. He repeated the name louder. No answer still,
and, leaning out yet further, he saw that the window had been
shut. He lowered the bunch of flowers, and, swinging it backwards
and forward, made it strike the window below&mdash;once, twice; at
the third stroke he heard the window open.</p>

<p>"Katie," he whispered again, "is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, where are you? What is this?"</p>

<p>"For her," he said, in the same whisper. Katie untied the flowers,
and he waited a few moments, and then again called her name, and
she answered.</p>

<p>"Has she the flowers?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and she sends you her love, and says you are to go down
to the drawing-room;" and with that the window closed, and he
went down with a lightened conscience into the drawing-room, and,
after joining in the talk by the fire for a few minutes, took
a book, and sat down at the further side of the table. Whether
he ever knew what the book was may be fairly questioned, but to
all appearances he was deep in the perusal of it till the tea
and Katie arrived, and the gentlemen from the dining-room. Then
he tried to join in the conversation again; but, on the whole,
life was a burthen to him that night, till he could get fairly
away to his own room, and commune with himself, gazing at the
yellow harvest moon, with his elbows on the window sill.</p>

<p>The ankle got well very quickly, and Mary was soon going about
with a gold-headed stick which had belonged to Mr. Brown's father,
and a limp which Tom thought the most beautiful movement he had
ever seen. But, though she was about again, by no amount of patient
vigilance could he now get the chance of speaking to her alone.
But he consoled himself with the thought that she must understand
him; if he had spoken he couldn't have made himself clearer.</p>

<p>And now the Porters' visit was all but over, and Katie and her
father left for Englebourn. The Porters were to follow the next
day, and promised to drive round and stop at the Rectory for lunch.
Tom petitioned for a seat in their carriage to Englebourn. He
had been devoting himself to Mrs. Porter ever since the accident,
and had told her a good deal about his own early life. His account
of his early friendship for Betty and her son, and the renewal
of it on the day he left Barton Manor, had interested her, and
she was moreover not insensible to his assiduous and respectful
attentions to herself, which had of late been quite marked; she
was touched, too, at his anxiety to hear all about her boys, and
how they were getting on at school. So on the whole Tom was in
high favour with her, and she most graciously assented to his
occupying the fourth seat in their barouche. She was not without
her suspicions of the real state of the case with him; but his
behavior had been so discreet that she had no immediate fears;
and, after all, if anything should come of it some years hence,
her daughter might do worse. In the meantime she would see plenty
of society in London; where Mr. Porter's vocations kept him during
the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>They reached Englebourn after a pleasant long morning's drive;
and Tom stole a glance at Mary and felt that she understood him,
as he pointed out the Hawk's Lynch and the clump of scotch firs
to her mother; and told how you might see Barton from the top
of it, and how he loved the place, and the old trees, and the
view.</p>

<p>Katie was at the door ready to receive them, and carried off
Mary and Mrs. Porter to her own room. Tom walked round the garden
with Mr. Porter, and then sat in the drawing-room, and felt melancholy.
He roused himself, however, when the ladies came down and luncheon
was announced. Mary was full of her reminiscences of the Englebourn
people, and especially of poor Mrs. Winburn and her son, in whom
she had begun to take a deep interest, perhaps from overhearing
some of Tom's talk to her mother. So Harry's story was canvassed
again, and Katie told them how he had been turned out of his cottage,
and how anxious she was as to what would come of it.</p>

<p>"And is he going to marry your gardener's daughter after all?"
asked Mrs. Porter.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is not much chance of it," said Katie; "I
cannot make Martha out."</p>

<p>"Is she at home, Katie?" asked Mary; "I should like to see her
again. I took a great fancy to her when I was here."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is at the lodge. We will walk there after luncheon."</p>

<p>So it was settled that the carriage should pick them up at the
lodge; and soon after luncheon, while the horses were being put
to, the whole party started for the lodge, after saying good-bye
to Mr. Winter, who retired to his room much fatigued by his unwonted
hospitality.</p>

<p>Old Simon's wife answered their knock at the lodge door, and
they all entered, and Mrs. Porter paid her compliments on the
cleanliness of the room.</p>

<p>Then Mary said, "Is your daughter at home, Mrs. Gibbons?"</p>

<p>"Ees, miss, someweres handy," replied Mrs. Gibbons; "her hav'n't
been gone out, not dree minnit."</p>

<p>"I should like so much to say good-bye to her," said Mary. "We
shall be leaving Barton soon, and I shall not see her again till
next summer."</p>

<p>"Lor bless'ee, miss, 'tis werry good ov'ee," said the old dame,
very proud; "do'ee set down then while I gees her a call." And
with that she hurried out of the door which led through the back
kitchen into the little yard behind the lodge, and the next moment
they heard her calling out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Patty, Patty, wher bist got to? Come in and see the gentlefolk."</p>

<p>The name which the old woman was calling out made Tom start.</p>

<p>"I thought you said her name was Martha," said Mrs. Porter.</p>

<p>"Patty is short for Martha in Berkshire," said Katie, laughing.</p>

<p>"And Patty is such a pretty name. I wonder you don't call her
Patty," said Mary.</p>

<p>"We had a housemaid of the same name a year or two ago, and it
made such a confusion&mdash;and when one once gets used to a name it
is so hard to change&mdash;so she has always been called Martha."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm all for Patty; don't you think so?" said Mary, turning
to Tom.</p>

<p>The sudden introduction of a name which he had such reasons for
remembering, the memories and fears which it called up&mdash;above
all, the bewilderment which he felt at hearing it tossed about
and canvassed by Mary in his presence, as if there were nothing
more in it than in any other name&mdash;confused him so that he floundered
and blundered in his attempt to answer, and at last gave it up
altogether. She was surprised, and looked at him inquiringly.
His eyes fell before hers, and he turned away to the window, and
looked at the carriage, which had just drawn up at the lodge door.
He had scarcely time to think how foolish he was to be so moved,
when he heard the back-kitchen door open again, and the old woman
and her daughter come in.</p>

<p>He turned round sharply, and there on the floor of the room,
courtseying to the ladies, stood the ex-barmaid of the "Choughs".
His first impulse was to hurry away&mdash;she was looking down, and
he might not be recognized; his next, to stand his ground, and
take whatever might come. Mary went up to her and took her hand,
saying that she could not go away without coming to see her. Patty
looked up to answer, and, glancing round the room, caught sight
of him.</p>

<p>He stepped forward, and then stopped and tried to speak, but
no words would come. Patty looked at him, dropped Mary's hand,
blushed up to the roots of her hair as she looked timidly round
at the wondering spectators, and, putting her hands to her face,
ran out of the back door again.</p>

<p>"Lawk a massy! what ever can ha' cum to our Patty?" said Mrs.
Gibbons, following her out.</p>

<p>"I think we had better go," said Mr. Porter, giving his arm to
his daughter, and leading her to the door, "Goodbye, Katie; shall
we see you again at Barton?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, uncle," Katie answered, following with Mrs. Porter,
in a state of sad bewilderment.</p>

<p>Tom, with his brain swimming, got out a few stammering farewell
words, which Mr. and Mrs. Porter received with marked coldness,
as they stepped into their carriage. Mary's face was flushed and
uneasy; but at her he scarcely dared to steal a look, and to her
was quite unable to speak a word.</p>

<p>Then the carriage drove off, and he turned, and found Katie standing
at his side, her eyes full of serious wonder. His fell before
them.</p>

<p>"My dear Tom," she said, "what is all this? I thought you had
never seen Martha?"</p>

<p>"So I thought&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I can't talk now &mdash;I'll explain
all to you&mdash;don't think very badly of me, Katie &mdash;God bless
you!" with which words he strode away, while she looked after
him with increasing wonder, and then turned and went into the
lodge.</p>

<p>He hastened away from the Rectory and down the village street,
taking the road home mechanically, but otherwise wholly unconscious
of roads and men. David, who was very anxious to speak to him
about Harry, stood at his door making signs to him to stop, in
vain; and then gave chase, calling out after him, till he saw
that all attempts to attract his notice were useless, and so ambled
back to his shop-board much troubled in mind.</p>

<p>The first object which recalled Tom at all to himself was the
little white cottage looking out of Englebourn copse towards the
village, in which he had sat by poor Betty's death-bed. The garden
was already getting wild and tangled, and the house seemed uninhabited.
He stopped for a moment and looked at it with bitter searchings
of heart. Here was the place where he had taken such a good turn,
as he had fondly hoped&mdash;in connection with the then inmates of
which he had made the strongest good resolutions he had ever made
in his life perhaps. What was the good of his trying to befriend
anybody? His friendship turned to a blight; whatever he had as
yet tried to do for Harry had only injured him, and now how did
they stand? Could they ever be friends again after that day's
discovery? To do him justice, the probable ruin of all his own
prospects, the sudden coldness of Mr. and Mrs. Porter's looks,
and Mary's averted face, were not the things he thought of first,
and did not trouble him most. He thought of Harry, and shuddered
at the wrong he had done him as he looked at his deserted home.
The door opened and a figure appeared. It was Mr. Wurley's agent,
the lawyer who had been employed by Farmer Tester in his contest
with Harry and his mates about the pound. The man of law saluted
him with a smirk of scarcely concealed triumph, and then turned
into the house again and shut the door, as if he did not consider
further communication necessary or safe. Tom turned with a muttered
imprecation on him and his master, and hurried away along the
lane which led to the heath. The Hawk's Lynch lay above him, and
he climbed the side mechanically and sat himself again on the
old spot.</p>

<p>He sat for some time looking over the landscape, graven on his
mind as it was by his former visit, and bitterly, oh, how bitterly!
did the remembrance of that visit, and of the exultation and triumph
which then filled him, and carried him away over the heath with
a shout towards his home, come back on him. He could look out
from his watchtower no longer, and lay down with his face between
his hands on the turf, and groaned as he lay.</p>

<p>But his good angel seemed to haunt the place, and soon the cold
fit began to pass away, and better and more hopeful thoughts to
return. After all what had he done since his last visit to that
place to be ashamed of? Nothing. His attempts to do Harry service,
unlucky as they had proved, had been honest. Had he become less
worthy of the love which had first consciously mastered him there
some four weeks ago? No; he felt on the contrary, that it had
already raised him, and purified him, and made a man of him. But
this last discovery, how could he ever get over that? Well, after
all, the facts were just the same as before; only now they had
come out. It was right that they should have come out; better
for him and for everyone that they should be known and faced.
He was ready to face them, to abide any consequences that they
might now bring in their train. His heart was right towards Mary,
towards Patty, towards Harry&mdash;that he felt sure of. And, if so,
why should he despair of either his love or his friendship coming
to a good end?</p>

<p>And so he sat up again, and looked out bravely towards Barton,
and began to consider what was to be done. His eye rested on the
Rectory. That was the first place to begin with. He must set himself
right with Katie&mdash;let her know the whole story. Through her he
could reach all the rest, and do whatever must be done to clear
the ground and start fresh again.</p>

<p>At first he thought of returning to her at once, and rose to
go down to Englebourn. But anything like retracing his steps was
utterly distasteful to him just then. Before him he saw light,
dim enough as yet, but still a dawning; towards that he would
press, leaving everything behind him to take care of itself. So
he turned northwards, and struck across the heath at his best
pace. The violent exercise almost finished his cure, and his thoughts
became clearer and more hopeful as he neared home. He arrived
there as the household was going to bed, and found a letter waiting
for him. It was from Hardy, saying that Blake had left him, and
he was now thinking of returning to Oxford, and would come for
his long talked of visit to Berkshire, if Tom was still at home,
and in the mind to receive him.</p>

<p>Never was a letter more opportune. Here was the tried friend
on whom he could rely for help and advice and sympathy&mdash;who knew
all the facts too from beginning to end! His father and mother
were delighted to hear that they should now see the friend of
whom he had spoken so much. So he went up stairs and wrote an
answer, which set Hardy to work packing his portmanteau in the
far west, and brought him speedily to the side of his friend under
the lee of the Berkshire hills.</p>
