<blockquote>&quot;Surgebat Macnevisius<br>
Et mox jactabat ultro,<br>
Pugnabo tua gratia<br>
Feroci hoc Mactwoltro.&quot;<br>&mdash; Etonian.</blockquote>
<P>There is a certain sort of fellow - we who are used to studying
boys all know him well enough - of whom you can predicate with
almost positive certainty, after he has been a month at school,
that he is sure to have a fight, and with almost equal certainty
that he will have but one.  Tom Brown was one of these; and as
it is our well-weighed intention to give a full, true, and
correct account of Tom's only single combat with a school-fellow
in the manner of our old friend Bell's Life, let those young
persons whose stomachs are not strong, or who think a good set-
to with the weapons which God has given us all an uncivilized,
unchristian, or ungentlemanly affair, just skip this chapter at
once, for it won't be to their taste.</P>
<P>It was not at all usual in those days for two School-house boys
to have a fight.  Of course there were exceptions, when some
cross-grained, hard-headed fellow came up who would never be
happy unless he was quarrelling with his nearest neighbours, or
when there was some class-dispute, between the fifth form and
the fags, for instance, which required blood-letting; and a
champion was picked out on each side tacitly, who settled the
matter by a good hearty mill.  But, for the most part, the
constant use of those surest keepers of the peace, the boxing-
gloves, kept the School-house boys from fighting one another.
Two or three nights in every week the gloves were brought out,
either in the hall or fifth-form room; and every boy who was
ever likely to fight at all knew all his neighbours' prowess
perfectly well, and could tell to a nicety what chance he would
have in a stand-up fight with any other boy in the house.  But,
of course, no such experience could be gotten as regarded boys
in other houses; and as most of the other houses were more or
less jealous of the School-house, collisions were frequent.</P>
<P>After all, what would life be without fighting, I should like to
know?  From the cradle to the grave, fighting, rightly
understood, is the business, the real highest, honestest
business of every son of man.  Every one who is worth his salt
has his enemies, who must be beaten, be they evil thoughts and
habits in himself, or spiritual wickednesses in high places, or
Russians, or Border-ruffians, or Bill, Tom, or Harry, who will
not let him live his life in quiet till he has thrashed them.</P>
<P>It is no good for quakers, or any other body of men, to uplift
their voices against fighting.  Human nature is too strong for
them, and they don't follow their own precepts.  Every soul of
them is doing his own piece of fighting, somehow and somewhere.
The world might be a better world without fighting, for anything
I know, but it wouldn't be our world; and therefore I am dead
against crying peace when there is no peace, and isn't meant to
be.  I am as sorry as any man to see folk fighting the wrong
people and the wrong things, but I'd a deal sooner see them
doing that than that they should have no fight in them.  So
having recorded, and being about to record, my hero's fights of
all sorts, with all sorts of enemies, I shall now proceed to
give an account of his passage-at-arms with the only one of his
school-fellows whom he ever had to encounter in this manner.</P>
<P>It was drawing towards the close of Arthur's first half-year,
and the May evenings were lengthening out.  Locking-up was not
till eight o'clock, and everybody was beginning to talk about
what he would do in the holidays.  The shell, in which form all
our dramatis personae now are, were reading, amongst other
things, the last book of Homer's &quot;Iliad,&quot; and had worked through
it as far as the speeches of the women over Hector's body.  It
is a whole school-day, and four or five of the School-house boys
(amongst whom are Arthur, Tom, and East) are preparing third
lesson together.  They have finished the regulation forty lines,
and are for the most part getting very tired, notwithstanding
the exquisite pathos of Helen's lamentation.  And now several
long four-syllabled words come together, and the boy with the
dictionary strikes work.</P>
<P>&quot;I am not going to look out any more words,&quot; says he; &quot;we've
done the quantity.  Ten to one we shan't get so far.  Let's go
out into the close.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come along, boys,&quot; cries East, always ready to leave &quot;the
grind,&quot; as he called it; &quot;our old coach is laid up, you know,
and we shall have one of the new masters, who's sure to go slow
and let us down easy.&quot;</P>
<P>So an adjournment to the close was carried nem. con., little
Arthur not daring to uplift his voice; but, being deeply
interested in what they were reading, stayed quietly behind, and
learnt on for his own pleasure.</P>
<P>As East had said, the regular master of the form was unwell, and
they were to be heard by one of the new masters - quite a young
man, who had only just left the university.  Certainly it would
be hard lines if, by dawdling as much as possible in coming in
and taking their places, entering into long-winded explanations
of what was the usual course of the regular master of the form,
and others of the stock contrivances of boys for wasting time in
school, they could not spin out the lesson so that he should not
work them through more than the forty lines.  As to which
quantity there was a perpetual fight going on between the master
and his form - the latter insisting, and enforcing by passive
resistance, that it was the prescribed quantity of Homer for a
shell lesson; the former, that there was no fixed quantity, but
that they must always be ready to go on to fifty or sixty lines
if there were time within the hour.  However, notwithstanding
all their efforts, the new master got on horribly quick.  He
seemed to have the bad taste to be really interested in the
lesson, and to be trying to work them up into something like
appreciation of it, giving them good, spirited English words,
instead of the wretched bald stuff into which they rendered poor
old Homer, and construing over each piece himself to them, after
each boy, to show them how it should be done.</P>
<P>Now the clock strikes the three-quarters; there is only a
quarter of an hour more, but the forty lines are all but done.
So the boys, one after another, who are called up, stick more
and more, and make balder and ever more bald work of it.  The
poor young master is pretty near beat by this time, and feels
ready to knock his head against the wall, or his fingers against
somebody else's head.  So he gives up altogether the lower and
middle parts of the form, and looks round in despair at the boys
on the top bench, to see if there is one out of whom he can
strike a spark or two, and who will be too chivalrous to murder
the most beautiful utterances of the most beautiful woman of the
old world.  His eye rests on Arthur, and he calls him up to
finish construing Helen's speech.  Whereupon all the other boys
draw long breaths, and begin to stare about and take it easy.
They are all safe:  Arthur is the head of the form, and sure to
be able to construe, and that will tide on safely till the hour
strikes.</P>
<P>Arthur proceeds to read out the passage in Greek before
construing it, as the custom is.  Tom, who isn't paying much
attention, is suddenly caught by the falter in his voice as he
reads the two lines&mdash;</P>
<P>[greek text deleted]</P>
<P>He looks up at Arthur,  &quot;Why, bless us,&quot; thinks he, &quot;what can be
the matter with the young un?  He's never going to get floored.
He's sure to have learnt to the end.&quot;  Next moment he is
reassured by the spirited tone in which Arthur begins
construing, and betakes himself to drawing dogs' heads in his
notebook, while the master, evidently enjoying the change, turns
his back on the middle bench and stands before Arthur, beating a
sort of time with his hand and foot, and saying; &quot;Yes, yes,&quot;
&quot;Very well,&quot; as Arthur goes on.</P>
<P>But as he nears the fatal two lines, Tom catches that falter,
and again looks up.  He sees that there is something the matter;
Arthur can hardly get on at all.  What can it be?</P>
<P>Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down altogether, and fairly
bursts out crying, and dashes the cuff of his jacket across his
eyes, blushing up to the roots of his hair, and feeling as if he
should like to go down suddenly through the floor.  The whole
form are taken aback; most of them stare stupidly at him, while
those who are gifted with presence of mind find their places and
look steadily at their books, in hopes of not catching the
master's eye and getting called up in Arthur's place.</P>
<P>The master looks puzzled for a moment, and then seeing, as the
fact is, that the boy is really affected to tears by the most
touching thing in Homer, perhaps in all profane poetry put
together, steps up to him and lays his hand kindly on his
shoulder, saying, &quot;Never mind, my little man, you've construed
very well.  Stop a minute; there's no hurry.&quot;</P>
<P>Now, as luck would have it, there sat next above Tom on that
day, in the middle bench of the form, a big boy, by name
Williams, generally supposed to be the cock of the shell,
therefore of all the school below the fifths.  The small boys,
who are great speculators on the prowess of their elders, used
to hold forth to one another about Williams's great strength,
and to discuss whether East or Brown would take a licking from
him.  He was called Slogger Williams, from the force with which
it was supposed he could hit.  In the main, he was a rough,
goodnatured fellow enough, but very much alive to his own
dignity.  He reckoned himself the king of the form, and kept up
his position with the strong hand, especially in the matter of
forcing boys not to construe more than the legitimate forty
lines.  He had already grunted and grumbled to himself when
Arthur went on reading beyond the forty lines; but now that he
had broken down just in the middle of all the long words, the
Slogger's wrath was fairly roused.</P>
<P>&quot;Sneaking little brute,&quot; muttered he, regardless of prudence - 
&quot;clapping on the water-works just in the hardest place; see if I
don't punch his head after fourth lesson.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Whose?&quot; said Tom, to whom the remark seemed to be addressed.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, that little sneak, Arthur's,&quot; replied Williams.</P>
<P>&quot;No, you shan't,&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo!&quot; exclaimed Williams, looking at Tom with great surprise
for a moment, and then giving him a sudden dig in the ribs with
his elbow, which sent Tom's books flying on to the floor, and
called the attention of the master, who turned suddenly round,
and seeing the state of things, said, -</P>
<P>&quot;Williams, go down three places, and then go on.&quot;</P>
<P>The Slogger found his legs very slowly, and proceeded to go
below Tom and two other boys with great disgust; and then,
turning round and facing the master, said, &quot;I haven't learnt any
more, sir; our lesson is only forty lines.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is that so?&quot; said the master, appealing generally to the top
bench.  No answer.</P>
<P>&quot;Who is the head boy of the form?&quot; said he, waxing wroth.</P>
<P>&quot;Arthur, sir,&quot; answered three or four boys, indicating our
friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, your name's Arthur.  Well, now, what is the length of your
regular lesson?&quot;</P>
<P>Arthur hesitated a moment, and then said, &quot;We call it only forty
lines, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How do you mean - you call it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sir, Mr. Graham says we ain't to stop there when there's
time to construe more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand,&quot; said the master.  - &quot;Williams, go down three
more places, and write me out the lesson in Greek and English.
And now, Arthur, finish construing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! would I be in Arthur's shoes after fourth lesson?&quot; said the
little boys to one another; but Arthur finished Helen's speech
without any further catastrophe, and the clock struck four,
which ended third lesson.</P>
<P>Another hour was occupied in preparing and saying fourth lesson,
during which Williams was bottling up his wrath; and when five
struck, and the lessons for the day were over, he prepared to
take summary vengeance on the innocent cause of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Tom was detained in school a few minutes after the rest, and on
coming out into the quadrangle, the first thing he saw was a
small ring of boys, applauding Williams, who was holding Arthur
by the collar.</P>
<P>&quot;There, you young sneak,&quot; said he, giving Arthur a cuff on the
head with his other hand; &quot;what made you say that - &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo!&quot; said Tom, shouldering into the crowd; &quot;you drop that,
Williams; you shan't touch him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who'll stop me?&quot; said the Slogger, raising his hand again.</P>
<P>&quot;I,&quot; said Tom; and suiting the action to the word he struck the
arm which held Arthur's arm so sharply that the Slogger dropped
it with a start, and turned the full current of his wrath on
Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you fight?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Huzza!  There's going to be a fight between Slogger Williams
and Tom Brown!&quot;</P>
<P>The news ran like wildfire about, and many boys who were on
their way to tea at their several houses turned back, and sought
the back of the chapel, where the fights come off.</P>
<P>&quot;Just run and tell East to come and back me,&quot; said Tom to a
small School-house boy, who was off like a rocket to
Harrowell's, just stopping for a moment to poke his head into
the School-house hall, where the lower boys were already at tea,
and sing out, &quot;Fight!  Tom Brown and Slogger Williams.&quot;</P>
<P>Up start half the boys at once, leaving bread, eggs, butter,
sprats, and all the rest to take care of themselves.  The
greater part of the remainder follow in a minute, after
swallowing their tea, carrying their food in their hands to
consume as they go.  Three or four only remain, who steal the
butter of the more impetuous, and make to themselves an unctuous
feast.</P>
<P>In another minute East and Martin tear through the quadrangle,
carrying a sponge, and arrive at the scene of action just as the
combatants are beginning to strip.</P>
<P>Tom felt he had got his work cut out for him, as he stripped off
his jacket, waistcoat, and braces.  East tied his handkerchief
round his waist, and rolled up his shirtsleeves for him.  &quot;Now,
old boy, don't you open your mouth to say a word, or try to help
yourself a bit - we'll do all that; you keep all your breath and
strength for the Slogger.&quot;  Martin meanwhile folded the clothes,
and put them under the chapel rails; and now Tom, with East to
handle him, and Martin to give him a knee, steps out on the
turf, and is ready for all that may come; and here is the
Slogger too, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray.</P>
<P>It doesn't look a fair match at first glance:  Williams is nearly
two inches taller, and probably a long year older than his
opponent, and he is very strongly made about the arms and
shoulders - &quot;peels well,&quot; as the little knot of big fifth-form
boys, the amateurs, say, who stand outside the ring of little
boys, looking complacently on, but taking no active part in the
proceedings.  But down below he is not so good by any means - no
spring from the loins, and feeblish, not to say shipwrecky,
about the knees.  Tom, on the contrary, though not half so
strong in the arms, is good all over, straight, hard, and
springy, from neck to ankle, better perhaps in his legs than
anywhere.  Besides, you can see by the clear white of his eye,
and fresh, bright look of his skin, that he is in tip-top
training, able to do all he knows; while the Slogger looks
rather sodden, as if he didn't take much exercise and ate too
much tuck.  The time-keeper is chosen, a large ring made, and
the two stand up opposite one another for a moment, giving us
time just to make our little observations.</P>
<P>&quot;If Tom'll only condescend to fight with his head and heels,&quot; as
East mutters to Martin, &quot;we shall do.&quot;</P>
<P>But seemingly he won't, for there he goes in, making play with
both hands.  Hard all is the word; the two stand to one another
like men; rally follows rally in quick succession, each fighting
as if he thought to finish the whole thing out of hand.  &quot;Can't
last at this rate,&quot; say the knowing ones, while the partisans of
each make the air ring with their shouts and counter-shouts of
encouragement, approval, and defiance.</P>
<P>&quot;Take it easy, take it easy; keep away; let him come after you,&quot;
implores East, as he wipes Tom's face after the first round with
a wet sponge, while he sits back on Martin's knee, supported by
the Madman's long arms which tremble a little from excitement.</P>
<P>&quot;Time's up,&quot; calls the time-keeper.</P>
<P>&quot;There he goes again, hang it all!&quot; growls East, as his man is
at it again, as hard as ever.  A very severe round follows, in
which Tom gets out and out the worst of it, and is at last hit
clean off his legs, and deposited on the grass by a right-hander
from the Slogger.</P>
<P>Loud shouts rise from the boys of Slogger's house, and the
School-house are silent and vicious, ready to pick quarrels
anywhere.</P>
<P>&quot;Two to one in half-crowns on the big un,&quot; says Rattle, one of
the amateurs, a tall fellow, in thunder-and-lightning waistcoat,
and puffy, good-natured face.</P>
<P>&quot;Done!&quot; says Groove, another amateur of quieter look, taking out
his notebook to enter it, for our friend Rattle sometimes
forgets these little things.</P>
<P>Meantime East is freshening up Tom with the sponges for next
round, and has set two other boys to rub his hands.</P>
<P>&quot;Tom, old boy,&quot; whispers he, &quot;this may be fun for you, but it's
death to me.  He'll hit all the fight out of you in another five
minutes, and then I shall go and drown myself in the island
ditch.  Feint him; use your legs; draw him about.  He'll lose
his wind then in no time, and you can go into him.  Hit at his
body too; we'll take care of his frontispiece by-and-by.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel, and saw already that he
couldn't go in and finish the Slogger off at mere hammer and
tongs, so changed his tactics completely in the third round.  He
now fights cautiously, getting away from and parrying the
Slogger's lunging hits, instead of trying to counter, and
leading his enemy a dance all round the ring after him.  &quot;He's
funking; go in, Williams,&quot; &quot;Catch him up,&quot; &quot;Finish him off,&quot;
scream the small boys of the Slogger party.</P>
<P>&quot;Just what we want,&quot; thinks East, chuckling to himself, as he
sees Williams, excited by these shouts, and thinking the game in
his own hands, blowing himself in his exertions to get to close
quarters again, while Tom is keeping away with perfect ease.</P>
<P>They quarter over the ground again and again, Tom always on the
defensive.</P>
<P>The Slogger pulls up at last for a moment, fairly blown.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, then, Tom,&quot; sings out East, dancing with delight.  Tom
goes in in a twinkling, and hits two heavy body blows, and gets
away again before the Slogger can catch his wind, which when he
does he rushes with blind fury at Tom, and being skilfully
parried and avoided, overreaches himself and falls on his face,
amidst terrific cheers from the School-house boys.</P>
<P>&quot;Double your two to one?&quot; says Groove to Rattle, notebook in
hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Stop a bit,&quot; says that hero, looking uncomfortably at Williams,
who is puffing away on his second's knee, winded enough, but
little the worse in any other way.</P>
<P>After another round the Slogger too seems to see that he can't
go in and win right off, and has met his match or thereabouts.
So he too begins to use his head, and tries to make Tom lose his
patience, and come in before his time.  And so the fight sways
on, now one and now the other getting a trifling pull.</P>
<P>Tom's face begins to look very one-sided - there are little
queer bumps on his forehead, and his mouth is bleeding; but East
keeps the wet sponge going so scientifically that he comes up
looking as fresh and bright as ever.  Williams is only slightly
marked in the face, but by the nervous movement of his elbows
you can see that Tom's body blows are telling.  In fact, half
the vice of the Slogger's hitting is neutralized, for he daren't
lunge out freely for fear of exposing his sides.  It is too
interesting by this time for much shouting, and the whole ring
is very quiet.</P>
<P>&quot;All right, Tommy,&quot; whispers East; &quot;hold on's the horse that's
to win.  We've got the last.  Keep your head, old boy.&quot;</P>
<P>But where is Arthur all this time?  Words cannot paint the poor
little fellow's distress.  He couldn't muster courage to come up
to the ring, but wandered up and down from the great fives court
to the corner of the chapel rails, now trying to make up his
mind to throw himself between them, and try to stop them; then
thinking of running in and telling his friend Mary, who, he
knew, would instantly report to the Doctor.  The stories he had
heard of men being killed in prize-fights rose up horribly
before him.</P>
<P>Once only, when the shouts of &quot;Well done, Brown!&quot; &quot;Huzza for the
School-house!&quot; rose higher than ever, he ventured up to the
ring, thinking the victory was won.  Catching sight of Tom's
face in the state I have described, all fear of consequences
vanishing out of his mind; he rushed straight off to the
matron's room, beseeching her to get the fight stopped, or he
should die.</P>
<P>But it's time for us to get back to the close.  What is this
fierce tumult and confusion?  The ring is broken, and high and
angry words are being bandied about.  &quot;It's all fair&quot; - &quot;It
isn't&quot; - &quot;No hugging!&quot;  The fight is stopped.  The combatants,
however, sit there quietly, tended by their seconds, while their
adherents wrangle in the middle.  East can't help shouting
challenges to two or three of the other side, though he never
leaves Tom for a moment, and plies the sponges as fast as ever.</P>
<P>The fact is, that at the end of the last round, Tom, seeing a
good opening, had closed with his opponent, and after a moment's
struggle, had thrown him heavily, by help of the fall he had
learnt from his village rival in the Vale of White Horse.
Williams hadn't the ghost of a chance with Tom at wrestling; and
the conviction broke at once on the Slogger faction that if this
were allowed their man must be licked.  There was a strong
feeling in the School against catching hold and throwing, though
it was generally ruled all fair within limits; so the ring was
broken and the fight stopped.</P>
<P>The School-house are overruled - the fight is on again, but
there is to be no throwing; and East, in high wrath, threatens
to take his man away after next round (which he don't mean to
do, by the way), when suddenly young Brooke comes through the
small gate at the end of the chapel.  The School-house faction
rush to him.  &quot;Oh, hurrah! now we shall get fair play.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please, Brooke, come up.  They won't let Tom Brown throw him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Throw whom?&quot; says Brooke, coming up to the ring.  &quot;Oh!
Williams, I see.  Nonsense!  Of course he may throw him, if he
catches him fairly above the waist.&quot;</P>
<P>Now, young Brooke, you're in the sixth, you know, and you ought
to stop all fights.  He looks hard at both boys.  &quot;Anything
wrong?&quot; says he to East, nodding at Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Not a bit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not beat at all?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bless you, no!  Heaps of fight in him.  - Ain't there, Tom?&quot;</P>
<P>Tom looks at Brooke and grins.</P>
<P>&quot;How's he?&quot; nodding at Williams.</P>
<P>&quot;So so; rather done, I think, since his last fall.  He won't
stand above two more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Time's up!&quot;  The boys rise again and face one another.  Brooke
can't find it in his heart to stop them just yet, so the round
goes on, the Slogger waiting for Tom, and reserving all his
strength to hit him out should he come in for the wrestling
dodge again, for he feels that that must be stopped, or his
sponge will soon go up in the air.</P>
<P>And now another newcomer appears on the field, to wit, the
under-porter, with his long brush and great wooden receptacle
for dust under his arm.  He has been sweeping out the schools.</P>
<P>&quot;You'd better stop, gentlemen,&quot; he says; &quot;the Doctor knows that
Brown's fighting - he'll be out in a minute.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You go to Bath, Bill,&quot; is all that that excellent servitor gets
by his advice; and being a man of his hands, and a stanch
upholder of the School-house, can't help stopping to look on for
a bit, and see Tom Brown, their pet craftsman, fight a round.</P>
<P>It is grim earnest now, and no mistake.  Both boys feel this,
and summon every power of head, hand, and eye to their aid.  A
piece of luck on either side, a foot slipping, a blow getting
well home, or another fall, may decide it.  Tom works slowly
round for an opening; he has all the legs, and can choose his
own time.  The Slogger waits for the attack, and hopes to finish
it by some heavy right-handed blow.  As they quarter slowly over
the ground, the evening sun comes out from behind a cloud and
falls full on Williams's face.  Tom darts in; the heavy right
hand is delivered, but only grazes his head.  A short rally at
close quarters, and they close; in another moment the Slogger is
thrown again heavily for the third time.</P>
<P>&quot;I'll give you three or two on the little one in half-crowns,&quot;
said Groove to Rattle.</P>
<P>&quot;No, thank 'ee,&quot; answers the other, diving his hands farther
into his coat-tails.</P>
<P>Just at this stage of the proceedings, the door of the turret
which leads to the Doctor's library suddenly opens, and he steps
into the close, and makes straight for the ring, in which Brown
and the Slogger are both seated on their seconds' knees for the
last time.</P>
<P>&quot;The Doctor! the Doctor!&quot; shouts some small boy who catches
sight of him, and the ring melts away in a few seconds, the
small boys tearing off, Tom collaring his jacket and waistcoat,
and slipping through the little gate by the chapel, and round
the corner to Harrowell's with his backers, as lively as need
be; Williams and his backers making off not quite so fast across
the close; Groove, Rattle, and the other bigger fellows trying
to combine dignity and prudence in a comical manner, and walking
off fast enough, they hope, not to be recognized, and not fast
enough to look like running away.</P>
<P>Young Brooke alone remains on the ground by the time the Doctor
gets there, and touches his hat, not without a slight inward
qualm.</P>
<P>&quot;Hah!  Brooke.  I am surprised to see you here.  Don't you know
that I expect the sixth to stop fighting?&quot;</P>
<P>Brooke felt much more uncomfortable than he had expected, but he
was rather a favourite with the Doctor for his openness and
plainness of speech, so blurted out, as he walked by the
Doctor's side, who had already turned back, -</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir, generally.  But I thought you wished us to exercise a
discretion in the matter too - not to interfere too soon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But they have been fighting this half-hour and more,&quot; said the
Doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir; but neither was hurt.  And they're the sort of boys
who'll be all the better friends now, which they wouldn't have
been if they had been stopped, any earlier - before it was so
equal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who was fighting with Brown?&quot; said the Doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;Williams, sir, of Thompson's.  He is bigger than Brown, and had
the best of it at first, but not when you came up, sir.  There's
a good deal of jealousy between our house and Thompson's, and
there would have been more fights if this hadn't been let go on,
or if either of them had had much the worst of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well but, Brooke,&quot; said the Doctor, &quot;doesn't this look a little
as if you exercised your discretion by only stopping a fight
when the School-house boy is getting the worst of it?&quot;</P>
<P>Brooke, it must be confessed, felt rather gravelled.</P>
<P>&quot;Now remember,&quot; added the Doctor, as he stopped at the turret-
door, &quot;this fight is not to go on; you'll see to that.  And I
expect you to stop all fights in future at once.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, sir,&quot; said young Brooke, touching his hat, and not
sorry to see the turret-door close behind the Doctor's back.</P>
<P>Meantime Tom and the stanchest of his adherents had reached
Harrowell's, and Sally was bustling about to get them a late
tea, while Stumps had been sent off to Tew, the butcher, to get
a piece of raw beef for Tom's eye, which was to be healed off-
hand, so that he might show well in the morning.  He was not a
bit the worse, except a slight difficulty in his vision, a
singing in his ears, and a sprained thumb, which he kept in a
cold-water bandage, while he drank lots of tea, and listened to
the babel of voices talking and speculating of nothing but the
fight, and how Williams would have given in after another fall
(which he didn't in the least believe), and how on earth the
Doctor could have got to know of it - such bad luck!  He
couldn't help thinking to himself that he was glad he hadn't
won; he liked it better as it was, and felt very friendly to the
Slogger.  And then poor little Arthur crept in and sat down
quietly near him, and kept looking at him and the raw beef with
such plaintive looks that Tom at last burst out laughing.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't make such eyes, young un,&quot; said he; &quot;there's nothing the
matter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, but, Tom, are you much hurt?  I can't bear thinking it was
all for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not a bit of it; don't flatter yourself.  We were sure to have
had it out sooner or later.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but you won't go on, will you?  You'll promise me you
won't go on?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can't tell about that - all depends on the houses.  We're in
the hands of our countrymen, you know.  Must fight for the
School-house flag, if so be.&quot;</P>
<P>However, the lovers of the science were doomed to disappointment
this time.  Directly after locking-up, one of the night-fags
knocked at Tom's door.</P>
<P>&quot;Brown, young Brooke wants you in the sixth-form room.&quot;</P>
<P>Up went Tom to the summons, and found the magnates sitting at
their supper.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Brown,&quot; said young Brooke, nodding to him , &quot;how do you
feel?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, very well, thank you, only I've sprained my thumb, I
think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sure to do that in a fight.  Well, you hadn't the worst of it,
I could see.  Where did you learn that throw?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Down in the country when I was a boy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo! why, what are you now?  Well, never mind, you're a
plucky fellow.  Sit down and have some supper.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom obeyed, by no means loath.  And the fifth-form boy next
filled him a tumbler of bottled beer, and he ate and drank,
listening to the pleasant talk, and wondering how soon he should
be in the fifth, and one of that much-envied society.</P>
<P>As he got up to leave, Brooke said, &quot;You must shake hands to-
morrow morning; I shall come and see that done after first
lesson.&quot;</P>
<P>And so he did.  And Tom and the Slogger shook hands with great
satisfaction and mutual respect.  And for the next year or two,
whenever fights were being talked of, the small boys who had
been present shook their heads wisely, saying, &quot;Ah! but you
should just have seen the fight between Slogger Williams and Tom
Brown!&quot;</P>
<P>And now, boys all, three words before we quit the subject.  I
have put in this chapter on fighting of malice prepense, partly
because I want to give you a true picture of what everyday
school life was in my time, and not a kid-glove and go-to-
meeting-coat picture, and partly because of the cant and twaddle
that's talked of boxing and fighting with fists nowadays.  Even
Thackeray has given in to it; and only a few weeks ago there was
some rampant stuff in the Times on the subject, in an article on
field sports.</P>
<P>Boys will quarrel, and when they quarrel will sometimes fight.
Fighting with fists is the natural and English way for English
boys to settle their quarrels.  What substitute for it is there,
or ever was there, amongst any nation under the sun?  What would
you like to see take its place?</P>
<P>Learn to box, then, as you learn to play cricket and football.
Not one of you will be the worse, but very much the better, for
learning to box well.  Should you never have to use it in
earnest, there's no exercise in the world so good for the temper
and for the muscles of the back and legs.</P>
<P>As to fighting, keep out of it if you can, by all means.  When
the time comes, if it ever should, that you have to say &quot;Yes&quot; or
&quot;No&quot; to a challenge to fight, say &quot;No&quot; if you can - only take
care you make it clear to yourselves why you say &quot;No.&quot;  It's a
proof of the highest courage, if done from true Christian
motives.  It's quite right and justifiable, if done from a
simple aversion to physical pain and danger.  But don't say &quot;No&quot;
because you fear a licking, and say or think it's because you
fear God, for that's neither Christian nor honest.  And if you
do fight, fight it out; and don't give in while you can stand
and see.</P>
