<p><em>NOW </em>in reading the last chapter one would immediately
think that M. Longuet had gone mad. What had possessed him? Where
did he go? In order that you might fully understand his peculiar
actions I will give you the extract from his memoirs relating
to this incident. He writes:</p>

<p>I am a man of sound body and mind. I am a good citizen and recognize
all the laws. I believe laws are necessary for the proper regulation
of society. I dislike heartily any formalities, and in determining
my lines of conduct I have always chosen the simplest way.</p>

<p>I dislike imaginative people, and the occult has always been
repulsive to me. However, this is not through want of understanding,
for my friend, Adolphe Lecamus, had given himself up to the study
of spiritualism. Whoever teaches spiritualism teaches foolishness,
and the desire to question the spirits of the dead by means of
the planchette seems to me to be beyond belief, it is grotesque.
However, I have assisted at some of Adolphe’s seances which he
had given for the benefit of Marceline and myself. I have even
taken a certain part in them, desiring to prove the absurdity
of his theories. My wife and I once rested our hands on a table
for a quarter of an hour waiting for it to move. Nothing happened,
and we laughed heartily at him. However, my wife was more sympathetic,
and was inclined to be a little more serious. Women are always
more susceptible to the occult and ready to believe in the mysterious.
Adolphe bought her books, which she read eagerly, and he amused
himself sometimes by willing her to sleep, by making passes with
his hands and breathing on her eyes. It seemed foolish, and I
should not have allowed it from any one else, but I have always
had a liking for Adolphe, and know that it amuses him. Marceline
and he said that I was a skeptic. However, I am not a skeptic,
as a skeptic is one who doubts all. I believe in progress, but
do not believe that one person having an unnatural influence over
another tends towards progress. Therefore I am not a skeptic,
but rather a philosopher.</p>

<p>During his travels Adolphe read a great deal. I have had to work
hard all my life, therefore, while he is an idealist, I am a materialist.</p>

<p>It seems necessary for me to thus describe my character so that
it may be well understood that the happenings of the day before
yesterday were not due to any occult reasons. I visited the prison
in just the same manner as I would go to a store to buy a cravat.
I wanted to learn, that is all. Having sold my business, I have
more leisure, and so I said to myself: "I will visit the interesting
places of the city of Paris." Fate decreed that the Conciergerie
was the first place to be visited. I do not know whether I really
regret it.</p>

<p>At present I am calm and collected and can relate all I remember
of what happened.</p>

<p>While we were in the Towers nothing happened worth recording.
I remember trying to picture to myself in the little room which
looked like a grocery store all the horrors of the place, how
the executioners and their assistants approached the prisoners
with their monstrous machines, how so many illustrious persons
were martyred, and all the terrible griefs and agonies which had
been witnessed within these walls. But the transformation had
taken all the romance away, and the labels, "Senna," "Hops," etc.,
did not inspire imagination. Even the Bon Bee Tower, also called
Bavarde, on account of the terrible cries which were heard in
it, has been changed into offices. However, I must not complain.
These are all the signs of progress and a more enlightened age.</p>

<p>But we penetrated into that part of the Conciergerie which has
changed little during all these centuries, which had not been
spoiled by the plasterer and in which all the stones could tell
their own history; then it was that a most inexplicable fever
took possession of me, and when we had reached the dark end of
the walk of the "Straw Dealers," I cried out from my soul, "Zounds!
this is the walk of the Straw Dealers."</p>

<p>I turned around immediately to find out who had uttered these
words. They were all staring at me, and I was convinced that it
was myself who had cried out. It seemed so strange. The voice
was not like mine, but it had emanated from me. Even now it is
unaccountable.</p>

<p>The Warden pretended that we had passed the walk of the "Straw
Dealers." I told him that I knew the place better than he, for
I had lain there on the straw myself. But I had never been in
the Conciergerie before, and yet I was sure of it. It is difficult
to explain. While we walked through the chapel of the Girondists,
and the Warden was explaining the story to us, I played with my
umbrella. I tried to appear natural and collected. Although the
things which happened were quite natural, and not the result of
any effort, a cold perspiration seized me and I shook like a leaf.
I remember that I found myself at the bottom of the stairs, standing
before a grating. I was endowed with almost superhuman strength.
Shaking the grating, I called out for the others to follow. However,
the others had gone ahead and did not hear. I called to the Warden
to open the grating. I don’t know what would have happened if
he had not done so, quickly. I was crazy, and yet everything was
natural to me. Truly, I was in a state of great nervous excitement,
but everything was lucid to me. Never before had I seen so clearly
as when in that dark cellar. Never before had I recognized a place
so vividly as when I was down there where I had never been before.
My God! I did not know them, and yet I recognized them.</p>

<p>Without hesitating I groped around, feeling the stones in the
dark, and my feet trod a soil which seemed familiar but which
had not been trodden for centuries. I seemed to know these very
stones, forgotten in the darkness of those cellars. I slid the
length of the damp flagstones as if I had been accustomed to the
way. My finger-nails came in contact with sharp stones in the
wall and I counted the seams as I passed. I knew that if I turned
round I would see a certain square light in the distant gallery,
a single ray in all this place where the sun had forgotten to
shine since France’s history had begun. I turned and saw it, and
I felt my heart beat violently.</p>

<p>Here there was a momentary interruption in the writings. M. Longuet,
having explained what had happened to him in that strange hour
in the Conciergerie, was greatly agitated. It was with difficulty
he remained master of his thoughts. It was difficult to follow
them; they seemed to come and go, just leaving faint traces on
the paper of the record.</p>

<p>He resumed the pen with feverish hand. Continuing to busy himself
with the subterranean passages, he writes:</p>

<p>It is necessary to pause here as one pauses at the edge of a
precipice. My very thoughts make me shiver!...</p>

<p>And the Bavarde, there it stands. There are the walls which have
helped to make history. It is not on high in the glorious sunlight
that the Bavarde tells its history. It is here in the blackness
of the earth. There are some large iron staples in the wall here.
The very chains of Ravaillac! I recall no more; but towards that
ray, the sole ray of light, as eternal and immovable as the very
walls— towards that small square beam, which since the beginning
of things has taken and kept the shape of a sentinel, I advanced.
There was some impelling force which urged me on. I rushed ahead
while the fever was in me and seemed to intoxicate me. Suddenly
I paused, my feet seemed held to the ground and my fingers ran
sliding and pressing the length of the wall. What it was that
impelled my finger, what was the thought, I cannot tell. All at
once I let my umbrella fall, and drawing my pen-knife, began to
scrape steadily between two stones. The dust and cement powdered
away easily, and soon my knife struck something between the stones,
and I pulled the thing out.</p>

<p>This is why I am sure I was not mad. This thing has been before
my eyes. In my most peaceful hours I, Théophraste Longuet, see
it in my writing-desk. It is not I who am mad, but this thing
itself! It is a piece of torn paper, stained. . . a document of
which it is easy to tell the age and calculated to plunge any
man into the deepest consternation.</p>

<p>The paper is, as you must know, terribly decayed. The dampness
has eaten into half the words, which seem, on account of their
reddish tint, to have been written with blood.</p>

<p>I took the document to the small ray of light, and on looking
it over my hair seemed to stand on end with horror. <em>There
I could recognize my own handwriting</em>, and I give you this
precious and mysterious document clearly translated:</p>

<p>"Dead and buried all his treasures after the Treachery of April
1st. Go, take a look in the barroom! Look at the furnace! Look
at the weathercock! Dig a while and you shall be rich!"</p>
