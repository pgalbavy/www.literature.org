<p>And the Sabbath quiet which had descended on the frost-jeweled city
the morning after the hunt found the Buchanan household still deep in
close-shuttered sleep. Their fatigue demanded and was having its way in
the processes of recuperation and they all slept on serenely.
</p><p>Only Caroline Darrah was astir with the first deep notes of the early
morning bells. Her awaking had come with a rush of pure, bubbling,
unalloyed joy which turned her cheeks the hue of the rose, starred her
eyes and melted her lips into heavenly curves. In her exquisite innocence
it never dawned upon her that the moments spent in Andrew's arms under
the winter moon were any but those of rapturous betrothal and her love
had flowered in confident happiness. It was well that she caught across
the distance no hint of the battle that was being waged in the heart of
Andrew Sevier, for the man in him fought (for her) with what he deemed
his honor, almost to the death--but not quite, for some men hold as honor
that which is strong sinewed with self-control, red blooded with courage,
infiltrated with pride and ruthlessly cruel.
</p><p>And so Caroline hummed David's little serenade to herself as she dressed
without Annette's assistance and smiled at her own radiance reflected at
her from her mirrors. She had just completed a most ravishing church
toilet when she heard the major's door close softly and she knew that now
she would find him before his logs awaiting breakfast.
</p><p>She blushed another tone more rosy and her eyes grew shy at the very
thought of meeting his keen eyes that always quizzed her with such
delight after one of her initiations into the sports or gaieties of this
new country. But assuming her courage with her prayer-book, she softly
descended the stairs, crossed the hall and stood beside his chair with a
laugh of greeting.
</p><p>"Well," he demanded delightedly though in a guarded tone with a glance
up as if at Mrs. Matilda's and Phoebe's closed doors, "did you catch your
possum?"
</p><p>"Yes--that is--no! I didn't, but somebody did I think," she answered with
delicious confusion in both tone and appearance.
</p><p>"Caroline Darrah," demanded the major, "do you mean to tell me that there
is no certainty of anybody's having got a result from a foray of the
magnitude of that last night? Didn't you even see a possum?"
</p><p>"No, I didn't; but I know they caught some--David said so," answered
Caroline in a reassuring voice.
</p><p>"Caroline," again demanded the major relentlessly, having already had his
suspicions aroused by her confusion and blushes, "where were you when
David Kildare caught those beasts that you didn't see one?"
</p><p>"I was--was lost," she answered, and it surprised him that she didn't put
one rosy finger-tip into her mouth, so very young was her further
confusion.
</p><p>"Alone?" The major made his demand without mercy.
</p><p>"No, sir, with Mr. Sevier--why, aren't you going to have breakfast,
Major, it is almost church time?" and Caroline rallied her domestic
dignity to her support as she escaped toward Temple's domain.
</p><p>And the flush of joy that had flamed in her cheeks had lighted a glow in
the major's weather-tanned old face and his eyes fairly snapped with
light. Could it be that the boy had reached out for his atonement? Could
it be--he heard the front door close as the first church bell struck a
deep note and at that moment Jeff announced his breakfast as ready in a
voice of the deepest exhaustion.
</p><p>And when Caroline emerged from the still darkened house into the crisp
air she found Andrew Sevier standing on the front steps waiting to walk
into church with her.
</p><p>Her smile of shy joy as she held out her hand to him warmed his somber
eyes for the moment.
</p><p>"They are all asleep," she whispered as if even from the street there was
danger of awakening the tired hunting party. "The major is keeping it
quiet for them."
</p><p>"And you ought to be asleep, too," he answered as they started off at a
brisk pace down the avenue.
</p><p>"<u>You</u> weren't," she laughed up at him, and then dropped her eyes shyly.
"I always go to church," she added demurely.
</p><p>"And I suppose I counted on your habit," he said, utterly unable to
control the tenderness in voice or glance.
</p><p>"I wanted you to go with me to-day--I hoped you would though you never
have," she answered him with a divine seriousness in her lifted eyes.
"They are all coming to dinner and then you'll go to the office, so I
hoped about this morning." She was utterly lovely in her gentleness
and a strange peace fell into the troubled heart of the man at her side.
</p><p>And it followed him into the dim church and made the hour he sat at her
side one of holy healing. Once as they knelt together during the service
she slipped her gloved hand into his for an instant and from its warmth
there flowed a strength of which he stood in dire need and from which he
drew courage to go on for the few days remaining before his exile. Just
to protect her, he prayed, and leave her unhurt, and he failed to see
that the humility and blindness of a great love were leading him into the
perpetration of a great cruelty, to the undoing of them both.
</p><p>Then in the long days that followed so hunted was he by his love of her
that that one hour of peace in the Sunday morning was all he dared give
himself with her. And in her gentle trustfulness it was not hard to make
his excuses, for the Monday morning brought the strenuosity in
the career of David Kildare to a state of absolute acuteness.
</p><p>To the candidate the three days were as ten years crowded into as many
hours. Down at his headquarters in the <u>Gray Picket</u> rooms he stood firm
and met wave after wave of fluctuating excitement that surged around him
with his head up, a ring in his laugh and an almost superhuman tact.
</p><p>As late as Wednesday noon there appeared before him three excited
Anti-Saloon League matrons with plans to put committees of ladies at all
the polls to hand out lemonade and entreaties--perhaps threats--to the
voters as they exercised their civic function. They had planned banners
with "Shall The Saloon Have My Boy?" in large letters thereon inscribed
and they were morally certain that without the carrying out of their plan
the day would be lost. It took David Kildare one hour and a quarter to
persuade them that it would be better to have a temperance rally at the
theater on Wednesday night at which each of the three should make most
convincing speeches to the assembled women of the city, thereby
furnishing arguments to their sisters with which to start the men to the
polls next day.
</p><p>He promised to come and make a short opening speech and they left him
with their plans changed but their enthusiasm augmented. David sank into
a chair and mopped his shining brow. The major had been witness to the
encounter from the editorial desk and Cap Cantrell was bent double with
laughter behind a pile of papers he was searching for data for Andrew.
</p><p>"I'm all in, Major," said David faintly. "Just pick up the pieces in a
basket."
</p><p>"David, sir," said the major, "your conduct of that onslaught was
masterly! If the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world why not the
hand that flips the batter-cake rock the ballot-box--cradle out of date?
That's a little mixed but pertinent. I'm for letting them have the
try. They're only crying because they think we don't want 'em to have
it--maybe they'll go back to the cradle and rock all the better for being
free citizens!"
</p><p>"And not a cussed one of those three old lady cats has ever shown a
kitten!" exploded Cap from behind his pile of papers.
</p><p>"Anyway, the worst is over now--must be!" answered David as he began to
read over some bulletins and telegrams. But he had troubles yet to come.
In the next two hours he had a conference with the head of the chamber of
commerce which heated his blood to the boiling-point and brought forth an
ultimatum, delivered in no uncertain terms but with such perfect courtesy
and clean-sightedness that the gentleman departed in haste to look into
certain matters which he now suspected to have been cooked to lead him
astray.
</p><p>This event had been followed by the advent of five of the old fellows who
had obtained furloughs and ridden in from the Soldiers' Home for the
express purpose of assuring him of their support, as the vindicator of
their honor, wringing his hand and cheering on the fight. They retired
with Cap into the back room and emerged shortly, beaming and refreshed.
They had no votes to cast in the city, but what matter?
</p><p>On their heels, Mike O'Rourke rushed in with two budgets of false
registrations which he had been able to ferret out by the aid of the
drivers of his grocery wagons. He embraced David, exchanged shots with
the major, and departed in high spirits. Then quiet came to the <u>Gray
Picket</u> for a time and Kildare plunged into his papers with desperation.
</p><p>"David," called the major after a very few minutes of peace, "here's a
call for you on the desk. You'll recognize the number--remember, a firm
hand, sir--a firm hand!" with which he collected his hat, coat, and the
captain and took his departure, leaving David for the moment alone in the
editorial rooms.
</p><p>He sat for a few moments before the receiver and twisted the call slip
around one of his fingers. In a moment the affairs of state and the
destiny of the city slipped from his shoulders and his mind took up the
details of another problem.
</p><p>The contest for the judgeship was not the only one David Kildare had
taken upon himself--the second was being waged in the secret chambers of
two hearts, one proud, exacting and unconvinced, the other determined and
at last thoroughly aroused. Phoebe had brought the crisis on herself and
she was beginning to realize that the duel would be to the death or
complete surrender.
</p><p>And in the preliminaries, which had been begun on the Saturday night hunt
and carried on for the last three days, David Kildare had failed to make
a single false move. His natural and inevitable absorption in his race
for the judgeship had served to keep him from forcing a single issue; and
Phoebe had had time to do a little lonely, unpursued thinking.
</p><p>He had been entirely too clever to arouse her pride against him by a
suspicion of neglect in his attitude. His usual attentions were all
offered and a new one or two contrived. He sent Eph to report to her with
his electric every afternoon--she understood that he was unable by the
exigencies of the case to come himself to take her to keep her
appointments as was his custom. Her flowers were just as thoughtfully
selected and sent with the gayest little notes, as like as possible to
the ones that had been coming to her for years. He ordered in an
unusually large basket of eggs from the farm and managed to find a
complicated arrangement of rope and pulleys, the manipulation of which
for an hour or more daily was warranted to add to or detract from the
stature of man or woman, according to the desire of the dissatisfied
individual. His note with the instrument was a scintillating skit and was
answered in kind. But through it all Phoebe was undoubtedly lonely. This
call, the second since Saturday and the second in the history of their
joint existences, betrayed her to the now wily David more than she
realized--perhaps!
</p><p>He took down the receiver and got the connection.
</p><p>"That you--dear?" David managed a casual voice with difficulty.
</p><p>"Yes, David," came in a voice that fairly radiated across the city. "I
only wanted to ask how it goes."
</p><p>"Fine--with a rip! But you never can tell--about anything. I'm a
Presbyterian and I'll die in doubt of my election. I'm learning not to
count on--things." His voice carried a mournful note that utterly belied
his radiant face. David was enjoying himself to almost the mortal limit!
</p><p>"David," there was a perceptible pause--"you--there is one thing you can
always count on--isn't there--<u>me</u>?" The voice was very gallant but also
slightly palpitating. David almost lost his head but hung on tight and
came up right side.
</p><p>"Some," he answered, which reply, in the light of an extremely modern use
of the word combined with the legitimate, was calculated to bring
conclusion. Then he hurried another offering on to the wire.
</p><p>"How long are you going to be at home?" he asked--another dastardly
tantalization.
</p><p>"I--I don't know exactly," she parried quickly. "Why?" and this from
Phoebe who had always granted interviews like a queen gives jewels! David
somewhere found the courage to lay a firm hand on himself. With just a
few more blows the citadel was his! His own heart writhed and the
uncertainty made him quake internally.
</p><p>"I wish I could come over, but there are two committees waiting in the
other room for me. Do you--" a clash and buzz hummed over the wire into
the receiver. There was a jangle and tangle and a rough man's voice cut
in with, "Working on the wires, hang up, please," and David limply hung
up the receiver and collapsed in solitude, for his committees had been
evoked out of thin air.
</p><p>His state of mind was positively abject. His years-old tenderness welled
up in his heart and flooded to his eyes--the dash and the pluck of her!
He reached for his hat, then hesitated; it was election eve and in two
hours he was due to address the congregation of griddle-cake discontents
on how to make men vote like ladies.
</p><p>A call boy hurried in by way of a fortunate distraction and handed in a
budget of papers. David spread them out before him. They were from Susie
Carrie of the strong brush and the Civic Improvement League, containing
Sketches and specifications for the drinking fountains already pledged,
and a request for an early institution of legislation on the play-ground
proposition. Such a small thing as an uncertain election failed to
daunt the artistic fervor of Susie Carrie's fertile brain or to deter her
from making demands, however premature, on David the sympathetic.
</p><p>And David Kildare dropped his head on the papers and groaned. The
Vision of a life-work rose up and menaced him and the words "sweat of his
brow" for the first time took on a concrete meaning. Such a good, old,
care-free existence he was losing, and--he seized his hat and fled
to the refreshment of bath, food and fresh raiment.
</p><p>And on his way home he stopped in for a word with the major, whom he
found tired and on his way to take as much as he could of his usual nap.
He was seated in his chair by the table and Caroline Darrah sat near him,
listening eagerly to his story of some of the events in the day's
campaign. She rose as David entered and held out her hand to him with a
smile.
</p><p>Every time David had looked at Caroline Darrah for the few days past a
sharp pain had cut into his heart and this afternoon she was so radiantly
lovely with sympathy and interest that for a moment he stood looking at
her with his eyes full of tenderness. Then he managed a bantering smile
and backed away a step or two from her, his hands behind him.
</p><p>"No, you don't, beautiful," David sometimes ventured on Phoebe's name for
the girl, "you are so sweet in that frock that I'm afraid if I touch you
I'll stick. Somebody ought to label such a lollypop as you dangerous.
Call her off, Major!"
</p><p>The major laughed at Caroline's blush and laid his fingers over her hand
that rested on the corner of the table near him.
</p><p>"David," he said, "girls are confections to which it is good for a man to
forsake all others and cling--but not to gobble. Matilda, recount to
David Kildare your plans for the night of the election. I wish to witness
his joy."
</p><p>"Oh, yes, I've been wanting to tell you about it for two days, David,
dear," answered Mrs. Buchanan from her chair over by the window where she
was busily engaged in checking names off a long list with a pencil. "We
are going to have a reception at the University Club so everybody can
come and congratulate you the night of the election. Mrs. Shelby and I
thought it up and of course we had to speak to one of the house committee
about the arrangements, and who do you think the member was--Billy Bob! I
just talked on and didn't notice Mrs. Shelby and finally he was so nice
and deferential to her that she talked some, too. She almost started to
shake hands with him when we left. I was so glad. I feel that it is
going to be a delightful success in every way. Please be thinking up a
nice speech to make."
</p><p>"Oh, wait," groaned David Kildare, "if I begin now I will have to think
double, one for election and one for defeat. Last night I dreamed about a
black cat that was minus a left eye and limped in the right hind leg.
Jeff almost cried when I told him about it. He hasn't smiled since."
</p><p>"I told Tempie to put less pepper in those chicken croquettes last
night--I saw Phoebe's light burning until two o'clock and heard her and
Caroline laughing and talking even after that. The major was so nervous
that he was up and dressed at six o'clock. I must see that all of you get
simpler food--your nerves will suffer. Major, suppose you don't eat
much dinner--just have a little milk toast. I'll see Tempie about it
now!" and Mrs. Buchanan departed after bestowing a glance, in which was a
conviction of dyspepsia, upon all three of them.
</p><p>"Now, David Kildare, see what you've done with your black-cat crawlings!
I'll have to eat that toast--see if I don't! I've consumed it with a
smile during stated periods for thirty years. Yes, girl-love is a kind
of cup-custard, but wife-love is bread and butter--milk toast, for
instance--bless her! But I am hungry!" The major's expression was a
tragedy.
</p><p>"I'm going to try and beg you off, Major, dear," said Caroline Darrah,
and she hurried after Mrs. Matilda into Tempie's domain.
</p><p>"Major," said David as he gazed after the girl, "when I look at her I
feel cold all over, then hot-mad! He's going to-morrow night on the
midnight train--and she doesn't know! I can't even talk to him
about it--he looks like a dead man and works like a demon. I don't know
what to do!"
</p><p>"David," said the major slowly as he pressed the tips of his long lean
fingers together and regarded them intently, "how love, tender wise love,
love that is fed on heart's blood and lives by soul-breath, can go deaf,
blind, dumb, halt, broken-winged, idiotic and mortally cruel is more than
I can see. God Almighty comfort him when he finds what he has done!"
</p><p>"And if she does find it out she won't understand," exclaimed David.
</p><p>"No," answered the major, "she doesn't even suspect anything. She thinks
it is the press of his work that keeps him away from her. The child
carries about with her that aura of transport that only an acknowledgment
from a lover can give a woman. I had hoped that he had seen some way--I
couldn't ask! I wonder--"
</p><p>"Yes, Major," interrupted David quickly, and he winced as he spoke, "it
happened on the hunt Saturday evening. They climbed the bluff and watched
the hunt from a distance and I saw how it was the minute they came back
to the campfire. I saw it and I was just jolly happy over it even to the
tune of Phoebe's sulks--I thought it was all right, and I wish you could
have seen him. His head was up and his eyes danced and he gave up almost
the first real laugh I ever heard from him, when I teased her about
getting lost. As I looked at him I thought about the other, your glad
Andrew, Major, and I was happy all in a shot for you, because I thought
you were going to get back something of what you'd lost. It all seemed
so good!"
</p><p>"There's been joy in the boy's eyes, joy and sorrow waging a war for
weeks, David, and I've had to sit by and watch, powerless to help him.
Yes, his very father himself has looked out of his eyes at me for moments
and I--well I had hoped. Are you sure he is going?" As the major asked
the question his brows knotted themselves together as if to hide the pain
in his eyes.
</p><p>"Yes, he's going and he catches the next tramp steamer for Panama from
Savannah. I wish she would suspect something and force it from him. It's
strange she doesn't," answered David despondently.
</p><p>"Caroline Darrah belongs to the order of humble women whose love feeds on
a glance and can be sustained on a crumb--another class demands a banquet
full spread and always ready. You'll be careful, boy, don't--don't diet
Phoebe too long!" The major eyed David anxiously across the light.
</p><p>"Heavens, I'm your reconcentrado! Major, I feel as if I'd been shut up
down cellar in the cold without the breath of life for a year. It's only
three days and thirteen hours and a half; but I'm all in. I go dead
without her--believe I'll telephone her now!" And David reached for
the receiver that stood on the major's table.
</p><p>"Now, David," said the major, restraining his eager hand and smiling
through his sadness, "don't try to gather your grapes over the phone! I
judge they are ripe, but they still hang high--they always will! Look at
the clock!"
</p><p>David took one look at the staid old mahogany timepiece, which the major
had had brought in from Seven Oaks and placed in the corner opposite his
table, and took his departure.
</p><p>And after he had gone the major retired to his room to lie down for as
much of his allotted rest as he could obtain. Seeing him safely settled,
Mrs. Buchanan went over for a short visit with Mrs. Shelby next door.
Mrs. Matilda stuck to the irate grandmother through thick and thin and in
her affectionate heart she had hopes of bringing about the much to be
desired reconciliation. She was the only person in the city who dared
mention Milly or the babies to the old lady and even in her
unsophistication she suspected that the details she supplied with
determined intrepidity fed a hunger in the lonely old heart. Her
pilgrimage next door was a daily one and never neglected.
</p><p>Thus left alone Caroline Darrah was partaking of a solitary cup of tea,
which was being served her by Tempie in all the gorgeousness of a new
white lace-trimmed and beruffled apron which Caroline had made for her
as near as possible like the dainty garments affected by the French
shop-clad Annette, who was Temple's special ally and admirer, when Mrs.
Cherry Lawrence, in full regalia, descended upon her. Tempie walled her
black eyes and departed with dignity for an extra cup.
</p><p>The major was fast asleep, David Kildare in the processes of bath and
toilet, Phoebe at her desk down-town and Mrs. Matilda away on her
mission, and thus it happened that nobody was near to fend the blight
from the flower of their anxious cherishing.
</p><p>"Yes, indeed, it is a time of anxiety," Mrs. Cherry agreed with Caroline
as she crushed the lemon in her tea. "I shall be glad when it is over. I
feel that we all are making the utmost sacrifices for this election
of David Kildare's, and he's such a boy that he probably will make a
perfectly impossible judge. He never takes anything seriously enough to
accomplish much. It's well for him that no one expects anything from
him."
</p><p>"Oh, but I'm sure he's taking this seriously," exclaimed Caroline Darrah
with a little gleam of dismay in her eyes. "His race has been an
exceptional one whether he wins or not. The major says so and the
other day Mr. Sevier told me--" At the mention of Andrew Sevier's name
Mrs. Cherry glanced around and an ugly little gleam came into her eyes.
</p><p>"Oh, of course Andrew Sevier is too loyal to admit any criticism of David
to a <u>stranger</u>," she said with a slight emphasis on the word and a cold
glance at Caroline Darrah.
</p><p>"But he wasn't talking to a stranger, he was talking just to me," said
Caroline quickly, not even seeing the dart aimed.
</p><p>"You are so sweet, dear!" purred Mrs. Cherry. "Under the circumstances it
is so gracious of you not to feel yourself a stranger with us all and
especially with Andrew Sevier. Of course it would have been impossible
for him always to have avoided you and it was just like his generosity--"
</p><p>"Miss Ca'line, honey," came in a decided voice from the doorway, "that
custard you is a-making for the major's supper is actin' curisome around
the aiges. Please, ma'am, come and see ter it a minute!"
</p><p>"Oh, excuse me just a second," exclaimed Caroline Darrah to Mrs. Cherry
as she rose with alarm in her housewifely heart and hurried past Tempie
down the hall.
</p><p>An instinct engendered by her love for Caroline Darrah had led Tempie to
notice and resent something in Mrs. Lawrence's manner to the child on
several previous occasions and to-day she had felt no scruples about
remaining behind the curtains well within ear-shot of the conversations.
Her knowledge of, and participation in, the Buchanan family affairs, past
and present and future, was an inheritance of several generations and she
never hesitated to assert her privileges.
</p><p>"Lady," she said in a cool soft voice as she squared herself in the
doorway and looked Mrs. Lawrence directly in the face, "you is a rich
white woman and I's a poor nigger, but ef you had er secceeded in
a-putting that thare devil's tale into my young mistess's head they would
er been that 'twixt you and me that we never would er forgot; and there
wouldn't a-been more'n a rag left of that dead-husband-bought frock what
you've got on. Now 'fore I fergits myself I axes you out the front
door--and I'm a-fergittin' fast."
</p><p>And as she faced the domineering woman in her trappings of fashion all
the humble blood in the negro's veins, which had come down to her from
the forewomen who had cradled on their black breasts the mothers of such
as Caroline Darrah, was turned into the jungle passion for defense of
this slight white thing that was the child of her heart if not of her
body. The danger of it made Mrs. Lawrence fairly quail, and, white with
fright, she gathered her rich furs about her and fled just as Caroline
Darrah's returning footsteps were heard in the hall.
</p><p>"Why, where did Mrs. Lawrence go, Tempie?" she demanded in astonishment.
Tempie had just the moment in which to rally herself but she had
accomplished the feat, though her eyes still rolled ominously.
</p><p>"She 'membered something what she forgot and had ter hurry. She lef'
scuses fer you," and Tempie busied herself with the cups and tray.
</p><p>"She was beginning to say something queer to me, Tempie, when you came
in. It was about Mr. Sevier and I didn't understand. I almost felt that
she was being disagreeable to me and it frightened me--about him. I--"
</p><p>"Law, I spects you is mistook, chile, an' if it war anything she jest
wants him herself and was a-laying out ter tell you some enflirtment she
had been a-trying ter have with him. Don't pay no 'tention to it." By
this time she had regained her composure and was able to reassure
Caroline with her usual positiveness to which she added an amount of
worldly tact in substituting a highly disturbing thought in place of the
dangerous one.
</p><p>"Do you really think she can be in love with--with him, Tempie?" demanded
Caroline Darrah, wide-eyed with astonishment. She was entirely diverted
from any desire to follow out or weigh Mrs. Lawrence's remark to her by
the wiliness of the experienced Tempie.
</p><p>"They ain't no telling what widder women out fer number twos <u>will</u> do,"
answered Tempie sagely. "Now, you run and let Miss Annette put that blue
frock on you 'fore dinner. In times of disturbance like these here women
oughter fix theyselves up so as ter 'tice the men ter eat a little at
meal times. Ain't I done put on this white apron ter try and git that no
'count Jefferson jest ter take notice a little uv his vittals. Now go on,
honey--it's late."
</p><p>And thus the love of the old negro had taken away the only chance given
Caroline Darrah to learn the facts of the grim story, from the knowledge
of which she might have worked out salvation for her lover and herself.
</p><p>An hour later as they were being served the soup by the absorbed and
inattentive Jeff, Mrs. Matilda laid down her spoon and said to Caroline
anxiously:
</p><p>"I wish Phoebe had come out to-night. I asked her but she said she was
too busy. She looked tired. Do you suppose she could be ill?"
</p><p>"Yes," answered the major dryly, "I feel sure that Phoebe is ill. She is
at present, I should judge, suffering with a malady which she has had for
some time but which is about to reach the acute stage. It needs judicious
ignoring so let's not mention it to her for the present."
</p><p>"I understand what you mean, Major," answered his wife with delighted
eyes, "and I won't say a word about it. It will be such a help to David
to have a wife when he is the judge. How long will it be before he can be
the governor, dear?"
</p><p>"That depends on the wife, Mrs. Buchanan, to a large extent," answered
the major with a delighted smile.
</p><p>"Oh, Phoebe will want him to do things," said Mrs. Matilda positively.
</p><p>"No doubt of that," the major replied. "I see David Kildare slated for
the full life from now on--eh, Caroline?"
</p><p>And the major had judged Phoebe's situation perhaps more rightly than he
realized, for while David led the vote-directors' rally at the theater
and later was closeted with Andrew for hours over the last editorial
appeal in the morning <u>Journal</u>, Phoebe sat before her desk in her own
little down-town home. Mammy Kitty was snoring away like a peaceful
watch-dog on her cot in the dressing-room and the whole apartment was
dark save for the shaded desk-light.
</p><p>The time and place were fitting and Phoebe was summoning her visions--and
facing her realities. Down the years came sauntering the nonchalant
figure of David Kildare. He had asked her to marry him that awful,
lonely, sixteenth birthday and he had asked her the same thing every
year of all the succeeding ten--and a number of times in between. Phoebe
squared herself to her reviewing self and admitted that she had cared for
him then and ever since--<u>cared</u> for him, but had starved his tenderness
and in the lover had left unsought the man. But she was clear-sighted
enough to know that the handsome easy-going boy, who had wooed with a
smile and taken rebuff with a laugh, was not the steady-eyed forceful man
who now faced her. He stood at the door of a life that stretched away
into long vistas, and now he would demand. Phoebe bowed her head on her
