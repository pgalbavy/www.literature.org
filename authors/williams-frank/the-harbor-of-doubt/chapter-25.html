<p>It was the following afternoon before Code Schofield ventured on
deck.
</p><p>When he did so it was to find that all naval uniforms had been laid
aside, the imitation brass guns forward had been removed, and the
schooner so altered that she would scarcely have been recognized as
the <u>Albatross</u>.
</p><p>The wireless had been erected again, and now the apparatus was
spitting forth an almost constant series of messages. The crew,
spotless in dungarees and without a vestige of a weapon, maneuvered
the schooner as Code had never in his life seen a vessel handled. At a
word from the officer of the watch they jumped as one man. Every order
was executed on the run, and all sails were swayed as flat and taut as
boards.
</p><p>Code found Elsa ensconced with a book under the awning amidships. Big,
comfortable wicker chairs were about and the deck so lately cleared
for action had an almost homelike look.
</p><p>"Did you sleep well?" asked the girl with an entire lack of
self-consciousness, as though the episode of the night before had
never occurred. Code was very thankful for her tact and much relieved.
It was evident that their relations for the remainder of the four
days' journey north were to be impersonal unless he chose to make them
otherwise. This he had no intention of doing--after his morning's
battle with himself.
</p><p>"Like a top, when I got started," he replied. "And you?"
</p><p>"Splendidly, thanks. And you should have seen the breakfast I ate. I
am a shameful gourmand when I am at sea."
</p><p>He took a chair and filled his pipe.
</p><p>"By the way, how long have you been out on this cruise? You weren't
aboard, were you, the time the mystery schooner led the revenue
steamer such a chase?"
</p><p>"No," she replied, "but I wish I had been. I nearly died when I heard
about that; it was so funny. I have only been aboard about four days.
I'll tell you the history of it.
</p><p>"I was having a very delightful dinner up at Mallaby House with Mrs.
Tanner, Nellie's mother, you know"--she looked unconcernedly out to
sea--"when I got a message, part wireless and part telegram, saying
that Nat Burns had nabbed you in St. Pierre and was racing with you to
St. Andrew's.
</p><p>"Well, I've sworn all along that you shouldn't come to any harm
through him, so I just left Freekirk Head the next morning on the
steamer, took a train to Halifax, and had the schooner pick me up
there. Off Halifax they told me that the <u>Nettie B.</u> was six hours
ahead of us and going hard, so we had to wing it out for all there was
in this one. I had provided all the naval fixings before, realizing
that we would probably have to use them some time, and that's all
there is to it."
</p><p>"Well, Elsa, I'll say this--that I don't believe that there was ever a
schooner built that could outgame and outsail this one. She's a
wonder!"
</p><p>For a while they talked of trite and inconsequential things. It was
very necessary that they become firmly grounded on their new footing
of genuine friendship before departing into personalities; and so, for
two days, they avoided any but the most casual topics.
</p><p>As the weather was exceptionally warm, with a spicy salt breeze that
seemed to bear the very germ of life in its midst, they had breakfast
and luncheon on deck, dining below in the rosy little dining-room.
</p><p>Thirty-six hours before they expected to catch the fishing fleet (it
had been maneuvered so that Code should be restored to the <u>Charming
Lass</u> after dark), Elsa opened the subject of Code's trouble with Nat
Burns. It was morning, and his recent days of ease and mental
refreshment had made him see things clearly that had before been
obscured by the great strain under which he labored.
</p><p>Code told her the whole thing from beginning to end, leaving out only
that part of Nat's cumulative scheme that had to do with Nellie
Tanner. He showed Elsa how his enemy had left no stone unturned to
bring him back home a pauper, a criminal, and one who could never
again lift his head among his own people even though he escaped years
in prison.
</p><p>It was a brief and simple story, but he could see Elsa's face change
as emotions swept over it. Her remarks were few, but he suddenly
became aware that she was harboring a great and lasting hatred against
Nat. He did not flatter himself that it was on his own account, nor
did he ask the reason for it, but the knowledge that such a hatred
existed came to him as a decided surprise.
</p><p>When he had finished his narrative she sat for some little time
silent.
</p><p>"And you think, then," she asked at last, "that his motive for all
this is revenge, because his father happened to meet death on the old
<u>May?</u>"
</p><p>"So far it has seemed to me that that can be the only possible reason.
What else--but now wait a moment while I think."
</p><p>He went below into his room, secured the old log of the <u>M.C. Burns</u>
and the artificial horizon. Together they read the entries that
Michael Burns had made.
</p><p>"Now, Elsa," said Code by way of explanation, "it was a dead-sure
thing that Nat could never have beaten me in his schooner, and for two
reasons: First, the <u>May</u> was a naturally faster boat than the old
<u>M.C.</u>, although Nat would never admit it. That is what really started
our racing. Secondly, I am only telling the truth when I say that I
can outsail Nat Burns in any wind from a zephyr to a typhoon.
</p><p>"He is the kind of chap, in regard to sailing, who doesn't seem to
have the 'feel' of the thing. There is a certain instinct of forces
and balance that is either natural or acquired. Nat's is acquired.
Why, I can remember just as well when I was eight years old my father
used to let me take a short trick at the wheel in good weather, and I
took to it naturally. Once on the Banks in a gale, when I was only
eighteen, the men below said that my trick at the wheel was the only
one when they got any sleep.
</p><p>"Now, those two things being the case, Elsa, how did Nat Burns expect
to win the second race from the <u>May</u>?"
</p><p>"I don't know. It doesn't seem possible that he <u>could</u> win."
</p><p>"Of course it doesn't, and yet his father writes here that Nat 'swears
he can't lose.' Well, now, you know, a man that swears he can't lose
is pretty positive."
</p><p>"Did he try to bet with you for the second race?" asked Elsa.
</p><p>"Did he? I had five hundred dollars at the bank and he tried to bet me
that. I never bet, because I've never had enough money to throw it
around. A good deal changed hands on the first race, but none of it
was mine. I raced for sport and not for money, and I told Nat so when
he tried to bet with me. If I had raced for money I couldn't have
withdrawn that day and gone to St. John for cargo the way I did."
</p><p>"Then it seems to me that he must have <u>known</u> he couldn't lose or he
would not have tried to bet."
</p><p>"Exactly."
</p><p>"But how <u>could</u> he know it?"
</p><p>"That is what I would like to find out."
</p><p>Code absently thrust his hand into his coat pocket and encountered the
mirror he had found aboard the <u>Nettie B.</u> He drew it out and polished
its bright surface with his handkerchief.
</p><p>Elsa was immediately interested and Code told her of its unexpected
discovery.
</p><p>"And he had it!" she cried, laughing. "Of all things!"
</p><p>"Yes, and he always wanted it. I remember when father first gave it to
me and I was working out little problems in astronomy, Nat used to
take the thing and handle it and admire it. You see the back and edges
are silver-plated and it is really quite valuable. He tried to get his
father interested, but, so far as I know, never succeeded.
</p><p>"It was a strange thing, but that simple mirror appealed to Nat
tremendously, and you know how that would act on a man of his nature.
He is and always has been utterly selfish, and if there was any object
he wanted and could not have it increased his desire."
</p><p>"But how did he get it, I wonder?" asked the girl, taking the object
and heliographing the bright sun's rays from the polished surface.
"When did you have it last?"
</p><p>Code knitted his brows and thought back carefully. He had an
instinctive feeling that perhaps in this mirror lay the key to the
whole situation, just as often in life the most unexpected and trivial
things or events are pregnant with great moment.
</p><p>"I had it," he said slowly, thinking hard; "let me see: the last time
I remember it was the day after my first race with Nat. In the desk
that stood in the cabin of the old <u>May</u> I kept the log, my sextant,
and a lot of other things of that kind. In a lower drawer was this
mirror, and the reason I saw it was this:
</p><p>"When I had made fast to my moorings in the harbor I immediately went
below to make the entry in the log about the race--naturally I
couldn't leave that undone. I remember I looked in the top drawer for
the book, but didn't find it. So then I looked in the other drawers
and, in doing so, opened the one containing the mirror.
</p><p>"I distinctly remember seeing it, for the lamp was lighted and the
glass flashed a blinding glare into my eyes. You see we raced in about
the worst winter weather there was and the lamp had to be lighted very
early.
</p><p>"The log-book wasn't there, and I found it somewhere or other later,
but that hasn't anything to do with the case. I never saw the mirror
after that--in fact, never looked for it. I took for granted it had
gone down with the <u>May</u>, along with all my other things, except the
log-book, which I saved and use now aboard the <u>Lass</u>."
</p><p>"And you didn't take it out or give it to anybody?"
</p><p>"No. I am positive of that. I didn't touch it after seeing it that
once."
</p><p>"Then it is very plain, Code, that if Nat Burns came into possession
of it he must have taken it himself. He was very angry with you for
winning, wasn't he?"
</p><p>"Terribly. For once I thought he might be dangerous and kept out of
his way until the thing had worn off a little."
</p><p>"Just like him," said Elsa in that tone of bitter hatred that Code had
heard her use before when speaking of Burns. "He must have gone aboard
the <u>May</u> and taken it, because you prized it so much. A fine
revenge!"
</p><p>"Yes, but we don't do those things in Freekirk Head, Elsa. You know
that. We don't steal from one another's trawl-lines, and we don't
prowl about other men's schooners. I can't understand his doing a
thing like that."
</p><p>"Perhaps not, but if not, explain how he got it."
</p><p>"You're right," Code admitted after a moment's thought; "that's the
only way."
</p><p>They were silent for a while, pondering over this new development and
trying to discover where it might lead. Under sharp commands the crew
brought the schooner about on the starboard tack, for the wind was on
the bow, and set a staysail between the fore and main masts. The
splendid ship seemed to skim over the surface of the sea, touching
only the tops of the waves.
</p><p>"No, it's no good!" broke out Code suddenly. "Much as I hate Nat
Burns, I don't believe he would come aboard my schooner just for the
purpose of stealing a silver-plated mirror. That isn't like him. He's
too clever to do anything like that. And, besides, what kind of a
revenge would that be for having lost the race?"
</p><p>"Well, what can you suggest? How else did he get it?" Elsa was frankly
sceptical and clung to her own theory.
</p><p>"He might have come aboard for something else, mightn't he, and picked
up the mirror just incidentally?"
</p><p>"He might have, yes, but what else would bring him there?"
</p><p>Code sat rigid for a few minutes. He had such a thought that he
scarcely dared consider it himself.
</p><p>"It's all clear to me now," he said in a low, hoarse voice. "Nat came
aboard to damage the schooner so that he would be sure to win the
second race."
</p><p>"Code!" The cry was one of involuntary horror as Elsa remembered the
tragedy of the <u>May</u>. Hate Nate though she might, this was an awful
charge to lay at his door.
</p><p>"Then he killed his own father, if what you say is true!" she added
breathlessly. "Oh, the poor wretch! The poor wretch!"
</p><p>"Yes, that solves it," went on Code, who had hardly heard her. "That
solves the entries that Michael Burns made in his ship's log before
he went to St. John on his last business trip. Nat swore he could not
lose, and the old man, who was honest enough himself, must have
wondered what his son was up to.
</p><p>"This mirror proves that Nat must have been aboard the schooner
secretly; what he told his father and his eagerness to bet with me on
a proposition that seemed foolhardy on the face of it clinch the thing
in my mind. The misguided fool! That, Elsa, is an example of how low a
man will go who has been spoiled and brought up without the slightest
idea of self-control."
</p><p>"Why, you're preaching to me, Code," laughed the girl, and he joined
her. But she sobered in a moment.
</p><p>"This is all very fine theory," she said, "and I half believe it
myself, but it's worthless; you haven't a grain of proof. Tell me,
have you ever thought over the details of the sinking of the <u>May?</u>"
</p><p>"Only once," groaned Schofield, "and I--I hate to do it, Elsa. I'd
rather not. Every time I think of that awful day I sweat with sheer
horror. Every incident of it is engraved on my brain."
</p><p>"But listen, Code, you must think about it for once, and think about
it with all your mind. Tell me everything that happened. It is vital
to our case; it may save the whole thing from being worthless. Even
if we get nothing you must make the effort."
</p><p>Code knew that what Elsa said was true. With an effort he focused his
mind back on that awful day and began.
</p><p>"There was a good sea that day," he said, "and more than half a gale
out of the northeast. If it had been any other day I shouldn't have
taken the old <u>May</u> out at all, because she was loaded very deep. But
the whole trip was a hurry call and they wanted me to get back to
Mignon with the salt as soon as I could.
</p><p>"Old Burns saw me on the wharf and asked if he could go along as
passenger. I said he could, and we started early in the morning. Now
that day wasn't anything unusual, Elsa. I've been in a lot worse gales
in the <u>May</u>, but not with her so deep; but I didn't think anything
would happen.
</p><p>"Everything went all right for three hours, with the wind getting
fresher all the time, and the vessel under four lowers, which was a
pretty big strain on any schooner. As I say, she should have stood it,
but all of a sudden, on a big lurch, the fore topm'st that hadn't a
rag on her broke off short and banged down, hanging by the guys. With
one swipe it smashed the foregaff to splinters, and half the canvas
hung down flapping like a great wing.
</p><p>"I couldn't understand it. I knew the topm'st was in a weakened
condition, but not as rotten as punk, and I supposed my foregaff was
as solid a piece of timber as ever went into a vessel.
</p><p>"But listen!" as Elsa started to speak. "That isn't all. The flapping
canvas, with part of the gaff, pounded around like the devil let loose
for the ten seconds before we couldn't loosen the halyards and lower
away the wreckage, but in that time it had parted the mainstay in two
like a woman snipping a thread.
</p><p>"Mind that, Elsa, a steel mainstay an inch thick. I never heard of one
parting in my life before. Things were happening so fast that I
couldn't keep track of them, and now, just at the crucial minute, the
old <u>May</u> jibed, fell off from the wind, and went into the trough of
the sea. A great wave came then, ripped her rudder off (I found this
as soon as I tried to use the wheel) and swept the decks, taking one
man.
</p><p>"Meanwhile the mainmast, with one stay gone, was whipping from side to
side like a great, loose stick. I put the wheel in the becket and in
one jump released the mains'l throat-halyards, while another fellow
released the peak. The sail came down on the run in the lazy jacks and
the men jumped on it and began to crowd it into some kind of a furl.
</p><p>"I jumped back to the wheel and tried to bring her up into the wind,
but I might as well have tried to steer an ocean liner with a
sculling sweep. Not only was her rudder gone, but the tiller ropes
were parted on each side. It was damaged beyond repair!
</p><p>"Once I read in school the funny poem of an American named Holmes. It
was called the 'One Hoss Shay,' and it told about an old chaise that,
after a hundred years of service, suddenly went to pieces all at the
same time and the same place. Even, in that time of danger, the memory
of the 'One Hoss Shay' came to me, and I thought that the <u>May
Schofield</u> was doing exactly the same thing, although only half as
old."
</p><p>"And then what happened?" asked Elsa, who had sat breathless through
Code's narrative.
</p><p>"There's not much more to tell," he said, with an involuntary shudder.
"It was too much for the old girl with that load in her. She began to
wallow and drive toward the Wolves that I had caught a glimpse of
through the scud. She hadn't got halfway there when the mainmast came
down (bringing nearly everything with it) and hung over the starboard
quarter, dragging the vessel down like a stoat hanging to a duck's
leg.
</p><p>"After that it was easy to see she was doomed. We chopped away at the
tangle of wreckage whenever we got a chance, but that wasn't often,
because, in her present position, the waves raked her every second
and we had to hang on for dear life.
</p><p>"And then she began to go to pieces--which was the beginning of the
end. All hands knew it was to be every man for himself. We had no life
preservers, and our one big dory had been smashed when the wreckage
came down."
</p><p>Code's face was working with suppressed emotion, and Elsa reached out
her hand and touched his.
</p><p>"Don't tell me any more," she said; "I know the rest. Let's talk about
the present."
</p><p>"Thanks, Elsa," he said, gratefully.
</p><p>"How long have you thought that the schooner was a second 'one hoss
shay'?"
</p><p>"Until this talk with you. I would never have thought anything else.
It's the logical thing to think, isn't it? All my neighbors at
Freekirk Head, except those who believe the evil they hear, have told
me half a dozen times that that is what must have happened to the
<u>May</u>. She had lived her life and that last great strain, combined
with the race the week before, was too much for her. I simply could
not explain those things happening."
</p><p>"Yes, but you can now, can't you?" she asked coolly.
</p><p>Reluctantly he faced the issue, but he faced it squarely.
</p><p>"Yes, I can. Nat expected me to sail the <u>May</u> in a race, so he
weakened my topm'st and mainstay. Of course, when there is sport in it
you set every kite you've got in your lockers and, you know, Elsa, I
never took my mains'l in yet while there was one standing in the
fleet, even ordinary fishing days."
</p><p>"I know it; you've scared me half to death a dozen times with your
sail-carrying."
</p><p>"And mind, Elsa, I'd been warned by all the wiseacres in Freekirk Head
that my sticks would carry away sometime in a gale o' wind. Nat banked
on that, too, and it shows how clever he was, forever since the <u>May</u>
sank I've had men tell me I shouldn't have carried four lowers that
day.
</p><p>"He planned to weaken me where I needed sail most and he succeeded.
Why, Elsa, that topm'st must have been sawed a quarter of the way
through and that mainstay as much again. I don't really believe he did
anything to the foregaff; it appeared to be the natural result of the
topm'st's falling, but the damage he did resulted in the wreck of the
schooner--"
</p><p>"And the death of his own father. Yes, Code, we've got him where he is
probably the wretchedest man in the world. Fury and hurt pride made
him injure the <u>May</u> so he would be sure to win the second time, and
instead of that fate intervened, sent you on the cargo voyage, and
killed his father. Now it is perfectly plain to me why he is charging
you with all these crimes."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Nat is a weak nature, because uncontrolled, and when weak natures do
wrong they suffer agonies of fear that they will be found out. Nat
committed this double crime in a momentary passion. Then as the weeks
passed by and the village talked of nothing else, he finally began to
fear that he would be found out.
</p><p>"There was no one who <u>could</u> have found him out, but there was that
haunting terror of the weak nature.
</p><p>"Somebody spoke a word, perhaps in jest, that you must have wanted a
new schooner since the <u>May's</u> policy was to run out so soon, and he
seized the thought in a frenzy of joy and began to spread rumors. This
grip on you gave him courage. He remembered that his revenge against
you was still unsatisfied and it became clear to him that perhaps,
after all, he could get one much more complete.
</p><p>"Code, the picture of that man's mind is a terrible one to me. He may
have hated you before, but just think how he must have hated you after
knowing how he had wronged and was going to ruin you. It is only the
one of two people who <u>does</u> the injury whose hatred grows. An injured
person who is sensible in regard to such matters, as you have been
with Nat all your life, throws them off and thinks nothing more about
them.
</p><p>"So Nat's hatred of you and the fear of discovery, preying on his
mind, finally urged him into the course he has taken."
</p><p>"And he went into it with open eyes," rejoined Code, "for his plans
were perfect. He pays his crew double wages and they ask no questions.
Had it not been for you on two occasions I should have been in jail
long before this."
</p><p>"Yes, but now that is past--"
</p><p>"No," interrupted Code, "it isn't, Elsa. He has just as much power
over me as he ever had. I am still a criminal at large to be arrested,
and you can wager your last dollar that if he can bring it about I
will be picked up by the first gunboat that finds me."
</p><p>"But after all this?"
</p><p>"Yes, after all this. We have made a beautiful case against him and it
fits, but, Elsa, there's one thing we haven't got, and that is a
single word of proof! We haven't enough to even bring a charge against
him. Do you realize that?"
</p><p>The girl sat back, unable to reply. Code had expressed the situation
in a sentence. Despite all they had pieced together he, Code, was
still the man against whom the burden of circumstantial evidence
rested. Nat was, and always could go, scot free.
</p><p>"Code, this is terrible!" she said. "But there may be a way out yet.
No man with the right on his side has ever failed to triumph, however
black things looked."
</p><p>"But how?" he cried despairingly. "I have racked my brains for some
means of closing the net about him, but there seems no way."
</p><p>"Now there is not," she returned, "but, Code, you can rest assured
that I will do everything I can."
</p><p>"God bless you," he said, taking her hand; "you are the best friend a
man ever had."
