<p>The President of the Republic, as a new broom, had been sweeping
perhaps a little too clean for the common liking, so there was a
'rebellion.'  It was not a very large one.  But it meant, of
course, banditry, robbery, and cowed villages.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n was determined to keep free from the taint of politics.  But
already the Church, and with the Church the Knights of Cort&eacute;s and a
certain 'black' faction, was preparing against him.  The priests
began to denounce him from the pulpits - but not very loudly - as an
ambitious Anti-Christ.  With Cipriano beside him, however, and with
Cipriano the army of the west, he had not much to fear.</p>

<p>But it was possible Cipriano would have to march away in defence of
the Government.</p>

<p>'Above all things,' said Ram&oacute;n, 'I don't want to acquire a
political smell.  I don't want to be pushed in the direction of any
party.  Unless I can stand uncontaminated, I had better abandon
everything.  But the Church will push me over to the socialists - 
and the socialists will betray me on the first opportunity.  It is
not myself.  It is the new spirit.  The surest way to kill it - and
it can be killed, like any other living thing - is to get it
connected with any political party.'</p>

<p>'Why don't you see the Bishop?' said Cipriano.  'I will see him
too.  Am I to be chief of the division in the west for nothing?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Ram&oacute;n slowly, 'I will see Jimenez.  I have thought of
it.  Yes, I intend to use every means in my power. - Montes will
stand for us, because he hates the Church and hates any hint of
dictation from outside.  He sees the possibility of a &quot;national&quot;
church.  Though myself, I don't care about national churches.  Only
one has to speak the language of one's own people.  You know the
priests are forbidding the people to read the Hymns?'</p>

<p>'What does that matter?' said Cipriano.  'These people are nothing
if not perverse, nowadays.  They will read them all the more.'</p>

<p>'Maybe! - I shall take no notice.  I'll let my new legend, as they
call it, grow while the earth is moist.  But we have to keep our
eye very close on all the little bunches of &quot;interests&quot;.'</p>

<p>'Ram&oacute;n!' said Cipriano.  'If you can turn Mexico entirely into a
Quetzalcoatl country, what then?'</p>

<p>'I shall be First Man of Quetzalcoatl - I know no more.'</p>

<p>'You won't trouble about the rest of the world?'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n smiled.  Already he saw in Cipriano's eye the gleam of a Holy
War.</p>

<p>'I would like,' he said, smiling, 'to be one of the Initiates of
the Earth.  One of the Initiators.  Every country its own Saviour,
Cipriano: or every people its own Saviour.  And the First Men of
every people, forming a Natural Aristocracy of the World.  One must
have aristocrats, that we know.  But natural ones, not artificial.
And in some way the world must be organically united: the world of
man.  But in the concrete, not in the abstract.  Leagues and
Covenants and International Programmes.  Ah! Cipriano! it's like an
international pestilence.  The leaves of one great tree can't hang
on the boughs of another great tree.  The races of the earth are
like trees; in the end they neither mix nor mingle.  They stand out
of each other's way, like trees.  Or else they crowd on one
another, and their roots grapple, and it is the fight to the
death. - Only from the flowers there is commingling.  And the
flowers of every race are the natural aristocrats of that race.
And the spirit of the world can fly from flower to flower, like a
humming-bird, and slowly fertilize the great trees in their
blossoms.  Only the Natural Aristocrats can rise above their
nation; and even then they do not rise beyond their race.  Only the
Natural Aristocrats of the World can be international, or
cosmopolitan, or cosmic.  It has always been so.  The peoples are
no more capable of it than the leaves of the mango-tree are capable
of attaching themselves to the pine. - So if I want Mexicans to
learn the name of Quetzalcoatl, it is because I want them to speak
with the tongues of their own blood.  I wish the Teutonic world
would once more think in terms of Thor and Wotan, and the tree
Igdrasil.  And I wish the Druidic world would see, honestly, that
in the mistletoe is their mystery, and that they themselves are the
Tuatha De Danaan, alive, but submerged.  And a new Hermes should
come back to the Mediterranean, and a new Ashtaroth to Tunis; and
Mithras again to Persia, and Brahma unbroken to India, and the
oldest of dragons to China.  Then I, Cipriano, I, First Man of
Quetzalcoatl, with you, First Man of Huitzilopochtli, and perhaps
your wife, First Woman of Itzpapalotl, could we not meet, with sure
souls, the other great aristocrats of the world, the First Man of
Wotan and the First Woman of Freya, First Lord of Hermes, and the
Lady of Astarte, the Best-Born of Brahma, and the Son of the
Greatest Dragon?  I tell you, Cipriano, then the earth might
rejoice, when the First Lords of the West met the First Lords of
South and East, in the Valley of the Soul.  Ah, the earth has
Valleys of the Soul, that are not cities of commerce and industry.
And the mystery is one mystery, but men must see it differently.
The hibiscus and the thistle and the gentian all flower on the Tree
of Life, but in the world they are far apart; and must be.  And I
am hibiscus and you are a yucca flower, and your Caterina is a wild
daffodil, and my Carlota is a white pansy.  Only four of us, yet we
make a curious bunch.  So it is.  The men and women of the earth
are not manufactured goods, to be interchangeable.  But the Tree of
Life is one tree, as we know when our souls open in the last
blossoming.  We can't change ourselves, and we don't want to.  But
when our souls open out in the final blossoming, then as blossoms
we share one mystery with all blossoms, beyond the knowledge of any
leaves and stems and roots: something transcendent.</p>

<p>'But it doesn't matter.  At the present time I have to fight my way
in Mexico, and you have to fight yours.  So let us go and do it.'</p>

<p>He went away to his workshops and his men who were labouring under
his directions, while Cipriano sat down to his correspondence and
his military planning.</p>

<p>They were both interrupted by the thudding of a motor-boat entering
the little bay.  It was Kate, escorted by the black-scarved Juana.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n, in his white clothes, with the blue-and-black figured sash
and the big hat with the turquoise-inlaid Eye of Quetzalcoatl, went
down to meet her.  She was in white, too, with a green hat and the
shawl of pale yellow silk.</p>

<p>'I was so glad to come again,' she said, holding out her hand to
him.  'Jamiltepec has become a sort of Mecca to me, my inside
yearns for it.'</p>

<p>'Then why don't you come oftener?  I wish you would come.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid of intruding.'</p>

<p>'No!  You could help if you would.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said.  'I am so frightened, and so sceptical of big
undertakings.  I think it is because, at the very bottom of me, I
dislike the masses of people - anywhere.  I'm afraid I rather
despise people; I don't want them to touch me, and I don't want to
touch them. - So how could I pretend to join any - any - any sort of
Salvation Army? - which is a horrid way of putting it.'</p>

<p>Don Ram&oacute;n laughed.</p>

<p>'I do myself,' he said.  'I detest and despise masses of people.
But these are my own people.'</p>

<p>'I, ever since I was a child, since I can remember. - They say of
me, when I was a little girl of four, and my parents were having a
big dinner-party, they had the nurse bring me in to say good night
to all the people they had there dressed up and eating and
drinking.  And I suppose they all said nice things to me, as they
do.  I only answered:  You are all monkeys!  It was a great
success! - But I felt it even as a child, and I feel it now.  People
are all monkeys to me, performing in different ways.'</p>

<p>'Even the people nearest you?'</p>

<p>Kate hesitated.  Then she confessed, rather unwillingly:</p>

<p>'Yes!  I'm afraid so.  Both my husbands - even Joachim - they seemed,
somehow, so OBSTINATE in their little stupidities - rather like
monkeys.  I felt a terrible revulsion from Joachim when he was
dead.  I thought:  What peaked monkey is that, that I have been
losing my blood about. - Do you think it's rather awful?'</p>

<p>'I do!  But then I think we ALL feel like that, at moments.  Or we
would if we dared.  It's only one of our moments.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' said she, 'I think that is my PERMANENT feeling
towards people.  I like the world, the sky and the earth and the
greater mystery beyond.  But people - yes, they are all monkeys to
me.'</p>

<p>He could see that, at the bottom of her soul, it was true.</p>

<p>'Puros monos!' he said to himself in Spanish.  'Y lo que hacen,
puras moner&iacute;as.'</p>

<p>'Pure monkeys!  And the things they do, sheer monkeydom!'  Then he
added:  'Yet you have children!'</p>

<p>'Yes!  Yes!' she said, struggling with herself.  'My first
husband's children.'</p>

<p>'And they? - monos y no m&aacute;s?'</p>

<p>'No!' she said, frowning and looking angry with herself.  'Only
partly.'</p>

<p>'It is bad,' he said, shaking his head.  'But then!' he added. - 
'What are my own children to me, but little monkeys?  And their
mother - and their mother - Ah, no! Se&ntilde;ora Caterina!  It is no good.
One must be able to disentangle oneself from persons, from people.
If I go to a rose-bush, to be intimate with it, it is a nasty thing
that hurts me.  One must disentangle oneself from persons and
personalities, and see people as one sees the trees in the
landscape.  People in some way DOMINATE you.  In some way, humanity
dominates your consciousness.  So you must hate people and
humanity, and you want to escape.  But there is only one way of
escape: to turn beyond them, to the greater life.'</p>

<p>'But I do!' cried Kate.  'I do nothing else.  When I was with
Joachim absolutely alone in a cottage, doing all the work myself,
and knowing nobody at all, just living, and FEELING the greater
thing all the time; then I was free, I was happy.'</p>

<p>'But he?' said Ram&oacute;n.  'Was he free and happy?'</p>

<p>'He was REALLY.  But that's where the monkeyishness comes in.  He
wouldn't let himself be content.  He insisted on having PEOPLE and
a CAUSE, just to torture himself with.'</p>

<p>'Then why didn't you live in your cottage QUITE alone, and without
him?' he said.  'Why do you travel and see people?'</p>

<p>She was silent, very angry.  She knew she could not live quite
alone.  The vacuity crushed her.  She needed a man there, to stop
the gap, and to keep her balanced.  But even when she had him, in
her heart of hearts she despised him, as she despised the dog and
the cat.  Between herself and humanity there was the bond of
subtle, helpless antagonism.</p>

<p>She was naturally quite free-handed and she left people their
liberty.  Servants would get attached to her, and casual people all
liked and admired her.  She had a strong life-flow of her own, and
a certain assertive joie de vivre.</p>

<p>But underneath it all was the unconquerable dislike, almost DISGUST
of people.  More than hate, it was disgust.  Whoever it was,
wherever it was, however it was, after a little while this disgust
overcame her.  Her mother, her father, her sisters, her first
husband, even her children whom she loved, and Joachim, for whom
she had felt such passionate love, even these, being near her,
filled her with a certain disgust and repulsion after a little
while, and she longed to fling them down the great and final
oubliette.</p>

<p>But there is no great and final oubliette: or at least, it is never
final, until one has flung ONESELF down.</p>

<p>So it was with Kate.  Till she flung herself down the last dark
oubliette of death, she would never escape from her deep, her
bottomless disgust with human beings.  Brief contacts were all
right, thrilling even.  But close contacts, or long contacts, were
short and long revulsions of violent disgust.</p>

<p>She and Ram&oacute;n had sat down on a bench under the white-flowering
oleander of the garden downstairs.  His face was impassive and
still.  In the stillness, with a certain pain and nausea, he
realized the state she was in, and realized that his own state, as
regards PERSONAL people, was the same.  Mere PERSONAL contact, mere
human contact filled him, too, with disgust.  Carlota disgusted
him.  Kate herself disgusted him.  Sometimes, Cipriano disgusted
him.</p>

<p>But this was because, or when, he met them on a merely human,
personal plane.  To do so was disaster: it filled him with disgust
of them and loathing of himself.</p>

<p>He had to meet them on another plane, where the contact was
different; intangible, remote, and without INTIMACY.  His soul was
concerned elsewhere.  So that the quick of him need not be bound to
anybody.  The quick of a man must turn to God alone: in some way or
other.</p>

<p>With Cipriano he was most sure.  Cipriano and he, even when they
embraced each other with passion, when they met after an absence,
embraced in the recognition of each other's eternal and abiding
loneliness; like the Morning Star.</p>

<p>But women would not have this.  They wanted intimacy - and intimacy
means disgust.  Carlota wanted to be eternally and closely
identified with Ram&oacute;n, consequently she hated him and hated
everything which she thought drew him away from this eternal close
identification with herself.  It was just a horror and he knew it.</p>

<p>Men and women should know that they cannot, absolutely, meet on
earth.  In the closest kiss, the dearest touch, there is the small
gulf which is none the less complete because it is so narrow, so
NEARLY non-existent.  They must bow and submit in reverence, to the
gulf.  Even though I eat the body and drink the blood of Christ,
Christ is Christ and I am I, and the gulf is impassable.  Though a
woman be dearer to a man than his own life, yet he is he and she is
she, and the gulf can never close up.  Any attempt to close it is a
violation, and the crime against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>That which we get from the beyond, we get it alone.  The final me I
am, comes from the farthest off, from the Morning Star.  The rest
is assembled.  All that of me which is assembled from the mighty
cosmos can meet and touch all that is assembled in the beloved.
But this is never the quick.  Never can be.</p>

<p>If we would meet in the quick, we must give up the assembled self,
the daily I, and, putting off ourselves one after the other, meet
unconscious in the Morning Star.  Body, soul, and spirit can be
transfigured into the Morning Star.  But without transfiguration we
shall never get there.  We shall gnash at the leash.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n knew what it was to gnash at his leashes.  He had gnashed
himself almost to pieces, before he had found the way to pass out
in himself, in the quick of himself, to the Quick of all being and
existence, which he called the Morning Star, since men must give
all things names.  To pass in the quick of himself, with
transfiguration, to the Morning Star, and there, there alone meet
his fellow man.</p>

<p>He knew what it was to fail even now, and to keep on failing.  With
Carlota he failed absolutely.  She claimed him and he restrained
himself in resistance.  Even his very naked breast, when Carlota
was there, was self-conscious and assertively naked.  But then that
was because she claimed it as her property.</p>

<p>When men meet at the quick of all things, they are neither naked
nor clothed; in the transfiguration they are just complete, they
are not seen in part.  The final perfect strength has also the
power of innocence.</p>

<p>Sitting on the seat beside Kate, Ram&oacute;n was sad with the sense of
heaviness and inadequacy.  His third Hymn was angry and bitter.
Carlota almost embittered his soul.  In Mexico, turbulent fellows
had caught at his idea and burlesqued it.  They had invaded one of
the churches of the city, thrown out the sacred images, and hung in
their place the grotesque papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; Judas figures, which the
Mexicans explode at Easter time.  This of course made a scandal.
And Cipriano, whenever he was away on his own for some time,
slipped back into the inevitable Mexican General, fascinated by the
opportunity for furthering his own personal ambition and imposing
his own personal will.  Then came Kate, with this centre of sheer
repudiation deep in the middle of her, the will to explode the
world.</p>

<p>He felt his spirits sinking again, his limbs going like lead.
There is only one thing that a man really wants to do, all his
life; and that is, to find his way to his God, his Morning Star,
and be alone there.  Then afterwards, in the Morning Star, salute
his fellow man, and enjoy the woman who has come the long way with
him.</p>

<p>But to find the way, far, far along, to the bright Quick of all
things, this is difficult, and requires all a man's strength and
courage, for himself.  If he breaks a trail alone, it is terrible.
But if every hand pulls at him, to stay him in the human places; if
the hands of love drag at his entrails and the hands of hate seize
him by the hair, it becomes almost impossible.</p>

<p>This was how Ram&oacute;n felt at the moment: - I am attempting the
impossible.  I had better either go and take my pleasure of life
while it lasts, hopeless of the pleasure which is beyond all
pleasures.  Or else I had better go into the desert and take my way
all alone, to the Star where at last I have my wholeness, holiness.
The way of the anchorites and the men who went into the wilderness
to pray.  For surely my soul is craving for her consummation, and I
am weary of the thing men call life.  Living, I want to depart to
where <span style="text-decoration: underline">I AM</span>.</p>

<p>Yet, he said to himself, the woman that was with me in the Morning
Star, how glad I should be of her!  And the man that was with me
there, what a delight his presence would be!  Surely the Morning
Star is a meeting-ground for us, for the joy!</p>

<p>Sitting side by side on the bench, Ram&oacute;n and Kate forgot one
another, she thinking back on the past, with the long disgust of it
all, he thinking on into his future, and trying to revive his heavy
spirits.</p>

<p>In the silence, Cipriano came out on to the balcony above, looking
around.  He almost started as he saw the two figures seated on the
bench below, under the white oleander tree, miles apart, worlds
apart, in their silence.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n heard the step, and glanced up.</p>

<p>'We are coming up!' he called, rising and looking round at Kate.
'Shall we go upstairs?  Will you drink something cool, tepache, or
squeezed oranges?  There is no ice.'</p>

<p>'I would like orange juice and water,' she said.</p>

<p>He called to his servant and gave the order.</p>

<p>Cipriano was in the white pantaloons and blouse, like Ram&oacute;n.  But
his sash was scarlet, with black curves, something like the
markings on a snake.</p>

<p>'I heard you come.  I thought perhaps you had gone away again,' he
said, looking at her with a certain black reproachfulness: an odd,
hesitating wistfulness of the barbarian, who feels himself at a
loss.  Then also a certain resentment.</p>

<p>'Not yet,' she said.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n laughed, and flung himself into a chair.</p>

<p>'The Se&ntilde;ora Caterina thinks we are all monkeys, but perhaps this
particular monkey-show is the most amusing after all,' he said.
'So she will see a little more of it.'</p>

<p>Cipriano, a real Indian, was offended in his pride, and the little
black imperial on his chin seemed to become portentous.</p>

<p>'That's RATHER an unfair way of putting it!' laughed Kate.</p>

<p>The black eyes of Cipriano glanced at her in hostility.  He thought
she was laughing at him.  And so, at the depths of her female soul,
she was.  She was jeering at him inwardly.  Which no man can stand,
least of all a dark-skinned man.</p>

<p>'No!' she said.  'There's something else beside that.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Ram&oacute;n.  'Take care!  A little mercy is a dangerous
thing.'</p>

<p>'No!  Not mercy!' she said, flushing.  'Why are you being horrid to
me?'</p>

<p>'Monkeys always end by being horrid to the spectators,' said Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and caught the flash of anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>'I came,' she said, 'to hear about the Mexican pantheon.  I was
even given to understand I might be admitted.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that is good!' laughed Ram&oacute;n.  'A rare specimen of the female
monkey has been added to the Ram&oacute;n menagerie!  I am sure you would
be a good draw.  There have been some pretty goddesses, I assure
you, in the Aztec pantheon.'</p>

<p>'How horrid!' she said.</p>

<p>'Come!  Come!' he cried.  'Let us keep to the bedrock of things,
Se&ntilde;ora m&iacute;a.  We are all monkeys.  Monos somos. - Ihr seid alle
Affen!  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings was it spoken, as
Carlota said.  You see that little male monkey, Cipriano.  He had
the monkey's idea of marrying you.  Say the word.  Marriage is a
monkey's game.  Say the word.  He will let you go when you've had
enough; and he's had enough.  He is a GENERAL and a very great
jefe.  He can make you monkey-queen of monkey-Mexico, if it please
you.  And what should monkeys do, but amuse themselves!  Vamos!
Embob&eacute;monos!  Shall I be priest?  Vamos!  Vamos!'</p>

<p>He rose with sudden volcanic violence, and rushed away.</p>

<p>Cipriano looked at Kate in wonder.  She had gone pale.</p>

<p>'What have you been saying to him?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing!' she said, rising.  'I'd better go now.'</p>

<p>Juana was collected; and Alonso and Kate set off back down the
lake.  She sat with a certain obstinate offendedness under the
awning of the boat.  The sun was terrifically hot, and the water
blinded her.  She put on black spectacles, in which she looked a
monster.</p>

<p>'Mucho calor, Ni&ntilde;a!  Mucho calor!' Juana was repeating behind her.
The criada had evidently imbibed tepache.</p>

<p>On the pale-brown water little tufts of water-hyacinth were vaguely
sailing, holding up the hand of a leaf for a sail.  Everywhere the
lake was dotted with these sailing tufts.  The heavy rains had
washed in flood down the Lerma river into the lake, washing the
acres of lirio loose from the marshy end of the waters, thirty
miles away, and slowly setting them travelling over all the expanse
of the inland sea, till the shores began to be piled, and the far-
off Santiago river, which flowed out of the lake, was choked.</p>

<p>That day Ram&oacute;n wrote his Fourth Hymn.</p>

<blockquote><div>WHAT QUETZALCOATL SAW IN MEXICO<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Who are these strange faces in Mexico?
Palefaces, yellowfaces, blackfaces?  These are no Mexicans!
Where do they come from, and why?</p>

<p>Lord of the Two Ways, these are the foreigners.
They come out of nowhere.
Sometimes they come to tell us things,
Mostly they are the greedy ones.</p>

<p>What then do they want?</p>

<p>They want gold, they want silver from the mountains,
And oil, much oil from the coast.
They take sugar from the tall tubes of the cane,
Wheat from the high lands, and maize;
Coffee from the bushes in the hot lands, even the juicy rubber.
They put up tall chimneys that smoke,
And in the biggest houses they keep their machines, that talk
And work iron elbows up and down,
And hold myriad threads from their claws!
Wonderful are the machines of the greedy ones!</p>

<p>And you, Mexicans and peons, what do you do?</p>

<p>We work with their machines, we work in their fields,
They give us pesos made of Mexican silver.
They are the clever ones.</p>

<p>Do you love them then?</p>

<p>We love them not, and never.
Their faces are ugly, yet they make wonderful things.
And their wills are like their machines of iron.
What can we do?</p>

<p>I see dark things rushing across the country.</p>

<p>Yea, Lord!  Even trains and camiones and automobiles.</p>

<p>Trains and camiones, automobiles and aeroplanes.
How nice! says the peon, to go rushing in a train!
How nice, to get in the camion, and for twenty centavos, to be
   gone!
How nice, in the great cities, where all things rush, and huge
   lights flare bright, to wander and do nothing!
How nice to sit in the cine, where the picture of all the world
   dances before the eyes!
How nice if we could take all these things away from the
   foreigners, and possess them!
Take back our lands and silver and oil, take the trains and the
   factories and the automobiles
And play with them all the time!
How nice!</p>

<p>Oh, fools!  Mexicans and peons!
Who are you, to be masters of machines which you cannot make?
Which you can only break!
Those that can make are masters of these machines.
Not you, poor boobs.</p>

<p>How have these palefaces, yellowfaces crossed the waters of the
   world?
Oh, fools!  Mexicans and peons, with muddy hearts!
Did they do it by squatting on their hams?
You do nothing but squat on your hams, and stare with vacant eyes,
   and drink fire-waters, and quarrel and stab.
And then run like surly dogs at the bidding of paleface masters.</p>

<p>Oh, dogs and fools, Mexicans and peons!
Watery-hearted, with wishy-washy knees.
Sulky in spirit, and inert.
What are you good for, but to be slaves, and rot away?</p>

<p>You are not worth a god!
Lo! the universe tangles its great dragons,
The dragons in the cosmos are stirring with anger again.
The dragon of the disappointed dead, that sleeps in the snow-white
   north
Is lashing his tail in his sleep; the winds howl, the cold rocks
   round.
The spirits of the cold dead whistle in the ears of the world.
Prepare for doom.</p>

<p>For I tell you, there are no dead dead, not even your dead.
There are dead that sleep in the waves of the Morning Star, with
   freshening limbs.
There are dead that weep in bitter rains.
There are dead that cluster in the frozen north, shuddering and
   chattering among the ice
And howling with hate.
There are dead that creep through the burning bowels of the earth,
Stirring the fires to acid of bitterness.
There are dead that sit under the trees, watching with ash-grey
   eyes for their victims.
There are dead that attack the sun like swarms of black flies, to
   suck his life.
There are dead that stand upon you, when you go in to your women,
And they dart to her womb, they fight for the chance to be born,
   they struggle at the gate you have opened,
They gnash when it closes, and hate the one that got in to be born
   again,
Child of the living dead, the dead that live and are not refreshed.
I tell you, sorrow upon you; you shall all die.
And being dead, you shall not be refreshed.
There are no dead dead.
Being dead, you shall rove like dogs with broken haunches
Seeking the offal and garbage of life, in the invisible lanes of
   the air.</p>

<p>The dead that have mastered fire live on, salamanders, in fire.
The dead of the water-lords rock and glimmer in the seas.
The dead of the steel machines go up in motion, AWAY!
The dead of electric masters are electricity itself.</p>

<p>But the dead of those who have mastered nothing, nothing at all,
Crawl like masterless dogs in the back streets of the air,
Creeping for the garbage of life, and biting with venomous mouths.</p>

<p>Those that have mastered the forces of the world, die into the
   forces, they have homes in death.
But you! what have you mastered, among the dragon hosts of the
   cosmos?
There are dragons of sun and ice, dragons of the moon and the
   earth, dragons of salty waters, dragons of thunder;
There is the spangled dragon of the stars at large.
And far at the centre, with one unblinking eye, the dragon of the
   Morning Star.</p>

<p>Conquer! says the Morning Star.  Pass the dragons, and pass on to me.
For I am sweet, I am the last and the best, the pool of new life.
But lo! you inert ones, I will set the dragons upon you.
They shall crunch your bones.
And even then they shall spit you out, as broken-haunched dogs,
You shall have nowhere to die into.</p>

<p>Lo! in the back streets of the air, dead ones are crawling like
   curs!
Lo! I release the dragons!  The great white one of the north,
Him of the disappointed dead, he is lashing and turning round.
He is breathing cold corruption upon you, you shall bleed in your
   chests.</p>

<p>I am going to speak to the dragon of the inner fires,
He who housels the dead of the guns,
To withdraw his warmth from your feet, so your feet turn cold with
   death.</p>

<p>I am about to tell the dragon of the waters to turn round on you
And spew out corrosion into your streams, on your rains.</p>

<p>And I wait for the final day, when the dragon of thunder, waking
   under the spider-web nets
Which you've thrown upon him, shall suddenly shake with rage,
And dart his electric needles into your bones, and curdle your
   blood like milk with electric venom.</p>

<p>Wait!  Only wait!  Little by little it all shall come upon you.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n put on his black city clothes, and a black hat, and went
himself with this hymn to the printer in the city.  The sign of
Quetzalcoatl he had printed in black and red, and the sign of the
dragon, at the end, in green and black and red.  And the sheet was
folded.</p>

<p>Six soldiers of Cipriano's command took the bundles of hymns by
train; one to the capital, one to Puebla and Jalapa, one to Tampico
and Monterrey, one to Torreon and Chihuahua, one to Sinaloa and
Sonora, and one to the mines in Pachucha, Guanajuato, and the
central region.  Each soldier took only a hundred sheets.  But in
every town there was a recognized Reader of the Hymns; or two, or
three, or four, or even ten Readers in one city.  And readers who
went round to the villages.</p>

<p>Because there was a strange, submerged desire in the people for
things beyond the world.  They were weary of events, and weary of
news and the newspapers, weary even of the things that are taught
in education.  Weary is the spirit of man with man's importunity.
Of all things human, and humanly invented, we have had enough, they
seemed to say.  And though they took not much active notice of the
Hymns, they craved for them, as men crave for alcohol, as a relief
from the weariness and ennui of mankind's man-made world.</p>

<p>Everywhere, in all the towns and villages, at night-time the little
flames would be seen flickering, a cluster of people was seen,
sometimes standing, sometimes sitting upon the ground, listening to
the slow voice of some Reader.</p>

<p>More rarely, in some small, out-of-the-way plaza, would sound the
sinister thud of the tom-tom, beating out of the hollow of the
ages.  And there would be two men with white serapes with the blue
edges.  Then the singing of the Songs of Quetzalcoatl, and perhaps
the slow round dance, with the ancient rhythm of the feet on the
earth, belonging to aboriginal America.</p>

<p>For the old dances of the Aztecs and the Zapotees, of all the
submerged Indian races, are based upon the old, sinking bird-step
of the Red Indians of the north.  It is in the blood of the people;
they cannot quite forget it.  It comes back to them, with a sense
of fear, and joy, and relief.</p>

<p>Of themselves, they dared not revive the old motion, nor stir the
blood in the old way.  The spell of the past is too terrible.  But
in the Songs and the Hymns of Quetzalcoatl there spoke a new voice,
the voice of a master and authority.  And though they were slow to
trust, the slowest and the most untrusting, they seized upon the
new-old thrill, with a certain fear, and joy, and relief.</p>

<p>The Men of Quetzalcoatl avoided the great market-places and centres
of activity.  They took their stand in the little side places.  On
the rim of a fountain a man in a dark blanket with blue borders, or
with the sign of Quetzalcoatl in his hat, would sit down and begin
to read aloud.  It was enough.  The people lingered to listen.  He
would read to the end, then say:  'I have finished this reading of
the Fourth Hymn of Quetzalcoatl.  Now I will begin again.'</p>

<p>In this way, by a sort of far-away note in the voice, and by the
slow monotony of repetition, the thing would drift darkly into the
consciousness of the listeners.</p>

<p>Already in the beginning there had been the scandal of the Judases.
Holy Week, in Mexico City, is, to all appearance, the great week of
Judas.  Everywhere you see men carrying home in triumph the great,
gaudily-varnished dolls of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;.  They are all men-dolls,
more or less life-like grotesque.  Most frequently it is a fat
Mexican-Spanish hacendado, landowner and big farmer, who is
represented with his tight trousers, sticking-out belly, and huge
upturned moustaches.  The old-fashioned patr&oacute;n.  Some of the
figures are like Punch, some are like harlequin.  But they all have
rosy faces and the white man's get-up.  You never see the dark-
faced image of a native-blooded Mexican; always a stiff, haughty
grotesque of a white man.</p>

<p>And all these are Judases.  Judas is the fun of the fair, the
victim, the big man of Holy Week, just as the Skeleton, and the
skeleton on horseback, is the idol of the first week in November,
the days of the dead and of all the saints.</p>

<p>On Easter Saturday the Judases are hung from the balconies, the
string is lighted, and at length, bang!  Shrieks of joy, Judas has
exploded into nothingness, from a big cracker in the middle of
him! - All the town is popping with Judases.</p>

<p>There was the scandal of the Holy Images thrown out of one of the
churches in Mexico City, and these Judases put in their place.  The
Church began to move.</p>

<p>But then the Church in Mexico has to move gingerly; it is not
popular, and its claws are cut.  The priest may not ring the church
bells for more than three minutes.  Neither priests nor monks may
wear any habit in the street, beyond the hideous black vest and
white collar of the Protestant clergy.  So that the priest shows
himself as little as possible in the street, and practically never
in the chief streets and the chief plazas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he still has influence.  Processions in the streets
are forbidden, but not sermons from the pulpit, nor advice from the
confessional.  Montes, the President, had no love for the Church,
and was meditating the expulsion of all foreign priests.  The
Archbishop himself was an Italian.  But he was also a fighter.</p>

<p>He gave orders to all the priests, to forbid the people from
listening to anything concerned with Quetzalcoatl, to destroy any
hymn-sheet that might fall into their hands, and to prevent as far
as possible the Hymns from being read, and the Songs from being
sung, in the parishes.</p>

<p>But Montes had given orders to the police and the military to
afford such protection to the Men of Quetzalcoatl as was accorded
to any other law-abiding citizen.</p>

<p>Mexico is not Mexico for nothing, however, and already blood had
been shed on both sides.  This Ram&oacute;n particularly wanted to avoid,
as he felt that violent death was not so easily wiped out of the
air and out of the souls of men, as spilt blood was washed off the
pavements.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he was in the City, he asked the Bishop of the West
if he would consent to an interview with himself and Don Cipriano,
and would he name the place.  The Bishop - who was an old friend and
adviser of Carlota, and who knew Ram&oacute;n well enough - replied that he
would be pleased to see Don Ram&oacute;n and the Se&ntilde;or General the next
day, if they would be so good as to come to his house.</p>

<p>The Bishop no longer occupied the great episcopal palace.  This was
turned into the post-office building.  But he had a large house not
far from the Cathedral, which had been presented by the faithful.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n and Cipriano found the thin old man in a dusty, uninteresting
library, waiting.  He wore a simple black cassock, not too clean,
with purple buttons.  He received Ram&oacute;n, who was in a black town
suit, and Cipriano, who was in uniform, with an affable manner and
suspicious looks.  But he played at being the lively, genial old
bird.</p>

<p>'Ah, Don Ram&oacute;n, it is long since I saw you!  How goes it, eh?
Well, well?  That is good!  That is very good!'  And he patted
Ram&oacute;n on the sleeve like a fussy old uncle.  'Ah, my General, much
honour, much honour!  Welcome to this poor house of yours.  It is
the house of your Honour!  To serve you!  Gentlemen!  Won't you
take a seat?'</p>

<p>They all sat down, in the dusty, dreary room, in the old leather
chairs.  The Bishop nervously looked at his thin old hands, at the
fine, but rather dull amethyst ring he wore.</p>

<p>'Good!  Se&ntilde;ores!' he said, glancing up with his little black eyes.
'At your service!  Entirely at the service of your Honours.'</p>

<p>'Do&ntilde;a Carlota is in the city, Father.  You have seen her?' said
Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'Yes, son of mine,' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'Then you know the latest news about me.  She told you everything.'</p>

<p>'Somewhat!  Somewhat!  She spoke somewhat of you, the poor little
thing.  Thanks to God she has her sons with her.  They are safely
back in their native country, in good health.'</p>

<p>'Did you see them?'</p>

<p>'Yes! yes!  Two of my dearest children!  Very sympathetic, very
intelligent, like their father; and, like him, promising to be of
very handsome presence.  Yes! yes!  Smoke if you will, my General.
Don't hesitate.'</p>

<p>Cipriano lit a cigarette.  From old associations, he was nervous,
albeit amused.</p>

<p>'You know all about what I want to do, Father?' said Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'I don't know all, son of mine, but I know enough.  I wouldn't want
to hear more.  Eh!' he sighed.  'It is very sad.'</p>

<p>'Not so very sad, Father, if we don't make it sad.  Why make a sad
thing out of it, Father?  We are in Mexico for the most part
Indians.  They cannot understand the high Christianity, Father, and
the Church knows it.  Christianity is a religion of the spirit, and
must needs be understood if it is to have any effect.  The Indians
cannot understand it, any more than the rabbits of the hills.'</p>

<p>'Very good!  Very good!  Son of mine!  But we can convey it to
them.  The rabbits of the hills are in the hands of God.'</p>

<p>'No, Father, it is impossible.  And without a religion that will
connect them with the universe, they will all perish.  Only
religion will serve; not socialism, nor education, nor anything.'</p>

<p>'Thou speakest well,' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'The rabbits of the hills may be in the hands of God, Father.  But
they are at the mercy of men.  The same with Mexico.  The people
sink heavier and heavier into inertia, and the Church cannot help
them, because the Church does not possess the key-word to the
Mexican soul.'</p>

<p>'Doesn't the Mexican soul know the Voice of God?' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'Your own children may know your voice, Father.  But if you go out
to speak to the birds on the lake, or the deer among the mountains,
will they know your voice?  Will they wait and listen?'</p>

<p>'Who knows?  It is said they waited to listen to the Holy Francisco
of Assisi.'</p>

<p>'Now, Father, we must speak to the Mexicans in their own language,
and give them the clue-word to their own souls.  I shall say
Quetzalcoatl.  If I am wrong, let me perish.  But I am not wrong.'</p>

<p>The Bishop fidgeted rather restlessly.  He didn't want to hear all
this.  And he did not want to answer.  He was impotent anyhow.</p>

<p>'Your Church is the Catholic Church, Father?'</p>

<p>'Surely!' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'And Catholic Church means the Church of All, the Universal
Church?'</p>

<p>'Surely, son of mine.'</p>

<p>'Then why not let it be really catholic?  Why call it catholic,
when it is not only just one among many Churches, but is even
hostile to all the rest of the churches?  Father, why not let the
Catholic Church become really the Universal Church?'</p>

<p>'It is the Universal Church of Christ, my son.'</p>

<p>'Why not let it be the Universal Church of Mohammed as well; since
ultimately, God is One God, but the peoples speak varying
languages, and each needs its own prophet to speak with its own
tongue.  The Universal Church of Christ, and Mohammed, and Buddha,
and Quetzalcoatl, and all the others - THAT would be a Catholic
Church, Father.'</p>

<p>'You speak of things beyond me,' said the Bishop, turning his ring.</p>

<p>'Not beyond any man,' said Don Ram&oacute;n.  'A Catholic Church is a
church of all the religions, a home on earth for all the prophets
and the Christs, a big tree under which every man who acknowledges
the greater life of the soul can sit and be refreshed.  Isn't THAT
the Catholic Church, Father?'</p>

<p>'Alas, my son, I know the Apostolic Church of Christ in Rome, of
which I am a humble servant.  I do not understand these clever
things you are saying to me.'</p>

<p>'I am asking you for peace, Father.  I am not one who hates the
Church of Christ, the ROMAN Catholic Church.  But in Mexico I think
it has no place.  When my heart is not bitter, I am grateful
forever to Christ, the Son of God.  The affair of the Judases
grieves me more than it does you, and the affairs of bloodshed are
far bitterer to me.'</p>

<p>'I am no innovator, my son, to provoke bloodshed.'</p>

<p>'Listen!  I am going to remove the holy images from the church at
Sayula, with reverence, and with reverence burn them upon the lake.
Then I shall put the image of Quetzalcoatl in the church at
Sayula.'</p>

<p>The Bishop looked up furtively.  For some moments he said nothing.
But his silence was furtive, cornered.</p>

<p>'Would you dare do that, Don Ram&oacute;n?' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes!  And I shall not be prevented.  General Viedma is with me.'</p>

<p>The Bishop glanced sideways at Cipriano.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said Cipriano.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless it is illegal,' said the Bishop, with acid
bitterness.</p>

<p>'What is illegal in Mexico?' said Ram&oacute;n.  'What is weak is illegal.
I will not be weak, My Lord.'</p>

<p>'Lucky you!' said the Bishop, lifting his shoulders.</p>

<p>There was a break of silence.</p>

<p>'No!' said Ram&oacute;n.  'I come to ask you for peace.  Tell the
Archbishop what I say.  Let him tell the Cardinals and the Pope
that the time has come for a Catholic Church of the Earth, the
Catholic Church of All the Sons of Men.  The Saviours are more than
one, and let us pray they will still be increased.  But God is one
God, and the Saviours are the Sons of the One God.  Let the Tree of
the Church spread its branches over all the earth, and shelter the
prophets in its shade, as they sit and speak their knowledge of the
beyond.'</p>

<p>'Are you one of these prophets, Don Ram&oacute;n?'</p>

<p>'I surely am, Father.  And I would speak about Quetzalcoatl in
Mexico, and build his Church here.'</p>

<p>'Nay!  You would invade the Churches of Christ and the Blessed
Virgin, I heard you say.'</p>

<p>'You know my intentions.  But I do not want to quarrel with the
Church of Rome, nor have bloodshed and enmity, Father.  Can you not
understand me?  Should there not be peace between the men who
strive down their different ways to the God-Mystery?'</p>

<p>'Once more desecrate the altars!  Bring in strange idols.  Burn the
images of Our Lord and Our Lady, and ask for peace?' said the poor
Bishop, who helplessly longed to be left alone.</p>

<p>'All that, Father,' said Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'Son, what can I answer?  You are a good man smitten with the
madness of pride.  Don Cipriano is one more Mexican general.  I am
the poor old Bishop of this diocese, faithful servant of the Holy
Church, humble child of the Holy Father in Rome.  What can I do?
What can I answer?  Take me out to the cemetery and shoot me at
once, General!'</p>

<p>'I don't want to,' said Cipriano.</p>

<p>'It will end like that,' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>'But why?' cried Don Ram&oacute;n.  'Is there no sense in what I say?
Cannot you understand?'</p>

<p>'My son, my understanding goes no farther than my faith, my duty,
will allow.  I am not a clever man, I live by faith and my duty to
my sacred office.  Understand that I do not understand.'</p>

<p>'Good-day, Father!' said Ram&oacute;n, suddenly rising.</p>

<p>'Go with God, my son,' said the Bishop, rising and lifting his
fingers.</p>

<p>'Adi&oacute;s, Se&ntilde;or!' said Cipriano, clicking his spurs, and putting his
hand on his sword as he turned to the door.</p>

<p>'Adi&oacute;s, Se&ntilde;or General,' said the Bishop, darting after them his
eyes of old malice, which they could feel in their backs.</p>

<p>'He will say nothing,' said Cipriano, as he and Ram&oacute;n went down the
steps.  'The old Jesuit, he only wants to keep his job and his
power, and prevent the heart's beating.  I know them.  All they
treasure, even more than their money, is their centipede power over
the frightened people; especially over the women.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know you hated them,' laughed Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'Waste no more breath on them, my dear one,' said Cipriano.  'Go
forward, you can walk over broken snakes such as those.'</p>

<p>As they went on foot past the post-office square, where the modern
scribes at little tables under the arches sat tapping out letters
on their typewriters for the poor and illiterate, who waited with
their few centavos to have their messages turned into florid
Castilian, Ram&oacute;n and Cipriano met with an almost startled respect.</p>

<p>'Why talk to the Bishop? - he doesn't exist any more.  I hear his
Knights of Cort&eacute;s had a big dinner the other evening, and it is
said - I don't believe it - that they drank oaths in blood to have my
life and yours.  But I think the oaths of the Catholic Dames would
frighten me more.  Why, if a man stops to unfasten his trousers to
make water, the Knights of Cort&eacute;s run for their lives, thinking the
pistol is pointed at them.  Don't think about them, man!  Don't try
to conciliate them.  They will only puff up and become insolent,
thinking you are afraid of them.  Six soldiers will trample down
all that dirt,' said the General.</p>

<p>It was the city, and the spirit of the city.</p>

<p>Cipriano had a suite in the big Palace on the Plaza de Armas.</p>

<p>'If I marry,' he said, as they passed into the stone patio, where
soldiers stood at attention, 'I shall take a house in the colony,
to be more private.'</p>

<p>Cipriano in town was amusing.  He seemed to exude pride and
arrogant authority as he walked about.  But his black eyes,
glancing above his fine nose and that little goat beard, were not
to be laughed at.  They seemed to get everything, in the stab of a
glance.  A demoniacal little fellow.</p>
