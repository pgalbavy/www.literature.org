<p>Early in April C. Bailey, Jr., overdrew his account, was politely
notified of that oversight by the bank. He hunted about, casually,
for stray funds, but to his intense surprise discovered nothing
immediately available.</p>

<p>Which annoyed him, and he explained the situation to his father;
who demanded further and sordidly searching explanations concerning
the expenditure on his son's part of an income more than adequate
for any unmarried young man.</p>

<p>They undertook this interesting line of research together, but
there came a time in the proceedings when C. Bailey, Jr., betrayed
violent inclinations toward reticence, non-communication, and
finally secrecy; in fact he declined to proceed any further or
to throw any more light upon his reasons for not proceeding, which
symptoms were characteristic and perfectly familiar to his father.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," concluded Bailey, Sr., "you have been throwing
away your income on that Greensleeve girl! What is she&mdash;your private
property?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, steadily enough. Bailey, Sr.,
said: "If <em>that's</em> the case&mdash;why in the name of common
sense do you spend so much money on her?" Na√Øve logic on the part
of Bailey, Sr., Clive replied:</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose I was spending very much. I like her. I like
her better than any other girl. She is really wonderful, father.
You won't believe it if I say she is charming, well-bred, clever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>&mdash;"And," continued Clive&mdash;"absolutely unselfish and non-mercenary."</p>

<p>"If she's all that, too, it certainly seems to pay her&mdash;materially
speaking."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," said his son patiently. "From the very
beginning of our friendship it has been very difficult for me
to make her accept anything&mdash;even when she was in actual need.
Our friendship is not on <em>that</em> basis. She doesn't care
for me because of what I do for her. It may surprise you to hear
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My son, nothing surprises me any more, not even virtue and honesty.
This girl may be all you think her. Personally I never met any
like her, but I've read about them in sentimental fiction. No
doubt there's a basis for such popular heroines. There may have
been such paragons. There may be yet. Perhaps you've collided
with one of these feminine curiosities."</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"All right, Clive. Only, why linger longer in the side-show than
the price of admission warrants? The main tent awaits you. In
more modern metaphor; it's the same film every hour, every day,
the same orchestrion, the same environment. You've seen enough.
There's nothing more&mdash;if I clearly understand your immaculate
intentions. Do I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Clive, reddening.</p>

<p>"All right; there's nothing more, then. It's time to retire.
You've had your amusement, and you've paid for it like a gentleman&mdash;very
much like a gentleman&mdash;rather exorbitantly. That's the way a gentleman
always pays. So now suppose you return to your own sort and coyly
reappear amid certain circles recently neglected, and which, at
one period of your career, you permitted yourself to embellish
and adorn with your own surpassing personality."</p>

<p>They both laughed; there had been, always, a very tolerant understanding
between them.</p>

<p>Then Clive's face grew graver.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "I've tried remaining away. It doesn't do
any good. The longer I stay away from her, the more anxious I
am to go back.... It's really friendship I tell you."</p>

<p>"You're not in love with her, are you, Clive?"</p>

<p>The son hesitated: "No!... No, I can't be. I'm very certain that
I am not."</p>

<p>"What would you do if you were?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What would you <em>do</em> about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Marry her?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that!" muttered Clive, startled. Then he remained
silent, his mind crowded with the component parts of that vague
sum-total which had so startled him at the idea of marrying Athalie
Greensleeve.</p>

<p>Partly his father's blunt question had jarred him, partly the
idea of marrying anybody at all. Also the mere idea of the storm
such a proceeding would raise in the world he inhabited, his mother
being the storm-centre, dispensing anathema, thunder, and lightning,
appalled him.</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do <em>that</em>," he repeated, gazing rather blankly
at his father.</p>

<p>"You could if you <em>had</em> to," said his father, curtly.
"But I take your word it couldn't come to that."</p>

<p>The boy flushed hotly, but said nothing. He shrank from comprehending
such an impossible situation, ashamed for himself, ashamed for
Athalie, resenting even the exaggerated and grotesque possibility
of such a thing&mdash;such a monstrous and horrible thing playing any
part in her life or in his.</p>

<p>The frankness and cynicism of Bailey, Sr., had possibly been
pushed too far. Clive became restless; and the calm entente cordiale
ended for a while.</p>

<p>Ended also his visits to Athalie for a while, the paternal conversation
having, somehow, chilled his desire to see her and spoiled, for
the time anyway, any pleasure in being with her.</p>

<p>Also his father offered to help him out financially; and, somehow,
he felt as though Bailey, Sr., was paying for his own gifts to
Athalie. Which idea mortified him, and he resolved to remain away
from her until he recovered his self-respect&mdash;which would be duly
recovered, he felt certain, when the next coupons fell due and
he could detach them and extinguish the parental loan.</p>

<p>For a week or two he did not even wish to see her, so ashamed
and sullied did he feel after the way his father had handled and
bruised the delicate situation, and the name of the young girl
who so innocently adorned it.</p>

<p>No, something had been spoiled for him, temporarily. He felt
it. Something of the sweetness, the innocence, the candour of
this blameless friendship had been marred. The bloom was rubbed
off; the piquant freshness and fragrance gone for the present.</p>

<p>It is true that an unexpected boom in his business kept him and
his father almost feverishly active and left them both fatigued
at night. This lasted for a week or two&mdash;long enough to excite
all real estate men with a hope for future prosperity not yet
entirely dead. But at the end of two or three weeks that hope
began to die its usual, lingering death.</p>

<p>Dulness set in; the talk was of Harlem, Westchester, and the
Bronx: a private bank failed, then three commercial houses went
to the wall; and a seat was sold for $25,000 on the Exchange.
Business resumed its normal and unexaggerated course. The days
of boom were surely ended; and vacant lots on Fifth Avenue threatened
to remain vacant for a while longer.</p>

<p>Clive began to drop in at his clubs again. One was a Whipper-Snapper
Club to which young Manhattan aspired when freshly released from
college; the others were of the fashionable and semi-fashionable
sort, tedious, monotonous, full of the aimless, the idle, or of
that bustling and showy smartness which is perhaps even less admirable
and less easy to endure.</p>

<p>Men destitute of mental resources and dependent upon others for
their amusement, disillusioned men, lazy men, socially ambitious
men, men gluttonously or alcoholically predisposed haunted these
clubs. To one of them repaired those who were inclined to racquettes,
squash, tennis, and the swimming tank. It was a sort of social
clearing house for other clubs.</p>

<p>But The Geyser was the least harmless of the clubs affected by
C. Bailey, Jr.,&mdash;it being an all-night resort and the haunt of
the hopeless sport. Here dissipation, futile, aimless, meaningless,
was on its native heath. Here, on his own stamping ground, prowled
the youthful scion of many a dissipated race&mdash;nouveau riche and
Knickerbocker alike. All that was required of anybody was money
and a depthless capacity.</p>

<p>It was in this place that Clive encountered Cecil Reeve one stormy
midnight.</p>

<p>"You don't come here often, do you?" said the latter.</p>

<p>Clive said he didn't.</p>

<p>"Neither do I. But when I do there's a few doing. Will you have
a high one, Clive? In deference to our late and revered university?"</p>

<p>Clive would so far consent to degrade himself for the honour
of Alma Mater.</p>

<p>There was much honour done her that evening.</p>

<p>Toward the beginning of the end Clive said: "I can't sit up all
night, Cecil. What do you do for a living, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Bank a bit."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "It was in this place that Clive encountered Cecil
Reeve one stormy midnight."]</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just amusement. What do you work at?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that kind of bank!" said Reeve, annoyed. All sense
of humour fled him when hammerlocked with Bacchus. At such psychological
moments, too, he became indiscreet. And now he proposed to Clive
an excursion amid what he termed the "high lights of Olympus,"
which the latter discouraged.</p>

<p>"All right then. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give a Byzantine
party! I know a little girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!"</p>

<p>"She's a fine little girl, Clive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is no hour to send out invitations."</p>

<p>"Why not? Her name is Catharine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dry up!"</p>

<p>"Catharine Greensleeve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. She's a model at Winton's joint. She's a peach. Appropriately
crowned with roses she might have presided for Lucullus."</p>

<p>Clive said: "By that you mean she's all right, don't you? You'd
better mean it anyway!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. I know her sister. She's a charming girl. All
of them are all right. You understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I understand numerous things. One of 'em's Catharine Greensleeve.
And she's some plum, believe <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, too, so stop talking about it!" retorted Clive
sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure it's all right. Don't worry, just because you know her
sister, will you?"</p>

<p>Clive shrugged. Reeve was in a troublesome mood, and he left
him and went home feeling vaguely irritated and even less inclined
than ever to see Athalie; which state of mind perplexed and irritated
him still further.</p>

<p>He went to one or two dances during the week&mdash;a thing he had
not done lately. Then he went to several more; also to a number
of d√©butante theatre parties and to several suppers. He rather
liked being with his own sort again; the comfortable sense of
home-coming, of conventionalism, of a pleasant social security,
appealed to him after several months' irresponsible straying from
familiar paths. And he began to go about the sheep-walks and enjoy
it, slipping back rather easily into accustomed places and relations
with men and women who belonged in a world never entered, never
seen by Athalie Greensleeve, and of the existence of which she
was aware only through the daily papers.</p>

<p>He wrote to her now and then. Always she answered his letter
the following day.</p>

<p>About the end of April he wrote:</p>

<p>   "<em>DEAR ATHALIE</em>,</p>

<p>   "About everything seems to conspire to keep me from seeing   
you; business&mdash;in a measure,&mdash;social duties; and, to tell the   
truth, a mistaken but strenuous opposition on my mother's    part.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"She doesn't know you, and refuses to. But she knows me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ought to infer everything delightful in the girl who has<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become my friend. Because she knows that I don't, and never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did affect the other sort.

</p>
</div>

<p>   "Every day, recently, she has asked me whether I have seen   
you. To avoid unpleasant discussions I haven't gone to see   
you. But I am going to as soon as this unreasonable alarm    concerning
us blows over.</p>

<p>   "It seems very deplorable to me that two young people cannot   
enjoy an absolutely honest friendship unsuspected and    undisturbed.</p>

<p>   "I miss you a lot. Is the apartment comfortable? Does Michael   
do everything you wish? Did the cat prove a good one? I sent   
for the best Angora to be had from the Silver Cloud Cattery.</p>

<p>   "Now tell me, Athalie, what can I do for you? <em>Please!</em>
What    is it you need; what is it you would like to have? Are
you    saving part of your salary?</p>

<p>   "Tell me also what you do with yourself after business hours.   
Have you seen any shows? I suppose you go out with your    sisters
now and then.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"As for me I go about more or less. For a while I didn't:<br/>
business seemed to revive and everybody in real estate became<br/>
greatly excited. But it all simmered down again to the usual<br/>
routine. So I've been going about to various affairs, dances<br/>
and things. And, consequently, there's peace and quiet at<br/>
home for me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always yours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C <em>BAILEY, JR</em>."

<p>
"<em>P.S. </em>As I sit here writing you the desire seizes me to drop<br/>
my pen, put on my hat and coat and go to see you. But I<br/>
can't. There's a dinner on here, and I've got to stay for it.<br/>
Good night, dear Athalie!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>CLIVE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>His answer came by return mail as usual:</p>

<p>   "<em>DEAR CLIVE</em>,</p>

<p>   "Your letter has troubled me so much. If your mother feels   
that way about me, what are we to do? Is it right for us to   
see each other?</p>

<p>   "It is true that I am not conscious of any wrong in seeing   
you and in being your friend. I know that I never had an    unworthy
thought concerning you. And I feel confident that    your thoughts
regarding our friendship and me are blameless.    Where lies the
wrong?</p>

<p>   "<em>Some</em> aspects of the affair <em>have</em> troubled
me lately.    Please do not be sensitive and take offence, Clive,
if I    admit to you that I never have quite reconciled myself
to    accepting anything from you.</p>

<p>   "What I have accepted has been for your own sake&mdash;for the   
pleasure you found in giving, not for my own sake.</p>

<p>   "I wanted only your friendship. That was enough&mdash;more than   
enough to make me happy and contented.</p>

<p>   "I was not in want; I had sufficient; I lived better than
I    had ever lived; I was self-reliant, self-supporting,    and&mdash;forgive
and understand me, Clive&mdash;a little more    self-respecting than
I now am.</p>

<p>   "It is true I had saved very little; but I am young and life   
is before me.</p>

<p>   "This seems very ungrateful of me, very ungenerous after all   
you have done for me&mdash;all I have taken from you.</p>

<p>   "But, Clive, it is the truth, and I think it ought to be   
told. Because this is, and has always been, a source of    self-reproach
to me, whether rightly or wrongly, I don't    know. I am a novice
at confession, but I feel that, if I am    to make a clean breast
to you, partial confession is not    worth while, not really honest,
not worthy of the very sacred    friendship that inspires it.</p>

<p>   "So I shall shrive myself as well as I know how and continue   
to admit to you my further doubts and misgivings. They are   
these: my sisters do not understand your friendship for me   
even if they understand mine for you&mdash;which they say they do.</p>

<p>   "I don't think they believe me dishonest; but they cannot
see    any reason for your generosity to me unless you ultimately   
expect me to be dishonest.</p>

<p>   "This has weakened my influence with them. I know I am the   
youngest, yet until recently I had a certain authority in    matters
regarding the common welfare and the common policy.    But this
is nearly gone. They point out with perfect truth    that I myself
do, with you, the very things for which I    criticise them and
against which I warn them.</p>

<p>   "Of course the radical difference is that I do these things   
with <em>you</em>; but they can't understand why you are any better,   
any finer, any more admirable, any further to be trusted than   
the men they go about with alone.</p>

<p>   "It is quite in vain that I explain to them what sort of man   
you are. They retort that I merely <em>think</em> so.</p>

<p>   "There is a man who takes Catharine out more frequently, and   
keeps her out much later than I like. I mean Cecil Reeve. But   
what I say only makes my sister sullen. She knows he is a    friend
of yours.... And, Clive, I am rather afraid she is    beginning
to care more for him than is quite safe for her to    ever care
for any man of that class.</p>

<p>   "And Doris has met other men of the same kind    &mdash;I
don't know    who they are, for she won't tell me. But after the
theatre    she goes out with them; and it is doing her no good.</p>

<p>   "There is only one more item in my confession, then I'm done.</p>

<p>   "It is this: I have heard recently from various sources that   
my being seen with you so frequently is causing much gossip   
concerning you among your friends.</p>

<p>   "Is this true? And if it is, will it damage you? I don't care   
about myself. I know very few people and it doesn't matter.   
Besides I care enough about our companionship to continue it,   
whatever untruths are said or thought about me. But how about   
<em>you</em>, Clive? Because I also care enough for you to give
you    up if my being seen with you is going to disgrace you.</p>

<p>   "This is my confession. I have told you all. Now, could you   
tell me what it is best for us to do?</p>

<p>   "Think clearly; act wisely; don't even dream of sacrificing   
yourself with your usual generosity&mdash;if it is indeed to be a   
case for self-sacrifice. Let me do that by giving you up. I   
shall do it anyway if ever I am convinced that my    companionship
is hurting your reputation.</p>

<p>   "Be just to us both by being frank with me. Your decision   
shall be my law.</p>

<p>   "This is a long, long letter. I can't seem to let it go to   
you&mdash;as though when I mail it I am snapping one more bond    that
still seems to hold us together.</p>

<p>   "My daily life is agreeable if a trifle monotonous. I have   
been out two or three times, once to see the Morgan    Collection
at the Metropolitan Museum&mdash;very dazzling and    wonderful. What
strange thoughts it evoked in me&mdash;thrilling,    delightful, exhilarating&mdash;as
though inspiring me to some    blind effort or other. Isn't it
ridiculous?&mdash;as though <em>I</em>    had it in me to do anything
or be anybody! I'm merely telling    you how all that exquisite
art affected me&mdash;<em>me</em>&mdash;a working    girl. And Oh, Clive!
I don't think anything ever gave me as    much pleasure as did
the paintings by the French masters,    Lancret, Drouais, and
Fragonard! (You see I had a catalogue!)</p>

<p>   "Another evening I went out with Catharine. Mr. Reeve asked   
us, and another man. We went to see 'Once Upon a Time' at the   
Half-Moon Theatre, and afterward we went to supper at the    Caf√©
Columbine.</p>

<p>   "Another evening the other man, Mr. Reeve's friend, a Mr.   
Hargrave, asked me to see 'Under the Sun' at the Zig-Zag    Theatre.
It was a tiresome show. We went to supper afterward    to meet
Catharine and Mr. Reeve.</p>

<p>   "That is all except that I've dined out once or twice with   
Mr. Hargrave. And, somehow or other I felt queer and even    conspicuous
going to the Regina with him and to other places    where you
and I have been so often together...Also I felt a    little depressed.
Everything always reminded me of you and of    happy evenings
with you. I can't seem to get used to going    about with other
men. But they seem to be very nice, very    kind, and very amusing.</p>

<p>   "And a girl ought to be thankful to almost anybody who will   
take her out of her monotony.</p>

<p>   "I'm afraid you've given me a taste for luxury and amusement.   
You <em>have</em> spoiled me I fear. I am certainly an ungrateful   
little beast, am I not, to lay the blame on you! But it is   
dull, Clive, after working all day to sit every evening    reading
alone, or lie on the bed and stare at the ceiling,    waiting
for the others to come home.</p>

<p>   "If it were not for that darling cat you gave me I'd perish   
of sheer solitude. But he is such a comfort, Hafiz; and his   
eyes are the bluest blue and his long, winter fur the    snowiest
white, and his ruff is wonderful and his tail    magnificent.
Also he is <em>very</em> affectionate to me. For which,    with
perfect reverence, I venture to thank God.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Good night, Clive. If you've struggled through this letter<br/>
so far you won't mind reading that I am faithfully and always<br/>
your friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>ATHALIE GREENSLEEVE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>Her letter thoroughly aroused Clive and he was all for going
straight to her&mdash;only he couldn't go that evening because he dared
not break a dinner engagement or fail to appear with his mother
at the opera. In fact he was already involved in a mess of social
obligations for two weeks ahead,&mdash;not an evening free&mdash;and Athalie
worked during the day.</p>

<p>It gave him an odd, restless sensation to hear of her going about
with Francis Hargrave&mdash;dining alone with him. He felt almost hurt
as though she had done him a personal injustice, yet he knew that
it was absurd for him to resent anything of that sort. His monopoly
of her happened to be one merely because she, at that time, knew
no other man of his sort, and would not go out with any other
kind of man.</p>

<p>Why should he expect her to remain eternally isolated except
when he chose to take her out? No young girl could endure that
sort of thing too long. Certainly Athalie was inevitably destined
to meet other men, be admired, admire in her turn, accept invitations.
She was unusually beautiful,&mdash;a charming, intelligent, clean-cut,
healthy young girl. She required companionship and amusement;
she would be unhuman if she didn't.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;men were men. And safe and sane friendships between men
of his own caste, and girls like Athalie Greensleeve, were rare.</p>

<p>Clive chafed and became restive and morose. In vain he repeated
to himself that what Athalie was doing was perfectly natural.
But it didn't make the idea of her going out with other men any
more attractive to him.</p>

<p>His clever mother, possibly aware of what ferment was working
in her son, watched him out of the tail of her ornamental eyes,
but wisely let him alone to fidget his own way out of it. She
had heard that the Greensleeve girl was raising hob with Cecil
Reeve and Francis Hargrave. They were other people's sons, however.
And it might have worked itself out of Clive&mdash;this restless ferment
which soured his mind and gave him an acid satisfaction in being
anything but cordial in his own family circle.</p>

<p>But there was a girl&mdash;a d√©butante, very desirable for Clive his
mother thought&mdash;one Winifred Stuart&mdash;and very delightful to look
upon.</p>

<p>And Clive had seen just enough of her to like her exceedingly;
and, at dances, had even wandered about to look for her, and had
evinced boredom and dissatisfaction when she had not been present.</p>

<p>Which inspired his mother to give a theatre party for little
Miss Stuart and two dozen other youngsters, and a supper at the
Regina afterward.</p>

<p>It was an excellent idea; and it went as wrong as such excellent
ideas so often go. For as Clive in company with the others sauntered
into the splendid reception room of the Regina, he saw Athalie
come in with a man whom he had never before seen.</p>

<p>The shock of recognition&mdash;for it was a shock&mdash;was mutual. Athalie's
dark eyes widened and a little colour left her cheeks: and Clive
reddened painfully.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, scarcely the thing to do, but as she advanced
he stepped forward, and their hands met.</p>

<p>"I am so very glad to see you again," he said.</p>

<p>"I too, Clive. Are you well?"</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Quite," she hesitated; there was a moment's pause while the
two men looked coolly at each other.</p>

<p>"May I present Mr. Bailey, Captain Dane?" Further she did not
account for Captain Dane, who presently took her off somewhere
leaving Clive to return to his smiling but enraged mother.</p>

<p>Never had he found any supper party so noisy, so mirthless, and
so endless. Half the time he didn't know what he was saying to
Winifred Stuart or to anybody else. Nor could he seem to see anybody
very distinctly, for the mental phantoms of Athalie and Captain
Dane floated persistently before him, confusing everything at
moments except the smiling and deadly glance of his mother.</p>

<p>Afterward they went to their various homes in various automobiles,
and Clive was finally left with his mother in his own drawing-room.</p>

<p>"What you did this evening," she said to her son, "was not exactly
the thing to do under the circumstances, Clive."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked wearily as her maid relieved her of her sables
and lace hood.</p>

<p>"Because it was not necessary.... That girl you spoke to was
the Greensleeve girl I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Athalie Greensleeve."</p>

<p>"Who was the man?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;a Captain Dane I believe."</p>

<p>"Wasn't a civil bow enough?"</p>

<p>"Enough? Perhaps; I don't know, mother. I don't seem to know
how much is due her from me. She's never had anything from me
so far&mdash;anything worth having&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Clive."</p>

<p>He said, absently: "It's too late for such advice! I <em>am</em>
a fool. And I don't quite understand how not to be one."</p>

<p>His mother, rather fearful of arousing in him any genuine emotion,
discreetly kissed him good night.</p>

<p>"You're a slightly romantic boy," she said. "There is nothing
else the matter with you."</p>

<p>They mounted the velvet-covered stairway together, her arm around
his neck, his encircling a slender, pliant waist that a girl of
sixteen might have envied. Her maid followed with furs and hood.</p>

<p>"Come into my bedroom and smoke, Clive," she smiled. "We can
talk through the dressing-room door."</p>

<p>"No; I think I'll turn in."</p>

<p>The maid continued on through the rose and ivory bedroom and
into the dressing-room. Mrs. Bailey lingered, intuition and experience
preparing her for what a boy of that age was very sure to say.</p>

<p>And after some fidgeting about he said it:</p>

<p>"Mother, honestly what did you think of her?"</p>

<p>His mother's smile remained unaltered: "Do you mean the Greensleeve
girl?"</p>

<p>"I mean Athalie Greensleeve."</p>

<p>"She is pretty in a rather common way."</p>

<p>"Common!"</p>

<p>"Did you think she is not?"</p>

<p>"Common," he repeated in boyish astonishment. "What is there
common about her?"</p>

<p>"If <em>you</em> can't see it any woman of your own class can."</p>


<p>Which remark aroused all that was dramatic and poetic in the
boy, and he spoke with a slightly exaggerated phraseology:</p>

<p>"What is there common about this very beautiful girl? Surely
not her features. Her head, her figure, her hands, her feet are
delicate and very exquisitely formed; in her bearing there is
an unconscious and sweet dignity; her voice is soft, charming,
well-bred. What is there about her that you find common?"</p>

<p>His mother, irritated and secretly dismayed, maintained, however,
her placid mask and her attitude of toleration.</p>

<p>She said: "I distinguish between a woman to the manner born,
and a woman who is not. The difference is as subtle as intuition
and as wide as the ocean. And, dear, no young man, however clever,
is clever enough to instruct his mother concerning such matters."</p>

<p>"I was asking you to instruct me," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well. If you wish to know the difference between the imitation
and the real, compare that young woman with Winifred Stuart."</p>

<p>Clive's gaze shifted from his mother and became fixed on space.</p>

<p>After a moment his pretty mother moved toward the dressing-room:
"If you will find a chair and light a cigarette, Clive, we can
continue talking."</p>

<p>His absent eyes reverted to her: "I think I'll go, mother. Good
night."</p>

<p>"Good night, dear."</p>

<p>He went to his own room. From the room adjoining came his father's
heavy breathing where he lay asleep.</p>

<p>The young fellow listened for a moment, then walked into the
library where only a dim night-light was burning. He still wore
his overcoat over his evening clothes, and carried his hat and
stick.</p>

<p>For a while he stood in the dim library, head bent, staring at
the rug under foot.</p>

<p>Then he turned, went out and down the stairs, and opened the
door of the butler's pantry. The service telephone was there.
He unhooked the receiver and called. Almost immediately he got
his "party."</p>

<p>"Yes?" came the distant voice distinctly.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Athalie?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Oh, <em>Clive!</em>"</p>

<p>"Didn't you recognise my voice?"</p>

<p>"Not immediately."</p>

<p>"When did you come in?"</p>

<p>"Just this moment. I still have on my evening wrap."</p>

<p>"Did you have an agreeable evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"May I come around and see you for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right," he said briefly.</p>
