<p>D'Alcacer was a man of nearly forty, lean and sallow, with hollow
eyes and a drooping brown moustache. His gaze was penetrating
and direct, his smile frequent and fleeting. He observed Lingard
with great interest. He was attracted by that elusive something&mdash;a
line, a fold, perhaps the form of the eye, the droop of an eyelid,
the curve of a cheek, that trifling trait which on no two faces
on earth is alike, that in each face is the very foundation of
expression, as if, all the rest being heredity, mystery, or accident,
it alone had been shaped consciously by the soul within.</p>

<p>Now and then he bent slightly over the slow beat of a red fan
in the curve of the deck chair to say a few words to Mrs. Travers,
who answered him without looking up, without a modulation of tone
or a play of feature, as if she had spoken from behind the veil
of an immense indifference stretched between her and all men,
between her heart and the meaning of events, between her eyes
and the shallow sea which, like her gaze, appeared profound, forever
stilled, and seemed, far off in the distance of a faint horizon,
beyond the reach of eye, beyond the power of hand or voice, to
lose itself in the sky.</p>

<p>Mr. Travers stepped aside, and speaking to Carter, overwhelmed
him with reproaches.</p>

<p>"You misunderstood your instructions," murmured Mr. Travers rapidly.
"Why did you bring this man here? I am surprised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not half so much as I was last night," growled the young seaman,
without any reverence in his tone, very provoking to Mr. Travers.</p>

<p>"I perceive now you were totally unfit for the mission I entrusted
you with," went on the owner of the yacht.</p>

<p>"It's he who got hold of me," said Carter. "Haven't you heard
him yourself, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," whispered Mr. Travers, angrily. "Have you any idea
what his intentions may be?"</p>

<p>"I half believe," answered Carter, "that his intention was to
shoot me in his cabin last night if I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not the point," interrupted Mr. Travers. "Have you any
opinion as to his motives in coming here?"</p>

<p>Carter raised his weary, bloodshot eyes in a face scarlet and
peeling as though it had been licked by a flame. "I know no more
than you do, sir. Last night when he had me in that cabin of his,
he said he would just as soon shoot me as let me go to look for
any other help. It looks as if he were desperately bent upon getting
a lot of salvage money out of a stranded yacht."</p>

<p>Mr. Travers turned away, and, for a moment, appeared immersed
in deep thought. This accident of stranding upon a deserted coast
was annoying as a loss of time. He tried to minimize it by putting
in order the notes collected during the year's travel in the East.
He had sent off for assistance; his sailing-master, very crestfallen,
made bold to say that the yacht would most likely float at the
next spring tides; d'Alcacer, a person of undoubted nobility though
of inferior principles, was better than no company, in so far
at least that he could play picquet.</p>

<p>Mr. Travers had made up his mind to wait. Then suddenly this
rough man, looking as if he had stepped out from an engraving
in a book about buccaneers, broke in upon his resignation with
mysterious allusions to danger, which sounded absurd yet were
disturbing; with dark and warning sentences that sounded like
disguised menaces.</p>

<p>Mr. Travers had a heavy and rather long chin which he shaved.
His eyes were blue, a chill, naive blue. He faced Lingard untouched
by travel, without a mark of weariness or exposure, with the air
of having been born invulnerable. He had a full, pale face; and
his complexion was perfectly colourless, yet amazingly fresh,
as if he had been reared in the shade.</p>

<p>He thought:</p>

<p>"I must put an end to this preposterous hectoring. I won't be
intimidated into paying for services I don't need."</p>

<p>Mr. Travers felt a strong disgust for the impudence of the attempt;
and all at once, incredibly, strangely, as though the thing, like
a contest with a rival or a friend, had been of profound importance
to his career, he felt inexplicably elated at the thought of defeating
the secret purposes of that man.</p>

<p>Lingard, unconscious of everything and everybody, contemplated
the sea. He had grown on it, he had lived with it; it had enticed
him away from home; on it his thoughts had expanded and his hand
had found work to do. It had suggested endeavour, it had made
him owner and commander of the finest brig afloat; it had lulled
him into a belief in himself, in his strength, in his luck&mdash;and
suddenly, by its complicity in a fatal accident, it had brought
him face to face with a difficulty that looked like the beginning
of disaster.</p>

<p>He had said all he dared to say&mdash;and he perceived that he was
not believed. This had not happened to him for years. It had never
happened. It bewildered him as if he had suddenly discovered that
he was no longer himself. He had come to them and had said: "I
mean well by you. I am Tom Lingard&mdash;" and they did not believe!
Before such scepticism he was helpless, because he had never imagined
it possible. He had said: "You are in the way of my work. You
are in the way of what I can not give up for any one; but I will
see you through all safe if you will only trust me&mdash;me, Tom Lingard."
And they would not believe him! It was intolerable. He imagined
himself sweeping their disbelief out of his way. And why not?
He did not know them, he did not care for them, he did not even
need to lift his hand against them! All he had to do was to shut
his eyes now for a day or two, and afterward he could forget that
he had ever seen them. It would be easy. Let their disbelief vanish,
their folly disappear, their bodies perish. . . . It was that&mdash;or
ruin!</p>
