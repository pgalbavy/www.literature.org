<p>EVERY one of Daddy Longlegs' eight knees began to shake, when Sandy
Chipmunk told him to stand in the middle of the road, in order to stop
the old horse Ebenezer, who was pulling the wagon in which Johnnie Green
and his grandmother were riding.
</p>
<p>"I can't do that!" Daddy shrieked, shrinking away from the dusty road.
"I'm so small that they wouldn't see me and the first thing I'd know I'd
be run over.... You'll have to stop the wagon for me--you're so much
bigger than I am."
</p><p>But Sandy Chipmunk said he didn't like to speak to Johnnie Green, on
account of a little trouble he had had with Johnnie's father over a
letter.
</p><p>"Can't you wave your tail at him?" Daddy Longlegs besought him. "That
wouldn't be <u>speaking</u> to him, you know. Wave your tail at Johnnie Green
until he stops the horse; and then you can run away, if you want to. And
while the horse is standing still I'll scramble into the wagon, without
anybody seeing me."
</p><p>Now, Sandy Chipmunk was a good-natured person. And he saw that unless
the wagon was stopped, Daddy Longlegs was going to be terribly
disappointed. So he told Daddy that he would do what he could to help
him.
</p><p>Then Sandy leaped nimbly to the edge of the watering-trough at one side
of the road and began waving his tail backwards and forwards, like a
flag.
</p><p>"That's right!" Daddy Longlegs shouted approvingly. "But I wish you'd
wave a little harder. I'm afraid they won't see you."
</p><p>So Sandy Chipmunk redoubled his efforts. And he wagged his tail so hard
that before he knew what was happening he had lost his footing, slipped
off the edge of the trough, and found himself floundering in the water.
</p><p>Daddy Longlegs was watching the wagon so anxiously that he never noticed
what was happening to his friend. But he observed that Johnnie Green
began to laugh. And pointing toward the watering-trough Johnnie cried,
"Oh! look, Grandma--look!"
</p><p>The old horse Ebenezer, too, seemed interested in what was going on.
Anyhow, he swerved to the right and walked straight up to the trough.
And the wagon came to a halt.
</p><p>That was Daddy Longlegs' chance. He hurried to one of the rear wheels.
And in spite of the wind he clambered quickly up and hid himself in a
corner of the wagon-box.
</p><p>Meanwhile Sandy Chipmunk, spluttering and choking, managed to pull
himself out of his unexpected bath and frisked out of sight among the
sumacs that fringed the road.
</p><p>"Well, I stopped the wagon, anyhow!" he said to himself as he scampered
away.
</p><p>And that was just where he was mistaken. The old horse Ebenezer wanted a
drink. That was why he had paused at the trough. He thrust his muzzle
deep into the cool spring-water and drank so long that Johnnie Green
began to be worried, for fear he would burst.
</p><p>But old Ebenezer wouldn't budge until he had drunk his fill. When he was
ready (and not before) the wagon went rumbling up the road again, taking
Johnnie Green and his grandmother home to the farmhouse--and likewise
bearing Daddy Longlegs back to the stone wall, where little Mr. Chippy
lived in the wild grapevine.
