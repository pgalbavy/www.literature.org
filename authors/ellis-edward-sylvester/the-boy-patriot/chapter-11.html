<p>Captain Knox did not set off in pursuit of the British vessel
from which Blair had so unexpectedly escaped. Our young sailor
soon learned that the "Molly" was on the look-out for richer prey,
in the shape of an East Indiaman, whose costly cargo was expected
to prove a gold mine for captain and crew.</p>

<p>The love of adventure and the lust for gold seemed uppermost
in the minds of Blair's new companions. The Fairport boy was not
long in discovering that there was about as little Christian patriotism
on board the Molly, as there is verdure in Sahara. In the freedom
of the mess-table, the late achievements of the crew were the
occasion of many a "yarn," and of many a fierce discussion as
to who had been the boldest and most reckless in the excitement
of attack and victory. It was plain that the crew of the Molly
were little better than a den of thieves, their whole thought
being of plunder, their whole ambition the winning of gold. Blair
blushed for the honor of his country, to find such men among her
avowed defenders. Oaths and obscenity made even more hateful the
rough narratives in which each strove to prove himself more hardened
and abandoned than the last speaker. Blair's soul recoiled with
horror from the taint of such companionship; yet for him there
was no escape. Among these coarse rovers he was forced to eat
and sleep, to live and labor, while many weeks went by.</p>

<p>The youngest on board, he was at the beck and call of these rough
men, who made his body as weary of doing their bidding as his
soul of their words of wickedness. A deep, hearty hatred of the
crew of the Molly took possession of Blair Robertson. He wondered
that a benevolent Providence should have placed a Christian boy
in the midst of the pollution of such associates, and subject
to the martyrdom of hearing their daily talk. A cold and haughty
silence was Blair's defence against their scolding and their railing.
With a feeling of conscious superiority he moved among them, desiring
their praise even less than their persecution.</p>

<p>The names of the crew of the Molly were as unattractive as their
appearance and manners. These soubriquets spoke not of pious parents
who had given their children to God, with a Christian name which
they trusted would be registered in heaven. They told rather of
lawless lives, and a past which must be buried in oblivion or
acknowledged with shame and perhaps fear. "Fighting-cock," "Torpedo,"
"Brimstone," and "the Slasher," were among the leaders who dubbed
Blair with the title of "Mum," and so saluted him on all occasions.
Blair had a very considerable sense of his own dignity, and was
by no means pleased with this style of address. Yet he showed
his resentment by increased taciturnity rather than by words.
Captain Knox and Derry Duck soon found out that Blair Robertson
was no useless addition to the crew, and promptly gave him his
share in the watch and in other duties which his strength would
permit.</p>

<p>The hours of the watch were to Blair the most agreeable he now
enjoyed. In the silent night, with the sea below and the sentinel
stars overhead, he could commune with God, undisturbed by the
wickedness of man.</p>

<p>Blair had not been a day on board the Molly, when Torpedo, a
fiery young Spaniard, spied him reading his pocket-Testament in
a quiet part of the ship. The book was snatched away and flung
triumphantly into the water, while Torpedo exclaimed in bad English
that Blair should follow it if he tried to force any of his canting
notions on the free crew of the privateer. Well was it for Blair
that his mind was stored with chapter after chapter of the precious
volume, which would otherwise have been to him now a sealed book.
It surprised him to see how much of the Scriptures he could by
a strong effort recall, and most consoling and cheering to him
were those words of peace and power.</p>

<p>In one of these lonely watches, Blair's thoughts turned to his
present companions with his usual loathing. Suddenly there came
to him the image of these rough bad men in their days of babyhood,
ere yet this evil world had found its full response in the evil
within their poor human hearts. He could fancy the loving eye
of God on those little ones, following them along their dreary
pathway, and grieving as thicker grew the crust of sin over all
that had been pure and childlike, and more and more dark their
coming doom. Blair realized for the first time the love of God,
the pure and holy God, for those wicked transgressors of his law.
"Yes," he thought, "it was while we were yet sinners Christ died
for us. He came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Hateful as must have been to Him the atmosphere of guilt and degradation
in this lower world, he left his Father's throne and came to seek
and to save that which was lost." Ah, how unlike the ministry
of the Son of man had been Blair's proud, self-exalting, unloving
demeanor. Perhaps mercy for those poor abandoned men had sent
a Christian boy to dwell among them and show forth the image of
his Master. With deep shame Blair saw how unchristian had been
his thoughts and acts towards his uncongenial associates. Had
he not cherished the very spirit of the Pharisee, "Stand by thyself;
I am holier than thou?" Blair thought of his proud and hasty temper
and of the many sins of his boyhood, and meekly owned that but
for the loving hand of God which had hedged him round against
temptation, and planted him in the garden of the Lord, he might
have been even worse than these wild rovers of the sea. Earnestly
he prayed that he might so live and love on board the Molly, that
at least a faint image might be given of the great Example, who
endured the contradiction of sinners, and for their sakes was
willing to suffer even unto death.</p>

<p>Shame and indignation that such men should profess to be defenders
of the American flag had hitherto been a chill to the patriotism
of Blair Robertson. Now the thought struck him, that if he could
but win one of these hardy sailors to be a Christian servant of
his country, an honor to the flag under which he sailed, not in
vain would a young patriot have endured the trials and temptations
of the "Molly." "But," thought Blair, "what am I, single-handed,
against so many? How can I hope to bring a blessing by the prayers
of my one heart, be it ever so devoted?" He remembered that the
prayer of the patriot Moses saved the hosts of the children of
Israel from utter destruction at the hand of their offended God.
At the prayer of Paul, the Ruler of the seas gave him not only
his own life, but the lives of all that were with him in the ship.
"I cannot," he said to himself, "hope to prevail like these saints
of old, at least not for my own sake; but the name of Jesus is
all-powerful. I will plead it for the poor wanderers about me,
and God will in due time, I trust, prosper and bless my efforts."</p>
