<p>How neat and pure is the task of the chronicler who has the tale
to tell of a "good rousing fight" between boys or men who fight
in the "good old English way," according to a model set for fights
in books long before Tom Brown went to Rugby. There are seconds
and rounds and rules of fair-play, and always there is great good
feeling in the end&mdash;though sometimes, to vary the model, "the
Butcher" defeats the hero&mdash;and the chronicler who stencils this
fine old pattern on his page is certain of applause as the stirrer
of "red blood." There is no surer recipe.</p>

<p>But when Herman and Verman set to 't the record must be no more
than a few fragments left by the expurgator. It has been perhaps
sufficiently suggested that the altercation in Mr. Schofield's
stable opened with mayhem in respect to the aggressor's nose.
Expressing vocally his indignation and the extremity of his pained
surprise, Mr. Collins stepped backward, holding his left hand
over his nose, and striking at Herman with his right. Then Verman
hit him with the rake.</p>

<p>Verman struck from behind. He struck as hard as he could. And
he struck with the tines down &mdash;For, in his simple, direct
African way he wished to kill his enemy, and he wished to kill
him as soon as possible. That was his single, earnest purpose.</p>

<p>On this account, Rupe Collins was peculiarly unfortunate. He
was plucky and he enjoyed conflict, but neither his ambitions
nor his anticipations had ever included murder. He had not learned
that an habitually aggressive person runs the danger of colliding
with beings in one of those lower stages of evolution wherein
theories about "hitting below the belt" have not yet made their
appearance.</p>

<p>The rake glanced from the back of Rupe's head to his shoulder,
but it felled him. Both darkies jumped full upon him instantly,
and the three rolled and twisted upon the stable-floor, unloosing
upon the air sincere maledictions closely connected with complaints
of cruel and unusual treatment; while certain expressions of feeling
presently emanating from Herman and Verman indicated that Rupe
Collins, in this extremity, was proving himself not too slavishly
addicted to fighting by rule. Dan and Duke, mistaking all for
mirth, barked gayly.</p>

<p>From the panting, pounding, yelling heap issued words and phrases
hitherto quite unknown to Penrod and Sam; also, a hoarse repetition
in the voice of Rupe concerning his ear left it not to be doubted
that additional mayhem was taking place. Appalled, the two spectators
retreated to the doorway nearest the yard, where they stood dumbly
watching the cataclysm.</p>

<p>The struggle increased in primitive simplicity: time and again
the howling Rupe got to his knees only to go down again as the
earnest brothers, in their own way, assisted him to a more reclining
position. Primal forces operated here, and the two blanched, slightly
higher products of evolution, Sam and Penrod, no more thought
of interfering than they would have thought of interfering with
an earthquake.</p>

<p>At last, out of the ruck rose Verman, disfigured and maniacal.
With a wild eye he looked about him for his trusty rake; but Penrod,
in horror, had long since thrown the rake out into the yard. Naturally,
it had not seemed necessary to remove the lawn-mower.</p>

<p>The frantic eye of Verman fell upon the lawn-mower, and instantly
he leaped to its handle. Shrilling a wordless war-cry, he charged,
propelling the whirling, deafening knives straight upon the prone
legs of Rupe Collins. The lawn-mower was sincerely intended to
pass longitudinally over the body of Mr. Collins from heel to
head; and it was the time for a death-song. Black Valkyrie hovered
in the shrieking air.</p>

<p>"Cut his gizzud out!" shrieked Herman, urging on the whirling
knives.</p>

<p>They touched and lacerated the shin of Rupe, as, with the supreme
agony of effort a creature in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing,
he tore himself free of Herman and got upon his feet.</p>

<p>Herman was up as quickly. He leaped to the wall and seized the
garden-scythe that hung there.</p>

<p>"I'm go to cut you' gizzud out," he announced definitely, "an'
eat it!"</p>

<p>Rupe Collins had never run from anybody (except his father) in
his life; he was not a coward; but the present situation was very,
very unusual. He was already in a badly dismantled condition,
and yet Herman and Verman seemed discontented with their work:
Verman was swinging the grass-cutter about for a new charge, apparently
still wishing to mow him, and Herman had made a quite plausible
statement about what he intended to do with the scythe.</p>

<p>Rupe paused but for an extremely condensed survey of the horrible
advance of the brothers, and then, uttering a blood-curdled scream
of fear, ran out of the stable and up the alley at a speed he
had never before attained, so that even Dan had hard work to keep
within barking distance. And a 'cross-shoulder glance, at the
corner, revealing Verman and Herman in pursuit, the latter waving
his scythe overhead, Mr. Collins slackened not his gait, but,
rather, out of great anguish, increased it; the while a rapidly
developing purpose became firm in his mind&mdash;and ever after so
remained&mdash;not only to refrain from visiting that neighbourhood
again, but never by any chance to come within a mile of it.</p>

<p>From the alley door, Penrod and Sam watched the flight, and were
without words. When the pursuit rounded the corner, the two looked
wanly at each other, but neither spoke until the return of the
brothers from the chase.</p>

<p>Herman and Verman came back, laughing and chuckling.</p>

<p>"Hiyi!" cackled Herman to Verman, as they came, "See 'at ole
boy run!"</p>

<p>"Who-ee!" Verman shouted in ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Nev' did see boy run so fas'!" Herman continued, tossing the
scythe into the wheelbarrow. "I bet he home in bed by viss time!"</p>

<p>Verman roared with delight, appearing to be wholly unconscious
that the lids of his right eye were swollen shut and that his
attire, not too finical before the struggle, now entitled him
to unquestioned rank as a sansculotte. Herman was a similar ruin,
and gave as little heed to his condition.</p>

<p>Penrod looked dazedly from Herman to Verman and back again. So
did Sam Williams.</p>

<p>"Herman," said Penrod, in a weak voice, "you wouldn't <em>HONEST
</em>of cut his gizzard out, would you?"</p>

<p>"Who? Me? I don' know. He mighty mean ole boy!" Herman shook
his head gravely, and then, observing that Verman was again convulsed
with unctuous merriment, joined laughter with his brother. "Sho'!
I guess I uz dess <em>TALKIN' </em>whens I said 'at! Reckon he
thought I meant it, f'm de way he tuck an' run. Hiyi! Reckon he
thought ole Herman bad man! No, suh! I uz dess talkin', 'cause
I nev' would cut NObody! I ain' tryin' git in no jail &mdash;NO,
suh!"</p>

<p>Penrod looked at the scythe: he looked at Herman. He looked at
the lawn-mower, and he looked at Verman. Then he looked out in
the yard at the rake. So did Sam Williams.</p>

<p>"Come on, Verman," said Herman. "We ain' go' 'at stove-wood f'
supper yit."</p>

<p>Giggling reminiscently, the brothers disappeared leaving silence
behind them in the carriage-house. Penrod and Sam retired slowly
into the shadowy interior, each glancing, now and then, with a
preoccupied air, at the open, empty doorway where the late afternoon
sunshine was growing ruddy. At intervals one or the other scraped
the floor reflectively with the side of his shoe. Finally, still
without either having made any effort at conversation, they went
out into the yard and stood, continuing their silence.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam, at last, "I guess it's time I better be gettin'
home. So long, Penrod!"</p>

<p>"So long, Sam," said Penrod, feebly.</p>

<p>With a solemn gaze he watched his friend out of sight. Then he
went slowly into the house, and after an interval occupied in
a unique manner, appeared in the library, holding a pair of brilliantly
gleaming shoes in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield, reading the evening paper, glanced frowningly
over it at his offspring.</p>

<p>"Look, papa," said Penrod. "I found your shoes where you'd taken
'em off in your room, to put on your slippers, and they were all
dusty. So I took 'em out on the back porch and gave 'em a good
blacking. They shine up fine, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be d-dud-dummed!" said the startled Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>Penrod was zigzagging back to normal.</p>
