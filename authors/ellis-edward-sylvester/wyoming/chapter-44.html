<p>After the indignant protest of Mr. Brainerd, Jake Golcher concluded
to let the matter rest for the time.</p>

<p>"The old fellow is pretty sassy and independent, but I'll take
it out of him before he's two hours older. I wish Black Turtle
would come in."</p>

<p>He referred to one of the most treacherous and cruel warriors
of the Seneca tribe&mdash;a savage whose atrocities had given him prominence
even among a people noted for their cruelty, and the identical
redskin who was in his mind at that moment came out of the wood
and approached the Tory leader.</p>

<p>Black Turtle was the warrior who passed under the tree in which
Fred Godfrey was perched.</p>

<p>Golcher now believed that he had been lenient, and he resolved
to force the issue that had already been delayed too long. Without
heeding the other warriors, who were laughing and scrambling for
the slices of meat, Black Turtle at once went up to the white
man, with whom he held a brief but pointed conversation.</p>

<p>He first told that they had hunted hard for the Yengese, or Yankee,
and had failed to find him&mdash;a piece of superfluous information,
and then Black Turtle, who seemed to be a subordinate chief, asked
in an angry voice why the whites sitting on the log had been spared
so long.</p>

<p>On the other side the river the Indians allowed few of the Yengese
to live any longer than they could survive the blows of the tomahawk,
and there was no reason why such partiality should be shown these
who had crossed the Susquehanna.</p>

<p>This declaration was supplemented by the warrior drawing his
tomahawk, and announcing that he meant to finish the job at once.</p>

<p>But this was a little more than Jake Golcher wished. There was
one of the captives, at least, whom he desired to protect until
certain, one way or the other, about her disposition toward him.</p>

<p>If her father were removed, the Tory believed the daughter could
be brought to terms through her affection for her sister and aunt.</p>

<p>"So long as the old chap is alive," reflected Golcher, "so long
will he prevent her consent. But, if he is gone, and she finds
that the only way to save Eva and her aunt is to accept me, she
will do it, though there will be a big lot of blubbering and praying
and all that sort of stuff. Therefore, the best thing is to get
her father out of her path: she will be pretty well broke up by
that."</p>

<p>It was now necessary that Black Turtle should be appeased in
some way, and Jake Golcher, without hesitation, made known his
purpose.</p>

<p>It was, in short, that Black Turtle should move off in the woods,
as if he had no thought of evil in his mind, and when beyond sight,
make a stealthy circuit, so as to get in the rear of the parties
sitting on the log.</p>

<p>He was then to steal up and drive his tomahawk into the skull
of the unsuspecting Mr. Brainerd. The Indian would utter his whoop,
if so inclined (the disposition to whoop at such a time is irresistible
with his race), and dart off in the woods.</p>

<p>He was to stay until matters should become quiet around the camp-fire,
when he might come back and play the innocent warrior, or the
avenger, as he chose.</p>

<p>Black Turtle entered upon the dreadful business with the cunning
peculiar to his nature. He sauntered off in another direction,
passing by the group of Senecas on the other side of the fire,
without so much as drawing an inquiring look from them.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey, from his perch in the tree, saw this action of
the redskin, but with no suspicion of its meaning.</p>

<p>He thought he would probably continue his hunt for the lieutenant,
whom he, and all the others, had not been able to find.</p>

<p>The conduct of Jake Golcher was as cruel as that of Black Turtle.
Without resenting the indignant words of Mr. Brainerd, who seated
himself beside Maggie and tried to cheer her, the Tory sauntered
off and stood grimly watching the curious actions of some of the
warriors, who were still struggling for the crumbs that fell from
Aunt Peggy's aboriginal table.</p>

<p>He thought it best not to say anything more to the fugitives.
He had made a blunder, and no words of his just then could right
it. He had decided that there had been already too much talk,
and it was time for action to take its place.</p>

<p>The position of the Tory was such that he could see every one
in camp, but he glowered out from his ugly brows on the mournful
party that still sat on the fallen tree, and not only at them,
but he was watching the wood immediately behind Mr. Brainerd.</p>

<p>He knew the point where Black Turtle would be likely to appear,
and he did not wish to miss the tragedy.</p>

<p>"Things look rather curious there," muttered Lieutenant Godfrey,
from his perch in the branches of the tree. "Why is Jake Golcher
watching the folks so closely? Is there some mischief afloat?"</p>

<p>At that instant he detected a movement in the undergrowth behind
Brainerd, the position of Fred being the best possible to see
what was going on in that spot.</p>

<p>The firelight was thrown over the fallen tree, and reached some
distance beyond, so that the figure of Black Turtle, as he rose
like a shadow to his feet, was plainly shown.</p>

<p>One glance at the warrior told the whole truth to the watcher,
whose gun was already cocked and pointed in that direction.</p>

<p>Black Turtle had selected his own position, and, slowly drawing
back his sinewy arm, he aimed straight for him who never dreamed
of his peril.</p>

<p>The savage gathered his strength for the throw that was to inflict
death upon an innocent man.</p>

<p>But Black Turtle made a slight mistake.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "But Black Turtle made a slight mistake."]</p>

<p>Before the weapon could leave his fingers the sharp report of
a rifle broke the stillness, followed instantly by the death-shriek
of the savage, as he flung his arms aloft and fell forward, almost
against the log on which the Brainerd family were sitting.</p>

<p>The scheme of Jake Golcher and Black Turtle was indefinitely
postponed.</p>
