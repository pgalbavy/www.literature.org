<p>Raoul and Christine ran, eager to escape from the roof and the
blazing eyes that showed only in the dark; and they did not stop
before they came to the eighth floor on the way down.</p>

<p>There was no performance at the Opera that night and the passages
were empty.  Suddenly, a queer-looking form stood before them
and blocked the road:</p>

<p>"No, not this way!"</p>

<p>And the form pointed to another passage by which they were to
reach the wings.  Raoul wanted to stop and ask for an explanation. 
But the form, which wore a sort of long frock-coat and a pointed
cap, said:</p>

<p>"Quick!  Go away quickly!"</p>

<p>Christine was already dragging Raoul, compelling him to start
running again.</p>

<p>"But who is he?  Who is that man?" he asked.</p>

<p>Christine replied:  "It's the Persian."</p>

<p>"What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows.  He is always in the Opera."</p>

<p>"You are making me run away, for the first time in my life. 
If we really saw Erik, what I ought to have done was to nail him
to Apollo's lyre, just as we nail the owls to the walls of our
Breton farms; and there would have been no more question of him."</p>

<p>"My dear Raoul, you would first have had to climb up to Apollo's
lyre: that is no easy matter."</p>

<p>"The blazing eyes were there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are getting like me now, seeing him everywhere!  What
I took for blazing eyes was probably a couple of stars shining
through the strings of the lyre."</p>

<p>And Christine went down another floor, with Raoul following her.</p>

<p>"As you have quite made up your mind to go, Christine, I assure
you it would be better to go at once.  Why wait for to-morrow?
He may have heard us to-night."</p>

<p>"No, no, he is working, I tell you, at his Don Juan Triumphant
and not thinking of us."</p>

<p>"You're so sure of that you keep on looking behind you!"</p>

<p>"Come to my dressing-room."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better meet outside the Opera?"</p>

<p>"Never, till we go away for good!  It would bring us bad luck,
if I did not keep my word.  I promised him to see you only here."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for me that he allowed you even that.  Do
you know," said Raoul bitterly, "that it was very plucky of you
to let us play at being engaged?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, he knows all about it!  He said, 'I trust you,
Christine.  M. de Chagny is in love with you and is going abroad.
Before he goes, I want him to be as happy as I am.'  Are people
so unhappy when they love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Christine, when they love and are not sure of being loved."</p>

<p>They came to Christine's dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the
stage?" asked Raoul.  "You heard him through the walls here, therefore
he can certainly hear us."</p>

<p>"No. He gave me his word not to be behind the walls of my dressing-room
again and I believe Erik's word.  This room and my bedroom on
the lake are for me, exclusively, and not to be approached by
him."</p>

<p>"How can you have gone from this room into that dark passage,
Christine?  Suppose we try to repeat your movements; shall we?"</p>

<p>"It is dangerous, dear, for the glass might carry me off again;
and, instead of running away, I should be obliged to go to the
end of the secret passage to the lake and there call Erik."</p>

<p>"Would he hear you?"</p>

<p>"Erik will hear me wherever I call him.  He told me so.  He is
a very curious genius.  You must not think, Raoul, that he is
simply a man who amuses himself by living underground.  He does
things that no other man could do; he knows things which nobody
in the world knows."</p>

<p>"Take care, Christine, you are making a ghost of him again!"</p>

<p>"No, he is not a ghost; he is a man of Heaven and earth, that
is all."</p>

<p>"A man of Heaven and earth ... that is all! ... A nice way to
speak of him! ... And are you still resolved to run away from
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, you will have no resolve left!"</p>

<p>"Then, Raoul, you must run away with me in spite of myself; is
that understood?"</p>

<p>"I shall be here at twelve to-morrow night; I shall keep my promise,
whatever happens.  You say that, after listening to the performance,
he is to wait for you in the dining-room on the lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And how are you to reach him, if you don't know how to go out
by the glass?"</p>

<p>"Why, by going straight to the edge of the lake."</p>

<p>Christine opened a box, took out an enormous key and showed it
to Raoul.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The key of the gate to the underground passage in the Rue Scribe."</p>

<p>"I understand, Christine.  It leads straight to the lake.  Give
it to me, Christine, will you?"</p>

<p>"Never!" she said.  "That would be treacherous!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Christine changed color.  A mortal pallor overspread
her features.</p>

<p>"Oh heavens!" she cried.  "Erik!  Erik!  Have pity on me!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said Raoul.  "You told me he could hear you!"</p>

<p>But the singer's attitude became more and more inexplicable. 
She wrung her fingers, repeating, with a distraught air:</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!  Oh, Heaven!"</p>

<p>"But what is it?  What is it?"  Raoul implored.</p>

<p>"The ring ... the gold ring he gave me."</p>

<p>"Oh, so Erik gave you that ring!"</p>

<p>"You know he did, Raoul!  But what you don't know is that, when
he gave it to me, he said, 'I give you back your liberty, Christine,
on condition that this ring is always on your finger.  As long
as you keep it, you will be protected against all danger and Erik
will remain your friend.  But woe to you if you ever part with
it, for Erik will have his revenge!' ... My dear, my dear, the
ring is gone! ... Woe to us both!"</p>

<p>They both looked for the ring, but could not find it.  Christine
refused to be pacified.</p>

<p>"It was while I gave you that kiss, up above, under Apollo's
lyre," she said.  "The ring must have slipped from my finger and
dropped into the street!  We can never find it.  And what misfortunes
are in store for us now!  Oh, to run away!"</p>

<p>"Let us run away at once," Raoul insisted, once more.</p>

<p>She hesitated.  He thought that she was going to say yes... 
Then her bright pupils became dimmed and she said:</p>

<p>"No!  To-morrow!"</p>

<p>And she left him hurriedly, still wringing and rubbing her fingers,
as though she hoped to bring the ring back like that.</p>

<p>Raoul went home, greatly perturbed at all that he had heard.</p>

<p>[Illustration: They Sat Like that for a Moment in Silence]</p>

<p>"If I don't save her from the hands of that humbug," he said,
aloud, as he went to bed, "she is lost.  But I shall save her."</p>

<p>He put out his lamp and felt a need to insult Erik in the dark. 
Thrice over, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Humbug! ... Humbug! ... Humbug!"</p>

<p>But, suddenly, he raised himself on his elbow.  A cold sweat
poured from his temples.  Two eyes, like blazing coals, had appeared
at the foot of his bed.  They stared at him fixedly, terribly,
in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Raoul was no coward; and yet he trembled.  He put out a groping,
hesitating hand toward the table by his bedside.  He found the
matches and lit his candle.  The eyes disappeared.</p>

<p>Still uneasy in his mind, he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"She told me that <em>HIS </em>eyes only showed in the dark. 
His eyes have disappeared in the light, but HE may be there still."</p>

<p>And he rose, hunted about, went round the room.  He looked under
his bed, like a child.  Then he thought himself absurd, got into
bed again and blew out the candle.  The eyes reappeared.</p>

<p>He sat up and stared back at them with all the courage he possessed.
Then he cried:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Erik?  Man, genius, or ghost, is it you?"</p>

<p>He reflected:  "If it's he, he's on the balcony!"</p>

<p>Then he ran to the chest of drawers and groped for his revolver. 
He opened the balcony window, looked out, saw nothing and closed
the window again.  He went back to bed, shivering, for the night
was cold, and put the revolver on the table within his reach.</p>

<p>The eyes were still there, at the foot of the bed.  Were they
between the bed and the window-pane or behind the pane, that is
to say, on the balcony?  That was what Raoul wanted to know. 
He also wanted to know if those eyes belonged to a human being...
He wanted to know everything.  Then, patiently, calmly, he seized
his revolver and took aim.  He aimed a little above the two eyes. 
Surely, if they were eyes and if above those two eyes there was
a forehead and if Raoul was not too clumsy ...</p>

<p>The shot made a terrible din amid the silence of the slumbering
house. And, while footsteps came hurrying along the passages,
Raoul sat up with outstretched arm, ready to fire again, if need
be.</p>

<p>This time, the two eyes had disappeared.</p>

<p>Servants appeared, carrying lights; Count Philippe, terribly
anxious:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I think I have been dreaming," replied the young man.  "I fired
at two stars that kept me from sleeping."</p>

<p>"You're raving!  Are you ill?  For God's sake, tell me, Raoul:
what happened?"</p>

<p>And the count seized hold of the revolver.</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm not raving...  Besides, we shall soon see ..."</p>

<p>He got out of bed, put on a dressing-gown and slippers, took
a light from the hands of a servant and, opening the window, stepped
out on the balcony.</p>

<p>The count saw that the window had been pierced by a bullet at
a man's height.  Raoul was leaning over the balcony with his candle:
"Aha!" he said.  "Blood! ... Blood! ... Here, there, more blood! 
...  That's a good thing!  A ghost who bleeds is less dangerous!"
he grinned.</p>

<p>"Raoul!  Raoul!  Raoul!"</p>

<p>The count was shaking him as though he were trying to waken a
sleep-walker.</p>

<p>"But, my dear brother, I'm not asleep!"  Raoul protested impatiently.
"You can see the blood for yourself.  I thought I had been dreaming
and firing at two stars.  It was Erik's eyes ... and here is his
blood! ... After all, perhaps I was wrong to shoot; and Christine
is quite capable of never forgiving me ...  All this would not
have happened if I had drawn the curtains before going to bed."</p>

<p>"Raoul, have you suddenly gone mad?  Wake up!"</p>

<p>"What, still?  You would do better to help me find Erik ... for,
after all, a ghost who bleeds can always be found."</p>

<p>The count's valet said:</p>

<p>"That is so, sir; there is blood on the balcony."</p>

<p>The other man-servant brought a lamp, by the light of which they
examined the balcony carefully.  The marks of blood followed the
rail till they reached a gutter-spout; then they went up the gutter-spout.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Count Philippe, "you have fired at a cat."</p>

<p>"The misfortune is," said Raoul, with a grin, "that it's quite
possible.  With Erik, you never know.  Is it Erik?  Is it the
cat?  Is it the ghost?  No, with Erik, you can't tell!"</p>

<p>Raoul went on making this strange sort of remarks which corresponded
so intimately and logically with the preoccupation of his brain
and which, at the same time, tended to persuade many people that
his mind was unhinged.  The count himself was seized with this
idea; and, later, the examining magistrate, on receiving the report
of the commissary of police, came to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>"Who is Erik?" asked the count, pressing his brother's hand.</p>

<p>"He is my rival.  And, if he's not dead, it's a pity."</p>

<p>He dismissed the servants with a wave of the hand and the two
Chagnys were left alone.  But the men were not out of earshot
before the count's valet heard Raoul say, distinctly and emphatically:</p>

<p>"I shall carry off Christine Daae to-night."</p>

<p>This phrase was afterward repeated to M. Faure, the examining-magistrate. 
But no one ever knew exactly what passed between the two brothers
at this interview.  The servants declared that this was not their
first quarrel.  Their voices penetrated the wall; and it was always
an actress called Christine Daae that was in question.</p>

<p>At breakfast&mdash;the early morning breakfast, which the count took
in his study &mdash;Philippe sent for his brother.  Raoul arrived
silent and gloomy. The scene was a very short one.  Philippe handed
his brother a copy of the Epoque and said:</p>

<p>"Read that!"</p>

<p>The viscount read:</p>

<p>"The latest news in the Faubourg is that there is a promise of
marriage between Mlle. Christine Daae, the opera-singer, and M.
le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.  If the gossips are to be credited,
Count Philippe has sworn that, for the first time on record, the
Chagnys shall not keep their promise.  But, as love is all-powerful,
at the Opera as&mdash;and even more than&mdash;elsewhere, we wonder how
Count Philippe intends to prevent the viscount, his brother, from
leading the new Margarita to the altar. The two brothers are said
to adore each other; but the count is curiously mistaken if he
imagines that brotherly love will triumph over love pure and simple."</p>

<p>"You see, Raoul," said the count, "you are making us ridiculous! 
That little girl has turned your head with her ghost-stories."</p>

<p>The viscount had evidently repeated Christine's narrative to
his brother, during the night.  All that he now said was:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Philippe."</p>

<p>"Have you quite made up your mind?  You are going to-night? With
her?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Surely you will not do anything so foolish?  I <em>SHALL </em>know
how to prevent you!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, Philippe," said the viscount again and left the room.</p>

<p>This scene was described to the examining-magistrate by the count
himself, who did not see Raoul again until that evening, at the
Opera, a few minutes before Christine's disappearance.</p>

<p>Raoul, in fact, devoted the whole day to his preparations for
the flight.  The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions,
the luggage, the money required for the journey, the road to be
taken (he had resolved not to go by train, so as to throw the
ghost off the scent): all this had to be settled and provided
for; and it occupied him until nine o'clock at night.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, a sort of traveling-barouche with the curtains
of its windows close-down, took its place in the rank on the Rotunda
side.  It was drawn by two powerful horses driven by a coachman
whose face was almost concealed in the long folds of a muffler. 
In front of this traveling-carriage were three broughams, belonging
respectively to Carlotta, who had suddenly returned to Paris,
to Sorelli and, at the head of the rank, to Comte Philippe de
Chagny.  No one left the barouche.  The coachman remained on his
box, and the three other coachmen remained on theirs.</p>

<p>A shadow in a long black cloak and a soft black felt hat passed
along the pavement between the Rotunda and the carriages, examined
the barouche carefully, went up to the horses and the coachman
and then moved away without saying a word, The magistrate afterward
believed that this shadow was that of the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny;
but I do not agree, seeing that that evening, as every evening,
the Vicomte de Chagny was wearing a tall hat, which hat, besides,
was subsequently found.  I am more inclined to think that the
shadow was that of the ghost, who knew all about the whole affair,
as the reader will soon perceive.</p>

<p>They were giving <em>FAUST, </em>as it happened, before a splendid
house.  The Faubourg was magnificently represented; and the paragraph
in that morning's <em>EPOQUE </em>had already produced its effect,
for all eyes were turned to the box in which Count Philippe sat
alone, apparently in a very indifferent and careless frame of
mind.  The feminine element in the brilliant audience seemed curiously
puzzled; and the viscount's absence gave rise to any amount of
whispering behind the fans. Christine Daae met with a rather cold
reception.  That special audience could not forgive her for aiming
so high.</p>

<p>The singer noticed this unfavorable attitude of a portion of
the house and was confused by it.</p>

<p>The regular frequenters of the Opera, who pretended to know the
truth about the viscount's love-story, exchanged significant smiles
at certain passages in Margarita's part; and they made a show
of turning and looking at Philippe de Chagny's box when Christine
sang:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I wish I could but know who was he<br/>
That addressed me,<br/>
If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is."

</p>
</div>
<p>The count sat with his chin on his hand and seemed to pay no
attention to these manifestations.  He kept his eyes fixed on
the stage; but his thoughts appeared to be far away.</p>

<p>Christine lost her self-assurance more and more.  She trembled. 
She felt on the verge of a breakdown ...  Carolus Fonta wondered
if she was ill, if she could keep the stage until the end of the
Garden Act.  In the front of the house, people remembered the
catastrophe that had befallen Carlotta at the end of that act
and the historic "co-ack" which had momentarily interrupted her
career in Paris.</p>

<p>Just then, Carlotta made her entrance in a box facing the stage,
a sensational entrance.  Poor Christine raised her eyes upon this
fresh subject of excitement.  She recognized her rival.  She thought
she saw a sneer on her lips.  That saved her.  She forgot everything,
in order to triumph once more.</p>

<p>From that moment the prima donna sang with all her heart and
soul.  She tried to surpass all that she had done till then; and
she succeeded. In the last act when she began the invocation to
the angels, she made all the members of the audience feel as though
they too had wings.</p>

<p>In the center of the amphitheater a man stood up and remained
standing, facing the singer.  It was Raoul.</p>

<p>"Holy angel, in Heaven blessed ..."</p>

<p>And Christine, her arms outstretched, her throat filled with
music, the glory of her hair falling over her bare shoulders,
uttered the divine cry:</p>

<p>"My spirit longs with thee to rest!"</p>

<p>It was at that moment that the stage was suddenly plunged in
darkness. It happened so quickly that the spectators hardly had
time to utter a sound of stupefaction, for the gas at once lit
up the stage again.  But Christine Daae was no longer there!</p>

<p>What had become of her?  What was that miracle?  All exchanged
glances without understanding, and the excitement at once reached
its height. Nor was the tension any less great on the stage itself. 
Men rushed from the wings to the spot where Christine had been
singing that very instant.  The performance was interrupted amid
the greatest disorder.</p>

<p>Where had Christine gone?  What witchcraft had snatched her,
away before the eyes of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers and
from the arms of Carolus Fonta himself?  It was as though the
angels had really carried her up "to rest."</p>

<p>Raoul, still standing up in the amphitheater, had uttered a cry. 
Count Philippe had sprung to his feet in his box.  People looked
at the stage, at the count, at Raoul, and wondered if this curious
event was connected in any way with the paragraph in that morning's
paper.  But Raoul hurriedly left his seat, the count disappeared
from his box and, while the curtain was lowered, the subscribers
rushed to the door that led behind the scenes.  The rest of the
audience waited amid an indescribable hubbub.  Every one spoke
at once.  Every one tried to suggest an explanation of the extraordinary
incident.</p>

<p>At last, the curtain rose slowly and Carolus Fonta stepped to
the conductor's desk and, in a sad and serious voice, said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, an unprecedented event has taken place
and thrown us into a state of the greatest alarm.  Our sister-artist,
Christine Daae, has disappeared before our eyes and nobody can
tell us how!"</p>
