A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his poultry
yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample
revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and set
it on fire.  The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields
of the Farmer who had captured him.  It was the time of the wheat
harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and returned
home grieving sorely.
