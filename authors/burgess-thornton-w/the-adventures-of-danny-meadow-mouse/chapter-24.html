<p><em>REDDY FOX </em>had caught Danny Meadow Mouse, and yet he
hadn’t caught him. He had found Danny hiding in the old tomato
can, and it didn’t enter Reddy’s head that he couldn’t get Danny
out when he wanted to. He was in no hurry. He had had a pretty
good breakfast of grasshoppers, and so he thought he would torment
Danny a while before gobbling him up. He lay down so that he could
peep in at the open end of the old can and see Danny trying to
make himself as small as possible at the other end. Reddy grinned
until he showed all his long teeth. Reddy always is a bully, especially
when his victim is a great deal smaller and weaker than himself.</p>

<p>"I’ve got you this time, Mr. Smarty, haven’t I?" taunted Reddy.</p>

<p>Danny didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>"You think you’ve been very clever because you have fooled me
two or three times, don’t you? Well, this time I’ve got you where
your tricks won’t work," continued Reddy, "so what are you going
to do about it?"</p>

<p>Danny didn’t answer. The fact is, he was too frightened to answer.
Besides, he didn’t know what he could do. So he just kept still,
but his bright eyes never once left Reddy’s cruel face. For all
his fright, Danny was doing some hard thinking. He had been in
tight places before and had learned never to give up hope. Something
might happen to frighten Reddy away. Anyway, Reddy had got to
get him out of that old can before he would admit that he was
really caught.</p>

<p>For a long time Reddy lay there licking his chops and saying
all the things he could think of to frighten poor Danny Meadow
Mouse. At last he grew tired of this and made up his mind that
it was time to end it and Danny Meadow Mouse at the same time.
He thrust his sharp nose in at the opening in the end of the old
can, but the opening was too small for him to get more than his
nose in, and he only scratched it on the sharp edges without so
much as touching Danny.</p>

<p>"I’ll pull you out," said Reddy and thrust in one black paw.</p>

<p>Danny promptly bit it so hard that Reddy yelped with pain and
pulled it out in a hurry. Presently he tried again with the other
paw. Danny bit this one harder still, and Reddy danced with pain
and anger. Then he lost his temper completely, a very foolish
thing to do, as it always is. He hit the old can, and away it
rolled with Danny Meadow Mouse inside. This seemed to make Reddy
angrier than ever. He sprang after it and hit it again. Then he
batted it first this way and then that way, growing angrier and
angrier. And all the time Danny Meadow Mouse managed to keep inside,
although he got a terrible shaking up.</p>

<p>Back and forth across the patch of short grass Reddy knocked
the old can, and he was in such a rage that he didn’t notice where
he was knocking it to. Finally he sent it spinning into the long
grass on the far side of the open patch, close to one of Danny’s
private little paths. Like a flash Danny was out and scurrying
along the little path. He dodged into another and presently into
a third, which brought him to a tangle of barbed wire left there
by Farmer Brown when he had built a new fence. Under this he was
safe.</p>

<p>"Phew!" exclaimed Danny, breathing very hard. "That was the narrowest
escape yet! But I guess I’ll get that special grass-seed I started
out for, after all."</p>

<p>And he did, while to this day Reddy Fox wonders how Danny got
out of the old tomato can without him knowing it.</p>

<p>
And so you see what temper does<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who give it rein;<br/>
It cheats them of the very thing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They seek so hard to gain.

</div>
<p>Danny has had many more adventures, but there isn’t room to tell
about them here. Besides Grandfather Frog is anxious that you
should hear about the queer things that have happened to him.
They are told in the next book.</p>
