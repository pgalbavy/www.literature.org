<p>The interview between Missionary Finley and the Shawanoe chieftain
had been prolonged; it was of the first importance. Many things
that this narrative does not require should be recorded passed
between them, and the hour was far advanced when the decision
was reached; it was agreed that the life of the little captive,
Mabel Ashbridge, should be determined by the result of the duel
to the death between Simon Kenton and Wa-on-mon, known as The
Panther.</p>

<p>Aware as was the missionary of the departure of the ranger at
the moment the flatboat was pushing from the Kentucky shore, he
knew his course of action as well as if he had watched his every
movement.</p>

<p>"Throughout the whole interview he had scarcely removed his eyes
from Wa-on-mon and me," was the conclusion of Finley, and he was
right.</p>

<p>"I will now go in search of the white hunter," he said, slightly
modifying his manner of speaking; "I shall soon find him, and
he will be at the rock."</p>

<p>"And when the sun rises he will find Wa-on-mon awaiting him there,"
said the chieftain.</p>

<p>Waving his hand in a half-military fashion, as a salute not only
to the chief but to the leading Shawanoes, Finley turned about
and walked away in the forest.</p>

<p>He felt an almost irresistible yearning to go over to Mabel Ashbridge
and utter a few comforting words in her ear; but her own welfare
prevented anything of that nature. Besides, she had laid her weary
head down upon the bark and was sleeping as soundly as if resting
on her mother's bosom.</p>

<p>After leaving the Shawanoe camp, the missionary directed his
steps toward the Ohio, where he had left his canoe. There was
no call for secrecy in his movements, and he tramped through the
bushes and undergrowth as a countryman would have done had he
held no suspicion of danger. If he excelled in any direction,
it was in making more of a racket than such a countryman.</p>

<p>As he anticipated, he had not gone far when a familiar signal
arrested him. He instantly paused, and the next moment Simon Kenton
was at his side.</p>

<p>"I seed you and The Panther talkin'," remarked the ranger, "and
it struck me powerful hard that the varmint was saying something
that must be of interest to me."</p>

<p>"I was confident you were lurking among the trees not far off,
and since Wa-on-mon sometimes spoke pretty loud, I fancied you
would catch the drift of our conversation."</p>

<p>"I couldn't catch 'nough to do that, but I am interested in it."</p>

<p>"No one can be more so; I left the camp to hunt for you; do you
know of that rock which lies just above the gulch, on this side
of the river? It is a small flat rock, rising only a few inches
above the water."</p>

<p>"I know the spot as well as I do the one where the block-house
stands."</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon has pledged himself to be there when the sun rises,
and I have given him my pledge that you will not be behind him."</p>

<p>"I'll be there!" said Kenton in a low voice, and with a deliberation
that made his earnestness the more impressive. "It's the chance
I've been huntin' for years."</p>

<p>"The agreement is that each of you is to be armed only with his
knife. No one is to be present&mdash;not even myself. If Wa-on-mon
wins by slaying you, then Mr. Ashbridge's little child must die."</p>

<p>"And if I win?"</p>

<p>"I am to take her back to her parents unharmed."</p>

<p>"You've said 'nough, parson; I'll be there."</p>

<p>The missionary did not know whether to accept it as a good or
bad omen that Kenton, contrary to The Panther, and contrary to
his own habit, made no boast of what he would do upon meeting
the chieftain.</p>

<p>"No danger of his flunking, I hope, parson?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest; but, Simon, may I say one word?"</p>

<p>"You may say a thousand."</p>

<p>"I have arranged for two persons to meet in deadly combat. There
is something dreadfully shocking in the idea, and in some respects
it is most distressing to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It ain't to me," interrupted Kenton, with a chuckle; "all I'm
afeered of is that the varmint may find some excuse not to meet
me."</p>

<p>"I have assured you that there is no cause for any such fear.
What it has been in my mind to say is that when you do meet, remember
that a truly brave man is merciful."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, parson."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is better that I shall not attempt to explain, but,
if possible, remember my words."</p>

<p>"I think that to make sartin there's no slip on my part, I'll
go to the rock now."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you."</p>

<p>It was a brief walk to the place fixed upon for the meeting,
and both were so familiar with the ground, or rather the shore
of the river (for it has been explained that the missionary knew
little about Rattlesnake Gulch itself), that it required only
a few minutes for them to proceed directly to the place.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you here and return to Wa-on-mon," said Finley; "God
be with you, and, if you can, remember what I said just now."</p>

<p>Kenton returned his salutation, and without further words they
separated.</p>

<p>On his return to the Shawanoe camp the good man used extreme
caution for a time, as though fearful of being detected by some
of the warriors whom he was seeking. When certain at last that
no human eye saw him, he knelt in the midst of the solemn wood,
and poured out his soul in prayer to the only One who could aid
him in his dire perplexity. He spent a long time alone and in
communion with his Maker, and then, much strengthened in spirit,
he pressed forward with the same openness as before, until once
more he stood in the Shawanoe camp.</p>

<p>Little change had taken place during his absence. Instead of
most of the warriors walking about all were seated&mdash;some sleeping,
but the majority awake and talking with each other.</p>

<p>Little Mabel was still unconscious, but instead of reclining
on the log she lay on the leaves close to the fallen tree, one
chubby arm doubled under her cheek, her slumber as sweet and restful
as if in her trundle-bed at home.</p>

<p>Since it was not reasonable to think the little one had made
this change of position herself, it must have been done by one
of the Shawanoes. An odd suspicion came to the missionary that
it had been done by The Panther, but he deemed it unwise to inquire,
so the truth was never known.</p>

<p>But nothing escaped the eye of Finley. He noticed the chieftain
sitting apart talking with four warriors, and two of them were
not in the camp when the missionary left it. They had come in
while he was away. Most likely they were scouts that had been
watching the movements of the pioneers on the other side of the
river. It was fortunate if it was so, for they must have brought
news that the fugitives had ceased any effort to reach the block-house,
and were quietly waiting until the missionary or Kenton, or both,
had returned with their tidings.</p>

<p>Finley endeavored to approach near enough to the group to catch
something that was said, but the chief and his warriors were too
cunning to permit this. Not wishing to interrupt, he seated himself
on the fallen tree to wait until Wa-on-mon was ready to talk to
him.</p>

<p>The chief did not keep him waiting. Leaving the warriors, he
came over and sat down beside him, the moccasins of the savage
so close to the curly head that a motion of a few inches would
have touched it with his toe.</p>

<p>The Panther did not glance at the little sleeper, and it would
be unwarrantable to suppose that any feeling akin to pity glowed
within that sinister breast, which burned and seethed with a quenchless
hatred of the people that were trying to drive the red men from
their hunting grounds. Nevertheless, Missionary Finley clung to
the belief that it was Wa-on-mon that had lifted the child from
her hard seat on the log and deposited her so gently upon the
leaves that her slumber was not disturbed.</p>

<p>"Has my brother seen the white hunter?" asked Wa-on-mon, speaking
in a much lower tone than was used in the former interview.</p>

<p>"He parted with him a short time ago."</p>

<p>"Is his heart glad that Wa-on-mon will meet him?"</p>

<p>"His heart flows with joy," replied Finley, with deep depression
that such should be the truth, over the prospect of so shocking
an event.</p>

<p>"He will not run away?"</p>

<p>"Did he do so yesterday?" was the stinging question of the missionary,
which struck the Shawanoe hard; "he is so afraid he will not be
at the rock in time that he has gone there to await the coming
of Wa-on-mon; he is there now; Wa-on-mon will find him when he
goes thither."</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon will be there when the sun rises from its bed; he
will not keep the white hunter waiting."</p>

<p>"And the pale-faces that have crossed to the other side of the
river will tarry there till the missionary returns to them."</p>

<p>"My brother speaks with a single tongue," remarked The Panther,
thereby uttering another strong tribute to the integrity of his
visitor.</p>

<p>"Does he not always speak with a single tongue?" asked Finley,
feeling warranted in pushing the chieftain, now that the all-important
question had been settled.</p>

<p>"He does," was the prompt response of the fiery sachem, who thereby
plumply contradicted what he had said a short time before.</p>

<p>This, in a certain sense, might have been gratifying to the missionary,
had not his knowledge of Indian nature told him unerringly the
cause of the exultant mood of The Panther. Simply, he was gratified
at the prospect of meeting the white man in mortal combat, for
he held not a shadow of doubt that the career of Kenton was already
as good as ended. An hour or so, and the famous ranger would vex
the red men no more.</p>

<p>It has been made plain to the reader that the vicious miscreant
was anything but a coward. The events that had since occurred
fully justified his failure to meet Kenton upon the former acceptance
of his challenge.</p>

<p>"The man's confidence in himself is unbounded; he does not think
it possible he can fail to overcome Simon. It will be a fearful
struggle when they do meet, and I shudder at the thought. Can
it be that Simon underestimates the prowess of Wa-on-mon? I hope
not, and yet, I fear &mdash;I fear."</p>

<p>Within the following hour a dim, growing light began showing
in the eastern part of the heavens. Day was breaking.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon goes to meet the white hunter," said the chieftain,
much as a groom might have announced his going forth to greet
his bride.</p>

<p>He made no farewell to the other warriors. He had explained everything
to them and nothing was to be added. His words were addressed
to the missionary, who was so oppressed by the situation that
he could make no response, excepting a silent nod of his head.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon will soon return," added the exultant Shawanoe, as
if determined that his visitor should speak.</p>

<p>"How soon?" the latter forced himself to ask.</p>

<p>"When the sun appears there," said The Panther, indicating a
point, by extending his arm, which the orb would reach within
an hour after rising. "Wa-on-mon will come back, bringing the
scalp of the white hunter with him. If he is still absent when
the sun is there, the missionary may take the hand of the captive
and go back to his people. The Shawanoe warriors will not stand
in his way."</p>

<p>It would be vain to attempt to depict the anguish of the dreadful
minutes that followed. Missionary Finley underwent a struggle
that was the keenest agony he had ever known. Most of the warriors
dropped off in slumber. Included with these were those who had
been wounded, and who seemed to have the faculty of overcoming
their sufferings to a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>Three remained awake to attend the fire and guard the camp. Little
Mabel Ashbridge slept on in blissful ignorance of the awful fate
impending over her childish head. Only the good man himself suffered
a torture beyond the power of words to describe.</p>

<p>He glanced upward through the leaves continually. At the very
moment the sun reached the point indicated by Wa-on-mon, the undergrowth
parted and the chieftain himself strode forward. And as he did
so the missionary saw on his countenance an expression that he
had never noted before.</p>
