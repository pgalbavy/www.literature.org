<p><em>THERE </em>is a scene that we must not dwell upon. There
are some that awaken emotions which no pen can describe, no imagination
conceive. When Peterson, the ranger, communicated the dreadful
intelligence of the fate of Marian to her parents, the shock was
terrible. The mother swooned away, and for nearly a week remained
more in death than life. The father received the shock like the
oak when riven by the thunderbolt&mdash;firm and unbending, but still
shattered to the very heart. He groaned in spirit, but, for the
sake of his wife, bore up with superhuman calmness. But it well-nigh
killed him; and his wife, when she was pulled from the grasp of
death, felt that she could never, never recover from it. Her heart
was broken.</p>

<p>Russel Mansfield bore the affliction like a man. He held up in
the presence of others; but there were moments when alone in which
he gave way to his great woe. We have no desire to dwell upon
this painful scene, but hasten forward.</p>

<p>The resolution of Abbot to emigrate still farther to the west,
instead of being weakened by this sad calamity, was strengthened
into a determination. Why it was, he would almost have been at
a loss to tell. We all know that when death, for the first time,
strikes down some one near and dear to us, it is difficult to
believe that such is the case; it is a long time before we can
bring ourselves to realize it. There is a singular, lingering
doubt, the faint shadow of a hope that, after all, it is not death,
and that through the subtle power of medicine the lost one will
still return to us. And even, after burial, for a long time, there
will be moments when we give way to the same extraordinary hope
and find ourselves indulging in dreams of fancy in which the lost
one is again found.</p>

<p>Those who have had a similar experience to this, will appreciate
the feeling that led Abbot and his stricken wife to emigrate to
the scene which was so full of horror to them. The same motive
strengthened the determination of Mansfield, although his parents
now refused to accompany the party. Several of the other families
also refused, so that the company bid fair to be alarmingly small.
Peterson had whispered to Mansfield the intention of Dingle and
himself of seeking out the renegade McGable and revenging themselves
upon him, and he was anxious to either join them or be so situated
that he could receive the earliest intelligence of their success.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one morning in September, another flat-boat floated
away from the village referred to at the commencement of this
work, and carrying with it four families only, together with young
Mansfield. The weather continued fine all the way, and they experienced
no difficulty in reaching their destination. Just before they
reached the Sciota, a desperate attempt was made to get them ashore.
Mansfield, shrewdly suspecting that it was McGable himself who
acted the part of a decoy, raised his rifle with the intention
of shooting him; but the wily demon was too quick for him. He
suspected something, and secreted himself before Mansfield could
secure his aim. The latter, however, fired, and came so uncomfortably
close, that the decoy ceased his entreaties, and, by way of a
return for the compliment, a whole volley was fired at the flat-boat
by the concealed savages. Some of the bullets struck the boat
and the others whistled overhead, but they did no further damage.</p>

<p>The settlement, which was the destination of our friends, was
a few miles further down the river, and they came in sight of
it about the middle of the afternoon. As Peterson had given the
settlers notice of their coming, they were expected and joyfully
welcomed. The flat-boat was swept into shore and fastened, and,
with the aid of the willing settlers, its contents removed in
an incredibly short space of time. The boat itself was then hauled
as far up the bank as possible, and taken carefully apart, and
its timbers preserved for building purposes.</p>

<p>As this village is to be the location of many of the succeeding
incidents of our story, we will here briefly describe it, and
then hasten forward to the incidents that follow.</p>

<p>The settlement consisted of about twenty cabins, and numbered
a hundred inhabitants. A small block-house was erected near the
lower end of the village for immediate refuge in case of sudden
attack; but the governor of the territory had ordered a large
one to be erected and continually manned by men well-skilled in
border warfare. This block-house was erected in advance of the
settlement itself, so as to better guard the approach of an enemy.
It stood in a broad clearing, protected on the one hand by a marshy
swamp, and the other by the Ohio river. The block-house consisted
of two stories. The lower one was about thirty feet square, and
the upper thirty-three, so that it projected over the lower, giving
those within an opportunity of defending the door and windows,
in case a determined attack was made. A well had been sunk in
one corner, so that if besieged they could not be brought to terms
by thirst. The roof was so steeply-shelving as to prevent any
burning missiles from remaining upon it, and the planks themselves
were so smooth-shaven that the most agile savage could not maintain
a position upon it for an instant. The sides were built of solid
green logs of some eighteen or twenty inches in diameter, dove-tailed
at the ends in the usual manner, and the interstices filled in
with mortar. The doors and windows and shutters were bars of ponderous
puncheons, secured by massive bars of wood on the inside. The
upper part of the house was pierced with numerous loop-holes,
through which a large force could keep up a constant fire upon
their assailants.</p>

<p>The block-house was surrounded by a substantial wall of palisades.
These were made by cutting trees of a foot in diameter into pieces
fifteen feet in length. These pieces were then quartered, hewed
off sharply at one end, and driven four feet into the solid ground,
leaving eleven feet above. The palisades were kept firmly in their
places by means of stout braces and wall-pieces upon the inside;
and, as they were set with their smooth side outward, and close
together, no force could scale them without the aid of ladders.</p>

<p>A flagstaff stood a few feet from the block-house, and the stars
and stripes ever waved from the summit. At the second story was
a projection, facing the forest, upon which the sentinel passed
most of his time while on duty, and which supported a swivel,
so hung that it could be brought to bear upon almost any point
from which danger was to be apprehended.</p>

<p>This fort was quite a celebrated one, and being manned by the
governor with an active force, was much resorted to by the scouts
and rangers along the frontiers. Dick Dingle was enrolled as a
member of this company, although the governor and the commander
of the fort knew there was no use of undertaking to bring any
such character under discipline. He was allowed to go and come
when he pleased, and it may be said, in fact, that the whole class
of frontier rangers were a set of <em>Border Zouaves</em>. They
were ever in the most perilous situations, did the most dangerous
service, and acknowledged no leader other than their own free
will. The commander, with several of his leading men, had served
in the capacity of rangers, and were all adepts in Indian warfare.</p>

<p>It was the duty of Dingle to range through the adjoining country,
to keep a constant watch upon the movements of the Indians, and
to return as often as possible with his report to the commander.
At this time there were other scouts performing similar duties
in other situations, who have since become celebrated in history.
McArthur, White, McCleland, and Davis, and the Whetzel brothers
are the ones to whom we refer. They occasionally visited the fort
singly, but never in company, and sometimes remained several days
in conversation and feasting with their friends.</p>

<p>Peterson, upon his return with Dingle, had had his name enrolled
as a member of the company at the block-house; and they had already
made several excursions in company. When Abbot and his friends
arrived at the settlement, these two scouts had just returned
from a journey up the Sciota valley to one of the Shawnee towns.
The genial settlers, having known of the coming of their new friends,
showed their good-will by erecting several cabins and presenting
them to the new-comers immediately upon their arrival. By dusk,
Abbot, with his wife and Mansfield, were snugly domiciled in theirs,
and ready to join their neighbors, on the morrow, in clearing
the forest, breaking the ground, or whatever their duty might
chance to be.</p>

<p>Although Abbot had not seen Peterson, he had heard that he was
in the settlement, and sent for him in the evening. The good-hearted
fellow had purposely kept out of the way, for fear that his presence
would be painful to them, but upon hearing the wish of Abbot,
he immediately went to his house.</p>

<p>The meeting could not be but painful upon both sides. There was
a manifest restraint about the ranger, for he well knew the feelings
that must be awakened by his presence. The conversation turned
upon ordinary subjects, and each carefully refrained from any
allusion that might bring up the matter that was in the mind of
every one.</p>

<p>In the course of a half hour or so, the quick eye of Mrs. Abbot
saw her presence was a restraint upon something her husband wished
to say; and she made an excuse for withdrawing and retiring for
the night.</p>

<p>After she had gone, the conversation continued a short time as
usual, and then, as it sometimes will, it suddenly came to a dead
pause. Utter silence fell upon all.</p>

<p>"Jim," said Abbot, glancing furtively around to assure himself
that his wife was not within hearing, "Jim, I must once more speak
about <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"Wal?" queried the ranger, uneasily.</p>

<p>"I must ask you once more to narrate, as particularly as is in
your power, the account of the attack upon the flat-boat, and
the death of Marian. I will not ask you to give anything else
but that alone."</p>

<p>"I dunno as I can tell anything more, but, howsumever, I can
tell that over again if you want it," and thereupon he proceeded
to give with fearful vividness, the dying-words and actions of
Marian Abbot. The father heard him all through, without a syllable
of interruption, keeping his lips compressed, his brow knit, and
his eye fixed upon the smoldering fire before him.</p>

<p>"You think, Jim, then, that she is&mdash;she must be dead?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, Abbot, 'sposen I had fifty bullets right smack through
this h'yer noddle of mine, and you should ax me if I had any s'pishions
I'd survive, and I should tell you I was as dead as a door nail,
wouldn't you believe me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Wal, then, though I'm sorry to say it, there ain't a bit more
hope for her. She never seed the devils that climbed over the
boat. She died afore I got twenty feet from the boat."</p>

<p>"You are <em>certain of it</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm certain."</p>

<p>"You must wonder at my talking thus, Jim; but I have no hopes
either; I have given her up long since. I have still one wish&mdash;to
know what fate attended her body."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"She was thrown overboard with the others."</p>

<p>"You did not see that done, Jim, and cannot be sure of it."</p>

<p>The ranger was about to contradict him, and tell that he had
followed the murderers and seen that they bore no body with them;
but he did not, and Abbot continued.</p>

<p>"It is this doubt&mdash;this uncertainty that still troubles me. When
that has been cleared up I shall never speak of the subject again.
Russel has told me that you and Dingle are going to seek revenge
upon McGable?"</p>

<p>"We are not going to seek it; we are going to <em>get</em> it."</p>

<p>"I profess to be a Christian, and the Bible teaches me that vengeance
is not for us, but for One alone. And, Jim, I can really say that
I have no desire that McGable should suffer at your hands. God
knows that he has broken two hearts, but the time will come when
he will have to answer for it."</p>

<p>"That's my idee, exactly, and I reckon as how 'twill be a little
sooner than he expects."</p>

<p>"He knows, if any human being does, the fate of Marian. Obtain,
if possible, first of all, the truth from him."</p>

<p>"I can't see just now, Abbot, how that's gwine to be done."</p>

<p>"Take him captive and bring him in, and we will make him answer.
Do you not think you and your companion may succeed in capturing
him?"</p>

<p>"P'r'aps so&mdash;bein' it's your wish we'll do our best to do it,
and," added Peterson to himself, "O Lordy! won't we skemer the
old devil when we git him. We'll toast him afore a slow fire,
I'll bet my life."</p>

<p>"Get him, if you can, Jim, and you will confer a favor that I
shall never be able to repay."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, <em>the thing will be done</em>!"</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Peterson took his departure.</p>
