<p>When glancing around in quest of Detective Pendar, Harvey Hamilton
failed to look behind him. Some one touched his shoulder, as he
stood beside his aeroplane. Glancing back, there was his man.</p>

<p>The time for them to be strangers to each other had passed. Pendar
asked crisply:</p>

<p>"How did you make out?"</p>

<p>"I found the spot."</p>

<p>"Certain there is no mistake about it?"</p>

<p>"I saw the little girl herself; we have located her."</p>

<p>"Can you take me thither?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I can’t land; there isn’t enough space."</p>

<p>"Let me down in front of Uncle Tommy’s home; it isn’t far off."</p>

<p>"All right; take your seat; I’ll have you there in a jiffy. I
didn’t see either of those men."</p>

<p>"There’s one of them now on the edge of the crowd, toward the
porch of the hotel."</p>

<p>While the detective was seating himself, the young aviator looked
in the direction indicated. The Italian, Amasi Catozzi, was standing
a little apart from the others, watching the couple as a cat watches
a mouse which she expects to come within reach of her claws the
next moment. Dressed in a gray, natty suit and slouch hat, he
kept his hands in the pockets of his coat, which was buttoned
to his gaudy necktie.</p>

<p>The hurried words between the man and boy must have told the
truth to the Black Hander. The individual whom he had accepted
as a commercial traveler was a professional detective, whose search
for the kidnapped child had brought him to this country town and
very near the spot where she was held a prisoner. He must have
believed, too, that the aeroplane had come thither, not accidentally,
but to play an assigned part in the drama. The prospect of the
whole daring scheme being brought to naught filled the miscreant
with unrestrainable rage. He stood for a moment like a statue,
his swarthy face aflame with passion. Then he took several hasty
steps forward as if to interfere. The propeller of the biplane
was revolving faster and faster, and it began gliding down the
moderate slope, preparatory to leaping upward from the earth.
Harvey, with hands and feet busy, gave his whole attention to
the task, but the shrewd Pendar rightly suspected they were not
yet through with the wretch who strode toward them.</p>

<p>The machine was in the act of leaving the ground when Catozzi’s
right hand was jerked out of his coat pocket. Leveling a revolver,
he blazed away twice in rapid succession at the detective. The
latter had turned in his seat so as to face him, and was barely
a second behind him in returning the shot.</p>

<p>The couple were not fifty feet apart when this interchange took
place. The Italian was an expert with firearms and had he not
been incited by so consuming a passion, he assuredly would have
got his man. He missed by a hair’s breadth, but the cool Simmons
Pendar did better. He saw his enemy’s body twitch, the Italian
staggered backward a couple of paces, and the pistol dropped from
his grasp.</p>

<p>The detective knew, however, that he had only winged him. In
truth he had not tried to kill but only to wound, and he succeeded.
In that moment Pendar, who generally held himself well in hand,
felt such a thrill of anger that he determined to end the wretch’s
power for evil forever. He sighted his weapon with the utmost
care, and had the conditions been favorable, he assuredly would
have scored a "bull’s eye," but it must be remembered that the
aeroplane was in action, and already in the air, heading westward
and going at a speed of thirty or forty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bohunkus Johnson at this point got into the game. He
had seated himself, as we remember, on the porch and was sulking
over the reproof of Harvey Hamilton. Now when he saw him going
off without him, he sprang to his feet; leaped down the few steps,
dashed forward and shouted:</p>

<p>"Hold on, Harv! Yo’ve forgot something!"</p>

<p>But his friend could not wait for him. In the racket made by
the motor, he heard nothing, and, if he had caught the words he
would have paid no heed. Far more weighty matters claimed his
undivided efforts. The action of the colored youth, however, brought
him in direct line with the Italian, and the fast receding detective
dared not fire because of the danger of hitting the negro or some
member of the group of staring spectators.</p>

<p>The incidents described took so brief a time that no one who
witnessed them understood what had taken place until all was ended.
Certainly they could not have dreamed of its meaning. Why the
drummer seated behind the young aviator should turn about and
exchange shots with another man who seemed also to be a drummer,
was more than any person could figure out, unless he laid it to
bitter business rivalry.</p>

<p>Conversation between Harvey Hamilton and Detective Pendar was
impossible, nor was it necessary. The few sentences spoken were
sufficient, though had there been the opportunity, the man would
have asked for more particulars. Although on this warm summer
day he wore no top coat, he carried two pairs of patent handcuffs,
and his weapon still held four charges, which no man in the world
better knew how to utilize. He would have been very glad to stand
up in front of the raging Catozzi with both their revolvers cracking
and only a few paces between them, but the time had not yet come
for a duel of that kind. He gave his intensest attention to what
was before him while Harvey Hamilton was equally resolute with
his duty.</p>

<p>Catozzi was not hit so hard as he thought when the twinge first
thrilled his shoulder. The bullet of the detective inflicted only
a flesh wound, and the man rallied instantly from the shock. He
recovered his weapon and for a minute watched the aeroplane speeding
away like an enormous bird. Then he noted that its line of flight
was directly over <em>the</em> spot. Not a vestige of doubt remained
as to what this meant.</p>

<p>The landlord had come out on the porch during the stirring incidents
and now approached the Italian.</p>

<p>"What the mischief did that man mean by shooting at you? Did
he hurt you bad?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," replied Catozzi, who despite the fact that a crimson
stain was beginning to show on his upper arm angrily added:</p>

<p>"I am not hurt; don’t bother me."</p>

<p>He set off down the street, taking the direction followed by
the detective the night before. He walked fast until he reached
the beginning of the path which led to the home of the ancient
weather prophet. There he turned off and his pace became almost
a run. He needed no one to tell him the desperate need of haste.</p>

<p>He had gone only half way when he left the main path and followed
a faintly marked trail,—so dimly indicated indeed that any person
not keen sighted or looking for something of the kind would have
missed it altogether.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harvey Hamilton was attending strictly to business.
Directly south of the tumble-down home of Uncle Tommy Waters,
and less than an eighth of a mile away, stood a smaller and more
dilapidated cabin, with no signs of cultivation about it. It seemed
wedged among a mass of rocks and stones, which formed a part of
the structure. One side was wholly composed of rocks. Surveying
the miserable shanty, one would have concluded that it had never
been used as a permanent dwelling, but might have been flung into
shape by a party of hunters who, visiting that section, had aimed
to provide against sudden storm and preferred to sleep there rather
than at any house or in the town.</p>

<p>When the aeroplane was skimming over this unattractive spot,
Harvey turned his head and, meeting the glance of the detective,
nodded. The gesture said: "That’s the place," and the answering
nod indicated that the man understood.</p>

<p>What it was that had told the young aviator the startling truth
was more than his companion could guess, for, search as he might,
he could not detect the first sign of life below them. There was
the gray pile of boards and rails, which looked as if they had
been tossed among the boulders by a cyclone, but nothing else
met the eye. All the same, the youth had not been mistaken.</p>

<p>Had not the interest of the two been centered upon what was beneath
them, they would have made an interesting discovery. Less than
a mile distant, a monoplane, as close to the earth as their own,
was bearing down upon them. One glance would have made known to
our friends that it was the well remembered Dragon of the Skies.
There could be no doubt that its owner, Professor Milo Morgan,
was on his way to take part in the game. But that interesting
fact was not learned until a brief while later.</p>

<p>Having shown his companion the cabin he had sought so long, Harvey
Hamilton shot beyond it, and circled about until over the clearing
in front of Uncle Tommy Waters’ home, when he began descending
by means of the spiral, that picturesque and graceful manœuver,
always attended with peril, as was shown on the last day of the
year 1910, when the daring aviator Arch Hoxsey was killed at Los
Angeles and John B. Moisant met his death at New Orleans.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the biplane was at an elevation of
not more than five hundred feet when he began to volplane. The
forenoon was clear, and radiant with sunshine. There was no breeze
except that which was caused by the motion of the aeroplane. Harvey
had excellent control, and was confident of coming down at the
spot selected, when, without the slightest warning, he was caught
in the fierce grip of an eddy, whirlpool or pocket, or whatever
it might be called, and tossed about as if he were a feather.
The ailerons fluttered and the machine lurched like a mortally
wounded bird, frantically trying to hold its place in the air.
Recalling the instructions of Professor Sperbeck, Harvey did not
run away from the startling flurry, but plunged straight into
it. It was another illustration of the peril to which all aviators
are exposed, of being caught at any unexpected moment by the currents
that must always be invisible.</p>

<p>Harvey braced himself, hoping that a few seconds would carry
him across the zone of danger, and came within a hair of pitching
from his seat. The wabbling machine suddenly tilted upward, and
stood almost vertical. The escape of Detective Pendar was equally
narrow. Although he gripped the supports with both hands, it seemed
to him that for one terrible moment he hung by them alone, with
his legs dangling in midair. He was certain the aeroplane was
capsizing, and he could only wait for the end of all things. Gladly
would he have given the whole reward, which dazzled his vision,
for the privilege of feeling the solid earth under his feet. </p>
