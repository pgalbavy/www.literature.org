<p><em>DANNY MEADOW MOUSE </em>had not enjoyed anything so much
for a long time as he did that game of hide and seek. He tickled
and chuckled all the afternoon as he thought about it. Of course
Reddy had been "it." He had been "it" all the time, for never
once had he caught Danny Meadow Mouse. If he had—well, there wouldn’t
have been any more stories about Danny Meadow Mouse, because there
wouldn’t have been any Danny Meadow Mouse any more.</p>

<p>But Danny never let himself think about this. He had enjoyed
the game all the more because it had been such a dangerous game.
It had been such fun to dive into one of his little round doorways
in the snow, run along one of his own little tunnels, and then
peep out at another doorway and watch Reddy Fox digging as fast
as ever he could at the doorway Danny had just left. Finally Reddy
had given up in disgust and gone off muttering angrily to try
to find something else for dinner. Danny had sat up on the snow
and watched him go. In his funny little squeaky voice Danny shouted:</p>

<p>
"Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!<br/>
&nbsp;I’m just as smart and twice as spry.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!"

<p>That night Reddy Fox told old Granny Fox all about how he had
tried to catch Danny Meadow Mouse. Granny listened with her head
cocked on one side. When Reddy told how fat Danny Meadow Mouse
was, her mouth watered. You see now that snow covered the Green
Meadows and the Green Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had hard work
to get enough to eat, and they were hungry most of the time.</p>

<p>"I’ll go with you down on the meadows to-morrow morning, and
then we’ll see if Danny Meadow Mouse is as smart as he thinks
he is," said Granny Fox.</p>

<p>So, bright and early the next morning, old Granny Fox and Reddy
Fox went down on the meadows where Danny Meadow Mouse lives. Danny
had felt in his bones that Reddy would come back, so he was watching,
and he saw them as soon as they came out of the Green Forest.
When he saw old Granny Fox, Danny’s heart beat a little faster
than before, for he knew that Granny Fox is very smart and very
wise and has learned most of the tricks of all the other little
meadow and forest people.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a more exciting game than the other," said
Danny to himself, and scurried down out of sight to see that all
his little tunnels were clear so that he could run fast through
them if he had to. Then he peeped out of one of his little doorways
hidden in a clump of tall grass.</p>

<p>Old Granny Fox set Reddy to hunting for Danny’s little round
doorways, and as fast as he found them, Granny came up and sniffed
at each. She knew that she could tell by the smell which one he
had been at last. Finally she came straight towards the tall bunch
of grass. Danny ducked down and scurried along one of his little
tunnels. He heard Granny Fox sniff at the doorway he had just
left. Suddenly something plunged down through the snow right at
his very heels. Danny didn’t have to look to know that it was
Granny Fox herself, and he squeaked with fright.</p>
