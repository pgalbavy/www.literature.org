<p>The three mutineers on board the schooner Coral had sailed away
and disappeared from view on the face of the vast Pacific, and
the captain and mate were left with little Inez alone upon a small,
lonely member of the Paumotu Group, in the distant South Seas.</p>

<p>Inez was too young to realize the gravity of the situation, and
she ran hither and thither, delighted with her new home, though
she found the cabin too warm inside to be comfortable, and she
made frequent draughts upon the spring of cool, clear water near
which the former residents of the atoll had built the cabin. Then,
too, she had found that there was considerable tropical fruit
growing in the place, and she made such havoc among it that Captain
Bergen felt impelled to caution her, if she should become sick
on their hands, she would be apt to fare ill, for they had little
medicine at command.</p>

<p>While she was thus engaged, captain and mate were reclining on
the ground, in the shade of the palm-trees. They spoke only now
and then, but there was a peculiar expression on their faces as
they watched the schooner gradually disappearing in the distance,
for it was a long while in sight. The time came at last, however,
when even their straining vision could not detect the faintest
resemblance to a sail in the horizon, though it was still visible,
as a matter of course, through their glasses.</p>

<p>"I believe she is gone," said Storms, looking toward the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes; I see nothing of her."</p>

<p>"Then it's about time to shake."</p>

<p>The two brawny hands clasped, and the friends greeted each other
with remarkable cordiality; and, as they did so, they laughed
heartily, and the mate almost shouted:</p>

<p>"Captain, but it was a good trick!"</p>

<p>"So it was; and I give you the credit of inventing it. I never
would have thought of it."</p>

<p>"Shake again; and now to work."</p>

<p>The mate had deposited some of the oysters brought up on the
bank, and they were carefully opened. They were eight in number,
and there was not found a single pearl among them.</p>

<p>In all probability the entire lot which were carried away upon
the schooner were not worth as much as the same quantity of bivalves
from Chesapeake Bay. In short, this was not the pearl-oyster bed
which had brought the two friends the greater part of the way
around the globe. Suspecting&mdash;or, rather, knowing&mdash;the evil intentions
of the mutineers, Abe Storms proposed the ruse, by which the visit
was made to the wrong place. The mutineers themselves were outwitted,
and, under the belief that they were carrying away a cargo of
fabulous wealth, they did not wait to make an examination of the
mollusks until they were well out to sea.</p>

<p>When they should open and examine them they were not likely to
suspect the trick, but would think that the whole journey was
a failure, and the three left on the island were, in reality,
worse off than themselves.</p>

<p>And yet the true bed of oyster-pearls remained to be visited.</p>

<p>"It is possible they may suspect something and come back again,"
said the mate, "but it is hardly probable."</p>

<p>"Are they likely to send any friends to take us off?" asked the
captain, with a quizzical look.</p>

<p>"Not to any great extent. They will be sure to give us as wide
a berth hereafter as possible. In the meantime, I propose that
we investigate."</p>

<p>The two rose to their feet, and, lugging the armor between them,
moved off toward a point whose location was as well known to them
as if they had spent years upon the atoll.</p>

<p>While they were thus walking, the mate, who was much the better-educated
man, said:</p>

<p>"This pearl-hunting is a curious business. Those specimens that
I brought up were the genuine species, and yet they have very
few or no pearls among them. It must be because the conditions
are not favorable for their creation or development, while, at
the place we are about to visit, the mollusks are the same, and
yet there are conditions existing there which cause an abnormal
growth of the precious jewels."</p>

<p>"Did you make a careful examination of those other oysters?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As I told you, they are genuine, but they have no pearls
of any account, the conditions being unfavorable for their formation.
You know the pearls grow within the oysters, being composed of
slimy secretions deposited around some foreign substance that
enters them. It may be that a peculiar action of the tide drives
a grain of sand into the mollusks, where we are to visit&mdash;though
that is all conjecture."</p>

<p>But Mate Storms, who was only fairly launched out in the discourse
upon pearls, was here interrupted by the captain exclaiming:</p>

<p>"This must be the spot."</p>

<p>The particular bank had been designated so clearly that there
could be no mistake, and had the chart, or map, fallen into the
hands of the mutineers, they would have discovered the trick played
on them in an instant. The spot was a peculiar one where the two
friends stopped. Instead of being partly landlocked like the other,
it opened out fairly upon the sea, and appeared to be entirely
unprotected from the force of the breakers, which boomed against
the beach.</p>

<p>It would have been supposed naturally that the true course was
for the fishermen to go out in a small boat, and make their explorations
from that, but Grebbens had instructed the captain that the formation
was so peculiar that nothing would be gained by this course. The
shore sank like the side of a wall to a considerable depth, and
the oysters lay on the bottom, with some clusters clinging to
the rocks, where they could be torn off like sponges.</p>

<p>It can be understood that the work of removing these would be
almost impossible for any one excepting a professional diver,
unless, as was the case with our friends, he should have some
artificial assistance. But for the diving-armor, it is hardly
possible that Abe Storms would have made a serious attempt to
secure anything, knowing the danger from sharks, and the difficulty
of retaining his breath for any extended time below the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of the afternoon when this spot was reached.
The sea was calm, but there were signs in the sky ominous of a
coming storm, so that the two were anxious to make a beginning
without any unnecessary delay. Stooping almost upon their faces,
when the swell had receded enough to permit them, they peered
down into the crystal depths, and caught shadowy glimpses of the
prizes. They saw the craggy clusters, big and brown, clinging
to the rocks, while others were outlined on the floor of the bank.</p>

<p>"They're there, beyond a doubt," said Storms, "and it now remains
to see whether they are worth the gathering. Help me get on this
suit."</p>

<p>Both worked deftly, and it was soon adjusted. The main thing
was the breathing apparatus, Storms having some fear that at such
a depth the pressure would be so great as to close the pipes,
and thus shut out the air. However, the only way to learn was
by experiment, and he did not wait. Carefully coiling his pipe,
he took the rope in his hand and began descending, the two having
arranged the signals so that with ordinary care no accident need
result. Captain Bergen held one end of the rope in his hand, ready
to draw his friend to the surface the instant he should receive
notice that it was necessary.</p>

<p>"It is a long way to the bottom!" exclaimed the captain, standing
like the harpooner in a whale-boat, and saw the line steadily
paying out.</p>

<p>"It won't do for him to go much further," was his conclusion,
noticing, with some alarm, that but little more of the hose was
left on the ground. "I wish those pearls had fixed themselves
not quite-&mdash;Hello!"</p>

<p>He knew from the instant cessation of the weight on the rope,
and the motionless condition of the hose, that the bottom had
been reached by Abe Storms, and none too soon, either. Peering
carefully into the clear depths, Captain Bergen saw, too, that
his mate was attending to business.</p>
