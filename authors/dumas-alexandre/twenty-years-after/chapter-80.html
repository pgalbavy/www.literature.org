<P>Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in
obtaining an audience of Anne of Austria. It was granted,
and was to take place after her morning's &quot;levee,&quot; at which,
in accordance with his rights of birth, he was entitled to
be present. A vast crowd filled the apartments of Saint
Germain. Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court;
but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of
nobility, while the Prince de Conti, the Duc de Beaufort and
the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of
France.</P>
<P>The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court. The
particular characteristic of this was that more songs were
made than cannons fired during its continuance. The court
made songs on the Parisians and the Parisians on the court;
and the casualties, though not mortal, were painful, as are
all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule.</P>
<P>In the midst of this seeming hilarity, nevertheless,
people's minds were uneasy. Was Mazarin to remain the
favorite and minister of the queen? Was he to be carried
back by the wind which had blown him there? Every one hoped
so, so that the minister felt that all around him, beneath
the homage of the courtiers, lay a fund of hatred, ill
disguised by fear and interest. He felt ill at ease and at a
loss what to do.</P>
<P>Conde himself, whilst fighting for him, lost no opportunity
of ridiculing, of humbling him. The queen, on whom he threw
himself as sole support, seemed to him now not much to be
relied upon.</P>
<P>When the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was
obliged to stay until the queen, who was waited upon by a
new deputation from Paris, had consulted with her minister
as to the propriety and manner of receiving them. All were
fully engrossed with the affairs of the day; Athos could not
therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of
his friends  -  poor atoms, lost in that raging whirlwind.</P>
<P>But Athos was a man of inflexible determination; he firmly
adhered to a purpose once formed, when it seemed to him to
spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of
duty. He insisted on being introduced, saying that although
he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti, or Monsieur de
Beaufort, or Monsieur de Bouillon, or Monsieur d'Elbeuf, or
the coadjutor, or Madame de Longueville, or Broussel, or the
Parliament, and although he had come on his own private
account, he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of
the utmost importance.</P>
<P>The conference being finished, the queen summoned him to her
cabinet.</P>
<P>Athos was introduced and announced by name. It was a name
that too often resounded in her majesty's ears and too often
vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize
it; yet she remained impassive, looking at him with that
fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens,
either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth.</P>
<P>&quot;It is then a service which you propose to render us,
count?&quot; asked Anne of Austria, after a moment's silence.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame, another service,&quot; said Athos, shocked that the
queen did not seem to recognize him.</P>
<P>Athos had a noble heart, and made, therefore, but a poor
courtier.</P>
<P>Anne frowned. Mazarin, who was sitting at a table folding up
papers, as if he had only been a secretary of state, looked
up.</P>
<P>&quot;Speak,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>Mazarin turned again to his papers.</P>
<P>&quot;Madame,&quot; resumed Athos, &quot;two of my friends, named
D'Artagnan and Monsieur du Vallon, sent to England by the
cardinal, suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the
shores of France; no one knows what has become of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;I address myself, therefore, first to the benevolence of
your majesty, that I may know what has become of my friends,
reserving to myself, if necessary, the right of appealing
hereafter to your justice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied Anne, with a degree of haughtiness which to
certain persons became impertinence, &quot;this is the reason
that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing
concerns! an affair for the police! Well, sir, you ought to
know that we no longer have a police, since we are no longer
at Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the
police to know where my friends are, but that if you will
deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any
further inquiry than into his own recollections.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But, God forgive me!&quot; cried Anne, with that disdainful curl
of the lips peculiar to her, &quot;I believe that you are
yourself interrogating.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame, here I have a right to do so, for it concerns
Monsieur d'Artagnan  - -d'Artagnan,&quot; he repeated, in such a
manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the
weak and erring woman.</P>
<P>The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the
assistance of Anne.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; he said, &quot;I can tell you what is at present unknown
to her majesty. These individuals are under arrest. They
disobeyed orders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I beg of your majesty, then,&quot; said Athos, calmly and not
replying to Mazarin, &quot;to quash these arrests of Messieurs
d'Artagnan and du Vallon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not
concern me,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan never made such an answer as that when
the service of your majesty was concerned,&quot; said Athos,
bowing with great dignity. He was going toward the door when
Mazarin stopped him.</P>
<P>&quot;You, too, have been in England, sir?&quot; he said, making a
sign to the queen, who was evidently going to issue a severe
order.</P>
<P>&quot;I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I. Poor king!
culpable, at the most, of weakness, how cruelly punished by
his subjects! Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to
little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of
princes. This is the second time that Monsieur d'Artagnan
has been in England. He went the first time to save the
honor of a great queen; the second, to avert the death of a
great king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Anne to Mazarin, with an accent from which daily
habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real
expression, &quot;see if we can do something for these
gentlemen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish to do, madame, all that your majesty pleases.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests; that is your name, is
it not, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have another name, madame  -  I am called Athos.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame,&quot; said Mazarin, with a smile, &quot;you may rest easy;
your wishes shall be fulfilled.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You hear, sir?&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame, I expected nothing less from the justice of
your majesty. May I not go and see my friends?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir, you shall see them. But, apropos, you belong to
the Fronde, do you not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame, I serve the king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, in your own way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My way is the way of all gentlemen, and I know only one
way,&quot; answered Athos, haughtily.</P>
<P>&quot;Go, sir, then,&quot; said the queen; &quot;you have obtained what you
wish and we know all we desire to know.&quot;</P>
<P>Scarcely, however, had the tapestry closed behind Athos when
she said to Mazarin:</P>
<P>&quot;Cardinal, desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before
he leaves the court.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty,&quot; answered Mazarin, &quot;desires me to do only
what I was going to ask you to let me do. These bravoes who
resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are
troublesome; since there are two of them already there, let
us add a third.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos was not altogether the queen's dupe, but he was not a
man to run away on suspicion  -  above all, when distinctly
told that he should see his friends again. He waited, then,
in the ante-chamber with impatience, till he should be
conducted to them.</P>
<P>He walked to the window and looked into the court. He saw
the deputation from the Parisians enter it; they were coming
to assign the definitive place for the conference and to
make their bow to the queen. A very imposing escort awaited
them without the gates.</P>
<P>Athos was looking on attentively, when some one touched him
softly on the shoulder.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! Monsieur de Comminges,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, count, and charged with a commission for which I beg
of you to accept my excuses.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be so good as to give me up your sword, count.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos smiled and opened the window.</P>
<P>&quot;Aramis!&quot; he cried.</P>
<P>A gentleman turned around. Athos fancied he had seen him
among the crowd. It was Aramis. He bowed with great
friendship to the count.</P>
<P>&quot;Aramis,&quot; cried Athos, &quot;I am arrested.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; replied Aramis, calmly.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Athos, turning to Comminges and giving him
politely his sword by the hilt, &quot;here is my sword; have the
kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison. I
prize it  -  it was given to my ancestor by King Francis I.
In his time they armed gentlemen, not disarmed them. Now,
whither do you conduct me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Into my room first,&quot; replied Comminges; &quot;the queen will
ultimately decide your place of domicile.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word.</P></article>
