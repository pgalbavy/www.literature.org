<p>The palace, or rather the ground which it includes, is several acres in
extent.  A terrace encloses it toward the lagoon; on the side of the
land, a palisade with several gates.  These are scarce intended for
defence; a man, if he were strong, might easily pluck down the palisade;
he need not be specially active to leap from the beach upon the terrace.
There is no parade of guards, soldiers, or weapons; the armoury is under
lock and key; and the only sentinels are certain inconspicuous old women
lurking day and night before the gates.  By day, these crones were often
engaged in boiling syrup or the like household occupation; by night, they
lay ambushed in the shadow or crouched along the palisade, filling the
office of eunuchs to this harem, sole guards upon a tyrant life.
</p>
<p>Female wardens made a fit outpost for this palace of many women.  Of the
number of the king’s wives I have no guess; and but a loose idea of their
function.  He himself displayed embarrassment when they were referred to
as his wives, called them himself ‘my pamily,’ and explained they were
his ‘cutcheons’—cousins.  We distinguished four of the crowd: the king’s
mother; his sister, a grave, trenchant woman, with much of her brother’s
intelligence; the queen proper, to whom (and to whom alone) my wife was
formally presented; and the favourite of the hour, a pretty, graceful
girl, who sat with the king daily, and once (when he shed tears) consoled
him with caresses.  I am assured that even with her his relations are
platonic.  In the background figured a multitude of ladies, the lean, the
plump, and the elephantine, some in sacque frocks, some in the
hairbreadth <u>ridi</u>; high-born and low, slave and mistress; from the queen
to the scullion, from the favourite to the scraggy sentries at the
palisade.  Not all of these of course are of ‘my pamily,’—many are mere
attendants; yet a surprising number shared the responsibility of the
king’s trust.  These were key-bearers, treasurers, wardens of the
armoury, the napery, and the stores.  Each knew and did her part to
admiration.  Should anything be required—a particular gun, perhaps, or a
particular bolt of stuff,—the right queen was summoned; she came bringing
the right chest, opened it in the king’s presence, and displayed her
charge in perfect preservation—the gun cleaned and oiled, the goods duly
folded.  Without delay or haste, and with the minimum of speech, the
whole great establishment turned on wheels like a machine.  Nowhere have
I seen order more complete and pervasive.  And yet I was always reminded
of Norse tales of trolls and ogres who kept their hearts buried in the
ground for the mere safety, and must confide the secret to their wives.
For these weapons are the life of Tembinok’.  He does not aim at
popularity; but drives and braves his subjects, with a simplicity of
domination which it is impossible not to admire, hard not to sympathise
with.  Should one out of so many prove faithless, should the armoury be
secretly unlocked, should the crones have dozed by the palisade and the
weapons find their way unseen into the village, revolution would be
nearly certain, death the most probable result, and the spirit of the
tyrant of Apemama flit to rejoin his predecessors of Mariki and Tapituea.
Yet those whom he so trusts are all women, and all rivals.
</p><p>There is indeed a ministry and staff of males: cook, steward, carpenter,
and supercargoes: the hierarchy of a schooner.  The spies, ‘his majesty’s
daily papers,’ as we called them, come every morning to report, and go
again.  The cook and steward are concerned with the table only.  The
supercargoes, whose business it is to keep tally of the copra at three
pounds a month and a percentage, are rarely in the palace; and two at
least are in the other islands.  The carpenter, indeed, shrewd and jolly
old Rubam—query, Reuben?—promoted on my last visit to the greater dignity
of governor, is daily present, altering, extending, embellishing,
pursuing the endless series of the king’s inventions; and his majesty
will sometimes pass an afternoon watching and talking with Rubam at his
work.  But the males are still outsiders; none seems to be armed, none is
entrusted with a key; by dusk they are all usually departed from the
palace; and the weight of the monarchy and of the monarch’s life reposes
unshared on the women.
</p><p>Here is a household unlike, indeed, to one of ours; more unlike still to
the Oriental harem: that of an elderly childless man, his days menaced,
dwelling alone amid a bevy of women of all ages, ranks, and
relationships,—the mother, the sister, the cousin, the legitimate wife,
the concubine, the favourite, the eldest born, and she of yesterday; he,
in their midst, the only master, the only male, the sole dispenser of
honours, clothes, and luxuries, the sole mark of multitudinous ambitions
and desires.  I doubt if you could find a man in Europe so bold as to
attempt this piece of tact and government.  And seemingly Tembinok’
himself had trouble in the beginning.  I hear of him shooting at a wife
for some levity on board a schooner.  Another, on some more serious
offence, he slew outright; he exposed her body in an open box, and (to
make the warning more memorable) suffered it to putrefy before the palace
gate.  Doubtless his growing years have come to his assistance; for upon
so large a scale it is more easy to play the father than the husband.
And to-day, at least to the eye of a stranger, all seems to go smoothly,
and the wives to be proud of their trust, proud of their rank, and proud
of their cunning lord.
</p><p>I conceived they made rather a hero of the man.  A popular master in a
girls’ school might, perhaps, offer a figure of his preponderating
station.  But then the master does not eat, sleep, live, and wash his
dirty linen in the midst of his admirers; he escapes, he has a room of
his own, he leads a private life; if he had nothing else, he has the
holidays, and the more unhappy Tembinok’ is always on the stage and on
the stretch.
</p><p>In all my coming and going, I never heard him speak harshly or express
the least displeasure.  An extreme, rather heavy, benignity—the benignity
of one sure to be obeyed—marked his demeanour; so that I was at times
reminded of Samual Richardson in his circle of admiring women.  The wives
spoke up and seemed to volunteer opinions, like our wives at home—or,
say, like doting but respectable aunts.  Altogether, I conclude that he
rules his seraglio much more by art than terror; and those who give a
different account (and who have none of them enjoyed my opportunities of
observation) perhaps failed to distinguish between degrees of rank,
between ‘my pamily’ and the hangers-on, laundresses, and prostitutes.
</p><p>A notable feature is the evening game of cards when lamps are set forth
upon the terrace, and ‘I and my pamily’ play for tobacco by the hour.  It
is highly characteristic of Tembinok’ that he must invent a game for
himself; highly characteristic of his worshipping household that they
should swear by the absurd invention.  It is founded on poker, played
with the honours out of many packs, and inconceivably dreary.  But I have
a passion for all games, studied it, and am supposed to be the only white
who ever fairly grasped its principle: a fact for which the wives (with
whom I was not otherwise popular) admired me with acclamation.  It was
impossible to be deceived; this was a genuine feeling: they were proud of
their private game, had been cut to the quick by the want of interest
shown in it by others, and expanded under the flattery of my attention.
Tembinok’ puts up a double stake, and receives in return two hands to
choose from: a shallow artifice which the wives (in all these years) have
not yet fathomed.  He himself, when talking with me privately, made not
the least secret that he was secure of winning; and it was thus he
explained his recent liberality on board the <u>Equator</u>.  He let the wives
buy their own tobacco, which pleased them at the moment.  He won it back
at cards, which made him once more, and without fresh expense, that which
he ought to be,—the sole fount of all indulgences.  And he summed the
matter up in that phrase with which he almost always concludes any
account of his policy: ‘Mo’ betta.’
</p><p>The palace compound is laid with broken coral, excruciating to the eyes
and the bare feet, but exquisitely raked and weeded.  A score or more of
buildings lie in a sort of street along the palisade and scattered on the
margin of the terrace; dwelling-houses for the wives and the attendants,
storehouses for the king’s curios and treasures, spacious maniap’s for
feast or council, some on pillars of wood, some on piers of masonry.  One
was still in hand, a new invention, the king’s latest born: a European
frame-house built for coolness inside a lofty maniap’: its roof planked
like a ship’s deck to be a raised, shady, and yet private promenade.  It
was here the king spent hours with Rubam; here I would sometimes join
them; the place had a most singular appearance; and I must say I was
greatly taken with the fancy, and joined with relish in the counsels of
the architects.
</p><p>Suppose we had business with his majesty by day: we strolled over the
sand and by the dwarfish palms, exchanged a ‘<u>Kõnamaori</u>’ with the crone
on duty, and entered the compound.  The wide sheet of coral glared before
us deserted; all having stowed themselves in dark canvas from the excess
of room.  I have gone to and fro in that labyrinth of a place, seeking
the king; and the only breathing creature I could find was when I peered
under the eaves of a maniap’, and saw the brawny body of one of the wives
stretched on the floor, a naked Amazon plunged in noiseless slumber.  If
it were still the hour of the ‘morning papers’ the quest would be more
easy, the half-dozen obsequious, sly dogs squatting on the ground outside
a house, crammed as far as possible in its narrow shadow, and turning to
the king a row of leering faces.  Tembinok’ would be within, the flaps of
the cabin raised, the trade blowing through, hearing their report.  Like
journalists nearer home, when the day’s news were scanty, these would
make the more of it in words; and I have known one to fill up a barren
morning with an imaginary conversation of two dogs.  Sometimes the king
deigns to laugh, sometimes to question or jest with them, his voice
sounding shrilly from the cabin.  By his side he may have the
heir-apparent, Paul, his nephew and adopted son, six years old, stark
naked, and a model of young human beauty.  And there will always be the
favourite and perhaps two other wives awake; four more lying supine under
mats and whelmed in slumber.  Or perhaps we came later, fell on a more
private hour, and found Tembinok’ retired in the house with the
favourite, an earthenware spittoon, a leaden inkpot, and a commercial
ledger.  In the last, lying on his belly, he writes from day to day the
uneventful history of his reign; and when thus employed he betrayed a
touch of fretfulness on interruption with which I was well able to
sympathise.  The royal annalist once read me a page or so, translating as
he went; but the passage being genealogical, and the author boggling
extremely in his version, I own I have been sometimes better entertained.
Nor does he confine himself to prose, but touches the lyre, too, in his
leisure moments, and passes for the chief bard of his kingdom, as he is
its sole public character, leading architect, and only merchant.
</p><p>His competence, however, does not reach to music; and his verses, when
they are ready, are taught to a professional musician, who sets them and
instructs the chorus.  Asked what his songs were about, Tembinok’
replied, ‘Sweethearts and trees and the sea.  Not all the same true, all
the same lie.’  For a condensed view of lyrical poetry (except that he
seems to have forgot the stars and flowers) this would be hard to mend.
These multifarious occupations bespeak (in a native and an absolute
prince) unusual activity of mind.
</p><p>The palace court at noon is a spot to be remembered with awe, the visitor
scrambling there, on the loose stones, through a splendid nightmare of
light and heat; but the sweep of the wind delivers it from flies and
mosquitoes; and with the set of sun it became heavenly.  I remember it
best on moonless nights.  The air was like a bath of milk.  Countless
shining stars were overhead, the lagoon paved with them.  Herds of wives
squatted by companies on the gravel, softly chatting.  Tembinok’ would
doff his jacket, and sit bare and silent, perhaps meditating songs; the
favourite usually by him, silent also.  Meanwhile in the midst of the
court, the palace lanterns were being lit and marshalled in rank upon the
ground—six or eight square yards of them; a sight that gave one strange
ideas of the number of ‘my pamily’: such a sight as may be seen about
dusk in a corner of some great terminus at home.  Presently these fared
off into all corners of the precinct, lighting the last labours of the
day, lighting one after another to their rest that prodigious company of
women.  A few lingered in the middle of the court for the card-party, and
saw the honours shuffled and dealt, and Tembinok’ deliberating between
his two; hands, and the queens losing their tobacco.  Then these also
were scattered and extinguished; and their place was taken by a great
bonfire, the night-light of the palace.  When this was no more, smaller
fires burned likewise at the gates.  These were tended by the crones,
unseen, unsleeping—not always unheard.  Should any approach in the dark
hours, a guarded alert made the circuit of the palisade; each sentry
signalled her neighbour with a stone; the rattle of falling pebbles
passed and died away; and the wardens of Tembinok’ crouched in their
places silent as before.
