<p>When the vicar's wife went off with a young and penniless man the
scandal knew no bounds.  Her two little girls were only seven and
nine years old respectively.  And the vicar was such a good
husband.  True, his hair was grey.  But his moustache was dark,
he was handsome, and still full of furtive passion for his
unrestrained and beautiful wife.</p>

<p>Why did she go?  Why did she burst away with such an &eacute;clat of
revulsion, like a touch of madness?</p>

<p>Nobody gave any answer.  Only the pious said she was a bad woman.
While some of the good women kept silent.  They knew.</p>

<p>The two little girls never knew.  Wounded, they decided that it was
because their mother found them negligible.</p>

<p>The ill wind that blows nobody any good swept away the vicarage
family on its blast.  Then lo and behold! the vicar, who was
somewhat distinguished as an essayist and a controversialist, and
whose case had aroused sympathy among the bookish men, received the
living of Papplewick.  The Lord had tempered the wind of misfortune
with a rectorate in the north country.</p>

<p>The rectory was a rather ugly stone house down by the river Papple,
before you come into the village.  Further on, beyond where the
road crosses the stream, were the big old stone cotton-mills, once
driven by water.  The road curved uphill, into the bleak stone
streets of the village.</p>

<p>The vicarage family received decided modification, upon its
transference into the rectory.  The vicar, now the rector, fetched
up his old mother and his sister, and a brother from the city.  The
two little girls had a very different milieu from the old home.</p>

<p>The rector was now forty-seven years old, he had displayed an
intense and not very dignified grief after the flight of his wife.
Sympathetic ladies had stayed him from suicide.  His hair was
almost white, and he had a wild-eyed, tragic look.  You had only to
look at him, to know how dreadful it all was, and how he had been
wronged.</p>

<p>Yet somewhere there was a false note.  And some of the ladies, who
had sympathised most profoundly with the vicar, secretly rather
disliked the rector.  There was a certain furtive self-
righteousness about him, when all was said and done.</p>

<p>The little girls, of course, in the vague way of children, accepted
the family verdict.  Granny, who was over seventy and whose sight
was failing, became the central figure in the house.  Aunt Cissie,
who was over forty, pale, pious, and gnawed by an inward worm, kept
house.  Uncle Fred, a stingy and grey-faced man of forty, who just
lived dingily for himself, went into town every day.  And the
rector, of course, was the most important person, after Granny.</p>

<p>They called her The Mater.  She was one of those physically vulgar,
clever old bodies who had got her own way all her life by buttering
the weaknesses of her men-folk.  Very quickly she took her cue.
The rector still &quot;loved&quot; his delinquent wife, and would &quot;love her&quot;
till he died.  Therefore hush!  The rector's feeling was sacred.
In his heart was enshrined the pure girl he had wedded and
worshipped.</p>

<p>Out in the evil world, at the same time, there wandered a
disreputable woman who had betrayed the rector and abandoned his
little children.  She was now yoked to a young and despicable man,
who no doubt would bring her the degradation she deserved.  Let
this be clearly understood, and then hush!  For in the pure
loftiness of the rector's heart still bloomed the pure white
snowflower of his young bride.  This white snowflower did not
wither.  That other creature, who had gone off with that despicable
young man, was none of his affair.</p>

<p>The Mater, who had been somewhat diminished and insignificant as a
widow in a small house, now climbed into the chief arm-chair in the
rectory, and planted her old bulk firmly again.  She was not going
to be dethroned.  Astutely she gave a sigh of homage to the
rector's fidelity to the pure white snowflower, while she pretended
to disapprove.  In sly reverence for her son's great love, she
spoke no word against that nettle which flourished in the evil
world, and which had once been called Mrs. Arthur Saywell.  Now,
thank heaven, having married again, she was no more Mrs. Arthur
Saywell.  No woman bore the rector's name.  The pure white snow-
flower bloomed in perpetuum, without nomenclature.  The family even
thought of her as She-who-was-Cynthia.</p>

<p>All this was water on the Mater's mill.  It secured her against
Arthur's ever marrying again.  She had him by his feeblest
weakness, his skulking self-love.  He had married an imperishable
white snowflower.  Lucky man!  He had been injured!  Unhappy man!
He had suffered.  Ah, what a heart of love!  And he had - forgiven!
Yes, the white snowflower was forgiven.  He even had made provision
in his will for her, when that other scoundrel - But hush!  Don't
even THINK too near to that horrid nettle in the rank outer world!
She-who-was-Cynthia.  Let the white snowflower bloom inaccessible
on the heights of the past.  The present is another story.</p>

<p>The children were brought up in this atmosphere of cunning self-
sanctification and of unmentionability.  They too, saw the
snowflower on inaccessible heights.  They too knew that it was
throned in lone splendour aloft their lives, never to be touched.</p>

<p>At the same time, out of the squalid world sometimes would come a
rank, evil smell of selfishness and degraded lust, the smell of
that awful nettle, She-who-was-Cynthia.  This nettle actually
contrived, at intervals, to get a little note through to her girls,
her children.  And at this the silver-haired Mater shook inwardly
with hate.  For if She-who-was-Cynthia ever came back, there
wouldn't be much left of the Mater.  A secret gust of hate went
from the old granny to the girls, children of that foul nettle of
lust, that Cynthia who had had such an affectionate contempt for
the Mater.</p>

<p>Mingled with all this, was the children's perfectly distinct
recollection of their real home, the Vicarage in the south, and
their glamorous but not very dependable mother, Cynthia.  She had
made a great glow, a flow of life, like a swift and dangerous sun
in the home, forever coming and going.  They always associated her
presence with brightness, but also with danger; with glamour, but
with fearful selfishness.</p>

<p>Now the glamour was gone, and the white snowflower, like a
porcelain wreath, froze on its grave.  The danger of instability,
the peculiarly DANGEROUS sort of selfishness, like lions and
tigers, was also gone.  There was now a complete stability, in
which one could perish safely.</p>

<p>But they were growing up.  And as they grew, they became more
definitely confused, more actively puzzled.  The Mater, as she grew
older, grew blinder.  Somebody had to lead her about.  She did not
get up till towards midday.  Yet blind or bed-ridden, she held the
house.</p>

<p>Besides, she wasn't bed-ridden.  Whenever the MEN were present, the
Mater was in her throne.  She was too cunning to court neglect.
Especially as she had rivals.</p>

<p>Her great rival was the younger girl, Yvette.  Yvette had some of
the vague, careless blitheness of She-who-was-Cynthia.  But this
one was more docile.  Granny perhaps had caught her in time.
Perhaps!</p>

<p>The rector adored Yvette, and spoiled her with a doting fondness;
as much as to say: am I not a soft-hearted, indulgent old boy!  He
liked to have weaknesses to a hair's-breadth.  She knew them, this
opinion of himself, and the Mater knew his and she traded on them
by turning them into decorations for him, for his character.  He
wanted, in his own eyes, to have a fascinating character, as women
want to have fascinating dresses.  And the Mater cunningly put
beauty-spots over his defects and deficiencies.  Her mother-love
gave her the clue to his weaknesses, and she hid them for him with
decorations.  Whereas She-who-was-Cynthia - !  But don't mention
HER, in this connection.  In her eyes, the rector was almost
humpbacked and an idiot.</p>

<p>The funny thing was, Granny secretly hated Lucille, the elder girl,
more than the pampered Yvette.  Lucille, the uneasy and irritable,
was more conscious of being under Granny's power, than was the
spoilt and vague Yvette.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Aunt Cissie hated Yvette.  She hated her very
name.  Aunt Cissie's life had been sacrificed to the Mater, and
Aunt Cissie knew it, and the Mater knew she knew it.  Yet as the
years went on, it became a convention.  The convention of Aunt
Cissie's sacrifice was accepted by everybody, including the self-
same Cissie.  She prayed a good deal about it.  Which also showed
that she had her own private feelings somewhere, poor thing.  She
had ceased to be Cissie, she had lost her life and her sex.  And
now, she was creeping towards fifty, strange green flares of rage
would come up in her, and at such times, she was insane.</p>

<p>But Granny held her in her power.  And Aunt Cissie's one object in
life was to look after The Mater.</p>

<p>Aunt Cissie's green flares of hellish hate would go up against all
young things, sometimes.  Poor thing, she prayed and tried to
obtain forgiveness from heaven.  But what had been done to her, SHE
could not forgive, and the vitriol would spurt in her veins
sometimes.</p>

<p>It was not as if the Mater were a warm, kindly soul.  She wasn't.
She only seemed it, cunningly.  And the fact dawned gradually on
the girls.  Under her old-fashioned lace cap, under her silver
hair, under the black silk of her stout, forward-bulging body, this
old woman had a cunning heart, seeking forever her own female
power.  And through the weakness of the unfresh, stagnant men she
had bred, she kept her power, as her years rolled on, seventy to
eighty, and from eighty on the new lap, towards ninety.</p>

<p>For in the family there was a whole tradition of &quot;loyalty&quot;; loyalty
to one another, and especially to the Mater.  The Mater, of course,
was the pivot of the family.  The family was her own extended ego.
Naturally she covered it with her power.  And her sons and
daughters, being weak and disintegrated, naturally were loyal.
Outside the family, what was there for them but danger and insult
and ignominy?  Had not the rector experienced it, in his marriage.
So now, caution!  Caution and loyalty, fronting the world!  Let
there be as much hate and friction INSIDE the family, as you like.
To the outer world, a stubborn fence of unison.</p>
