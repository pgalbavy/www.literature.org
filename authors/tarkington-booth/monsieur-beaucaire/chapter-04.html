<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There fell a clear September night, when the moon was radiant
over town and country, over cobbled streets and winding roads.
From the fields the mists rose slowly, and the air was mild and
fragrant, while distances were white and full of mystery. All
of Bath that pretended to fashion or condition was present that
evening at a fete at the house of a country gentleman of the neighborhood.
When the stately junket was concluded, it was the pleasure of
M. de Chateaurien to form one of the escort of Lady Mary's carriage
for the return. As they took the road, Sir Hugh Guilford and Mr.
Bantison, engaging in indistinct but vigorous remonstrance with
Mr. Molyneux over some matter, fell fifty or more paces behind,
where they continued to ride, keeping up their argument. Half
a dozen other gallants rode in advance, muttering among themselves,
or attended laxly upon Lady Mary's aunt on the other side of the
coach, while the happy Frenchman was permitted to ride close to
that adorable window which framed the fairest face in England.</p>

<p>He sang for her a little French song, a song of the voyageur
who dreamed of home. The lady, listening, looking up at the bright
moon, felt a warm drop upon her cheek, and he saw the tears sparkling
upon her lashes.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he whispered then, "I, too, have been a wanderer,
but my dreams were not of France; no, I do not dream of that home,
of that dear country. It is of a dearer country, a dream country&mdash;a
country of gold and snow," he cried softly, looking it her white
brow and the fair, lightly powdered hair above it. "Gold and snow,
and the blue sky of a lady's eyes!"</p>

<p>"I had thought the ladies of France were dark, sir.</p>

<p>"Cruel! It is that she will not understan'! Have I speak of the
ladies of France? No, no, no! It is of the faires' country; yes,
'tis a province of heaven, mademoiselle. Do I not renounce my
allegiance to France? Oh, yes! I am subjec'&mdash;no, content to be
slave&mdash;in the lan' of the blue sky, the gold, and the snow.</p>

<p>"A very pretty figure," answered Lady Mary, her eyes downcast.
"But does it not hint a notable experience in the making of such
speeches?"</p>

<p>"Tormentress! No. It prove only the inspiration it is to know
you."</p>

<p>"We English ladies hear plenty of the like sir; and we even grow
brilliant enough to detect the assurance that lies beneath the
courtesies of our own gallants."</p>

<p>"Merci! I should believe so!" ejaculated M. de Chateaurien: but
he smothered the words upon his lips.</p>

<p>Her eyes were not lifted. She went on: "We come, in time, to
believe that true feeling comes faltering forth, not glibly; that
smoothness betokens the adept in the art, sir, rather than your
true&mdash;your true&mdash;"  She was herself faltering; more, blushing
deeply, and halting to a full stop in terror of a word. There
was a silence.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;true&mdash;lover," he said huskily. When he had said that word
both trembled. She turned half away into the darkness of the coach.</p>

<p>"I know what make' you to doubt me," he said, faltering himself,
though it was not his art that prompted him. "They have tol' you
the French do nothing always but make love, is it not so? Yes,
you think I am like that. You think I am like that now!"</p>

<p>She made no sign.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he sighed, "I am unriz'nable; I would have the snow
not so col'&mdash;for jus' me."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Turn to me," he said.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the fields came to them, and from the distance
the faint, clear note of a hunting-horn.</p>

<p>"Turn to me."</p>

<p>The lovely head was bent very low. Her little gloved hand lay
upon the narrow window ledge. He laid his own gently upon it.
The two hands were shaking like twin leaves in the breeze. Hers
was not drawn away. After a pause, neither knew how long, he felt
the warm fingers turn and clasp themselves tremulously about his
own. At last she looked up bravely and met his eyes. The horn
was wound again&mdash;nearer.</p>

<p>"All the cold was gone from the snows&mdash;long ago," she said.</p>

<p>"My beautiful!" he whispered; it was all he could say. "My beautiful!" 
But she clutched his arm, startled.</p>

<p>"'Ware the road!" A wild halloo sounded ahead. The horn wound
loudly. "'Ware the road!" There sprang up out of the night a flying
thunder of hoof-beats. The gentlemen riding idly in front of the
coach scattered to the hedge-sides; and, with drawn swords flashing
in the moon, a party of horsemen charged down the highway, their
cries blasting the night.</p>

<p>"Barber! Kill the barber!" they screamed. "Barber! Kill the barber!"</p>

<p>Beaucaire had but time to draw his sword when they were upon
him.</p>

<p>"A moi!" his voice rang out clearly as he rose in his stirrups.
"A moi, Francois, Louis, Berquin! A moi, Francois!"</p>

<p>The cavaliers came straight at him. He parried the thrust of
the first, but the shock of collision hurled his horse against
the side of the coach. "Sacred swine!" he cried bitterly. "To
endanger a lady, to make this brawl in a lady's presence! Drive
on!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Lady Mary.</p>

<p>The Frenchman's assailants were masked, but they were not highwaymen.
"Barber! Barber!" they shouted hoarsely, and closed in on him
in a circle.</p>

<p>"See how he use his steel!" laughed M. Beaucaire, as his point
passed through a tawdry waistcoat. For a moment he cut through
the ring and cleared a space about him, and Lady Mary saw his
face shining in the moonlight. "Canaille!" he hissed, as his horse
sank beneath him; and, though guarding his head from the rain
of blows from above, he managed to drag headlong from his saddle
the man who had hamstrung the poor brute. The fellow came suddenly
to the ground, and lay there.</p>

<p>"Is it not a compliment," said a heavy voice, "to bring six large
men to subdue monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are there, my frien'! In the rear&mdash;a little in the rear,
I think. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>The Frenchman's play with his weapon was a revelation of skill,
the more extraordinary as he held in his hand only a light dress
sword. But the ring closed about him, and his keen defense could
not avail him for more than a few moments. Lady Mary's outriders,
the gallants of her escort, rode up close to the coach and encircled
it, not interfering.</p>

<p>"Sir Hugh Guilford!" cried Lady Mary wildly, "if you will not
help him, give me your sword!" She would have leaped to the ground,
but Sir Hugh held the door.</p>

<p>"Sit quiet, madam," he said to her; then, to the man on the box,
"Drive on."</p>

<p>"If he does, I'll kill him!" she said fiercely. "Ah, what cowards!
Will you see the Duke murdered?"</p>

<p>"The Duke!" laughed Guilford. "They will not kill him, unless&mdash;be
easy, dear madam, 'twill be explained. Gad's life!" he muttered
to Molyneux, "'Twere time the varlet had his lashing! D'ye hear
her?"</p>

<p>"Barber or no barber," answered Molyneux, "I wish I had warned
him. He fights as few gentlemen could. Ah&mdash;ah! Look at that! 'Tis
a shame!"</p>

<p>On foot, his hat gone, his white coat sadly rent and gashed,
flecked, too, with red, M. Beaucaire, wary, alert, brilliant,
seemed to transform himself into a dozen fencing-masters; and,
though his skill appeared to lie in delicacy and quickness, his
play being continually with the point, sheer strength failed to
beat him down. The young man was laughing like a child.</p>

<p>"Believe me," said Molyneux "he's no barber! No, and never was!"</p>

<p>For a moment there was even a chance that M. Beaucaire might
have the best of it. Two of his adversaries were prostrate, more
than one were groaning, and the indomitable Frenchman had actually
almost beat off the ruffians, when, by a trick, he was overcome.
One of them, dismounting, ran in suddenly from behind, and seized
his blade in a thick leather gauntlet. Before Beaucaire could
disengage the weapon, two others threw themselves from their horses
and hurled him to the earth. "A moi! A moi, Francois!" he cried
as he went down, his sword in fragments, but his voice unbroken
and clear.</p>

<p>"Shame!" muttered one or two of the gentlemen about the coach.</p>

<p>"'Twas dastardly to take him so," said Molyneux. "Whatever his
deservings, I'm nigh of a mind to offer him a rescue in the Duke's
face."</p>

<p>"Truss him up, lads," said the heavy voice. "Clear the way in
front of the coach. There sit those whom we avenge upon a presumptuous
lackey. Now, Whiffen, you have a fair audience, lay on and baste
him."</p>

<p>Two men began to drag M. Beaucaire toward a great oak by the
roadside. Another took from his saddle a heavy whip with three
thongs.</p>

<p>"A moi, Francois!"</p>

<p>There was borne on the breeze an answer&mdash;"Monseigneur! Monseigneur!" 
The cry grew louder suddenly. The clatter of hoofs urged to an
anguish of speed sounded on the night. M. Beaucaire's servants
had lagged sorely behind, but they made up for it now. Almost
before the noise of their own steeds they came riding down the
moonlit aisle between the mists. Chosen men, these servants of
Beaucaire, and like a thunderbolt they fell upon the astounded
cavaliers.</p>

<p>"Chateaurien! Chateaurien!" they shouted, and smote so swiftly
that, through lack of time, they showed no proper judgment, discriminating
nothing between non-combatants and their master's foes. They charged
first into the group about M. Beaucaire, and broke and routed
it utterly. Two of them leaped to the young man's side, while
the other four, swerving, scarce losing the momentum of their
onset, bore on upon the gentlemen near the coach, who went down
beneath the fierceness of the onslaught, cursing manfully.</p>

<p>"Our just deserts," said Mr. Molyneux, his mouth full of dust
and philosophy.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Guilford's horse fell with him, being literally ridden
over, and the baronet's leg was pinned under the saddle. In less
than ten minutes from the first attack on M. Beaucaire, the attacking
party had fled in disorder, and the patrician non-combatants,
choking with expletives, consumed with wrath, were prisoners,
disarmed by the Frenchman's lackeys.</p>

<p>Guilford's discomfiture had freed the doors of the coach; so
it was that when M. Beaucaire, struggling to rise, assisted by
his servants, threw out one hand to balance himself, he found
it seized between two small, cold palms, and he looked into two
warm, dilating eyes, that were doubly beautiful because of the
fright and rage that found room in them, too.</p>

<p>M. le Duc Chateaurien sprang to his feet without the aid of his
lackeys, and bowed low before Lady Mary.</p>

<p>"I make ten thousan' apology to be' the cause of a such melee
in your presence," he said; and then, turning to Francois, he
spoke in French: "Ah, thou scoundrel! A little, and it had been
too late."</p>

<p>Francois knelt in the dust before him. "Pardon!" he said. "Monseigneur
commanded us to follow far in the rear, to remain unobserved.
The wind malignantly blew against monseigneur's voice."</p>

<p>"See what it might have cost, my children," said his master,
pointing to the ropes with which they would have bound him and
to the whip lying beside them. A shudder passed over the lackey's
frame; the utter horror in his face echoed in the eyes of his
fellows.</p>

<p>"Oh, monseigneur!" Francois sprang back, and tossed his arms
to heaven.</p>

<p>"But it did not happen," said M. Beaucaire.</p>

<p>"It could not!" exclaimed Francois.</p>

<p>"No. And you did very well, my children&mdash;" the young man smiled
benevolently&mdash;"very well. And now," he continued, turning to Lady
Mary and speaking in English, "let me be asking of our gallants
yonder what make' them to be in cabal with highwaymen. One should
come to a polite understanding with them, you think? Not so?"</p>

<p>He bowed, offering his hand to conduct her to the coach, where
Molyneux and his companions, having drawn Sir Hugh from under
his horse, were engaged in reviving and reassuring Lady Rellerton,
who had fainted. But Lady Mary stayed Beaucaire with a gesture,
and the two stood where they were.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur!" she said, with a note of raillery in her voice,
but raillery so tender that he started with happiness. His movement
brought him a hot spasm of pain, and he clapped his hand to a
red stain on his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"You are hurt!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," smiled M. Beaucaire. Then, that she might not
see the stain spreading, he held his handkerchief over the spot.
"I am a little&mdash;but jus' a trifling&mdash;bruise'; 'tis all."</p>

<p>"You shall ride in the coach," she whispered. "Will you be pleased,
M. de Chateaurien?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my beautiful!" She seemed to wave before him like a shining
mist. "I wish that ride might las' for always! Can you say that,
mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," she cried in a passion of admiration, "I would
what you would have be, should be. What do you not deserve? You
are the bravest man in the world!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I am jus' a poor Frenchman."</p>

<p>"Would that a few Englishmen had shown themselves as 'poor' tonight.
The vile cowards, not to help you!" With that, suddenly possessed
by her anger, she swept away from him to the coach.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh, groaning loudly, was being assisted into the vehicle.</p>

<p>"My little poltroons," she said, "what are you doing with your
fellow-craven, Sir Hugh Guilford, there?"</p>

<p>"Madam," replied Molyneux humbly, "Sir Hugh's leg is broken.
Lady Rellerton graciously permits him to be taken in."</p>

<p>"I do not permit it! M. de Chateaurien rides with us."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir! Leave the wretch to groan by the roadside," she cried fiercely,
"which plight I would were that of all of you! But there will
be a pretty story for the gossips to-morrow! And I could almost
find pity for you when I think of the wits when you return to
town. Fine gentlemen you; hardy bravos, by heaven! to leave one
man to meet a troop of horse single-handed, while you huddle in
shelter until you are overthrown and disarmed by servants! Oh,
the wits! Heaven save you from the wits!"</p>

<p>"Madam."</p>

<p>"Address me no more! M. de Chateaurien, Lady Rellerton and I
will greatly esteem the honor of your company. Will you come?"</p>

<p>She stepped quickly into the coach, and was gathering her skirts
to make room for the Frenchman, when a heavy voice spoke from
the shadows of the tree by the wayside.</p>

<p>"Lady Mary Carlisle will, no doubt, listen to a word of counsel
on this point."</p>

<p>The Duke of Winterset rode out into the moonlight, composedly
untieing a mask from about his head. He had not shared the flight
of his followers, but had retired into the shade of the oak, whence
he now made his presence known with the utmost coolness.</p>

<p>"Gracious heavens, 'tis Winterset!" exclaimed Lady Rellerton.</p>

<p>"Turned highwayman and cut-throat," cried Lady Mary.</p>

<p>"No, no," laughed M. Beaucaire, somewhat unsteadily, as he stood,
swaying a little, with one hand on the coach-door, the other pressed
hard on his side, "he only oversee'; he is jus' a little bashful,
sometime'. He is a great man, but he don' want all the glory!"</p>

<p>"Barber," replied the Duke, "I must tell you that I gladly descend
to bandy words with you; your monstrous impudence is a claim to
rank I cannot ignore. But a lackey who has himself followed by
six other lackeys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Has not M. le Duc been busy all this evening to justify
me? And I think mine mus' be the bes' six. Ha, ha! You think?"</p>

<p>"M. de Chateaurien," said Lady Mary, "we are waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Pardon," he replied. "He has something to say; maybe it is bes'
if you hear it now."</p>

<p>"I wish to hear nothing from him&mdash;ever!"</p>

<p>"My faith, madam," cried the Duke, "this saucy fellow has paid
you the last insult! He is so sure of you he does not fear you
will believe the truth. When all is told, if you do not agree
he deserved the lashing we planned to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll hear no more!"</p>

<p>"You will bitterly repent it, madam. For your own sake I entreat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I also," broke in M. Beaucaire. "Permit me, mademoiselle;
let him speak."</p>

<p>"Then let him be brief," said Lady Mary, "for I am earnest to
be quit of him. His explanation or an attack on my friend and
on my carriage should be made to my brother."</p>

<p>"Alas that he was not here," said the Duke, "to aid me! Madam,
was your carriage threatened? I have endeavored only to expunge
a debt I owed to Bath and to avenge an insult offered to yourself
through&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir, sir, my patience will bear little more!"</p>

<p>"A thousan' apology," said M. Beaucaire. "You will listen, I
only beg, Lady Mary?"</p>

<p>She made an angry gesture of assent.</p>

<p>"Madam, I will be brief as I may. Two months ago there came to
Bath a French gambler calling himself Beaucaire, a desperate fellow
with the cards or dice, and all the men of fashion went to play
at his lodging, where he won considerable sums. He was small,
wore a black wig and mustachio. He had the insolence to show himself
everywhere until the Master of Ceremonies rebuffed him in the
pump-room, as you know, and after that he forbore his visits to
the rooms. Mr. Nash explained (and was confirmed, madam, by indubitable
information) that this Beaucaire was a man of unspeakable, vile,
low birth, being, in fact, no other than a lackey of the French
king's ambassador, Victor by name, de Mirepoix's barber. Although
his condition was known, the hideous impudence of the fellow did
not desert him, and he remained in Bath, where none would speak
to him."</p>

<p>"Is your farrago nigh done, sir?"</p>

<p>"A few moments, madam. One evening, three weeks gone, I observed
a very elegant equipage draw up to my door, and the Duke of Chateaurien
was announced. The young man's manners were worthy&mdash;according
to the French acceptance&mdash;and 'twere idle to deny him the most
monstrous assurance. He declared himself a noble traveling for
pleasure. He had taken lodgings in Bath for a season, he said,
and called at once to pay his respects to me. His tone was so
candid&mdash;in truth, I am the simplest of men, very easily gulled&mdash;and
his stroke so bold, that I did not for one moment suspect him;
and, to my poignant regret&mdash;though in the humblest spirit I have
shown myself eager to atone&mdash;that very evening I had the shame
of presenting him to yourself."</p>

<p>"The shame, sir!"</p>

<p>"Have patience, pray, madam. Ay, the shame! You know what figure
he hath cut in Bath since that evening. All ran merrily with him
until several days ago Captain Badger denounced him as an impostor,
vowing that Chateaurien was nothing."</p>

<p>"Pardon," interrupted M. Beaucaire. "'Castle Nowhere' would have
been so much better. Why did you not make him say it that way,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>Lady Mary started; she was looking at the Duke, and her face
was white. He continued: "Poor Captain Badger was stabbed that
same day.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Most befitting poor Captain Badger," muttered Molyneux.</p>

<p>"-&mdash;And his adversary had the marvelous insolence to declare
that he fought in my quarrel! This afternoon the wounded man sent
for me, and imparted a very horrifying intelligence. He had discovered
a lackey whom he had seen waiting upon Beaucaire in attendance
at the door of this Chateaurien's lodging. Beaucaire had disappeared
the day before Chateaurien's arrival. Captain Badger looked closely
at Chateaurien at their next meeting, and identified him with
the missing Beaucaire beyond the faintest doubt. Overcome with
indignation, he immediately proclaimed the impostor. Out of regard
for me, he did not charge him with being Beaucaire; the poor soul
was unwilling to put upon me the humiliation of having introduced
a barber; but the secret weighed upon him till he sent for me
and put everything in my hands. I accepted the odium; thinking
only of atonement. I went to Sir John Wimpledon's. I took poor
Sir Hugh, there, and these other gentlemen aside, and told them
my news. We narrowly observed this man, and were shocked at our
simplicity in not having discovered him before. These are men
of honor and cool judgment, madam. Mr. Molyneux had acted for
him in the affair of Captain Badger, and was strongly prejudiced
in his favor; but Mr. Molyneux, Sir Hugh, Mr. Bantison, every
one of them, in short, recognized him. In spite of his smooth
face and his light hair, the adventurer Beaucaire was writ upon
him amazing plain. Look at him, madam, if he will dare the inspection.
You saw this Beaucaire well, the day of his expulsion from the
rooms. Is not this he?"</p>

<p>M. Beaucaire stepped close to her. Her pale face twitched.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" she whispered with a dry throat, and fell back in the
carriage.</p>

<p>"Is it so?" cried the Duke.</p>

<p>"I do not know. &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>cannot tell."</p>

<p>"One moment more. I begged these gentlemen to allow me to wipe
out the insult I had unhappily offered to Bath, but particularly
to you. They agreed not to forestall me or to interfere. I left
Sir John Wimpledon's early, and arranged to give the sorry rascal
a lashing under your own eyes, a satisfaction due the lady into
whose presence he had dared to force himself."</p>

<p>"'Noblesse oblige'?" said M. Beaucaire in a tone of gentle inquiry.</p>

<p>"And now, madam," said the Duke, "I will detain you not one second
longer. I plead the good purpose of my intentions, begging you
to believe that the desire to avenge a hateful outrage, next to
the wish to serve you, forms the dearest motive in the heart of
Winterset."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Beaucaire softly.</p>

<p>Lady Mary leaned toward him, a thriving terror in her eyes. "It
is false?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Monsieur should not have been born so high. He could have made
little book'."</p>

<p>"You mean it is false?" she cried breathlessly.</p>

<p>"'Od's blood, is she not convinced?" broke out Mr. Bantison.
"Fellow, were you not the ambassador's barber?"</p>

<p>"It is all false?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"The mos' fine art, mademoiselle. How long you think it take
M. de Winterset to learn that speech after he write it out? It
is a mix of what is true and the mos' chaste art. Monsieur has
become a man of letters. Perhaps he may enjoy that more than the
wars. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bantison burst into a roar of laughter. "Do French gentlemen
fight lackeys? Ho, ho, ho! A pretty country! We English do as
was done to-night, have our servants beat them."</p>

<p>"And attend ourselves," added M. Beaucaire, looking at the Duke,
"somewhat in the background? But, pardon," he mocked, "that remind'
me. Francois, return to Mr. Bantison and these gentlemen their
weapons."</p>

<p>"Will you answer a question?" said Molyneux mildly.</p>

<p>"Oh, with pleasure, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Were you ever a barber?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," laughed the young man.</p>

<p>"Pah!" exclaimed Bantison. "Let me question him. Now, fellow,
a confession may save you from jail. Do you deny you are Beaucaire?"</p>

<p>"Deny to a such judge?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Bantison. "What more do you want, Molyneux? Fellow,
do you deny that you came to London in the ambassador's suite?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not deny."</p>

<p>"He admits it! Didn't you come as his barber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my frien', as his barber." Lady Mary cried out faintly,
and, shuddering, put both hands over her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Molyneux. "You fight like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I thank you, monsieur."</p>

<p>"You called yourself Beaucaire?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur." He was swaying to and fro; his servants ran
to support him.</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;" continued Molyneux, hesitating. "Evil take me!&mdash;but
I'm sorry you're hurt."</p>

<p>"Assist Sir Hugh into my carriage," said Lady Mary.</p>

<p>"Farewell, mademoiselle!" M. Beaucaire's voice was very faint.
His eyes were fixed upon her face. She did not look toward him.</p>

<p>They were propping Sir Hugh on the cushions. The Duke rode up
close to Beaucaire, but Francois seized his bridle fiercely, and
forced the horse back on its haunches.</p>

<p>"The man's servants worship him," said Molyneux.</p>

<p>"Curse your insolence!" exclaimed the Duke. "How much am I to
bear from this varlet and his varlets? Beaucaire, if you have
not left Bath by to-morrow noon, you will be clapped into jail,
and the lashing you escaped to-night shall be given you thrice
tenfold!"</p>

<p>"I shall be-in the&mdash;Assemily &mdash;Room' at nine&mdash;o'clock, one
week &mdash;from&mdash;to-night," answered the young man, smiling jauntily,
though his lips were colorless. The words cost him nearly all
his breath and strength. "You mus' keep&mdash;in the&mdash;backgroun', monsieur.
Ha, ha!" The door of the coach closed with a slam.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle&mdash;fare&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"Drive on!" said Lady Mary.</p>

<p>M. Beaucaire followed the carriage with his eyes. As the noise
of the wheels and the hoof-beats of the accompanying cavalcade
grew fainter in the distance, the handkerchief he had held against
his side dropped into the white dust, a heavy red splotch.</p>

<p>"Only&mdash;roses," he gasped, and fell back in the arms of his servants.</p>
