<p>It was a mile nearer through the wood.  Mechanically, Syson turned
up by the forge and lifted the field-gate.  The blacksmith and his
mate stood still, watching the trespasser.  But Syson looked too
much a gentleman to be accosted.  They let him go in silence across
the small field to the wood.</p>

<p>There was not the least difference between this morning and those
of the bright springs, six or eight years back.  White and sandy-
gold fowls still scratched round the gate, littering the earth and
the field with feathers and scratched-up rubbish.  Between the two
thick holly bushes in the wood-hedge was the hidden gap, whose
fence one climbed to get into the wood; the bars were scored just
the same by the keeper's boots.  He was back in the eternal.</p>

<p>Syson was extraordinarily glad.  Like an uneasy spirit he had
returned to the country of his past, and he found it waiting for
him, unaltered.  The hazel still spread glad little hands
downwards, the bluebells here were still wan and few, among the
lush grass and in shade of the bushes.</p>

<p>The path through the wood, on the very brow of a slope, ran winding
easily for a time.  All around were twiggy oaks, just issuing their
gold, and floor spaces diapered with woodruff, with patches of dog-
mercury and tufts of hyacinth.  Two fallen trees still lay across
the track.  Syson jolted down a steep, rough slope, and came again
upon the open land, this time looking north as through a great
window in the wood.  He stayed to gaze over the level fields of the
hill-top, at the village which strewed the bare upland as if it had
tumbled off the passing waggons of industry, and been forsaken.
There was a stiff, modern, grey little church, and blocks and rows
of red dwellings lying at random; at the back, the twinkling
headstocks of the pit, and the looming pit-hill.  All was naked and
out-of-doors, not a tree!  It was quite unaltered.</p>

<p>Syson turned, satisfied, to follow the path that sheered downhill
into the wood.  He was curiously elated, feeling himself back in an
enduring vision.  He started.  A keeper was standing a few yards in
front, barring the way.</p>

<p>&quot;Where might you be going this road, sir?&quot; asked the man.  The tone
of his question had a challenging twang.  Syson looked at the
fellow with an impersonal, observant gaze.  It was a young man of
four or five and twenty, ruddy and well favoured.  His dark blue
eyes now stared aggressively at the intruder.  His black moustache,
very thick, was cropped short over a small, rather soft mouth.  In
every other respect the fellow was manly and good-looking.  He
stood just above middle height; the strong forward thrust of his
chest, and the perfect ease of his erect, self-sufficient body,
gave one the feeling that he was taut with animal life, like the
thick jet of a fountain balanced in itself.  He stood with the butt
of his gun on the ground, looking uncertainly and questioningly at
Syson.  The dark, restless eyes of the trespasser, examining the
man and penetrating into him without heeding his office, troubled
the keeper and made him flush.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is Naylor?  Have you got his job?&quot; Syson asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You're not from the House, are you?&quot; inquired the keeper.  It
could not be, since everyone was away.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not from the House,&quot; the other replied.  It seemed to
amuse him.</p>

<p>&quot;Then might I ask where you were making for?&quot; said the keeper,
nettled.</p>

<p>&quot;Where I am making for?&quot; Syson repeated.  &quot;I am going to Willey-
Water Farm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't the road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so.  Down this path, past the well, and out by the white
gate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that's not the public road.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose not.  I used to come so often, in Naylor's time, I had
forgotten.  Where is he, by the way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crippled with rheumatism,&quot; the keeper answered reluctantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he?&quot; Syson exclaimed in pain.</p>

<p>&quot;And who might you be?&quot; asked the keeper, with a new intonation.</p>

<p>&quot;John Adderley Syson; I used to live in Cordy Lane.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Used to court Hilda Millership?&quot;</p>

<p>Syson's eyes opened with a pained smile.  He nodded.  There was an
awkward silence.</p>

<p>&quot;And you - who are you?&quot; asked Syson.</p>

<p>&quot;Arthur Pilbeam - Naylor's my uncle,&quot; said the other.</p>

<p>&quot;You live here in Nuttall?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm lodgin' at my uncle's - at Naylor's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you say you was goin' down to Willey-Water?&quot; asked the keeper.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause of some moments, before the keeper blurted:  &quot;I'M
courtin' Hilda Millership.&quot;</p>

<p>The young fellow looked at the intruder with a stubborn defiance,
almost pathetic.  Syson opened new eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you?&quot; he said, astonished.  The keeper flushed dark.</p>

<p>&quot;She and me are keeping company,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know!&quot; said Syson.  The other man waited uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&quot;What, is the thing settled?&quot; asked the intruder.</p>

<p>&quot;How, settled?&quot; retorted the other sulkily.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to get married soon, and all that?&quot;</p>

<p>The keeper stared in silence for some moments, impotent.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; he said, full of resentment.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;  Syson watched closely.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm married myself,&quot; he added, after a time.</p>

<p>&quot;You are?&quot; said the other incredulously.</p>

<p>Syson laughed in his brilliant, unhappy way.</p>

<p>&quot;This last fifteen months,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The keeper gazed at him with wide, wondering eyes, apparently
thinking back, and trying to make things out.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, didn't you know?&quot; asked Syson.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I didn't,&quot; said the other sulkily.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well!&quot; said Syson, &quot;I will go on.  I suppose I may.&quot;  The
keeper stood in silent opposition.  The two men hesitated in the
open, grassy space, set around with small sheaves of sturdy
bluebells; a little open platform on the brow of the hill.  Syson
took a few indecisive steps forward, then stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, how beautiful!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p>He had come in full view of the downslope.  The wide path ran from
his feet like a river, and it was full of bluebells, save for a
green winding thread down the centre, where the keeper walked.
Like a stream the path opened into azure shallows at the levels,
and there were pools of bluebells, with still the green thread
winding through, like a thin current of ice-water through blue
lakes.  And from under the twig-purple of the bushes swam the
shadowed blue, as if the flowers lay in flood water over the
woodland.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, isn't it lovely!&quot; Syson exclaimed; this was his past, the
country he had abandoned, and it hurt him to see it so beautiful.
Woodpigeons cooed overhead, and the air was full of the brightness
of birds singing.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're married, what do you keep writing to her for, and
sending her poetry books and things?&quot; asked the keeper.  Syson
stared at him, taken aback and humiliated.  Then he began to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I did not know about you . . .&quot;</p>

<p>Again the keeper flushed darkly.</p>

<p>&quot;But if you are married - &quot; he charged.</p>

<p>&quot;I am,&quot; answered the other cynically.</p>

<p>Then, looking down the blue, beautiful path, Syson felt his own
humiliation.  &quot;What right HAVE I to hang on to her?&quot; he thought,
bitterly self-contemptuous.</p>

<p>&quot;She knows I'm married and all that,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;But you keep sending her books,&quot; challenged the keeper.</p>

<p>Syson, silenced, looked at the other man quizzically, half pitying.
Then he turned.</p>

<p>&quot;Good day,&quot; he said, and was gone.  Now, everything irritated him:
the two sallows, one all gold and perfume and murmur, one silver-
green and bristly, reminded him, that here he had taught her about
pollination.  What a fool he was!  What god-forsaken folly it all
was!</p>

<p>&quot;Ah well,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;the poor devil seems to have a
grudge against me.  I'll do my best for him.&quot;  He grinned to
himself, in a very bad temper.</p>
