<p>Jimmy Skunk sat on the floor of Farmer Brown's henhouse, rubbing
his head and glaring up at the upper row of nests with eyes red
with anger. Of course it was dark in the henhouse, for it was
night, but Jimmy can see in the dark, just as so many other little
people who wear fur can. What he saw was the anxious looking face
of Unc' Billy Possum staring down at him.</p>

<p>"You did that purposely!" snapped Jimmy. "You did that purposely,
and you needn't tell me you didn't."</p>

<p>"On mah honor Ah didn't," protested Unc' Billy. "It was an accident,
just a sho' 'nuff accident, and Ah'm right sorry fo' it."</p>

<p>"That sounds very nice, but I don't believe a word of it. You
did it purposely, and you can't make me believe anything else.
Come down here and fight. I dare you to!" Jimmy was getting more
and more angry every minute.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy began to grow angry. Of course, it was wholly his
fault that that egg had fallen, but it wasn't his fault that Jimmy
had happened to be just beneath. He hadn't known that Jimmy was
there. He had apologized, and he felt that no one could do more
than that. Jimmy Skunk had doubted his word, had refused to believe
him, and that made him angry. His little eyes glowed with rage.</p>

<p>"If yo' want to fight, come up here. I'll wait fo' yo' right
where Ah am," he sputtered.</p>

<p>This made Jimmy angrier than ever. He couldn't climb up there,
and he knew that Unc' Billy knew it. Unc' Billy was perfectly
safe in promising to wait for him.</p>

<p>"You're a coward, just a plain no-account coward!" snapped Jimmy.
"I'm not going to climb up there, but I'll tell you what I am
going to do; I'm going to wait right down here until you come
down, if it isn't until next year. Nobody can drop things on my
head and not get paid back. I thought you were a friend, but now
I know better."</p>

<p>"Wait as long as yo' please. Ah reckons Ah can stay as long as
yo' can," retorted Unc' Billy, grinding and snapping his teeth.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," retorted Jimmy. "I'm going to pay you up for
that bump on my head or know the reason why."</p>

<p>And so they kept on quarreling and calling each other names,
for the time being quite forgetting that they were where they
had no business to be, either of them. It really was dreadful.
And it was all because both had been sadly disappointed. They
had found no eggs where they had been sure they would find plenty.
You see, Farmer Brown's boy had gathered every egg when he shut
the biddies up for the night. Did you ever notice what a bad thing
for the temper disappointment often is?</p>
