<p>Despite the remarkable experiences of George and Victor Shelton
in the Blackfoot village, they found, as the weeks and months
passed, a monotony that deepened their homesickness and caused
them to yearn for the day when they could start southward and
leave the bleak region forever behind. The winters in that latitude
are generally severe, and the brothers got a taste of cold weather
such as they had never known on the other side of the Mississippi.
There must have been repeated spells when, had a Fahrenheit thermometer
been in existence, it would have shown a record of thirty and
forty degrees below zero.</p>

<p>People who are accustomed to such Arctic experiences know how
to prepare for them, and Deerfoot and the boys would have been
foolish had they neglected so plain a duty. With wood abundant
on every hand, a bountiful supply was kept within the tepee and
outside, and weeks passed without the fire being allowed to go
out. With the soft, warm furs at command, no one of the three
met with more than a brief discomfort because of the fearful cold.</p>

<p>The chief cause of anxiety was the horses. All were provided
with shelter and carefully looked after. A good deal of grass
had been pulled and much cottonwood and willow bark laid in stock.
If the animals could not fare sumptuously, they had enough to
keep them in good condition. Fully half a dozen of the Blackfoot
horses were frozen to death, and those belonging to our friends
would have perished but for the care they received. They were
screened by blankets during the unusually severe weather, and
Whirlwind received the tenderest attention from Deerfoot. More
than once the Shawanoe stole out of the tepee in the depth of
the night and tramped over the snow through an atmosphere that
was still and as biting as the teeth of a saw. No matter how silently
the youth moved forward, the stallion discovered his approach
and whinneyed his welcome. Then when the blizzards raged Deerfoot
never forgot to call and assure himself that nothing was neglected
that could shield the faithful creatures. Thus they were saved
from harm until the weather moderated upon the approach of spring.</p>

<p>With the snow lying several feet deep on the level and piled
ten times higher among the mountains, Deerfoot and the boys hunted
with their friends on snow-shoes. It was exhilarating, but the
resistless cold took away much of the pleasure that otherwise
would have come to the lads. As for the Shawanoe, summer and winter
seemed alike to him.</p>

<p>When the village was helpless in the grasp of old Boreas, the
inhabitants did little except cower in their lodges around their
fires and eat and sleep. This sort of existence grew almost intolerable
to the brothers. With every muscle and nerve yearning for action,
they became impatient and sometimes fretful. When they spoke of
themselves as prisoners it was the truth.</p>

<p>Taggarak acted kindly toward George and Victor, but never showed
any special friendship for them. It may have been because they
belonged to another race. Toward Deerfoot he displayed a profound
gratitude, a deep affection and reverence, amounting at times
almost to worship. He was the messenger who brought the glad tidings
of the one and only true God, and the chief in some way or other
associated him with the divine message itself, as if he were a
part of it.</p>

<p>The snow and cold shut off communication almost entirely between
the Blackfoot villages. Early in the winter and toward spring
several warriors came down from the most northern settlement,
but they did not remain long. It was known, however, among them
all that Taggarak, the leading chief, had accepted the new religion,
and his authority naturally weakened, but nothing in the nature
of a revolt took place against his supremacy.</p>

<p>Deerfoot frequently visited the chief, where none was so welcome
as he. Taggarak never went to the tepee of the Shawanoe, for he
preferred always to see Deerfoot alone. Mul-tal-la, Spink, Jiggers
and seven other warriors openly confessed the Christian religion.
Nearly double that number of squaws&mdash;among them the wife of the
chief&mdash;did the same. Slowly and surely the leaven worked, and
when the time drew near for the departure of the visitors it is
probable that the number of converts was doubled, with the promise
of further increase.</p>

<p>Deerfoot and the boys made the parting as "informal" as possible.
All through the winter the Shawanoe had impressed upon the Blackfeet
that this separation in the nature of things would be brief. The
time was certain to come, at no distant day, when they would all
be together again. So he smiled, the boys bade good-bye to the
numerous lads with whom they had played and hunted, and were so
happy over the prospect of soon seeing their own home again that
they could not repress their delight nor pay much attention to
the regret, if not sadness, of the aboriginal youngsters.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's last hour in the village was spent alone with Taggarak
in his lodge. What took place there and what was said by each
were never known to anyone beside themselves.</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon our friends had penetrated a number
of miles to the eastward. A good deal of snow remained, and they
had to pick their way with care. They would have been wise had
they remained another month, as they were urged to do; but Deerfoot
himself was as homesick as his companions and as willing as they
to face the hardships that had to be faced for several weeks to
come.</p>

<p>Jack, Prince, Zigzag and even Whirlwind showed the effects of
their long confinement, but all appeared to share the enthusiasm
of their owners and worked royally to get forward. When they had
traveled the distance named, the rest given them by their masters
was not unwelcome.</p>

<p>Naturally, upon halting, all turned their eyes westward. A moderate
mountain spur hid the village from sight, but each knew where
it lay. George and Victor scanned the field of vision with the
aid of the glass, but noted nothing unusual. When Deerfoot took
the instrument he stood for a long time directed toward a certain
spot. He expected to see some object, and was not disappointed.
On the top of the same bare brown rock where he had caught sight
of Mul-tal-la when Deerfoot was coming to the village for the
first time, he descried another form. It was not that of Mul-tal-la;
it was Taggarak, who had climbed alone to the place, and, silent
and motionless as a statue, was gazing after the little party
of horsemen as they slowly faded from view in the distance.</p>

<p>George and Victor kept their eyes on their friend, and when they
noted the length of time he held the glass leveled they suspected
the cause.</p>

<p>"He sees some one," said George, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"It must be Taggarak. Look!"</p>

<p>Deerfoot had lowered the instrument and was peering westward
with his unaided vision. He was testing whether he could thus
discern that which the glass revealed plainly. Evidently he did
so, though the boys could not locate the form, even when they
knew almost precisely where to look for it.</p>

<p>Standing upright, the Shawanoe took his blanket from the back
of Whirlwind and swung it back and forth over his head, for fully
a dozen times. Then, dropping it to his feet, he brought the glass
again to his eye.</p>

<p>"Taggarak has seen it," whispered Victor, who, like his brother,
was watching the face of Deerfoot and noted the smile come to
his countenance.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. As the Shawanoe looked again he observed the
chieftain rise from his sitting position and reply to the signal
by waving his own blanket. The trained vision of the veteran warrior
saw as clearly as those of youth. The action of Taggarak brought
him into view of the lads, both noting the flickering of what
resembled a mere speck in the distance. Finally, Deerfoot lowered
the glass and turned about, as if to say that was the final parting
from the chief who held him in such loving remembrance.</p>

<p>The mountain peaks on every hand were covered with snow. On the
lower ranges this would gradually dissolve under the rays of the
sun, but others were so lofty that the white blanket remained
throughout the year. While gazing at a towering range to the northeast
the three witnessed the descent of an avalanche. Deerfoot was
the first to see it, and directed the notice of the boys to the
vast disturbance.</p>

<p>The glance revealed nothing unusual, the enormous extent of slope
looking as if it were motionless, but a second look told the truth.
A grove of pines at the base of the range were suddenly snuffed
out. This was because they disappeared under the prodigious mass
of snow and ice that swept over them. Then a dark, irregular line,
running right and left, and roughly parallel with the crest of
the range, came into view. It was an eighth of a mile in length
and the narrow width rapidly increased until there was a rent
or yawn of several hundred feet, zigzagging from one side to the
other. The dark color of this chasm was due to rocks and ground,
and marked the break between the two sections or divisions of
the avalanche. The upper portion caught and held, while the remainder
swept downward without check. Thus a huge gap was opened, through
which the brown earth and stones showed.</p>

<p>The next strange sight was that of boulders, some of them weighing
many tons, flung high in air and tossed about like so many corks.
One might have thought that Titans were disporting themselves
as did the fabled gods on Mount Olympus. As the inconceivable
mountain of snow crashed onward it spread out at the base of the
range, and finally settled to rest. Had an ordinary town been
in its path it would have been buried to the tops of the highest
steeples.</p>

<p>Nearly all this had taken place before the three spectators heard
the deep, thunderous roar that rolled across the space and told
of the stupendous mass that had been loosened by the undermining
rays of the sun or by some trifling disturbance of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>"If we should be caught in anything like that," said Victor,
"it would take us a good while to dig out."</p>

<p>"My brothers might <em>never</em> dig out," said Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"What is there to hinder?"</p>

<p>"There are many stones and rocks and boulders tumbling about
in the snow, and they would be likely to kill us."</p>

<p>"Then, Deerfoot, you must keep your eyes open for avalanches.
It would be pretty hard for the horses, though Zigzag has sort
of got used to it."</p>

<p>Little need for warning the Shawanoe of his duty. That was what
he had been attending to all his life. He had never placed himself
and friends in the way of an impending avalanche. Recalling their
course since leaving the village, the brothers understood better
than before the cause of more than one tortuous winding by their
guide, when they had been unable to guess the reason for such
quixotic turns that did not lessen the labor of traveling itself.</p>

<p>It was not yet midday, and the halt was not made for food for
either man or beast. In truth, grass was so scarce, except here
and there in the sheltered nooks and depressions, that some dependence
would have to be placed for awhile on the barks of trees. Zigzag
showed a meekness that roused distrust on the part of the boys.
He must have found the heavy pack quite onerous, but he did not
rebel. Whirlwind showed little lessening of his aristocratic tastes,
and refused to mingle on anything like equal terms with the common
stock around him.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot and his companions were journeying westward they
decided to return by a different route from the Blackfoot country.
Their first intention was to travel eastward until they reached
the upper waters of the Mississippi, and then make their way down
that stream to civilization, following in a general way the course
of the mighty stream. With their horses, and without large boats,
they could not utilize the current, unless perhaps after descending
a long distance they were able to construct a large raft.</p>

<p>This plan, which would have taken them through the hunting grounds
of the Assiniboines, was changed, and they turned to the southeast,
having been told that that course offered less difficulties to
them. They gave up their former plan because of their wish to
enter a moderate climate as soon as possible. Although spring
was well begun, they had a good deal of snow and ice to encounter,
and were likely to meet it for weeks to come. This was shown on
their second day, when a driving storm of snow and sleet forced
them to seek shelter for themselves and horses, and another day
passed before they could resume their journey.</p>

<p>The most trying difficulty was that of crossing streams, which
were more numerous than they had supposed. Some were mountain
torrents of only a few yards width, others deserved the name of
rivers, and the current of each was of icy coldness. More than
once they saw blocks of ice grinding and tumbling over one another
as they plunged rapidly onward. It was so dangerous at times for
the horses to attempt to swim across, and so hard and disagreeable
for the youths, that hours were spent in hunting for a fording
place. Fortunately they were always able to gather enough fuel
to make themselves comfortable at night; grass became more plentiful
and no trouble was had in procuring game. This generally consisted
of bison, but it was a great improvement when they were able to
bring down a Rocky Mountain sheep. This animal does not bear wool,
but hair like that of the deer, and is larger than the largest
domestic sheep. The horns of the males attain great size, starting
from just above the eyes, though not touching at the bases, and
curving over so as to include all the space between the ears.
The meat at certain seasons is very palatable and held in high
favor. The animal is generally known by the name of the "big horn,"
and is so skilful a climber and so alert that it is quite a feat
for a hunter to bring down a specimen. Deerfoot was the only one
on this return journey who was able to bag the game, which never
failed to elude George and Victor Shelton.</p>
