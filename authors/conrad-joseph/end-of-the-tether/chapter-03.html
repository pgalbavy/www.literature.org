<p> Just at that time the Japanese were casting far and wide for
ships of European build, and he had no difficulty in finding a
purchaser, a speculator who drove a hard bargain, but paid cash
down for the Fair Maid, with a view to a profitable resale. Thus
it came about that Captain Whalley found himself on a certain
afternoon descending the steps of one of the most important post-offices
of the East with a slip of bluish paper in his hand. This was
the receipt of a registered letter enclosing a draft for two hundred
pounds, and addressed to Melbourne. Captain Whalley pushed the
paper into his waistcoat-pocket, took his stick from under his
arm, and walked down the street.</p>

<p>It was a recently opened and untidy thoroughfare with rudimentary
side-walks and a soft layer of dust cushioning the whole width
of the road. One end touched the slummy street of Chinese shops
near the harbor, the other drove straight on, without houses,
for a couple of miles, through patches of jungle-like vegetation,
to the yard gates of the new Consolidated Docks Company. The crude
frontages of the new Government buildings alternated with the
blank fencing of vacant plots, and the view of the sky seemed
to give an added spaciousness to the broad vista. It was empty
and shunned by natives after business hours, as though they had
expected to see one of the tigers from the neighborhood of the
New Waterworks on the hill coming at a loping canter down the
middle to get a Chinese shopkeeper for supper. Captain Whalley
was not dwarfed by the solitude of the grandly planned street.
He had too fine a presence for that. He was only a lonely figure
walking purposefully, with a great white beard like a pilgrim,
and with a thick stick that resembled a weapon. On one side the
new Courts of Justice had a low and unadorned portico of squat
columns half concealed by a few old trees left in the approach.
On the other the pavilion wings of the new Colonial Treasury came
out to the line of the street. But Captain Whalley, who had now
no ship and no home, remembered in passing that on that very site
when he first came out from England there had stood a fishing
village, a few mat huts erected on piles between a muddy tidal
creek and a miry pathway that went writhing into a tangled wilderness
without any docks or waterworks.</p>

<p>No ship&mdash;no home. And his poor Ivy away there had no home either.
A boarding-house is no sort of home though it may get you a living.
His feelings were horribly rasped by the idea of the boarding-house.
In his rank of life he had that truly aristocratic temperament
characterized by a scorn of vulgar gentility and by prejudiced
views as to the derogatory nature of certain occupations. For
his own part he had always preferred sailing merchant ships (which
is a straightforward occupation) to buying and selling merchandise,
of which the essence is to get the better of somebody in a bargain&mdash;an
undignified trial of wits at best. His father had been Colonel
Whalley (retired) of the H. E. I. Company’s service, with very
slender means besides his pension, but with distinguished connections.
He could remember as a boy how frequently waiters at the inns,
country tradesmen and small people of that sort, used to "My lord" 
the old warrior on the strength of his appearance.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley himself (he would have entered the Navy if his
father had not died before he was fourteen) had something of a
grand air which would have suited an old and glorious admiral;
but he became lost like a straw in the eddy of a brook amongst
the swarm of brown and yellow humanity filling a thoroughfare,
that by contrast with the vast and empty avenue he had left seemed
as narrow as a lane and absolutely riotous with life. The walls
of the houses were blue; the shops of the Chinamen yawned like
cavernous lairs; heaps of nondescript merchandise overflowed the
gloom of the long range of arcades, and the fiery serenity of
sunset took the middle of the street from end to end with a glow
like the reflection of a fire. It fell on the bright colors and
the dark faces of the bare-footed crowd, on the pallid yellow
backs of the half-naked jostling coolies, on the accouterments
of a tall Sikh trooper with a parted beard and fierce mustaches
on sentry before the gate of the police compound. Looming very
big above the heads in a red haze of dust, the tightly packed
car of the cable tramway navigated cautiously up the human stream,
with the incessant blare of its horn, in the manner of a steamer
groping in a fog.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley emerged like a diver on the other side, and in
the desert shade between the walls of closed warehouses removed
his hat to cool his brow. A certain disrepute attached to the
calling of a landlady of a boarding-house. These women were said
to be rapacious, unscrupulous, untruthful; and though he contemned
no class of his fellow-creatures &mdash;God forbid!&mdash;these were
suspicions to which it was unseemly that a Whalley should lay
herself open. He had not expostulated with her, however. He was
confident she shared his feelings; he was sorry for her; he trusted
her judgment; he considered it a merciful dispensation that he
could help her once more,&mdash;but in his aristocratic heart of hearts
he would have found it more easy to reconcile himself to the idea
of her turning seamstress. Vaguely he remembered reading years
ago a touching piece called the "Song of the Shirt." It was all
very well making songs about poor women. The granddaughter of
Colonel Whalley, the landlady of a boarding-house! Pooh! He replaced
his hat, dived into two pockets, and stopping a moment to apply
a flaring match to the end of a cheap cheroot, blew an embittered
cloud of smoke at a world that could hold such surprises.</p>

<p>Of one thing he was certain&mdash;that she was the own child of a
clever mother. Now he had got over the wrench of parting with
his ship, he perceived clearly that such a step had been unavoidable.
Perhaps he had been growing aware of it all along with an unconfessed
knowledge. But she, far away there, must have had an intuitive
perception of it, with the pluck to face that truth and the courage
to speak out&mdash;all the qualities which had made her mother a woman
of such excellent counsel.</p>

<p>It would have had to come to that in the end! It was fortunate
she had forced his hand. In another year or two it would have
been an utterly barren sale. To keep the ship going he had been
involving himself deeper every year. He was defenseless before
the insidious work of adversity, to whose more open assaults he
could present a firm front; like a cliff that stands unmoved the
open battering of the sea, with a lofty ignorance of the treacherous
backwash undermining its base. As it was, every liability satisfied,
her request answered, and owing no man a penny, there remained
to him from the proceeds a sum of five hundred pounds put away
safely. In addition he had upon his person some forty odd dollars&mdash;enough
to pay his hotel bill, providing he did not linger too long in
the modest bedroom where he had taken refuge.</p>

<p>Scantily furnished, and with a waxed floor, it opened into one
of the side-verandas. The straggling building of bricks, as airy
as a bird-cage, resounded with the incessant flapping of rattan
screens worried by the wind between the white-washed square pillars
of the sea-front. The rooms were lofty, a ripple of sunshine flowed
over the ceilings; and the periodical invasions of tourists from
some passenger steamer in the harbor flitted through the wind-swept
dusk of the apartments with the tumult of their unfamiliar voices
and impermanent presences, like relays of migratory shades condemned
to speed headlong round the earth without leaving a trace. The
babble of their irruptions ebbed out as suddenly as it had arisen;
the draughty corridors and the long chairs of the verandas knew
their sight-seeing hurry or their prostrate repose no more; and
Captain Whalley, substantial and dignified, left well-nigh alone
in the vast hotel by each light-hearted skurry, felt more and
more like a stranded tourist with no aim in view, like a forlorn
traveler without a home. In the solitude of his room he smoked
thoughtfully, gazing at the two sea-chests which held all that
he could call his own in this world. A thick roll of charts in
a sheath of sailcloth leaned in a corner; the flat packing-case
containing the portrait in oils and the three carbon photographs
had been pushed under the bed. He was tired of discussing terms,
of assisting at surveys, of all the routine of the business. What
to the other parties was merely the sale of a ship was to him
a momentous event involving a radically new view of existence.
He knew that after this ship there would be no other; and the
hopes of his youth, the exercise of his abilities, every feeling
and achievement of his manhood, had been indissolubly connected
with ships. He had served ships; he had owned ships; and even
the years of his actual retirement from the sea had been made
bearable by the idea that he had only to stretch out his hand
full of money to get a ship. He had been at liberty to feel as
though he were the owner of all the ships in the world. The selling
of this one was weary work; but when she passed from him at last,
when he signed the last receipt, it was as though all the ships
had gone out of the world together, leaving him on the shore of
inaccessible oceans with seven hundred pounds in his hands.</p>

<p>Striding firmly, without haste, along the quay, Captain Whalley
averted his glances from the familiar roadstead. Two generations
of seamen born since his first day at sea stood between him and
all these ships at the anchorage. His own was sold, and he had
been asking himself, What next?</p>

<p>From the feeling of loneliness, of inward emptiness,&mdash;and of
loss too, as if his very soul had been taken out of him forcibly,&mdash;there
had sprung at first a desire to start right off and join his daughter.
"Here are the last pence," he would say to her; "take them, my
dear. And here’s your old father: you must take him too."</p>

<p>His soul recoiled, as if afraid of what lay hidden at the bottom
of this impulse. Give up! Never! When one is thoroughly weary
all sorts of nonsense come into one’s head. A pretty gift it would
have been for a poor woman&mdash;this seven hundred pounds with the
incumbrance of a hale old fellow more than likely to last for
years and years to come. Was he not as fit to die in harness as
any of the youngsters in charge of these anchored ships out yonder?
He was as solid now as ever he had been. But as to who would give
him work to do, that was another matter. Were he, with his appearance
and antecedents, to go about looking for a junior’s berth, people,
he was afraid, would not take him seriously; or else if he succeeded
in impressing them, he would maybe obtain their pity, which would
be like stripping yourself naked to be kicked. He was not anxious
to give himself away for less than nothing. He had no use for
anybody’s pity. On the other hand, a command&mdash;the only thing he
could try for with due regard for common decency&mdash;was not likely
to be lying in wait for him at the corner of the next street.
Commands don’t go a-begging nowadays. Ever since he had come ashore
to carry out the business of the sale he had kept his ears open,
but had heard no hint of one being vacant in the port. And even
if there had been one, his successful past itself stood in his
way. He had been his own employer too long. The only credential
he could produce was the testimony of his whole life. What better
recommendation could anyone require? But vaguely he felt that
the unique document would be looked upon as an archaic curiosity
of the Eastern waters, a screed traced in obsolete words&mdash;in a
half-forgotten language.</p>
