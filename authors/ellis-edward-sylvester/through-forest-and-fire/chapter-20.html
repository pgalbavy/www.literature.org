<p>Sam Harper saw, from the position of the sun in the heavens,
that he had stayed longer than he intended to in the cabin, and
the short afternoon was drawing to a close.</p>

<p>He therefore moved at a brisk walk for a quarter of a mile, Bowser
trotting at his heels as though he thought such a laborious gait
uncalled for; but, as the lad then observed that the large limestone
was not far away, he slackened his pace, and sat down on a fallen
tree to rest.</p>

<p>"This is a queer sort of a hunt," he said to himself, "and I
don't see what chance there is of any one of us three doing anything
at all. Bowser isn't worth a copper to hunt with; all there was
in him expended itself when he chased the buck and let it get
away from him&mdash;hallo, Bowser, what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>The hound just then began acting as though he felt the slighting
remarks of his master, and meant to make him sorry therefor.</p>

<p>He uttered several sharp yelps and began circling around the
fallen tree on which Sam was sitting. He went with what might
be called a nervous gallop, frequently turning about and circumnavigating
the lad and the log in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>All the time he kept up his barking and demonstrations, now and
then running up to Sam, galloping several paces away, and then
looking toward him and barking again with great vigor.</p>

<p>Sam watched his antics with amusement and interest.</p>

<p>"He acts as though he wanted me to follow him from this spot,
though I cannot understand why he wants me to do that, since he
is so lazy he would be glad to lie down and stay here till morning."</p>

<p>Studying the maneuvers of the hound, Sam became satisfied that
the brute was seeking to draw him away from the fallen tree on
which he was sitting.</p>

<p>The dog became more excited every minute. He trotted back and
forth, running up to his young master and then darting off again,
looking appealingly toward Sam, who finally saw that his actions
meant something serious.</p>

<p>"I don't know why he wishes me to leave, but he has some reason
for it, and I will try to find out."</p>

<p>Sam slowly rose from the fallen oak tree on which he was sitting,
and as he did so his cap fairly lifted from his head with terror.</p>

<p>He caught the glint and scintillation in the sunlight of something
on the ground on the other side of the trunk, and separated from
him only by the breadth thereof, at the same instant that his
ear detected the whirring rattle which told the fact that an immense
rattlesnake had coiled itself therefor, and had just given its
warning signal that it meant to strike.</p>

<p>Sam Harper never made such a quick leap in all his life as he
did, when he bounded several feet from the log, with a yell as
if the ground beneath him had become suddenly red-hot.</p>

<p>There is nothing on the broad earth which is held in such universal
abhorrence as a snake, the sight of which sends a shiver of disgust
and dread over nearly every one that looks upon it.</p>

<p>When Sam sat down on the fallen tree, he was probably almost
near enough for the coiled <em>crotalus</em> to bury its fangs
in him. It reared its head, and, without uttering its customary
warning, most likely measured the intervening space with the purpose
of striking.</p>

<p>The instinct of Bowser at this juncture told him of the peril
of his master, and he began his demonstrations, intended to draw
him away from the spot. At the same time, his barking, and trotting
back and forth, diverted the attention of the rattlesnake to the
hound, and thereby prevented him striking the unsuspicious boy.</p>

<p>It must have been, also, that during these few minutes the serpent
vibrated his tail more than once, for the nature of the reptile
leads him to do so; but the sound could not have been very loud,
as it failed to attract the attention of Sam until he rose from
the log and turned partly about.</p>

<p>The boy moved around the head of the fallen tree, so as to place
himself on the same side with the rattlesnake, and then he spent
a minute or two in contemplating him at that safe distance.</p>

<p>He was a large one, with sixteen rattles and a button. He lay
coiled in several perfect rings, with his tail softly vibrating
and his head thrown back, as if he expected his enemy to come
nigh enough for him to bury his curved needle-like fangs in some
portion of his body, injecting his poison, so deadly that nothing
could have saved the boy from dying within a few minutes.</p>

<p>The first natural feeling which comes over one when he sees a
crawling snake is to kill it, and Sam Harper did not wait long
before yielding to his inclination.</p>

<p>Standing less than a rod distant, he brought his gun to his shoulder,
and sighted at the head of the venomous reptile, which was held
almost stationary, while the crimson tongue darted in and out
as if it were a tiny spray of blood.</p>

<p>The aim was true, and the head was shattered as though the cartridge
had exploded within it. The body made a few furious writhings
and struggles, and then became still.</p>

<p>Sam viewed the ruin he had wrought for a minute or so, and then,
appreciating the service his dog had wrought him, he turned and
patted the animal.</p>

<p>"You're a fine dog, Bowser, and I forgive you for being good
for nothing."</p>
