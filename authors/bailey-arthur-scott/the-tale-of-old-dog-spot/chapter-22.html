<p>The Green family ate their luncheon in the carryall on Main Street,
after the circus parade had passed. They didn't forget to give old dog
Spot something to eat out of the big basket that they had brought with
them from home. Although they hadn't expected him to go to the village
with them, there was more than enough food for everybody. Even Johnnie
Green's appetite wasn't equal to all the goodies that his mother had
provided.
</p>
<p>People were already starting for the circus grounds on the outskirts of
the village. Johnnie Green noticed them uneasily.
</p><p>"We don't want to be late for the show," he reminded his father.
</p><p>"We'll get there in time," Farmer Green assured him.
</p><p>And they did. Soon they followed the crowd through the village streets
until they came in sight of the "big top," the great tent with flags
flying above it, and smaller tents all around.
</p><p>Farmer Green turned the bays into a yard near-by, where he unharnessed
and fed them. Then he tied one end of a rope to Spot's collar and
fastened the other end to a carriage wheel.
</p><p>"There!" he said. "Now we're ready."
</p><p>Old dog Spot didn't want to be left behind. He tugged at the rope and
whined.
</p><p>"Be quiet!" Johnnie Green's father said to him. "You followed us to the
village. And now you'll have to behave yourself. They wouldn't let you
into the show."
</p><p>Then the Green family turned their backs on him.
</p><p>"They needn't think they can keep me here," Spot growled. "I didn't run
all the way from the farm to the village to be tied to a wagon wheel."
</p><p>Johnnie Green and his father and mother hadn't been gone a quarter of an
hour when Spot succeeded in slipping his collar over his head. Then he
dashed out of the yard and ran to the circus grounds as fast as he could
go.
</p><p>Spot mingled with the crowds of people that were pouring into the big
tent. He worked his way in and out among the throng, all but tripping
many of the pleasure seekers.
</p><p>Though he looked everywhere, he couldn't find the Green family. They had
already passed through the entrance and were enjoying the sights inside
the canvas.
</p><p>At last Spot met a man--a circus man--who was very friendly. It was
pleasant to get a kind word from somebody, after so many people had told
him to "get out," and had given him a shove.
</p><p>This kindly person called Spot into a low tent and patted him. He gave
Spot a bit of meat and even thought to offer him a drink of water.
</p><p>"This is a fine pointer," the man remarked to a friend of his who was
with him. "He hasn't any collar; so he must be anybody's dog. And he
might as well be mine."
</p><p>Spot wagged his tail. He didn't quite understand what his new
acquaintance was saying. But it seemed to be something nice.
</p><p>And then Spot decided, suddenly, that he had stayed in that tent long
enough. For the pleasant man found a piece of rope and tried to tie it
about Spot's neck.
</p><p>"I've been tied up once to-day; and once is enough," Spot growled.
Slipping out of the man's grasp, Spot ran out of doors.
</p><p>Both men followed him. For a few minutes they chased him. One of them
tripped over a guy rope and sprawled on the ground. And to escape the
other Spot dodged under a canvas wall where it lifted slightly at the
bottom.
</p><p>He found himself in a huge tent where hundreds of people sat all around
on tiers of seats. Men and horses were capering about in the center of
the place. And somewhere a band was playing.
</p><p>He was under the big top.
