<p>It was a week after Nyleptha’s visit, when I had begun to get about
a little in the middle of the day, that a message came to me from Sir
Henry to say that Sorais would be brought before them in the Queen’s
first antechamber at midday, and requesting my attendance if possible.
Accordingly, greatly drawn by curiosity to see this unhappy woman once
more, I made shift, with the help of that kind little fellow Alphonse,
who is a perfect treasure to me, and that of another waiting-man, to
reach the antechamber. I got there, indeed, before anybody else, except
a few of the great Court officials who had been bidden to be present,
but I had scarcely seated myself before Sorais was brought in by a party
of guards, looking as beautiful and defiant as ever, but with a worn
expression on her proud face. She was, as usual, dressed in her royal
‘kaf’, emblazoned with the emblem of the Sun, and in her right hand she
still held the toy spear of silver. A pang of admiration and pity went
through me as I looked at her, and struggling to my feet I bowed deeply,
at the same time expressing my sorrow that I was not able, owing to my
condition, to remain standing before her.
</p>
<p>She coloured a little and then laughed bitterly. ‘Thou dost forget,
Macumazahn,’ she said, ‘I am no more a Queen, save in blood; I am an
outcast and a prisoner, one whom all men should scorn, and none show
deference to.’
</p><p>‘At least,’ I replied, ‘thou art still a lady, and therefore one to whom
deference is due. Also, thou art in an evil case, and therefore it is
doubly due.’
</p><p>‘Ah!’ she answered, with a little laugh, ‘thou dost forget that I
would have wrapped thee in a sheet of gold and hung thee to the angel’s
trumpet at the topmost pinnacle of the Temple.’
</p><p>‘No,’ I answered, ‘I assure thee that I forgot it not; indeed, I often
thought of it when it seemed to me that the battle of the Pass was
turning against us; but the trumpet is there, and I am still here,
though perchance not for long, so why talk of it now?’
</p><p>‘Ah!’ she went on, ‘the battle! the battle! Oh, would that I were once
more a Queen, if only for one little hour, and I would take such a
vengeance on those accursed jackals who deserted me in my need; that it
should only be spoken of in whispers; those woman, those pigeon-hearted
half-breeds who suffered themselves to be overcome!’ and she choked in
her wrath.
</p><p>‘Ay, and that little coward beside thee,’ she went on, pointing at
Alphonse with the silver spear, whereat he looked very uncomfortable;
‘he escaped and betrayed my plans. I tried to make a general of him,
telling the soldiers it was Bougwan, and to scourge valour into him’
(here Alphonse shivered at some unhappy recollection), ‘but it was of no
avail. He hid beneath a banner in my tent and thus overheard my plans. I
would that I had slain him, but, alas! I held my hand.
</p><p>‘And thou, Macumazahn, I have heard of what thou didst; thou art brave,
and hast a loyal heart. And the black one too, ah, he was a <u>man</u>. I
would fain have seen him hurl Nasta from the stairway.’
</p><p>‘Thou art a strange woman, Sorais,’ I said; ‘I pray thee now plead with
the Queen Nyleptha, that perchance she may show mercy unto thee.’
</p><p>She laughed out loud. ‘I plead for mercy!’ she said and at that moment
the Queen entered, accompanied by Sir Henry and Good, and took her seat
with an impassive face. As for poor Good, he looked intensely ill at
ease.
</p><p>‘Greeting, Sorais!’ said Nyleptha, after a short pause. ‘Thou hast rent
the kingdom like a rag, thou hast put thousands of my people to the
sword, thou hast twice basely plotted to destroy my life by murder, thou
hast sworn to slay my lord and his companions and to hurl me from the
Stairway. What hast thou to say why thou shouldst not die? Speak, O
Sorais!’
</p><p>‘Methinks my sister the Queen hath forgotten the chief count of the
indictment,’ answered Sorais in her slow musical tones. ‘It runs thus:
“Thou didst strive to win the love of my lord Incubu.” It is for this
crime that my sister will slay me, not because I levied war. It is
perchance happy for thee, Nyleptha, that I fixed my mind upon his love
too late.
</p><p>‘Listen,’ she went on, raising her voice. ‘I have nought to say save
that I would I had won instead of lost. Do thou with me even as
thou wilt, O Queen, and let my lord the King there’ (pointing to Sir
Henry)--‘for now will he be King--carry out the sentence, as it is meet
he should, for as he is the beginning of the evil, let him also be the
end.’ And she drew herself up and shot one angry glance at him from her
deep fringed eyes, and then began to toy with her spear.
</p><p>Sir Henry bent towards Nyleptha and whispered something that I could not
catch, and then the Queen spoke.
</p><p>‘Sorais, ever have I been a good sister to thee. When our father died,
and there was much talk in the land as to whether thou shouldst sit
upon the throne with me, I being the elder, I gave my voice for thee and
said, “Nay, let her sit. She is twin with me; we were born at a birth;
wherefore should the one be preferred before the other?” And so has it
ever been ‘twixt thee and me, my sister. But now thou knowest in what
sort thou hast repaid me, but I have prevailed, and thy life is forfeit,
Sorais. And yet art thou my sister, born at a birth with me, and we
played together when we were little and loved each other much, and at
night we slept in the same cot with our arms each around the other’s
neck, and therefore even now does my heart go out to thee, Sorais.
</p><p>‘But not for that would I spare thy life, for thy offence has been too
heavy; it doth drag down the wide wings of my mercy even to the ground.
Also, while thou dost live the land will never be at peace.
</p><p>‘Yet shalt thou not die, Sorais, because my dear lord here hath begged
thy life of me as a boon; therefore as a boon and as a marriage gift
give I it to him, to do with even as he wills, knowing that, though
thou dost love him, he loves thee not, Sorais, for all thy beauty. Nay,
though thou art lovely as the night in all her stars, O Lady of the
Night, yet it is me his wife whom he loves, and not thee, and therefore
do I give thy life to him.’
</p><p>Sorais flushed up to her eyes and said nothing, and I do not think that
I ever saw a man look more miserable than did Sir Henry at that moment.
Somehow, Nyleptha’s way of putting the thing, though true and forcible
enough, was not altogether pleasant.
</p><p>‘I understand,’ stammered Curtis, looking at Good, ‘I understood that he
were attached--eh--attached to--to the Queen Sorais. I am--eh--not aware
what the--in short, the state of your feelings may be just now; but if
they happened to be that way inclined, it has struck me that--in short,
it might put a satisfactory end to an unpleasant business. The lady also
has ample private estates, where I am sure she would be at liberty to
live unmolested as far as we are concerned, eh, Nyleptha? Of course, I
only suggest.’
</p><p>‘So far as I am concerned,’ said Good, colouring up, ‘I am quite willing
to forget the past; and if the Lady of the Night thinks me worth the
taking I will marry her tomorrow, or when she likes, and try to make her
a good husband.’
</p><p>All eyes were now turned to Sorais, who stood with that same slow smile
upon her beautiful face which I had noticed the first time that I ever
saw her. She paused a little while, and cleared her throat, and then
thrice she curtseyed low, once to Nyleptha, once to Curtis, and once to
Good, and began to speak in measured tones.
</p><p>‘I thank thee, most gracious Queen and royal sister, for the
loving-kindness thou hast shown me from my youth up, and especially in
that thou hast been pleased to give my person and my fate as a gift
to the Lord Incubu--the King that is to be. May prosperity, peace and
plenty deck the life-path of one so merciful and so tender, even as
flowers do. Long mayst thou reign, O great and glorious Queen, and hold
thy husband’s love in both thy hands, and many be the sons and daughters
of thy beauty. And I thank thee, my Lord Incubu--the King that is to
be--I thank thee a thousand times in that thou hast been pleased to
accept that gracious gift, and to pass it on to thy comrade in arms
and in adventure, the Lord Bougwan. Surely the act is worthy of thy
greatness, my Lord Incubu. And now, lastly, I thank thee also, my Lord
Bougwan, who in thy turn hast deigned to accept me and my poor beauty.
I thank thee a thousand times, and I will add that thou art a good and
honest man, and I put my hand upon my heart and swear that I would that
I could say thee “yea”. And now that I have rendered thanks to all in
turn’--and again she smiled--‘I will add one short word.
</p><p>‘Little can you understand of me, Queen Nyleptha and my lords, if ye
know not that for me there is no middle path; that I scorn your pity and
hate you for it; that I cast off your forgiveness as though it were a
serpent’s sting; and that standing here, betrayed, deserted, insulted,
and alone, I yet triumph over you, mock you, and defy you, one and all,
and <u>thus</u> I answer you.’ And then, of a sudden, before anybody guessed
what she intended to do, she drove the little silver spear she carried
in her hand into her side with such a strong and steady aim that the
keen point projected through her back, and she fell prone upon the
pavement.
</p><p>Nyleptha shrieked, and poor Good almost fainted at the sight, while the
rest of us rushed towards her. But Sorais of the Night lifted herself
upon her hand, and for a moment fixed her glorious eyes intently on
Curtis’ face, as though there were some message in the glance, then
dropped her head and sighed, and with a sob her dark but splendid spirit
passed.
</p><p>Well, they gave her a royal funeral, and there was an end of her.
</p>
<p>It was a month after the last act of the Sorais tragedy that a great
ceremony was held in the Flower Temple, and Curtis was formally declared
King-Consort of Zu-Vendis. I was too ill to go myself; and indeed, I
hate all that sort of thing, with the crowds and the trumpet-blowing and
banner-waving; but Good, who was there (in his full-dress uniform), came
back much impressed, and told me that Nyleptha had looked lovely, and
Curtis had borne himself in a right royal fashion, and had been received
with acclamations that left no doubt as to his popularity. Also he told
me that when the horse Daylight was led along in the procession, the
populace had shouted ‘_Macumazahn, Macumazahn!_’ till they were hoarse,
and would only be appeased when he, Good, rose in his chariot and told
them that I was too ill to be present.
</p><p>Afterwards, too, Sir Henry, or rather the King, came to see me, looking
very tired, and vowing that he had never been so bored in his life;
but I dare say that that was a slight exaggeration. It is not in human
nature that a man should be altogether bored on such an extraordinary
occasion; and, indeed, as I pointed out to him, it was a marvellous
thing that a man, who but little more than one short year before had
entered a great country as an unknown wanderer, should today be
married to its beautiful and beloved Queen, and lifted, amidst public
rejoicings, to its throne. I even went the length to exhort him in the
future not to be carried away by the pride and pomp of absolute
power, but always to strive to remember that he was first a Christian
gentleman, and next a public servant, called by Providence to a great
and almost unprecedented trust. These remarks, which he might fairly
have resented, he was so good as to receive with patience, and even to
thank me for making them.
</p><p>It was immediately after this ceremony that I caused myself to be moved
to the house where I am now writing. It is a very pleasant country seat,
situated about two miles from the Frowning City, on to which it looks.
That was five months ago, during the whole of which time I have, being
confined to a kind of couch, employed my leisure in compiling this
history of our wanderings from my journal and from our joint memories.
It is probable that it will never be read, but it does not much matter
whether it is or not; at any rate, it has served to while away many
hours of suffering, for I have suffered a deal of pain lately. Thank
God, however, there will not be much more of it.
</p>
<p>It is a week since I wrote the above, and now I take up my pen for the
last time, for I know that the end is at hand. My brain is still clear
and I can manage to write, though with difficulty. The pain in my lung,
which has been very bad during the last week, has suddenly quite left
me, and been succeeded by a feeling of numbness of which I cannot
mistake the meaning. And just as the pain has gone, so with it all fear
of that end has departed, and I feel only as though I were going to sink
into the arms of an unutterable rest. Happily, contentedly, and with the
same sense of security with which an infant lays itself to sleep in its
mother’s arms, do I lay myself down in the arms of the Angel Death. All
the tremors, all the heart-shaking fears which have haunted me through
a life that seems long as I looked back upon it, have left me now; the
storms have passed, and the Star of our Eternal Hope shines clear and
steady on the horizon that seems so far from man, and yet is so very
near to me tonight.
</p><p>And so this is the end of it--a brief space of troubling, a few
restless, fevered, anguished years, and then the arms of that great
Angel Death. Many times have I been near to them, and now it is my turn
at last, and it is well. Twenty-four hours more and the world will be
gone from me, and with it all its hopes and all its fears. The air will
close in over the space that my form filled and my place know me no
more; for the dull breath of the world’s forgetfulness will first dim
the brightness of my memory, and then blot it out for ever, and of a
truth I shall be dead. So is it with us all. How many millions have lain
as I lie, and thought these thoughts and been forgotten!--thousands upon
thousands of years ago they thought them, those dying men of the dim
past; and thousands on thousands of years hence will their descendants
think them and be in their turn forgotten. ‘As the breath of the oxen
in winter, as the quick star that runs along the sky, as a little shadow
that loses itself at sunset,’ as I once heard a Zulu called Ignosi put
it, such is the order of our life, the order that passeth away.
</p><p>Well, it is not a good world--nobody can say that it is, save those who
wilfully blind themselves to facts. How can a world be good in which
Money is the moving power, and Self-interest the guiding star? The
wonder is not that it is so bad, but that there should be any good left
in it.
</p><p>Still, now that my life is over, I am glad to have lived, glad to have
known the dear breath of woman’s love, and that true friendship which
can even surpass the love of woman, glad to have heard the laughter of
little children, to have seen the sun and the moon and the stars, to
have felt the kiss of the salt sea on my face, and watched the wild game
trek down to the water in the moonlight. But I should not wish to live
again!
</p><p>Everything is changing to me. The darkness draws near, and the light
departs. And yet it seems to me that through that darkness I can already
see the shining welcome of many a long-lost face. Harry is there, and
others; one above all, to my mind the sweetest and most perfect woman
that ever gladdened this grey earth. But of her I have already written
elsewhere, and at length, so why speak of her now? Why speak of her
after this long silence, now that she is again so near to me, now that I
go where she has gone?
</p><p>The sinking sun is turning the golden roof of the great Temple to a
fiery flame, and my fingers tire.
</p><p>So to all who have known me, or known of me, to all who can think one
kindly thought of the old hunter, I stretch out my hand from the far-off
shore and bid a long farewell.
</p><p>And now into the hands of Almighty God, who sent it, do I commit my
spirit.
</p><p>‘_I have spoken,_’ as the Zulus say.
