MY DEAR AUNT ERNIE,  -  At last I have a chance of sending you a
letter - and, this time at any rate, you won't have to complain
about my sending you no news.  I'll promise you that, before I
begin, and you needn't get scared either, because it's all good.
I've been awfully lucky, and all because that fellow Cathcart
turned out such a funk and a bounder.  It's the oddest thing in
the world too, that old Cis should have written me to pick up all
the news I could about Scarlett Trent and send it to you.  Why,
he's within a few feet of me at this moment, and I've been seeing
him continually ever since I came here.  But there, I'll try and
begin at the beginning.
<P>
"You know Cathcart got the post of Consulting Surveyor and Engineer
to the Bekwando Syndicate, and he was head man at our London place.
Well, they sent me from Capetown to be junior to him, and a jolly
good move for me too.  I never did see anything in Cathcart!  He's
a lazy sort of chap, hates work, and I guess he only got the job
because his uncle had got a lot of shares in the business.  It seems
he never wanted to come, hates any place except London, which
accounts for a good deal.
<P>
"All the time when we were waiting, he wasn't a bit keen and kept
on rotting about the good times he might have been having in London,
and what a fearful country we were stranded in, till he almost gave
me the blues, and if there hadn't been some jolly good shooting and
a few nice chaps up at the Fort, I should have been miserable.   As
it was, I left him to himself a good deal, and he didn't like that
either.  I think Attra was a jolly place, and the landing in surf
boats was no end of fun.  Cathcart got beastly wet, and you should
have seen what a stew he was in because he'd put on a beautiful
white suit and it got spoilt.  Well, things weren't very lively at
Attra at first, I'm bound to admit.  No one seemed to know much
about the Bekwando Land Company, and the country that way was very
rough.  However, we got sent out at last, and Cathcart, he simply
scoffed at the whole thing from the first.  There was no proper
labour, not half enough machinery, and none of the right sort - and
the gradients and country between Bekwando and the sea were awful.
Cathcart made a few reports and we did nothing but kick our heels
about until HE came.  You'll see I've written that in big letters,
and I tell you if ever a man deserved to have his name written
in capitals Scarlett Trent does, and the oddest part of it is he
knows you, and he was awfully decent to me all the time.
<P>
"Well, out he went prospecting, before he'd been in the country
twenty-four hours, and he came back quite cheerful.  Then he spoke
to Cathcart about starting work, and Cathcart was a perfect beast.
He as good as told him that he'd come out under false pretences,
that the whole affair was a swindle and that the road could not be
made.  Trent didn't hesitate, I can tell you.  There were no
arguments or promises with him.  He chucked Cathcart on the spot,
turned him out of the place, and swore he'd make the road himself.
I asked if I might stop, and I think he was glad, anyhow we've been
ever such pals ever since, and I never expect to have such a time
again as long as I live!  But do you know, Auntie, we've about made
that road.  When I see what we've done, sometimes I can't believe
it.  I only wish some of the bigwigs who've never been out of an
office could see it.  I know I'll hate to come away.
<P>
"You'd never believe the time we had - leaving out the fighting,
which I am coming to by and by.  We were beastly short of all sorts
of machinery and our labour was awful.  We had scarcely any at
first, but Trent found 'em somehow, Kru boys and native Zulus
and broken-down Europeans - any one who could hold a pick.  More
came every day, and we simply cut our way through the country.  I
think I was pretty useful, for you see I was the only chap there
who knew even a bit about engineering or practical surveying, and
I'd sit up all night lots of times working the thing out.  We had
a missionary came over the first Sunday, and wanted to preach, but
Trent stopped him.  'We've got to work here,' he said, 'and Sunday
or no Sunday I can't let my men stop to listen to you in the cool
of the day.  If you want to preach, come and take a pick now, and
preach when they're resting,' and he did and worked well too, and
afterwards when we had to knock off, he preached, and Trent took
the chair and made 'em all listen.  Well, when we got a bit inland
we had the natives to deal with, and if you ask me I believe that's
one reason Cathcart hated the whole thing so.  He's a beastly coward
I think, and he told me once he'd never let off a revolver in his
life.  Well, they tried to surprise us one night, but Trent was up
himself watching, and I tell you we did give 'em beans.  Great,
ugly-looking, black chaps they were.  Aunt Ernie, I shall never
forget how I felt when I saw them come creeping through the long,
rough grass with their beastly spears all poised ready to throw.
And now for my own special adventure.  Won't you shiver when you
read this!  I was taken prisoner by one of those chaps, carried off
to their beastly village and very nearly murdered by a chap who
seemed to be a cross between an executioner and a high-priest, and
who kept dancing round me, singing a lot of rot and pointing a knife
at me.  You see, I was right on the outside of the fighting and I
got a knock on the head with the butt-end of a spear, and was a bit
silly for a moment, and a great chap, who'd seen me near Trent and
guessed I was somebody, picked me up as though I'd been a baby and
carried me off.  Of course I kicked up no end of a row as soon as
I came to, but what with the firing and the screeching no one heard
me, and Trent said it was half an hour before he missed me and an
hour before they started in pursuit.  Anyhow, there I was, about
morning-time when you were thinking of having your cup of tea,
trussed up like a fowl in the middle of the village, and all the
natives, beastly creatures, promenading round me and making faces
and bawling out things - oh, it was beastly I can tell you!  Then
just as they seemed to have made up their mind to kill me, up
strode Scarlett Trent alone, if you please, and he walked up to
the whole lot of 'em as bold as brass.  He'd got a long way ahead
of the rest and thought they meant mischief, so he wouldn't wait for
the others but faced a hundred of them with a revolver in his hand,
and I can tell you things were lively then.  I'd never be able to
describe the next few minutes - one man Trent knocked down with his
fist, and you could hear his skull crack, then he shot the chap who
had been threatening me, and cut my bonds, and then they tried to
resist us, and I thought it was all over.  They were horribly afraid
of Trent though, and while they were closing round us the others
came up and the natives chucked it at once.  They used to be a very
brave race, but since they were able to get rum for their timber
and ivory, they're a lazy and drunken lot.  Well, I must tell you
what Trent did then.  He went to the priest's house where the gods
were kept - such a beastly hole - and he burned the place before
the eyes of all the natives.  I believe they thought every moment
that we should be struck dead, and they stood round in a ring,
making an awful row, but they never dared interfere.  He burnt the
place to the ground, and then what do you think he did?  From the
King downward he made every Jack one of them come and work on his
road.  You'll never believe it, but it's perfectly true.  They
looked upon him as their conqueror, and they came like lambs when
he ordered it.  They think they're slaves you know, and don't
understand their pay, but they get it every week and same as all
the other labourers - and oh, Aunt Ernie, you should see the King
work with a pickaxe!  He is fat and so clumsy and so furiously
angry, but he's too scared of Trent to do anything but obey orders,
and there he works hour after hour, groaning, and the perspiration
rolls off him as though he were in a Turkish bath.  I could go on
telling you odd things that happen here for hours, but I must finish
soon as the chap is starting with the mail.  I am enjoying it.  It
is something like life I can tell you, and aren't I lucky?  Trent
made me take Cathcart's place.  I am getting 800 pounds a year, and
only fancy it, he says he'll see that the directors make me a
special grant.  Everything looks very different here now, and I do
hope the Company will be a success.  There's whole heaps of mining
machinery landed and waiting for the road to be finished to go up,
and people seem to be streaming into the place.  I wonder what
Cathcart will say when he knows that the road is as good as done,
and that I've got his job!
<P>
   "Chap called for mail.  Goodbye.
                               "Ever your affectionate
                                                   "FRED.
"Trent is a brick."
<P>
Ernestine read the letter slowly, line by line, word by word.  To
tell the truth it was absorbingly interesting to her.  Already
there had come rumours of the daring and blunt, resistless force
with which this new-made millionaire had confronted a gigantic task.
His terse communications had found their way into the Press, and in
them and in the boy's letter she seemed to discover something
Caesaric.  That night it was more than usually difficult for her to
settle down to her own work.  She read her nephew's letter more than
once and continually she found her thoughts slipping away - traveling
across the ocean to a tropical strip of country, where a
heterogeneous crowd of men were toiling and digging under a blazing
sun.  And, continually too, she seemed to see a man's face looking
steadily over the sea to her, as he stood upright for a moment and
rested from his toil.  She was very fond of the boy - but the face
was not his!
