<p>Charles Stuart Boggs&mdash;His Coolness in the Presence of Danger
&mdash;His Desperate Fight Below New Orleans &mdash;His Subsequent
Services.</p>

<p>When the gallant Lawrence, mortally wounded on the <em>Chesapeake</em>,
was dying, he called out in his delirium, "Don't give up the ship!"
thus furnishing a motto that has served times without number for
the American navy. Among the mourning relatives left by Lawrence
was a married sister, Mrs. Boggs, who lived in New Brunswick,
<em>N.J., </em>where a son was born to her in January, 1811, and
named Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>It was probably the admiration formed for his heroic uncle which
led the boy to determine to follow in his footsteps, for he was
appointed a midshipman when fifteen years old, and saw active
service in the Mediterranean against the Greek pirates, to which
reference has been made in a previous chapter. He was made lieutenant
in 1833. One of the most marked traits in young Boggs was his
perfect coolness in times of peril and his instant perception
of the best thing to do. The following incident will illustrate
this remarkable power on his part, which was united to a gentleness
of disposition that made one wonder at his daring and intrepidity.</p>

<p>During the war with Mexico Lieutenant Boggs was ordered to the
steamer <em>Princeton</em>, which took a leading part in the bombardment
of the Castle of St. Juan de Ulloa and of Tampico. The brig <em>Truxton</em>
unfortunately ran aground on the bar of Tuspan River and had to
be surrendered to the Mexicans. The <em>Princeton</em> was ordered
to destroy her. Anchoring near the wreck, a boat was manned and
placed in charge of Lieutenant Boggs, to whom the work of destruction
was intrusted.</p>

<p>The boat had nearly reached the stranded vessel when it was caught
in one of the tropical tempests, which sometimes appear with cyclonic
suddenness in that part of the world. It was impossible to board
the wreck, and equally impossible to get back to the <em>Princeton</em>.
A powerful current set in toward shore, in which direction the
gale was blowing. The combined efforts of the sturdy rowers could
not check the progress of the boat, which perhaps would have been
the right course to take but for an alarming discovery.</p>

<p>On the beach a company of Mexican soldiers were drawn up with
a field piece, making ready to annihilate the little American
company, as they could do without the slightest difficulty before
the gallant sailors could land and make a charge. Here was a dilemma
indeed. Nothing could extricate the boat and its crew from their
peril and not a man could raise a finger to help himself.</p>

<p>There was only one person who saw the only possible thing to
do. Lieutenant Boggs ordered the single white shirt in the party
to be torn up, tied on the end of a boathook and displayed as
a flag of truce. Then, by his directions, the men rowed with all
speed straight for the enemy, who were thus disarmed of their
hostile purpose. Walking up to the leader of the company, the
lieutenant explained that he had been sent to destroy the <em>Truxton</em>,
but had been driven ashore against his will. He hastened to explain
to the officer that he had no intention of attacking the town,
but he should do so if any one tried to prevent his destruction
of the stranded vessel.</p>

<p>When the insignificance of the American party is remembered,
there was something amusing in this; but the Mexican officer not
only gave his promise, but entertained his visitors until the
gale was over. Then the <em>Truxton</em> was fired and Boggs returned
to his ship.</p>

<p>He was on the Pacific coast when the Civil War broke out, serving
as inspector of lighthouses. Chafing under idleness, he petitioned
the Government to give him active employment afloat. His wish
was granted and he was placed in command of the <em>Varuna</em>,
a passenger steamer, purchased by the Government and changed into
a gunboat. Admiral Farragut was making his preparations to attack
New Orleans, and the <em>Varuna</em> was added to his fleet. She
was a very swift but frail craft, a fact which led Farragut to
grant Boggs' request to be allowed to run ahead of the position
that had been assigned him.</p>

<p>In order to get up all the steam possible, the pork among the
ship's store was flung into the blazing furnace under the boilers.
The craft went through the water at a tremendous speed, and upon
coming opposite the forts, Boggs fired his starboard battery and
then ordered grape and canister to be used as rapidly as possible.
Work had hardly begun when the Confederate gunboats appeared on
every hand. With the same coolness that he had shown when driven
ashore in Mexico, the command was given for the guns to be fired
"on both sides." Indeed, there were so many targets that it would
have been about as difficult to miss as to hit one.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>ATTACK ON ROANOKE ISLAND &</em>mdash;<em>LANDING
OF THE TROOPS</em>.]</p>

<p>The <em>Varuna</em> did terrific work, her gunners displaying
fine markmanship. The formidable craft <em>Governor Moore</em>
had detected her in the early morning light, and steaming after
her, fired a shot when only a hundred yards away, but missed.
The <em>Varuna</em> replied, killing and wounding men on the <em>Governor
Moore</em> at every shot. One of the enemy's shot, however, raked
the <em>Varuna</em>, killing four men and wounding nine. Another
struck the <em>Varuna's</em> pivot gun and killed and wounded
a number more. Then the <em>Governor Moore</em> rammed the <em>Varuna</em>
twice in quick succession.</p>

<p>But while the Confederate was doing so, Boggs planted three 8-inch
shells into his antagonist, which set her on fire and compelled
her to drop out of action. Her loss had been heavy and her engines
were so battered that her commander ran her ashore, where she
was burned to the water's edge.</p>

<p>Out of the misty light burst the <em>Stonewall Jackson</em> and
rammed the <em>Varuna</em> on the port side, repeating the blow
with a viciousness that stove in the vessel below the water line;
but the <em>Varuna</em> swung the ram ahead until her own broadside
guns bore, when she planted several 5-inch shells into the <em>Stonewall
Jackson</em>, which set her on fire and caused her to drift ashore.</p>

<p>But the <em>Varuna</em> had been mortally hurt and was sinking
fast. To quote the words of Commodore Boggs: "In fifteen minutes
from the time the <em>Varuna</em> was struck by the <em>Stonewall
Jackson</em>, she was on the bottom, with only her topgallant
forecastle out of the water."</p>

<p>But those were exceedingly lively minutes for the <em>Varuna</em>
and the other craft in her neighborhood. Commander Boggs turned
her prow toward shore and crowded all steam, firing his guns as
the water rose about the trucks. When the last shell left the
side of the sinking vessel the current had reached the mouth of
the piece, and some of it was blown out like mist with the shrieking
missile.</p>

<p>The moment the bow of the <em>Varuna</em> struck the bank a chain
cable was fastened around the trunk of a tree, so as to prevent
her from sliding into deep water as she went down and taking the
wounded and dead with her. This was a precaution which would not
have occurred to every man in the situation of Commander Boggs.</p>

<p>The daring conduct of this officer brought a tribute from one
of our poets, which contains the stanzas:</p>

<p>"Who has not heard of the dauntless <em>Varuna</em>?   Who shall
not hear of the deeds she has done? Who shall not hear while the
brown Mississippi   Rushes along from the snow to the sun?</p>

<p>"Five of the rebels like satellites round her,   Burned in her
orbit of splendor and fear, One like the Pleiad of mystical story  
Shot terror-stricken beyond her dread sphere."</p>

<p>When Boggs' native city heard of his gallant conduct it voted
him a sword, and the State of New Jersey did the same. He came
North and was appointed to the command of the blockading squadron
off Wilmington. He would have preferred active service, and finally
his health broke down under the exposure and fatigue to which
he was subjected, and he was compelled to return home to recruit.
Upon his recovery, he was appointed to duty in New York, but the
war ended without his having another opportunity to distinguish
himself in the service of his country. He died a few years after
the close of hostilities.</p>
