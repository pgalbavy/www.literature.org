<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Five days running, Geraldine, Duane, and old Miller watched for
the big gray boar among the rocky oak ridges under Cloudy Mountain;
and though once they saw his huge tracks, they did not see him.</p>

<p>Every night, on their return, Scott jeered them and taunted them
until a personal encounter with Duane was absolutely necessary,
and they always adjourned to the snowy field of honour to wipe
off the score and each other's faces with the unblemished snow.</p>

<p>Rosalie and a Chow-dog arrived by the middle of the week; Delancy
toward the end of it, unencumbered. Duane made a mental note of
his own assininity, and let it go at that. He was as glad to see
Rosalie as anybody, and just as glad to see Delancy, but he'd
have preferred to enjoy the pleasures separately, though it really
didn't matter, after all.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later," he admitted to himself, "that Delancy man
is going to marry her; and it seems to me she's entitled to another
chance in the world. Even our earthly courts are lenient toward
first offenders. As for the ethics&mdash;puzzle it out, you!" He made
a gesture including the world in general, lighted a cigarette,
and went out to the gun-room to join Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Rosalie and Delancy want to go shooting with us," he explained
with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Oh, Duane!&mdash;and our solitary and very heavenly trips alone together!"</p>

<p>"I know it. I have just telephoned Miller to get Kemp from Westgate
for them. Is that all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"I think so."</p>

<p>"Let Kemp guide them," he insisted. "They'll never hold out as
far as Cloudy Mountain. All they want is to shoot a boar, no matter
how big it is. Miller says the boar are feeding again near the
Green Pass. It's easy enough to send them there."</p>

<p>"Do you think that is perfectly hospitable? Rosalie and Delancy
may find it rather stupid going off alone together with only Kemp
to amuse them. I am fond of him," she added, "but you know what
a woman like Rosalie is prone to think of Delancy."</p>

<p>He glanced at her keenly; she had, evidently, not the slightest
notion of the <em>status quo</em>.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll get along together, all right," he said carelessly.
"If they choose to remain with us, of course we all can keep on
to Cloudy Mountain; but you'll see them accept Kemp and the Green
Pass with grateful alacrity after two miles of snow-shoeing through
the brush; and we'll have the mountain all to ourselves."</p>

<p>"You're a shameless deviser of schemes, aren't you, dear?" she
asked, considering him with that faint, intimate smile, which,
however, had always in it something of curiosity. "You know perfectly
well we could drive those poor people the whole way to Cloudy
Mountain."</p>

<p>"Why, that <em>is</em> so!" he exclaimed, pretending surprise;
"but, after all, dear, it's better sport to beat up the alders
below Green Pass and try to jump a pig for them. That's true hospitality&#11834;"</p>

<p>She laughed, shaking her head. "Oh, Duane, Duane!" she murmured,
suffering him to capture both her hands and lay them against his
face to cover the glee that twitched it at his own unholy perfidy.</p>

<p>And so it came about that, after an early luncheon, a big double
sleigh jingled up, received its jolly cargo, and sped away again
into the white woodlands, Kathleen waving adieu and Scott deriding
them with scoffing and snowballs.</p>

<p>The drive was very beautiful, particularly through the pine and
hemlock belt where the great trees, clothed heavily with snow,
bent branch and crest under the pale winter sunshine. Tall fir-balsams
pricked the sky, perfect cones of white; spruces were snowy mounds;
far into the forest twilight glimmered the unsullied snow.</p>

<p>As they sped along, Geraldine pointed out imprints of fox and
rabbit, faint trails where a field-mouse had passed, the string
of henlike footprints recording the deliberate progress of some
ruffed grouse picking its leisurely way across the snow; the sharp,
indented marks of squirrels.</p>

<p>Rosalie was enchanted, Delancy mildly so, but when a deeper trail
ploughed the snow, running parallel to their progress, he regarded
it with more animation.</p>

<p>"Pig," said Geraldine briefly.</p>

<p>"Wild?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Of course," she smiled; "and probably a good big boar."</p>

<p>Rosalie thrilled and unconsciously rested her fur-gloved hand
on Delancy's sleeve.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "you must shoot a little straighter than
you did at target practice this morning. Because I can't run very
fast," she added with another delightful shudder.</p>

<p>Delancy, at her anxious request, modestly assured her that he
would "plug" the first boar that showed his tusks; and Geraldine
laughed and made Rosalie promise to do the same.</p>

<p>"You're both likely to have a shot," she said as the sleigh drew
up on a stone bridge and Miller and Kemp came over and saluted&mdash;big,
raw-boned men on snow-shoes, wearing no outer coats over their
thin woollen shirts, although every thermometer at Roya-Neh recorded
zero.</p>

<p>Gun-cases were handed out, rifles withdrawn, and the cases stowed
away in the sleigh again. Fur coats were rolled in pairs, strapped,
and slung behind the broad shoulders of the guides. Then snow-shoes
were adjusted&mdash;skis for Geraldine; Miller walked westward and
took post; Kemp's huge bulk closed the eastern extremity of the
line, and between them, two and two at thirty paces apart, stood
the hunters, Duane with Rosalie, Geraldine with Delancy, loading
their magazines.</p>

<p>Ahead was an open wood of second growth, birch, beech, and maple;
sunlight lay in white splashes here and there; nothing except
these blinding pools of light and the soft impression of a fallen
twig varied the immaculate snow surface as far as the eye could
see.</p>

<p>"Forward and silence," called out Geraldine; the mellow swish
of snow-shoes answered her, and she glided forward on her skis,
instructing Delancy under her breath.</p>

<p>"The wind is right," she said. "They can't scent us here, though
deeper in the mountains the wind cuts up and you never can be
sure what it may do. There's just a chance of jumping a pig here,
but there's a better chance when we strike the alder country.
Try not to shoot a sow."</p>

<p>"How am I to tell?"</p>

<p>"Sows have no tusks that show. Be careful not to mistake the
white patches of snow on a sow's jowl for tusks. They get them
by rooting and it's not always easy to tell."</p>

<p>Delancy said very honestly: "You'll have to control me; I'm likely
to let drive at anything."</p>

<p>"You're more likely to forget to shoot until the pig is out of
sight," she whispered, laughing. "Look! Three trails! They were
made last night."</p>

<p>"Boar?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded, glancing at the deep cloven imprints. She
leaned forward and glanced across the line at Miller, who caught
her eye and signalled significantly with one hand.</p>

<p>"Be ready, Delancy," she whispered. "There's a boar somewhere
ahead."</p>

<p>"How can you tell?"</p>

<p>"I can scent him. It's strong enough in the wind," she added,
wrinkling her delicate nose with a smile.</p>

<p>Grandcourt sniffed and sniffed, and finally detected a slight
acrid odour in the light, clear breeze. He looked wisely around
him; Geraldine was skirting a fallen tree on her skis; he started
on and was just rounding a clump of brush when there came a light,
crashing noise directly ahead of him; a big, dark, shaggy creature
went bounding and bucking across his line of vision&mdash;a most extraordinary
animal, all head and shoulders and big, furry ears.</p>

<p>The snapping crack of a rifle echoed by the sharp racket of another
shot aroused him to action too late, for Miller, knife drawn,
was hastening across the snow to a distant dark, motionless heap;
and Geraldine stood jerking back the ejector of her weapon and
throwing a fresh cartridge into the breach.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" he faltered, "somebody got him! Who fired, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>She said: "I waited as long as I dared, Delancy. They go like
lightning, you know. I'm terribly sorry you didn't fire."</p>

<p>"Good girl!" said Duane in a low voice as she sped by him on
her skis, rifle ready for emergencies as old Miller cautiously
approached the shaggy brown heap, knife glittering.</p>

<p>But there was no emergency; Miller's knife sank to the hilt;
Geraldine uncocked her rifle and bent curiously over the dead
boar.</p>

<p>"Nice tusks. Miss Seagrave," commented the old man. "He's fat
as butter, too. I cal'late he'll tip the beam at a hundred and
forty paound!"</p>

<p>The hunters clustered around with exclamations of admiration;
Rosalie, distractingly pretty in her white wool kilts and cap,
knelt down and touched the fierce, long-nosed head and stroked
the furry jowl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Delancy!" she wailed, "why <em>didn't</em> you 'plug' him
as you promised? <em>I</em> simply <em>couldn't</em> shoot; Duane
tried to make me, but I was so excited and so surprised to see
the creature run so fast that all my ideas went out of my head
and I never thought of pulling that wretched trigger!"</p>

<p>"That," said Delancy, very red, "is precisely what happened to
me." And, turning to Geraldine, who looked dreadfully repentant:
"I heard you tell me to shoot, and I merely gawked at the beast
like a rubbering jay at a ten-cent show."</p>

<p>"Everybody does that at first," said Duane cheerfully; "I'll
bet anything that you and Rosalie empty your magazines at the
next one."</p>

<p>"We really must, Delancy," insisted Rosalie as she and Geraldine
turned away when Miller and Kemp tucked up their sleeves and unsheathed
their knives in preparation for unpleasant but necessary details.</p>

<p>But they worked like lightning; and in exactly seven minutes
the heavy beast was drawn, washed out with snow, roped, and hung
to a tree well out of reach of any four-footed forest marauders
that might prowl that way before night.</p>

<p>Geraldine, smiling her deprecation of their praise, waited with
the others until the two guides were ready. Then, in the same
order as before, they moved forward, descended the slope, and
came into a strange wilderness of stark gray alders that stretched
away in every direction. And threading, circling, crossing each
other everywhere among the alders ran the trails of deer and wild
boar, deep and fresh in the powdery snow.</p>

<p>At intervals, as they advanced, hard-wood ridges crossed the
bewildering alder labyrinths. Twice, while ascending these ridges,
Rosalie's heart jumped as a grouse thundered up. Once three steel-gray
deer started out of the scrub and went bounding off, displaying
enormous white flags; once a young buck, hunting for trouble,
winded it, whistled, and came leaping past Rosalie so close that
she shrank aside with a half-stifled cry of apprehension and delight.</p>

<p>Half a mile farther on Delancy, labouring along on his snow-shoes,
suddenly halted, detaining Geraldine with a quick touch on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"There's something in that clearing," he whispered.</p>

<p>Miller had seen it, too; Duane motioned Rosalie forward to join
Delancy, and, side by side, they crept ahead, keeping a clump
of scrub hemlock between them and the edge of the clearing. It
was the Green Pass feed-ground, a rocky strip of pasture climbing
upward toward Lynx Peak; and there, clean cut against the snowy
background, three dark objects were moving, trotting nervously
here and there, nosing, nuzzling, tunnelling the snow with long,
sharp muzzles.</p>

<p>Duane and Geraldine silently unslung their field-glasses.</p>

<p>"They're boar," he said.</p>

<p>"Two-year-olds," she nodded. "I do hope they will get one each.
Duane, ought I to have shot that other one?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you generous child! Otherwise he'd have gone clear
away. That was a cracking shot, too&mdash;clean through the backbone
at the base of the skull.... Look at Rosalie! She's unstrapped
her snow-shoes and she and Delancy are crawling on all-fours!"</p>

<p>Kemp had now joined the stalkers; he was a wise old hunter, and
Duane and Geraldine, keeping very still, watched the operations
side by side.</p>

<p>For half an hour Rosalie lay motionless in the snow on the forest's
edge, and Geraldine was beginning to fret at the prospect of her
being too benumbed by the cold to use her rifle, when Duane touched
her on the arm and drew her attention to a fourth boar.</p>

<p>The animal came on from behind Rosalie and to Delancy's right&mdash;a
good-sized, very black fellow, evidently suspicious yet tempted
to reconnoitre the feeding-ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear!" she whispered; "what a shot Delancy has!
Why <em>doesn't</em> he see him! What on earth is Kemp about?
Why, the boar is within ten feet of Delancy's legs and doesn't
see or wind him!"</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Kemp had caught sight of the fourth boar. Geraldine and Duane
saw his dilemma, saw him silently give Rosalie the signal to fire
at the nearest boar in the open, then saw him turn like a flash
and almost drag Delancy to his feet.</p>

<p>"Kill that pig, <em>now</em>!" he thundered&mdash;"unless you want
him hackin' your shins!"</p>

<p>The boar stood in his tracks, bristling, furious, probably astounded
to find himself so close to the only thing in all the forest that
he feared and would have preferred to flee from.</p>

<p>Under such conditions boars lose their heads; there was a sudden
clatter of tusks, a muffled, indescribable sound, half squeal,
half roar; a fountain of feathery snow, and two shots close together.
Then a third shot.</p>

<p>Rosalie, rather pale, threw another cartridge in as Delancy picked
himself out of a snow-bank and looked around him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well done, young lady!" cried Kemp, running a fistful of snow
over the blade of his hunting-knife and nodding his admiration.
"I guess it's just as well you disobeyed orders and let this funny
pig have what was coming to him. Y' ain't hurt, are ye, Mr. Grandcourt?"</p>

<p>"No; he didn't hit me; I tripped on that root. Did I miss him?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Duane, kneeling down while Miller lifted the
great fierce head. "You hit him all right, but it didn't stop
him; it only turned him. Here's your second bullet, too; and Rosalie,
yours did the business for him. Good for you! It's fine, isn't
it, Geraldine?"</p>

<p>Grandcourt, flushing heavily, turned to Rosalie and held out
his hand. "Thank you," he said; "the brute was right on top of
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said honestly, "he'd missed you and was going straight
on. I don't know how on earth I ever hit him, but I was so frightened
to see you go over backward and I thought that he'd knocked you
down, and I was perfectly furious&#11834;"</p>

<p>She gave a little sob of excitement, laughed unsteadily, and
sat down on a fallen log, burying her face in her hands.</p>

<p>They knew enough to let her alone and pretend not to notice her.
Geraldine chattered away cheerfully to the two men while the keepers
drew the game. Delancy tried to listen to her, but his anxious
eyes kept turning toward Rosalie, and at length, unable to endure
it, he went over and sat down beside her, careless of what others
might infer.</p>

<p>"How funny," whispered Geraldine to Duane. "I had no idea that
Delancy was so fond of her. Had you?"</p>

<p>He started slightly. "I? Oh, no," he said hastily&mdash;too hastily.
He was a very poor actor.</p>

<p>Gravely, head bent, she walked forward beside him after Grandcourt
had announced that he and Rosalie had had enough and that they
wished Kemp to take them and their game to the sleigh.</p>

<p>Once, looking back, she saw the procession moving in the opposite
direction through the woods, Kemp leading, rope over his shoulder,
dragging the dead boar across the snow; Grandcourt, both rifles
slung across his back, big arm supporting Rosalie, who walked
as though very tired, her bright head drooping, her arm resting
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Geraldine looked up at Duane thoughtfully, and he supposed that
she was about to speak, but her gaze became remote; she shifted
her rifle, and walked on.</p>

<p>Before they came to the wild, shaggy country below Cloudy Mountain
she said:</p>

<p>"I've been thinking it over, Duane. I can see in it nothing that
can concern anybody except themselves. Can you?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, dear.... I'm sorry I suggested his coming. I knew
about this, but I clean forgot it when I asked you to invite him."</p>

<p>"I remember, now, your consternation when you realised it," she
said, smiling. "After all, Duane, if it is bound to happen, I
don't mind it happening here.... Poor, lonely little Rosalie!...
I'm depraved enough to be glad for her&mdash;if it is really to be
so."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, too.... Only she ought to begin her action, I think.
It's more prudent and better taste."</p>

<p>"You said once that you had a contempt for divorce."</p>

<p>"I never entertain the same opinion of anything two days in succession,"
he said, smiling. "When there is any one moral law that can justly
cover every case which it is framed to govern, I'll be glad to
remain more constant in my beliefs."</p>

<p>"Then you <em>do</em> believe in divorce?"</p>

<p>"To-day I happen to."</p>

<p>"Duane, is that your attitude toward everything?"</p>

<p>"Everything except you," he said cheerfully. "That is literally
true. Even in my painting and in my liking for the work of others,
I veer about like a weather-vane, never holding very long to one
point of view."</p>

<p>"You're very frank about it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a&mdash;a weakness?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," he said so simply that she tucked her arm
under his with a soft, confidential laugh.</p>

<p>"You goose; do you suppose I think there is a weak fibre in you?
I've always adored the strength in you&mdash;even when it was rough
enough to bruise me. Listen, dear; there's only one thing you
might possibly weaken on. Promise you won't."</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"Then," she said triumphantly, "you'll take first shot at the
big boar! Are you angry because I made you promise? If you only
knew, dear, how happy I have been, saving the best I had to offer,
in this forest, for you! You will make me happy, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, you little trump!" he said, encircling her
waist, forgetful of old Miller, plodding along behind them.</p>

<p>But it was no secret to old Miller, nor to any native in the
country-side for a radius of forty miles. No modern invention
can equal the wireless celerity that distributes information concerning
other people's business throughout the rural wastes of this great
and gossipping nation.</p>

<p>She made him release her, blushing hotly as she remembered that
Miller was behind them, and she scolded her lover roundly, until
later, in a moment of thoughtlessness, she leaned close to his
shoulder and told him she adored him with every breath she drew,
which was no sillier than his reply.</p>

<p>The long blue shadows on the snow and the pink bars of late sunlight
had died out together. It had grown warmer and grayer in the forest;
and after a little one or two snow-flakes came sifting down through
the trees.</p>

<p>They had not jumped the big silver boar, nor had they found a
trace of him among the trails that crossed and recrossed the silent
reaches of the forest. Light was fading to the colourless, opaque
gray which heralded a snow-storm as they reached the feeding-ground,
spread out their fur coats, and dropped, belly down, to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>Nothing moved among the oaks. They lay listening minute after
minute; no significant sound broke the silence, no dead branch
cracked in the hemlocks.</p>

<p>She lay close to him for warmth, chin resting on his shoulder,
her cheek against his. Their snow-shoes were stuck upright in
a drift behind them; beside these squatted old Miller, listening,
peering, nostrils working in the wind like an old dog's.</p>

<p>They waited and watched through a fine veil of snow descending;
in the white silence there was not a sound save the silken flutter
of a lonely chickadee, friendly, inquiring, dropping from twig
to twig until its tiny bright eyes peered level with Geraldine's.</p>

<p>Evidently the great boar was not feeding before night. Duane
turned his head restlessly; old Miller, too, had become impatient
and they saw him prowling noiselessly down among the rocks, scrutinising
snow and thickets, casting wise glances among the trees, shaking
his white head as though communing with himself.</p>

<p>"Well, little girl," breathed Duane, "it looks doubtful, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>She turned on her side toward him, looking him in the eyes:</p>

<p>"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>She reached out her arms; they settled close around his neck,
clung for a second's passionate silence, released him and covered
her flushed face, all but the mouth. Under them his lips met hers.</p>

<p>The next instant she was on her knees, pink-cheeked, alert, ears
straining in the wind.</p>

<p>"Miller is coming back very fast!" she whispered to her lover.
"I believe he has good news!"</p>

<p>Miller was coming fast, holding out in one hand something red
and gray&mdash;something that dangled and flapped as he strode&mdash;something
that looked horrible and raw.</p>

<p>"Damn him!" said the old man fiercely, "no wonder he ain't a-feedin'!
Look at this, Miss Seagrave. There's more of it below&mdash;a hull
mess of it in the snow."</p>

<p>"It's a big strip of deer-hide&mdash;all raw and bleeding!" faltered
the girl. "What in the world has happened?"</p>

<p>"<em>His</em> work," said Miller grimly.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the big boar?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. The deer yard over there. He sneaked in on 'em last night
and this doe must have got stuck in a drift. And that devil caught
her and pulled her down and tore her into bits. Why, the woods
is all scattered with shreds o' hide like this! I wish to God
you or Mr. Mallett could get one crack at him! I do, by thunder!
Yes'm!"</p>

<p>But it was already too dusky among the trees to sight a rifle.
In silence they strapped up the coats, fastened on snow-shoes,
and moved out along the bare spur of the mountain, where there
was still daylight in the open, although the thickening snow made
everything gray and vague.</p>

<p>Here and there a spectral tree loomed up among the rocks; a white
hare's track, paralleled by the big round imprints of a lynx,
ran along the unseen path they followed as Miller guided them
toward Westgate.</p>

<p>Later, outlined in the white waste, ancient apple-trees appeared,
gnarled relics of some long-abandoned clearing; and, as they passed,
Duane chanced to glance across the rocks to the left.</p>

<p>At first he thought he saw something move, but began to make
up his mind that he was deceived.</p>

<p>Noticing that he had halted, Geraldine came back, and then Miller
returned to where he stood, squinting through the falling flakes
in the vague landscape beyond.</p>

<p>"It moved; I seen it," whispered Miller hoarsely.</p>

<p>"It's a deer," motioned Geraldine; "it's too big for anything
else."</p>

<p>For five minutes in perfect silence they watched the gray, flat
forms of scrub and rock; and Duane was beginning to lose faith
in everybody's eyes when, without warning, a huge, colourless
shape detached itself from the flat silhouettes and moved leisurely
out into the open.</p>

<p>There was no need to speak; trembling slightly, he cleared his
rifle sight of snow, steadied his nerves, raised the weapon, and
fired.</p>

<p>A horrid sort of scream answered the shot; the boar lurched off
among the rocks, and after him at top speed ran Duane and Miller,
while Geraldine, on swift skis, sped eastward like the wind to
block retreat to the mountain. She heard Duane's rifle crack again,
then again; heard a heavy rush in the thicket in front of her,
lifted her rifle, fired, was hurled sideways on the rocks, and
knew no more until she unclosed her bewildered eyes in her lover's
arms.</p>

<p>A sharp pain shot through her; she gasped, turned very white,
and lay with wide eyes and parted lips staring at Duane.</p>

<p>Suddenly a penetrating aroma filled her lungs; with all her strength
she pushed away the flask at her lips.</p>

<p>"No! No! Not that! I <em>will</em> not, Duane!"</p>

<p>"Dear," he said unsteadily, "you are very badly hurt. We are
trying to carry you back. You must let me give you this&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No," she sobbed, "I will not! Duane &mdash;<em>I&mdash;" </em>Pain
made her faint; her grasp on his arm tightened convulsively; with
a supreme effort she struck the flask out of his hand and dropped
back unconscious.</p>
