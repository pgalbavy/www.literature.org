<p>Our first sight of Tembinok’ was a matter of concern, almost alarm, to my
whole party.  We had a favour to seek; we must approach in the proper
courtly attitude of a suitor; and must either please him or fail in the
main purpose of our voyage.  It was our wish to land and live in Apemama,
and see more near at hand the odd character of the man and the odd (or
rather ancient) condition of his island.  In all other isles of the South
Seas a white man may land with his chest, and set up house for a
lifetime, if he choose, and if he have the money or the trade; no
hindrance is conceivable.  But Apemama is a close island, lying there in
the sea with closed doors; the king himself, like a vigilant officer,
ready at the wicket to scrutinise and reject intrenching visitors.  Hence
the attraction of our enterprise; not merely because it was a little
difficult, but because this social quarantine, a curiosity in itself, has
been the preservative of others.
</p>
<p>Tembinok’, like most tyrants, is a conservative; like many conservatives,
he eagerly welcomes new ideas, and, except in the field of politics,
leans to practical reform.  When the missionaries came, professing a
knowledge of the truth, he readily received them; attended their worship,
acquired the accomplishment of public prayer, and made himself a student
at their feet.  It is thus—it is by the cultivation of similar passing
chances—that he has learned to read, to write, to cipher, and to speak
his queer, personal English, so different from ordinary ‘Beach de Mar,’
so much more obscure, expressive, and condensed.  His education attended
to, he found time to become critical of the new inmates.  Like Nakaeia of
Makin, he is an admirer of silence in the island; broods over it like a
great ear; has spies who report daily; and had rather his subjects sang
than talked.  The service, and in particular the sermon, were thus sure
to become offences: ‘Here, in my island, _I_ ’peak,’ he once observed to
me.  ‘My chieps no ’peak—do what I talk.’  He looked at the missionary,
and what did he see?  ‘See Kanaka ’peak in a big outch!’ he cried, with a
strong ring of sarcasm.  Yet he endured the subversive spectacle, and
might even have continued to endure it, had not a fresh point arisen.  He
looked again, to employ his own figure; and the Kanaka was no longer
speaking, he was doing worse—he was building a copra-house.  The king was
touched in his chief interests; revenue and prerogative were threatened.
He considered besides (and some think with him) that trade is
incompatible with the missionary claims.  ‘Tuppoti mitonary think “good
man”: very good.  Tuppoti he think “cobra”: no good.  I send him away
ship.’  Such was his abrupt history of the evangelist in Apemama.
</p><p>Similar deportations are common: ‘I send him away ship’ is the epitaph of
not a few, his majesty paying the exile’s fare to the next place of call.
For instance, being passionately fond of European food, he has several
times added to his household a white cook, and one after another these
have been deported.  They, on their side, swear they were not paid their
wages; he, on his, that they robbed and swindled him beyond endurance:
both perhaps justly.  A more important case was that of an agent,
despatched (as I heard the story) by a firm of merchants to worm his way
into the king’s good graces, become, if possible, premier, and handle the
copra in the interest of his employers.  He obtained authority to land,
practised his fascinations, was patiently listened to by Tembinok’,
supposed himself on the highway to success; and behold! when the next
ship touched at Apemama, the would-be premier was flung into a boat—had
on board—his fare paid, and so good-bye.  But it is needless to multiply
examples; the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  When we came to
Apemama, of so many white men who have scrambled for a place in that rich
market, one remained—a silent, sober, solitary, niggardly recluse, of
whom the king remarks, ‘I think he good; he no ’peak.’
</p><p>I was warned at the outset we might very well fail in our design: yet
never dreamed of what proved to be the fact, that we should be left
four-and-twenty hours in suspense and come within an ace of ultimate
rejection.  Captain Reid had primed himself; no sooner was the king on
board, and the Hennetti question amicably settled, than he proceeded to
express my request and give an abstract of my claims and virtues.  The
gammon about Queen Victoria’s son might do for Butaritari; it was out of
the question here; and I now figured as ‘one of the Old Men of England,’
a person of deep knowledge, come expressly to visit Tembinok’s dominion,
and eager to report upon it to the no less eager Queen Victoria.  The
king made no shadow of an answer, and presently began upon a different
subject.  We might have thought that he had not heard, or not understood;
only that we found ourselves the subject of a constant study.  As we sat
at meals, he took us in series and fixed upon each, for near a minute at
a time, the same hard and thoughtful stare.  As he thus looked he seemed
to forget himself, the subject and the company, and to become absorbed in
the process of his thought; the look was wholly impersonal; I have seen
the same in the eyes of portrait-painters.  The counts upon which whites
have been deported are mainly four: cheating Tembinok’, meddling overmuch
with copra, which is the source of his wealth, and one of the sinews of
his power, <u>’peaking</u>, and political intrigue.  I felt guiltless upon
all; but how to show it?  I would not have taken copra in a gift: how to
express that quality by my dinner-table bearing?  The rest of the party
shared my innocence and my embarrassment.  They shared also in my
mortification when after two whole meal-times and the odd moments of an
afternoon devoted to this reconnoitring, Tembinok’ took his leave in
silence.  Next morning, the same undisguised study, the same silence, was
resumed; and the second day had come to its maturity before I was
informed abruptly that I had stood the ordeal.  ‘I look your eye.  You
good man.  You no lie,’ said the king: a doubtful compliment to a writer
of romance.  Later he explained he did not quite judge by the eye only,
but the mouth as well.  ‘Tuppoti I see man,’ he explained.  ‘I no tavvy
good man, bad man.  I look eye, look mouth.  Then I tavvy.  Look <u>eye</u>,
look mouth,’ he repeated.  And indeed in our case the mouth had the most
to do with it, and it was by our talk that we gained admission to the
island; the king promising himself (and I believe really amassing) a vast
amount of useful knowledge ere we left.
</p><p>The terms of our admission were as follows: We were to choose a site, and
the king should there build us a town.  His people should work for us,
but the king only was to give them orders.  One of his cooks should come
daily to help mine, and to learn of him.  In case our stores ran out, he
would supply us, and be repaid on the return of the <u>Equator</u>.  On the
other hand, he was to come to meals with us when so inclined; when he
stayed at home, a dish was to be sent him from our table; and I solemnly
engaged to give his subjects no liquor or money (both of which they are
forbidden to possess) and no tobacco, which they were to receive only
from the royal hand.  I think I remember to have protested against the
stringency of this last article; at least, it was relaxed, and when a man
worked for me I was allowed to give him a pipe of tobacco on the
premises, but none to take away.
</p><p>The site of Equator City—we named our city for the schooner—was soon
chosen.  The immediate shores of the lagoon are windy and blinding;
Tembinok’ himself is glad to grope blue-spectacled on his terrace; and we
fled the neighbourhood of the red <u>conjunctiva</u>, the suppurating eyeball,
and the beggar who pursues and beseeches the passing foreigner for eye
wash.  Behind the town the country is diversified; here open, sandy,
uneven, and dotted with dwarfish palms; here cut up with taro trenches,
deep and shallow, and, according to the growth of the plants, presenting
now the appearance of a sandy tannery, now of an alleyed and green
garden.  A path leads towards the sea, mounting abruptly to the main
level of the island—twenty or even thirty feet, although Findlay gives
five; and just hard by the top of the rise, where the coco-palms begin to
be well grown, we found a grove of pandanus, and a piece of soil
pleasantly covered with green underbush.  A well was not far off under a
rustic well-house; nearer still, in a sandy cup of the land, a pond where
we might wash our clothes.  The place was out of the wind, out of the
sun, and out of sight of the village.  It was shown to the king, and the
town promised for the morrow.
</p><p>The morrow came, Mr. Osbourne landed, found nothing done, and carried his
complaint to Tembinok’.  He heard it, rose, called for a Winchester,
stepped without the royal palisade, and fired two shots in the air.  A
shot in the air is the first Apemama warning; it has the force of a
proclamation in more loquacious countries; and his majesty remarked
agreeably that it would make his labourers ‘mo’ bright.’  In less than
thirty minutes, accordingly, the men had mustered, the work was begun,
and we were told that we might bring our baggage when we pleased.
</p><p>It was two in the afternoon ere the first boat was beached, and the long
procession of chests and crates and sacks began to straggle through the
sandy desert towards Equator Town.  The grove of pandanus was practically
a thing of the past.  Fire surrounded and smoke rose in the green
underbush.  In a wide circuit the axes were still crashing.  Those very
advantages for which the place was chosen, it had been the king’s first
idea to abolish; and in the midst of this devastation there stood already
a good-sized maniap’ and a small closed house.  A mat was spread near by
for Tembinok’; here he sat superintending, in cardinal red, a pith helmet
on his head, a meerschaum pipe in his mouth, a wife stretched at his back
with custody of the matches and tobacco.  Twenty or thirty feet in front
of him the bulk of the workers squatted on the ground; some of the bush
here survived and in this the commons sat nearly to their shoulders, and
presented only an arc of brown faces, black heads, and attentive eyes
fixed on his majesty.  Long pauses reigned, during which the subjects
stared and the king smoked.  Then Tembinok’ would raise his voice and
speak shrilly and briefly.  There was never a response in words; but if
the speech were jesting, there came by way of answer discreet, obsequious
laughter—such laughter as we hear in schoolrooms; and if it were
practical, the sudden uprising and departure of the squad.  Twice they so
disappeared, and returned with further elements of the city: a second
house and a second maniap’.  It was singular to spy, far off through the
coco stems, the silent oncoming of the maniap’, at first (it seemed)
swimming spontaneously in the air—but on a nearer view betraying under
the eaves many score of moving naked legs.  In all the affair servile
obedience was no less remarkable than servile deliberation.  The gang had
here mustered by the note of a deadly weapon; the man who looked on was
the unquestioned master of their lives; and except for civility, they
bestirred themselves like so many American hotel clerks.  The spectator
was aware of an unobtrusive yet invincible inertia, at which the skipper
of a trading dandy might have torn his hair.
</p><p>Yet the work was accomplished.  By dusk, when his majesty withdrew, the
town was founded and complete, a new and ruder Amphion having called it
from nothing with three cracks of a rifle.  And the next morning the same
conjurer obliged us with a further miracle: a mystic rampart fencing us,
so that the path which ran by our doors became suddenly impassable, the
inhabitants who had business across the isle must fetch a wide circuit,
and we sat in the midst in a transparent privacy, seeing, seen, but
unapproachable, like bees in a glass hive.  The outward and visible sign
of this glamour was no more than a few ragged coco-leaf garlands round
the stems of the outlying palms; but its significance reposed on the
tremendous sanction of the tapu and the guns of Tembinok’.
</p><p>We made our first meal that night in the improvised city, where we were
to stay two months, and which—so soon as we had done with it—was to
vanish in a day as it appeared, its elements returning whence they came,
the tapu raised, the traffic on the path resumed, the sun and the moon
peering in vain between the palm-trees for the bygone work, the wind
blowing over an empty site.  Yet the place, which is now only an episode
in some memories, seemed to have been built, and to be destined to
endure, for years.  It was a busy hamlet.  One of the maniap’s we made
our dining-room, one the kitchen.  The houses we reserved for sleeping.
They were on the admirable Apemama plan: out and away the best house in
the South Seas; standing some three feet above the ground on posts; the
sides of woven flaps, which can be raised to admit light and air, or
lowered to shut out the wind and the rain: airy, healthy, clean, and
watertight.  We had a hen of a remarkable kind: almost unique in my
experience, being a hen that occasionally laid eggs.  Not far off, Mrs.
Stevenson tended a garden of salad and shalots.  The salad was devoured
by the hen—which was her bane.  The shalots were served out a leaf at a
time, and welcomed and relished like peaches.  Toddy and green cocoa-nuts
were brought us daily.  We once had a present of fish from the king, and
once of a turtle.  Sometimes we shot so-called plover along on the shore,
sometimes wild chicken in the bush.  The rest of our diet was from tins.
</p><p>Our occupations were very various.  While some of the party would be away
sketching, Mr. Osbourne and I hammered away at a novel.  We read Gibbon
and Carlyle aloud; we blew on flageolets, we strummed on guitars; we took
photographs by the light of the sun, the moon, and flash-powder;
sometimes we played cards.  Pot-hunting engaged a part of our leisure.  I
have myself passed afternoons in the exciting but innocuous pursuit of
winged animals with a revolver; and it was fortunate there were better
shots of the party, and fortunate the king could lend us a more suitable
weapon, in the form of an excellent fowling-piece, or our spare diet had
been sparer still.
</p><p>Night was the time to see our city, after the moon was up, after the
lamps were lighted, and so long as the fire sparkled in the cook-house.
We suffered from a plague of flies and mosquitoes, comparable to that of
Egypt; our dinner-table (lent, like all our furniture, by the king) must
be enclosed in a tent of netting, our citadel and refuge; and this became
all luminous, and bulged and beaconed under the eaves, like the globe of
some monstrous lamp under the margin of its shade.  Our cabins, the sides
being propped at a variety of inclinations, spelled out strange, angular
patterns of brightness.  In his roofed and open kitchen, Ah Fu was to be
seen by lamp and firelight, dabbling among pots.  Over all, there fell in
the season an extraordinary splendour of mellow moonshine.  The sand
sparkled as with the dust of diamonds; the stars had vanished.  At
intervals, a dusky night-bird, slow and low flying, passed in the
colonnade of the tree stems and uttered a hoarse croaking cry.
