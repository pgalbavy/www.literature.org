<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There is at present in China, as we have seen in previous chapters,
a close contact between our civilization and that which is native
to the Celestial Empire. It is still a doubtful question whether
this contact will breed a new civilization better than either
of its parents, or whether it will merely destroy the native culture
and replace it by that of America. Contacts between different
civilizations have often in the past proved to be landmarks in
human progress. Greece learnt from Egypt, Rome from Greece, the
Arabs from the Roman Empire, medi√¶val Europe from the Arabs, and
Renaissance Europe from the Byzantines. In many of these cases,
the pupils proved better than their masters. In the case of China,
if we regard the Chinese as the pupils, this may be the case again.
In fact, we have quite as much to learn from them as they from
us, but there is far less chance of our learning it. If I treat
the Chinese as our pupils, rather than vice versa, it is only
because I fear we are unteachable.</p>

<p>I propose in this chapter to deal with the purely cultural aspects
of the questions raised by the contact of China with the West.
In the three following chapters, I shall deal with questions concerning
the internal condition of China, returning finally, in a concluding
chapter, to the hopes for the future which are permissible in
the present difficult situation.</p>

<p>With the exception of Spain and America in the sixteenth century,
I cannot think of any instance of two civilizations coming into
contact after such a long period of separate development as has
marked those of China and Europe. Considering this extraordinary
separateness, it is surprising that mutual understanding between
Europeans and Chinese is not more difficult. In order to make
this point clear, it will be worth while to dwell for a moment
on the historical origins of the two civilizations.</p>

<p>Western Europe and America have a practically homogeneous mental
life, which I should trace to three sources: (1) Greek culture;
(2) Jewish religion and ethics; (3) modern industrialism, which
itself is an outcome of modern science. We may take Plato, the
Old Testament, and Galileo as representing these three elements,
which have remained singularly separable down to the present day.
From the Greeks we derive literature and the arts, philosophy
and pure mathematics; also the more urbane portions of our social
outlook. From the Jews we derive fanatical belief, which its friends
call "faith"; moral fervour, with the conception of sin; religious
intolerance, and some part of our nationalism. From science, as
applied in industrialism, we derive power and the sense of power,
the belief that we are as gods, and may justly be, the arbiters
of life and death for unscientific races. We derive also the empirical
method, by which almost all real knowledge has been acquired.
These three elements, I think, account for most of our mentality.</p>

<p>No one of these three elements has had any appreciable part in
the development of China, except that Greece indirectly influenced
Chinese painting, sculpture, and music.[93] China belongs, in
the dawn of its history, to the great river empires, of which
Egypt and Babylonia contributed to our origins, by the influence
which they had upon the Greeks and Jews. Just as these civilizations
were rendered possible by the rich alluvial soil of the Nile,
the Euphrates, and the Tigris, so the original civilization of
China was rendered possible by the Yellow River. Even in the time
of Confucius, the Chinese Empire did not stretch far either to
south or north of the Yellow River. But in spite of this similarity
in physical and economic circumstances, there was very little
in common between the mental outlook of the Chinese and that of
the Egyptians and Babylonians. Lao-Tze[94] and Confucius, who
both belong to the sixth century <em>B.C., </em>have already the
characteristics which we should regard as distinctive of the modern
Chinese. People who attribute everything to economic causes would
be hard put to it to account for the differences between the ancient
Chinese and the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. For my part,
I have no alternative theory to offer. I do not think science
can, at present, account wholly for national character. Climate
and economic circumstances account for part, but not the whole.
Probably a great deal depends upon the character of dominant individuals
who happen to emerge at a formative period, such as Moses, Mahomet,
and Confucius.</p>

<p>The oldest known Chinese sage is Lao-Tze, the founder of Taoism.
"Lao Tze" is not really a proper name, but means merely "the old
philosopher." He was (according to tradition) an older contemporary
of Confucius, and his philosophy is to my mind far more interesting.
He held that every person, every animal, and every thing has a
certain way or manner of behaving which is natural to him, or
her, or it, and that we ought to conform to this way ourselves
and encourage others to conform to it. "Tao" means "way," but
used in a more or less mystical sense, as in the text: "I am the
Way and the Truth and the Life." I think he fancied that death
was due to departing from the "way," and that if we all lived
strictly according to nature we should be immortal, like the heavenly
bodies. In later times Taoism degenerated into mere magic, and
was largely concerned with the search for the elixir of life.
But I think the hope of escaping from death was an element in
Taoist philosophy from the first.</p>

<p>Lao-Tze's book, or rather the book attributed to him, is very
short, but his ideas were developed by his disciple Chuang-Tze,
who is more interesting than his master. The philosophy which
both advocated was one of freedom. They thought ill of government,
and of all interferences with Nature. They complained of the hurry
of modern life, which they contrasted with the calm existence
of those whom they called "the pure men of old." There is a flavour
of mysticism in the doctrine of the Tao, because in spite of the
multiplicity of living things the Tao is in some sense one, so
that if all live according to it there will be no strife in the
world. But both sages have already the Chinese characteristics
of humour, restraint, and under-statement. Their humour is illustrated
by Chuang-Tze's account of Po-Lo who "understood the management
of horses," and trained them till five out of every ten died.[95]
Their restraint and under-statement are evident when they are
compared with Western mystics. Both characteristics belong to
all Chinese literature and art, and to the conversation of cultivated
Chinese in the present day. All classes in China are fond of laughter,
and never miss a chance of a joke. In the educated classes, the
humour is sly and delicate, so that Europeans often fail to see
it, which adds to the enjoyment of the Chinese. Their habit of
under-statement is remarkable. I met one day in Peking a middle-aged
man who told me he was academically interested in the theory of
politics; being new to the country, I took his statement at its
face value, but I afterwards discovered that he had been governor
of a province, and had been for many years a very prominent politician.
In Chinese poetry there is an apparent absence of passion which
is due to the same practice of under-statement. They consider
that a wise man should always remain calm, and though they have
their passionate moments (being in fact a very excitable race),
they do not wish to perpetuate them in art, because they think
ill of them. Our romantic movement, which led people to like vehemence,
has, so far as I know, no analogue in their literature. Their
old music, some of which is very beautiful, makes so little noise
that one can only just hear it. In art they aim at being exquisite,
and in life at being reasonable. There is no admiration for the
ruthless strong man, or for the unrestrained expression of passion.
After the more blatant life of the West, one misses at first all
the effects at which they are aiming; but gradually the beauty
and dignity of their existence become visible, so that the foreigners
who have lived longest in China are those who love the Chinese
best.</p>

<p>The Taoists, though they survive as magicians, were entirely
ousted from the favour of the educated classes by Confucianism.
I must confess that I am unable to appreciate the merits of Confucius.
His writings are largely occupied with trivial points of etiquette,
and his main concern is to teach people how to behave correctly
on various occasions. When one compares him, however, with the
traditional religious teachers of some other ages and races, one
must admit that he has great merits, even if they are mainly negative.
His system, as developed by his followers, is one of pure ethics,
without religious dogma; it has not given rise to a powerful priesthood,
and it has not led to persecution. It certainly has succeeded
in producing a whole nation possessed of exquisite manners and
perfect courtesy. Nor is Chinese courtesy merely conventional;
it is quite as reliable in situations for which no precedent has
been provided. And it is not confined to one class; it exists
even in the humblest coolie. It is humiliating to watch the brutal
insolence of white men received by the Chinese with a quiet dignity
which cannot demean itself to answer rudeness with rudeness. Europeans
often regard this as weakness, but it is really strength, the
strength by which the Chinese have hitherto conquered all their
conquerors.</p>

<p>There is one, and only one, important foreign element in the
traditional civilization of China, and that is Buddhism. Buddhism
came to China from India in the early centuries of the Christian
era, and acquired a definite place in the religion of the country.
We, with the intolerant outlook which we have taken over from
the Jews, imagine that if a man adopts one religion he cannot
adopt another. The dogmas of Christianity and Mohammedanism, in
their orthodox forms, are so framed that no man can accept both.
But in China this incompatibility does not exist; a man may be
both a Buddhist and a Confucian, because nothing in either is
incompatible with the other. In Japan, similarly, most people
are both Buddhists and Shintoists. Nevertheless there is a temperamental
difference between Buddhism and Confucianism, which will cause
any individual to lay stress on one or other even if he accepts
both. Buddhism is a religion in the sense in which we understand
the word. It has mystic doctrines and a way of salvation and a
future life. It has a message to the world intended to cure the
despair which it regards as natural to those who have no religious
faith. It assumes an instinctive pessimism only to be cured by
some gospel. Confucianism has nothing of all this. It assumes
people fundamentally at peace with the world, wanting only instruction
as to how to live, not encouragement to live at all. And its ethical
instruction is not based upon any metaphysical or religious dogma;
it is purely mundane. The result of the co-existence of these
two religions in China has been that the more religious and contemplative
natures turned to Buddhism, while the active administrative type
was content with Confucianism, which was always the official teaching,
in which candidates for the civil service were examined. The result
is that for many ages the Government of China has been in the
hands of literary sceptics, whose administration has been lacking
in those qualities of energy and destructiveness which Western
nations demand of their rulers. In fact, they have conformed very
closely to the maxims of Chuang-Tze. The result has been that
the population has been happy except where civil war brought misery;
that subject nations have been allowed autonomy; and that foreign
nations have had no need to fear China, in spite of its immense
population and resources.</p>

<p>Comparing the civilization of China with that of Europe, one
finds in China most of what was to be found in Greece, but nothing
of the other two elements of our civilization, namely Judaism
and science. China is practically destitute of religion, not only
in the upper classes, but throughout the population. There is
a very definite ethical code, but it is not fierce or persecuting,
and does not contain the notion "sin." Except quite recently,
through European influence, there has been no science and no industrialism.</p>

<p>What will be the outcome of the contact of this ancient civilization
with the West? I am not thinking of the political or economic
outcome, but of the effect on the Chinese mental outlook. It is
difficult to dissociate the two questions altogether, because
of course the cultural contact with the West must be affected
by the nature of the political and economic contact. Nevertheless,
I wish to consider the cultural question as far as I can in isolation.</p>

<p>There is, in China, a great eagerness to acquire Western learning,
not simply in order to acquire national strength and be able to
resist Western aggression, but because a very large number of
people consider learning a good thing in itself. It is traditional
in China to place a high value on knowledge, but in old days the
knowledge sought was only of the classical literature. Nowadays
it is generally realized that Western knowledge is more useful.
Many students go every year to universities in Europe, and still
more to America, to learn science or economics or law or political
theory. These men, when they return to China, mostly become teachers
or civil servants or journalists or politicians. They are rapidly
modernizing the Chinese outlook, especially in the educated classes.</p>

<p>The traditional civilization of China had become unprogressive,
and had ceased to produce much of value in the way of art and
literature. This was not due, I think, to any decadence in the
race, but merely to lack of new material. The influx of Western
knowledge provides just the stimulus that was needed. Chinese
students are able and extraordinarily keen. Higher education suffers
from lack of funds and absence of libraries, but does not suffer
from any lack of the finest human material. Although Chinese civilization
has hitherto been deficient in science, it never contained anything
hostile to science, and therefore the spread of scientific knowledge
encounters no such obstacles as the Church put in its way in Europe.
I have no doubt that if the Chinese could get a stable government
and sufficient funds, they would, within the next thirty years,
begin to produce remarkable work in science. It is quite likely
that they might outstrip us, because they come with fresh zest
and with all the ardour of a renaissance. In fact, the enthusiasm
for learning in Young China reminds one constantly of the renaissance
spirit in fifteenth-century Italy.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable, as distinguishing the Chinese from the
Japanese, that the things they wish to learn from us are not those
that bring wealth or military strength, but rather those that
have either an ethical and social value, or a purely intellectual
interest. They are not by any means uncritical of our civilization.
Some of them told me that they were less critical before 1914,
but that the war made them think there must be imperfections in
the Western manner of life. The habit of looking to the West for
wisdom was, however, very strong, and some of the younger ones
thought that Bolshevism could give what they were looking for.
That hope also must be suffering disappointment, and before long
they will realize that they must work out their own salvation
by means of a new synthesis. The Japanese adopted our faults and
kept their own, but it is possible to hope that the Chinese will
make the opposite selection, keeping their own merits and adopting
ours.</p>

<p>The distinctive merit of our civilization, I should say, is the
scientific method; the distinctive merit of the Chinese is a just
conception of the ends of life. It is these two that one must
hope to see gradually uniting.</p>

<p>Lao-Tze describes the operation of Tao as "production without
possession, action without self-assertion, development without
domination." I think one could derive from these words a conception
of the ends of life as reflective Chinese see them, and it must
be admitted that they are very different from the ends which most
white men set before themselves. Possession, self-assertion, domination,
are eagerly sought, both nationally and individually. They have
been erected into a philosophy by Nietzsche, and Nietzsche's disciples
are not confined to Germany.</p>

<p>But, it will be said, you have been comparing Western practice
with Chinese theory; if you had compared Western theory with Chinese
practice, the balance would have come out quite differently. There
is, of course, a great deal of truth in this. Possession, which
is one of the three things that Lao-Tze wishes us to forego, is
certainly dear to the heart of the average Chinaman. As a race,
they are tenacious of money&mdash;not perhaps more so than the French,
but certainly more than the English or the Americans. Their politics
are corrupt, and their powerful men make money in disgraceful
ways. All this it is impossible to deny.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as regards the other two evils, self-assertion
and domination, I notice a definite superiority to ourselves in
Chinese practice. There is much less desire than among the white
races to tyrannize over other people. The weakness of China internationally
is quite as much due to this virtue as to the vices of corruption
and so on which are usually assigned as the sole reason. If any
nation in the world could ever be "too proud to fight," that nation
would be China. The natural Chinese attitude is one of tolerance
and friendliness, showing courtesy and expecting it in return.
If the Chinese chose, they could be the most powerful nation in
the world. But they only desire freedom, not domination. It is
not improbable that other nations may compel them to fight for
their freedom, and if so, they may lose their virtues and acquire
a taste for empire. But at present, though they have been an imperial
race for 2,000 years, their love of empire is extraordinarily
slight.</p>

<p>Although there have been many wars in China, the natural outlook
of the Chinese is very pacifistic. I do not know of any other
country where a poet would have chosen, as Po-Chui did in one
of the poems translated by Mr. Waley, called by him <em>The Old
Man with the Broken Arm</em>, to make a hero of a recruit who
maimed himself to escape military service. Their pacifism is rooted
in their contemplative outlook, and in the fact that they do not
desire to change whatever they see. They take a pleasure&mdash;as their
pictures show&mdash;in observing characteristic manifestations of different
kinds of life, and they have no wish to reduce everything to a
preconceived pattern. They have not the ideal of progress which
dominates the Western nations, and affords a rationalization of
our active impulses. Progress is, of course, a very modern ideal
even with us; it is part of what we owe to science and industrialism.
The cultivated conservative Chinese of the present day talk exactly
as their earliest sages write. If one points out to them that
this shows how little progress there has been, they will say:
"Why seek progress when you already enjoy what is excellent?"
At first, this point of view seems to a European unduly indolent;
but gradually doubts as to one's own wisdom grow up, and one begins
to think that much of what we call progress is only restless change,
bringing us no nearer to any desirable goal.</p>

<p>It is interesting to contrast what the Chinese have sought in
the West with what the West has sought in China. The Chinese in
the West seek knowledge, in the hope&mdash;which I fear is usually
vain&mdash;that knowledge may prove a gateway to wisdom. White men
have gone to China with three motives: to fight, to make money,
and to convert the Chinese to our religion. The last of these
motives has the merit of being idealistic, and has inspired many
heroic lives. But the soldier, the merchant, and the missionary
are alike concerned to stamp our civilization upon the world;
they are all three, in a certain sense, pugnacious. The Chinese
have no wish to convert us to Confucianism; they say "religions
are many, but reason is one," and with that they are content to
let us go our way. They are good merchants, but their methods
are quite different from those of European merchants in China,
who are perpetually seeking concessions, monopolies, railways,
and mines, and endeavouring to get their claims supported by gunboats.
The Chinese are not, as a rule, good soldiers, because the causes
for which they are asked to fight are not worth fighting for,
and they know it. But that is only a proof of their reasonableness.</p>

<p>I think the tolerance of the Chinese is in excess of anything
that Europeans can imagine from their experience at home. We imagine
ourselves tolerant, because we are more so than our ancestors.
But we still practise political and social persecution, and what
is more, we are firmly persuaded that our civilization and our
way of life are immeasurably better than any other, so that when
we come across a nation like the Chinese, we are convinced that
the kindest thing we can do to them is to make them like ourselves.
I believe this to be a profound mistake. It seemed to me that
the average Chinaman, even if he is miserably poor, is happier
than the average Englishman, and is happier because the nation
is built upon a more humane and civilized outlook than our own.
Restlessness and pugnacity not only cause obvious evils, but fill
our lives with discontent, incapacitate us for the enjoyment of
beauty, and make us almost incapable of the contemplative virtues.
In this respect we have grown rapidly worse during the last hundred
years. I do not deny that the Chinese go too far in the other
direction; but for that very reason I think contact between East
and West is likely to be fruitful to both parties. They may learn
from us the indispensable minimum of practical efficiency, and
we may learn from them something of that contemplative wisdom
which has enabled them to persist while all the other nations
of antiquity have perished.</p>

<p>When I went to China, I went to teach; but every day that I stayed
I thought less of what I had to teach them and more of what I
had to learn from them. Among Europeans who had lived a long time
in China, I found this attitude not uncommon; but among those
whose stay is short, or who go only to make money, it is sadly
rare. It is rare because the Chinese do not excel in the things
we really value&mdash;military prowess and industrial enterprise. But
those who value wisdom or beauty, or even the simple enjoyment
of life, will find more of these things in China than in the distracted
and turbulent West, and will be happy to live where such things
are valued. I wish I could hope that China, in return for our
scientific knowledge, may give us something of her large tolerance
and contemplative peace of mind.</p>
