<p> A Revolutionary war raises many strange characters out of the
obscurity which is the common lot of humble lives in an undisturbed
state of society.</p>

<p>Certain individualities grow into fame through their vices and
their virtues, or simply by their actions, which may have a temporary
importance; and then they become forgotten. The names of a few
leaders alone survive the end of armed strife and are further
preserved in history; so that, vanishing from men’s active memories,
they still exist in books.</p>

<p>The name of General Santierra attained that cold, paper-and-ink
immortality. He was a South American of good family, and the books
published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators
of that continent from the oppressive rule of Spain.</p>

<p>That long contest, waged for independence on one side and for
dominion on the other, developed, in the course of years and the
vicissitudes of changing fortune, the fierceness and inhumanity
of a struggle for life. All feelings of pity and compassion disappeared
in the growth of political hatred. And, as is usual in war, the
mass of the people, who had the least to gain by the issue, suffered
most in their obscure persons and their humble fortunes.</p>

<p>General Santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot
army raised and commanded by the famous San Martin, afterwards
conqueror of Lima and liberator of Peru. A great battle had just
been fought on the banks of the river Bio-Bio. Amongst the prisoners
made upon the routed Royalist troops there was a soldier called
Gaspar Ruiz. His powerful build and his big head rendered him
remarkable amongst his fellow-captives. The personality of the
man was unmistakable. Some months before, he had been missed from
the ranks of Republican troops after one of the many skirmishes
which preceded the great battle. And now, having been captured
arms in hand amongst Royalists, he could expect no other fate
but to be shot as a deserter.</p>

<p>Gaspar Ruiz, however, was not a deserter; his mind was hardly
active enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages
or perils of treachery. Why should he change sides? He had really
been made a prisoner, had suffered ill-usage and many privations.
Neither side showed tenderness to its adversaries. There came
a day when he was ordered, together with some other captured rebels,
to march in the front rank of the Royal troops. A musket, had
been thrust into his hands. He had taken it. He had marched. He
did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar atrocity
for refusing to march. He did not understand heroism, but it was
his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity.
Meantime he had gone on loading and firing, from fear of having
his brains blown out, at the first sign of unwillingness, by some
non-commissioned officer of the King of Spain. He tried to set
forth these elementary considerations before the sergeant of the
guard set over him and some twenty other such deserters, who had
been condemned summarily to be shot.</p>

<p>It was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries
which command the road-stead of Valparaiso. The officer who had
identified him had gone on without listening to his protestations.
His doom was sealed; his hands were tied very tightly together
behind his back; his body was sore all over from the many blows
with sticks and butts of muskets which had hurried him along on
the painful road from the place of his capture to the gate of
the fort. This was the only kind of systematic attention the prisoners
had received from their escort during a four days’ journey across
a scantily watered tract of country. At the crossings of rare
streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping
hurriedly like dogs. In the evening a few scraps of meat were
thrown amongst them as they dropped down dead-beat upon the stony
ground of the halting-place.</p>

<p>As he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning,
after having been driven hard all night, Gaspar Ruiz’s throat
was parched, and his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth.</p>

<p>And Gaspar Ruiz, besides being very thirsty, was stirred by a
feeling of sluggish anger, which he could not very well express,
as though the vigour of his spirit were by no means equal to the
strength of his body.</p>

<p>The other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their
heads, looking obstinately on the ground. But Gaspar Ruiz kept
on repeating: "What should I desert for to the Royalists? Why
should I desert? Tell me, Estaban!"</p>

<p>He addressed himself to the sergeant, who happened to belong
to the same part of the country as himself. But the sergeant,
after shrugging his meagre shoulders once, paid no further attention
to the deep murmuring voice at his back. It was indeed strange
that Gaspar Ruiz should desert. His people were in too humble
a station to feel much the disadvantages of any form of government.
There was no reason why Gaspar Ruiz should wish to uphold in his
own person the rule of the King of Spain. Neither had he been
anxious to exert himself for its subversion. He had joined the
side of Independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner.
A band of patriots appeared one morning early, surrounding his
father’s ranche, spearing the watch-dogs and hamstringing a fat
cow all in the twinkling of an eye, to the cries of "Viva La Libertad!"
Their officer discoursed of Liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence
after a long and refreshing sleep. When they left in the evening,
taking with them some of Ruiz, the father’s, best horses to replace
their own lamed animals, Gaspar Ruiz went away with them, having
been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent officer.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards a detachment of Royalist troops, coming to
pacify the district, burnt the ranche, carried off the remaining
horses and cattle, and having thus deprived the old people of
all their worldly possessions, left them sitting under a bush
in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of life.</p>
