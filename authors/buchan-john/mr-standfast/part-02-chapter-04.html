<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Ten days later the porter Joseph Zimmer of Arosa, clad in the
tough and shapeless trousers of his class, but sporting an old
velveteen shooting-coat bequeathed to him by a former German master—speaking
the guttural tongue of the Grisons, and with all his belongings
in one massive rucksack, came out of the little station of St
Anton and blinked in the frosty sunshine. He looked down upon
the little old village beside its icebound lake, but his business
was with the new village of hotels and villas which had sprung
up in the last ten years south of the station. He made some halting
inquiries of the station people, and a cab-driver outside finally
directed him to the place he sought—the cottage of the Widow Summermatter,
where resided an English <em>interné</em>, one Peter Pienaar.</p>

<p>The porter Joseph Zimmer had had a long and roundabout journey.
A fortnight before he had worn the uniform of a British major-general.
As such he had been the inmate of an expensive Paris hotel, till
one morning, in grey tweed clothes and with a limp, he had taken
the Paris-Mediterranean Express with a ticket for an officers’
convalescent home at Cannes. Thereafter he had declined in the
social scale. At Dijon he had been still an Englishman, but at
Pontarlier he had become an American bagman of Swiss parentage,
returning to wind up his father’s estate. At Berne he limped excessively,
and at Zurich, at a little back-street hotel, he became frankly
the peasant. For he met a friend there from whom he acquired clothes
with that odd rank smell, far stronger than Harris tweed, which
marks the raiment of most Swiss guides and all Swiss porters.
He also acquired a new name and an old aunt, who a little later
received him with open arms and explained to her friends that
he was her brother’s son from Arosa who three winters ago had
hurt his leg wood-cutting and had been discharged from the levy.</p>

<p>A kindly Swiss gentleman, as it chanced, had heard of the deserving
Joseph and interested himself to find him employment. The said
philanthropist made a hobby of the French and British prisoners
returned from Germany, and had in mind an officer, a crabbed South
African with a bad leg, who needed a servant. He was, it seemed,
an ill-tempered old fellow who had to be billeted alone, and since
he could speak German, he would be happier with a Swiss native.
Joseph haggled somewhat over the wages, but on his aunt’s advice
he accepted the job, and, with a very complete set of papers and
a store of ready-made reminiscences (it took him some time to
swot up the names of the peaks and passes he had traversed) set
out for St Anton, having dispatched beforehand a monstrously ill-spelt
letter announcing his coming. He could barely read and write,
but he was good at maps, which he had studied carefully, and he
noticed with satisfaction that the valley of St Anton gave easy
access to Italy.</p>

<p>As he journeyed south the reflections of that porter would have
surprised his fellow travellers in the stuffy third-class carriage.
He was thinking of a conversation he had had some days before
in a café at Dijon with a young Englishman bound for Modane....</p>

<p>We had bumped up against each other by chance in that strange
flitting when all went to different places at different times,
asking nothing of each other’s business. Wake had greeted me rather
shamefacedly and had proposed dinner together.</p>

<p>I am not good at receiving apologies, and Wake’s embarrassed
me more than they embarrassed him. "I’m a bit of a cad sometimes,"
he said. "You know I’m a better fellow than I sounded that night,
Hannay."</p>

<p>I mumbled something about not talking rot—the conventional phrase.
What worried me was that the man was suffering. You could see
it in his eyes. But that evening I got nearer Wake than ever before,
and he and I became true friends, for he laid bare his soul before
me. That was his trouble, that he could lay bare his soul, for
ordinary healthy folk don’t analyse their feelings. Wake did,
and I think it brought him relief.</p>

<p>"Don’t think I was ever your rival. I would no more have proposed
to Mary than I would have married one of her aunts. She was so
sure of herself, so happy in her single-heartedness that she terrified
me. My type of man is not meant for marriage, for women must be
in the centre of life, and we must always be standing aside and
looking on. It is a damnable thing to be left-handed."</p>

<p>"The trouble about you, my dear chap," I said, "is that you’re
too hard to please."</p>

<p>"That’s one way of putting it. I should put it more harshly.
I hate more than I love. All we humanitarians and pacifists have
hatred as our mainspring. Odd, isn’t it, for people who preach
brotherly love? But it’s the truth. We’re full of hate towards
everything that doesn’t square in with our ideas, everything that
jars on our lady-like nerves. Fellows like you are so in love
with their cause that they’ve no time or inclination to detest
what thwarts them. We’ve no cause—only negatives, and that means
hatred, and self-torture, and a beastly jaundice of soul."</p>

<p>Then I knew that Wake’s fault was not spiritual pride, as I had
diagnosed it at Biggleswick. The man was abased with humility.</p>

<p>"I see more than other people see," he went on, "and I feel more.
That’s the curse on me. You’re a happy man and you get things
done, because you only see one side of a case, one thing at a
time. How would you like it if a thousand strings were always
tugging at you, if you saw that every course meant the sacrifice
of lovely and desirable things, or even the shattering of what
you know to be unreplaceable? I’m the kind of stuff poets are
made of, but I haven’t the poet’s gift, so I stagger about the
world left-handed and game-legged.... Take the war. For me to
fight would be worse than for another man to run away. From the
bottom of my heart I believe that it needn’t have happened, and
that all war is a blistering iniquity. And yet belief has got
very little to do with virtue. I’m not as good a man as you, Hannay,
who have never thought out anything in your life. My time in the
Labour battalion taught me something. I knew that with all my
fine aspirations I wasn’t as true a man as fellows whose talk
was silly oaths and who didn’t care a tinker’s curse about their
soul."</p>

<p>I remember that I looked at him with a sudden understanding.
"I think I know you. You’re the sort of chap who won’t fight for
his country because he can’t be sure that she’s altogether in
the right. But he’d cheerfully die for her, right or wrong."</p>

<p>His face relaxed in a slow smile. "Queer that you should say
that. I think it’s pretty near the truth. Men like me aren’t afraid
to die, but they haven’t quite the courage to live. Every man
should be happy in a service like you, when he obeys orders. I
couldn’t get on in any service. I lack the bump of veneration.
I can’t swallow things merely because I’m told to. My sort are
always talking about ‘service’, but we haven’t the temperament
to serve. I’d give all I have to be an ordinary cog in the wheel,
instead of a confounded outsider who finds fault with the machinery....
Take a great violent high-handed fellow like you. You can sink
yourself till you become only a name and a number. I couldn’t
if I tried. I’m not sure if I want to either. I cling to the odds
and ends that are my own."</p>

<p>"I wish I had had you in my battalion a year ago," I said.</p>

<p>"No, you don’t. I’d only have been a nuisance. I’ve been a Fabian
since Oxford, but you’re a better socialist than me. I’m a rancid
individualist."</p>

<p>"But you must be feeling better about the war?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. I’m still lusting for the heads of the politicians
that made it and continue it. But I want to help my country. Honestly,
Hannay, I love the old place. More, I think, than I love myself,
and that’s saying a devilish lot. Short of fighting—which would
be the sin against the Holy Spirit for me—I’ll do my damnedest.
But you’ll remember I’m not used to team work. If I’m a jealous
player, beat me over the head."</p>

<p>His voice was almost wistful, and I liked him enormously.</p>

<p>"Blenkiron will see to that," I said. "We’re going to break you
to harness, Wake, and then you’ll be a happy man. You keep your
mind on the game and forget about yourself. That’s the cure for
jibbers."</p>

<p>As I journeyed to St Anton I thought a lot about that talk. He
was quite right about Mary, who would never have married him.
A man with such an angular soul couldn’t fit into another’s. And
then I thought that the chief thing about Mary was just her serene
certainty. Her eyes had that settled happy look that I remembered
to have seen only in one other human face, and that was Peter’s....
But I wondered if Peter’s eyes were still the same.</p>

<p>I found the cottage, a little wooden thing which had been left
perched on its knoll when the big hotels grew around it. It had
a fence in front, but behind it was open to the hillside. At the
gate stood a bent old woman with a face like a pippin. My make-up
must have been good, for she accepted me before I introduced myself.</p>

<p>"God be thanked you are come," she cried. "The poor lieutenant
needed a man to keep him company. He sleeps now, as he does always
in the afternoon, for his leg wearies him in the night.... But
he is brave, like a soldier.... Come, I will show you the house,
for you two will be alone now."</p>

<p>Stepping softly she led me indoors, pointing with a warning finger
to the little bedroom where Peter slept. I found a kitchen with
a big stove and a rough floor of planking, on which lay some badly
cured skins. Off it was a sort of pantry with a bed for me. She
showed me the pots and pans for cooking and the stores she had
laid in, and where to find water and fuel. "I will do the marketing
daily," she said, "and if you need me, my dwelling is half a mile
up the road beyond the new church. God be with you, young man,
and be kind to that wounded one."</p>

<p>When the Widow Summermatter had departed I sat down in Peter’s
arm-chair and took stock of the place. It was quiet and simple
and homely, and through the window came the gleam of snow on the
diamond hills. On the table beside the stove were Peter’s cherished
belongings—his buck-skin pouch and the pipe which Jannie Grobelaar
had carved for him in St Helena, an aluminium field match-box
I had given him, a cheap large-print Bible such as padres present
to well-disposed privates, and an old battered <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>
with gaudy pictures. The illustration at which I opened showed
Faithful going up to Heaven from the fire of Vanity Fair like
a woodcock that has just been flushed. Everything in the room
was exquisitely neat, and I knew that that was Peter and not the
Widow Summermatter. On a peg behind the door hung his much-mended
coat, and sticking out of a pocket I recognised a sheaf of my
own letters. In one corner stood something which I had forgotten
about—an invalid chair.</p>

<p>The sight of Peter’s plain little oddments made me feel solemn.
I wondered if his eyes would be like Mary’s now, for I could not
conceive what life would be for him as a cripple. Very silently
I opened the bedroom door and slipped inside.</p>

<p>He was lying on a camp bedstead with one of those striped Swiss
blankets pulled up round his ears, and he was asleep. It was the
old Peter beyond doubt. He had the hunter’s gift of breathing
evenly through his nose, and the white scar on the deep brown
of his forehead was what I had always remembered. The only change
since I last saw him was that he had let his beard grow again,
and it was grey.</p>

<p>As I looked at him the remembrance of all we had been through
together flooded back upon me, and I could have cried with joy
at being beside him. Women, bless their hearts! can never know
what long comradeship means to men; it is something not in their
lives—something that belongs only to that wild, undomesticated
world which we forswear when we find our mates. Even Mary understood
only a bit of it. I had just won her love, which was the greatest
thing that ever came my way, but if she had entered at that moment
I would scarcely have turned my head. I was back again in the
old life and was not thinking of the new.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw that Peter was awake and was looking at me.</p>

<p>"Dick," he said in a whisper, "Dick, my old friend."</p>

<p>The blanket was tossed off, and his long, lean arms were stretched
out to me. I gripped his hands, and for a little we did not speak.
Then I saw how woefully he had changed. His left leg had shrunk,
and from the knee down was like a pipe stem. His face, when awake,
showed the lines of hard suffering and he seemed shorter by half
a foot. But his eyes were still like Mary’s. Indeed they seemed
to be more patient and peaceful than in the days when he sat beside
me on the buck-waggon and peered over the hunting-veld.</p>

<p>I picked him up—he was no heavier than Mary—and carried him to
his chair beside the stove. Then I boiled water and made tea,
as we had so often done together.</p>

<p>"Peter, old man," I said, "we’re on trek again, and this is a
very snug little <em>rondavel</em>. We’ve had many good yarns,
but this is going to be the best. First of all, how about your
health?"</p>

<p>"Good, I’m a strong man again, but slow like a hippo cow. I have
been lonely sometimes, but that is all by now. Tell me of the
big battles."</p>

<p>But I was hungry for news of him and kept him to his own case.
He had no complaint of his treatment except that he did not like
Germans. The doctors at the hospital had been clever, he said,
and had done their best for him, but nerves and sinews and small
bones had been so wrecked that they could not mend his leg, and
Peter had all the Boer’s dislike of amputation. One doctor had
been in Damaraland and talked to him of those baked sunny places
and made him homesick. But he returned always to his dislike of
Germans. He had seen them herding our soldiers like brute beasts,
and the commandant had a face like Stumm and a chin that stuck
out and wanted hitting. He made an exception for the great airman
Lensch, who had downed him.</p>

<p>"He is a white man, that one," he said. "He came to see me in
hospital and told me a lot of things. I think he made them treat
me well. He is a big man, Dick, who would make two of me, and
he has a round, merry face and pale eyes like Frickie Celliers
who could put a bullet through a pauw’s head at two hundred yards.
He said he was sorry I was lame, for he hoped to have more fights
with me. Some woman that tells fortunes had said that I would
be the end of him, but he reckoned she had got the thing the wrong
way on. I hope he will come through this war, for he is a good
man, though a German.... But the others! They are like the fool
in the Bible, fat and ugly in good fortune and proud and vicious
when their luck goes. They are not a people to be happy with."</p>

<p>Then he told me that to keep up his spirits he had amused himself
with playing a game. He had prided himself on being a Boer, and
spoken coldly of the British. He had also, I gathered, imparted
many things calculated to deceive. So he left Germany with good
marks, and in Switzerland had held himself aloof from the other
British wounded, on the advice of Blenkiron, who had met him as
soon as he crossed the frontier. I gathered it was Blenkiron who
had had him sent to St Anton, and in his time there, as a disgruntled
Boer, he had mixed a good deal with Germans. They had pumped him
about our air service, and Peter had told them many ingenious
lies and heard curious things in return.</p>

<p>"They are working hard, Dick," he said. "Never forget that. The
German is a stout enemy, and when we beat him with a machine he
sweats till he has invented a new one. They have great pilots,
but never so many good ones as we, and I do not think in ordinary
fighting they can ever beat us. But you must watch Lensch, for
I fear him. He has a new machine, I hear, with great engines and
a short wingspread, but the wings so cambered that he can climb
fast. That will be a surprise to spring upon us. You will say
that we’ll soon better it. So we shall, but if it was used at
a time when we were pushing hard it might make the little difference
that loses battles."</p>

<p>"You mean," I said, "that if we had a great attack ready and
had driven all the Boche planes back from our front, Lensch and
his circus might get over in spite of us and blow the gaff?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said solemnly. "Or if we were attacked, and had a weak
spot, Lensch might show the Germans where to get through. I do
not think we are going to attack for a long time; but I am pretty
sure that Germany is going to fling every man against us. That
is the talk of my friends, and it is not bluff."</p>

<p>That night I cooked our modest dinner, and we smoked our pipes
with the stove door open and the good smell of woodsmoke in our
nostrils. I told him of all my doings and of the Wild Birds and
Ivery and the job we were engaged on. Blenkiron’s instructions
were that we two should live humbly and keep our eyes and ears
open, for we were outside suspicion—the cantankerous lame Boer
and his loutish servant from Arosa. Somewhere in the place was
a rendezvous of our enemies, and thither came Chelius on his dark
errands.</p>

<p>Peter nodded his head sagely, "I think I have guessed the place.
The daughter of the old woman used to pull my chair sometimes
down to the village, and I have sat in cheap inns and talked to
servants. There is a fresh-water pan there, it is all covered
with snow now, and beside it there is a big house that they call
the Pink Chalet. I do not know much about it, except that rich
folk live in it, for I know the other houses and they are harmless.
Also the big hotels, which are too cold and public for strangers
to meet in."</p>

<p>I put Peter to bed, and it was a joy to me to look after him,
to give him his tonic and prepare the hot water bottle that comforted
his neuralgia. His behaviour was like a docile child’s, and he
never lapsed from his sunny temper, though I could see how his
leg gave him hell. They had tried massage for it and given it
up, and there was nothing for him but to endure till nature and
his tough constitution deadened the tortured nerves again. I shifted
my bed out of the pantry and slept in the room with him, and when
I woke in the night, as one does the first time in a strange place,
I could tell by his breathing that he was wakeful and suffering.</p>

<p>Next day a bath chair containing a grizzled cripple and pushed
by a limping peasant might have been seen descending the long
hill to the village. It was clear frosty weather which makes the
cheeks tingle, and I felt so full of beans that it was hard to
remember my game leg. The valley was shut in on the east by a
great mass of rocks and glaciers, belonging to a mountain whose
top could not be seen. But on the south, above the snowy fir-woods,
there was a most delicate lace-like peak with a point like a needle.
I looked at it with interest, for beyond it lay the valley which
led to the Staub pass, and beyond that was Italy—and Mary.</p>

<p>The old village of St Anton had one long, narrow street which
bent at right angles to a bridge which spanned the river flowing
from the lake. Thence the road climbed steeply, but at the other
end of the street it ran on the level by the water’s edge, lined
with gimcrack boarding-houses, now shuttered to the world, and
a few villas in patches of garden. At the far end, just before
it plunged into a pine-wood, a promontory jutted into the lake,
leaving a broad space between the road and the water. Here were
the grounds of a more considerable dwelling—snow-covered laurels
and rhododendrons with one or two bigger trees—and just on the
water-edge stood the house itself, called the Pink Chalet.</p>

<p>I wheeled Peter past the entrance on the crackling snow of the
highway. Seen through the gaps of the trees the front looked new,
but the back part seemed to be of some age, for I could see high
walls, broken by few windows, hanging over the water. The place
was no more a chalet than a donjon, but I suppose the name was
given in honour of a wooden gallery above the front door. The
whole thing was washed in an ugly pink. There were outhouses—garage
or stables among the trees—and at the entrance there were fairly
recent tracks of an automobile.</p>

<p>On our way back we had some very bad beer in a café and made
friends with the woman who kept it. Peter had to tell her his
story, and I trotted out my aunt in Zurich, and in the end we
heard her grievances. She was a true Swiss, angry at all the belligerents
who had spoiled her livelihood, hating Germany most but also fearing
her most. Coffee, tea, fuel, bread, even milk and cheese were
hard to get and cost a ransom. It would take the land years to
recover, and there would be no more tourists, for there was little
money left in the world. I dropped a question about the Pink Chalet,
and was told that it belonged to one Schweigler, a professor of
Berne, an old man who came sometimes for a few days in the summer.
It was often let, but not now. Asked if it was occupied, she remarked
that some friends of the Schweiglers—rich people from Basle—had
been there for the winter. "They come and go in great cars," she
said bitterly, "and they bring their food from the cities. They
spend no money in this poor place."</p>

<p>Presently Peter and I fell into a routine of life, as if we had
always kept house together. In the morning he went abroad in his
chair, in the afternoon I would hobble about on my own errands.
We sank into the background and took its colour, and a less conspicuous
pair never faced the eye of suspicion. Once a week a young Swiss
officer, whose business it was to look after British wounded,
paid us a hurried visit. I used to get letters from my aunt in
Zurich, sometimes with the postmark of Arosa, and now and then
these letters would contain curiously worded advice or instructions
from him whom my aunt called "the kind patron". Generally I was
told to be patient. Sometimes I had word about the health of "my
little cousin across the mountains". Once I was bidden expect
a friend of the patron’s, the wise doctor of whom he had often
spoken, but though after that I shadowed the Pink Chalet for two
days no doctor appeared.</p>

<p>My investigations were a barren business. I used to go down to
the village in the afternoon and sit in an out-of-the-way café,
talking slow German with peasants and hotel porters, but there
was little to learn. I knew all there was to hear about the Pink
Chalet, and that was nothing. A young man who ski-ed stayed for
three nights and spent his days on the alps above the fir-woods.
A party of four, including two women, was reported to have been
there for a night—all ramifications of the rich family of Basle.
I studied the house from the lake, which should have been nicely
swept into ice-rinks, but from lack of visitors was a heap of
blown snow. The high old walls of the back part were built straight
from the water’s edge. I remember I tried a short cut through
the grounds to the high-road and was given "Good afternoon’ by
a smiling German manservant. One way and another I gathered there
were a good many serving-men about the place—too many for the
infrequent guests. But beyond this I discovered nothing.</p>

<p>Not that I was bored, for I had always Peter to turn to. He was
thinking a lot about South Africa, and the thing he liked best
was to go over with me every detail of our old expeditions. They
belonged to a life which he could think about without pain, whereas
the war was too near and bitter for him. He liked to hobble out-of-doors
after the darkness came and look at his old friends, the stars.
He called them by the words they use on the veld, and the first
star of morning he called the <em>voorlooper</em>—the little boy
who inspans the oxen—a name I had not heard for twenty years.
Many a great yarn we spun in the long evenings, but I always went
to bed with a sore heart. The longing in his eyes was too urgent,
longing not for old days or far countries, but for the health
and strength which had once been his pride.</p>

<p>One night I told him about Mary.</p>

<p>"She will be a happy <em>mysie</em>," he said, "but you will
need to be very clever with her, for women are queer cattle and
you and I don’t know their ways. They tell me English women do
not cook and make clothes like our vrouws, so what will she find
to do? I doubt an idle woman will be like a mealie-fed horse."</p>

<p>It was no good explaining to him the kind of girl Mary was, for
that was a world entirely beyond his ken. But I could see that
he felt lonelier than ever at my news. So I told him of the house
I meant to have in England when the war was over—an old house
in a green hilly country, with fields that would carry four head
of cattle to the <em>morgen</em> and furrows of clear water, and
orchards of plums and apples. "And you will stay with us all the
time," I said. "You will have your own rooms and your own boy
to look after you, and you will help me to farm, and we will catch
fish together, and shoot the wild ducks when they come up from
the pans in the evening. I have found a better countryside than
the Houtbosch, where you and I planned to have a farm. It is a
blessed and happy place, England."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "You are a kind man, Dick, but your pretty
<em>mysie</em> won’t want an ugly old fellow like me hobbling
about her house.... I do not think I will go back to Africa, for
I should be sad there in the sun. I will find a little place in
England, and some day I will visit you, old friend."</p>

<p>That night his stoicism seemed for the first time to fail him.
He was silent for a long time and went early to bed, where I can
vouch for it he did not sleep. But he must have thought a lot
in the night time, for in the morning he had got himself in hand
and was as cheerful as a sandboy.</p>

<p>I watched his philosophy with amazement. It was far beyond anything
I could have compassed myself. He was so frail and so poor, for
he had never had anything in the world but his bodily fitness,
and he had lost that now. And remember, he had lost it after some
months of glittering happiness, for in the air he had found the
element for which he had been born. Sometimes he dropped a hint
of those days when he lived in the clouds and invented a new kind
of battle, and his voice always grew hoarse. I could see that
he ached with longing for their return. And yet he never had a
word of complaint. That was the ritual he had set himself, his
point of honour, and he faced the future with the same kind of
courage as that with which he had tackled a wild beast or Lensch
himself. Only it needed a far bigger brand of fortitude.</p>

<p>Another thing was that he had found religion. I doubt if that
is the right way to put it, for he had always had it. Men who
live in the wilds know they are in the hands of God. But his old
kind had been a tattered thing, more like heathen superstition,
though it had always kept him humble. But now he had taken to
reading the Bible and to thinking in his lonely nights, and he
had got a creed of his own. I dare say it was crude enough, I
am sure it was unorthodox; but if the proof of religion is that
it gives a man a prop in bad days, then Peter’s was the real thing.
He used to ferret about in the Bible and the <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em>—they
were both equally inspired in his eyes—and find texts which he
interpreted in his own way to meet his case. He took everything
quite literally. What happened three thousand years ago in Palestine
might, for all he minded, have been going on next door. I used
to chaff him and tell him that he was like the Kaiser, very good
at fitting the Bible to his purpose, but his sincerity was so
complete that he only smiled. I remember one night, when he had
been thinking about his flying days, he found a passage in Thessalonians
about the dead rising to meet their Lord in the air, and that
cheered him a lot. Peter, I could see, had the notion that his
time here wouldn’t be very long, and he liked to think that when
he got his release he would find once more the old rapture.</p>

<p>Once, when I said something about his patience, he said he had
got to try to live up to Mr Standfast. He had fixed on that character
to follow, though he would have preferred Mr Valiant-for-Truth
if he had thought himself good enough. He used to talk about Mr
Standfast in his queer way as if he were a friend of us both,
like Blenkiron.... I tell you I was humbled out of all my pride
by the sight of Peter, so uncomplaining and gentle and wise. The
Almighty Himself couldn’t have made a prig out of him, and he
never would have thought of preaching. Only once did he give me
advice. I had always a liking for short cuts, and I was getting
a bit restive under the long inaction. One day when I expressed
my feelings on the matter, Peter upped and read from the <em>Pilgrim’s
Progress</em>: "Some also have wished that the next way to their
Father’s house were here, that they might be troubled no more
with either hills or mountains to go over, but the Way is the
Way, and there is an end."</p>

<p>All the same when we got into March and nothing happened I grew
pretty anxious. Blenkiron had said we were fighting against time,
and here were the weeks slipping away. His letters came occasionally,
always in the shape of communications from my aunt. One told me
that I would soon be out of a job, for Peter’s repatriation was
just about through, and he might get his movement order any day.
Another spoke of my little cousin over the hills, and said that
she hoped soon to be going to a place called Santa Chiara in the
Val Saluzzana. I got out the map in a hurry and measured the distance
from there to St Anton and pored over the two roads thither—the
short one by the Staub Pass and the long one by the Marjolana.
These letters made me think that things were nearing a climax,
but still no instructions came. I had nothing to report in my
own messages, I had discovered nothing in the Pink Chalet but
idle servants, I was not even sure if the Pink Chalet were not
a harmless villa, and I hadn’t come within a thousand miles of
finding Chelius. All my desire to imitate Peter’s stoicism didn’t
prevent me from getting occasionally rattled and despondent.</p>

<p>The one thing I could do was to keep fit, for I had a notion
I might soon want all my bodily strength. I had to keep up my
pretence of lameness in the daytime, so I used to take my exercise
at night. I would sleep in the afternoon, when Peter had his siesta,
and then about ten in the evening, after putting him to bed, I
would slip out-of-doors and go for a four or five hours’ tramp.
Wonderful were those midnight wanderings. I pushed up through
the snow-laden pines to the ridges where the snow lay in great
wreaths and scallops, till I stood on a crest with a frozen world
at my feet and above me a host of glittering stars. Once on a
night of full moon I reached the glacier at the valley head, scrambled
up the moraine to where the ice began, and peered fearfully into
the spectral crevasses. At such hours I had the earth to myself,
for there was not a sound except the slipping of a burden of snow
from the trees or the crack and rustle which reminded me that
a glacier was a moving river. The war seemed very far away, and
I felt the littleness of our human struggles, till I thought of
Peter turning from side to side to find ease in the cottage far
below me. Then I realised that the spirit of man was the greatest
thing in this spacious world.... I would get back about three
or four, have a bath in the water which had been warming in my
absence, and creep into bed, almost ashamed of having two sound
legs, when a better man a yard away had but one.</p>

<p>Oddly enough at these hours there seemed more life in the Pink
Chalet than by day. Once, tramping across the lake long after
midnight, I saw lights in the lake-front in windows which for
ordinary were blank and shuttered. Several times I cut across
the grounds, when the moon was dark. On one such occasion a great
car with no lights swept up the drive, and I heard low voices
at the door. Another time a man ran hastily past me, and entered
the house by a little door on the eastern side, which I had not
before noticed.... Slowly the conviction began to grow on me that
we were not wrong in marking down this place, that things went
on within it which it deeply concerned us to discover. But I was
puzzled to think of a way. I might butt inside, but for all I
knew it would be upsetting Blenkiron’s plans, for he had given
me no instructions about housebreaking. All this unsettled me
worse than ever. I began to lie awake planning some means of entrance....
I would be a peasant from the next valley who had twisted his
ankle.... I would go seeking an imaginary cousin among the servants....
I would start a fire in the place and have the doors flung open
to zealous neighbours....</p>

<p>And then suddenly I got instructions in a letter from Blenkiron.</p>

<p>It came inside a parcel of warm socks that arrived from my kind
aunt. But the letter for me was not from her. It was in Blenkiron’s
large sprawling hand and the style of it was all his own. He told
me that he had about finished his job. He had got his line on
Chelius, who was the bird he expected, and that bird would soon
wing its way southward across the mountains for the reason I knew
of.</p>

<p>"We’ve got an almighty move on," he wrote, "and please God you’re
going to hustle some in the next week. It’s going better than
I ever hoped." But something was still to be done. He had struck
a countryman, one Clarence Donne, a journalist of Kansas City,
whom he had taken into the business. Him he described as a "crackerjack"
and commended to my esteem. He was coming to St Anton, for there
was a game afoot at the Pink Chalet, which he would give me news
of. I was to meet him next evening at nine-fifteen at the little
door in the east end of the house. "For the love of Mike, Dick,"
he concluded, "be on time and do everything Clarence tells you
as if he was me. It’s a mighty complex affair, but you and he
have sand enough to pull through. Don’t worry about your little
cousin. She’s safe and out of the job now."</p>

<p>My first feeling was one of immense relief, especially at the
last words. I read the letter a dozen times to make sure I had
its meaning. A flash of suspicion crossed my mind that it might
be a fake, principally because there was no mention of Peter,
who had figured large in the other missives. But why should Peter
be mentioned when he wasn’t on in this piece? The signature convinced
me. Ordinarily Blenkiron signed himself in full with a fine commercial
flourish. But when I was at the Front he had got into the habit
of making a kind of hieroglyphic of his surname to me and sticking
<em>J.S. </em>after it in a bracket. That was how this letter
was signed, and it was sure proof it was all right.</p>

<p>I spent that day and the next in wild spirits. Peter spotted
what was on, though I did not tell him for fear of making him
envious. I had to be extra kind to him, for I could see that he
ached to have a hand in the business. Indeed he asked shyly if
I couldn’t fit him in, and I had to lie about it and say it was
only another of my aimless circumnavigations of the Pink Chalet.</p>

<p>"Try and find something where I can help," he pleaded. "I’m pretty
strong still, though I’m lame, and I can shoot a bit."</p>

<p>I declared that he would be used in time, that Blenkiron had
promised he would be used, but for the life of me I couldn’t see
how.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock on the evening appointed I was on the lake opposite
the house, close in under the shore, making my way to the rendezvous.
It was a coal-black night, for though the air was clear the stars
were shining with little light, and the moon had not yet risen.
With a premonition that I might be long away from food, I had
brought some slabs of chocolate, and my pistol and torch were
in my pocket. It was bitter cold, but I had ceased to mind weather,
and I wore my one suit and no overcoat.</p>

<p>The house was like a tomb for silence. There was no crack of
light anywhere, and none of those smells of smoke and food which
proclaim habitation. It was an eerie job scrambling up the steep
bank east of the place, to where the flat of the garden started,
in a darkness so great that I had to grope my way like a blind
man.</p>

<p>I found the little door by feeling along the edge of the building.
Then I stepped into an adjacent clump of laurels to wait on my
companion. He was there before me.</p>

<p>"Say," I heard a rich Middle West voice whisper, "are you Joseph
Zimmer? I’m not shouting any names, but I guess you are the guy
I was told to meet here."</p>

<p>"Mr Donne?" I whispered back.</p>

<p>"The same," he replied. "Shake."</p>

<p>I gripped a gloved and mittened hand which drew me towards the
door.</p>
