<p><em>THE </em>doleful bride remained in bed all the next day,
prostrate under the continuing heat;—in fact, it was not until
a week had passed that she felt herself able to make the excursion
projected by the hopeful bridegroom; and when they finally did
set forth, in Dan’s light runabout, she began to suffer before
they reached the gates of the carriage driveway.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she said. "Is it going to be bumpy like this all
the way? It hurts my back."</p>

<p>Dan apologized. "I’m sorry I didn’t have those holes in the drive
filled up; I’ll do it myself this evening. But here on the avenue,"
he said, as they turned north from the gates, "we’ll have this
fine cedar-block pavement for quite a good way."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she complained. "It’s worse on the cedar-block pavement
than it was in your driveway."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> a little teeny bit jolty," Dan admitted. "You
see this pavement’s been down over five years now, but it’s held
out mighty well when you consider the traffic that’s been over
it—mighty well! It’s been one of the finest pavements I ever saw
in any town."</p>

<p>She gave a little moan. "You talk as if what it <em>has</em>
been were a great help to us now. It <em>does</em> hurt my back,
Dan."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn’t goin’ to keep on like this," he assured her comfortingly.
"The contracts are already signed for a new pavement. Six months
from now this’ll all be as smooth as a billiard table."</p>

<p>"But we have to go over it to-<em>day</em>!"</p>

<p>"That’s why I thought the runabout would be pleasanter for you,"
he said. "Our old family carriage is more comfortable in some
ways, but it hasn’t got rubber tires. I hardly notice the bumps
myself with these tires."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> do!"</p>

<p>"Think what a great invention it is, though," he said cheerfully.
"Why, before long I shouldn’t wonder if you’d see almost everything
that rolls usin’ rubber tires, and a good many such light traps
as this with inflated ones like bicycles. If horseless carriages
ever amount to anything, they’ll get to usin’ inflated rubber
tires, too, most likely."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" Lena sighed. "Doesn’t this heat ever relent a
<em>little</em>?"</p>

<p>He assured her that it did; that the hot spell would soon be
over, and that she wouldn’t mind it when they reached the Addition,
which was on higher ground. "It’s always cool out at Ornaby,"
he said proudly. "The mean level’s twenty-eight feet higher than
it is in this part of the city; and I never saw the day when you
couldn’t find a breeze out there."</p>

<p>"Then hurry and get there! It must be a terribly long way. I
don’t see any higher ground ahead of us—nothing but this eternal
flatness and flatness and flatness! I don’t see how you people
stand it. I should think somebody would <em>build</em> a hill!"</p>

<p>He laughed and told her that Ornaby was almost a hill. "Practically,
it is," he said. "Anyhow it’s a sort of plateau—practically. You
see the mean level——"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she sighed; and for a time they jogged on in silence.</p>

<p>He drove with one hand, holding over her with the other a green
silk parasol, a performance not lacking in gallantry, nor altogether
without difficulty, for his young horse was lively, in spite of
the weather; yet it is doubtful if strangers, seeing the runabout
pass, would have guessed the occupants a bride and groom.</p>

<p>Beneath the broad white rim of Lena’s straw hat the pretty little
face was contorted with discontent; while her companion’s expression
showed a puzzled discouragement not customarily associated with
the expressions of bridegrooms. True, the discouragement passed
before long, but it came back again after a little more conversation.
Then it disappeared again, but returned when signs of capricious
weather were seen in the sky. For it is new knowledge to nobody
that the weather has an uneducated humour and will as soon play
the baboon with a bride and groom, or with a kind cripple on an
errand of mercy, as it will with the hardiest ruffian. But at
first Dan welcomed the hints of change in the southwest.</p>

<p>"By George!" he said, nodding across the vast flat cornfields
upon their left, for the runabout had now come into the open country.
"<em>There’s</em> good news, Lena."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Look over yonder. We’re goin’ to get rain, and Heaven knows
we need it! Look."</p>

<p>Along the southwest horizon of cornfields and distant groves
they saw a thickening nucleus of dark haze. Out of it, clouds
of robust sculpture were slowly rising, muttering faintly as they
rose, as if another planet approached and its giants grumbled,
being roused from sleep to begin the assault.</p>

<p>"By George, that’s great!" Dan exclaimed in high delight. "That’s
worth millions of dollars to the farmers, Lena."</p>

<p>But Lena was as far as possible from sharing his enthusiasm.
"I believe it’s going to be a thunderstorm. Turn back. I hate
thunderstorms. I’m afraid of them."</p>

<p>"Why, they won’t hurt you, Lena."</p>

<p>"They frighten me and they do kill people. Please turn back."</p>

<p>"But we’re almost there, dear. I think the rain’ll hold off,
probably, but if it doesn’t we’d be more likely to get wet goin’
all the way back home than if we went ahead. I’ve got a tool shed
out there we could wait under."</p>

<p>"A tool shed? With all the tools <em>in</em> it? That’s just
where the lightning would strike first!"</p>

<p>Dan laughed and tried to reassure her, but although they drove
on in the bright sunshine for a time, she became more and more
nervous. "It almost seems to me you don’t <em>want</em> to do
things I want you to. We should have turned back when I first
spoke of it."</p>

<p>"Look, dear," he said. "Just ahead of us there’s something you’re
goin’ to be mighty proud of some day. It’s Ornaby Addition, Lena!"</p>

<p>Before them the dirt road, grown with long grass between the
ruts, had been widened to the dimensions of a city street as it
passed between old forest groves of beech and elm, through which
other wide rough roads had recently been cut. Beyond the woods
were some open fields, where lines of stakes were driven in the
ground to outline—apparently in a mood of over-optimistic prophecy—some
scores of building lots and various broad avenues. But so far
as could be seen from the runabout, felled trees and wooden stakes
were all that proved Ornaby to be an Addition and not a farm,
though a few negroes were burning the remnants of a rail fence
in a field not far from the road. And what made the whole prospect
rather desolate was the malicious caprice of the weather;—the
very moment when Dan stopped the runabout and waved his hand in
a proud semicircle of display, the first of the robust clouds
passed over the sun and Ornaby lay threatened in a monstrous shadow.</p>

<p>"Look, Lena!" the exultant proprietor cried. "This is Ornaby!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" she said desolately. "I do wish you’d turned round when
I said. It’s going to thunder and lighten horribly, and I know
I’m going to be frightened to death."</p>

<p>Then, as a louder rumble sounded in the sky, she shivered, clutching
Dan’s arm. "I <em>know</em> that struck somewhere!"</p>

<p>"It might have struck somewhere in the next county," he laughed.</p>

<p>"What! Why, look at the sky right over us. I never saw anything
so awful."</p>

<p>Dan laughed again and patted her small, clutching hand soothingly.
"It’s just a pleasant little summer thundershower, Lena."</p>

<p>"Little!" she cried. "Do you call storms like this ‘little’ out
here?"</p>

<p>For, in truth, Dan’s reassuring word was not well supported by
the aspect of the sky. Above them hung what appeared to be a field
of inverted gray haystacks, while from westward ragged, vast draperies
advanced through a saffron light that suddenly lay upon all the
land. A snort of wind tore at the road, carrying dust high aloft;
then there was a curious silence throughout all the great space
of the saffron light, and some large raindrops fell in a casual
way, then stopped.</p>

<p>"You see?" said the cheery Dan. "That’s all we’ll get, likely
enough. I shouldn’t be surprised it’d clear up now."</p>

<p>"‘Clear up!’" Lena cried incredulously. "I do believe you’re
crazy! Oh, <em>heavens</em>!"</p>

<p>And the heavens she thus adjured appeared heartily inclined to
warrant her outcry. Satan fell from the sky in a demoniac swoop
of lightning, carrying darkness with him; wind and water struck
the runabout together; and Dan was fain to drive into the woods
beside the road, while Lena clung to him and wailed. He tied the
trembling horse to a tree, and got the bride and her wrecked parasol
under the inadequate shelter of the tool house he had mentioned,
but found little happiness there. A hinge had broken; the negroes
had carried the door away to repair it; the roof leaked everywhere
and was sonorous with the hail that fell presently with the heavy
rain. At every bedazzlement of the lightning Lena gasped, then
shrieked throughout the ensuing uproar, and before long whimpered
that she was freezing. In fact, her wet clothes, little more than
gauze, appeared to be dissolving upon her, while the air grew
cold with the hail.</p>

<p>Dan put his soggy coat about her, petted her, and piled wet sticks
together, saying that he would make a fire for her if he could.
Whereupon she wept and uttered a pathetic laughter. "Burn up with
the heat one minute," she said, through chattering teeth, "and
the next freeze to death if you can’t make a fire! What a place!"</p>

<p>Of course Dan defended his climate, but his argument was of as
little avail as were his attempts to build a fire with sodden
wood and drenched matches. Lena suffered from the cold as expressively
as she had from the heat, and forgetting that these changes in
temperature had not been unknown to her in her own native habitat
and elsewhere, she convinced herself perfectly that all of her
troubles were put upon her by "the West." Yet in this she was
not so unreasonable as might appear;—our sufferings from interior
disturbances are adept in disguising themselves as inflictions
from outside.</p>

<p>These troubles of hers were not alleviated by two unfortunate
remarks made by her young husband in the course of his efforts
to hearten her. After one of the numerous electrical outrages,
appalling in brilliancy and uproar, he said he was sorry he couldn’t
have taken her to the old Ornaby farmhouse for shelter; and when
Lena reproached him for not having thought of this sooner, he
explained too hastily that the house had been struck by lightning
and burned to the ground during a thunderstorm earlier in the
summer. After that, as she became almost hysterical, he straightway
went on to his second blunder. "But nobody was hurt," he said.
"Nobody at all, Lena. There wasn’t anybody in the house; and anyhow
I don’t believe the lightning’s really struck right near us during
this whole shower. Why, it’s nothin’ at all; I’ve seen storms
a thousand times worse than this. Only last summer I got caught
out on a little lake, north of here, in a canoe, and pretty near
a real tornado came up, with thunder and lightning that would
make this little racket to-day look like something you’d get from
a baby’s toy. We didn’t mind it; we just——"</p>

<p>"‘We?’ Who?"</p>

<p>"Martha Shelby was with me," the incautious Dan replied. "Why,
you ought to’ve seen how she behaved, Lena! <em>She</em> didn’t
mind it; she just laughed and kept on paddlin’ like a soldier.
I honestly think she enjoyed it. Now, why can’t you——"</p>

<p>"You hush!" Lena cried.</p>

<p>"But I only——"</p>

<p>"Haven’t I enough to bear? Be quiet!"</p>

<p>He obeyed, gazing out upon the tumultuous landscape, and wondering
sadly what made her so angry with him. Then, all at once, beyond
and through the mazes of tossing rain he seemed to see, however
vaguely, the new Martha he had recognized in that queer night
after his homecoming; and the recollection of their strange moment
together brought him another not unlike it now. Something mystic
operated here; he felt again that same enrichment, charged with
an indefinite regret; and though the moment was no more than a
moment, passing quickly, it comforted him a little. "There! Don’t
worry!" Martha seemed to say to him gently. So he said it to himself
and felt in better spirits.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" Lena wept, huddling in a corner of the shed. "How
this horrible old world <em>does</em> make us pay for not knowing
what to do!" And when he turned to try again to soothe her, she
shrank but farther away from him and bade him let her alone.</p>

<p>"But it’ll be all cleared up, half an hour from now," he said.
"You’ll be warm as toast as soon as the sun comes out again, and
then we’ll go over the whole Addition and see what’s what, Lena!"</p>

<p>The first half of this prediction was amply fulfilled; Lena was
indeed warm soon after the sun reappeared; but they did not inspect
the Addition further. They went home, and a few days later Lena
wrote an account of the expedition in a letter to her brother
George. Not altogether happy when she wrote, she was unable to
refrain from a little natural exaggeration.</p>

You said to me once you’d like to come here to live. Read Martin<br/>
Chuzzlewit again before you do. "<em>Eden!</em>" That’s what the famous<br/>
Ornaby Addition looks like! It isn’t swampy, but that’s all the<br/>
difference I could see. We drove miles in the heat and choking<br/>
dust and there wasn’t anything to see when we got there! Just<br/>
absolutely nothing! People had been digging around in spots and<br/>
cutting a lot of trees down and after a cyclone and cloudburst<br/>
that came up while we were there he pointed out a post sticking<br/>
out of the ground and showed the greatest pride because it had<br/>
"47th St." painted on it! This was when we were driving out of<br/>
the woods. He wanted to poke all over the dreary place, looking<br/>
at other posts and stumps of trees, but I couldn’t stand any<br/>
more of it.

</p>
<p>
We had the most horrible storm I was ever out in, and it hailed<br/>
so that after being ill in bed for a week with the ghastly heat,<br/>
it got so cold I almost died, and then as soon as the cyclone<br/>
was over it got hot again—it isn’t like ordinary heat; it gets<br/>
hot with a sticky heaviness I can’t express and the thermometer<br/>
must stay up over 100 even at night—and as soon as we got home<br/>
I had to go to bed where I’ve been ever since—hence this<br/>
pencil—and I’ve just escaped pneumonia! And during the cyclone<br/>
when I was really ill with the nervous anguish lightning always<br/>
causes me, he began telling me how wonderfully a former<br/>
sweetheart of his behaved in a storm on a lake! It was his idea<br/>
of how to make me not mind it. Of course he only meant to cheer<br/>
me up—but <em>really</em>!

</p>
<p>
His father and mother aren’t bad, I must say. They’re quite like<br/>
him, good-looking and full of kindness; his mother is really<br/>
sweet and I like them both, though I’ll <em>never</em> get used to<br/>
hearing people talk with this terrible Western accent. To a<br/>
sensitive ear, it’s actual pain. The brother looks rather like<br/>
Dan, too; but he’s pompous in a dry way and affected. Reads<br/>
heavy things and seems to me a cold-hearted sort of prig, though<br/>
he’s always polite. The father and mother read, too. Their idea<br/>
is Carlyle and Emerson and Thoreau—<em>you</em> know the type of<br/>
mind—and Harlan (the brother) talks about that Englishman,<br/>
Shaw, who writes the queer plays. They say they have two<br/>
theatres open in winter, but of course there’s no music here<br/>
except something they brag about called the "April Festival,"<br/>
when there’s a week of imported orchestra and some singing.<br/>
Pleasant for <em>me</em>!—one week in the year!—though I suppose<br/>
<em>you’ll</em> think it’s all I should have.

</p>
<p>
They meant to be kind, but they gave me the most fearful<br/>
"reception." I never endured such a ghastly ordeal. The weather<br/>
was over 100 in the shade—and in crowded rooms, well, imagine<br/>
it! The people were dressed well enough—some of them were<br/>
rather queer, but so are some at home—but I wish you could have<br/>
seen the vehicles they drive in and their coachmen! Slouchy<br/>
darkies in old straw hats with long-tailed horses that get the<br/>
reins under their tails—and fringed surreys and family<br/>
carryalls, something like what you’d see out in the country<br/>
towns in Connecticut. They have phaetons and runabouts and a few<br/>
respectable traps, but I’ve seen just one good-looking victoria<br/>
since I came here. They don’t <em>like</em> smartness really. I believe<br/>
they think it’s effeminate!

</p>
<p>
The real head of the Oliphant family is an outrageous old hag,<br/>
Dan’s grandmother, who behaved terribly to me at my only meeting<br/>
with her—it will remain our only meeting! They’re all afraid of<br/>
her, and she has a lot of money. Queer—I understand he’s tried<br/>
to raise money for his Eden all over the town, but never asked<br/>
the terrible grandmother. She doesn’t believe in it, and I must<br/>
say she’s right about <em>that</em>! Rather!

</p>
<p>
How strange that any girl should do what I’ve done—and with my<br/>
eyes wide open! I did it, and yet I knew he didn’t understand<br/>
me. I ought to have known that he can <em>never</em> understand me,<br/>
that we don’t speak the same language and never will. I ought to<br/>
have realized what it means to know that I must live days,<br/>
weeks, months, <em>years</em> with a person who will never understand<br/>
anything whatever of my real self!

</p>
<p>
Yet I still care for him, and he is good. He does a thousand<br/>
little kind things for me that do not help me at all, and the<br/>
truth is most of them only irritate me. How odd it is that I<br/>
write to you about not being understood—you who are seldom kind<br/>
to me and often most unjust! Yet in a way I have always felt<br/>
that you do understand me a little—perhaps<br/>
unsympathetically—but at least you give me the luxury of being<br/>
<em>partly</em> understood.

</p>
<p>
Yes, I still care for him, but when I think of his awful Ornaby<br/>
thing I sometimes believe I have married a madman. It is nothing<br/>
<em>as I said</em>—hopeless—a devastated farm—and yet when he speaks<br/>
of it his eye lights up and he begins to walk about and gesture<br/>
and talk as if he actually saw houses and streets—and<br/>
shops—and thousands of people living there! If this isn’t<br/>
hallucination, I don’t know what hallucination means.

</p>
<p>
But since our excursion to the place I’ve almost cured him of<br/>
talking about it to <em>me</em>! I just can’t <em>stand</em> it! And what is<br/>
pleasant, I think he probably goes to talk about it to another<br/>
woman. Already! A perfectly enormous girl seven or eight feet<br/>
tall that he’d picked out to be my most intimate friend! Because<br/>
she’s been <em>his</em> most intimate friend, of course. But I suppose<br/>
all men are like <em>that</em>.

</p>
<p>
The heat did relax for a day or two—but it’s back again.<br/>
Sometimes I can’t believe I am actually in this<br/>
place—apparently for life—and I begin to hope that I’ll wake<br/>
up. I think even you would pity me sometimes, George.<br/>
