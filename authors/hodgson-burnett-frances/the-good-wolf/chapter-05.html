<p>TO find that your secret play ground has a robber's cave in it is
very startling. Barty stood up quickly and so did all the little
animals. At first Barty thought they might suddenly grow big, as
the Good Wolf had said they would if they saw a grown-up person.
But they did not. And if they had looked as small as kittens when
they were compared with a boy, they looked almost as small as mice
when they were compared with a long, thin robber. In fact, they
looked so tiny that Barty was afraid they would be hurt.
</p>
<p>"You had better run off into the forest as fast as you can before
he wriggles all the way out," he said quickly to the biggest little
lion.
</p><p>"No, we won't," the lion answered. "Not much. We are going to stop
and see the fun."
</p><p>Barty was afraid there might not be much fun, but when he saw the
lion slowly wink one eye at him and then saw another lion wink, and
a tiger and elephant wink too, until each animal in the circus had
winked, he began to see that something queer was going to happen.
But he could not imagine what it was going to be, because they all
huddled round his feet as if they were frightened, and even shook
and shivered.
</p><p>When the first robber had wriggled through the slit in the rock,
another one began to wriggle through, and then another and another
until there were no less than four robbers standing scowling at
him.
</p><p>"Hello!" said the biggest one, who was the captain, and had a
feather sticking in his hat and at least four pistols and six
swords hanging at his belt. "Here's a rich kid! He's just what we
were looking for. He's got the finest lot of mechanical toys I ever
saw in my life. Just look at those lions lashing their tails."
</p><p>That made Barty very angry. He felt as if his friends were being
insulted, and he strode forward and stood before them.
</p><p>"They are not toys!" he shouted out. "They are as real as you are!
They are my intimate friends. Go away!"
</p><p>The robbers burst out laughing.
</p><p>"They are not toys!" they said. "Real lions and tigers and
elephants half as big as kittens!"
</p><p>"If they are real, make the lion roar," said the robber captain,
grinning.
</p><p>"Oh do roar! Please roar!" said Barty to the lions. "Perhaps it
will frighten them."
</p><p>The biggest little lion winked at him again quite as if he were
having a joke, and he turned round and roared. But it was such a
little roar that Barty could not help knowing that it sounded like
a toy roar. And the robbers laughed louder than ever.
</p><p>"Good Wolf! Good Wolf!" he called out, and turned to look for him.
But there was no wolf there only a big, white furry dog, who looked
so innocent that he would frighten nobody.
</p><p>The captain slapped his knee.
</p><p>"Never since I was a robber have I seen such toys!" he cried. "We
can sell them to a king for their weight in gold. These two are
mine--and I will take the dog." And he picked up a little lion in
one hand and a little tiger in another.
</p><p>"You shall not touch them!" cried out Barty. "You shall not
touch----" But he stopped in the middle of saying it because the
something very queer was beginning to happen. It began that very
minute.
</p><p>The robber captain standing in the middle of the ring suddenly
turned pale. He looked so frightened that the other robbers did not
pick up anything, and stood and stared at him with their mouths
open.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he shouted out. "They are growing heavier. I
can't hold them. They are swelling! They are swelling!" and he
dropped both the lion and the tiger on the grass.
</p><p>And Barty saw that they were swelling. First they swelled until
they were as big as cats, then they swelled until they were as big
as dogs, then they were as big as pigs, then they were as big as
calves, and the next second they were as big as the hugest lion and
tiger in a menagerie, and the other lions, and tigers, and leopards
were as big as they were. The elephants and rhinoceroses and
hippopotamuses had to go outside the hedge to swell because there
wasn't room inside. But they put their big heads through the bushes
so that there was no mistake about their being there.
</p><p>You can just imagine how frightening it was to the robbers to find
themselves suddenly surrounded by roaring lions, and tigers, and
leopards, and huge trampling elephants and hippopotamuses instead
of tiny toy creatures they thought they could pick up and carry
away. If Barty had not known that all of them were his particular
friends he would have been frightened too. The robbers stood in the
midst of them all and howled with fright.
</p><p>"Call them off! Call them off!" they shouted to Barty because they
saw he was really the ring-master, "we will never do it again!
Never--never--never--never-r-r!"
</p><p>The captain tried to dart to the crack in the rock and wriggle
through, but the biggest lion put out a huge paw and dragged him
back by the seat of his trousers. He laid him flat on the grass and
put the huge paw on him and roared and roared.
</p><p>"I wouldn't kill him," cried Barty. "Perhaps he is sorry."
</p><p>"We are all sorry," the robbers sobbed.
</p><p>"We are sorrier than we ever were before in our lives!
</p><p>"I'll see that they are sorry enough," said the biggest lion, but
of course it was only Barty who understood what he said. The
robbers thought he was roaring and their knees knocked together.
</p><p>"What are you going to do to them?" asked Barty.
</p><p>"Watch!" answered the lion.
</p><p>He made a sign to his mate and two tigers, and each of them took up
a robber by his trousers and shook him as if he were a rat. Their
legs flew and their arms flew until they looked as if they would
fly to pieces, and they had not even the strength to yell with. Of
course it must have been most disagreeable and breath-taking, but
it served them perfectly right, for if you are a robber I should
like to know what you expect.
</p><p>When the shaking was over, and the lions and tigers laid the
robbers on the ground again, they did look queer. You see the bones
had nearly been shaken out of their bodies and the teeth out of
their mouths, and the hair had been shaken off their heads, every
bit of it, and they were quite bald.
</p><p>"Now," said the biggest lion to Barty, "you can tell them we are
going to give them a nice bit of a run through the forest; and if
they can get away from us this time they may as well give one hour
a day in the future to remembering that if they come near this cave
any more they won't get away again. They might do their remembering
from five to six every morning."
</p><p>So Barty told them, but when he had explained they were more
frightened than ever.
</p><p>"We never can get away from them," the robber captain said, wiping
his eyes on his sleeve. "We are too nervous to run, and our knees
keep knocking together. Ask him if he won't let us off easier than
that. There's not one of us who would think of coming back here.
Never--never--never!"
</p><p>He was in such a state that Barty actually began to feel sorry for
him. He turned and spoke to the lion.
</p><p>"How would it do," he inquired, "if they stopped being robbers and
were something nicer instead--bakers or hair dressers or pew
openers?"
</p><p>"We will! We will! We will!" shouted out the robbers.
</p><p>"I never wanted to be a robber," sobbed the captain. "I always
wanted to be a toy-shop man. I'm fond of toys.
</p><p>"And I wanted to be a confectioner," said another robber.
</p><p>"And I wanted to learn to play the harp!" cried another.
</p><p>"And it nearly broke my heart," said the fourth, "because I wasn't
allowed to be a gardener, and grow violets and sweet peas."
</p><p>"Well," said the lion to Barty, "tell them to go away and be
anything they like that is decent."
</p><p>"Wait a minute," said the Good Wolf, stepping forward. "Ask them if
they haven't had a great many adventures."
</p><p>"Yes, thousands of them," the captain answered when Barty asked
him. "We've been so many things; we've been pirates and gold-diggers,
and we've sailed the Spanish Main and things like that. We
could tell stories for years if you'd like to hear them, and if
your friends would not mind if we came back here occasionally--in
our best clothes--after we've quite stopped being robbers."
</p><p>"O, let them--et them!" Barty cried out joyfully.
</p><p>"That was what I was thinking of," said the Good Wolf. "There is
nothing more entertaining than a tame pirate or robber."
</p><p>"Tell them," said the lion, "that they may come back twice a week.
They shall be called 'The Combined Robbers and Pirates
Story-telling Club.' And we shall be here to listen and see that they
behave themselves."
</p><p>So it was agreed that the robbers should be allowed to go away and
begin working as hard as possible at not being robbers. And they
were so relieved that they were going to slip off as quietly as
they could, touching their hats meekly to everybody, but Barty
could not help shaking hands with the captain just to encourage him
a little.
</p><p>"I was frightened at first," he said, "but it has all turned out to
be so nice that I am very glad you came."
</p><p>When they were gone he sat down and fanned himself with his hat,
and the great big lions and tigers standing round him made him look
very little indeed.
</p><p>"Could you get small again, please?" he said. "I'm not a bit
frightened, but you are rather too big for my size."
</p><p>Every one of them began to un-swell that moment, and they got
smaller and smaller, and smaller and smaller, until they were just
the right size again--Snow Feast size--and they sat down in a ring
around Barty; and the circus lady crept out from under a leaf and
sat on his shoulder, and the clown crawled out of the bushes and
sat down on his foot again but not before he had turned twenty
somersaults.
</p><p>"Well," chuckled Barty, fanning away, "you did stand by me, didn't
you? And it has been a 'normous adventure. I shall so like to lie
awake and think of it. I know now why you all winked at me, and
said you were going to stay to see the fun."
</p><p>And they all laughed like anything--the Good Wolf more than all the
rest.
</p><p>In fact, they laughed and laughed and laughed until they could
scarcely stop themselves, and when at last it was time for Barty to
go home, and he said good-by to them, and the little elephants
threw up their trunks and trumpeted for him as if he were a king
going back to his palace, he ran down the path in the wood
chuckling to himself nearly all the way.
</p><p>"Oh!" he said, "what wonderful things happen in the deep forest
where things sing and things build nests and burrow in the earth,
and make little warm caves to live in."
</p><p><strong>THE END</strong>
