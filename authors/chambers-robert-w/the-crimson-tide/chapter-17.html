<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"Jim," said his mother, "Miss Dumont called you on the telephone
at an unusual hour last night. You had gone to your room, and
on the chance that you were asleep I did not speak to you."</p>

<p>That was all&mdash;sufficient explanation to discount any reproach
from her son incident on his comparing notes with the girl in
question. Also just enough in her action to convey to the girl
a polite hint that the Shotwell family was not at home to people
who telephoned at that unconventional hour.</p>

<p>On his way to business that morning, Jim telephoned to Palla,
but, learning she was not at home, let the matter rest.</p>

<p>In his sullen and resentful mood he no longer cared&mdash;or thought
he didn't, which resulted in the same thing&mdash;the accumulation
of increasing bitterness during a dull, rainy working day at the
office, and a dogged determination to keep clear of this woman
until effort to remain away from her was no longer necessary.</p>

<p>For the thing was utterly hopeless; he'd had enough. And in his
bruised heart and outraged common sense he was boyishly framing
an indictment of modern womanhood&mdash;lumping it all and cursing
it out&mdash;swearing internally at the entire enfranchised pack which
the war had set afoot and had licensed to swarm all over everything
and raise hell with the ancient and established order of things.</p>

<p>The stormy dark came early; and in this frame of mind when he
left the office he sulkily avoided the club.</p>

<p>He very rarely drank anything; but, not knowing what to do, he
drifted into the Biltmore bar.</p>

<p>He met a man or two he knew, but declined all suggestions for
the evening, turned up his overcoat collar, and started through
the hotel toward the northern exit.</p>

<p>And met Marya Lanois face to face.</p>

<p>She was coming from the tea-room with two or three other people,
but turned immediately on seeing him and came toward him with
hand extended.</p>

<p>"Dear me," she said, "you look very wet. And you don't look particularly
well. Have you arrived all alone for tea?"</p>

<p>"I had my tea in the bar," he said. "How are you, Marya?&mdash;but
I musn't detain you&mdash;" he glanced at the distant group of people
who seemed to be awaiting her.</p>

<p>"You are not detaining me," she said sweetly.</p>

<p>"Your people seem to be waiting&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They may go to the deuce. Are you quite alone?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Shall we have tea together?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "But you've had yours&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, you know there are other things that one sometimes drinks."</p>

<p>There seemed no way out of it. They went into the tea-room together
and seated themselves.</p>

<p>"How is Vanya?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Vanya gives a concert to-night in Baltimore."</p>

<p>"And you didn't go!"</p>

<p>"No. It was rainy. Besides, I hear Vanya play when I desire to
hear him."</p>

<p>Their order was served.</p>

<p>"So you wouldn't go to Baltimore," said Jim smilingly. "It strikes
me, Marya, that you can be a coldblooded girl when you wish to
be."</p>

<p>"After all, what do you know about me?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "Oh, I don't mean that I've got your number&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No. Because I have many numbers. I am a complicated combination,"
she added, smiling; "&mdash;yet after all, a combination only. And
quite simple when one discovers the key to me."</p>

<p>"I think I know what it is," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Mischief."</p>

<p>They laughed. Marya, particularly, was intensely amused. She
was extremely fetching in her bicorne toque and narrow gown of
light turquoise, and her golden beaver scarf and muff.</p>

<p>"Mischief," she repeated. "I should say not. There seems to be
already sufficient mischief loose in the world, with the red tide
rising everywhere&mdash;in Russia, in Germany, Austria, Italy, England&mdash;yes,
and here also the crimson tide of Bolshevism begins to move....
Tell me; you are coming to the club to-morrow evening, I hope."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh. Why?"</p>

<p>"No," he repeated, almost sullenly. "I've had enough of queerness
for a while&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jim! Do you dare include me?"</p>

<p>He had to laugh at her pretence of fury: "No, Marya, you're just
a pretty mischief-maker, I suppose&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean by 'queerness'? Don't you think it's sensible
to combat Bolshevism and fight it with argument and debate on
its own selected camping ground? Don't you think it is high time
somebody faced this crimson tide&mdash;that somebody started to build
a dyke against this threatened inundation?"</p>

<p>"The best dykes have machine guns behind them, not orators,"
he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"My friend, I have seen that, also. And to what have machine
guns led us in Petrograd, in Moscow, in Poland, Finland, Courland&mdash;"
She shrugged her pretty shoulders. "No. I have seen enough blood."</p>

<p>He said: "I have seen a little myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But a soldier is always a soldier, as a hound is
always a hound. The blood of the quarry is what their instinct
follows. Your goal is death; we only seek to tame."</p>

<p>"The proper way to check Bolshevism in America is to police the
country properly, and kick out the outrageous gang of domestic
Bolsheviki who have exploited us, tricked us, lied to us, taxed
us unfairly, and in spite of whom we have managed to help our
allies win this war.</p>

<p>"Then, when this petty, wretched, crooked bunch has been swept
out, and the nation aired and disinfected, and when the burden
of taxation is properly distributed, and business dares lift its
head again, then start your debates and propaganda and try to
educate your enemies if you like. But keep your machine guns oiled."</p>

<p>"You speak in an uncomplimentary fashion of government," said
the girl, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am all for government. That does not mean that I am for the
particular incumbents in office under the present Government.
I have no use for them. Know that this war was won, not through
them but in spite of them.</p>

<p>"Yet I place loyalty first of all&mdash;loyalty to the true ideals
of that Government which some of the present incumbents so grotesquely
misrepresent.</p>

<p>"That means, stand by the ship and the flag she flies, no matter
who steers or what crew capers about her decks.</p>

<p>"That means, watch out for all pirates;&mdash;open fire on anything
that flies a hostile flag, red or any other colour.</p>

<p>"And that's my creed, Marya!"</p>

<p>"To shoot; not to debate?"</p>

<p>"An inquest is safer."</p>

<p>"We shall never agree," said the girl, laughing. "And I'm rather
glad."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because disagreements are more amusing than any <em>entente
cordiale</em>, <em>mon ami</em>. It is the opposing forces that
never bore each other. In life, too &mdash;I mean among human
beings. Once they agree, interest lessens."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is quite true. Behold us. We don't agree. But I am interested,"
she added with pretty audacity; "so please take me to dinner somewhere."</p>

<p>"You mean now, as we are?"</p>

<p>"Parbleu! Did you wish to go home and dress?"</p>

<p>"I don't care if you don't," he said.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she suggested, "we dine where there is something to
see."</p>

<p>"A Broadway joint?" he asked, amused.</p>

<p>"A joint?" she repeated, smilingly perplexed. "Is that a place
where we may dine and see a spectacle too and afterward dance?"</p>

<p>"Something of that sort," he admitted, laughing. But under his
careless gaiety an ugly determination had been hardening; he meant
to go no more to Palla; he meant to welcome any distraction of
the moment to help tide him over the long, grey interval that
loomed ahead&mdash;welcome any draught that might mitigate the bitter
waters he was tasting&mdash;and was destined to drain to their revolting
dregs.</p>

<p>They went to the Palace of Mirrors and were lucky enough to secure
a box.</p>

<p>The food was excellent; the show a gay one.</p>

<p>Between intermissions he took Marya to the floor for a dance
or two. The place was uncomfortably crowded: uniforms were everywhere,
too; and Jim nodded to many men he knew, and to a few women.</p>

<p>And, in the vast, brilliant place, there was not a man who saw
Marya and failed to turn and follow her with his eyes. For Marya
had been fashioned to trouble man. And that primitively constructed
and obviously-minded sex never failed to become troubled.</p>

<p>"We'd better enjoy our champagne," remarked Marya. "We'll be
a wineless nation before long, I suppose."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a pity," he remarked, "that a man shouldn't
be free to enjoy a glass of claret. But if the unbaked and the
half-baked, and the unwashed and the half-washed can't be trusted
to practise moderation, we others ought to abstain, I suppose.
Because what is best for the majority ought to be the law for
all."</p>

<p>"If it were left to me," said the girl, "I'd let the submerged
drink themselves to death."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" he said. "I thought you
were a socialist!"</p>

<p>"I am. I desire no law except that of individual inclination."</p>

<p>"Why, that's Bolshevism!"</p>

<p>Her laughter rang out unrestrained: "I believe in Bolshevism&mdash;for
myself&mdash;but not for anybody else. In other words, I'd like to
be autocrat of the world. If I were, I'd let everybody alone unless
they interfered with me."</p>

<p>"And in that event?" he asked, laughing, as the lights all over
the house faded to a golden glimmer in preparation for the second
part of the spectacle. He could no longer see her clearly across
the little table. "What would you do if people interfered with
you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>Marya smiled. The last ray of light smouldered in her tiger-red
hair; the warm, fragrant, breathing youth of her grew vaguer,
merging with the shadows; only the beryl-tinted eyes, which slanted
slightly, remained distinct.</p>

<p>Her voice came to him through the music: "If I were autocrat,
any man who dared oppose me would have his choice."</p>

<p>"What choice?"</p>

<p>The music swelled toward a breathless crescendo.</p>

<p>She said: "Oppose me and you shall learn!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The house burst into a dazzling flood of moon-tinted light, all
thronged with slim shapes whirling in an enchanted dance. Then
clouds seemed to gather; the moon slid behind them, leaving a
frosty demi-darkness through which, presently, snow began to fall.</p>

<p>The girl leaned toward him, watching the spectacle in silence.
Perhaps unconsciously her left hand, satin-smooth, slipped over
his&mdash;as though the contact were a symbol of enjoyment shared.</p>

<p>Light broke the next moment, revealing the spectacle on stage
and floor in all its tinsel magnificence&mdash;snow-nymphs, polar-bears,
all capering madly until an unearthly shriek heralded the coming
of a favorite clown, who tumbled all the way down the stage steps
and continued hysterically turning flip-flaps, cart-wheels, and
somersaults until he landed with a crash at the foot of the steps
again.</p>

</div>
<p>A large, highly coloured and over-glossy man, passing under their
box during a dancing intermission, bowed rather extravagantly
to Jim. He recognised Angelo Puma, with contemptuous amusement
at his impudence.</p>

<p>It was evident, too, that Puma was quite ready to linger if encouraged&mdash;anxious,
in fact, to extend his hand.</p>

<p>But his impudence had already ceased to amuse Jim, and he said
carelessly to Marya, in a voice perfectly audible to Puma:</p>

<p>"There goes a man who, in collusion with a squinting partner
of his, once beat me out of a commission."</p>

<p>Puma's heavy, burning face turned abruptly from Marya, whom he
had been looking at; and he continued on across the floor. And
Jim forgot him.</p>

</div>
<p>They remained until the place closed. Then he took her home.</p>

<p>It was an apartment overlooking the park from Fifty-ninth Street&mdash;a
big studio and apparently many comfortable rooms&mdash;a large, still
place where no servants were in evidence and where thick velvety
carpets from Ushak and Sultanabad muffled every footfall.</p>

<p>She had insisted on his entering for a moment. He stood looking
about him in the great studio, where Vanya's concert-grand loomed
up, a sprawling, shadowy shape under the dim drop-light which
once had been a mosque-lamp in Samarcand.</p>

<p>The girl flung stole and muff from her, rolled up her gloves
and took a shot at the piano, then, laughing, unpinned her hat
and sent it scaling away into the golden dusk somewhere.</p>

<p>"Are you sleepy, Jim?"</p>

<p>A sudden vision of his trouble in the long, long night to face&mdash;trouble,
insomnia, and the bitterness welling ever fresher with the interminable
thoughts he could not suppress, could not control&#11834;</p>

<p>"I'm not sleepy," he said. "But don't you want to turn in?"</p>

<p>She went over to the piano, and, accompanying herself on deadened
pedal where she stood, sang in a low voice the "<em>Snow-Tiger</em>,"
with its uncanny refrain:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tiger-eyes<br/>
Tiger-eyes,<br/>
What do you see<br/>
&nbsp;Far in the dark<br/>
&nbsp;Over the snow?<br/>
&nbsp;Far in the dark<br/>
&nbsp;Over the snow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly the ghosts of dead men go,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horses and riders under the moon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trample along to the dead men's rune,<br/>
<em>Slava! Slava!</em><br/>
Over the snow."

</p>
</div>
<p>"That's too hilarious a song," said Jim, laughing. "May I suggest
a little rag to properly subdue us?"</p>

<p>"You don't like <em>Tiger-eyes</em>?"</p>

<p>"I've heard more cheerful ditties."</p>

<p>"When I'm excited by pleasure," said the girl, "I sing <em>Tiger-eyes</em>."</p>

<p>"Does it subdue you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him. "No."</p>

<p>Still standing, she looked down at the keys, struck the muffled
chords softly.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tiger-eyes<br/>
&nbsp;Tiger-eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;Where do they go,<br/>
&nbsp;Far in the dark<br/>
&nbsp;Over the snow?<br/>
&nbsp;Into the dark,<br/>
&nbsp;Over the snow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the ghosts of the dead men know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they have come from, whither they go,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding at night by the corpse-light glow,<br/>
&nbsp;<em>Slava!</em> <em>Slava!</em><br/>
&nbsp;Over the snow."

</p>
</div>
<p>"Well, for the love of Mike&#11834;"</p>

<p>Marya's laughter pealed.</p>

<p>"So you don't like <em>Tiger-eyes</em>?" she demanded, coming
from behind the piano.</p>

<p>"I sure don't," he admitted.</p>

<p>"The real Russian name of the song is 'Words! Words!' And that's
all the song is&mdash;all that any song is&mdash;all that anything amounts
to&mdash;words! words!&mdash;" She dropped onto the long couch,&mdash;"Anything
except&mdash;love."</p>

<p>"You may include that, too," he said, lighting a cigarette for
her; and she blew a ring of smoke at him, saying:</p>

<p>"I may&mdash;but I won't. For goodness sake leave me the last one
of my delusions!"</p>

<p>They both laughed and he said she was welcome to her remaining
delusion.</p>

<p>"Won't you share it with me?" she said, her smile innocent enough,
save for the audacity of the red mouth.</p>

<p>"Share your delusion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that too."</p>

<p>This wouldn't do. He lighted a cigarette for himself and sauntered
over to the piano.</p>

<p>"I hope Vanya's concert is a success," he said. "He's such a
charming fellow, Vanya&mdash;so considerate, so gentle&mdash;" He turned
and looked at Marya, and his eyes added: "Why the devil don't
you marry him and have a lot of jolly children?"</p>

<p>There seemed to be in his clear eyes enough for the girl to comprehend
something of the question they flung at her.</p>

<p>"I don't love Vanya," she said.</p>

<p>"Of course you do!"</p>

<p>"As I might love a child&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>After a silence: "It strikes me," he said, "that you're passionately
in love."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"With yourself," he added, smiling.</p>

<p>"With <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>This wouldn't do any longer. The place slightly stifled him with
its stillness, rugs&mdash;the odours that came from lacquered shapes,
looming dimly, flowered and golden in the dusk&mdash;the aromatic scent
of her cigarette&#11834;</p>

<p>"Hell!" he muttered under his breath. "This is no place for a
white man." But aloud he said pleasantly: "My very best wishes
for Vanya to-night. Tell him so when he returns&mdash;" He put on his
overcoat and picked up hat and stick.</p>

<p>"It's infernally late," he added, "and I've been a beast to keep
you up. It was awfully nice of you."</p>

<p>She rose from the lounge and walked with him to the door.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said cheerily; but she retained his hand, added
her other to it, and put up her face.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, smilingly, "I can't do that, Marya."</p>

<p>"Why can't you?"</p>

<p>Her soft breath was on his face; the mouth too near&mdash;too near&#11834;</p>

<p>"No, I can't!" he said curtly, but his voice trembled a little.</p>

<p>"Why?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;there's Vanya. No, I won't do it!"</p>

<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>

<p>"It's a reason."</p>

<p>"I don't love Vanya. I do love you."</p>

<p>"Please remember&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No! No! I have nothing to remember&mdash;unless you give me something&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You had better try to remember that Vanya loves you. You and
I can't do a thing like that to Vanya&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are there no other reasons?"</p>

<p>He reddened to the temples: "No, there are not&mdash;now. There is
no other reason&mdash;except myself."</p>

<p>"Yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, damn it, myself! That's all that remains now to keep me
straight. And I've been so. That may be news to you. Perhaps you
don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Jim?" she asked in a voice scarcely audible.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. And so I shall keep on, and play the game that way&mdash;play
it squarely with Vanya, too&#11834;"</p>

<p>He had lost his heavy colour; he stood looking at her with a
white, strained, grim expression that tightened the jaw muscles;
and she felt his powerful hand clenching between hers.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he said between his set lips, "I've got to go
on&mdash;see it through in my own fashion&mdash;this rotten thing called
life. I'm sorry, Marya, that I'm not a better sport&#11834;"</p>

<p>A wave of colour swept her face and her hands suddenly crushed
his between them.</p>

<p>"You're wonderful," she said. "I do love you."</p>

<p>But the tense, grey look had come back into his face. Looking
at her in silence, presently his gaze seemed to become remote,
his absent eyes fixed on something beyond her.</p>

<p>"I've a rotten time ahead of me," he said, not knowing he had
spoken. When his eyes reverted to her, his features remained expressionless,
but his voice was almost tender as he said good night once more.</p>

<p>Her hands fell away; he opened the door and went out without
looking back.</p>

<p>He found a taxi at the Plaza. He was swearing when he got into
it. And all the way home he kept repeating to himself: "I'm one
of those cursed, creeping Josephs; that's what I am,&mdash;one of those
pepless, sanctimonious, creeping Josephs.... And I always loathed
that poor fish, too!"</p>
