<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>THE Brazos pony had traveled far that day but for only a trifle over ten
miles had he carried a rider upon his back. He was, consequently, far
from fagged as he leaped forward to the lifted reins and tore along the
dusty river trail back in the direction of Orobo.
</p>
<p>Never before had Brazos covered ten miles in so short a time, for it was
not yet five o'clock when, reeling with fatigue, he stopped, staggered
and fell in front of the office building at El Orobo.
</p><p>Eddie Shorter had sat in the chair as Barbara and Billy had last seen
him waiting until Byrne should have an ample start before arousing
Grayson and reporting the prisoner's escape. Eddie had determined that
he would give Billy an hour. He grinned as he anticipated the rage of
Grayson and the Villistas when they learned that their bird had flown,
and as he mused and waited he fell asleep.
</p><p>It was broad daylight when Eddie awoke, and as he looked up at the
little clock ticking against the wall, and saw the time he gave an
exclamation of surprise and leaped to his feet. Just as he opened the
outer door of the office he saw a horseman leap from a winded pony
in front of the building. He saw the animal collapse and sink to the
ground, and then he recognized the pony as Brazos, and another glance at
the man brought recognition of him, too.
</p><p>“You?” cried Eddie. “What are you doin' back here? I gotta take you
now,” and he started to draw his revolver; but Billy Byrne had him
covered before ever his hand reached the grip of his gun.
</p><p>“Put 'em up!” admonished Billy, “and listen to me. This ain't no time
fer gunplay or no such foolishness. I ain't back here to be took--get
that out o' your nut. I'm tipped off that a bunch o' siwashes was down
here last night to swipe Miss Harding. Come! We gotta go see if she's
here or not, an' don't try any funny business on me, Eddie. I ain't
a-goin' to be taken again, an' whoever tries it gets his, see?”
</p><p>Eddie was down off the porch in an instant, and making for the
ranchhouse.
</p><p>“I'm with you,” he said. “Who told you? And who done it?”
</p><p>“Never mind who told me; but a siwash named Esteban was to pull the
thing off for Grayson. Grayson wanted Miss Harding an' he was goin' to
have her stolen for him.”
</p><p>“The hound!” muttered Eddie.
</p><p>The two men dashed up onto the veranda of the ranchhouse and pounded at
the door until a Chinaman opened it and stuck out his head, inquiringly.
</p><p>“Is Miss Harding here?” demanded Billy.
</p><p>“Mlissy Hardie Kleep,” snapped the servant. “Wally wanee here flo
blekfas?”, and would have shut the door in their faces had not Billy
intruded a heavy boot. The next instant he placed a large palm over the
celestial's face and pushed the man back into the house. Once inside he
called Mr. Harding's name aloud.
</p><p>“What is it?” asked the gentleman a moment later as he appeared in a
bedroom doorway off the living-room clad in his pajamas. “What's the
matter? Why, gad man, is that you? Is this really Billy Byrne?”
</p><p>“Sure,” replied Byrne shortly; “but we can't waste any time chinnin'. I
heard that Miss Barbara was goin' to be swiped last night--I heard that
she had been. Now hurry and see if she is here.”
</p><p>Anthony Harding turned and leaped up the narrow stairway to the second
floor four steps at a time. He hadn't gone upstairs in that fashion in
forty years. Without even pausing to rap he burst into his daughter's
bedroom. It was empty. The bed was unruffled. It had not been slept in.
With a moan the man turned back and ran hastily to the other rooms upon
the second floor--Barbara was nowhere to be found. Then he hastened
downstairs to the two men awaiting him.
</p><p>As he entered the room from one end Grayson entered it from the other
through the doorway leading out upon the veranda. Billy Byrne had heard
footsteps upon the boards without and he was ready, so that as Grayson
entered he found himself looking straight at the business end of a
sixshooter. The foreman halted, and stood looking in surprise first at
Billy Byrne, and then at Eddie Shorter and Mr. Harding.
</p><p>“What does this mean?” he demanded, addressing Eddie. “What you doin'
here with your prisoner? Who told you to let him out, eh?”
</p><p>“Can the chatter,” growled Billy Byrne. “Shorter didn't let me out. I
escaped hours ago, and I've just come back from Jose's to ask you where
Miss Harding is, you low-lived cur, you. Where is she?”
</p><p>“What has Mr. Grayson to do with it?” asked Mr. Harding. “How should he
know anything about it? It's all a mystery to me--you here, of all men
in the world, and Grayson talking about you as the prisoner. I can't
make it out. Quick, though, Byrne, tell me all you know about Barbara.”
</p><p>Billy kept Grayson covered as he replied to the request of Harding.
</p><p>“This guy hires a bunch of Pimans to steal Miss Barbara,” he said. “I
got it straight from the fellow he paid the money to for gettin' him the
right men to pull off the job. He wants her it seems,” and Billy shot
a look at the ranch foreman that would have killed if looks could. “She
can't have been gone long. I seen her after midnight, just before I made
my getaway, so they can't have taken her very far. This thing here can't
help us none neither, for he don't know where she is any more'n we do.
He thinks he does; but he don't. The siwashes framed it on him, an'
they've doubled-crossed him. I got that straight too; but, Gawd! I don't
know where they've taken her or what they're goin' to do with her.”
</p><p>As he spoke he turned his eyes for the first time away from Grayson and
looked full in Anthony Harding's face. The latter saw beneath the strong
character lines of the other's countenance the agony of fear and doubt
that lay heavy upon his heart.
</p><p>In the brief instant that Billy's watchful gaze left the figure of the
ranch foreman the latter saw the opportunity he craved. He was standing
directly in the doorway--a single step would carry him out of range of
Byrne's gun, placing a wall between it and him, and Grayson was not slow
in taking that step.
</p><p>When Billy turned his eyes back the Texan had disappeared, and by the
time the former reached the doorway Grayson was halfway to the office
building on the veranda of which stood the four soldiers of Villa
grumbling and muttering over the absence of their prisoner of the
previous evening.
</p><p>Billy Byrne stepped out into the open. The ranch foreman called aloud to
the four Mexicans that their prisoner was at the ranchhouse and as they
looked in that direction they saw him, revolver in hand, coming slowly
toward them. There was a smile upon his lips which they could not see
because of the distance, and which, not knowing Billy Byrne, they would
not have interpreted correctly; but the revolver they did understand,
and at sight of it one of them threw his carbine to his shoulder. His
finger, however, never closed upon the trigger, for there came the sound
of a shot from beyond Billy Byrne and the Mexican staggered forward,
pitching over the edge of the porch to the ground.
</p><p>Billy turned his head in the direction from which the shot had come and
saw Eddie Shorter running toward him, a smoking six-shooter in his right
hand.
</p><p>“Go back,” commanded Byrne; “this is my funeral.”
</p><p>“Not on your life,” replied Eddie Shorter. “Those greasers don't take no
white man off'n El Orobo, while I'm here. Get busy! They're comin'.”
</p><p>And sure enough they were coming, and as they came their carbines popped
and the bullets whizzed about the heads of the two Americans. Grayson,
too, had taken a hand upon the side of the Villistas. From the bunkhouse
other men were running rapidly in the direction of the fight, attracted
by the first shots.
</p><p>Billy and Eddie stood their ground, a few paces apart. Two more of
Villa's men went down. Grayson ran for cover. Then Billy Byrne dropped
the last of the Mexicans just as the men from the bunkhouse came panting
upon the scene. There were both Americans and Mexicans among them. All
were armed and weapons were ready in their hands.
</p><p>They paused a short distance from the two men. Eddie's presence upon the
side of the stranger saved Billy from instant death, for Eddie was well
liked by both his Mexican and American fellow-workers.
</p><p>“What's the fuss?” asked an American.
</p><p>Eddie told them, and when they learned that the boss's daughter had been
spirited away and that the ranch foreman was at the bottom of it the
anger of the Americans rose to a dangerous pitch.
</p><p>“Where is he?” someone asked. They were gathered in a little cluster now
about Billy Byrne and Shorter.
</p><p>“I saw him duck behind the office building,” said Eddie.
</p><p>“Come on,” said another. “We'll get him.”
</p><p>“Someone get a rope.” The men spoke in low, ordinary tones--they
appeared unexcited. Determination was the most apparent characteristic
of the group. One of them ran back toward the bunkhouse for his rope.
The others walked slowly in the direction of the rear of the office
building. Grayson was not there. The search proceeded. The Americans
were in advance. The Mexicans kept in a group by themselves a little in
rear of the others--it was not their trouble. If the gringos wanted to
lynch another gringo, well and good--that was the gringos' business.
They would keep out of it, and they did.
</p><p>Down past the bunkhouse and the cookhouse to the stables the searchers
made their way. Grayson could not be found. In the stables one of the
men made a discovery--the foreman's saddle had vanished. Out in the
corrals they went. One of the men laughed--the bars were down and the
saddle horses gone. Eddie Shorter presently pointed out across the
pasture and the river to the skyline of the low bluffs beyond. The
others looked. A horseman was just visible urging his mount upward to
the crest, the two stood in silhouette against the morning sky pink with
the new sun.
</p><p>“That's him,” said Eddie.
</p><p>“Let him go,” said Billy Byrne. “He won't never come back and he ain't
worth chasin'. Not while we got Miss Barbara to look after. My horse
is down there with yours. I'm goin' down to get him. Will you come,
Shorter? I may need help--I ain't much with a rope yet.”
</p><p>He started off without waiting for a reply, and all the Americans
followed. Together they circled the horses and drove them back to the
corral. When Billy had saddled and mounted he saw that the others had
done likewise.
</p><p>“We're goin' with you,” said one of the men. “Miss Barbara b'longs to
us.”
</p><p>Billy nodded and moved off in the direction of the ranchhouse. Here he
dismounted and with Eddie Shorter and Mr. Harding commenced circling
the house in search of some manner of clue to the direction taken by
the abductors. It was not long before they came upon the spot where the
Indians' horses had stood the night before. From there the trail led
plainly down toward the river. In a moment ten Americans were following
it, after Mr. Harding had supplied Billy Byrne with a carbine, another
six-shooter, and ammunition.
</p><p>Through the river and the cut in the barbed-wire fence, then up the face
of the bluff and out across the low mesa beyond the trail led. For a
mile it was distinct, and then disappeared as though the riders had
separated.
</p><p>“Well,” said Billy, as the others drew around him for consultation,
“they'd be goin' to the hills there. They was Pimans--Esteban's tribe.
They got her up there in the hills somewheres. Let's split up an'
search the hills for her. Whoever comes on 'em first'll have to do
some shootin' and the rest of us can close in an' help. We can go in
pairs--then if one's killed the other can ride out an' lead the way back
to where it happened.”
</p><p>The men seemed satisfied with the plan and broke up into parties of two.
Eddie Shorter paired off with Billy Byrne.
</p><p>“Spread out,” said the latter to his companions. “Eddie an' I'll ride
straight ahead--the rest of you can fan out a few miles on either side
of us. S'long an' good luck,” and he started off toward the hills, Eddie
Shorter at his side.
</p><p>Back at the ranch the Mexican vaqueros lounged about, grumbling. With no
foreman there was nothing to do except talk about their troubles. They
had not been paid since the looting of the bank at Cuivaca, for Mr.
Harding had been unable to get any silver from elsewhere until a few
days since. He now had assurances that it was on the way to him; but
whether or not it would reach El Orobo was a question.
</p><p>“Why should we stay here when we are not paid?” asked one of them.
</p><p>“Yes, why?” chorused several others.
</p><p>“There is nothing to do here,” said another. “We will go to Cuivaca. I,
for one, am tired of working for the gringos.”
</p><p>This met with the unqualified approval of all, and a few moments
later the men had saddled their ponies and were galloping away in the
direction of sun-baked Cuivaca. They sang now, and were happy, for they
were as little boys playing hooky from school--not bad men; but rather
irresponsible children.
</p><p>Once in Cuivaca they swooped down upon the drinking-place, where, with
what little money a few of them had left they proceeded to get drunk.
</p><p>Later in the day an old, dried-up Indian entered. He was hot and dusty
from a long ride.
</p><p>“Hey, Jose!” cried one of the vaqueros from El Orobo Rancho; “you old
rascal, what are you doing here?”
</p><p>Jose looked around upon them. He knew them all--they represented the
Mexican contingent of the riders of El Orobo. Jose wondered what they
were all doing here in Cuivaca at one time. Even upon a pay day it never
had been the rule of El Orobo to allow more than four men at a time to
come to town.
</p><p>“Oh, Jose come to buy coffee and tobacco,” he replied. He looked about
searchingly. “Where are the others?” he asked, “--the gringos?”
</p><p>“They have ridden after Esteban,” explained one of the vaqueros. “He has
run off with Senorita Harding.”
</p><p>Jose raised his eyebrows as though this was all news.
</p><p>“And Senor Grayson has gone with them?” he asked. “He was very fond of
the senorita.”
</p><p>“Senor Grayson has run away,” went on the other speaker. “The other
gringos wished to hang him, for it is said he has bribed Esteban to do
this thing.”
</p><p>Again Jose raised his eyebrows. “Impossible!” he ejaculated. “And who
then guards the ranch?” he asked presently.
</p><p>“Senor Harding, two Mexican house servants, and a Chinaman,” and the
vaquero laughed.
</p><p>“I must be going,” Jose announced after a moment. “It is a long ride for
an old man from my poor home to Cuivaca, and back again.”
</p><p>The vaqueros were paying no further attention to him, and the Indian
passed out and sought his pony; but when he had mounted and ridden from
town he took a strange direction for one whose path lies to the east,
since he turned his pony's head toward the northwest.
</p><p>Jose had ridden far that day, since Billy had left his humble hut. He
had gone to the west to the little rancho of one of Pesita's adherents
who had dispatched a boy to carry word to the bandit that his Captain
Byrne had escaped the Villistas, and then Jose had ridden into Cuivaca
by a circuitous route which brought him up from the east side of the
town.
</p><p>Now he was riding once again for Pesita; but this time he would bear
the information himself. He found the chief in camp and after begging
tobacco and a cigarette paper the Indian finally reached the purpose of
his visit.
</p><p>“Jose has just come from Cuivaca,” he said, “and there he drank with
all the Mexican vaqueros of El Orobo Rancho--ALL, my general, you
understand. It seems that Esteban has carried off the beautiful senorita
of El Orobo Rancho, and the vaqueros tell Jose that ALL the American
vaqueros have ridden in search of her--ALL, my general, you understand.
In such times of danger it is odd that the gringos should leave El Orobo
thus unguarded. Only the rich Senor Harding, two house servants, and a
Chinaman remain.”
</p><p>A man lay stretched upon his blankets in a tent next to that occupied
by Pesita. At the sound of the speaker's voice, low though it was, he
raised his head and listened. He heard every word, and a scowl settled
upon his brow. Barbara stolen! Mr Harding practically alone upon the
ranch! And Pesita in possession of this information!
</p><p>Bridge rose to his feet. He buckled his cartridge belt about his waist
and picked up his carbine, then he crawled under the rear wall of his
tent and walked slowly off in the direction of the picket line where the
horses were tethered.
</p><p>“Ah, Senor Bridge,” said a pleasant voice in his ear; “where to?”
</p><p>Bridge turned quickly to look into the smiling, evil face of Rozales.
</p><p>“Oh,” he replied, “I'm going out to see if I can't find some shooting.
It's awfully dull sitting around here doing nothing.”
</p><p>“Si, senor,” agreed Rozales; “I, too, find it so. Let us go together--I
know where the shooting is best.”
</p><p>“I don't doubt it,” thought Bridge; “probably in the back;” but aloud
he said: “Certainly, that will be fine,” for he guessed that Rozales had
been set to watch his movements and prevent his escape, and, perchance,
to be the sole witness of some unhappy event which should carry Senor
Bridge to the arms of his fathers.
</p><p>Rozales called a soldier to saddle and bridle their horses and shortly
after the two were riding abreast down the trail out of the hills. Where
it was necessary that they ride in single file Bridge was careful to
see that Rozales rode ahead, and the Mexican graciously permitted the
American to fall behind.
</p><p>If he was inspired by any other motive than simple espionage he was
evidently content to bide his time until chance gave him the opening he
desired, and it was equally evident that he felt as safe in front of the
American as behind him.
</p><p>At a point where a ravine down which they had ridden debauched upon a
mesa Rozales suggested that they ride to the north, which was not at all
the direction in which Bridge intended going. The American demurred.
</p><p>“But there is no shooting down in the valley,” urged Rozales.
</p><p>“I think there will be,” was Bridge's enigmatical reply, and then, with
a sudden exclamation of surprise he pointed over Rozales' shoulder.
“What's that?” he cried in a voice tense with excitement.
</p><p>The Mexican turned his head quickly in the direction Bridge's index
finger indicated.
</p><p>“I see nothing,” said Rozales, after a moment.
</p><p>“You do now, though,” replied Bridge, and as the Mexican's eyes returned
in the direction of his companion he was forced to admit that he did see
something--the dismal, hollow eye of a six-shooter looking him straight
in the face.
</p><p>“Senor Bridge!” exclaimed Rozales. “What are you doing? What do you
mean?”
</p><p>“I mean,” said Bridge, “that if you are at all solicitous of your health
you'll climb down off that pony, not forgetting to keep your hands above
your head when you reach the ground. Now climb!”
</p><p>Rozales dismounted.
</p><p>“Turn your back toward me,” commanded the American, and when the other
had obeyed him, Bridge dismounted and removed the man's weapons from his
belt. “Now you may go, Rozales,” he said, “and should you ever have an
American in your power again remember that I spared your life when I
might easily have taken it--when it would have been infinitely safer for
me to have done it.”
</p><p>The Mexican made no reply, but the black scowl that clouded his face
boded ill for the next gringo who should be so unfortunate as to fall
into his hands. Slowly he wheeled about and started back up the trail in
the direction of the Pesita camp.
</p><p>“I'll be halfway to El Orobo,” thought Bridge, “before he gets a chance
to tell Pesita what happened to him,” and then he remounted and rode on
down into the valley, leading Rozales' horse behind him.
</p><p>It would never do, he knew, to turn the animal loose too soon, since he
would doubtless make his way back to camp, and in doing so would have
to pass Rozales who would catch him. Time was what Bridge wanted--to be
well on his way to Orobo before Pesita should learn of his escape.
</p><p>Bridge knew nothing of what had happened to Billy, for Pesita had seen
to it that the information was kept from the American. The latter had,
nevertheless, been worrying not a little at the absence of his friend
for he knew that he had taken his liberty and his life in his hands in
riding down to El Orobo among avowed enemies.
</p><p>Far to his rear Rozales plodded sullenly up the steep trail through the
mountains, revolving in his mind various exquisite tortures he should be
delighted to inflict upon the next gringo who came into his power.
