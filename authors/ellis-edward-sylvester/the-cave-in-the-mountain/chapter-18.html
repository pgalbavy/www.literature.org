<p>All this was grist for Mickey and Fred. The long silence and
inaction&mdash;so far as these two were concerned&mdash;of the Apaches convinced
the fugitives that some important interruption was going on, and
that it could not fail to operate in the most direct way in their
favor. It was well into the afternoon when the collision occurred
between them and the Apaches, and enough time had already passed
to bring the night quite close at hand. An hour or so more, and
darkness would be upon them.</p>

<p>"I don't belave the spalpeens have found put just the precise
spot where we've stowed away," said Mickey, in his cautious undertone,
to his companion, "for I've no evidence that such is the case."</p>

<p>"They may take it into their heads to come into the fissure again,
and then where are we?"</p>

<p>"Right here, every time. We couldn't get a better spot, unless
it might be at the mouth."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better go there?" asked the lad, who
could not feel the assurance of his friend.</p>

<p>"I see nothing to be gained by the same, as Tim O'Loony said
when some one told him that honesty was the best policy. If we
start to return there, they'll find out where we are, and begin
to roll stones on us. I don't want to go along, dodging rocks
as big as a house, wid an occasional rifle-shot thrown in, by
way of variety."</p>

<p>"Don't you fear they will creep in and try to surprise us?"</p>

<p>"Not before dark, and then we can shift our position."</p>

<p>"Do you believe there is any hope at all for us in the way of
getting out?"</p>

<p>The Irishman was careful not to arouse too strong hopes in the
breast of the lad, and he tried to be guarded in his reply:</p>

<p>"An hour ago I would have sworn if there war a half-dozen of
us in here, there was no show of our getting away wid our top-knots,
for the raison that there is but one hole through which we could
sneak, and there's twenty of 'em sitting round there, and watching
for us; but I faal that there is some ground for hope."</p>

<p>"What reason for your saying there is hope? Isn't it just as
hard to get out the front without being seen?"</p>

<p>"It might be just now; but there's no telling what them ither
spalpeens mane to do arter the sun goes down. S'pose they get
Lone Wolf and his men in such a big fight that they'd have their
hands full, what's to hinder our sneaking out the back-door during
the rumpus, hunting up our mustangs, or somebody else's, and resooming
our journey to New Boston, which these spalpeens were so impertinent
as to interrupt a short time since?"</p>

<p>Fred Munson felt that this was about as rose-colored a view as
could be taken, and indeed a great deal rosier than the situation
warranted&mdash;at least, in his opinion.</p>

<p>"Mickey, if that isn't counting chickens before they're hatched,
I don't know what is! While you're supposing things, suppose these
Indians don't do all that, where's going to come our chance of
creeping out without their knowing it?"</p>

<p>Mickey scratched his head in his puzzled way, and replied:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to obsarve that ye persist in axing knotty questions,
as I reproved me landlord for doing in the ould country, when
he found me digging praities in his patch. There's a good many
ways in which we may get a chance to craap out, and I'm bound
to say there be a good many more by which we can't; but the good
Lord has been so good to us, that I can't help belaving He won't
let us drop jist yet, though He may think that the best thing
for us both will be to let the varmints come in and scalp us."</p>

<p>There was a good deal of hope in the Irishman, and a certain
contagion marked it, which Fred Munson felt, but he could not
entertain as much of it as did his older and more experienced
friend. Still, he was ready to make any attempt which offered
the least chance of flight. He was hungry and thirsty, and there
was no way of supplying the wants, and he dreaded the night of
suffering to be succeeded by the still more tormenting day.</p>

<p>It was very warm in the ravine, where not a stir of air could
reach them. If they suffered themselves to be cooped up there
through the night, they would be certain to continue there during
the following day, for it was not to be expected by the wildest
enthusiast that any way of escape presented itself under the broad
sunlight. The following night must find them more weakened in
every respect; for the chewing of leaves, while it might afford
temporary relief, could not be expected to amount to much in a
run of twenty-four hours. Clearly, if anything at all was to be
done or attempted, it should not be deferred beyond the evening,
which was now so close at hand.</p>

<p>But the objection again came up that whatever Mickey and Fred
decided on, hinged upon the action of parties with whom they had
nothing to do, and with whom, as a matter of course, it was impossible
to communicate. If the Kiowas, as they were suspected to be, should
choose to draw off and have nothing further to do with the business,
the situation of the fugitives must become as despairing and hopeless
as in the first case.</p>

<p>There perhaps was some reason for the declaration of Mickey that
the strangers (their allies for the time being) were a great deal
more likely to perform their mission before the sun should rise
again. Consequently, the next few hours were likely to settle
the question one way or the other.</p>

<p>"Do you know whether any of the Apaches are still up there?"
asked Fred.</p>

<p>"Yes; there be one or two. I've seen 'em since we've been talking,
but they're a good deal more careful of showing their ugly faces.
They paap over now and then, and dodge back agin, before I can
get a chance to pop away."</p>

<p>"Would you try and shoot them if you had the chance?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet, for it would show 'em where we are, and they would
be likely to bother us."</p>

<p>The two carried out this policy of keeping their precise location
from the Indians so long as it was possible, which would have
been a very short time, but for the terror inspired among the
Apaches from the shots across the pass. Mickey had no suspicion
that Lone Wolf and his best warriors were absent on a hunt for
the annoying cause of these shots. Had he known it, he might have
been tempted upon a reconnoissance of his own before sunset, and
so it was well, perhaps, that he remained in ignorance.</p>

<p>Within the next hour night descended, and the ravine, excluding
the rays of the moon, became so dark that Mickey believed it safe
to venture out of their niche and approach the pass, into which
they had no idea of entering until the ground had been thoroughly
reconnoitered.</p>

<p>"The spalpeens will be listening," whispered Mickey, as they
crept out, "and so ye naadn't indulge in any whistling, or hurrahing,
or dancing jigs on the way to our destination."</p>

<p>Fred appreciated their common peril too well to allow any betrayal
through his remissness. Favored by the darkness, they crept carefully
along over the rocks and boulders, and through the vines and vegetation,
until they were so close that the man halted.</p>

<p>"Do ye mind and kaap as still as a dead man, for we're so close
now that it won't do to go any closer till we know what the spalpeens
are doing."</p>

<p>The two occupied this position for some time, during which nothing
caught their ears to betray the presence of men or animals. Feeling
the great value of time, Mickey was on the point of creeping forth,
when he became aware that there was somebody moving near him.
The sound was very slight, but the proof was all the more positive
on that account; for it is only by such means that the professional
scout judges of the proceedings of a foe near him.</p>

<p>His first dread was that the individual was in the rear, having
entered the fissure while they were at the opposite end, and then
allowed them to pass by him. But when the faint rustling caught
his ear again there could be no doubt that it was in front of
him.</p>

<p>"One of the spalpeens&mdash;and maybe Lone Wolf himself&mdash;coming in
to larn about our health," was his conclusion, though the situation
was too critical to allow him to communicate with the lad behind
him.</p>

<p>Reaching his hand back, he touched his arm, as a warning for
the most perfect silence.</p>

<p>The boulder against which he was partly resting was no more quiet
and motionless than Fred, who had nerved himself to meet the worst
or best fortune. A few minutes more listening satisfied Mickey
that the redskin was not a dozen feet in front, and that a particularly
large boulder, which was partly revealed by some stray moonlight
that made its way through the limbs and branches, was sheltering
the scout. Not only that, but he became convinced that the Indian
was moving around the left side of the rock, hugging it and keeping
so close to the ground that the faintest shadowy resemblance of
a human figure could not be detected.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the Irishman determined upon a performance
perfectly characteristic and amusing in its originality. Carefully
drawing his knife from his pocket, he managed to cut a switch,
some five or six feet in length, the end of which was slightly
split. He next took one of his matches, and struck it against
the rock, holding and nursing the flame so far down behind it
that not the slightest sign of it could be seen from the outside.
Before the match had cleared itself of the brimstone, Mickey secured
the other end of the stick in his hand. His next proceeding was
to raise this stick, move it around in front, and then suddenly
extend it at arms length. This brought the burning match into
the dense shadow alongside the rock, and directly over the head
of the amazed scout. The Hibernian character of the act was, that
while it revealed to him his man, it also, although in a less
degree, betrayed the location of Mickey himself, whose delighted
astonishment may be imagined, when, instead of discerning a crouching,
painted Apache, he recognized the familiar figure of Sut Simpson,
the scout.</p>

<p>"What in thunder are ye driving at?" growled the no less astonished
Sut, as the flame was almost brought against his face. "Do yer
take me for a kag of powder, and do ye want to touch me off?"</p>

<p>"No, but I was thinking that that long, red nose of yourn was
so full of whiskey that it would burn, and I wanted to make sartin."</p>
