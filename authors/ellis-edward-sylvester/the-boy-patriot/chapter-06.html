<p>It is strange that the moon generally has all the blame for fickleness,
when the sun quite as often hides his face without sufficient
warning. The Fairport Guard had hardly made the circuit of the
town, before the late smiling sky was overcast by dark hurrying
clouds, and the weatherwise began to predict a coming storm, which
was to be "no joke on sea or land."</p>

<p>Luckless members of the Fairport Guard who had not had the precaution
to tie on their head-gear, might be seen breaking rank and running
indecorously in various directions in pursuit of hat or cap, while
the skirts of the captain's time-honored coat flapped in the wind,
like the signal of a ship in distress.</p>

<p>It was in the endeavor to complete their usual tour, by passing
along the wharf, that this military body was subjected to this
attack from old Boreas. Worse confusion, however, soon broke up
all order among them. A group of men on the wharf had been for
some time looking at a ship nearing the harbor. They could not
make her out, they said. She was a stranger in those waters, and
yet bore the American flag. She seemed a man-of-war, and was evidently
signalling for a pilot.</p>

<p>Fairport harbor, smooth and safe as it was, cradled among the
overhanging cliffs, had a guard at its entrance which no stranger
might defy. Its deep narrow channel went winding among hidden
rocks, and woe betide the keel that ventured a dozen yards from
its appointed path.</p>

<p>For thirty years Joe Robertson had been the pilot of Fairport,
and was as well known to the frequenters of that harbor as was
the tall spire which was the pride of the town. The sound of war
had, however, roused within him the spirit of his father of Revolutionary
memory. He declared he would not have it said that Joe Robertson
was content to play door-keeper to the harbor of Fairport, while
brave men were shedding their blood for the country, as dear to
him as to them. Joe's enthusiasm was contagious. It spread through
all Fairport, and there was hardly a man who could bear arms on
sea or land who was not off at his country's bidding.</p>

<p>Old Jock, who had had one leg bitten off by a shark, men who
had been crippled by a fall from mainmast or yard, and sickly
sailors, worn out by the fevers of southern ports, were left at
home to keep company with the few true landsmen, the shopmen of
the town.</p>

<p>Old Jock had been content to serve as pilot since the departure
of Joe, and well he knew the channel; but he seemed to have grown
lazy, or particularly careful of himself, since Hal had come under
his roof. Now he positively refused to go to the vessel in the
offing. He plainly expressed his doubts as to what kind of a craft
she was, and moreover declared that such a squall as was coming
up was "not to be risked by any man in his senses, even if that
old ship went to the bottom with every soul in her."</p>

<p>Blair listened intently to this conversation. Too many times
had he been to and fro with his father in his pilot's duty not
to know well the dangerous channel. Every crook and turn in it
was as familiar to him as the windings of the little path in his
mother's flower-garden. The boy stood erect with growing determination
as the speakers went on.</p>

<p>"She makes for the shore. She'll surely run on the rocks if a
pilot don't go to her. If Joe Robertson were only here. What business
had a man of his age going off to the war, instead of staying
to look after the harbor of his own town?"</p>

<p>"He has left his son to take his place," said Blair quickly.
"I know the channel. I am not afraid. I will just speak to my
mother, and then I'm off."</p>

<p>In a few hurried words the son told his design to the mother
who understood him so well. "May I go?" he added; "I know you
will not refuse."</p>

<p>The mother's eyes filled with tears as she spoke. "I will not
keep you, my noble boy. God bless and watch over you. The true
Christian, like his Master, takes his life in his hand, and goes
forth at the call of duty. The true patriot will risk all for
his dear countrymen. Go. My prayers shall be around you like a
guard."</p>

<p>When Blair returned to the wharf it was with his mother at his
side. The little pilot-boat had been made ready. As he jumped
into it, another figure quickly followed him. It was Hal Hutchings.
"I must go with you," he said with determination. "I can manage
a boat. I sha'n't be in the way. I couldn't stand it to wait on
the shore. May-be two of us will be needed."</p>

<p>Blair gave Hal one cordial grasp of the hand, then hoisted his
bit of a sail, and soon over the wild waves the two boys took
their course together.</p>

<p>"God help that Blair Robertson. He has the making of the right
kind of a man in him," exclaimed a bystander.</p>

<p>"He's <em>our captain</em>, Blair is," said one of the youngest
members of the Fairport Guard.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought of Hal's making such a venture?" said
Old Jock. "He's a little skeary about water yet. But I believe
he'd die for Blair Robertson. Whatever takes hold of that Hal
Hutchings takes him strong."</p>

<p>The mother's eye followed the little boat as it went dancing
over the waves, but her heart was uplifted in silent prayer.</p>
