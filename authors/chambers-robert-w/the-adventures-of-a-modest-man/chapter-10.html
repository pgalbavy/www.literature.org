<p>She considered him with guileless eyes. He was <em>too</em> good-looking,
too attractive, too young, and far too much pleased with himself.
That was the impression he gave her. And, as he was, in addition,
plainly one of her own sort, a man she was likely to meet anywhere&mdash;a
well-bred, well-mannered and agreeable young fellow, probably
a recent undergraduate, which might account for his really inoffensive
breeziness&mdash;she felt perfectly at ease with him and safe enough
to continue imprudently her mischief.</p>

<p>"If you are going to begin at the beginning," she said, "perhaps
it might steady your nerves to repeat your own name very slowly
and distinctly. Physicians recommend it sometimes," she added
seriously.</p>

<p>"My name is John Seabury," he said, laughing. "Am I lucid?"</p>

<p>"Lucid so far," she said gravely. "I knew a Lily Seabury&#11834;"</p>

<p>"My sister. She's in Paris."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that, too," mused the girl, looking at him in a
different light&mdash;different in this way that his credentials were
now unquestionable, and she could be as mischievous as she pleased
with the minimum of imprudence.</p>

<p>"Do you ever take the advice of physicians," he asked naïvely,
"about repeating names?"</p>

<p>"Seldom," she said. "I don't require the treatment."</p>

<p>"I was only wondering&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You were wondering what C. G. stood for on my satchel? I will
be very glad to tell you, Mr. Seabury. <em>C</em> stands for Cecil,
and <em>G</em> for Gay; Cecil Gay. Is that lucid?"</p>

<p>"Cecil!" he said; "that's a man's name."</p>

<p>"How rude! It is <em>my</em> name. Now, do you think your mental
calibre requires any more re-boring?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know about calibres and things. Do you shoot? I <em>can</em>
talk about dogs and guns. Listen to me, Miss Gay." The subject
shifted from shooting to fishing, and from hunting to driving
four-in-hand, and eventually came back to the horses and the quaint
depot-sleigh which was whirling them so swiftly toward their destination.</p>

<p>"Jack Austin and I were in Paris," he observed.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;recently?"</p>

<p>"Last year."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose it was one of those obsessed premonitions&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are laughing at me, Miss Gay."</p>

<p>"Am I? Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? How on earth is a man to know why? <em>I</em> don't know
why you do it, but you do&mdash;all the time."</p>

<p>"Not <em>all</em> the time, Mr. Seabury, because I don't know
you well enough."</p>

<p>"But you know my sister!"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is a dear."</p>

<p>"Won't that introduce me? And, besides, you know Jack Austin&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"Isn't that odd?" he said. "You don't know Jack Austin and I
don't know Mrs. Austin. It was nice of her to ask me. They say
she is one of the best ever."</p>

<p>"It was certainly nice of her to ask you," said the girl, eyes
brightening over her muff.</p>

<p>"I was in Europe when they were married," he said. "I suppose
you were there."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't. That sounds rather strange, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, rather!" he replied, looking up at her in his boyish,
perplexed way. And for a moment her heart failed her; he <em>was</em>
nice, but also he was a living temptation. Never before in all
her brief life had she been tempted to do to anybody what she
was doing to him. She had often been imprudent in a circumspect
way&mdash;conventionally unconventional at times&mdash;even a little daring.
At sheer audacity she had drawn the line, and now the impulse
to cross that line had been too much for her. But even she did
not know exactly why temptation had overcome her.</p>

<p>There was something that she ought to tell him&mdash;and tell him
at once. Yet, after all, it was really already too late to tell
him&mdash;had been too late from the first. Fate, Chance and Destiny,
the Mystic Three, disguised, as usual, one as a German conductor;
one as a large mottled man; the other as a furry footman had been
bumped by Seabury and jeered at by a girl wearing dark blue eyes
and chinchillas. And now the affronted Three were taking exclusive
charge of John Seabury and Cecil Gay. She was partly aware of
this; she did not feel inclined to interfere where interference
could do no good. And that being the case, why not extract amusement
from matters as they stood? Alas, it is not well to laugh at the
Mystic Three! But Cecil Gay didn't know that. You see, even <em>she</em>
didn't know everything.</p>

<p>"You will like Jack Austin," he asserted.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing to bet&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wait till we know one another officially before we begin
to make wagers.... Still, I might, perhaps safely wager that I
shall not find your friend Jack Austin very agreeable to-night."</p>

<p>So they settled the terms of the wager; cigarettes versus the
inevitable bonbons.</p>

<p>"Everybody likes Jack Austin on sight," he said triumphantly,
"so you may as well send the cigarettes when you are ready;" and
he mentioned the brand.</p>

<p>"You will never smoke those cigarettes," she mused aloud, looking
dreamily at him, her muff pressed alongside of her pretty cheek.
"Tell me, Mr. Seabury, are you vindictive?"</p>

<p>"Not very."</p>

<p>"Revengeful?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no, I don't think so," he replied. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm much relieved," she said, simply.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I've done a dreadful thing&mdash;perfectly dreadful."</p>

<p>"To me?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>Perplexed and curious, he attempted to learn what she meant,
but she parried everything smiling. And now, the faster the horses
sped, the faster her pulses beat, and the more uncertain and repentant
she became until her uncertainty increased to a miniature panic,
and, thoroughly scared, she relapsed into a silence from which
he found it beyond his powers to lure her.</p>

<p>For already a bright light was streaming out toward them from
somewhere ahead. In its rays the falling snow turned golden, every
separate flake distinct as they passed a great gate with the lodge
beside it and went spinning away along a splendid wooded avenue
and then straight up toward a great house, every window ablaze
with light.</p>

<p>John Seabury jumped out and offered his aid to Cecil Gay as several
servants appeared under the porte-cochère.</p>

<p>"I had no idea that Jack Austin lived so splendidly," he whispered
to Miss Gay, as they entered the big hall.</p>

<p>But she was past speech now&mdash;a thoroughly scared girl; and she
lost no time in following a maid into the elevator, whither Seabury
presently followed her in tow of a man-servant.</p>

<p>"Luxury! Great Scott," thought Seabury. "This dubbing a palace
a cottage is the worse sort of affectation, and I'll tell Jack
Austin so, too."</p>

<p>The elevator stopped; the doors clicked open; Seabury turned
smilingly to Cecil Gay, but she hurried past him, crimson-cheeked,
head bent, and he followed his pilot to his room.</p>

<p>"Dinner is hannounced at 'awf awfter height, sir," announced
the man with dignity.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Seabury, watching a valet do sleight-of-hand
tricks with the contents of his suit-case. And when he was alone
he hopped nimbly out of his apparel and into a bath and out again
in a high state of excitement, talking to himself all the while
he was dressing.</p>

<p>"Good old Jack! The Mrs. must have had the means to do this sort
of thing so well. I'm delighted!&mdash;de&mdash;lighted!... If ever a man
deserved affluence, it's Jack Austin! It suits him. It will do
him good. It becomes him.... Plucky fellow to go on grinding at
the law!... Only thing to do, of course&mdash;decent thing to do&mdash;self-respect
and all that.... But, by jingo!"&mdash;he looked about him as he stood
buttoning his collar. "Hah!" stepping to the wall and examining
a picture&mdash;"Great Jenkins!&mdash;why, here's a real Fortuny&mdash;in a <em>bedroom</em>!"</p>

<p>He cared for good pictures, and he stood before the exquisite
aquarelle as long as he dared. Then, glancing at his watch, he
completed his toilet, opened his door, and, scorning the lift,
fled blithely down the great staircase on pleasing bent&mdash;and on
being pleased.</p>

<p>A big drawing-room, charmingly lighted, and gay already with
the chatter and laughter of a very jolly throng&mdash;this is what
confronted him as a servant offered him a tray containing cards.</p>

<p>"I don't see my name here," he said, examining the slim envelopes.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir&mdash;what name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Seabury."</p>

<p>The servant looked and Seabury looked in vain.</p>

<p>"An oversight," commented the young fellow, coolly. "I'll ask
Mrs. Austin about it." And he walked in, and, singling out the
hostess, advanced with smiling confidence, thinking to himself:
"She <em>is</em> pretty; Jack's right. But&mdash;but, by George!&mdash;she
looks like Cecil Gay!"</p>

<p>His hostess received him very charmingly, saying that it was
so good of him to come; and he said it was so good of her to have
asked him, and then they said several similar things. He spoke
of Jack&mdash;mentioning him and continuing to another subject; and
she smiled a trifle uncertainly. Her smile was still more vague
and uncertain when he laughingly mentioned the dinner-cards; and
she said it was a vexing oversight and would be immediately arranged&mdash;glancing
rather sharply at an amiable gentleman standing near her. And
this amiable gentleman came up to Seabury and shook hands very
cordially, and said several agreeable things to which Seabury
responded, until new arrivals separated him from his hostess and
the amiable gentleman, and he fell back and glanced about him.
And, after a little while an odd expression came into his eyes;
he stood very still; a slight flush slowly spread over his face
which had grown firmer. In a few moments the color went as it
had come, slowly; the faint glitter died out in his eyes.</p>

<p>There were several people he knew among the guests; he nodded
quietly to young Van Guilder, to Brimwell and others, then crossed
to speak to Catherine Hyland and Dorothy Minster. He was very
agreeable, but a little distrait. He seemed to have something
on his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his hostess was saying to her husband: "Who <em>is</em>
that, Jim?" And her husband said: "You can search me. Didn't you
ask him?" And his wife responded: "He's talking to nearly everybody.
It's curious, isn't it?" Here she was interrupted by the flushed
entrance of her unmarried sister, Cecil Gay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Seabury was saying coolly: "I haven't seen Jack yet."</p>

<p>"Jack?" repeated Dorothy Minster. "Which Jack?"</p>

<p>"Jack Austin."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Miss Minster, who did not know him; "is he to be here?"</p>

<p>But Seabury only smiled vaguely. His mind, his eyes, his attention
were fixed upon a vision of loveliness in the foreground&mdash;a charmingly
flushed young girl who knew everybody and was evidently a tremendous
favorite, judging from the gay greetings, the little volleys of
laughter, and the animated stirring of groups among which she
passed.</p>

<p>Watching her, quite oblivious to his surroundings, the servant
at his elbow was obliged to cough discreetly half a dozen times
and repeat "Beg pardon, sir," before he turned to notice the silver
salver extended.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;thank you," he said, picking up an envelope directed, "Mr.
Seabury," and opening it. Then a trifle surprised but smiling,
he turned to find the girl whose name was written on the card.
She was speaking to the hostess and the amiable man who had first
greeted him. And this is what he didn't hear as he watched her,
waiting grimly for a chance at her:</p>

<p>"Cecil! <em>Who</em> is that very young man?"</p>

<p>"Betty, how should <em>I</em> know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Cis," from the amiable gentleman; "this is some of
your deviltry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>thank</em> you, Jim!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. Who is he and where did you rope him?"</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>"Cecil! What nonsense is this?" demanded her hostess and elder
sister. "How did he get here and who is he?"</p>

<p>"I did <em>not</em> bring him, Betty. He simply came?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"In the depot-sleigh, of course&#11834;"</p>

<p>"With <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. He wanted to come. He <em>would</em> come! I couldn't
turn him out, could <em>I&mdash;</em>after he climbed in?"</p>

<p>Host and hostess glared at their flushed and defiant relative,
who tried to look saucy, but only looked scared. "<em>He</em>
doesn't know he's made a mistake," she faltered; "and there's
no need to tell him yet&mdash;is there?... I put my name down on his
card; he'll take me in.... Jim, don't, for Heaven's sake, say
anything if he calls Betty Mrs. Austin. Oh, Jim, be decent, please!
I <em>was</em> a fool to do it; I don't know what possessed me!
Wait until to-morrow before you say anything! Besides, he may
be furious! Please wait until I'm out of the house. He'll breakfast
late, I hope; and I promise you I'll be up early and off by the
seven o'clock train&#11834;"</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, who <em>is</em> he?" broke in the amiable
man so fiercely that Cecil jumped.</p>

<p>"He's only Lily Seabury's brother," she said, meekly, "and he
thinks he's at the Austins'&mdash;and he might as well be, because
he knows half the people here, and I've simply <em>got</em> to
keep him out of their way so that nobody can tell him where he
is. Oh, Betty &mdash;I've spoiled my own Christmas fun, and his,
too! <em>Is</em> there any way to get him to the Austins' now?'</p>

<p>"The Jack Austins' of Beverly!" exclaimed her sister, incredulously.
"Of course not!"</p>

<p>"And you <em>let</em> him think he was on his way there?" demanded
her brother-in-law. "Well&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;the&mdash;limit!"</p>

<p>"So is <em>he</em>," murmured the abashed maid, slinking back
to give place to a new and last arrival. Then she turned her guilty
face in a sort of panic of premonition. She was a true prophetess;
Seabury had seen his chance and was coming. And <em>that's</em>
what comes of mocking the Mystic Three and cutting capers before
High Heaven.</p>
