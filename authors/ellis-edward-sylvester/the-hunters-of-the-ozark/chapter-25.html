<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe remained in the vicinity of the Winnebago
camp until the warriors made their start at an early hour the
following morning. He took more than one survey of the red men,
who gathered about the blazing fire and talked over the remarkable
events of the night. He could easily have slain every one of the
scouts whom they kept moving through the wood, but he had no wish
to do so.</p>

<p>He heard and saw enough to convince him that they intended to
make an attack on the camp in the mountains, but he did not feel
absolutely sure that they would not turn aside and follow in the
path of the Wolf and Wau-ko-mia-tan, until the party had advanced
several miles to the southward along the Ozark trail.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that the Winnebagos paid no attention to the
two missing warriors, and yet, after all, it was not singular.
They knew they were dead and it was therefore a waste of time
to give heed to them. If by any possibility they were alive, they
must take care of themselves, just as all brave Indians did: if
unable to do so, the consequences must be on their own heads.</p>

<p>So the ten Winnebagos, under the lead of the famous chieftain
Black Bear, moved along the trail in the direction of the camp
of the Hunters of the Ozark, and the expressions and words that
had been overheard by the watchful Shawanoe, left no doubt that
by way of revenge they meant to slay the three trappers who had
located there for the winter.</p>

<p>The Winnebagos came from the north-east. Their lodges, villages
and hunting grounds were many moons' travel away, and the section
of country through which they were journeying was so sparsely
settled that they had no fear of pursuit. Now, when you give an
American Indian the chance to commit some vicious mischief with
no fear of being made to pay therefor, you may set it down as
a truth that nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every one thousand
will commit that crime. It was a matter of indifference, in the
first place, whether they harmed the hunters or not. Since the
latter were removed some distance from their path, it is probable
that they would not at that time have taken the trouble to go
in quest of them: it was the feeling of revenge that was the deciding
weight in the scale.</p>

<p>Let us recall the situation as it was on the second morning after
Fred Linden and Terry Clark left their homes in Greville. The
boys themselves were the furthest advanced along the trail to
the mountains, while at a considerable distance behind, filed
the ten Winnebago warriors, and hovering in the vicinity was Deerfoot
the Shawanoe, watching every movement with the vigilance of a
lynx.</p>

<p>Whenever he chose he could make a circuit around the Winnebagos,
and joining the boys beyond, hasten to the hunters' camp and apprise
them of their danger; but there remained an abundance of time
in which to do that, and he did not wish to leave the vicinity
of the enemies until he saw a little more of them.</p>

<p>It was evident that the Winnebagos were in no hurry. They must
have known that two of the youths were following the trail in
advance, for the heavy shoes of the lads could not fail to leave
their imprints in many places; but, such being the case, the red
men might ask in what manner they could know that a party of Winnebagos
were following them, unless such knowledge came through Deerfoot
the Shawanoe, who, wherever he might be, certainly was not in
front of them.</p>

<p>When the Indians came to a stream of water, they did not rush
in and wade or swim to the other side, as they would have done
had there been any call for haste, but like those who had gone
before, they stopped long enough to make a raft on which they
could float across. The American Indian is not as fond of water
as he should be, and though the Winnebagos would have cared little
for the chill of the stream, it was more pleasant for them to
pass over dry shod; so they made their several rafts and poled
themselves to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>You would not look for humor under such circumstances, and yet
on one of the three rafts there was so much of it shown that even
the grim Shawanoe smiled.</p>

<p>The structures on which the red men floated were, as a matter
of course, of the frailest nature, intended as they were to last
only long enough to bear them to the other shore. With proper
management, all would have done this, but on one of the rafts
holding four of the warriors, there was an aboriginal wag. A single
Indian managed the pole, while the others squatted carefully in
their respective positions and were expected to keep quiet, so
as not to disintegrate the frail structure.</p>

<p>The wag to whom I have referred, while sitting with an innocent
expression on his painted countenance, quietly loosened the two
or three withes, and gave the logs such an impetus that they separated
like two bodies positively charged with electricity, when brought
together. The warrior who handled the pole was standing with legs
somewhat apart, resting on a different log, when they suddenly
separated still more, and he sat down with a splash in the water.
Another log revolved backwards, as did the savage who was sitting
on it, while the others were also plashing in the stream, which
was not deep enough to make them swim, though it came to the neck
of the shortest one. The four warriors waded to shore amid the
grins of the others, and with no suspicion of the criminal that
had played the trick upon them.</p>

<p>The next stream was reached by the Indians a couple of hours
later. This was not as deep as the other and they did not stop
to make rafts. After a little searching, they found a portion
where the current did not come above their knees and they waded.</p>

<p>In doing so, Black Bear took the lead, and, in accordance with
a custom universal among Indians, each warrior carefully stepped
into the footprints in front of him. The water was so limpid that
the impression made by the chieftain's moccasin was plainly shown,
so that there was no difficulty in this respect. Had a person
been trailing them, he would have seen before him what seemed
to be the footprints of a single man. There was but a slight variation
near the further shore, where the moccasin of one of the Winnebagos
had slid from a stone on which, like all the others, it was placed.
The brown stone was slippery with a faint coating of slime, and
the scrape of the deerskin down the side gave it a white gleam
like the belly of a fish. It was a "slip" in every sense, and,
when the slight splash announced it, Black Bear at the head of
the procession turned about with his most impressive scowl.</p>

<p>The party made a halt on the other bank. It was considerably
past noon, and, while some busied themselves in starting a fire,
and a couple began fishing in the stream, two others going into
the woods with their guns, Deerfoot was quite sure that they had
decided to spend an hour or so for dinner. He concluded, however,
to follow the two who went into the woods, and it was fortunate
that he did so.</p>

<p>The first surprise that came to him was when the Winnebagos had
gone nearly an eighth of a mile from camp. All this time they
were making their way up quite a steep slope, so that they were
close to the top of a high, wooded ridge.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe might well wonder why they had taken such a course,
but when two frightened deer burst through the undergrowth and
dashed by at full speed, within easy gun shot, and the Winnebagos
looked at them without raising their guns to fire, then it was
that Deerfoot was genuinely astonished.</p>

<p>The conclusion was inevitable that these red men were not looking
for game.</p>

<p>With a suspicion of their real errand (and that caused another
surprise), Deerfoot stealthily followed the Winnebagos until they
paused on the highest part of the ridge. He was not long kept
in doubt as to their business.</p>

<p>The top of the ridge was almost bare. There were a few stunted
trees, a number of bowlders and rocks, and here and there, patches
of scraggly grass. From this elevation, however, a magnificent
view opened out on every hand before the spectator. To the north
stretched the undulating country covered with prairie, stream,
valley and forest, the last brilliant with all the gorgeous hues
that come with the frosts of autumn.</p>

<p>These flaming colors were visible in whatever direction the eye
turned, and the same varied surface was seen everywhere, but to
the southward, the Ozark Mountains had a faint bluish tinge, like
a mass of clouds resting in the horizon. It was in that direction
that the camp of the hunters lay, and thither the footsteps of
pale face and redskin were directed.</p>

<p>The two Winnebagos spent only a minute or so in scanning the
surrounding country, when they began gathering wood, until they
had quite a pile. A quantity of leaves, some of which were damp,
was mixed among the twigs, so that when with a little trouble
they were fired by means of the flint and steel in the hands of
one of the red men, the fuel did not burn clearly but gave off
considerable dark smoke, which was what the Winnebagos wanted.</p>

<p>As soon as the fire was fairly burning, one of the Indians flung
his blanket over it, his friend seizing the other part, while
both held it thus until it was in danger of taking fire or smothering
the flames. Had the coarse cloth been a little more cleanly it
is likely that it would have been burned, but as it was it strangled
the blaze until it may be said there were several bushels of smoke
gathered beneath and the embers were at their last gasp.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Indians raised the blanket so that they stood
upright, and plenty of fresh air was allowed to feed the blaze.
Then they slowly waved the blanket between them, sometimes lowering
it until it was scorched by the sleepy flames, and then elevating
it above their heads. All the time, they manipulated the blanket,
sometimes straight up and down, sometimes diagonally, and indeed,
in every possible way.</p>

<p>The result of all this varied swinging was that the black column
of vapor which slowly climbed the sky, was broken into circles,
spiral curves, and all sorts of odd-shaped figures, which did
not dissolve for several minutes in the clear air above.</p>

<p>I need not tell you what this meant, for in another place I have
described the same thing. It was a signal fire intended by the
Winnebagos for the eyes of a party of friends who were too far
off to be reached in any other way. Deerfoot had seen such telegraphy
many a time and oft, and more than once he had used it. He could
interpret such a signal when made by a Shawanoe, Wyandotte, Sauk
or Fox, but he had never learned the code in use by the Winnebago
military authorities.</p>

<p>However, it was not possible that there was any very fine shade
of meaning in the various manipulations of the two warriors. Keen
brained as is the American Indian, he is unable to do a great
many things with which he is credited: one of these is to do more
than telegraph the simplest messages by means of fire, though
it is beyond question that important tidings has been flashed
hundreds of miles in a single night, from mountain top to mountain
top, by means of the signal fires of the Indians.</p>

<p>What disturbed Deerfoot was this proof that there was a second
party of Winnebagos in that section of the country. He had not
dreamed of such a thing, and it might well cause him alarm, that
is, for the three men who were so intent on gathering their furs
comparatively a short distance away.</p>

<p>Carefully screening himself from observation, the Shawanoe looked
intently in the direction of the gaze of the Winnebagos. He saw
that they were not peering at any other ridge, but at the broad
low valley to the north-west. They had not long to look when they
detected a thin bluish column of smoke creeping upward among the
tree tops and dissolving in the clear air above.</p>

<p>Deerfoot also saw it, and he knew that it was a reply to the
first signal. There was another party of Winnebagos in the neighborhood;
they would soon join Black Bear's party, and there was no time
for delay. Indeed, but for the discovery he had made, the Shawanoe
would have felt that he had tarried too long already.</p>

<p>It was not far now to the camp of the Hunters of the Ozark, and
it was perilous to wait to warn them. Every hour counted. Not
only that, but, as you can readily see, Fred Linden and Terry
Clark were in still greater danger.</p>
