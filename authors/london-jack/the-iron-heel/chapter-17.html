With the destruction of the Granger states, the Grangers in
Congress disappeared.  They were being tried for high treason, and
their places were taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel.  The
socialists were in a pitiful minority, and they knew that their end
was near.  Congress and the Senate were empty pretences, farces.
Public questions were gravely debated and passed upon according to
the old forms, while in reality all that was done was to give the
stamp of constitutional procedure to the mandates of the Oligarchy.
<P>
Ernest was in the thick of the fight when the end came.  It was in
the debate on the bill to assist the unemployed.  The hard times of
the preceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat
beneath the starvation line, and the continued and wide-reaching
disorder had but sunk them deeper.  Millions of people were
starving, while the oligarchs and their supporters were surfeiting
on the surplus.*  We called these wretched people the people of the
abyss,** and it was to alleviate their awful suffering that the
socialists had introduced the unemployed bill.  But this was not to
the fancy of the Iron Heel.  In its own way it was preparing to set
these millions to work, but the way was not our way, wherefore it
had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down.  Ernest
and his fellows knew that their effort was futile, but they were
tired of the suspense.  They wanted something to happen.  They were
accomplishing nothing, and the best they hoped for was the putting
of an end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling
players.  They knew not what end would come, but they never
anticipated a more disastrous end than the one that did come.
<P>
<P>
* The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century A.D.
under British rule in India.  The natives died of starvation by the
million, while their rulers robbed them of the fruits of their toil
and expended it on magnificent pageants and mumbo-jumbo fooleries.
Perforce, in this enlightened age, we have much to blush for in the
acts of our ancestors.  Our only consolation is philosophic.  We
must accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as about on
a par with the earlier monkey stage.  The human had to pass through
those stages in its rise from the mire and slime of low organic
life.  It was inevitable that much of the mire and slime should
cling and be not easily shaken off.
<P>
** The people of the abyss--this phrase was struck out by the
genius of H. G. Wells in the late nineteenth century A.D.  Wells
was a sociological seer, sane and normal as well as warm human.
Many fragments of his work have come down to us, while two of his
greatest achievements, "Anticipations" and "Mankind in the Making,"
have come down intact.  Before the oligarchs, and before Everhard,
Wells speculated upon the building of the wonder cities, though in
his writings they are referred to as "pleasure cities."
<P>
<P>
I sat in the gallery that day.  We all knew that something terrible
was imminent.  It was in the air, and its presence was made visible
by the armed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors, and by
the officers grouped in the entrances to the House itself.  The
Oligarchy was about to strike.  Ernest was speaking.  He was
describing the sufferings of the unemployed, as if with the wild
idea of in some way touching their hearts and consciences; but the
Republican and Democratic members sneered and jeered at him, and
there was uproar and confusion.  Ernest abruptly changed front.
<P>
"I know nothing that I may say can influence you," he said.  "You
have no souls to be influenced.  You are spineless, flaccid things.
You pompously call yourselves Republicans and Democrats.  There is
no Republican Party.  There is no Democratic Party.  There are no
Republicans nor Democrats in this House.  You are lick-spittlers
and panderers, the creatures of the Plutocracy.  You talk verbosely
in antiquated terminology of your love of liberty, and all the
while you wear the scarlet livery of the Iron Heel."
<P>
Here the shouting and the cries of "Order! order!" drowned his
voice, and he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat
subsided.  He waved his hand to include all of them, turned to his
own comrades, and said:
<P>
"Listen to the bellowing of the well-fed beasts."
<P>
Pandemonium broke out again.  The Speaker rapped for order and
glanced expectantly at the officers in the doorways.  There were
cries of "Sedition!" and a great, rotund New York member began
shouting "Anarchist!" at Ernest.  And Ernest was not pleasant to
look at.  Every fighting fibre of him was quivering, and his face
was the face of a fighting animal, withal he was cool and
collected.
<P>
"Remember," he said, in a voice that made itself heard above the
din, "that as you show mercy now to the proletariat, some day will
that same proletariat show mercy to you."
<P>
The cries of "Sedition!" and "Anarchist!" redoubled.
<P>
"I know that you will not vote for this bill," Ernest went on.
"You have received the command from your masters to vote against
it.  And yet you call me anarchist.  You, who have destroyed the
government of the people, and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet
shame in public places, call me anarchist.  I do not believe in
hell-fire and brimstone; but in moments like this I regret my
unbelief.  Nay, in moments like this I almost do believe.  Surely
there must be a hell, for in no less place could it be possible for
you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes.  So long as you
exist, there is a vital need for hell-fire in the Cosmos."
<P>
There was movement in the doorways.  Ernest, the Speaker, all the
members turned to see.
<P>
"Why do you not call your soldiers in, Mr. Speaker, and bid them do
their work?"  Ernest demanded.  "They should carry out your plan
with expedition."
<P>
"There are other plans afoot," was the retort.  "That is why the
soldiers are present."
<P>
"Our plans, I suppose," Ernest sneered.  "Assassination or
something kindred."
<P>
But at the word "assassination" the uproar broke out again.  Ernest
could not make himself heard, but he remained on his feet waiting
for a lull.  And then it happened.  From my place in the gallery I
saw nothing except the flash of the explosion.  The roar of it
filled my ears and I saw Ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of
smoke, and the soldiers rushing up all the aisles.  His comrades
were on their feet, wild with anger, capable of any violence.  But
Ernest steadied himself for a moment, and waved his arms for
silence.
<P>
"It is a plot!" his voice rang out in warning to his comrades.  "Do
nothing, or you will be destroyed."
<P>
Then he slowly sank down, and the soldiers reached him.  The next
moment soldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more.
<P>
Though he was my husband, I was not permitted to get to him.  When
I announced who I was, I was promptly placed under arrest.  And at
the same time were arrested all socialist Congressmen in
Washington, including the unfortunate Simpson, who lay ill with
typhoid fever in his hotel.
<P>
The trial was prompt and brief.  The men were foredoomed.  The
wonder was that Ernest was not executed.  This was a blunder on the
part of the Oligarchy, and a costly one.  But the Oligarchy was too
confident in those days.  It was drunk with success, and little did
it dream that that small handful of heroes had within them the
power to rock it to its foundations.  To-morrow, when the Great
Revolt breaks out and all the world resounds with the tramp, tramp
of the millions, the Oligarchy, will realize, and too late, how
mightily that band of heroes has grown.*
<P>
<P>
* Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be read
in her own day, and so omits to mention the outcome of the trial
for high treason.  Many other similar disconcerting omissions will
be noticed in the Manuscript.  Fifty-two socialist Congressmen were
tried, and all were found guilty.  Strange to relate, not one
received the death sentence.  Everhard and eleven others, among
whom were Theodore Donnelson and Matthew Kent, received life
imprisonment.  The remaining forty received sentences varying from
thirty to forty-five years; while Arthur Simpson, referred to in
the Manuscript as being ill of typhoid fever at the time of the
explosion, received only fifteen years.  It is the tradition that
he died of starvation in solitary confinement, and this harsh
treatment is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising
stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men that
served the despotism.  He died in Cabanas in Cuba, where three of
his comrades were also confined.  The fifty-two socialist
Congressmen were confined in military fortresses scattered all over
the United States.  Thus, Du Bois and Woods were held in Porto
Rico, while Everhard and Merryweather were placed in Alcatraz, an
island in San Francisco Bay that had already seen long service as a
military prison.
<P>
<P>
As a revolutionist myself, as one on the inside who knew the hopes
and fears and secret plans of the revolutionists, I am fitted to
answer, as very few are, the charge that they were guilty of
exploding the bomb in Congress.  And I can say flatly, without
qualification or doubt of any sort, that the socialists, in
Congress and out, had no hand in the affair.  Who threw the bomb we
do not know, but the one thing we are absolutely sure of is that we
did not throw it.
<P>
On the other hand, there is evidence to show that the Iron Heel was
responsible for the act.  Of course, we cannot prove this.  Our
conclusion is merely presumptive.  But here are such facts as we do
know.  It had been reported to the Speaker of the House, by secret-
service agents of the government, that the Socialist Congressmen
were about to resort to terroristic tactics, and that they had
decided upon the day when their tactics would go into effect.  This 
day was the very day of the explosion.  Wherefore the Capitol had
been packed with troops in anticipation.  Since we knew nothing
about the bomb, and since a bomb actually was exploded, and since
the authorities had prepared in advance for the explosion, it is
only fair to conclude that the Iron Heel did know.  Furthermore, we
charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of the outrage, and that the
Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for the purpose of
foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about our
destruction.
<P>
From the Speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in the
House that wore the scarlet livery.  They knew, while Ernest was
speaking, that some violent act was to be committed.  And to do
them justice, they honestly believed that the act was to be
committed by the socialists.  At the trial, and still with honest
belief, several testified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw
the bomb, and that it exploded prematurely.  Of course they saw
nothing of the sort.  In the fevered imagination of fear they
thought they saw, that was all.
<P>
As Ernest said at the trial: "Does it stand to reason, if I were
going to throw a bomb, that I should elect to throw a feeble little
squib like the one that was thrown?  There wasn't enough powder in
it.  It made a lot of smoke, but hurt no one except me.  It
exploded right at my feet, and yet it did not kill me.  Believe me,
when I get to throwing bombs, I'll do damage.  There'll be more
than smoke in my petards."
<P>
In return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the
bomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists, just as its
premature explosion, caused by Ernest's losing his nerve and
dropping it, was a blunder.  And to clinch the argument, there were
the several Congressmen who testified to having seen Ernest fumble
and drop the bomb.
<P>
As for ourselves, not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown.
Ernest told me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded
he both heard and saw it strike at his feet.  He testified to this
at the trial, but no one believed him.  Besides, the whole thing,
in popular slang, was "cooked up."  The Iron Heel had made up its
mind to destroy us, and there was no withstanding it.
<P>
There is a saying that truth will out.  I have come to doubt that
saying.  Nineteen years have elapsed, and despite our untiring
efforts, we have failed to find the man who really did throw the
bomb.  Undoubtedly he was some emissary of the Iron Heel, but he
has escaped detection.  We have never got the slightest clew to his
identity.  And now, at this late date, nothing remains but for the
affair to take its place among the mysteries of history.*
<P>
<P>
* Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations ere she
could have seen the clearing up of this particular mystery.  A
little less than a hundred years ago, and a little more than six
hundred years after the death, the confession of Pervaise was
discovered in the secret archives of the Vatican.  It is perhaps
well to tell a little something about this obscure document, which,
in the main, is of interest to the historian only.
<P>
Pervaise was an American, of French descent, who in 1913 A.D., was
lying in the Tombs Prison, New York City, awaiting trial for
murder.  From his confession we learn that he was not a criminal.
He was warm-blooded, passionate, emotional.  In an insane fit of
jealousy he killed his wife--a very common act in those times.
Pervaise was mastered by the fear of death, all of which is
recounted at length in his confession.  To escape death he would
have done anything, and the police agents prepared him by assuring
him that he could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the
first degree when his trial came off.  In those days, murder in the
first degree was a capital offense.  The guilty man or woman was
placed in a specially constructed death-chair, and, under the
supervision of competent physicians, was destroyed by a current of
electricity.  This was called electrocution, and it was very
popular during that period.  Anaesthesia, as a mode of compulsory
death, was not introduced until later.
<P>
This man, good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close at the
surface of his being, lying in jail and expectant of nothing less
than death, was prevailed upon by the agents of the Iron Heel to
throw the bomb in the House of Representatives.  In his confession
he states explicitly that he was informed that the bomb was to be a
feeble thing and that no lives would be lost.  This is directly in
line with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged, and that its
explosion at Everhard's feet was not deadly.
<P>
Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly closed
for repairs.  He was to select the moment for the throwing of the
bomb, and he naively confesses that in his interest in Everhard's
tirade and the general commotion raised thereby, he nearly forgot
his mission.
<P>
Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed, but he
was granted an income for life.  This he did not long enjoy.  In
1914 A.D., in September, he was stricken with rheumatism of the
heart and lived for three days.  It was then that he sent for the
Catholic priest, Father Peter Durban, and to him made confession.
So important did it seem to the priest, that he had the confession
taken down in writing and sworn to.  What happened after this we
can only surmise.  The document was certainly important enough to
find its way to Rome.  Powerful influences must have been brought
to bear, hence its suppression.  For centuries no hint of its
existence reached the world.  It was not until in the last century
that Lorbia, the brilliant Italian scholar, stumbled upon it quite
by chance during his researches in the Vatican.
<P>
There is to-day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was
responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of
Representatives in 1913 A.D.  Even though the Pervaise confession
had never come to light, no reasonable doubt could obtain; for the
act in question, that sent fifty-two Congressmen to prison, was on
a par with countless other acts committed by the oligarchs, and,
before them, by the capitalists.
<P>
There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton judicial
murder of the innocent and so-called Haymarket Anarchists in
Chicago in the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century A.D.
In a category by itself is the deliberate burning and destruction
of capitalist property by the capitalists themselves.  For such
destruction of property innocent men were frequently punished--
"railroaded" in the parlance of the times.
<P>
In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth century
A.D., between the capitalists and the Western Federation of Miners,
similar but more bloody tactics were employed.  The railroad
station at Independence was blown up by the agents of the
capitalists.  Thirteen men were killed, and many more were wounded.
And then the capitalists, controlling the legislative and judicial
machinery of the state of Colorado, charged the miners with the
crime and came very near to convicting them.  Romaines, one of the
tools in this affair, like Pervaise, was lying in jail in another
state, Kansas, awaiting trial, when he was approached by the agents
of the capitalists.  But, unlike Pervaise the confession of
Romaines was made public in his own time.
<P>
Then, during this same period, there was the case of Moyer and
Haywood, two strong, fearless leaders of labor.  One was president
and the other was secretary of the Western Federation of Miners.
The ex-governor of Idaho had been mysteriously murdered.  The
crime, at the time, was openly charged to the mine owners by the
socialists and miners.  Nevertheless, in violation of the national
and state constitutions, and by means of conspiracy on the parts of
the governors of Idaho and Colorado, Moyer and Haywood were
kidnapped, thrown into jail, and charged with the murder.  It was
this instance that provoked from Eugene V. Debs, national leader of
the American socialists at the time, the following words: "The
labor leaders that cannot be bribed nor bullied, must be ambushed
and murdered.  The only crime of Moyer and Haywood is that they
have been unswervingly true to the working class.  The capitalists
have stolen our country, debauched our politics, defiled our
judiciary, and ridden over us rough-shod, and now they propose to
murder those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal
dominion.  The governors of Colorado and Idaho are but executing
the mandates of their masters, the Plutocracy.  The issue is the
Workers versus the Plutocracy.  If they strike the first violent
blow, we will strike the last."
