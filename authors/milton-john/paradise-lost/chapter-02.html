 <BR>
High on a Throne of Royal State, which far <BR>
Outshon the wealth of ORMUS and of IND, <BR>
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand <BR>
Showrs on her Kings BARBARIC Pearl &amp; Gold, <BR>
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd <BR>
To that bad eminence; and from despair <BR>
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires <BR>
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue <BR>
Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught <BR>
His proud imaginations thus displaid. <BR>
<BR>
  Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n, <BR>
For since no deep within her gulf can hold <BR>
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, <BR>
I give not Heav'n for lost.  From this descent <BR>
Celestial vertues rising, will appear <BR>
More glorious and more dread then from no fall, <BR>
And trust themselves to fear no second fate: <BR>
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n <BR>
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice, <BR>
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, <BR>
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss <BR>
Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more <BR>
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne <BR>
Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state <BR>
In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw <BR>
Envy from each inferior; but who here <BR>
Will envy whom the highest place exposes <BR>
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime <BR>
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share <BR>
Of endless pain? where there is then no good <BR>
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there <BR>
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell <BR>
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small <BR>
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind <BR>
Will covet more.  With this advantage then <BR>
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, <BR>
More then can be in Heav'n, we now return <BR>
To claim our just inheritance of old, <BR>
Surer to prosper then prosperity <BR>
Could have assur'd us; and by what best way, <BR>
Whether of open Warr or covert guile, <BR>
We now debate; who can advise, may speak. <BR>
<BR>
  He ceas'd, and next him MOLOC, Scepter'd King <BR>
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit <BR>
That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair: <BR>
His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd <BR>
Equal in strength, and rather then be less <BR>
Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost <BR>
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse <BR>
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake. <BR>
<BR>
  My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, <BR>
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those <BR>
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. <BR>
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, <BR>
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait <BR>
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here <BR>
Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place <BR>
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, <BR>
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns <BR>
By our delay? no, let us rather choose <BR>
Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once <BR>
O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way, <BR>
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms <BR>
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise <BR>
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear <BR>
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see <BR>
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage <BR>
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self <BR>
Mixt with TARTAREAN Sulphur, and strange fire, <BR>
His own invented Torments.  But perhaps <BR>
The way seems difficult and steep to scale <BR>
With upright wing against a higher foe. <BR>
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench <BR>
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still, <BR>
That in our proper motion we ascend <BR>
Up to our native seat: descent and fall <BR>
To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late <BR>
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear <BR>
Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep, <BR>
With what compulsion and laborious flight <BR>
We sunk thus low?  Th' ascent is easie then; <BR>
Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke <BR>
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find <BR>
To our destruction: if there be in Hell <BR>
Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse <BR>
Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd <BR>
In this abhorred deep to utter woe; <BR>
Where pain of unextinguishable fire <BR>
Must exercise us without hope of end <BR>
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge <BR>
Inexorably, and the torturing houre <BR>
Calls us to Penance?  More destroy'd then thus <BR>
We should be quite abolisht and expire. <BR>
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense <BR>
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, <BR>
Will either quite consume us, and reduce <BR>
To nothing this essential, happier farr <BR>
Then miserable to have eternal being: <BR>
Or if our substance be indeed Divine, <BR>
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst <BR>
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel <BR>
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n, <BR>
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, <BR>
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: <BR>
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. <BR>
<BR>
  He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd <BR>
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous <BR>
To less then Gods.  On th' other side up rose <BR>
BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane; <BR>
A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd <BR>
For dignity compos'd and high exploit: <BR>
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue <BR>
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear <BR>
The better reason, to perplex and dash <BR>
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; <BR>
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds <BR>
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare, <BR>
And with perswasive accent thus began. <BR>
<BR>
  I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, <BR>
As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd <BR>
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, <BR>
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast <BR>
Ominous conjecture on the whole success: <BR>
When he who most excels in fact of Arms, <BR>
In what he counsels and in what excels <BR>
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair <BR>
And utter dissolution, as the scope <BR>
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. <BR>
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd <BR>
With Armed watch, that render all access <BR>
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep <BR>
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing <BR>
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, <BR>
Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way <BR>
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise <BR>
With blackest Insurrection, to confound <BR>
Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie <BR>
All incorruptible would on his Throne <BR>
Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould <BR>
Incapable of stain would soon expel <BR>
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire <BR>
Victorious.  Thus repuls'd, our final hope <BR>
Is flat despair: we must exasperate <BR>
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, <BR>
And that must end us, that must be our cure, <BR>
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, <BR>
Though full of pain, this intellectual being, <BR>
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, <BR>
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost <BR>
In the wide womb of uncreated night, <BR>
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, <BR>
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe <BR>
Can give it, or will ever? how he can <BR>
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. <BR>
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, <BR>
Belike through impotence, or unaware, <BR>
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end <BR>
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves <BR>
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? <BR>
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, <BR>
Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; <BR>
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, <BR>
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, <BR>
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? <BR>
What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook <BR>
With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought <BR>
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd <BR>
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay <BR>
Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. <BR>
What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires <BR>
Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage <BR>
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above <BR>
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again <BR>
His red right hand to plague us? what if all <BR>
Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament <BR>
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, <BR>
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall <BR>
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps <BR>
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, <BR>
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd <BR>
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey <BR>
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk <BR>
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; <BR>
There to converse with everlasting groans, <BR>
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, <BR>
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. <BR>
Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike <BR>
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile <BR>
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye <BR>
Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth <BR>
All these our motions vain, sees and derides; <BR>
Not more Almighty to resist our might <BR>
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. <BR>
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n <BR>
Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here <BR>
Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse <BR>
By my advice; since fate inevitable <BR>
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, <BR>
The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe, <BR>
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust <BR>
That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, <BR>
If we were wise, against so great a foe <BR>
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. <BR>
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold <BR>
And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear <BR>
What yet they know must follow, to endure <BR>
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, <BR>
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now <BR>
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, <BR>
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit <BR>
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd <BR>
Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd <BR>
With what is punish't; whence these raging fires <BR>
Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. <BR>
Our purer essence then will overcome <BR>
Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, <BR>
Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd <BR>
In temper and in nature, will receive <BR>
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; <BR>
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, <BR>
Besides what hope the never-ending flight <BR>
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change <BR>
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers <BR>
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, <BR>
If we procure not to our selves more woe. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb <BR>
Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, <BR>
Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n <BR>
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain <BR>
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then <BR>
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild <BR>
To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife: <BR>
The former vain to hope argues as vain <BR>
The latter: for what place can be for us <BR>
Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream <BR>
We overpower?  Suppose he should relent <BR>
And publish Grace to all, on promise made <BR>
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we <BR>
Stand in his presence humble, and receive <BR>
Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne <BR>
With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing <BR>
Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits <BR>
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes <BR>
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, <BR>
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task <BR>
In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom <BR>
Eternity so spent in worship paid <BR>
To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue <BR>
By force impossible, by leave obtain'd <BR>
Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state <BR>
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek <BR>
Our own good from our selves, and from our own <BR>
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, <BR>
Free, and to none accountable, preferring <BR>
Hard liberty before the easie yoke <BR>
Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear <BR>
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, <BR>
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse <BR>
We can create, and in what place so e're <BR>
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain <BR>
Through labour and endurance.  This deep world <BR>
Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst <BR>
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire <BR>
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, <BR>
And with the Majesty of darkness round <BR>
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar <BR>
Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? <BR>
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light <BR>
Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile <BR>
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; <BR>
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise <BR>
Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? <BR>
Our torments also may in length of time <BR>
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires <BR>
As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd <BR>
Into their temper; which must needs remove <BR>
The sensible of pain.  All things invite <BR>
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State <BR>
Of order, how in safety best we may <BR>
Compose our present evils, with regard <BR>
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite <BR>
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise. <BR>
<BR>
  He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld <BR>
Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain <BR>
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long <BR>
Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull <BR>
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance <BR>
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay <BR>
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard <BR>
As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, <BR>
Advising peace: for such another Field <BR>
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear <BR>
Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL <BR>
Wrought still within them; and no less desire <BR>
To found this nether Empire, which might rise <BR>
By pollicy, and long process of time, <BR>
In emulation opposite to Heav'n. <BR>
Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom, <BR>
SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave <BR>
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd <BR>
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven <BR>
Deliberation sat and publick care; <BR>
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, <BR>
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood <BR>
With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear <BR>
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look <BR>
Drew audience and attention still as Night <BR>
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. <BR>
<BR>
  Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n, <BR>
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now <BR>
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd <BR>
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote <BR>
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here <BR>
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, <BR>
And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd <BR>
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat <BR>
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt <BR>
From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League <BR>
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine <BR>
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, <BR>
Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd <BR>
His captive multitude: For he, be sure, <BR>
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign <BR>
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part <BR>
By our revolt, but over Hell extend <BR>
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule <BR>
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. <BR>
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? <BR>
Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss <BR>
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none <BR>
Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n <BR>
To us enslav'd, but custody severe, <BR>
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment <BR>
Inflicted? and what peace can we return, <BR>
But to our power hostility and hate, <BR>
Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, <BR>
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least <BR>
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce <BR>
In doing what we most in suffering feel? <BR>
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need <BR>
With dangerous expedition to invade <BR>
Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, <BR>
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find <BR>
Some easier enterprize?  There is a place <BR>
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n <BR>
Err not) another World, the happy seat <BR>
Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time <BR>
To be created like to us, though less <BR>
In power and excellence, but favour'd more <BR>
Of him who rules above; so was his will <BR>
Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, <BR>
That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. <BR>
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn <BR>
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, <BR>
Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, <BR>
And where thir weakness, how attempted best, <BR>
By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, <BR>
And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure <BR>
In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd <BR>
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left <BR>
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps <BR>
Som advantagious act may be achiev'd <BR>
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire <BR>
To waste his whole Creation, or possess <BR>
All as our own, and drive as we were driven, <BR>
The punie habitants, or if not drive, <BR>
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God <BR>
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand <BR>
Abolish his own works.  This would surpass <BR>
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy <BR>
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise <BR>
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons <BR>
Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse <BR>
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, <BR>
Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth <BR>
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here <BR>
Hatching vain Empires.  Thus BEELZEBUB <BR>
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd <BR>
By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence, <BR>
But from the Author of all ill could Spring <BR>
So deep a malice, to confound the race <BR>
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell <BR>
To mingle and involve, done all to spite <BR>
The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves <BR>
His glory to augment.  The bold design <BR>
Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy <BR>
Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent <BR>
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. <BR>
<BR>
  Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, <BR>
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, <BR>
Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep <BR>
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, <BR>
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view <BR>
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms <BR>
And opportune excursion we may chance <BR>
Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone <BR>
Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light <BR>
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam <BR>
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, <BR>
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires <BR>
Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send <BR>
In search of this new world, whom shall we find <BR>
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet <BR>
The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss <BR>
And through the palpable obscure find out <BR>
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight <BR>
Upborn with indefatigable wings <BR>
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive <BR>
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then <BR>
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe <BR>
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick <BR>
Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need <BR>
All circumspection, and we now no less <BR>
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, <BR>
The weight of all and our last hope relies. <BR>
<BR>
  This said, he sat; and expectation held <BR>
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd <BR>
To second, or oppose, or undertake <BR>
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, <BR>
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each <BR>
In others count'nance red his own dismay <BR>
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime <BR>
Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found <BR>
So hardie as to proffer or accept <BR>
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last <BR>
SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd <BR>
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride <BR>
Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, <BR>
With reason hath deep silence and demurr <BR>
Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way <BR>
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; <BR>
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, <BR>
Outrageous to devour, immures us round <BR>
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant <BR>
Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. <BR>
These past, if any pass, the void profound <BR>
Of unessential Night receives him next <BR>
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being <BR>
Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. <BR>
If thence he scape into what ever world, <BR>
Or unknown Region, what remains him less <BR>
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. <BR>
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, <BR>
And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd <BR>
With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd <BR>
And judg'd of public moment, in the shape <BR>
Of difficulty or danger could deterre <BR>
Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume <BR>
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, <BR>
Refusing to accept as great a share <BR>
Of hazard as of honour, due alike <BR>
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due <BR>
Of hazard more, as he above the rest <BR>
High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers, <BR>
Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, <BR>
While here shall be our home, what best may ease <BR>
The present misery, and render Hell <BR>
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm <BR>
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain <BR>
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch <BR>
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad <BR>
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek <BR>
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize <BR>
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose <BR>
The Monarch, and prevented all reply, <BR>
Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd <BR>
Others among the chief might offer now <BR>
(Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; <BR>
And so refus'd might in opinion stand <BR>
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute <BR>
Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they <BR>
Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice <BR>
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; <BR>
Thir rising all at once was as the sound <BR>
Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend <BR>
With awful reverence prone; and as a God <BR>
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: <BR>
Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, <BR>
That for the general safety he despis'd <BR>
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd <BR>
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast <BR>
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, <BR>
Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. <BR>
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark <BR>
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: <BR>
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds <BR>
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread <BR>
Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element <BR>
Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; <BR>
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet <BR>
Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, <BR>
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds <BR>
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. <BR>
O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn'd <BR>
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree <BR>
Of Creatures rational, though under hope <BR>
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, <BR>
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife <BR>
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, <BR>
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: <BR>
As if (which might induce us to accord) <BR>
Man had not hellish foes anow besides, <BR>
That day and night for his destruction waite. <BR>
<BR>
  The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth <BR>
In order came the grand infernal Peers, <BR>
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd <BR>
Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less <BR>
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, <BR>
And God-like imitated State; him round <BR>
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd <BR>
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. <BR>
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry <BR>
With Trumpets regal sound the great result: <BR>
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim <BR>
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie <BR>
By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss <BR>
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell <BR>
With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. <BR>
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd <BR>
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers <BR>
Disband, and wandring, each his several way <BR>
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice <BR>
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find <BR>
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain <BR>
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. <BR>
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime <BR>
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, <BR>
As at th' Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields; <BR>
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal <BR>
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. <BR>
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears <BR>
Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush <BR>
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van <BR>
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears <BR>
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms <BR>
From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. <BR>
Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell <BR>
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air <BR>
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. <BR>
As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown'd <BR>
With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore <BR>
Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines, <BR>
And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw <BR>
Into th' EUBOIC Sea.  Others more milde, <BR>
Retreated in a silent valley, sing <BR>
With notes Angelical to many a Harp <BR>
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall <BR>
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate <BR>
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. <BR>
Thir song was partial, but the harmony <BR>
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) <BR>
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment <BR>
The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet <BR>
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) <BR>
Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, <BR>
In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high <BR>
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, <BR>
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, <BR>
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. <BR>
Of good and evil much they argu'd then, <BR>
Of happiness and final misery, <BR>
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, <BR>
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: <BR>
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm <BR>
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite <BR>
Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest <BR>
With stubborn patience as with triple steel. <BR>
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, <BR>
On bold adventure to discover wide <BR>
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps <BR>
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend <BR>
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks <BR>
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge <BR>
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; <BR>
Abhorred STYX the flood of deadly hate, <BR>
Sad ACHERON of sorrow, black and deep; <BR>
COCYTUS, nam'd of lamentation loud <BR>
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce PHLEGETON <BR>
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. <BR>
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, <BR>
LETHE the River of Oblivion roules <BR>
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, <BR>
Forthwith his former state and being forgets, <BR>
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. <BR>
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent <BR>
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms <BR>
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land <BR>
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems <BR>
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, <BR>
A gulf profound as that SERBONIAN Bog <BR>
Betwixt DAMIATA and mount CASIUS old, <BR>
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air <BR>
Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. <BR>
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, <BR>
At certain revolutions all the damn'd <BR>
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change <BR>
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, <BR>
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice <BR>
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine <BR>
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, <BR>
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. <BR>
They ferry over this LETHEAN Sound <BR>
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, <BR>
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach <BR>
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose <BR>
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, <BR>
All in one moment, and so neer the brink; <BR>
But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt <BR>
MEDUSA with GORGONIAN terror guards <BR>
The Ford, and of it self the water flies <BR>
All taste of living wight, as once it fled <BR>
The lip of TANTALUS.  Thus roving on <BR>
In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands <BR>
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast <BR>
View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found <BR>
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile <BR>
They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, <BR>
O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, <BR>
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, <BR>
A Universe of death, which God by curse <BR>
Created evil, for evil only good, <BR>
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, <BR>
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, <BR>
Abominable, inutterable, and worse <BR>
Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, <BR>
GORGONS and HYDRA'S, and CHIMERA'S dire. <BR>
<BR>
  Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, <BR>
SATAN with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, <BR>
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell <BR>
Explores his solitary flight; som times <BR>
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, <BR>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares <BR>
Up to the fiery concave touring high. <BR>
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd <BR>
Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds <BR>
Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles <BR>
Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring <BR>
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood <BR>
Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape <BR>
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem'd <BR>
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer <BR>
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, <BR>
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass <BR>
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, <BR>
Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire, <BR>
Yet unconsum'd.  Before the Gates there sat <BR>
On either side a formidable shape; <BR>
The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, <BR>
But ended foul in many a scaly fould <BR>
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd <BR>
With mortal sting: about her middle round <BR>
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd <BR>
With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung <BR>
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, <BR>
If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, <BR>
And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd <BR>
Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these <BR>
Vex'd SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts <BR>
CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore: <BR>
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd <BR>
In secret, riding through the Air she comes <BR>
Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance <BR>
With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon <BR>
Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape, <BR>
If shape it might be call'd that shape had none <BR>
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, <BR>
Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, <BR>
For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, <BR>
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, <BR>
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head <BR>
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. <BR>
SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat <BR>
The Monster moving onward came as fast, <BR>
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. <BR>
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, <BR>
Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, <BR>
Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd; <BR>
And with disdainful look thus first began. <BR>
<BR>
  Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, <BR>
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance <BR>
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way <BR>
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, <BR>
That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: <BR>
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, <BR>
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, <BR>
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, <BR>
Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then <BR>
Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms <BR>
Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons <BR>
Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou <BR>
And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd <BR>
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? <BR>
And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, <BR>
Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, <BR>
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, <BR>
Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment, <BR>
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, <BR>
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue <BR>
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart <BR>
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, <BR>
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold <BR>
More dreadful and deform: on th' other side <BR>
Incenc't with indignation SATAN stood <BR>
Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, <BR>
That fires the length of OPHIUCUS huge <BR>
In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair <BR>
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head <BR>
Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands <BR>
No second stroke intend, and such a frown <BR>
Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds <BR>
With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on <BR>
Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front <BR>
Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow <BR>
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: <BR>
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell <BR>
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; <BR>
For never but once more was either like <BR>
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds <BR>
Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, <BR>
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat <BR>
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, <BR>
Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. <BR>
<BR>
  O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, <BR>
Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son, <BR>
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart <BR>
Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; <BR>
For him who sits above and laughs the while <BR>
At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute <BR>
What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, <BR>
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. <BR>
<BR>
  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest <BR>
Forbore, then these to her SATAN return'd: <BR>
<BR>
  So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange <BR>
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand <BR>
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds <BR>
What it intends; till first I know of thee, <BR>
What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why <BR>
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st <BR>
Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son? <BR>
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now <BR>
Sight more detestable then him and thee. <BR>
<BR>
  T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; <BR>
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem <BR>
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair <BR>
In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight <BR>
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd <BR>
In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, <BR>
All on a sudden miserable pain <BR>
Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm <BR>
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast <BR>
Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, <BR>
Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, <BR>
Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd <BR>
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd <BR>
All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid <BR>
At first, and call'd me SIN, and for a Sign <BR>
Portentous held me; but familiar grown, <BR>
I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won <BR>
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft <BR>
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing <BR>
Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st <BR>
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd <BR>
A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose, <BR>
And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind <BR>
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe <BR>
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout <BR>
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell <BR>
Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down <BR>
Into this Deep, and in the general fall <BR>
I also; at which time this powerful Key <BR>
Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep <BR>
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass <BR>
Without my op'ning.  Pensive here I sat <BR>
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb <BR>
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown <BR>
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. <BR>
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest <BR>
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way <BR>
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain <BR>
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew <BR>
Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie <BR>
Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart <BR>
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out DEATH; <BR>
Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd <BR>
From all her Caves, and back resounded DEATH. <BR>
I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, <BR>
Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, <BR>
Me overtook his mother all dismaid, <BR>
And in embraces forcible and foule <BR>
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot <BR>
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry <BR>
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd <BR>
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite <BR>
To me, for when they list into the womb <BR>
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw <BR>
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth <BR>
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, <BR>
That rest or intermission none I find. <BR>
Before mine eyes in opposition sits <BR>
Grim DEATH my Son and foe, who sets them on, <BR>
And me his Parent would full soon devour <BR>
For want of other prey, but that he knows <BR>
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I <BR>
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, <BR>
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. <BR>
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun <BR>
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope <BR>
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, <BR>
Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, <BR>
Save he who reigns above, none can resist. <BR>
<BR>
  She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore <BR>
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. <BR>
Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, <BR>
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge <BR>
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys <BR>
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change <BR>
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know <BR>
I come no enemie, but to set free <BR>
From out this dark and dismal house of pain, <BR>
Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host <BR>
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd <BR>
Fell with us from on high: from them I go <BR>
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all <BR>
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread <BR>
Th' unfounded deep, &amp; through the void immense <BR>
To search with wandring quest a place foretold <BR>
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now <BR>
Created vast and round, a place of bliss <BR>
In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't <BR>
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply <BR>
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, <BR>
Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude <BR>
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught <BR>
Then this more secret now design'd, I haste <BR>
To know, and this once known, shall soon return, <BR>
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death <BR>
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen <BR>
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd <BR>
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd <BR>
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. <BR>
He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death <BR>
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear <BR>
His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe <BR>
Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd <BR>
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. <BR>
<BR>
  The key of this infernal Pit by due, <BR>
And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King <BR>
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock <BR>
These Adamantine Gates; against all force <BR>
Death ready stands to interpose his dart, <BR>
Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might. <BR>
But what ow I to his commands above <BR>
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down <BR>
Into this gloom of TARTARUS profound, <BR>
To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, <BR>
Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, <BR>
Here in perpetual agonie and pain, <BR>
With terrors and with clamors compasst round <BR>
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: <BR>
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou <BR>
My being gav'st me; whom should I obey <BR>
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon <BR>
To that new world of light and bliss, among <BR>
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign <BR>
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems <BR>
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, <BR>
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; <BR>
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, <BR>
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, <BR>
Which but her self not all the STYGIAN powers <BR>
Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns <BR>
Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar <BR>
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease <BR>
Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie <BR>
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound <BR>
Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great <BR>
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook <BR>
Of EREBUS.  She op'nd, but to shut <BR>
Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, <BR>
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host <BR>
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through <BR>
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; <BR>
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth <BR>
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. <BR>
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear <BR>
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark <BR>
Illimitable Ocean without bound, <BR>
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, <BR>
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night <BR>
And CHAOS, Ancestors of Nature, hold <BR>
Eternal ANARCHIE, amidst the noise <BR>
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. <BR>
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce <BR>
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring <BR>
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag <BR>
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, <BR>
Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, <BR>
Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands <BR>
Of BARCA or CYRENE'S torrid soil, <BR>
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise <BR>
Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere, <BR>
Hee rules a moment; CHAOS Umpire sits, <BR>
And by decision more imbroiles the fray <BR>
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter <BR>
CHANCE governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss, <BR>
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, <BR>
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, <BR>
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt <BR>
Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, <BR>
Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain <BR>
His dark materials to create more Worlds, <BR>
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend <BR>
Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, <BR>
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith <BR>
He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal'd <BR>
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare <BR>
Great things with small) then when BELLONA storms, <BR>
With all her battering Engines bent to rase <BR>
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame <BR>
Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements <BR>
In mutinie had from her Axle torn <BR>
The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes <BR>
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak <BR>
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League <BR>
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides <BR>
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets <BR>
A vast vacuitie: all unawares <BR>
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops <BR>
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour <BR>
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance <BR>
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud <BR>
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him <BR>
As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, <BR>
Quencht in a Boggie SYRTIS, neither Sea, <BR>
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, <BR>
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, <BR>
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. <BR>
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness <BR>
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, <BR>
Pursues the ARIMASPIAN, who by stelth <BR>
Had from his wakeful custody purloind <BR>
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend <BR>
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, <BR>
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, <BR>
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: <BR>
At length a universal hubbub wilde <BR>
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd <BR>
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare <BR>
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, <BR>
Undaunted to meet there what ever power <BR>
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss <BR>
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask <BR>
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes <BR>
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne <BR>
Of CHAOS, and his dark Pavilion spread <BR>
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd <BR>
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, <BR>
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood <BR>
ORCUS and ADES, and the dreaded name <BR>
Of DEMOGORGON; Rumor next and Chance, <BR>
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, <BR>
And Discord with a thousand various mouths. <BR>
<BR>
  T' whom SATAN turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers <BR>
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, <BR>
CHAOS and ANCIENT NIGHT, I come no Spie, <BR>
With purpose to explore or to disturb <BR>
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint <BR>
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way <BR>
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, <BR>
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek <BR>
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds <BR>
Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place <BR>
From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King <BR>
Possesses lately, thither to arrive <BR>
I travel this profound, direct my course; <BR>
Directed, no mean recompence it brings <BR>
To your behoof, if I that Region lost, <BR>
All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce <BR>
To her original darkness and your sway <BR>
(Which is my present journey) and once more <BR>
Erect the Standerd there of ANCIENT NIGHT; <BR>
Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. <BR>
<BR>
  Thus SATAN; and him thus the Anarch old <BR>
With faultring speech and visage incompos'd <BR>
Answer'd.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art, <BR>
That mighty leading Angel, who of late <BR>
Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. <BR>
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host <BR>
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep <BR>
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, <BR>
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates <BR>
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands <BR>
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here <BR>
Keep residence; if all I can will serve, <BR>
That little which is left so to defend <BR>
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles <BR>
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell <BR>
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; <BR>
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World <BR>
Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain <BR>
To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: <BR>
If that way be your walk, you have not farr; <BR>
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; <BR>
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. <BR>
<BR>
  He ceas'd; and SATAN staid not to reply, <BR>
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, <BR>
With fresh alacritie and force renew'd <BR>
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire <BR>
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock <BR>
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round <BR>
Environ'd wins his way; harder beset <BR>
And more endanger'd, then when ARGO pass'd <BR>
Through BOSPORUS betwixt the justling Rocks: <BR>
Or when ULYSSES on the Larbord shunnd <BR>
CHARYBDIS, and by th' other whirlpool steard. <BR>
So he with difficulty and labour hard <BR>
Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; <BR>
But hee once past, soon after when man fell, <BR>
Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain <BR>
Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, <BR>
Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way <BR>
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf <BR>
Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length <BR>
From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe <BR>
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse <BR>
With easie intercourse pass to and fro <BR>
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom <BR>
God and good Angels guard by special grace. <BR>
But now at last the sacred influence <BR>
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n <BR>
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night <BR>
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins <BR>
Her fardest verge, and CHAOS to retire <BR>
As from her outmost works a brok'n foe <BR>
With tumult less and with less hostile din, <BR>
That SATAN with less toil, and now with ease <BR>
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light <BR>
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds <BR>
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; <BR>
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, <BR>
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold <BR>
Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide <BR>
In circuit, undetermind square or round, <BR>
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd <BR>
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; <BR>
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain <BR>
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr <BR>
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. <BR>
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, <BR>
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. <BR>
<BR>
    THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK. <BR>
