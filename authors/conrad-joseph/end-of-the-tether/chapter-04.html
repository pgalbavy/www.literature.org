<p> Revolving these thoughts, he strolled on near the railings of
the quay, broad-chested, without a stoop, as though his big shoulders
had never felt the burden of the loads that must be carried between
the cradle and the grave. No single betraying fold or line of
care disfigured the reposeful modeling of his face. It was full
and untanned; and the upper part emerged, massively quiet, out
of the downward flow of silvery hair, with the striking delicacy
of its clear complexion and the powerful width of the forehead.
The first cast of his glance fell on you candid and swift, like
a boy’s; but because of the ragged snowy thatch of the eyebrows
the affability of his attention acquired the character of a dark
and searching scrutiny. With age he had put on flesh a little,
had increased his girth like an old tree presenting no symptoms
of decay; and even the opulent, lustrous ripple of white hairs
upon his chest seemed an attribute of unquenchable vitality and
vigor.</p>

<p>Once rather proud of his great bodily strength, and even of his
personal appearance, conscious of his worth, and firm in his rectitude,
there had remained to him, like the heritage of departed prosperity,
the tranquil bearing of a man who had proved himself fit in every
sort of way for the life of his choice. He strode on squarely
under the projecting brim of an ancient Panama hat. It had a low
crown, a crease through its whole diameter, a narrow black ribbon.
Imperishable and a little discolored, this headgear made it easy
to pick him out from afar on thronged wharves and in the busy
streets. He had never adopted the comparatively modern fashion
of pipeclayed cork helmets. He disliked the form; and he hoped
he could manage to keep a cool head to the end of his life without
all these contrivances for hygienic ventilation. His hair was
cropped close, his linen always of immaculate whiteness; a suit
of thin gray flannel, worn threadbare but scrupulously brushed,
floated about his burly limbs, adding to his bulk by the looseness
of its cut. The years had mellowed the good-humored, imperturbable
audacity of his prime into a temper carelessly serene; and the
leisurely tapping of his iron-shod stick accompanied his footfalls
with a self-confident sound on the flagstones. It was impossible
to connect such a fine presence and this unruffled aspect with
the belittling troubles of poverty; the man’s whole existence
appeared to pass before you, facile and large, in the freedom
of means as ample as the clothing of his body.</p>

<p>The irrational dread of having to break into his five hundred
pounds for personal expenses in the hotel disturbed the steady
poise of his mind. There was no time to lose. The bill was running
up. He nourished the hope that this five hundred would perhaps
be the means, if everything else failed, of obtaining some work
which, keeping his body and soul together (not a matter of great
outlay), would enable him to be of use to his daughter. To his
mind it was her own money which he employed, as it were, in backing
her father and solely for her benefit. Once at work, he would
help her with the greater part of his earnings; he was good for
many years yet, and this boarding-house business, he argued to
himself, whatever the prospects, could not be much of a gold-mine
from the first start. But what work? He was ready to lay hold
of anything in an honest way so that it came quickly to his hand;
because the five hundred pounds must be preserved intact for eventual
use. That was the great point. With the entire five hundred one
felt a substance at one’s back; but it seemed to him that should
he let it dwindle to four-fifty or even four-eighty, all the efficiency
would be gone out of the money, as though there were some magic
power in the round figure. But what sort of work?</p>

<p>Confronted by that haunting question as by an uneasy ghost, for
whom he had no exorcising formula, Captain Whalley stopped short
on the apex of a small bridge spanning steeply the bed of a canalized
creek with granite shores. Moored between the square blocks a
seagoing Malay prau floated half hidden under the arch of masonry,
with her spars lowered down, without a sound of life on board,
and covered from stem to stern with a ridge of palm-leaf mats.
He had left behind him the overheated pavements bordered by the
stone frontages that, like the sheer face of cliffs, followed
the sweep of the quays; and an unconfined spaciousness of orderly
and sylvan aspect opened before him its wide plots of rolled grass,
like pieces of green carpet smoothly pegged out, its long ranges
of trees lined up in colossal porticos of dark shafts roofed with
a vault of branches.</p>

<p>Some of these avenues ended at the sea. It was a terraced shore;
and beyond, upon the level expanse, profound and glistening like
the gaze of a dark-blue eye, an oblique band of stippled purple
lengthened itself indefinitely through the gap between a couple
of verdant twin islets. The masts and spars of a few ships far
away, hull down in the outer roads, sprang straight from the water
in a fine maze of rosy lines penciled on the clear shadow of the
eastern board. Captain Whalley gave them a long glance. The ship,
once his own, was anchored out there. It was staggering to think
that it was open to him no longer to take a boat at the jetty
and get himself pulled off to her when the evening came. To no
ship. Perhaps never more. Before the sale was concluded, and till
the purchase-money had been paid, he had spent daily some time
on board the Fair Maid. The money had been paid this very morning,
and now, all at once, there was positively no ship that he could
go on board of when he liked; no ship that would need his presence
in order to do her work&mdash;to live. It seemed an incredible state
of affairs, something too bizarre to last. And the sea was full
of craft of all sorts. There was that prau lying so still swathed
in her shroud of sewn palm-leaves&mdash;she too had her indispensable
man. They lived through each other, this Malay he had never seen,
and this high-sterned thing of no size that seemed to be resting
after a long journey. And of all the ships in sight, near and
far, each was provided with a man, the man without whom the finest
ship is a dead thing, a floating and purposeless log.</p>

<p>After his one glance at the roadstead he went on, since there
was nothing to turn back for, and the time must be got through
somehow. The avenues of big trees ran straight over the Esplanade,
cutting each other at diverse angles, columnar below and luxuriant
above. The interlaced boughs high up there seemed to slumber;
not a leaf stirred overhead: and the reedy cast-iron lampposts
in the middle of the road, gilt like scepters, diminished in a
long perspective, with their globes of white porcelain atop, resembling
a barbarous decoration of ostriches’ eggs displayed in a row.
The flaming sky kindled a tiny crimson spark upon the glistening
surface of each glassy shell.</p>

<p>With his chin sunk a little, his hands behind his back, and the
end of his stick marking the gravel with a faint wavering line
at his heels, Captain Whalley reflected that if a ship without
a man was like a body without a soul, a sailor without a ship
was of not much more account in this world than an aimless log
adrift upon the sea. The log might be sound enough by itself,
tough of fiber, and hard to destroy&mdash;but what of that! And a sudden
sense of irremediable idleness weighted his feet like a great
fatigue.</p>

<p>A succession of open carriages came bowling along the newly opened
sea-road. You could see across the wide grass-plots the discs
of vibration made by the spokes. The bright domes of the parasols
swayed lightly outwards like full-blown blossoms on the rim of
a vase; and the quiet sheet of dark-blue water, crossed by a bar
of purple, made a background for the spinning wheels and the high
action of the horses, whilst the turbaned heads of the Indian
servants elevated above the line of the sea horizon glided rapidly
on the paler blue of the sky. In an open space near the little
bridge each turn-out trotted smartly in a wide curve away from
the sunset; then pulling up sharp, entered the main alley in a
long slow-moving file with the great red stillness of the sky
at the back. The trunks of mighty trees stood all touched with
red on the same side, the air seemed aflame under the high foliage,
the very ground under the hoofs of the horses was red. The wheels
turned solemnly; one after another the sunshades drooped, folding
their colors like gorgeous flowers shutting their petals at the
end of the day. In the whole half-mile of human beings no voice
uttered a distinct word, only a faint thudding noise went on mingled
with slight jingling sounds, and the motionless heads and shoulders
of men and women sitting in couples emerged stolidly above the
lowered hoods&mdash;as if wooden. But one carriage and pair coming
late did not join the line.</p>

<p>It fled along in a noiseless roll; but on entering the avenue
one of the dark bays snorted, arching his neck and shying against
the steel-tipped pole; a flake of foam fell from the bit upon
the point of a satiny shoulder, and the dusky face of the coachman
leaned forward at once over the hands taking a fresh grip of the
reins. It was a long dark-green landau, having a dignified and
buoyant motion between the sharply curved C-springs, and a sort
of strictly official majesty in its supreme elegance. It seemed
more roomy than is usual, its horses seemed slightly bigger, the
appointments a shade more perfect, the servants perched somewhat
higher on the box. The dresses of three women&mdash;two young and pretty,
and one, handsome, large, of mature age&mdash;seemed to fill completely
the shallow body of the carriage. The fourth face was that of
a man, heavy lidded, distinguished and sallow, with a somber,
thick, iron-gray imperial and mustaches, which somehow had the
air of solid appendages. His Excellency&mdash;</p>

<p>The rapid motion of that one equipage made all the others appear
utterly inferior, blighted, and reduced to crawl painfully at
a snail’s pace. The landau distanced the whole file in a sort
of sustained rush; the features of the occupant whirling out of
sight left behind an impression of fixed stares and impassive
vacancy; and after it had vanished in full flight as it were,
notwithstanding the long line of vehicles hugging the curb at
a walk, the whole lofty vista of the avenue seemed to lie open
and emptied of life in the enlarged impression of an august solitude.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley had lifted his head to look, and his mind, disturbed
in its meditation, turned with wonder (as men’s minds will do)
to matters of no importance. It struck him that it was to this
port, where he had just sold his last ship, that he had come with
the very first he had ever owned, and with his head full of a
plan for opening a new trade with a distant part of the Archipelago.
The then governor had given him no end of encouragement. No Excellency
he&mdash;this Mr. Denham&mdash;this governor with his jacket off; a man
who tended night and day, so to speak, the growing prosperity
of the settlement with the self-forgetful devotion of a nurse
for a child she loves; a lone bachelor who lived as in a camp
with the few servants and his three dogs in what was called then
the Government Bungalow: a low-roofed structure on the half-cleared
slope of a hill, with a new flagstaff in front and a police orderly
on the veranda. He remembered toiling up that hill under a heavy
sun for his audience; the unfurnished aspect of the cool shaded
room; the long table covered at one end with piles of papers,
and with two guns, a brass telescope, a small bottle of oil with
a feather stuck in the neck at the other&mdash;and the flattering attention
given to him by the man in power. It was an undertaking full of
risk he had come to expound, but a twenty minutes’ talk in the
Government Bungalow on the hill had made it go smoothly from the
start. And as he was retiring Mr. Denham, already seated before
the papers, called out after him, "Next month the Dido starts
for a cruise that way, and I shall request her captain officially
to give you a look in and see how you get on." The Dido was one
of the smart frigates on the China station&mdash;and five-and-thirty
years make a big slice of time. Five-and-thirty years ago an enterprise
like his had for the colony enough importance to be looked after
by a Queen’s ship. A big slice of time. Individuals were of some
account then. Men like himself; men, too, like poor Evans, for
instance, with his red face, his coal-black whiskers, and his
restless eyes, who had set up the first patent slip for repairing
small ships, on the edge of the forest, in a lonely bay three
miles up the coast. Mr. Denham had encouraged that enterprise
too, and yet somehow poor Evans had ended by dying at home deucedly
hard up. His son, they said, was squeezing oil out of cocoa-nuts
for a living on some God-forsaken islet of the Indian Ocean; but
it was from that patent slip in a lonely wooded bay that had sprung
the workshops of the Consolidated Docks Company, with its three
graving basins carved out of solid rock, its wharves, its jetties,
its electric-light plant, its steam-power houses&mdash;with its gigantic
sheer-legs, fit to lift the heaviest weight ever carried afloat,
and whose head could be seen like the top of a queer white monument
peeping over bushy points of land and sandy promontories, as you
approached the New Harbor from the west.</p>

<p>There had been a time when men counted: there were not so many
carriages in the colony then, though Mr. Denham, he fancied, had
a buggy. And Captain Whalley seemed to be swept out of the great
avenue by the swirl of a mental backwash. He remembered muddy
shores, a harbor without quays, the one solitary wooden pier (but
that was a public work) jutting out crookedly, the first coal-sheds
erected on Monkey Point, that caught fire mysteriously and smoldered
for days, so that amazed ships came into a roadstead full of sulphurous
smoke, and the sun hung blood-red at midday. He remembered the
things, the faces, and something more besides&mdash;like the faint
flavor of a cup quaffed to the bottom, like a subtle sparkle of
the air that was not to be found in the atmosphere of to-day.</p>

<p>In this evocation, swift and full of detail like a flash of magnesium
light into the niches of a dark memorial hall, Captain Whalley
contemplated things once important, the efforts of small men,
the growth of a great place, but now robbed of all consequence
by the greatness of accomplished facts, by hopes greater still;
and they gave him for a moment such an almost physical grip upon
time, such a comprehension of our unchangeable feelings, that
he stopped short, struck the ground with his stick, and ejaculated
mentally, "What the devil am I doing here!" He seemed lost in
a sort of surprise; but he heard his name called out in wheezy
tones once, twice&mdash;and turned on his heels slowly.</p>

<p>He beheld then, waddling towards him autocratically, a man of
an old-fashioned and gouty aspect, with hair as white as his own,
but with shaved, florid cheeks, wearing a necktie&mdash;almost a neckcloth&mdash;whose
stiff ends projected far beyond his chin; with round legs, round
arms, a round body, a round face&mdash;generally producing the effect
of his short figure having been distended by means of an air-pump
as much as the seams of his clothing would stand. This was the
Master-Attendant of the port. A master-attendant is a superior
sort of harbor-master; a person, out in the East, of some consequence
in his sphere; a Government official, a magistrate for the waters
of the port, and possessed of vast but ill-defined disciplinary
authority over seamen of all classes. This particular Master-Attendant
was reported to consider it miserably inadequate, on the ground
that it did not include the power of life and death. This was
a jocular exaggeration. Captain Eliott was fairly satisfied with
his position, and nursed no inconsiderable sense of such power
as he had. His conceited and tyrannical disposition did not allow
him to let it dwindle in his hands for want of use. The uproarious,
choleric frankness of his comments on people’s character and conduct
caused him to be feared at bottom; though in conversation many
pretended not to mind him in the least, others would only smile
sourly at the mention of his name, and there were even some who
dared to pronounce him "a meddlesome old ruffian." But for almost
all of them one of Captain Eliott’s outbreaks was nearly as distasteful
to face as a chance of annihilation.</p>
