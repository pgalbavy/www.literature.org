<p>My eyes were bandaged tight, and a thong was run round my right
wrist and tied to Laputa's saddle-bow.  I felt the glare of the
afternoon sun on my head, and my shins were continually barked
by stones and trees; but these were my only tidings of the outer
world.  By the sound of his paces Laputa was riding the <em>schimmel</em>,
and if any one thinks it easy to go blindfold by a horse's side
I hope he will soon have the experience. In the darkness I could
not tell the speed of the beast.  When I ran I overshot it and
was tugged back; when I walked my wrist was dislocated with the
tugs forward.</p>

<p>For an hour or more I suffered this breakneck treatment. We were
descending.  Often I could hear the noise of falling streams,
and once we splashed through a mountain ford. Laputa was taking
no risks, for he clearly had in mind the possibility of some accident
which would set me free, and he had no desire to have me guiding
Arcoll to his camp.</p>

<p>But as I stumbled and sprawled down these rocky tracks I was
not thinking of Laputa's plans.  My whole soul was filled with
regret for Colin, and rage against his murderer.  After my first
mad rush I had not thought about my dog.  He was dead, but so
would I be in an hour or two, and there was no cause to lament
him.  But at the first revival of hope my grief had returned. 
As they bandaged my eyes I was wishing that they would let me
see his grave.  As I followed beside Laputa I told myself that
if ever I got free, when the war was over I would go to Inanda's
Kraal, find the grave, and put a tombstone over it in memory of
the dog that saved my life.  I would also write that the man who
shot him was killed on such and such a day at such and such a
place by Colin's master.  I wondered why Laputa had not the wits
to see the Portugoose's treachery and to let me fight him.  I
did not care what were the weapons&mdash;knives or guns, or naked fists
&mdash;I would certainly kill him, and afterwards the Kaffirs
could do as they pleased with me. Hot tears of rage and weakness
wet the bandage on my eyes, and the sobs which came from me were
not only those of weariness.</p>

<p>At last we halted.  Laputa got down and took off the bandage,
and I found myself in one of the hill-meadows which lie among
the foothills of the Wolkberg.  The glare blinded me, and for
a little I could only see the marigolds growing at my feet.  Then
I had a glimpse of the deep gorge of the Great Letaba below me,
and far to the east the flats running out to the hazy blue line
of the Lebombo hills.  Laputa let me sit on the ground for a minute
or two to get my breath and rest my feet.  'That was a rough road,'
he said.  'You can take it easier now, for I have no wish to carry
you.'  He patted the <em>schimmel</em>, and the beautiful creature
turned his mild eyes on the pair of us.  I wondered if he recognized
his rider of two nights ago.</p>

<p>I had seen Laputa as the Christian minister, as the priest and
king in the cave, as the leader of an army at Dupree's Drift,
and at the kraal we had left as the savage with all self-control
flung to the winds.  I was to see this amazing man in a further
part.  For he now became a friendly and rational companion.  He
kept his horse at an easy walk, and talked to me as if we were
two friends out for a trip together. Perhaps he had talked thus
to Arcoll, the half-caste who drove his Cape-cart.</p>

<p>The wooded bluff above Machudi's glen showed far in front.  He
told me the story of the Machudi war, which I knew already, but
he told it as a saga.  There had been a stratagem by which one
of the Boer leaders&mdash;a Grobelaar, I think&mdash;got some of his men
into the enemy's camp by hiding them in a captured forage wagon.</p>

<p>'Like the Trojan horse,' I said involuntarily.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said my companion, 'the same old device,' and to my amazement
he quoted some lines of Virgil.</p>

<p>'Do you understand Latin?' he asked.</p>

<p>I told him that I had some slight knowledge of the tongue, acquired
at the university of Edinburgh.  Laputa nodded.  He mentioned
the name of a professor there, and commented on his scholarship.</p>

<p>'O man!' I cried, 'what in God's name are you doing in this business?
You that are educated and have seen the world, what makes you
try to put the clock back?  You want to wipe out the civilization
of a thousand years, and turn us all into savages. It's the more
shame to you when you know better.'</p>

<p>'You misunderstand me,' he said quietly.  'It is because I have
sucked civilization dry that I know the bitterness of the fruit. 
I want a simpler and better world, and I want that world for my
own people.  I am a Christian, and will you tell me that your
civilization pays much attention to Christ?  You call yourself
a patriot?  Will you not give me leave to be a patriot in turn?'</p>

<p>'If you are a Christian, what sort of Christianity is it to deluge
the land with blood?'</p>

<p>'The best,' he said.  'The house must be swept and garnished
before the man of the house can dwell in it.  You have read history.
Such a purging has descended on the Church at many times, and
the world has awakened to a new hope.  It is the same in all religions. 
The temples grow tawdry and foul and must be cleansed, and, let
me remind you, the cleanser has always come out of the desert.'</p>

<p>I had no answer, being too weak and forlorn to think.  But I
fastened on his patriotic plea.</p>

<p>'Where are the patriots in your following?  They are all red
Kaffirs crying for blood and plunder.  Supposing you were Oliver
Cromwell you could make nothing out of such a crew.'</p>

<p>'They are my people,' he said simply.</p>

<p>By this time we had forded the Great Letaba, and were making
our way through the clumps of forest to the crown of the plateau. 
I noticed that Laputa kept well in cover, preferring the tangle
of wooded undergrowth to the open spaces of the water-meadows. 
As he talked, his wary eyes were keeping a sharp look-out over
the landscape.  I thrilled with the thought that my own folk were
near at hand.</p>

<p>Once Laputa checked me with his hand as I was going to speak,
and in silence we crossed the kloof of a little stream. After
that we struck a long strip of forest and he slackened his watch.</p>

<p>'If you fight for a great cause,' I said, 'why do you let a miscreant
like Henriques have a hand in it?  You must know that the man's
only interest in you is the chance of loot.  I am for you against
Henriques, and I tell you plain that if you don't break the snake's
back it will sting you.'</p>

<p>Laputa looked at me with an odd, meditative look.</p>

<p>'You misunderstand again, Mr Storekeeper.  The Portuguese is
what you call a "mean white." His only safety is among us.  I
am campaigner enough to know that an enemy, who has a burning
grievance against my other enemies, is a good ally. You are too
hard on Henriques.  You and your friends have treated him as a
Kaffir, and a Kaffir he is in everything but Kaffir virtues. 
What makes you so anxious that Henriques should not betray me?'</p>

<p>'I'm not a mean white,' I said, 'and I will speak the truth. 
I hope, in God's name, to see you smashed; but I want it done
by honest men, and not by a yellow devil who has murdered my dog
and my friends. Sooner or later you will find him out; and if
he escapes you, and there's any justice in heaven, he won't escape
me.'</p>

<p>'Brave words,' said Laputa, with a laugh, and then in one second
he became rigid in the saddle.  We had crossed a patch of meadow
and entered a wood, beyond which ran the highway. I fancy he was
out in his reckoning, and did not think the road so near.  At
any rate, after a moment he caught the sound of horses, and I
caught it too.  The wood was thin, and there was no room for retreat,
while to recross the meadow would bring us clean into the open. 
He jumped from his horse, untied with amazing quickness the rope
halter from its neck, and started to gag me by winding the thing
round my jaw.</p>

<p>I had no time to protest that I would keep faith, and my right
hand was tethered to his pommel.  In the grip of these great arms
I was helpless, and in a trice was standing dumb as a lamp-post;
while Laputa, his left arm round both of mine, and his right hand
over the <em>schimmel</em>'s eyes, strained his ears like a sable
antelope who has scented danger.</p>

<p>There was never a more brutal gagging.  The rope crushed my nose
and drove my lips down on my teeth, besides gripping my throat
so that I could scarcely breathe.  The pain was so great that
I became sick, and would have fallen but for Laputa. Happily I
managed to get my teeth apart, so that one coil slipped between,
and eased the pain of the jaws.  But the rest was bad enough to
make me bite frantically on the tow, and I think in a little my
sharp front teeth would have severed it.  All this discomfort
prevented me seeing what happened.  The wood, as I have said,
was thin, and through the screen of leaves I had a confused impression
of men and horses passing interminably.  There can only have been
a score at the most; but the moments drag if a cord is gripping
your throat.  When Laputa at length untied me, I had another fit
of nausea, and leaned helplessly against a tree.</p>

<p>Laputa listened till the sound of the horses had died away; then
silently we stole to the edge of the road, across, and into the
thicker evergreen bush on the far side.  At a pace which forced
me to run hard, we climbed a steepish slope, till ahead of us
we saw the bald green crown of the meadowlands.  I noticed that
his face had grown dark and sullen again.  He was in an enemy's
country, and had the air of the hunted instead of the hunter. 
When I stopped he glowered at me, and once, when I was all but
overcome with fatigue, he lifted his hand in a threat.  Had he
carried a sjambok, it would have fallen on my back.</p>

<p>If he was nervous, so was I.  The fact that I was out of the
Kaffir country and in the land of my own folk was a kind of qualified
liberty. At any moment, I felt, Providence might intervene to
set me free.  It was in the bond that Laputa should shoot me if
we were attacked; but a pistol might miss.  As far as my shaken
wits would let me, I began to forecast the future. Once he got
the jewels my side of the bargain was complete. He had promised
me my life, but there had been nothing said about my liberty;
and I felt assured that Laputa would never allow one who had seen
so much to get off to Arcoll with his tidings.  But back to that
unhallowed kraal I was resolved I would not go.  He was armed,
and I was helpless; he was strong, and I was dizzy with weakness;
he was mounted, and I was on foot: it seemed a poor hope that
I should get away. There was little chance from a wandering patrol,
for I knew if we were followed I should have a bullet in my head,
while Laputa got off on the <em>schimmel</em>.  I must wait and
bide events. At the worst, a clean shot on the hillside in a race
for life was better than the unknown mysteries of the kraal. 
I prayed earnestly to God to show me His mercy, for if ever man
was sore bested by the heathen it was I.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Laputa chose to show himself on the green hill-shoulder. 
He looked towards the Wolkberg and raised his hands. It must have
been some signal.  I cast my eyes back on the road we had come,
and I thought I saw some figures a mile back, on the edge of the
Letaba gorge.  He was making sure of my return.</p>

<p>By this time it was about four in the afternoon, and as heavenly
weather as the heart of man could wish.  The meadows were full
of aromatic herbs, which, as we crushed them, sent up a delicate
odour. The little pools and shallows of the burns were as clear
as a Lothian trout-stream.  We were now going at a good pace,
and I found that my earlier weariness was growing less.  I was
being keyed up for some great crisis, for in my case the spirit
acts direct on the body, and fatigue grows and ebbs with hope. 
I knew that my strength was not far from breaking-point; but I
knew also that so long as a chance was left me I should have enough
for a stroke.</p>

<p>Before I realized where we were we had rounded the hill, and
were looking down on the green cup of the upper Machudi's glen. 
Far down, I remember, where the trees began, there was a cloud
of smoke.  Some Kaffir&mdash;or maybe Arcoll&mdash;had fired the forest. 
The smoke was drifting away under a light west wind over the far
plains, so that they were seen through a haze of opal.</p>

<p>Laputa bade me take the lead.  I saw quite clear the red kloof
on the far side, where the collar was hid.  To get there we might
have ridden straight into the cup, but a providential instinct
made me circle round the top till we were on the lip of the ravine. 
This was the road some of Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly
I followed them.  Twenty minutes' riding brought us to the place,
and all the while I had no kind of plan of escape.  I was in the
hands of my Maker, watching, like the Jews of old, for a sign.</p>

<p>Laputa dismounted and looked down into the gorge.</p>

<p>'There is no road there,' I said.  'We must go down to the foot
and come up the stream-side.  It would be better to leave your
horse here.' He started down the cliff, which from above looks
a sheer precipice. Then he seemed to agree with me, took the rope
from the <em>schimmel</em>'s neck, and knee-haltered his beast. 
And at that moment I had an inspiration.</p>

<p>With my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded me down the hill
till we got to the red screes at the foot of the kloof.  Then,
under my guidance, we turned up into the darkness of the gorge. 
As we entered I looked back, and saw figures coming over the edge
of the green cup &mdash;Laputa's men, I guessed. What I had to
do must be done quickly.</p>

<p>We climbed up the burn, over the succession of little cataracts,
till we came to the flat space of shingle and the long pool where
I had been taken that morning.  The ashes of the fire which Machudi's
men had made were plain on the rock. After that I had to climb
a waterfall to get to the rocky pool where I had bestowed the
rubies.</p>

<p>'You must take off this thong,' I said.  'I must climb to get
the collar.  Cover me with a pistol if you like.  I won't be out
of sight.'</p>

<p>Laputa undid the thong and set me free.  From his belt he took
a pistol, cocked it, and held it over his left hand.  I had seen
this way of shooting adopted by indifferent shots, and it gave
me a wild hope that he might not be much of a marksman.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to find the pool, close against the blackened
stump of a tree-fern.  I thrust in my hand and gathered up the
jewels from the cool sand.  They came out glowing like living
fires, and for a moment I thrilled with a sense of reverence. 
Surely these were no common stones which held in them the very
heart of hell.  Clutching them tightly, I climbed down to Laputa.</p>

<p>At the sight of the great Snake he gave a cry of rapture. Tearing
it from me, he held it at arm's length, his face lit with a passionate
joy.  He kissed it, he raised it to the sky; nay, he was on his
knees before it.  Once more he was the savage transported in the
presence of his fetich.  He turned to me with burning eyes.</p>

<p>'Down on your knees,' he cried, 'and reverence the <em>Ndhlondhlo</em>.
Down, you impious dog, and seek pardon for your sacrilege.'</p>

<p>'I won't,' I said.  'I won't bow to any heathen idol.'</p>

<p>He pointed his pistol at me.</p>

<p>'In a second I shoot where your head is now.  Down, you fool,
or perish.'</p>

<p>'You promised me my life,' I said stubbornly, though Heaven knows
why I chose to act thus.</p>

<p>He dropped the pistol and flung himself on me.  I was helpless
as a baby in his hands.  He forced me to the ground and rolled
my face in the sand; then he pulled me to my feet and tossed me
backward, till I almost staggered into the pool. I saved myself,
and staggered instead into the shallow at the foot of it, close
under the ledge of the precipice.</p>

<p>That morning, when Machudi's men were cooking breakfast, I had
figured out a route up the cliff.  This route was now my hope
of escape. Laputa had dropped his pistol, and the collar had plunged
him in an ecstasy of worship.  Now, if ever, was my time.  I must
get on the shelf which ran sideways up the cliff, and then scramble
for dear life.</p>

<p>I pretended to be dazed and terrified.</p>

<p>'You promised me my life,' I whimpered.</p>

<p>'Your life,' he cried.  'Yes, you shall have your life; and before
long you will pray for death.'</p>

<p>'But I saved the Collar,' I pleaded.  'Henriques would have stolen
it. I brought it safe here, and now you have got it.'</p>

<p>Meantime I was pulling myself up on the shelf, and loosening
with one hand a boulder which overhung the pool.</p>

<p>'You have been repaid,' he said savagely.  'You will not die.'</p>

<p>'But my life is no use without liberty,' I said, working at the
boulder till it lay loose in its niche.</p>

<p>He did not answer, being intent on examining the Collar to see
if it had suffered any harm.</p>

<p>'I hope it isn't scratched,' I said.  'Henriques trod on it when
I hit him.'</p>

<p>Laputa peered at the gems like a mother at a child who has had
a fall. I saw my chance and took it.  With a great heave I pulled
the boulder down into the pool.  It made a prodigious splash,
sending a shower of spray over Laputa and the Collar. In cover
of it I raced up the shelf, straining for the shelter of the juniper
tree.</p>

<p>A shot rang out and struck the rock above me.  A second later
I had reached the tree and was scrambling up the crack beyond
it.</p>

<p>Laputa did not fire again.  He may have distrusted his shooting,
or seen a better way of it.  He dashed through the stream and
ran up the shelf like a klipspringer after me.  I felt rather
than saw what was happening, and with my heart in my mouth I gathered
my dregs of energy for the last struggle.</p>

<p>You know the nightmare when you are pursued by some awful terror,
and, though sick with fear, your legs have a strange numbness,
and you cannot drag them in obedience to the will.  Such was my
feeling in the crack above the juniper tree.  In truth, I had
passed the bounds of my endurance.  Last night I had walked fifty
miles, and all day I had borne the torments of a dreadful suspense. 
I had been bound and gagged and beaten till the force was out
of my limbs.  Also, and above all, I had had little food, and
I was dizzy with want of sleep. My feet seemed leaden, my hands
had no more grip than putty.  I do not know how I escaped falling
into the pool, for my head was singing and my heart thumping in
my throat.  I seemed to feel Laputa's great hand every second
clawing at my heels.</p>

<p>I had reason for my fears.  He had entered the crack long before
I had reached the top, and his progress was twice as fast as mine. 
When I emerged on the topmost shelf he was scarcely a yard behind
me.  But an overhang checked his bulky figure and gave me a few
seconds' grace.  I needed it all, for these last steps on the
shelf were the totterings of an old man.  Only a desperate resolution
and an extreme terror made me drag one foot after the other. 
Blindly I staggered on to the top of the ravine, and saw before
me the <em>schimmel</em> grazing in the light of the westering
sun.</p>

<p>I forced myself into a sort of drunken run, and crawled into
the saddle.  Behind me, as I turned, I could see Laputa's shoulders
rising over the edge.  I had no knife to cut the knee-halter,
and the horse could not stir.</p>

<p>Then the miracle happened.  When the rope had gagged me, my teeth
must have nearly severed it at one place, and this Laputa had
not noticed when he used it as a knee-halter.  The shock of my
entering the saddle made the <em>schimmel</em> fling up his head
violently, and the rope snapped.  I could not find the stirrups,
but I dug my heels into his sides, and he leaped forward.</p>

<p>At the same moment Laputa began to shoot.  It was a foolish move,
for he might have caught me by running, since I had neither spurs
nor whip, and the horse was hampered by the loose end of rope
at his knee.  In any case, being an indifferent shot, he should
have aimed at the <em>schimmel</em>, not at me; but I suppose
he wished to save his charger.  One bullet sang past my head;
a second did my business for me.  It passed over my shoulder,
as I lay low in the saddle, and grazed the beast's right ear. 
The pain maddened him, and, rope-end and all, he plunged into
a wild gallop.  Other shots came, but they fell far short.  I
saw dimly a native or two&mdash;the men who had followed us&mdash;rush to
intercept me, and I think a spear was flung.  But in a flash we
were past them, and their cries faded behind me. I found the bridle,
reached for the stirrups, and galloped straight for the sunset
and for freedom.</p>
