<p>They come!&mdash;be firm&mdash;in silence rally! The Long Knives our retreat
have found! Hark! their tramp is in the valley, And they hem the
forest round! The burthened boughs with pale scouts quiver, The
echoing hills tumultuous ring, While, across the eddying river,
Their barks, like foaming war-steeds, spring, The bloodhounds
darken land and water, They come&mdash;like buffaloes for slaughter.
&mdash;G. P. <em>MORRIS</em>.</p>

<p>At that point from which the Huron had advanced to the fort,
the Shawnees and Miamis had now collected, preparatory to their
final attack upon it. The wood being thick at this spot, they
had little difficulty in keeping their bodies out of sight, the
besieged being enabled to judge of their position by the points
of their rifles and portions of their dress, which they took no
pains to conceal.</p>

<p>"That means business," said Dernor, loosening his knife, and
examining the priming of his rifle. "What's their idea, Oonamoo?"</p>

<p>"Run all togedder&mdash;make big rush&mdash;all come from one side."</p>

<p>Being satisfied of this, the Huron crossed over to the side of
the hunter, so as to be ready for the assault. He was as cool
as if sitting in his own wigwam, although none was more aware
than himself of the peril that hung over his head. Could the Shawnees
or Miamis once obtain his person, no species of torment that their
fiendish minds could invent would be left untried upon him. But
he had played hide-and-seek too long with death, to be disconcerted
in a moment like this.</p>

<p>"What are they waiting for?" asked Dernor, who began to grow
impatient at the delay.</p>

<p>"Ain't waitin'&mdash;here dey come!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, ten Indians suddenly appeared to view, from behind
as many trees, and, pausing a moment, set up a yell that must
have been heard miles distant, and rushed with the speed of the
whirlwind toward the fort. Half-way across the clearing they had
come, when the sharp crack of two rifles was heard, and the two
foremost savages, making a tremendous bound in the air, came down
to the ground in their death-struggles. But the others were not
checked in the least. On they came, right over the prostrate bodies,
and the next minute were tearing at the pile of logs, with the
fury of madmen.</p>

<p>The Rifleman and the Huron had discharged their rifles together
at the savages, as they came pouring forward; then drawing their
knives, they awaited the onset. The logs, loosely thrown together,
could not long resist the efforts to dislodge them, and, in a
few minutes, came tumbling to the ground. The first bronzed skull
that appeared above them was shattered like an egg-shell, by the
stock of the Huron's rifle; while, as the savages swarmed in,
Dernor stooped, and catching Edith round the waist, bounded clear
of the logs, and dashed at headlong speed across the clearing.
Right behind, like a pack of hounds, poured his relentless enemies,
held in check solely by the Huron, who, covering the retreat of
his white friends, raged like a tiger with his clubbed rifle;
but, powerful and agile as he was, he was finally brought to the
earth, and, heedless of him, the savages poured onward, intent
only on capturing Dernor and Edith.</p>

<p>At this moment the edge of the clearing was reached; the fugitive
had dashed into the wood, and his enemies were just following,
when several flashes illuminated the edge of the forest, and simultaneous
with the report, the remaining Riflemen of the Miami, with one
exception, burst into the clearing and shot forward like a tornado
toward the savages. The number of the whites was increased by
Harry and Jim Smith, but half of the Indians had already gone
to the earth, and the remaining ones broke and scattered as if
a mine had exploded beneath their feet.</p>

<p>"Hello! anybody hurt?" demanded Harry Smith. "Come back here,
Lew, and let us see you."</p>

<p>The fugitive had run quite a distance; but, recognizing the voice
of a friend, he halted, looked back, and then returned. In the
clearing, he saw standing the panting, excited forms of the brothers
Smith, Allmat, George Dernor and Ferdinand Sego! The latter was
leaning on his rifle, and looked up as Lewis and Edith came to
view. He instantly started, as if struck by a bullet, and gazed
at her as though he doubted the evidence of his own eyes. Edith,
on her part, was hardly less agitated. She trembled and leaned
heavily a moment on the hunter's arm, and then, relinquishing
her hold, bounded forward and was clasped in the arms of Sego.
Neither spoke until they had partly recovered from their emotions;
then they conversed in tones so low, that the bystanders, had
they wished, could not have overheard the words that were said.</p>

<p>All this time, as may well be supposed, Lewis Dernor was tortured
by the most agonizing emotions. The beautiful dreams and air-castles
which he had been continually forming and building during the
past few days, now dissolved like mist in the air, and left nothing
but the cold, cheerless reality, far colder and more cheerless
than had ever before impressed him. Sego and Edith were reunited,
and although there appeared to have been some mystery and misunderstanding
between them, it was now cleared up, and their happiness seemed
complete. The Rifleman drew a deep sigh and looked up.</p>

<p>"I say, Lew," said his brother, "I've asked yer half a dozen
times, whether there's any thing that need keep us here any longer?"</p>

<p>"The Huron &mdash;Oonamoo?" asked the hunter, looking around
him.</p>

<p>"Was Oonamoo with you? &mdash;I recollect, now, Tom said he was.
Well, that must be him, then, stretched out yonder."</p>

<p>The two moved toward the prostrate form of the Indian, which
lay upon its face. They rolled him over on his back, but he was
limp and nerveless as a rag. His body was still warm, but to all
appearance he was entirely lifeless&mdash;a gash on the side of his
face, from which a great quantity of blood had streamed over his
person, adding to the ghastly appearance of the body.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he's dead," said Lewis, with a saddened feeling,
as he looked down upon him. "He was a faithful fellow, and had
few equals. I'm sorry he's dead."</p>

<p>"Oonamoo ain't dead," said the prostrate individual, opening
his eyes, and getting upon his feet with some difficulty. "Play
'possum&mdash;dat all."</p>

<p>"You're a good one," said George Dernor, admiringly, as he supported
him. "You've had considerable of a hurt though, along side of
your noddle."</p>

<p>"Hit purty hard&mdash;hurt a <em>leetle</em>," said the Huron.</p>

<p>"We'll dress your wounds as soon as we reach the brook out in
the woods. What did you play 'possum for?"</p>

<p>"Fool Shawnee&mdash;fool Miami&mdash;t'ink dey cotch Lew and gal, den come
and git Oonamoo scalp. If t'ink he ain't dead, kill him; wait
till get out of sight, den run."</p>

<p>The meaning of which was, that the Huron, upon being felled to
the earth, concluded it best to feign death until his enemies
were out of sight, when he would have risen to his feet and fled.
The wound he had received was so severe, that he knew his flight
would be difficult and tardy, and he, therefore, avoided giving
any signs of life as long as he had reason to believe the savages
were in the vicinity. Of course he was perfectly conscious when
the two Riflemen stood over him, and heard their words. Understanding
at once from these the changed condition of affairs, he arose
to his feet, as we have mentioned.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the party was moving slowly through the
wood. The brothers Smith led the way; behind them came Sego and
Edith far more affectionate and loving than she and Dernor had
ever been. The latter, with his brother, and Allmat and Oonamoo,
brought up the rear. In a few minutes they reached the brook,
where the party halted.</p>

<p>The stoical Huron had borne up like a martyr thus far; but the
precipitation with which he sought a seat the moment a pause was
made, showed that he had taxed nature to the utmost. The cool
fluid was taken from the brook in the canteens of the hunters,
all the blood thoroughly washed from the Indian, and then the
wound was carefully bandaged by Edith, from pieces of her own
dress. This done, the savage rose to his feet&mdash;his head being
so swathed and bundled up that it was nearly thrice its ordinary
size&mdash;and looked about him with an air that was truly amusing.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right agin in a few days," said Harry Smith. "Let's
move on, as the day is getting well along."</p>

<p>"Oonamoo don't go furder&mdash;leave you here," said the savage.</p>

<p>"How is this? Come, go with us to the settlement and stay till
your wound gets better," said Lewis.</p>

<p>All joined their entreaties, but it availed nothing. The savage
had made up his mind, and it could not be changed.</p>

<p>"Can't stay &mdash;Shawnees, Delawares, all round&mdash;git much scalp
in woods," and waving them an adieu, he plunged into the forest.</p>

<p>"Injin is Injin!" said Jim Smith; "you can't change his nature.
The missionaries have had a hold of him, and made him an honorable
red-skin, but they can't get that hankering after scalps out of
him. Shall I tell you where he's going? He's going back: to the
clearin' where them dead Injins are stretched, and intends to
get their top-knots. I seen him look at 'em very wishful-like
when we started away. He was too weak, and he didn't want to do
it afore Edith, or he'd 've had 'em afore we left that place."</p>

<p>[The next time the Riflemen encountered the Huron, it was upon
the war-trail, and full a dozen more scalp-locks hung at his girdle!]</p>

<p>Again the party moved forward, now with considerable briskness,
there being no cause for tardiness or delay. Sego and Edith conversed
in low tones, every look and action showing their perfect happiness,
while the hardy leader of the Riflemen was as wretched an object
as it is possible to imagine. They had progressed several miles,
when, as they descended a sort of hollow, they encountered O'Hara,
hurrying along as fast as the shortness of his legs would permit.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he exclaimed, suddenly halting. "Is the row done with?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," replied Harry Smith.</p>

<p>"Who finished it?"</p>

<p>"We all had a hand in it, I reckon."</p>

<p>"It's an all-fired shame. As soon as&mdash;where's Oonamoo?" he abruptly
demanded, looking around him.</p>

<p>"Gone off in the woods for scalps."</p>

<p>"Didn't lose his?"</p>

<p>"No; although he come mighty nigh losing his head."</p>

<p>"It's an all-fired shame," resumed O'Hara. "As soon as he got
inside the fort there with Lew, I streaked it for the settlement
to get the boys. I told you to hurry, but after you got to the
clearin', I wanted you to wait so that I could jine in the fun,
and pitch in promiscuously. Why didn't you do it?"</p>

<p>"Matters were mixed up a little too much to allow us to wait,"
replied Lewis Dernor.</p>

<p>"S'pose they was, but I'm mad and want to lick somebody. Won't
you fight, Lew?"</p>

<p>The latter merely smiled, and the party moved on, O'Hara being
forced to bottle his wrath, as he could find no one upon whom
to expend it. Occasionally, however, he and the brothers Smith
had a war of words, but it amounted to nothing, being attended
by no real ill-feeling upon either side.</p>

<p>It was just growing dark when the party reached the settlement.
The delight with which the fugitives were welcomed by the settlers
need not be described. Many had had the most painful apprehensions
regarding Edith, and nearly every family felt as if one of its
members had been restored, upon her return. And the confidence
which they reposed in the gallant-hearted Rifleman, the reliance
which they placed upon his prowess and bravery, were such that
all felt his death would have been a public calamity.</p>

<p>The Riflemen remained several days in the settlement, there being
no special cause for hurrying their departure. While the members
of this small party enjoyed themselves to the utmost, the sadness
and dejection of their leader was remarked by all. He was often
seen wandering in the woods, silent and moody, resolutely refusing
communication with any one. He carefully avoided Sego and Edith,
until the latter, wondering more than the others at the cause
of his changed behavior, sent word to him that she wished him
to spend an evening with her. Dernor's first impulse was to refuse
the invitation; but, on second thought, he concluded to accept
it, and he returned a reply promising to call upon her on the
following evening.</p>

<p>Edith was living with Smith, where Sego was also spending his
time, and, from the wording of her invitation, he confidently
expected to meet her alone. He was considerably disappointed and
chagrined, therefore, on entering the room, to find Sego seated
within a few feet of her, the expression of both faces showing
that each was full of happiness and utterly delighted with each
other. Both welcomed him, and when he had been seated, Edith asked,
rather abruptly:</p>

<p>"Now, Lewis, what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied, looking at the toe of his moccasin, and
feeling a little stubborn and ugly simply because his fair questioner
was just the opposite.</p>

<p>"Now you needn't tell me that," she persisted. "What makes you
act so strangely&mdash;and keep away from me as though you hated me?"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> ought to know," replied the hunter, more sullenly
than before.</p>

<p>"I? I am sure I do not. Pray, what is it?"</p>

<p>The hunter, who was acting much like a pouting child, refused
to make answer. Edith laughingly repeated her question several
times, but it was not replied to. Still laughing and blushing,
she arose, and moved her chair close beside him; then, sitting
down, placed one of her warm hands in his. Gently patting his
embrowned cheek with the other hand, she asked, in that voice
which none but the maiden can assume who is conscious of her power:</p>

<p>"<em>Won't</em> you tell Edith what troubles you?"</p>

<p>Matters were getting decidedly dangerous. There sat the sullen
hunter, his head bent, his lips closed, and his eyes fixed resolutely
upon the toe of his moccasin. Right before these eyes, so directly
before them that the view of his foot was almost hid, was the
beaming, laughing, radiant face of Edith, looking right up in
his own, her eyes sparkling, and her countenance a thousand times
more lovely than ever. Several times Dernor felt like catching
her to his bosom, and kissing her lips again and again; but, as
he was on the very point of doing so, he remembered that Sego
was in the room, and felt more angered than ever, and gazed harder
than ever at his moccasin.</p>

<p>"Won't you even look at me?" asked Edith, putting her open hand
over his eyes, as if to pull his gaze down. He instantly looked
her steadily in the face, without changing a muscle of his countenance,
while she, folding her hands, returned the gaze with equal steadiness.
Her lips, too, were resolutely closed, but her eyes fairly scintillated
with mischief, and she seemed just able to prevent herself from
laughing outright. How long this <em>oculistic</em> contest would
have continued we can not pretend to say, but it was ended by
Edith asking:</p>

<p>"What makes you look so troubled, Lewis?"</p>

<p>"Because I am," he replied, curtly.</p>

<p>"Tell me the cause, and I will do all I can to help it."</p>

<p>"It's <em>you</em> that have done it!" He spoke with deep feeling.</p>

<p>"I that have done it!" repeated the girl, in consternation. "Why,
how did I do it?"</p>

<p>"Edith!" His words were ringingly clear. They were winged with
reproof. "Do you want me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"When we were alone, you led me to believe that you loved me.
As soon as you saw Sego you went right into his arms, and I was
forgotten."</p>

<p>The lurking mirth and mischief in her face grew more perceptible
each moment, while he was certain, although he did not look in
that direction, that Sego was doing his best to smother a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" she asked, looking down from his face and
toying with a button at his waist.</p>

<p>"<em>What of that?</em>" he exclaimed, indignantly. "It is the
meanest thing a person could do."</p>

<p>The reader must be indulgent, and consider the circumstances
in which the hunter was placed. The mischievous Edith was tormenting
him. How could she, being a woman, help it?</p>

<p>"Don't you believe I love you?" she asked, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"Believe it? To my sorrow and mortification, <em>I know</em>
you don't."</p>

<p>"Lewis!"</p>

<p>"You love Sego, and I can be nothing to you but one of many friends,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Yes, dearly do I love Sego!" the maiden replied, with the old
roguishness in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Fudge!" he exclaimed, impatiently, and making a movement as
if to move away. "Edith"&mdash;he spoke earnestly&mdash;"I can not bear
this trifling. I am sorry you have treated me thus. I must leave
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, you must not leave me!" she as earnestly answered.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to keep me here longer, to mortify me?"</p>

<p>"I have something more to say to you."</p>

<p>"Say it quickly, then."</p>

<p>"In the first place, look straight into my eyes, as you did a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p>The hunter did as requested, although it was a harder task than
he suspected.</p>

<p>"Now," said Edith, "in the first place, <em>I love you</em>;
and, in the second place, I love him (pointing to Sego); but (here
a pause) I do not feel the same toward each of you."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you did, the way things looked in the clearing!"</p>

<p>Edith laughed outright, and then said:</p>

<p>"Lewis, let me tell you something. The man sitting there, whom
you know as Ferdinand Sego, <em>is my own father</em>!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" demanded Dernor, almost springing off his seat,
"Then, by thunder, if you ain't the most noble gal in the wide
creation, and I the biggest fool."</p>

<p>And he embraced her, unmindful of the presence of Sego, who seemed
in danger of an epileptic fit from his excessive laughter.</p>

<p>"How is this? Let's understand matters," said the Rifleman, a
few minutes later.</p>

<p>"I can soon explain," said Sego. "To commence at the beginning,
my name is Ferdinand Sego Sudbury. I emigrated out in this western
country some years since, with my wife, and only daughter, Edith,
here. Shortly after, my wife died; and, feeling lonely and dejected,
I took to wandering in the woods, making long hunts, to while
away the time. You remember when I encountered you, and received
an invitation to make one of your number. I accepted it, with
the understanding that I could not spend my entire time with you.
When not with you, I was at my own cabin, with my daughter. I
joined under the simple name which you have known me by, for no
reason at all save that it was a mere notion, I having used that
name in the East on more than one occasion. I kept my relations
with your band secret from Edith, as I did not wish to alarm her
by letting her know that I took part in your desperate expeditions.</p>

<p>"It happened on one occasion, when wandering along the Ohio,
on my return to my cabin, that I encountered a flat-boat, in which
were several of my acquaintances. At their urgent request, I waded
out, was taken on board, and accompanied them to their destination,
down the river. Here I left them, and several days after reached
my cabin. I found Edith gone. The undisturbed condition of the
furniture forbade the supposition that she had been carried off
by the savages. I endeavored to find her trail, but a storm obliterated
all traces, and I was compelled to give her up as lost.</p>

<p>"It was quite a while before I rejoined you. When I did, I said
nothing of my loss, not believing that you knew any thing about
it. It seems singular that I should have omitted to mention it;
but, I will not deny I had a lingering suspicion that Edith had
eloped with some young hunter, whose acquaintance she had formed
during my absence. After I had been with you some time, I mentioned
her name, but, you not having heard it, I gained no satisfaction
by doing so.</p>

<p>"What happened after this is known, perhaps, better to you than
to me. If you love Edith, as I rather suspect you do, from all
I have heard and seen, you are welcome to her. I know she has
a strong affection for you."</p>

<p>It is wonderful how a matter like the one in question will become
known in a small community. The next day there was not a person
in the whole settlement who was not aware of what has been related
in the last few pages, and there was not one who did not rejoice
in the happiness of the noble-hearted leader of the Riflemen of
the Miami.</p>


<p>As we have hinted in the commencement of this work, the organization
known by the name last mentioned, kept up its existence several
years longer. Lewis Dernor remained its nominal leader, but, after
his marriage, the exploits of its members became less frequent
and noted. All, however, joined in the great border war which
raged for several years previous to 1794. In Anthony Wayne's great
battle of this year, Tom O'Hara and Allmat fell, and, as has been
said in another place, the organization was broken up, never again
to be revived. Lewis Dernor and Edith lived to a ripe old age,
and their descendants at this day are among the most respectable
and widely-known of the inhabitants of Southern Ohio.</p>
