As I remember, the spring came late that year in Carlisle.  It was
May before the weather began to satisfy the grown-ups.  But we
children were more easily pleased, and we thought April a splendid
month because the snow all went early and left gray, firm, frozen
ground for our rambles and games.  As the days slipped by they
grew more gracious; the hillsides began to look as if they were
thinking of mayflowers; the old orchard was washed in a bath of
tingling sunshine and the sap stirred in the big trees; by day the
sky was veiled with delicate cloud drift, fine and filmy as woven
mist; in the evenings a full, low moon looked over the valleys, as
pallid and holy as some aureoled saint; a sound of laughter and
dream was on the wind and the world grew young with the mirth of
April breezes.
<P>
"It's so nice to be alive in the spring," said the Story Girl one
twilight as we swung on the boughs of Uncle Stephen's walk.
<P>
"It's nice to be alive any time," said Felicity, complacently.
<P>
"But it's nicer in the spring," insisted the Story Girl.  "When
I'm dead I think I'll FEEL dead all the rest of the year, but when
spring comes I'm sure I'll feel like getting up and being alive
again."
<P>
"You do say such queer things," complained Felicity.  "You won't
be really dead any time.  You'll be in the next world.  And I
think it's horrid to talk about people being dead anyhow."
<P>
"We've all got to die," said Sara Ray solemnly, but with a certain
relish.  It was as if she enjoyed looking forward to something in
which nothing, neither an unsympathetic mother, nor the cruel fate
which had made her a colourless little nonentity, could prevent
her from being the chief performer.
<P>
"I sometimes think," said Cecily, rather wearily, "that it isn't
so dreadful to die young as I used to suppose."
<P>
She prefaced her remark with a slight cough, as she had been all
too apt to do of late, for the remnants of the cold she had caught
the night we were lost in the storm still clung to her.
<P>
"Don't talk such nonsense, Cecily," cried the Story Girl with
unwonted sharpness, a sharpness we all understood.  All of us, in
our hearts, though we never spoke of it to each other, thought
Cecily was not as well as she ought to be that spring, and we
hated to hear anything said which seemed in any way to touch or
acknowledge the tiny, faint shadow which now and again showed
itself dimly athwart our sunshine.
<P>
"Well, it was you began talking of being dead," said Felicity
angrily.  "I don't think it's right to talk of such things. 
Cecily, are you sure your feet ain't damp?  We ought to go in
anyhow--it's too chilly out here for you."
<P>
"You girls had better go," said Dan, "but I ain't going in till
old Isaac Frewen goes.  I've no use for him."
<P>
"I hate him, too," said Felicity, agreeing with Dan for once in
her life.  "He chews tobacco all the time and spits on the floor--
the horrid pig!"
<P>
"And yet his brother is an elder in the church," said Sara Ray
wonderingly.
<P>
"I know a story about Isaac Frewen," said the Story Girl.  "When
he was young he went by the name of Oatmeal Frewen and he got it
this way.  He was noted for doing outlandish things.  He lived at
Markdale then and he was a great, overgrown, awkward fellow, six
feet tall.  He drove over to Baywater one Saturday to visit his
uncle there and came home the next afternoon, and although it was
Sunday he brought a big bag of oatmeal in the wagon with him. 
When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service was going on
there, and he concluded to stop and go in.  But he didn't like to
leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it,
because there were always mischievous boys around, so he hoisted
the bag on his back and walked into church with it and right to
the top of the aisle to Grandfather King's pew.  Grandfather King
used to say he would never forget it to his dying day.  The
minister was preaching and everything was quiet and solemn when he
heard a snicker behind him.  Grandfather King turned around with a
terrible frown--for you know in those days it was thought a
dreadful thing to laugh in church--to rebuke the offender; and
what did he see but that great, hulking young Isaac stalking up
the aisle, bending a little forward under the weight of a big bag
of oatmeal?  Grandfather King was so amazed he couldn't laugh, but
almost everyone else in the church was laughing, and grandfather
said he never blamed them, for no funnier sight was ever seen. 
Young Isaac turned into grandfather's pew and thumped the bag of
oatmeal down on the seat with a thud that cracked it.  Then he
plumped down beside it, took off his hat, wiped his face, and
settled back to listen to the sermon, just as if it was all a
matter of course.  When the service was over he hoisted his bag up
again, marched out of church, and drove home.  He could never
understand why it made so much talk; but he was known by the name
of Oatmeal Frewen for years."
<P>
Our laughter, as we separated, rang sweetly through the old
orchard and across the far, dim meadows.  Felicity and Cecily went
into the house and Sara Ray and the Story Girl went home, but
Peter decoyed me into the granary to ask advice.
<P>
"You know Felicity has a birthday next week," he said, "and I want
to write her an ode."
<P>
"A--a what?" I gasped.
<P>
"An ode," repeated Peter, gravely.  "It's poetry, you know.  I'll
put it in Our Magazine."
<P>
"But you can't write poetry, Peter," I protested.
<P>
"I'm going to try," said Peter stoutly.  "That is, if you think
she won't be offended at me."
<P>
"She ought to feel flattered," I replied.
<P>
"You never can tell how she'll take things," said Peter gloomily. 
"Of course I ain't going to sign my name, and if she ain't pleased
I won't tell her I wrote it.  Don't you let on."
<P>
I promised I wouldn't and Peter went off with a light heart.  He
said he meant to write two lines every day till he got it done.
<P>
Cupid was playing his world-old tricks with others than poor Peter
that spring.  Allusion has been made in these chronicles to one,
Cyrus Brisk, and to the fact that our brown-haired, soft-voiced
Cecily had found favour in the eyes of the said Cyrus.  Cecily did
not regard her conquest with any pride.  On the contrary, it
annoyed her terribly to be teased about Cyrus.  She declared she
hated both him and his name.  She was as uncivil to him as sweet
Cecily could be to anyone, but the gallant Cyrus was nothing
daunted.  He laid determined siege to Cecily's young heart by all
the methods known to love-lorn swains.  He placed delicate
tributes of spruce gum, molasses taffy, "conversation" candies and
decorated slate pencils on her desk; he persistently "chose" her
in all school games calling for a partner; he entreated to be
allowed to carry her basket from school; he offered to work her
sums for her; and rumour had it that he had made a wild statement
to the effect that he meant to ask if he might see her home some
night from prayer meeting.  Cecily was quite frightened that he
would; she confided to me that she would rather die than walk home
with him, but that if he asked her she would be too bashful to say
no.  So far, however, Cyrus had not molested her out of school,
nor had he as yet thumped Willy Fraser--who was reported to be
very low in his spirits over the whole affair.
<P>
And now Cyrus had written Cecily a letter--a love letter, mark
you.  Moreover, he had sent it through the post-office, with a
real stamp on it.  Its arrival made a sensation among us.  Dan
brought it from the office and, recognizing the handwriting of
Cyrus, gave Cecily no peace until she showed us the letter.  It
was a very sentimental and rather ill-spelled epistle in which the
inflammable Cyrus reproached her in heart-rending words for her
coldness, and begged her to answer his letter, saying that if she
did he would keep the secret "in violets."  Cyrus probably meant
"inviolate" but Cecily thought it was intended for a poetical
touch.  He signed himself "your troo lover, Cyrus Brisk" and added
in a postcript that he couldn't eat or sleep for thinking of her.
<P>
"Are you going to answer it?" asked Dan.
<P>
"Certainly not," said Cecily with dignity.
<P>
"Cyrus Brisk wants to be kicked," growled Felix, who never seemed
to be any particular friend of Willy Fraser's either.  "He'd
better learn how to spell before he takes to writing love
letters."
<P>
"Maybe Cyrus will starve to death if you don't," suggested Sara
Ray.
<P>
"I hope he will," said Cecily cruelly.  She was truly vexed over
the letter; and yet, so contradictory a thing is the feminine
heart, even at twelve years old, I think she was a little
flattered by it also.  It was her first love letter and she
confided to me that it gives you a very queer feeling to get it. 
At all events--the letter, though unanswered, was not torn up.  I
feel sure Cecily preserved it.  But she walked past Cyrus next
morning at school with a frozen countenance, evincing not the
slightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection.  Cecily
winced when Pat caught a mouse, visited a school chum the day the
pigs were killed that she might not hear their squealing, and
would not have stepped on a caterpillar for anything; yet she did
not care at all how much she made the brisk Cyrus suffer.
<P>
Then, suddenly, all our spring gladness and Maytime hopes were
blighted as by a killing frost.  Sorrow and anxiety pervaded our
days and embittered our dreams by night.  Grim tragedy held sway
in our lives for the next fortnight.
<P>
Paddy disappeared.  One night he lapped his new milk as usual at
Uncle Roger's dairy door and then sat blandly on the flat stone
before it, giving the world assurance of a cat, sleek sides
glistening, plumy tail gracefully folded around his paws,
brilliant eyes watching the stir and flicker of bare willow boughs
in the twilight air above him.  That was the last seen of him.  In
the morning he was not.
<P>
At first we were not seriously alarmed.  Paddy was no roving
Thomas, but occasionally he vanished for a day or so.  But when
two days passed without his return we became anxious, the third
day worried us greatly, and the fourth found us distracted.
<P>
"Something has happened to Pat," the Story Girl declared
miserably.  "He never stayed away from home more than two days in
his life."
<P>
"What could have happened to him?" asked Felix.
<P>
"He's been poisoned--or a dog has killed him," answered the Story 
Girl in tragic tones.
<P>
Cecily began to cry at this; but tears were of no avail.  Neither
was anything else, apparently.  We searched every nook and cranny
of barns and out-buildings and woods on both the King farms; we
inquired far and wide; we roved over Carlisle meadows calling
Paddy's name, until Aunt Janet grew exasperated and declared we
must stop making such exhibitions of ourselves.  But we found and
heard no trace of our lost pet.  The Story Girl moped and refused
to be comforted; Cecily declared she could not sleep at night for
thinking of poor Paddy dying miserably in some corner to which he
had dragged his failing body, or lying somewhere mangled and torn
by a dog.  We hated every dog we saw on the ground that he might
be the guilty one.
<P>
"It's the suspense that's so hard," sobbed the Story Girl.  "If I
just knew what had happened to him it wouldn't be QUITE so hard. 
But I don't know whether he's dead or alive.  He may be living and
suffering, and every night I dream that he has come home and when
I wake up and find it's only a dream it just breaks my heart."
<P>
"It's ever so much worse than when he was so sick last fall," said
Cecily drearily.  "Then we knew that everything was done for him
that could be done."
<P>
We could not appeal to Peg Bowen this time.  In our desperation we
would have done it, but Peg was far away.  With the first breath
of spring she was up and off, answering to the lure of the long
road.  She had not been seen in her accustomed haunts for many a
day.  Her pets were gaining their own living in the woods and her
house was locked up.
