<p>The race between Wharton Edwards and the famous Shawanoe runner,
Blazing Arrow, was to come off at last, but under far different
circumstances than either had ever anticipated.</p>

<p>The wretch, while under the influence of liquor, had attempted
the life of the youth, and now, when his own natural self, he
was determined to run him down, and to his death. He hated the
whole race with a consuming hatred, and his wrath against this
lad was more intense than against any human being. It was he that
had the audacity to think himself worthy of running a race with
him, who had defeated the most renowned runners of the Wyandots,
Pottawatomies, and the adjoining tribes, to say nothing of his
own people.</p>

<p>The action of the Shawanoes, when young Edwards made his leap
of the chasm, can be understood. The youth's life was spared,
where no other person would have been permitted to live after
placing himself in their power. Blazing Arrow, as well as several
of his associates, recognized the youth the instant they saw his
face, and a hurried consultation took place as to what should
be done.</p>

<p>But for the presence of their champion they would not have permitted
him his slight advantage; but their faith in Blazing Arrow was
as complete as his own, besides which he was one of their leaders.
He ordered them to remain quiet, or rather to devote themselves
to bringing down what whites were near, while he made a little
dash and brought back the fugitive.</p>

<p>This was how it came about that Wharton Edwards, instead of being
pursued by a score of Shawanoes, started off with but a single
warrior trailing after him.</p>

<p>But it is noticeable, further, that the same pursuer carried
his rifle, or rather that of the youth; for, with the characteristic
refinement of cruelty, he meant to add this little triumph to
his capture of the lad when he should run him down and smite him
to the earth.</p>

<p>Wharton had no weapon other than his hunting-knife, while his
foe took good care to see that a weapon was at his own command.
He was the one who, if any accident befell himself, would feel
pleasure in shooting down the lad that had never harmed him.</p>

<p>The sight of Blazing Arrow gave Wharton a knowledge of the situation,
and during the few minutes that he was dodging through the trees
he tried to decide upon the right course to follow.</p>

<p>They were but a short way from the main trail. This was clearly
marked, although it was travelled so little that in many places
the overhanging limbs interfered with one's passage. He believed
he could dash along this faster than his pursuer, and but for
his anxiety about Larry Murphy he probably would have attempted
to do so, but the report of a rifle which reached his ears a few
minutes later deepened his fears and increased his anxiety.</p>

<p>If he should put forth all the speed of which he was capable,
it was not likely to surpass that of the Shawanoe, who was accustomed
to dodging among tree trunks. There was little to be gained by
speculating at this stage of the contest, but he concluded to
go ahead until the opportunity was more favorable for turning
his own amazing fleetness to account.</p>

<p>Besides, it should be stated that Wharton was not yet certain
that he could beat Blazing Arrow in a contest of speed. The Indian
was a wonderful runner, and the youth was not certain by any means
that the red man would not overhaul him when the test should take
place.</p>

<p>"At any rate he has got to do the hardest work of his life before
he captures my scalp," muttered the lad, compressing his lips
and ducking under a limb which would have caught under his chin
if he had neglected the precaution.</p>

<p>He headed for the trail, darting a look behind him now and then
to note their relative speed. As nearly as he could judge, it
was about the same, but as he could not know whether Blazing Arrow
was putting forth his best efforts or not, the knowledge was of
little benefit. At the moment of striking the path, Wharton recalled
a fact that had slipped his mind until then. Less than an eighth
of a mile in advance the trail crossed a natural clearing where,
for fully a fourth of a mile, not a tree or shrub obtruded. Then
the two could do their best, and the question of supremacy would
be decided, providing the red man indulged in no treachery. Blazing
Arrow dropped into the path at a point about a hundred yards behind
the fugitive, which was a little more than the space separating
them at the moment of starting.</p>

<p>It was necessary to keep the advantage he possessed, and to gain
all he could before the plain was reached. If Wharton should prove
himself superior to the Shawanoe, the latter would resort to his
rifle, and either kill him or wound him so that he could not run.
If the fugitive was the inferior, he must fall into the hands
of his enemy; so that, no matter how it eventuated, the situation
of the youth was full of peril.</p>

<p>"I guess I may as well let myself out while I have the chance,"
the latter muttered, a moment after striking the trail.</p>

<p>And Wharton proceeded to "let himself out," while Blazing Arrow,
the Shawanoe, lost no time in doing likewise.</p>

<p>Wharton's aim was to increase the distance between himself and
Blazing Arrow as much as he possibly could before reaching the
clearing, half a mile wide, where the way was open and the test
of speed would be decisive.</p>

<p>Within the same moment that he recalled the existence of the
clearing he was dashing along the trail like a terrified deer.
This work proved harder than he anticipated. The obtruding branches
swished his face with smarting violence, and more than one twig
cut his forehead and nose like the lash of a whip. He thrust out
his hands to ward these aside, and they hurt his hands.</p>

<p>He kept it up, however, for he was now running for life, and
what is to be compared to such a stake? But these obstructions,
despite all he could do, retarded his progress. The alarming truth
quickly became manifest that instead of gaining ground, as he
had hoped, he was losing it.</p>

<p>"Suppose he can beat me?" was the terrifying thought that almost
paralyzed him for the moment; "but," he added, "he hasn't done
it yet!"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe did not utter any cry, and he was so far to the
rear that Wharton did not hear him as he came along the trail
with the grim certainty of fate. He was a marvellous runner, and
he did not mean to allow the detested youth, whose beard was not
yet grown, to get away from him.</p>

<p>More than once, while speeding in this fashion, young Edwards
asked himself whether he could elude his enemy by leaping aside
or hiding among the trees. Possibly he might have done it could
he have drawn beyond sight of him for a few minutes only, so that
his divergence would not be seen. But just there lay the difficulty,
and he dared not make the attempt.</p>

<p>It was a sight that would have tried the nerves of the bravest
man when he looked back and caught a glimpse of the Indian warrior,
partly hidden by the brushing limbs and vegetation, as he sped
forward like a furious animal, and knew it was a mortal enemy
that was after him, impelled by a hatred which nothing but death
could quench.</p>

<p>The fugitive determined that for the time he would not look behind
him. Almost unconsciously to himself, when he did so, he lost
a little ground.</p>

<p>The straining vision which was now cast forward saw the light
made by the clearing or opening in front. A few more bounds and
he struck the margin of the space, which for half a mile was as
free from trees as a stretch of Western prairie. Here was the
place for the supreme test, and the youth, with a muttered prayer,
bent all his energies to the task, fully alive to the stake at
issue.</p>

<p>Not a breath of air was stirring on this mild summer afternoon,
but the wind created by his arrowy-speed was like a gale as it
rushed by his face and lifted the short auburn hair about his
neck until it floated straight out. The arms were bent at the
elbows, the chest thrown forward, while the shapely limbs worked
with the swiftness and grace of a piece of perfect machinery.
The feet doubled in and over each other with bewildering quickness,
there seeming at times to be half a dozen of them on the ground,
in the air, and to the rear at the same time.</p>

<p>The stride was tremendous. The handsome face of the youth was
pale with an unshakable resolve, and the thin lips were compressed,
his breath coming thick and fast through the nostrils. The hazel
eyes gleamed and the brows were knitted as with a person who means
to do or die.</p>

<p>Ah, that was a race worth travelling many a mile to see! Had
Simon Kenton, or Daniel Boone, or Anthony McClelland, or the Wetzel
brothers, been in that open clearing, they would have stood like
statues, wrapt in admiration and wonder, for never could they
have beheld before such a magnificent exhibition of prowess in
the way of speed.</p>

<p>Every thrilling element was present, for not far to the rear
rushed a six-foot Shawanoe, who, like the youth in advance, strained
every muscle to the highest tension. And he was a frightful object
as he ran, for his face was that of a race-horse. The long coarse
locks streamed behind him like a whipping pennant in a hurricane;
and one of the stained eagle-feathers in the crown was snatched
loose and fluttered backward. The naturally hideous face was made
more so by the red and black patches daubed in fantastic splashes
over it. The sinewy chest was bare, but the fringes of the parti-colored
leggings and moccasins flickered and twinkled in the sunlight
as the Shawanoe thundered across the clearing, his black eyes
fixed on the flying figure in front, and his countenance distorted
by a passion his terrible race is so capable of feeling.</p>

<p>As Blazing Arrow ran, he carried the youth's rifle in his right
hand. It was grasped just in front of the lock, the muzzle pointing
ahead, as though he had but to press the trigger to bring down
the fugitive without a change of aim. The left hand rested on
the knife thrust in his girdle, the position of the two hands
suggesting that he was thirsting to use both weapons upon the
lad whom he sought so desperately to run down.</p>
