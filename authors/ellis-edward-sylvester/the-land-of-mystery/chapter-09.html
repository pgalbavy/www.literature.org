<p>The savages that had shown such pluck in the instances described,
now gave another striking proof of their courage.</p>

<p>At the moment the mystified explorers were discussing the strange
appearance and actions of the white men, more than twenty of the
athletic barbarians issued as stealthily as phantoms from the
trail leading from the forest and crouched along the edge of the
timber.</p>

<p>Their silence added impressiveness to the singular scene and
prevented their movements being observed except by Bippo, who
was so terrified that he could only tremble and point at them.</p>

<p>They were partly hidden by the shadow which put out a short distance
from the fringe of the wood, but there could be no doubt of their
hostile intentions.  They assumed the form of a line, somewhat
after the manner of the combatants in the square of the native
village.  This was to give free play to their arms in flinging
their javelins.</p>

<p>The occasion was one in which the fate of the explorers depended
upon their promptness and bravery.  Anything like timidity or
hesitation meant sure destruction, and the whites knew it.</p>

<p>"Into the boat!" commanded Ashman, addressing Bippo and his friends.</p>

<p>The words were like an electric shock to the helpers, who instantly
clambered into the canoe and lay flat behind the luggage, where
they were safe from the poisoned missiles that would soon be flying
through the air.</p>

<p>Those natives, with their crude weapons, were only incumbrances
in a crisis like the present.</p>

<p>The whites exchanged but a word or two and then opened the ball.</p>

<p>A savage, evidently the leader, and one who probably now saw
the whites for the first time, had the audacity to step forward
a couple of paces, and with a yell of defiance, raised his spear
over his head.</p>

<p>Before he could launch the missile Jared Long sent a bullet through
him, and then, shifting the muzzle of his Winchester toward the
line of dusky figures, he blazed away as fast as he could sight
the weapon and pull the trigger.</p>

<p>At the same instant the Professor and Ashman opened, and the
bombardment which followed was enough to strike terror to the
hearts of a hundred men.</p>

<p>It was more than the savages could stand, but, great as was their
panic, most of them hurled one or two javelins apiece at the white
men who stood fearlessly erect and combated them.  They had come
from their village prepared for a fight, and each warrior was
provided with several of the poisoned missiles.</p>

<p>Before the explorers had emptied the magazines of their Winchesters
not a live foe was left.  The affrighted survivors, shrieking
with terror, scrambled hastily back among the trees, some of them
dragging the dead bodies, so that the spot was freed of the dusky
miscreants with as much suddenness as it had been occupied by
them.</p>

<p>There were plenty of shots left, and, after the disappearance
of the savages, the whites fired into the woods, where they had
vanished, not with the expectation of accomplishing anything more
than adding to the panic.</p>

<p>When it was sure the wretches were gone, our friends made their
preparations for leaving the spot, for nothing was clearer than
that such was the wisest step to take.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that all the trouble had taken place
on the left bank of the Xingu, no savages having been observed
on the western bank.  The daring of the savages could not be questioned. 
They had faced death repeatedly, and now, that they had the strongest
of all motives&mdash;revenge&mdash;to prompt them, they were sure to use
every means possible to bring about the ruin of the whites and
their three native companions.</p>

<p>The forest, extending so close to the river, was a constant menace,
for it afforded the best kind of shelter.  Indeed, had the savages
been less courageous and kept among the trees, taking a stealthy
shot as the chance offered, they would have had a much better
chance of doing what they wished and with less risk to themselves.</p>

<p>The javelins flung in blind desperation went wide of their mark,
with the exception of one which whizzed over the canoe within
a few inches of Bippo's head.  The fellow was peeping furtively
above the luggage, and heard the whizz of the missile passing
fearfully close.  He instantly ducked with such emphasis that
he almost broke his nose against the bottom of the craft.</p>

<p>Striking the water beyond, the spear sank as abruptly as if it
were a cannon ball.</p>

<p>The belief of our friends was that the troublesome natives were
entirely confined to the left bank, though it was not likely they
refrained from crossing so narrow a stream as the Xingu at its
upper portion.</p>

<p>If the savages had been slow to learn from their first experience
with the white men, there could be no doubt that the valuable
lesson of the last encounter would not be lost upon them.  The
space between the edge of the wood and the margin of the river
was so slight that it was the easiest thing in the world for one
of them to launch his javelin with terrific force across it, and
they would do so before morning, if the chance were given them.</p>

<p>If the other bank were reached, the savages would be easily detected
in the bright moonlight, if they attempted to swim across or used
some of their own boats.  The only way in which they could avoid
detection would be by crossing above or below this point.</p>

<p>They would hardly ascend the Xingu for this purpose, since the
rapids would oblige them to travel a long way, and the place of
ferryage, therefore, was likely to be below the campfire.</p>

<p>Such were the views of the whites, as they shoved the canoe into
the stream, and stepping within, seized the paddles, which the
helpers were too frightened to use effectively, while so near
the dreaded shore.</p>

<p>Fred Ashman had taken but a few strokes when he handed the implement
to Bippo and ordered him to use it.  Then, resuming his Winchester,
he faced the land, half suspecting they would not be allowed to
reach the other side without some demonstration on the part of
their fierce antagonists.</p>

<p>Time was of the first importance, and all the paddles in the
craft were plied with the utmost possible vigor, each yard passed
adding to the hope that hostilities were over for the time.</p>

<p>Probably three-fourths of the distance was accomplished, when
a low exclamation from Ashman caused all to cease paddling and
gaze at the shore which he was watching with such interest.</p>

<p>The most gigantic savage yet seen had emerged from the forest
trail, but instead of advancing to the river's edge, he halted
just far enough from the wood to allow the moonlight to inclose
him.  He was thus in almost as plain-sight as if it were mid-day.</p>

<p>He stood in silent contemplation of the strangers that had invaded
his dominions and given his people such a dear lesson.  Confident
that he could accomplish no harm, even if he wished to try it,
Ashman refrained from firing, while the company surveyed him with
a feeling akin to admiration.</p>

<p>He was over six feet in height and of massive proportions.  He
would have been an ugly customer in a tussle where the conditions
were equal, and Ashman could not forbear the thought that he was
one of the contestants in the frightful sport he had witnessed
near the village. If so, there was little doubt that he was hailed
the champion.  It may have been that he had hastened along the
forest path, burning with a desire to assail the mysterious beings
who had used his countrymen so ill, and he was filled with chagrin
and disappointment that he had arrived too late.</p>

<p>But there was no end to the fancies that might be formed concerning
him.  That there was little imagination about Bippo was shown
by his timid request to his masters to shoot the savage.  To Bippo
the elimination of a single enemy of such formidable mien was
a consummation devoutly to be prayed for.  But the Professor reminded
the native that they only slew in self-defense.</p>

<p>All at once, the herculean savage was seen to make a motion of
his arm, and before the act could be understood, the terrified
Bippo called out that he was about to throw his javelin.  At the
same instant he and his two companions cowered in the bottom of
the boat, where they were abundantly protected.</p>

<p>"The poor fellow is disappointed," laughed Ashman, "and he must
show his anger, even if it requires the loss of one of his&#11834;"</p>

<p>Something like the flitting of a bird's wing whisked so close
to the speaker's face that he involuntarily threw back his head. 
At the same instant, a heavy javelin crashed through the side
of the boat, as if it were cardboard, and splashed out of sight
in the water beyond.</p>

<p>The missile of the gigantic savage had passed between Ashman
and the Professor, missing both by a few inches.</p>

<p>The young man, like a flash, brought his rifle to his shoulder
and sighted at the savage who was still in plain sight, as if
defying the whites to do their worst.</p>

<p>But Ashman did not pull the trigger.  Lowering his weapon, he
said:</p>

<p>"You have earned your life."</p>
