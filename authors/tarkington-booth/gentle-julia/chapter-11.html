<p>The stairway was crowded as he descended; and as he looked down
upon the heads and shoulders of the throng below, in Julia's hall,
the thought came to him that since he had the first and last dances
and supper engaged with Julia, the hostess, this was almost the
next thing to being the host. It was a pleasing thought, and a
slight graciousness now flavoured his salutations.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs he became part of the file of young
people who were moving into one of the large rooms where Julia
stood to "receive." And then, between two heads before him, he
caught a first glimpse of her;&mdash;and all the young birds fluttering
in his chest burst into song; his heart fainted, his head ballooned,
his feet seemed to dangle from him at the ends of two strings.</p>

<p>There glowed sapphire-eyed Julia; never had she been prettier.</p>

<p>The group closed, shutting out the vision, and he found himself
able to dry his brow and get back his breath before moving forward
in a cold and aristocratic attitude. Then he became incapable
of any attitude&mdash;he was before her, and she greeted him. A buzzing
of the universe confused him: he would have stood forever, but
pressure from behind pushed him on; and so, enveloped in a scented
cloud, he passed into a corner. He tried to remember what he had
said to her, but could not; perhaps it would have discouraged
him to know that all he had said was, "Well!"</p>

<p>Now there rattled out a challenge of drums; loud music struck
upon the air. Starting instantly to go to Julia, Noble's left
leg first received the electric impulse and crossed his laggard
right; but he was no pacer, and thus stumbled upon himself and
plunged. Still convulsive, he came headlong before her, and was
the only person near who remained unaware that his dispersal of
an intervening group had the appearance of extreme unconventionality.
Noble knew nothing except that this was his dance with Her.</p>

<p>Then heaven played with him. She came close and touched him exquisitely.
She placed a lovely hand upon his shoulder, her other lovely cool
hand in one of his. The air filled with bursting stars.</p>

<p>They danced.</p>

<p>Noble was conscious of her within his clasping arm, but conscious
of her as nothing human. The fluffy white bodice pressed by his
hand seemed to be that of some angel doll; the charming shoulder
that sometimes touched his was made of a divine mist. Only the
pretty head, close to his, was actual; the black-sapphire eyes
gave him a little blue-black glance, now and then, and seemed
to laugh.</p>

<p>In truth, they did, though Julia's lips remained demure. So far
as Noble was able to comprehend what he was doing, he was floating
rhythmically to a faint, far music; but he was almost unconscious,
especially from the knees down. But to the eye of observers incapable
of perceiving that Noble was floating, it appeared that he was
out of step most of the time, and danced rather hoppingly. However,
these mannerisms were no novelty with him, and it cannot be denied
that girls at dances usually hurried impulsively away to speak
to somebody when they saw him coming. One such creature even went
so far as to whisper to Julia now, during a collision: "How'd
you get caught?"</p>

<p>Julia was loyal; she gave no sign of comprehension, but valiantly
swung onward with Noble, bumped and bumping everywhere, in spite
of the most extraordinary and graceful dexterity on her part.</p>

<p>"That's one reason she's such a terrible belle," a damsel whispered
to another.</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"The way she'll be just as nice to anybody like Noble Dill as
she is to anybody," said the first. "Look at her now: she won't
laugh at him a bit, though everybody else is."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't laugh either," said the other. "Not in Julia's
position. I'd be too busy being afraid."</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>"Of getting a sprained ankle!"</p>

<p>It is well that telepathy remains, as a science, lethargic. Speculation
sets before us the prospect of a Life Beyond in which every thought
is communicated without the intervention of speech: a state wherein
all neighbours and neighbourhoods would promptly be dispersed
and few friendships long endure, one fears. If to Noble Dill's
active consciousness had penetrated merely the things thought
about him and his dancing, in this one short period of time before
the music for that dance stopped, he might easily have been understood
if he had hurried forth, obtained explosives, and blown up the
place, himself indeed included. As matters providentially were
in reality, when the music stopped he stood confounded: he thought
the dance had just begun.</p>

<p>His mouth remained open until the necessary gestures of articulation
intermittently closed it as he said: "<em>Oh!</em> That was <em>divine</em>!"</p>

<p>Too-gentle Julia agreed.</p>

<p>"You said I could have part of some in between the first and
last," he reminded her. "Can I have the first part of the next?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "I'm afraid not. The next is Mr. Clairdyce's and
I really <em>promised</em> him I wouldn't give <em>any</em> of
his away or let anybody cut in."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Noble, frowning a little, "would you be willing
for me to cut in on the third?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not. That's Newland Sanders', and I promised him
the same thing."</p>

<p>"Well, the one after that?"</p>

<p>"No, that one's Mr. Clairdyce's, too."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em>?" Noble was greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Two that quick with old Baldy Clairdyce!" he exclaimed, raising
his voice, but unaware of the fervour with which he spoke. "Two
with that old&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Sh</em>, Noble," she said, though she laughed. "He isn't
really old; he's just middle-aged, and only the least bit bald,
just enough to be distinguished-looking."</p>

<p>"Well, you know what <em>I</em> think of him!" he returned with
a vehemence not moderated. "<em>I</em> don't think he's distinguished-looking;
I think he's simply and plainly a regular old&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Sh!</em>" Julia warned him again. "He's standing with some
people just behind us," she added.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Noble, "can I cut in on the next one after
that?"</p>

<p>She consulted a surreptitious little card. "I'm afraid you'll
have to wait till quite a little later on, Noble. That one is
poor Mr. Ridgely's. I promised him I wouldn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then can I cut in on the next one after that?"</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Clairdyce's," said Julia&mdash;and she blushed.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" said Noble. "Oh, my goodness!"</p>

<p>"<em>Sh!</em> I'm afraid people&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let's go out on the porch," said Noble, whose manner had suddenly
become desperate. "Let's go out and get some air where we can
talk this thing over."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'd better not just now," she returned, glancing
over her shoulder. "You see, all the people aren't here yet."</p>

<p>"You've got an aunt here," said Noble, "and a sister-in-law and
a little niece: I saw 'em. They can&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'd better stay indoors just now," she said persuasively.
"We can talk here just as well."</p>

<p>"We can't!" he insisted feverishly. "We can't, Julia! I've got
something to say, Julia. Julia, you gave me the first dance and
the last dance, and of course sitting together at supper, or whatever
there is, and you know as well as I do that means it's just the
same as if you weren't giving this party but it was somewhere
else and I took you to it, and it's always understood you <em>never</em>
dance more with anybody else than the one you went with, when
you go with that person to a place, because that's the rights
of it; and other towns it's just the same way; they do that way
there, just the same as here; they do that way everywhere, because
nobody else has got a right to cut in and dance more with you
than the one you go with, when you goes to a place with that one.
Julia, don't you see that's the regular way it is, and the only
fair way it ought to be?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Weren't you even <em>listening</em>?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Julia," he said desperately, "let's go out on the porch. I want
to explain just the way I feel. Let's go out on the porch, Julia.
If we stay here, somebody's just bound to interrupt us any minute
before I can explain the way I&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the prophecy was fulfilled even before it was concluded.
A group of loudly chattering girls and their escorts of the moment
bore down upon Julia, and shattered the tête-à-tête. Dislodged
from Julia's side by a large and eager girl, whom he had hated
ever since she was six years old and he five, Noble found himself
staggering in a kind of suburb; for the large girl's disregard
of him, as she shouldered in, was actually physical, and too powerful
for him to resist. She wished to put her coarse arm round Julia's
waist, it appeared, and the whole group burbled and clamoured:
the party was <em>perfictly</em> glorious; so was the waxed floor;
so was Julia, my <em>dear</em>, so was the music, the weather,
and the din they made!</p>

<p>Noble felt that his rights were being outraged. Until the next
dance began, every moment of her time was legally his&mdash;yet all
he could even see of her was the top of her head. And the minutes
were flying.</p>

<p>He stood on tiptoe, thrust his head forward over the large girl's
odious shoulder, and shouted: "Julia! Let's go out on the porch!"</p>

<p>No one seemed to hear him.</p>

<p>"Julia&#11834;"</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em> Rackety-<em>Boom</em>! The drummer walloped his
drums; a saxophone squawked, and fiddles squealed. Hereupon appeared
a tall authoritative man, at least thirty-two years old, and all
swelled up with himself, as interpreted by Noble and several other
friends of Julia's&mdash;though this, according to quite a number of
people (all feminine) was only another way of saying that he was
a person of commanding presence. He wore a fully developed moustache,
an easy smile, clothes offensively knowing; and his hair began
to show that scarcity which Julia felt gave him distinction&mdash;a
curious theory, but natural to her age. What really did give this
Clairdyce some air of distinction, however, was the calmness with
which he walked through the group that had dislodged Noble Dill,
and the assurance with which he put his arm about Julia and swept
her away in the dance.</p>

<p>Noble was left alone in the middle of the floor, but not for
long. Couples charged him, and he betook himself to the wall.
The party, for him, was already ruined.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as he stood against the wall, there would be swirled
to him, out of all the comminglements of other scents, a faint,
faint hint of heliotrope and then Julia would be borne masterfully
by, her flying skirts just touching him. And sometimes, out of
the medley of all other sounds, there would reach his ear a little
laugh like a run of lightly plucked harp strings, and he would
see her shining dark hair above her partner's shoulder as they
swept again near him for an instant. And always, though she herself
might be concealed from him, he could only too painfully mark
where she danced: the overtopping head of the tall Clairdyce was
never lost to view. The face on the front part of that disliked
head wore continuously a confident smile, which had a bad effect
on Noble. It seemed to him desecration that a man with so gross
a smile should be allowed to dance with Julia. And that she should
smile back at her partner, and with such terrible kindness&mdash;as
Noble twice saw her smile&mdash;this was like a calamity happening
to her white soul without her knowing it. If she should ever marry
that man&mdash;well, it would be the old story: May and December! Noble
shuddered, and the drums, the fiddles, the bass fiddle, and the
saxophone seemed to have an evil sound.</p>

<p>When the music stopped he caromed hastily through the room toward
Julia, but she was in a thicket of her guests when he arrived,
and for several moments Mr. Clairdyce's broad back kept intervening&mdash;almost
intentionally, it seemed. When Noble tried to place himself in
a position to attract Julia's attention, this back moved, too,
and Noble's nose but pressed black cloth. And the noise everybody
made was so baffling that, in order to be heard, Julia herself
was shouting. Finally Noble contrived to squirm round the obtrusive
back, and protruded his strained face among all the flushed and
laughing ones.</p>

<p>"Julia, I got to&#11834;" he began.</p>

<p>But this was just at the climax of a story that three people
were telling at the same time, Julia being one of them, and he
received little attention.</p>

<p>"Julia," he said hoarsely; "I got something I want to <em>tell</em>
you about&#11834;"</p>

<p>He raised his voice: "Julia, come on! Let's go out on the <em>porch</em>!"</p>

<p>Nobody even knew that he was there. Nevertheless, the tall and
solid Clairdyce was conscious of him, but only, it proved, as
one is conscious of something to rest upon. His elbow, a little
elevated, was at the height of Noble's shoulder, and this heavy
elbow, without its owner's direct or active cognizance, found
for itself a comfortable support. Then, as the story reached its
conclusion, this old Clairdyce joined the general mirth so heartily
as to find himself quite overcome, and he allowed most of his
weight to depend upon the supported elbow. Noble sank like feathers.</p>

<p>"Here! What you doin'?" he said hotly. "I'll thank you to keep
off o' me!"</p>

<p>Old Baldy recovered his balance without being aware what had
threatened it, while his elbow, apparently of its own volition,
groped for its former pedestal. Noble evaded it, and pushed forward.</p>

<p>"Julia," he said. "I <em>got</em> to say some&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the accursed music began again, and horn-rimmed Newland Sanders
already had his arm about her waist. They disappeared into the
ruck of dancers.</p>

<p>"Well, by George!" said Noble. "By George, I'm goin' to <em>do</em>
something!"</p>
