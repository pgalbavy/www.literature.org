<p>The morning came perfectly blue, with a freshness in the air and a
blue luminousness over the trees and the distant mountains, and
birds so bright, absolutely like new-opened buds sparking in the
air.</p>

<p>Cipriano was returning to Guadalajara in the automobile, and
Carlota was going with him.  Kate would be rowed home on the lake.</p>

<p>To Ram&oacute;n, Carlota was still, at times, a torture.  She seemed to
have the power still to lacerate him, inside his bowels.  Not in
his mind or spirit, but in his old emotional, passional self: right
in the middle of his belly, to tear him and make him feel he bled
inwardly.</p>

<p>Because he had loved her, he had cared for her: for the affectionate,
passionate, whimsical, sometimes elfish creature she had been.  He
had made much of her, and spoiled her, for many years.</p>

<p>But all the while, gradually, his nature was changing inside him.
Not that he ceased to care for her, or wanted other women.  That
she could have understood.  But inside him was a slow, blind
imperative, urging him to cast his emotional and spiritual and
mental self into the slow furnace, and smelt them into a new, whole
being.</p>

<p>But he had Carlota to reckon with.  She loved him, and that, to
her, was the outstanding factor.  She loved him, emotionally.  And
spiritually, she loved mankind.  And mentally, she was sure she was
quite right.</p>

<p>Yet, as time went on, he had to change.  He had to cast that
emotional self, which she loved, into the furnace, to be smelted
down to another self.</p>

<p>And she felt she was robbed, cheated.  Why couldn't he go on being
gentle, good, and loving, and trying to make the whole world more
gentle, good, and loving?</p>

<p>He couldn't, because it was borne in upon him that the world had
gone as far as it could go in the good, gentle, and loving
direction, and anything farther in that line meant perversity.  So
the time had come for the slow, great change to something else - 
what, he didn't know.</p>

<p>The emotion of love, and the greater emotion of liberty for mankind
seemed to go hard and congeal upon him, like the shell on a
chrysalis.  It was the old caterpillar stage of Christianity
evolving into something else.</p>

<p>But Carlota felt this was all she had, this emotion of love, for
her husband, her children, for her people, for the animals and
birds and trees of the world.  It was her all, her Christ, and her
Blessed Virgin.  How could she let it go?</p>

<p>So she continued to love him, and to love the world, steadily,
pathetically, obstinately, and devilishly.  She prayed for him, and
she engaged in works of charity.</p>

<p>But her love had turned from being the spontaneous flow, subject to
the unforeseen comings and goings of the Holy Ghost, and had turned
into will.  She loved now with her WILL: as the white world now
tends to do.  She became filled with charity: that cruel kindness.'</p>

<p>Her winsomeness and her elfishness departed from her, she began to
wither, she grew tense.  And she blamed him, and prayed for him.
Even as the spontaneous mystery died in her, the will hardened,
till she was nothing but a will: a lost will.</p>

<p>She soon succeeded in drawing the life of her young boys all to
herself, with her pathos and her subtle will.  Ram&oacute;n was too proud
and angry to fight for them.  They were her children.  Let her have
them.</p>

<p>They were the children of his old body.  His new body had no
children: would probably never have any.</p>

<p>'But remember,' he said to her, with southern logic, 'you do not
love, save with your will.  I don't like the love you have for your
god: it is an assertion of your own will.  I don't like the love
you have for me: it is the same.  I don't like the love you have
for your children.  If ever I see in them a spark of desire to be
saved from it, I shall do my best to save them.  Meanwhile have
your love, have your will.  But you know I dislike it.  I dislike
your insistence.  I dislike your monopoly of one feeling, I dislike
your charity works.  I disapprove of the whole trend of your life.
You are weakening and vitiating the boys.  You do NOT love them,
you are only putting your love will over them.  One day they will
turn and hate you for it.  Remember I have said this to you.'</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Carlota had trembled in every fibre of her body, under the
shock of this.  But she went away to the chapel of the Annunciation
Convent, and prayed.  And, praying for his soul, she seemed to gain
a victory over him, in the odour of sanctity.  She came home in
frail, pure triumph, like a flower that blooms on a grave: his
grave.</p>

<p>And Ram&oacute;n henceforth watched her in her beautiful, rather
fluttering, rather irritating gentleness, as he watched his closest
enemy.</p>

<p>Life had done its work on one more human being, quenched the
spontaneous life and left only the will.  Killed the god in the
woman, or the goddess, and left only charity, with a will.</p>

<p>'Carlota,' he had said to her, 'how happy you would be if you could
wear deep, deep mourning for me. - I shall not give you this
happiness.'</p>

<p>She gave him a strange look from her hazel-brown eyes.</p>

<p>'Even that is in the hands of God,' she had replied, as she hurried
away from him.</p>

<p>And now, on this morning after the first rains, she came to the
door of his room as he was sitting writing.  As yesterday, he was
naked to the waist, the blue-marked sash tied round his middle
confined the white linen, loose trousers - like big, wide pyjama
trousers crossed in front and tied round his waist.</p>

<p>'May I come in?' she said nervously.</p>

<p>'Do!' he replied, putting down his pen and rising.</p>

<p>There was only one chair - he was offering it her, but she sat down
on the unmade bed, as if asserting her natural right.  And in the
same way she glanced at his naked breast - as if asserting her
natural right.</p>

<p>'I am going with Cipriano after breakfast,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes, so you said.'</p>

<p>'The boys will be home in three weeks.'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Don't you want to see them?'</p>

<p>'If they want to see me.'</p>

<p>'I am sure they do.'</p>

<p>'Then bring them here.'</p>

<p>'Do you think it is pleasant for me?' she said, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>'You do not make it pleasant for me, Carlota.'</p>

<p>'How can I?  You know I think you are wrong.  When I listened to
you last night - there is something so beautiful in it all - and yet
so monstrous.  So MONSTROUS! - Oh!  I think to myself:  What is this
man doing?  This man of all men, who might be such a blessing to
his country and mankind - '</p>

<p>'Well,' said Ram&oacute;n.  'And what is he instead?'</p>

<p>'You know!  You know!  I can't bear it. - It ISN'T for you to save
Mexico, Ram&oacute;n.  Christ has already saved it.'</p>

<p>'It seems to me not so.'</p>

<p>'He has!  He has!  And He made you the wonderful being that you
are, so that you should WORK OUT the salvation, in the name of
Christ and of love.  Instead of which - '</p>

<p>'Instead of which, Carlota, I try something else. - But believe me,
if the real Christ has not been able to save Mexico - and He hasn't - 
then I am sure the white Anti-Christ of charity, and socialism,
and politics, and reform, will only succeed in finally destroying
her.  That, and that alone, makes me take my stand. - You, Carlota,
with your charity works and your PITY: and men like Benito Juarez,
with their Reform and their Liberty: and the rest of the benevolent
people, politicians and socialists and so forth, surcharged with
pity for living men, in their mouths, but really with hate - the
hate of the materialist HAVE-NOTS for the materialist HAVES: they
are the Anti-Christ.  The old world, that's just the world.  But
the new world, that wants to save the People, this is the Anti-
Christ.  This is Christ with real poison in the communion cup. - And
for this reason I step out of my ordinary privacy and individuality.
I don't want everybody poisoned.  About the great mass I don't care.
But I don't want everybody poisoned.'</p>

<p>'How can you be so sure that you yourself are not a poisoner of the
people? - I think you are.'</p>

<p>'Think it then.  I think of you, Carlota, merely that you have not
been able to come to your complete, final womanhood: which is a
different thing from the old womanhoods.'</p>

<p>'Womanhood is always the same.'</p>

<p>'Ah, no, it isn't!  Neither is manhood.'</p>

<p>'But what do you think you can do?  What do you think this
Quetzalcoatl nonsense amounts to?'</p>

<p>'Quetzalcoatl is just a living word, for these people, no more.
All I want them to do is to find the beginnings of the way to their
own manhood, their own womanhood.  Men are not yet men in full, and
women are not yet women.  They are all half and half, incoherent,
part horrible, part pathetic, part good creatures.  Half arrived. - 
I mean you as well, Carlota.  I mean all the world. - But these
people don't assert any righteousness of their own, these Mexican
people of ours.  That makes me think that grace is still with them.
And so, having got hold of some kind of clue to my own whole
manhood, it is part of me now to try with them.'</p>

<p>'You will fail.'</p>

<p>'I shan't.  Whatever happens to me, there will be a new vibration,
a new call in the air, and a new answer inside some men.'</p>

<p>'They will betray you. - Do you know what even your friend Toussaint
said of you? - Ram&oacute;n Carrasco's future is just the past of mankind.'</p>

<p>'A great deal of it is the past.  Naturally Toussaint sees that
part.'</p>

<p>'But the boys don't believe in you.  Instinctively, they
disbelieve.  Cyprian said to me, when I went to see him:  &quot;Is
father doing any more of that silly talk about old gods coming
back, mother?  I wish he wouldn't.  It would be pretty nasty for us
if he got himself into the newspapers with it.'&quot;</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n laughed.</p>

<p>'Little boys,' he said, 'are like little gramophones.  They only
talk according to the record that's put into them.'</p>

<p>'YOU don't believe out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,' said
Carlota bitterly.</p>

<p>'Why, Carlota, the babes and sucklings don't get much chance.
Their mothers and their teachers turn them into little gramophones
from the first, so what can they do, but say and feel according to
the record the mother and teacher puts into them?  Perhaps in the
time of Christ babes and sucklings were not so perfectly exploited
by their elders.'</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the smile went off his face.  He rose up, and
pointed to the door.</p>

<p>'Go away,' he said in a low tone.  'Go away!  I have smelt the
smell of your spirit long enough.'</p>

<p>She sat on the bed, spell-bound, gazing at him with frightened, yet
obstinate, insolent eyes, wincing from his outstretched arm as if
he had threatened to strike her.</p>

<p>Then again the fire went out of his eyes, and his arm sank.  The
still, far-away look came on his face.</p>

<p>'What have I to do with it!' he murmured softly.</p>

<p>And taking up his blouse and his hat, he went silently out on to
the terrace, departing from her in body and in soul.  She heard the
soft swish of his sandals.  She heard the faint resonance of the
iron door to the terrace, to which he alone had access.  And she
sat like a heap of ash on his bed, ashes to ashes, burnt out, with
only the coals of her will still smouldering.</p>

<p>Her eyes were very bright, as she went to join Kate and Cipriano.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Kate was rowed home down the lake.  She felt a
curious depression at leaving the hacienda: as if, for her, life
now was there, and not anywhere else.</p>

<p>Her own house seemed empty, banal, vulgar.  For the first time in
her life, she felt the banality and emptiness even of her own
milieu.  Though the Casa de las Cuentas was not purely her own
milieu.</p>

<p>'Ah, Ni&ntilde;a, how good!  How good that you have come!  Ay, in the
night, how much water!  Much!  Much!  But you were safe in the
hacienda, Ni&ntilde;a.  Ah, how nice, that hacienda of Jamiltepec.  Such a
good man, Don Ram&oacute;n - isn't he, Ni&ntilde;a?  He cares a great deal for his
people.  And the Se&ntilde;ora, ah, how sympathetic she is!'</p>

<p>Kate smiled and was pleasant.  But she felt more like going into
her room and saying:  For God's sake, leave me alone, with your
cheap rattle.</p>

<p>She suffered again from the servants.  Again that quiet,
subterranean insolence against life, which seems to belong to
modern life.  The unbearable note of flippant jeering, which is
underneath almost all modern utterance.  It was underneath Juana's
constant cry. - Ni&ntilde;a!  Ni&ntilde;a!</p>

<p>At meal-times Juana would seat herself on the ground at a little
distance from Kate, and talk, talk in her rapid mouthfuls of
conglomerate words with trailing, wistful endings: and all the time
watch her mistress with those black, unseeing eyes on which the
spark of light would stir with the peculiar slow, malevolent
jeering of the Indian.</p>

<p>Kate was not rich - she had only her moderate income.</p>

<p>'Ah, the rich people - !' Juana would say.</p>

<p>'I am not rich,' said Kate.</p>

<p>'You are not rich, Ni&ntilde;a?' came the singing, caressive bird-like
voice:  'Then, you are poor?' - this was indescribable irony.</p>

<p>'No, I am not poor either.  I am not rich, and I am not poor,' said
Kate.</p>

<p>'You are not rich, and you are not poor, Ni&ntilde;a!' repeated Juana, in
her bird-like voice, that covered the real bird's endless,
vindictive jeering.</p>

<p>For the words meant nothing to her.  To her, who had nothing, COULD
never have anything, Kate was one of that weird class, the rich.
And, Kate felt, in Mexico it was a crime to be rich, or to be
classed with the rich.  Not even a crime, really, so much as a
freak.  The rich class was a freak class, like dogs with two heads
or calves with five legs.  To be looked upon, not with envy, but
with the slow, undying antagonism and curiosity which 'normals'
have towards 'freaks.'  The slow, powerful, corrosive Indian
mockery, issuing from the lava-rock Indian nature, against anything
which strives to be above the grey, lava-rock level.</p>

<p>'Is it true, Ni&ntilde;a, that your country is through there?' Juana
asked, jabbing her finger downward, towards the bowels of the
earth.</p>

<p>'Not quite!' said Kate.  'My country is more there - ' and she
slanted her finger at the earth's surface.</p>

<p>'Ah - that way!' said Juana.  And she looked at Kate with a subtle
leer, as if to say: what could you expect from people who came out
of the earth sideways, like sprouts of camote!</p>

<p>'And is it true that over there, there are people with only one
eye - here!'  Juana punched herself in the middle of her forehead.</p>

<p>'No.  That isn't true.  That is just a story.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Juana.  'Isn't it true!  Do you know?  Have you been to
the country where they are, these people?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Kate.  'I have been to all the countries, and there are
no such people.'</p>

<p>'Verdad!  Verdad!' breathed Juana awestruck.  'You have been to all
the countries, and there are no such people! - But in your country,
they are all gringos?  Nothing but gringos?'</p>

<p>She meant, no real people and salt of the earth like her own
Mexican self.</p>

<p>'They are all people like me,' said Kate coldly.</p>

<p>'Like you, Ni&ntilde;a?  And they all talk like you?'</p>

<p>'Yes!  Like me.'</p>

<p>'And there are many?'</p>

<p>'Many!  Many!'</p>

<p>'Look now!' breathed Juana, almost awestruck to think that there
could be whole worlds of these freak, mockable people.</p>

<p>And Concha, that young, belching savage, would stare through her
window-grating at the strange menagerie of the Ni&ntilde;a and the Ni&ntilde;a's
white visitors.  Concha, slapping tortillas, was real.</p>

<p>Kate walked down towards the kitchen.  Concha was slapping the
masa, the maize dough which she bought in the plaza at eight
centavos a kilo.</p>

<p>'Ni&ntilde;a!' she called in her raucous voice.  'Do you eat tortillas?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes,' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Eh?' shouted the young savage.</p>

<p>'Sometimes.'</p>

<p>'Here!  Eat one now!'  And Concha thrust a brown paw with a pinkish
palm, and a dingy-looking tortilla, at Kate.</p>

<p>'Not now,' said Kate.</p>

<p>She disliked the heavy plasters that tasted of lime.</p>

<p>'Don't you want it?  Don't you eat it?' said Concha, with an
impudent, strident laugh.  And she flung the rejected tortilla on
the little pile.</p>

<p>She was one of those who won't eat bread: say they don't like it,
that it is not food.</p>

<p>Kate would sit and rock on her terrace, while the sun poured in the
green square of the garden, the palm-tree spread its great fans
translucent at the light, the hibiscus dangled great double-red
flowers, rosy red, from its very dark tree, and the dark green
oranges looked as if they were sweating as they grew.</p>

<p>Came lunch time, madly hot: and greasy hot soup, greasy rice,
splintery little fried fishes, bits of boiled meat and boiled egg-
plant vegetables, a big basket piled with mangoes, papayas,
zapotes - all the tropical fruits one did not want, in hot weather.</p>

<p>And the barefoot little Maria, in a limp, torn, faded red frock, to
wait at table.  She was the loving one.  She would stand by Juana
as Juana bubbled with talk, like dark bubbles in her mouth, and she
would stealthily touch Kate's white arm; stealthily touch her
again.  Not being rebuked, she would stealthily lay her thin little
black arm on Kate's shoulder, with the softest, lightest touch
imaginable, and her strange, wide black eyes would gleam with
ghostly black beatitude, very curious, and her childish, pock-
marked, slightly imbecile face would take on a black, arch,
beatitudinous look.  Then Kate would quickly remove the thin, dark,
pock-marked arm, the child would withdraw half a yard, the
beatitudinous look foiled, but her very black eyes still shining
exposed and absorbedly, in a rapt, reptilian sort of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Till Concha came to hit her with her elbow, making some brutal,
savage remark which Kate could not understand.  So the glozing
black eyes of the child would twitch, and Maria would break into
meaningless tears, Concha into a loud, brutal, mocking laugh, like
some violent bird.  And Juana interrupted her black and gluey flow
of words to glance at her daughters and throw out some ineffectual
remark.</p>

<p>The victim, the inevitable victim, and the inevitable victimizer.</p>

<p>The terrible, terrible hot emptiness of the Mexican mornings, the
weight of black ennui that hung in the air!  It made Kate feel as
if the bottom had fallen out of her soul.  She went out to the
lake, to escape that house, that family.</p>

<p>Since the rains, the trees in the broken gardens of the lake front
had flamed into scarlet, and poured themselves out into lavender
flowers.  Rose red, scarlet and lavender, quick, tropical flowers.
Wonderful splashes of colour.  But that was all: splashes!  They
made a splash, like fireworks.</p>

<p>And Kate thought of the blackthorn puffing white, in the early
year, in Ireland, and hawthorn with coral grains, in a damp still
morning in the lanes, and foxgloves by the bare rock, and tufts of
ling and heather, and a ravel of harebells.  And a terrible,
terrible longing for home came over her.  To escape from these
tropical brilliancies and meaninglessnesses.</p>

<p>In Mexico, the wind was a hard draught, the rain was a sluice of
water, to be avoided, and the sun hit down on one with hostility,
terrific and stunning.  Stiff, dry, unreal land, with sunshine
beating on it like metal.  Or blackness and lightning and crashing
violence of rain.</p>

<p>No lovely fusion, no communion.  No beautiful mingling of sun and
mist, no softness in the air, never.  Either hard heat or hard
chill.  Hard, straight lies and zigzags, wounding the breast.  No
soft, sweet smell of earth.  The smell of Mexico, however subtle,
suggested violence and things in chemical conflict.</p>

<p>And Kate felt herself filled with an anger of resentment.  She
would sit under a willow-tree by the lake, reading a P&iacute;o Baroja
novel that was angry and full of No! No! No! - ich bin der Geist der
stets verneint!  But she herself was so much angrier and fuller of
repudiation than P&iacute;o Baroja.  Spain cannot stand for No! as Mexico
can.</p>

<p>The tree hung fleecy above her.  She sat on the warm sand in the
shadow, careful not to let even her ankles lie in the biting shine
of the sun.  There was a faint, old smell of urine.  The lake was
so still and filmy as to be almost invisible.  In the near
distance, some dark women were kneeling on the edge of the lake,
dressed only in their long wet chemises in which they had bathed.
Some were washing garments, some were pouring water over
themselves, scooping it up in gourd scoops and pouring it over
their black heads and ruddy-dark shoulders, in the intense pressure
of the sunshine.  On her left were two big trees, and a cane fence,
and little straw huts of Indians.  There the beach itself ended,
and the little Indian plots of land went down to the lake-front.</p>

<p>Glancing around in the great light, she seemed to be sitting
isolated in a dark core of shadow, while the world moved in
inconsequential specks through the hollow glare.  She noticed a
dark urchin, nearly naked, marching with naked, manly solemnity
down to the water's edge.  He would be about four years old,
but more manly than an adult man.  With sex comes a certain
vulnerability which these round-faced, black-headed, stiff-backed
infant men have not got.  Kate knew the urchin.  She knew his
tattered rag of a red shirt, and the weird rags that were his
little man's white trousers.  She knew his black round head, his
stiff, sturdy march of a walk, his round eyes, and his swift,
scuttling run, like a bolting animal.</p>

<p>'What's the brat got?' she said to herself, gazing at the moving
little figure within the great light.</p>

<p>Dangling from his tiny outstretched arm, held by the webbed toe,
head down and feebly flapping its out-sinking wings, was a bird, a
water-fowl.  It was a black mud-chick with a white bar across the
under-wing, one of the many dark fowl that bobbed in little flocks
along the edge of the sun-stunned lake.</p>

<p>The urchin marched stiffly down to the water's edge, holding the
upside-down bird, that seemed big as an eagle in the tiny fist.
Another brat came scuttling after.  The two infant men paddled a
yard into the warm, lapping water, under the great light, and
gravely stooping, like old men, set the fowl on the water.  It
floated, but could hardly paddle.  The lift of the ripples moved
it.  The urchins dragged it in, like a rag, by a string tied to its
leg.</p>

<p>So quiet, so still, so dark, like tiny, chubby little infant men,
the two solemn figures with the rag of a bird!</p>

<p>Kate turned uneasily to her book, her nerves on edge.  She heard
the splash of a stone.  The bird was on the water, but apparently
the string that held it by the leg was tied to a stone.  It lay
wavering, a couple of yards out.  And the two little he-men, with
sober steadfastness and a quiet, dark lust, were picking up stones,
and throwing them with the fierce Indian aim at the feebly
fluttering bird: right down upon it.  Like a little warrior stood
the mite in the red rag, his arm upraised, to throw the stone with
all his might down on the tethered bird.</p>

<p>In a whiff, Kate was darting down the beach.</p>

<p>'Ugly boys!  Ugly children!  Go!  Go away, ugly children, ugly
boys!' she said on one breath, with quiet intensity.</p>

<p>The round-headed dot gave her one black glance from his manly eyes,
then the two of them scuttled up the beach into invisibility.</p>

<p>Kate went into the water, and lifted the wet, warm bird.  The bit
of coarse fibre-string hung from its limp, greenish, waterfowl's
ankle.  It feebly tried to bite her.</p>

<p>She rapidly stepped out of the water and stood in the sun to
unfasten the string.  The bird was about as big as a pigeon.  It
lay in her hand with the absolute motionlessness of a caught wild
thing.</p>

<p>Kate stooped and pulled off her shoes and stockings.  She looked
round.  No sign of life from the reed huts dark in the shadow of
the trees.  She lifted her skirts and staggered out barefoot in the
hot shallows of the water, almost falling on the cruel stones under
the water.  The lake-side was very shallow.  She staggered on and
on, in agony, holding up her skirts in one hand, holding the warm,
wet, motionless bird in the other.  Till at last she was up to her
knees.  Then she launched the greeny-black bird, and gave it a
little push to the uprearing expanse of filmy water, that was
almost dim, invisible with the glare of light.</p>

<p>It lay wet and draggled on the pale, moving sperm of the water,
like a buoyant rag.</p>

<p>'Swim then!  Swim!' she said, trying to urge it away into the lake.</p>

<p>Either it couldn't or wouldn't.  Anyhow it didn't.</p>

<p>But it was out of reach of those urchins.  Kate struggled back from
those stones, to her tree, to her shade, to her book, away from the
rage of the sun.  Silent with slow anger, she kept glancing up at
the floating bird, and sideways at the reed huts of the Indians in
the black shadow.</p>

<p>Yes, the bird was dipping its beak in the water, and shaking its
head.  It was coming to itself.  But it did not paddle.  It let
itself be lifted, lifted on the ripples, and the ripples would
drift it ashore.</p>

<p>'Fool of a thing!' said Kate nervously, using all her consciousness
to make it paddle away into the lake.</p>

<p>Two companions, two black dots with white specks of faces, were
coming out of the pale glare of the lake.  Two mud-chicks swam
busily forward.  The first swam up and poked its beak at the inert
bird, as if to say Hello!  What's up?  Then immediately it turned
away and paddled in complete oblivion to the shore, its companion
following.</p>

<p>Kate watched the rag of feathered misery anxiously.  Would it not
rouse itself? wouldn't it follow?</p>

<p>No!  There it lay, slowly, inertly drifting on the ripples, only
sometimes shaking its head.</p>

<p>The other two alert birds waded confidently, busily among the
stones.</p>

<p>Kate read a bit more.</p>

<p>When she looked again, she could not see her bird.  But the other
two were walking among the stones, jauntily.</p>

<p>She read a bit more.</p>

<p>The next thing was a rather loutish youth of eighteen or so, in
overall trousers, running with big strides towards the water, and
the stiff little man-brat scuttling after with determined bare
feet.  Her heart stood still.</p>

<p>The two busy mud-chicks rose in flight and went low over the water
into the blare of light.  Gone!</p>

<p>But the lout in the big hat and overall trousers and those stiff
Indian shoulders she sometimes hated so much was peering among the
stones.  She, however, was sure her bird had gone.</p>

<p>No!  Actually no!  The stiff-shoulder lout stooped and picked up
the damp thing.  It had let itself drift back.</p>

<p>He turned, dangling it like a rag from the end of one wing, and
handed it to the man-brat.  Then he stalked self-satisfied up the
shore.</p>

<p>Ugh! and that moment how Kate hated these people: their terrible
lowness, &agrave; terre, &agrave; terre.  Their stiff broad American shoulders,
and high chests, and above all, their walk, their prancing,
insentient walk.  As if some motor-engine drove them at the bottom
of their back.</p>

<p>Stooping rather forward and looking at the ground so that he could
turn his eyes sideways to her, without showing her his face, the
lout returned to the shadow of the huts.  And after him,
diminutive, the dot of a man marched stiffly, hurriedly, dangling
the wretched bird, that stirred very feebly, downwards from the tip
of one wing.  And from time to time turning his round, black-eyed
face in Kate's direction, vindictively, apprehensively, lest she
should swoop down on him again.  Black, apprehensive male defiance
of the great, white weird female.</p>

<p>Kate glared back from under her tree.</p>

<p>'If looks would kill you, brat, I'd kill you,' she said.  And the
urchin turned his face like clockwork at her from time to time, as
he strutted palpitating towards the gap in the cane hedge, into
which the youth had disappeared.</p>

<p>Kate debated whether to rescue the foolish bird again.  But what
was the good!</p>

<p>This country would have its victim.  America would have its victim.
As long as time lasts, it will be the continent divided between
Victims and Victimizers.  What is the good of trying to interfere!</p>

<p>She rose up in detestation of the flabby bird, and of the sulky-
faced brat turning his full moon on her in apprehension.</p>

<p>Lumps of women were by the water's edge.  Westwards, down the
glare, rose the broken-looking villas and the white twin towers of
the church, holding up its two fingers in mockery above the scarlet
flame-trees and the dark mangoes.  She saw the rather lousy shore,
and smelt the smell of Mexico come out in the hot sun after the
rains: excrement, human and animal dried in the sun on a dry, dry
earth; and dry leaves; and mango leaves; and pure air with a little
refuse-smoke in it.</p>

<p>'But the day will come when I shall go away,' she said to herself.</p>

<p>And sitting rocking once more on her veranda, hearing the clap-clap
of tortillas from the far end of the patio, the odd, metallic
noises of birds, and feeling the clouds already assembling in the
west, with a weight of unborn thunder upon them, she felt she could
bear it no more: the vacuity, and the pressure: the horrible
uncreate elementality, so uncouth, even sun and rain uncouth,
uncouth.</p>

<p>And she wondered over the black vision in the eyes of that urchin.
The curious void.</p>

<p>He could not see that the bird was a real living creature with a
life of its own.  This, his race had never seen.  With black eyes
they stared out on an elemental world, where the elements were
monstrous and cruel, as the sun was monstrous, and the cold,
crushing black water of the rain was monstrous, and the dry, dry,
cruel earth.</p>

<p>And among the monstrosity of the elements flickered and towered
other presences: terrible uncouth things called gringos, white
people, and dressed up monsters of rich people, with powers like
gods, but uncouth, demonish gods.  And uncouth things like birds
that could fly and snakes that could crawl and fish that could swim
and bite.  An uncouth, monstrous universe of monsters big and
little, in which man held his own by sheer resistance and
guardedness, never, never going forth from his own darkness.</p>

<p>And sometimes, it was good to have revenge on the monsters that
fluttered and strode.  The monsters big and the monsters little.
Even the monster of that bird, which had its own monstrous bird-
nature.  On this the mite could wreck the long human vengeance, and
for once be master.</p>

<p>Blind to the creature as a soft, struggling thing finding its own
fluttering way through life.  Seeing only another monster of the
outer void.</p>

<p>Walking forever through a menace of monsters, blind to the sympathy
in things, holding one's own, and not giving in, nor going forth.
Hence the lifted chests and the prancing walk.  Hence the stiff,
insentient spines, the rich physique, and the heavy, dreary
natures, heavy like the dark-grey mud-bricks, with a terrible
obstinate ponderosity and a dry sort of gloom.</p>
