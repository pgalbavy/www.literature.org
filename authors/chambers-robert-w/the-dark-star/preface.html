<p>
Where are you going,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
Through the still noon&mdash;<br/>
Where are you going?<br/>
To hear the thunder of the sea<br/>
And the wind blowing!--<br/>
To find a stormy moon to comfort me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the dune!</p>

<p>
Why are you weeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
Through the still noon&mdash;<br/>
Why are you weeping?<br/>
Because I found no wind, no sea,<br/>
No white surf leaping,<br/>
Nor any flying moon to comfort me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the dune.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>
What did you see there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
In the still noon&mdash;<br/>
What did you see there?<br/>
Only the parched world drowsed in drought,<br/>
And a fat bee, there,<br/>
Prying and probing at a poppy's mouth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That drooped a-swoon.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>
What did you hear there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
In the still noon&mdash;<br/>
What did you hear there?<br/>
Only a kestrel's lonely cry<br/>
From the wood near there-<br/>
A rustle in the wheat as I passed by-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A cricket's rune.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>
Who led you homeward,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
Through the still noon&mdash;<br/>
Who led you homeward?<br/>
My soul within me sought the sea,<br/>
Leading me foam-ward:<br/>
But the lost moon's ghost returned with me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the high noon.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Where is your soul then,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naïa?<br/>
Lost at high noon&mdash;<br/>
Where is your soul then?<br/>
It wanders East&mdash;or West  &mdash;I think-<br/>
Or near the Pole, then-<br/>
Or died&mdash;perhaps there on the dune's dry brink<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking the moon.</p>

<p><em>THE DARK STAR</em></p>

<p>"The dying star grew dark; the last light faded from it; went
out. Prince Erlik laughed.</p>

<p>"And suddenly the old order of things began to pass away more
swiftly.</p>

<p>"Between earth and outer space&mdash;between Creator and created,
confusing and confounding their identities,&mdash;a rushing darkness
grew&mdash;the hurrying wrack of immemorial storms heralding whirlwinds
through which Truth alone survives.</p>

<p>"Awaiting the inevitable reëstablishment of such temporary conventions
as render the incident of human existence possible, the brooding
Demon which men call Truth stares steadily at Tengri under the
high stars which are passing too, and which at last shall pass
away and leave the Demon watching all alone amid the ruins of
eternity."</p>
<p>&mdash; The Prophet of the Kiot Bordjiguen</p>
</div>
<p><em>PREFACE</em></p>

<p><em>CHILDREN OF THE STAR</em></p>

<p>Not the dark companion of Sirius, brightest of all stars&mdash;not
our own chill and spectral planet rushing toward Vega in the constellation
of Lyra&mdash;presided at the birth of millions born to corroborate
a bloody horoscope.</p>

<p>But a Dark Star, speeding unseen through space, known to the
ancients, by them called Erlik, after the Prince of Darkness,
ruled at the birth of those myriad souls destined to be engulfed
in the earthquake of the ages, or flung by it out of the ordered
pathway of their lives into strange byways, stranger highways&mdash;into
deeps and deserts never dreamed of.</p>

<p>Also one of the dozen odd temporary stars on record blazed up
on that day, flared for a month or two, dwindled to a cinder,
and went out.</p>

<p>But the Dark Star Erlik, terribly immortal, sped on through space
to complete a two-hundred-thousand-year circuit of the heavens,
and begin anew an immemorial journey by the will of the Most High.</p>

<p>What spectroscope is to horoscope, destiny is to chance. The
black star Erlik rushed through interstellar darkness unseen;
those born under its violent augury squalled in their cradles,
or, thumb in mouth, slumbered the dreamless slumber of the newly
born.</p>

<p>One of these, a tiny girl baby, fussed and fidgeted in her mother's
arms, tortured by prickly heat when the hot winds blew through
Trebizond.</p>

<p>Overhead vultures circled; a <em>stein-adler</em>, cleaving the
blue, looked down where the surf made a thin white line along
the coast, then set his lofty course for China.</p>

<p>Thousands of miles to the westward, a little boy of eight gazed
out across the ruffled waters of the mill pond at Neeland's Mills,
and wondered whether the ocean might not look that way.</p>

<p>And, wondering, with the salt sea effervescence working in his
inland-born body, he fitted a cork to his fishing line and flung
the baited hook far out across the ripples. Then he seated himself
on the parapet of the stone bridge and waited for monsters of
the deep to come.</p>

<p>And again, off Seraglio Point, men were rowing in a boat; and
a corded sack lay in the stern, horridly and limply heavy.</p>

<p>There was also a box lying in the boat, oddly bound and clamped
with metal which glistened like silver under the Eastern stars
when the waves of the Bosporus dashed high, and the flying scud
rained down on box and sack and the red-capped rowers.</p>

<p>In Petrograd a little girl of twelve was learning to eat other
things than sour milk and cheese; learning to ride otherwise than
like a demon on a Cossack saddle; learning deportment, too, and
languages, and social graces and the fine arts. And, most thoroughly
of all, the little girl was learning how deathless should be her
hatred for the Turkish Empire and all its works; and how only
less perfect than our Lord in Paradise was the Czar on his throne
amid that earthly paradise known as "All the Russias."</p>

<p>Her little brother was learning these things, too, in the Corps
of Officers. Also he was already proficient on the balalaika.</p>

<p>And again, in the mountains of a conquered province, the little
daughter of a gamekeeper to nobility was preparing to emigrate
with her father to a new home in the Western world, where she
would learn to perform miracles with rifle and revolver, and where
the beauty of the hermit thrush's song would startle her into
comparing it to the beauty of her own untried voice. But to her
father, and to her, the most beautiful thing in all the world
was love of Fatherland.</p>

<p>Over these, and millions of others, brooded the spell of the
Dark Star. Even the world itself lay under it, vaguely uneasy,
sometimes startled to momentary seismic panic. Then, ere mundane
self-control restored terrestrial equilibrium, a few mountains
exploded, an island or two lay shattered by earthquake, boiling
mud and pumice blotted out one city; earth-shock and fire another;
a tidal wave a third.</p>

<p>But the world settled down and balanced itself once more on the
edge of the perpetual abyss into which it must fall some day;
the invisible shadow of the Dark Star swept it at intervals when
some far and nameless sun blazed out unseen; days dawned; the
sun of the solar system rose furtively each day and hung around
the heavens until that dusky huntress, Night, chased him once
more beyond the earth's horizon.</p>

<p>The shadow of the Dark Star was always there, though none saw
it in sunshine or in moonlight, or in the silvery lustre of the
planets.</p>

<p>A boy, born under it, stood outside the fringe of willow and
alder, through which moved two English setters followed and controlled
by the boy's father.</p>

<p>"Mark!" called the father.</p>

<p>Out of the willows like a feathered bomb burst a big grouse,
and the green foliage that barred its flight seemed to explode
as the strong bird sheered out into the sunshine.</p>

<p>The boy's gun, slanting upward at thirty degrees, glittered in
the sun an instant, then the left barrel spoke; and the grouse,
as though struck by lightning in mid-air, stopped with a jerk,
then slanted swiftly and struck the ground.</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried the boy, as a setter appeared, leading on straight
to the heavy mass of feathers lying on the pasture grass.</p>

<p>"Clean work, Jim," said his father, strolling out of the willows.
"But wasn't it a bit risky, considering the little girl yonder?"</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed the boy, very red. "I never even saw her.
I'm ashamed."</p>

<p>They stood looking across the pasture, where a little girl in
a pink gingham dress lingered watching them, evidently lured by
her curiosity from the old house at the crossroads just beyond.</p>

<p>Jim Neeland, still red with mortification, took the big cock-grouse
from the dog which brought it&mdash;a tender-mouthed, beautifully trained
Belton, who stood with his feathered offering in his jaws, very
serious, very proud, awaiting praise from the Neelands, father
and son.</p>

<p>Neeland senior "drew" the bird and distributed the sacrifice
impartially between both dogs&mdash;it being the custom of the country.</p>

<p>Neeland junior broke his gun, replaced the exploded shell, content
indeed with his one hundred per cent performance.</p>

<p>"Better run over and speak to the little girl, Jim," suggested
old Dick Neeland, as he motioned the dogs into covert again.</p>

<p>So Jim ran lightly across the stony, clover-set ground to where
the little girl roamed along the old snake fence, picking berries
sometimes, sometimes watching the sportsmen out of shy, golden-grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"Little girl," he said, "I'm afraid the shot from my gun came
rattling rather close to you that time. You'll have to be careful.
I've noticed you here before. It won't do; you'll have to keep
out of range of those bushes, because when we're inside we can't
see exactly where we're firing."</p>

<p>The child said nothing. She looked up at the boy, smiled shyly,
then, with much composure, began her retreat, not neglecting any
tempting blackberry on the way.</p>

<p>The sun hung low over the hazy Gayfield hills; the beeches and
oaks of Mohawk County burned brown and crimson; silver birches
supported their delicate canopies of burnt gold; and imperial
white pines clothed hill and vale in a stately robe of green.</p>

<p>Jim Neeland forgot the child&mdash;or remembered her only to exercise
caution in the Brookhollow covert.</p>

<p>The little girl Ruhannah, who had once fidgeted with prickly
heat in her mother's arms outside the walls of Trebizond, did
not forget this easily smiling, tall young fellow&mdash;a grown man
to her&mdash;who had come across the pasture lot to warn her.</p>

<p>But it was many a day before they met again, though these two
also had been born under the invisible shadow of the Dark Star.
But the shadow of Erlik is always passing like swift lightning
across the Phantom Planet which has fled the other way since Time
was born.</p>

<p><em>Allahou Ekber, O Tchinguiz Khagan!</em></p>

<p>A native Mongol missionary said to Ruhannah's father:</p>

<p>"As the chronicles of the Eighurs have it, long ago there fell
metal from the Black Racer of the skies; the first dagger was
made of it; and the first image of the Prince of Darkness. These
pass from Kurd to Cossack by theft, by gift, by loss; they pass
from nation to nation by accident, which is Divine design.</p>

<p>"And where they remain, war is. And lasts until image and dagger
are carried to another land where war shall be. But where there
is war, only the predestined suffer&mdash;those born under Erlik&mdash;children
of the Dark Star."</p>

<p>"I thought," said the Reverend Wilbour Carew, "that my brother
had confessed Christ."</p>

<p>"I am but repeating to you what my father believed; and Temujin
before him," replied the native convert, his remote gaze lost
in reflection.</p>

<p>His eyes were quite little and coloured like a lion's; and sometimes,
in deep reverie, the corners of his upper lip twitched.</p>

<p>This happened when Ruhannah lay fretting in her mother's arms,
and the hot wind blew on Trebizond.</p>

<p>Under the Dark Star, too, a boy grew up in Minetta Lane, not
less combative than other ragged boys about him, but he was inclined
to arrange and superintend fist fights rather than to participate
in battle, except with his wits.</p>

<p>His name was Eddie Brandes; his first fortune of three dollars
was amassed at craps; he became a hanger-on in ward politics,
at race-tracks, stable, club, squared ring, vaudeville, burlesque.
Long Acre attracted him&mdash;but always the gambling end of the operation.</p>

<p>Which predilection, with its years of ups and downs, landed him
one day in Western Canada with an "Unknown" to match against an
Athabasca blacksmith, and a training camp as the prospect for
the next six weeks.</p>

<p>There lived there, gradually dying, one Albrecht Dumont, lately
head gamekeeper to nobility in the mountains of a Lost Province,
and wearing the Iron Cross of 1870 on the ruins of a gigantic
and bony chest, now as hollow as a Gothic ruin.</p>

<p>And if, like a thousand fellow patriots, he had been ordered
to the Western World to watch and report to his Government the
trend and tendency of that Western, English-speaking world, only
his Government and his daughter knew it&mdash;a child of the Dark Star
now grown to early womanhood, with a voice like a hermit thrush
and the skill of a sorceress with anything that sped a bullet.</p>

<p>Before the Unknown was quite ready to meet the Athabasca blacksmith,
Albrecht Dumont, dying faster now, signed his last report to the
Government at Berlin, which his daughter Ilse had written for
him&mdash;something about Canadian canals and stupid Yankees and their
greed, indifference, cowardice, and sloth.</p>

<p>Dumont's mind wandered:</p>

<p>"After the well-born Herr Gott relieves me at my post," he whispered,
"do thou pick up my burden and stand guard, little Ilse."</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Thy sacred promise?"</p>

<p>"My promise."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The next day Dumont felt better than he had felt for a year.</p>

<p>"Ilse, who is the short and broadly constructed American who
comes now already every day to see thee and to hear thee sing?"</p>

<p>"His name is Eddie Brandes."</p>

<p>"He is of the fight <em>gesellschaft</em>, not?"</p>

<p>"He should gain much money by the fight. A theatre in Chicago
may he willingly control, in which light opera shall be given."</p>

<p>"Is it for that he hears so willingly thy voice?"</p>

<p>"It is for that.... And love."</p>

<p>"And what of Herr Max Venem, who has asked of me thy little hand
in marriage?"</p>

<p>The girl was silent.</p>

<p>"Thou dost not love him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Toward sunset, Dumont, lying by the window, opened his eyes of
a dying <em>Lämmergeier</em>:</p>

<p>"My Ilse."</p>

<p>"Father?"</p>

<p>"What has thou to this man said?"</p>

<p>"That I will be engaged to him if thou approve."</p>

<p>"He has gained the fight?"</p>

<p>"Today.... And many thousand dollars. The theatre in Chicago
is his when he desires. Riches, leisure, opportunity to study
for a career upon his stage, are mine if I desire."</p>

<p>"Dost thou desire this, little Ilse?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the man Venem who has followed thee so long?"</p>

<p>"I cannot be what he would have me&mdash;a <em>Hausfrau</em>&mdash;to mend
his linen for my board and lodging."</p>

<p>"And the Fatherland which placed me here on outpost?"</p>

<p>"I take thy place when God relieves thee."</p>

<p>"<em>So ist's recht!... Grüs Gott</em> &mdash;Ilse&#11834;"</p>

<p>Among the German settlers a five-piece brass band had been organised
the year before.</p>

<p>It marched at the funeral of Albrecht Dumont, lately head gamekeeper
to nobility in the mountains of a long-lost province.</p>

<p>Three months later Ilse Dumont arrived in Chicago to marry Eddie
Brandes. One Benjamin Stull was best man. Others present included
"Captain" Quint, "Doc" Curfoot, "Parson" Smawley, Abe Gordon&mdash;friends
of the bridegroom.</p>

<p>Invited by the bride, among others were Theodor Weishelm, the
Hon. Charles Wilson, M. P., and Herr Johann Kestner, a wealthy
gentleman from Leipsic seeking safe and promising investments
in Canada and the United States.</p>

<p>A year later Ilse Dumont Brandes, assuming the stage name of
Minna Minti, sang the rôle of <em>Bettina</em> in "The Mascotte,"
at the Brandes Theatre in Chicago.</p>

<p>A year later, when she created the part of <em>Kathi</em> in
"The White Horse," Max Venem sent word to her that she would live
to see her husband lying in the gutter under his heel. Which made
the girl unhappy in her triumph.</p>

<p>But Venem hunted up Abe Grittlefeld and told him very coolly
that he meant to ruin Brandes.</p>

<p>And within a month the latest public favourite, Minna Minti,
sat in her dressing-room, wet-eyed, enraged, with the reports
of Venem's private detectives locked in the drawer of her dressing
table, and the curtain waiting.</p>

<p>So complex was life already becoming to these few among the million
children of the Dark Star Erlik&mdash;to everyone, from the child that
fretted in its mother's arms under the hot wind near Trebizond,
to a deposed Sultan, cowering behind the ivory screen in his zenana,
weeping tears that rolled like oil over his fat jowl to which
still adhered the powdered sugar of a Turkish sweetmeat.</p>

<p>Allahou Ekber, <em>Khodja</em>; God is great. Great also, <em>Ande</em>,
is Ali, the Fourth Caliph, cousin-companion of Mahomet the Prophet.
But, <em>O tougtchi</em>, be thy name Niaz and thy surname Baï,
for Prince Erlik speeds on his Dark Star, and beneath the end
of the argument between those two last survivors of a burnt-out
world&mdash;behold! The sword!</p>
