<p>D'Alcacer, after receiving his warning, stepped back and leaned
against the edge of the table. He could not ignore in himself
a certain emotion. And indeed, when he had asked Mrs. Travers
for a sign he expected to be moved&mdash;but he had not expected the
sign to come so soon. He expected this night to pass like other
nights, in broken slumbers, bodily discomfort, and the unrest
of disconnected thinking. At the same time he was surprised at
his own emotion. He had flattered himself on the possession of
more philosophy. He thought that this famous sense of self-preservation
was a queer thing, a purely animal thing. "For, as a thinking
man," he reflected, "I really ought not to care." It was probably
the unusual that affected him. Clearly. If he had been lying seriously
ill in a room in a hotel and had overheard some ominous whispers
he would not have cared in the least. Ah, but then he would have
been ill&mdash;and in illness one grows so indifferent. Illness is
a great help to unemotional behaviour, which of course is the
correct behaviour for a man of the world. He almost regretted
he was not very ill. But, then, Mr. Travers was obviously ill
and it did not seem to help him much. D'Alcacer glanced at the
bedstead where Mr. Travers preserved an immobility which struck
d'Alcacer as obviously affected. He mistrusted it. Generally he
mistrusted Mr. Travers. One couldn't tell what he would do next.
Not that he could do much one way or another, but that somehow
he threatened to rob the situation of whatever dignity it may
have had as a stroke of fate, as a call on courage. Mr. d'Alcacer,
acutely observant and alert for the slightest hints, preferred
to look upon himself as the victim not of a swindle but of a rough
man naively engaged in a contest with heaven's injustice. D'Alcacer
did not examine his heart, but some lines of a French poet came
into his mind, to the effect that in all times those who fought
with an unjust heaven had possessed the secret admiration and
love of men. He didn't go so far as love but he could not deny
to himself that his feeling toward Lingard was secretly friendly
and&mdash;well, appreciative. Mr. Travers sat up suddenly. What a horrible
nuisance, thought d'Alcacer, fixing his eyes on the tips of his
shoes with the hope that perhaps the other would lie down again.
Mr. Travers spoke.</p>

<p>"Still up, d'Alcacer?"</p>

<p>"I assure you it isn't late. It's dark at six, we dined before
seven, that makes the night long and I am not a very good sleeper;
that is, I cannot go to sleep till late in the night."</p>

<p>"I envy you," said Mr. Travers, speaking with a sort of drowsy
apathy. "I am always dropping off and the awakenings are horrible."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer, raising his eyes, noticed that Mrs. Travers and Lingard
had vanished from the light. They had gone to the rail where d'Alcacer
could not see them. Some pity mingled with his vexation at Mr.
Travers' snatchy wakefulness. There was something weird about
the man, he reflected. "Jorgenson," he began aloud.</p>

<p>"What's that?" snapped Mr. Travers.</p>

<p>"It's the name of that lanky old store-keeper who is always about
the decks."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him. I don't see anybody. I don't know anybody.
I prefer not to notice."</p>

<p>"I was only going to say that he gave me a pack of cards; would
you like a game of piquet?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I could keep my eyes open," said Mr. Travers in
an unexpectedly confidential tone. "Isn't it funny, d'Alcacer?
And then I wake up. It's too awful."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer made no remark and Mr. Travers seemed not to have expected
any.</p>

<p>"When I said my wife was mad," he began, suddenly, causing d'Alcacer
to start, "I didn't mean it literally, of course." His tone sounded
slightly dogmatic and he didn't seem to be aware of any interval
during which he had appeared to sleep. D'Alcacer was convinced
more than ever that he had been shamming, and resigned himself
wearily to listen, folding his arms across his chest. "What I
meant, really," continued Mr. Travers, "was that she is the victim
of a craze. Society is subject to crazes, as you know very well.
They are not reprehensible in themselves, but the worst of my
wife is that her crazes are never like those of the people with
whom she naturally associates. They generally run counter to them.
This peculiarity has given me some anxiety, you understand, in
the position we occupy. People will begin to say that she is eccentric.
Do you see her anywhere, d'Alcacer?"</p>

<p>D'Alcacer was thankful to be able to say that he didn't see Mrs.
Travers. He didn't even hear any murmurs, though he had no doubt
that everybody on board the Emma was wide awake by now. But Mr.
Travers inspired him with invincible mistrust and he thought it
prudent to add:</p>

<p>"You forget that your wife has a room in the deckhouse."</p>

<p>This was as far as he would go, for he knew very well that she
was not in the deckhouse. Mr. Travers, completely convinced by
the statement, made no sound. But neither did he lie down again.
D'Alcacer gave himself up to meditation. The night seemed extremely
oppressive. At Lingard's shout for Jorgenson, that in the profound
silence struck his ears ominously, he raised his eyes and saw
Mrs. Travers outside the door of the Cage. He started forward
but she was already within. He saw she was moved. She seemed out
of breath and as if unable to speak at first.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better shut the door?" suggested d'Alcacer.</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard's coming in," she whispered to him. "He has
made up his mind."</p>

<p>"That's an excellent thing," commented d'Alcacer, quietly. "I
conclude from this that we shall hear something."</p>

<p>"You shall hear it all from me," breathed out Mrs. Travers.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed d'Alcacer very low.</p>

<p>By that time Lingard had entered, too, and the decks of the Emma
were all astir with moving figures. Jorgenson's voice was also
heard giving directions. For nearly a minute the four persons
within the Cage remained motionless. A shadowy Malay in the gangway
said suddenly: "Sudah, Tuan," and Lingard murmured, "Ready, Mrs.
Travers."</p>

<p>She seized d'Alcacer's arm and led him to the side of the Cage
furthest from the corner in which Mr. Travers' bed was placed,
while Lingard busied himself in pricking up the wick of the Cage
lantern as if it had suddenly occurred to him that this, whatever
happened, should not be a deed of darkness. Mr. Travers did nothing
but turn his head to look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"One moment," said d'Alcacer, in a low tone and smiling at Mrs.
Travers' agitation. "Before you tell me anything let me ask you:
'Have <em>you</em> made up your mind?'" He saw with much surprise
a widening of her eyes. Was it indignation? A pause as of suspicion
fell between those two people. Then d'Alcacer said apologetically:
"Perhaps I ought not to have asked that question," and Lingard
caught Mrs. Travers' words, "Oh, I am not afraid to answer that
question."</p>

<p>Then their voices sank. Lingard hung the lamp up again and stood
idle in the revived light; but almost immediately he heard d'Alcacer
calling him discreetly.</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard!"</p>

<p>He moved toward them at once. At the same instant Mr. Travers'
head pivoted away from the group to its frontal position.</p>

<p>D'Alcacer, very serious, spoke in a familiar undertone.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Travers tells me that we must be delivered up to those
Moors on shore."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is nothing else for it," said Lingard.</p>

<p>"I confess I am a bit startled," said d'Alcacer; but except for
a slightly hurried utterance nobody could have guessed at anything
resembling emotion.</p>

<p>"I have a right to my good name," said Lingard, also very calm,
while Mrs. Travers near him, with half-veiled eyes, listened impassive
like a presiding genius.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't question that for a moment," conceded d'Alcacer.
"A point of honour is not to be discussed. But there is such a
thing as humanity, too. To be delivered up helplessly. . . ."</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" interrupted Lingard. "But you needn't feel hopeless.
I am not at liberty to give up my life for your own. Mrs. Travers
knows why. That, too, is engaged."</p>

<p>"Always on your honour?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. A promise is a promise."</p>

<p>"Nobody can be held to the impossible," remarked d'Alcacer.</p>

<p>"Impossible! What is impossible? I don't know it. I am not a
man to talk of the impossible or dodge behind it. I did not bring
you here."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer lowered his head for a moment. "I have finished," he
said, gravely. "That much I had to say. I hope you don't think
I have appeared unduly anxious."</p>

<p>"It's the best policy, too." Mrs. Travers made herself heard
suddenly. Nothing of her moved but her lips, she did not even
raise her eyes. "It's the only possible policy. You believe me,
Mr. d'Alcacer? . . ." He made an almost imperceptible movement
of the head. . . . "Well, then, I put all my hope in you, Mr.
d'Alcacer, to get this over as easily as possible and save us
all from some odious scene. You think perhaps that it is I who
ought to. . . ."</p>

<p>"No, no! I don't think so," interrupted d'Alcacer. "It would
be impossible."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would," she admitted, nervously.</p>

<p>D'Alcacer made a gesture as if to beg her to say no more and
at once crossed over to Mr. Travers' side of the Cage. He did
not want to give himself time to think about his task. Mr. Travers
was sitting up on the camp bedstead with a light cotton sheet
over his legs. He stared at nothing, and on approaching him d'Alcacer
disregarded the slight sinking of his own heart at this aspect
which seemed to be that of extreme terror. "This is awful," he
thought. The man kept as still as a hare in its form.</p>

<p>The impressed d'Alcacer had to make an effort to bring himself
to tap him lightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"The moment has come, Travers, to show some fortitude," he said
with easy intimacy. Mr. Travers looked up swiftly. "I have just
been talking to your wife. She had a communication from Captain
Lingard for us both. It remains for us now to preserve as much
as possible our dignity. I hope that if necessary we will both
know how to die."</p>

<p>In a moment of profound stillness, d'Alcacer had time to wonder
whether his face was as stony in expression as the one upturned
to him. But suddenly a smile appeared on it, which was certainly
the last thing d'Alcacer expected to see. An indubitable smile.
A slightly contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"My wife has been stuffing your head with some more of her nonsense." 
Mr. Travers spoke in a voice which astonished d'Alcacer as much
as the smile, a voice that was not irritable nor peevish, but
had a distinct note of indulgence. "My dear d'Alcacer, that craze
has got such a hold of her that she would tell you any sort of
tale. Social impostors, mediums, fortune-tellers, charlatans of
all sorts do obtain a strange influence over women. You have seen
that sort of thing yourself. I had a talk with her before dinner.
The influence that bandit has got over her is incredible. I really
believe the fellow is half crazy himself. They often are, you
know. I gave up arguing with her. Now, what is it you have got
to tell me? But I warn you that I am not going to take it seriously."</p>

<p>He rejected briskly the cotton sheet, put his feet to the ground
and buttoned his jacket. D'Alcacer, as he talked, became aware
by the slight noise behind him that Mrs. Travers and Lingard were
leaving the Cage, but he went on to the end and then waited anxiously
for the answer.</p>

<p>"See! She has followed him out on deck," were Mr. Travers' first
words. "I hope you understand that it is a mere craze. You can't
help seeing that. Look at her costume. She simply has lost her
head. Luckily the world needn't know. But suppose that something
similar had happened at home. It would have been extremely awkward.
Oh! yes, I will come. I will go anywhere. I can't stand this hulk,
those people, this infernal Cage. I believe I should fall ill
if I were to remain here."</p>

<p>The inward detached voice of Jorgenson made itself heard near
the gangway saying: "The boat has been waiting for this hour past,
King Tom."</p>

<p>"Let us make a virtue of necessity and go with a good grace,"
said d'Alcacer, ready to take Mr. Travers under the arm persuasively,
for he did not know what to make of that gentleman.</p>

<p>But Mr. Travers seemed another man. "I am afraid, d'Alcacer,
that you, too, are not very strong-minded. I am going to take
a blanket off this bedstead. . . ." He flung it hastily over his
arm and followed d'Alcacer closely. "What I suffer mostly from,
strange to say, is cold."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers and Lingard were waiting near the gangway. To everybody's
extreme surprise Mr. Travers addressed his wife first.</p>

<p>"You were always laughing at people's crazes," was what he said,
"and now you have a craze of your own. But we won't discuss that."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer passed on, raising his cap to Mrs. Travers, and went
down the ship's side into the boat. Jorgenson had vanished in
his own manner like an exorcised ghost, and Lingard, stepping
back, left husband and wife face to face.</p>

<p>"Did you think I was going to make a fuss?" asked Mr. Travers
in a very low voice. "I assure you I would rather go than stay
here. You didn't think that? You have lost all sense of reality,
of probability. I was just thinking this evening that I would
rather be anywhere than here looking on at you. At your folly.
. . ."</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers' loud, "Martin!" made Lingard wince, caused d'Alcacer
to lift his head down there in the boat, and even Jorgenson, forward
somewhere out of sight, ceased mumbling in his moustache. The
only person who seemed not to have heard that exclamation was
Mr. Travers himself, who continued smoothly:</p>

<p>". . . at the aberration of your mind, you who seemed so superior
to common credulities. You are not yourself, not at all, and some
day you will admit to me that . . . No, the best thing will be
to forget it, as you will soon see yourself. We shall never mention
that subject in the future. I am certain you will be only too
glad to agree with me on that point."</p>

<p>"How far ahead are you looking?" asked Mrs. Travers, finding
her voice and even the very tone in which she would have addressed
him had they been about to part in the hall of their town house.
She might have been asking him at what time he expected to be
home, while a footman held the door open and the brougham waited
in the street.</p>

<p>"Not very far. This can't last much longer." Mr. Travers made
a movement as if to leave her exactly as though he were rather
pressed to keep an appointment. "By the by," he said, checking
himself, "I suppose the fellow understands thoroughly that we
are wealthy. He could hardly doubt that."</p>

<p>"It's the last thought that would enter his head," said Mrs.
Travers.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, just so," Mr. Travers allowed a little impatience to
pierce under his casual manner. "But I don't mind telling you
that I have had enough of this. I am prepared to make&mdash;ah!&mdash;to
make concessions. A large pecuniary sacrifice. Only the whole
position is so absurd! He might conceivably doubt my good faith.
Wouldn't it be just as well if you, with your particular influence,
would hint to him that with me he would have nothing to fear?
I am a man of my word."</p>

<p>"That is the first thing he would naturally think of any man,"
said Mrs. Travers.</p>

<p>"Will your eyes never be opened?" Mr. Travers began, irritably,
then gave it up. "Well, so much the better then. I give you a
free hand."</p>

<p>"What made you change your attitude like this?" asked Mrs. Travers,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"My regard for you," he answered without hesitation.</p>

<p>"I intended to join you in your captivity. I was just trying
to persuade him. . . ."</p>

<p>"I forbid you absolutely," whispered Mr. Travers, forcibly. "I
am glad to get away. I don't want to see you again till your craze
is over."</p>

<p>She was confounded by his secret vehemence. But instantly succeeding
his fierce whisper came a short, inane society laugh and a much
louder, "Not that I attach any importance . . ."</p>

<p>He sprang away, as it were, from his wife, and as he went over
the gangway waved his hand to her amiably.</p>

<p>Lighted dimly by the lantern on the roof of the deckhouse Mrs.
Travers remained very still with lowered head and an aspect of
profound meditation. It lasted but an instant before she moved
off and brushing against Lingard passed on with downcast eyes
to her deck cabin. Lingard heard the door shut. He waited awhile,
made a movement toward the gangway but checked himself and followed
Mrs. Travers into her cabin.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark in there. He could see absolutely nothing and
was oppressed by the profound stillness unstirred even by the
sound of breathing.</p>

<p>"I am going on shore," he began, breaking the black and deathlike
silence enclosing him and the invisible woman. "I wanted to say
good-bye."</p>

<p>"You are going on shore," repeated Mrs. Travers. Her voice was
emotionless, blank, unringing.</p>

<p>"Yes, for a few hours, or for life," Lingard said in measured
tones. "I may have to die with them or to die maybe for others.
For you, if I only knew how to manage it, I would want to live.
I am telling you this because it is dark. If there had been a
light in here I wouldn't have come in."</p>

<p>"I wish you had not," uttered the same unringing woman's voice.
"You are always coming to me with those lives and those deaths
in your hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's too much for you," was Lingard's undertoned comment.
"You could be no other than true. And you are innocent! Don't
wish me life, but wish me luck, for you are innocent&mdash;and you
will have to take your chance."</p>

<p>"All luck to you, King Tom," he heard her say in the darkness
in which he seemed now to perceive the gleam of her hair. "I will
take my chance. And try not to come near me again for I am weary
of you."</p>

<p>"I can well believe it," murmured Lingard, and stepped out of
the cabin, shutting the door after him gently. For half a minute,
perhaps, the stillness continued, and then suddenly the chair
fell over in the darkness. Next moment Mrs. Travers' head appeared
in the light of the lamp left on the roof of the deckhouse. Her
bare arms grasped the door posts.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," she said, loudly, into the shadows of the deck.
She heard no footsteps, saw nothing moving except the vanishing
white shape of the late Captain H. C. Jorgenson, who was indifferent
to the life of men. "Wait, King Tom!" she insisted, raising her
voice; then, "I didn't mean it. Don't believe me!" she cried,
recklessly.</p>

<p>For the second time that night a woman's voice startled the hearts
of men on board the Emma. All except the heart of old Jorgenson.
The Malays in the boat looked up from their thwarts. D'Alcacer,
sitting in the stern sheets beside Lingard, felt a sinking of
his heart.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he exclaimed. "I heard your name on deck. You
are wanted, I think."</p>

<p>"Shove off," ordered Lingard, inflexibly, without even looking
at d'Alcacer. Mr. Travers was the only one who didn't seem to
be aware of anything. A long time after the boat left the Emma's
side he leaned toward d'Alcacer.</p>

<p>"I have a most extraordinary feeling," he said in a cautious
undertone. "I seem to be in the air &mdash;I don't know. Are we
on the water, d'Alcacer? Are you quite sure? But of course, we
are on the water."</p>

<p>"Yes," said d'Alcacer, in the same tone. "Crossing the Styx&mdash;perhaps." 
He heard Mr. Travers utter an unmoved "Very likely," which he
did not expect. Lingard, his hand on the tiller, sat like a man
of stone.</p>

<p>"Then your point of view has changed," whispered d'Alcacer.</p>

<p>"I told my wife to make an offer," went on the earnest whisper
of the other man. "A sum of money. But to tell you the truth I
don't believe very much in its success."</p>

<p>D'Alcacer made no answer and only wondered whether he didn't
like better Mr. Travers' other, unreasonable mood. There was no
denying the fact that Mr. Travers was a troubling person. Now
he suddenly gripped d'Alcacer's fore-arm and added under his breath:
"I doubt everything. I doubt whether the offer will ever be made."</p>

<p>All this was not very impressive. There was something pitiful
in it: whisper, grip, shudder, as of a child frightened in the
dark. But the emotion was deep. Once more that evening, but this
time aroused by the husband's distress, d'Alcacer's wonder approached
the borders of awe.</p>
