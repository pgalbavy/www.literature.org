<p>The weather remained enchanting. The tropical heat was tempered
by the ocean breeze, which stole among the palms, and across the
island, and where the crew, and those who had lived there so long,
lounged in the shadow, or sauntered in the sunshine, when the
orb sank low in the western sky.</p>

<p>It was curious that now, after the coming of the proa, when no
other help was needed, the signal at the masthead, as it may be
called, seemed to have acquired an unusual potency; for, on two
separate occasions during the afternoon, the island was approached
by vessels, who were given to understand that the parties on shore
were provided for. Mate Storms, now the captain, very much doubted
whether he did a wise thing in declining this proffered assistance,
but the main reason for doing so was the fact that the pearls
were still buried, and he knew of no way of getting them without
discovery.</p>

<p>One of the ships was a Dutch one, from Java, and the other was
British, bound for Ceylon&mdash;neither very desirable, as they would
have compelled a long, roundabout voyage home. But Storms would
have accepted the offer of one on account of his distrust of the
young man, Fred Sanders, but for the reason given.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen, after the "setting back" given him by Storms,
became quiet and tractable, and stayed almost entirely with Inez,
for whom he showed the greatest affection. Since she was tenderly
attached to him, and sympathized in his affliction, this kept
the two together almost continually&mdash;an arrangement which it was
plain to see was not agreeable to Fred Sanders, though he was
too courteous to make any mention of it.</p>

<p>During the afternoon such goods as were deemed necessary were
transferred to the proa, which lay at anchor in the lagoon. These
were not very numerous or valuable, and consisted mostly of garments
which Storms had manufactured for Inez.</p>

<p>When night came, after a meal had been eaten on shore close to
where the proa lay, it was arranged that Sanders should sleep
on board with his crew&mdash;if two men might be termed such&mdash;while
the others should stay in their cabin, as was their wont.</p>

<p>Storms contrived this on the plea that his companion, the captain,
would be more tractable. His real purpose was to gain a chance
to secure the pearls unnoticed. The young man made not the slightest
objection to the plan, for he had too good sense to do so; nor
did his silence in that respect lull the suspicions of Storms
himself.</p>

<p>"I wish there was not such a bright moon," said the mate to himself,
not far from midnight, "for I need all the quiet and darkness
I can get; and I don't see any use of waiting longer," he added.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen had been sleeping quietly for several hours, while
the silence in the apartment of Inez showed that she, too, was
wrapped in slumber, and possibly dreaming of far-away scenes,
of which her memory was so misty and indistinct.</p>

<p>As to those upon the proa, everything must necessarily be conjecture;
but, in the middle of the night, with his senses on the alert,
and his imagination excited, Abe Storms conjured up all sorts
of fancies and suspicions. There were many times when he believed
that these men, including the boyish leader, were the worst kind
of pirates, who were only waiting the chance to secure the pearls,
when they would either desert or treacherously slay them. But,
since meditation and idleness could avail nothing, he rose from
his couch upon the floor, and, making sure that his loaded revolver
was in place, he stole out from among the palm trees, and began
moving in the direction of the spot where his treasures lay hid.</p>

<p>He did this with the utmost precaution, glancing in every direction
at each step, frequently pausing and changing the course he was
pursuing, and, in short, doing everything he could think of to
prevent detection. The full moon rode high in an almost unclouded
sky, and the air was as charming as that of Italy. The solemn
roar of the ocean and the irregular boom of the long, immense
swells breaking against the shore and sending the thin sheets
of foam sliding swiftly up the bank, were the only sounds that
greeted his ears.</p>

<p>"That is wonderful!" exclaimed the searcher, for all at once
he descried a ship, under full sail, seemingly within two hundred
yards of shore. "If these parties hadn't arrived to-day this craft
wouldn't have come within a score of miles of us."</p>

<p>The ship looked like a vast bird, when with all sail set and
her black hull careening to one side under the wind, she drove
the foaming water away from her bows, and sped forward as if pursuing
or fleeing from some enemy.</p>

<p>Whether the watch saw the signal of distress in the moonlight,
cannot be known, but the vessel speedily passed on, and vanished
in the night, while Mate Storms, recalling his thoughts, and seeing
no one near him, moved directly to where he had deposited his
riches such a long time before, and to which he only made an occasional
visit.</p>

<p>He had advanced too far to retreat, whether he was seen or not,
and he stooped down and began digging with his hands and sheath-knife.
It was only a short distance, when he struck something, and a
moment after drew up a small, strong canvas bag. Soon came another,
and then a smaller one, which contained the wonderful pearl that
belonged to Inez Hawthorne. They were all there, and had not been
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Now, it only remains to keep these in my possession," was his
thought, as he straightened up and started to return. "I would
give half of them if they were at home and safe in the bank &mdash;Hello!"</p>

<p>Perhaps the vision of the sailor was unusually keen just then,
for when he paused with a start he caught sight of a shadowy figure,
which seemed to glide, without any effort of its own, over the
sand, and immediately disappeared among the palm trees. There
was something so peculiar in its movements that Abe was chilled
with awe as he stood still and watched it for the few seconds
it remained in view. But there could be no doubt of its identity.
It was Fred Sanders, who had been on the watch, and who must have
seen the mate dig up the treasures, and knew they were now in
his possession.</p>

<p>Storms was in anything but a comfortable frame of mind while
walking thoughtfully back to the cabin, which he entered.</p>

<p>"What more likely than that he will steal up here in the night,
believing I am asleep, and try to shoot me? Well, if he does so,
he shall find me prepared for him, anyway."</p>

<p>The first proceeding of the mate was to deposit the pearls contained
in the three diminutive canvas sacks in a small valise, which
he had carefully preserved all through the years, and which now
held a few necessities that he meant to take away with him. The
addition of these precious contents taxed the receptacle to its
fullest capacity, but, after all, this was the best thing to do,
and he believed he would be able to keep it under his eye during
the comparatively short time they would be on the voyage to Wauparmur
Island.</p>

<p>It may be said, indeed, that there was nothing else to be done,
which rendered it unfortunate that he could not secure a few hours'
sleep before venturing away in the proa. But the nerves of the
mate were too unstrung by his position to feel easy, and he placed
himself by the opening of the cabin, with his hand upon the weapon,
prepared to watch until daylight.</p>

<p>As might have been supposed, in spite of his uneasiness, he gradually
became drowsy, and it was not long before his head sank on his
breast, and he, too, was asleep. It was well he did so, for he
gained the rest so necessary, and as it was, he might have slept
longer had he not been awakened by outside causes.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen slept on, but Inez was on her feet at an early
hour, and seeing that Storms was unconscious, she passed out without
disturbing him, and made her way to the spring, where she always
performed her morning ablutions.</p>

<p>It was natural that the mate, going to sleep as he did, with
his mind filled with the most dismal of fancies, should find his
slumbers visited by horrible phantasies. He was struggling with
the figure of a man, who had the face of Fred Sanders, and they
were bearing each other over an immense cliff, when his opponent
got the upper hand, and, holding him suspended for the moment,
began to laugh at his calamity. The laugh grew louder, until it
awoke the startled sleeper, who, opening wide his eyes, saw the
veritable figure of Fred Sanders before him, laughing as heartily
as he had been doing in the struggle in sleep.</p>

<p>"Mercy! where's the valise?" gasped the bewildered Storms, clutching
at the receptacle which lay at his side. "I thought you had stolen
it&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then the quick-witted sailor recalled his situation, and
he, too, broke into mirth, in which there was not much heartiness.</p>

<p>"What a curious dream I had, Sanders! I really believe I have
been asleep!"</p>

<p>"And what is strange about that, since a full night has passed
since we last met? I hope you have had a good rest, even though
your awaking was not so pleasant."</p>

<p>Abe Storms was excessively chagrined, for his very action, when
aroused so unexpectedly, would, of itself, have turned suspicion
to the satchel, which he snatched up like a startled miser. This
action, united with what Captain Bergen had said, and with what
the young man himself had witnessed the preceding night, could
not have failed to tell him that that rusty-looking valise&mdash;about
which the owner was so careful&mdash;contained a great amount of wealth
in some form.</p>

<p>But what of it?</p>

<p>This was the question Storms put to himself as he sprang up and
called to Inez&mdash;who immediately appeared&mdash;and began the preparation
for the last meal they expected to eat upon the detested island.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen was quiet and thoughtful, but the others were
in high spirits.</p>

<p>The two natives made their meal on board the proa, where they
stolidly awaited the coming of the passengers, the "baggage" having
been transferred the day before. And the sun was no more than
fairly above the horizon when the proa started on her eventful
voyage to Wauparmur Island&mdash;a voyage destined to be marked by
events of which no one on board dreamed.</p>
