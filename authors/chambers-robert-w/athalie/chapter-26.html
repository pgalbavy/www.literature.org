<p>Athalie was having a wonderful summer. House and garden continued
to enchant her. She brought down Hafiz, who, being a city cat,
instantly fled indoors with every symptom of astonishment and
terror the first time Athalie placed him on the lawn.</p>

<p>But within a week the dainty Angora had undergone a change of
heart. Boldly, now he marched into the garden all by himself;
fearlessly he pounced upon such dangerous game as crickets and
grasshoppers and the little night moths which drifted among the
flowers at twilight,&mdash;the favourite prowling hour of Hafiz, the
Beautiful.</p>

<p>Also, early in July, Athalie had acquired a fat bay horse and
a double buckboard; and, in the seventh heaven now, she jogged
about the country through leafy lanes and thistle-bordered by-roads
long familiar to her childhood, sometimes with basket, trowel,
and garden gloves, intent on the digging and transplanting of
ferns, sometimes with field-glasses and books, on ornithological
information bent. More often she started out with only a bag of
feed for Henry the horse and some luncheon for herself, to picnic
all alone in a familiar woodland, haunted by childish memories,
and lie there listening to the bees and to the midsummer wind
in softly modulated conversation with the little tree-top leaves.</p>

<p>She had brought her maid from the city; Mrs. Connor continued
to rule laundry and kitchen. Connor himself decorated the landscape
with his straw hat and overalls, weeding, spraying, rolling, driving
the lawn-mower, raking bed and path, cutting and training vines,
clipping hedges,&mdash;a sober, bucolic, agreeable figure to the youthful
chatelaine of the house of Greensleeve.</p>

<p>Clive had come once more from town to say that he was sailing
for England the following day; that he would be away a month all
told, and that he would return by the middle of August.</p>

<p>They had spent the morning driving together in her buckboard&mdash;the
happiest morning perhaps in their lives.</p>

<p>It promised to be a perfect day; and she was so carefree, so
contented, so certain of the world's kindness, so shyly tender
with him, so engagingly humorous at his expense, that the prospect
of a month's separation ceased for the time to appal him.</p>

<p>Concerning his interview with his wife she had asked him nothing;
nor even why he was going abroad. Whether she guessed the truth;
whether she had come to understand the situation through other
and occult agencies, he could not surmise. But one thing was plain
enough; nothing that had happened or that threatened to happen
was now disturbing her. And her gaiety and high spirits were reassuring
him and tranquillising his mind to a degree for which, on reflection,
he could scarcely account, knowing the ultimate hopelessness of
their situation.</p>

<p>Yet her sheer good spirits carried him with her, heart and mind,
that morning. And when it was time for him to go she said good-bye
to him with a smile as tenderly gay and as happy and confident
as though he were to return on the morrow. And went back to her
magic house of dreams and her fairy garden, knowing that, except
for him, their rainbow magic must vanish and the tinted spell
fade, and the soft enchantment dissolve forever leaving at her
feet only a sunlit ruin amid the stillness of desolation.</p>

<p>But the magic held. Every day she wrote him. Wireless messages
came to her from him for a while; ceased; then re-commenced, followed
presently by cablegrams and finally by letters.</p>

<p>So the magic held through the long sunny summer days. And Athalie
worked in her garden and strayed far afield, both driving and
afoot. And she studied and practised piano, and made curtains,
and purchased furniture.</p>

<p>Also she wrote letters to her sisters, long since wedded to husbands,
babies, and homes in the West. Her brother Jack, she learned,
had joined the Navy at Puget Sound, and had now become a petty
officer aboard the new battle-cruiser <em>Bon Homme Richard</em>
in Asiatic waters. She wrote to him, also, and sent him a money
order, gaily suggesting that he use it to educate himself as a
good sailor should, and that he save his pay for a future wife
and baby&mdash;the latter, as she wrote, "being doubtless the most
desirable attainment this side of Heaven."</p>

<p>In her bedroom were photographs of Catharine's children and of
the little boy which Doris had brought into the world; and sometimes,
in the hot midsummer afternoons, she would lie on her pillow and
look at these photographs until the little faces faded to a glimmer
as slumber dulled her eyes.</p>

<p>Captain Dane came once or twice to spend the day with her; and
it was pleasant, afterward, for her to remember this big, blond,
sunburnt man as part of all that she most cared for. Together
they drove and walked and idled through house and garden: and
when he went away, to sail the following day for those eternal
forests which conceal the hearthstone of the Western World, he
knew from her own lips about her love for Clive. He was the only
person she ever told.</p>

<p>A few of her friends she asked to the house for quiet week-ends;
the impression their visits made upon her was pleasant but colourless.</p>

<p>And it seemed singular, as she thought it over, how subordinate,
how unaccented had always been all these people who came into
her life, lingered, and faded out of it, leaving only the impressions
of backgrounds and accessories against which only one figure stood
clear and distinct&mdash;her lover's.</p>

<p>Yes, of all men she had ever known, only Clive seemed real; and
he dominated every scene of her girlhood and her womanhood as
her mother had been the only really living centre of her childhood.</p>

<p>All else seemed to her like a moving and subdued background,&mdash;an
endless series of grey scenes vaguely painted through which figures
came and went, some shadowy and colourless as phantoms, some soberly
outlined, some delicately tinted&mdash;but all more or less subordinate,
more or less monochromatic, unimportant except for balance and
composition, as painters use indefinite shapes and shades so that
the eyes may more perfectly concentrate on the centre of their
inspiration.</p>

<p>And the centre of all, for her, was Clive. Since her mother's
death there had been no other point of view for her, no other
focus for the forces of her mind, no other real desire, no other
content. He had entered her child's life and had become, instantly,
all that the child-world held for her. And it was so through the
years of her girlhood. Absent, or during his brief reappearances,
the central focus of her heart and mind was Clive. And, in womanhood,
all forces in her mind and spirit and, now, of body, centred in
this man who stood out against the faded tapestry of the world
all alone for her, the only living thing on earth with which her
heart had mated as a child, and in which now her mind and spirit
had found Nirvana.</p>

<p>All men, all women, seemed to have their shadowy being only to
make this man more real to her.</p>

<p>Friends came, remained, and went, &mdash;Cecil Reeve, gay, charmed
with everything, and, as always, mischievously ready to pay court
to her; Francis Hargrave, politely surprised but full of courteous
admiration for her good taste; John Lyndhurst, Grismer, Harry
Ferris, Young Welter, Arthur Ensart, and James Allys,&mdash;all were
bidden for the day; all came, marvelled in the several manners
characteristic of them, and finally went their various ways, serving
only, as always, to make clearer to her the fadeless memory of
an absent man. For, to her, the merest thought of him was more
real, more warm and vivid, than all of these, even while their
eager eyes sought hers and their voices were sounding in her ears.</p>

<p>Nina Grey came with Anne Randolph for a week-end; and then came
Jeanne Delauny, and Adele Millis. The memory of their visits lingered
with Athalie as long, perhaps, as the scent of roses hangs in
a dim, still room before the windows are open in the morning to
the outer air.</p>

<p>The first of August a cicada droned from the hill-top woods and
all her garden became saturated with the homely and bewitching
odour of old-fashioned rockets.</p>

<p>On the grey wall nasturtiums blazed; long stretches of brilliant
portulaca edged the herbaceous borders; clusters of auratum lilies
hung in the transparent shadow of Cydonia and Spirea; and the
first great dahlias faced her in maroon splendour from the spiked
thickets along the wall.</p>

<p>Once or twice she went to town on shopping bent, and on one of
these occasions impulse took her to the apartment furnished for
her so long ago by Clive.</p>

<p>She had not meant to go in, merely intended to pass the house,
speak to Michael, perhaps, if indeed, he still presided over door
and elevator.</p>

<p>And there he was, outside the door on a chair, smoking his clay
pipe and surveying the hot and silent street, where not even a
sparrow stirred.</p>

<p>"Michael," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not know her, then: "God's glory!" he said
huskily, getting to his feet&mdash;"is it the sweet face o' Miss Greensleeve
or the angel in her come back f'r to bless us all?"</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, and he held it and looked at her, earnestly,
wistfully; then, with the flashing change of his race, the grin
broke out:</p>

<p>"I'm that proud to be remembered by the likes o' you, Miss Athalie!
Are ye well, now?&mdash;an' happy? I thank God for that! I am substantial&mdash;with
my respects, ma'am, f'r the kind inquiry. And Hafiz? Glory be,
was there ever such a cat now? D'ye mind the day we tuk him in
a bashket?&mdash;an' the sufferin' yowls of the poor, dear creature.
Sure I'm that glad to hear he's well;&mdash;and manny mice to him,
Miss Athalie!"</p>

<p>Athalie laughed: "I suppose all your tenants are away in the
country," she ventured.</p>

<p>"Barrin' wan or two, Miss. Ye know the young Master will suffer
no one in your own apartment."</p>

<p>"Is it still unoccupied, Michael?"</p>

<p>"Deed it is, Miss. Would ye care f'r to look around. There is
nothing changed there. I dust it meself."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl in a low voice, "I will look at it."</p>

<p>So Michael took her up in the lift, unlocked the door for her,
and then with the fine instinct of his race, forbore to follow
her.</p>

<p>The shades in the square living-room were lowered; she raised
one. And the dim, golden past took shadowy shape again before
her eyes.</p>


<p>She moved slowly from one object to another, touching caressingly
where memory was tenderest. She looked at the furniture, the pictures,&mdash;at
the fireplace where in her mind's eye she could see <em>him</em>
bending to light the first fire that had ever blazed there.</p>

<p>For a little while she sat on the big lounge, her dreamy eyes
fixed on the spot where Clive's father had stood and she remembered
Jacques Renouf, too, and the lost city of Yhdunez.... And, somehow
her memories receded still further toward earlier years; and she
thought of the sunny office where Mr. Wahlbaum used to sit; and
she seemed to see the curtains stirring in the wind.</p>

<p>After a while she rose and walked slowly along the hall to her
own room.</p>

<p>Everything was there as she had left it; the toilet silver, evidently
kept clean and bright by Michael, the little Dresden cupids on
the mantel, the dainty clock, still running&mdash;further confirmation
of Michael's ministrations&mdash;the fresh linen on the bed. Nothing
had been changed through all these changing years. She softly
opened the clothes-press door; there hung her gowns&mdash;silent witnesses
of her youth, strangely and daintily grotesque in fashion. One
by one she examined them, a smile edging her lips, and, in her
eyes, tears.</p>

<p>All revery is tinged with melancholy; and it was so with her
when she stood among the forgotten gowns of years ago.</p>

<p>It was so, too, when, one by one she unlocked and opened the
drawers of dresser and bureau. From soft, ordered heaps of silk
and lace and sheerest linen a faint perfume mounted; and it was
as though she subtly renewed an exquisite and secret intimacy
with a youth and innocence half-forgotten in the sadder wisdom
of later days.</p>

<p>From the still and scented twilight of a vanished year, to her
own apartment perched high above the sun-smitten city she went,
merely to find herself again, and look around upon what fortune
had brought to her through her own endeavour.</p>

<p>But, somehow, the old prejudices had gone; the old instincts
of pride and independence had been obliterated, merged in a serene
and tranquil unity of mind and will and spirit with the man in
whom every atom of her belief and faith was now centred.</p>

<p>It mattered no longer to her what material portion of her possessions
and environment was due to her own efforts, or to his. Nothing
that might be called hers could remain conceivable as hers unless
he shared it. Their rights in each other included everything temporal
and spiritual; everything of mind and matter alike. Of what consequence,
then, might be the origin of possessions that could not exist
for her unless possession were mutual?</p>

<p>Nothing would be real to her, nothing of value, unless so marked
by his interest and his approval. And now she knew that even the
world itself must become but a shadow, were he not living to make
it real.</p>

<p>It was a fearfully hot day in town, and she waited until evening
to go back to Spring Pond.</p>

<p>When she arrived, Mrs. Connor had a cablegram for her from Clive
saying that he was sailing and would see her before the month
ended.</p>

<p>Late into the night she looked for him in her crystal but could
see nothing save a blue and tranquil sea and gulls flying, and
always on the curved world's edge a far stain of smoke against
the sky.</p>

<p>Her mother was in her room that night, seated near the window
as though to keep the vigil that her daughter kept, brooding above
the crystal.</p>

<p>It was Friday, the twenty-first, and a new moon. The starlight
was magnificent in the August skies: once or twice meteors fell.
But in the depths of her crystal she saw always a sunlit sea and
a gull's wings flashing.</p>

<p>Toward morning when the world had grown its darkest and stillest,
she went over to where her mother was sitting beside the window,
and knelt down beside her chair.</p>

<p>And so in voiceless and tender communion she nestled close, her
golden head resting against her mother's knees.</p>

<p>Dawn found her there asleep beside an empty chair.</p>
