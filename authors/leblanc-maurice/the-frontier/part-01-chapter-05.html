<p>A hand was passed through the bars of the gate at the top of the
staircase leading to the terrace and seized the clapper of the little
bell fastened to one of the bars. A push ... and the gate was open.
</p><p>"Not much difficulty about that," said the man, carefully stepping on to
the terrace. "Since the mountain won't come to Dourlowski, Dourlowski
must ..."
</p><p>The man stopped: he had heard voices. But, on listening, he found that
the sound of voices came from behind the house. He quietly entered the
drawing-room, therefore, walked straight across it and reached the
windows on the other side. A little further, at the foot of the steps,
he saw a carriage ready to start, with Suzanne and her father sitting in
it. The Morestal family were standing round the carriage.
</p><p>"That's all right," said Morestal. "Philippe and I will walk ... and
we'll do the same coming home, won't we, my boy?"
</p><p>"And you, Marthe?" asked Jorancé.
</p><p>"No, thank you. I will stay with mamma."
</p><p>"Well, we'll send your men home to you soon ... especially as Morestal
likes going to bed early. They will leave the house at ten o'clock
precisely; and I will go a bit of the way with them, as far as the
Butte."
</p><p>"That's it," said Morestal. "We shall see the demolished post by
moonlight. And we shall be here by half-past ten, mother. That's a
promise. Off you go, Victor."
</p><p>The carriage drove off. Dourlowski, in the drawing-room, took out his
watch and set it by the clock, whispering:
</p><p>"Consequently, they'll reach the Butte at a quarter past ten. That's a
good thing to know. And now to inform old Morestal that his friend
Dourlowski has come to hunt him up in his happy home."
</p><p>Putting two of his fingers to his mouth, he gave the same faint whistle
which Morestal had heard that morning, something like the unfinished
note of certain birds:
</p><p>"That's done it," he grinned. "The old boy pricked up his ears. He has
sent the others for a stroll in the garden and he's coming this way...."
</p><p>He made a movement backwards on hearing Morestal's footstep in the hall,
for he knew the old fellow was not given to joking. And, in fact,
Morestal, the moment he entered, ran up to him and took him by the
collar of his jacket:
</p><p>"What are you doing here? What do you mean by it? How dare you?... I'll
show you a road which you don't know of!"
</p><p>Dourlowski began to laugh with his crooked mouth:
</p><p>"My dear M. Morestal, you'll dirty your hands."
</p><p>His clothes were shiny and thick with grease, stretched over a small
round body, that contrasted strangely with his lean and bony face. And
all this formed a jovial, grotesque and rather alarming picture.
</p><p>Morestal let go his hold and, in an imperative tone:
</p><p>"Explain yourself and quickly. I don't want my son to see you here.
Speak."
</p><p>There was no time to be lost, as Dourlowski saw:
</p><p>"Well, look here," he said. "It's a question of a young soldier in the
Börsweilen garrison. He's too unhappy for words where he is ... and he's
mad at having to serve Germany."
</p><p>"A ne'er-do-well," growled Morestal. "A slacker who doesn't want to
work."
</p><p>"No, not this one, I tell you, not this one. He means to enlist in the
Foreign Legion. He loves France."
</p><p>"Yes, always the same story. And then--pah!--one never hears of them
again. More gallows' seed!"
</p><p>Dourlowski seemed shocked and scandalized:
</p><p>"How can you say such a thing, M. Morestal?... If you only knew! A brave
soldier who asks nothing better than to die fighting for our country."
</p><p>The old man started:
</p><p>"'Our country,' indeed! I forbid you to speak like that. Have you the
least idea where you hail from? A scamp like you has no country."
</p><p>"You forget all that I have done, M. Morestal.... You and I, between us,
have 'passed' four of them already."
</p><p>"Hold your tongue!" said Morestal, who seemed to take no pleasure in
this recollection. "Hold your tongue.... If the thing had never happened
..."
</p><p>"It would happen just the same, because you are a good-natured man and
because there are things.... There.... It's like with this lad.... It
would break your heart to see him.... Johann Baufeld his name is.... His
father is just dead ... and he wants to go out to his mother, who was
divorced and who lives in Algeria.... Such a nice lad, full of
pluck...."
</p><p>"Well," said Morestal, "he's only got to 'pass'! You don't want me for
that."
</p><p>"And what about the money? He hasn't a sou. Besides, there's no one
like you to tell us all the paths, the best place to cross at, the best
time to select...."
</p><p>"I'll see about it.... I'll see about it," said Morestal. "There's no
hurry...."
</p><p>"Yes, there is...."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"The Börsweilen regiment is manoeuvring on the slopes of the Vosges.
If you'll lend us a hand, I'll run down to Saint-Élophe first, buy a
suit of second-hand French peasant's clothes and go and find my man.
Then I'll bring him to the old barn in your little farm to-night ... as
I have done before...."
</p><p>"Where is he at this moment?"
</p><p>"His company is quartered in the Albern Woods."
</p><p>"But that's next door to the frontier!" cried Morestal. "An hour's walk,
no more."
</p><p>"Just so; but how he is to reach the frontier? Where is he to cross it?"
</p><p>"That's quite easy," said Morestal, taking up a pencil and a sheet of
note-paper. "Look, here are the Albern Woods. Here's the Col du Diable.
Here's the Butte-aux-Loups.... Well, he's only got to leave the woods by
the Fontaine-Froide and take the first path to the left, by the Roche de
..."
</p><p>He suddenly interrupted himself, looked at Dourlowski with a suspicious
air and said:
</p><p>"But you know the road as well as I do ... there's no doubt about
that.... So ..."
</p><p>"My word," said Dourlowski, "I always go by the Col du Diable and the
factory."
</p><p>Morestal reflected for a moment, scribbled a few lines and a few words
in an absent-minded sort of way and then, with a movement of quick
resolution, took the sheet of note-paper, crumpled it into a ball and
flung it into the waste-paper basket:
</p><p>"No, no, certainly not!" he cried. "I've had enough of this nonsense!
One succeeds four times; and, at the fifth attempt.... Besides, it's not
a business I care about.... A soldier's a soldier ... whatever uniform
he wears...."
</p><p>"Still ..." mumbled Dourlowski.
</p><p>"I refuse. Not to mention that they suspect me over yonder. The German
commissary gives me a queer look when he meets me; and I won't risk ..."
</p><p>"You're risking nothing."
</p><p>"That'll do; and clear out of this as fast as you can.... Oh, wait a
second!... I think I ... Listen ..."
</p><p>Morestal ran to the windows overlooking the garden. Quick as thought,
Dourlowski stooped and fished Morestal's crumpled sheet out of the
waste-paper basket. He hid it in the palm of his hand and, raising his
voice:
</p><p>"We'll say no more about it, as you don't see your way to help me," he
said. "I give it up."
</p><p>"That's it," said Morestal, who had seen no one in the garden. "You give
it up, my friend: it's the best thing you can do."
</p><p>He took Dourlowski by the shoulders and pushed him towards the terrace:
</p><p>"Be off ... and don't come back.... There's nothing more for you to do
here ... absolutely nothing...."
</p><p>He hoped to get rid of the fellow without being perceived, but, as he
reached the gate, he saw his wife, his son and Marthe come up the
staircase, after strolling round the walls of the Old Mill.
</p><p>Dourlowski took off his hat and distributed bows all round. Then, as
soon as the road was clear, he disappeared.
</p><p>Mme. Morestal expressed her astonishment:
</p><p>"What! Do you still see that rogue of a Dourlowski?"
</p><p>"Oh, it was an accident!..."
</p><p>"You are very wrong to have him in the house. We don't even know where
he comes from or what his trade is."
</p><p>"He's a hawker."
</p><p>"A spy, rather: that's what they say about him."
</p><p>"Tah! In the pay of which country?"
</p><p>"Of both, very likely. Victor thinks he saw him with the German
commissary, two Sundays ago."
</p><p>"With Weisslicht? Impossible. He doesn't even know him."
</p><p>"I'm telling you what they say. In any case, Morestal, be careful with
that fellow. He's a bird of ill-omen."
</p><p>"Come, come, mother, no hard words. This is a day of rejoicing.... Are
you ready, Philippe?"
