<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
January found Ann Veronica a student in the biological laboratory
of the Central Imperial College that towers up from among the
back streets in the angle between Euston Road and Great Portland
Street.  She was working very steadily at the Advanced Course in
Comparative Anatomy, wonderfully relieved to have her mind
engaged upon one methodically developing theme in the place of
the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months, and
doing her utmost to keep right in the back of her mind and out of
sight the facts, firstly, that she had achieved this haven of
satisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty
pounds, and, secondly, that her present position was necessarily
temporary and her outlook quite uncertain.
<P>
The biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own.
<P>
It was at the top of the building, and looked clear over a
clustering mass of inferior buildings toward Regent's Park.  It
was long and narrow, a well-lit, well-ventilated, quiet gallery
of small tables and sinks, pervaded by a thin smell of methylated
spirit and of a mitigated and sterilized organic decay.  Along
the inner side was a wonderfully arranged series of displayed
specimens that Russell himself had prepared. The supreme effect
for Ann Veronica was its surpassing relevance; it made every
other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and confused.  The
whole place and everything in it aimed at one thing--to
illustrate, to elaborate, to criticise and illuminate, and make
ever plainer and plainer the significance of animal and vegetable
structure.  It dealt from floor to ceiling and end to end with
the Theory of the Forms of Life; the very duster by the
blackboard was there to do its share in that work, the very
washers in the taps; the room was more simply concentrated in aim
even than a church. To that, perhaps, a large part of its
satisfyingness was due.  Contrasted with the confused movement
and presences of a Fabian meeting, or the inexplicable enthusiasm
behind the suffrage demand, with the speeches that were partly
egotistical displays, partly artful manoeuvres, and partly
incoherent cries for unsoundly formulated ends, compared with the
comings and goings of audiences and supporters that were like the
eddy-driven drift of paper in the street, this long, quiet,
methodical chamber shone like a star seen through clouds.
<P>
Day after day for a measured hour in the lecture-theatre, with
elaborate power and patience, Russell pieced together difficulty
and suggestion, instance and counter-instance, in the elaborate
construction of the family tree of life.  And then the students
went into the long laboratory and followed out these facts in
almost living tissue with microscope and scalpel, probe and
microtome, and the utmost of their skill and care, making now and
then a raid into the compact museum of illustration next door, in
which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined
ranks, under the direction of the demonstrator Capes.  There was
a couple of blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables, and
at these Capes, with quick and nervous speech that contrasted
vividly with Russell's slow, definitive articulation, directed
the dissection and made illuminating comments on the structures
under examination.  Then he would come along the laboratory,
sitting down by each student in turn, checking the work and
discussing its difficulties, and answering questions arising out
of Russell's lecture.
<P>
Ann Veronica had come to the Imperial College obsessed by the
great figure of Russell, by the part he had played in the
Darwinian controversies, and by the resolute effect of the
grim-lipped, yellow, leonine face beneath the mane of silvery
hair.  Capes was rather a discovery.  Capes was something
superadded.  Russell burned like a beacon, but Capes illuminated
by darting flashes and threw light, even if it was but momentary
light, into a hundred corners that Russell left steadfastly in
the shade.
<P>
Capes was an exceptionally fair man of two or three-and-thirty,
so ruddily blond that it was a mercy he had escaped light
eyelashes, and with a minor but by no means contemptible
reputation of his own.  He talked at the blackboard in a
pleasant, very slightly lisping voice with a curious spontaneity,
and was sometimes very clumsy in his exposition, and sometimes
very vivid. He dissected rather awkwardly and hurriedly, but, on
the whole, effectively, and drew with an impatient directness
that made up in significance what it lacked in precision.  Across
the blackboard the colored chalks flew like flights of variously
tinted rockets as diagram after diagram flickered into being.
<P>
There happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and
women in the advanced laboratory, perhaps because the class as a
whole was an exceptionally small one.  It numbered nine, and four
of these were women students.  As a consequence of its small
size, it was possible to get along with the work on a much easier
and more colloquial footing than a larger class would have
permitted.  And a custom had grown up of a general tea at four
o'clock, under the auspices of a Miss Garvice, a tall and
graceful girl of distinguished intellectual incompetence, in whom
the hostess instinct seemed to be abnormally developed.
<P>
Capes would come to these teas; he evidently liked to come, and
he would appear in the doorway of the preparation-room, a
pleasing note of shyness in his manner, hovering for an
invitation.
<P>
From the first, Ann Veronica found him an exceptionally
interesting man.  To begin with, he struck her as being the most
variable person she had ever encountered.  At times he was
brilliant and masterful, talked round and over every one, and
would have been domineering if he had not been extraordinarily
kindly; at times he was almost monosyllabic, and defeated Miss
Garvice's most skilful attempts to draw him out. Sometimes he was
obviously irritable and uncomfortable and unfortunate in his
efforts to seem at ease.  And sometimes he overflowed with a
peculiarly malignant wit that played, with devastating effect,
upon any topics that had the courage to face it.  Ann Veronica's
experiences of men had been among more stable types--Teddy, who
was always absurd; her father, who was always authoritative and
sentimental; Manning, who was always Manning.  And most of the
others she had met had, she felt, the same steadfastness. 
Goopes, she was sure was always high-browed and slow and
Socratic.  And Ramage too--about Ramage there would always be
that air of avidity, that air of knowledge and inquiry, the
mixture of things in his talk that were rather good with things
that were rather poor.  But one could not count with any
confidence upon Capes.
<P>
The five men students were a mixed company.  There was a very
white-faced youngster of eighteen who brushed back his hair
exactly in Russell's manner, and was disposed to be uncomfortably
silent when he was near her, and to whom she felt it was only
Christian kindness to be consistently pleasant; and a lax young
man of five-and-twenty in navy blue, who mingled Marx and Bebel
with the more orthodox gods of the biological pantheon.  There
was a short, red-faced, resolute youth who inherited an
authoritative attitude upon bacteriology from his father; a
Japanese student of unassuming manners who drew beautifully and
had an imperfect knowledge of English; and a dark, unwashed
Scotchman with complicated spectacles, who would come every
morning as a sort of volunteer supplementary demonstrator, look
very closely at her work and her, tell her that her dissections
were "fairish," or "very fairish indeed," or "high above the
normal female standard," hover as if for some outbreak of
passionate gratitude and with admiring retrospects that made the
facetted spectacles gleam like diamonds, return to his own place.
<P>
The women, Ann Veronica thought, were not quite so interesting as
the men.  There were two school-mistresses, one of whom--Miss
Klegg--might have been a first cousin to Miss Miniver, she had so
many Miniver traits; there was a preoccupied girl whose name Ann
Veronica never learned, but who worked remarkably well; and Miss
Garvice, who began by attracting her very greatly--she moved so
beautifully--and ended by giving her the impression that moving
beautifully was the beginning and end of her being.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
The next few weeks were a time of the very liveliest thought and
growth for Ann Veronica.  The crowding impressions of the
previous weeks seemed to run together directly her mind left the
chaotic search for employment and came into touch again with a
coherent and systematic development of ideas.  The advanced work
at the Central Imperial College was in the closest touch with
living interests and current controversies; it drew its
illustrations and material from Russell's two great
researches--upon the relation of the brachiopods to the
echinodermata, and upon the secondary and tertiary mammalian and
pseudo-mammalian factors in the free larval forms of various
marine organisms. Moreover, a vigorous fire of mutual criticism
was going on now between the Imperial College and the Cambridge
Mendelians and echoed in the lectures.  From beginning to end it
was first-hand stuff.
<P>
But the influence of the science radiated far beyond its own
special field--beyond those beautiful but highly technical
problems with which we do not propose for a moment to trouble the
naturally terrified reader. Biology is an extraordinarily
digestive science.  It throws out a number of broad experimental
generalizations, and then sets out to bring into harmony or
relation with these an infinitely multifarious collection of
phenomena. The little streaks upon the germinating area of an
egg, the nervous movements of an impatient horse, the trick of a
calculating boy, the senses of a fish, the fungus at the root of
a garden flower, and the slime upon a sea-wet rock--ten thousand
such things bear their witness and are illuminated.  And not only
did these tentacular generalizations gather all the facts of
natural history and comparative anatomy together, but they seemed
always stretching out further and further into a world of
interests that lay altogether outside their legitimate bounds.
<P>
It came to Ann Veronica one night after a long talk with Miss
Miniver, as a sudden remarkable thing, as a grotesque, novel
aspect, that this slowly elaborating biological scheme had
something more than an academic interest for herself.  And not
only so, but that it was after all, a more systematic and
particular method of examining just the same questions that
underlay the discussions of the Fabian Society, the talk of the
West Central Arts Club, the chatter of the studios and the deep,
the bottomless discussions of the simple-life homes. It was the
same Bios whose nature and drift and ways and methods and aspects
engaged them all.  And she, she in her own person too, was this
eternal Bios, beginning again its recurrent journey to selection
and multiplication and failure or survival.
<P>
But this was but a momentary gleam of personal application, and
at this time she followed it up no further.
<P>
And now Ann Veronica's evenings were also becoming very busy. 
She pursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the
Suffragist agitation in the company of Miss Miniver.  They went
to various central and local Fabian gatherings, and to a number
of suffrage meetings.  Teddy Widgett hovered on the fringe of all
these gatherings, blinking at Ann Veronica and occasionally
making a wildly friendly dash at her, and carrying her and Miss
Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity of other
youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings.  Then Mr.
Manning loomed up ever and again into her world, full of a futile
solicitude, and almost always declaring she was splendid,
splendid, and wishing he could talk things out with her.  Teas he
contributed to the commissariat of Ann Veronica's campaign--quite
a number of teas.  He would get her to come to tea with him,
usually in a pleasant tea-room over a fruit-shop in Tottenham
Court Road, and he would discuss his own point of view and hint
at a thousand devotions were she but to command him.  And he
would express various artistic sensibilities and aesthetic
appreciations in carefully punctuated sentences and a large,
clear voice.  At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition
of Meredith's novels, very prettily bound in flexible leather,
being guided in the choice of an author, as he intimated, rather
by her preferences than his own.
<P>
There was something markedly and deliberately liberal-minded in
his manner in all their encounters. He conveyed not only his
sense of the extreme want of correctitude in their unsanctioned
meetings, but also that, so far as he was concerned, this
irregularity mattered not at all, that he had flung--and kept on
flinging --such considerations to the wind.
<P>
And, in addition, she was now seeing and talking to Ramage almost
weekly, on a theory which she took very gravely, that they were
exceptionally friends.  He would ask her to come to dinner with
him in some little Italian or semi-Bohemian restaurant in the
district toward Soho, or in one of the more stylish and
magnificent establishments about Piccadilly Circus, and for the
most part she did not care to refuse.  Nor, indeed, did she want
to refuse.  These dinners, from their lavish display of ambiguous
hors d'oeuvre to their skimpy ices in dishes of frilled paper,
with their Chianti flasks and Parmesan dishes and their polyglot
waiters and polyglot clientele, were very funny and bright; and
she really liked Ramage, and valued his help and advice.  It was
interesting to see how different and characteristic his mode of
approach was to all sorts of questions that interested her, and
it was amusing to discover this other side to the life of a
Morningside Park inhabitant.  She had thought that all
Morningside Park householders came home before seven at the
latest, as her father usually did.  Ramage talked always about
women or some woman's concern, and very much about Ann Veronica's
own outlook upon life.  He was always drawing contrasts between a
woman's lot and a man's, and treating her as a wonderful new
departure in this comparison.  Ann Veronica liked their
relationship all the more because it was an unusual one.
<P>
After these dinners they would have a walk, usually to the Thames
Embankment to see the two sweeps of river on either side of
Waterloo Bridge; and then they would part at Westminster Bridge,
perhaps, and he would go on to Waterloo.  Once he suggested they
should go to a music-hall and see a wonderful new dancer, but Ann
Veronica did not feel she cared to see a new dancer.  So,
instead, they talked of dancing and what it might mean in a human
life.  Ann Veronica thought it was a spontaneous release of
energy expressive of well-being, but Ramage thought that by
dancing, men, and such birds and animals as dance, come to feel
and think of their bodies.
<P>
This intercourse, which had been planned to warm Ann Veronica to
a familiar affection with Ramage, was certainly warming Ramage to
a constantly deepening interest in Ann Veronica.  He felt that he
was getting on with her very slowly indeed, but he did not see
how he could get on faster.  He had, he felt, to create certain
ideas and vivify certain curiosities and feelings in her. Until
that was done a certain experience of life assured him that a
girl is a locked coldness against a man's approach.  She had all
the fascination of being absolutely perplexing in this respect. 
On the one hand, she seemed to think plainly and simply, and
would talk serenely and freely about topics that most women have
been trained either to avoid or conceal; and on the other she was
unconscious, or else she had an air of being unconscious--that
was the riddle--to all sorts of personal applications that almost
any girl or woman, one might have thought, would have made.  He
was always doing his best to call her attention to the fact that
he was a man of spirit and quality and experience, and she a
young and beautiful woman, and that all sorts of constructions
upon their relationship were possible, trusting her to go on from
that to the idea that all sorts of relationships were possible. 
She responded with an unfaltering appearance of insensibility,
and never as a young and beautiful woman conscious of sex; always
in the character of an intelligent girl student.
<P>
His perception of her personal beauty deepened and quickened with
each encounter.  Every now and then her general presence became
radiantly dazzling in his eyes; she would appear in the street
coming toward him, a surprise, so fine and smiling and welcoming
was she, so expanded and illuminated and living, in contrast with
his mere expectation.  Or he would find something--a wave in her
hair, a little line in the contour of her brow or neck, that made
an exquisite discovery.
<P>
He was beginning to think about her inordinately. He would sit in
his inner office and compose conversations with her, penetrating,
illuminating, and nearly conclusive--conversations that never
proved to be of the slightest use at all with her when he met her
face to face. And he began also at times to wake at night and
think about her.
<P>
He thought of her and himself, and no longer in that vein of
incidental adventure in which he had begun.  He thought, too, of
the fretful invalid who lay in the next room to his, whose money
had created his business and made his position in the world.
<P>
"I've had most of the things I wanted," said Ramage, in the
stillness of the night.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
For a time Ann Veronica's family had desisted from direct offers
of a free pardon; they were evidently waiting for her resources
to come to an end.  Neither father, aunt, nor brothers made a
sign, and then one afternoon in early February her aunt came up
in a state between expostulation and dignified resentment, but
obviously very anxious for Ann Veronica's welfare. "I had a dream
in the night," she said.  "I saw you in a sort of sloping,
slippery place, holding on by your hands and slipping.  You
seemed to me to be slipping and slipping, and your face was
white.  It was really most vivid, most vivid!  You seemed to be
slipping and just going to tumble and holding on.  It made me
wake up, and there I lay thinking of you, spending your nights up
here all alone, and no one to look after you.  I wondered what
you could be doing and what might be happening to you.  I said to
myself at once, 'Either this is a coincidence or the caper
sauce.'  But I made sure it was you.  I felt I MUST do something
anyhow, and up I came just as soon as I could to see you."
<P>
She had spoken rather rapidly.  "I can't help saying it," she
said, with the quality of her voice altering, "but I do NOT think
it is right for an unprotected girl to be in London alone as you
are."
<P>
"But I'm quite equal to taking care of myself, aunt."
<P>
"It must be most uncomfortable here.  It is most uncomfortable
for every one concerned."
<P>
She spoke with a certain asperity.  She felt that Ann Veronica
had duped her in that dream, and now that she had come up to
London she might as well speak her mind.
<P>
"No Christmas dinner," she said, "or anything nice!  One doesn't
even know what you are doing."
<P>
"I'm going on working for my degree."
<P>
"Why couldn't you do that at home?"
<P>
"I'm working at the Imperial College.  You see, aunt, it's the
only possible way for me to get a good degree in my subjects, and
father won't hear of it. There'd only be endless rows if I was at
home.  And how could I come home--when he locks me in rooms and
all that?"
<P>
"I do wish this wasn't going on," said Miss Stanley, after a
pause.  "I do wish you and your father could come to some
agreement."
<P>
Ann Veronica responded with conviction:  "I wish so, too."
<P>
"Can't we arrange something?  Can't we make a sort of treaty?"
<P>
"He wouldn't keep it.  He would get very cross one evening and no
one would dare to remind him of it."
<P>
"How can you say such things?"
<P>
"But he would!"
<P>
"Still, it isn't your place to say so."
<P>
"It prevents a treaty."
<P>
"Couldn't _I_ make a treaty?"
<P>
Ann Veronica thought, and could not see any possible treaty that
would leave it open for her to have quasi-surreptitious dinners
with Ramage or go on walking round the London squares discussing
Socialism with Miss Miniver toward the small hours.  She had
tasted freedom now, and so far she had not felt the need of
protection.  Still, there certainly was something in the idea of
a treaty.
<P>
"I don't see at all how you can be managing," said Miss Stanley,
and Ann Veronica hastened to reply, "I do on very little."  Her
mind went back to that treaty.
<P>
"And aren't there fees to pay at the Imperial College?" her aunt
was saying--a disagreeable question.
<P>
"There are a few fees."
<P>
"Then how have you managed?"
<P>
"Bother!" said Ann Veronica to herself, and tried not to look
guilty.  "I was able to borrow the money."
<P>
"Borrow the money!  But who lent you the money?"
<P>
"A friend," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
She felt herself getting into a corner.  She sought hastily in
her mind for a plausible answer to an obvious question that
didn't come.  Her aunt went off at a tangent.  "But my dear Ann
Veronica, you will be getting into debt!"
<P>
Ann Veronica at once, and with a feeling of immense relief, took
refuge in her dignity.  "I think, aunt," she said, "you might
trust to my self-respect to keep me out of that."
<P>
For the moment her aunt could not think of any reply to this
counterstroke, and Ann Veronica followed up her advantage by a
sudden inquiry about her abandoned boots.
<P>
But in the train going home her aunt reasoned it out.
<P>
"If she is borrowing money," said Miss Stanley, "she MUST be
getting into debt.  It's all nonsense. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
It was by imperceptible degrees that Capes became important in
Ann Veronica's thoughts.  But then he began to take steps, and,
at last, strides to something more and more like predominance. 
She began by being interested in his demonstrations and his
biological theory, then she was attracted by his character, and
then, in a manner, she fell in love with his mind.
<P>
One day they were at tea in the laboratory and a discussion
sprang up about the question of women's suffrage.  The movement
was then in its earlier militant phases, and one of the women
only, Miss Garvice, opposed it, though Ann Veronica was disposed
to be lukewarm.  But a man's opposition always inclined her to
the suffrage side; she had a curious feeling of loyalty in seeing
the more aggressive women through. Capes was irritatingly
judicial in the matter, neither absurdly against, in which case
one might have smashed him, or hopelessly undecided, but tepidly
sceptical. Miss Klegg and the youngest girl made a vigorous
attack on Miss Garvice, who had said she thought women lost
something infinitely precious by mingling in the conflicts of
life.  The discussion wandered, and was punctuated with bread and
butter.  Capes was inclined to support Miss Klegg until Miss
Garvice cornered him by quoting him against himself, and citing a
recent paper in the Nineteenth Century, in which, following
Atkinson, he had made a vigorous and damaging attack on Lester
Ward's case for the primitive matriarchate and the predominant
importance of the female throughout the animal kingdom.
<P>
Ann Veronica was not aware of this literary side of her teacher;
she had a little tinge of annoyance at Miss Garvice's advantage. 
Afterwards she hunted up the article in question, and it seemed
to her quite delightfully written and argued.  Capes had the gift
of easy, unaffected writing, coupled with very clear and logical
thinking, and to follow his written thought gave her the
sensation of cutting things with a perfectly new, perfectly sharp
knife.  She found herself anxious to read more of him, and the
next Wednesday she went to the British Museum and hunted first
among the half-crown magazines for his essays and then through
various scientific quarterlies for his research papers. The
ordinary research paper, when it is not extravagant theorizing,
is apt to be rather sawdusty in texture, and Ann Veronica was
delighted to find the same easy and confident luminosity that
distinguished his work for the general reader.  She returned to
these latter, and at the back of her mind, as she looked them
over again, was a very distinct resolve to quote them after the
manner of Miss Garvice at the very first opportunity.
<P>
When she got home to her lodgings that evening she reflected with
something like surprise upon her half-day's employment, and
decided that it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was
a really very interesting person indeed.
<P>
And then she fell into a musing about Capes.  She wondered why he
was so distinctive, so unlike other men, and it never occurred to
her for some time that this might be because she was falling in
love with him.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
Yet Ann Veronica was thinking a very great deal about love.  A
dozen shynesses and intellectual barriers were being outflanked
or broken down in her mind. All the influences about her worked
with her own predisposition and against all the traditions of her
home and upbringing to deal with the facts of life in an
unabashed manner.  Ramage, by a hundred skilful hints had led her
to realize that the problem of her own life was inseparably
associated with, and indeed only one special case of, the
problems of any woman's life, and that the problem of a woman's
life is love.
<P>
"A young man comes into life asking how best he may place
himself," Ramage had said; "a woman comes into life thinking
instinctively how best she may give herself."
<P>
She noted that as a good saying, and it germinated and spread
tentacles of explanation through her brain. The biological
laboratory, perpetually viewing life as pairing and breeding and
selection, and again pairing and breeding, seemed only a
translated generalization of that assertion.  And all the talk of
the Miniver people and the Widgett people seemed always to be
like a ship in adverse weather on the lee shore of love.  "For
seven years," said Ann Veronica, "I have been trying to keep
myself from thinking about love. . . .
<P>
"I have been training myself to look askance at beautiful
things."
<P>
She gave herself permission now to look at this squarely. She
made herself a private declaration of liberty. "This is mere
nonsense, mere tongue-tied fear!" she said.  "This is the slavery
of the veiled life.  I might as well be at Morningside Park. 
This business of love is the supreme affair in life, it is the
woman's one event and crisis that makes up for all her other
restrictions, and I cower--as we all cower--with a blushing and
paralyzed mind until it overtakes me! . . .
<P>
"I'll be hanged if I do."
<P>
But she could not talk freely about love, she found, for all that
manumission.
<P>
Ramage seemed always fencing about the forbidden topic, probing
for openings, and she wondered why she did not give him them. 
But something instinctive prevented that, and with the finest
resolve not to be "silly" and prudish she found that whenever he
became at all bold in this matter she became severely scientific
and impersonal, almost entomological indeed, in her method; she
killed every remark as he made it and pinned it out for
examination.  In the biological laboratory that was their
invincible tone.  But she disapproved more and more of her own
mental austerity.  Here was an experienced man of the world, her
friend, who evidently took a great interest in this supreme topic
and was willing to give her the benefit of his experiences!  Why
should not she be at her ease with him?  Why should not she know
things?  It is hard enough anyhow for a human being to learn, she
decided, but it is a dozen times more difficult than it need be
because of all this locking of the lips and thoughts.
<P>
She contrived to break down the barriers of shyness at last in
one direction, and talked one night of love and the facts of love
with Miss Miniver.
<P>
But Miss Miniver was highly unsatisfactory.  She repeated phrases
of Mrs. Goopes's:  "Advanced people," she said, with an air of
great elucidation, "tend to GENERALIZE love.  'He prayeth best
who loveth best--all things both great and small.'  For my own
part I go about loving."
<P>
"Yes, but men;" said Ann Veronica, plunging; "don't you want the
love of men?"
<P>
For some seconds they remained silent, both shocked by this
question.
<P>
Miss Miniver looked over her glasses at her friend almost
balefully.  "NO!" she said, at last, with something in her voice
that reminded Ann Veronica of a sprung tennis-racket.
<P>
"I've been through all that," she went on, after a pause.
<P>
She spoke slowly.  "I have never yet met a man whose intellect I
could respect."
<P>
Ann Veronica looked at her thoughtfully for a moment, and decided
to persist on principle.
<P>
"But if you had?" she said.
<P>
"I can't imagine it," said Miss Miniver.  "And think, think"--her
voice sank--"of the horrible coarseness!"
<P>
"What coarseness?" said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"My dear Vee!"  Her voice became very low.  "Don't you know?"
<P>
"Oh! I know--"
<P>
"Well--"  Her face was an unaccustomed pink.
<P>
Ann Veronica ignored her friend's confusion.
<P>
"Don't we all rather humbug about the coarseness? All we women, I
mean," said she.  She decided to go on, after a momentary halt. 
"We pretend bodies are ugly.  Really they are the most beautiful
things in the world.  We pretend we never think of everything
that makes us what we are."
<P>
"No," cried Miss Miniver, almost vehemently.  "You are wrong!  I
did not think you thought such things. Bodies!  Bodies!  Horrible
things!  We are souls. Love lives on a higher plane.  We are not
animals.  If ever I did meet a man I could love, I should love
him" --her voice dropped again--"platonically."
<P>
She made her glasses glint.  "Absolutely platonically," she said.
<P>
"Soul to soul."
<P>
She turned her face to the fire, gripped her hands upon her
elbows, and drew her thin shoulders together in a shrug.  "Ugh!"
she said.
<P>
Ann Veronica watched her and wondered about her.
<P>
"We do not want the men," said Miss Miniver; "we do not want
them, with their sneers and loud laughter. Empty, silly, coarse
brutes.  Brutes!  They are the brute still with us!  Science some
day may teach us a way to do without them.  It is only the women
matter. It is not every sort of creature needs--these males. Some
have no males."
<P>
"There's green-fly," admitted Ann Veronica.  "And even then--"
<P>
The conversation hung for a thoughtful moment.
<P>
Ann Veronica readjusted her chin on her hand.  "I wonder which of
us is right," she said.  "I haven't a scrap--of this sort of
aversion."
<P>
"Tolstoy is so good about this," said Miss Miniver, regardless of
her friend's attitude.  "He sees through it all.  The Higher Life
and the Lower.  He sees men all defiled by coarse thoughts,
coarse ways of living cruelties.  Simply because they are
hardened by--by bestiality, and poisoned by the juices of meat
slain in anger and fermented drinks--fancy! drinks that have been
swarmed in by thousands and thousands of horrible little
bacteria!"
<P>
"It's yeast," said Ann Veronica--"a vegetable."
<P>
"It's all the same," said Miss Miniver.  "And then they are
swollen up and inflamed and drunken with matter.  They are
blinded to all fine and subtle things--they look at life with
bloodshot eyes and dilated nostrils.  They are arbitrary and
unjust and dogmatic and brutish and lustful."
<P>
"But do you really think men's minds are altered by the food they
eat?"
<P>
"I know it," said Miss Miniver.  "Experte credo. When I am
leading a true life, a pure and simple life free of all
stimulants and excitements, I think--I think --oh! with pellucid
clearness; but if I so much as take a mouthful of meat--or
anything--the mirror is all blurred."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
Then, arising she knew not how, like a new-born appetite, came a
craving in Ann Veronica for the sight and sound of beauty.
<P>
It was as if her aesthetic sense had become inflamed. Her mind
turned and accused itself of having been cold and hard.  She
began to look for beauty and discover it in unexpected aspects
and places.  Hitherto she had seen it chiefly in pictures and
other works of art, incidentally, and as a thing taken out of
life.  Now the sense of beauty was spreading to a multitude of
hitherto unsuspected aspects of the world about her.
<P>
The thought of beauty became an obsession.  It interwove with her
biological work.  She found herself asking more and more
curiously, "Why, on the principle of the survival of the fittest,
have I any sense of beauty at all?"  That enabled her to go on
thinking about beauty when it seemed to her right that she should
be thinking about biology.
<P>
She was very greatly exercised by the two systems of values--the
two series of explanations that her comparative anatomy on the
one hand and her sense of beauty on the other, set going in her
thoughts.  She could not make up her mind which was the finer,
more elemental thing, which gave its values to the other. Was it
that the struggle of things to survive produced as a sort of
necessary by-product these intense preferences and appreciations,
or was it that some mystical outer thing, some great force, drove
life beautyward, even in spite of expediency, regardless of
survival value and all the manifest discretions of life?  She
went to Capes with that riddle and put it to him very carefully
and clearly, and he talked well--he always talked at some length
when she took a difficulty to him--and sent her to a various
literature upon the markings of butterflies, the incomprehensible
elaboration and splendor of birds of Paradise and humming-birds'
plumes, the patterning of tigers, and a leopard's spots.  He was
interesting and inconclusive, and the original papers to which he
referred her discursive were at best only suggestive.  Afterward,
one afternoon, he hovered about her, and came and sat beside her
and talked of beauty and the riddle of beauty for some time.  He
displayed a quite unprofessional vein of mysticism in the matter.
He contrasted with Russell, whose intellectual methods were, so
to speak, sceptically dogmatic.  Their talk drifted to the beauty
of music, and they took that up again at tea-time.
<P>
But as the students sat about Miss Garvice's tea-pot and drank
tea or smoked cigarettes, the talk got away from Capes.  The
Scotchman informed Ann Veronica that your view of beauty
necessarily depended on your metaphysical premises, and the young
man with the Russell-like hair became anxious to distinguish
himself by telling the Japanese student that Western art was
symmetrical and Eastern art asymmetrical, and that among the
higher organisms the tendency was toward an external symmetry
veiling an internal want of balance.  Ann Veronica decided she
would have to go on with Capes another day, and, looking up,
discovered him sitting on a stool with his hands in his pockets
and his head a little on one side, regarding her with a
thoughtful expression.  She met his eye for a moment in curious
surprise.
<P>
He turned his eyes and stared at Miss Garvice like one who wakes
from a reverie, and then got up and strolled down the laboratory
toward his refuge, the preparation-room.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 7
<P>
<P>
Then one day a little thing happened that clothed itself in
significance.
<P>
She had been working upon a ribbon of microtome sections of the
developing salamander, and he came to see what she had made of
them.  She stood up and he sat down at the microscope, and for a
time he was busy scrutinizing one section after another.  She
looked down at him and saw that the sunlight was gleaming from
his cheeks, and that all over his cheeks was a fine golden down
of delicate hairs.  And at the sight something leaped within her.
<P>
Something changed for her.
<P>
She became aware of his presence as she had never been aware of
any human being in her life before.  She became aware of the
modelling of his ear, of the muscles of his neck and the textures
of the hair that came off his brow, the soft minute curve of
eyelid that she could just see beyond his brow; she perceived all
these familiar objects as though they were acutely beautiful
things. They WERE, she realized, acutely beautiful things.  Her
sense followed the shoulders under his coat, down to where his
flexible, sensitive-looking hand rested lightly upon the table. 
She felt him as something solid and strong and trustworthy beyond
measure.  The perception of him flooded her being.
<P>
He got up.  "Here's something rather good," he said, and with a
start and an effort she took his place at the microscope, while
he stood beside her and almost leaning over her.
<P>
She found she was trembling at his nearness and full of a
thrilling dread that he might touch her.  She pulled herself
together and put her eye to the eye-piece.
<P>
"You see the pointer?" he asked.
<P>
"I see the pointer," she said.
<P>
"It's like this," he said, and dragged a stool beside her and sat
down with his elbow four inches from hers and made a sketch. 
Then he got up and left her.
<P>
She had a feeling at his departure as of an immense cavity, of
something enormously gone; she could not tell whether it was
infinite regret or infinite relief. . . .
<P>
But now Ann Veronica knew what was the matter with her.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 8
<P>
<P>
And as she sat on her bed that night, musing and half-undressed,
she began to run one hand down her arm and scrutinize the soft
flow of muscle under her skin.  She thought of the marvellous
beauty of skin, and all the delightfulness of living texture.  Oh
the back of her arm she found the faintest down of hair in the
world. "Etherialized monkey," she said.  She held out her arm
straight before her, and turned her hand this way and that.
<P>
"Why should one pretend?" she whispered.  "Why should one
pretend?
<P>
"Think of all the beauty in the world that is covered up and
overlaid."
<P>
She glanced shyly at the mirror above her dressing-table, and
then about her at the furniture, as though it might penetrate to
the thoughts that peeped in her mind.
<P>
"I wonder," said Ann Veronica at last, "if I am beautiful?  I
wonder if I shall ever shine like a light, like a translucent
goddess?--
<P>
"I wonder--
<P>
"I suppose girls and women have prayed for this, have come to
this-- In Babylon, in Nineveh.
<P>
"Why shouldn't one face the facts of one's self?"
<P>
She stood up.  She posed herself before her mirror and surveyed
herself with gravely thoughtful, gravely critical, and yet
admiring eyes.  "And, after all, I am just one common person!"
<P>
She watched the throb of the arteries in the stem of her neck,
and put her hand at last gently and almost timidly to where her
heart beat beneath her breast.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 9
<P>
<P>
The realization that she was in love flooded Ann Veronica's mind,
and altered the quality of all its topics.
<P>
She began to think persistently of Capes, and it seemed to her
now that for some weeks at least she must have been thinking
persistently of him unawares.  She was surprised to find how
stored her mind was with impressions and memories of him, how
vividly she remembered his gestures and little things that he had
said.  It occurred to her that it was absurd and wrong to be so
continuously thinking of one engrossing topic, and she made a
strenuous effort to force her mind to other questions.
<P>
But it was extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant things could
restore her to the thought of Capes again. And when she went to
sleep, then always Capes became the novel and wonderful guest of
her dreams.
<P>
For a time it really seemed all-sufficient to her that she should
love.  That Capes should love her seemed beyond the compass of
her imagination.  Indeed, she did not want to think of him as
loving her.  She wanted to think of him as her beloved person, to
be near him and watch him, to have him going about, doing this
and that, saying this and that, unconscious of her, while she too
remained unconscious of herself.  To think of him as loving her
would make all that different.  Then he would turn his face to
her, and she would have to think of herself in his eyes.  She
would become defensive--what she did would be the thing that
mattered.  He would require things of her, and she would be
passionately concerned to meet his requirements.  Loving was
better than that.  Loving was self-forgetfulness, pure delighting
in another human being.  She felt that with Capes near to her she
would be content always to go on loving.
<P>
She went next day to the schools, and her world seemed all made
of happiness just worked up roughly into shapes and occasions and
duties.  She found she could do her microscope work all the
better for being in love. She winced when first she heard the
preparation-room door open and Capes came down the laboratory;
but when at last he reached her she was self-possessed.  She put
a stool for him at a little distance from her own, and after he
had seen the day's work he hesitated, and then plunged into a
resumption of their discussion about beauty.
<P>
"I think," he said, "I was a little too mystical about beauty the
other day."
<P>
"I like the mystical way," she said.
<P>
"Our business here is the right way.  I've been thinking, you
know-- I'm not sure that primarily the perception of beauty isn't
just intensity of feeling free from pain; intensity of perception
without any tissue destruction."
<P>
"I like the mystical way better," said Ann Veronica, and thought.
<P>
"A number of beautiful things are not intense."
<P>
"But delicacy, for example, may be intensely perceived."
<P>
"But why is one face beautiful and another not?" objected Ann
Veronica; "on your theory any two faces side by side in the
sunlight ought to be equally beautiful. One must get them with
exactly the same intensity."
<P>
He did not agree with that.  "I don't mean simply intensity of
sensation.  I said intensity of perception. You may perceive
harmony, proportion, rhythm, intensely.  They are things faint
and slight in themselves, as physical facts, but they are like
the detonator of a bomb: they let loose the explosive.  There's
the internal factor as well as the external. . . .  I don't know
if I express myself clearly.  I mean that the point is that
vividness of perception is the essential factor of beauty; but,
of course, vividness may be created by a whisper."
<P>
"That brings us back," said Ann Veronica, "to the mystery.  Why
should some things and not others open the deeps?"
<P>
"Well, that might, after all, be an outcome of selection --like
the preference for blue flowers, which are not nearly so bright
as yellow, of some insects."
<P>
"That doesn't explain sunsets."
<P>
"Not quite so easily as it explains an insect alighting on
colored paper.  But perhaps if people didn't like clear, bright,
healthy eyes--which is biologically understandable--they couldn't
like precious stones.  One thing may be a necessary collateral of
the others.  And, after all, a fine clear sky of bright colors is
the signal to come out of hiding and rejoice and go on with
life."
<P>
"H'm!" said Ann Veronica, and shook her head.
<P>
Capes smiled cheerfully with his eyes meeting hers. "I throw it
out in passing," he said.  "What I am after is that beauty isn't
a special inserted sort of thing; that's my idea.  It's just
life, pure life, life nascent, running clear and strong."
<P>
He stood up to go on to the next student.
<P>
"There's morbid beauty," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
"I wonder if there is!" said Capes, and paused, and then bent
down over the boy who wore his hair like Russell.
<P>
Ann Veronica surveyed his sloping back for a moment, and then
drew her microscope toward her.  Then for a time she sat very
still.  She felt that she had passed a difficult corner, and that
now she could go on talking with him again, just as she had been
used to do before she understood what was the matter with her. .
. .
<P>
She had one idea, she found, very clear in her mind--that she
would get a Research Scholarship, and so contrive another year in
the laboratory.
<P>
"Now I see what everything means," said Ann Veronica to herself;
and it really felt for some days as though the secret of the
universe, that had been wrapped and hidden from her so
obstinately, was at last altogether displayed.
