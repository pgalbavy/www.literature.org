<p>When I approached the office the next morning, little Ben Mayberry
was standing outside, smiling and expectant.</p>

<p>My heart was touched when I saw what pains his mother had taken
to put her boy in presentable shape. He had on a pair of coarse
shoes, carefully blacked, and a new, cheap hat replaced the dilapidated
one of the day before. He wore a short coat and a vest, which
must have served him as his Sunday suit for a long time, as they
were much too small for him.</p>

<p>But there was a cleanly, neat look about him which attracted
me at once. His face was as rosy as an apple, and his large, white
teeth were as sound as new silver dollars. His dark hair, which
was inclined to be curly, was cut short, and the ill-fitting clothes
could not conceal the symmetry of his growing figure.</p>

<p>"Well, Ben," said I cheerily, as I shook his hand, "I am glad
to see you are here on time. You are young, you know, but are
old enough to make a start. As I expect you to reach the top of
the ladder, I mean that you shall begin at the bottom round."</p>

<p>I am not sure he understood this figurative language, but I made
it clear to him the next minute.</p>

<p>"You are to be here every morning before seven o'clock, to sweep
out the office and make it ready for business. You must see that
all the spittoons are cleaned, that the ink wells at the desk
are provided with ink, that the pens are good enough for use (I
never yet have seen a public office where the writing facilities
were not wretched), abundance of blanks on hand, and that everything
is tidied up. In summer, you must wash off the ice and place it
in the cooler, and in winter, see that the fires are going and
the office comfortable at the time we go there for business. Can
you do it, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and glad to have the chance."</p>

<p>"This will give you some opportunity to attend the public school,
which, of course, you will take advantage of. Then, when you can,
you will begin to study telegraphy. I will see that you have every
chance, and, at the same time, I will give you a lift now and
then in your studies. This is the first step, Ben; in this country
anything is possible to the boy who has brains, pluck, and application.
Everything now depends on yourself; with the help of Heaven you
will succeed; if you fail, it will be your own fault. To-day you
start on your career, which will lead to success and happiness
or to failure and misery."</p>

<p>Ben listened respectfully to what I said, and seemed impressed
by my words. I took him inside the office, explained to him more
particularly his duties, gave him a key with which to enter in
the morning, and told him to be on hand at six o'clock on the
morrow, until which time he was excused. His wages were to be
two dollars a week, to begin from the day on which I engaged him.
Ben raised his hat, bade me good-day, and went home, and I am
sure there was no happier boy in Damietta than he.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that he attended to his duties faithfully
from the very first. He went to the public school when he could
gain the chance. I learned that he was a favorite there, on account
of his manliness and excellent scholarship. In conjunction with
the principal we arranged to give him private instruction at night,
so that during the day he could devote his energies to learning
telegraphy, in which he displayed great aptitude.</p>

<p>As I was manager of the office, it was in my power to advance
Ben as rapidly as circumstances warranted. He was given to understand
from the first that he would be assisted to the extent to which
he proved himself deserving, and no further. I did not intend
to spoil him by undue favors, nor did I allow him to see how much
I really thought of him. One of the surest means of ruining a
boy is by partiality and too rapid advancement; but I gave him
an encouraging word now and then, and took pains to let his mother
know that he was meeting my high expectations, and that he was
fully worthy of the hopes she entertained of him.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the glow which came into the pinched face
when I addressed her thus, nor the devout expression which overspread
her countenance at my liberal praise of her child.</p>

<p>"Ben has always been obedient to his father and mother. I have
never known him to swear or tell an untruth, and he never took
anything that was not his own&mdash;that is," the poor lady hastened
to add when she recalled the painful circumstance, "he never forgot
himself but once."</p>

<p>"He told me about it; few could blame him for that misstep; I
cannot think the distressing necessity will ever arise again.
Should Heaven spare his life he will become your staff, upon which
you can soon lean your whole weight."</p>

<p>She gave a faint sigh of happiness.</p>

<p>"My boy Ben has never brought a pang to his mother's heart."</p>

<p>Ah, my young friend, can your mother say that? When that dear
head is laid low, when those loving eyes shall be closed forever,
and the sweet voice is hushed in the tomb, will you be able to
say through your blinding tears:</p>

<p>"I never brought a pang to her heart!"</p>
