<p>WITH the clatter of the mowing-machine growing louder every moment,
Bobby Bobolink didn't stop to ask his wife to what place she would like
to move.
</p>
<p>"Follow me!" he cried. And rising quickly he headed for Cedar Swamp,
with Mrs. Bobolink and their five children trailing after him.
</p><p>It was the quickest move you ever saw--if you had only seen it! In a few
minutes they were settled in the swamp. And to Bobby Bobolink's relief
his wife declared that she liked their new home, because it was in a
good damp place and there was plenty of good water to drink.
</p><p>After moving to Cedar Swamp Bobby Bobolink often met a spry gentleman
who lived there. His name was Ferdinand Frog. And being a tailor, he
always took special notice of everybody's clothes. For himself Mr. Frog
preferred a dark green suit, somewhat spotted, and a white waistcoat.
And since he spent a great deal of his time in the water, his white
waistcoat always looked very spick-and-span. Yes! Ferdinand Frog was an
elegant person. And being somewhat shallow-brained, he was rather vain
of his appearance, and was likely to snicker at other people if their
clothes seemed to him the least bit odd.
</p><p>Now, Bobby Bobolink had noticed from the first that whenever he met Mr.
Frog he began to titter. But since Bobby was always ready with a laugh
himself, he supposed that Mr. Ferdinand Frog was merely bubbling over
with good spirits. So he used to pass the time of day with the gay
tailor and maybe sing a jolly song for him.
</p><p>And all the while Mr. Frog would grin widely and giggle.
</p><p>At last Bobby Bobolink noticed that Mr. Frog's bulging eyes were always
looking him up and down, from head to feet. And before long it dawned on
Bobby Bobolink that the tailor was not laughing <u>with</u> him.
</p><p>No! There was no doubt that Ferdinand Frog was laughing <u>at</u> him. And
there is a great difference between these two kinds of laughter.
</p><p>All at once Bobby Bobolink began to feel uncomfortable. And though he
had intended to sing another song for Mr. Frog, he did not do it.
Instead he said a hasty good-day and hurried home to his wife.
</p><p>"My dear," Bobby said to Mrs. Bobolink in an anxious voice, "do you see
anything queer about my appearance?"
</p><p>She looked him over carefully.
</p><p>"Why, no!" she answered at last. "Why do you ask me such an odd
question?"
</p><p>"Well," said Bobby, "Mr. Frog, the tailor, is always staring at me in
the oddest fashion and snickering as if he saw something that amused
him."
</p><p>"Don't worry about that simpleton!" Mrs. Bobolink cried. "You look a
great deal better than he does. And as for your voices, there's really
no comparison. Yours is one of the finest in Pleasant Valley; but
Ferdinand Frog's is nothing but a croak. It's even worse than old Mr.
Crow's!"
</p><p>After that Bobby Bobolink felt better. He knew that his wife was
particular. And if she said he looked all right then he was sure he
could have no cause to be uneasy.
</p><p>"It must be only Mr. Frog's queer eyes," he said to Mrs. Bobolink. "I've
been thinking that he saw something strange about me. But I must be
mistaken."
</p><p>Nevertheless, the very next time Bobby met Mr. Frog the tailor burst out
laughing, right in his face. And again his eyes rolled from Bobby's head
to his feet, and back again, in a most unpleasant leer.
</p><p>"What on earth do you see to laugh at?" Bobby Bobolink demanded.
</p><p>"Tee-hee!" Mr. Frog giggled. "Don't you know?"
</p><p>"No, I don't!" Bobby snapped.
</p><p>"It's your clothes!" Mr. Frog told him. "You've got them on upside
down!"
