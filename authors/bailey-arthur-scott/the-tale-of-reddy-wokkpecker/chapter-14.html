<p>If people snubbed Reddy Woodpecker he never cared.  When the members of
the Pleasant Valley Singing Society wouldn’t let him join them he only
smiled and said he intended to form a club of his own.
</p><p>As soon as the bird neighbors heard of Reddy’s plan they were all very
curious to know more about it.  But whenever anybody asked him questions
he had little to say.
</p><p>"You’ll learn all about it later," he told them.  "Please don’t bother
me now, for I’m a busy bird.  I’m starting my club."
</p><p>It was easy for Reddy Woodpecker to keep his secrets from such small
feathered folk as little Mr. Chippy.  But there was one that couldn’t
rest until he found out what he wanted to know.  This was old Mr. Crow.
He shot question after question at Reddy Woodpecker.  At last Reddy just
had to tell him something in order to gain a little peace.  Reddy knew
that Mr. Crow would leave him as soon as he had picked up a bit of news.
The old gentleman would hurry away to tell it to everybody in the
valley.
</p><p>"What’s your club going to be named?"  Whenever Mr. Crow talked with
Reddy Woodpecker that was his favorite question.  He asked it so many
times and so loudly that just to get rid of him Reddy finally told him.
</p><p>"I’m going to call my club ’The Redcaps,’" he said.
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow didn’t tarry an instant longer.  With an eager look in his
snapping black eyes he went flapping off on his broad wings, far down
the valley.
</p><p>Now, Mr. Crow was a fast worker.  In an hour’s time he had zigzagged
back again, having spread his bit of news far and wide.
</p><p>And when he had repeated it to the last neighbor he could find he
hurried to the orchard to ask Reddy Woodpecker more questions.
</p><p>The moment he found Reddy Mr. Crow began to put one question after
another so fast that you couldn’t have told where one ended and the next
one began.
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker pretended to be busier than ever.
</p><p>"I can’t stop now," he told Mr. Crow. "You’ll have to see my secretary."
</p><p>"Where is he?  Who is he?" Mr. Crow inquired hoarsely.
</p><p>"I can’t answer those questions," Reddy replied.
</p><p>"Why not?" demanded Mr. Crow.
</p><p>"Because I haven’t a secretary yet," Reddy explained.
</p><p>"Why should you have a secretary?" Mr. Crow asked him.
</p><p>"Why shouldn’t I?" Reddy retorted. "I guess, Mr. Crow, you don’t know
much about clubs.  I guess you don’t know that the president of a club
always has a secretary."
</p><p>"Are you president of the Redcaps?" Mr. Crow cried breathlessly.
</p><p>"Well—yes, I am!" Reddy admitted. "I didn’t mean to tell you that
to-day. But I can’t deny it."
</p><p>Mr. Crow was off like a shot.  You’d have thought he had just spied
Farmer Green with a gun in his hands.  His <u>caw, caw, caw</u> told
everybody in Pleasant Valley that he was going somewhere on important
business.
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker pulled a fat grub from its hiding place in the old
apple tree. He could still hear Mr. Crow squawking when the old
gentleman was half a mile away.  And Reddy smiled as he swallowed the
grub.
</p><p>"That’s better than putting the news in a newspaper," he said with a
chuckle.
