<p>Few situations are more trying than that of being followed at
night by what we suspect is an enemy. The furtive glances to the
rear show the foe too indistinctly for us to recognize him, and
the imagination pictures the swift, stealthy attack and the treacherous
blow against which it is impossible to guard.</p>

<p>There was little of this dread, however, in the case of our friends,
for they felt strong enough to take care of themselves. Moreover,
all three formed an instant suspicion of the identity of the man.</p>

<p>It was Felix Brush at the rear who first heard the faint footfalls,
and, peering into the gloom, saw the outlines of a man and beast
a few rods distant, coming steadily up the trail in the same direction
with himself. A few minutes later the halt was made and all eyes
were turned toward the point whence the man was approaching. He
must have noticed the stoppage, but he came straight on until
he joined the group.</p>

<p>"Howdy, pards," was his greeting.</p>

<p>"I thought it was you, Vose," said the captain, sharply; "what
do you mean by following us?"</p>

<p>"What right have you to get in front of me? Don't I have to make
a trip to Sacramento three or four times each year?"</p>

<p>"But you are not accustomed to start in the night time."</p>

<p>"And I never knowed it was your custom to leave New Constantinople
in the middle of the night; leastways I never knowed you to do
it afore."</p>

<p>"We have important business," added the captain brusquely, uncertain
as yet whether he ought to be displeased or angered by the intrusion
of Adams.</p>

<p>"So have I."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Your good."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you; explain yourself."</p>

<p>"There ain't one of you three that knows the way through the
mountains, and if you undertook it alone, it would take you three
months to reach Sacramento."</p>

<p>This was a new and striking view of the situation, but the parson
said:</p>

<p>"Each of us has been over it before."</p>

<p>"Sartinly, but one trip nor half a dozen ain't enough. You lost
your way the first hour in Dead Man's Gulch; if you hadn't done
so, it would have took me a blamed sight longer to find you; there
are half a dozen other places in the mountains ten times worse
than the one where you flew the track. Howsumever, if you don't
want me, I'll go back."</p>

<p>And Vose Adams, as if his dignity had received a mortal hurt,
began turning his mule around.</p>

<p>"Hold on," interposed Captain Dawson; "you have put things in
their true light; we are very glad to have you with us."</p>

<p>"That makes it all right," was the cheery response of the good
natured Vose; "I never like to push myself where I ain't wanted,
but as you seem glad to see me, after having the thing explained,
we won't say nothing more about it. Howsumever, I may add that
I obsarved you started in such a hurry that I thought it warn't
likely you fetched any vittles with you, so I made up a lunch
and brought it with me, being as you may not always have time
to spare to shoot game."</p>

<p>The chilliness of Vose Adams' greeting changed to the warmest
welcome. He had shown more thoughtfulness than any of them, and
his knowledge of the perilous route through the mountains was
beyond value. Indeed, it looked as if it was to prove the deciding
factor in the problem.</p>

<p>"Do you know our business, Vose?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I knowed it the minute I seen you sneaking off like shadows
toward the trail. I hurried to my cabin, got a lot of cold meat
and bread together and then hunted up Hercules, my boss mule.
He isn't very handsome, but he has a fine voice and has been through
these mountains so many times that he knows the right road as
well as me. I knowed you would travel fast and didn't expect to
overhaul you afore morning, but you went past the right turn and
that give me a chance to catch up sooner."</p>

<p>"But how was it you suspected our errand?" persisted the captain.</p>

<p>"How could I help it? What else could it be? I seen the miss
and the leftenant start for Sacramento, and being as you took
the same course it was plain that you was going there too, if
you didn't overtake 'em first."</p>

<p>"You saw them start!" thundered the father of Nellie Dawson;
"why didn't you hurry off to me with the news?"</p>

<p>"Why should I hurry off to you with the news?" coolly asked Vose
Adams; "it wasn't the first time I had seen the two ride in that
direction; sometimes she was with you, or with the parson or Ruggles,
and once or twice with me. Would you have thought there was anything
wrong if you had seen them?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," replied the captain, seeing the injustice
of his words; "but I have been so wrought up by what has occurred
that I can hardly think clearly. I ask your pardon for my hasty
words."</p>

<p>"You needn't do that, for I see how bad you feel and I'm sorry
for you."</p>

<p>"When was it they left?"</p>

<p>"Early this afternoon."</p>

<p>"There was no one with them of course?"</p>

<p>"Nobody except that big dog they call Timon; he was frolicking
'round the horses, as if he enjoyed it as much as them."</p>

<p>Every atom of news was painful, and yet the afflicted father
could not restrain himself from asking questions of no importance.</p>

<p>"About what hour do you think it was when they left?"</p>

<p>"It must have been near two o'clock when the leftenant fetched
up his horse and the pony belonging to the young lady. She must
have been expectin' him, for she come right out of the house,
without keeping him waitin' a minute. He helped her into the saddle,
while they talked and laughed as happy as could be."</p>

<p>This was wormwood and gall to the parent, but he did not spare
himself.</p>

<p>"Did you overhear anything said by them?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have considered it proper to listen, even if they
hadn't been so far off I couldn't catch a word that passed atween
'em."</p>

<p>"Was there anything in their actions to show they intended to
take a longer ride than usual?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how there could be," replied the puzzled Adams,
while Parson Brush, understanding what the distraught captain
meant, explained:</p>

<p>"Was there anything in their appearance which suggested that
they meant to take anything more than an ordinary gallop?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think of it at the time, but I can see now there was.
Each of them had what seemed to be extra clothing and perhaps
they had food, though I couldn't make sure of that. You know there
has been something in the sky that looked like a coming storm,
and I thought it was on that account that the clothing was took
along. Then, as the leftenant had knocked off work, it might be
he was not feeling very well."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel made that very excuse for leaving me," bitterly
commented Captain Dawson, "but he wouldn't have taken the clothing
as part of the same design for there was no need of anything of
the kind. They laid their plans carefully and everything joined
to make it as easy as possible."</p>

<p>"Your thoughts were precisely what ours would have been," said
the parson, drawn toward the messenger unjustly accused by the
captain in the tumult of his grief;" if we had seen the two start,
we should have believed it was for one of the usual gallops which
the young lady is so fond of taking; but, Vose, if we would have
certainly gone astray in the mountains, without your guidance,
how will it be with them, when she has never been over the trail
and he has ridden over it but once?"</p>

<p>"They are sure to have a tough time of it which will make it
all the harder for us."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Some good luck may lead them right; more than likely, howsumever,
they'll get all wrong; therefore, if we stick to the path we may
pass 'em a half dozen times. You see it's the blamed onsartinty
of the whole bus'ness."</p>

<p>"I would not question your wisdom on such matters, Vose, but
when I remember that each of them is riding a horse, and that
the two must leave traces behind them, I cannot apprehend that
we shall go very far astray in our pursuit. The most likely trouble
as it seems to me is that they will travel so fast that it will
be almost impossible to overtake them."</p>

<p>"If they can manage to keep to the trail, it is going to be hard
work to come up with them. You haven't forgot that when I'm pushing
through the mountains I sometimes have to hunt a new trail altogether."</p>

<p>"That is due to the trouble with Indians?"</p>

<p>"Precisely; sometimes it's a long, roundabout course that I have
to take, which may keep me off the main course for a couple of
days, or it may be for only a part of the day, but Injins is something
that you must count on every time."</p>

<p>"And they are as likely to meet them as we?"</p>

<p>"More so, 'cause they're just ahead of you. Oh, it was the biggest
piece of tomfoolery ever heard of for them to start on such a
journey, but what are you to expect of two young persons dead
in love with each other?"</p>

<p>This was not the kind of talk that was pleasing to the father,
and he became morosely silent. It was equally repugnant to Ruggles
and the parson to hear Nellie Dawson referred to as being in love
with the execrated officer. Ruggles was grim and mute, and the
parson deftly drew the conversation in another direction.</p>

<p>"I would like to ask you, Vose, how it was that Lieutenant Russell
did not take the other horses with him, so as to make it impossible
for anything in the nature of pursuit?"</p>

<p>"There might be two reasons; he may have thought it would be
mean to hit you below the belt like that; he was too honorable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It warn't anything like <em>that</em>," fiercely interrupted
Ruggles.</p>

<p>"Then it must have been that if he had took all the animals with
him, even though they was a considerable way down the gulch, the
thing would have been noticed by others, who would have wanted
to know what it meant."</p>

<p>"No doubt you have struck the right reason. Had the start been
in the night time, he would have made sure that not even the mules
were left for us. But, Vose," added the parson gravely, "we would
be much better pleased if when you referred to the lieutenant,
you said nothing about 'honor.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am as much down on him as any of you," airily responded
Vose; "and, if I git the chance to draw bead on him, I'll do it
quicker'n lightning. Fact is, the hope of having that same heavenly
privilege was as strong a rope in pulling me up the trail after
you as was the wish to keep you folks from gettin' lost. But,
pards, Hercules is rested and I guess likely your animals are
the same, so let's be moving."</p>

<p>Although Captain Dawson had been silent during the last few minutes,
he did not allow a word to escape him. He knew Vose Adams was
talkative at times, due perhaps to his enjoyment of company, after
being forced to spend weeks without exchanging a word with any
one of his kind, but there was no overestimating his value, because
of his knowledge of the long, dangerous route through the mountains.
When, therefore, the party were about to move on, the captain
said:</p>

<p>"Vose, from this time forward you are the guide; the place for
you is at the head; you will oblige me by taking the lead."</p>

<p>Vose accepted the post of honor, which was also the one of peril,
for it is the man in his position whose life hangs in the balance
when Indians are concerned. But there was no hesitancy on his
part, though he was well aware of the additional risks he incurred.</p>

<p>"There's one good thing I can tell you," he said, just before
they started.</p>

<p>They looked inquiringly at him and he explained:</p>

<p>"The hardest part of the climbing is over,&mdash;that is for the time,"
he hastened to add, seeing that he was not understood; "you'll
have plenty more of it before we see Sacramento, but I mean that
we have struck the highest part of the trail, and it will be a
good while before there's any more climbing to do."</p>

<p>"That is good news," said Ruggles heartily, "for it has been
mighty tough on the animals; I 'spose too, the trail is smoother."</p>

<p>Adams laughed.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say it's rougher."</p>

<p>Ruggles muttered impatiently, but the four took up the task,
Adams in the lead, with the rest stringing after him in Indian
file. The declaration of Vose was verified sooner than was expected.
While the mule was so sure-footed that he seemed to meet with
no difficulty, it was excessively trying to the horses, who stumbled
and recovered themselves so often that Captain Dawson began to
fear one or more of them would go lame. Still in his anxiety to
get forward, he repressed his fears, hoping that there would be
some improvement and cheering himself with the belief that since
all had gone well for so long, it would continue on the same line.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Once, however, his horse made such an abrupt stumble that the
captain narrowly saved himself from being unseated. On the impulse
of the moment he called to Adams in advance:</p>

<p>"Vose, I am afraid this won't do!"</p>

<p>The leader did not look around and acted as if he had not heard
him.</p>

<p>"I say, Vose, isn't it better that we should wait till our horses
can see the way?"</p>

<p>Since the leader took no notice of this demand, the captain concluded
his fears were groundless and said no more.</p>

<p>"If he thinks it safe for us to keep on, I shall not oppose."</p>

<p>But Captain Dawson might have opposed, had he known the truth,
for, strange as it may seem, Vose Adams did not hear the words
addressed to him, because he was asleep on the back of his mule
Hercules, as he had been many a time while riding over the lonely
trail. In truth, there was some foundation for his declaration
that he could sleep more soundly on the back of his animal than
while wrapped up in his blanket in some fissure among the rocks.
Fortunately for him, however, these naps were of short duration,
and, while indulging in them, he relied upon his animal, which
had acquired a wonderful quickness in detecting danger. The slightest
lagging in his gait, a halt, a turning to one side or a whinny
was sufficient to bring back on the instant the wandering senses
of the rider. In the present instance his slumber was not interrupted
until Hercules, seeing exactly where he was, dropped his walk
to a lagging gait.</p>

<p>On the very second Vose Adams opened his eyes. So naturally that
no one suspected anything, he checked his animal and looked around.</p>

<p>"Pards, we've reached a ticklish spot, and it's for you to say
whether we shall wait for daylight afore trying it."</p>

<p>"What is its nature?" asked the captain, as he and the two behind
him also reined up their animals.</p>

<p>"The trail winds through these peaks in front, and instead of
being like that we've been riding over all along, keeps close
to the side of the mountain. On the right is the solid rock, and
on the left it slopes down for I don't know how many hundred feet,
afore it strikes bottom. Once started down that slide, you'll
never stop till you hit the rocks below like that mass of stone
that tumbled over in front of you."</p>

<p>"How wide is the path?" asked the parson.</p>

<p>"There's more than a mile where it isn't wide enough for two
of us to ride abreast, and there are plenty of places where a
horse has got to step mighty careful to save himself. Hercules
knows how to do it, for he larned long ago, but I have my doubts
about your hosses."</p>

<p>"It might have been better after all if we had brought the mules,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, for Hercules is the only one that knows how
to git over such places."</p>

<p>"How do the others manage it?"</p>

<p>"They've never tried it in the night time; that's what I'm talking
'bout."</p>

<p>Adams's description enabled the others to recall the place. It
was all that had been pictured and they might well pause before
assuming the fearful risk. One reason for wishing to press forward
was the knowledge that at the termination of the dangerous stretch,
the trail was so smooth and even that for a long distance it would
be easy to keep their animals at a gallop, while still further
the peril appeared again.</p>

<p>Captain Dawson once more struck a match and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Half-past three; in two hours it will begin to grow light; if
no accident happens we shall be at the end of the ugly piece of
ground by that time, where the traveling is good. It is a pity
to lose the opportunity, but I will leave it to you, parson and
Ruggles; what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Our horses have been pushed pretty hard, but they are in good
condition. I hate to remain idle."</p>

<p>"Then you favor going ahead?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And you, Ruggles?"</p>

<p>"I feel the same way."</p>

<p>"That settles it; lead on, Vose."</p>

<p>"I'm just as well suited, but keep your wits about you," was
the warning of the leader, whose mule instantly responded, stretching
his neck forward and downward and occasionally snuffing the ground,
as if he depended on his sense of smell more than that of hearing.</p>

<p>The task was a nerve-wrenching one, and more than once each of
the three regretted their haste in not waiting for daylight; but,
having started, there was no turning back. To attempt to wheel
about, in order to retrace their steps, was more perilous than
to push on, while to stand still was hardly less dangerous.</p>

<p>The moonlight gave such slight help that the four depended almost
wholly upon the instinct of their animals. Hercules never faltered,
but advanced with the slow, plodding, undeviating certainty of
those of his kind who thread their way through the treacherous
passes of the Alps. Once his hind hoof struck a stone which went
bounding down the precipice on his left, until at the end of what
seemed several minutes, it lay still at the bottom. Neither animal
nor rider showed the least fear, for in truth both were accustomed
to little slips like that.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if this isn't the most ticklish business that I
ever attempted," muttered Captain Dawson; "I never had anything
like it in the army; it reminds me of scouting between the lines,
when you expect every second a bullet from a sharpshooter&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant his horse stepped on a round, loose stone which
turned so quickly that before he could recover himself the hoof
followed the stone over the edge of the precipice. The horse snorted
and struggled desperately, and the brave rider felt an electric
shock thrill through him from head to foot, for there was one
moment when he believed nothing could save them from the most
frightful of deaths.</p>

<p>The left hind leg had gone over the rocky shelf, which at that
point was very narrow, and the hoof was furiously beating vacancy
in the despairing effort to find something upon which to rest
itself. His body sagged downward and the rider held his breath.</p>

<p>"Steady, my boy!" he called, and with rare presence of mind allowed
the rein to lie free so as not to disconcert the steed.</p>

<p>The tremendous struggle of the intelligent animal prevailed and
with a snort he recovered his balance and all four feet stood
upon firm support.</p>

<p>"That was a close call," observed the parson, whose heart was
in his mouth, while the brief fight for life was going on.</p>

<p>"It was so close that it couldn't have been any closer," coolly
commented the captain, fully himself again.</p>
