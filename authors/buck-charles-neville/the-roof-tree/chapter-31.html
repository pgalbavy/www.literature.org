<p>Strangely enough it was as though the old man's capacity for being
shocked or infuriated had been exhausted. There was no roar of maddened
wrath or denunciation of denial now. Never had Sim seen on a human face
such a despair of stricken grief. Hump Doane only passed an open palm
across his forehead. Somehow this hideous recital, which had made him an
old man in the space of a few minutes, blasting him like a thunder bolt,
could not be seriously doubted. It was not allegation but revelation.
</p>
<p>Pete was young and impressionable. He was clay upon the wheel of Bas
Rowlett's domination, and of late he had been much away from home.
</p><p>The father tried to straighten his twisted shoulders and his warped
back. He turned his eyes to the west where the fires of sunset were
crimson and purple, then he spoke again in a manner of recovered and
hard-held self-control.
</p><p>"Ef these things ye tells me be true," he said, "I hev need ter know 'em
an' I'm beholden ter ye. Ef they're false ye've done struck me a blow I
kain't nuver fergive, an' I don't see how you an' me kin both go on
livin'. I aims ter find out fer myself, an' meanwhile--I'll keep my
pledge ter ye." He paused, then the leader triumphed over the stricken
individual.
</p><p>"Keep right on goin' ter every meetin' ther riders holds," he directed,
quietly. "Don't suffer 'em ter suspicion no falsity."
</p><p>But when Sim had left him Hump Doane stood there while the sunset faded,
while the afterglow livened and died, while the cold twilight settled.
</p><p>He was thinking of the son he loved and despised, of the soft human
metal that had been hammered into debauchery by this other man whom he
had trusted.
</p><p>He was acknowledging, too, that if the riders numbered among their
secret adherents such men as Bas Rowlett and his own boy, his fight was
upon a poison that had struck deeper and more malignantly into the
arteries of the community than he had heretofore dreamed.
</p><p>He must talk with Parish Thornton, whose strength and judgment could be
trusted. He would see him to-night.
</p><p>But at that point he halted. As yet he could not reveal his
unsubstantiated information to another. A pledge of sacredly observed
confidence had been the price of his learning these things--and over
there at the Thornton house a baby was expected before long. It would be
both wise and considerate to defer the interview that must of necessity
bring the whole crisis to violent issue until the young father's
thoughts were less personally involved. It was a time to make haste
slowly. Old Hump Doane laughed bitterly. He was a father himself, and
to-night he had learned how the heart of a parent can be battered.
</p><p>But before he went to his bed he had talked with his son, while his son
sat cowering. It had been a stormy interview during which Pete had
denied, expostulated, and at the end broken down in confession, and when
Hump Doane rose he had abandoned that slender shred of hope to which, in
the teeth of conviction, he had been clinging, that his boy might still
be able to clear himself.
</p><p>"Ye've done lied ter me, an' ye've done broke my heart," declared the
hunchback, slowly, "but ye've done confessed--an' I'm too damn weak ter
turn ye over ter ther law like my duty demands. Don't nuver go ter no
other meetin', an' ef they questions why ye don't come, tell 'em ter ask
me! An' now"--the old man crumpled forward and buried his great head in
his knotted hands--"an' now git outen my sight fer a spell, fer I kain't
endure ther sight of ye!"
</p><p>But when he rode abroad the next day no man suspected the cataclysm
which had shattered Hump Doane's world into a chaos of irretrievable
wreck.
</p><p>A closer guard of caution than ever before he set upon his speech and
bearing, while he sought to run down those devastating truths that had
come to him with such unwelcome illumination.
</p><hr/>
<p>In those days of first bud and leaf Dorothy Thornton looked out of her
window with a psychological anxiety. If the first hint of life that came
to the great tree were diseased or marked with blight, it would be an
omen of ill under which she did not see how she could face her hour, and
with fevered eyes she searched the gray branches where the sap was
rising and studied the earliest tinge of green.
</p><p>"Ef harm hed done come ter hit," she argued with herself, "hit would
show, by this time, in them leetle buds an' tossels," but she was not
satisfied, and reaching through the attic window she broke off from day
to day bits of twig to see whether the vitality of rising sap or the
brittleness of death proclaimed itself in the wood.
</p><p>Slowly, under soft air and rain, the buds broke into tiny spears, too
small and tender, it seemed to her, to live against the unkind touch of
harsh winds, and the rudimentary filaments spread and grew into leaves.
</p><p>But the time that seemed to Dorothy to lag so interminably was passing,
and the veils of misty green that had scarcely showed through the
forest grays were growing to an emerald vividness. Waxen masses of
laurel were filling out and flushing with the pink of blossom. The
heavy-fragranced bloom of the locust drooped over those upturned
chalices of pink, and the black walnut was gaunt no more, but as
brightly and lustily youthful as a troubador whom age had never touched.
</p><p>Warm with swelling life and full throated with bird music the beginnings
of summer came to the hills, and the hills forgot their grimness.
</p><p>But Old Jim Rowlett, over there in his house, was failing fast, men
said. He prattled childishly, and his talon-like hands were pitifully
palsied. He would scarcely see another spring, and in the fight that was
coming his wise old tongue would no longer be available for counsel. So
toward the younger and more robust influence of Parish Thornton his
adherents turned in his stead.
</p><p>In those places where secret night sessions were held were the stir of
preparation and the talk of punishing a traitor--for young Pete had
deserted the cause, and the plotters were divided in sentiment. A
majority advocated striking with stunning suddenness toward the major
purpose and ignoring the disaffection of the one young renegade, but a
fiercer minority was for making him an example, and cool counsels were
being taxed.
</p><p>To Dorothy Thornton's eyes contentment had returned because gay and
hopeful young flags of green flew from every twig of the tree of augury,
and in her deep pupils dwelt the serene sweetness that broods on
thoughts of approaching motherhood.
</p><p>Then one morning before dawn Uncle Jase Burrell and a neighbour woman,
versed in the homely practises of the midwife, came to the room where
Parish Thornton sat with tightly clenched hands before the ruddy
hearth.
</p><p>"He's done been borned," said Uncle Jase, cheerily; "he's hale an'
survigrous an' sassy--an' he's a boy."
</p><p>Sim Squires had not gone home that night, and now he rose from his chair
and picked up his hat. "I reckon I'll be farin' on," he announced,
"hit's all over now but ther shoutin'." At the door, though, he turned
back and from his coat pocket drew a roll of sheafed paper bound in a
limp cloth.
</p><p>"I found this hyar thing layin' behind a barrel up thar in ther attic,"
he lied, as he restored the lost journal of the revolutionary
ancestress. "I 'lowed hit mout be somethin' ye prized."
</p><hr/>
<p>One night, when June had come to her full-bosomed richness, young Pete
Doane did not return to his father's house and the old hunchback's face
darkened anxiously.
</p><p>The warm night was a blue and moonlit glory of summer tranquillity and
from the creek bottom came the full-throated chorus of the frogs. Back
in the dark timber sounded the plaintive sweetness of the whippoorwills,
and from everywhere drifted an intangible blending of fragrances.
</p><p>But Hump sat alone and morose in the house where no one dwelt but
himself and his son--save the neighbour woman who came in the daytime to
cook and clean house for the widower. He sat there until midnight had
passed and the moon was riding low to the west; he was still sitting in
the darkness that comes before dawn, and young Pete had not yet come.
Then when even June could not make gracious that dismal hour that brings
fog and reek before the first gray streaks the east, the old man heard a
voice outside his door and rose heavily to answer it.
</p><p>He was a marked man, and should not have been so incautious, but in
these days death held no threat for Hump Doane. It was life that brought
him torture.
</p><p>So he ignored those precepts of wariness which had been taught him by
years of experience, and when he stood unarmed in the doorway, against a
background of pale lamplight, he felt the thrust of a rifle muzzle
against his ribs, and heard a disguised voice ordering, "Come with us."
</p><p>Hump did not flinch or give back. Neither did he obey. Instead, he
laughed with a hollow callousness and replied, "Shoot ef ye've a mind
ter. I hain't goin' ter stir a step ter foller ye."
</p><p>But masked men closed in and caught his misshapen elbows, and the voice
that had first accosted him went on in the level tones of its disguise:
</p><p>"We don't aim ter harm ye, Hump; leastways not yit--but we aims ter show
ye somethin' we've brought ye fer a gift."
</p><p>They led him, too dull and apathetic of spirit to resist, too
indifferent of any consequence to protest, out and across his own
fog-wrapped yard and down to the sledge-trail road.
</p><p>There in the bleak obscurity of blackness his eyes could make out a
squad of silent figures, but nothing more.
</p><p>"Ye kain't rightly see hit yit, Hump," announced the spokesman, "but
thar's a fodder-sledge standin' thar at ther aidge of ther road--an' on
hit thar's somethin' thet b'longs ter ye. Hyar's a pine faggot thet's
soaked with kerosene--an' hyar's matches ter light hit with--but--on
pain of death--wait twell we've done gone away."
</p><p>Into the heavy indifference of the old man's mood flashed a sickening
shaft of dread. He took the torch and the matches, and then with a
cowardice that was alien to his character he stood trembling like a
frightened child, while the dark figures disappeared as though they had
melted.
</p><p>Hump Doane was afraid to kindle his torch, not afraid because of any
threat to himself, but terrified for what he might see.
</p><p>Then he braced himself, and with his back turned, struck the match and
saw the guttering flames leap greedily upon the oiled pine splinter.
</p><p>Slowly he wheeled, and his eyes fell on the illuminated sledge--his own
sledge stolen from his barn--and there stretched lifeless, and
shamefully marked with the defacement of the hangman's rope, lay what
was left of his son.
</p><p>Old Hump Doane, who had never stepped aside from any danger, who had
never known tears since babyhood, stood for a moment gulping, then the
light dropped from his hand and the agony of his shriek went quavering
across the silent hills and reëchoed in the woods.
</p><p>The pine splinter burned out in the wet grass and old Hump lay beside it
insensible, but after a while he awakened out of that merciful sleep and
crawled on his hands and knees over to where the sledge stood, and he
knelt there with his face buried on the lifeless breast.
</p><p>"God fergive me," he murmured with a strangled voice. "He didn't nuver
hev no mammy ter raise him up aright. I reckon I failed him when he
needed me most--but Bas Rowlett's accountable ter <u>me</u>!"
</p><p>When the neighbour woman came the next morning to prepare breakfast she
fled screaming away from the gruesome sight that met her eyes: the sight
of a dead man lying on a sledge, and a hunchback, who seemed dead, too,
stretched unconscious across the body. It was so that men found them
later, and carried them in, and it would have been more merciful had
Hump Doane been as lifeless as he seemed instead of coming back to the
ordeal he must face.
</p><hr/>
<p>Through a community stunned and appalled into breathlessness the news
ran like quicksilver, and the easy-pacing mule from Parish Thornton's
barn was lathered with sweat as the young man called upon it to
annihilate time and space over the broken ways between his house and
that of his stricken friend.
</p><p>At Hump Doane's stile Thornton flung himself out of his saddle and
paused for no word with those neighbours who stood gathered about the
dooryard. He heard the whine of a saw and the pounding of a hammer off
somewhere to the rear, and knew that volunteer and amateur undertakers
were fashioning a coffin--but he hurled himself like a human hurricane
across the threshold and demanded briefly: "War's Hump at?"
</p><p>The room was dim and murky at its corners, but through the two doors
poured a flood of morning light, and into its shaft projected an
unhinged shutter supported on two saw-horses, with a sheeted burden upon
it. As his eyes became more accustomed to the gloom beyond the room's
centre, Parish could make out the hunched figure that sat at the head of
the body, still mercifully wrapped in something like lethargy and too
numbed for full acuteness of feeling.
</p><p>Other figures to the number of two or three moved as silently as dark
wraiths about the place, but when Parish entered they drifted out,
leaving him alone with his friend, and one of the doors closed upon
their going.
</p><p>Then the lightnings of outraged wrath that seemed to crackle in the
young clansman's eyes stilled themselves and altered into something like
tenderness as he moved with catlike softness of footfall to where the
elder man sat, and let a hand fall on his malformed shoulder.
</p><p>"Hump," he said, briefly, "my heart's plum sufferin' fer ye. I jest
heared of hit."
</p><p>Hump Doane stirred and looked stupidly at him for a space, then with
laboured slowness he came to his feet, and his only answer was the
eloquent gesture with which one hand swept toward the dead body.
</p><p>A stupefaction of grief had held him since they had brought him in this
morning from the road where they had found him, and thought had moved so
haltingly that it had scarcely been thought at all.
</p><p>But now the vitalizing light of sympathy and outrage in those other eyes
seemed to rouse him out of his long coma with an awakening like that
which comes after ether.
</p><p>As gray dawn quickens gradually out of darkness, a numbed indignation in
his pupils began to liven into unquenchable wrath.
</p><p>"I hain't been able ter talk ... ter these hyar kindly neighbours of
mine...." he faltered, "but somehow, I believes I kin with <u>you</u>."
</p><p>"I'm hyar ter s'arve ye, howsoever I kin, Hump," Parish assured him. "Ef
ye was my own father I couldn't love ye better."
</p><p>Hump Doane held out a crumpled paper that had been crushed in his taut
hand, and Thornton stepping to the light smoothed it and read, pencilled
in roughly printed characters, "A warning to all traitors."
</p><p>"Hit war pinned on him...." explained the father. "Ther riders done
hit ... <u>he'd</u> done jined 'em ... an' he quit."
</p><p>Parish Thornton stood with the light full on his face and the paper
grasped in his hand. The angle of his clean-cut jaw seemed to harden
from the plastic texture of flesh to the hardness of granite, and in his
narrowed eyes spurted jets of those blue-and-white fires that hold
intensest heat.
</p><p>"I always aimed ter raise him up in godly ways," went on the father with
self-accusing misery, "but I war a hard man, an' I never gentled him
none. I reckon I driv him ter others ... thet debauched an' ruint him."
</p><p>He had been, to that point, the man conscious only of his hurt, but now
his face became contorted and livid with a sudden hurricane of rage.
</p><p>"But them thet hanged him," he cried out in abrupt violence, "vile es
they war ... they warn't nothin' ter ther man thet made a dupe out of
him ... ther man thet egged them on.... Bas Rowlett's accountable ter
me--an' afore ther sun sets I aims ter stand over his dead body!"
</p><p>Parish Thornton flinched at the name. He had turned his face toward the
sheeted figure, but now he wheeled back, crouching and straightening
with the spasmodic quickness of a boxer who sidesteps a blow.
</p><p>"Bas Rowlett!" he echoed in a low but deadly tensity of voice. "Steady
yoreself, man, an' construe what ye means!"
</p><p>Hump Doane had shaken off his torpor now and stood trembling under all
the furies of repressed years. His words came in a torrent of vehemence
that could not be stemmed, and they mounted like gathering winds.
</p><p>"I've preached peace day in an' day out.... I've striven ter keep
hit ... an' I knows I did aright ... but this day I'm goin' ter stultify
myself an' kill a man ... an' when I finishes him, I'm going ter keep
right on till I'm either kilt myself or gits all them thet's accountable
fer <u>this</u>!" He paused, breathing in gasps, then rushed on again:
"I trusted Bas Rowlett ... I believed in him ... some weeks back I
l'arned some things erbout him thet shocked me sore, but still I held
my hand ... waitin' ter counsel with <u>you</u> atter yore baby hed been
borned."
</p><p>"What war hit ye l'arned, Hump?" The younger man's voice was almost
inaudibly low, and the answer came like volley-firing with words.
</p><p>"Hit war Bas thet hired ye laywayed.... Hit war Bas thet egged Sam
Opdyke on ter kill ye.... Hit war Bas thet sent word over inter Virginny
ter betray ye ter ther law.... Hit war Bas thet shot through old Jim's
hat ter make a false appearance an' foment strife.... Hit war Bas thet
stirred men up ter organizin' ther riders ... an' used my boy fer a
catspaw!"
</p><p>"Listen, man!" Parish Thornton was breathing his words through lips that
scarcely moved as he bent forward with the tautness of a coiled spring.
"I knowed Bas Rowlett hired me shot ... but we'd done pledged ourselves
ter settle thet betwixt us.... I held my hand because of ther oath I
give ye when we made ther truce ... but these other things, I hain't
nuver even dremp' of ther like afore. Does ye know aught more of him?"
</p><p>"I knows thet whilst ye war away in Virginny he went over an' sought ter
make love ter yore wife ... an' she come nigh killin' him fer hit ...
but she feared fer bloodshed ef she bore thet tale ter <u>you</u>."
</p><p>The old man paused, and Parish Thornton made no answer in words, but
between his lips the breath ran out with the hiss of sobbing waters.
</p><p>"I kain't prove none of them things in law," went on Hump, and his eyes
travelled back to the hideous fascination of the sheeted body, "yit I
knows, in my heart, every one of 'em's true--an' thet's enough fer me.
Now I'm goin' ter be my own law!"
</p><p>The cripple turned and walked unsteadily to the corner of the room, and
from its place behind a calico curtain he took out a repeating rifle.
</p><p>"Thar's my co'te of jestice," he declared, and his voice trembled as
with hunger and thirst.
</p><p>But Parish Thornton had thrown back his head and unaccountably he
laughed as he laid on the other's arm fingers that closed slowly into a
grip of steel and rawhide.
</p><p>"Hump," he said, "hit would be a turrible pity fer us ter quarrel--but I
don't aim ter be robbed, even by <u>you</u>! Thet man belongs ter <u>me</u> ...
an' I aims ter claim him now. When my blood war bi'lin' like a mortal
fever ... right hyar in this room ... didn't ye fo'ce me ter lay aside
my grudge till sich day es ye give me license ter take hit up ergin?...
an' hain't thet day come now?... From thet time till this I've kep' my
word ... but hell hitself couldn't hold me back no longer.... Ye kain't
hev him, Hump. He's <u>mine</u>!"
</p><p>He paused, then with something like a sob he repeated in a dazed voice,
"An' ye says he aimed ter fo'ce Dorothy with his love-makin'. God!"
</p><p>Hump Doane was still clinging to the rifle upon which Thornton had laid
his hands, and they stood there, two claimants, neither of whom was
willing to surrender his title to a disputed prize--the prize of Bas
Rowlett's life.
</p><p>But at length the older fingers loosened their hold and the older man
took a stumbling step and knelt by his dead. Then the younger, with the
gun cradled in his elbow, and a light of release in his eyes--a light
that seemed almost one of contentment--went out through the door and
crossed the yard to the fence where his mount was hitched.
