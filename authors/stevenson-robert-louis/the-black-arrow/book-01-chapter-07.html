<p>They awoke in the grey of the morning; the birds were not yet in full
song, but twittered here and there among the woods; the sun was not yet
up, but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours. Half starved and
over-weary as they were, they lay without moving, sunk in a delightful
lassitude. And as they thus lay, the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon
their ears.
</p><p>"A bell!" said Dick, sitting up. "Can we be, then, so near to Holywood?"
</p><p>A little after, the bell clanged again, but this time somewhat nearer
hand; and from that time forth, and still drawing nearer and nearer, it
continued to sound brokenly abroad in the silence of the morning.
</p><p>"Nay, what should this betoken?" said Dick, who was now broad awake.
</p><p>"It is some one walking," returned Matcham, "and the bell tolleth ever
as he moves."
</p><p>"I see that well," said Dick. "But wherefore? What maketh he in Tunstall
Woods? Jack," he added, "laugh at me an ye will, but I like not the
hollow sound of it."
</p><p>"Nay," said Matcham, with a shiver, "it hath a doleful note. An the day
were not come----"
</p><p>But just then the bell, quickening its pace, began to ring thick and
hurried, and then it gave a single hammering jangle, and was silent for
a space.
</p><p>"It is as though the bearer had run for a paternoster while, and then
leaped the river," Dick observed.
</p><p>"And now beginneth he again to pace soberly forward," added Matcham.
</p><p>"Nay," returned Dick--"nay, not so soberly, Jack. 'Tis a man that
walketh you right speedily. 'Tis a man in some fear of his life, or
about some hurried business. See ye not how swift the beating draweth
near?"
</p><p>"It is now close by," said Matcham.
</p><p>They were now on the edge of the pit; and as the pit itself was on a
certain eminence, they commanded a view over the greater proportion of
the clearing, up to the thick woods that closed it in.
</p><p>The daylight, which was very clear and grey, showed them a riband of
white foot-path wandering among the gorse. It passed some hundred yards
from the pit, and ran the whole length of the clearing, east and west.
By the line of its course, Dick judged it should lead more or less
directly to the Moat House.
</p><p>Upon this path, stepping forth from the margin of the wood, a white
figure now appeared. It paused a little, and seemed to look about; and
then, at a slow pace, and bent almost double, it began to draw near
across the heath. At every step the bell clanked. Face, it had none; a
white hood, not even pierced with eye-holes, veiled the head; and as the
creature moved, it seemed to feel its way with the tapping of a stick.
Fear fell upon the lads, as cold as death.
</p><p>"A leper!" said Dick, hoarsely.
</p><p>"His touch is death," said Matcham. "Let us run."
</p><p>"Not so," returned Dick. "See ye not?--he is stone blind. He guideth him
with a staff. Let us lie still; the wind bloweth towards the path, and
he will go by and hurt us not. Alas, poor soul, and we should rather
pity him!"
</p><p>"I will pity him when he is by," replied Matcham.
</p><p>The blind leper was now about half-way towards them, and just then the
sun rose and shone full on his veiled face. He had been a tall man
before he was bowed by his disgusting sickness, and even now he walked
with a vigorous step. The dismal beating of his bell, the pattering of
the stick, the eyeless screen before his countenance, and the knowledge
that he was not only doomed to death and suffering, but shut out for
ever from the touch of his fellow-men, filled the lads' bosoms with
dismay; and at every step that brought him nearer, their courage and
strength seemed to desert them.
</p><p>As he came about level with the pit, he paused, and turned his face full
upon the lads.
</p><p>"Mary be my shield! He sees us!" said Matcham, faintly.
</p><p>"Hush!" whispered Dick. "He doth but hearken. He is blind, fool!"
</p><p>The leper looked or listened, whichever he was really doing, for some
seconds. Then he began to move on again, but presently paused once more,
and again turned and seemed to gaze upon the lads. Even Dick became
dead-white and closed his eyes, as if by the mere sight he might become
infected. But soon the bell sounded, and this time, without any further
hesitation, the leper crossed the remainder of the little heath and
disappeared into the covert of the woods.
</p><p>"He saw us," said Matcham. "I could swear it!"
</p><p>"Tut!" returned Dick, recovering some sparks of courage. "He but heard
us. He was in fear, poor soul! An ye were blind, and walked in a
perpetual night, ye would start yourself, if ever a twig rustled or a
bird cried 'Peep.'"
</p><p>"Dick, good Dick, he saw us," repeated Matcham. "When a man hearkeneth,
he doth not as this man; he doth otherwise, Dick. This was seeing; it
was not hearing. He means foully. Hark, else, if his bell be not
stopped!"
</p><p>Such was the case. The bell rang no longer.
</p><p>"Nay," said Dick, "I like not that. Nay," he cried again, "I like that
little. What may this betoken? Let us go, by the mass!"
</p><p>"He hath gone east," added Matcham. "Good Dick, let us go westward
straight; I shall not breathe till I have my back turned upon that
leper."
</p><p>"Jack, y'are too cowardly," replied Dick. "We shall go fair for
Holywood, or as fair, at least, as I can guide you, and that will be due
north."
</p><p>They were afoot at once, passed the stream upon some stepping-stones,
and began to mount on the other side, which was steeper, towards the
margin of the wood. The ground became very uneven, full of knolls and
hollows; trees grew scattered or in clumps; it became difficult to
choose a path, and the lads somewhat wandered. They were weary,
besides, with yesterday's exertions and the lack of food, and they moved
but heavily and dragged their feet among the sand.
</p><p>Presently, coming to the top of a knoll, they were aware of the leper,
some hundred feet in front of them, crossing the line of their march by
a hollow. His bell was silent, his staff no longer tapped the ground,
and he went before him with the swift and assured footsteps of a man who
sees. Next moment he had disappeared into a little thicket.
</p><p>The lads, at the first glimpse, had crouched behind a tuft of gorse;
there they lay, horror-struck.
</p><p>"Certain, he pursueth us," said Dick--"certain! He held the clapper of
his bell in one hand, saw ye? that it should not sound. Now may the
saints aid and guide us, for I have no strength to combat pestilence!"
</p><p>"What maketh he?" cried Matcham. "What doth he want? Who ever heard the
like, that a leper, out of mere malice, should pursue unfortunates? Hath
he not his bell to that very end, that people may avoid him? Dick, there
is below this something deeper."
</p><p>"Nay, I care not," moaned Dick; "the strength is gone out of me; my legs
are like water. The saints be mine assistance!"
</p><p>"Would ye lie there idle?" cried Matcham. "Let us back into the open. We
have the better chance; he cannot steal upon us unawares."
</p><p>"Not I," said Dick. "My time is come, and peradventure he may pass us
by."
</p><p>"Bend me, then, your bow!" cried the other. "What! will ye be a man?"
</p><p>Dick crossed himself. "Would ye have me shoot upon a leper?" he cried.
"The hand would fail me. Nay, now," he added--"nay, now, let be! With
sound men I will fight, but not with ghosts and lepers. Which this is I
wot not. One or other, Heaven be our protection!"
</p><p>"Now," said Matcham, "if this be man's courage, what a poor thing is
man! But sith ye will do naught, let us lie close."
</p><p>Then came a single, broken jangle on the bell.
</p><p>"He hath missed his hold upon the clapper," whispered Matcham. "Saints!
how near he is!"
</p><p>But Dick answered never a word; his teeth were near chattering.
</p><p>Soon they saw a piece of the white robe between some bushes; then the
leper's head was thrust forth from behind a trunk, and he seemed
narrowly to scan the neighbourhood before he once again withdrew. To
their stretched senses, the whole bush appeared alive with rustlings and
the creak of twigs; and they heard the beating of each other's heart.
</p><p>Suddenly, with a cry, the leper sprang into the open close by, and ran
straight upon the lads. They, shrieking aloud, separated and began to
run different ways. But their horrible enemy fastened upon Matcham, ran
him swiftly down, and had him almost instantly a prisoner. The lad gave
one scream that echoed high and far over the forest, he had one spasm of
struggling, and then all his limbs relaxed, and he fell limp into his
captor's arms.
</p><p>Dick heard the cry and turned. He saw Matcham fall; and on the instant
his spirit and his strength revived. With a cry of pity and anger, he
unslung and bent his arblast. But ere he had time to shoot, the leper
held up his hand.
</p><p>"Hold your shot, Dickon!" cried a familiar voice. "Hold your shot, mad
wag! Know ye not a friend?"
</p><p>And then laying down Matcham on the turf, he undid the hood from off his
face, and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley.
</p><p>"Sir Daniel!" cried Dick.
</p><p>"Ay, by the mass, Sir Daniel!" returned the knight. "Would ye shoot upon
your guardian, rogue? But here is this----" And there he broke off, and
pointing to Matcham, asked: "How call ye him, Dick?"
</p><p>"Nay," said Dick, "I call him Master Matcham. Know ye him not? He said
ye knew him!"
</p><p>"Ay," replied Sir Daniel, "I know the lad"; and he chuckled. "But he has
fainted; and, by my sooth, he might have had less to faint for! Hey,
Dick? Did I put the fear of death upon you?"
</p><p>"Indeed, Sir Daniel, ye did that," said Dick, and sighed again at the
mere recollection. "Nay, sir, saving your respect, I had as lief 'a' met
the devil in person; and to speak truth, I am yet all a-quake. But what
made ye, sir, in such a guise?"
</p><p>Sir Daniel's brow grew suddenly black with anger.
</p><p>"What made I?" he said. "Ye do well to mind me of it! What? I skulked
for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall, Dick. We were ill sped at
the battle; we but got there to be swept among the rout. Where be all
my good men-at-arms? Dick, by the mass, I know not! We were swept down;
the shot fell thick among us; I have not seen one man in my own colours
since I saw three fall. For myself, I came sound to Shoreby, and being
mindful of the Black Arrow, got me this gown and bell, and came softly
by the path for the Moat House. There is no disguise to be compared with
it; the jingle of this bell would scare me the stoutest outlaw in the
forest; they would all turn pale to hear it. At length I came by you and
Matcham. I could see but evilly through this same hood, and was not sure
of you, being chiefly, and for many a good cause, astonished at the
finding you together. Moreover, in the open, where I had to go slowly
and tap with my staff, I feared to disclose myself. But see," he added,
"this poor shrew begins a little to revive. A little good canary will
comfort me the heart of it."
</p><p>The knight, from under his long dress, produced a stout bottle, and
began to rub the temples and wet the lips of the patient, who returned
gradually to consciousness, and began to roll dim eyes from one to
another.
</p><p>"What cheer, Jack!" said Dick. "It was no leper, after all; it was Sir
Daniel! See!"
</p><p>"Swallow me a good draught of this," said the knight. "This will give
you manhood. Thereafter, I will give you both a meal, and we shall all
three on to Tunstall. For, Dick," he continued, laying forth bread and
meat upon the grass, "I will avow to you, in all good conscience, it
irks me sorely to be safe between four walls. Not since I backed a horse
have I been pressed so hard; peril of life, jeopardy of land and
livelihood, and to sum up, all these losels in the wood to hunt me down.
But I be not yet shent. Some of my lads will pick me their way home.
Hatch hath ten fellows; Selden, he had six. Nay, we shall soon be strong
again; and if I can but buy my peace with my right fortunate and
undeserving Lord of York, why, Dick, we'll be a man again and go
a-horseback!"
</p><p>And so saying, the knight filled himself a horn of canary, and pledged
his ward in dumb show.
</p><p>"Selden," Dick faltered--"Selden--" And he paused again.
</p><p>Sir Daniel put down the wine untasted.
</p><p>"How!" he cried, in a changed voice. "Selden? Speak! What of Selden?"
</p><p>Dick stammered forth the tale of the ambush and the massacre.
</p><p>The knight heard in silence; but as he listened, his countenance became
convulsed with rage and grief.
</p><p>"Now here," he cried, "on my right hand, I swear to avenge it! If that I
fail, if that I spill not ten men's souls for each, may this hand wither
from my body! I broke this Duckworth like a rush; I beggared him to his
door; I burned the thatch above his head; I drove him from this country;
and now, cometh he back to beard me? Nay, but, Duckworth, this time it
shall go bitter hard!"
</p><p>He was silent for some time, his face working.
</p><p>"Eat!" he cried, suddenly. "And you here," he added to Matcham, "swear
me an oath to follow straight to the Moat House."
</p><p>"I will pledge mine honour," replied Matcham.
</p><p>"What make I with your honour?" cried the knight. "Swear me upon your
mother's welfare!"
</p><p>Matcham gave the required oath; and Sir Daniel readjusted the hood over
his face, and prepared his bell and staff. To see him once more in that
appalling travesty somewhat revived the horror of his two companions.
But the knight was soon upon his feet.
</p><p>"Eat with despatch," he said, "and follow me yarely to mine house."
</p><p>And with that he set forth again into the woods; and presently after the
bell began to sound, numbering his steps, and the two lads sat by their
untasted meal, and heard it die slowly away up-hill into the distance.
</p><p>"And so ye go to Tunstall?" Dick inquired.
</p><p>"Yea, verily," said Matcham, "when needs must! I am braver behind Sir
Daniel's back than to his face."
</p><p>They ate hastily, and set forth along the path through the airy upper
levels of the forest, where great beeches stood apart among green lawns,
and the birds and squirrels made merry on the boughs. Two hours later,
they began to descend upon the other side, and already, among the
tree-tops, saw before them the red walls and roofs of Tunstall House.
</p><p>"Here," said Matcham, pausing, "ye shall take your leave of your friend
Jack, whom y'are to see no more. Come, Dick, forgive him what he did
amiss, as he, for his part, cheerfully and lovingly forgiveth you."
</p><p>"And wherefore so?" asked Dick. "An we both go to Tunstall, I shall see
you yet again, I trow, and that right often."
</p><p>"Ye'll never again see poor Jack Matcham," replied the other, "that was
so fearful and burthensome, and yet plucked you from the river; ye'll
not see him more, Dick, by mine honour!" He held his arms open, and the
lads embraced and kissed. "And, Dick," continued Matcham, "my spirit
bodeth ill. Y'are now to see a new Sir Daniel; for heretofore hath all
prospered in his hands exceedingly, and fortune followed him; but now,
methinks, when his fate hath come upon him, and he runs the adventure of
his life, he will prove but a foul lord to both of us. He may be brave
in battle, but he hath the liar's eye; there is fear in his eye, Dick,
and fear is as cruel as the wolf! We go down into that house, St. Mary
guide us forth again!"
</p><p>And so they continued their descent in silence, and came out at last
before Sir Daniel's forest stronghold, where it stood, low and shady,
flanked with round towers and stained with moss and lichen, in the
lilied waters of the moat. Even as they appeared, the doors were opened,
the bridge lowered, and Sir Daniel himself, with Hatch and the parson at
his side, stood ready to receive them.
