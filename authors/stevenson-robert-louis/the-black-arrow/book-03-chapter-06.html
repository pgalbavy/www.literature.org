<p><strong>(CONCLUDED)</strong>
</p>
<p>The moans of the wounded baron blended with the wailing of the ship's
dog. The poor animal, whether he was merely sick at heart to be
separated from his friends, or whether he indeed recognised some peril
in the labouring of the ship, raised his cries, like minute-guns, above
the roar of wave and weather; and the more superstitious of the men
heard, in these sounds, the knell of the <u>Good Hope</u>.
</p><p>Lord Foxham had been laid in a berth upon a fur cloak. A little lamp
burned dim before the Virgin in the bulkhead, and by its glimmer Dick
could see the pale countenance and hollow eyes of the hurt man.
</p><p>"I am sore hurt," said he. "Come near to my side, young Shelton; let
there be one by me who, at least, is gentle born; for after having lived
nobly and richly all the days of my life, this is a sad pass that I
should get my hurt in a little ferreting skirmish, and die here, in a
foul, cold ship upon the sea, among broken men and churls."
</p><p>"Nay, my lord," said Dick, "I pray rather to the saints that ye will
recover you of your hurt, and come soon and sound ashore."
</p><p>"How!" demanded his lordship. "Come sound ashore? There is, then, a
question of it?"
</p><p>"The ship laboureth--the sea is grievous and contrary," replied the lad;
"and by what I can learn of my fellow that steereth us, we shall do
well, indeed, if we come dry-shod to land."
</p><p>"Ha!" said the baron, gloomily, "thus shall every terror attend upon the
passage of my soul! Sir, pray rather to live hard, that ye may die easy,
than to be fooled and fluted all through life, as to the pipe and
tabour, and, in the last hour, be plunged among misfortunes! Howbeit, I
have that upon my mind that must not be delayed. We have no priest
aboard?"
</p><p>"None," replied Dick.
</p><p>"Here, then, to my secular interests," resumed Lord Foxham: "ye must be
as good a friend to me dead, as I found you a gallant enemy when I was
living. I fall in an evil hour for me, for England, and for them that
trusted me. My men are being brought by Hamley--he that was your rival;
they will rendezvous in the long holm at Holywood; this ring from off my
finger will accredit you to represent mine orders; and I shall write,
besides, two words upon this paper, bidding Hamley yield to you the
damsel. Will he obey? I know not."
</p><p>"But, my lord, what orders?" inquired Dick.
</p><p>"Ay," quoth the baron, "ay--the orders"; and he looked upon Dick with
hesitation. "Are ye Lancaster or York?" he asked, at length.
</p><p>"I shame to say it," answered Dick, "I can scarce clearly answer. But
so much I think is certain: since I serve with Ellis Duckworth, I serve
the house of York. Well, if that be so, I declare for York."
</p><p>"It is well," returned the other; "it is exceeding well. For, truly, had
ye said Lancaster, I wot not for the world what I had done. But sith ye
are for York, follow me. I came hither but to watch these lords at
Shoreby, while mine excellent young lord, Richard of Gloucester,[1]
prepareth a sufficient force to fall upon and scatter them. I have made
me notes of their strength, what watch they keep, and how they lie; and
these I was to deliver to my young lord on Sunday, an hour before noon,
at St. Bride's Cross beside the forest. This tryst I am not like to
keep, but I pray you, of courtesy, to keep it in my stead; and see that
not pleasure, nor pain, tempest, wound, nor pestilence withhold you from
the hour and place, for the welfare of England lieth upon this cast."
</p><p>    [1] At the date of this story, Richard Crookback could not have been
    created Duke of Gloucester; but for clearness, with the reader's
    leave, he shall so be called.
</p><p>"I do soberly take this upon me," said Dick. "In so far as in me lieth,
your purpose shall be done."
</p><p>"It is good," said the wounded man. "My lord duke shall order you
further, and if ye obey him with spirit and good-will, then is your
fortune made. Give me the lamp a little nearer to mine eyes, till that I
write these words for you."
</p><p>He wrote a note "to his worshipful kinsman, Sir John Hamley"; and then a
second, which he left without external superscripture.
</p><p>"This is for the duke," he said. "The word is 'England and Edward,' and
the counter, 'England and York.'"
</p><p>"And Joanna, my lord?" asked Dick.
</p><p>"Nay, ye must get Joanna how ye can," replied the baron. "I have named
you for my choice in both these letters; but ye must get her for
yourself, boy. I have tried, as ye see here before you, and have lost my
life. More could no man do."
</p><p>By this time the wounded man began to be very weary; and Dick, putting
the precious papers in his bosom, bade him be of good cheer, and left
him to repose.
</p><p>The day was beginning to break, cold and blue, with flying squalls of
snow. Close under the lee of the <u>Good Hope</u>, the coast lay in alternate
rocky headlands and sandy bays; and farther inland the wooded hill-tops
of Tunstall showed along the sky. Both the wind and the sea had gone
down; but the vessel wallowed deep, and scarce rose upon the waves.
</p><p>Lawless was still fixed at the rudder; and by this time nearly all the
men had crawled on deck, and were now gazing, with blank faces, upon the
inhospitable coast.
</p><p>"Are we going ashore?" asked Dick.
</p><p>"Ay," said Lawless, "unless we get first to the bottom."
</p><p>And just then the ship rose so languidly to meet a sea, and the water
weltered so loudly in her hold, that Dick involuntarily seized the
steersman by the arm.
</p><p>"By the mass!" cried Dick, as the bows of the <u>Good Hope</u> reappeared
above the foam, "I thought we had foundered, indeed; my heart was at my
throat."
</p><p>In the waist, Greensheve, Hawksley, and the better men of both companies
were busy breaking up the deck to build a raft; and to these Dick joined
himself, working the harder to drown the memory of his predicament. But,
even as he worked, every sea that struck the poor ship, and every one of
her dull lurches, as she tumbled wallowing among the waves, recalled him
with a horrid pang to the immediate proximity of death.
</p><p>Presently, looking up from his work, he saw that they were close in
below a promontory; a piece of ruinous cliff, against the base of which
the sea broke white and heavy, almost overplumbed the deck; and, above
that, again, a house appeared, crowning a down.
</p><p>Inside the bay the seas ran gaily, raised the <u>Good Hope</u> upon their
foam-flecked shoulders, carried her beyond the control of the steersman,
and in a moment dropped her, with a great concussion, on the sand, and
began to break over her half-mast high, and roll her to and fro. Another
great wave followed, raised her again, and carried her yet farther in;
and then a third succeeded, and left her far inshore of the more
dangerous breakers, wedged upon a bank.
</p><p>"Now, boys," cried Lawless, "the saints have had a care of us, indeed.
The tide ebbs; let us but sit down and drink a cup of wine, and before
half an hour ye may all march me ashore as safe as on a bridge."
</p><p>A barrel was broached, and, sitting in what shelter they could find from
the flying snow and spray, the shipwrecked company handed the cup
around, and sought to warm their bodies and restore their spirits.
</p><p>Dick, meanwhile, returned to Lord Foxham, who lay in great perplexity
and fear, the floor of his cabin washing knee-deep in water, and the
lamp, which had been his only light, broken and extinguished by the
violence of the blow.
</p><p>"My lord," said young Shelton, "fear not at all; the saints are plainly
for us; the seas have cast us high upon a shoal, and as soon as the tide
hath somewhat ebbed, we may walk ashore upon our feet."
</p><p>It was nearly an hour before the vessel was sufficiently deserted by the
ebbing sea, and they could set forth for the land, which appeared dimly
before them through a veil of driving snow.
</p><p>Upon a hillock on one side of their way a party of men lay huddled
together, suspiciously observing the movements of the new arrivals.
</p><p>"They might draw near and offer us some comfort," Dick remarked.
</p><p>"Well, an' they come not to us, let us even turn aside to them," said
Hawksley. "The sooner we come to a good fire and a dry bed the better
for my poor lord."
</p><p>But they had not moved far in the direction of the hillock, before the
men, with one consent, rose suddenly to their feet, and poured a flight
of well-directed arrows on the shipwrecked company.
</p><p>"Back! back!" cried his lordship. "Beware, in Heaven's name, that ye
reply not."
</p><p>"Nay," cried Greensheve, pulling an arrow from his leather jack. "We are
in no posture to fight, it is certain, being drenching wet, dog-weary,
and three-parts frozen; but for the love of old England, what aileth
them to shoot thus cruelly on their poor country people in distress?"
</p><p>"They take us to be French pirates," answered Lord Foxham. "In these
most troublesome and degenerate days we cannot keep our own shores of
England; but our old enemies, whom we once chased on sea and land, do
now range at pleasure, robbing and slaughtering and burning. It is the
pity and reproach of this poor land."
</p><p>The men upon the hillock lay, closely observing them, while they trailed
upward from the beach and wound inland among desolate sand-hills; for a
mile or so they even hung upon the rear of the march, ready, at a sign,
to pour another volley on the weary and dispirited fugitives; and it was
only when, striking at length upon a firm highroad, Dick began to call
his men to some more martial order, that these jealous guardians of the
coast of England silently disappeared among the snow. They had done what
they desired; they had protected their own homes and farms, their own
families and cattle; and their private interest being thus secured, it
mattered not the weight of a straw to any one of them, although the
Frenchmen should carry blood and fire to every other parish in the realm
of England.
