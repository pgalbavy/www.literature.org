<p>Meanwhile Ben Mayberry was vigorously working the log in toward
shore. It moved slowly, but the current was sluggish, the space
brief, and he was certain to land in a few minutes.</p>

<p>One of the stones struck Ben on the shoulder. It must have angered
him, for instead of trying to dodge the rest, he used his pushing-pole
with more energy than before and paid no heed to the missiles,
several of which were stopped by his body.</p>

<p>It was plain that the valorous little fellow meant to attack
the three city lads, who were pestering him not only with stones,
but with taunts that were far more exasperating.</p>

<p>"Wonder who blacked his shoes?"</p>

<p>"Ain't that hat a beauty? He can comb his hair without taking
it off."</p>

<p>"That one suspender must have cost him a good deal."</p>

<p>"By gracious, he's going to chew us up," laughed the tallest,
as the log approached land; "stand back, boys, you promised him
to me, and I don't want either of you to say you helped me to
knock him out in the third round."</p>

<p>The next minute the log was so close that the nimble-footed Ben
leaped ashore and strode straight for the valiant Rutherford,
who immediately threw himself in "position." His attitude was
certainly artistic, with his left foot thrown forward, his right
fist clinched and held across his breast, and his left extended
ready to be shot forward into the first opening that his enemy
presented.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to assume the proper pugilistic attitude;
it is altogether another to act the part of a trained pugilist.</p>

<p>"Come on, Country!" called out the exultant Rutherford; "but
I hope you've bid your friends farewell."</p>

<p>The other boys stood back and watched the singular contest. I
carefully approached so as to be ready to protect Ben when it
should become necessary.</p>

<p>The brave fellow never hesitated, but the instant he landed lightly
on the shore he went straight for Rutherford, who, it was plain,
was slightly surprised and disconcerted by his unscientific conduct.
But the city youth kept his guard well up, and the moment Ben
was within reach he struck a violent blow intended for the face.</p>

<p>But Ben dodged it easily, dropping his head and running with
cat-like agility directly under the guard of his antagonist, who,
before he could understand precisely what it meant, found himself
clasped around the waist and thrown on his back with such violence
that a loud grunt was forced from him, and his handsome new hat
rolled rapidly down into the water.</p>

<p>And I am free to confess that I was delighted when I saw Ben
give him several of his "best licks," which made the tall boy
roar for mercy.</p>

<p>"Take him off, boys! he's killing me! Quick! I can't live much
longer."</p>

<p>The others were terrified at the hurricane-like style in which
the boy had turned the tables on the scientific Rutherford, but
they could not stand by and see their companion massacred without
raising a finger to help him.</p>

<p>"Pull him off!" yelled the victim, twisting his body and banging
his legs in the soft earth in his vain effort to free himself
from Ben, who was pegging away at him. "Pull him off! Put me on
top, and I'll settle him!"</p>

<p>One of the boys ran forward and reached out his hand, intending
to catch Ben by the shoulder and fling him to the ground; but,
to my intense amazement and equally intense delight, Ben caught
his arm, jerked him forward across the body of Rutherford, and
belabored both of them. It was one of the neatest feats I ever
saw performed, and, under the circumstances, I would have pronounced
it impossible had it not been done before my own eyes.</p>

<p>Both the hats of the Boston youths were floating down the river,
and they were so close to the water's edge that they were covered
with mud. The vigor of the assault on the two was increased rather
than diminished, and we spectators were cruel enough to laugh
heartily over the exhibition, accompanied as it was by the frenzied
yells of the two lads who were receiving the wrathful attentions
of Ben Mayberry.</p>

<p>The third boy could not stand it. He must have thought they had
come in collision with a gorilla or some sort of wild animal,
for he started up the river bank, shouting "Murder!" at the top
of his voice. Ben, having got through with the two under him,
sprang off and allowed them to rise, standing ready to renew the
fight should they show any desire to do so.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BEN CAUGHT HIS ARM, JERKED HIM ACROSS THE
BODY OF RUTHERFORD, AND BELABORED BOTH OF THEM. &</em>mdash;P.

<p>But they were too thoroughly vanquished. Their plight was laughable,
and yet pitiable. They were coated with mud from head to foot,
and their pretty hats, with their polka-dot bands, were gone too
far down the river to be recovered.</p>

<p>They seemed dazed for a minute or so, but as soon as they realized
they were on their feet they started off after their flying companion,
never pausing to look behind them, but running as though a Bengal
tiger was at their heels.</p>

<p>"Ben," said I, walking forward as soon as I could assume a serious
expression of countenance, "do you not know it is very wrong to
fight?"</p>

<p>"That's what I was tryin' to teach them city chaps. I guess they'll
think so after this."</p>

<p>"You certainly did your best to convince them it isn't wise to
attack you; but, Ben, what have you been doing lately?"</p>

<p>"My last job was whipping them," replied the urchin, with a roguish
twinkle of his blue eyes; "but that was fun, and if you mean work,
I hain't had anything but selling papers since last summer, but
sometimes I run errands."</p>

<p>"Do you go to school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you like a job?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I would, sir, for mother finds it hard work to get along,
and sometimes there isn't anything to eat in the house. Once,
when I was a little fellow, when I saw mother crying, and there
was no bread, I slipped out at night and stole a loaf, but mother
would not touch it when I brought it home, and made me take it
back. She told me I must starve before I did wrong, and so I will.
I have been trying to get a job all summer, but everybody says
I am too young and small. I take all the exercise I can, so as
to make me grow, and that's one reason why I pitched into them
city chaps and laid 'em out."</p>

<p>"Well, Ben, you know where the office of the Western Union is;
come around there to-morrow morning, at eight o'clock, and I will
give you something to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm very thankful to you, sir, and this will make my mother
the happiest woman in Damietta."</p>

<p>I saw tears in the bright eyes, as Ben ran home to carry the
good news to his mother.</p>
