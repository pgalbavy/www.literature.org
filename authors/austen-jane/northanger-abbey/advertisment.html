<p><em>ADVERTISEMENT BY THE AUTHORESS, TO NORTHANGER ABBEY</em></p>

<p>This little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended
for immediate publication. It was disposed of to a bookseller,
it was even advertised, and why the business proceeded no farther,
the author has never been able to learn. That any bookseller should
think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while
to publish seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author
nor the public have any other concern than as some observation
is necessary upon those parts of the work which thirteen years
have made comparatively obsolete. The public are entreated to
bear in mind that thirteen years have passed since it was finished,
many more since it was begun, and that during that period, places,
manners, books, and opinions have undergone considerable changes.</p>

<p> A <em>NOTE ON THE TEXT</em></p>

<p>Northanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title.
The manuscript was revised around 1803 and sold to a London publisher,
Crosbie &amp; Co., who sold it back in 1816. The Signet Classic
text is based on the first edition, published by John Murray,
London, in 1818—the year following Miss Austen’s death. Spelling
and punctuation have been largely brought into conformity with
modern British usage.</p>
