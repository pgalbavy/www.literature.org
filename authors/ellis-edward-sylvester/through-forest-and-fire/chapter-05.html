<p>When Nick Ribsam set out to find his missing sister Nellie, he
made the search as thorough as possible.</p>

<p>The first house at which he stopped was that of Mr. Marston,
which, it will be remembered, was only a short distance away from
his own home. There, to his disappointment, he learned that their
little girl had not been at school that day, and consequently
they could tell him nothing.</p>

<p>Without waiting longer than to give a few words of explanation
he resumed his trot, and soon after turned into the lane leading
to the home of Mr. Kilgore. He found that both Bobby and Sallie
had been to school, but they had nothing to tell. When we are
more than usually anxious to learn something, it seems that every
one whom we meet is stupid beyond endurance. If we are in a strange
place and apply for information, the ignorance of nearly every
person is exasperating.</p>

<p>Bobby and Sallie remembered seeing Nellie in school during the
forenoon and afternoon, but, while the boy insisted that she came
along the road with them after dismissal, Sallie was just as positive
that the missing girl was not with them.</p>

<p>The party of school children which usually went over the highway
was so small in number that it is hard to understand how such
a mistake could be made, but the difference between Bobby and
Sallie was irreconcilable.</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> she didn't come home with us," said Sallie,
stamping her foot to give emphasis to the words.</p>

<p>"And I <em>know</em> she did," declared Bobby, equally emphatically,
"for me and her played tag."</p>

<p>"Why don't you say she and I played tag?" asked Nick, impatient
with both the children.</p>

<p>"'Cause it was me and her," insisted Bobby.</p>

<p>"What a dunce-head!" exclaimed his sister; "that was <em>last</em>
night when you played tag, and you tumbled over into the ditch
and bellered like the big baby you are."</p>

<p>"I remember that he did that last night," said Nick, hoping to
help the two to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>"I know I done that last night, but this afternoon I done it
too. I fall into the ditch every night and beller; I do it on
purpose to fool them that are chasing me."</p>

<p>Nick found he could gain nothing; but he believed the sister
was right and the brother wrong, as afterward proved to be the
case.</p>

<p>There were no more houses between his own home and the school
building, and Nick resumed his dog trot, never halting until he
came in front of a little whitewashed cottage just beyond the
stone school-house.</p>

<p>The latter stood at the cross roads, and the cottage to the left
was where the teacher, Mr. Layton, an old bachelor, lived with
his two maiden sisters.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton, although strict to severity in the school-room, was
a kind-hearted man and was fond of the Ribsam children, for they
were bright, cheerful, and obedient, and never gave him any trouble,
as did some of his other pupils. He listened to Nick's story,
and his sympathy was aroused at once.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said he, "that your good father and mother,
not to mention yourself, should be so sorely troubled; but I hope
this is not serious. Nellie came to me about three o'clock and
asked whether I would let her go home."</p>

<p>"Was she sick?" asked the distressed brother.</p>

<p>"Not at all; but she said you had gone to Dunbarton in your carriage
and she wanted to meet you coming back. She knew her lessons perfectly,
and Nellie is such a good girl that I felt that I could not refuse
so simple a request. So I told her she could go. I saw her start
homeward with her lunch-basket in one hand and her two school-books
in the other. She stepped off so briskly and was in such cheerful
spirits that I stood at the window and watched her until she passed
around the bend in the road."</p>

<p>Nick felt his heart sink within him, for the words of the teacher
had let in a great deal of alarming truth upon him.</p>

<p>Nellie had reached the forks two hours ahead of him, and then,
not wishing to sit down and wait, she had started up the road
in the direction of Dunbarton to meet him. She must have entered
the eight mile stretch of woods from the south about the same
time Nick himself drove into it on his return from Dunbarton.</p>

<p>The two should have met near Shark Creek, but neither had seen
the other. Nick, as a matter of course, had kept to the road,
but what had become of Nellie?</p>

<p>This was the question the lad put to himself, and which caused
him to feel so faint that he sank down in a chair unable to speak
for a minute or two. Then, when he tried to do so, he had to stop,
and was kept busy swallowing the lump that would rise in his throat,
until finally the tears suddenly appeared, and, putting his hands
to his eyes, he gave way to his grief.</p>

<p>"There, there," said Mr. Layton soothingly, "don't cry, Nick,
for it will do no good. Nellie has strayed off in the woods to
gather flowers or perhaps wild grapes and has missed her way."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;is&mdash;lost&mdash;poor &mdash;Nellie!" said the lad as best he
could between his sobs; "we'll never see her again."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't as bad as that! I suppose she has grown weary,
and, sitting down to rest, has fallen asleep."</p>

<p>If the good teacher meant this to soothe the lad, it had the
contrary effect, for the picture of his little sister wandering
alone in the woods was one of the most dreadful that could be
imagined, and it took all the manhood of his nature to keep from
breaking down again.</p>

<p>While the interview was under way, Mr. Layton was busy changing
his slippers for his boots, his wrapper for his coat, and his
hat was donned just as he spoke the last words.</p>

<p>His sympathy did not expend itself in talk, but the instant he
saw what the trouble was he was eager to do all he could to help
his suffering friends. He even reproached himself for having given
Nellie permission to meet her brother, though no matter what harm
may have befallen her, no one could blame her instructor therefor.</p>

<p>"We must hunt for her," said Mr. Layton, when he was ready to
go out; "I will tell my sisters they need not be alarmed over
my absence, and I guess I will take the lantern with me."</p>

<p>Nick passed out to the front gate, where he waited a minute for
the teacher, until he should speak with his friends and get the
lantern ready. When he came forth, the boy felt much like the
patient who sees the surgeon take out his instruments and try
their edge to make sure they are in condition before using upon
him.</p>

<p>The sight of the lantern in the hand of Mr. Layton gave such
emphasis to the danger that it caused another quick throb of Nick's
heart, but he forced it down as the two started back over the
road, toward the school-house.</p>

<p>"There is no need of lighting the lantern until we get to the
woods," said the teacher, "for we don't need it, and I hope we
won't need it after we reach the forest. Poor Nellie! she will
feel dreadfully frightened, when she wakes up in the dark forest."</p>

<p>He regretted the words, for the two or three sobs that escaped
the brother, before he could master himself, showed that his heart
was swelled nigh to bursting.</p>

<p>The night was mild and pleasant, although a little too chilly
for any one to sleep out of doors. The moon was gibbous, and only
a few white, feathery clouds now and then drifted across its face.
Where there was no shadow, one could see for a hundred yards or
so with considerable distinctness&mdash;that is, enough to recognize
the figure of a man in motion.</p>

<p>Opposite the lane leading to the house of Mr. Kilgore, the teacher
stopped.</p>

<p>"I will go in and get him to join us," said Mr. Layton; "and
you had better hurry home for your father. On your way back, stop
for Mr. Marston; that will give us a pretty large party. If when
you reach the forks you do not find us there, don't wait, but
hurry on toward Dunbarton; you will meet us before you reach the
bridge over Shark Creek."</p>

<p>Nick did as told, and, still on a rapid trot, reached home panting
and excited, with the story which the reader has just learned.</p>

<p>Mr. Ribsam threw down his pipe, donned his hat and coat, and
started out the door. With his hand on the latch, he paused, and,
looking back, commanded his voice so as to say:</p>

<p>"Katrina, you and Nick needn't wait up for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, father," pleaded the lad, moving toward him: "would you
make me stay at home when Nellie is lost?"</p>

<p>"No, no &mdash;I did not think," answered the parent, in a confused
way; "I feel so bad I do not know what I do and say. Katrina,
don't feel too bad; we will come back as soon as we can."</p>

<p>Again the half distracted father placed his hand on the latch,
and he had drawn the door partly open, when his wife, pale and
trembling, called out in a voice of touching pathos:</p>

<p>"Gustav, my heart would break should I try to stay here, when
no one but God knows where my darling Nellie is; but, wherever
she may be, no sorrow or pain or suffering can come to her that
her mother will not share, and may our Heavenly Father let her
mother take it all upon her own shoulders!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Katrina; come on and bring the lantern with you."</p>
