<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Jack Dudley's enforced idleness had become intolerable. He could
stay no longer in the place from which Hank Hazletine had departed
a half-hour before. It was a waste of time to speculate over the
intentions of the veteran, and the youth made no attempt to do
so. He had set out to see whether he could act even an insignificant
part in the recovery of his loved comrade.</p>

<p>It has been said that the boy had the advantage over the man
in that it was not to be supposed any importance would be attached
to his actions. At the same time he was liable to "put his foot
in it" in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the conviction clung to Jack Dudley that the
key to the situation was in the neighborhood of the canyon. There
must be hundreds of places among the mountains where a prisoner
could be hidden from human eyes, but Hazletine's interest centred
in that wild gorge, and Jack was certain he had gone thither.</p>

<p>Then there was the fact of the cowman's visit two days before,
concerning which he would have said nothing but for his discovery
by the boys. Why Hank should have picked his way up that dangerous
place was known only to himself. Jack could form no theory to
explain it. But he did not forget the dispute of the three Indians
in front of the break and the start which one of them made to
follow the footsteps of the white man. There must be some attraction
in the canyon for them all.</p>

<p>Jack's dread was that Hazletine, despite his undoubted skill,
would frighten Tozer and Motoza by his efforts to defeat their
purpose, and drive them into slaying Fred and making off before
they could be punished. But the cowman had his own views, and
it was too late to dissuade him.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind the warning of his friend to use all possible
circumspection in his actions, Jack was so guarded that a full
hour had passed when he once more reached the break in the canyon,
which had already afforded them more than one interesting experience.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge, he was the only living person within
miles. The two Indians that had flitted across his field of vision
were gone, and it was impossible to say what had become of Hazletine.
Determined, however, to run no unnecessary risk, Jack remained
among the trees and rocks on the upper side of the break, where
he could not be seen unless some one almost stepped upon him.
Not satisfied with his first position, he shifted further to the
right, and lay down to wait and watch.</p>

<p>A gradual obscuring of the sky caused him to look at his watch.
Could it be possible? The autumn afternoon was almost gone. Night
was at hand, whereas he had supposed several hours of daylight
remained. Thus valuable time had slipped past and nothing had
been done for Fred Greenwood.</p>

<p>From where Jack lay he had a perfect view of the upper gate,
as it may be called, of the canyon. The gorge has already been
described as narrow at the point where the foamy waters dashed
through and expanded into the broad pool, after which they flowed
a short way and reunited, to make their next plunge between the
mountain walls on their journey to the sea thousands of miles
distant. Looking across this break, the boy could penetrate with
his eye for a dozen yards into the upper canyon. He saw the dripping
rocks upon which the angry buck sprang, only to pause and turn
back to join his companions below.</p>

<p>A curious thing happened. Jack was looking in the direction named,
when, with startling suddenness, an Indian shot into sight on
the furthest rock, beyond which the canyon made a sweeping curve
that shut off further view. His appearance was like the upleaping
of a Jack-in-the-box at the touch of the spring, but the explanation
was evident: he was making his way down the gorge from above,
when his leap from one rock to another brought him thus abruptly
into view.</p>

<p>This was interesting of itself, but a still more interesting
discovery came with the second glance at him. He was Motoza, the
Sioux!</p>

<p>It looked as if Hank Hazletine, with all his subtlety and woodcraft,
had failed to do that which came of itself to Jack Dudley.</p>

<p>The actions of the Sioux showed he was unusually careful about
being seen as he emerged from the canyon into fuller view, for,
after leaping to the rock which stood at the door of the gorge,
he stood a minute, then leaned forward and peered around the sides
as far as he could without losing his balance. He next stood erect
and looked keenly across the pool, and apparently at the very
spot where the boy lay hiding.</p>

<p>"What a face!" muttered Jack; "I never saw one so ugly, with
those daubs of paint; and his eyes shine just like that rattlesnake's
we killed. It can't be he sees me," added the youth in alarm,
as he cowered still lower; "one would think he could look through
a stone."</p>

<p>But nothing less than the Roentgen ray would have revealed the
young man, who was stealthily watching the ferocious buck. The
latter must have decided that the coast was clear, for with another
bound he landed upon a rock quite a way from the opening of the
canyon, and a second leap placed him on the shore where three
of his race had been standing when discovered by Jack and Fred.</p>

<p>Motoza did not linger, but moved with a very rapid stride across
the open space, where he was in full view of anyone in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"If I were sure you had done any harm to Fred," muttered Jack,
never removing his eyes from the repellant countenance, "I believe
I could treat you as we did the grizzly bear without a sting of
conscience. The idea of your harming a hair of the head of Fred
Greenwood, who showed you tenfold more mercy than you deserved&mdash;my
gracious! he must have seen me."</p>

<p>This involuntary exclamation was caused by the fact that the
Sioux was following a bee-line for the spot where Jack lay. Believing
a meeting inevitable, the youth placed his hand on his revolver,
the preferable weapon in the event of coming to close quarters.</p>

<p>But at the last moment Motoza turned to the left and passed among
the rocks within a couple of paces of the youth, who held his
breath until he was gone.</p>

<p>For some reasons Jack Dudley would have welcomed a meeting with
this miscreant, for he held him in no fear. For one moment he
meditated "holding him up," with the threat of death unless he
produced Fred Greenwood; but fortunately the youth had time in
which to see the wild absurdity of the thing, which could have
done no possible good and probably would have brought great harm.
So it was that Motoza passed out of sight and the youth was once
more left alone.</p>

<p>But Jack's thoughts had taken a new turn. Hazletine had expressed
the belief that in the interval between the first and second meeting
with Tozer either he or Motoza would hold communication with their
prisoner; consequently, if the Sioux could be kept under surveillance
without exciting his suspicion, he was likely to give some involuntary
and useful information.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Hank is; can it be that he, too, is watching
in the neighborhood and has seen Motoza come out as I saw him?
If so, the next fellow to pass in review before me will be my
esteemed friend."</p>

<p>When, however, a half-hour had gone by without anything being
seen of the cowman, Jack was warranted in believing that he was
the only one who was aware of the coming and going of the red
man.</p>

<p>Following out Hazletine's theory, it would seem that the prison
of Fred Greenwood, instead of being among the mountains, was within
the gorge. This was a startling conclusion, but the more Jack
reflected upon it the more strongly did he believe it.</p>

<p>"At any rate, I mean to find out whether it is so."</p>

<p>But on the verge of setting out he hesitated. There was more
than one reason why he should do so. In the first place, it was
exceedingly dangerous to attempt to make his way up the canyon
even by daylight, and the sun had already disappeared. He was
totally unfamiliar with the windings and would be in constant
danger of drowning. Moreover, he was liable, in the event of Fred
being held a prisoner in the gorge, to place himself with him,
or to defeat the negotiations for restoring him to liberty.</p>

<p>And yet, in the face of these and other obstacles, the youth
decided to make the foolhardy attempt.</p>

<p>First of all he fastened his Winchester to his back, both he
and his comrade having made provision for doing that before leaving
Bowman's ranch. Then he thrust his revolver more firmly into its
resting-place. This left his hands free, in case a sudden emergency
should call for their use, and gave him an opportunity of saving
the more important weapon. Then, night being fully come, he stepped
into the open space which marked the bank at the break of the
canyon. The stars were shining, but it would be a long time before
the moon rose.</p>

<p>A quick glance to the right and left revealed nothing to cause
alarm, and Jack pressed on until he stood on the spot where the
Sioux had landed when making his last leap. There was enough star-gleam
to show the black mass of stone, like a crouching monster gathering
to spring upon him. It will not be forgotten that the youth was
an exceptionally fine athlete, and, pausing but a moment, he easily
made the leap that carried him to the rock. In fact the task was
easy, and he would not have hesitated to follow in the footsteps
of the white man and Indian, could he have had the twilight of
mid-day to assist him.</p>

<p>The next bound placed him within the walls of the canyon, where
he paused with the question whether it would do to venture further.
The rushing waters were on all sides of him, and the cool spray
was dashed in his face and over his clothing. It was to be supposed
that where this furious current was compressed into such a narrow
compass its depth was considerable, and within its grasp the most
powerful swimmer would be helpless.</p>

<p>Peering into the gloom, the youth saw the top of the next rock
which was used as a stepping-stone by other visitors. If he were
mistaken it would be bad for him, but, with only a few minutes'
pause, he gathered his muscles and proved he was right. He was
now fairly within the canyon and still standing on solid support,
while there had been no trouble to maintain his foothold from
the moment he made the first leap.</p>

<p>His success thus far gave him renewed courage.</p>

<p>"What one person has done another can do," was his thought. "Fred
and I agreed that there is a good deal of risk in this, but if
I had a little more light nothing could be easier. These rocks
seem to be placed at the right intervals, and so long as I can
locate them I'll go ahead."</p>

<p>The belief of Jack was that somewhere in the side of the canyon
was a cave in which his comrade was held captive. The sight that
the two boys had obtained of Hank Hazletine, when he disappeared
so suddenly from sight, lent strength to the theory. If the youth
was right, the time of his attempt to ascend the gorge, with the
exception of the darkness, could not have been more favorable,
for Motoza was absent, and it was hardly to be supposed that his
place had been taken by Tozer or anyone else. What a happy meeting
it would be if the elder could find the younger!</p>

<p>The natural reasoning was that, if one boy was able to ascend
the canyon to where the other was imprisoned, the latter ought
to be able to leave his prison when the gaoler was absent. Jack's
explanation was probably the right one&mdash;either that Fred did not
know how readily the thing could be done, or Jack was soon to
find himself unable to complete his journey.</p>

<p>Spurred on by the hope of doing so much for the one he loved,
Jack paused only long enough to locate the next rock, when he
again leaped with the easy strength and grace that were natural
to him. His success did not render him careless. He was almost
in utter darkness, and was surprised that the way proved so easy.
By leaning forward and peering into the gloom he could generally
distinguish the most shadowy outlines of the nearest part of the
support, which, had it been slightly further removed, would have
been altogether beyond his reach.</p>

<p>It was unreasonable to expect the favorable conditions to continue,
and they did not. The time came very soon when, after one of his
leaps, the youth paused to collect himself, and was unable to
distinguish the next rock projecting above the roaring current.
The canyon just there was wider than usual, and he stooped over
and gazed to the right and left in turn, hoping to discover the
indispensable support.</p>

<p>"It must be somewhere near," he reflected, "else Hank and the
rest of them could have ascended no further; perhaps they did
not do so."</p>

<p>He gazed up the walls of darkness, but saw nothing that could
help solve the question. If there was a cave near at hand its
presence was betrayed by no friendly light. Although the tumult
of the current was almost deafening, he shouted the name of Fred
and listened for the response which came not.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for Jack Dudley to form the explanation
of why he failed to discern the next support. Hitherto his leaps
had been comparatively trifling. It would have been no trouble
to make them several feet longer. This was a spot where such a
jump was necessary, and therefore he could not discern the rock
which would have been visible with the help of the sun or moon.</p>

<p>What should he do? Turn back or keep on? It was a most serious
question, and he debated it a long time before forming a conclusion.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how readily, at times, we can convince ourselves
of the truth of that which we wish to believe. By and by Jack
Dudley was sure he made out the dim outlines of the lower point
of a huge rock, just where it ought to have been.</p>

<p>"I can't be mistaken, so here goes!"</p>

<p>And go he did, with a vengeance. It was the finest leap yet made,
but, unfortunately, the support upon which he so confidently counted
had no existence. Instead of landing on solid stone, he dropped
into the raging torrent and went spinning down stream like a cork
in a whirlpool.</p>

<p>He kept his presence of mind, and did not exhaust his strength
by trying to stem the current. His great peril was in being hurled
against some of the rocks and killed or having a limb broken.
Throwing out his arms just in time he averted this calamity, and
feeling himself scraping swiftly past one of the masses of stone
that had served him as a support, he desperately gripped it and
drew himself out of the water.</p>

<p>He was uninjured, but became immediately conscious of a great
misfortune. In the flurry his Winchester had become displaced
and was irrecoverably gone. It was with an exclamation of relief
that he found his revolver in place at his hip.</p>

<p>"This expedition of mine, considered strictly <em>as</em> an
expedition, is a failure," he grimly muttered, thankful for his
own escape, and still convinced that it was not as bad as it might
have been with his friend. "It won't do to try it again, and it
remains for me to get out of the canyon altogether."</p>

<p>He had landed upon the extreme upper end of the most immense
rock of all that had been used to help in the ascent. He remembered
it well. The upper portion was depressed and sloping, being three
or four feet above the current. Thus it happened that the point
to which he was clinging allowed him to be deluged with spray,
and he strove to climb to the higher part.</p>

<p>He was thus engaged, conscious of a number of severe bruises,
when an object whisked past his shoulder, taking a direction up
the gorge. He felt it graze his face, and detected something that
can only be described as a deepening of the dense gloom as it
shot over his head. It came and vanished like the flitting of
a bird's wing.</p>

<p>The youth for the moment was amazed beyond expression, and was
at a loss to explain what it could be. Then the truth flashed
upon him. Some one else was also going up the canyon, and had
leaped from the rock to which Jack was clinging, on his way to
the next one. He strove to pierce the darkness, but the effort
was useless.</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know who he was; I couldn't make
out whether it was a white man or an Indian. It may have been
Motoza, Tozer, Hank, or a stranger; but whoever he was, he has
no use for me."</p>

<p>Half suspecting a third party might put in an appearance, Jack
waited on the rock for some minutes, but nothing of the kind occurred,
and he prepared to continue his retreat.</p>

<p>The water was almost icy cold, the temperature being perceptibly
lower between the walls of the canyon and the clear air outside.
With his saturated garments, the youth was chilled and anxious
to reach a point where he could start a fire and obtain warmth
for his body. He had given over the expectation of seeing any
more persons in the gorge and wished to look after his own comfort.</p>

<p>To this haste was to be attributed the second accident that overtook
the young man. He had no difficulty in locating the place to land,
but he put too much vigor in the effort, so that when he struck
the slippery rock his momentum carried him forward, and despite
his resistance he took another plunge into the raging current
before he could check himself.</p>

<p>The place was preferable to the previous one, for it was almost
at the mouth of the canyon. He was guiding himself as best he
could, and on the alert to grasp something to check his swift
progress, when he debouched into the broad, open pool or miniature
lake at the break in the banks, where the current became so sluggish
that he swam with ease.</p>

<p>"This is growing monotonous," he muttered, as, after a few strokes,
his feet touched bottom and he walked out on dry land. "My rifle
is gone, but luckily I have kept my revolver for emergencies&#11834;"</p>

<p>He got no further with the remark, for his hand had gone back
to his hip with the result of discovering that the smaller weapon
had been lost during his last bath. But it was impossible wholly
to lose his good spirits.</p>

<p>"Whew! but that puts me in a fine condition to hunt grizzly bears
and meet bad Indians; I'm not so anxious to see Motoza as I was."</p>

<p>His teeth were chattering, and to start his blood in circulation
he began climbing the sloping bank, at the top of which, as will
be remembered, he had remained hidden with Fred Greenwood when
looking down upon the three Indians.</p>

<p>It was a laborious task, and he was panting when he reached the
summit, where he paused for a few minutes' rest. The prudent course
was to return as speedily as he could to the cavern by the plateau
and start a fire. His blanket had been left there, and would be
of great use in his present condition.</p>

<p>"I wonder, now, if somebody has been there and stolen them?"
he muttered, resuming his homeward tramp; "this thing ought not
to stop, and it seems to me Hank takes big chances in leaving
the blankets and ponies where some of these Indians can steal
them."</p>

<p>Jack had still to leap the canyon in order to reach his destination,
but the task had become an easy one and caused him no anxiety.
All was going well, when his first shock of alarm came with the
discovery that a wild animal was following him. His first thought
was that it was one of the Indians, but a glimpse, on the edge
of a slight clearing, showed that it was a quadruped.</p>

<p>Jack paused and looked intently at the creature. He could see
it only dimly, but sufficiently so to identify it as a wolf of
unusually large size. He suspected it was of the black species,
one of those savage brutes to be dreaded tenfold more than the
ordinary grey kind.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he knows I haven't got a firearm about me?
Ah, old fellow, if I had my Winchester it wouldn't take me long
to settle you."</p>

<p>It was no jesting matter, and Jack kept close watch of him while
threading his way to camp, as their headquarters were called.
Several times, when he turned quickly, he was startled to observe
that the animal had stolen quite close to him, as if to leap upon
his shoulders; but he showed his cowardly nature by darting back,
only to return the moment the youth turned his face away.</p>

<p>The question with Jack was whether he should stop and kindle
a fire, or wait until he reached the cavern. He preferred to do
the latter, but it looked unsafe to defer the precaution. The
distance, however, was short, and he hurried on until he clambered
over to the plateau and was greeted by a whinny from his pony,
Dick, who was quick to recognize him. Instead of keeping up the
pursuit, or attacking one of the horses, the wolf seemed to conclude
it best to turn his attention elsewhere. He slunk off, and was
seen no more.</p>
