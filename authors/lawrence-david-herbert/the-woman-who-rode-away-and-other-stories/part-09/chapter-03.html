<p>The third island was soon made habitable.  With cement and the big
pebbles from the shingle beach, two men built him a hut, and roofed
it with corrugated iron.  A boat brought over a bed and table, and
three chairs, with a good cupboard, and a few books.  He laid in a
supply of coal and paraffin and food - he wanted so little.</p>

<p>The house stood near the flat shingle bay where he landed, and
where he pulled up his light boat.  On a sunny day in August the
men sailed away and left him.  The sea was still and pale blue.  On
the horizon he saw the small mail-steamer slowly passing
northwards, as if she were walking.  She served the outer isles
twice a week.  He could row out to her if need be, in calm weather,
and he could signal her from a flagstaff behind his cottage.</p>

<p>Half a dozen sheep still remained on the island, as company; and he
had a cat to rub against his legs.  While the sweet, sunny days of
the northern autumn lasted, he would walk among the rocks, and over
the springy turf of his small domain, always coming to the
ceaseless, restless sea.  He looked at every leaf, that might be
different from another, and he watched the endless expansion and
contraction of the water-tossed sea-weed.  He had never a tree, not
even a bit of heather to guard.  Only the turf, and tiny turf-
plants, and the sedge by the pool, the seaweed in the ocean.  He
was glad.  He didn't want trees or bushes.  They stood up like
people, too assertive.  His bare, low-pitched island in the pale
blue sea was all he wanted.</p>

<p>He no longer worked at his book.  The interest had gone.  He liked
to sit on the low elevation of his island, and see the sea; nothing
but the pale, quiet sea.  And to feel his mind turn soft and hazy,
like the hazy ocean.  Sometimes, like a mirage, he would see the
shadow of land rise hovering to northwards.  It was a big island
beyond.  But quite without substance.</p>

<p>He was soon almost startled when he perceived the steamer on the
near horizon, and his heart contracted with fear, lest it were
going to pause and molest him.  Anxiously he watched it go, and not
till it was out of sight did he feel truly relieved, himself again.
The tension of waiting for human approach was cruel.  He did not
want to be approached.  He did not want to hear voices.  He was
shocked by the sound of his own voice, if he inadvertently spoke to
his cat.  He rebuked himself for having broken the great silence.
And he was irritated when his cat would look up at him and mew
faintly, plaintively.  He frowned at her.  And she knew.  She was
becoming wild, lurking in the rocks, perhaps fishing.</p>

<p>But what he disliked most was when one of the lumps of sheep opened
its mouth and baa-ed its hoarse, raucous baa.  He watched it, and
it looked to him hideous and gross.  He came to dislike the sheep
very much.</p>

<p>He wanted only to hear the whispering sound of the sea, and the
sharp cries of the gulls, cries that came out of another world to
him.  And best of all, the great silence.</p>

<p>He decided to get rid of the sheep, when the boat came.  They were
accustomed to him now, and stood and stared at him with yellow or
colourless eyes, in an insolence that was almost cold ridicule.
There was a suggestion of cold indecency about them.  He disliked
them very much.  And when they jumped with staccato jumps off the
rocks, and their hoofs made the dry, sharp hit, and the fleece
flopped on their square backs - he found them repulsive, degrading.</p>

<p>The fine weather passed, and it rained all day.  He lay a great
deal on his bed, listening to the water trickling from his roof
into the zinc water-butt, looking through the open door at the
rain, the dark rocks, the hidden sea.  Many gulls were on the
island now: many sea-birds of all sorts.  It was another world of
life.  Many of the birds he had never seen before.  His old impulse
came over him, to send for a book, to know their names.  In a
flicker of the old passion, to know the name of everything he saw,
he even decided to row out to the steamer.  The names of these
birds! he must know their names, otherwise he had not got them,
they were not quite alive to him.</p>

<p>But the desire left him, and he merely watched the birds as they
wheeled or walked around him, watched them vaguely, without
discrimination.  All interest had left him.  Only there was one
gull, a big handsome fellow, who would walk back and forth, back
and forth in front of the open door of the cabin, as if he had some
mission there.  He was big, and pearl-grey, and his roundnesses
were as smooth and lovely as a pearl.  Only the folded wings had
shut black pinions, and on the closed black feathers were three
very distinct white dots, making a pattern.  The islander wondered
very much, why this bit of trimming on the bird out of the far,
cold seas.  And as the gull walked back and forth, back and forth
in front of the cabin, strutting on pale-dusky gold feet, holding
up his pale yellow beak, that was curved at the tip, with curious
alien importance, the man wondered over him.  He was portentous, he
had a meaning.</p>

<p>Then the bird came no more.  The island, which had been full of sea-
birds, the flash of wings, the sound and cut of wings and sharp
eerie cries in the air, began to be deserted again.  No longer they
sat like living eggs on the rocks and turf, moving their heads, but
scarcely rising into flight round his feet.  No longer they ran
across the turf among the sheep, and lifted themselves upon low
wings.  The host had gone.  But some remained, always.</p>

<p>The days shortened, and the world grew eerie.  One day the boat
came: as if suddenly, swooping down.  The islander found it a
violation.  It was torture to talk to those two men, in their
homely clumsy clothes.  The air of familiarity around them was very
repugnant to him.  Himself, he was neatly dressed, his cabin was
neat and tidy.  He resented any intrusion, the clumsy homeliness,
the heavy-footedness of the two fishermen was really repulsive to
him.</p>

<p>The letters they had brought, he left lying unopened in a little
box.  In one of them was his money.  But he could not bear to open
even that one.  Any kind of contact was repulsive to him.  Even to
read his name on an envelope.  He hid the letters away.</p>

<p>And the hustle and horror of getting the sheep caught and tied and
put in the ship made him loathe with profound repulsion the whole
of the animal creation.  What repulsive god invented animals, and
evil-smelling men?  To his nostrils, the fishermen and the sheep
alike smelled foul; an uncleanness on the fresh earth.</p>

<p>He was still nerve-wracked and tortured when the ship at last
lifted sail and was drawing away, over the still sea.  And
sometimes days after, he would start with repulsion, thinking he
heard the munching of sheep.</p>

<p>The dark days of winter drew on.  Sometimes there was no real day
at all.  He felt ill, as if he were dissolving, as if dissolution
had already set in inside him.  Everything was twilight, outside,
and in his mind and soul.  Once, when he went to the door, he saw
black heads of men swimming in his bay.  For some moments he
swooned unconscious.  It was the shock, the horror of unexpected
human approach.  The horror in the twilight!  And not till the
shock had undermined him and left him disembodied, did he realize
that the black heads were the heads of seals swimming in.  A sick
relief came over him.  But he was barely conscious, after the
shock.  Later on, he sat and wept with gratitude, because they were
not men.  But he never realized that he wept.  He was too dim.
Like some strange, ethereal animal, he no longer realized what he
was doing.</p>

<p>Only he still derived his single satisfaction from being alone,
absolutely alone, with the space soaking into him.  The grey sea
alone, and the footing of his sea-washed island.  No other contact.
Nothing human to bring its horror into contact with him.  Only
space, damp, twilit, sea-washed space!  This was the bread of his
soul.</p>

<p>For this reason, he was most glad when there was a storm, or when
the sea was high.  Then nothing could get at him.  Nothing could
come through to him from the outer world.  True, the terrific
violence of the wind made him suffer badly.  At the same time, it
swept the world utterly out of existence for him.  He always liked
the sea to be heavily rolling and tearing.  Then no boat could get
at him.  It was like eternal ramparts round his island.</p>

<p>He kept no track of time, and no longer thought of opening a book.
The print, the printed letters, so like the depravity of speech,
looked obscene.  He tore the brass label from his paraffin stove.
He obliterated any bit of lettering in his cabin.</p>

<p>His cat had disappeared.  He was rather glad.  He shivered at her
thin, obtrusive call.  She had lived in the coal shed.  And each
morning he had put her a dish of porridge, the same as he ate.  He
washed her saucer with repulsion.  He did not like her writhing
about.  But he fed her scrupulously.  Then one day she did not come
for her porridge: she always mewed for it.  She did not come again.</p>

<p>He prowled about his island in the rain, in a big oil-skin coat,
not knowing what he was looking at, nor what he went out to see.
Time had ceased to pass.  He stood for long spaces, gazing from a
white, sharp face, with those keen, far-off blue eyes of his,
gazing fiercely and almost cruelly at the dark sea under the dark
sky.  And if he saw the labouring sail of a fishing boat away on
the cold waters, a strange malevolent anger passed over his
features.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was ill.  He knew he was ill, because he staggered as
he walked, and easily fell down.  Then he paused to think what it
was.  And he went to his stores and took out dried milk and malt,
and ate that.  Then he forgot again.  He ceased to register his own
feelings.</p>

<p>The days were beginning to lengthen.  All winter the weather had
been comparatively mild, but with much rain, much rain.  He had
forgotten the sun.  Suddenly, however, the air was very cold, and
he began to shiver.  A fear came over him.  The sky was level and
grey, and never a star appeared at night.  It was very cold.  More
birds began to arrive.  The island was freezing.  With trembling
hands he made a fire in his grate.  The cold frightened him.</p>

<p>And now it continued, day after day, a dull, deathly cold.
Occasional crumblings of snow were in the air.  The days were
greyly longer, but no change in the cold.  Frozen grey daylight.
The birds passed away, flying away.  Some he saw lying frozen.  It
was as if all life were drawing away, contracting away from the
north, contracting southwards.  &quot;Soon&quot;, he said to himself, &quot;it
will all be gone, and in all these regions nothing will be alive.&quot;
He felt a cruel satisfaction in the thought.</p>

<p>Then one night there seemed to be a relief: he slept better, did
not tremble half awake, and writhe so much, half-conscious.  He had
become so used to the quaking and writhing of his body, he hardly
noticed it.  But when for once it slept deep, he noticed that.</p>

<p>He awoke in the morning to a curious whiteness.  His window was
muffled.  It had snowed.  He got up and opened his door, and
shuddered.  Ugh! how cold!  All white, with a dark leaden sea, and
black rocks curiously speckled with white.  The foam was no longer
pure.  It seemed dirty.  And the sea ate at the whiteness of the
corpse-like land.  Crumbles of snow were silting down the dead air.</p>

<p>On the ground the snow was a foot deep, white and smooth and soft,
windless.  He took a shovel to clear round his house and shed.  The
pallor of morning darkened.  There was a strange rumbling of far-
off thunder, in the frozen air, and through the newly-falling snow,
a dim flash of lightning.  Snow now fell steadily down, in the
motionless obscurity.</p>

<p>He went out for a few minutes.  But it was difficult.  He stumbled
and fell in the snow, which burned his face.  Weak, faint, he
toiled home.  And when he recovered, he took the trouble to make
hot milk.</p>

<p>It snowed all the time.  In the afternoon again there was a muffled
rumbling of thunder, and flashes of lightning blinking reddish
through the falling snow.  Uneasy, he went to bed and lay staring
fixedly at nothing.</p>

<p>Morning seemed never to come.  An eternity long he lay and waited
for one alleviating pallor on the night.  And at last it seemed the
air was paler.  His house was a cell faintly illuminated with white
light.  He realized the snow was walled outside his window.  He got
up, in the dead cold.  When he opened his door, the motionless snow
stopped him in a wall as high as his breast.  Looking over the top
of it, he felt the dead wind slowly driving, saw the snow-powder
lift and travel like a funeral train.  The blackish sea churned and
champed, seeming to bite at the snow, impotent.  The sky was grey,
but luminous.</p>

<p>He began to work in a frenzy, to get at his boat.  If he was to be
shut in, it must be by his own choice, not by the mechanical power
of the elements.  He must get to the sea.  He must be able to get
at his boat.</p>

<p>But he was weak, and at times the snow overcame him.  It fell on
him, and he lay buried and lifeless.  Yet every time, he struggled
alive before it was too late, and fell upon the snow with the
energy of fever.  Exhausted, he would not give in.  He crept
indoors and made coffee and bacon.  Long since he had cooked so
much.  Then he went at the snow once more.  He must conquer the
snow, this new, white brute force which had accumulated against
him.</p>

<p>He worked in the awful, dead wind, pushing the snow aside, pressing
it with his shovel.  It was cold, freezing hard in the wind, even
when the sun came out for a while, and showed him his white,
lifeless surroundings, the black sea rolling sullen, flecked with
dull spume, away to the horizons.  Yet the sun had power on his
face.  It was March.</p>

<p>He reached the boat.  He pushed the snow away, then sat down under
the lee of the boat, looking at the sea, which nearly swirled to
his feet, in the high tide.  Curiously natural the pebbles looked,
in a world gone all uncanny.  The sun shone no more.  Snow was
falling in hard crumbs, that vanished as if by miracle as they
touched the hard blackness of the sea.  Hoarse waves rang in the
shingle, rushing up at the snow.  The wet rocks were brutally
black.  And all the time the myriad swooping crumbs of snow,
demonish, touched the dark sea and disappeared.</p>

<p>During the night there was a great storm.  It seemed to him he
could hear the vast mass of the snow striking all the world with a
ceaseless thud; and over it all, the wind roared in strange hollow
volleys, in between which came a jump of blindfold lightning, then
the low roll of thunder heavier than the wind.  When at last the
dawn faintly discoloured the dark, the storm had more or less
subsided, but a steady wind drove on.  The snow was up to the top
of his door.</p>

<p>Sullenly, he worked to dig himself out.  And he managed, through
sheer persistency, to get out.  He was in the tail of a great
drift, many feet high.  When he got through, the frozen snow was
not more than two feet deep.  But his island was gone.  Its shape
was all changed, great heaping white hills rose where no hills had
been, inaccessible, and they fumed like volcanoes, but with snow
powder.  He was sickened and overcome.</p>

<p>His boat was in another, smaller drift.  But he had not the
strength to clear it.  He looked at it helplessly.  The shovel
slipped from his hands, and he sank in the snow, to forget.  In the
snow itself, the sea resounded.</p>

<p>Something brought him to.  He crept to his house.  He was almost
without feeling.  Yet he managed to warm himself, just that part of
him which leaned in snow-sleep over the coal fire.  Then again, he
made hot milk.  After which, carefully, he built up the fire.</p>

<p>The wind dropped.  Was it night again?  In the silence, it seemed
he could hear the panther-like dropping of infinite snow.  Thunder
rumbled nearer, crackled quick after the bleared reddened
lightning.  He lay in bed in a kind of stupor.  The elements!  The
elements!  His mind repeated the word dumbly.  You can't win
against the elements.</p>

<p>How long it went on, he never knew.  Once, like a wraith, he got
out, and climbed to the top of a white hill on his unrecognizable
island.  The sun was hot.  &quot;It is summer&quot;, he said to himself, &quot;and
the time of leaves.&quot;  He looked stupidly over the whiteness of his
foreign island, over the waste of the lifeless sea.  He pretended
to imagine he saw the wink of a sail.  Because he knew too well
there would never again be a sail on that stark sea.</p>

<p>As he looked, the sky mysteriously darkened and chilled.  From far
off came the mutter of the unsatisfied thunder, and he knew it was
the signal of the snow rolling over the sea.  He turned, and felt
its breath on him.</p>
