<p>"Maybe it slipped free and floated off," said Chester, who did
not pause until he reached the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Mebbe she climbed out of the river and wint round t'other side
of the blockhouse," suggested Mike, who regretted the next moment
his ill-timed jest and joined Chester, with Alvin only a pace
or two behind them.</p>

<p>There was a brief hope that Chester was right and that the motor
boat had worked free and drifted down stream, but it was quickly
evident that that was impossible. The bow line and anchor would
have held if not disturbed by some one.</p>

<p>Then, too, what meant the muffled exhaust heard a few minutes
before? It could have been caused only by the starting of the
motor. Alvin, who showed quicker wit than his companions, examined
the ground at the water's edge. He quickly read the solution.</p>

<p>"There are the footprints of several people in the soft earth.
All is as plain as day."</p>

<p>"All what?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"The manner of the <em>Deerfoot's</em> going."</p>

<p>"Give us your explanation."</p>

<p>"While we sat behind the blockhouse eating lunch, two or three
or perhaps more persons came out of the woods and walked to this
spot; they cast off the bow line, sprang aboard; one of them drew
the boat out over the stern anchor and tripped it; they did not
start the engine till they had drifted round the bend below; then
they headed for Sheepscot Bay and are well on their way there,
running at full speed as they do not need to spare the launch."</p>

<p>"Bedad! I b'lave ye're right," said Mike, compressing his lips.
"I'm off!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the astonished Captain.</p>

<p>"I'm going to run a race wid the same to Cape Newagen!"</p>

<p>"Why, you have no more chance of overtaking the boat than you
have of out-swimming the <em>Mauretania</em>."</p>

<p>But Mike made no reply. Spitting on his hands and rubbing them
together, he broke into a lope and quickly passed from sight in
the woods.</p>

<p>Despite the alarming situation, Alvin and Chester looked in each
other's face and laughed.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know of anything so crazy?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>"Never; the idea of putting his short legs against a boat that
can run twenty odd miles an hour and has a good start, is worthy
of Mike Murphy alone."</p>

<p>"But we must do something," said the puzzled Alvin; "some one
has stolen the launch and should be headed off."</p>

<p>"How shall we do it?"</p>

<p>"The easiest way is to cross the long bridge to Wiscasset on
the other side of the river and telegraph to different points
down stream."</p>

<p>They were about to start when Alvin said:</p>

<p>"I ought not to have allowed Mike to go off as he did. He is
so rash and headlong that he will be sure to run into trouble.
If we go to Wiscasset, we shall be separated so long that we shall
lose him altogether. If I had only put the switch plug in my pocket
they could not have started the motor without a lot of time and
trouble!"</p>

<p>"Why not follow him down stream?"</p>

<p>"That plan was in my mind. The boat hasn't had time to go far.
Suppose we try Point Quarry. That is the lowest village of Edgecomb
township, where Cross River turns off and runs into the Back River,
which follows the course of the Sheepscot and joins it lower down.
At Point Quarry the stream is so narrow that the <em>Deerfoot</em>
is sure to be seen."</p>

<p>"Provided some one happens to be looking."</p>

<p>"Many of these small places have telegraph lines open in the
summer, but are closed in winter. A road leads from Charmount
to Point Quarry, which isn't more than four or five miles away.
Less than half of that distance will take us to Charmount. Come
on."</p>

<p>The boys lost no time. Both had studied their map so closely
before leaving home and on their way up the Sheepscot that they
had no fear of going astray. The surrounding country is sparsely
settled, with prosperous farms here and there lining the highway.
The walking was good and the sky had cleared within the last few
hours. The lads were athletic, and were impelled by impatience
and resentment toward whoever had taken such a liberty with another's
property.</p>

<p>Two miles took them to a point where a branch road led off at
right angles in the direction of the Sheepscot and consequently
to the meager settlement of Charmount, below the eddy, where a
wooden bridge joins the mainland to Davis Island. They met no
vehicles or footmen, though they passed a number of tidy looking
houses and saw men at work in the fields. Their destination was
less than a mile off and they reached it in due time. They found
a young woman in charge of the telegraph instrument, who in answer
to their inquiry said she could send a message to Point Quarry,
where the station would be closed in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The youths while on the road had formulated what to say by telegraph.
Since they had no acquaintance at either place, Alvin addressed
his inquiry to the operator, who happened also to be a young woman.
This was the message:</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to tell me, if you can, whether a motor
boat has passed down the river within the last few minutes?"</p>

<p>In a brief while, an unexpectedly favorable reply was returned.
It was addressed, however, to the young woman herself, who after
writing it down rose to her feet and called to Alvin.</p>

<p>"Here is your answer. Miss Prentiss says that it isn't her business
to keep watch of boats passing up and down stream, her salary
being so big that she has no time to give attention to anything
except the affairs of her office."</p>

<p>"I suppose that is meant as sarcasm," commented Alvin.</p>

<p>"It does sound like it, but she adds that the fisherman, Pete
Davis, came into the office directly after your message reached
her, and she asked him your question. He told her that such a
boat as you speak of had gone past under full speed only a few
minutes before and he read the name <em>Deerfoot</em> on her bow."</p>

<p>"That's it!" exclaimed Alvin. "Did the fisherman say anything
more?"</p>

<p>"Probably he did, but Miss Prentiss hasn't reported it. Is there
anything further I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;thank you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he passed a half dollar tip to her, whereupon she
beamingly expressed her gratitude. In truth she was so pleased
that she smiled more broadly than ever into the handsome face
of the youth before her. Alvin suspected she was ready for a mild
flirtation, but he was in no mood for such frivolity and was about
to turn away, when Chester spoke in a low voice:</p>

<p>"She has something more to say to you."</p>

<p>"Well?" he remarked inquiringly, returning the sunny gaze of
the young woman.</p>

<p>"Do you know anyone by the name of Mike Murphy?"</p>

<p>Alvin laughed.</p>

<p>"I rather think we do; he came up on the boat with us, and is
rushing down the river in the hope of overtaking it."</p>

<p>"Well, he stopped in here and sent a telegram about it."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Let me see it."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not without an order from court; the rules do not permit anything
of that kind."</p>

<p>"We won't tell anybody."</p>

<p>"I know you won't, for you will never have anything to tell."</p>

<p>She turned and looked down at the last sheet of yellow paper
on her file. Then she grew red in the face and shook with mirth.</p>

<p>"To whom did Mike send his message?"</p>

<p>"I wish I dare tell you; it is the funniest thing that has ever
happened in the office since I have been here. You couldn't guess
in ten years."</p>

<p>"We have hardly that much time to spend in trying, so we shall
have to give it up."</p>

<p>"When you see your friend say to him from me that his message
was forwarded just as he directed."</p>

<p>"Where did he tell you to deliver the reply?"</p>

<p>"He said nothing of that. I have a suspicion that there won't
be any reply to his telegram."</p>

<p>Alvin was turning away again, when the miss, leaning on her desk
and tapping her pretty white teeth with the end of her lead pencil
smilingly asked:</p>

<p>"Would you really like to see Mike Murphy's telegram?"</p>

<p>"It would be of great help to us in our search for the stolen
boat," replied Alvin, stepping closer to her.</p>

<p>Chester remained standing by the outer door, with hands thrust
in his pockets. He read the signs aright.</p>

<p>"She has taken a fancy to him," he reflected, "and as there doesn't
happen to be much business on hand just now is disposed to flirt
a little, but Alvin isn't."</p>

<p>"How much will you pay for a sight of the message?"</p>

<p>"Anything in reason."</p>

<p>"And you will never, never, never tell?"</p>

<p>"I give you my pledge that I will not whisper it to any person."</p>

<p>"How about your friend back there? He has a hangdog look which
I don't like."</p>

<p>"I'll answer for him; there are worse fellows, though not many.
Chester!" commanded Alvin, turning abruptly upon him, "get out
of sight and wait for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," meekly answered the youth, turning about and passing
into the open air, where he added to himself, with a broader grin
than before:</p>

<p>"He doesn't suspect she's kidding him, but that's what she's
doing."</p>

<p>The young Captain beamed upon the miss.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready to have a look at my friend's telegram."</p>

<p>"You haven't said how much you will pay," she replied, with a
coquettish glance at the expectant youth.</p>

<p>"How much do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Is it worth five dollars?"</p>

<p>"That's a pretty big price, but I'll give it."</p>

<p>"It isn't enough."</p>

<p>"Name your charge then."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollars; I can't do it for a cent less."</p>

<p>Alvin read the pert miss aright. He soberly reached into his
pocket and drew out his wallet.</p>

<p>"I haven't that much with me; will you take my promissory note?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but cash goes here."</p>

<p>"Some other day&mdash;good day."</p>

<p>He lifted his cap and passed out doors to join his grinning friend.
The two started off at a brisk pace and had not taken a dozen
steps when they ran straight into trouble.</p>
