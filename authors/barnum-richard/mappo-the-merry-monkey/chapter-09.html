<p>Mappo was so surprised, as he felt himself fairly flying through the
paper hoop, that he did not know exactly what was happening.
</p><p>"I may land on the back of Tum Tum, for all I know," he thought.
</p><p>But, just as he said that to himself, he came down on the back of
Prince, as if nothing had happened.
</p><p>"Hello, here we are again!" cried Prince, running on around the sawdust
ring, with Mappo on his back. "You did that trick all right."
</p><p>"Yes, but the man tossed me through the paper-covered hoop," spoke
Mappo, wonderingly.
</p><p>"That was to show you how to do it," went on Prince. "I have seen many
monkeys do that trick."
</p><p>"Oh, I see," said Mappo. "There's the man with another hoop. Shall I
jump right through it?"
</p><p>"Yes, don't wait for him to toss you," Prince said. "Though he didn't
hurt you, did he?"
</p><p>"Not a bit," laughed Mappo, who rather liked doing that trick.
</p><p>The circus man stood up on a little box, holding the ring, all covered
with red paper, ready for Mappo to jump through. And the man would have
picked Mappo up, and tossed him through the ring, only the monkey did
not wait for that. Instead, he gave a jump himself, and right through
the ring he went, coming down on Prince's back as nicely as you please.
Prince kept right on running around the sawdust ring.
</p><p>"Fine! That's the way to do it!" cried the circus man, clapping his
hands. "I'll have to get you to show the other monkeys how to do it,
Mappo! You're the first monkey who ever learned that trick so quickly."
</p><p>I guess I told you Mappo was a smart little chap.
</p><p>The rest of that day he spent practicing jumping through more
paper-covered hoops, doing some of his jumps from the back of Trotter,
the pony. Then other monkeys were brought in, and they watched Mappo.
</p><p>"Now let's see if they can do it," said the man, after Mappo had done
his trick several times. Well, the other monkeys tried, and while some
of them could do it pretty well, others fell off, or else were afraid
of the paper hoops. No one did it as well as Mappo.
</p><p>From then on, the little monkey learned many circus tricks. He did not
learn all of them as easily as he had learned to ride the dog and pony,
or jump through the hoops. In fact, it took him several days to learn
the trick of turning a somersault. And it took him longer to learn to
sit up at a table, and eat with a knife, fork and spoon, dressed up like
a little boy, with real clothes on.
</p><p>All this while the circus animals had remained in the big, warm barn,
for it was still winter. But spring and summer were coming, and would
soon be over all the land. Then the circus would start out with the
tents, and the big red, green and golden wagons.
</p><p>Other animals were being trained, too. Tum Tum, the jolly elephant could
do many tricks, and Mappo loved to watch his big friend, with the long
trunk, and the long white teeth, or tusks, sticking out of his mouth.
Tum Tum's trainer would sometimes sit on these tusks, or on Tum Tum's
trunk, and ride around the ring. Tum Tum liked his keeper, or trainer,
very much, just as Mappo liked his own circus man.
</p><p>One day, when Mappo had finished doing his tricks for the day, and had
been given a whole, ripe, yellow banana for himself, as a treat for
being good and smart, the little monkey wandered off to another part of
the circus barn. Mappo, unlike the other monkeys, was not kept in a
cage, or chained up.
</p><p>As Mappo was walking along he came underneath a cage, and from over his
head came a loud roar.
</p><p>"A lion!" cried Mappo, springing away. "He'll get me!"
</p><p>In the jungle he and his brothers and sisters had been taught to run and
hide when a lion roared, and, for the moment, Mappo did just as he had
been used to doing in the jungle. Then he sort of laughed to himself, in
a way monkeys have, and he said:
</p><p>"Ha! Ha! That lion can't get at me! He is locked in his cage. I'm not
afraid."
</p><p>But, just the same, Mappo ran over on the other side of the circus barn,
and watched the lion from there.
</p><p>The "King of Beasts," as he is called, though a lion is often no braver
that any other animal, paced back and forth in his cage. He peered out
between the bars, and tried to break them with his big paws. But he
could not. Now and then the lion would utter a deep, loud roar, that
seemed to shake the very ground. I suppose he roared as he had done in
the jungle, when he wanted to let the other animals know he was coming.
A lion must be very proud of his roar.
</p><p>"Well, you can't get me, anyhow," thought Mappo. "You are safe in your
cage, and I am glad of it."
</p><p>"Well, how are you to-day, Tum Tum?" asked Mappo, of the jolly elephant.
</p><p>"Tired. Very tired!" exclaimed Tum Tum.
</p><p>"What makes you tired?" asked the monkey.
</p><p>"Doing so many tricks," the elephant answered. "And you know I am a big,
heavy chap, and it tires me to run fast around the ring. But never mind,
we will soon be out of here, and on a journey."
</p><p>"Where are we going?" asked Mappo.
</p><p>"To travel from town to town, as all circuses do. We shall soon be
living in tents," the elephant answered.
</p><p>"I'll like that," said Mappo. "I am getting rather tired of staying here
so long."
</p><p>And, surely enough, a few days later, the circus started out "on the
road," as it is called. The big red, golden and green wagons were drawn
by many horses, and rumbled up hill and down. In the wagons the animals
and tents and other things, all of which go to make up a circus, were
carried.
</p><p>One day, after a lot of traveling, part of which was by train, Mappo and
the other animals came to a place where a big, white tent was set up in
a wide, green field. The tent had been set up in the night, ready for
the circus.
</p><p>"Ah! Now our real circus work will begin!" said Tum Tum. And so it did.
</p><p>The bands began to play, and when the tent was filled with boys and
girls, and their papas and mammas, and grandpas and grandmas, there was
a grand procession of all the performers. The elephants, of which Tum
Tum was one, also marched around, as did lots of the ponies and dogs.
</p><p>"I wonder when it will come my turn to do tricks?" thought Mappo. His
turn soon came. The kind circus man who had taught the little monkey,
came and dressed him up in a nice red suit, with a little red cap. Then
Prince, the dog, was led in, wearing a fine yellow blanket.
</p><p>"Now for the race!" cried the man, as Mappo jumped up on Prince's back.
The other monkeys jumped up on the backs of other dogs, and, as the band
played, off they ran.
</p><p>Mappo liked it very much, especially when the children laughed and
clapped their hands, for he was glad he had pleased them. Faster and
faster went the racing dogs, and Mappo and Prince won.
</p><p>Then came the jumping through the paper hoops, first from the backs of
dogs, and, afterward backs of the ponies. In all of these tricks
Mappo did very well.
</p><p>[Illustration: He rode around a little wooden platform on the bicycle,
holding a flag over his shoulder. (Page 99)]
</p><p>Then Mappo did his other tricks--turning somersaults, standing on his
head, and even riding a little bicycle the man had made for him. That
was Mappo's best trick, and one that ended his part of the circus. He
rode around a little wooden platform on the bicycle, holding a flag over
his shoulder, and my! how the children did laugh at that.
</p><p>Mappo did not see all the circus. As soon as his act was over, he was
taken back to his cage, but he was not chained up. His keeper knew he
could trust Mappo not to run away.
</p><p>Mappo wandered around the animal tent. After a while he came to where
the tiger's cage stood.
</p><p>"Ah ha! There you are!" snarled Sharp-Tooth, the striped tiger, as he
saw Mappo. "You're the monkey who is to blame for my being here."
</p><p>"I to blame! How?" asked Mappo.
</p><p>"Yes, you are to blame," went on Sharp-Tooth. "You wouldn't open my
cage, and let me out when we were in the jungle. Never mind! I'll fix
you! When I get out of here--and some day I'm going to break loose--when
I get out of here, I'll bite you."
</p><p>"Oh dear!" thought Mappo. "I hope that never happens!" and he went off
to talk to Tum Tum, the jolly elephant.
</p><p>For nearly a week the circus traveled from town to town, Mappo doing his
tricks very well indeed. Once again Sharp-Tooth, the tiger, said to the
monkey chap:
</p><p>"Oh, wait until I get hold of you. I was nearly out of my cage last
night. To-night I'll be out for sure, and then I'll fix you!"
</p><p>Poor Mappo was frightened. The more he thought of the tiger getting
loose and biting him, the more frightened he became. And that day, as
Mappo was riding along in his own cage in the circus wagon, he thought
he heard the tiger getting loose from the big cage.
</p><p>"Oh, he'll get me, sure!" cried Mappo. He looked up. The door of his
cage was open the least little bit. Mappo pulled it open wider with his
paws, and then, when none of the circus men was looking, Mappo slipped
out, and dropped down to the road.
</p><p>The door of his cage snapped shut after Mappo got out, keeping the other
monkeys in.
</p><p>"I'm going to run away," said Mappo. "I'm not going to stay, and let
that bad tiger catch me." And so Mappo ran away.
