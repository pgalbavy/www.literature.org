<p>There is not much more to write of this expedition, or if that statement
be not strictly true, not much more that I wish to write, though I have
no doubt that Ragnall, if he had a mind that way, could make a good and
valuable book concerning many matters on which, confining myself to the
history of our adventure, I have scarcely touched. All the affinities
between this Central African Worship of the Heavenly Child and
its Guardian and that of Horus and Isis in Egypt from which it was
undoubtedly descended, for instance. Also the part which the great
serpent played therein, as it may be seen playing a part in every tomb
upon the Nile, and indeed plays a part in our own and other religions.
Further, our journey across the desert to the Red Sea was very
interesting, but I am tired of describing journeys--and of making them.
</p><p>The truth is that after the death of Hans, like to Queen Sheba when she
had surveyed the wonders of Solomon’s court, there was no more spirit in
me. For quite a long while I did not seem to care at all what happened
to me or to anybody else. We buried him in a place of honour, exactly
where he shot Jana before the gateway of the second court, and when the
earth was thrown over his little yellow face I felt as though half my
past had departed with him into that hole. Poor drunken old Hans, where
in the world shall I find such another man as you were? Where in the
world shall I find so much love as filled the cup of that strange heart
of yours?
</p><p>I dare say it is a form of selfishness, but what every man desires is
something that cares for him <u>alone</u>, which is just why we are so fond
of dogs. Now Hans was a dog with a human brain and he cared for me
alone. Often our vanity makes us think that this has happened to some of
us in the instance of one or more women. But honest and quiet reflection
may well cause us to doubt the truth of such supposings. The woman who
as we believed adored us solely has probably in the course of her career
adored others, or at any rate other things.
</p><p>To take but one instance, that of Mameena, the Zulu lady whom Hans
thought he saw in the Shades. She, I believe, did me the honour to be
very fond of me, but I am convinced that she was fonder still of her
ambition. Now Hans never cared for any living creature, or for any human
hope or object, as he cared for me. There was no man or woman whom
he would not have cheated, or even murdered for my sake. There was no
earthly advantage, down to that of life itself, that he would not, and
in the end did not forgo for my sake; witness the case of his little
fortune which he invested in my rotten gold mine and thought nothing of
losing--for my sake.
</p><p>That is love <u>in excelsis</u>, and the man who has succeeded in inspiring
it in any creature, even in a low, bibulous, old Hottentot, may feel
proud indeed. At least I am proud and as the years go by the pride
increases, as the hope grows that somewhere in the quiet of that great
plain which he saw in his dream, I may find the light of Hans’s love
burning like a beacon in the darkness, as he promised I should do, and
that it may guide and warm my shivering, new-born soul before I dare the
adventure of the Infinite.
</p><p>Meanwhile, since the sublime and the ridiculous are so very near akin,
I often wonder how he and Mameena settled that question of her right to
the royal salute. Perhaps I shall learn one day--indeed already I have
had a hint of it. If so, even in the blaze of a new and universal Truth,
I am certain that their stories will differ wildly.
</p>
<p>Hans was quite right about the Black Kendah. They cleared out, probably
in search of food, where I do not know and I do not care, though whether
this were a temporary or permanent move on their part remains, and so
far as I am concerned is likely to remain, veiled in obscurity. They
were great blackguards, though extraordinarily fine soldiers, and what
became of them is a matter of complete indifference to me. One thing is
certain, however, a very large percentage of them never migrated at all,
for something over three thousand of their bodies did our people have to
bury in the pass and about the temple, a purpose for which all the pits
and trenches we had dug came in very useful. Our loss, by the way, was
five hundred and three, including those who died of wounds. It was a
great fight and, except for those who perished in the pitfalls during
the first rush, all practically hand to hand.
</p><p>Jana we interred where he fell because we could not move him, within a
few feet of the body of his slayer Hans. I have always regretted that
I did not take the exact measurements of this brute, as I believe the
record elephant of the world, but I had no time to do so and no rule or
tape at hand. I only saw him for a minute on the following morning, just
as he was being tumbled into a huge hole, together with the remains of
his master, Simba the King. I found, however, that the sole wounds upon
him, save some cuts and scratches from spears, were those inflicted by
Hans--namely, the loss of one eye, the puncture through the skin over
the heart made when he shot at him for the second time with the little
rifle Intombi, and two neat holes at the back of the mouth through which
the bullets from the elephant gun had driven upwards to the base of the
brain, causing his death from hæmorrhage on that organ.
</p><p>I asked the White Kendah to give me his two enormous tusks, unequalled,
I suppose, in size and weight in Africa, although one was deformed
and broken. But they refused. These, I presume, they wished to keep,
together with the chains off his breast and trunk, as mementoes of their
victory over the god of their foes. At any rate they hewed the former
out with axes and removed the latter before tumbling the carcass into
the grave. From the worn-down state of the teeth I concluded that this
beast must have been extraordinarily old, how old it is impossible to
say.
</p><p>That is all I have to tell of Jana. May he rest in peace, which
certainly he will not do if Hans dwells anywhere in his neighbourhood,
in the region which the old boy used to call that of the “fires that
do not go out.” Because of my horrible failure in connection with this
beast, the very memory of which humiliates me, I do not like to think of
it more than I can help.
</p><p>For the rest the White Kendah kept faith with us in every particular. In
a curious and semi-religious ceremony, at which I was not present, Lady
Ragnall was absolved from her high office of Guardian or Nurse to a god
whereof the symbol no longer existed, though I believe that the priests
collected the tiny fragments of ivory, or as many of them as could be
found, and preserved them in a jar in the sanctuary. After this had
been done women stripped the Nurse of her hallowed robes, of the ancient
origin of which, by the way, I believe that none of them, except perhaps
Harût, had any idea, any more than they knew that the Child represented
the Egyptian Horus and his lady Guardian the moon-goddess Isis. Then,
dressed in some native garments, she was handed over to Ragnall and
thenceforth treated as a stranger-guest, like ourselves, being allowed,
however, to live with her husband in the same house that she had
occupied during all the period of her strange captivity. Here they abode
together, lost in the mutual bliss of this wonderful reunion to which
they had attained through so much bodily and spiritual darkness and
misery, until a month or so later we started upon our journey across the
mountains and the great desert that lay beyond them.
</p><p>Only once did I find any real opportunity of private conversation with
Lady Ragnall.
</p><p>This happened after her husband had recovered from the hurts he received
in the battle, on an occasion when he was obliged to separate from her
for a day in order to attend to some matter in the Town of the Child.
I think it had to do with the rifles used in the battle, which he had
presented to the White Kendah. So, leaving me to look after her, he
went, unwillingly enough, who seemed to hate losing sight of his wife
even for an hour.
</p><p>I took her for a walk in the wood, to that very point indeed on the lip
of the crater whence we had watched her play her part as priestess at
the Feast of the First-fruits. After we had stood there a while we went
down among the great cedars, trying to retrace the last part of our
march through the darkness of that anxious night, whereof now for the
first time I told her all the story.
</p><p>Growing tired of scrambling among the fallen boughs, at length Lady
Ragnall sat down and said:
</p><p>“Do you know, Mr. Quatermain, these are the first words we have really
had since that party at Ragnall before I was married, when, as you may
have forgotten, you took me in to dinner.”
</p><p>I replied that there was nothing I recollected much more clearly, which
was both true and the right thing to say, or so I supposed.
</p><p>“Well,” she said slowly, “you see that after all there was something in
those fancies of mine which at the time you thought would best be dealt
with by a doctor--about Africa and the rest, I mean.”
</p><p>“Yes, Lady Ragnall, though of course we should always remember that
coincidence accounts for many things. In any case they are done with
now.”
</p><p>“Not quite, Mr. Quatermain, even as you mean, since we have still a long
way to go. Also in another sense I believe that they are but begun.”
</p><p>“I do not understand, Lady Ragnall.”
</p><p>“Nor do I, but listen. You know that of anything which happened during
those months I have no memory at all, except of that one dream when I
seemed to see George and Savage in the hut. I remember my baby being
killed by that horrible circus elephant, just as the Ivory Child was
killed or rather destroyed by Jana, which I suppose is another of your
coincidences, Mr. Quatermain. After that I remember nothing until I woke
up and saw George standing in front of me covered with blood, and you,
and Jana dead, and the rest.”
</p><p>“Because during that time your mind was gone, Lady Ragnall.”
</p><p>“Yes, but where had it gone? I tell you, Mr. Quatermain, that although
I remember nothing of what was passing about me then, I do remember a
great deal of what seemed to be passing either long ago or in some time
to come, though I have said nothing of it to George, as I hope you will
not either. It might upset him.”
</p><p>“What do you remember?” I asked.
</p><p>“That’s the trouble; I can’t tell you. What was once very clear to me
has for the most part become vague and formless. When my mind tries to
grasp it, it slips away. It was another life to this, quite a different
life; and there was a great story in it of which I think what we have
been going through is either a sequel or a prologue. I see, or saw,
cities and temples with people moving about them, George and you among
them, also that old priest, Harût. You will laugh, but my recollection
is that you stood in some relationship to me, either that of father or
brother.”
</p><p>“Or perhaps a cousin,” I suggested.
</p><p>“Or perhaps a cousin,” she repeated, smiling, “or a great friend; at any
rate something very intimate. As for George, I don’t know what he was,
or Harût either. But the odd thing is that little yellow man, Hans, whom
I only saw once living for a few minutes that I can remember, comes more
clearly back to my mind than any of you. He was a dwarf, much stouter
than when I saw him the other day, but very like. I recall him curiously
dressed with feathers and holding an ivory rod, seated upon a stool
at the feet of a great personage--a king, I think. The king asked him
questions, and everyone listened to his answers. That is all, except
that the scenes seemed to be flooded with sunlight.”
</p><p>“Which is more than this place is. I think we had better be moving, Lady
Ragnall, or you will catch a chill under these damp cedars.”
</p><p>I said this because I did not wish to pursue the conversation. I
considered it too exciting under all her circumstances, especially as I
perceived that mystical look gathering on her face and in her beautiful
eyes, which I remembered noting before she was married.
</p><p>She read my thoughts and answered with a laugh:
</p><p>“Yes, it is damp; but you know I am very strong and damp will not hurt
me. For the rest you need not be afraid, Mr. Quatermain. I did not lose
my mind. It was taken from me by some power and sent to live elsewhere.
Now it has been given back and I do not think it will be taken again in
that way.”
</p><p>“Of course it won’t,” I exclaimed confidently. “Whoever dreamed of such
a thing?”
</p><p>“<u>You</u> did,” she answered, looking me in the eyes. “Now before we go I
want to say one more thing. Harût and the head priestess have made me a
present. They have given me a box full of that herb they called tobacco,
but of which I have discovered the real name is Taduki. It is the same
that they burned in the bowl when you and I saw visions at Ragnall
Castle, which visions, Mr. Quatermain, by another of your coincidences,
have since been translated into facts.”
</p><p>“I know. We saw you breathe that smoke again as priestess when you
uttered the prophecy as Oracle of the Child at the Feast of the
First-fruits. But what are you going to do with this stuff, Lady
Ragnall? I think you have had enough of visions just at present.”
</p><p>“So do I, though to tell you the truth I like them. I am going to keep
it and do nothing--as yet. Still, I want you always to remember one
thing--don’t laugh at me”--here again she looked me in the eyes--“that
there is a time coming, some way off I think, when I and you--no one
else, Mr. Quatermain--will breathe that smoke again together and see
strange things.”
</p><p>“No, no!” I replied, “I have given up tobacco of the Kendah variety; it
is too strong for me.”
</p><p>“Yes, yes!” she said, “for something that is stronger than the Kendah
tobacco will make you do it--when I wish.”
</p><p>“Did Harût tell you that, Lady Ragnall?”
</p><p>“I don’t know,” she answered confusedly. “I think the Ivory Child
told me; it used to talk to me often. You know that Child isn’t really
destroyed. Like my reason that seemed to be lost, it has only gone
backwards or forwards where you and I shall see it again. You and I and
no others--unless it be the little yellow man. I repeat that I do not
know when that will be. Perhaps it is written in those rolls of papyrus,
which they have given me also, because they said they belonged to me
who am ‘the first priestess and the last.’ They told me, however, or
perhaps,” she added, passing her hand across her forehead, “it was the
Child who told me, that I was not to attempt to read them or have them
read, until after a great change in my life. What the change will be I
do not know.”
</p><p>“And had better not inquire, Lady Ragnall, since in this world most
changes are for the worse.”
</p><p>“I agree, and shall not inquire. Now I have spoken to you like this
because I felt that I must do so. Also I want to thank you for all you
have done for me and George. Probably we shall not talk in such a way
again; as I am situated the opportunity will be lacking, even if the
wish is present. So once more I thank you from my heart. Until we meet
again--I mean really meet--good-bye,” and she held her right hand to me
in such a fashion that I knew she meant me to kiss it.
</p><p>This I did very reverently and we walked back to the temple almost in
silence.
</p>
<p>That month of rest, or rather the last three weeks of it, since for the
first few days after the battle I was quite prostrate, I occupied in
various ways, amongst others in a journey with Harût to Simba Town. This
we made after our spies had assured us that the Black Kendah were
really gone somewhere to the south-west, in which direction fertile and
unoccupied lands were said to exist about three hundred miles away. It
was with very strange feelings that I retraced our road and looked once
more upon that wind-bent tree still scored with the marks of Jana’s
huge tusk, in the boughs of which Hans and I had taken refuge from the
monster’s fury. Crossing the river, quite low now, I travelled up the
slope down which we raced for our lives and came to the melancholy lake
and the cemetery of dead elephants.
</p><p>Here all was unchanged. There was the little mount worn by his feet, on
which Jana was wont to stand. There were the rocks behind which I had
tried to hide, and near to them some crushed human bones which I knew to
be those of the unfortunate Marût. These we buried with due reverence on
the spot where he had fallen, I meanwhile thanking God that my own bones
were not being interred at their side, as but for Hans would have been
the case--if they were ever interred at all. All about lay the skeletons
of dead elephants, and from among these we collected as much of the best
ivory as we could carry, namely about fifty camel loads. Of course there
was much more, but a great deal of the stuff had been exposed for so
long to sun and weather that it was almost worthless.
</p><p>Having sent this ivory back to the Town of the Child, which was being
rebuilt after a fashion, we went on to Simba Town through the forest,
dispatching pickets ahead of us to search and make sure that it was
empty. Empty it was indeed; never did I see such a place of desolation.
</p><p>The Black Kendah had left it just as it stood, except for a pile of
corpses which lay around and over the altar in the market-place, where
the three poor camelmen were sacrificed to Jana, doubtless those of
wounded men who had died during or after the retreat. The doors of the
houses stood open, many domestic articles, such as great jars resembling
that which had been set over the head of the dead man whom we were
commanded to restore life, and other furniture lay about because they
could not be carried away. So did a great quantity of spears and various
weapons of war, whose owners being killed would never want them again.
Except a few starved dogs and jackals no living creature remained in the
town. It was in its own way as waste and even more impressive than the
graveyard of elephants by the lonely lake.
</p><p>“The curse of the Child worked well,” said Harût to me grimly. “First,
the storm; the hunger; then the battle; and now the misery of flight and
ruin.”
</p><p>“It seems so,” I answered. “Yet that curse, like others, came back to
roost, for if Jana is dead and his people fled, where are the Child and
many of its people? What will you do without your god, Harût?”
</p><p>“Repent us of our sins and wait till the Heavens send us another, as
doubtless they will in their own season,” he replied very sadly.
</p><p>I wonder whether they ever did and, if so, what form that new divinity
put on.
</p><p>I slept, or rather did not sleep, that night in the same guest-house in
which Marût and I had been imprisoned during our dreadful days of fear,
reconstructing in my mind every event connected with them. Once more I
saw the fires of sacrifice flaring upon the altar and heard the roar of
the dancing hail that proclaimed the ruin of the Black Kendah as loudly
as the trumpet of a destroying angel. Very glad was I when the morning
came at length and, having looked my last upon Simba Town, I crossed
the moats and set out homewards through the forest whereof the stripped
boughs also spoke of death, though in the spring these would grow green
again.
</p><p>Ten days later we started from the Holy Mount, a caravan of about a
hundred camels, of which fifty were laden with the ivory and the rest
ridden by our escort under the command of Harût and our three selves.
But there was an evil fate upon this ivory, as on everything else that
had to do with Jana. Some weeks later in the desert a great sandstorm
overtook us in which we barely escaped with our lives. At the height of
the storm the ivory-laden camels broke loose, flying before it. Probably
they fell and were buried beneath the sand; at any rate of the fifty we
only recovered ten.
</p><p>Ragnall wished to pay me the value of the remaining loads, which ran
into thousands of pounds, but I would not take the money, saying it
was outside our bargain. Sometimes since then I have thought that I
was foolish, especially when on glancing at that codicil to his will in
after days, the same which he had given me before the battle, I found
that he had set me down for a legacy of £10,000. But in such matters
every man must follow his own instinct.
</p><p>The White Kendah, an unemotional people especially now when they were
mourning for their lost god and their dead, watched us go without any
demonstration of affection, or even of farewell. Only those priestesses
who had attended upon the person of Lady Ragnall while she played a
divine part among them wept when they parted from her, and uttered
prayers that they might meet her again “in the presence of the Child.”
</p><p>The pass through the great mountains proved hard to climb, as the
foothold for the camels was bad. But we managed it at last, most of the
way on foot, pausing a little while on their crest to look our last for
ever at the land which we had left, where the Mount of the Child was
still dimly visible. Then we descended their farther slope and entered
the northern desert.
</p><p>Day after day and week after week we travelled across that endless
desert by a way known to Harût on which water could be found, the only
living things in all its vastness, meeting with no accidents save that
of the sandstorm in which the ivory was lost. I was much alone during
that time, since Harût spoke little and Ragnall and his wife were
wrapped up in each other.
</p><p>At length, months later, we struck a little port on the Red Sea, of
which I forget the Arab name, a place as hot as the infernal regions.
Shortly afterwards, by great good luck, two trading vessels put in for
water, one bound for Aden, in which I embarked en route for Natal, and
the other for the port of Suez, whence Ragnall and his wife could travel
overland to Alexandria.
</p><p>Our parting was so hurried at the last, as is often the way after long
fellowship, that beyond mutual thanks and good wishes we said little
to one another. I can see them now standing with their arms about each
other watching me disappear. Concerning their future there is so much
to tell that of it I shall say nothing; at any rate here and now, except
that Lady Ragnall was right. We did not part for the last time.
</p><p>As I shook old Harût’s hand in farewell he told me that he was going on
to Egypt, and I asked him why.
</p><p>“Perchance to look for another god, Lord Macumazana,” he answered
gravely, “whom now there is no Jana to destroy. We may speak of that
matter if we should meet again.”
</p><p>Such are some of the things that I remember about this journey, but to
tell truth I paid little attention to them and many others.
</p><p>For oh! my heart was sore because of Hans.
