<P>As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk. The four friends
appeared to be entire strangers to one another and
indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king.
They withdrew to a private house, and as they had reason
every moment to fear for their safety, they occupied but one
room and provided an exit, which might be useful in case of
an attack. The lackeys were sent to their several posts,
except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the
doorway.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have
lost his usual loquacity. Porthos, who could never see
anything that was not self-evident, talked to him as usual.
He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked
significantly at one another.</P>
<P>Next morning D'Artagnan was the first to rise. He had been
down to the stables, already taken a look at the horses and
given the necessary orders for the day, whilst Athos and
Aramis were still in bed and Porthos snoring.</P>
<P>At eight o'clock the march was resumed in the same order as
the night before, except that D'Artagnan left his friends
and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already
struck up with Monsieur Groslow.</P>
<P>Groslow, whom D'Artagnan's praises had greatly pleased,
welcomed him with a gracious smile.</P>
<P>&quot;Really, sir,&quot; D'Artagnan said to him, &quot;I am pleased to find
one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue. My friend,
Monsieur du Vallon, is of a very melancholy disposition, so
much so, that one can scarcely get three words out of him
all day. As for our two prisoners, you can imagine that they
are but little in the vein for conversation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are hot royalists,&quot; said Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;The more reason they should be sulky with us for having
captured the Stuart, for whom, I hope, you're preparing a
pretty trial.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why,&quot; said Groslow, &quot;that is just what we are taking him to
London for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you never by any chance lose sight of him, I presume?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should think not, indeed. You see he has a truly royal
escort.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ay, there's no fear in the daytime; but at night?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We redouble our precautions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And what method of surveillance do you employ?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eight men remain constantly in his room.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce, he is well guarded, then. But besides these
eight men, you doubtless place some guard outside?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, no! Just think. What would you have two men without
arms do against eight armed men?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Two men  -  how do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, the king and his lackey.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! then they allow the lackey to remain with him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented. Under
pretense that he's a king it appears he cannot dress or
undress without assistance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really, captain,&quot; said D'Artagnan, determined to continue
on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced, &quot;the more I
listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and
elegant manner in which you speak French. You have lived
three years in Paris? May I ask what you were doing there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My father, who is a merchant, placed me with his
correspondent, who in turn sent his son to join our house in
London.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Were you pleased with Paris, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but you are much in want of a revolution like our own
 -  not against your king, who is a mere child, but against
that lazar of an Italian, the queen's favorite.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! I am quite of your opinion, sir, and we should soon
make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like
yourself, without prejudices, vigilant and incorruptible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said the officer, &quot;I thought you were in his service
and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is to say I am in the king's service, and that knowing
he wanted to send some one to England, I solicited the
appointment, so great was my desire to know the man of
genius who now governs the three kingdoms. So that when he
proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England
you see how we snapped up the proposition.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On his right and left, sir. Ah! there's another brave and
excellent young man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know him?&quot; asked the officer.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, very well. Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from
France with him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It appears, too, you kept him waiting a long time at
Boulogne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have? I was like you, and had a king in
keeping.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aha!&quot; said Groslow; &quot;what king?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Our own, to be sure, the little one  -  Louis XIV.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And how long had you to take care of him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Three nights; and, by my troth, I shall always remember
those three nights with a certain pleasure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How do you mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I mean that my friends, officers in the guards and
mousquetaires, came to keep me company and we passed the
night in feasting, drinking, dicing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah true,&quot; said the Englishman, with a sigh; &quot;you Frenchmen
are born boon companions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And don't you play, too, when you are on guard?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never,&quot; said the Englishman.</P>
<P>&quot;In that case you must be horribly bored, and have my
sympathy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The fact is, I look to my turn for keeping guard with
horror. It's tiresome work to keep awake a whole night.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but with a jovial partner and dice, and guineas
clinking on the cloth, the night passes like a dream. You
don't like playing, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On the contrary, I do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lansquenet, for instance?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Devoted to it. I used to play almost every night in
France.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And since your return to England?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have not handled a card or dice-box.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I sincerely pity you,&quot; said D'Artagnan, with an air of
profound compassion.</P>
<P>&quot;Look here,&quot; said the Englishman.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow I am on guard.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In Stuart's room?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; come and pass the night with me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible! why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night. Sometimes we
don't go to bed at all!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, what of that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, he would be annoyed if I did not play with him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Does he play well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles,
laughing all the while till the tears rolled down.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bring him with you, then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But how about our prisoners?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let your servants guard them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and give them a chance of escaping,&quot; said D'Artagnan.
&quot;Why, one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other
a knight of Malta, of noble family. We have arranged the
ransom of each of them  -  2,000 on arriving in France. We
are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our
lackeys know to be millionaires. It is true we plundered
them a little when we took them, and I will even confess
that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on
in our nightly play. Still, they may have concealed some
precious stone, some valuable diamond; so that we are like
those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their
treasures. We have made ourselves the constant guardians of
our men, and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;You see, then, why I must decline your polite invitation,
which is especially attractive to me, because nothing is so
wearisome as to play night after night with the same person;
the chances always balance and at the month's end nothing is
gained or lost.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Groslow, sighing; &quot;there is something still more
wearisome, and that is not to play at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I can understand that,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;But, come,&quot; resumed the Englishman, &quot;are these men of yours
dangerous?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In what respect?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are they capable of attempting violence?&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan burst out laughing at the idea.</P>
<P>&quot;Jesus Dieu!&quot; he cried; &quot;one of them is trembling with
fever, having failed to adapt himself to this charming
country of yours, and the other is a knight of Malta, as
timid as a young girl; and for greater security we have
taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Groslow, &quot;bring them with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But really  -  -  &quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;I have eight men on guard, you know. Four of them can guard
the king and the other four your prisoners. I'll manage it
somehow, you will see.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;now I think of it  -  what is to
prevent our beginning to-night?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing at all,&quot; said Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;Just so. Come to us this evening and to-morrow we'll return
your visit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Capital! This evening with you, to-morrow at Stuart's, the
next day with me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see, that with a little forethought one can lead a
merry life anywhere and everywhere,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, with Frenchmen, and Frenchmen like you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And Monsieur du Vallon,&quot; added the other. &quot;You will see
what a fellow he is; a man who nearly killed Mazarin between
two doors. They employ him because they are afraid of him.
Ah, there he is calling me now. You'll excuse me, I know.&quot;</P>
<P>They exchanged bows and D'Artagnan returned to his
companions.</P>
<P>&quot;What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog?&quot;
exclaimed Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;My dear fellow, don't speak like that of Monsieur Groslow.
He's one of my most intimate friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One of your friends!&quot; cried Porthos, &quot;this butcher of
unarmed farmers!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush! my dear Porthos. Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather
hasty, it's true, but at bottom I have discovered two good
qualities in him  -  he is conceited and stupid.&quot;</P>
<P>Porthos opened his eyes in amazement; Athos and Aramis
looked at one another and smiled; they knew D'Artagnan, and
knew that he did nothing without a purpose.</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;you shall judge of him for
yourself. He is coming to play with us this evening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oho!&quot; said Porthos, his eyes glistening at the news. &quot;Is he
rich?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He's the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And knows lansquenet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Adores it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Basset?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;His mania.'</P>
<P>&quot;Biribi?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Revels in it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;we shall pass an agreeable evening.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The more so, as it will be the prelude to a better.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We invite him to play to-night; he has invited us in return
to-morrow. But wait. To-night we stop at Derby; and if there
is a bottle of wine in the town let Musqueton buy it. It
will be well to prepare a light supper, of which you, Athos
and Aramis, are not to partake  -  Athos, because I told him
you had a fever; Aramis, because you are a knight of Malta
and won't mix with fellows like us. Do you understand?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's no doubt very fine,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;but deuce take
me if I understand at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Porthos, my friend, you know I am descended on the father's
side from the Prophets and on the mother's from the Sybils,
and that I only speak in parables and riddles. Let those who
have ears hear and those who have eyes see; I can tell you
nothing more at present.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go ahead, my friend,&quot; said Athos; &quot;I am sure that whatever
you do is well done.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you, Aramis, are you of that opinion?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Entirely so, my dear D'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very good,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;here indeed are true
believers; it is a pleasure to work miracles before them;
they are not like that unbelieving Porthos, who must see and
touch before he will believe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The fact is,&quot; said Porthos, with an air of finesse, &quot;I am
rather incredulous.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder, and as
they had reached the station where they were to breakfast,
the conversation ended there.</P>
<P>At five in the evening they sent Musqueton on before as
agreed upon. Blaisois went with him.</P>
<P>In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends
perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome
house. It was there a lodging was prepared for them.</P>
<P>At the hour agreed upon Groslow came. D'Artagnan received
him as he would have done a friend of twenty years'
standing. Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled
when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had
administered to Parry's brother, he was not nearly so strong
as himself. Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they
could the disgust they felt in the presence of such
coarseness and brutality.</P>
<P>In short, Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception.</P>
<P>Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role. At midnight
they withdrew to their chamber, the door of which was left
open on the pretext of kindly consideration. Furthermore,
D'Artagnan went with them, leaving Porthos at play with
Groslow.</P>
<P>Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow, and found him a
more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him
to be.</P>
<P>As to Groslow, he promised himself that on the following
evening he would recover from D'Artagnan what he had lost to
Porthos, and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his
appointment.</P>
<P>The next day was spent as usual. D'Artagnan went from
Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel
Harrison to his friends. To any one not acquainted with him
he seemed to be in his normal condition; but to his friends
 -  to Athos and Aramis  -  was apparent a certain
feverishness in his gayety.</P>
<P>&quot;What is he contriving?&quot; asked Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>Porthos said nothing, but he handled in his pocket the fifty
pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of
satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing.</P>
<P>Arrived at Ryston, D'Artagnan assembled his friends. His
face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn
like a mask the whole day. Athos pinched Aramis's hand.</P>
<P>&quot;The moment is at hand,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned D'Artagnan, who had overheard him,
&quot;to-night, gentlemen, we rescue the king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan,&quot; said Athos, &quot;this is no joke, I trust? It
would quite cut me up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are a very odd man, Athos,&quot; he replied, &quot;to doubt me
thus. Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend's
heart and a king's life? I have told you, and I repeat it,
that to-night we rescue Charles I. You left it to me to
discover the means and I have done so.&quot;</P>
<P>Porthos looked at D'Artagnan with an expression of profound
admiration. Aramis smiled as one who hopes. Athos was pale,
and trembled in every limb.</P>
<P>&quot;Speak,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;We are invited,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;to pass the night
with M. Groslow. But do you know where?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the king's room.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The king's room?&quot; cried Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, gentlemen, in the king's room. Groslow is on guard
there this evening, and to pass the time away he has invited
us to keep him company.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All four of us?&quot; asked Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Pardieu! certainly, all four; we couldn't leave our
prisoners, could we?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Tell us about it,&quot; said Athos, palpitating.</P>
<P>&quot;We are going, then, we two with our swords, you with
daggers. We four have got to master these eight fools and
their stupid captain. Monsieur Porthos, what do you say to
that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say it is easy enough,&quot; answered Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;We dress the king in Groslow's clothes. Musqueton, Grimaud
and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first
street. We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues
distant.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos placed his two hands on D'Artagnan's shoulders, and
gazed at him with his calm, sad smile.</P>
<P>&quot;I declare, my friend,&quot; said he, &quot;that there is not a
creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in
courage. Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows,
which you couldn't share without crime, you alone among us
have discovered what we were searching for in vain. I repeat
it, D'Artagnan, you are the best one among us; I bless and
love you, my dear son.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And to think that I couldn't find that out,&quot; said Porthos,
scratching his head; &quot;it is so simple.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;if I understand rightly we are to kill
them all, eh?&quot;</P>
<P>Athos shuddered and turned pale.</P>
<P>&quot;Mordioux!&quot; answered D'Artagnan, &quot;I believe we must. I
confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us see,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;how are we to act?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have arranged two plans. Firstly, at a given signal,
which shall be the words `At last,' you each plunge a dagger
into the heart of the soldier nearest to you. We, on our
side, do the same. That will be four killed. We shall then
be matched, four against the remaining five. If these five
men give themselves up we gag them; if they resist, we kill
them. If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and
receives only Porthos and myself, why, then, we must resort
to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one.
It will take a little longer time and may make a greater
disturbance, but you will be outside with swords and will
rush in at the proper time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But if you yourselves should be struck?&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible!&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;those beer drinkers are too
clumsy and awkward. Besides, you will strike at the throat,
Porthos; it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;it will be a nice little throat
cutting.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Horrible, horrible,&quot; exclaimed Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;you would do as much, Mr.
Humanity, in a battle. But if you think the king's life is
not worth what it must cost there's an end of the matter and
I send to Groslow to say I am ill.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, you are right,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow
was waiting for them.</P>
<P>&quot;Where?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar,&quot; replied the
staunch Puritan.</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; replied Athos, whose blood mounted to his face at
the insult offered to royalty; &quot;tell the captain we are
coming.&quot;</P>
<P>The Puritan then went out. The lackeys had been ordered to
saddle eight horses and to wait, keeping together and
without dismounting, at the corner of a street about twenty
steps from the house where the king was lodged.</P>
<P>It was nine o'clock in the evening; the sentinels had been
relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for
an hour. D'Artagnan and Porthos, armed with their swords,
and Athos and Aramis, each carrying a concealed poniard,
approached the house which for the time being was Charles
Stuart's prison. The two latter followed their captors in
the humble guise of captives, without arms.</P>
<P>&quot;Od's bodikins,&quot; said Groslow, as the four friends entered,
&quot;I had almost given you up.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear:</P>
<P>&quot;The fact is, we, that is, Monsieur du Vallon and I,
hesitated a little.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And why?&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Aha,&quot; said Groslow; &quot;on account of political opinions? No
matter. On the contrary,&quot; he added, laughing, &quot;if they want
to see their Stuart they shall see him.</P>
<P>&quot;Are we to pass the night in the king's room?&quot; asked
D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;No, but in the one next to it, and as the door will remain
open it comes to the same thing. Have you provided yourself
with money? I assure you I intend to play the devil's game
to-night.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets.</P>
<P>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Groslow, and opened the door of the room.
&quot;I will show you the way,&quot; and he went in first.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan turned to look at his friends. Porthos was
perfectly indifferent; Athos, pale, but resolute; Aramis was
wiping a slight moisture from his brow.</P>
<P>The eight guards were at their posts. Four in the king's
room, two at the door between the rooms and two at that by
which the friends had entered. Athos smiled when he saw
their bare swords; he felt it was no longer to be a
butchery, but a fight, and he resumed his usual good humor.</P>
<P>Charles was perceived through the door, lying dressed upon
his bed, at the head of which Parry was seated, reading in a
low voice a chapter from the Bible.</P>
<P>A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the
handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his
faithful retainer, far less calm.</P>
<P>From time to time Parry stopped, thinking the king, whose
eyes were closed, was really asleep, but Charles would open
his eyes and say with a smile:</P>
<P>&quot;Go on, my good Parry, I am listening.&quot;</P>
<P>Groslow advanced to the door of the king's room, replaced on
his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests,
looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple, yet
touching scene, then turning to D'Artagnan, assumed an air
of triumph at what he had achieved.</P>
<P>&quot;Capital!&quot; cried the Gascon, &quot;you would make a distinguished
general.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And do you think,&quot; asked Groslow, &quot;that Stuart will ever
escape while I am on guard?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, to be sure,&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;unless, forsooth, the
sky rains friends upon him.&quot;</P>
<P>Groslow's face brightened.</P>
<P>It is impossible to say whether Charles, who kept his eyes
constantly closed, had noticed the insolence of the Puritan
captain, but the moment he heard the clear tone of
D'Artagnan's voice his eyelids rose, in spite of himself.</P>
<P>Parry, too, started and stopped reading.</P>
<P>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; said the king; &quot;go on, my
good Parry, unless you are tired.&quot;</P>
<P>Parry resumed his reading.</P>
<P>On a table in the next room were lighted candles, cards, two
dice-boxes, and dice.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Groslow, &quot;I beg you will take your places.
I will sit facing Stuart, whom I like so much to see,
especially where he now is, and you, Monsieur d'Artagnan,
opposite to me.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos turned red with rage. D'Artagnan frowned at him.</P>
<P>&quot;That's it,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;you, Monsieur le Comte de la
Fere, to the right of Monsieur Groslow. You, Chevalier
d'Herblay, to his left. Du Vallon next me. You'll bet for me
and those gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow.&quot;</P>
<P>By this arrangement D'Artagnan could nudge Porthos with his
knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis.</P>
<P>At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier d'Herblay,
Charles opened his eyes, and raising his noble head, in
spite of himself, threw a glance at all the actors in the
scene.</P>
<P>At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible
and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah:</P>
<P>&quot;God said, `Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants,
whom I have sent unto you.&quot;</P>
<P>The four friends exchanged glances. The words that Parry had
read assured them that their presence was understood by the
king and was assigned to its real motive. D'Artagnan's eyes
sparkled with joy.</P>
<P>&quot;You asked me just now if I was in funds,&quot; said D'Artagnan,
placing some twenty pistoles upon the table. &quot;Well, in my
turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure,
my dear Monsieur Groslow, for I can tell you we shall not
leave this without robbing you of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not without my defending it,&quot; said Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better,&quot; said D'Artagnan. &quot;Fight, my dear
captain, fight. You know or you don't know, that that is
what we ask of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; said Groslow, bursting with his usual coarse
laugh, &quot;I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and
bruises.&quot;</P>
<P>Charles had heard and understood it all. A slight color
mounted to his cheeks. The soldiers then saw him stretch his
limbs, little by little, and under the pretense of much heat
throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him.</P>
<P>Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king
was lying with his clothes on.</P>
<P>The game began. The luck had turned, and Groslow, having won
some hundred pistoles, was in the merriest possible humor.</P>
<P>Porthos, who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the
night before and thirty more besides, was very cross and
questioned D'Artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether
it would not soon be time to change the game. Athos and
Aramis looked at him inquiringly. But D'Artagnan remained
impassible.</P>
<P>It struck ten. They heard the guard going its rounds.</P>
<P>&quot;How many rounds do they make a night?&quot; asked D'Artagnan,
drawing more pistoles from his pocket.</P>
<P>&quot;Five,&quot; answered Groslow, &quot;one every two hours.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first
time replied to Porthos's nudge of the knee by a nudge
responsive. Meanwhile, the soldiers whose duty it was to
remain in the king's room, attracted by that love of play so
powerful in all men, had stolen little by little toward the
table, and standing on tiptoe, lounged, watching the game,
over the shoulders of D'Artagnan and Porthos. Those on the
other side had followed their example, thus favoring the
views of the four friends, who preferred having them close
at hand to chasing them about the chamber. The two sentinels
at the door still had their swords unsheathed, but they were
leaning on them while they watched the game.</P>
<P>Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached.
With his white, aristocratic hands he played with the louis,
bending and straightening them again, as if they were made
of pewter. Aramis, less self-controlled, fumbled continually
with his hidden poniard. Porthos, impatient at his continued
losses, kept up a vigorous play with his knee.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan turned, mechanically looking behind him, and
between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry
standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands
clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan saw that the moment was come. He darted a
preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis, who slyly pushed
their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more
space for action. He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee
and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care
at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn
smoothly from the scabbard.</P>
<P>&quot;Hang it!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, &quot;another twenty pistoles lost.
Really, Captain Groslow, you are too much in fortune's way.
This can't last,&quot; and he drew another twenty from his
pocket. &quot;One more turn, captain; twenty pistoles on one
throw  -  only one, the last.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Done for twenty,&quot; replied Groslow.</P>
<P>And he turned up two cards as usual, a king for D'Artagnan
and an ace for himself.</P>
<P>&quot;A king,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;it's a good omen, Master Groslow
 -  look out for the king.&quot;</P>
<P>And in spite of his extraordinary self-control there was a
strange vibration in the Gascon's voice which made his
partner start.</P>
<P>Groslow began turning the cards one after another. If he
turned up an ace first he won; if a king he lost.</P>
<P>He turned up a king.</P>
<P>&quot;At last!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up. Porthos drew back a
step. Daggers and swords were just about to shine, when
suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in
the doorway, accompanied by a man enveloped in a large
cloak. Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets
of half a dozen soldiers.</P>
<P>Groslow jumped up, ashamed at being surprised in the midst
of wine, cards, and dice. But Harrison paid not the least
attention to him, and entering the king's room, followed by
his companion:</P>
<P>&quot;Charles Stuart,&quot; said he, &quot;an order has come to conduct you
to London without stopping day or night. Prepare yourself,
then, to start at once.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And by whom is this order given?&quot; asked the king.</P>
<P>&quot;By General Oliver Cromwell. And here is Mr. Mordaunt, who
has brought it and is charged with its execution.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mordaunt!&quot; muttered the four friends, exchanging glances.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost
and buried it in his huge pocket. Athos and Aramis placed
themselves behind him. At this movement Mordaunt turned
around, recognized them, and uttered an exclamation of
savage delight.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm afraid we are prisoners,&quot; whispered D'Artagnan to his
friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Not yet,&quot; replied Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Colonel, colonel,&quot; cried Mordaunt, &quot;you are betrayed. These
four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle, and no doubt
want to carry off the king. Arrest them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! my young man,&quot; said D'Artagnan, drawing his sword,
&quot;that is an order sooner given than executed. Fly, friends,
fly!&quot; he added, whirling his sword around him.</P>
<P>The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two
of the soldiers who guarded it, before they had time to cock
their muskets. Athos and Aramis followed him. Porthos
brought up the rear, and before soldiers, officers, or
colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in
the street.</P>
<P>&quot;Fire!&quot; cried Mordaunt; &quot;fire upon them!&quot;</P>
<P>Three or four shots were fired, but with no other result
than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the
street safe and sound.</P>
<P>The horses were at the place fixed upon, and they leaped
lightly into their saddles.</P>
<P>&quot;Forward!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, &quot;and spur for your dear lives!&quot;</P>
<P>They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the
morning, namely, in the direction toward Scotland. A few
hundred yards beyond the town D'Artagnan drew rein.</P>
<P>&quot;Halt!&quot; he cried, &quot;this time we shall be pursued. We must
let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern
road, and when they have passed we will take the opposite
direction.&quot;</P>
<P>There was a stream close by and a bridge across it.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge. The
others followed. Ten minutes later they heard the rapid
gallop of a troop of horsemen. A few minutes more and the
troop passed over their heads.</P></article>
