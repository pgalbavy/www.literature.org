<p>On the 15th of January, that is to say, two months and a half
after the tragic events I have narrated, the "Epoque" printed,
as the first column of the front page, the following sensational
article: "The Seine-et-Oise jury is summoned to-day to give its
verdict on one of the most mysterious affairs in the annals of
crime. There never has been a case with so many obscure, incomprehensible,
and inexplicable points. And yet the prosecution has not hesitated
to put into the prisoner’s dock a man who is respected, esteemed,
and loved by all who knew him&mdash;a young savant, the hope of French
science, whose whole life has been devoted to knowledge and truth.
When Paris heard of Monsieur Robert Darzac’s arrest a unanimous
cry of protest arose from all sides. The whole Sorbonne, disgraced
by this act of the examining magistrate, asserted its belief in
the innocence of Mademoiselle Stangerson’s fiance. Monsieur Stangerson
was loud in his denunciation of this miscarriage of justice. There
is no doubt in the mind of anybody that could the victim speak
she would claim from the jurors of Seine-et-Oise the man she wishes
to make her husband and whom the prosecution would send to the
scaffold. It is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson will
shortly recover her reason, which has been temporarily unhinged
by the horrible mystery at the Glandier. The question before the
jury is the one we propose to deal with this very day.</p>

<p>"We have decided not to permit twelve worthy men to commit a
disgraceful miscarriage of justice. We confess that the remarkable
coincidences, the many convicting evidences, and the inexplicable
silence on the part of the accused, as well as a total absence
of any evidence for an alibi, were enough to warrant the bench
of judges in assuming that in this man alone was centered the
truth of the affair. The evidences are, in appearance, so overwhelming
against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a detective so well informed,
so intelligent, and generally so successful, as Monsieur Frederic
Larsan, may be excused for having been misled by them. Up to now
everything has gone against Monsieur Robert Darzac in the magisterial
inquiry. To-day, however, we are going to defend him before the
jury, and we are going to bring to the witness stand a light that
will illumine the whole mystery of the Glandier. For we possess
the truth.</p>

<p>"If we have not spoken sooner, it is because the interests of
certain parties in the case demand that we should take that course.
Our readers may remember the unsigned reports we published relating
to the ‘Left foot of the Rue Oberkampf,’ at the time of the famous
robbery of the Credit Universel, and the famous case of the ‘Gold
Ingots of the Mint.’ In both those cases we were able to discover
the truth long before even the excellent ingenuity of Frederic
Larsan had been able to unravel it. These reports were written
by our youngest reporter, Joseph Rouletabille, a youth of eighteen,
whose fame to-morrow will be world-wide. When attention was first
drawn to the Glandier case, our youthful reporter was on the spot
and installed in the chateau, when every other representative
of the press had been denied admission. He worked side by side
with Frederic Larsan. He was amazed and terrified at the grave
mistake the celebrated detective was about to make, and tried
to divert him from the false scent he was following; but the great
Fred refused to receive instructions from this young journalist.
We know now where it brought Monsieur Robert Darzac.</p>

<p>"But now, France must know&mdash;the whole world must know, that,
on the very evening on which Monsieur Darzac was arrested, young
Rouletabille entered our editorial office and informed us that
he was about to go away on a journey. ‘How long I shall be away,’
he said, ‘I cannot say; perhaps a month&mdash;perhaps two&mdash;perhaps
three&mdash;perhaps I may never return. Here is a letter. If I am not
back on the day on which Monsieur Darzac is to appear before the
Assize Court, have this letter opened and read to the court, after
all the witnesses have been heard. Arrange it with Monsieur Darzac’s
counsel. Monsieur Darzac is innocent. In this letter is written
the name of the murderer; and&mdash;that is all I have to say. I am
leaving to get my proofs&mdash;for the irrefutable evidence of the
murderer’s guilt.’ Our reporter departed. For a long time we were
without news from him; but, a week ago, a stranger called upon
our manager and said: ‘Act in accordance with the instructions
of Joseph Rouletabille, if it becomes necessary to do so. The
letter left by him holds the truth.’ The gentleman who brought
us this message would not give us his name.</p>

<p>"To-day, the 15th of January, is the day of the trial. Joseph
Rouletabille has not returned. It may be we shall never see him
again. The press also counts its heroes, its martyrs to duty.
It may be he is no longer living. We shall know how to avenge
him. Our manager will, this afternoon, be at the Court of Assize
at Versailles, with the letter&mdash;the letter containing the name
of the murderer!"</p>

<p>Those Parisians who flocked to the Assize Court at Versailles,
to be present at the trial of what was known as the "Mystery of
"The Yellow Room," will certainly remember the terrible crush
at the Saint-Lazare station. The ordinary trains were so full
that special trains had to be made up. The article in the "Epoque"
had so excited the populace that discussion was rife everywhere
even to the verge of blows. Partisans of Rouletabille fought with
the supporters of Frederic Larsan. Curiously enough the excitement
was due less to the fact that an innocent man was in danger of
a wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their own
ideas as to the Mystery of "The Yellow Room". Each had his explanation
to which each held fast. Those who explained the crime on Frederic
Larsan’s theory would not admit that there could be any doubt
as to the perspicacity of the popular detective. Others who had
arrived at a different solution, naturally insisted that this
was Rouletabille’s explanation, though they did not as yet know
what that was.</p>

<p>With the day’s "Epoque" in their hands, the "Larsans" and the
"Rouletabilles" fought and shoved each other on the steps of the
Palais de Justice, right into the court itself. Those who could
not get in remained in the neighbourhood until evening and were,
with great difficulty, kept back by the soldiery and the police.
They became hungry for news, welcoming the most absurd rumours.
At one time the rumour spread that Monsieur Stangerson himself
had been arrested in the court and had confessed to being the
murderer. This goes to show to what a pitch of madness nervous
excitement may carry people. Rouletabille was still expected.
Some pretended to know him; and when a young man with a "pass"
crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the Court
House, a scuffle took place. Cries were raised of "Rouletabille!&mdash;there’s
Rouletabille!" The arrival of the manager of the paper was the
signal for a great demonstration. Some applauded, others hissed.</p>

<p>The trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz, a judge
filled with the prejudice of his class, but a man honest at heart.
The witnesses had been called. I was there, of course, as were
all who had, in any way, been in touch with the mysteries of the
Glandier. Monsieur Stangerson&mdash;looking many years older and almost
unrecognisable &mdash;Larsan, Arthur Rance, with his face ruddy
as ever, Daddy Jacques, Daddy Mathieu, who was brought into court
handcuffed between two gendarmes, Madame Mathieu, in tears, the
two Berniers, the two nurses, the steward, all the domestics of
the chateau, the employeee of the Paris Post Office, the railway
employeee from Epinay, some friends of Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Stangerson, and all Monsieur Darzac’s witnesses. I was lucky enough
to be called early in the trial, so that I was then able to watch
and be present at almost the whole of the proceedings.</p>

<p>The court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to
find seats on the steps. Behind the bench of justices were representatives
from other benches. Monsieur Robert Darzac stood in the prisoner’s
dock between policemen, tall, handsome, and calm. A murmur of
admiration rather than of compassion greeted his appearance. He
leaned forward towards his counsel, Maitre Henri Robert, who,
assisted by his chief secretary, Maitre Andre Hesse, was busily
turning over the folios of his brief.</p>

<p>Many expected that Monsieur Stangerson, after giving his evidence,
would have gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands with him;
but he left the court without another word. It was remarked that
the jurors appeared to be deeply interested in a rapid conversation
which the manager of the "Epoque" was having with Maitre Henri
Robert. The manager, later, sat down in the front row of the public
seats. Some were surprised that he was not asked to remain with
the other witnesses in the room reserved for them.</p>

<p>The reading of the indictment was got through, as it always is,
without any incident. I shall not here report the long examination
to which Monsieur Darzac was subjected. He answered all the questions
quickly and easily. His silence as to the important matters of
which we know was dead against him. It would seem as if this reticence
would be fatal for him. He resented the President’s reprimands.
He was told that his silence might mean death.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said; "I will submit to it; but I am innocent."</p>

<p>With that splendid ability which has made his fame, Maitre Robert
took advantage of the incident, and tried to show that it brought
out in noble relief his client’s character; for only heroic natures
could remain silent for moral reasons in face of such a danger.
The eminent advocate however, only succeeded in assuring those
who were already assured of Darzac’s innocence. At the adjournment
Rouletabille had not yet arrived. Every time a door opened, all
eyes there turned towards it and back to the manager of the "Epoque,"
who sat impassive in his place. When he once was feeling in his
pocket a loud murmur of expectation followed. The letter!</p>

<p>It is not, however, my intention to report in detail the course
of the trial. My readers are sufficiently acquainted with the
mysteries surrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on
to the really dramatic denouement of this ever-memorable day.</p>

<p>When the trial was resumed, Maitre Henri Robert questioned Daddy
Mathieu as to his complicity in the death of the keeper. His wife
was also brought in and was confronted by her husband. She burst
into tears and confessed that she had been the keeper’s mistress,
and that her husband had suspected it. She again, however, affirmed
that he had had nothing to do with the murder of her lover. Maitre
Henri Robert thereupon asked the court to hear Frederic Larsan
on this point.</p>

<p>"In a short conversation which I have had with Frederic Larsan,
during the adjournment," declared the advocate, "he has made me
understand that the death of the keeper may have been brought
about otherwise than by the hand of Mathieu. It will be interesting
to hear Frederic Larsan’s theory."</p>

<p>Frederic Larsan was brought in. His explanation was quite clear.</p>

<p>"I see no necessity," he said, "for bringing Mathieu in this.
I have told Monsieur de Marquet that the man’s threats had biassed
the examining magistrate against him. To me the attempt to murder
Mademoiselle and the death of the keeper are the work of one and
the same person. Mademoiselle Stangerson’s murderer, flying through
the court, was fired on; it was thought he was struck, perhaps
killed. As a matter of fact, he only stumbled at the moment of
his disappearance behind the corner of the right wing of the chateau.
There he encountered the keeper who, no doubt, tried to seize
him. The murderer had in his hand the knife with which he had
stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and with this he killed the keeper."</p>

<p>This very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and satisfying.
A murmur of approbation was heard.</p>

<p>"And the murderer? What became of him?" asked the President.</p>

<p>"He was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of the
court. After the people had left the court carrying with them
the body of the keeper, the murderer quietly made his escape."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left Larsan’s mouth when from the back
of the court came a youthful voice:</p>

<p>"I agree with Frederic Larsan as to the death of the keeper;
but I do not agree with him as to the way the murderer escaped!"</p>

<p>Everybody turned round, astonished. The clerks of the court sprang
towards the speaker, calling out silence, and the President angrily
ordered the intruder to be immediately expelled. The same clear
voice, however, was again heard:</p>

<p>"It is I, Monsieur President &mdash;Joseph Rouletabille!"</p>
