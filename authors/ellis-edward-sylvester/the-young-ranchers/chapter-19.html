<p>We must not forget that young Warren Starr and Tim Brophy have
an important part to play in the incidents we have set out to
relate.</p>

<p>We left them in the wooded rocky section, where they had spent
the night together in the rude shelter erected a year before when
on their hunting excursions. They were awakened by the frenzied
cry of the young Irishman's horse, and appeared on the scene just
in time to save the pony from a grizzly bear, who made things
exceedingly lively for the young gentlemen themselves.</p>

<p>But relieved of their peril, they sat down like sensible persons
to make their morning meal from the lunch brought thither by Tim.
They ate heartily, never pausing until the last particle of food
was gone. Then they rose like giants refreshed with new wine.</p>

<p>"Now," said Warren, "we will mount the ponies, and instead of
making for the fort will try to find the folks."</p>

<p>"I'm wid ye there, as I remarked previously," was the response
of the brave young rancher, who was ever ready to risk his life
for those whom he loved.</p>

<p>"It will be an almost hopeless hunt, for father could give me
only a general idea of the course he meant to take, and we are
likely to go miles astray."</p>

<p>"We shall have to depind on Providence to hilp us, though it
may be the folks are in no naad of our assistance."</p>

<p>"I pray that such may be the case," was the fervent response
of Warren, accompanied by a sigh of misgiving. "I think we shall
be able to take care of ourselves, but father is in a bad fix
with mother and Dot on his hands. I hope Plummer has joined them."</p>

<p>"He niver will do the same," remarked Tim gravely.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"He has been killed by the spalpeens, for if he hadn't, he would
have showed himsilf before we lift the ranch."</p>

<p>"It looks that way, but you cannot be certain."</p>

<p>"I wish I couldn't, but he must have larned of thim being so
near the house as soon as mesilf, or very nearly so, and he would
have been back before me. That he didn't come is proof to my mind
that he niver will&mdash;ye may depind on the same."</p>

<p>This brief conversation took place while the youths were saddling
and mounting their horses. They made certain that everything was
secure, and then, carefully guiding their animals among bowlders
to the open prairie, paused a moment to decide upon the best course
to take.</p>

<p>To the northwest stretched the white plain in gentle undulations,
and in the clear sunlight, miles away in the horizon, rose the
dark line of a wooded ridge, similar to the others described,
and which are so common in that section of the country. They agreed
that the best course was to head toward it, for it seemed to them
that the rancher had probably crossed the same at some point,
or if he had not already done so, would ride in that direction.
Possibly, too, the father, despite the wishes he had expressed,
would suspect such a movement on the part of his son. If so, the
probability of their meeting was increased.</p>

<p>The air was clear, sharp, and bracing, with the sun shining from
an unclouded sky. It was a time to stir the blood, and had not
the young ranchers been oppressed by anxiety for their friends,
they would have bounded across the plain in the highest possible
spirits. The ponies, having no such fear, struck into a swinging
gallop of their own accord, which continued without interruption
until more than half the intervening distance was passed. All
this time the youths were carefully scanning the wooded ridge,
as it rose more distinctly to view; for they could not forget
that they were more likely to meet hostiles than friends in that
section, and approaching it across an open plain, must continue
conspicuous objects to whatever Sioux were there.</p>

<p>"Tim," said Warren, as they rode easily beside each other, "unless
I am much mistaken, a fire is burning on the ridge."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Almost directly ahead, but a little to the left; tell me whether
you can make it out."</p>

<p>The Irishman shaded his eyes with one hand, for the glare of
the sun on the snow was almost blinding, and after a moment's
scrutiny, said:</p>

<p>"Ye are right; there is a fire up there; not much smoke does
the same give out, but it is climbing up the clear sky as straight
as a mon's finger."</p>

<p>"I take it that it means Indians; it seems to me they are all
around us."</p>

<p>"I agraas wid ye, but s'pose it is a fire that yer fayther has
started himsilf."</p>

<p>Warren shook his head.</p>

<p>"He would not do so imprudent a thing as that."</p>

<p>"But he moight have in his eye that we'd be looking for something
of the same."</p>

<p>Still his friend was unconvinced.</p>

<p>"He could not be certain that it would be noted by us, while
he must have known that it was sure to attract the attention of
the Sioux. No; I cannot be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Do ye want to pass it by widout finding out its maaning?"</p>

<p>"If it is father who has kindled the blaze, and he is looking
for us, he will find some way of telling us more plainly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do ye obsarve?" asked Tim, in some excitement.</p>

<p>Beyond question the approach of the two young horsemen had produced
an effect. The faint column of smoke which, until that moment,
had climbed perpendicularly up the sky, now showed a wavy appearance,
vibrating from side to side in graceful undulations, as though
it were a ribbon swayed by human hands. But Warren, instead of
accepting this as did his companion, regarded it as more indicative
of danger. The Sioux that were responsible for the ascending vapor
were aware of the approach of the couple, and were signalling
the fact to others whose whereabouts was unknown to the whites.</p>

<p>"Do ye moind," said Tim, "that two months since, whin we were
hunting along the Big Cheyenne and got separated from him and
Plummer, he let us know where they were in jist that way?"</p>

<p>It was a fact. Precisely the same signal had been used by the
parent to apprise his son and companion where he and Plummer were,
though in that instance it was the employ√© who adopted the method.</p>

<p>He was inclined for a few seconds to agree with his companion;
but there was something in the prominence of the artifice, and
the certainty that it would be noted by unfriendly eyes, that
caused him to dismiss the belief. Enough doubt, however, had been
injected into his mind to bring the desire for further investigation.</p>

<p>"We will ride straight toward it, as though we intended to go
to the camp or signal fire as it may be, but will turn aside before
reaching the ridge, so as to avoid the trap that may be set for
us. I had an experience yesterday afternoon something like that
before you joined me."</p>

<p>Strange it was that the couple, who, despite their youth, had
learned so much of border life, forgot to keep watch of the rear,
while giving so much attention to the front. Singular as it may
seem, they had not looked behind them for the preceding half hour.
The sight of the signal fire ahead so absorbed their interest
that they neglected this obvious precaution; nor did it once occur
to them that if the smoke was sent into the sky by hostiles, who
meant it for the guidance of confederates, those same confederates
were likely to be to the rear of them.</p>

<p>Such was the fact, and the knowledge came to the friends in the
most startling manner conceivable, being in the shape of several
rifle bullets which whistled about their ears. Then, when they
glanced affrightedly around, they saw fully a dozen Sioux bucks,
all well mounted, bearing down upon them at full speed.</p>

<p>They had issued from the rocky section behind them, and ridden
to this perilous position without the youths once dreaming of
the fact until, as may be said, the hostiles were literally upon
them.</p>
