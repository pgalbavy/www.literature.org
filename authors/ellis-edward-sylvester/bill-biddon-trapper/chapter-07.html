<p>"Where’s your friend?"</p>

<p>There was apprehension in the question of the trapper, or he
would not have called Nat, as he had never called him before.
The question was asked, too, the instant I appeared.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," I answered, seating myself gloomily.</p>

<p>"Whar’d you leave him?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that either. He went with me to watch the river,
as you remember. Espying that canoe which you saw yesterday, he
concealed himself a few yards distant, in order to obtain a better
view of it. Since then I have seen nothing of him."</p>

<p>"Was it he who shot?"</p>

<p>"It sounded like his gun, although I am not positive that it
really was."</p>

<p>"I heerd it, an’ took it for him; and, shoot me, if I didn’t
know he’d get into some scrape."</p>

<p>"I fear he has, and the last one, too."</p>

<p>"My thoughts ’zactly. Luckily you did not, too."</p>

<p>"I came nearer than I wish to again, Biddon. I can tell you,
that I am willing to leave this place as soon as you wish; I’ve
seen enough to satisfy me."</p>

<p>"Shouldn’t wonder; I did long ago."</p>

<p>"Let us leave to-morrow. Are you willing?"</p>

<p>"I’ll go to-night if you want to."</p>

<p>"No; there is no need of that. It will be best to wait until
daylight."</p>

<p>"I don’t know; that’s the only time we’ve been interfered with."</p>

<p>"Besides," I added. "I have faint hopes that Nat may return."</p>

<p>"Waugh! you’ll never see him again, and ef we’re ’bout yer another
day, we’ll never see each other again. No use lookin’ fur him,
shoot me ef thar is."</p>

<p>"I do not think he has been slain, only captured by some lurking
enemy, from whom he may escape."</p>

<p>"No, <em>sir</em>; I tell you he’s gone, and I reckon as how
we’d better be gone too."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, Biddon, although I shall be loth to leave
the vicinity when I am not satisfied of his fate."</p>

<p>"I’m satisfied, an’ you oughter be. Leastways, <em>I’m</em> goin’
to-morrow, an’ you kin stay and play with these Blackfeet as long
as you like. I’ve been up to see the horses, and fixed things
so as to start as soon as daylight. Any ’jections?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Then ’tis settled, and let’s snooze."</p>

<p>But it was by no means settled. As I lay that night ruminating
upon the strange scenes through which I had so recently passed,
the pledge that I had made with Nat came back to me. I had promised
to remain by him as long as there was hope; and to desert him
now, would be a violation of that vow, and a base and unworthy
act upon my part. For us both to leave him would probably seal
his fate, if alive. It was by no means certain that if lost, he
was irrecoverably gone, and I resolved that if the trapper should
depart on the morrow I would remain.</p>

<p>In making this resolution, perhaps it was not the desire alone
to benefit my companion that prompted it, although I aver that
that alone would have been sufficient. Unconsciously, almost,
I found my thoughts wandering from Nat to the fair being who had
been the cause of all this trouble. At most, I could only speculate
and conjecture with regard to her, and the same speculations and
conjectures I had made before. Undoubtedly she was a captive among
a tribe of Indians, over whom she wielded a great influence; and
that she was the same maid referred to by Biddon, seemed certain
to me. I had mentioned this thought to him, in the hope of persuading
him to remain. He started somewhat at the unsuspected suggestion,
and, after a few moments’ thought, admitted the probability of
such being the case. To my surprise I found I had completely defeated
my own plans.</p>

<p>"I kinder thought then, that little thing war suthin’ more nor
human, an’ ef it’s her, you see, I’m purty sure now. No use talkin’,
I shan’t stay here longer than time ’nough to start. It might
be that gal, and then agin it moughn’t. Shoot me ef it moughn’t."</p>

<p>I said no more, for I saw it would be useless. When he had once
determined upon a matter there was no changing him. He was satisfied
that "spirits invisible" had encompassed him, and there was but
one way of escaping them.</p>

<p>He was now reposing quietly beside me, utterly oblivious to external
things; and as the night was far advanced, I sank upon my knees,
and besought the great Disposer of events to guide me aright in
the undertaking which I was about to commence, and to watch over
my unfortunate companion, now doubtless in captivity; to protect
the kind-hearted trapper, and to soon clear away the mystery which
had enveloped us like a cloud. Then I lay down and slept.</p>

<p>I awoke, hearing a slight rustling noise beside me, and, upon
looking around, caught a glimpse of Biddon as he departed. It
was very early, and he doubtless was after the horses, in order
to leave at once the place which had such terrors for him. In
the course of a half hour he returned.</p>

<p>"The horses are waitin’," said he.</p>

<p>I arose and passed out. The three animals stood outside, a short
distance away, each saddled and prepared for travel.</p>

<p>"Come, work lively, and fetch them skins out," said Biddon, commencing
himself. I made no reply, but assisted him until everything was
in readiness, for starting.</p>

<p>"Jump on, and shoot me ef we won’t soon be clar of this outlandish
place."</p>

<p>"Biddon, I am not going with you," I said, mildly.</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" he asked, looking wonderingly at one, as if
doubting my senses.</p>

<p>"I intend to remain here."</p>

<p>"Ogh! jump on, an’ shut up yer meat-trap; it’s time we started."</p>

<p>"I said I was going to remain here."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it, Jarsey?" he queried, bending such a fierce look
upon me.</p>

<p>"Most certainly I do."</p>

<p>"Then, all Bill Biddon’s got to say is, you’re a fool."</p>

<p>I colored slightly at this, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"What yer going to stay fur? Get shot and lose yer ha’r, I s’pose,
jist to please the reds."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, friend Biddon, that you feel thus. When Nathan Todd
and I left the States for this country, we pledged eternal friendship
to each other, and I am sure I should never feel at ease if I
should leave him in this dire extremity. I am by no means satisfied
that I can afford him no assistance, although he is a captive.
He has no claims upon you, and I should not expect you to remain,
but, as I said, I am determined not to leave this place until
I have obtained satisfactory intelligence of him."</p>

<p>The trapper remained silent a few moments after this. He then
spoke:</p>

<p>"I s’pose you mean right, Jarsey, but you’re awful simple. Yer’s
as what hopes you’ll find the other chap right side up and squar
with his ha’r on, but I don’t ’spect <em>your</em> ha’r ’ll be
yer’s to-night. Howsumever you’re bound to stay, I see, so yer’s
good luck. I’d like to stay with you, but I ain’t backward to
own Bill Biddon knocks under <em>this</em> time."</p>

<p>He reached his hard, horny hand, and I took it.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Bill, I hope we shall meet again. We have not been
long acquainted, but I trust long enough to be friends."</p>

<p>"And you’ll remember as how ole Bill Biddon didn’t mean what
he said just now."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, I know you did not."</p>

<p>"Wal, good-by it is, then."</p>

<p>A half-hour after and I was alone in the great wilderness of
the Northwest.</p>

<p>After parting with Biddon, I remained stationary a long time,
meditating upon the strange resolve that I had acted upon. If
looked at with the common-sense view that the honest trapper gave
it, I was sensible it was nothing less than a piece of recklessness
upon my part, which only could be excused by the motives that
actuated me. I felt some regret certainly at parting with Biddon,
for that honest, manly heart which throbbed within his massive
breast had drawn me toward him, and I knew he had come to regard
me in a far different light than he did at first. However, I was
hopeful, and could not persuade myself that I was never to see
him again.</p>

<p>Toward night the sky gave evidence of an approaching storm. A
strong wind arose, and a melancholy, desolate moaning, like the
precursor of winter, could be heard at intervals in the forest.
Darkness came on earlier than usual, and, as I passed into the
trapper’s home, the storm burst upon me. No one who has not witnessed
a storm in the wilderness, can appreciate its awful grandeur.
As I cowered within the heart of the old forest king, its power
was subdued to my ears; but enough reached them to give me an
idea of the terrific spectacle without. The huge sides of the
tree surrounding me rumbled and groaned as though it were yielding
to the hurricane; the wind blew with such fury that at times it
sounded as though wailing screams were rending the air above me;
and the sharp splintering of the trees riven by the lightning,
rivaled the crash of the thunderbolt itself.</p>

<p>As the morning approached, the storm gradually died away, and
as I stepped forth the sun was shining in unclouded splendor.</p>

<p>Slinging my rifle over my shoulder, I wandered aimlessly forward,
following the course of the stream for several hours. Finally,
becoming considerably wearied, I seated myself upon a fallen tree,
to gain a little rest; but my mind was in such a state of excitement
that the desire to press forward was irresistible, and I arose
again.</p>

<p>As I stood upon the spot, I happened to look across the stream
upon the prairie. The river at this point was flowing east and
west, so that I looked to the southward; and as I did so I saw
Biddon in the distance, riding leisurely away. He was miles distant,
so that I could not hope to make my voice reach him; and as the
prairie in many parts was submerged, it was out of the question
to pursue with the hope of overtaking him. So I contented myself
with watching him until he disappeared. He appeared precisely
the same as when Nat and I first caught sight of him; and it struck
me as a rather curious coincidence that my first and last glimpse
of him were similar. Shortly after, he was a mere quivering speck
on the horizon, and soon disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>The storm which had just ended was the usher of the cold season.
A strong wind had arisen, and was blowing coldly through the forest.
The changes in these regions are remarkably sudden; and by the
middle of the afternoon, needles of ice put out along the shores
of the stream. I suffered much from this sudden and severe cold;
and to make it worse, everything upon which I could lay hands
was so water-soaked as to make it impossible to kindle a fire.</p>

<p>I continued wandering aimlessly onward, until I descended a large
valley, filled with trees of enormous growth. As I entered, I
heard a crackling in the bushes above me. I looked carefully about,
but could detect nothing, although the crackling was still heard.
Creeping cautiously and stealthily up the bank, I came upon the
cause of this apprehension. There was a species of fruit, called
the "buffalo berry," quite numerous here, and in among them, seated
on his haunches, and contentedly devouring, was a grizzly bear.
I started as I took in his colossal form, and turned to make a
hasty retreat; but curiosity held me to the spot. He was a huge,
unwieldy body; his massive form being enveloped in a coat of long,
black, glossy hair, and his eyes small and glittering. His long
nails rattled among the leaves, as he pulled the bushes toward
him, and plucked the delicate fruit.</p>

<p>All at once a mad desire to take this formidable creature’s life
came upon me. I knew it was only the most skillful hunter who
could prevail against him, and yet I determined to take the risk.
As he sat, his side was turned toward me, and I made a low whistle
to attract his attention. He stopped chewing instantly, and turned
his head toward me as if listening. I could see his two coal-black
eyes glistening plainly. I was lying upon my face, with my rifle
resting upon a stone in front. Raising the hammer of my rifle,
I took a long, a deliberate, a sure aim at one of his eyes, and
before he changed his head, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>"How does that suit?" I asked exultingly, expecting to see him
give up the ghost immediately. To my surprise and terror, I saw
him sitting unmoved and apparently unhurt, but looking about him,
as if to ascertain from what direction the shot had come. The
next instant he caught sight of the bluish wreath from my rifle,
and with a low growl of rage plunged directly toward me.</p>

<p>That cumbrous body could roll over the ground much faster than
I suspected, and I found that, when alarmed, I could also travel
rapidly. But in the tangled undergrowth I was no match for him,
as he crashed through it without the least inconvenience, and
gained rapidly. I saw he would assuredly overtake me before I
could go a hundred yards further; so throwing my rifle to the
ground, I drew my knife, and waited his attack. As he came rolling
forward, the blood from his wound trickled down, and daubed his
mouth; while his red tongue lolled out, his mouth was wide open,
and his long and white teeth shone with terrible ferocity. He
was, indeed, a terrific animal, and I drew a deep breath as I
felt that a struggle for life or death was at hand.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "I could see his two coal-black eyes glittering
plainly."]</p>

<p>Suddenly, when a hundred feet distant, there came the <em>report
of another rifle</em>, and the brute halted, and gazed about him.
I also cast a wondering look around to see who my new friend was.
No one was in sight, yet I saw a faint curl of smoke rising from
the bushes above me. The bear also discovered it, and with another
growl made toward it. He had evidently been struck, and his rage
was turned in another direction. Hastily loading my rifle, I ran
up the hill, intending to follow and assist my unknown friend,
but both he and the brute had disappeared. I stood anxiously listening
for some guiding sound, and soon heard the report of a gun in
the distance, followed by a faint shout.</p>

<p>Tearing through the undergrowth, I dashed hastily forward, calling
out in loud tones, so that my friend might guide me to him. There
was no response homeward. I feared that he had suffered the fate
which had well-nigh been mine. The trail of the bear was now very
plain to be seen by the broken twigs, the rising branches, and
the blood marks upon the ground. Soon I reached the spot where
the last struggle had evidently taken place. The ground was torn
up and cast about, and the blood was spattered for many feet around.
Following further, I came upon the dead body of the brute. There
was another bullet mark in the head, and a ghastly wound in the
throat from which an enormous quantity of blood had poured.</p>

<p>But where was the author of this deed? Why had he fled? Who was
he? I looked about expecting to see him near at hand, but I was
disappointed. On the ground were the marks of a moccasin, and
it was evident my preserver was an Indian. This fact suggested
other questions. Had he been following me? Else how came he to
be present just at the instant needed? And what was his object?
It could not be that my life was sought, for, if such were the
case, it had been really spared, as I had been continually exposed
through the day; and in the occurrence just narrated, he had preserved
my life at the imminent risk of his own.</p>

<p>At any rate, the affair was singular and unaccountable. The Indian
was probably gazing upon me this moment, and I looked furtively
about, half-expecting to see his glowing eye-balls in the thick
shrubbery around.</p>

<p>It was now growing late, and I cast about for some place in which
to spend the night. The wind still blew, and a fire was indispensable.
I gathered several armfuls of twigs and branches, and pitched
my camp upon the banks of a small rippling stream, a tributary
of the river referred to. Here, after the expense of an almost
incredible amount of patience, I succeeded in starting a fire,
and with the feeling of a conqueror inhaled its glowing, cheerful
warmth. The pangs of hunger now began to make themselves felt,
as I had tasted no food the entire day. The grizzly bear lay but
a short distance away, and, after a few minutes’ debate, I concluded
that he should answer the demands of nature.</p>

<p>As I drew my knife, and started toward him, a shadow glided from
before me, and I saw a human form stealthily make off. I stopped
suddenly and hesitated, but finally went on, cut a piece from
the animal, and returned. Just before I reached the crackling
fire, I again saw a shadow flit before me and disappear. It was
too distinct and plain to be a freak of imagination, and it was
evident that something or somebody was following or watching.
Whoever he might be, I determined that, upon the first opportunity,
he should have the contents of my gun for his temerity.</p>

<p>The consciousness that some one was near at hand, watching, perhaps,
every motion, lessened my appetite somewhat. However, after skewering
a good-sized piece and roasting it, I made a hearty supper; and,
as I produced my inseparable pipe, I think, had it not been for
the instinctive presence of that invisible form, my enjoyment
would have been complete.</p>

<p>The pleasant warmth of the fire, the soothing effect of the pipe,
gradually threw a dreamy, half-unconsciousness over me, into which
I sunk with willing delight. As my listless eyes rested upon the
glowing embers, there came a strain of wonderful music, like the
faint tones of some distant wind-harp. I stirred not, but listened,
fearing to move lest the spell should be broken. Again came the
wave of heavenly harmony, swelling to the most inspiring grandeur,
and then dying away into faint, fluctuating tremors, fainter and
fainter, till the strained ear could just feel their waves. It
sounded in the air above me, and at that moment I knew that there
was nothing real in my experience, and I listened breathlessly
for it again.</p>

<p>The music continued, I think, over an hour, and to this day it
seems I can hear it still. Such music I have never heard before
or since. As I sat alone that dark, stormy night, in the wilderness
of the northwest, hundreds of miles from civilization, it seemed
there was a chord within me that responded to the air tones above.
It appeared sometimes to sink until it had enveloped me in its
wild thrilling power, and then it suddenly swept upward, until
I was pained with intense listening. At last, it died away, and
with a long sigh of relief I awoke to full consciousness.</p>

<p>I have heard others narrate experience similar to mine and I
leave the explanation to the curious and investigating, convinced
that I can offer none that will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>I replenished the fire, folded my blanket around me, and lay
down to sleep. The night wind was howling dismally through the
forest, and the distant rush of the river made melancholy music.
In a short time I fell into a deep, and profound sleep.</p>

<p>I was aroused from this by feeling something working at my blanket.
I lay motionless a moment to ascertain the character of the threatened
danger. The next instant something struck me like the paw of an
animal; and, thinking a wolf had attacked me, I sprang to my feet
with a shout, threw off my blanket, and drew my knife. Instead
of confronting wolves, I met the gaze of a half-dozen savages!
For a moment I was completely bewildered.</p>

<p>"You go ’long with us," said one, laying his hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>I saw that resistance would be useless. There were half a dozen
fully armed, and my rifle was in their hands.</p>

<p>"I am in your power," said I; "do what you please with me."</p>
