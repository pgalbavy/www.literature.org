<p>As Deerfoot listened to the story of the Nez Perce leader his
gorge steadily rose, for the account was worse, if possible, than
he had expected to hear. Not only did he resent the cool appropriation
of his steed by Amokeat, but he read the proof of the cowardice
of the chief, who had deserted his companions when in peril and
then, instead of making a brave defence when cornered by the Assiniboines,
had eagerly passed over to them the property of another in order
to secure his own safety.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe could not trust himself any further in the presence
of Amokeat, who sat on the back of his pony and looked serenely
down in his face, exulting over his own escape from the revenge
of an enemy.</p>

<p>"Amokeat is a dog!" exclaimed Deerfoot, compressing his lips,
turning around and walking from the presence of the chief and
his party. He was on the alert, for he half expected an attack
from more than one of them. If they had such action in mind, it
was changed by the command of the leader, who called to them to
follow him as he resumed the journey toward his own village.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had learned several important facts. Whirlwind had
passed from the hands of the Nez Perces to those of a wandering
band of Assiniboines, whose villages and hunting grounds lay well
to the northeast, some below and some above the boundary line
in the country of the Saskatchewan. Thither the Shawanoe would
go, though knowing absolutely nothing of the region or the people.
In his contemptuous scorn of Amokeat, Deerfoot did not so much
as look behind him until the afternoon was nearly gone and night
was closing in. Then, when he turned his gaze to the rear, he
saw nothing of men or horses.</p>

<p>He was thinking hard. It was evident that the only course which
promised hope was for him to keep to the trail left by the Nez
Perces until he reached the scene of the fight. From that point
he would be guided by the footprints of the Assiniboine animals.
Of course there was no distinguishable difference between those
of Whirlwind and the impressions made by any other of his species,
but there ought to be little difficulty in keeping to the main
trail until he ran the party down.</p>

<p>You will understand that a number of puzzling complications threatened.
It might be that the Assiniboines would continue their hunting
or raiding excursions for days, turning off and pushing to the
south or east or west, with a view of attacking some of the tribes
within United States territory. The Shawanoe hoped that such would
be the course of the raiders, for it would simplify the situation.
He would have a small party to operate against, instead of a whole
village or tribe.</p>

<p>A singular difficulty presented itself. Deerfoot relied upon
entering the Assiniboine settlements or joining the raiders without
rousing any suspicion of his real errand. Then he would content
himself in patience and await a chance of slipping off with Whirlwind.
The likelihood of gaining such opportunity would be almost destroyed
if his errand became known. Now, the danger of betrayal was in
the stallion himself. He could not be made to understand the need
of cunning and silence, but was sure to show his joy at sight
of his owner. When this was observed by his captors, they would
be certain to connect it with the long journey of the stranger,
who would then have all he could do to guard his own life.</p>

<p>Reflecting over this probable phase of the situation, Deerfoot
decided what his own conduct should be. He resolved that if Whirlwind
made a rush for him, thereby revealing the truth, he would leap
upon his back, throw himself forward, and send the steed flying
off at the highest speed. There would be imminent risk of both
being shot before they could pass beyond range, but the danger
would be no greater than the Shawanoe had faced many times, and
still he did not bear a scar upon his body.</p>

<p>His plan, however, was to rely upon subtlety. If he could succeed
in locating his pet, he would keep out of the animal's sight until
the crisis came. He knew Whirlwind was alive, and was not very
far off. Less than two days previous he had passed over the same
spot, and the trail left by him and his companions could be readily
followed.</p>

<p>So it was that the young Shawanoe pressed forward with long,
swift strides until the gloom shut out all sight of the footprints.
He could calculate quite closely from the different landmarks
the course followed by the Nez Perces, but he determined to run
no chances. Time was too precious, and he was resolved not to
go astray.</p>

<p>He was in a wild, mountainous country, interspersed with ridges,
isolated peaks and lofty ranges. There were numerous valleys,
ca√±ons, gorges and ravines, with stretches of wood and stunted
undergrowth. The sound of falling waters, cascades and rapids
was hardly ever absent. Naturally the horsemen had sought the
most favorable route, keeping mainly to the valleys, but occasionally
riding over elevated portions. Thus the course was easier for
Deerfoot than it would have been had the party been on foot like
himself. The Assiniboines were not likely to make haste, for they
had no reason for doing so. With his long strides, his lope and
occasional running, as the ground offered the chance, the pursuer
knew he was gaining upon those whom he was so anxious to overtake.</p>

<p>When night had fairly come, Deerfoot sought out a place among
the rocks in which to sleep. He did not look for food, nor did
he so much as drink from the mountain stream that he heard rippling
near at hand. It took some time to find a suitable spot for a
bed. He fixed upon a cavity large enough for him to stretch out
with his blanket wrapped about him. He could have readily kindled
a fire, but preferred not to do so, since it was liable to draw
the attention of wild animals, or possibly of those of his own
race who might be in the vicinity. As it was, a prowling wolf
or bear might threaten, but the youth felt no misgiving when,
after spending a brief time in prayer, he lay down and speedily
sank into slumber.</p>

<p>At the first streakings of light he was on his feet. Praying
again, he fastened his blanket about his shoulders, knelt at the
mountain stream, drank deeply, bathed face and hands and was off
once more. No move was made toward procuring the morning meal,
which most folks in his situation would have found indispensable.</p>

<p>The trail was clearly marked, but before resuming his pursuit
Deerfoot climbed to the highest elevation near at hand and spent
a few minutes in studying the surrounding country. The main features
were similar to those already described, except perhaps in the
increase of the ruggedness of the scenery. He was within the Rocky
Mountain district, but kept mainly to the foothills, where journeying
was easier than among the mountains themselves.</p>

<p>Noting that the general course of the trail he was following
up was from the northeast, he scanned with special interest the
country in that direction. He picked out a point some twenty miles
distant as the place where the Nez Perces were most likely to
have made one of their camps. While he might have shortened the
time by keeping a direct line to it, he stuck to his resolution
not to turn aside from the trail.</p>

<p>Though he did not catch sight of any horseman, he saw that which
roused his curiosity. Hardly a mile away he observed a single
Indian coming toward him on foot. It may be said the stranger
leaped into view, for Deerfoot was looking over a certain spot
at the country beyond when a peculiar, flitting movement caused
him to depress his glass to learn the cause.</p>

<p>The Indian seemed to have been following a roughly marked path,
when he came to a huge boulder, which, instead of passing around,
he climbed, walked across the top, and then dropped to the ground
again. It was this action which caused Deerfoot to turn his gaze
upon him.</p>

<p>Under the glass the stranger was seen with as much distinctness
as if he were only a few rods distant. When looking at him the
Shawanoe, for the first time in his life, saw a dwarf belonging
to his own race. The man had broad shoulders and body and sturdy
legs, but his height could not have been more than four and a
half feet. Moreover he was very bow-legged, was a hunchback, had
a broad mouth, a flat nose and small twinkling eyes. His long
black hair dangled loosely about his shoulders, he was clad in
a hunting dress similar to that worn by the Shawanoe, except that
he was without a blanket, and his clothing was much shabbier.
He carried a bow fully double his own length, and advanced with
a curious sidelong, wabbling gait, which accented more strikingly
his difference from those of his own people.</p>

<p>When the astonished Deerfoot had noted these peculiarities, he
scanned the vicinity of the dwarf for his companions. None was
seen, and our friend decided that the fellow was entirely alone.
It was impossible to make a guess as to the tribe to which he
belonged, though Deerfoot suspected, without any particular reason,
that he was an Assiniboine. As to how he came to be by himself,
and traveling southward, no theory could be formed by the astute
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The latter lowered his glass, and, standing in full view, watched
the hunchback as he drew near with his crab-like, wabbling gait.
Although the Shawanoe was a much more conspicuous object on the
landscape, it was evident the other did not discover him until
he was almost within a hundred yards. No better proof could have
been asked that the stranger was afflicted with poor eyesight.</p>

<p>Suddenly he descried the form on the rocks and stopped short.
He was startled. Then he began hurriedly drawing an arrow from
the bundle hung behind his shoulder. It was a curious coincidence,
which caught Deerfoot's notice, that the dwarf was left-handed
like himself. The latter laid his gun at his feet and raised both
hands above his head, a sign of friendship. The stranger paused
in his warlike preparations, but seemed in doubt whether to launch
a missile or to accept the sign of comity. Deerfoot picked up
his weapon, held his other hand over his head, and began carefully
descending the elevation. He kept a close watch on the other,
for he half expected he would let fly with his arrow, and it would
have been unpleasant, to say the least, to act as a target, even
at a considerable distance. The dwarf stood motionless, closely
watching the Shawanoe as he came toward him, evidently doubting
and hesitating, but Deerfoot kept up his signs of goodwill, which
the other could not fail to understand.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable to believe that the personality of Deerfoot
had much to do with removing the misgivings of the stranger, for
the smiling face of the Shawanoe as he drew near would have impressed
anyone, though Deerfoot himself would never have admitted anything
of the kind. Be that as it may, the meeting was friendly, though
Deerfoot did not offer his hand in greeting, for he thought it
unlikely that the other would have understood the meaning of the
salutation.</p>

<p>He addressed the stranger in the Blackfoot tongue, only to receive
a shake of the head in reply. The dwarf did not understand a syllable.
In response, he used a language that was "all Greek" to the Shawanoe.
There was no common ground, except that of signs, upon which the
two could meet, and that was of slight service.</p>

<p>"Assiniboine? Assiniboine?" asked Deerfoot, with a marked rising
inflection. Another shake of the head might indicate a denial
of such tribal relation, or what was more likely, a failure to
comprehend the question. Deerfoot repeated the word "Nez Perce,"
and was replied to as before.</p>

<p>The first bit of information that the Shawanoe could gather for
a time was that the Indian of abbreviated stature came from the
north. That was clearly established, as was the direction which
he was following, but nothing was brought to light as to the nature
of his errand in the south.</p>

<p>The thought had been in the mind of our friend from the first
that this misshapen red man had seen the party of Assiniboines
who held Whirlwind. How was the question to be asked?</p>

<p>Deerfoot stepped to a tree resembling the water maple that grew
a few feet to the right of them. Its diameter was a foot or more.
With his hunting knife he cut out a square some six inches in
diameter and carefully peeled it off, the other attentively watching
him all the time.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now proceeded to trace on the filmy inner side of the
bark with the point of his knife the outlines of a horse with
unusually long tail and mane. This done, he depicted a warrior
sitting on him with no saddle except a blanket and without bridle.
When the crude but symmetrical picture was finished, he handed
the piece of bark to the other. The dwarf studied it a minute
or two with close interest, Deerfoot meanwhile watching his countenance.</p>

<p>Suddenly the homely visage lit up. The stranger recognized the
figure of the beautiful stallion. He had seen him!</p>

<p>With a thrill of hope the Shawanoe pointed north, his gesture
clearly meaning that he wished to know whether it was there the
animal had been met. The stranger shook his head. Deerfoot was
disappointed, fearing his meaning had not been understood. It
seemed to him that the Assiniboine horsemen must be journeying
in that direction, and the negative motion of the other's head
might indicate that he did not catch the drift of the question.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now pointed toward the rising sun, only to be answered
by another shake of his head. He next indicated the northeast.
The dwarf nodded vigorously several times. Then he gazed steadily
into the handsome face and began circling one of his hands rapidly
around his head, pointing to his moccasins and then to the sky.
These peculiar gestures were repeated a number of times, when
they ceased as abruptly as they began.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe could not form the first idea of what the man was
trying to say, nor did he ever learn.</p>

<p>The dwarf perceived that he could not make himself understood,
gave up the effort, and with an awkward good-bye resumed his tramp
southward. Uncertain of what whim might suddenly take possession
of him, Deerfoot, while also moving in the opposite direction,
kept a furtive watch to the rear. He did not see the dwarf look
behind him and it is not probable that he meditated any wrong.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was not satisfied with what had occurred. Glancing
down at the trail and as far ahead as it could be traced, he saw
that its course was due north. He believed that it led for a long
way toward that point of the compass. If such proved the fact
the hunchback had tried to deceive the inquirer by making him
believe that Whirlwind was to be sought to the northeast. The
Shawanoe could no longer doubt that the nature of his inquiry
had been understood, and the reply of the dwarf was clear. Deerfoot
was inclined to believe the strange creature really belonged to
the Assiniboine tribe and was trying to shield his countrymen.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Shawanoe knew little of this people. He understood
in a vague way that their homes were well to the northward, and
partly in another country than the United States. The true direction,
however, was to the northeast. Thus the Indian of abbreviated
stature had indicated the right course after all.</p>

<p>Adhering to his policy, Deerfoot wasted no time. While these
thoughts were passing through his mind, he was loping forward
with the trail still as his guide, and had not gone two miles
when he came upon the scene of the fight between the Assiniboines
and the Nez Perces.</p>
