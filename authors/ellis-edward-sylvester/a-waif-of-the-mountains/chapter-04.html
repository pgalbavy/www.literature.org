<p>Wade Ruggles was speechless. He sat with his mouth wide open
and his eyes staring at the little figure, as if it were a veritable
apparition. All the others looked in the same direction. Nellie
Dawson stood for a moment with her finger pointed reprovingly
at the chairman, and then turning about ran back into the rear
room and plunged into her bed.</p>

<p>"Max, quick!" said Ruggles faintly, pointing to the black bottle
at the rear of the bar. The landlord hastily poured out some of
the fiery stuff, and the miserable fellow swallowed it at a gulp.
It served partly to revive him, but he was really on the verge
of collapse.</p>

<p>The only one of the company not impressed was Maurice Dawson,
father of the little girl. He was sitting well back of the rest,
where no one paid attention to him. Comprehending the meaning
of this incident, he drew his hand across his mouth to conceal
the smile that could not be wholly restrained. Then he hurried
back into the room to see that his child was "tucked up" and properly
covered for the night. Finding himself in the dark, where he could
not be observed, he laughed deeply and silently, his mirth all
the greater because of the oppressive gravity of every one else.
Then bending over, he said, as he kissed the little one:</p>

<p>"I thought you were asleep, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"So I was, but Mr. Ruggles spoke those bad words so loud he woked
me."</p>

<p>"You mustn't get up again, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want me to."</p>

<p>"I have just told you I don't wish you to."</p>

<p>"Then I wont get up."</p>

<p>The father lingered in the room, until he mastered his disposition
to laugh, and then, when he walked out among his friends no countenance
was graver than his.</p>

<p>"I say, Dawson," said Ruggles, swallowing a lump in his throat,
"will you oblige me by acting as chairman? &mdash;I don't feel&mdash;very&mdash;well."</p>

<p>The gentleman walked forward to where Ruggles had been standing
with his back against the bar, looking down in the faces of his
friends. The poor fellow seemed to have aged ten years, as he
slouched off to an upturned box near the door, where he dejectedly
seated himself.</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure, gentlemen?" asked Dawson, as if presiding
over the deliberations of one of the most august assemblages in
the land; "I am ready to hear any suggestion or motion."</p>

<p>Al Bidwell rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, I wish to endorse with all my heart, the soul-stirring,
eloquent address to which we have just listened from the late
Mr. Ruggles, &mdash;I mean the late Chairman. Them sentiments
of his is as sound as a gold dollar. He maintains that any gent
that uses an unproper word, such as he used and which I scorn
to repeat, in the presence of the young lady, who has just listened
to his remarks, oughter to be sent to the individooal whose name
is too shocking fur me to pronounce, since the aforesaid young
lady is in the adjoining apartment, from whence she was awoke
by the awful profanity of the gent who lately served as our chairman."</p>

<p>And having gotten back on Ruggles in this masterly manner, Bidwell
sat down, slung one leg over the other, and relit his pipe. The
oppressive silence was broken by a prodigious sigh from Ruggles.</p>

<p>Parson Brush, after the stillness had continued some minutes,
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, an extraordinary state of affairs has arisen.
You have not forgotten that I plead for charity for Mr. Bidwell,
because it was his first offence. My plea was not well received,
but my sentiments are unchanged, and I now make the same plea
for Mr. Ruggles and on the same grounds. When he was denouncing
in fitting terms the sin of Bidwell, he had no thought of committing
the crime himself, but in his earnestness he did. This being plain
to all of us, I renew&#11834;"</p>

<p>Wade Ruggles bounded to his feet.</p>

<p>"I don't want any one to plead for me! I ain't pleading fur myself!
I can take my medicine like a man; if there's any galoot here&#11834;"</p>

<p>He suddenly checked himself with an apprehensive glance at the
door of the rear room, and then resumed in a more subdued voice:</p>

<p>"I insist that Al Bidwell shall suffer for his onspeakable crime
and me too, 'cause mine was onspeakabler. Jedgin' from the evidence
that showed itself, I must have awoke the little gal from peaceful
slumber, by them awful words of mine."</p>

<p>He paused and looked inquiringly at the chairman, who calmly
returned his gaze, without speaking. It was Parson Brush who interposed:</p>

<p>"I should like to ask, Mr. Dawson, whether the supposition of
Mr. Ruggles has any foundation in fact."</p>

<p>"It has; when I asked Nellie what caused her to awake, she said
it was Mr. Ruggles when he used those bad words."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought!" exclaimed Ruggles, as if he enjoyed heaping
fire upon his own head; "there ain't any depth of infamy which
I hain't reached. For me to try to sneak out now, when I made
such a&#11834;(Here he again threw a startled glance at the rear of
the room) would be to do something which Wade Ruggles never done
in his variegated career of nigh onto forty years. All I ask is
that you'll git through it as soon as you kin and fix our terms
of imprisonment or our deaths and hev done with it."</p>

<p>Al Bidwell took an unworthy delight in prodding the man who had
been so severe upon him.</p>

<p>"I beg humbly to suggest to the gent that there are plenty of
places in the mountains where he can make a jump of a thousand
feet or two into the kenyons. Wouldn't it be a good idee fur the
gent to try it?"</p>

<p>"I will if you'll join me," retorted Wade, turning upon him like
a flash.</p>

<p>"I'll let you try it first and see how it works," replied Bidwell,
so crushed that he remained silent henceforward.</p>

<p>"Since I am chairman," said Dawson, with becoming dignity, "it
is my duty to listen to suggestions and to hear motions. What
is your pleasure, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>No one in looking at the countenance of Maurice Dawson would
have suspected he was extracting the keenest enjoyment from these
proceedings, yet such was the fact. There was something so intensely
ludicrous in the whole business, that only by assuming preternatural
gravity could he refrain from breaking into merriment. His policy
was to egg on the discussion until the company were ready for
a decision, when he would interpose with the proposal to wipe
out the whole matter and begin over again. The earnestness of
Wade Ruggles, however, threatened to check anything of that nature.
He was on his feet several times until Budge Isham, who shrewdly
suspected the sentiments of the chairman, protested.</p>

<p>"With all due respect to the parson, to Ruggles and to Bidwell,
it strikes me, Mr. Chairman, that they should give the rest of
us a show. We have listened to their yawping until it has grown
monotonous. Having told us a dozen times, more or less, that he
wants us to punish him all he deserves, Mr. Ruggles ought to let
it rest with that; but he shouldn't forget," added Budge, with
the solemn manner which always marked his waggery, "that, if we
took him at his word, he would be kicking vacancy this minute.
However, this hasn't anything to do with his general cussedness,
but concerns his offence against the young lady. That is all there
is before the house, and I insist that we confine ourselves to
that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Isn't that what I've been insistin' on?" demanded Wade Ruggles.</p>

<p>"There you go again! I have the floor, and you have no parliamentary
right to interrupt me with your frivolous remarks. Am I correct,
Mr. Chairman?"</p>

<p>"You are most unquestionably; proceed."</p>

<p>"Well, to bring this tiresome matter to a close, I move that
Mr. Bidwell be deprived of the bar privileges of the Heavenly
Bower for a period of four days, and that the same be denied to
Mr. Ruggles for a period of one week. Did I hear a groan?" asked
Budge, looking round at the two men, who were trying bravely to
bear up under the threatened punishment.</p>

<p>Both shook their heads, afraid to trust their voices by way of
reply.</p>

<p>"If the gentlemen will permit me," said the chairman, "I should
like to say a few words."</p>

<p>"I am sure we shall be glad to hear from Mr. Dawson," remarked
the parson.</p>

<p>"Thank you. What I had in mind is this: &mdash;It is creditable
to your honor that you should pledge yourselves to refrain from
unbecoming language in the hearing of my little girl, for you
cannot help being her instructors, no matter how much you may
wish it were otherwise. But you are magnifying the matter. I am
sure every man of you will strive just as hard, without being
incited thereto by the fear of punishment. I would beg to suggest&#11834;"</p>

<p>He paused, for, looking at Wade Ruggles, he saw it was useless
to go further. Bidwell would have been glad to receive leniency,
but his partner in crime was immovable, and it would not do to
punish one and allow the other to go free. Dawson was wise enough
to accept the situation promptly.</p>

<p>"You have heard the penalties suggested for the offences of the
two gentlemen accused. All who favor such punishment will show
it by raising their right hands."</p>

<p>Every man in the room, except the chairman, voted in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"It isn't worth while to put the negative. The accused have heard
the verdict, which is that Mr. Bidwell shall not drink a drop
of anything except water or coffee for a period of four days,
dating from this moment, while Mr. Ruggles is to undergo the same
penalty for a period of one week."</p>

<p>"That's right," growled Bidwell; "for he drank about half of
what was in the bottle only a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"And you would have drunk it all," retorted Ruggles, "if you'd
knowed what was coming."</p>
