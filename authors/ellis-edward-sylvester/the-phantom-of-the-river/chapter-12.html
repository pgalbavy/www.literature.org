<p>Jethro Juggens, the brawny servant of Mr. Altman, the dusky youth
with the strength of a Hercules, the intellect of a child, or
a skill in the use of the rifle hardly second to that of Kenton
and Boone, has a singular but momentous part to play in the incidents
that follow. The reader must, therefore, bear with us when now
and then we turn aside from the graver and more tragical sweep
of incidents to follow the doings and the fortunes and misfortunes
of the one who rendered such signal service to his friends, already
related in "Shod with Silence."</p>

<p>Simon Kenton denounced himself times without number for bringing
Jethro with him when he set out to recover the canoe that had
been left at the clearing; and yet that act, ill-advised as it
seemed, changed the whole course of events that followed quick
and fast, and became the foundation of one of the most remarkable
legends connected with the romantic Ohio and the stirring events
that marked the history of the settlement of Ohio and Kentucky.</p>

<p>With no thought of the mischief he was likely to cause, Jethro
Juggens, as the reader has learned, circled part way round the
cabin in the clearing, passed through the door, drew in the latch-string,
devoured nearly all of the bread that was left behind, and then
lay down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>He had managed to gain so much slumber during the past twenty-four
hours that he was in need of nothing of the kind. As a consequence,
he remained unconscious less than an hour, when he opened his
eyes, as fully awake as he ever was in all his life.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness, and he was so confused that for a brief
spell he was at a loss to know where he was. Rising to a sitting
position, he rubbed his eyes and stared around in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Am dis de flatboat, and am I in de cellar ob it?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>But a moment's reflection recalled what had taken place.</p>

<p>"Gracious! I wonder if anyting hab happened to Mr. Kenton?" he
exclaimed, starting to his feet and stumbling headlong over one
of the boxes, unnoticed in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Dar's no tellin' what trouble he may get into widout me watchin'
and tookin' keer ob him. I's afraid I'm too late to help him."</p>

<p>He would have opened the door and hurried out, but at that moment
his keen nostrils caught the appetizing odor of the loaves of
bread, amid which he had created havoc a short time before.</p>

<p>"I hab an obspression dat I done eat some ob dat afore I took
a nap, but I ain't certain; don't want to make any mistake, and
I feels sorter hungry."</p>

<p>There was enough food left to furnish him another good meal,
and he did not stop using his peerless teeth and massive jaws
until he had secured it.</p>

<p>His rifle was leaning against the wall near the door, where he
had left it. He took it in hand, with the intention of opening
the door and passing out, when the first real thrill of alarm
stirred him. He heard some one attempting to open the door.</p>

<p>He knew it was an enemy, for Kenton, the only friend he had in
the neighborhood, would never come there to look for him.</p>

<p>The latch-string being drawn in, it was impossible for the door
to be opened, except by great labor from the outside. Nevertheless,
some one was pushing at it repeatedly, and with such vigor that
there could be no mistake about it.</p>

<p>"Who dar?" demanded Jethro, in his deepest voice, holding his
rifle ready to use it in case the Indian effected an entrance.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but the efforts on the outside ceased for
a minute, to be resumed more guardedly than at first.</p>

<p>"Go way from der, I toles yo' or yo'll get into trouble," called
the youth, in a louder voice, meant to be as threatening as he
could make it.</p>

<p>Again the pushing ceased, and all became still.</p>

<p>Jethro heard the wind blowing strongly around the cabin and among
the trees beyond. Standing in the open clearing, as did the cabin,
no shadow was cast upon it. The narrow windows, therefore, were
clearly outlined against the dim moonlight. The youth glanced
furtively at them, comprehending more fully than at any time before
the sad mistake he had made in disobeying the orders of Kenton.
But for that he would not have been in his present plight.</p>

<p>But it was too late for regrets to avail him. All he could do
was to fight it out as best he knew how to the end.</p>

<p>Stepping nearer the door, he bent his head and listened. The
pressure against the structure had ceased, but he caught the murmur
of voices when a few broken sentences were uttered. Their meaning,
of course, was beyond his reach.</p>

<p>"Why don't dey be gemmen?" he asked himself, "or talk in American,
so dat anoder gemmen can understand 'em? I don't know what dey's
talkin' 'bout, and it sounds as if dey don't know demselves."</p>

<p>He could understand, however, that no immediate cause for fear
existed.</p>

<p>A dozen brawny Shawanoes could not force the door, and the windows,
as has been explained, were too narrow for any one to push his
body through.</p>

<p>But, all the same, some mischief was afoot at one of the rear
window's&mdash;the one into which Jethro Juggens had fired that very
day with fatal effect. The disturbance was transferred from the
door to the window.</p>

<p>The youth was standing in the middle of the lower apartment,
gun in hand, watching and listening. The moon was so placed in
the heavens that this particular opening was seen more clearly
than any of the others, and peering intently at it, Jethro became
conscious of some dark object that was slowly obtruding into his
field of vision.</p>

<p>"What de mischief am dat?" he muttered. "Looks like a hobblegoblin,
but I knows it am an Injin."</p>

<p>Dimly seen in the partial illumination, the resemblance to the
head of a warrior was so close that all doubt was removed from
the mind of Jethro Juggens.</p>

<p>"Dat's what I's waiting for," was his thought, as he brought
his piece to a level, took the best aim he could in the darkness,
and let fly.</p>

<p>The report within the close room was so thunderous that his ears
tingled, but confident of the accuracy of his shot, he looked
through the smoke at the moonlit opening.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear no yell, but I reckoned dat blowed de top ob his
head off afore he could let out de war-whoop dat Mr. Kenton says
an Injin always gibs when he cotches his last sickness&mdash;gracious
hebbins! how's dat?"</p>

<p>Could he believe his eyes? The head at which he had fired only
a few feet away had not vanished. There it was, the owner apparently
staring in upon him, with the same interest he had shown from
the first.</p>

<p>"Dat beats all creation! I knowed I hit him, 'cause I couldn't
miss him if I tried. He must had a head as hard as mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>If Jethro Juggens was astounded by what had just occurred, he
was almost lifted off his feet by what followed before he finished
the expression of the thought that was in his mind. Through the
narrow window at which he was gazing the muzzle of a gun was thrust
and the weapon discharged, the ball passing so close that he felt
it nip his ear.</p>

<p>With a howl of dismay the youth leaped a foot in the air and
to one side. No one could have had a narrower escape than he,
and he knew it.</p>

<p>"Tings are gettin' mixed most obstrageously," he muttered, stepping
nearer to one side of the room and proceeding to reload his gun
as best he could in the darkness.</p>

<p>Much as Jethro had blundered, and obtuse as he was in many things,
he understood what had taken place. That which he supposed to
be the head of an Indian was some object presented by the crouching
warrior with the purpose of drawing his fire, and it succeeded
in doing so. The flash of the negro's rifle revealed where he
stood, and the Shawanoe, who was watching for that clew, lost
no time in firing, missing by a hair's-breadth a fatal result.
Thus it came about that not the least execution was done on either
side.</p>

<p>Jethro waited some minutes in order to discover the next movement
of his enemies. Nothing presenting itself, he had resort to the
dangerous expedient of trying to peer through the different windows.
Being enveloped in impenetrable gloom, he could not have been
seen by the Indians had they been on the watch, though possibly
they might have heard him. As it was, no shot was fired at him,
nor was he able to detect anything that could give him the least
information of what his enemies were doing, or what they intended
to do. They may have been quite near, but he could not get the
first glimpse of them.</p>

<p>"Dis yeah am gettin' ser'us," mused Jethro, leaning against the
side of the house in order to think more clearly. "I's afeard
dat somethin' may happen to Mr. Kenton, and if it does and he
can't get back, nor me neither, what's goin' to become of de folks?
I 'spose dey am most worried to def now."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>JETHRO IN TROUBLE</em>.]</p>

<p>Since it looked as if it would be impossible for him to leave
the cabin for an indefinite time, the anxiety of the dusky youth
to do so increased with every passing minute, until he formed
the resolution to make the attempt, no matter what the consequences
might prove to himself.</p>

<p>A dispassionate view of the situation would have pronounced Jethro
as useful to the pioneers in one place as in another. Possibly,
it might have been decided that it was better that he should remain
away so long as the peril remained imminent, despite the fact
that he had already done them most effective service.</p>

<p>Jethro could not so far forget the first law of human nature
as not to debate and hesitate for a considerable while before
taking the decisive step.</p>

<p>"I might leave de door open," he reflected, "so dat if any ob
de heathen are hangin' round de outside waitin' for a chance to
shet me off, I kin dodge back and slam de door in dar faces. Ef
I don't see 'em till I git too fur to run back, I kin dive into
de woods or hide."</p>

<p>All this sounded well enough in theory, but the young man could
not lose sight of one thing: in point of fleetness he could not
compare with any of the Shawanoes. They could run him down, as
may be said, in a twinkling.</p>

<p>It was impossible for one so inexperienced as he to form a reasonable
guess of the intentions of the red men. It was curious, to say
the least, that one or two of them should linger in the vicinity
of the cabin after the departure of the pioneers for the block-house.
Even Simon Kenton could not have guessed their purpose.</p>

<p>"Dey couldn't hab seed me go in," thought Jethro, "for, if dey
did, dey would hab hollered to me and asked me who I was lookin'
fur; I'd gib 'em some sass, and den dar would hab been a row and
some ha'r pullin'."</p>

<p>The youth leaned against the side of the apartment a brief while
longer in intense cogitation, and then sighed.</p>

<p>"I ain't used to tinkin' so hard as dis; it exhorsts me."</p>

<p>To remedy which he groped his way to the huge bread box, a few
paces away. There was enough, left to furnish a person of ordinary
appetite with a good meal, but, when he ceased, nothing was left.</p>

<p>"Umph! dat rewives me; I feel stronger now &mdash;I'll do a little
more hard tinkin'&mdash;graciousnation, I's got it!" he exclaimed,
leaping from the floor in exultation; "why didn't I tink ob it
afore? I'll hold one ob dese boxes ober me, so dey can't see nuffin'
ob me, and den walk out ob de house and straight 'cross de clearin'
to de woods. When I got dar, I'll flung de box off en run! Dat's
de plan, suah I's born!"</p>
