"Behind him lay the gray Azores,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the gates of Hercules;<br/>
&nbsp;Before him not the ghost of shores,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before him only shoreless seas.<br/>
&nbsp;The good mate said: 'Now must we pray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lo! the very stars are gone;<br/>
&nbsp;Speak, Admiral, what shall I say?'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why say, sail on! and on!'

</p>
</div>
<p>There goes another cup. I am always forgetting and letting my
hands fly when I speak. Yes, Aunt Maria, I am coming."</p>

<p>"Hurry up with those dishes, Tabitha, I want you to run down
to the McKittrick's and get me that pattern she promised to loan
me. Child, what have you done? I don't know what we will eat out
of when you get all these dishes broken. How did you smash that?"</p>

<p>"It banged against the door when I opened it."</p>

<p>"I'll warrant you were haranguing around with another new piece.
Why don't you pay attention to what you are doing until it is
finished, and then do your reciting?"</p>

<p>"I just hate to wash dishes and dust and sweep, Aunt Maria, but
I forget all about it when I am speaking and get through with
them lots quicker."</p>

<p>"Yes, but see how many dishes you break, and the things you spill
because you will flap your arms about like a Dutch windmill instead
of keeping them in the dishpan where they belong. I do wish you
would learn to do one thing at a time."</p>

<p>"It is of no use, Aunt Maria. My thoughts won't stay on dishes,
try as hard as I will to keep them there. There isn't anything
splendid or inspiring in a pile of dirty dishes or those dusty
chairs, is there? But those poems are simply grand! I am the best
speaker at school, but I have to practice all I can to keep ahead.
Just listen to this:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the darkness peered that night.<br/>
Ah, darkest night! and then a speck&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A light! a light! a light! a light!<br/>
It grew&mdash;a star-lit flag unfurled!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It grew to be Time's burst of dawn;<br/>
He gained a world! he gave that world<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's watch-word: 'On! and on!'

</p>
</div>
<p>Isn't that perfectly grand?" The black eyes glowed, the face
lighted with enthusiasm and her whole form swayed with the stirring
inspiration of the lines.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria was visibly impressed. "Yes, it is fine and you certainly
do put life into anything you say; but that's just it, you put
too much life in it and smash up everything you touch. Hurry now
and get that pattern, for I want it as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"All right, I will be back in a jiffy." Tabitha snatched up her
sunbonnet and disappeared up the path toward town, still reciting,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sail on! sail on! and on!"

</p>
</div>
<p>And silence descended upon the cottage that bright Saturday morning,
for Aunt Maria was too much absorbed in some very important sewing
to pay any attention to the housework and cooking still waiting
to be done. In the midst of her thoughts as she sat puzzling over
a fashion book, came the sound of an incessant buzzing or hissing,
so unlike any noise she had ever heard that she paused in surprise
to listen.</p>

<p>"Now, what in creation has that child done this time?" she exclaimed
after a moment. "It doesn't sound like the teakettle or as if
she had left the water running. What can it be? I have to follow
her around like I would a baby&mdash;she is that careless!"</p>

<p>With an impatient sigh the woman dropped her work in the nearest
chair and shuffled out to the kitchen to investigate the peculiar
sound, formulating in her mind a lecture to be delivered to the
erring Tabitha upon her return from McKittrick's.</p>

<p>But the lecture was straightway forgotten in the sight that met
her gaze as she stepped into the room; and she stopped, paralyzed
with horror. In the middle of the floor, coiled as if ready to
strike, lay a long, hideous snake, its head raised, forked tongue
darting, and hissing that ceaseless buzzing note that had attracted
her attention in the first place; while around and around the
reptile circling nearer and ever nearer, walked the hermit's crooked-tailed,
cropped-eared cat, its back arched, tail erect, fur standing stiff
all over its body, and round yellow eyes glued in fascination
to the enemy luring her to death. Not a sound did the poor cat
make, but continued her march with a spasmodic rhythm that would
have seemed ludicrous had it not been so pathetically fearful.
Even Aunt Maria's arrival upon the scene did not break the charm,
and the horrified woman stood still in the doorway too frightened
to move, too terrified to call, too shocked to think. It was almost
as if the snake had cast its horrible spell over her, also.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din<br/>
&nbsp;Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin."

</p>
</div>
<p>The sound of Tabitha's hurrying steps outside, and the fresh
young voice thrilling over those familiar words brought the woman
to her senses, and with a cry of desperation, Aunt Maria caught
up the heavy ironing board in the corner and banged it with all
her strength full upon the hissing coil on the floor, regardless
of the fate of the cat. But the hysterical scream of the woman
had broken the charm, and the frightened feline made a frantic
dash for the screen door, spitting and clawing in its frenzy to
escape; while Aunt Maria, trembling and unnerved, sank into a
sobbing heap on the floor, too much shaken to think of escape.</p>

<p>Such was the scene that confronted Tabitha, as she rushed up
to the door, terrified by her aunt's cry and the wild scratching
of the imprisoned cat. As she flung open the screen there was
a flash of black, a quavering meow and pussy, crazed by her terrible
experience, streaked out of sight up the mountainside. But Tabitha
did not pause to watch her flight, so amazed was she at the sight
of Aunt Maria in tears huddled in the corner and shaking as if
with ague.</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Maria, what is the matter?" she cried in scared tones,
pausing just inside the door. "Are you hurt? Did the cat go mad?
Were you ironing and the board tipped over?" She stooped to lift
the heavy piece off the floor, and the woman suddenly found her
tongue: "Don't touch it, don't touch it! There's a snake under
it! Oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>"Are you bitten, Aunt Maria? Tell me, are you bitten?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that snake!"</p>

<p>"Shall I get the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that snake!"</p>

<p>Leaping across the board still pinning the reptile to the floor&mdash;dead
or alive she did not know &mdash;Tabitha clutched the hysterical
woman by the shoulder and shook her, demanding, "Tell me this
minute if you are hurt!"</p>

<p>But Aunt Maria continued her incoherent cries, still rocking
back and forth in her corner, too dazed to make any further explanations.
Tabitha surveyed the scene in perplexity. What should she do?
The Carsons were away from home and no one else near enough to
summon to her aid. If the snake had bitten her aunt, something
must be done at once. All the remedies for poisonous bites that
she had ever heard of seemed to have slipped from her memory.
It might be too late by the time a doctor could be called. Precious
seconds were rapidly passing. Supposing the snake were not dead
yet. She glanced at the board in the middle of the floor and fancied
it moved. In desperation she seized the teakettle from the stove
and let its scalding contents fly over the spot where the snake
might be.</p>

<p>At that instant her eyes fell upon the flask her father carried
on his trips among the mountains, and she remembered in a flash
that whiskey is a good antidote for rattlesnake bites. This might
not be a rattlesnake and it might not even be a poisonous one,
but she would take no chances. Snatching off the cap, she poured
a stream of the fiery liquid into the woman's open mouth, nearly
strangling her. Choking and spluttering, Aunt Maria tried to scream,
but could only gasp for breath, and to Tabitha's frightened eyes
her face took on a dying look. A pail of water stood on the stand
under the faucet, and catching up this, the child deluged the
convulsed form in the corner.</p>

<p>There was a sharp in-drawing of breath, a sound of mingled surprise
and wrath, and the irate aunt towered above the astonished girl,
her eyes blazing as Tabitha had never seen them before.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!" she managed to articulate, "of all outrageous
things I ever heard tell of in my life! What do you think you
are doing? Trying to murder me? Haven't I had enough scares this
morning without your burning the skin all off my mouth and throat
and choking me half to death and then trying to drown me? What
do you mean by it, I say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria, are you bit?"</p>

<p>"Bit, bit, bit, did you say? Yes, bit by that fire you poured
into me. What did you think bit me?" She had forgotten all about
the snake! And Tabitha had difficulty in explaining the situation
to her.</p>

<p>But that decided matters for Aunt Maria. She had hated the desert
ever since she had come there nearly four years ago, and this
was the last straw. What did she care if the snake did prove to
be a harmless thing? If she couldn't live in a house without being
in danger of a snake invasion at any time, she simply would not
live there at all. Her temper was thoroughly aroused, and when
Mr. Catt arrived home that night she made known her decision in
no gentle terms to him.</p>

<p>"I have lived in this forsaken hole just as long as I am going
to, Max Catt! I've routed out centipedes and scorpions and poison
bugs of all kinds until I am tired of it. Tabitha caught a baby
tarantula under her bed the other morning, and we found something
in the wood-pile last week that the folks at the hotel called
a Gila monster. Why, one can't stir around here in the spring
and summer without running the risk of getting killed by some
of your varmints, and I've had enough of it. I am going back to
civilization."</p>

<p>"Now, Maria, be sensible. That snake couldn't have got into the
house if the screen had been shut the way it should have been."</p>

<p>"I suppose the spiders and centipedes come in through the open
screen, too, don't they, and roost in the dishpan hanging on the
wall! That is where I found one not long ago, and I caught another
stowed away in my clothes when I went to dress yesterday. I don't
dare go to sleep nights any more for fear they will bite me. Life
is a perfect nightmare. It is bad enough to have to stay here
nine-tenths of the time with nobody in the house but Tabitha,
without being in constant fear of one's life all the time."</p>

<p>"How many people do you ever hear of being killed here on the
desert by centipedes or scorpions or tarantulas, or even snakes?
I tell you they aren't half as bad as they are made out to be."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't going to risk my life to find out how poisonous
they are, Maximilian, and you needn't think it."</p>

<p>"But Maria, what will become of Tabitha? She can't stay here
alone and keep house," he argued.</p>

<p>"There ain't any need of her staying here alone. She can go to
boarding school in Los Angeles with Carrie Carson. If you weren't
so thoroughly selfish you would have sent her there long ago with
your own money; but even now when that hermit she saved from being
burned up has given her enough money to put her clear through
college, you won't let her touch a penny of it."</p>

<p>"Maria Catt, how am I to know that money was honestly his? I
believe he stole it, and I don't care to get mixed up in any robbery
case. There is something underhanded about the deal or he would
have come to me with the money. I may be selfish but I am not
dishonest," he ended, hotly.</p>

<p>"Dr. Vane is satisfied, and he is a shrewd enough man to know
what is what. That hermit wasn't a robber and you know that without
any proof. He has mining claims here that prove where he got his
money."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't he turn it over to me, instead of to the doctor?
He has virtually made Dr. Vane trustee of those funds."</p>

<p>"That only shows he has some sense," his sister interrupted with
energy. "You don't know how to look after a child properly. But
you know well enough why he didn't come to you. How could he,
with you off chasing up syndicates and other fools to buy up your
claims&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those claims are worth money, Maria Catt, and some day I will
prove it to you. I wouldn't think of parting with one of them
if I had the money to work them the way they ought to be worked.
The 'Tom Cat' is particularly promising."</p>

<p>"That may be, but it is a sin and shame to pay more attention
to those old mines than you do to your children. Here is Tom working
his way through college when it is your duty to put him through&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told Tom long ago that if his wanted a college education he
would have to earn it. I can't see that University courses make
any better men of the boys that get them than experience does
of the boys that are not as well educated. In fact, I think&mdash;and
always did&mdash;that experience is the best teacher."</p>

<p>"You've got a grouch against the world because you think it hasn't
treated you right, and you're spitting your spite out on your
children. Here is Tabitha, now,&mdash;as bright a child as I ever laid
eyes on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And as ugly a one."</p>

<p>"Whose fault is that, Maximilian Catt? If she had been brought
up differently she would compare favorably with any child in the
country. She <em>does</em> compare favorably in spite of her bringing
up. The teacher says she never had such a bright scholar in all
her school experience. She learns surprisingly quick."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything surprising about that. The Catts are not
ignoramuses, none of them."</p>

<p>"I know that all right. I'm a Catt myself, and while I never
set myself up to be overly quick-witted, I think I have my share
of brains, and might have amounted to something if I had some
more education."</p>

<p>"Shucks! What are you always harping on that string for? Education
isn't everything in the world. Tabitha can get all the learning
a woman needs right here in this town."</p>

<p>"Because the girl hankers for knowledge, you are just determined
to make her as miserable as you can, and if she was half as much
Catt as you are, she would grow up just as spiteful and selfish;
but thank goodness, she has some of her mother's traits. If she
was a little mite and needed my care, I would stay, even if I
did get killed for my trouble; but she is big enough now so I
can leave without any qualms of conscience, and I am going to
leave. You can do just whatever you like with her, but I will
not stay here for love or money. Find a housekeeper if you can,
but whether or not you do, I am going back East just as soon as
I can get my things packed. I am absolutely unnerved over that
snake. I can't turn around without seeing the thing coiled ready
to spring, and that poor cat chasing around like a thing crazy;
and when I shut my eyes there are whole strings of 'em dancing
up and down like all possessed until I am half wild. That cat
never came back and I believe that is a warning. I am going to
follow its example."</p>

<p>No arguments could prevail to change her mind, and she immediately
began packing for her departure.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Catt, what was he to do? The possibility of Aunt Maria's
leaving them had never occurred to him, in spite of her oft repeated
threats; and now that she had suddenly determined to return to
her own home he was facing anything but an agreeable situation.</p>

<p>It was out of the question for Tabitha to take charge of the
housekeeping and stay there alone much of the time as she would
have to do when he was away. It was equally out of the question
to secure a reliable housekeeper in this little desert town. But
the idea of accepting the hermit's money and sending her away
to school was very repugnant to him and he was at a loss to know
what to do.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria's fright had given her unusual courage and she had
told him some unpleasant truths, things she would never have dared
say under ordinary circumstances; but after his surprise at her
daring had died down he faced her accusations, fought them out
one by one, recognized the truth of them and capitulated. Tabitha
could go away to boarding school. Words are inadequate to express
Tabitha's joy when told this delightful news; she was literally
entranced with the prospect.</p>

<p>The night that Aunt Maria had departed for her eastern home,
Tabitha sat disconsolately on the back steps, alternately patting
General Grant's head resting on her knee, and trying to study
her grammar lesson, but the nouns and verbs would become hopelessly
mixed, and the adjectives and adverbs fought scandalously with
each other. Mr. Catt, tilted back in his chair beside the window,
tried to read the city paper, but found his glance wandering constantly
to the lonely figure on the steps.</p>

<p>"I am a beast," he said to himself, as the brown hand swept a
tear off the page she was supposed to be studying. "This is no
place for a child like that. She has the making of a fine woman
in her, and I haven't done right by her. She <em>is</em> bright,
and Maria is right. Tabitha!"</p>

<p>She started violently. "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Come here."</p>

<p>Closing her book but keeping it clasped in her hands she went
inside the house and stood waiting to know his pleasure, surprise&mdash;almost
apprehension at this unexpected summons&mdash;showing plainly in her
face. "You were reciting some gabble on the steps a little bit
ago. Say it again."</p>

<p>"Gabble?" said the puzzled girl questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes, something about Ghent."</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't gabble! That is a masterpiece, teacher says.
Why, Robert Browning wrote that!"</p>

<p>"Um-hm. I'm not interested in Robert Browning. All I want is
that piece. Speak it."</p>

<p>Astonished and not comprehending this demand in the least, Tabitha
began falteringly, somewhat indifferently:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;<br/>
&nbsp;I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;"

</p>
</div>
<p>But as the familiar words slipped from her tongue, the spirit
of the piece came over her. Her voice grew tense with feeling
and the hands that never could stay still lent their aid to the
difficult art of expression.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br/>
&nbsp;Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br/>
&nbsp;The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,<br/>
&nbsp;'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;<br/>
&nbsp;Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,<br/>
&nbsp;And 'Gallop,' gasped Joris, 'for Aix is in sight!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Her hand shot out toward the imaginary Aix, the ill-fated grammar
was forgotten, it slipped from her loosened clasp, flew through
the air and struck the elder Catt a heavy blow in the stomach.</p>

<p>"Uh!" grunted the startled man, the tilted chair tipped uncertainly,
he clutched wildly at the smooth wall, and landed in an undignified
heap in the middle of the kitchen floor, rapping his head smartly
against the pantry door.</p>

<p>"Tabitha Catt!" She held her breath in dismay and waited for
the punishment she was sure would follow. "Go on with that piece!"</p>

<p>Nothing could have surprised her more than that command, and
for a brief moment speech forsook her. Then gathering up her scattered
wits, she finished her recitation with all the vim she could muster,
and waited. Though possessing a keen sense of the ludicrous, Tabitha's
own troubles never appealed to her in this light, and as she stood
looking down at the tall form sprawling on the floor, the amusing
side of the situation never occurred to her. She was too busy
wondering what would come next.</p>

<p>"Hm!" was the unexpected comment after a thrilling silence. "You
did well in the first part, but toward the end where the excitement
should increase, you let it fall. How would you like to go to
boarding school with Carrie in September?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad, if I only could!" The voice and face expressed all
the pent-up longings of the little heart, and Mr. Catt felt a
great lump rise in his throat as he watched this one small daughter
and realized his own shortcomings; but he swallowed it back and
said briefly, "If you are a good girl, I reckon maybe you can
go."</p>

<p>A long sigh of rapture burst from her, and seizing her father's
black head in her arms, she gave it a quick, impetuous hug. Then,
disconcerted by this unusual display of affection, she fled out
of the house and up to her seat on the mountainside, overlooking
the ruins of the hermit's hut, where she held an ecstatic thanksgiving
service all by herself.</p>
