<p>It was a surprising discovery for Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub
when they learned that the solitary Sauk warrior who welcomed
them to his camp, had in his possession the horse belonging to
the German lad, for which they had sought so long in vain.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!" exclaimed Otto, when they seated themselves
again by the fire; "if we gots him, won't it be shust too good!"</p>

<p>"Then I suppose your father and mother will be satisfied."</p>

<p>"Yaw&mdash;but holds on!" he added, looking down at his clothing;
"I have torn my trowsers shust a little, and dot will gif dem
de oxcuse to whip me."</p>

<p>"No; they will be too glad to get the colt back to mind such
a small thing as that; but isn't it one of the strangest things
in the world that this Sauk should find and bring him all the
way through the woods and across streams and prairies to this
point, and then that we should come upon him."</p>

<p>"It peats everydings," replied Otto; "but he can't told us how
he didn't do it."</p>

<p>"No; we shall have to wait till Deerfoot comes; he can talk the
Sauk tongue and it won't take him long to find out the whole story."</p>

<p>The boys felt so little misgiving about entrusting themselves
to the care of the stranger, that when they began to feel drowsy
they stretched out on the blanket, with their backs against each
other, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>An hour later, just as the Sauk was on the point of also turning
in for the night, Deerfoot made his appearance. His coming was
a surprise to the warrior, and at first caused him some alarm,
but, so soon as he learned who he was, his feelings underwent
a change, for, truth to tell, the Shawanoe was the very one whom
the Sauk had come so many miles to meet.</p>

<p>The story of the Sauk was impressive. He was the brother of Hay-uta,
and on the return of the latter to his home, he told of his encounter
with Deerfoot, and dwelt on the extraordinary words of his conqueror.
He, too, had heard something similar from the missionaries, whom
he had seen at different posts in the West, but like most of his
people he was indifferent to their arguments.</p>

<p>But the "sermon" preached by Deerfoot, through his kindred, got
hold of the Sauk, and would not let go. He affected to despise
the words, but he could not drive them from him. Some time afterward
Hay-uta told his brother he must hunt up the friendly Shawanoe,
and learn more of the Great Spirit whom he told him about. He
asked him to bear him company, but the Sauk declined, just as
all of us are prone to rebel against the better promptings of
our nature.</p>

<p>The time soon came however when he started to hunt, not only
for Hay-uta, but for Deerfoot also. Of necessity his search for
awhile was a blind one, but while threading his way through the
woods he found the horse of Otto Relstaub cropping the grass on
a slight stretch of prairie. Some curious fortune had given him
his liberty and led him into that section.</p>

<p>The brother was so prompt in following Hay-uta, that he kept
to his trail long after the latter had found Deerfoot and Jack
Carleton, but a peculiar shame-facedness held him back from joining
them. Once or twice he resolved to overtake them, but each time
he shrank back, and finally lingered so long that he lost the
trail altogether.</p>

<p>But that restless longing for the great light, of which he had
only the dim glimmerings, kept his face turned westward, while
he hoped and yet dreaded to meet the young Shawanoe, who, unsuspected
by himself, was the cause of his strange discontent.</p>

<p>The meeting took place in the manner already told. It was Deerfoot
who found the Sauk instead of the Sauk who found him. In a tender,
sympathetic voice the Shawanoe gave the other the particulars
of his brother's death, making clear to him that when he crossed
the dark river it was to enter the hunting grounds of the true
Great Spirit, who beckoned him thither. The Sauk showed no grief
over the loss of his kindred, though he mourned him with an emotion
that was a singular mixture of sadness and pleasure. He seemed
more interested in the story which Deerfoot told him about the
One who died that all men might live, and whose approving smile
could be won by whomsoever would do His will.</p>

<p>The two warriors lay a long time by the camp-fire, which was
replenished several times, while the Shawanoe read from his Bible
and discoursed of the momentous truths contained therein, and
the listener questioned and answered, and appropriated the revelations
thus made to him. Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, sowed good seed on that
evening a long time ago; but the full fruitage thereof shall never
be known until the last great day, for which all others were made.</p>

<p>When the Sauk learned that the horse which he had found astray
in the wilderness belonged to one of the sleeping boys, he said
it should be returned to him on the morrow. Deerfoot encouraged
him by replying that such action would always please the Great
Spirit, who knew the thoughts, words and deeds of every person
that lived.</p>

<p>While the boys were sleeping, and when the gray light of morning
was creeping over the forest, Deerfoot scouted through the country
surrounding them. As he anticipated, he found no sign of enemies.
The Pawnees had been handled so roughly that they made no further
attempt to molest the little party that seemed to them to be under
the special care of the Evil One.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub were permitted to sleep until
breakfast was ready; then, when aroused, they were in high spirits
over the prospect before them. The young Kentuckian, however,
was saddened by the tidings of the death of Hay-uta, the brother
of the Sauk who had befriended him.</p>

<p>Otto was informed that the lost colt was his property again,
and all that he had to do was to prevent him from wandering beyond
his reach, since no such good fortune was likely to repeat itself.</p>

<p>Three days later the Sauk bade them good-by, his course to his
village rendering a divergence necessary. When in sight of the
humble cabins of Martinsville, Deerfoot parted from Jack and Otto,
expressing the hope that he would soon meet them again; when urged
to visit his friends in the settlement he shook his head, making
a reply which was not fully understood.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot must hasten; he is wanted by others; he has no time
to lose."</p>

<p>Then flirting the gun given him by Hay-uta over his head, he
added with a smile:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot uses the bow and arrows no more; the rifle is his weapon."</p>

<p>Waving them farewell again, he soon vanished from sight in the
forest, and they saw him no more.</p>

<p>I need not tell you of the welcome Jack Carleton received from
his mother and friends. He promised his anxious parent that he
would never leave her again, and his pledge was not broken.</p>

<p>Perhaps the long absence of Otto softened his father and mother's
hearts, or it may have been the return of the lost colt moved
them to greater kindness. Be that as it may, hence forward all
went smoothly in the Relstaub household, and the hardships and
sufferings of Otto, so far as his parents were concerned, were
ended forever.</p>

<p>From this time forth, as Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, declared, the
rifle was his weapon. Great as was his skill with the bow and
arrow, it could not equal that which he displayed with his gun,
and I am confident you will agree with me when you come to read
"The Hunters of the Ozark", which will form number one of the
<em>DEERFOOT SERIES</em>.</p>
