<p>The letters were gone!</p>

<p>Having once made up his mind to the fact of their disappearance,
there was nothing to do but accept it. Anthony realized very well
that he could not pursue Giuseppe through the corridors of the
Blitz Hotel. To do so was to court undesired publicity, and in
all probability to fail in his object all the same.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion that Giuseppe had mistaken the packet
of letters, enclosed as they were in the other wrappings, for
the Memoirs themselves. It was likely therefore that when he discovered
his mistake he would make another attempt to get hold of the Memoirs.
For this attempt Anthony intended to be fully prepared.</p>

<p>Another plan that occurred to him was to advertize discreetly
for the return of the package of letters. Supposing Giuseppe to
be an emissary of the Comrades of the Red Hand, or, which seemed
to Anthony more probable, to be employed by the Loyalist party,
the letters could have no possible interest for either employer
and he would probably jump at the chance of obtaining a small
sum of money for their return.</p>

<p>Having thought out all this, Anthony returned to bed and slept
peacefully until morning. He did not fancy that Giuseppe would
be anxious for a second encounter that night.</p>

<p>Anthony got up with his plan of campaign fully thought out. He
had a good breakfast, glanced at the papers which were full of
the new discoveries of oil in Herzoslovakia, and then demanded
an interview with the manager, and, being Anthony Cade, with a
gift for getting his own way by means of quiet determination,
he obtained what he asked for.</p>

<p>The manager, a Frenchman with an exquisitely suave manner, received
him in his private office.</p>

<p>"You wished to see me, I understand, Mr.—er—McGrath?"</p>

<p>"I did. I arrived at your hotel yesterday afternoon, and I had
dinner served to me in my own rooms by a waiter whose name was
Giuseppe."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I dare say we have a waiter of that name," agreed the manager
indifferently.</p>

<p>"I was struck by something unusual in the waiter’s manner, but
thought nothing more of it at the time. Later, in the night, I
was awakened by the sound of some one moving softly about the
room. I switched on the light, and found this same Giuseppe in
the act of rifling my leather suit-case."</p>

<p>The manager’s indifference had completely disappeared now.</p>

<p>"But I have heard nothing of this," he exclaimed. "Why was I
not informed sooner?"</p>

<p>"The man and I had a brief struggle—he was armed with a knife
by the way. In the end he succeeded in making off by way of the
window."</p>

<p>"What did you do then, Mr. McGrath?"</p>

<p>"I examined the contents of my suit-case."</p>

<p>"Had anything been taken?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of—importance," said Anthony slowly.</p>

<p>The manager leaned back with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," he remarked. "But you will allow me to say,
Mr. McGrath, that I do not quite understand your attitude in the
matter. You made no attempt to arouse the hotel? To pursue the
thief?"</p>

<p>Anthony shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Nothing of value had been taken, as I tell you. I am aware,
of course, that strictly speaking it is a case for the police——"</p>

<p>He paused, and the manager murmured without any particular enthusiasm:</p>

<p>"For the police—of course——"</p>

<p>"In any case, I was fairly certain that the man would manage
to make good his escape, and since nothing was taken why bother
with the police?"</p>

<p>The manager smiled a little.</p>

<p>"I see that you realize, Mr. McGrath, that I am not at all anxious
to have the police called in. From my point of view it is always
disastrous. If the newspapers can get hold of anything connected
with a big fashionable hotel such as this, they always run it
for all it is worth, no matter how insignificant the real subject
matter may be."</p>

<p>"Quite so," agreed Anthony. "Now I told you that nothing of value
had been taken, and that was perfectly true in a sense. Nothing
of any value to the thief was taken, but he got hold of something
which is of considerable value to me."</p>

<p>"Ah?"</p>

<p>"Letters, you understand."</p>

<p>An expression of superhuman discretion, only to be achieved by
a Frenchman, settled down upon the manager’s face.</p>

<p>"I comprehend," he murmured. "But perfectly. Naturally, it is
not a matter for the police."</p>

<p>"We are quite agreed upon that point. But you will understand
that I have every intention of recovering these letters. In the
part of the world where I come from, people are used to doing
things for themselves. What I require from you therefore is the
fullest possible information you can give me about this waiter,
Giuseppe."</p>

<p>"I see no objection to that," said the manager after a moment
or two’s pause. "I cannot give you the information offhand, of
course, but if you will return in half an hour’s time I will have
everything ready to lay before you."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. That will suit me admirably."</p>

<p>In half an hour’s time, Anthony returned to the office again
to find that the manager had been as good as his word. Jotted
down upon a piece of paper were all the relevant facts known about
Giuseppe Manelli.</p>

<p>"He came to us, you see, about three months ago. A skilled and
experienced waiter. Has given complete satisfaction. He has been
in England about five years."</p>

<p>Together the two men ran over a list of the hotels and restaurants
where the Italian had worked. One fact struck Anthony as being
possibly of significance. At two of the hotels in question there
had been serious robberies during the time that Giuseppe was employed
there, though no suspicion of any kind had attached to him in
either case. Still, the fact was significant.</p>

<p>Was Giuseppe merely a clever hotel thief? Had his search of Anthony’s
suit-case been merely part of his habitual professional tactics?
He might just possibly have had the packet of letters in his hand
at the moment when Anthony switched on the light, and have shoved
it into his pocket mechanically so as to have his hands free.
In that case, the thing was mere plain or garden robbery.</p>

<p>Against that, there was to be put the man’s excitement of the
evening before when he had caught sight of the papers lying on
the table. There had been no money or object of value there such
as would excite the cupidity of an ordinary thief.</p>

<p>No, Anthony felt convinced that Giuseppe had been acting as a
tool for some outside agency. With the information supplied to
him by the manager, it might be possible to learn something about
Giuseppe’s private life, and so finally track him down. He gathered
up the sheet of paper and rose.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much indeed. It’s quite unnecessary to ask, I
suppose, whether Giuseppe is still in the hotel?"</p>

<p>The manager smiled.</p>

<p>"His bed was not slept in, and all his things have been left
behind. He must have rushed straight out after his attack upon
you. I don’t think there is much chance of our seeing him again."</p>

<p>"I imagine not. Well, thank you very much indeed. I shall be
staying on here for the present."</p>

<p>"I hope you will be successful in your task, but I confess that
I am rather doubtful."</p>

<p>"I always hope for the best."</p>

<p>One of Anthony’s first proceedings was to question some of the
other waiters who had been friendly with Giuseppe, but he obtained
very little to go upon. He wrote out an advertisement on the lines
he had planned, and had it sent to five of the most widely read
newspapers. He was just about to go out and visit the restaurant
at which Giuseppe had been previously employed when the telephone
rang. Anthony took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hullo, what is it?"</p>

<p>A toneless voice replied.</p>

<p>"Am I speaking to Mr. McGrath?"</p>

<p>"You are. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"This is Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins. Just a minute, please.
I will put you through to Mr. Balderson."</p>

<p>"Our worthy publishers," thought Anthony. "So they are getting
worried too, are they? They needn’t. There’s a week to run still."</p>

<p>A hearty voice struck suddenly upon his ear.</p>

<p>"Hullo! That Mr. McGrath?"</p>

<p>"Speaking."</p>

<p>"I’m Mr. Balderson of Balderson and Hodgkins. What about that
manuscript, Mr. McGrath?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Anthony, "what about it?"</p>

<p>"Everything about it. I understand, Mr. McGrath, that you have
just arrived in this country from South Africa. That being so,
you can’t possibly understand the position. There’s going to be
trouble about that manuscript, Mr. McGrath, big trouble. Sometimes
I wish we’d never said we’d handle it."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"I assure you it’s so. At present I’m anxious to get it into
my possession as quickly as possible, so as to have a couple of
copies made. Then, if the original is destroyed—well, no harm
will be done."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Anthony.</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect it sounds absurd to you, Mr. McGrath. But, I assure
you, you don’t appreciate the situation. There’s a determined
effort being made to prevent its ever reaching this office. I
say to you quite frankly and without humbug that if you attempt
to bring it yourself it’s ten to one that you’ll never get here."</p>

<p>"I doubt that," said Anthony. "When I want to get anywhere, I
usually do."</p>

<p>"You’re up against a very dangerous lot of people. I wouldn’t
have believed it myself a month ago. I tell you, Mr. McGrath,
we’ve been bribed and threatened and cajoled by one lot and another
until we don’t know whether we’re on our heads or our heels. My
suggestion is that you do not attempt to bring the manuscript
here. One of our people will call upon you at the hotel and take
possession of it."</p>

<p>"And supposing the gang does him in?" asked Anthony.</p>

<p>"The responsibility would then be ours—not yours. You would have
delivered it to our representative and obtained a written discharge.
The cheque for—er—a thousand pounds which we are instructed to
hand to you will not be available until Wednesday next by the
terms of our agreement with the executors of the late—er—author—you
know whom I mean, but if you insist I will send my own cheque
for that amount by the messenger."</p>

<p>Anthony reflected for a minute or two. He had intended to keep
the Memoirs until the last day of grace, because he was anxious
to see for himself what all the fuss was about. Nevertheless,
he realized the force of the publisher’s arguments.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, with a little sigh. "Have it your own way.
Send your man along. And if you don’t mind sending that cheque
as well I’d rather have it now, as I may be going out of England
before next Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. McGrath. Our representative will call upon you
first thing to-morrow morning. It will be wiser not to send anyone
direct from the office. Our Mr. Holmes lives in South London.
He will call in on his way to us, and will give you a receipt
for the package. I suggest that to-night you should place a dummy
packet in the manager’s safe. Your enemies will get to hear of
this, and it will prevent any attack being made upon your apartments
to-night."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will do as you direct."</p>

<p>Anthony hung up the receiver with a thoughtful face.</p>

<p>Then he went on with his interrupted plan of seeking news of
the slippery Giuseppe. He drew a complete blank, however. Giuseppe
had worked at the restaurant in question, but nobody seemed to
know anything of his private life or associates.</p>

<p>"But I’ll get you, my lad," murmured Anthony, between his teeth.
"I’ll get you yet. It’s only a matter of time."</p>

<p>His second night in London was entirely peaceful.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the following morning, the card of Mr. Holmes
from Messrs. Balderson and Hodgkins was sent up, and Mr. Holmes
followed it. A small, fair man with a quiet manner. Anthony handed
over the manuscript, and received in exchange a cheque for a thousand
pounds. Mr. Holmes packed up the manuscript in the small brown
bag he carried, wished Anthony good morning, and departed. The
whole thing seemed very tame.</p>

<p>"But perhaps he’ll be murdered on the way there," Anthony murmured
aloud, as he stared idly out of the window. "I wonder now—I very
much wonder."</p>

<p>He put the cheque in an envelope, enclosed a few lines of writing
with it, and sealed it up carefully. Jimmy, who had been more
or less in funds at the time of his encounter with Anthony at
Bulawayo, had advanced him a substantial sum of money which was,
as yet, practically untouched.</p>

<p>"If one’s job’s done with, the other isn’t," said Anthony to
himself. "Up to now, I’ve bungled it. But never say die. I think
that, suitably disguised, I shall go and have a look at 487, Pont
Street."</p>

<p>He packed his belongings, went down and paid his bill, and ordered
his luggage to be put on a taxi. Suitably rewarding those who
stood in his path, most of whom had done nothing whatever materially
to add to his comfort, he was on the point of being driven off,
when a small boy rushed down the steps with a letter.</p>

<p>"Just come for you, this very minute, sir."</p>

<p>With a sigh, Anthony produced yet another shilling. The taxi
groaned heavily and jumped forward with a hideous crashing of
gears, and Anthony opened the letter.</p>

<p>It was rather a curious document. He had to read it four times
before he could be sure of what it was all about. Put in plain
English (the letter was not in plain English, but in the peculiar
involved style common to missives issued by Government officials)
it presumed that Mr. McGrath was arriving in England from South
Africa to-day—Thursday, it referred obliquely to the Memoirs of
Count Stylptitch, and begged Mr. McGrath to do nothing in the
matter until he had had a confidential conversation with Mr. George
Lomax, and certain other parties whose magnificence was vaguely
hinted at. It also contained a definite invitation to go down
to Chimneys as the guest of Lord Caterham, on the following day,
Friday.</p>

<p>A mysterious and thoroughly obscure communication. Anthony enjoyed
it very much.</p>

<p>"Dear old England," he murmured affectionately. "Two days behind
the times, as usual. Rather a pity. Still, I can’t go down to
Chimneys under false pretences. I wonder, though, if there’s an
inn handy? Mr. Anthony Cade might stay at the inn without anyone
being the wiser."</p>

<p>He leaned out of the window, and gave new directions to the taxi
driver, who acknowledged them with a snort of contempt.</p>

<p>The taxi drew up before one of London’s more obscure hostelries.
The fare, however, was paid on a scale befitting its point of
departure.</p>

<p>Having booked a room in the name of Anthony Cade, Anthony passed
into a dingy writing-room, took out a sheet of notepaper stamped
with the legend Hotel Blitz, and wrote rapidly.</p>

<p>He explained that he had arrived on the preceding Tuesday, that
he had handed over the manuscript in question to Messrs. Balderson
and Hodgkins, and he regretfully declined the kind invitation
of Lord Caterham as he was leaving England almost immediately.
He signed the letter "Yours faithfully, James McGrath."</p>

<p>"And now," said Anthony, as he affixed the stamp to the envelope.
"To business. Exit James McGrath, and Enter Anthony Cade."</p>
