		<h3>FIRST VOICE</h3>
		<p>But tell me, tell me! speak again,<br />
			Thy soft response renewing--<br />
			What makes that ship drive on so fast?<br />
			What is the OCEAN doing?
		</p>
		<h3>SECOND VOICE</h3>
		<p>Still as a slave before his lord,<br />
			The OCEAN hath no blast;<br />
			His great bright eye most silently<br />
			Up to the Moon is cast--
		</p>
		<p>If he may know which way to go;<br />
			For she guides him smooth or grim<br />
			See, brother, see! how graciously<br />
			She looketh down on him.
		</p>
		<h3>FIRST VOICE</h3>
		<p>But why drives on that ship so fast,<br />
			Without or wave or wind?
		</p>
		<h3>SECOND VOICE</h3>
		<p>The air is cut away before,<br />
			And closes from behind.
		</p>
		<p>Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high<br />
			Or we shall be belated:<br />
			For slow and slow that ship will go,<br />
			When the Mariner's trance is abated.
		</p>
		<p>I woke, and we were sailing on<br />
			As in a gentle weather:<br />
			'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;<br />
			The dead men stood together.
		</p>
		<p>All stood together on the deck,<br />
			For a charnel-dungeon fitter:<br />
			All fixed on me their stony eyes,<br />
			That in the Moon did glitter.
		</p>
		<p>The pang, the curse, with which they died,<br />
			Had never passed away:<br />
			I could not draw my eyes from theirs,<br />
			Nor turn them up to pray.
		</p>
		<p>And now this spell was snapt: once more<br />
			I viewed the ocean green.<br />
			And looked far forth, yet little saw<br />
			Of what had else been seen--
		</p>
		<p>Like one that on a lonesome road<br />
			Doth walk in fear and dread,<br />
			And having once turned round walks on,<br />
			And turns no more his head;<br />
			Because he knows, a frightful fiend<br />
			Doth close behind him tread.
		</p>
		<p>But soon there breathed a wind on me,<br />
			Nor sound nor motion made:<br />
			Its path was not upon the sea,<br />
			In ripple or in shade.
		</p>
		<p>It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek<br />
			Like a meadow-gale of spring--<br />
			It mingled strangely with my fears,<br />
			Yet it felt like a welcoming.
		</p>
		<p>Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<br />
			Yet she sailed softly too:<br />
			Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--<br />
			On me alone it blew.
		</p>
		<p>Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed<br />
			The light-house top I see?<br />
			Is this the hill? is this the kirk?<br />
			Is this mine own countree!
		</p>
		<p>We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,<br />
			And I with sobs did pray--<br />
			O let me be awake, my God!<br />
			Or let me sleep alway.
		</p>
		<p>The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<br />
			So smoothly it was strewn!<br />
			And on the bay the moonlight lay,<br />
			And the shadow of the moon.
		</p>
		<p>The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,<br />
			That stands above the rock:<br />
			The moonlight steeped in silentness<br />
			The steady weathercock.
		</p>
		<p>And the bay was white with silent light,<br />
			Till rising from the same,<br />
			Full many shapes, that shadows were,<br />
			In crimson colours came.
		</p>
		<p>A little distance from the prow<br />
			Those crimson shadows were:<br />
			I turned my eyes upon the deck--<br />
			Oh, Christ! what saw I there!
		</p>
		<p>Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<br />
			And, by the holy rood!<br />
			A man all light, a seraph-man,<br />
			On every corse there stood.
		</p>
		<p>This seraph band, each waved his hand:<br />
			It was a heavenly sight!<br />
			They stood as signals to the land,<br />
			Each one a lovely light:
		</p>
		<p>This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<br />
			No voice did they impart--<br />
			No voice; but oh! the silence sank<br />
			Like music on my heart.
		</p>
		<p>But soon I heard the dash of oars;<br />
			I heard the Pilot's cheer;<br />
			My head was turned perforce away,<br />
			And I saw a boat appear.
		</p>
		<p>The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,<br />
			I heard them coming fast:<br />
			Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy<br />
			The dead men could not blast.
		</p>
		<p>I saw a third--I heard his voice:<br />
			It is the Hermit good!<br />
			He singeth loud his godly hymns<br />
			That he makes in the wood.<br />
			He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away<br />
			The Albatross's blood.
		</p>
