The face of carthoris of Helium gave no token of the
emotions that convulsed him inwardly as he heard from
the lips of Hal Vas that Helium was at war with Dusar,
and that fate had thrown him into the service of the enemy.
<P>
That he might utilize this opportunity to the good of
Helium scarce sufficed to outweigh the chagrin he felt
that he was not fighting in the open at the head of his
own loyal troops.
<P>
To escape the Dusarians might prove an easy matter;
and then again it might not.  Should they suspect his
loyalty (and the loyalty of an impressed panthan was always
open to suspicion), he might not find an opportunity to
elude their vigilance until after the termination of the war,
which might occur within days, or, again, only after long
and weary years of bloodshed.
<P>
He recalled that history recorded wars in which actual
military operations had been carried on without cessation
for five or six hundred years, and even now there were
nations upon Barsoom with which Helium had made no peace
within the history of man.
<P>
The outlook was not cheering.  He could not guess that
within a few hours he would be blessing the fate that had
thrown him into the service of Dusar.
<P>
"Ah!" exclaimed Hal Vas.  "Here is my father now.
Kaor! Vas Kor.  Here is one you will be glad to meet--
a doughty panthan--"  He hesitated.
<P>
"Turjun," interjected Carthoris, seizing upon the first
appellation that occurred to him.
<P>
As he spoke his eyes crossed quickly to the tall warrior
who was entering the room.  Where before had he seen
that giant figure, that taciturn countenance, and the
livid sword-cut from temple to mouth?
<P>
"Vas Kor," repeated Carthoris mentally.  "Vas Kor!"
Where had he seen the man before?
<P>
And then the noble spoke, and like a flash it all came
back to Carthoris--the forward servant upon the landing-
stage at Ptarth that time that he had been explaining the
intricacies of his new compass to Thuvan Dihn; the lone
slave that had guarded his own hangar that night he had
left upon his ill-fated journey for Ptarth--the journey
that had brought him so mysteriously to far Aaanthor.
<P>
"Vas Kor," he repeated aloud, "blessed be your ancestors
for this meeting," nor did the Dusarian guess the wealth
of meaning that lay beneath that hackneyed phrase with
which a Barsoomian acknowledges an introduction.
<P>
"And blessed be yours, Turjun," replied Vas Kor.
<P>
Now came the introduction of Kar Komak to Vas Kor,
and as Carthoris went through the little ceremony there
came to him the only explanation he might make to account
for the white skin and auburn hair of the bowman;
for he feared that the truth might not be believed and
thus suspicion be cast upon them both from the beginning.
<P>
"Kar Komak," he explained, "is, as you can see, a thern.
He has wandered far from his icebound southern temples
in search of adventure.  I came upon him in the pits of
Aaanthor; but though I have known him so short a time,
I can vouch for his bravery and loyalty."
<P>
Since the destruction of the fabric of their false
religion by John Carter, the majority of the therns had
gladly accepted the new order of things, so that it was
now no longer uncommon to see them mingling with the
multitudes of red men in any of the great cities of the
outer world, so Vas Kor neither felt nor expressed any
great astonishment.
<P>
All during the interview Carthoris watched, catlike,
for some indication that Vas Kor recognized in the
battered panthan the erstwhile gorgeous Prince of Helium;
but the sleepless nights, the long days of marching and
fighting, the wounds and the dried blood had evidently
sufficed to obliterate the last remnant of his likeness
to his former self; and then Vas Kor had seen him but twice
in all his life.  Little wonder that he did not know him.
<P>
During the evening Vas Kor announced that on
the morrow they should depart north toward Dusar,
picking up recruits at various stations along the way.
<P>
In a great field behind the house a flier lay--a fair-
sized cruiser-transport that would accommodate many men,
yet swift and well armed also.  Here Carthoris slept,
and Kar Komak, too, with the other recruits, under guard
of the regular Dusarian warriors that manned the craft.
<P>
Toward midnight Vas Kor returned to the vessel from his
son's house, repairing at once to his cabin.  Carthoris,
with one of the Dusarians, was on watch.  It was with
difficulty that the Heliumite repressed a cold smile as
the noble passed within a foot of him--within a foot of
the long, slim, Heliumitic blade that swung in his harness.
<P>
How easy it would have been!  How easy to avenge the
cowardly trick that had been played upon him--to avenge
Helium and Ptarth and Thuvia!
<P>
But his hand moved not toward the dagger's hilt,
for  first Vas Kor must serve a better purpose--
he might know where Thuvia of Ptarth lay hidden now,
if it had truly been Dusarians that had spirited her
away during the fight before Aaanthor.
<P>
And then, too, there was the instigator of the entire
foul plot.  HE must pay the penalty; and who better than
Vas Kor could lead the Prince of Helium to Astok of Dusar?
<P>
Faintly out of the night there came to Carthoris's ears
the purring of a distant motor.  He scanned the heavens.
<P>
Yes, there it was far in the north, dimly outlined against
the dark void of space that stretched illimitably beyond it,
the faint suggestion of a flier passing, unlighted, through
the Barsoomian night.
<P>
Carthoris, knowing not whether the craft might be
friend or foe of Dusar, gave no sign that he had seen,
but turned his eyes in another direction, leaving the matter
to the Dusarian who stood watch with him.
<P>
Presently the fellow discovered the oncoming craft, and
sounded the low alarm which brought the balance of the
watch and an officer from their sleeping silks and furs
upon the deck near by.
<P>
The cruiser-transport lay without lights, and,
resting as she was upon the ground, must have been
entirely invisible to the oncoming flier, which all
presently recognized as a small craft.
<P>
It soon became evident that the stranger intended making
a landing, for she was now spiraling slowly above them,
dropping lower and lower in each graceful curve.
<P>
"It is the Thuria," whispered one of the Dusarian warriors.
"I would know her in the blackness of the pits among ten
thousand other craft."
<P>
"Right you are!" exclaimed Vas Kor, who had come
on deck.  And then he hailed:
<P>
"Kaor, Thuria!"
<P>
"Kaor!" came presently from above after a brief silence.
Then:  "What ship?"
<P>
"Cruiser-transport Kalksus, Vas Kor of Dusar."
<P>
"Good!" came from above.  "Is there safe landing alongside?"
<P>
"Yes, close in to starboard.  Wait, we will show our
lights," and a moment later the smaller craft settled
close beside the Kalksus, and the lights of the
latter were immediately extinguished once more.
<P>
Several figures could be seen slipping over the side of
the Thuria and advancing toward the Kalksus.  Ever suspicious,
the Dusarians stood ready to receive the visitors as
friends or foes as closer inspection might prove them.
Carthoris stood quite near the rail, ready to take sides
with the new-comers should chance have it that they were
Heliumites playing a bold stroke of strategy upon this
lone Dusarian ship.  He had led like parties himself,
and knew that such a contingency was quite possible.
<P>
But the face of the first man to cross the rail
undeceived him with a shock that was not at all
unpleasurable--it was the face of Astok, Prince of Dusar.
<P>
Scarce noticing the others upon the deck of the Kalksus,
Astok strode forward to accept Vas Kor's greeting,
then he summoned the noble below.  The warriors and
officers returned to their sleeping silks and furs, and once
more the deck was deserted except for the Dusarian warrior
and Turjun, the panthan, who stood guard.
<P>
The latter walked quietly to and fro.  The former leaned
across the rail, wishing for the hour that would bring
him relief.  He did not see his companion approach the
lights of the cabin of Vas Kor.  He did not see him
stoop with ear close pressed to a tiny ventilator.
<P>
"May the white apes take us all," cried Astok ruefully,
"if we are not in as ugly a snarl as you have ever seen!
Nutus thinks that we have her in hiding far away from Dusar.
He has bidden me bring her here."
<P>
He paused.  No man should have heard from his lips the
thing he was trying to tell.  It should have been for
ever the secret of Nutus and Astok, for upon it rested
the safety of a throne.  With that knowledge any man
could wrest from the Jeddak of Dusar whatever he listed.
<P>
But Astok was afraid, and he wanted from this older
man the suggestion of an alternative.  He went on.
<P>
"I am to kill her," he whispered, looking fearfully around.
"Nutus merely wishes to see the body that he may know
his commands have been executed.  I am now supposed
to be gone to the spot where we have her hidden
that I may fetch her in secrecy to Dusar.  None is to
know that she has ever been in the keeping of a Dusarian. 
I do not need to tell you what would befall Dusar should
Ptarth and Helium and Kaol ever learn the truth."
<P>
The jaws of the listener at the ventilator clicked
together with a vicious snap.  Before he had but guessed
at the identity of the subject of this conversation.  Now
he knew.  And they were to kill her!  His muscular fingers
clenched until the nails bit into the palms.
<P>
"And you wish me to go with you while you fetch
her to Dusar," Vas Kor was saying.  "Where is she?"
<P>
Astok bent close and whispered into the other's ear.
The suggestion of a smile crossed the cruel features of
Vas Kor.  He realized the power that lay within his grasp.
He should be a jed at least.
<P>
"And how may I help you, my Prince?" asked the older man suavely.
<P>
"I cannot kill her," said Astok.  "Issus!  I cannot do it!
When she turns those eyes upon me my heart becomes water."
<P>
Vas Kor's eyes narrowed.
<P>
"And you wish--"  He paused, the interrogation unfinished, yet complete.
<P>
Astok nodded.
<P>
"YOU do not love her," he said.
<P>
"But I love my life--though I am only a lesser noble,"
he concluded meaningly.
<P>
"You shall be a greater noble--a noble of the first rank!"
exclaimed Astok.
<P>
"I would be a jed," said Vas Kor bluntly.
<P>
Astok hesitated.
<P>
"A jed must die before there can be another jed," he pleaded.
<P>
"Jeds have died before," snapped Vas Kor.  "It would
doubtless be not difficult for you to find a jed you do
not love, Astok--there are many who do not love you."
<P>
Already Vas Kor was commencing to presume upon his
power over the young prince.  Astok was quick to note
and appreciate the subtle change in his lieutenant.
A cunning scheme entered his weak and wicked brain.
<P>
"As you say, Vas Kor!" he exclaimed.  "You shall be a jed
when the thing is done," and then, to himself:  "Nor will
it then be difficult for me to find a jed I do not love."
<P>
"When shall we return to Dusar?" asked the noble.
<P>
"At once," replied Astok.  "Let us get under way now--
there is naught to keep you here?"
<P>
"I had intended sailing on the morrow, picking up such
recruits as the various Dwars of the Roads might have
collected for me, as we returned to Dusar."
<P>
"Let the recruits wait," said Astok.  "Or, better still,
come you to Dusar upon the Thuria, leaving the Kalksus
to follow and pick up the recruits."
<P>
"Yes," acquiesced Vas Kor; "that is the better plan.
Come; I am ready," and he rose to accompany Astok
to the latter's flier.
<P>
The listener at the ventilator came to his feet slowly,
like an old man.  His face was drawn and pinched
and very white beneath the light copper of his skin.
She was to die!  And he helpless to avert the tragedy.
He did not even know where she was imprisoned.
<P>
The two men were ascending from the cabin to the deck. 
Turjun, the panthan, crept close to the companionway,
his sinuous fingers closing tightly upon the hilt of
his dagger.  Could he despatch them both before he was
overpowered?  He smiled.  He could slay an entire utan
of her enemies in his present state of mind.
<P>
They were almost abreast of him now.  Astok was speaking.
<P>
"Bring a couple of your men along, Vas Kor," he said.
"We are short-handed upon the Thuria, so quickly did we depart."
<P>
The panthan's fingers dropped from the dagger's hilt.
His quick mind had grasped here a chance for succouring
Thuvia of Ptarth.  He might be chosen as one to accompany
the assassins, and once he had learned where the captive
lay he could dispatch Astok and Vas Kor as well as now.
To kill them before he knew where Thuvia was hid was
simply to leave her to death at the hands of others;
for sooner or later Nutus would learn her whereabouts,
and Nutus, Jeddak of Dusar, could not afford to let her live.
<P>
Turjun put himself in the path of Vas Kor that he
might not be overlooked.  The noble aroused the men
sleeping upon the deck, but always before him the
strange panthan whom he had recruited that same day
found means for keeping himself to the fore.
<P>
Vas Kor turned to his lieutenant, giving instruction
for the bringing of the Kalksus to Dusar, and the
gathering up of the recruits; then he signed to two
warriors who stood close behind the padwar.
<P>
"You two accompany us to the Thuria," he said, "and
put yourselves at the disposal of her dwar."
<P>
It was dark upon the deck of the Kalksus, so Vas Kor
had not a good look at the faces of the two he chose;
but that was of no moment, for they were but common
warriors to assist with the ordinary duties upon a flier,
and to fight if need be.
<P>
One of the two was Kar Komak, the bowman.  The other
was not Carthoris.
<P>
The Heliumite was mad with disappointment.  He snatched
his dagger from his harness; but already Astok had left
the deck of the Kalksus, and he knew that before he could
overtake him, should he dispatch Vas Kor, he would be killed
by the Dusarian warriors, who now were thick upon the deck.
With either one of the two alive Thuvia was in as great
danger as though both lived--it must be both!
<P>
As Vas Kor descended to the ground Carthoris boldly
followed him, nor did any attempt to halt him, thinking,
doubtless, that he was one of the party.
<P>
After him came Kar Komak and the Dusarian warrior who
had been detailed to duty upon the Thuria.  Carthoris
walked close to the left side of the latter.  Now they came
to the dense shadow under the side of the Thuria.  It was
very dark there, so that they had to grope for the ladder.
<P>
Kar Komak preceded the Dusarian.  The latter reached
upward for the swinging rounds, and as he did so steel
fingers closed upon his windpipe and a steel blade pierced
the very centre of his heart.
<P>
Turjun, the panthan, was the last to clamber over the rail
of the Thuria, drawing the rope ladder in after him.
<P>
A moment later the flier was rising rapidly, headed for the north.
<P>
At the rail Kar Komak turned to speak to the warrior
who had been detailed to accompany him.  His eyes went
wide as they rested upon the face of the young man
whom he had met beside the granite cliffs that guard
mysterious Lothar.  How had he come in place of the Dusarian?
<P>
A quick sign, and Kar Komak turned once more to find
the Thuria's dwar that he might report himself for duty.
Behind him followed the panthan.
<P>
Carthoris blessed the chance that had caused Vas Kor
to choose the bowman of all others, for had it been
another Dusarian there would have been questions
to answer as to the whereabouts of the warrior who lay
so quietly in the field beyond the residence of Hal Vas,
Dwar of the Southern Road; and Carthoris had no answer to
that question other than his sword point, which alone was
scarce adequate to convince the entire crew of the Thuria.
<P>
The journey to Dusar seemed interminable to the
impatient Carthoris, though as a matter of fact it was
quickly accomplished.  Some time before they reached
their destination they met and spoke with another Dusarian
war flier.  From it they learned that a great battle was
soon to be fought south-east of Dusar.
<P>
The combined navies of Dusar, Ptarth and Kaol had
been intercepted in their advance toward Helium by the
mighty Heliumitic navy--the most formidable upon Barsoom,
not alone in numbers and armament, but in the training
and courage of its officers and warriors, and the
zitidaric proportions of many of its monster battleships.
<P>
Not for many a day had there been the promise
of such a battle.  Four jeddaks were in direct command
of their own fleets--Kulan Tith of Kaol, Thuvan Dihn of
Ptarth, and Nutus of Dusar upon one side; while upon
the other was Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium.  With the
latter was John Carter, Warlord of Mars.
<P>
From the far north another force was moving south
across the barrier cliffs--the new navy of Talu, Jeddak of
Okar, coming in response to the call from the warlord.
Upon the decks of the sullen ships of war black-bearded
yellow men looked over eagerly toward the south.  Gorgeous
were they in their splendid cloaks of orluk and apt. 
Fierce, formidable fighters from the hothouse cities
of the frozen north.
<P>
And from the distant south, from the sea of Omean and
the cliffs of gold, from the temples of the therns and
the garden of Issus, other thousands sailed into the
north at the call of the great man they all had learned to
respect, and, respecting, love.  Pacing the flagship of this
mighty fleet, second only to the navy of Helium, was the
ebon godar, Jeddak of the First Born, his heart beating
strong in anticipation of the coming moment when he
should hurl his savage crews and the weight of his mighty
ships upon the enemies of the warlord.
<P>
But would these allies reach the theatre of war in time
to be of avail to Helium?  Or, would Helium need them?
<P>
Carthoris, with the other members of the crew of the
Thuria, heard the gossip and the rumours.  None knew
of the two fleets, the one from the south and the other
from the north, that were coming to support the ships of
Helium, and all of Dusar were convinced that nothing
now could save the ancient power of Helium from being
wiped for ever from the upper air of Barsoom.
<P>
Carthoris, too, loyal son of Helium that he was, felt that
even his beloved navy might not be able to cope successfully
with the combined forces of three great powers.
<P>
Now the Thuria touched the landing-stage above the
palace of Astok.  Hurriedly the prince and Vas Kor
disembarked and entered the drop that would carry
them to the lower levels of the palace.
<P>
Close beside it was another drop that was utilized by
common warriors.  Carthoris touched Kar Komak upon the arm.
<P>
"Come!" he whispered.  "You are my only friend
among a nation of enemies.  Will you stand by me?"
<P>
"To the death," replied Kar Komak.
<P>
The two approached the drop.  A slave operated it.
<P>
"Where are your passes?" he asked.
<P>
Carthoris fumbled in his pocket pouch as though in
search of them, at the same time entering the cage.
Kar Komak followed him, closing the door.  The slave
did not start the cage downward.  Every second counted.
They must reach the lower level as soon as possible after
Astok and Vas Kor if they would know whither the two went.
<P>
Carthoris turned suddenly upon the slave,
hurling him to the opposite side of the cage.
<P>
"Bind and gag him, Kar Komak!" he cried.
<P>
Then he grasped the control lever, and as the cage
shot downward at sickening speed, the bowman grappled
with the slave.  Carthoris could not leave the control to
assist his companion, for should they touch the lowest
level at the speed at which they were going, all would be
dashed to instant death.
<P>
Below him he could now see the top of Astok's cage
in the parallel shaft, and he reduced the speed of
his to that of the other.  The slave commenced to scream.
<P>
"Silence him!" cried Carthoris.
<P>
A moment later a limp form crumpled to the floor of the cage.
<P>
"He is silenced," said Kar Komak.
<P>
Carthoris brought the cage to a sudden stop at one
of the higher levels of the palace.  Opening the door, he
grasped the still form of the slave and pushed it out
upon the floor.  Then he banged the gate and resumed the
downward drop.
<P>
Once more he sighted the top of the cage that held
Astok and Vas Kor.  An instant later it had stopped,
and as he brought his car to a halt, he saw the two men
disappear through one of the exits of the corridor beyond.
