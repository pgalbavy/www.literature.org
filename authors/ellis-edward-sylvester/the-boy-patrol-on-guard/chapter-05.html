<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Every day sailors, explorers, mechanics and mountain-climbers
risk their lives on the knots that they tie. Thousands of lives
have been sacrificed to ill-made knots. The scout therefore should
be prepared in an emergency, or when necessity demands, to tie
the right knot in the right way.</p>

<p>There are three qualities to a good knot: (1) Rapidity with which
it can be tied; (2) Its ability to hold fast when pulled tight,
and (3) The readiness with which it can be undone.</p>

<p>The following knots, recommended to scouts, are the most serviceable
because they meet the above requirements and will be of great
help in scoutcraft. If the tenderfoot will follow closely the
various steps indicated in the diagrams, he will have little difficulty
in reproducing them at pleasure.</p>

<p>In practising knot-tying, a short piece of hemp rope may be used.
To protect the ends from fraying, a scout should know how to "whip"
them. The commonest method of "whipping" is as follows:</p>

<p>Lay the end of a piece of twine along the end of the rope. Hold
it to the rope with the thumb of your left hand while you wind
the standing part around it and the rope until the end of the
twine has been covered. Then with the other end of the twine lay
a loop back on the end of the rope and continue winding the twine
upon this second end until all is taken up. The end is then pulled
back tight and cut off close to the rope.</p>

<p>For the sake of clearness, a scout must constantly keep in mind
these three principal parts of the rope:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
1. <em>The Standing Part</em>—The long unused portion of the rope on<br/>
which he works;

</p>
<p>
2. <em>The Bight</em>—The loop formed whenever the rope is turned back<br/>
upon itself; and,

</p>
<p>
3. <em>The End</em>—The part he uses in leading.

</p>
</div>
<p>Before proceeding with the tenderfoot requirements, a scout should
first learn the two primary knots: the overhand and figure-of-eight
knots.</p>

<p>After these preliminary steps, the prospective tenderfoot may
proceed to learn the required knots.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>The Overhand Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Start with the position shown in the preceding diagram. Back the<br/>
end around the standing part and up through the bight and draw<br/>
tight.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>The Figure of Eight Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Make a bight as before. Then lead the end around back of the<br/>
standing part and down through the bight.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Square or Reef Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The commonest knot for tying two ropes together. Frequently used<br/>
in first-aid bandaging. Never slips or jams; easy to untie.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>False Reef or Granny</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
If the ends are not crossed correctly when making the reef knot,<br/>
the false reef or granny is the result. This knot is always bad.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Sheet Bend or Weaver’s Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
This knot is used in bending the sheet to the clew of a sail and<br/>
in tying two rope-ends together.

</p>
<p>
Make a bight with one rope <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, then pass end <em>C</em> of other<br/>
rope up through and around the entire bight and bend it under<br/>
its own standing part.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>The Bowline</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
A noose that neither jams nor slips. Used in lowering a person<br/>
from a burning building, etc.

</p>
<p>
Form a small loop on the standing part leaving the end long<br/>
enough for the size of the noose required. Pass the end up<br/>
through the bight around the standing part and down through the<br/>
bight again. To tighten, hold noose in position and pull<br/>
standing part.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Halter, Slip, or Running Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
A bight is first formed and an overhand knot made with the end<br/>
around the standing part.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Sheepshank</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used for shortening ropes. Gather up the amount to be shortened,<br/>
then make a half hitch round each of the bends as shown in the<br/>
diagram.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Clove Hitch</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used to fasten one pole to another in fitting up scaffolding;<br/>
this knot holds snugly; is not liable to slip laterally.

</p>
<p>
Hold the standing part in left hand, then pass the rope around<br/>
the pole; cross the standing part, making a second turn around<br/>
the pole, and pass the end under the last turn.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>The Fisherman’s Bend</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used aboard yachts for bending on the gaff topsail halliards. It<br/>
consists of two turns around a spar or ring, then a half hitch<br/>
around the standing part and through the turns on the spar, and<br/>
another half hitch above it around the standing part.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Timber Hitch</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used in hauling timber. Pass the end of the rope around the<br/>
timber. Then lead it around its standing part and bring it back<br/>
to make two or more turns on its own part. The strain will hold<br/>
it securely.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Two Half Hitches</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Useful because they are easily made and will not slip under any<br/>
strain. Their formation is sufficiently indicated by the<br/>
diagram.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Blackwall Hitch</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used to secure a rope to a hook, standing part when hauled tight<br/>
holds the end firmly.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Becket Hitch</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
For joining a cord to a rope. May be easily made from diagram.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>The Fisherman’s Knot</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used for tying silk-worm gut for fishing purposes. It never<br/>
slips; is easily unloosed by pulling the two short ends.

</p>
<p>
The two ropes are laid alongside one another, then with each end<br/>
an overhand knot is made around the standing part of the other.<br/>
Pull the standing parts to tighten.

</p>
</div>
<p>[Illustration: <em>Carrick Bend</em>]</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Used in uniting hawsers for towing. Is easily untied by pushing<br/>
the loops inwards.

</p>
<p>
Turn the end of one rope <em>A</em> over its standing part <em>B</em> to form<br/>
a loop. Pass the end of the other rope across the bight thus<br/>
formed, back of the standing part <em>B</em> over the end <em>A</em>, then<br/>
under the bight at <em>C</em>, passing it over its own standing part<br/>
and under the bight again at <em>D</em>.<br/>
