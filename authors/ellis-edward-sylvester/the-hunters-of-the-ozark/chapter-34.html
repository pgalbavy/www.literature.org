<p>It certainly was remarkable that when Fred Linden was watching
the three Winnebagos so closely, and when, as I have said, he
noticed more than one trifling matter, that he failed to recognize
the animals they were riding. All three were familiar to him,
and the one he had spoken of as being darker in color than the
others, and as having a star in his forehead, was the identical
animal owned by his father. Fred, himself, had ridden him more
than once.</p>

<p>It should be said, however, that they were the pack-horses, which
even when put to their best paces, could not make good speed.
Nevertheless, they were of great value to the hunters.</p>

<p>The first conviction of the lad on awaking to the alarming fact,
was that his father and the other two men had been killed by the
Winnebagos. The thought overcame him so that he leaned against
the nearest tree and was on the point of fainting.</p>

<p>"They are all dead, Terry &mdash;I know it&mdash;we may as well give
up, and try to reach home."</p>

<p>Terry was agitated, but not so much so as his friend.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear boy, it's not so bad as <em>that</em>," he said
feelingly; "do ye not moind that whin the gintlemen go to trappin'
and huntin' they turn the horses loose to graze? The spalpeens
have coom along and run off with the same."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Fred, looking up yearningly for the
grain of comfort that his companion was able to give.</p>

<p>"I don't <em>think</em> so; I know so; if the gintlemen took
the bastes into the cabin and slipt with the same ivery night,
as me rilatives do with their pigs in Ireland, why ye might think
that they had suffered before the Winnebagos tuk thim away; but
they have snaaked up where the animals was grazin', jumped onto
their backs and rid off."</p>

<p>This view of the case was so reasonable, that Fred rallied and
half smiled at his own faintheartedness. He stood erect and drew
a deep breath of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, but it strikes me that such thieves
would have stolen all instead of half the horses."</p>

<p>"They've lift the ither three for their frinds that I make no
doubt will be along to take thim, if they haven't done so now."</p>

<p>"You know that the loss of a horse is considered almost as bad
as the loss of a man in this part of the world."</p>

<p>"Sometimes he amounts to a good deal more, as me mither&mdash;"</p>

<p>Terry paused in his remarks, for just then Fred uttered a warning&mdash;"<em>Sh!</em>"
to signify that something was in the path in front. The next moment,
he ran several paces to the right and sheltered himself behind
a tree, Terry being only a few seconds behind him.</p>

<p>Both had discovered what it was. A brown bear of moderate size
was waddling along toward them. He had probably struck the trail,
and finding it easier walking than among the trees and undergrowth,
was swinging forward in the direction of the stream that had received
such a visit from the cyclone.</p>

<p>The boys could not know for a minute or two whether the beast
had seen them, but they felt no alarm. As I have said, he was
not very large nor formidable looking, and, if he chose to turn
aside to attack them, they were more than his equal. As it was,
their own eagerness to get forward was all that prevented them
from shooting him.</p>

<p>Bruin lumbered ahead in his awkward way, and, as the boys peeped
forth, they fancied that his big brown eyes glanced mischievously
at them; but they were mistaken. He did not see nor scent them,
but went by, and, in a few minutes, disappeared from sight among
the trees.</p>

<p>Hardly waiting till he had vanished, the youths stepped back
into the path and resumed the rapid pace at which they had been
traveling. The sun, that had been partly shining from behind the
clouds, was low in the sky, and it was not long before they were
journeying in the twilight. The moon rose early, but its light
was so much obscured by the mists that it gave little if any help,
and the friends were disappointed to find it difficult to make
any progress at all.</p>

<p>At this trying juncture, they found themselves once more on the
bank of a stream that had to be crossed before they could go any
further. It was fully double the width of the one last passed,
but did not look as if it was deep.</p>

<p>"My clothes ain't all dry yit," said Terry, "and I'm in favor
of wadin' if we can."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it is too deep for that, and with our guns and bundles
and thick clothes it isn't an easy thing to swim. Besides it's
colder than it was last night and it won't be pleasant to spend
a few more hours in wet clothing: mine is about dry."</p>

<p>Fred added that if they should decide to push on, the only way
of doing so was by the usual means of a raft. It would take considerable
time to build one, and probably still longer to work their way
to the other side.</p>

<p>"No use of waitin'," said Terry; "let's take hold; I've an idaa
that we ain't far from the cabin and ivery mile that we can make
now counts."</p>

<p>Fred started to give his help, when to his unbounded amazement,
he narrowly missed going headlong over a small Indian canoe that
lay at their feet. They would not have been more surprised had
they come upon Deerfoot himself in a sound slumber, and not until
they had stooped down and examined it closely were they certain
that it was not some log fantastically shaped by nature that had
floated thither.</p>

<p>But an Indian canoe it was beyond all mistake, though after searching
all around it, they failed to find the paddle so necessary for
its propulsion. The boat had been drawn up the bank, underneath
some bushes and undergrowth, where it would not have been seen
by any one further off than six feet. It was so far back too from
the stream that it would require an unusual overflow to carry
it away.</p>

<p>It was not so dark that the lads could not see that it was of
beautiful pattern and fine make&mdash;one of those delicate vessels
which under the skillful guidance of its owner skim like a swallow
over the water. It was a prize indeed.</p>

<p>Now, as you very well know, there is nothing wonderful about
an Indian canoe, but the astonishment of the boys came from the
fact that they found it in this place. Fred Linden, in listening
to the accounts given by his father on his return in the spring
from his trapping expeditions, had heard him say more than once
that there was no Indian village between Greville and the camp
at the foot of the Ozarks, and that, according to the friendly
red men who occasionally visited them, he believed that the nearest
lodge lay nearly two hundred miles to the north-west of Greville.
It was this fact that gave the Hunters of the Ozark so much confidence
in themselves when they went on their long hunts, though, as you
have learned, danger did sometimes come from the wandering Indians,
the father of Terry Clark having lost his life at their hands.</p>

<p>All this being known to the boys, they had cause to wonder how
it was that an Indian canoe lay hidden under the bushes on the
shore. None of those people would go to the trouble of making
such a boat, unless he expected to use it many times. It would
be the same as if you had a costly rowboat constructed with which
to cross only once a canal or small stream of water.</p>

<p>But, as in many other cases, it was idle to speculate, and the
boys did not allow any feeling of surprise to rob them of the
valuable minutes. Finding no paddle with which to manage the boat,
Fred cut a small sapling and trimmed it so that he had a pole
fully twenty feet long. Then the guns were laid in the bottom,
Terry took his seat, and they carefully pushed from shore, Fred
managing the pole.</p>

<p>As they suspected, the water was quite shallow, the depth nowhere
being more than three or four feet; but the current was rapid,
and in some places the bottom of the canoe grated over the gravel.
Both had to move well to the stern to raise the bow, so as to
allow them to reach land with dry feet.</p>

<p>"It's a pity to allow this to float off and be lost," said Fred;
"let's draw it up the bank where the owner won't have any trouble
in finding it."</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal if I could be introduced to that same
gintleman," remarked Terry, who took off his cap and scratched
his head as he added:</p>

<p>"I wonder whither that is one of the canoes from near home?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? How could it get <em>here</em>?"</p>

<p>"By some subterranean communication, the same as we boys used
to sind notes to the gurls whin I was laarnin' the higher mathematics
in college."</p>

<p>Fred made no comment upon the remark of his friend. The canoe,
when relieved of their weight, was so light that the bow was pulled
to the shore by means of the pole. Then Fred alone drew it up
beyond the reach of the water, and it was left until the owner
should come forward to claim it.</p>

<p>The two now set out to hunt for the trail, with a view of making
eight or ten miles more before they stopped to rest; but the result
was discouraging. It took more than a half hour to make sure they
had found it, and then they had not gone twenty yards, when Fred
said he could not tell whether he was in the path or not.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he added; "we may as well stop, for we are sure
to repeat the mistake of to-day: we'll get so far wrong that it'll
take many hours to find our way back again, and we shall lose
far more than we gain."</p>

<p>"That bein' the same&mdash;and I'm willin' to agraa that ye are now
strivin' to till the truth&mdash;let's turn off from the trail, go
back so far that there isn't any chance for any one to saa us
and slaap till mornin'."</p>

<p>Since there was nothing else to do, the boys did as Terry proposed.
They were not so tired as they were the night before, and they
did not dare to lie down on the leaves and sleep as they did then.
There were wild animals prowling through the woods, and the fact
that the lads escaped once could be no guaranty that they would
have equally good fortune a second time.</p>

<p>Terry proposed that they should climb a tree and make a bed among
the branches; but that was hardly feasible. It is not often that
the limbs of a tree are accommodating enough to allow any one
to rest with comfort. The branches may be pleasant for a time,
but the limbs soon become like iron rods and the position so cramped
as to drive away all comfort. In addition, there was the danger
of a fatal fall during sleep.</p>

<p>So it was decided to hunt out the most secluded place possible
and start a fire. That would keep off the wild animals, and the
boys were not in such need of sleep that they could not afford
to take turns with each other in watching through the night.</p>

<p>While hunting a suitable spot, they moved down the river bank
for fully a hundred yards, and then entered some dense undergrowth
which they penetrated until they were sure that no safer place
could be found. So they began gathering twigs, leaves and branches,
and piling them against the shaggy bark of a tree, and soon had
all they wanted. This was fired by means of the flint and steel,
and a roaring, crackling blaze made every thing look cheerful.</p>

<p>"Let's walk off a little ways," said Fred, "and see whether the
light can be noticed very far; you know that we can not be too
careful."</p>

<p>Terry liked the proposal, and rose to act upon it. They moved
in opposite directions, walking several rods, and then carefully
passing entirely around the camp-fire. The result was satisfactory,
for the undergrowth in all directions was so thick that they felt
as secure from discovery as if the fire had been kindled within
an impenetrable cave.</p>

<p>And yet they were woefully mistaken, as they were destined to
learn in a brief while.</p>
