<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One evening Carlos, after a silence of distress, had said, "There's
nothing else for it. When the crisis comes, you must carry her
off from this unhappiness and misery that hangs over her head.
You must take her out of Cuba; there is no safety for her here."</p>

<p>This took my breath away. "But where are we to go, Carlos?" I
asked, bending over him.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;to England," he whispered.</p>

<p>He was utterly worn out that evening by all the perplexities
of his death-bed. He made a great effort and murmured a few words
more&mdash;about the Spanish ambassador in London being a near relation
of the Riegos; then he gave it up and lay still under my amazed
eyes. The nun was approaching, alarmed, from the shadows. Father
Antonio, gazing sadly upon his beloved penitent, signed me to
withdraw.</p>

<p>Castro had not gone away yet; he greeted me in low tones outside
the big door.</p>

<p>"Señor," he went on, "I make my report usually to his Señoria
Don Carlos; only I have not been admitted to-day into his rooms
at all. But what I have to say is for your ear, also. There has
arrived a friar from a Havana convent amongst the <em>Lugarenos</em>
of the bay. I have known him come like this before."</p>

<p>I remembered that in the morning, while dressing, I had glanced
out of the narrow outside window of my room, and had seen a brown,
mounted figure passing on the sands. Its sandalled feet dangled
against the flanks of a powerful mule.</p>

<p>Castro shook his head. "Malediction on his green eyes! He baptizes
the offspring of this vermin sometimes, and sits for hours in
the shade before the door of Domingo's posada telling his beads
as piously as a devil that had turned monk for the greater undoing
of us Christians. These women crowd there to kiss his oily paw.
What else they<hr><em>Basta!</em> Only I wanted to tell you,
Señor, that this evening (I just come from taking a <em>pasear</em>
that way) there is much talk in the villages of an evil-intentioned
heretic that has introduced himself into this our town; of an
<em>Inglez</em> hungry for men to hang&mdash;of you, in short."</p>

<p>The moon, far advanced in its first quarter, threw an ashen,
bluish light upon one-half of the courtyard; and the straight
shadow upon the other seemed to lie at the foot of the columns,
black as a broad stroke of Indian ink.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it, Castro?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think that Domingo has his orders. Manuel has made a song
already. And do you know its burden, Señor? Killing is its burden.
I would the devil had all these <em>Improvisadores</em>. They
gape round him while he twangs and screeches, the wind-bag! And
he knows what words to sing to them, too. He has talent. <em>Maladetta!</em>"</p>

<p>"Well, and what do you advise?"</p>

<p>"I advise the senor to keep, now, within the Casa. No songs can
give that vermin the audacity to seek the senor here. The gate
remains barred; the firearms are always loaded; and Cesar is a
sagacious African. But methinks this moon would fall out of the
heaven first before they would dare.... Keep to the Casa, I say
&mdash;I, Tomas Castro."</p>

<p>He flung the corner of his cloak over his left shoulder, and
preceded me to the door of my room; then, after a "God guard you,
Señor," continued along the colonnade. Before I had shut my door
it occurred to me that he was going on towards the part of the
gallery on which Seraphina's apartments opened. Why? What could
he want there?</p>

<p>I am not so much ashamed of my sudden suspicion of him&mdash;one did
not know whom to trust&mdash;but I am a little ashamed to confess that,
kicking off my shoes, I crept out instantly to spy upon him.</p>

<p>This part of the house was dark in the inky flood of shadow;
and before I had come to a recess in the wall, I heard the discreet
scratching of a finger-nail on a door. A streak of light darted
and disappeared, like a signal for the murmurs of two voices.</p>

<p>I recognized the woman's at once. It belonged to one of Seraphina's
maids, a pretty little quadroon&mdash;a favourite of hers&mdash;called La
Chica. She had slipped out, and her twitter-like whispering reached
me in the still solemnity of the quadrangle. She addressed Castro
as "His Worship"  at every second word, for the saturnine little
man, in his unbrushed cloak and battered hat, was immensely respected
by the household. Had he not been sent to Europe to fetch Don
Carlos? He was in the confidence of the masters&mdash;their humble
friend. The little tire-woman twittered of her mistress. The senorita
had been most anxious all day&mdash;ever since she had heard the friar
had come. Castro muttered:</p>

<p>"Tell the Excellency that her orders have been obeyed. The English
<em>caballero</em> has been warned. I have been sleepless in my
watchfulness over the guest of the house, as the senorita has
desired&mdash;for the honour of the Riegos. Let her set her mind at
ease."</p>

<p>The girl then whispered to him with great animation. Did not
his worship think that it was the senorita's heart which was not
at ease?</p>

<p>Then the quadrangle became dumb in its immobility, half sheen,
half night, with its arcades, the soothing plash of water, with
its expiring lights, in a suggestion of Castilian severity, enveloped
by the exotic softness of the air.</p>

<p>"What folly!" uttered Castro's sombre voice. "You women do not
mind how many corpses come into your imaginings of love. The mere
whisper of such a thing<hr>"</p>

<p>She murmured swiftly. He interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Thine eyes, La Chica&mdash;thine eyes see only the silliness of thine
own heart. Think of thine own lovers, <em>nina. Por Dios!</em>"&mdash;he
changed to a tone of severe appreciation&mdash;"thy foolish face looks
well by moonlight."</p>

<p>I believe he was chucking her gravely under the chin. I heard
her soft, gratified cooing in answer to the compliment; the streak
of light flashed on the polished shaft of a pillar; and Castro
went on, going round to the staircase, evidently so as not to
pass again before my open door.</p>

<p>I forgot to shut it. I did not stop until I was in the middle
of my room; and then I stood still for a long time in a self-forgetful
ecstasy, while the many wax candles of the high candelabrum burned
without a flicker in a rich cluster of flames, as if lighted to
throw the splendour of a celebration upon the pageant of my thoughts.</p>

<p>For the honour of the Riegos!</p>

<p>I came to myself. Well, it was sweet to be the object of her
anxiety and care, even on these terms&mdash;on any terms. And I felt
a sort of profound, inexpressible, grateful emotion, as though
no one, never, on no day, on no occasion, had taken thought of
me before.</p>

<p>I should not be able to sleep. I went to the window, and leaned
my forehead on the iron bar. There was no glass; the heavy shutter
was thrown open; and, under the faint crescent of the moon I saw
a small part of the beach, very white, the long streak of light
lying mistily on the bay, and two black shapes, cloaked, moving
and stopping all of a piece like pillars, their immensely long
shadows running away from their feet, with the points of the hats
touching the wall of the Casa Riego. Another, a shorter, thicker
shape, appeared, walking with dignity. It was Castro. The other
two had a movement of recoil, then took off their hats.</p>

<p>"<em>Buenas noches, caballeros</em>," his voice said, with grim
politeness. "You are out late."</p>

<p>"So is your worship. <em>Vaya, Señor, con Dios</em>. We are taking
the air."</p>

<p>They walked away, while Castro remained looking after them. But
I, from my elevation, noticed that they had suddenly crouched
behind some scrubby bushes growing on the edge of the sand. Then
Castro, too, passed out of my sight in the opposite direction,
muttering angrily.</p>

<p>I forgot them all. Everything on earth was still, and I seemed
to be looking through a casement out of an enchanted castle standing
in the dreamland of romance. I breathed out the name of Seraphina
into the moonlight in an increasing transport. "Seraphina! Seraphina!
Seraphina!"  The repeated beauty of the sound intoxicated me.
"Seraphina!" I cried aloud, and stopped, astounded at myself.
And the moonlight of romance seemed to whisper spitefully from
below:</p>

<p>"Death to the traitor! Vengeance for our brothers dead on the
English gallows!" "Come away, Manuel."</p>

<p>"No. I am an artist. It is necessary for my soul..."</p>

<p>"Be quiet!"</p>

<p>Their hissing ascended along the wall from under the window.
The two <em>Lugarenos</em> had stolen in unnoticed by me. There
was a stifled metallic ringing, as of a guitar carried under a
cloak.</p>

<p>"Vengeance on the heretic <em>Inglez!</em>"</p>

<p>"Come away! They may suddenly open the gate and fall upon us
with sticks."</p>

<p>"My gentle spirit is roused to the accomplishment of great things.
I feel in me a valiance, an inspiration. I am no vulgar seller
of <em>aguardiente</em>, like Domingo. I was born to be the <em>capataz</em>
of the <em>Lugarenos</em>."</p>

<p>"We shall be set upon and beaten, oh, thou Manuel. Come away!"</p>

<p>There were no footsteps, only a noiseless flitting of two shadows,
and a distant voice crying:</p>

<p>"Woe, woe, woe to the traitor!"</p>

<p>I had not needed Castro's warning to understand the meaning of
this. O'Brien was setting his power to work, only this Manuel's
restless vanity had taught me exactly how the thing was to be
done. The friar had been exciting the minds of this rabble against
me; awakening their suspicions, their hatred, their fears.</p>

<p>I remained at the casement, lost in rather sombre reflections.
I was now a prisoner within the walls of the Casa. After all,
it mattered little. I did not want to go away unless I could carry
off Seraphina with me. What a dream! What an impossible dream!
Alone, without friends, with no place to go to, without means
of going; without, by Heaven, the right of even as much as speaking
of it to her. Carlos &mdash;Carlos dreamed&mdash;a dream of his dying
hours. England was so far, the enemy so near; and &mdash;Providence
itself seemed to have forgotten me.</p>

<p>A sound of panting made me turn my head. Father Antonio was mopping
his brow in the doorway. Though a heavy man, he was noiseless
of foot. A wheezing would be heard along the dark galleries some
time before his black bulk approached you with a gliding motion.
He had the outward placidity of corpulent people, a natural artlessness
of demeanour which was amusing and attractive, and there was something
shrewd in his simplicity. Indeed, he must have displayed much
tact and shrewdness to have defeated all O'Brien's efforts to
oust him from his position of confessor to the household. What
had helped him to hold his ground was that, as he said to me once,
"I, too, my son, am a legacy of that truly pious and noble lady,
the wife of Don Riego. I was made her spiritual director soon
after her marriage, and I may say that she showed more discretion
in the choice of her confessor than in that of her man of affairs.
But what would you have? The best of us, except for Divine grace,
is liable to err; and, poor woman, let us hope that, in her blessed
state, she is spared the knowledge of the iniquities going on
here below in the Casa."</p>

<p>He used to talk to me in that strain, coming in almost every
evening on his way from the sick room. He, too, had his own perplexities,
which made him wipe his forehead repeatedly; afterwards he used
to spread his red bandanna handkerchief over his knees.</p>

<p>He sympathized with Carlos, his beloved penitent, with Seraphina,
his dear daughter, whom he had baptized and instructed in the
mysteries of "our holy religion," and he allowed himself often
to drop the remark that his "illustrious spiritual son," Don Balthasar,
after a stormy life of which men knew only too much, had attained
to a state of truly childlike and God-fearing innocence&mdash;a sign,
no doubt, of Heaven's forgiveness for those excesses. He ended,
always, by sighing heartily, to sit with his gaze on the floor.</p>

<p>That night he came in silently, and after shutting the door with
care, took his habitual seat, a broad wooden armchair.</p>

<p>"How did your reverence leave Don Carlos?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Very low," he said. "The disease is making terrible ravages,
and my ministrations&mdash;-&mdash;I ought to be used to the sight
of human misery, but<hr>" He raised his hands; a genuine emotion
overpowered him; then, uncovering his face to stare at me, "He
is lost, Don Juan," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I fear we are about to lose him, your reverence," I
said, surprised at this display. It seemed inconceivable that
he should have been in doubt up to this very moment.</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes painfully. I was forgetting the infinite might
of God. Still, nothing short of a miracle&mdash;-&mdash;But what had
we done to deserve miracles?</p>

<p>"Where is the ancient piety of our forefathers which made Spain
so great?" he apostrophized the empty air, a little wildly, as
if in distraction. "No, Don Juan; even I, a true servant of our
faith, am conscious of not having had enough grace for my humble
ministrations to poor sailors and soldiers&mdash;men naturally inclined
to sin, but simple. And now&mdash;there are two great nobles, the fortune
of a great house...."</p>

<p>I looked at him and wondered, for he was, in a manner, wringing
his hands, as if in immense distress.</p>

<p>"We are all thinking of that poor child&mdash;<em>mas que</em>, Don
Juan, imagine all that wealth devoted to the iniquitous purposes
of that man. Her happiness sacrificed."</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine this &mdash;I will not," I interrupted, so
violently that he hushed me with both hands uplifted.</p>

<p>"To these wild enterprises against your own country," he went
on vehemently, disregarding my exasperated and contemptuous laugh.
"And she herself, the <em>niña</em> I have baptized her; I have
instructed her; and a more noble disposition, more naturally inclined
to the virtues and proprieties of her sex&mdash;-&mdash;But, Don Juan,
she has pride, which doubtless is a gift of God, too, but it is
made a snare of by Satan, the roaring lion, the thief of souls.
And what if her feminine rashness&mdash;women are rash, my son," he
interjected with unction&mdash;"and her pride were to lead her into
&mdash;I am horrified at the thought&mdash;into an act of mortal sin
for which there is no repentance?"</p>

<p>"Enough!" I shouted at him.</p>

<p>"No repentance," he repeated, rising to his feet excitedly, and
I stood before him, my arms down my sides, with my fists clenched.</p>

<p>Why did the stupid priest come to talk like this to me, as if
I had not enough of my own unbearable thoughts?</p>

<p>He sat down and began to flourish his handkerchief. There was
depicted on his broad face&mdash;depicted simply and even touchingly&mdash;the
inward conflict of his benevolence and of his doubts.</p>

<p>"I observe your emotion, my son," he said. I must have been as
pale as death. And, after a pause, he meditated aloud, "And, after
all, you English are a reverent nation. You, a scion of the nobility,
have been brought up in deplorable rebellion against the authority
of God on this earth; but you are not a scoffer&mdash;not a scoffer.
I, a humble priest&mdash;-&mdash;But, after all, the Holy Father himself,
in his inspired wisdom&mdash;-&mdash;I have prayed to be enlightened...."</p>

<p>He spread the square of his damp handkerchief on his knees, and
bowed his head. I had regained command over myself, but I did
not understand in the least. I had passed from my exasperation
into a careworn fatigue of mind that was like utter darkness.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, looking up naively, "the business of us
priests is to save souls. It is a solemn time when death approaches.
The affairs of this world should be cast aside. And yet God surely
does not mean us to abandon the living to the mercy of the wicked."</p>

<p>A sadness came upon his face, his eyes; all the world seemed
asleep. He made an effort. "My son," he said with decision, "I
call you to follow me to the bedside of Don Carlos at this very
hour of night. I, a humble priest, the unworthy instrument of
God's grace, call upon you to bring him a peace which my ministrations
cannot give. His time is near."</p>

<p>I rose up, startled by his solemnity, by the hint of hidden significance
in these words.</p>

<p>"Is he dying now?" I cried.</p>

<p>"He ought to detach his thoughts from this earth; and if there
is no other way<hr>"</p>

<p>"What way? What am I expected to do?"</p>

<p>"My son, I had observed your emotion. We, the appointed confidants
of men's frailties, are quick to discern the signs of their innermost
feelings. Let me tell you that my cherished daughter in God, Señorita
Dona Seraphina Riego, is with Don Carlos, the virtual head of
the family, since his Excellency Don Balthasar is in a state of,
I may say, infantile innocence."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, father?" I faltered.</p>

<p>"She is waiting for you with him," he pronounced, looking up.
And as his solemnity seemed to have deprived me of my power to
move, he added, with his ordinary simplicity, "Why, my son, she
is, I may say, not wholly indifferent to your person."</p>

<p>I could not have dropped more suddenly into the chair had the
good <em>padre</em> discharged a pistol into my breast. He went
away; and when I leapt up, I saw a young man in black velvet and
white ruffles staring at me out of the large mirror set frameless
into the wall, like the apparition of a Spanish ghost with my
own English face.</p>

<p>When I ran out, the moon had sunk below the ridge of the roof;
the whole quadrangle of the Casa had turned black under the stars,
with only a yellow glimmer of light falling into the well of the
court from the lamp under the vaulted gateway. The form of the
priest had gone out of sight, and a far-away knocking, mingling
with my footfalls, seemed to be part of the tumult within my heart.
Below, a voice at the gate challenged, "Who goes there?" I ran
on. Two tiny flames burned before Carlos' door at the end of the
long vista, and two of Seraphina's maids shrank away from the
great mahogany panels at my approach. The candlesticks trembled
askew in their hands; the wax guttered down, and the taller of
the two girls, with an uncovered long neck, gazed at me out of
big sleepy eyes in a sort of dumb wonder. The teeth of the plump
little one &mdash;La Chica&mdash;rattled violently like castanets.
She moved aside with a hysterical little laugh, and glanced upwards
at me.</p>

<p>I stopped, as if I had intruded; of all the persons in the sick-room,
not one turned a head. The stillness of the lights, of things,
of the air, seemed to have passed into Seraphina's face. She stood
with a stiff carriage under the heavy hangings of the bed, looking
very Spanish and romantic in her short black skirt, a black lace
shawl enveloping her head, her shoulders, her arms, as low as
the waist. Her bare feet, thrust into high-heeled slippers, lent
to her presence an air of flight, as if she had run into that
room in distress or fear. Carlos, sitting up amongst the snowy
pillows of eider-down at his back, was not speaking to her. He
had done; and the flush on his cheek, the eager lustre of his
eyes, gave him an appearance of animation, almost of joy, a sort
of consuming, flame-like brilliance. They were waiting for me.
With all his eagerness and air of life, all he could do was to
lift his white hand an inch or two off the silk coverlet that
spread over his limbs smoothly, like a vast crimson pall. There
was something joyous and cruel in the shimmer of this piece of
colour, contrasted with the dead white of the linen, the duskiness
of the wasted face, the dark head with no visible body, symbolically
motionless. The confused shadows and the tarnished splendour of
emblazoned draperies, looped up high under the ceiling, fell in
heavy and unstirring folds right down to the polished floor, that
reflected the lights like a sheet of water, or rather like ice.</p>

<p>I felt it slippery under my feet. I, alone, had to move, in this
great chamber, with its festive patches of colour amongst the
funereal shadows, with the expectant, still figures of priest
and nun, servants of passionless eternity, as if immobilized and
made mute by hostile wonder before the perishable triumph of life
and love. And only the impatient tapping of the sick man's hand
on the stiff silk of the coverlet was heard.</p>

<p>It called to me. Seraphina's unstirring head was lighted strongly
by a two-branched sconce on the wall; and when I stood by her
side, not even the shadow of the eyelashes on her cheek trembled.
Carlos' lips moved; his voice was almost extinct; but for all
his emaciation, the profundity of his eyes, the sunken cheeks,
the hollow temples, he remained attractive, with the charm of
his gallant and romantic temper worn away to an almost unearthly
fineness.</p>

<p>He was going to have his desire because, on the threshold of
his spiritual inheritance, he refused, or was unable, to turn
his gaze away from this world. Father Antonio's business was to
save this soul; and with a sort of simple and sacerdotal shrewdness,
in which there was much love for his most noble penitent, he would
try to appease its trouble by a romantic satisfaction. His voice,
very grave and profound, addressed me:</p>

<p>"Approach, my son&mdash;nearer. We trust the natural feelings of pity
which are implanted in every human breast, the nobility of your
extraction, the honour of your <em>hidalguidad</em>, and that
inextinguishable courage which, as by the unwearied mercy of God,
distinguishes the sons of your fortunate and unhappy nation."
His bass voice, deepened in solemn utterance, vibrated huskily.
There was a rustic dignity in his uncouth form, in his broad face,
in the gesture of the raised hand. "You shall promise to respect
the dictates of our conscience, guided by the authority of our
faith; to defer to our scruples, and to the procedure of our Church
in matters which we believe touch the welfare of our souls....
You promise?"</p>

<p>He waited. Carlos' eyes burned darkly on my face. What were they
asking of me? This was nothing. Of course I would respect her
scruples&mdash;her scruples&mdash;if my heart should break. I felt her living
intensely by my side; she could be brought no nearer to me by
anything they could do, or I could promise. She had already all
the devotion of my love and youth, the unreasoning and potent
devotion, without a thought or hope of reward. I was almost ashamed
to pronounce the two words they expected. "I promise."</p>

<p>And suddenly the meaning pervading this scene, something that
was in my mind already, and that I had hardly dared to look at
till now, became clear to me in its awful futility against the
dangers, in all its remote consequences. It was a betrothal. The
priest &mdash;Carlos, too&mdash;must have known that it had no binding
power. To Carlos it was symbolic of his wishes. Father Antonio
was thinking of the papal dispensation. I was a heretic. What
if it were refused? But what was that risk to me, who had never
dared to hope? Moreover, they had brought her there, had persuaded
her; she had been influenced by her fears, impressed by Carlos.
What could she care for me? And I repeated:</p>

<p>"I promise. I promise, even at the cost of suffering and unhappiness,
never to demand anything from her against her conscience."</p>

<p>Carlos' voice sounded weak. "I answer for him, good father."
Then he seemed to wander in a whisper, which we two caught faintly,
"He resembles his sister, O Divine<hr>"</p>

<p>And on this ghostly sigh, on this breath, with the feeble click
of beads in the nun's hands, a silence fell upon the room, vast
as the stillness of a world of unknown faiths, loves, beliefs,
of silent illusions, of unexpressed passions and secret motives
that live in our unfathomable hearts.</p>

<p>Seraphina had given me a quick glance&mdash;the first glance&mdash;which
I had rather felt than seen. Carlos made an effort, and, raising
himself, put her hand in mine.</p>

<p>Father Antonio, trying to pronounce a short allocution, broke
down, naïve in his emotion, as he had been in his dignity. I could
at first catch only the words, "Beloved child &mdash;Holy Father&mdash;poor
priest...."  He had taken this upon himself; and he would attest
the purity of our intentions, the necessity of the case, the assent
of the head of the family, my excellent disposition. All the Englishmen
had excellent dispositions. He would, personally, go to the foot
of the Holy See&mdash;on his knees, if necessary. Meantime, a document&mdash;he
should at once prepare a justificative document. The archbishop,
it is true, did not like him on account of the calumnies of that
man O'Brien. But there was, beyond the seas, the supreme authority
of the Church, unerring and inaccessible to calumnies.</p>

<p>All that time Seraphina's hand was lying passive in my palm&mdash;warm,
soft, living; all the life, all the world, all the happiness,
the only desire&mdash;and I dared not close my grasp, afraid of the
vanity of my hopes, shrinking from the intense felicity in the
audacious act. Father Antonio &mdash;I must say the word&mdash;blubbered.
He was now only a tender-hearted, simple old man, nothing more.</p>

<p>"Before God now, Don Juan.... I am only a poor priest, but invested
with a sacred office, an enormous power. Tremble, Señor, it is
a young girl... I have loved her like my own; for, indeed, I have
in baptism given her the spiritual life. You owe her protection;
it is for that, before God, Señor<hr>"</p>

<p>It was as if Carlos had swooned; his eyes were closed, his face
like a carving. But gradually the suggestion of a tender and ironic
smile appeared on his lips. With a slow effort he raised his arm
and his eyelids, in an appeal of all his weariness for my ear.
I made a movement to stoop over him, and the floor, the great
bed, the whole room, seemed to heave and sway. I felt a slight,
a fleeting pressure of Seraphina's hand before it slipped out
of mine; I thought, in the beating rush of blood to my temples,
that I was going mad.</p>

<p>He had thrown his arm over my neck; there was the calming austerity
of death on his lips, that just touched my ear and departed, together
with the far-away sound of the words, losing themselves in the
remoteness of another world:</p>

<p>"Like an Englishman, Juan."</p>

<p>"On my honour, Carlos."</p>

<p>His arm, releasing my neck, fell stretched out on the coverlet.
Father Antonio had mastered his emotion; with the trail of undried
tears on his face, he had become a priest again, exalted above
the reach of his earthly sorrow by the august concern of his sacerdocy.</p>

<p>"Don Carlos, my son, is your mind at ease, now?"</p>

<p>Carlos closed his eyes slowly.</p>

<p>"Then turn all your thoughts to heaven." Father Antonio's bass
voice rose, aloud, with an extraordinary authority. "You have
done with the earth."</p>

<p>The arm of the nun touched the cords of the curtains» and the
massive folds shook and fell expanded, hiding from us the priest
and the penitent.</p>
