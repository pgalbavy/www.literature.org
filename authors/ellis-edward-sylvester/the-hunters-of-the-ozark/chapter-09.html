<p>Fred Linden and Terry Clark were alarmed when, on their way home,
they came to the creek across which they had paddled only a short
time before. It was then the comparatively shallow stream that
was scarcely an obstacle in their path; now it was a rushing torrent,
whose volume was increasing with great rapidity. The sinuosities
of the creek had caused it to gather in a large part of the rain
that had fallen some miles away, and its usual boundaries were
overflowed.</p>

<p>It was well that Fred had tied his canoe to the tree that was
quite a distance from the stream, for had he not done so it would
have been swept away like an egg shell. As it was, the water had
reached the base of the tree, while the boat was bobbing up and
down almost in a straight line with the course of the creek, as
though it was tugging to get loose.</p>

<p>"My gracious, Terry!" said Fred, "this is a little worse than
I expected; it is going to be hard work to get across."</p>

<p>"Ye are right for once," added the other, gravely shaking his
head; "them rapids are a little closer than I loike."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," added Fred, who was unwilling to admit that
he was afraid to try the task, "that I have gone over the creek
when it was just as high and rapid, and have crossed at this place,
too."</p>

<p>"Who swung the paddle?"</p>

<p>"Father did once and Mr. Bowlby at another time."</p>

<p>"Did ye iver manage the paddle yersilf when the creek got onto
one of its tears?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember that I have, but that has been only because
the need did not arise; I am not afraid to try it, even if you
are."</p>

<p>"Who said I was afraid?" demanded Terry; "I'm riddy to hop into
the boat and sway the paddle mesilf, and I'll do it, too."</p>

<p>He stepped into the water, which was up to his shoe tops, and
began drawing in the rawhide rope which held the frail boat from
breaking away. His companion laughed and said nothing until the
canoe was at their feet and drawn up on the land away from the
rushing current.</p>

<p>"Don't be quite so touchy, Terry; that boat belongs to me and
I can handle the paddle better than you; anyway I shall try to
take us to the other side, and all that you have to do is to keep
those limbs and trees from capsizing us."</p>

<p>The time occupied in pulling the boat to the spot had given the
Irish lad a chance to regain his usual good nature, and he made
no protest against the decision of his companion, though Terry
was no unskillful handler of the paddle himself.</p>

<p>The creek was probably over a hundred feet wide, and the roiled
current abounded with limbs and trees that swung up and down,
sometimes out of sight and then popping up again, as though they
were frolicking in the swift waters. It would require a strong
arm and a cool head to force the birchen craft through these obstacles
to the shore on the other side. It must be admitted, too, that
it was a piece of imprudence on the part of the lads, who would
have been wiser had they quietly waited where they were until
the overflow exhausted itself. A stream that rises so fast subsides
with the same quickness, and long before nightfall the creek would
shrink to proportions that would take away all peril to any one
in paddling across.</p>

<p>They would have been compelled to go a long distance up stream
before finding a place where the crossing was easier, and it would
have been almost impossible to drag the canoe thither. They would
have held fast to one end of the rope and allowed it to dance
through the rapids, so as to allow them to make the passage below,
where the great peril was removed, had they not known that the
chances were ten to one that it would be snatched from their grasp,
thus shutting them out altogether.</p>

<p>Looking up and across the sloping clearing, the cabins forming
the settlement of Greville could be seen at no great distance.
From several of the stone chimneys the smoke was curling lazily
upward, and now and then glimpses could be caught of persons moving
hither and thither, but no one appeared to be looking in the direction
of the creek, or if any one was doing so, he saw nothing of the
two boys standing on the further shore and debating with themselves
the best course to follow. At any rate no one would think they
were unable to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Both Fred and Terry knew that there was but one prudent plan
to follow; that was quietly to wait where they were until near
night, by which time all danger would be gone. But neither proposed
the course nor made mention of it. It is natural for youth to
be rash, and there was a semblance of timidity in such a shrinking
back that was repellent to American and Irish lad alike. And so
you will understand how it was that each showed an eagerness to
enter into the contest with the angry current.</p>

<p>You will see, too, how foolish they were, when I tell you that
during the few minutes they stood by the tree to which the rope
had been tied discussing the situation, they saw the proof that
the creek was subsiding. There was a perceptible lowering of the
surface, as was shown by the soiled line against the trunk of
the tree. Even Terry, when he looked down, observed that he was
not standing in quite as deep water as he was a few minutes before.
No danger, however, of his making mention of it.</p>

<p>It took but a minute or so to untie the long thong that was wrapped
about the limb, and then, as Fred was on the point of flinging
the coil into the bottom of the boat, the end of which was drawn
up on the bank, and to take up the paddle and push off, Terry,
with some excitement, caught his arm and said:</p>

<p>"Plase wait a minute, will ye?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'll not be gone long; howld the boat only for a twinkling."</p>

<p>He ran a dozen steps or so from shore to where was the stump
of a tree that had probably been splintered by a thunder-bolt,
and around which sprouted a number of bushes that were dense enough
to hide a large object within. Carefully parting these, Terry
laid down his rifle and the bell, and then as carefully smoothed
the undergrowth in place. Then he hurried back.</p>

<p>"There are plinty of lads about me own size," said he, "but there's
only one gun that belongs to me, and if the canoe should upsit
and both of us get drowned I want to be sure and save me gun."</p>

<p>Fred smiled at this Irish-like explanation, but he was glad that
Terry had left the gun on shore. It was safely hidden until he
should wish to get it again, while its presence in the canoe would
be the worst kind of encumbrance. The new owner was so charmed
with his prize that he would think more of saving that than of
saving the boat. It was clear that the task of Terry in fighting
off the rushing timber would be almost as difficult as that of
guiding it across the swift stream.</p>

<p>"In with you!" said Fred to Terry, who carefully seated himself
near the bow of the canoe and took up the long pole that lay in
the bottom and projected some distance over the end of the boat.
Fred Linden gave it a vigorous shove, landed in the stern, caught
up the paddle, and instantly began his struggle.</p>

<p>You will see the difficulty and danger of his task, and must
therefore join with me in condemning the lack of judgment showed
by both. They had to paddle more than a hundred feet across a
furious torrent in which were scores of uprooted trees, wrenched-off
limbs, and craggy stumps, all speeding downward with great swiftness
and force. The course of the boat being at right angles to these
objects, must bring it in collision with some of them, at the
great risk of overturning or shattering the canoe, that was not
calculated to withstand any such blows.</p>

<p>And yet, though the task was a hard one, there was little doubt
that the two lads could make their way across, provided they were
given enough time in which to do so; but there were the rapids,
so near that their roar was plainly heard. In case of an overturn
or accident, the two would be swept among them. It was the same,
on a smaller scale, as if a person should start to row across
Niagara River, just above the falls, where by vigorous work he
could make the passage, provided he did not drop a stroke on the
way. You will say that any one making such an attempt placed little
value on his own life.</p>

<p>Fred Linden used his paddle after the manner of an Indian&mdash;that
is, he dipped the broad end first on one side of the boat and
then on the other. The paddle was not widened at each end, as
is sometimes the case, the one who wields it using the sides alternately
and with great rapidity. In calm water such a light structure
as an Indian canoe can be driven with great speed, and I have
no doubt that the youths would have made a speedy passage had
it not been for the interference of the floating objects to which
I have referred.</p>

<p>Ten feet from land Fred was forced to back water suddenly to
avoid a jagged stump that danced in front like a bull getting
ready to charge, and finally did strike the bow with a thump that
startled both the occupants.</p>

<p>"Me pole slipped off the side of that," Terry explained, as he
brandished the stick in front on the lookout for the threatening
waste-wood; "have a care that ye don't drive the boat agin something
that is stronger than the boat itsilf."</p>

<p>By coolness, alertness and strength, Fred fought his way in safety
until probably one-third of the distance was passed. Then he saw
the great blunder he had made in trying to cross while the current
was so high. The constant fighting with the floating stumps and
trees caused them to lose so much ground&mdash;or rather water&mdash;that
they were drifting frightfully close to the rapids, whose roar
grew plainer every moment. But he had gone so far that it was
as safe to keep on as to turn back, and so he dipped the paddle
and swung it with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he called to Terry, who in parrying the rush of a
stump a couple of yards in advance, did not notice one that was
coming broadside on, its presence betrayed by a tiny branch that
protruded a few inches above the surface like the fin of a shark.
Fred did his utmost to avoid it, but he was too slow, and a second
later the pointed log not only struck the side of the canoe, but
capsized it.</p>
