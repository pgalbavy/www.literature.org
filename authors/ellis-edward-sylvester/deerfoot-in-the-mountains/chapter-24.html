<p>Our friends, after parting with the Lewis and Clark expedition,
pressed southward, in search of a milder climate and a more direct
route to their homes. They were traversing a region broken by
many streams, detached mountain spurs and ranges of lofty elevation.
Black Butte, as it is known to-day, in Dawson County, Montana,
was left on the left, after which they rode through the valley
of Little Porcupine Creek to the Yellowstone, which was crossed
with considerable difficulty. Turning more to the east, they passed
the rough, precipitous section, the scene many years afterward
of the appalling Custer massacre, and now an immense Indian reservation,
and, entering the present State of Wyoming, skirted the foothills
of the well-known Big Horn range. Here the scenery was of the
grandest character. Had the party not been accustomed for months
to such impressive exhibitions of the majesty of nature, they
could have spent weeks of enjoyment where the like is found in
few parts of the world. They pushed on, however, not making what
might be termed a real halt until they came to the Laramie Mountains,
almost the equal of the former in picturesque beauty.</p>

<p>By this time the unremitting hard work began to tell upon the
horses. Zigzag showed slight lameness, and Jack, the animal ridden
by George Shelton, surely needed rest. Only Whirlwind continued
as powerful, active and fresh as ever. Deerfoot and the boys always
walked a number of miles each day, not only for the sake of the
horses, but to gain the exercise each needed. Deerfoot ran races
with Whirlwind, who was inconsiderate enough to beat him every
time. Sometimes they frolicked like a couple of boys. The Shawanoe
delighted to tease the noble creature, who delighted to have him
do so. One habit of the youth was to pretend he was offended with
the stallion. He would turn his back upon him and repel his advances
toward a reconciliation. Whirlwind would poke his nose first over
one shoulder and then the other, rubbing it against the cheek
of Deerfoot. If the latter sulked too long, Whirlwind would show
his impatience by flirting his head against that of the youth,
whirling about, kicking up his heels and galloping off. No words
could have said more plainly:</p>

<p>"I don't care. Pout all you want to. I shan't coax you any more.
I haven't much opinion of you anyway."</p>

<p>And then Deerfoot had to make peace with his offended majesty.
But the stallion never held off long, and George and Victor laughed
at the antics of the couple.</p>

<p>The halt of which I have spoken was made one afternoon, near
the southern end of the Laramie range. No more favorable spot
could have been selected, for the grass was abundant and of the
best quality. A stream of considerable size issued from the mountains
and flowing northeast joined the North Platte, a hundred miles
away, and there was enough timber to yield all the fuel needed.
The horses were unsaddled and unbridled, the pack removed from
the back of Zigzag and the three owners were at liberty to do
whatever they chose to pass away the hours. It was so late that
they stayed in camp till morning, when it was decided to set off
on a hunt, Deerfoot going by himself, while the brothers, as usual,
kept company.</p>

<p>There had hardly been a day since parting from Lewis and Clark
that our friends had not seen Indians or signs of them. Sometimes
it was the smoke of their camp fires in the distance, and then
they caught sight of a band of horsemen, who might number three
or four or five times as many warriors. It was the rule of Deerfoot
to avoid coming in contact with these wanderers, so long as he
could do so without rousing their suspicion by his actions. While
in a general way the strangers could be counted upon as friendly,
they contained a ratio of lawless if not desperate characters,
who were liable to be tempted by the hope of plunder. Whirlwind
was quite sure to attract envious eyes. Moreover, the party was
now in a region which was visited, more or less, by trappers and
hunters in the employ of fur companies, or who operated independently.
The majority of these men were rough and reckless of the rights
of others. They had little faith in the Golden Rule where Indians
were concerned, and affrays between them and the native inhabitants
were numerous. Many a white man who went into the mountains never
came out again. He fell a victim to his own wrongdoing and received
the fate he had invited so long. Others succeeded in getting through
the lines with their pack animals laden with peltries, to St.
Louis, to return again the following autumn and to face and overcome,
or possibly fail to overcome, the perils they had met so often.</p>

<p>The sun was shining from a clear, balmy sky, for summer had come,
when Deerfoot swept every portion of the visible horizon with
the spyglass without detecting a sign of red men. To the westward
towered the immense Laramie range, while the plains stretched
eastward and were crossed by numerous streams, on whose banks
thriving towns and cities have been built in later days. Less
than a hundred miles to the southeast was the site of the present
city of Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Before reaching the scene of this encampment the travelers had
twice come within range of grizzly bears. The first was ignored,
but the second did not choose to be passed by in such cavalier
fashion. He first appeared close to camp, much to the terror of
the horses, and then deliberately proceeded to attack everything
in sight. He came within a hair, too, of killing Zigzag and Prince
before he was brought low by the bullets of all three, Deerfoot
burying two in the colossal carcass.</p>

<p>Black and cinnamon bears were observed, but no disturbance followed
on the part of men or brutes. Several times the wolves, coyotes
and pumas became so troublesome that a number were killed. Bison
were so plentiful that hardly a day passed without sight of them.
In some instances the droves contained tens of thousands.</p>

<p>George and Victor Shelton soon found themselves climbing among
the foothills. Deerfoot had gone in another direction, the agreement
being that they should return to camp soon after meridian, and
not to go far from headquarters. While none felt misgiving as
to danger, all had learned to be circumspect.</p>

<p>It may be said that the stroll of the boys was as much to gain
exercise as to hunt game, though the latter object was the one
avowed by them. In those days a person did not have to look far
for such sport, but it seemed as if the wild animals scented the
danger and kept out of the way. When noon came the tired boys
sat down beside a mountain torrent, without either having fired
his rifle.</p>

<p>"We haven't heard the report of Deerfoot's gun," said George,
"and I don't see that there is any use of hunting further."</p>

<p>"Nor do I. I'm hungry and we shan't be able to get anything to
eat this side of camp. It must be the game noticed that <em>I</em>
was with you, and they have all run to their holes."</p>

<p>"We have one consolation," remarked George, ignoring the last
sentence. "It will be easier getting back to camp, for it's down
hill all the way."</p>

<p>"But we shall have a good deal of climbing to do. I'm ready to
say I've gained enough exercise to last me till to-morrow. I think,"
added Victor, rising to his feet and looking at the noisy torrent
a few feet in front, "that we can shorten the distance by crossing
that."</p>

<p>"How are we going to do it? We're not likely to find it bridged."</p>

<p>"I'm sure we shall be able to leap across."</p>

<p>The two walked to the edge of the stream, which may be described
as a furious torrent, rushing between the rocks, which were separated
by a dozen feet, the upper margin being one or two feet above
the surface of the stream. Standing on the edge of the small cañon
and looking down, the boys saw that the water was of crystalline
clearness and was beaten in many places into froth and foam, which
sparkled with every color of the rainbow as it shot into the sunlight.
The course of the torrent was so tortuous and the turns so abrupt
that clouds of mist curled upward in places and caused the rocks
to drip with moisture. The roar was so loud that the brothers
had to shout to each other.</p>

<p>"We might make a running leap here," said George, "but it isn't
worth while to take the risk."</p>

<p>"There must be narrower portions. Let's look."</p>

<p>Turning to the left, they had to go only a little way when they
found a favorable place. The breadth was no more than seven or
eight feet. While they could not shorten the distance to camp
very much, the advantage was worth striving for.</p>

<p>"No risk in that," remarked Victor, looking at his brother, who
nodded his head to signify he agreed with him.</p>

<p>"I'll jump first," added Victor, walking back several paces to
gain the necessary start. He could have made the leap without
this preparation, but was using only ordinary prudence. George
stood to one side and close to the edge, so as to observe every
phase of the performance. Despite the apparent safety of the attempt,
a strange misgiving came over George, and he turned to his brother
to protest, when he saw he had started on his brief run. He carried
his rifle in his right hand, took a number of short steps, measuring
the distance with his eye, so that the take-off should be exact,
and covered the space in a second or two.</p>

<p>George was watching every movement of the supple limbs, when
he uttered an exclamation of horror. At the very moment Victor
was gathering his muscles for the leap, and when close to the
edge, the dripping stone caused his foot to slip. He fell sideways,
let go of his rifle, which shot over the edge, and desperately
struggled to check himself. Had there been five seconds at command
he would have been saved. George, who made the attempt, could
have dashed forward and grasped a foot or leg. Victor could have
stopped, but the rock on which he had fallen seemed to be covered
with plumbago. While frantically clutching and vainly trying to
grasp some obstruction that would overcome his momentum, he slid
over the edge and dropped into the boiling cauldron below. The
accident was begun and finished, as may be said, in the twinkling
of an eye.</p>

<p>Wild with affright, George ran to the edge of the torrent and
peered over. He caught a glimpse of his brother a dozen yards
away, spinning down the torrent. He saw his head for a moment,
and then his arms thrown upward, as he disappeared, blindly but
vainly struggling to save himself. In an instant he was whirled
round a bend in the cañon, his body flung aloft by the resistless
force of the torrent, but hurled hither and thither, as helpless
as a log of wood.</p>

<p>Frantic and hardly conscious of what he was doing, George dashed
along the edge of the cañon, which sped faster than he could run.
One moment he was on the point of leaping into the raging waters
in the blind effort to save Victor, but the certainty that that
would only add another victim held him in restraint, and he continued
running, stumbling and praying in agony for Heaven to intercede
while it was yet time.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a man standing on the other side of the cañon
some rods below, and staring wonderingly at him. George raised
his voice so that it pierced the uproar like the notes of a trumpet:</p>

<p>"Save him! Save him! He fell into the water!"</p>
