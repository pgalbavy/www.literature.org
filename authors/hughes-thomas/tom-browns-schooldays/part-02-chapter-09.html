"Strange friend, past, present, and to be;<br/>
Loved deeplier, darklier understood;<br/>
Behold I dream a dream of good,<br/>
And mingle all the world with thee."<br/>
&mdash;<em>TENNYSON</em>.

</div>
<p>In the summer of 1842, our hero stopped once again at the well-known
station; and leaving his bag and fishing-rod with a porter, walked
slowly and sadly up towards the town. It was now July. He had
rushed away from Oxford the moment that term was over, for a fishing
ramble in Scotland with two college friends, and had been for
three weeks living on oatcake, mutton-hams, and whisky, in the
wildest parts of Skye. They had descended one sultry evening on
the little inn at Kyle Rhea ferry; and while Tom and another of
the party put their tackle together and began exploring the stream
for a sea-trout for supper, the third strolled into the house
to arrange for their entertainment. Presently he came out in a
loose blouse and slippers, a short pipe in his mouth, and an old
newspaper in his hand, and threw himself on the heathery scrub
which met the shingle, within easy hail of the fishermen. There
he lay, the picture of free-and-easy, loafing, hand-to-mouth young
England, "improving his mind," as he shouted to them, by the perusal
of the fortnight-old weekly paper, soiled with the marks of toddy-glasses
and tobacco-ashes, the legacy of the last traveller, which he
had hunted out from the kitchen of the little hostelry, and, being
a youth of a communicative turn of mind, began imparting the contents
to the fishermen as he went on.</p>

<p>"What a bother they are making about these wretched corn-laws!
Here's three or four columns full of nothing but sliding scales
and fixed duties. Hang this tobacco, it's always going out! Ah,
here's something better&mdash;a splendid match between Kent and England,
Brown, Kent winning by three wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without
a chance, and not out!"</p>

<p>Tom, intent on a fish which had risen at him twice, answered
only with a grunt.</p>

<p>"Anything about the Goodwood?" called out the third man.</p>

<p>"Rory O'More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss," shouted the student.</p>

<p>"Just my luck," grumbled the inquirer, jerking his flies off
the water, and throwing again with a heavy, sullen splash, and
frightening Tom's fish.</p>

<p>"I say, can't you throw lighter over there? We ain't fishing
for grampuses," shouted Tom across the stream.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Brown! here's something for you," called out the reading
man next moment. "Why, your old master, Arnold of Rugby, is dead."</p>

<p>Tom's hand stopped half-way in his cast, and his line and flies
went all tangling round and round his rod; you might have knocked
him over with a feather. Neither of his companions took any notice
of him, luckily; and with a violent effort he set to work mechanically
to disentangle his line. He felt completely carried off his moral
and intellectual legs, as if he had lost his standing-point in
the invisible world. Besides which, the deep, loving loyalty which
he felt for his old leader made the shock intensely painful. It
was the first great wrench of his life, the first gap which the
angel Death had made in his circle, and he felt numbed, and beaten
down, and spiritless. Well, well! I believe it was good for him
and for many others in like case, who had to learn by that loss
that the soul of man cannot stand or lean upon any human prop,
however strong, and wise, and good; but that He upon whom alone
it can stand and lean will knock away all such props in His own
wise and merciful way, until there is no ground or stay left but
Himself, the Rock of Ages, upon whom alone a sure foundation for
every soul of man is laid.</p>

<p>As he wearily laboured at his line, the thought struck him, "It
may be all false&mdash;a mere newspaper lie." And he strode up to the
recumbent smoker.</p>

<p>"Let me look at the paper," said he.</p>

<p>"Nothing else in it," answered the other, handing it up to him
listlessly. "Hullo, Brown! what's the matter, old fellow? Ain't
you well?"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" said Tom, turning over the leaves, his hands trembling,
and his eyes swimming, so that he could not read.</p>

<p>"What? What are you looking for?" said his friend, jumping up
and looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;about Arnold," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, here," said the other, putting his finger on the paragraph.
Tom read it over and over again. There could be no mistake of
identity, though the account was short enough.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said he at last, dropping the paper. "I shall go
for a walk. Don't you and Herbert wait supper for me." And away
he strode, up over the moor at the back of the house, to be alone,
and master his grief if possible.</p>

<p>His friend looked after him, sympathizing and wondering, and,
knocking the ashes out of his pipe, walked over to Herbert. After
a short parley they walked together up to the house.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that confounded newspaper has spoiled Brown's fun
for this trip."</p>

<p>"How odd that he should be so fond of his old master," said Herbert.
Yet they also were both public-school men.</p>

<p>The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's prohibition, waited supper
for him, and had everything ready when he came back some half
an hour afterwards. But he could not join in their cheerful talk,
and the party was soon silent, notwithstanding the efforts of
all three. One thing only had Tom resolved, and that was, that
he couldn't stay in Scotland any longer: he felt an irresistible
longing to get to Rugby, and then home, and soon broke it to the
others, who had too much tact to oppose.</p>

<p>So by daylight the next morning he was marching through Ross-shire,
and in the evening hit the Caledonian Canal, took the next steamer,
and travelled as fast as boat and railway could carry him to the
Rugby station.</p>

<p>As he walked up to the town, he felt shy and afraid of being
seen, and took the back streets&mdash;why, he didn't know, but he followed
his instinct. At the School-gates he made a dead pause; there
was not a soul in the quadrangle&mdash;all was lonely, and silent,
and sad. So with another effort he strode through the quadrangle,
and into the School-house offices.</p>

<p>He found the little matron in her room in deep mourning; shook
her hand, tried to talk, and moved nervously about. She was evidently
thinking of the same subject as he, but he couldn't begin talking.</p>

<p>"Where shall I find Thomas?" said he at last, getting desperate.</p>

<p>"In the servants' hall, I think, sir. But won't you take anything?"
said the matron, looking rather disappointed.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said he, and strode off again to find the old
verger, who was sitting in his little den, as of old, puzzling
over hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>He looked up through his spectacles as Tom seized his hand and
wrung it.</p>

<p>"Ah! you've heard all about it, sir, I see," said he. Tom nodded,
and then sat down on the shoe-board, while the old man told his
tale, and wiped his spectacles, and fairly flowed over with quaint,
homely, honest sorrow.</p>

<p>By the time he had done Tom felt much better.</p>

<p>"Where is he buried, Thomas?" said he at last.</p>

<p>"Under the altar in the chapel, sir," answered Thomas. "You'd
like to have the key, I dare say?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Thomas&mdash;yes, I should, very much."</p>

<p>And the old man fumbled among his bunch, and then got up, as
though he would go with him; but after a few steps stopped short,
and said, "Perhaps you'd like to go by yourself, sir?"</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and the bunch of keys were handed to him, with an
injunction to be sure and lock the door after him, and bring them
back before eight o'clock.</p>

<p>He walked quickly through the quadrangle and out into the close.
The longing which had been upon him and driven him thus far, like
the gad-fly in the Greek legends, giving him no rest in mind or
body, seemed all of a sudden not to be satisfied, but to shrivel
up and pall. "Why should I go on? It's no use," he thought, and
threw himself at full length on the turf, and looked vaguely and
listlessly at all the well-known objects. There were a few of
the town boys playing cricket, their wicket pitched on the best
piece in the middle of the big-side ground&mdash;a sin about equal
to sacrilege in the eyes of a captain of the eleven. He was very
nearly getting up to go and send them off. "Pshaw! they won't
remember me. They've more right there than I," he muttered. And
the thought that his sceptre had departed, and his mark was wearing
out, came home to him for the first time, and bitterly enough.
He was lying on the very spot where the fights came off&mdash;where
he himself had fought six years ago his first and last battle.
He conjured up the scene till he could almost hear the shouts
of the ring, and East's whisper in his ear; and looking across
the close to the Doctor's private door, half expected to see it
open, and the tall figure in cap and gown come striding under
the elm-trees towards him.</p>

<p>No, no; that sight could never be seen again. There was no flag
flying on the round tower; the School-house windows were all shuttered
up; and when the flag went up again, and the shutters came down,
it would be to welcome a stranger. All that was left on earth
of him whom he had honoured was lying cold and still under the
chapel floor. He would go in and see the place once more, and
then leave it once for all. New men and new methods might do for
other people; let those who would, worship the rising star; he,
at least, would be faithful to the sun which had set. And so he
got up, and walked to the chapel door, and unlocked it, fancying
himself the only mourner in all the broad land, and feeding on
his own selfish sorrow.</p>

<p>He passed through the vestibule, and then paused for a moment
to glance over the empty benches. His heart was still proud and
high, and he walked up to the seat which he had last occupied
as a sixth-form boy, and sat himself down there to collect his
thoughts.</p>

<p>And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and setting in order
not a little. The memories of eight years were all dancing through
his brain, and carrying him about whither they would; while, beneath
them all, his heart was throbbing with the dull sense of a loss
that could never be made up to him. The rays of the evening sun
came solemnly through the painted windows above his head, and
fell in gorgeous colours on the opposite wall, and the perfect
stillness soothed his spirit by little and little. And he turned
to the pulpit, and looked at it, and then, leaning forward with
his head on his hands, groaned aloud. If he could only have seen
the Doctor again for one five minutes&mdash;have told him all that
was in his heart, what he owed to him, how he loved and reverenced
him, and would, by God's help, follow his steps in life and death&mdash;he
could have borne it all without a murmur. But that he should have
gone away for ever without knowing it all, was too much to bear.
"But am I sure that he does not know it all?" The thought made
him start. "May he not even now be near me, in this very chapel?
If he be, am I sorrowing as he would have me sorrow, as I should
wish to have sorrowed when I shall meet him again?"</p>

<p>He raised himself up and looked round, and after a minute rose
and walked humbly down to the lowest bench, and sat down on the
very seat which he had occupied on his first Sunday at Rugby.
And then the old memories rushed back again, but softened and
subdued, and soothing him as he let himself be carried away by
them. And he looked up at the great painted window above the altar,
and remembered how, when a little boy, he used to try not to look
through it at the elm-trees and the rooks, before the painted
glass came; and the subscription for the painted glass, and the
letter he wrote home for money to give to it. And there, down
below, was the very name of the boy who sat on his right hand
on that first day, scratched rudely in the oak panelling.</p>

<p>And then came the thought of all his old schoolfellows; and form
after form of boys nobler, and braver, and purer than he rose
up and seemed to rebuke him. Could he not think of them, and what
they had felt and were feeling&mdash;they who had honoured and loved
from the first the man whom he had taken years to know and love?
Could he not think of those yet dearer to him who was gone, who
bore his name and shared his blood, and were now without a husband
or a father? Then the grief which he began to share with others
became gentle and holy, and he rose up once more, and walked up
the steps to the altar, and while the tears flowed freely down
his cheeks, knelt down humbly and hopefully, to lay down there
his share of a burden which had proved itself too heavy for him
to bear in his own strength.</p>

<p>Here let us leave him. Where better could we leave him than at
the altar before which he had first caught a glimpse of the glory
of his birthright, and felt the drawing of the bond which links
all living souls together in one brotherhood&mdash;at the grave beneath
the altar of him who had opened his eyes to see that glory, and
softened his heart till it could feel that bond?</p>

<p>And let us not be hard on him, if at that moment his soul is
fuller of the tomb and him who lies there than of the altar and
Him of whom it speaks. Such stages have to be gone through, I
believe, by all young and brave souls, who must win their way
through hero-worship to the worship of Him who is the King and
Lord of heroes. For it is only through our mysterious human relationships&mdash;through
the love and tenderness and purity of mothers and sisters and
wives, through the strength and courage and wisdom of fathers
and brothers and teachers&mdash;that we can come to the knowledge of
Him in whom alone the love, and the tenderness, and the purity,
and the strength, and the courage, and the wisdom of all these
dwell for ever and ever in perfect fullness.</p>
