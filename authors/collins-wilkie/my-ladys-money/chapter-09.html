<P>
THE next day, Mr. Troy (taking Robert Moody with him as a
valuable witness) rang the bell at the mean and dirty
lodging-house in which Old Sharon received the clients who stood
in need of his advice.
<P>
They were led up stairs to a back room on the second floor of the
house. Entering the room, they discovered through a thick cloud
of tobacco smoke, a small, fat, bald-headed, dirty, old man, in
an arm-chair, robed in a tattered flannel dressing-gown, with a
short pipe in his mouth, a pug-dog on his lap, and a French novel
in his hands.
<P>
"Is it business?" asked Old Sharon, speaking in a hoarse,
asthmatical voice, and fixing a pair of bright, shameless, black
eyes attentively on the two visitors.
<P>
"It _is_ business," Mr. Troy answered, looking at the old rogue
who had disgraced an honorable profession, as he might have
looked at a reptile which had just risen rampant at his feet.
"What is your fee for a consultation?"
<P>
"You give me a guinea, and I'll give you half an hour." With this
reply Old Sharon held out his unwashed hand across the rickety
ink-splashed table at which he was sitting.
<P>
Mr. Troy would not have touched him with the tips of his own
fingers for a thousand pounds. He laid the guinea on the table.
<P>
Old Sharon burst into a fierce laugh--a laugh strangely
accompanied by a frowning contraction of his eyebrows, and a
frightful exhibition of the whole inside of his mouth. "I'm not
clean enough for you--eh?" he said, with an appearance of being
very much amused. "There's a dirty old man described in this book
that is a little like me." He held up his French novel. "Have you
read it? A capital story--well put together. Ah, you haven't read
it? You have got a pleasure to come. I say, do you mind
tobacco-smoke? I think faster while I smoke--that's all."
<P>
Mr. Troy's respectable hand waved a silent permission to smoke,
given under dignified protest.
<P>
"All right," said Old Sharon. "Now, get on."
<P>
He laid himself back in his chair, and puffed out his smoke, with
eyes lazily half closed, like the eyes of the pug-dog on his lap.
At that moment, indeed there was a curious resemblance between
the two. They both seemed to be preparing themselves, in the same
idle way, for the same comfortable nap.
<P>
Mr. Troy stated the circumstances under which the five hundred
pound note had disappeared, in clear and consecutive narrative.
When he had done, Old Sharon suddenly opened his eyes. The
pug-dog suddenly opened his eyes. Old Sharon looked hard at Mr.
Troy. The pug looked hard at Mr. Troy. Old Sharon spoke. The pug
growled.
<P>
"I know who you are--you're a lawyer. Don't be alarmed! I never
saw you before; and I don't know your name. What I do know is a
lawyer's statement of facts when I hear it. Who's this?" Old
Sharon looked inquisitively at Moody as he put the question.
<P>
Mr. Troy introduced Moody as a competent witness, thoroughly
acquainted with the circumstances, and ready and willing to
answer any questions relating to them. Old Sharon waited a
little, smoking hard and thinking hard. "Now, then!" he burst out
in his fiercely sudden way. "I'm going to get to the root of the
matter."
<P>
He leaned forward with his elbows on the table, and began his
examination of Moody. Heartily as Mr. Troy despised and disliked
the old rogue, he listened with astonishment and
admiration--literally extorted from him by the marvelous ability
with which the questions were adapted to the end in view. In a
quarter of an hour Old Sharon had extracted from the witness
everything, literally everything down to the smallest detail,
that Moody could tell him. Having now, in his own phrase, "got to
the root of the matter," he relighted his pipe with a grunt of
satisfaction, and laid himself back in his old armchair.
<P>
"Well?" said Mr. Troy. "Have you formed your opinion?"
<P>
"Yes; I've formed my opinion."
<P>
"What is it?"
<P>
Instead of replying, Old Sharon winked confidentially at Mr.
Troy, and put a question on his side.
<P>
"I say! is a ten-pound note much of an object to you?"
<P>
"It depends on what the money is wanted for," answered Mr. Troy.
<P>
"Look here," said Old Sharon; "I give you an opinion for your
guinea; but, mind this, it's an opinion founded on hearsay--and
you know as a lawyer what that is worth. Venture your ten
pounds--in plain English, pay me for my time and trouble in a
baffling and difficult case--and I'll give you an opinion founded
on my own experience."
<P>
"Explain yourself a little more clearly," said Mr. Troy. "What do
you guarantee to tell us if we venture the ten pounds?"
<P>
"I guarantee to name the person, or the persons, on whom the
suspicion really rests. And if you employ me after that, I
guarantee (before you pay me a halfpenny more) to prove that I am
right by laying my hand on the thief."
<P>
"Let us have the guinea opinion first," said Mr. Troy.
<P>
Old Sharon made another frightful exhibition of the whole inside
of his mouth; his laugh was louder and fiercer than ever. "I like
you!" he said to Mr. Troy, "you are so devilish fond of your
money. Lord! how rich you must be! Now listen. Here's the guinea
opinion: Suspect, in this case, the very last person on whom
suspicion could possibly fall."
<P>
Moody, listening attentively, started, and changed color at those
last words. Mr. Troy looked thoroughly disappointed and made no
attempt to conceal it.
<P>
"Is that all?" he asked.
<P>
"All?" retorted the cynical vagabond. "You're a pretty lawyer!
What more can I say, when I don't know for certain whether the
witness who has given me my information has misled me or not?
Have I spoken to the girl and formed my own opinion? No! Have I
been introduced among the servants (as errand-boy, or to clean
the boots and shoes, or what not), and have I formed my own
judgement of _them?_ No! I take your opinions for granted, and I
tell you how I should set to work myself if they were _my_
opinions too--and that's a guinea's-worth, a devilish good
guinea's-worth to a rich man like you!"
<P>
Old Sharon's logic produced a certain effect on Mr. Troy, in
spite of himself. It was smartly put from his point of
view--there was no denying that.
<P>
"Even if I consented to your proposal," he said, "I should object
to your annoying the young lady with impertinent questions, or to
your being introduced as a spy into a respectable house."
<P>
Old Sharon doubled his dirty fists and drummed with them on the
rickety table in a comical frenzy of impatience while Mr. Troy
was speaking.
<P>
"What the devil do you know about my way of doing my business?"
he burst out when the lawyer had done. "One of us two is talking
like a born idiot--and (mind this) it isn't me. Look here! Your
young lady goes out for a walk, and she meets with a dirty,
shabby old beggar--I look like a shabby old beggar already, don't
I? Very good. This dirty old wretch whines and whimpers and tells
a long story, and gets sixpence out of the girl--and knows her by
that time, inside and out, as well as if he had made her--and,
mark! hasn't asked her a single ques tion, and, instead of
annoying her, has made her happy in the performance of a
charitable action. Stop a bit! I haven't done with you yet. Who
blacks your boots and shoes? Look here!" He pushed his pug-dog
off his lap, dived under the table, appeared again with an old
boot and a bottle of blackening, and set to work with tigerish
activity. "I'm going out for a walk, you know, and I may as well
make myself smart." With that announcement, he began to sing over
his work--a song of sentiment, popular in England in the early
part of the present century--"She's all my fancy painted her;
she's lovely, she's divine; but her heart it is another's; and it
never can be mine! Too-ral-loo-ral-loo'. I like a love-song.
Brush away! brush away! till I see my own pretty face in the
blacking. Hey! Here's a nice, harmless, jolly old man! sings and
jokes over his work, and makes the kitchen quite cheerful. What's
that you say? He's a stranger, and don't talk to him too freely.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak in that way of a
poor old fellow with one foot in the grave. Mrs. Cook will give
him a nice bit of dinner in the scullery; and John Footman will
look out an old coat for him. And when he's heard everything he
wants to hear, and doesn't come back again the next day to his
work--what do they think of it in the servants' hall? Do they
say, 'We've had a spy among us!' Yah! you know better than that,
by this time. The cheerful old man has been run over in the
street, or is down with the fever, or has turned up his toes in
the parish dead-house--that's what they say in the servants'
hall. Try me in your own kitchen, and see if your servants take
me for a spy. Come, come, Mr. Lawyer! out with your ten pounds,
and don't waste any more precious time about it!"
<P>
"I will consider and let you know," said Mr. Troy.
<P>
Old Sharon laughed more ferociously than ever, and hobbled round
the table in a great hurry to the place at which Moody was
sitting. He laid one hand on the steward's shoulder, and pointed
derisively with the other to Mr. Troy.
<P>
"I say, Mr. Silent-man! Bet you five pounds I never hear of that
lawyer again!"
<P>
Silently attentive all through the interview (except when he was
answering questions), Moody only replied in the fewest words. "I
don't bet," was all he said. He showed no resentment at Sharon's
familiarity, and he appeared to find no amusement in Sharon's
extraordinary talk. The old vagabond seemed actually to produce a
serious impression on him! When Mr. Troy set the example of
rising to go, he still kept his seat, and looked at the lawyer as
if he regretted leaving the atmosphere of tobacco smoke reeking
in the dirty room.
<P>
"Have you anything to say before we go?" Mr. Troy asked.
<P>
Moody rose slowly and looked at Old Sharon. "Not just now, sir,"
he replied, looking away again, after a moment's reflection.
<P>
Old Sharon interpreted Moody's look and Moody's reply from his
own peculiar point of view. He suddenly drew the steward away
into a corner of the room.
<P>
"I say!" he began, in a whisper. "Upon your solemn word of honor,
you know--are you as rich as the lawyer there?"
<P>
"Certainly not."
<P>
"Look here! It's half price to a poor man. If you feel like
coming back, on your own account--five pounds will do from _you_.
There! there! Think of it!--think of it!"
<P>
"Now, then!" said Mr. Troy, waiting for his companion, with the
door open in his hand. He looked back at Sharon when Moody joined
him. The old vagabond was settled again in his armchair, with his
dog in his lap, his pipe in his mouth, and his French novel in
his hand; exhibiting exactly the picture of frowzy comfort which
he had presented when his visitors first entered the room.
<P>
"Good-day," said Mr. Troy, with haughty condescension.
<P>
"Don't interrupt me!" rejoined Old Sharon, absorbed in his novel.
"You've had your guinea's worth. Lord! what a lovely book this
is! Don't interrupt me!"
<P>
"Impudent scoundrel!" said Mr. Troy, when he and Moody were in
the street again. "What could my friend mean by recommending him?
Fancy his expecting me to trust him with ten pounds! I consider
even the guinea completely thrown away."
<P>
"Begging your pardon, sir," said Moody, "I don't quite agree with
you there."
<P>
"What! you don't mean to tell me you understand that oracular
sentence of his--'Suspect the very last person on whom suspicion
could possibly fall.' Rubbish!"
<P>
"I don't say I understand it, sir. I only say it has set me
thinking."
<P>
"Thinking of what? Do your suspicions point to the thief?"
<P>
"If you will please to excuse me, Mr. Troy, I should like to wait
a while before I answer that."
<P>
Mr. Troy suddenly stood still, and eyed his companion a little
distrustfully.
<P>
"Are you going to turn detective-policeman on your own account?"
he asked.
<P>
"There's nothing I won't turn to, and try, to help Miss Isabel in
this matter," Moody answered, firmly. "I have saved a few hundred
pounds in Lady Lydiard's service, and I am ready to spend every
farthing of it, if I can only discover the thief."
<P>
Mr. Troy walked on again. "Miss Isabel seems to have a good
friend in you," he said. He was (perhaps unconsciously) a little
offended by the independent tone in which the steward spoke,
after he had himself engaged to take the vindication of the
girl's innocence into his own hands.
<P>
"Miss Isabel has a devoted servant and slave in me!" Moody
answered, with passionate enthusiasm.
<P>
"Very creditable; I haven't a word to say against it," Mr. Troy
rejoined. "But don't forget that the young lady has other devoted
friends besides you. I am her devoted friend, for instance--I
have promised to serve her, and I mean to keep my word. You will
excuse me for adding that my experience and discretion are quite
as likely to be useful to her as your enthusiasm. I know the
world well enough to be careful in trusting strangers. It will do
you no harm, Mr. Moody, to follow my example."
<P>
Moody accepted his reproof with becoming patience and
resignation. "If you have anything to propose, sir, that will be
of service to Miss Isabel," he said, "I shall be happy if I can
assist you in the humblest capacity."
<P>
"And if not?" Mr. Troy inquired, conscious of having nothing to
propose as he asked the question.
<P>
"In that case, sir, I must take my own course, and blame nobody
but myself if it leads me astray."
<P>
Mr. Troy said no more: he parted from Moody at the next turning.
<P>
Pursuing the subject privately in his own mind, he decided on
taking the earliest opportunity of visiting Isabel at her aunt's
house, and on warning her, in her future intercourse with Moody,
not to trust too much to the steward's discretion. "I haven't a
doubt," thought the lawyer, "of what he means to do next. The
infatuated fool is going back to Old Sharon!"
