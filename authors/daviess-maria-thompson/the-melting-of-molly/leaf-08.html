<p>Some days are like the miracle flowers that open in the garden from
plants you didn't expect to bloom at all. I might have been born, lived
and died without having this one come into my life, and now that I have
had it I don't know how to write it, except in the crimson of blood, the
blue of flame, the gold of glory--and a tinge of light green would well
express the part I have played. But it is all over at last and--
</p><p>Ruth Chester was the unfolding of the first hour-petal and I got a
glimpse of a heart of gold that I feel dumb with worship to think of.
She's God's own good woman and He made her in one of His holy hours. I
wish I could have borne her, or she me, and the tenderness of her arms
was a sacrament. We two women just stood aside with life's artifices and
concealments and let our own hearts do the talking.
</p><p>She said she had come because she felt that if she talked with me I
might be better able to understand Alfred when he came and that she had
seen that the judge was very determined, and she thoroughly recognized
his force of character. We stopped there while I gave her the document
to read. I suppose it was dishonorable, but I needed her protection from
it. I'm glad she had the strength of mind to walk with a head high in
the air to Judy's range and burn it up. Anything might have happened if
she hadn't. And even now I feel that only my marriage vows will close up
the case for the judge--even yet he may--But when Ruth had got done
with Alfred, she had wiped Judge Wade's appreciation of him completely
off my mind and destroyed it in tender words that burned us both worse
than Judy's fire burned the letter. She did me an awfully good service.
</p><p>"And so you see, you lovely woman you, do you not, that God has
made you for him as a tribute to his greatness and it is given to
you to fulfil a destiny?" She was so beautiful as she said it that
I had to turn my eyes away, but I felt as I did when those awful
'<u>let-not-man-put-asunder</u>'--from Mr. Carter--words were spoken
over me by Mr. Raines, the Methodist minister. It made me wild, and
before I knew it I had poured out the whole truth to her in a perfect
cataract of words. The truth always acts on women as some hitherto
untried drug, and you can never tell what the reaction is going to be.
In this case I was stricken dumb and found it hard to see.
</p><p>"Oh, dear heart," she exclaimed as she reached out and drew me into her
lovely gracious arms, "then the privilege is all the more wonderful for
you, as you make some sacrifice to complete his life. Having suffered
this, you will be all the greater woman to understand him. I accept my
own sorrow at his hands willingly, as it gives me the larger sympathy
for his work, though he will no longer need my personal encouragement
as he has for years. In the light of his love this lesser feeling for
Doctor Moore will soon pass away and the accord between you will be
complete." This was more than I could stand and feeling less than a
worm, I turned my face into her breast and wailed. Now who would have
thought that girl could dance as she did?
</p><p>By this time I was in such a solution of grief that I would soon have
had to be sopped up with a sponge if Pet hadn't run in bubbling over
like a lovely, white, linen-clad glass of Rhine wine and seltzer.
Happiness has a habit of not even acknowledging the presence of grief
and Pet didn't seem to see our red noses, crushed draperies and
generally damp atmosphere.
</p><p>"Molly," she said with a deliciously young giggle, "Tom says for you to
send him ten dollars to spend getting the brass band half drunk before
the six o'clock train, on which your Mr. Bennett comes. He has spent
five dollars paying the negroes to polish up their instruments and clean
up the uniforms and it cost him twenty-five to bail the cornettist out
of jail for roost robbing, and it takes a whole gallon of whisky to get
any spirit into the drummer. He says tell you that as this is your
shindig you ought at least to pay the piper. Hurry up, he's waiting for
me, and here's the kiss he told me to put on your left ear!"
</p><p>"I suppose you delivered that kiss straight from where he gave it to
you, Pettie, dear," I had the spirit to say as I went over to the desk
for my pocket-book.
</p><p>"Why, Molly, you know me better than that!" she exclaimed from behind a
perfect rose cloud of blushes.
</p><p>"I know Tom better than I do you," I answered as she fled with the ten
in her hand. I looked at Ruth Chester and we both laughed. It is true
that a broader sympathy is one of the by-products of sorrow, and a week
ago I might have resented Pet to a marked degree instead of giving her
the ten dollars and a blessing.
</p><p>"I'm going quick, Molly, with that laugh between us," Ruth said as she
rose and took me into her arms again for just half a second, and before
I could stop her, she was gone.
</p><p>She met Billy toiling up the front step with a long piece of rusty iron
gas-pipe, which took off an inch of paint as it bumped against the edge
of the porch. She bent down and kissed the back of his neck, which theft
was almost more than I could stand, and apparently more than Billy was
prepared to accept.
</p><p>"Go way, girl," he said in his rudest manner; "don't you see I'm busy?"
</p><p>I met him in the front hall just in time to prevent a hopeless scar on
my hardwood floor. He was hot, perspiring and panting, but full of
triumph.
</p><p>"I found it, Molly, I found it!" he exclaimed as he let the heavy pipe
drop almost on the bare pink toes. "You can git a hammer and pound the
end sharp and bend it so no whale we ketch can git away for nothing. You
and Doc kin put it in your trunk 'cause it's too long for mine, and I
can carry Doc's shirts and things in mine. Git the hammer quick and I'll
help you fix it!" The pain in my breast was almost more than I could
bear.
</p><p>"Lover," I said as I knelt down by him in the dim old hall and put my
arms around him as if to shield him from some blow I couldn't help being
aimed at him, "you wouldn't mind much, would you, if just this time your
Molly couldn't go with you? Your father is going to take good care of
you and--and maybe bring you back to me some day."
</p><p>"Why, Molly," he said, flaring his astonished blue eyes at me, "'taint
me to be took care of! I ain't a-going to leave you here, for maybe a
bear to come out of a circus and eat you up, with me and Doc gone.
'Sides Doc ain't no good and maybe wouldn't help me hold the rope right
to keep the whale from gitting away. He don't know how to do like I tell
him like you do."
</p><p>"Try him, lover, and maybe he will--will learn to--" I couldn't help the
tears that came to stop my words.
</p><p>"Now you see, Molly, how you'd cry with that kiss-spot gone," he said
with an amused, manly, little tenderness in his voice that I had never
heard before, and he cuddled his lips against mine in almost the only
voluntary kiss he had given me since I had got him into his ridiculous
little trousers under his blouses. "You can have most a hundred kisses
every night if you don't say no more about not a-going and fix that
whale hook for me quick," he coaxed against my cheek.
</p><p>Oh, little lover, little lover, you didn't know what you were saying
with your baby wisdom, and your rust-grimy, little paddie burned the
sleep-place on my breast like a terrible white heat from which I was
powerless to defend myself. You are mine, you are, you _are!_ You
are soul of my soul and heart of my heart and spirit of my spirit
and--and you ought to have been flesh of my flesh!
</p><p>I don't know how I managed to answer Mrs. Johnson's call from my front
gate, but I sometimes think that women have a torture-proof clause in
their constitutions.
</p><p>She and Aunt Bettie had just come up the street from Aunt Bettie's house
and the Pollard cook was following them with a large basket, in which
were packed the things Aunt Bettie was contributing to the entertainment
of the distinguished citizen. Mr. Johnson is Alfred's nearest kinsman in
Hillsboro, and, of course, he is to be their guest while he is in town.
</p><p>"He'll be feeding his eyes on Molly, so he'll not even know he's eating
my Washington almond pudding with Thomas' old port in it," teased Aunt
Bettie with a laugh as I went across the street with them.
</p><p>"There's going to be a regular epidemic of love in Hillsboro, I do
believe," she continued in her usual strain of sentimental speculation.
"I saw Mr. Graves talking to Delia Hawes in front of the store an hour
ago, as I came out from looking at the blue chintz to match Pet for the
west wing, and they were both so absorbed they didn't even see me. That
was what might have been called a conflagration dinner you gave the
other night, Molly, in more ways than one. I wish a spark had set off
Benton Wade and Henrietta, too. Maybe it did, but is just taking fire
slowly."
</p><p>I think it would be a good thing just to let Aunt Bettie blindfold every
unmarried person in this town and marry them to the first person they
touch hands with. It would be fun for her and then we could have peace
and apparently as much happiness as we are going to have anyway. Mrs.
Johnson seemed to be in somewhat the same state of mind as I found
myself.
</p><p>"Humph," she said as we went up the front steps, "I'll be glad when you
are married and settled, Molly Carter, so the rest of this town can
quiet down into peace once more, and I sincerely hope every woman under
fifty in Hillsboro who is already married will stay in that state until
she reaches that age. But I do believe if the law marched widows from
grave number one to altar number two they would get into trouble and
fuss along the road. But come on in, both of you, and help me get this
marriage feast ready, if I must! The day is going by on greased wheels
and I can't let Mr. Johnson's crotchets be neglected, Al Bennett or no
Al Bennett!"
</p><p>And from then on for hours and hours I was strapped to a torture wheel
that turned and turned, minute after minute, as it ground spice and
sugar and bridal meats and me relentlessly into a great suffering pulp.
Could I ever in all my life have hungered for food and been able to get
it past the lump in my throat that grew larger with the seconds? And if
Alfred's pudding tasted of the salt of dead sea-fruit this evening, it
was from my surreptitious tears that dripped into it.
</p><p>It was late, very late before Mrs. Johnson realized it and shooed me
home to get ready to go to the train along with the brass band and all
the other welcomes.
</p><p>I hurried all I could, but for long minutes I stood in front of my
mirror and questioned myself. Could this slow, pale, dead-eyed, slim,
drooping girl be the rollicking child of a Molly who had looked out of
that mirror at me one short week ago? Where were the wings on her heels,
the glint in her curls, the laugh on her mouth and the devil in her
eyes?
</p><p>Slowly at last I lifted the blue muslin, twenty-three-inch waist shroud
and let it slip over my head and fall slimly around me. I had fastened
the neck button and was fumbling the next one into the buttonhole when I
suddenly heard laughing excited voices coming up the side street that
ran just under my west window. Something told me that Alfred had come on
the five-down train instead of the six-up and I fairly reeled to the
window and peeped through the shutters.
</p><p>They were all in a laughing group around him, with Tom as master of
ceremonies, and Ruth Chester was looking up into his face with an
expression I am glad I can never forget. It killed all my regrets on the
score of his future.
</p><p>It took two good looks to take him all in and then I must have missed
some of him, for all in all, he was so large that he stretched your eyes
to behold him. He's grown seven feet tall, I don't know how many pounds
he weighs and I don't want anybody ever to tell me!
</p><p>I had never thought enough about evolution to know whether I believed in
it and woman's suffrage, but I do now! I know that millions of years ago
a great, big, distinguished hippopotamus stepped out of the woods and
frightened one of my foremothers so that she turned tail and fled
through a thicket that almost tore her limb from limb, right into the
arms of her own mate. That's what I did! I caught that blue satin belt
together with one hand and ran through my garden right over a bed of
savage tiger-lilies and flung myself into John Moore's office, slammed
the door and backed up against it.
</p><p>"He's come!" I gasped. "And I'm frightened to death, with nobody but you
to run to. Hide me quick! He's fat and I <u>hate</u> him!" I was that
deadly cold you can get when fear runs into your very marrow and
congeals the blood in your arteries. "Quick, quick!" I panted.
</p><p>He must have been as pale as I was, and for an eternity of a second he
looked at me, then suddenly heaven shone from his eyes and he opened his
arms to me with just one word.
</p><p>"Here?"
</p><p>I went.
</p><p>He held me gently for a half-second, and then with a sob which I felt
rather than heard, he crushed me to him and stopped my breath with his
lips on mine. I understood things then that I never had before, and I
felt that wise guardian man-angel take his fingers from mine and leave
me safe at last. I raised my hand and pressed it against John's wet
lashes until he could let me speak and I was melted into his very breast
itself.
</p><p>"Molly," he said when enough tenderness had come back into his arms to
let me breathe, "you have almost killed me!"
</p><p>"You!" I exclaimed, crowding still closer, or at least trying to. "It's
not <u>you</u>; it's I that am killed, and you did it! I know you don't
really want me, but I can't help that I'd rather you'd do the suffering
with me than to do it myself away from you. I'm so hungry and thirsty
for you that--that I can't diet any longer!" I put the case the
strongest way I knew how and got a swooning, maddening, luscious result.
</p><p>"Want you, Molly?" he almost sobbed, and I felt his heart pounding hard
next to my shoulder.
</p><p>"Yes, want me!" I answered with more spirit than breath left in me. "I
refuse to believe you are as stupid as I am, and anybody with even an
ordinary amount of brains must have seen how hard I was fighting for
you. I feel sure I left no stone unturned. Some of them I can already
think back and see myself tugging at, and it makes me hot all over. I'm
foolish, and always was, so I'm to be excused for acting that awful way,
but you are to blame for <u>letting</u> me do it. I'm going to be your
punishment for life for not having been stern and stopped me. You had
better stop me some now anyway, for if I go on loving you as I have been
for the last few minutes it will make you uncomfortable."
</p><p>"Peaches," he said, after he had hushed me with another broken dose of
love, as large as he thought I could stand--I could have stood more!--"I
am never going to tell you how long I have loved you, but that day you
came to me all in a flutter with Al Bennett's letter in your hand it is
going to take you a lifetime to settle for. You were mine--and Bill's!
How <u>could</u> you--but women don't understand!" I felt him shudder
in my arms as I held him close. I was repaid for all those tiresome
exercises I had taken by the strength to crush him against my breast
almost as hard as he crushed me. Our combined strength was terrific,
dangerous to life and ribs, but--heavenly!
</p><p>"Don't women know, John?" I managed to ask softly in memory of a like
question he had put to me across that bread and jam with the rose
a-listening from the dark.
</p><p>What brought me to consciousness was his fumbling with the buttons at
the waist of that blue muslin relict of a sentiment. I had fastened but
one, and the lace had got caught on his sleeve buttons.
</p><p>"Please don't button me into his possession," I laughed under his chin.
"I'm still scared to death of him, and you haven't hid me yet!"
</p><p>"Molly," he asked, this time with a heaven-laugh, "where could you be
more effectually hid from Al Bennett than in my arms?"
</p><p>I spent ten minutes telling Billy what a hippopotamus really looks like
as I put him to bed, but later, much as I should have liked to, I
couldn't consume that horrible dinner, that I had helped prepare at the
Johnsons, in the shelter of John's arms, and I had to face Alfred. Ruth
Chester was there, and she faced him too.
</p><p>A man that can't be happy with a woman who is willing to "fulfil his
destiny" doesn't deserve to be.
</p><p>Then we came over here, and John had the most beautiful time persuading
Aunt Adeline how a good man like Mr. Carter would want his young widow
to be taken care of by being married to a safe friend of his instead of
being flighty and having folks wondering whom she would marry.
</p><p>"You know yourself how hard a time a beautiful young widow has, Mrs.
Henderson," he said in the tone of voice that always makes his patients
glad to take his worst doses. He got his blessing and me--with a
warning.
</p><p>A lovely night wind is blowing across my garden and bringing me
congratulations from all my flower family. Flowers are a part of love
and the wooing of it, and they understand. I am waiting for the light to
go out behind the tall trees over which the moon is stealthily sinking.
He promised me to put it out right away, and I'm watching the glow that
marks the place where my own two men creatures are going to rest, with
my heart in full song.
</p><p>He needs rest, he is so very tired and worn. He confessed it as I stood
on the step above him to-night, after he had taken his own good night
from me out on the porch. When he explained to me how his agony over me
for all these months had kept him walking the floor night after night,
not knowing that I was waiting for the light to go out, I gave myself a
sweetness that I am going to say a prayer for the last thing before I
sleep. I took his head in my arms and pressed his cheek down against
Billy's sleep-place on my breast over my heart and put my lips to that
drake-tail kiss-spot that has tempted me for I won't say how long. Then
I fled--and so did he!
</p><p>I had about decided to burn this book, because I shan't need it any
longer, for he says he and Billy and I are going to play so much golf
and tennis that I shall keep as thin as he wants me to be without any
more melting or freezing, or starving, but perhaps he would like to read
the little red devil. Do you suppose he would?
