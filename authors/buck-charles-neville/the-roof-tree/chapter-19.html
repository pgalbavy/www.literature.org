<p>Even the peppery Opdyke did not venture to break heatedly in on the
pause that followed those regretful words. Into the minds of the
majority stole a sense, vague and indefinable it is true, that a tragic
impasse was closing on a situation over which had flashed a rainbow
gleam of possible solution. Ahead lay the future with its sinister
shadows--darker because of the alternative they had glimpsed in its
passing.
</p>
<p>Old Jim Rowlett came to his feet, and drew his thin shoulders
back--shoulders that had been broad and strong enough to support heavy
burdens through trying years.
</p><p>"Mr. Thornton," he said, and the aged voice held a quaver of emotion
which men were not accustomed to hearing it carry, "I wants ter talk
with ye with ther severe freedom of an' old man counsellin' a young
'un--an' hit hain't ergoin' ter be in ther manner of a Doane argyfyin'
with a Harper so much es of a father advisin' with a son."
</p><p>The young Thornton met those eyes so full of eagle boldness yet so
tempered with kindness, and to his own expression came a responsive
flash of that winning boyishness which these men had not seen on his
face before.
</p><p>"Mr. Rowlett," he made answer in a low and reverent voice, "I hain't got
no remembrance of my pappy, but I'd love ter think he favoured ye right
smart."
</p><p>Slowly the low-pitched voice of the Nestor began to dominate the place,
cloudy with its pipe-smoke and redolent with the stale fumes of fires
long dead. Like some Hogarth picture against a sombre background the
ungainly figures of men stood out of shadow and melted into it: men
unkempt and tribal in their fierceness of aspect.
</p><p>Old Jim made to blaze again before their eyes, with a rude and vigorous
eloquence, all the ruthless bane of the toll-taking years before the
truce. He stripped naked every specious claim of honour and courage with
which its votaries sought to hallow the vicious system of the vendetta.
He told in words of simple force how he and Caleb Harper had striven to
set up and maintain a sounder substitute, and how for the permanence of
that life-work they had prayed.
</p><p>"Caleb an' me," he said at last, "we didn't never succeed without we put
by what we asked others ter forego. Yore wife's father was kilt most
foully--an' Caleb looked over hit. My own boy fell in like fashion, an'
my blood wasn't no tamer then thet in other veins--but yit I held my
hand. Ye comes ter us now, frettin' under ther sting of a wrong done ter
ye--an' I don't say yore wrath hain't righteous, but ye've done been
vouchsafed sich a chanst as God don't proffer ter many, an' God calls
fer sacrifices from them elected ter sarve him."
</p><p>He paused there for a moment and passed his knotted hand over the
parchment-like skin of his gaunt temples, then he went on: "Isaac
offered up Jacob--or leastways he stud ready ter do hit. Ye calls on us
ter trust ye an' stand with ye, an' we calls on <u>you</u> in turn fer a
pledge of faith. Fer God's sake, boy, be big enough ter bide yore time
twell ther Harpers an' Doanes hev done come outen this distemper of
passion. I tells ye ye kain't do no less an' hold yore self-esteem."
</p><p>He paused, then came forward with his old hand extended and trembling in
a palsy of eagerness, and despite the turmoil of a few minutes before,
such a taut silence prevailed that the asthmatic rustiness of the old
man's breath was an audible wheezing through the room.
</p><p>The young messenger had only to lift his hand then and grasp that
outheld one--and peace would have been established--yet his one free arm
seemed to him more difficult to lift in a gesture of compliance than
that which was bandaged down.
</p><p>His own voice broke and he answered with difficulty: "Give me a leetle
spell ter ponder--I kain't answer ye off-hand."
</p><p>Thornton's eyes went over, and in the lighted doorway fell upon Bas
Rowlett sitting with his features schooled to a masked and unctuous
hypocrisy, but back of that disguise the wounded man fancied he could
read the satisfaction of one whose plans march toward success. His own
teeth clicked together and the sweat started on his temples. He had to
look away--or forget every consideration other than his own sense of
outrage and the oath he had sworn to avenge it.
</p><p>But the features of old Jim were like the solace of a reef-light in a
tempest; old Jim whose son had fallen and who had forgiven without
weakness.
</p><p>If what Parish knew to be duty prevailed over the passionate tide that
ran high in temptation, what then? Would he live to serve as shepherd
when his undertaking under the private compact had been waived and the
other man stood free to indulge his perfidy?
</p><p>Finally he laid his hand on the shoulder of the veteran.
</p><p>"Mr. Rowlett," he declared, steadily, "I've got ter ask ye ter give me
full twenty-four hours afore I kin answer ye fer sartain. Will yore men
agree ter hold matters es they stands twell this time termorrer?"
</p><p>Jim Rowlett glanced at Hump Doane and the cripple nodded an energetic
affirmation. He was hard to convince but when convinced he was done with
doubt.
</p><p>"I'd ruther heer Mr. Thornton talk thetaway," he declared, crisply,
"then ter hev him answer up heedless an' over-hasty."
</p><p>With his knee brushing against that of old Jim Rowlett, Parish Thornton
rode away from that meeting, and from the sentinels in the laurel he
heard no hint of sound.
</p><p>When he had come to the place where his pistol lay hidden he withdrew it
and replaced it in his pocket, and a little farther on where the creek
wound its way through a shimmering glade and two trails branched, the
veteran drew rein.
</p><p>"I reckon we parts company hyar," he said, "but I feels like we've done
accomplished a right good day's work. Termorrow Hump an' me'll fare over
ter yore house and git yore answer."
</p><p>"I'm obleeged," responded the new chief of the Thorntons, but when he
was left alone he did not ride on to the house in the river bend.
Instead he went to the other house upon whose door his first letter of
threat had been posted, and hitching his horse in its dilapidated shed
he set out on foot for the near-by place where Bas Rowlett dwelt alone.
</p><p>Twenty-four hours had been all he could ask in reaching a decision on
such an issue, yet before he could make answer much remained to be
determined, and in that determination he must rely largely on chances
which he could not hope to regulate or force into a pattern of success.
</p><p>He had, for example, no way of guessing how long it would be before Bas
returned to his farm or whether, when he came, he would be alone--and
to-morrow's answer depended upon an unwitnessed interview between them.
</p><p>But he had arrived on foot and taken up his place of concealment at the
back of the log structure with only a half-hour of waiting when the
other man appeared, riding in leisurely unconcern and unaccompanied.
</p><p>Thornton loosed his pistol and drew back into the lee of the square
stone chimney where he remained safe from discovery until the other had
passed into the stable and begun to ungirth his saddle.
</p><p>The house stood remote from any neighbouring habitation, and the road at
its front was an infrequently used sledge trail. The stable was at its
side, while back of the buildings themselves, angling off behind the
screening shoulder of a steep spur of hillside, stretched a small
orchard where only gnarled apple trees and a few "bee-gums" broke a
small and level amphitheatre into which the possible passerby could not
see.
</p><p>The lord of this manor stood bent, his fingers wrestling with the
stubbornness of a rusted buckle, when he heard at his back, low of tone
but startlingly staccato in its quality of imperativeness, the single
syllable, "Bas!"
</p><p>Rowlett wheeled, leaping back with a hand sweeping instinctively to his
holster--but he arrested that belligerent gesture with a sudden
paralysis of caution because of the look in the eyes of the surprise
visitor who stood poised with forward-bending readiness of body, and a
revolver levelled in a hand of bronze steadiness.
</p><p>"I'm on my feet now, Bas," came a quiet voice that chilled the hearer
with an inexplicable rigour, "I reckon ye hain't fergot my promise."
</p><p>Rowlett gave way backward until the wall obstructed his retreat, and in
obedience to the unspoken command in the eyes of his visitor, he
extended both arms high above his head, but while he stood unmoving, his
adroit mind was racing.
</p><p>He knew what he would do if the situation were reversed, and he
believed that the other was waiting only to punish him with a
castigation of vengeful words before he shot him down and left him lying
in the trampled straw and manure of that unclean stable.
</p><p>Now he had to brace himself against the tortures of a physical fear from
which he had believed himself immune. So he stood breathing unevenly and
waiting, and while he waited the temper of his nerves was being drawn as
it is drawn from over-heated steel.
</p><p>"Come on with me," commanded Thornton.
</p><p>The surprised man obeyed sullenly, casting an anxious eye about in the
slender hope of interruption, and when they reached the orchard where
even that chance ended Parish Thornton spoke again:
</p><p>"When us two tuck oath ter sottle matters betwixt ourselves--I didn't
skeercely foresee what was comin' ter pass. Now I kain't seek ter make
ther compact hold over till a fairer time, ner seek ter change hit's
terms, nuther, without ye're willin'."
</p><p>"Suppose I hain't willin'?"
</p><p>For answer Parish Thornton sheathed his weapon.
</p><p>"Now," he said with a deadly quiet, "we're on even terms. Either you an'
me draws our pistols an' fights twell one of us draps dead or else----"
</p><p>He paused, and saw the face of his enemy go green and pasty as Rowlett
licked his lips yet left his hands hanging at his sides. At length the
intriguer demanded, "Or else--what?"
</p><p>Thornton knew then beyond doubt what he already believed. This man was
quailing and had no stomach for the fair combat of duel yet he would
never relinquish his determination to glut his hatred by subterfuge.
</p><p>"Or else ye've got ter enter inter a <u>new</u> compact."
</p><p>"What's thet?" A ring of hope sounded in the question, since in any
fresh deal lies the possibility of better fortune.
</p><p>"Ter go on holdin' yore hand twell this feud business blows over--an' I
sarves notice on ye thet our own private war's opened up ergin."
</p><p>"I reckon," said Rowlett, seeking to masquerade his relief under the
semblance of responsible self-effacement, "common decency ter other
folks lays thet need on both of us alike."
</p><p>"I'm offerin' ye a free choice," warned Thornton, "but onless ye're
ready ter fight hyar an' now ye've p'int-blank got ter walk in thar an'
set down in handwrite, with yore name signed at ther bottom, a full
confession thet ye hired me shot thet night."
</p><p>"Like hell I will!" Bas roared out his rejection of that alternative
with his swarthy cheekbones flaming redly, and into his rapidly and
shiftily working mind came the comfort of a realization which in that
first surprise and terror had escaped him. It was not to his enemy's
first interest to goad him into a mortal clash, since that would make it
impossible to give a favourable answer to the leaders to-morrow--and
incidentally it would be almost certain to mean Thornton's own death.
</p><p>Now he straightened up with a ghost of renewed bravado and shook his
head while an enigmatical grin twisted his lips.
</p><p>"S'posin'," he made insolent suggestion, "I don't see fit ter do nuther
one ner t'other? S'posin' I jest tells ye ter go ter hell?"
</p><p>Parish had anticipated that question and was prepared, if he were forced
so far, to back threat with execution.
</p><p>"I aims ter <u>make</u> ye fight--or agree--either one," he answered, evenly,
and when Bas laughed at him he stepped forward and, with lightning
quickness, struck the other squarely across the face.
</p><p>Though the blow fell open-handed it brought blood from the nose and
spurts of insane fury from the eyes.
</p><p>Rowlett still kept his arms down, but he lunged and sought to drive his
knee to his adversary's groin, meaning to draw and fire during the
moment of paralyzing pain that must ensue.
</p><p>As it happened, though, Parish had also anticipated some such
manoeuvre of foul fighting, and he sprung aside in time to let the
unbalanced Rowlett pitch stumblingly forward. When he straightened he
was again looking into the muzzle of a drawn pistol.
</p><p>Rowlett had been drawing his own weapon as he lunged, but now he dropped
it as if it had scalded his fingers, and once more hastily raised his
hands above his head.
</p><p>The whole byplay was swift to such timing as belongs to sleight-of-hand,
but the split-second quickness of the left-hander was as conclusively
victorious as if the matter had been deliberate, and now he had margin
to realize that he need not fire--for the present.
</p><p>"Ef ye'd been jest a mite quicker in drawin', Bas," he declared,
ironically, "or jest a mite tardier in throwin' down thet gun--I'd hev
hed ter kill ye. Now we kin talk some more."
</p><p>The conflict of wills was over and Rowlett's voice changed to a whine as
he asked beseechingly: "What proof hev I got ye won't show ther paper
ter some outsider afore we fights hit out?"
</p><p>"Ye've got my pledge," answered Thornton, disdainfully, "an' albeit ye
knows ye don't keep 'em yoreself, ye knows thet I don't nuver break 'em.
Ye've got ther knowledge, moreover, thet I hain't a-goin' ter be content
save ter sottle this business with ye fust handed--man ter man." He
paused there, and his tone altered when he continued: "Thet paper'll lay
whar no man won't nuver see hit save myself--unless ye breaks yore
word. Ef I gits murdered, one man'll know whar thet paper's at--but not
what's in hit. He'll give hit over ter ther Harpers an' they'll
straightway hunt ye down an' kill ye like a mad dog. What does ye say?"
</p><p>The other stood with face demoniacally impassioned, yet fading into the
pasty gray of fear--the fear that was the more unmanageable because it
was a new emotion which had never risen to confront him before.
</p><p>"I knows when I've got ter knock under," he made sullen admission, at
last, "an' thet time's done come now. But I hain't ther only enemy ye've
got. S'pose atter all ther war breaks out afresh an' ye gits slain in
battle--or in some fray with other men. Then I'd hev ter die jest ther
same, albeit I didn't hev no hand in ther matter."
</p><p>Thornton laughed.
</p><p>"I hain't seekin' ter make ye gorryntee my long life, Bas. Ef I falls in
any pitch-battle or gits kilt in a fashion thet's p'intedly an outside
matter, ye hain't a-goin' ter suffer fer hit."
</p><p>As the long-drawn breath went out between the parted lips of Bas Rowlett
he wilted into a spectacle of abject surrender, then turning he led the
way to the house, found pencil and paper, and wrote laboriously as the
other dictated. At the end he signed his name.
</p><p>Then Parish Thornton said, "Now I aims ter hev ye walk along with me
till I gits my horse an' starts home. I don't 'low ter trust ye till
this paper's put in a safe place, an' should we meet up with anybody
don't forgit--I won't fail ter shoot ef ye boggles!"
