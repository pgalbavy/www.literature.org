<p>Saladin looked at them, but gave them no greeting. Then he
spoke:
</p>
<p>"Woman, you have had my message. You know that your rank is taken
from you, and that with it my promises are at an end; you know
also that you come hither to suffer the death of faithless women.
Is it so?"
</p><p>"I know all these things, great Salah-ed-din," answered Rosamund.
</p><p>"Tell me, then, do you come of your own free will, unforced by
any, and why does the knight Sir Wulf, whose life I spared and do
not seek, kneel at your side?"
</p><p>"I come of my own free will, Salah-ed-din, as your emirs can tell
you; ask them. For the rest, my kinsman must answer for himself."
</p><p>"Sultan," said Wulf, "I counselled the lady Rosamund that she
should come--not that she needed such counsel--and, having given
it, I accompanied her by right of blood and of Justice, since her
offence against you is mine also. Her fate is my fate."
</p><p>"I have no quarrel against you whom I forgave, therefore you must
take your own way to follow the path she goes."
</p><p>"Doubtless," answered Wulf, "being a Christian among many sons of
the Prophet, it will not be hard to find a friendly scimitar to
help me on that road. I ask of your goodness that her fate may be
my fate."
</p><p>"What!" said Saladin. "You are ready to die with her, although
you are young and strong, and there are so many other women in
the world?"
</p><p>Wulf smiled and nodded his head.
</p><p>"Good. Who am I that I should stand between a fool and his folly?
I grant the boon. Your fate shall be her fate; Wulf D'Arcy, you
shall drink of the cup of my slave Rosamund to its last
bitterest dregs."
</p><p>"I desire no less," said Wulf coolly.
</p><p>Now Saladin looked at Rosamund and asked,
</p><p>"Woman, why have you come here to brave my vengeance? Speak on if
you have aught to ask."
</p><p>Then Rosamund rose from her knees, and, standing before him,
said:
</p><p>"I am come, O my mighty lord, to plead for the people of
Jerusalem, because it was told me that you would listen to no
other voice than that of this your slave. See, many moons ago,
you had a vision concerning me. Thrice you dreamed in the night
that I, the niece whom you had never seen, by some act of mine
should be the means of saving much life and a way of peace.
Therefore you tore me from my home and brought my father to a
bloody death, as you are about to bring his daughter; and after
much suffering and danger I fell into your power, and was treated
with great honour. Still I, who am a Christian, and who grew
sick with the sight of the daily slaughter and outrage of my kin,
strove to escape from you, although you had warned me that the
price of this crime was death; and in the end, through the wit
and sacrifice of another woman, I did escape.
</p><p>"Now I return to pay that price, and behold! your vision is
fulfilled--or, at the least, you can fulfil it if God should
touch your heart with grace, seeing that of my own will I am come
to pray you, Salah-ed-din, to spare the city, and for its blood
to accept mine as a token and an offering.
</p><p>"Oh, my lord! as you are great, be merciful. What will it avail
you in the day of your own judgment that you have added another
eighty thousand to the tally of your slain, and with them many
more thousands of your own folk, since the warriors of Jerusalem
will not die unavenged? Give them their lives and let them go
free, and win thereby the gratitude of mankind and the
forgiveness of God above."
</p><p>So Rosamund spoke, and stretching out her arms towards him, was
silent.
</p><p>"These things I offered to them, and they were refused," answered
Saladin. "Why should I grant them now that they are conquered?"
</p><p>"My lord, Strong-to-Aid," said Rosamund, "do you, who are so
brave, blame yonder knights and soldiers because they fought on
against desperate odds? Would you not have called them cowards if
they had yielded up the city where their Saviour died and struck
no blow to save it? Oh! I am outworn! I can say no more; but once
again, most humbly and on my knees, I beseech you speak the word
of mercy, and let not your triumph be dyed red with the blood of
women and of little children."
</p><p>Then casting herself upon her face, Rosamund clasped the hem of
his royal robe with her hands, and pressed it to her forehead.
</p><p>So for a while she lay there in the shimmering moonlight, while
utter silence fell upon all that vast multitude of armed men as
they waited for the decree of fate to be uttered by the
conqueror's lips. But Saladin sat still as a statue, gazing at
the domes and towers of Jerusalem outlined against the deep blue
sky.
</p><p>"Rise," he said at length, "and know, niece, that you have played
your part in a fashion worthy of my race, and that I,
Salah-ed-din, am proud of you. Know also that I will weigh your
prayer as I have weighed that of none other who breathes upon the
earth. Now I must take counsel with my own heart, and to-morrow
it shall be granted--or refused. To you, who are doomed to die,
and to the knight who chooses to die with you, according to the
ancient law and custom, I offer the choice of Islam, and with it
life and honour."
</p><p>"We refuse," answered Rosamund and Wulf with one voice. The
Sultan bowed his head as though he expected no other answer, and
glanced round, as all thought to order the executioners to do
their office. But he said only to a captain of his Mameluks:
</p><p>"Take them; keep them under guard and separate them, till my word
of death comes to you. Your life shall answer for their safety.
Give them food and drink, and let no harm touch them until I bid
you."
</p><p>The Mameluk bowed and advanced with his company of soldiers. As
they prepared to go with them, Rosamund asked:
</p><p>"Tell me of your grace, what of Masouda, my friend?"
</p><p>"She died for you; seek her beyond the grave," answered Saladin,
whereat Rosamund hid her face with her hands and sighed.
</p><p>"And what of Godwin, my brother?" cried Wulf; but no answer was
given him.
</p><p>Now Rosamund turned; stretching out her arms towards Wulf, she
fell upon his breast. There, then, in the presence of that
countless army, they kissed their kiss of betrothal and farewell.
They spoke no word, only ere she went Rosamund lifted her hand
and pointed upwards to the sky.
</p><p>Then a murmur rose from the multitude, and the sound of it seemed
to shape itself into one word: "Mercy!"
</p><p>Still Saladin made no sign, and they were led away to their
prisons.
</p><p>Among the thousands who watched this strange and most thrilling
scene were two men wrapped in long cloaks, Godwin and the bishop
Egbert. Thrice did Godwin strive to approach the throne. But it
seemed that the soldiers about him had their commands, for they
would not suffer him to stir or speak; and when, as Rosamund
passed, he strove to break a way to her, they seized and held
him. Yet as she went by he cried:
</p><p>"The blessing of Heaven be upon you, pure saint of God--on you
and your true knight."
</p><p>Catching the tones of that voice above the tumult, Rosamund
stopped and looked around her, but saw no one, for the guard
hemmed her in. So she went on, wondering if perchance it was
Godwin's voice which she had heard, or whether an angel, or only
some Frankish prisoner had spoken.
</p><p>Godwin stood wringing his hands while the bishop strove to
comfort him, saying that he should not grieve, since such deaths
as those of Rosamund and Wulf were most glorious, and more to be
desired than a hundred lives.
</p><p>"Ay, ay," answered Godwin, "would that I could go with them!"
</p><p>"Their work is done, but not yours," said the bishop gently.
"Come to our tent and let us to our knees. God is more powerful
than the Sultan, and mayhap He will yet find a way to save them.
If they are still alive tomorrow at the dawn we will seek
audience of Saladin to plead with him."
</p><p>So they entered the tent and prayed there, as the inhabitants of
Jerusalem prayed behind their shattered walls, that the heart of
Saladin might be moved to spare them all. While they knelt thus
the curtain of the tent was drawn aside, and an emir stood before
them.
</p><p>"Rise," he said, "both of you, and follow me. The Sultan commands
your presence."
</p><p>Egbert and Godwin went, wondering, and were led through the
pavilion to the royal sleeping place, which guards closed behind
them. On a silken couch reclined Saladin, the light from the lamp
falling on his bronzed and thoughtful face.
</p><p>"I have sent for you two Franks," he said, "that you may bear a
message from me to Sir Balian of Ibelin and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem. This is the message:--Let the holy city surrender
to-morrow and all its population acknowledge themselves my
prisoners. Then for forty days I will hold them to ransom, during
which time none shall be harmed. Every man who pays ten pieces of
gold shall go free, and two women or ten children shall be
counted as one man at a like price. Of the poor, seven thousand
shall be set free also, on payment of thirty thousand bezants.
Such who remain or have no money for their ransom--and there is
still much gold in Jerusalem--shall become my slaves. These are
my terms, which I grant at the dying prayer of my niece, the lady
Rosamund, and to her prayer alone. Deliver them to Sir Balian,
and bid him wait on me at the dawn with his chief notables, and
answer whether he is willing to accept them on behalf of the
people. If not, the assault goes on until the city is a heap of
ruins covering the bones of its children."
</p><p>"We bless you for this mercy," said the bishop Egbert, "and we
hasten to obey. But tell us, Sultan, what shall we do? Return to
the camp with Sir Balian?"
</p><p>"If he accepts my terms, nay, for in Jerusalem you will be safe,
and I give you your freedom without ransom."
</p><p>"Sire," said Godwin, "ere I go, grant me leave to bid farewell to
my brother and my cousin Rosamund."
</p><p>"That for the third time you may plot their escape from my
vengeance?" said Saladin. "Nay, bide in Jerusalem and await my
word; you shall meet them at the last, no more."
</p><p>"Sire," pleaded Godwin, "of your mercy spare them, for they have
played a noble part. It is hard that they should die who love
each other and are so young and fair and brave."
</p><p>"Ay," answered Saladin, "a noble part; never have I seen one more
noble. Well, it fits them the better for heaven, if
Cross-worshippers enter there. Have done; their doom is written
and my purpose cannot be turned, nor shall you see them till the
last, as I have said. But if it pleases you to write them a
letter of farewell and to send it back by the embassy, it shall
be delivered to them. Now go, for greater matters are afoot than
this punishment of a pair of lovers. A guard awaits you."
</p><p>So they went, and within an hour stood before Sir Balian and gave
him the message of Saladin, whereat he rose and blessed the name
of Rosamund. While he called his counsellors from their sleep and
bade his servants saddle horses, Godwin found pen and parchment,
and wrote hurriedly:
</p><p>"To Wulf, my brother, and Rosamund, my cousin and his
betrothed,--I live, though well-nigh I died by dead
Masouda--Jesus rest her gallant and most beloved soul! Saladin
will not suffer me to see you, though he has promised that I
shall be with you at the last, so watch for me then. I still dare
to hope that it may please God to change the Sultan's heart and
spare you. If so, this is my prayer and desire--that you two
should wed as soon as may be, and get home to England, where, if
I live, I hope to visit you in years to come. Till then seek me
not, who would be lonely a while. But if it should be fated
otherwise, then when my sins are purged I will seek you among the
saints, you who by your noble deed have earned the sure grace of
God.
</p><p>"The embassy rides. I have no time for more, though there is much
to say. Farewell.--Godwin."
</p><p>The terms of Saladin had been accepted. With rejoicing because
their lives were spared, but with woe and lamentation because the
holy city had fallen again into the hands of the Moslem, the
people of Jerusalem made ready to leave the streets and seek new
homes elsewhere. The great golden cross was torn from the mosque
el-Aksa, and on every tower and wall floated the yellow banners
of Saladin. All who had money paid their ransoms, and those who
had none begged and borrowed it as they could, and if they could
not, gave themselves over to despair and slavery. Only the
patriarch Heraclius, forgetting the misery of these wretched
ones, carried off his own great wealth and the gold plate of the
churches.
</p><p>Then Saladin showed his mercy, for he freed all the aged without
charge, and from his own treasure paid the ransom of hundreds of
ladies whose husbands and fathers had fallen in battle, or lay in
prison in other cities.
</p><p>So for forty days, headed by Queen Sybilla and her ladies, that
sad procession of the vanquished marched through the gates, and
there were many of them who, as they passed the conqueror seated
in state, halted to make a prayer to him for those who were left
behind. A few also who remembered Rosamund, and that it was
because of her sacrifice that they continued to look upon the
sun, implored him that if they were not already dead, he would
spare her and her brave knight.
</p><p>At length it was over, and Saladin took possession of the city.
Having purged the Great Mosque, washing it with rose-water, he
worshipped in it after his own fashion, and distributed the
remnant of the people who could pay no ransom as slaves among his
emirs and followers. Thus did the Crescent triumph aver the Cross
in Jerusalem, not in a sea of blood, as ninety years before the
Cross had triumphed over the Crescent within its walls, but with
what in those days passed for gentleness, peace, and mercy.
</p><p>For it was left to the Saracens to teach something of their own
doctrines to the followers of Christ.
</p><p>During all those forty days Rosamund and Wulf lay in their
separate prisons, awaiting their doom of death. The letter of
Godwin was brought to Wulf, who read it and rejoiced to learn
that his brother lived. Then it was taken from him to Rosamund,
who, although she rejoiced also, wept over it, and wondered a
little what it might mean. Of one thing she was sure from its
wording--that they had no hope of life.
</p><p>They knew that Jerusalem had fallen, for they heard the shouts of
triumph of the Moslems, and from far away, through their prison
bars could see the endless multitude of fugitives passing the
ancient gates laden with baggage, and leading their children by
the hand, to seek refuge in the cities of the coast. At this
sight, although it was so sad, Rosamund was happy, knowing also
that now she would not suffer in vain.
</p><p>At length the camp broke up, Saladin and many of the soldiers
entering Jerusalem; but still the pair were left languishing in
their dismal cells, which were fashioned from old tombs. One
evening, while Rosamund was kneeling; at prayer before she sought
her bed, the door of the place was opened, and there appeared a
glittering captain and a guard of soldiers, who saluted her and
bade her follow him.
</p><p>"Is it the end?" she asked.
</p><p>"Lady," he answered, "it is the end." So she bowed her head
meekly and followed. Without a litter was ready, in which they
placed her and bore her through the bright moonlight into the
city of Jerusalem and along the Way of Sorrow, till they halted
at a great door, which she knew again, for by it stood the
ancient arch.
</p><p>"They have brought me back to the Convent of the Holy Cross to
kill me where I asked that I might be buried," she murmured to
herself as she descended from the litter.
</p><p>Then the doors were thrown open, and she entered the great
courtyard of the convent, and saw that it was decorated as though
for a festival, for about it and in the cloisters round hung many
lamps. More; these cloisters and the space in front of them were
crowded with Saracen lords, wearing their robes of state, while
yonder sat Saladin and his court.
</p><p>"They would make a brave show of my death," thought Rosamund
again. Then a little cry broke from her lips, for there, in front
of the throne of Saladin, the moonlight and the lamp-blaze
shining on his armour, stood a tall Christian knight. At that cry
he turned his head, and she grew sure that it was Wulf, wasted
somewhat and grown pale, but still Wulf.
</p><p>"So we are to die together," she whispered to herself, then
walked forward with a proud step amidst the deep silence, and,
having bowed to Saladin, took the hand of Wulf and held it.
</p><p>The Sultan looked at them and said:
</p><p>"However long it may be delayed, the day of fate must break at
last. Say, Franks, are you prepared to drink the dregs of that
cup I promised you?"
</p><p>"We are prepared," they answered with one voice.
</p><p>"Do you grieve now that you laid down your lives to save those of
all Jerusalem?" he asked again.
</p><p>"Nay," Rosamund answered, glancing at Wulf's face; "we rejoice
exceedingly that God has been so good to us."
</p><p>"I too rejoice," said Saladin; "and I too thank Allah Who in
bygone days sent me that vision which has given me back the holy
city of Jerusalem without bloodshed. Now all is accomplished as
it was fated. Lead them away."
</p><p>For a moment they clung together, then emirs took Wulf to the
right and Rosamund to the left, and she went with a pale face and
high head to meet her executioner, wondering if she would see
Godwin ere she died. They led her to a chamber where women waited
but no swordsman that she could see, and shut the door upon her.
</p><p>"Perchance I am to be strangled by these women," thought
Rosamund, as they came towards her, "so that the blood royal may
not be shed."
</p><p>Yet it was not so, for with gentle hands, but in silence, they
unrobed her, and washed her with scented waters and braided her
hair, twisting it up with pearls and gems. Then they clad her in
fine linen, and put over it gorgeous, broidered garments, and a
royal mantle of purple, and her own jewels which she had worn in
bygone days, and with them others still more splendid, and threw
about her head a gauzy veil worked with golden stars. It was just
such a veil as Wulf's gift which she had worn on the night when
Hassan dragged her from her home at Steeple. She noted it and
smiled at the sad omen, then said:
</p><p>"Ladies, why should I mock my doom with these bright garments?"
</p><p>"It is the Sultan's will," they answered; "nor shall you rest
to-night less happily because of them."
</p><p>Now all was ready, and the door opened and she stepped through
it, a radiant thing, glittering in the lamplight. Then trumpets
blew and a herald cried: "Way! Way there! Way for the high
sovereign lady and princess of Baalbec!"
</p><p>Thus followed by the train of honourable women who attended her,
Rosamund glided forward to the courtyard, and once more bent the
knee to Saladin, then stood still, lost in wonder.
</p><p>Again the trumpets blew, and on the right a herald cried, "Way!
Way there! Way for the brave and noble Frankish knight, Sir Wulf
D'Arcy!"
</p><p>Lo! attended by emirs and notables, Wulf came forth, clad in
splendid armour inlaid with gold, wearing on his shoulder a
mantel set with gems and on his breast the gleaming Star of the
Luck of Hassan. To Rosamund he strode and stood by her, his hands
resting on the hilt of his long sword.
</p><p>"Princess," said Saladin, "I give you back your rank and titles,
because you have shown a noble heart; and you, Sir Wulf, I honour
also as best I may, but to my decree I hold. Let them go together
to the drinking of the cup of their destiny as to a bridal bed."
</p><p>Again the trumpets blew and the heralds called, and they led them
to the doors of the chapel, which at their knocking were thrown
wide. From within came the sound of women's voices singing, but
it was no sad song they sang.
</p><p>"The sisters of the Order are still there," said Rosamund to
Wulf, "and would cheer us on our road to heaven."
</p><p>"Perchance," he answered. "I know not. I am amazed."
</p><p>At the door the company of Moslems left them, but they crowded
round the entrance as though to watch what passed. Now down the
long aisle walked a single whiterobed figure. It was the abbess.
</p><p>"What shall we do, Mother?" said Rosamund to her.
</p><p>"Follow me, both of you," she said, and they followed her through
the nave to the altar rails, and at a sign from her knelt down.
</p><p>Now they saw that on either side of the altar stood a Christian
priest. The priest to the right--it was the bishop Egbert--came
forward and began to read over them the marriage service of their
faith.
</p><p>"They'd wed us ere we die," whispered Rosamund to Wulf.
</p><p>"So be it," he answered; "I am glad."
</p><p>"And I also, beloved," she whispered back.
</p><p>The service went on--as in a dream, the service went on, while
the white-robed sisters sat in their carven chairs and watched.
The rings that were handed to them had been interchanged; Wulf
had taken Rosamund to wife, Rosamund had taken Wulf to husband,
till death did them part.
</p><p>Then the old bishop withdrew to the altar, and another hooded
monk came forward and uttered over them the benediction in a deep
and sonorous voice, which stirred their hearts most strangely, as
though some echo reached them from beyond the grave. He held his
hands above them in blessing and looked upwards, so that his hood
fell back, and the light of the altar lamp fell upon his face.
</p><p>It was the face of Godwin, and on his head was the tonsure of a
monk.
</p><p>Once more they stood before Saladin, and now their train was
swelled by the abbess and sisters of the Holy Cross.
</p><p>"Sir Wulf D'Arcy," said the Sultan, "and you, Rosamund, my niece,
princess of Baalbec, the dregs of your cup, sweet or bitter, or
bitter-sweet, are drunk; the doom which I decreed for you is
accomplished, and, according to your own rites, you are man and
wife till Allah sends upon you that death which I withhold.
Because you showed mercy upon those doomed to die and were the
means of mercy, I also give you mercy, and with it my love and
honour. Now bide here if you will in my freedom, and enjoy your
rank and wealth, or go hence if you will, and live out your lives
across the sea. The blessing of Allah be upon you, and turn your
souls light. This is the decree of Yusuf Salah-ed-din, Commander
of the Faithful, Conqueror and Caliph of the East."
</p><p>Trembling, full of joy and wonder, they knelt before him and
kissed his hand. Then, after a few swift words between them,
Rosamund spoke.
</p><p>"Sire, that God whom you have invoked, the God of Christian and
of Moslem, the God of all the world, though the world worship Him
in many ways and shapes, bless and reward you for this royal
deed. Yet listen to our petition. It may be that many of our
faith still lie unransomed in Jerusalem. Take my lands and gems,
and let them be valued, and their price given to pay for the
liberty of some poor slaves. It is our marriage offering. As for
us, we will get us to our own country."
</p><p>"So be it," answered Saladin. "The lands I will take and devote
the sum of them as you desire--yes, to the last bezant. The
jewels also shall be valued, but I give them back to you as my
wedding dower. To these nuns further I grant permission to bide
here in Jerusalem to nurse the Christian sick, unharmed and
unmolested, if so they will, and this because they sheltered you.
Ho! minstrels and heralds lead this new-wed pair to the place
that has been prepared for them."
</p><p>Still trembling and bewildered, they turned to go, when lo!
Godwin stood before them smiling, and kissed them both upon the
cheek, calling them "Beloved brother and sister."
</p><p>"And you, Godwin?" stammered Rosamund.
</p><p>"I, Rosamund, have also found my bride, and she is named the
Church of Christ."
</p><p>"Do you, then, return to England, brother?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"Nay," Godwin answered, in a fierce whisper and with flashing
eyes, "the Cross is down, but not forever. That Cross has Richard
of England and many another servant beyond the seas, and they
will come at the Church's call. Here, brother, before all is
done, we may meet again in war. Till then, farewell."
</p><p>So spoke Godwin and then was gone.
