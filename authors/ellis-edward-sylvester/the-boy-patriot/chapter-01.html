<p>Were you ever on the coast of Maine? If so, you know how the
rocky shores stretch out now and then clear into the ocean, and
fret the salt waves till they are all in a foam. Old Ocean is
not to be so set at defiance and have his rightful territory wrung
from him, without taking his revenge after his own fashion. Far
up into the land he sends his arms, and crooks and bends and makes
his way amid the rocks, and finally falls asleep in some quiet
harbor, where the tall pines stand by the shore to sing him a
lullaby.</p>

<p>In just such a spot as this the town we shall call Fairport was
built. Axe in one hand and Bible in the other, stern settlers
here found a home. Strong hard-featured sons, and fair rosy-cheeked
daughters made glad the rude cabins that were soon scattered along
the shore. The axe was plied in the woods, and the needle by the
fireside, and yet grim Poverty was ever shaking her fist in the
very faces of the settlers, and whispering sad things of what
the uncertain future might have in store for them.</p>

<p>Cheerily they bore the hardships of the present hour, and a deaf
ear they turned to all such whispers. Yet those settlers were
sensible, matter-of-fact men; and it was soon plain to them, that
healthful as were the breezes that made so rosy the cheeks of
their daughters, Fairport was not the very best site in the world
for a settlement, at least if its people were to depend on the
thin and rocky soil won from the forest, which scarcely produced
the bare necessaries of life.</p>

<p>Was Fairport given up in despair? No, no. Her settlers were not
the men to be so daunted and foiled. If the land was unkindly,
they could take to the water; and so they did, to a man. Some
were off to the Newfoundland Banks, tossing about the codfish,
and piling them up into stacks that were more profitable than
any hay of their own raising. Some were on board swift vessels,
doing a good share of the carrying trade between the West Indies
and the New England cities. Some were seeking the whale far in
the northern seas; while others, less enterprising, were content
to fish nearer home for all sorts of eatable dwellers in the sea,
from halibut to herring.</p>

<p>Now a new day had begun for Fairport. The original cabins began
to tower in the air or encroach on the submissive gardens, as
building after building was added by the prosperous owners. Miniature
villas, with a wealth of useless piazzas, appeared in the neighborhood
of the town, and substantial wharves bordered one side of the
quiet harbor, and gave a welcome to the shipping that seemed to
grow and cluster there like the trees of a forest.</p>

<p>Fairport had passed the struggles of its early youth when our
story begins, though there were gray-haired citizens yet within
its borders who could tell how the bears had once looked in at
their cabin windows, and the pine-trees had stood thick in what
was now the main street of the rising town.</p>
