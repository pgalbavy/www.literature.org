<p>All the next day, and the next, Mary watched the door and on the
morning of the third Rimrock came.  From motives of prudence the badly
shaken Jepson had suggested that she see him first and she had
consented with an understanding smile.  He slipped in quietly, glancing
furtively around, and then looked at her coldly in the eye.
</p><p>"Well," he said with an accusing smile, "I see you sold out to
Stoddard, too."
</p><p>She turned away wearily and, picking up a letter, laid it down on the
counter before him.
</p><p>"There's a notice," she said as if she had not heard him, "that I've
been asked to turn over to you."
</p><p>He glanced at it impatiently and then, confused by its verbiage, looked
up with a questioning scowl.
</p><p>"What's all this?" he asked.  And then, in a louder tone: "Where'd you
get this paper?"
</p><p>"It was sent to me," she answered, "as secretary of the Company.  But
it's only a matter of form.  When you left New York a general summons
was published in a legal paper and in ninety days you will have to
appear or lose your stock by default."
</p><p>"Uhr!  Pretty nice!" he sneered, and came in and sat down in a chair.
"Pretty nice!" he repeated as he took off his hat and glanced around
the room, "you must've known I was coming.  What's the matter?" he
burst out as she made no answer, "can't you hear, or don't you care?"
</p><p>"I can hear," she replied categorically, "and I don't care."
</p><p>"Oh!  Like the rest of 'em, hey?  Got no use for me, now.  And so I'm
summoned to appear in court?  I come back home and the first thing you
shove at me is this here little notice."  He drummed on a desk with the
rolled-up paper, but as she sighed he changed his tone.  "Well, well,"
he said, "you've got things all changed since Rimrock was here before."
</p><p>"Yes," she answered with her old-time pleasantness.  "Mr. Jepson did
it.  I found it like this myself."
</p><p>"'S that so?" observed Rimrock and gazed at her curiously.  "How long
ago was that?"
</p><p>"Oh, back in November.  It was about the twentieth.  I came to send out
the notices."
</p><p>"Oh!  Ah, yes!  For the annual meeting.  Well, you put a crimp in me
then.  Just by passing that dividend you dropped me so flat that I lost
every dollar I had."
</p><p>"Very likely," she observed with no sign of regret, "but you should
have attended the meeting."
</p><p>"Attended the meeting!" he repeated angrily.  "I had something else to
do!  But is that any excuse for stopping my dividend and leaving me for
Stoddard to clean?"
</p><p>"If you had come to the meeting," she responded evenly, but with an
answering fire in her eyes, "and explained that you needed the money, I
might have voted differently.  As it was I voted for the smelter."
</p><p>"The smelter?"
</p><p>"Why, yes!  Didn't you get my letter?  We're going to build a smelter."
</p><p>"Oh, my Lord!" raved Rimrock, "did you let them fool you on that old,
whiskered dodge?  Sure I got your letter--but I never read it--the
first few lines were enough!  When I saw that you'd sold me out to
Stoddard and gone and passed that dividend----"  He paused--"Say,
what's the matter?"
</p><p>She had forgotten at last her studied calm and was staring at him with
startled eyes.
</p><p>"Why--didn't you read about Ike Bray?"
</p><p>"Ike Bray!  Why, no; what's the matter with Ike?  I just came in--on
the freight."
</p><p>"Then you don't know that your claim has been jumped, and----"
</p><p>"<u>Jumped</u>!" yelled Rimrock, rising suddenly to his feet and making a
clutch for his gun.
</p><p>"Yes--jumped!  The Old Juan claim!  The assessment work was never done."
</p><p>"Uh!" grunted Rimrock and sank back into his chair as if he had
received a blow.  "Not done?" he wailed staggering wildly up again.
"My--God!  Did L. W. go back on me, too?  Didn't Hassayamp or anybody
just think to go out there and see that the holes were sunk?  Oh, my
Lord; but this is awful!"
</p><p>"Yes, it is," she said, "but it wouldn't have happened if you had come
out here yourself.  And if you'd just read my letter instead of
throwing it down the minute it didn't happen to please----"  She
stopped and winked back the angry tears that threatened to betray her
hurt.  "But now go on, and blame me for this--you blame me for
everything else!  Curse and swear and ask me what I was doing when all
this came to pass!  Ah, you expect more of others, Mr. Rimrock Jones,
than you ever do of yourself; and now it will be me or poor L. W. that
will come in for all the----"
</p><p>She broke down completely and buried her face in her arms while Rimrock
stood staring like a fool.  He was stunned, astounded; put beyond the
power to listen, or reason, or think.  All he knew was that some time,
when he was away and while no one was there to befriend, Ike Bray his
enemy had climbed up the butte and jumped the Old Juan claim.  And all
the time he was dallying in New York and playing his puny string at
Navajoa the Old Juan claim and the mighty Tecolote had been left
unguarded until they were jumped.
</p><p>"Where's L. W.?" he asked, coming suddenly from his trance; and she was
sitting there, dry-eyed as before.
</p><p>"He's gone to the hospital.  Bray shot him through the arm in a quarrel
over the claim."
</p><p>"What?  Shot L.W.?  Well, the little shrimp!  Just wait till I get to
him with this!"
</p><p>He tapped his pistol and a wry, cynical smile came over her
tear-stained face.
</p><p>"Yes!  Wait!" she mocked.  "You'll be a long time waiting.  He's under
the protection of the court.  No, you can put up that pistol and never
miss it--this case will be tried by law."
</p><p>"Well, we'll see about that," he answered significantly.  "I've got a
look-in on this, myself."
</p><p>"No, I don't think you have," she responded firmly.  "The claim was the
property of the Company."
</p><p>"Well, what of that?"
</p><p>"Why, only this, that the case is out of your hands.  Ike Bray has
disappeared, the claim is recorded, and only the Company can sue."
</p><p>"What, do you mean to say that when my claim is jumped I can't begin
suit to get it back?"
</p><p>"Why, certainly.  You have transferred that claim to the Company."
</p><p>"Well, why didn't Jepson do that work?  Do you mean to say that that
high-priced man, getting his twenty-five thousand a year, deliberately
sat down and let that assessment work lapse and then let Ike Bray jump
it?"
</p><p>"Yes," she nodded, "that's it."
</p><p>"But----"  He stopped and a wave of sudden intelligence swept the
passion from his face.
</p><p>"It's Stoddard!" he said and once more she nodded, then waited with an
understanding smile.
</p><p>"Yes, it's Stoddard," she said.  "But of course we can't prove it.  Mr.
Bray has already begun suit."
</p><p>"What, suit to dispossess us?  Does he claim the whole works?  Well,
there must be somebody behind him.  You don't think it could be--what?
Well, doesn't that--beat----"
</p><p>"Yes, it does!" she cut in hastily.  "The whole thing has been very
carefully thought out."
</p><p>He slapped his leg and, rising from his chair, paced restlessly to and
fro.
</p><p>"How'd you know all this?" he demanded at last and something in the
nagging, overbearing way he said it woke the smouldering fires of her
hate.
</p><p>"Mr. Jones," she said rising up to face him, "we might as well
understand each other right now.  From the very first you have taken it
for granted that I have sold you out.  You don't need to deny it,
because you have used those very words--but please don't do it again.
And please don't speak to me in that tone of voice, as if I had done
you some great wrong.  <u>You</u> are the one that has done <u>me</u> a wrong and
I assure you, I will never forget.  But from this time on, if you want
anything of me, please ask for it like a gentleman.  Now what do you
want to know?"
</p><p>"I want to know," began Rimrock slowly and then he broke down and smote
the desk.  "You have too sold me out!" he exploded in a fury, "you
have--I don't care what you say!  You stood in with Stoddard to pass
that dividend and, by grab, you can't deny it!  If you'd voted with L.
W.----"
</p><p>"Very well!" returned Mary in a tone that silenced him, "I see that you
don't wish to be friends.  And I want to tell you, in parting, that you
expect a constancy from women that you signally lack yourself.  I will
send Mr. Jepson down to be sworn at."
</p><p>When Jepson, pale and anxious, sidled warily into the office he found
Rimrock sitting thoughtfully in a chair.  Some time had passed, for
Jepson's wife had delayed him, but time alone could not account for the
change.  Rimrock was more than quiet, he was subdued; but when he
looked up there was another change.  In Abercrombie Jepson he saw,
without question, the tool and servitor of Stoddard, the man who had
engineered his downfall.  And Jepson's smile as he came forward
doubtfully--but with the frank, open manner he affected--was sickly and
jaundiced with fear.  It was a terrible position that he found himself
placed in and his wife was crying, upstairs.
</p><p>"Ah, good morning, Mr. Jepson," said Rimrock pleasantly and put his
hand behind his back.
</p><p>"Good morning," returned Jepson, drawing in a deep breath, "is there
anything I can do?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Rimrock coldly.  "I've been away for some time.  I'd like
to know what's going on.  You'll excuse me, Mr. Jepson, if I ask you a
few questions about the jumping of the Old Juan claim."
</p><p>"Ah, yes, yes," spoke up Jepson briskly, "very regrettable case, I'm
sure.  But you must remember, if you'll pardon my mentioning it, that I
spoke of this possibility before.  The Old Juan claim, as I told you at
the time, placed our entire property in jeopardy.  It should have been
re-located before all this had happened; but I have turned over the
whole affair to our attorneys, McVicker and Ord."
</p><p>"And what do they think?"
</p><p>"Well, as to that, I can't say.  You see, I have really been
frightfully busy.  Still, they are a very good firm and I think very
likely the affair can somehow be compromised.  Looks very bad for the
Company, as far as the law goes, if you should ask my private opinion;
but all such litigation, while of course very expensive, generally
results, in the end, in a compromise."
</p><p>"Oh, a compromise, eh?  Well, sit down a minute; I want to find out a
few details.  Do you think now, for instance, that Whitney H. Stoddard
is back of this man, Ike Bray?  Because if he is, and their claim is a
good one, it might make some difference to me."
</p><p>He said this so naturally and with such apparent resignation that
Jepson almost rose to the bait, but he had learned Rimrock's ways too
well.  Such an admission as that, if made before the trial, might
seriously affect Stoddard's case.  And besides, this was a matter for
lawyers.
</p><p>"Well, as to that, Mr. Jones," he replied apologetically, "I really
cannot say.  As superintendent of the mine, and lately as acting
manager, I am fully occupied, I am sure----"
</p><p>"Yes, no doubt," observed Rimrock, suddenly changing his tone, "but
you've got more time, now--I'll take that manager job off your hands."
</p><p>"What?  Take charge of the mine again?" cried Jepson aghast.  "Why, I
thought----"
</p><p>"Very likely," returned Rimrock, "but guess again.  I'm still general
manager, unless the Directors have fired me; and believe me, I'm going
to take charge.  In the next few days I'm going to go through this
office with a six-shooter and a fine-tooth comb and if I find a single
dollar paid out to Ike Bray some ex-manager is liable to get shot.  You
understand that, now don't you, Mr. Jepson?  All right then; we can go
ahead.  Now will you kindly tell me how, as general manager and mine
superintendent, and being worried so much over that claim, you came to
let the ordinary assessment work lapse on the apex claim to our mine?"
</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and put one hand in his pocket and Jepson
broke into a sweat.  It is no easy task for a man to serve two masters,
and Rimrock had exposed a heavy pistol.
</p><p>"Well--why, really!" burst out Jepson in desperation, "I thought you
had entrusted that to Mr. Lockhart.  He told me so, distinctly, when I
spoke of it in your absence, and naturally I let the matter drop."
</p><p>"Yes, naturally," drawled Rimrock and as he reached for his
handkerchief Jepson started and almost ran.  "You're a great man,
Jepson," he went on cuttingly, "a great little piece of mechanism.  Now
come through--what does Stoddard want?"
</p><p>"Mr. Jones," began Jepson in his most earnest manner, "I give you my
word of honor I don't know of what you are speaking."
</p><p>"Oh, all right," answered Rimrock, "if that's the way you feel about
it.  You stand pat then, and pull the injured innocence?  But you're
not much good at it, Jepson; nothing like some people he has working
for him.  That fellow Buckbee is a corker.  You're too honest, Jepson;
you can't act the part, but Buckbee could do it to perfection.  You
should've been there to see him trim me, when I tried that little flier
in Navajoa.  Not an unkind word ever passed between us, and yet he
busted me down to a dollar.  He was a great fellow--you ought to know
him--you could take a few leaves from his book.
</p><p>"But here's the proposition as I look at it, Jepson," went on Rimrock
with an ingratiating smile, "you're supposed to be strictly on the
square.  You're a solid, substantial, mining engineer, chiefly
interested in holding your job.  But on the side, as I happen to know,
you're doing all this dirty work for Stoddard.  Now--as general
manager, if I did my duty, I ought to fire you on the spot; but I'm
going to give you a chance.  So I'll make you an offer and you can take
it or leave it.  If you'll recognize my authority as general manager
and tell me what I'm entitled to know, I'll leave you where you are;
but if you don't I'll not only fire you, but I'll run you out of town.
Now how about it--ain't I the legal manager of this Company?"
</p><p>"Why--why, yes, Mr. Jones," stammered Jepson abjectly, "as far as that
goes, I'm sure no one will object.  Of course it was understood,
between Mr. Stoddard and me, when you went East a year ago----"
</p><p>"Yes, all right, Mr. Jepson," interrupted Rimrock easily, "now how much
money have we got?"
</p><p>"Why, as to that," began Jepson his eyes opening wider, "there is quite
a sum in the bank.  Some three millions, altogether, but the most of
that is set aside for the construction of the smelter."
</p><p>"Ah, yes!  Exactly!  But that was set aside before the Old Juan claim
was jumped.  A smelter's no good now, if we're going to lose our
mine--it would be just like making a present of it to Ike Bray."
</p><p>"Oh, but my dear Mr. Jones!" burst out Jepson in dismay, "you surely
wouldn't stop the smelter now?"
</p><p>"Well, I don't know why not," answered Rimrock briefly.  "Don't you
think so now, yourself?"
</p><p>He gazed at his superintendent with an unwinking smile and Jepson bowed
his head.
</p><p>"Oh, very well, sir," he said with a touch of servility, "but Mr.
Stoddard will be greatly put out."
</p><p>"You're working for me!" spoke up Rimrock sharply, "and we'll spend
that money for something else."
</p><p>"Spend it?"
</p><p>"Yes, for lawyers!  I hate the whole outfit--they're a bunch of lousy
crooks--but we'll see if money don't talk.  I'm going to hire, Jepson,
every lawyer in this Territory that's competent to practice in the
courts.  Now look at it fairly, as a business proposition; would it be
right to do anything else?  Here's a copper property that you could
sell to-morrow for a hundred million dollars gold, and the apex claim
is jumped.  The whole title to the mine is tied up right there--they
can claim every shovelful you mine, and your mill and your smelter to
boot.  What kind of a business man would I be if I left this to
McVicker and Ord?  No, I'm going to send to San Francisco, and Denver,
and Butte, and retain every mining attorney I can get.  It's the only
thing to do; but listen, my friend, I'm not going to tell anybody but
you.  So if Stoddard finds this out, or McVicker and Ord, or whatever
blackleg lawyers Ike Bray has, I'll just know where to go.  And one
thing more--if I find you've split on me, I'll kill you like a
Mexican's dog."
</p><p>He rose up slowly and looked Jepson in the eye with glance that held
him cold.
</p><p>"Very well, sir," he said as he started to his feet.  "And now, if
you'll excuse me----"
</p><p>"All right," nodded Rimrock and as he watched him pass out he gave way
to a cynical smile.
</p><p>"Good enough!" he said.  "They can all go back on me, but there's one
man I know I can trust!"
