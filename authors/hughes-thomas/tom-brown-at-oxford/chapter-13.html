<p>"What's the time, Smith?"</p>

<p>"Half-past three, old fellow," answered Diogenes, looking at
his watch.</p>

<p>"I never knew a day go so slowly," said Tom; "isn't it time to
go down to the boats?"</p>

<p>"Not by two hours and more, old fellow&mdash;can't you take a book,
or something to keep you quiet? You won't be fit for anything
by six o'clock, if you go on worrying like this." And so Diogenes
turned himself to his flute, and blew away to all appearances
as composedly as if it had been the first week of term, though,
if the truth must be told, it was all he could do not to get up
and wander about in a feverish and distracted state, for Tom's
restlessness infected him.</p>

<p>Diogenes' whole heart was in the college boat; and so, though
he had pulled dozens of races in his time, he was almost as nervous
as a freshman on this the first day of the races. Tom, all unconscious
of the secret discomposure of the other, threw himself into a
chair and looked at him with wonder and envy. The flute went "toot,
toot, toot," till he could stand it no longer. So he got up and
went to the window, and, leaning out, looked up and down the street
for some minutes in a purposeless sort of fashion, staring hard
at everybody and everything, but unconscious all the time that
he was doing so. He would not have been able in fact, to answer
Diogenes a word, had not that worthy inquired of him what he had
seen, when he presently drew in his head and returned to his fidgety
ramblings about the room.</p>

<p>"How hot the sun is! but there's a stiff breeze from the south-east.
I hope it will go down before the evening, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this wind will make it very rough below the Gut. Mind you
feather high now at starting."</p>

<p>"I hope to goodness I sha'n't catch a crab," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Don't think about it, old fellow; that's your best plan."</p>

<p>"But I can't think of anything else," said Tom. "What the deuce
is the good of telling a fellow not to think about it?"</p>

<p>Diogenes apparently had nothing particular to reply, for he put
his flute to his mouth again; and at the sound of the "toot, toot"
Tom caught up his gown and fled into the quadrangle.</p>

<p>The crew had had their early dinner of steaks and chops, stale
bread, and a glass and a half of old beer a piece at two o'clock,
in the Captain's rooms. The current theory of training at that
time was&mdash;as much meat as you could eat, the more underdone the
better, and the smallest amount of drink upon which you could
manage to live. Two pints in the twenty-four hours was all that
most boat's crews that pretended to train at all were allowed,
and for the last fortnight it had been the nominal allowance of
the St. Ambrose crew. The discomfort of such a diet in the hot
summer months, when you were at the same time taking regular and
violent exercise, was something very serious. Outraged human nature
rebelled against it; and though they did not admit it in public,
there were very few men who did not rush to their water bottles
for relief, more or less often, according to the development of
their bumps of conscientiousness and obstinacy. To keep to the
diet at all strictly involved a very respectable amount of physical
endurance. Our successors have found out the unwisdom of this,
as of other old superstitions; and that in order to get a man
into training for a boat-race now-a-days, it is not of the first
importance to keep him in a constant state of consuming thirst,
and the restlessness of body and sharpness of temper which thirst
generally induces.</p>

<p>Tom appreciated the honor of being in the boat in his first year
so keenly, that he had almost managed to keep to his training
allowance, and consequently, now that the eventful day had arrived,
was in a most uncomfortable frame of body and disagreeable frame
of mind.</p>

<p>He fled away from Diogenes' flute, but found no rest. He tried
Drysdale. That hero was lying on his back on his sofa playing
with Jack, and only increased Tom's thirst and soured his temper
by the viciousness of his remarks on boating, and everything and
person connected therewith; above all, on Miller, who had just
come up, had steered them the day before, and pronounced the crew
generally, and Drysdale in particular, "not half trained."</p>

<p>Blake's oak was sported, as usual. Tom looked in at the Captain's
door, but found him hard at work reading, and so carried himself
off; and, after a vain hunt after others of the crew, and even
trying to sit down and read, first a novel, then a play of Shakespeare,
with no success whatever, wandered away out of the college, and
found himself in five minutes, by a natural and irresistible attraction,
on the university barge.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen men or so reading the papers, and a group
or two discussing the coming races. Amongst other things the chances
of St. Ambrose's making a bump the first night were weighed. Every
one joining in praising the stroke, but there were great doubts
whether the crew could live up to it. Tom carried himself on to
the top of the barge to get out of hearing, for listening made
his heart beat and his throat drier than ever. He stood on the
top and looked right away down to the Gut, the strong wind blowing
his gown about. Not even a pair oar was to be seen; the great
event of the evening made the river a solitude at this time of
day. Only one or two skiffs were coming home, impelled by reading
men, who took their constitutionals on the water, and were coming
in to be in time for afternoon chapel. The fastest and best of
these soon came near enough for Tom to recognize Hardy's stroke;
so he left the barge and went down to meet the servitor at his
landing, and accompanied him to the St. Ambrose dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you feel for the race to-night?" said Hardy, as
he dried his neck and face, which he had been sluicing with cold
water, looking as hardy and bright as a racer on Derby day.</p>

<p>"Oh, wretched! I'm afraid I shall break down" said Tom, and pouring
out some of his doubts and miseries. Hardy soon comforted him
greatly; and by the time they were half across Christchurch meadow,
he was quite in heart again. For he knew how well Hardy understood
rowing, and what a sound judge he was; and it was therefore cheering
to hear that he thought they were certainly the second best, if
not the best boat on the river; and that they would be sure to
make some bumps unless they had accidents.</p>

<p>"But that's just what I fear so," said Tom. "I'm afraid I shall
make some awful blunder."</p>

<p>"Not you!" said Hardy; "only remember. Don't you fancy you can
pull the boat by yourself, and go to trying to do it. There's
where young oars fail. If you keep thorough good time you'll be
pretty sure to be doing your share of work. Time is everything,
almost."</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to think of that," said Tom; and they entered St.
Ambrose just as the chapel bell was going down; and he went to
chapel and then to hall, sitting by and talking for companionship
while the rest dined.</p>

<p>And so at last the time slipped away, and the Captain and Miller
mustered them at the gates and walked off to the boats. A dozen
other crews were making their way in the same direction, and half
the undergraduates of Oxford streamed along with them. The banks
of the river were crowded; and the punts plied rapidly backwards
and forwards, carrying loads of men over to the Berkshire side.
The university barge, and all the other barges, were decked with
flags, and the band was playing lively airs as the St. Ambrose
crew reached the scene of action.</p>

<p>No time was lost in the dressing-room, and in two minutes they
were all standing in flannel trousers and silk jerseys at the
landing-place.</p>

<p>"You had better keep your jackets on," said the Captain; "we
sha'n't be off yet."</p>

<p>"There goes Brazen-nose."</p>

<p>"They look like work, don't they?"</p>

<p>"The black and yellow seems to slip along so fast. They're no
end of good colors. I wish our new boat was black."</p>

<p>"Hang her colors, if she's only stiff in the back, and don't
dip."</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't dip yesterday; at least, the men on the bank
said so."</p>

<p>"There go Baliol, and Oriel, and University."</p>

<p>"By Jove, we shall be late! Where's Miller?"</p>

<p>"In the shed, getting the boat out. Look, here's Exeter."</p>

<p>The talk of the crew was silenced for the moment as every man
looked eagerly at the Exeter boat. The Captain nodded to Jervis
with a grim smile as they paddled gently by.</p>

<p>Then the talk began again, "How do you think she goes?"</p>

<p>"Not so badly. They're very strong in the middle of the boat."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it; it's all lumber."</p>

<p>"You'll see. They're better trained than we are. They look as
fine as stars."</p>

<p>"So they ought. They've pulled seven miles to our five for the
last month, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Then we sha'n't bump them."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know that the value of products consist in the quantity
of labor which goes to produce them? Product pace over course
from Iffley up. Labor expended, Exeter 7; St. Ambrose, 5. You
see it is not in the nature of things that we should bump them
&mdash;<em>Q.E.D</em>."</p>

<p>"What moonshine! as if ten miles behind their stroke are worth
two behind Jervis!"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, it isn't my moonshine; you must settle the matter
with the philosophers. I only apply a universal law to a particular
case."</p>

<p>Tom, unconscious of the pearls of economic lore which were being
poured out for the benefit of the crew, was watching the Exeter
eight as it glided away towards the Cherwell. He thought they
seemed to keep horribly good time.</p>

<p>"Halloa, Drysdale; look, there's Jack going across in one of
the punts."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. You don't suppose he would go down to see the
race."</p>

<p>"Why won't Miller let us start? Almost all the boats are off."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time. We may just as well be up here as dawdling
about the bank at Iffley."</p>

<p>"We sha'n't go down till the last; Miller never lets us get out
down below."</p>

<p>"Well, come; here's the boat, at last."</p>

<p>The new boat now emerged from its shed, guided steadily to where
they were standing by Miller and the waterman. Then the coxswain
got out and called for bow, who stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Mind how you step now, there are no bottom boards, said Miller.</p>

<p>"Shall I take my jacket?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you had better all go down in jackets in this wind. I've
sent a man down to bring them back. Now two."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" said Drysdale, stepping forward. Then came Tom's
turn, and soon the boat was manned.</p>

<p>"Now," said Miller, taking his place, "are all your stretchers
right?"</p>

<p>"I should like a little more grease on my rollocks."</p>

<p>"I'm taking some down; we'll put it on down below. Are you all
right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then push her off&mdash;gently."</p>

<p>The St. Ambrose boat was almost the last, so there were no punts
in the way, or other obstructions; and they swung steadily down
past the university barge, the top of which was already covered
with spectators. Every man in the boat felt as if the eyes of
Europe were on him, and pulled in his very best form. Small groups
of gownsmen were scattered along the bank in Christchurch meadow,
chiefly dons, who were really interested in the races, but, at
that time of day, seldom liked to display enthusiasm enough to
cross the water and go down to the starting-place. These sombre
groups lighted up here and there by the dresses of a few ladies,
who were walking up and down, and watching the boats. At the mouth
of the Cherwell were moored two punts, in which reclined at their
ease some dozen young gentlemen, smoking; several of these were
friends of Drysdale's, and hailed him as the boat passed.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am to be here!" he grumbled, in an undertone,
casting an envious glance at the punts in their comfortable berth,
up under the banks, and out of the wind. "I say, Brown, don't
you wish we were well past this on the way up?"</p>

<p>"Silence in the bows?" shouted Miller.</p>

<p>"You devil, how I hate you!" growled Drysdale, half in jest and
half in earnest, as they sped along under the willows.</p>

<p>Tom got more comfortable at every stroke, and by the time they
reached the Gut began to hope that he should not have a fit or
lose all his strength just at the start, or cut a crab, or come
to some other unutterable grief, the fear of which had been haunting
him all day.</p>

<p>"Here they are at last!&mdash;come along now&mdash;keep up with them,"
said Hardy to Grey, as the boat neared the Gut; and the two trotted
along downwards, Hardy watching the crew and Grey watching him.</p>

<p>"Hardy, how eager you look!"</p>

<p>"I'd give twenty pounds to be going to pull in the race." Grey
shambled on in silence by the side of his big friend, and wished
he could understand what it was that moved him so.</p>

<p>As the boat shot into the Gut from under the cover of the Oxfordshire
bank, the wind caught the bows.</p>

<p>"Feather high, now," shouted Miller; and then added in a low
voice to the Captain, "It will be ticklish work, starting in this
wind."</p>

<p>"Just as bad for all the other boats," answered the Captain.</p>

<p>"Well said, old philosopher!" said Miller. "It's a comfort to
steer you; you never make a fellow nervous. I wonder if you ever
felt nervous yourself, now?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," said the Captain. "Here's our post; we may as well
turn."</p>

<p>"Easy, bow side&mdash;now two and four, pull her round&mdash;back water,
seven and five!" shouted the coxswain; and the boat's head swung
round, and two or three strokes took her into the bank.</p>

<p>Jack instantly made a convulsive attempt to board, but was sternly
repulsed, and tumbled backwards into the water.</p>

<p>Hark!&mdash;the first gun. The report sent Tom's heart into his mouth
again. Several of the boats pushed off at once into the stream;
and the crowds of men on the bank began to be agitated, as it
were, by the shadow of the coming excitement. The St. Ambrose
crew fingered their oars, put a last dash of grease on their rollocks,
and settled their feet against the stretchers.</p>

<p>"Shall we push her off?" asked "bow."</p>

<p>"No, I can give you another minute," said Miller, who was sitting,
watch in hand, in the stern, "only be smart when I give the word."</p>

<p>The Captain turned on his seat, and looked up the boat. His face
was quiet, but full of confidence, which seemed to pass from him
into the crew. Tom felt calmer and stronger, he met his eye. "Now
mind, boys, don't quicken," he said, cheerily; "four short strokes,
to get way on her, and then steady. Here, pass up the lemon."</p>

<p>And he took a sliced lemon out of his pocket, put a small piece
into his own mouth, and then handed it to Blake, who followed
his example, and passed it on. Each man took a piece; and just
as "bow" had secured the end, Miller called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, jackets off, and get her head out steadily."</p>

<p>The jackets were thrown on shore, and gathered up by the boatmen
in attendance. The crew poised their oars, No. 2 pushing out her
head, and the Captain doing the same for the stern. Miller took
the starting-rope in his hand.</p>

<p>"How the wind catches her stern," he said; "here, pay out the
rope, one of you. No, not you&mdash;some fellow with a strong hand.
Yes, you'll do," he went on, as Hardy stepped down the bank and
took hold of the rope; "let me have it foot by foot as I want
it. Not too quick; make the most of it&mdash;that'll do. Two and three
dip your oars in to give her way."</p>

<p>The rope paid out steadily, and the boat settled to her place.
But now the wind rose again, and the stern drifted towards the
bank.</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em> back her a bit, Miller, and keep her a little
further out, or our oars on stroke side will catch the bank."</p>

<p>"So I see; curse the wind. Back her, one stroke all. Back her,
I say!" shouted Miller.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to get a crew to back her an inch just now,
particularly as there are in her two men who have never rowed
a race before, except in the torpids, and one who has never rowed
a race in his life.</p>

<p>However, back she comes; the starting-rope slackens in Miller's
left hand, and the stroke, unshipping his oar, pushes the stern
gently out again.</p>

<p>There goes the second gun! one short minute more, and we are
off. Short minute, indeed! you wouldn't say so if you were in
the boat, with your heart in your mouth, and trembling all over
like a man with the palsy. Those sixty seconds before the starting
gun in your first race&mdash;why, they are a little life-time.</p>

<p>"By Jove, we are drifting in again," said Miller, in horror.
The Captain looked grim, but said nothing; it was too late now
for him to be unshipping again. "Here, catch hold of the long
boat-hook, and fend her off."</p>

<p>Hardy, to whom this was addressed, seized the boat-hook, and,
standing with one foot in the water, pressed the end of the boat-hook
against the gunwale, at the full stretch of his arm, and so by
main force, kept the stern out. There was just room for stroke
oars to dip, and that was all. The starting-rope was as taut as
a harp-string; will Miller's left hand hold out?</p>

<p>[Illustration: 0170]</p>

<p>It is an awful moment. But the coxswain, though almost dragged
backwards off his seat, is equal to the occasion. He holds his
watch in his right hand with the tiller rope.</p>

<p>"Eight seconds more only. Look out for the flash. Remember, all
eyes in the boat."</p>

<p>There it comes, at last&mdash;the flash of the starting gun. Long
before the sound of the report can roll up the river, the whole
pent-up life and energy which has been held in leash, as it were,
for the last six minutes, is let loose, and breaks away with a
bound and a dash which he who has felt it will remember for his
life, but the like of which, will he ever feel again? The starting-ropes
drop from the coxswains' hands, the oars flash into the water,
and gleam on the feather, the spray flies from them, and the boats
leap forward.</p>

<p>The crowds on the bank scatter, and rush along, each keeping
as near as it may be to its own boat. Some of the men on the towing
path, some on the very edge of, often in, the water&mdash;some slightly
in advance, as if they could help to drag their boat forward&mdash;some
behind, where they can see the pulling better&mdash;but all at full
speed, in wild excitement, and shouting at the top of their voices
to those on whom the honor of the college is laid.</p>

<p>"Well pulled, all!"</p>

<p>"Pick her up there, five!"</p>

<p>"You're gaining, every stroke!"</p>

<p>"Time in the bows!"</p>

<p>"Bravo, St. Ambrose!"</p>

<p>On they rushed by the side of the boats, jostling one another,
stumbling, struggling, and panting along.</p>

<p>For a quarter of a mile along the bank the glorious maddening
hurly-burly extends, and rolls up the side of the stream.</p>

<p>For the first ten strokes Tom was in too great fear of making
a mistake to feel or hear or see. His whole soul was glued to
the back of the man before him, his one thought to keep time,
and get his strength into the stroke. But as the crew settled
down into the well known long sweep, what we may call consciousness
returned; and while every muscle in his body was straining, and
his chest heaved, and his heart leapt, every nerve seemed to be
gathering new life, and his senses to wake into unwonted acuteness.
He caught the scent of the wild thyme in the air, and found room
in his brain to wonder how it could have got there, as he had
never seen the plant near the river, or smelt it before. Though
his eye never wandered from the back of Diogenes, he seemed to
see all things at once. The boat behind, which seemed to be gaining&mdash;it
was all he could do to prevent himself from quickening on the
stroke as he fancied that&mdash;the eager face of Miller, with his
compressed lips, and eyes fixed so earnestly ahead that Tom could
almost feel the glance passing over his right shoulder; the flying
banks and the shouting crowd; see them with his bodily eyes he
could not, but he knew nevertheless that Grey had been upset and
nearly rolled down the bank into the water in the first hundred
yards, that Jack was bounding and scrambling and barking along
by the very edge of the stream; above all, he was just as well
aware as if he had been looking at it, of a stalwart form in cap
and gown, bounding along, brandishing the long boat-hook, and
always keeping just opposite the boat; and amid all the Babel
of voices, and the dash and pulse of the stroke, and the laboring
of his own breathing, he heard Hardy's voice coming to him again
and again, and clear as if there had been no other sound in the
air, "Steady, two! steady! well pulled! steady, steady!" The voice
seemed to give him strength and keep him to his work. And what
work it was! he had had many a hard pull in the last six weeks,
but "never aught like this."</p>

<p>But it can't last for ever; men's muscles are not steel, or their
lungs bull's hide, and hearts can't go on pumping a hundred miles
an hour without bursting. The St. Ambrose's boat is well away
from the boat behind, there is a great gap between the accompanying
crowds; and now, as they near the Gut, she hangs for a moment
or two in hand, though the roar from the bank grows louder and
louder, and Tom is already aware that the St. Ambrose crowd is
melting into the one ahead of them.</p>

<p>"We must be close to Exeter!" The thought flashes into him, and
it would seem into the rest of the crew at the same moment. For,
all at once, the strain seems taken off their arms again; there
is no more drag; she springs to the stroke as she did at the start;
and Miller's face which had darkened for a few seconds, lightens
up again.</p>

<p>Miller's face and attitude are a study. Coiled up into the smallest
possible space, his chin almost resting on his knees, his hands
close to his sides, firmly but lightly feeling the rudder, as
a good horseman handles the mouth of a free-going hunter,&mdash;if
a coxswain could make a bump by his own exertions, surely he will
do it. No sudden jerks of the St. Ambrose rudder will you see,
watch as you will from the bank; the boat never hangs through
fault of his, but easily and gracefully rounds every point. "You're
gaining! you're gaining!" he now and then mutters to the Captain,
who responds with a wink, keeping his breath for other matters.
Isn't he grand, the Captain, as he comes forward like lightening,
stroke after stroke, his back flat, his teeth set, his whole frame
working from the hips with the regularity of a machine? As the
space still narrows, the eyes of the fiery little coxswain flash
with excitement, but he is far too good a judge to hurry the final
effort before victory is safe in his grasp.</p>

<p>The two crowds mingle now, and no mistake; and the shouts come
all in a heap over the water. "Now, St. Ambrose, six strokes more."</p>

<p>"Now, Exeter, you're gaining; pick her up."</p>

<p>"Mind the Gut, Exeter."</p>

<p>"Bravo, St. Ambrose." The water rushes by, still eddying from
the strokes of the boat ahead. Tom fancies now that he can hear
their oars, and the working of their rudder, and the voice of
their coxswain. In another moment both boats are in the Gut, and
a perfect storm of shouts reaches them from the crowd, as it rushes
madly off to the left of the footbridge, amidst which "Oh, well
steered, well steered, St. Ambrose!" is the prevailing cry. Then
Miller, motionless as a statue till now, lifts his right hand
and whirls the tassel round his head; "Give it her now, boys;
six strokes and we are into them." Old Jervis lays down that great
broad back, and lashes his oar through the water with the might
of a giant, the crew caught him up in another stroke, the tight
new boat answers to the spurt, and Tom feels a little shock behind
him, and then a grating sound, as Miller shouts "Unship oars,
bow and three," and the nose of the St. Ambrose boat glides quietly
up the side of the Exeter, till it touches their stroke oar.</p>

<p>"Take care what you're coming to." It is the coxswain of the
bumped boat who speaks.</p>

<p>Tom, looking round, finds himself within a foot or two of him;
and, being utterly unable to contain his joy, and unwilling to
exhibit it before the eyes of a gallant rival, turns away towards
the shore, and begins telegraphing to Hardy.</p>

<p>"Now then, what are you at there in the bows? Cast her off quick.
Come, look alive! Push across at once out of the way of the other
boats."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Jervis," says the Exeter stroke as the St.
Ambrose boat shot past him. "Do it again next race and I sha'n't
care."</p>

<p>"We were within three lengths of Brazen-nose when we bumped,"
says the all-observant Miller in a low voice.</p>

<p>"All right," answers the Captain; "Brazen-nose isn't so strong
as usual. We sha'n't have much trouble there, but a tough job
up above, I take it."</p>

<p>"Brazen-nose was better steered than Exeter."</p>

<p>"They muffed it in the Gut, eh?" said the Captain. "I thought
so by the shouts."</p>

<p>"Yes, we were pressing them a little down below, and their coxswain
kept looking over his shoulder. He was in the Gut before he knew
it, and had to pull his left hand hard or they would have fouled
the Oxfordshire corner. That stopped their way, and in we went."</p>

<p>"Bravo; and how well we started too."</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to that Hardy. It was touch and go though; I couldn't
have held that rope two seconds more."</p>

<p>"How did our fellows work; she dragged a good deal below the
Gut."</p>

<p>Miller looked somewhat serious, but even he cannot be finding
fault just now. For the first step is gained, the first victory
won; and, as Homer sometimes nods, so Miller relaxes the sternness
of his rule. The crew, as soon as they have found their voices
again, laugh and talk, and answer the congratulations of their
friends, as the boat slips along close to the towing path on the
Berks side, "easy all," almost keeping pace nevertheless with
the lower boats, which are racing up under the willows on the
Oxfordshire side. Jack, after one or two feints, makes a frantic
bound into the water, and is hauled dripping into the boat by
Drysdale, unchid by Miller, but to the intense disgust of Diogenes,
whose pantaloons and principles are alike outraged by the proceeding.
He&mdash;the Cato of the oar&mdash;scorns to relax the strictness of his
code even after victory won. Neither word nor look does he cast
to the exhulting St. Ambrosians on the bank; a twinkle in his
eye and a subdued chuckle or two, alone betray that though an
oarsman he is mortal. Already he revolves in his mind the project
of an early walk under a few pea-coats, not being quite satisfied
(conscientious old boy!) that he tried his stretcher enough in
that final spurt, and thinking that there must be an extra pound
of flesh on him somewhere or other which did the mischief.</p>

<p>"I say, Brown," said Drysdale, "how do you feel?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Tom; "I never felt jollier in my life."</p>

<p>"By Jove, though, it was an awful grind; didn't you wish yourself
well out of it below the Gut?"</p>

<p>"No, nor you either."</p>

<p>"Didn't I? I was awfully baked, my throat is like a limekiln
yet. What did you think about?"</p>

<p>"Well, about keeping time, I think," said Tom, "but I can't remember
much."</p>

<p>"I only kept on by thinking how I hated those devils in the Exeter
boat, and how done up they must be, and hoping their No. 2 felt
like having a fit."</p>

<p>At this moment they came opposite the Cherwell. The leading boat
was just passing the winning-post, off the university barge, and
the band struck up the "Conquering Hero," with a crash. And while
a mighty sound of shouts, murmurs, and music went up into the
evening sky, Miller shook the tiller-ropes again, the Captain
shouted, "Now then, pick her up," and the St. Ambrose boat shot
up between the swarming banks at racing pace to her landing-place,
the lion of the evening.</p>

<p>Dear readers of the gentler sex! you, I know, will pardon the
enthusiasm which stirs our pulses, now in sober middle age, as
we call up again the memories of this the most exciting sport
of our boyhood (for we were but boys then, after all). You will
pardon, though I fear hopelessly unable to understand, the above
sketch; your sons and brothers will tell you it could not have
been less technical.</p>

<p>For you, male readers, who have never handled an oar,&mdash;what shall
I say to you? You at least, I hope, in some way&mdash;in other contests
of one kind or another&mdash;have felt as we felt, and have striven
as we strove. You <em>ought</em> to understand and sympathize
with us in all our boating memories. Oh, how fresh and sweet they
are! Above all, that one of the gay little Henley town, the carriage-crowded
bridge, the noble river reach, the giant poplars, which mark the
critical point of the course&mdash;the roaring column of "undergrads,"
light blue and dark purple, Cantab and Oxonian, alike and yet
how different,&mdash;hurling along together, and hiding the towing-path&mdash;the
clang of Henley church-bells&mdash;the cheering, the waving of embroidered
handkerchiefs, and glancing of bright eyes, the ill-concealed
pride of fathers, open delight and exultation of mothers and sisters&mdash;the
levee in the town-hall when the race was rowed, the great cup
full of champagne (inn champagne, but we were not critical)&mdash;the
chops, the steaks, the bitter beer&mdash;but we run into anti-climax&mdash;remember,
we were boys then, and bear with us if you cannot sympathize.</p>

<p>And you, old companions, [Greek text] thranitai, benchers, (of
the gallant eight-oar), now seldom met, but never-forgotten, lairds,
squires, soldiers, merchants, lawyers, grave <em>J.P.'</em>s,
graver clergymen, gravest bishops (for of two bishops at least
does our brotherhood boast), I turn for a moment, from my task,
to reach to you the right hand of fellowship from these pages,
and empty the solemn pewter&mdash;trophy of hard-won victory&mdash;to your
health and happiness.</p>

<p>Surely none the worse Christians and citizens are ye for your
involuntary failing of muscularity!</p>
