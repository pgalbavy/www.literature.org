<P>Travelers used to land at Mikhailov, a little port at the end of the
Transcaspian line; but ships of moderate tonnage hardly had water enough there
to come alongside. On this account, General Annenkof, the creator of the new
railway, the eminent engineer whose name will frequently recur in my narrative,
was led to found Uzun Ada, and thereby considerably shorten the crossing of the
Caspian. The station was built in three months, and it was opened on the 8th of
May, 1886.</P>
<P>Fortunately I had read the account given by Boulangier, the engineer,
relating to the prodigious work of General Annenkof, so that I shall not be so
very much abroad during the railway journey between Uzun Ada and Samarkand, and,
besides, I trust to Major Noltitz, who knows all about the matter. I have a
presentiment that we shall become good friends, and in spite of the proverb
which says, &quot;Though your friend be of honey do not lick him!&quot; I intend to &quot;lick&quot;
my companion often enough for the benefit of my readers.</P>
<P>We often hear of the extraordinary rapidity with which the Americans have
thrown their railroads across the plains of the Far West. But the Russians are
in no whit behind them, if even they have not surpassed them in rapidity as well
as in industrial audacity.</P>
<P>People are fully acquainted with the adventurous campaign of General
Skobeleff against the Turkomans, a campaign of which the building of the railway
assured the definite success. Since then the political state of Central Asia has
been entirely changed, and Turkestan is merely a province of Asiatic Russia,
extending to the frontiers of the Chinese Empire. And already Chinese Turkestan
is very visibly submitting to the Muscovite influence which the vertiginous
heights of the Pamir plateau have not been able to check in its civilizing
march.</P>
<P>I was about to cross the countries which were formerly ravaged by Tamerlane
and Genghis Khan, those fabulous countries of which the Russians in 1886
possessed six hundred and fifteen thousand square kilometres, with thirteen
hundred thousand inhabitants. The southern part of this region now forms the
Transcaspian province, divided into six districts, Fort Alexandrovski,
Krasnovodsk, Askhabad, Karibent, Merv, Pendjeh, governed by Muscovite colonels
or lieutenant-colonels.</P>
<P>As may be imagined, it hardly takes an hour to see Uzun Ada, the name of
which means Long Island. It is almost a town, but a modern town, traced with a
square, drawn with a line or a large carpet of yellow sand. No monuments, no
memories, bridges of planks, houses of wood, to which comfort is beginning to
add a few mansions in stone. One can see what this, first station of the
Transcaspian will be like in fifty years; a great city after having been a great
railway station.</P>
<P>Do not think that there are no hotels. Among others there is the Hôtel du
Czar, which has a good table, good rooms and good beds. But the question of beds
has no interest for me. As the train starts at four o&apos;clock this afternoon, to
begin with, I must telegraph to the <I>Twentieth Century,</I> by the Caspian
cable, that I am at my post at the Uzun Ada station. That done, I can see if I
can pick up anything worth reporting.</P>
<P>Nothing is more simple. It consists in opening an account with those of my
companions with whom I may have to do during the journey. That is my custom, I
always find it answers, and while waiting for the unknown, I write down the
known in my pocketbook, with a number to distinguish each:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Fulk Ephrinell, American.<BR>2. Miss Horatia Bluett,
  English.<BR>3. Major Noltitz, Russian.<BR>4. Monsieur Caterna, French.<BR>5.
  Madame Caterna, French.<BR>6. Baron Weissschnitzerdörfer, German.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As to the Chinese, they will have a number later on, when I have made up my
mind about them. As to the individual in the box, I intend to enter into
communication with him, or her, and to be of assistance in that quarter if I can
do so without betraying the secret.</P>
<P>The train is already marshaled in the station. It is composed of first and
second-class cars, a restaurant car and two baggage vans. These cars are painted
of a light color, an excellent precaution against the heat and against the cold.
For in the Central Asian provinces the temperature ranges between fifty degrees
centigrade above zero and twenty below, and in a range of seventy degrees it is
only prudent to minimize the effects.</P>
<P>These cars are in a convenient manner joined together by gangways, on the
American plan. Instead of being shut up in a compartment, the traveler strolls
about along the whole length of the train. There is room to pass between the
stuffed seats, and in the front and rear of each car are the platforms united by
the gangways. This facility of communication assures the security of the
train.</P>
<P>Our engine has a bogie on four small wheels, and is thus able to negotiate
the sharpest curves; a tender with water and fuel; then come a front van, three
first-class cars with twenty-four places each, a restaurant car with pantry and
kitchen, four second-class cars and a rear van; in all twelve vehicles, counting
in the locomotive and tender. The first class cars are provided with dressing
rooms, and their seats, by very simple mechanism, are convertible into beds,
which, in fact, are indispensable for long journeys. The second-class travelers
are not so comfortably treated, and besides, they have to bring their victuals
with them, unless they prefer to take their meals at the stations. There are not
many, however, who travel the complete journey between the Caspian and the
eastern provinces of China&mdash;that is to say about six thousand kilometres. Most of
them go to the principal towns and villages of Russian Turkestan, which have
been reached by the Transcaspian Railway for some years, and which up to the
Chinese frontier has a length of over 1,360 miles.</P>
<P>This Grand Transasiatic has only been open six weeks and the company is as
yet only running two trains a week. All has gone well up to the present; but I
ought to add the significant detail that the railway men carry a supply of
revolvers to arm the passengers with if necessary. This is a wise precaution in
crossing the Chinese deserts, where an attack on the train is not
improbable.</P>
<P>I believe the company are doing their best to ensure the punctuality of their
trains; but the Chinese section is managed by Celestials, and who knows what has
been the past life of those people? Will they not be more intent on the security
of their dividends than of their passengers?</P>
<P>As I wait for the departure I stroll about on the platform, looking through
the windows of the cars, which have no doors along the sides, the entrances
being at the ends.</P>
<P>Everything is new; the engine is as bright as it can be, the carriages are
brilliant in their new paint, their springs have not begun to give with wear,
and their wheels run true on the rails. Then there is the rolling stock with
which we are going to cross a continent. There is no railway as long as this&mdash;not
even in America. The Canadian line measures five thousand kilometres, the
Central Union, five thousand two hundred and sixty, the Santa Fe line, four
thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, the Atlantic Pacific, five thousand six
hundred and thirty, the Northern Pacific, six thousand two hundred and fifty.
There is only one line which will be longer when it is finished, and that is the
Grand Transsiberian, from the Urals to Vladivostock, which will measure six
thousand five hundred kilometres.</P>
<P>Between Tiflis and Pekin our journey will not last more than thirteen days,
from Uzun Ada it will only last eleven. The train will only stop at the smaller
stations to take in fuel and water. At the chief towns like Merv, Bokhara,
Samarkand, Tashkend, Kachgar, Kokhand, Sou Tcheou, Lan Tcheou, Tai Youan, it
will stop a few hours&mdash;and that will enable me to do these towns in reporter
style.</P>
<P>Of course, the same driver and stoker will not take us through. They will be
relieved every six hours. Russians will take us up to the frontier of Turkestan,
and Chinese will take us on through China.</P>
<P>But there is one representative of the company who will not leave his post,
and that is Popof, our head guard, a true Russian of soldierly bearing, hairy
and bearded, with a folded overcoat and a Muscovite cap. I intend to talk a good
deal with this gallant fellow, although he is not very talkative. If he does not
despise a glass of vodka, opportunity offered, he may have a good deal to say to
me; for ten years he has been on the Transcaspian between Uzun Ada and the
Pamirs, and during the last month he has been all along the line to Pekin.</P>
<P>I call him No. 7 in my notebook, and I hope he will give me information
enough. I only want a few incidents of the journey, just a few little incidents
worthy of the <I>Twentieth Century.</I></P>
<P>Among the passengers I see on the platform are a few Jews, recognizable more
by their faces than their attire. Formerly, in Central Asia, they could only
wear the &quot;toppe,&quot; a sort of round cap, and a plain rope belt, without any silk
ornamentation&mdash;under pain of death. And I am told that they could ride on asses
in certain towns and walk on foot in others. Now they wear the oriental turban
and roll in their carriages if their purse allows of it. Who would hinder them
now they are subjects of the White Czar, Russian citizens, rejoicing in civil
and political rights equal to those of their Turkoman compatriots?</P>
<P>There are a few Tadjiks of Persian origin, the handsomest men you can
imagine. They have booked for Merv, or Bokhara, or Samarkand, or Tachkend, or
Kokhand, and will not pass the Russo-Chinese frontier. As a rule they are
second-class passengers. Among the first-class passengers I noticed a few Usbegs
of the ordinary type, with retreating foreheads and prominent cheek bones, and
brown complexions, who were the lords of the country, and from whose families
come the emirs and khans of Central Asia.</P>
<P>But are there not any Europeans in this Grand Transasiatic train? It must be
confessed that I can only count five or six. There are a few commercial
travelers from South Russia, and one of those inevitable gentlemen from the
United Kingdom, who are inevitably to be found on the railways and steamboats.
It is still necessary to obtain permission to travel on the Transcaspian,
permission which the Russian administration does not willingly accord to an
Englishman; but this man has apparently been able to get one.</P>
<P>And he seems to me to be worth notice. He is tall and thin, and looks quite
the fifty years that his gray hairs proclaim him to be. His characteristic
expression is one of haughtiness, or rather disdain, composed in equal parts of
love of all things English and contempt for all things that are not. This type
is occasionally so insupportable, even to his compatriots, that Dickens,
Thackeray and others have often made fun of it. How he turned up his nose at the
station at Uzun Ada, at the train, at the men, at the car in which he had
secured a seat by placing in it his traveling bag! Let us call him No. 8 in my
pocketbook.</P>
<P>There seem to be no personages of importance. That is a pity. If only the
Emperor of Russia, on one side, or the Son of Heaven, on the other, were to
enter the train to meet officially on the frontier of the two empires, what
festivities there would be, what grandeur, what descriptions, what copy for
letters and telegrams!</P>
<P>It occurs to me to have a look at the mysterious box. Has it not a right to
be so called? Yes, certainly. I must really find out where it has been put and
how to get at it easily.</P>
<P>The front van is already full of Ephrinell&apos;s baggage. It does not open at the
side, but in front and behind, like the cars. It is also furnished with a
platform and a gangway. An interior passage allows the guard to go through it to
reach the tender and locomotive if necessary. Popof&apos;s little cabin is on the
platform of the first car, in the left-hand corner. At night it will be easy for
me to visit the van, for it is only shut in by the doors at the ends of the
passage arranged between the packages. If this van is reserved for luggage
registered through to China, the luggage for the Turkestan stations ought to be
in the van at the rear.</P>
<P>When I arrived the famous box was still on the platform.</P>
<P>In looking at it closely I observe that airholes have been bored on each of
its sides, and that on one side it has two panels, one of which can be made to
slide on the other from the inside. And I am led to think that the prisoner has
had it made so in order that he can, if necessary, leave his prison&mdash;probably
during the night.</P>
<P>Just now the porters are beginning to lift the box. I have the satisfaction
of seeing that they attend to the directions inscribed on it. It is placed, with
great care, near the entrance to the van, on the left, the side with the panels
outward, as if it were the door of a cupboard. And is not the box a cupboard? A
cupboard I propose to open?</P>
<P>It remains to be seen if the guard in charge of the luggage is to remain in
this van. No. I find that his post is just outside it.</P>
<P>&quot;There it is, all right!&quot; said one of the porters, looking to see that the
case was as it should be, top where top should be, and so on.</P>
<P>&quot;There is no fear of its moving,&quot; said another porter; &quot;the glass will reach
Pekin all right, unless the train runs off the metals.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Or it does not run into anything,&quot; said the other; &quot;and that remains to be
seen.&quot;</P>
<P>They were right&mdash;these good fellows&mdash;it remained to be seen&mdash;and it would be
seen.</P>
<P>The American came up to me and took a last look at his stock of incisors,
molars and canines, with a repetition of his invariable &quot;Wait a bit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You know, Monsieur Bombarnac,&quot; he said to me, &quot;that the passengers are going
to dine at the Hôtel du Czar before the departure of the train. It is time now.
Will you come with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I follow you.&quot;</P>
<P>And we entered the dining room. All my numbers are there: 1, Ephrinell,
taking his place as usual by the side of 2, Miss Horatia Bluett. The French
couple, 4 and 5, are also side by side. Number 3, that is Major Noltitz, is
seated in front of numbers 9 and 10, the two Chinese to whom I have just given
numbers in my notebook. As to the fat German, number 6, he has already got his
long nose into his soup plate. I see also that the Guard Popol, number 7, has
his place at the foot of the table. The other passengers, Europeans and
Asiatics, are installed, <I>passim</I> with the evident intention of doing
justice to the repast.</P>
<P>Ah! I forgot my number 8, the disdainful gentleman whose name I don&apos;t yet
know, and who seems determined to find the Russian cookery inferior to the
English.</P>
<P>I also notice with what attention Monsieur Caterna looks after his wife, and
encourages her to make up for the time lost when she was unwell on board the
<I>Astara</I>. He keeps her glass filled, he chooses the best pieces for her,
etc.</P>
<P>&quot;What a good thing it is,&quot; I hear him say, &quot;that we are not to leeward of the
Teuton, for there would be nothing left for us!&quot;</P>
<P>He is to windward of him&mdash;that is to say, the dishes reach him before they get
to the baron, which, however, does not prevent his clearing them without
shame.</P>
<P>The observation, in sea language, made me smile, and Caterna, noticing it,
gave me a wink with a slight movement of the shoulder toward the baron.</P>
<P>It is evident that these French people are not of high distinction, they do
not belong to the upper circles; but they are good people, I will answer for it,
and when we have to rub shoulders with compatriots, we must not be too
particular in Turkestan.</P>
<P>The dinner ends ten minutes before the time fixed for our departure. The bell
rings and we all make a move for the train, the engine of which is blowing off
steam.</P>
<P>Mentally, I offer a last prayer to the God of reporters and ask him not to
spare me adventures. Then, after satisfying myself that all my numbers are in
the first-class cars, so that I can keep an eye on them, I take my place.</P>
<P>The Baron Weissschnitzerdörfer&mdash;what an interminable name&mdash;is not behindhand
this time. On the contrary, it is the train this time which is five minutes late
in starting; and the German has begun to complain, to chafe and to swear, and
threatens to sue the company for damages. Ten thousand roubles&mdash;not a penny
less!&mdash;if it causes him to fail. Fail in what, considering that he is going to
Pekin?</P>
<P>At length the last shriek of the whistle cleaves the air, the cars begin to
move, and a loud cheer salutes the departure of the Grand Transasiatic
express.</P>
