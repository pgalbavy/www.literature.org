<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Home Missionary Society of the South Avenue Church was holding
its monthly meeting in the Campbell parlors, and Peace, feeling
very forlorn and left out, because grandma had suggested that
she better join the sisters in the barn playhouse, wandered down
to the gate and stood looking up the street in search of something
to occupy her attention. She was tired of playing games in the
barn, she had read the latest St. Nicholas from cover to cover,
and the postman had not yet brought the Youth's Companion, although
this was the regular day for it. Anyway, she didn't care to read.
She would rather stay and listen to what the women in the house
were talking about, but if grandma did not want her, she certainly
should not bother them with her presence. Likely the meeting would
be very dry; it usually was when Mrs. Roberts stayed away, and
she had not put in appearance yet.</p>

<p>Grandma had half promised that she might visit the Lilac Lady
that afternoon, but for some reason had changed her mind and put
off the visit until the morrow. Ho, hum! What was a small girl
to do to amuse herself this warm day, when she had already done
everything she could think of, and had been forbidden to go where
she most wanted to go?</p>

<p>Slowly she unlatched the gate and strolled down the avenue, swinging
her white sunbonnet by one string, and whistling plaintively under
her breath. The wide street, shaded by immense oaks and maples,
felt deliciously cool and restful, but it was also very quiet,
and Peace had wandered several blocks without meeting a soul,
when without warning she stumbled over two mites of tots, almost
hidden in the rank grass and weeds in front of a ragged-looking
unkempt little cabin of a house, which in its better days had
evidently been used for a barn. The children were as much surprised
as Peace, and after one frightened glance at the intruder, they
both buried their heads in their patched aprons and cowered still
lower among the weeds. But from the fleeting glimpse Peace had
caught of the little faces, she knew they had been crying, and
her first thought was, "They are lost."</p>

<p>Impulsively she kneeled on the walk beside them and coaxingly
asked, "What is the trouble, little girls? Have you run away?"</p>

<p>"No, we ain't!" retorted the older child, lifting a streaked,
tear-stained face to eye her questioner indignantly. "We ain't
girls, either! I am, but he ain't!"</p>

<p>"Oh," murmured Peace, much abashed by her fierce reception, "I
took him for a girl on account of his clo'es. He's wearing dresses."</p>

<p>"He ain't old enough for pants. He's only two."</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy! He's lots bigger than Glen. But then Glen won't be
two until next January."</p>

<p>"Is Glen your brother?" asked the other girl, somewhat mollified
by the friendliness of the stranger's voice.</p>

<p>"No, he's the minister's little boy which we used to have in
Parker where we lived 'fore we came here. What's your baby's name?"</p>

<p>"Rivers."</p>

<p>"His first name, I mean."</p>

<p>"That's his first name. Rivers Dillon, and I'm Fern."</p>

<p>"Oh! They're as bad as ours, ain't they? I'm always running up
against horrid names. Gail says it's 'cause I am always looking
for them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our names ain't horrid!" Fern Dillon bounced off the grass like
an angry hornet, then collapsed beside the baby brother, who evidently
was not given much to talking, for he had not said a word, but
simply stared in round-eyed surprise at the pretty stranger child.
"Oh, dear, everybody is so mean!"</p>

<p>"Fern, what have I done? I didn't mean to be hateful," cried
Peace remorsefully. "Please, I'm sorry I've made you mad. Don't
mind anything I said. I've always hated my own name so bad that
I am always glad when I can find a worse one. That is all I meant."</p>

<p>Strange to say, Fern's wrath was at once appeased, in spite of
the explanation, and she smiled faintly as she brushed away the
fresh tears. "I thought you was going to be just like Mrs. Burnett,"
she explained. "She's always scolding mamma 'cause she won't put
Rivers and me in a Home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a <em>Home</em>?" cried Peace in horrified accents. "What
for?"</p>

<p>"So's she can get more work to do. Lots of people won't give
her their washing 'cause she has to take both of us with her,
and folks think three is too many to feed, I guess."</p>

<p>"Is your papa dead?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's gone. Mabel Cartwell says he's in jail," her voice
dropped to an awed whisper; "but when I asked mamma, she just
cried and cried. Now she's sick and they are going to take her
to a hospital, and I don't know what Rivers and me'll do. Mrs.
Burnett says of course we can't go with her, 'cause there ain't
any sickness the matter with us, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, we can't stay with
<em>her</em>! She shakes Rivers for everything he touches. Oh
dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>"Have they&mdash;taken your mamma&mdash;away yet?"</p>

<p>"No, she's in there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In that barn?"</p>

<p>"That's where we live since papa&mdash;went away."</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask her if you can't go home with me. Grandma will
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't bother mamma," cried Fern, clutching Peace about
the ankles as she started toward the sagging door of the ramshackle
old house. "Mrs. Burnett will chase you out with the broom like
she did us. And 'sides, mamma won't know you. She doesn't even
know Rivers and me&mdash;her own little children."</p>

<p>Peace pondered. Here was an unlooked-for predicament. Would she
be doing wrong if she took the brother and sister away without
saying anything to the mother who did not know her own children
any longer? She might speak to Mrs. Burnett, but how about that
broomstick? For a moment she stood irresolute, scratching her
head thoughtfully. Then with characteristic energy and decision,
she grabbed Rivers with one hand and Fern with the other, and
trotted off down the street, saying briefly, "I'm going to show
you to grandma. She will know what to do."</p>

<p>"Will you bring us back again?"</p>

<p>"Course! You don't think I am a kidnapper, do you? That's what
Mittie Cole called me when I thought I was going to adopt the
twins that were only runaways. Mittie got to like me afterwards,
though."</p>

<p>"I like you now."</p>

<p>"Of course. Most folks do, but it takes a longer time with some
to make up their minds. I'm glad you are quick at d'ciding. We
turn this corner."</p>

<p>Hurrying them along as fast as Rivers' short legs could toddle,
she at length reached the big, old-fashioned house, and burst
in upon the Missionary Meeting with a torrent of jumbled explanation.</p>

<p>"Here's two folks that need home missionarying if anybody does.
Their mother is so sick she doesn't know people any more, and
the father is either in jail or heaven. Mrs. Burnett chases 'em
out of the house with the broomstick, and I borrowed them to show
you just how ragged and dirty they really are, so's you will know
I ain't got hold of a fake mistake again. They live in a horrid
little barn of a house, quite a piece from here, and the hospital
is coming after the mother any time. They won't take Fern and
Rivers, of course, 'cause they are both well, but I thought likely
Mrs. Burnett might begin to use the broomstick again if the children
were left with her, so I brought 'em along with me until you could
decide what to do with them. They don't want to go to a Home,
and I don't want them to, either." Her breath gave out, and the
astonished ladies recovered their poise sufficiently to ask questions
until the whole pitiful tale had been unravelled.</p>

<p>"We'll send a committee at once to investigate," proposed the
fat secretary, whom Peace disliked for no reason whatever.</p>

<p>"Then send somebody who's got a heart," suggested the little
maid. "This is a truly sick woman which needs help. I'll show
you the place. Fern, you and Rivers stay here with grandma till
I get back. Ladies, who are the committee?"</p>

<p>Spurred on by Peace's enthusiastic leadership, the society hastily
appointed a committee, and they departed on their errand of mercy.
The house was even more squalid than Peace had pictured it, and
the woman's case more desperate. An hour later a subdued, sympathetic
trio of ladies, with Peace in tow, returned to the Campbell residence
with their report.</p>

<p>"It is worse than we expected," said the chairman in a voice
that trembled in spite of her efforts to speak naturally. "The
father is in &mdash;Stillwater. Embezzlement. The mother, destitute,
without relatives or friends, naturally a frail little woman,
and now ill with typhoid, brought on by overwork and anxiety.
These two children dependent upon her, and none of the neighbors
really situated so they can take care of them. We secured a bed
in Danbury Hospital for the mother, and told the authorities that
we would be responsible for the babies. We simply could not think
of leaving them there to be buffeted about by unwilling neighbors&mdash;no
telling how long the mother will be unable to take care of them,
if she ever is again. Now, the question is, what shall we do with
these two tots?"</p>

<p>Immediately there was a buzz of comment, and an avalanche of
theory and advice began to flow from fifty tongues.</p>

<p>Peace, interested in the controversy, had been banished to the
dining-room to amuse Rivers, who had developed an unlimited propensity
for mischief-making since his arrival at the big house, but through
the open door she caught bits of the conversation, and her heart
beat quick with fear.</p>

<p>"They are trying to <em>passle</em> Fern and Rivers off among
different families," she said with bated breath. "What a shame
that would be! Mr. Dillon in Stillwater, the mother in Danbury
Hospital, Fern with Mrs. York, and Rivers at the Weston's. Oh,
they mustn't part Fern from her baby! They can't get along without
each other. Ain't it too bad we don't have a Home around here
like they've got in Kentucky! Why didn't I think of that before?"</p>

<p>She gathered Fern and Rivers under her wing once more, and noiselessly
departed from the house by way of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Where are we going this time? Home?" questioned Fern, loath
to leave the great house so full of beautiful things for one to
admire.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I've just got a think. I b'lieve I know a lady which'll
take you both till your mother gets well. She's lame herself,
but Aunt Pen isn't, and they both love children. You'll have to
ride on the cars. Come on, don't be afraid. I've done it lots
of times and I never get lost."</p>

<p>Somewhat reluctantly, Fern allowed herself and brother to be
lifted onto the car by the big conductor, who evidently knew Peace,
for he greeted her with a cheery shout, "Hello, my hearty! Going
to see your Lilac Lady again?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace answered promptly. "I've got another bunch of orphans&mdash;that
is, they will be until their mother gets well and the father comes
back, if he can." She remembered at that moment that she did not
yet understand what had actually happened to the breadwinner of
this unfortunate family. "And I knew my Lilac Lady would be glad
to take care of them for a little while, so's they wouldn't have
to be sep'rated."</p>

<p>With that, she ushered the children to seats inside the moving
car, and they were quickly whirled away to the corner where stood
Teeter's Pharmacy. Here they were helped off by the genial conductor,
and Peace led the way up the hill to the beautiful stone house
which could be plainly seen from the roadway now, because the
thick cedar hedges had all been cut down, and only tall iron palings
enclosed the lovely gardens.</p>

<p>Under her favorite oak by the lilac hedge lay the lame girl in
her prison-chair, looking whiter and frailer than ever before,
and Peace stopped in the midst of a rapturous kiss to ask fearfully,
"Have you been sick again?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," smiled the marble lips. "I am a little tired these
days, but perfectly well. Whom have you here?"</p>

<p>"Fern and Rivers Dillon. Their mother is dreadfully sick with
<em>tryfoid</em> fever and their father is in&mdash;well, it's either
a jail or a graveyard. I found them crying 'cause Mrs. Burnett
had driven them out of the house with the broomstick, and when
I took them home to the lady missionaries who are meeting at our
house this afternoon, they began planning right away to divide
them up among some families of our church. I couldn't bear to
think of that, so I brought them up to you. I knew you'd be glad
to keep them till the mother gets well, and they don't want to
go to the Children's Home a bit. Rivers can't keep still a minute,
but I know how he feels. It's the same way with me. At first I
couldn't see how any mother would name her little boy such a name
as that, but now I know. He upset three vases of flowers in the
reception hall, and spilled a glass of frappé down his dress when
I tried to give him some to drink, and pulled over the bird-cage,
so's the water was all spilled, and stepped into the dog's drinking
trough at the back door while I was trying to get them out of
the house without the ladies seeing me. He makes rivers out of
every bit of water he comes near."</p>

<p>"Doesn't your grandmother know where you have gone?" asked the
invalid in surprise, not half understanding what Peace was trying
to tell her.</p>

<p>"Why, no! She's one of the missionaries herself. She might think
I ought to let her s'ciety look after these children as long as
they've got hold of the mother already; but <em>I&mdash;</em>they'd
be sep'rated as sure as fits, and&mdash;just look how teenty Rivers
is to be taken away from <em>all</em> his folks at once."</p>

<p>"I don't want him tookened away," Fern spoke up. "Mamma told
me to stay with him all the time, and I said I would. He can't
talk much yet and there ain't anybody else can tell what he wants,
now that mamma is sick."</p>

<p>"Come here, dear." The lame girl held out her thin, blue-veined
hands, and little, homeless Fern ran to her with a desolate cry.</p>

<p>Peace was satisfied, and dropping down cross-legged in the grass
at their feet, she remarked thoughtfully, "I <em>had</em> to bring
them here, you see. Our house is full already, and grandpa says
grandma has all she can 'tend to with the six of us. The parsonage
is too small to hold any more, and besides, Saint John is away
on his vacation, so the house is shut up for a few days. I knew
Aunt Pen could mother a dozen, and I knew you'd want her to if
she got the chance, so I brought 'em along.</p>

<p>"Isn't it too bad there isn't a nice Children's Home in this
state like there is in Kentucky or some place down South, where
one lady has forty daughters? They ain't any of 'em her very own.
She's really just the matron of the Home, like Miss Chase is of
our Children's Home, only they don't call the place a Home. The
lady is just like a real mother to them, and she won't let any
of her girls be adopted away from her. She just takes care of
them until they are old enough to look out for themselves or get
a husband to look out for them. Then she takes some more in their
place and keeps on that way. And they just love her to pieces.
They wear nice clothes and she teaches 'em music and manners and
how to keep house and makes useful wives out of them. Oh, that's
the kind of a Home I'd like to have here! Then Lottie could live
there 'stead of being sent to the 'sylum."</p>

<p>"Lottie sent to the asylum? Why, what do you mean, Peace?" cried
the startled invalid, sitting almost upright in her chair.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" It was Peace's turn to look surprised.</p>

<p>"Not a word of that sort."</p>

<p>"Why, you know Lottie is a <em>norphan</em>, and when she was
a baby somebody adopted her, but her new mother died last winter,
and her new father put her in the Home 'cause he couldn't take
care of her himself. Now he's been killed on the railroad, and
his people don't want to be bothered with her, so she's to be
sent to a Norphan 'Sylum, 'cause the Home takes only children
who have somebody who will look after them a little. Lottie feels
dreadfully bad and has 'most cried her eyes out already. I couldn't
get her even to smile when I was up there this week. She is going
to leave next Wednesday."</p>

<p>For a long moment the lame girl lay in deep thought, still holding
Fern's chubby hand in hers, though she had evidently forgotten
all about the little stranger children in her concern for the
friendless orphan, Lottie. When she spoke, she asked absently,
"What was that you were telling me about the Kentucky lady? Where
did you hear about it?"</p>

<p>"That girls' Home in Kentucky? Oh, grandma was reading about
it in Blank's Magazine the other day, and grandpa said that's
the way all children's Homes ought to be carried out. Then the
boys and girls would be happier and grow up into better men and
women. That's what I think, too."</p>

<p>"We take Blank's Magazine," said the lame girl irrelevantly.
"Here comes Aunt Pen. We must tell her about Fern and Rivers,
and she will telephone the ladies that they are safe with us.
Poor little waifs! You are home now&mdash;until the dear mother is
able to care for you again. Then we'll see."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of it, but the next time Peace visited
the Lilac Lady, she found a crew of noisy carpenters at work on
the stone house, and in answer to her surprised questions, the
invalid said, "This is to be an Orphan Asylum, dear. We shall
not call it by that ugly name, but that is what it is really to
be, and we have already two real orphans, not counting Fern and
Rivers, who may be here for only a few weeks or months."</p>

<p>"Who are the orphans?"</p>

<p>"Giuseppe and Lottie."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lilac Lady! How did you ever think of such a splendid
plan?"</p>

<p>"I didn't, Peace. It was you."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. When you told me about that Kentucky Home which all
the children love, I wondered why Aunt Pen would not make a good
mother for such a place in this state, and when I asked her, she
was <em>so</em> happy!"</p>

<p>"But you? Where will you live if you turn your lovely house into
a <em>norphan</em> 'sylum?"</p>

<p>"Right here&mdash;till the time comes to go home. It won't be long
now, but I shall be content if I know the fortune which failed
to make me happy is bringing joy and sunshine into the lives of
scores of homeless children&mdash;hundreds in time, perhaps&mdash;and is
giving them the education and self-reliance and refinement and
love which will make them noble citizens of a noble country."</p>

<p>Peace only vaguely understood her words, but it was clear to
her that the stone mansion was to become a home nest now for helpless
little ones whose own parents had been taken from them, and the
thought that she had had even a small share in bringing to pass
this splendid plan sent a thrill of joy singing through her heart.
Hugging her knees together with both lithe brown arms, she puckered
her lips and began to whistle the refrain:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Sca-atter sunshine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All along the wa-ay;<br/>
Cheer and bless and bri-ighten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every passing da-ay.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>The lame girl joined in with her rich, sweet tones, and they
sang it through to the end. Then as silence once more fell upon
them, the young mistress of the place dropped her waxen hand lightly
upon the brown curls resting against the arm of her chair, and
said musingly, "That is to be the motto of our Home, dear. The
song has brought me more happiness than any other thing in my
life, I think. I want to pass it on."</p>

<p>"And let me help," eagerly put in Peace.</p>
