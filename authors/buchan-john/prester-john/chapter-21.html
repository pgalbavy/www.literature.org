<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I remember that I looked over the brink into the yeasty abyss
with a mind hovering between perplexity and tears.  I wanted to
sit down and cry&mdash;why, I did not know, except that some great
thing had happened. My brain was quite clear as to my own position. 
I was shut in this place, with no chance of escape and with no
food.  In a little I must die of starvation, or go mad and throw
myself after Laputa.  And yet I did not care a rush.  My nerves
had been tried too greatly in the past week. Now I was comatose,
and beyond hoping or fearing.</p>

<p>I sat for a long time watching the light play on the fretted
sheet of water and wondering where Laputa's body had gone. I shivered
and wished he had not left me alone, for the darkness would come
in time and I had no matches.  After a little I got tired of doing
nothing, and went groping among the treasure chests.  One or two
were full of coin &mdash;British sovereigns, Kruger sovereigns,
Napoleons, Spanish and Portuguese gold pieces, and many older
coins ranging back to the Middle Ages and even to the ancients. 
In one handful there was a splendid gold stater, and in another
a piece of Antoninus Pius.  The treasure had been collected for
many years in many places, contributions of chiefs from ancient
hoards as well as the cash received from <em>I.D.B.  I </em>untied
one or two of the little bags of stones and poured the contents
into my hands.  Most of the diamonds were small, such as a labourer
might secrete on his person.  The larger ones&mdash;and some were very
large&mdash;were as a rule discoloured, looking more like big cairngorms.
But one or two bags had big stones which even my inexperienced
eye told me were of the purest water.  There must be some new
pipe, I thought, for these could not have been stolen from any
known mine.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>After that I sat on the floor again and looked at the water. 
It exercised a mesmeric influence on me, soothing all care.  I
was quite happy to wait for death, for death had no meaning to
me.  My hate and fury were both lulled into a trance, since the
passive is the next stage to the overwrought.</p>

<p>It must have been full day outside now, for the funnel was bright
with sunshine, and even the dim cave caught a reflected radiance. 
As I watched the river I saw a bird flash downward, skimming the
water.  It turned into the cave and fluttered among its dark recesses. 
I heard its wings beating the roof as it sought wildly for an
outlet.  It dashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped
again into the cave. For maybe twenty minutes it fluttered, till
at last it found the way it had entered by.  With a dart it sped
up the funnel of rock into light and freedom.</p>

<p>I had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude, I ended in keen
excitement.  The sight of it seemed to take a film from my eyes. 
I realized the zest of liberty, the passion of life again.  I
felt that beyond this dim underworld there was the great joyous
earth, and I longed for it.  I wanted to live now.  My memory
cleared, and I remembered all that had befallen me during the
last few days.  I had played the chief part in the whole business,
and I had won.  Laputa was dead and the treasure was mine, while
Arcoll was crushing the Rising at his ease.  I had only to be
free again to be famous and rich.  My hopes had returned, but
with them came my fears.  What if I could not escape? I must perish
miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though my friends
were out for rescue.  In place of my former lethargy I was now
in a fever of unrest.</p>

<p>My first care was to explore the way I had come.  I ran down
the passage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned.
I had been right in my guess, for the thing was gone.  Laputa
was in truth a Titan, who in the article of death could break
down a bridge which would have taken any three men an hour to
shift.  The gorge was about seven yards wide, too far to risk
a jump, and the cliff fell sheer and smooth to the imprisoned
waters two hundred feet below.  There was no chance of circuiting
it, for the wall was as smooth as if it had been chiselled.  The
hand of man had been at work to make the sanctuary inviolable.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that sooner or later Arcoll would track Laputa
to this place.  He would find the bloodstains in the gully, but
the turnstile would be shut and he would never find the trick
of it.  Nor could he have any kaffirs with him who knew the secret
of the Place of the Snake.  Still if Arcoll knew I was inside
he would find some way to get to me even though he had to dynamite
the curtain of rock.  I shouted, but my voice seemed to be drowned
in the roar of the water. It made but a fresh chord in the wild
orchestra, and I gave up hopes in that direction.</p>

<p>Very dolefully I returned to the cave.  I was about to share
the experience of all treasure-hunters&mdash;to be left with jewels
galore and not a bite to sustain life.  The thing was too commonplace
to be endured.  I grew angry, and declined so obvious a fate. 
'Ek sal 'n plan maak,' I told myself in the old Dutchman's words. 
I had come through worse dangers, and a way I should find.  To
starve in the cave was no ending for David Crawfurd.  Far better
to join Laputa in the depths in a manly hazard for liberty.</p>

<p>My obstinacy and irritation cheered me.  What had become of the
lack-lustre young fool who had mooned here a few minutes back. 
Now I was as tense and strung for effort as the day I had ridden
from Blaauwildebeestefontein to Umvelos'.  I felt like a runner
in the last lap of a race.  For four days I had lived in the midst
of terror and darkness.  Daylight was only a few steps ahead,
daylight and youth restored and a new world.</p>

<p>There were only two outlets from that cave&mdash;the way I had come,
and the way the river came.  The first was closed, the second
a sheer staring impossibility.  I had been into every niche and
cranny, and there was no sign of a passage.  I sat down on the
floor and looked at the wall of water.  It fell, as I have already
explained, in a solid sheet, which made up the whole of the wall
of the cave.  Higher than the roof of the cave I could not see
what happened, except that it must be the open air, for the sun
was shining on it.  The water was about three yards distant from
the edge of the cave's floor, but it seemed to me that high up,
level with the roof, this distance decreased to little more than
a foot.</p>

<p>I could not see what the walls of the cave were like, but they
looked smooth and difficult.  Supposing I managed to climb up
to the level of the roof close to the water, how on earth was
I to get outside on to the wall of the ravine?  I knew from my
old days of rock-climbing what a complete obstacle the overhang
of a cave is.</p>

<p>While I looked, however, I saw a thing which I had not noticed
before. On the left side of the fall the water sluiced down in
a sheet to the extreme edge of the cave, almost sprinkling the
floor with water.  But on the right side the force of water was
obviously weaker, and a little short of the level of the cave
roof there was a spike of rock which slightly broke the fall. 
The spike was covered, but the covering was shallow, for the current
flowed from it in a rose-shaped spray.  If a man could get to
that spike and could get a foot on it without being swept down,
it might be possible&mdash;just possible&mdash;to do something with the
wall of the chasm above the cave.  Of course I knew nothing about
the nature of that wall.  It might be as smooth as a polished
pillar.</p>

<p>The result of these cogitations was that I decided to prospect
the right wall of the cave close to the waterfall.  But first
I went rummaging in the back part to see if I could find anything
to assist me.  In one corner there was a rude cupboard with some
stone and metal vessels.  Here, too, were the few domestic utensils
of the dead Keeper. In another were several locked coffers on
which I could make no impression.  There were the treasure-chests
too, but they held nothing save treasure, and gold and diamonds
were no manner of use to me. Other odds and ends I found&mdash;spears,
a few skins, and a broken and notched axe.  I took the axe in
case there might be cutting to do.</p>

<p>Then at the back of a bin my hand struck something which brought
the blood to my face.  It was a rope, an old one, but still in
fair condition and forty or fifty feet long.  I dragged it out
into the light and straightened its kinks.  With this something
could be done, assuming I could cut my way to the level of the
roof.</p>

<p>I began the climb in my bare feet, and at the beginning it was
very bad.  Except on the very edge of the abyss there was scarcely
a handhold.  Possibly in floods the waters may have swept the
wall in a curve, smoothing down the inner part and leaving the
outer to its natural roughness.  There was one place where I had
to hang on by a very narrow crack while I scraped with the axe
a hollow for my right foot.  And then about twelve feet from the
ground I struck the first of the iron pegs.</p>

<p>To this day I cannot think what these pegs were for.  They were
old square-headed things which had seen the wear of centuries. 
They cannot have been meant to assist a climber, for the dwellers
of the cave had clearly never contemplated this means of egress. 
Perhaps they had been used for some kind of ceremonial curtain
in a dim past.  They were rusty and frail, and one of them came
away in my hand, but for all that they marvellously assisted my
ascent.</p>

<p>I had been climbing slowly, doggedly and carefully, my mind wholly
occupied with the task; and almost before I knew I found my head
close under the roof of the cave.  It was necessary now to move
towards the river, and the task seemed impossible.  I could see
no footholds, save two frail pegs, and in the corner between the
wall and the roof was a rough arch too wide for my body to jam
itself in.  Just below the level of the roof&mdash;say two feet &mdash;I
saw the submerged spike of rock. The waters raged around it, and
could not have been more than an inch deep on the top.  If I could
only get my foot on that I believed I could avoid being swept
down, and stand up and reach for the wall above the cave.</p>

<p>But how to get to it?  It was no good delaying, for my frail
holds might give at any moment.  In any case I would have the
moral security of the rope, so I passed it through a fairly staunch
pin close to the roof, which had an upward tilt that almost made
a ring of it.  One end of the rope was round my body, the other
was loose in my hand, and I paid it out as I moved.  Moral support
is something.  Very gingerly I crawled like a fly along the wall,
my fingers now clutching at a tiny knob, now clawing at a crack
which did little more than hold my nails. It was all hopeless
insanity, and yet somehow I did it.  The rope and the nearness
of the roof gave me confidence and balance. Then the holds ceased
altogether a couple of yards from the water.  I saw my spike of
rock a trifle below me.  There was nothing for it but to risk
all on a jump.  I drew the rope out of the hitch, twined the slack
round my waist, and leaped for the spike.</p>

<p>It was like throwing oneself on a line of spears.  The solid
wall of water hurled me back and down, but as I fell my arms closed
on the spike.  There I hung while my feet were towed outwards
by the volume of the stream as if they had been dead leaves. 
I was half-stunned by the shock of the drip on my head, but I
kept my wits, and presently got my face outside the falling sheet
and breathed.</p>

<p>To get to my feet and stand on the spike while all the fury of
water was plucking at me was the hardest physical effort I have
ever made. It had to be done very circumspectly, for a slip would
send me into the abyss.  If I moved an arm or leg an inch too
near the terrible dropping wall I knew I should be plucked from
my hold.  I got my knees on the outer face of the spike, so that
all my body was removed as far as possible from the impact of
the water.  Then I began to pull myself slowly up.</p>

<p>I could not do it.  If I got my feet on the rock the effort would
bring me too far into the water, and that meant destruction. 
I saw this clearly in a second while my wrists were cracking with
the strain.  But if I had a wall behind me I could reach back
with one hand and get what we call in Scotland a 'stelf.'  I knew
there was a wall, but how far I could not judge. The perpetual
hammering of the stream had confused my wits.</p>

<p>It was a horrible moment, but I had to risk it.  I knew that
if the wall was too far back I should fall, for I had to let my
weight go till my hand fell on it.  Delay would do no good, so
with a prayer I flung my right hand back, while my left hand clutched
the spike.</p>

<p>I found the wall&mdash;it was only a foot or two beyond my reach. 
With a heave I had my foot on the spike, and turning, had both
hands on the opposite wall.  There I stood, straddling like a
Colossus over a waste of white waters, with the cave floor far
below me in the gloom, and my discarded axe lying close to a splash
of Laputa's blood.</p>

<p>The spectacle made me giddy, and I had to move on or fall. The
wall was not quite perpendicular, but as far as I could see a
slope of about sixty degrees.  It was ribbed and terraced pretty
fully, but I could see no ledge within reach which offered standing
room.  Once more I tried the moral support of the rope, and as
well as I could dropped a noose on the spike which might hold
me if I fell.  Then I boldly embarked on a hand traverse, pulling
myself along a little ledge till I was right in the angle of the
fall.  Here, happily, the water was shallower and less violent,
and with my legs up to the knees in foam I managed to scramble
into a kind of corner.  Now at last I was on the wall of the gully,
and above the cave.  I had achieved by amazing luck one of the
most difficult of all mountaineering operations.  I had got out
of a cave to the wall above.</p>

<p>My troubles were by no means over, for I found the cliff most
difficult to climb.  The great rush of the stream dizzied my brain,
the spray made the rock damp, and the slope steepened as I advanced. 
At one overhang my shoulder was almost in the water again.  All
this time I was climbing doggedly, with terror somewhere in my
soul, and hope lighting but a feeble lamp.  I was very distrustful
of my body, for I knew that at any moment my weakness might return. 
The fever of three days of peril and stress is not allayed by
one night's rest.</p>

<p>By this time I was high enough to see that the river came out
of the ground about fifty feet short of the lip of the gully,
and some ten feet beyond where I stood.  Above the hole whence
the waters issued was a loose slope of slabs and screes. It looked
an ugly place, but there I must go, for the rock-wall I was on
was getting unclimbable.</p>

<p>I turned the corner a foot or two above the water, and stood
on a slope of about fifty degrees, running from the parapet of
stone to a line beyond which blue sky appeared.  The first step
I took the place began to move.  A boulder crashed into the fall,
and tore down into the abyss with a shattering thunder.  I lay
flat and clutched desperately at every hold, but I had loosened
an avalanche of earth, and not till my feet were sprayed by the
water did I get a grip of firm rock and check my descent.  All
this frightened me horribly, with the kind of despairing angry
fear which I had suffered at Bruderstroom, when I dreamed that
the treasure was lost.  I could not bear the notion of death when
I had won so far.</p>

<p>After that I advanced, not by steps, but by inches.  I felt more
poised and pinnacled in the void than when I had stood on the
spike of rock, for I had a substantial hold neither for foot nor
hand.  It seemed weeks before I made any progress away from the
lip of the waterhole.  I dared not look down, but kept my eyes
on the slope before me, searching for any patch of ground which
promised stability.  Once I found a scrog of juniper with firm
roots, and this gave me a great lift.  A little further, however,
I lit on a bank of screes which slipped with me to the right,
and I lost most of the ground the bush had gained me.  My whole
being, I remember, was filled with a devouring passion to be quit
of this gully and all that was in it.</p>

<p>Then, not suddenly as in romances, but after hard striving and
hope long deferred, I found myself on a firm outcrop of weathered
stone.  In three strides I was on the edge of the plateau.  Then
I began to run, and at the same time to lose the power of running. 
I cast one look behind me, and saw a deep cleft of darkness out
of which I had climbed. Down in the cave it had seemed light enough,
but in the clear sunshine of the top the gorge looked a very pit
of shade.  For the first and last time in my life I had vertigo. 
Fear of falling back, and a mad craze to do it, made me acutely
sick.  I managed to stumble a few steps forward on the mountain
turf, and then flung myself on my face.</p>

<p>When I raised my head I was amazed to find it still early morning. 
The dew was yet on the grass, and the sun was not far up the sky. 
I had thought that my entry into the cave, my time in it, and
my escape had taken many hours, whereas at the most they had occupied
two.  It was little more than dawn, such a dawn as walks only
on the hilltops. Before me was the shallow vale with its bracken
and sweet grass, and farther on the shining links of the stream,
and the loch still grey in the shadow of the beleaguering hills. 
Here was a fresh, clean land, a land for homesteads and orchards
and children.  All of a sudden I realized that at last I had come
out of savagery. The burden of the past days slipped from my shoulders. 
I felt young again, and cheerful and brave.  Behind me was the
black night, and the horrid secrets of darkness.  Before me was
my own country, for that loch and that bracken might have been
on a Scotch moor.  The fresh scent of the air and the whole morning
mystery put song into my blood.  I remembered that I was not yet
twenty. My first care was to kneel there among the bracken and
give thanks to my Maker, who in very truth had shown me 'His goodness
in the land of the living.'</p>

<p>After a little I went back to the edge of the cliff.  There where
the road came out of the bush was the body of Henriques, lying
sprawled on the sand, with two dismounted riders looking hard
at it.  I gave a great shout, for in the men I recognized Aitken
and the schoolmaster Wardlaw.</p>
