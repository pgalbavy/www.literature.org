<p>BY the time the Bobolink youngsters were beginning to learn to fly
Mrs. Bobolink noticed something about her husband that caused her
some uneasiness. Bobby Bobolink was unusually jolly. And since his
wife didn't know of anything to make him feel happier than he had
always been, she couldn't help worrying for fear something was
troubling him. For Bobby Bobolink almost never let anything dash
his high spirits. He often said that there was nothing so uplifting
as a rousing song--unless it was a good pair of wings!
</p>
<p>Mrs. Bobolink thought and thought. But so far as she could see
everything was going smoothly. Already the children gave promise
of becoming fine fliers, taking as naturally to the air as ducks
to water. And it was a great year for grasshoppers; so Bobby
Bobolink couldn't be worrying about a scarcity of food.
</p><p>Bobby's wife thought of this, that and the other thing. But she could
hit on nothing that wasn't exactly as it should be. So at last she
decided to ask her husband what it was that was troubling him and
making him so remarkably cheerful.
</p><p>"I don't like to upset you, my dear," he said in response to her
question. "But I may as well tell you that we ought to move at the
earliest possible moment."
</p><p>"Move!" she cried. "Oh, no! I don't want to move. I'm quite contented
with this house. It's in just the place I like."
</p><p>"I'm sorry," said Bobby. "But we shall have to move all the same. And
when I tell you why, I think you'll agree with me that the sooner we
move the better it will be for us."
</p><p>Little Mrs. Bobolink replied very firmly that she would have to hear a
good reason before she would consent to move an inch.
</p><p>So Bobby told her. "Haying time has come!"
</p><p>"What of that?" his wife inquired. "Farmer Green doesn't expect us to
help him, does he?"
</p><p>"Oh, no!" Bobby answered with a short laugh. "But he'll cut the grass
all over the meadow. And even if our children should escape with their
lives, there's still Henry Hawk to think of. He could see them easily
enough, with the grass all gone from above the nest."
</p><p>That was reason enough for Mrs. Bobolink. She wanted to move right
away. But there was something to prevent that.
</p><p>"We certainly can't leave here till the children have learned to fly
better than they do now," she said. "But as soon as they can handle
themselves well enough we'll go. We'll know--won't we--when Farmer Green
begins to mow?"
</p><p>"Indeed we will!" Bobby cried. "The mowing-machine makes a terrible
clatter. And we'll have to quit the neighborhood in a hurry when we hear
it, for it moves fast, and cuts the grass down like fire."
</p><p>Mrs. Bobolink was all a-flutter. And she spent so much time teaching her
children to fly that they learned surprisingly fast. By the time an odd
<u>clackety-clack</u> sounded across the meadow early one fine morning the
Bobolink family was all ready to move.
</p><p>Mrs. Bobolink was gathering her children hastily about her when Bobby
came hurrying back from a trip to the farm buildings. He had seen--as
well as heard--the mowing-machine. And he knew there was no time to
waste.
</p><p>"Are you ready?" he called as he fluttered quickly down beside his
family.
</p><p>"Yes!" said Mrs. Bobolink.
</p><p>"You haven't forgotten anything?"
</p><p>She counted her children carefully before answering.
</p><p>"No!" she said. "There are five of them here." And then, a look of
dismay came over her face.
</p><p>"My goodness!" she exclaimed. "I've forgotten to pick out a place to
move to!"
