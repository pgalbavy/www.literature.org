<p>The distance was so slight that a score of strokes drove the
canoe to shore. Nothing in the nature of a path was to be seen,
and there was so much undergrowth that when Mike glided under
the vegetation, only the rear of the boat was visible to any one
on the lake. He drew the craft up the bank far enough to prevent
its floating away during his absence, and began picking his way
through the bushes. A few rods and the wood grew more open, though
not being much accustomed to that sort of traveling, he made considerable
noise in his progress. He was thus engaged with his head bent
and his arms thrust out in front feeling his way, when a low horizontal
limb slid under his chin and as it almost lifted him off his feet
brought him to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>"Worrah! I wonder if me hid is left on me shoulders!" he exclaimed,
vigorously rubbing his neck; "yis,—the most of me is here, as
Tarn Murry said whin he came down after being blowed up in a powder
mill."</p>

<p>A few rods farther and he came upon a sight which caused him
to halt as abruptly as before, with a strong inclination to turn
about and go back to his canoe.</p>

<p>In a small open space a fire of pine cones, twigs and branches
was burning beside the trunk of a fallen tree. Resting on the
top of the blaze was a tomato can, filled with bubbling coffee,
whose aroma reached the nostrils of Mike at the moment he caught
sight of the fire. On the log sat a ragged, frowsy tramp, with
a crooked stick in his hand tending the blaze, while on the ground
half lying down and half sitting up, was a second vagrant sucking
a corncob pipe.</p>

<p>You remember the two nuisances who called upon Dr. Spellman and
because of their insolence were sharply rebuffed by him, though
his wife, in the kindness of her heart, gave them food. These
were the same hoboes, who it will be noted had not as yet wandered
far from the physician’s home. You remember, too, their characteristic
names,—Buzby Biggs and Saxy Hutt. Lazy, shiftless, dirty, rugged
of frame, thieves and unmitigated pests, they were straggling
through this part of Maine, in mortal dread of two afflictions,—work
and a bath. They were ready to suffer harsh treatment and privation
rather than submit to either.</p>

<p>Mike’s sensitiveness revolted at sight of them, but before he
could turn away, both of the men, who must have heard his approach,
raised their heads and looked toward him. Hutt, who was smoking
the pipe, slowly rose to his feet, stretched his arms over his
head, and beckoned with his grimy forefinger.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my lord!" he called in his husky voice; "wilt thou
not come into our baronial castle and partake of a flagon of wine
with us?"</p>

<p>The grotesqueness of the invitation appealed to Mike and he walked
forward, recalling that he had not his buckthorn cane with him.
Had he gone for a tramp through the woods he would have held it
in his hand, but it was in his way when using the canoe. He never
carried firearms, for to do so is to disobey one of the strictest
rules of the Boy Scouts, besides which, as you know, an Irishman
believes in the use only of nature’s weapons, with the addition
perhaps now and then of a stout shillaleh. Not that Mike Murphy
expected any trouble with these men, but the thought which came
to him was natural under the circumstances.</p>

<p>He approached in his confident fashion, with a grin on his face,
halted a pace or two from the fire, and with the couple examining
him, made the Boy Scout salute.</p>

<p>"’Tis so kind of ye that I will halt a brief while and enj’y
the hospitality of the Knights of the Ragged Shirt and Dirty Face."</p>

<p>This was a pretty crisp salutation, but it need not be said that
Mike felt no more regard for the couple than do all respectable
persons. He remained standing and did not go nearer.</p>

<p>"Aren’t yer afraid of being arrested fur yer beauty, young man?"
asked Biggs with a grimace.</p>

<p>"Not while yersilves are in the counthry."</p>

<p>"Who are you anyway?"</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy of Southport, State of Maine. I would exchange cards
wid ye, but I’m afeard ye couldn’t return the compliment."</p>

<p>"I left my pasteboards at home on the piany. We gather from your
dress that you’re one of them Boy Patrols."</p>

<p>"Ye’re right, excipt jest now I’m on this side of the lake."</p>

<p>"Gee whizz! but you’re keen. How long do you chaps intend to
stay there?"</p>

<p>"Probably until we lave. We’re not among the folks who hev to
be kicked out by their betters."</p>

<p>"Meaning us?"</p>

<p>"As ye plaise; I want to be agreeable to ye."</p>

<p>Mike had not shown tact. He ought to have reflected that it was
imprudent to rouse the resentment of two full grown men of so
lawless a character as these tramps undoubtedly were. Combative
as Mike was by nature, he would have hardly been the equal of
one of them in a "shindy" which could be easily started and which
it seemed he had set out to provoke.</p>

<p>"I observe," said Biggs, "that you have a brass chain dangling
from yer coat pocket in front; does the same signify that there’s
a watch anchored at t’other end?"</p>

<p>Mike answered the question by flipping out his time piece and
displaying it.</p>

<p>"The best Waterbury chronometer made,—price a dollar and a half."</p>

<p>"I should like to borrer the same for my pal and me."</p>

<p>"I’m thinking ye would like to borrer a good many things ye can’t;
I carry a little loose change in me pocket. Mebbe you’d like to
borrer the same?"</p>

<p>"Yer guessed it the fust time; while yer turning over that turnip
and chain yer may as well h’ist out the few pennies in yer garments."</p>

<p>The tramp took a step toward the lad, his companion grinningly
watching proceedings.</p>

<p>The words and manner of Biggs left no doubt that he meant to
rob Mike of his watch and money,—though neither was of much value.
Was the Irish youth angry? I cannot do justice to his feelings,
so let us try to imagine his state of mind.</p>

<p>Prudence demanded that he should try to conciliate the scamps,
or, failing in that, to dash off at the top of his speed, but
two reasons checked this course. You know he was not formed for
running, and either one of the tramps could have overtaken him
by half trying. The other reason was that Mike never ran from
any foe. He would die fighting before showing the white feather.
Convinced that nothing could avert a fierce struggle, he instantly
prepared for it. He would have felt better had his shillaleh been
in his grasp, but it has already been shown that his only weapons
were those which nature had furnished and no youth of his years
could have known better how to use them.</p>

<p>I should be distressed if I had to describe Mike’s fight with
two full grown men, for it was impossible that he should not get
much the worst of it. While it may be a relief to picture one
in his situation as baffling, if not defeating two burly despoilers,
yet to do so would be contrary to truth.</p>

<p>The youth recoiled a single step, closed his fists and assumed
an attitude of defense. Saxy Hutt, still stood grinningly listening
and watching. As he viewed the situation it was preposterous to
think his pal would need his help. None the less, he would be
quick to give it should the call be made.</p>

<p>"Come on as soon as ye plaise, and I’d as lief take both as one;
don’t kaap me waiting."</p>

<p>"Hear him talk," said Biggs, still advancing, though more slowly
than before; "he makes believe he ain’t scared half to death."</p>

<p>"Ye’ll be thankful in less nor a minute if ye’re allowed to escape
wid yer life."</p>

<p>This sounded like the wildest kind of boasting, but it was justified.
Since Mike Murphy faced the two tramps, he saw what was behind
them, which they did not. In a direct line with Biggs, slightly
to the left of Saxy, and no more than a dozen paces to the rear,
stood Dr. Spellman with leveled revolver and face red with anger.</p>

<p>"Move a little to one side, Mike, so I shall run no risk of hitting
you," called the physician; "just now you’re right in line with
that ruffian."</p>

<p>Buzby Biggs leaped fully a foot in air, and with a gasp flashed
his head about and stared at the point whence the dreadful voice
had come. Then his spiky hair seemed to rise on end and lift his
dilapidated hat to a height of several inches.</p>

<p>"Shall I wing him, Mike?" asked the doctor, with the weapon still
at a level.</p>

<p>"Folly yer own plisure in that regard; I don’t begrudge ye the
enj’yment, as Mrs. O’Flaherty remarked whin she refoosed to fire
at the bear that was chasing her husband."</p>

<p>At that instant, Biggs emitted a howl, and with what was left
of his fragmentary hat fluttering to the ground, dashed in a headlong
panic through the wood and undergrowth toward the lake.</p>

<p>The sharp crack of the Smith and Wesson rang out, and the fugitive
made another bound in air, as if he felt the sting of the bullet,
and dived out of sight.</p>

<p>"I missed him on purpose," remarked the doctor; "he isn’t worth
a cartridge, but I’m undecided about you."</p>

<p>As he spoke he shifted his aim to Saxy Hutt, who was a-tremble
with fear.</p>

<p>"I—I—I’ve got an engagement," he stuttered, beginning to shamble
in the direction taken by his companion; "I’ll bid you good day."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" sharply commanded his master; "wait till I decide
what’s best to do with you."</p>

<p>"Why—why, boss, I haven’t done anything."</p>

<p>And too weak to stand in his excessive terror, Saxy sagged back
and sat down heavily on the log. Mike could not help pitying him.</p>

<p>"It was t’other spalpeen that meant to rob me, docther."</p>

<p>"One is as bad as the other; this one would have helped had it
been necessary."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor," protested the aggrieved Saxy, "how can yer think
such a crool thing of a gentleman like me? I was just going to
stop Buzby when yer spoke up."</p>

<p>The physician lowered his weapon with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Off with you! I hope never to see the face of yourself or Buzby
again. You may drink your coffee if you wish before you leave."</p>

<p>But the tramp had lost his thirst as well as his appetite for
the time. He came unsteadily to his feet, and began moving gingerly
over the trail of his companion.</p>

<p>"I say, doctor," he said, pausing a few steps away, "if you feel
like firing off that little thing in your hand, please p’int t’other
way."</p>

<p>"I shall take your request into consideration, but don’t advise
you to bank on my granting it."</p>

<p>Saxy increased his pace until it equalled that of him who had
gone before. Dr. Spellman extended his hand to Mike.</p>

<p>"I hope that is the last of them. I supposed they left the neighborhood,
but they will do so now."</p>

<p>"Why do ye think that, docther?"</p>

<p>"Heretofore we had nothing positive to bring against them. Now
I can bear witness that they tried to rob you. They know it and
have no wish to go to jail while the weather is so pleasant outside.
Let’s sit down on this log for a wee bit, before going to my house.
Tell me how you came to be in this place."</p>

<p>"I was on me way from Uncle Elk’s cabin whin the smoke of this
camp caused me to turn aside, wid the result that I’d been mixed
up in the biggest shindy of me life if ye hadn’t took it in yer
head to spoil the picnic."</p>

<p>"It was mighty lucky for you that I did so, Mike. Did Uncle Elk
send any message to me?"</p>

<p>"He did that," gravely replied Mike, who thereupon told his friend
of the assertion of the hermit that he and the physician must
not meet.</p>

<p>"I had begun to suspect some such feeling on his part, though
not to the degree he shows. I have called there twice, the last
time with my wife, who insists that the old man was in his cabin
at the time and purposely kept out of our sight. He can depend
upon it that I shall not put myself in his way, though I am wholly
at a loss to understand his enmity. But we may as well go to the
house, Mike."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the doctor rose to his feet, and the two began threading
their way through the wood to the point where Mike had left his
canoe. </p>
