<p>A rascally face was Wilfred Rolleston's, but above all a drunkard's
face, in which the noble features of his cousin Edward were debased by
the habit of debauch. His eyes, which were small and sunk in their
sockets, shone with an extraordinary glitter. A continual grin, which
revealed red gums set with enormous, pointed teeth, gave his jaw the
look of a gorilla's.
</p><p>He burst out laughing:
</p><p>"M. Simon Dubosc? M. Simon Dubosc will pardon me. Before I deal with
him, I have a few poor fellows to dispatch to a better world. I shall
attend to you in three minutes, M. Simon Dubosc."
</p><p>And, turning to his henchman:
</p><p>"First gentleman."
</p><p>They pushed forward a poor devil quaking with fear.
</p><p>"How much gold has this one stolen?" he asked.
</p><p>One of the warders replied:
</p><p>"Two sovereigns, my lord, fallen outside the barricades."
</p><p>"Kill him."
</p><p>A revolver-shot; and the poor wretch fell dead.
</p><p>Three more executions followed, performed in as summary a fashion; and
at each the executioners and their assistants were seized with a fit
of hilarity which found expression in cheers and the cutting of many
capers.
</p><p>But when the fourth sufferer's turn came--he had stolen nothing, but
was under suspicion of stealing--the executioner's revolver missed
fire. Then Rolleston leapt from his throne, uncoiled his great height,
towered above his victim's head and buried his knife between his
shoulder-blades.
</p><p>It was a moment of delirious delight. The guard of honour yelped and
roared, dancing a frantic jig upon the platform. Rolleston resumed his
throne.
</p><p>After this, an axe cleft the air twice in succession and two heads
leapt into the air.
</p><p>All these monsters gave the impression of the court of some nigger
monarch in the heart of Africa. Liberated from all that restrains its
impulses and controls its actions, left to itself, with no fear of
the police, mankind, represented by this gang of cut-throats, was
relapsing into its primitive animal state. Instinct reigned supreme,
in all its fierce absurdity. Rolleston, the drink-sodden chieftain of
a tribe of savages, was killing for killing's sake, because killing is
a pleasure not to be indulged in everyday life and because the sight
of blood intoxicated him more effectually than champagne.
</p><p>"It's the Frenchman's turn"; cried the despot, bursting into laughter.
"It's M. Dubosc's turn! And I will deal with him myself!"
</p><p>He stepped down from his throne again, holding a red knife in his
hand, and planted himself before Simon:
</p><p>"Ah, M. Dubosc," he said, in a husky voice, "you escaped me the first
time, in a hotel at Hastings! Yes, it appears I stabbed the wrong man.
That was a bit of luck for you! But then, my dear sir, why the deuce,
instead of making yourself scarce, do you come running after me . . .
and after Miss Bakefield?"
</p><p>At Isabel's name, he suddenly blazed into fury:
</p><p>"Miss Bakefield! My <u>fiancée</u>! Don't you know that I love her! Miss
Bakefield! Why, I've sworn by all the devils in hell that I would
bury my knife in the back of my rival, if ever one dared to come
forward. And you're the rival, are you, M. Dubosc? But, my poor fool,
you shouldn't have let yourself get caught!"
</p><p>His eyes lit up with a cruel joy. He slowly raised his arm, while
gazing into Simon's eyes for the first appearance of mortal anguish.
But the moment had not yet come, for he suddenly stayed the movement
of his arm and sputtered:
</p><p>"I have an idea! . . . An idea . . . not half a bad one! . . . No, not
half! Look here. . . . M. Dubosc must attend the little ceremony! He
will be glad to know that the lot of his dear Isabel is assured.
Patience, M. Dubosc!"
</p><p>He exchanged a few words with his guards, who gave signs of their
hearty approval and were at once rewarded with glasses of champagne.
Then the preparations began. Three guards marched away, while the
other satellites seated the dead bodies in a circle, so as to form a
gallery of spectators round a small table which was placed upon the
platform.
</p><p>Simon was one of the gallery. He was again gagged.
</p><p>All these incidents occurred like the scenes of an incoherent play,
stage-managed and performed by madmen. It had no more sense than the
fantastic visions of a nightmare; and Simon felt hardly more alarmed
at knowing that his life was threatened than he would have felt joy at
seeing himself saved. He was living in an unreal world of shifting
figures.
</p><p>The guard of honour fell in and presented arms. Rolleston took off his
diadem, as a man might take off his hat in sign of respect, and spread
his diamond-studded tunic on the deck, as people might spread flowers
beneath the feet of an advancing queen. The three attendants who had
been ordered away returned.
</p><p>Behind them came a woman escorted by two coarse, red-faced viragoes.
</p><p>Simon shuddered with despair; he had recognized Isabel, but so much
changed, so pale! She swayed as she walked, as though her limbs
refused to support her and as though her poor distressful eyes could
not see plainly. Yet she refused the aid of her companions. A male
prisoner followed her, held on a leash like the others. He was an old,
white-haired parson.
</p><p>Rolleston hurried to meet her whom he called his <u>fiancée</u>, offering
her his hand and leading her to a chair. He resumed his tunic and took
his place beside her. The clergyman remained standing behind the
table, under the threat of a revolver.
</p><p>The ceremony, of which the details must have been arranged beforehand,
was short. The parson stammered the customary words. Rolleston
declared that he took Isabel Bakefield to be his wife. Isabel, when
the question was put, bowed her head in assent, Rolleston slipped a
wedding-ring upon her finger; then he unfastened from his uniform the
miniature set in pearls and pinned it to the girl's bodice:
</p><p>"My wedding-present, darling," he said, cynically.
</p><p>And he kissed her hand. She seemed overcome with dizziness and
collapsed for a moment, but recovered herself immediately.
</p><p>"Till this evening, darling," said Rolleston, "when your loving
husband will visit you and claim his rights. Till this evening,
darling."
</p><p>He made a sign to the two viragoes to lead their prisoner away.
</p><p>A few bottles of champagne were opened, the clergyman received a
dagger-thrust as his fee and Rolleston, waving his glass and
staggering on his legs, shouted:
</p><p>"Here's the health of my wife! What do you say to that, M. Dubosc?
She'll be a lucky girl, eh? To-night makes her King Rolleston's bride!
You may die easy, M. Dubosc."
</p><p>He drew near, knife in hand, when suddenly there broke out, from the
arena, a succession of crackling noises, followed by a great uproar.
The fireworks were beginning again, as on the night before.
</p><p>In a moment the scene was changed. Rolleston appeared to sober down at
once. Leaning over the side of the wreck, he issued his commands in a
voice of thunder:
</p><p>"To the barricades! Every man to his post! . . . Independent fire! No
quarter!"
</p><p>The deck resounded with the feet of his adherents, who rushed to the
ladders. Some, the favoured members of the guard of honour, remained
with Rolleston. The remaining captives were tied together and more
cords were added to the bonds that bound Simon to the foot of the
mast.
</p><p>However, he was able to turn his head and to see the whole extent of
the arena. It was empty. But from one of the four craters which rose
in the centre a vast sheaf of water, steam, sand and pebbles spurted
and fell back upon the ground. In the midst of these pebbles rolled
coins of the same colour, gold coins.
</p><p>It was an inconceivable spectacle, reminding Simon of the Iceland
geyser. The phenomenon was obviously capable of explanation by
perfectly natural causes; but some miraculous chance must have heaped
together at the exact spot where this volcanic eruption occurred the
treasures of several galleons sunk in times gone by. And these
treasures, now dropping like rain on the surface of the earth, must
have slipped gradually to the bottom of the huge funnel in which the
new forces, concentrated and released by the great upheaval, were
boiling over now.
</p><p>Simon had an impression that the air was growing warmer and that the
temperature of this column of water must be fairly high, which fact,
even more than fear of the pebbles, explained why no one dared venture
into the central zone.
</p><p>Moreover, Rolleston's troops had taken up their position on the line
of the barricades, where the firing had been, furious from the first.
The mob of marauders, massed at a hundred yards beyond, had at once
given way, though here and there a band of lunatics would break loose
from the crowd and rush across the slope. They toppled over,
ruthlessly shot down; but others came on, bellowing, maddened by those
golden coins which fell like a miraculous rain and some of which
rolled to their feet.
</p><p>These men in their turn spun on their heels and dropped. It was a
murderous game, an absolute massacre. The more favoured, those who
escaped the bullets, were taken prisoners on the line of the
barricades and set aside for execution.
</p><p>And suddenly all grew quiet again. Like a fountain when the water is
turned off, the precious sheaf wavered, grew smaller and smaller and
disappeared from sight. The troops remaining at the barricades
completed the rout of the assailants, while the satellites who made up
the guard of honour gathered the gold in rush baskets collected at the
fore of the wreck on which Rolleston was performing his antics. The
harvest did not take long. The baskets were brought up briskly and the
sharing began, a revolting and grotesque spectacle. Eyes burned with
greed, hands trembled. The sight, the touch, the sound of the gold
drove all these men mad. No famishing beasts of prey, disputing a
bleeding quarry, could display greater ferocity and spite. Each man
hid his booty in his pockets or in a handkerchief knotted at the
corners. Rolleston put his into a canvas bag which he held clasped in
his arms:
</p><p>"Kill the prisoners, the new ones as well as the others!" he shouted,
relapsing into drunkenness. "Have them executed! After that, we'll
string them all up, so that they can be seen from everywhere and
nobody will dare attack us. Kill them comrades! And M. Dubosc to begin
with! Who'll attend to M. Dubosc? I haven't the energy myself."
</p><p>The comrades rushed forward. One of them, more agile than the rest,
seized Simon by the throat, jammed his head against the broken mast
and, pressing the barrel of his revolver against his temple, fired
four times.
</p><p>"Well done!" cried Rolleston! "Well done!"
</p><p>"Well done!" cried the others, stamping with rage around the
executioner.
</p><p>The man had covered Simon's head with a strip of cloth already spotted
with blood, which he knotted round the mast, so that its ends, brought
level with the forehead and turned upwards, looked like a donkey's
ear, which provoked an explosion of merriment.
</p><p>Simon did not feel the least surprise on discovering that he was
still alive, that he had not even been wounded by those four shots
fired point-blank. This was the way of the incredible nightmare, a
succession of illogical acts and disconnected events which he could
neither foresee nor understand. In the very article of death, he was
saved by circumstances as absurd as those which had led him to death's
threshold. An unloaded weapon, an impulse of pity in his executioners:
no explanation gave a satisfactory reply.
</p><p>In any case, he did not make a movement which might attract attention
and he remained like a corpse within the bonds which held him fixed in
a perpendicular position and behind the veil which hid his face, the
face of a living man.
</p><p>The hideous tribunal resumed its functions and hurried over its
verdicts, while washing them down with copious libations. As each
victim was condemned, a glass of spirits was served, the tossing off
of which was meant to synchronize with a death-struggle. Foul jests,
blasphemies, laughter, songs, all mingled in an abominable din which
was dominated by Rolleston's piercing voice:
</p><p>"Now have them hanged. Tell them to string up the corpses! Fire away,
comrades! I want to see them dancing at the end of their ropes when I
come back from my wife. The queen awaits me! Here's her health,
comrades!"
</p><p>They touched glasses noisily, singing until they had escorted him to
the ladder; then they returned and immediately set to work upon the
loathsome business which Rolleston had judged necessary to terrorize
the distant crowd of marauders. Their jeers and exclamations enabled
Simon to follow the sickening incidents of their labours. The dead
were hanged, with head or feet downwards alternately, from everything
that projected from the ship's deck or its surroundings; and
flagstaffs were stuck between their arms, with a blood-soaked rag
floating from each.
</p><p>Simon's turn was approaching. A few dead bodies at most divided him
from the executioners, whose hoarse breathing he could hear. This time
nothing could save him. Whether he was hanged, or stabbed the moment
they saw that he was still alive, the issue was inevitable.
</p><p>He would have made no attempt to escape, if the thought of Isabel and
Rolleston's threats had not exasperated him. He reflected that at that
moment Rolleston, the drunkard and maniac, was with the girl who for
years had been the object of his desire. What could she do against
him? Captive and bound, she was a prey vanquished beforehand.
</p><p>Simon growled with rage. He contracted his muscles in the impossible
hope of bursting his bonds. The period of waiting suddenly became
intolerable; and he preferred to draw upon himself the anger of all
those brutes and to risk a fight which might at least give him a
chance of safety. And would not his safety mean Isabel's release?
</p><p>Something unexpected, the sensation of a touch that was not brutal
but, on the contrary, furtive and cautious, gently persuaded him to
silence. A hand behind his back was untying his hands and removing the
ropes which held him bound against the mast, while an almost inaudible
voice whispered in his ear:
</p><p>"Not a movement! . . . Not a word! . . ."
</p><p>The cloth around his head was slowly withdrawn. The voice continued:
</p><p>"Behave as if you were one of the gang. . . . No one is thinking about
you. . . . Do as they do. . . . And, above all, no hesitation!"
</p><p>Simon obeyed without turning round. Two executioners, not far away,
were picking up a corpse. Sustained by the thought that nothing must
disgust him if he meant to rescue Isabel, he joined them and helped
them to carry their burden and hang it from one of the iron davits.
</p><p>But the effort exhausted him: he was tortured by hunger and thirst. He
turned giddy and was seeking for a support when some one gently seized
his arm and drew him toward Rolleston's platform.
</p><p>It was a sailor, with bare feet and dressed in a blue serge pea-jacket
and trousers; he carried a rifle across his back and wore a bandage
which hid part of his face.
</p><p>Simon whispered:
</p><p>"Antonio!"
</p><p>"Drink!" said the Indian, taking one of the bottles of champagne; "and
look here . . . here's a tin of biscuits. You'll need all your
strength. . . ."
</p><p>After the shocks of the frightful nightmare in which he had been
living for thirty-six hours, Simon was hardly capable of surprise.
That Antonio should have succeeded in slipping among the gang of
criminals accorded, after all, with the logic of events, since the
Indian's object was just to be revenged on Rolleston.
</p><p>"Did you fire at me with a blank cartridge?" asked Simon, "and saved
my life?"
</p><p>"Yes," replied the Indian. "I got here yesterday, when Rolleston was
already beginning to drive back the mob of three or four thousand
ruffians crowding round the fountains. As he was recruiting all who
possessed fire-arms and as I had a rifle, I was enlisted. Since then,
I've been prowling right and left, in the trenches which they've dug,
in the wrecks, more or less everywhere. I happened to be near his
platform when they brought him the papers found on the airman; and I
learnt, as he did, that the airman was no other than yourself. Then I
watched my opportunity and offered myself as an executioner when it
came to a matter of killing you. But I didn't dare warn you in his
presence."
</p><p>"He's with Miss Bakefield, isn't he?" asked Simon anxiously.
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Were you able to communicate with her?"
</p><p>"No, but I know where she is."
</p><p>"Let's hurry," said Simon.
</p><p>Antonio held him back:
</p><p>"One word. What has become of Dolores?"
</p><p>He looked Simon straight in the eyes.
</p><p>"Dolores left me," Simon replied.
</p><p>"Why?" asked Antonio, in a harsh voice. "Yes, why? A woman alone, in
this country: it's certain death! And you deserted her?"
</p><p>Simon did not lower his eyes. He replied:
</p><p>"I did my duty by Dolores . . . more than my duty. It was she who left
me."
</p><p>Antonio reflected. Then he said:
</p><p>"Very good. I understand."
</p><p>They moved away, unobserved by the rabble of henchmen and
executioners. The boat--a Channel packet whose name Simon read on a
faded pennant: the <u>Ville de Dunkerque</u>; and he remembered that the
<u>Ville de Dunkerque</u> had been sunk at the beginning of the
upheaval--the boat had not suffered much damage and her hull was
barely heeling over to starboard. The deck was empty between the
funnels and the poop. They were passing the hatch of a companion-way
when Antonio said:
</p><p>"That's Rolleston's lair."
</p><p>"If so, let's go down," said Simon, who was quivering with
impatience.
</p><p>"Not yet; there are five or six accomplices in the gangway, besides
the two women guarding Lord Bakefield and his daughter. Come on."
</p><p>A little farther, they stopped in front of a large tarpaulin, still
soaked with water, which covered one of those frames on which the
passengers' bags and trunks are stacked. He lifted the tarpaulin and
slipped under it, beckoning to Simon to lie down beside him.
</p><p>"Look," he said.
</p><p>The frame contained a skylight protected by stout bars, through which
they saw down into the long gangway skirting the cabins immediately
below the deck. In this gangway a man was seated with two women beside
him. When Simon's eyes had become accustomed to the semidarkness which
showed objects somewhat vaguely, he distinguished the man's features
and recognized Lord Bakefield, bound to a chair and guarded by the two
viragoes whom Rolleston had placed in charge of Isabel. One of these
women held in her heavy hand, which pressed on Lord Bakefield's
throat, the two ends of a cord passed round his neck. It was clear
that a sudden twist of this hand would be enough to strangle the
unfortunate nobleman in the space of a few seconds.
