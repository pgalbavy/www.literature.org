<p>Wharton Edwards was not long finding that for which he was seeking.
While feeling his way among the trees, with all his senses on
the alert, a point of light suddenly flashed out in the gloom.
It was directly ahead, and he had but to penetrate a short distance
farther, when he came in sight of the camp-fire of the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>He approached with great care, and halted at what he deemed a
safe distance to study the characteristic scene before him.</p>

<p>Careful counting, repeated several times, showed eleven Indian
warriors gathered together about a mass of burning wood, which
was kindled in a small open space. Upon a fallen tree were seated
four of them, while the rest were lolling on the ground in lazy
attitudes. Two seemed to be examining the locks of their guns,
and nearly all were smoking.</p>

<p>There were no signs of any food, but the lusty youth felt so
hungry that he was sure they must have had something to eat before
he came upon them. Game was so abundant in the country that it
was unreasonable to suppose any one would go hungry unless he
happened to be in a situation similar to that of the youth himself.</p>

<p>One fact gave Wharton a thrill of gratitude and hope; Larry was
not with the group of Indians, and, therefore, could not be a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Young Edwards had been under the impression that there were about
a score of Shawanoes with which he and Larry Murphy had collided,
but counting those that had fallen by the way, there were less.</p>

<p>The absence of the youth from the camp could not be a guarantee
of his weal, for he might have been stricken down in the woods,
but the sign had been so favorable that Wharton felt more hopeful
than at any time since their separation.</p>

<p>He was quick, however, to notice a significant fact: Blazing
Arrow was also absent.</p>

<p>"I would give anything to know where he is and what he is doing,"
thought the youth. "It may be that he is leaning against the tree
and still studying over the yarn that is to prevent the rest knowing
I outran him, but it is more likely he is prowling through the
woods after Larry and me."</p>

<p>The answer to this conjecture came suddenly and startlingly.
Wharton, not forgetting his caution, kept well back in the gloom,
with his body screened behind the trunk of a tree. He was attentively
watching the group around the camp-fire, when something moved
between him and the light, partly eclipsing it.</p>

<p>A second look showed the form of the twelfth Shawanoe, walking
silently toward the blaze; and, as he joined the others, and stood
so the firelight revealed his features, Wharton Edwards recognized
him as Blazing Arrow.</p>

<p>"He has struck it," muttered the youth. "He has got the yarn
in shape at last. I wish I could hear it, and find what sort of
a fancy he has."</p>

<p>The great runner was without any gun, and it was evident that
he must have wrenched his inventive powers to straighten out matters
so as to retain his prestige among these warlike people. His position
as a great warrior and the real leader of the party could not
fail to help in the test to which he was subjected.</p>

<p>The arrival of the dusky desperado caused a sensation. Every
face was turned, and those who were seated on the tree rose to
greet him. The silence in the wood allowed Wharton to hear their
gruff, jerky sentences, but since he did not understand a word
of Shawanoe, his ears were of no service.</p>

<p>One of the warriors extended a rifle to Blazing Arrow, who waved
it back until he, standing in the middle of the group, gave his
account of matters.</p>

<p>Some years later the settlers learned the particulars of this
amazing narrative. The great runner said he allowed the youth
to draw away from him for a time in order to put forth his best
efforts. When this had taken them to the natural clearing, with
which all were familiar, he started to run him down, and would
have done so before the open space was half crossed but for the
sudden appearance of five or six white men coming from the other
direction.</p>

<p>Of course the new comers were fully armed, but, nothing daunted,
the valiant Shawanoe assailed them. He brought down two, and would
have had the others at his mercy had not a shot broken the lock
of his gun. He then threw away the useless weapon, uttered a defiant
whoop, and strode back toward his own party, whither the whites
did not dare follow him.</p>

<p>It was one of the listeners to this stupendous statement who
told it to the pioneers. When asked whether he and the others
believed it, a shadowy smile lit up the dusky face, and he quaintly
replied that they tried to do so.</p>

<p>Having rendered his account, Blazing Arrow and several of his
comrades seated themselves on the fallen tree and engaged in an
animated talk, which lasted for a quarter of an hour or more.
The burden of it was that one of the whites was still near them,
and must not be permitted to steal along the trail in the direction
of the block-house, for if he succeeded in reaching that point
he would be safe against anything the Shawanoes could do.</p>

<p>The dusky prevaricator was cunning enough not to claim that he
had slain Wharton Edwards, for the youth, being alive, was liable
to turn up in a way that would throw discredit on his veracity.</p>

<p>The lad, who was looking on, could only conjecture the meaning
of what passed before his eyes. When he saw a couple of warriors
rise to their feet and come toward him, he supposed it was to
make hunt for him and his friends. He was made to realize, too,
the delicately dangerous position in which he stood.</p>

<p>When the figures plainly outlined against the illumination of
the camp-fire started, he fervently wished himself elsewhere.
He dared not stir, for, as if fate were dallying with him, a lot
of wood, thrown on the blaze within a few minutes before, threw
a circle of light to the base of the tree from behind which he
was cautiously peering. Had he started to withdraw, the two Shawanoes
would have been upon him in a twinkling. He could only wait where
he was, and hope they might pass by without detecting his presence.</p>

<p>He hardly breathed as he heard the rustling of their moccasins
on the leaves, and pressed his upright figure against the bark
as though he would force himself into the very structure of the
tree itself.</p>

<p>Fortunately the suspense quickly passed. If the couple were hunting
for him and his companion, they did not expect to find either
so near headquarters, and speedily vanished in the gloom beyond,
stepping so softly that their footfalls became inaudible.</p>

<p>This incident gave young Edwards a good scare. He felt that he
had run an unnecessary risk, and wasted time in staying so long
after learning that Larry was not with the main party of Indians.
More of these were likely to leave the camp, and the danger of
his position must increase.</p>

<p>Without delay, therefore, he began his retrograde movement. This
was easy, and he soon placed himself where he could feel comparatively
safe.</p>

<p>His curiosity led him to pick his way back to the torrent that
had been the scene of so many moving incidents of the afternoon.
He was somewhat confused as to the points of the compass, but
the faint roar was his guide, and with little trouble he placed
himself quite near the stream, which coursed between the rocks
with such impetuosity.</p>

<p>The youth was too prudent to advance into the moonlight, where
the prowlers were liable to see him, and so it happened that he
approached the rocks at a point that was new to him. To this fact
was due a surprise. He was just in time to see one Indian following
the other across the foot-bridge made by the prostrate tree.</p>

<p>"I never suspected that was there," he said to himself when he
comprehended its meaning; "I thought there was no means by which
Larry could make his way back to the trail without swimming below
the falls or fording some place farther up. I wonder whether he
knows about that?"</p>

<p>The action of the Indians gave Wharton a suspicion of the truth.
They had crossed the torrent with the intention of hiding somewhere
along the path leading to the block-house, so as to cut off the
flight of one or both of the boys in that direction. This, seemingly,
was an easy thing to do, provided the fugitives were unsuspicious
of what was going on.</p>

<p>Young Edwards saw no way of breaking through the maze of perplexity
that had closed around him. He had done his utmost without learning
where his friend was. More than that, although he was hopeful,
he could feel no certainty that he was really alive.</p>

<p>The occasion justified another appeal to the peculiar dove signal,
and he now made it.</p>
