<p>The compliment to the young Shawanoe, although rudely expressed,
was genuine, and at once dissipated the latent lightning that
was on the point of bursting forth.</p>

<p>The lowering eclipse that overspread the dusky countenance instantly
cleared away, and Deerfoot smiled more than before as he turned
toward Ned Preston to see how he accepted the remark of his servant.</p>

<p>The young pioneer was pleased, and, slapping the lad on the shoulder,
exclaimed heartily&mdash;</p>

<p>"You show your good sense there, Blossom; and after this, when
I hear the folks say you are the stupidest boy in all Kentucky,
I will quote what you have just said to prove they are mistaken."</p>

<p>Wildblossom raised his cap and scratched his head, somewhat doubtful
as to how he should accept this remark. While he was considering
the matter, Deerfoot and Ned faced each other, and talked concerning
more important matters.</p>

<p>The sun, which had been scarcely visible during the day, was
now below the horizon, and the shadows of night were creeping
through the autumn woods. The air continued chilly, and moaned
among the branches, from which the crisp leaves, turning from
bright yellow and flaming crimson to dull brown, were continually
drifting downward. The squirrels whisked from limb to limb, gathering
their winter store of nuts, and chattering their defiance from
the highest branches of elm, oak, ash, hickory, chestnut, or maple.</p>

<p>Now and then feathery particles of snow whirled around them,
so light and downy that they scarcely found their way to the leaves
below. It was the time of the sad and melancholy days, though
the most joyous one to the hunter.</p>

<p>Ned Preston had been told by Deerfoot that he was the only Indian
near them, and he was vastly relieved that the danger was found
to be scarcely any danger at all.</p>

<p>As it was becoming colder, and night was closing in, the boy
was anxious to go into camp. He could conceive of no reason why
they should push forward any further before morning, as he held
no suspicion of the critical condition of affairs.</p>

<p>But he quickly learned the truth from Deerfoot, who related,
in his pointed way, the story of the Wyandots under the fierce
war chief Waughtauk.</p>

<p>"And they are going to the block-house!" exclaimed the astonished
lad.</p>

<p>The young warrior nodded his head to signify there could be no
doubt of the fact.</p>

<p>"Then we had better turn around and go back to Wild Oaks as quickly
as we can."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot must hurry to Colonel Preston and tell him of the Wyandots,"
said the Shawanoe; "that is Deerfoot's first duty."</p>

<p>"Of course; I didn't expect you to go with us; we can make our
way home without help."</p>

<p>"But your feet wandered from the path only a few hours ago."</p>

<p>"We were careless, for we felt there was no need of haste," replied
young Preston; "that could not happen again, when we know such
a mistake might work us ill."</p>

<p>"But that was in the daytime; it is now night."</p>

<p>Ned felt the force of this fact, but he would not have hesitated
to start on the back trail without a minute's delay.</p>

<p>"When we found we were going wrong we could stop and wait till
the rising of the morning sun. I have several letters which you
can deliver to my uncle."</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head; he had another course in mind.</p>

<p>"We will go to the fort; you will hand the letters to the white
soldier; Deerfoot will show the way."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot knows best; we will follow in his footsteps."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe was pleased with the readiness of the young pioneer,
who, it must be stated, could not see the wisdom of the decision
of their guide.</p>

<p>If Waughtauk and his warriors were in the immediate vicinity
of the block-house, the boys must run great risk in an attempt
to enter the post. They could not reach the station ahead of the
Wyandots, and it would be a task of extreme difficulty to open
communication with Colonel Preston, even though he knew the loyalty
of the dusky ally of the whites.</p>

<p>Deerfoot would have a much better prospect of success alone than
if embarrassed by two companions, whom the other Indians would
consider in the light of the very game for which they were hunting.</p>

<p>It seemed to Ned that it would be far more prudent for the young
Shawanoe to take the letters and make his way through the trackless
forest, while Ned and Blossom spared no time or effort in returning
to Wild Oaks.</p>

<p>But the matchless subtlety and skill of Deerfoot were appreciated
by no one more than by young Preston, who unhesitatingly placed
himself under his charge.</p>

<p>But cheerfully as the wishes of the Shawanoe were acceded to
by the white boy, the African lad was anything but satisfied.
Of a sluggish temperament, he disliked severe exertion. He had
not only been on the tramp most of the day, but, during the last
half hour, had been forced to an exertion which had tired him
out; he therefore objected to a tramp that was likely to take
the better portion of the night.</p>

<p>"We'd better start a fire here," said he, "and den in de mornin'
we'll be fresh, and we can run all de way to de Lickin', and get
dar 'bout as soon as if we trabel all night and got tired most
to def."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe turned upon him in the dusky twilight, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brother with the face of the night may wait here; Deerfoot
and his friend will go on alone."</p>

<p>With which decisive remark he wheeled about, and, facing southwest,
strode off toward the block-house on the Licking.</p>

<p>"Wildblossom aint gwine to stay here, not if he knows hisself,
while you folks go to your destruction," exclaimed the servant,
falling into line.</p>

<p>The strange procession was under way at once. Deerfoot, as a
matter of course, took the lead, Ned Preston stepping close behind
him, while the African kept so near his young master that he trod
on his heels more than once.</p>

<p>The Shawnee displayed his marvellous woodcraft from the first.
Although the ground was thickly strewn with leaves, his soft moccasins
touched them as lightly as do the velvet paws of the tiger when
stealing through the jungle. Ned Preston took extreme care to
imitate him, and partially succeeded, but the large shoes of Blossom
Brown rumpled and tumbled the dry vegetation despite every effort
to avoid it.</p>

<p>It was not until reproved by Ned, and the gait was slackened,
that, to a certain extent, the noisy rustling was stopped.</p>

<p>There were no stars nor moon in the sky, there was no beaten
path to follow, and they were not on the bank nor along the watercourse
of any stream to guide them; but the dusky leader advanced as
unerringly as does the bloodhound when trailing the panting fugitive
through the marshy swamps and lowlands.</p>

<p>As the night deepened, Ned saw only dimly the figure of the lithe
and graceful young warrior in front. His shoulders were thrown
forward, and his head projected slightly beyond. This was his
attitude while on the trail, and when all his faculties were alert.
Eye and ear were strained to the highest tension, and the faint
cry of a bird or the flitting of a shadowy figure among the forest
arches would have been detected on the instant.</p>

<p>Ned Preston could catch the outlines of the scalp-lock and eagle
feathers, which took on a slightly waving motion in response to
the long, loping tread of the Indian; occasionally he could detect
a part of the quiver, fastened back of the shoulder, and the upper
portion of the long bow, which he carried unstrung in his right
hand.</p>

<p>Then there were moments when the guide was absolutely invisible,
and he moved with such silence that Ned feared he had left them
altogether. But he was there all the time, and the journey through
the desolate woods continued with scarcely an interruption.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deerfoot came to a halt, giving utterance at the same
moment to a sibilant sound as a warning to Ned Preston, who checked
himself with his chin almost upon the arrow-quiver. It was different
with Blossom, who bumped his nose against the shoulders of his
young master with such violence that Ned put up his hand to check
himself from knocking the guide off his feet.</p>

<p>Neither Ned nor Blossom had caught the slightest sound, and they
wondered what it was that had alarmed Deerfoot.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but all stood as motionless as the tree trunks
beside them, those behind waiting the pleasure of him who was
conducting them on this dangerous journey.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes (which seemed doubly that length) the
tableau lasted, during which the listening followers heard only
the soughing of the night-wind and the hollow murmur of the great
forest, which was like the voice of silence itself.</p>

<p>Then the faint rustle of the leaves beneath the moccasins of
the Shawanoe showed that he was moving forward again, and the
others resumed walking, with all the caution consistent with necessary
speed.</p>

<p>Fully a half mile was passed in this manner, the three advancing
like automata, with never a whisper or halt. Blossom, although
wearied and displeased, appreciated the situation too well to
express his feelings, or to attempt anything to which either of
the others would object.</p>

<p>"Dey aint likely to keep dis up for more dan a week," was the
thought which came to him; "and when I make up my mind to it,
I can stand it as long as bofe of 'em together."</p>

<p>However, Blossom had almost reached the protesting point, when
he heard the same warning hiss from the Shawanoe, and checked
himself just in time to avoid a collision with his young master.</p>

<p>The cause of this stoppage was apparent to all: they stood on
the bank of a creek a hundred yards wide, which it was necessary
to cross to reach the block-house. It ran into the Licking a number
of miles south, and so far below Fort Bridgman that there was
no way of "going round" it to reach the station.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the boys, when making the journey between
Wild Oaks and the block-house, to ferry themselves over on a raft
which they had constructed, and which was used on their return.
As they took a course each time which brought them to the same
point on the tributary, this was an easy matter. During the summer
they sometimes doffed their garments, and placing them and their
guns on a small float, swam over, pushing their property before
them.</p>

<p>The water was too cold to admit of any such course now, unless
driven to it by necessity; and as Deerfoot had brought them to
a point on the bank far removed from the usual ferrying place,
Ned concluded they were in an unpleasant predicament, to say the
least.</p>

<p>"How are we going to get across?" he asked, when they had stood
motionless several minutes looking down on the dim current flowing
at their feet.</p>

<p>"The creek is not wide; we can swim to the other shore."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that, for I have done it more than once;
but there is snow flying in the air, and it isn't a favorite season
with me to go in bathing."</p>

<p>A slight exclamation escaped the Shawanoe, which was probably
meant as an expression of contempt for the effeminacy of his white
friend.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he said nothing, nor did he, in point of fact,
mean to force the two to such a disagreeable experience.</p>

<p>"Wait till Deerfoot comes back."</p>

<p>As he uttered these words he moved down the bank, while Blossom
Brown threw himself on the ground, muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would like to wait here all night, and I hope he has gone
for some wood to kindle a fire."</p>

<p>"There is no likelihood of that," explained Ned, "for he is too
anxious to reach the block-house."</p>

<p>"I tink he is anxiouser dan&#11834;<em>See dat</em>!"</p>

<p>At that moment the dip of a paddle was heard, and the lads caught
the faint outlines of a canoe stealing along the stream close
to the shore. In it was seated a single warrior, who did not sway
his body in the least as he dipped the paddle first on one side
the frail boat and then on the other.</p>

<p>"He's arter us!" whispered Blossom, cocking his rifle.</p>

<p>"Of course he is; it's Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"I forgot all about dat," said the lad, lowering his piece, with
no little chagrin.</p>

<p>Ned Preston now cautiously descended the bank, followed by Blossom,
and while the Shawanoe held the craft against the shore, they
stepped within, Ned placing himself in the bow, while his companion
took a seat at the stern.</p>

<p>Then, while Deerfoot deftly poised himself in the middle, he
lightly dipped the ashen paddle alternately on the right and left,
sending the canoe forward as gracefully as a swallow.</p>

<p>"Whose boat is that?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"It belongs to some Pottawatomie," answered the Shawanoe, speaking
with a confidence which showed he held no doubt in the matter,
though he might have found it hard to tell his companions the
precise means by which he gained the information.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, instead of speeding directly across, headed south,
as though he meant to follow the stream to its confluence with
the Licking. Suspecting he was not aware of his mistake, Blossom
deemed it his duty to remind him of it.</p>

<p>"You are gwine de wrong way, if you did but know it, Deerfoot;
de oder side am ober dar."</p>

<p>Perhaps the young Shawanoe indulged in a quiet smile; if so,
he made no other sign, but continued down the creek with arrowy
swiftness for two or three hundred yards, when he began verging
toward the other shore.</p>

<p>Ned Preston made no remark, but alternately peered ahead to discern
where they were going, and back, that he might admire the grace
and skill with which the Indian propelled the light structure.</p>

<p>All at once, with a sweep of the paddle, the boat was whirled
around with such suddenness that Blossom Brown thought they were
going to upset and be precipitated into the water. By the time
he recovered himself the delicate prow touched the shore as lightly
as if drawn by a lady's hand.</p>

<p>Ned instantly stepped out, the others doing the same. When everything
was removed, Deerfoot stooped over, and, without any apparent
effort, raised the canoe from the water.</p>

<p>"I s'pose he am gwine to take dat along to hold ober our heads
when it rains."</p>

<p>But Blossom was altogether wide of the mark in his theory. The
Shawanoe carried it only a few paces, when he placed it under
a clump of bushes, pulled some leaves over it, laying the paddle
beneath, and then once more turned to resume their journey.</p>
