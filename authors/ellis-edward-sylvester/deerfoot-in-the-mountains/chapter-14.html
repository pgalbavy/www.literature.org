<p>The words of Taggarak the war chief weighed heavily upon George
and Victor Shelton, for nothing was more certain to them than
that trouble for Deerfoot was near. He could not be frightened
into any attempt to hide his light under a bushel, or to deny
the faith that was woven into the very fibre of his being. The
brothers talked the question over many times. It was never referred
to between them and Mul-tal-la, for the Blackfoot could give them
no help, and the final solution of the problem must be reached
by Deerfoot himself.</p>

<p>Our young friends joined as earnestly in the games, the fishing
and hunting as ever, and no one looking upon them would have dreamed
that they suffered any discomfort of mind. Thus the days passed
until two more weeks had gone by, and they began to wonder at
the long absence of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>There had been a flurry of snow, and the weather was perceptibly
colder. As they sat in their lodge after finishing their late
meal, the sifting of the needle-like points against the bison
hides was soothing to the ear, and the crackling wood fire gave
a cheerful illumination to the interior.</p>

<p>Reclining on the soft warm robes, they recurred to the theme
that was continually in their thoughts.</p>

<p>"I am almost sorry we ever came to this place," said George,
with a sigh. "We have had an interesting experience, have made
a number of friends, such as they are, though there can never
be much in the way of friendship between us and these people."</p>

<p>"How could we have spent the winter, which will be cold and severe?"
asked his brother.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot would have had no trouble in finding some cave in the
rocks which we could have fitted up into as good a house as this.
There are places, too, where the horses would have been sheltered
from the storms, and we could gather plenty of cottonwood bark
when grass was beyond reach, and thus kept the animals alive."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that might have been done, but I don't believe it is
as easy as you think. It seems to me our hope is in Deerfoot's
tact. He will not listen in silence to any attack upon his faith,
and when the heathen inquire of him he will answer them truly,
but he has enough respect for the rank of Taggarak not to offend
him when there is no need of doing so."</p>

<p>"You see he has already sown seed, and there will be inquiries
by others from him. Spink and Jiggers have been thoughtful a long
time. They have spoken to others. Mul-tal-la must have done the
same, though he is cautious and fears to offend the chief. All
these and many others will question Deerfoot, who will answer
them without thought or care, even though a hundred Taggaraks
stood in his way."</p>

<p>"Tact is a good thing, but all that I can see it is likely to
do in this case is to postpone the trouble."</p>

<p>In the midst of their gloomy talk, and with the snow still rattling
against the dry bison robes of their tepee, the flap was suddenly
lifted and Deerfoot the Shawanoe entered and caught the hand of
each delighted boy. His face was aglow with health and pleasure,
for they were no happier than he over the reunion.</p>

<p>They slapped him on the shoulder, shook his hand again and again,
and plied him with so many questions that minutes passed before
there was anything like coherence in their boisterous chatter.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave Whirlwind?" asked George, thereby implying
that he had not a shadow of doubt of the success of the venture
of the young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, when coming from the east to this settlement,"
replied their friend, "Deerfoot came in sight of Mul-tal-la, who
was hunting alone. He had just shot an antelope, and we sat down
and ate it together. Then we came to the village as it was growing
dark. Mul-tal-la showed Deerfoot where the horses are free. There
is snow on the ground, but not enough to hide all the grass, and
Deerfoot was told of a place to the west, where Mul-tal-la says
the shelter sometimes permits the grass to keep green all winter.
There the horses will soon be taken, and shelter has been made
for them. Whirlwind, after Deerfoot had talked with him, consented
to go among the horses, as Zigzag, Prince and the others have
done. He does not like to mingle with common animals, and is as
proud as ever."</p>

<p>"We have enough left of our buffalo meat to furnish you a meal,
Deerfoot, but you told us you had eaten only a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thanks his brothers, and will not eat until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I suppose Mul-tal-la told you all about us?"</p>

<p>"He has left little for you to tell. Deerfoot is glad to hear
his brothers have been so well, but they have much to say that
he would like to hear."</p>

<p>"O Deerfoot!" exclaimed Victor; "tell us how you got Whirlwind
back. You must have had a pretty hard time, for you were gone
a month."</p>

<p>The three seated themselves on the soft furs, George first throwing
additional wood on the blaze, and the Shawanoe, knowing how interested
his friends were, modestly related the story with which you became
familiar long ago. The boys were so absorbed in the narration
that they did not speak nor move until it was ended. He made light
of the dangers and difficulties which he overcame, and it was
plain to his listeners that he slurred over more than one of his
most remarkable exploits.</p>

<p>The brothers found it almost amusing to hear that the young Shawanoe
had so wrenched one of his ankles that he could not use it for
a time. It was so remarkable to learn that he had suffered from
anything of that nature that they found it hard to associate the
two. The manner in which Deerfoot stepped into the tent proved
that he did not feel the slightest effects of the hurt. The Shawanoe
told his friends that he and Mul-tal-la had purposely tarried
outside the village until dark, because the newcomer did not care
to have his arrival become known until the morrow. He wished to
enjoy the first evening undisturbed with his old friends. Being
on foot, with a blanket about his shoulders like Mul-tal-la and
many other Blackfeet, he looked so much like one of them in the
night that he attracted no notice, and Mul-tal-la promised to
tell no one of the presence of the youth whom all were eager to
see.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the evening that the Shawanoe spoke
of the theme that had troubled the brothers so long. Mul-tal-la
had told him of the conversation with Taggarak, and he asked the
boys to give their recollection, not omitting a word they could
recall. Their friend listened gravely, and was silent when they
had finished, his dark eyes fixed upon the fire in the middle
of the lodge, as if his meditations had drifted beyond the time
and place. After waiting for several minutes, Victor said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, you can't know how much we are worried. We understand
how you feel and that no danger can scare you into denying the
true religion, any more than it can scare George and me, but you
may as well be careful and avoid rousing the anger of Taggarak,
so long as there is no need of provoking him."</p>

<p>"What would my brothers have Deerfoot do?" gently asked, the
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"We don't know," replied George. "Vic and I have talked about
this a hundred times since our call on the chief, and we are puzzled
as well as worried."</p>

<p>"Are my brothers ready to die for the religion?"</p>

<p>"We are, and will prove it if it ever becomes necessary; but,"
added Victor, "we don't see the need of dying when there isn't
any need of it."</p>

<p>This original bit of philosophy caused Deerfoot to turn and look
with a half-serious expression into the face of Victor.</p>

<p>"How great is the wisdom of my brother! Who taught him such things?"</p>

<p>Then assuming a graver countenance, but gazing steadily at his
friend, he added:</p>

<p>"There was One who died on the cross for you and Deerfoot."</p>

<p>There was a world of meaning in these words, and they fitly closed
the conversation for the night. All lay down soon after and slept
until morning.</p>

<p>The snow ceased falling, and only a thin coating lay on the ground
at daylight. An unusual moderation in the temperature carried
this away before nightfall, and the weather became almost spring-like,
or rather resembled the lingering days of Indian summer, which
are the expiring gasp of the mild season, soon to be followed
by the biting rigors of winter.</p>

<p>Before noon it was known throughout the Blackfoot village that
the remarkable young Shawanoe had arrived. The excitement was
greater than that caused by the coming of Victor and George Shelton,
and for a time Deerfoot was seriously annoyed, but he strove to
bear it with the sensible philosophy of his nature. Those who
saw him as he moved here and there with the boys, or Mul-tal-la,
or Spink and Jiggers, had to admit the truth of the assertion
heard many times; he was the most prepossessing young warrior
upon whom any of them had ever looked. Neither among the Blackfeet
nor any of their neighboring tribes had so comely a youth been
seen. And this being the fact, many were more unwilling than before
to believe he was so powerful, so active, so fleet of foot and
so athletic as had been claimed. This doubt was not lessened by
the conduct of Deerfoot himself. He soon became acquainted with
nearly everyone in the village, and went upon hunting expeditions
with them, but displayed no more skill than most of his companions.
He avoided all trials of speed, though often invited to take part
by the doubters. In crossing the river in a canoe with two of
his new acquaintances, he swung a paddle, while each of them did
the same. The Blackfeet saw no evidence of skill superior to theirs,
because in truth none was displayed. He was urged to take part
in their games, but made excuse to act only as spectator. He did
not wish to become a competitor and deceive the others by not
doing his best. His modesty led him to shrink from exhibiting
his abilities. Moreover, he had a feeling that it savored of ingratitude
or lack of appreciation of the hospitality he was receiving to
place himself at the fore, as he knew he could readily do.</p>

<p>But it had to come. Too many boasts had been made by the friends
of Deerfoot for the envious Blackfeet to allow the Shawanoe to
rest upon such laurels. Neither Mul-tal-la nor the brothers would
abate one bit of their claims. Deerfoot would have stopped them
had not the mischief, as he viewed it, been done before his coming.
He could only remain mute and hope the matter would die out of
itself. But that was impossible.</p>

<p>The most noted test of athletic skill that ever occurred in the
history of the Blackfeet tribe took place one bright, keen, sunshiny
afternoon on the bleak plain at the rear of the village. A week
had been spent in making the preparations as thorough as they
could be made. Runners came from three of the other villages,
and they were the flower of the tribe&mdash;lithe, sinewy, swift and
splendid specimens of manly beauty, symmetry and grace. Each was
worthy of being called a champion, and all were confident of lowering
the colors of the dusky stranger from the land of the rising sun,
who had been presumptuous enough to be persuaded to enter a trial
that must disgrace him. More than one believed that in his chagrin
the Shawanoe would hasten from the village and never more be seen
in that part of the world.</p>

<p>Now, it would be interesting to tell all about this memorable
tournament, but you have no more doubt of the result than did
the victor from the moment he consented to enter into it. Mul-tal-la
and the Shelton brothers, including Spink and Jiggers, impressed
upon the Shawanoe the necessity of his doing his best, no matter
what the nature of the struggle might be. He promised to follow
their counsel, as he did that of Simon Kenton at the foot race
at Woodvale the year before.</p>

<p>Five contestants entered against Deerfoot. The distance was about
two hundred yards. Never before was the Shawanoe pitted against
such fleet runners, but he finished the struggle fifty feet in
front of the foremost. The spectators, as well as the defeated
runners themselves, were dazed, and could hardly credit their
own senses.</p>

<p>Not less crushing were Deerfoot's victories in the running, the
standing and the high jump. Like all great athletes, his triumphs
seemed to be won without calling upon his reserve capacity, and
therefore with much less apparent effort than shown by his rivals.
In firing at a target, he left the few marksmen of the tribe hopelessly
out of sight. Then he borrowed Mul-tal-la's bow, and every arrow
that he launched went farther and truer than any other. Altogether
it was a great day for Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>
