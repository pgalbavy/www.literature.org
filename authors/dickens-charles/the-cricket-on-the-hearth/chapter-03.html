<P>The Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten, when
the Carrier sat down by his fireside. So troubled
and grief-worn, that he seemed to scare the Cuckoo,
who, having cut his ten melodious announcements as
short as possible, plunged back into the Moorish Pal-
ace again, and clapped his little door behind him,
as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his
feelings.
<P>If the little Haymaker had been armed with the
sharpest of scythes, and had cut at every stroke into
the Carrier's heart, he never could have gashed and
wounded it, as Dot had done.
<P>It was a heart so full of love for her; so bound
up and held together by innumerable threads of win-
ning remembrance, spun from the daily working of
her many qualities of endearment; it was a heart in
which she had enshrined herself so gently and so
closely; a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth,
so strong in right, so weak in wrong; that it could
cherish neither passion nor revenge at first, and had
only room to hold the broken image of its Idol.
<P>But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding
on his hearth, now cold and dark, other and fiercer
thoughts began to rise within him, as an angry wind
comes rising in the night. The Stranger was beneath
his outraged roof. Three steps would take him to
his chamber-door. One blow would beat it in. 'You
might do murder before you know it,' Tackleton had
said. How could it be murder, if he gave the villain
time to grapple with him hand to hand! He was the
younger man.
<P>It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood
of his mind. It was an angry thought, goading him
to some avenging act, that should change the cheerful
house into a haunted place which lonely travellers
would dread to pass by night; and where the timid
would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows
when the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the
stormy weather.
<P>He was the younger man! Yes, yes; some lover
who had won the heart that he had never touched.
Some lover of her early choice, of whom she had
thought and dreamed, for whom she had pined and
pined, when he had fancied her so happy by his side.
O agony to think of it!
<P>She had been above-stairs with the Baby, getting it
to bed. As he sat brooding on the hearth, she came
close beside him, without his knowledge -- in the turn-
ing of the rack of his great misery, he lost all other
sounds -- and put her little stool at his feet. He only
knew it, when he felt her hand upon his own, and
saw her looking up into his face.
<P>With wonder? No. It was his first impression,
and he was fain to look at her again, to set it right.
No, not with wonder. With an eager and inquiring
look; but not with wonder. At first it was alarmed
and serious; then, it changed into a strange, wild,
dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts; then,
there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow,
and her bent head, and falling hair.
<P>Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to
wield at that moment, he had too much of its diviner
property of Mercy in his breast, to have turned one
feather's weight of it against her. But he could
not bear to see her crouching down upon the little
seat where he had often looked on her, with love
and pride, so innocent and gay; and, when she rose
and left him, sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief
to have the vacant place beside him rather than her
so long cherished presence. This in itself was an-
guish keener than all, reminding him how desolate
he was become, and how the great bond of his life
was rent asunder.
<P>The more he felt this, and the more he knew he
could have better borne to see her lying prematurely
dead before him with their little child upon her breast,
the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against
his enemy. He looked about him for a weapon.
<P>There was a gun, hanging on the wall. He took
it down, and moved a pace or two towards the door
of the perfidious Stranger's room. He knew the gun
was loaded. Some shadowy idea that it was just to
shoot this man like a wild beast, seized him, and
dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous
demon in complete possession of him, casting out all
milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire.
<P>That phrase is wrong. Not casting out his milder
thoughts, but artfully transforming them. Chang-
ing them into scourges to drive him on. Turning
water into blood, love into hate, gentleness into blind
ferocity. Her image, sorrowing, humbled, but still
pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless
power, never left his mind; but, staying there, it
urged him to the door; raised the weapon to his
shoulder; fitted and nerved his finger to the trigger;
and cried 'Kill him! In his bed!'
<P>He reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the
door; he already held it lifted in the air; some in-
distinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to
him to fly, for God's sake, by the window --
<P>When, suddenly, the struggling fire illumined the
whole chimney with a glow of light; and the Cricket
on the Hearth began to Chirp!
<P>No sound he could have heard, no human voice,
not even hers, could so have moved and softened
him. The artless words in which she had told him
of her love for this same Cricket, were once more
freshly spoken; her trembling, earnest manner at the
moment, was again before him; her pleasant voice --
O what a voice it was, for making household music
at the fireside of an honest man! -- thrilled through
and through his better nature, and awoke it into
life and action.
<P>He recoiled from the door, like a man walking
in his sleep, awakened from a frightful dream; and
put the gun aside. Clasping his hands before his
face, he then sat down again beside the fire, and
found relief in tears.
<P>The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room,
and stood in Fairy shape before him.
<P>' "I love it," ' said the Fairy Voice, repeating what
he well remembered, ' "for the many times I have
heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music
has given me." '
<P>'She said so!' cried the Carrier. 'True!'
<P>' "This has been a happy home, John; and I love
the Cricket for its sake!" '
<P>'It has been, Heaven knows,' returned the Carrier.
She made it happy, always, -- until now.'
<P>'So gracefully sweet-tempered; so domestic, joy-
ful, busy, and light-hearted!' said the Voice.
<P>'Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,'
returned the Carrier.
<P>The Voice, correcting him, said 'do.'
<P>The Carrier repeated 'as I did.' But not firmly.
His faltering tongue resisted his control, and would
speak in its own way, for itself and him.
<P>The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised
its hand and said:
<P>'Upon your own hearth --'
<P>'The hearth she has blighted,' interposed the
Carrier.
<P>'The hearth she has -- how often! -- blessed and
brightened,' said the Cricket; 'the hearth which, but
for her, were only a few stones and bricks and rusty
bars, but which has been through her, the Altar of
your Home; on which you have nightly sacrificed
some petty passion, selfishness, or care, and offered
up the homage of a tranquil mind, a trusting nature,
and an overflowing heart; so that the smoke from
this poor chimney has gone upward with a better
fragrance than the richest incense that is burnt before
the richest shrines in all the gaudy temples of this
world! -- Upon your own hearth; in its quiet sanc-
tuary; surrounded by its gentle influences and asso-
ciations; hear her! Hear me! Hear everything that
speaks the language of your hearth and home!'
<P>'And pleads for her?' inquired the Carrier.
<P>'All things that speak the language of your hearth
and home, must plead for her!' returned the Cricket.
'For they speak the truth.'
<P>And while the Carrier, with his head upon his
hands, continued to sit meditating in his chair, the
Presence stood beside him, suggesting his reflections
by its power, and presenting them before him, as
in a glass or picture. It was not a solitary Presence.
From the hearthstone, from the chimney, from the
clock, the pipe, the kettle, and the cradle; from the
floor, the walls, the ceiling, and the stairs; from the
cart without, and the cupboard within, and the house-
hold implements; from every thing and every place
with which she had ever been familiar, and with
which she had ever entwined one recollection of her
self in her unhappy husband's mind; Fairies came
trooping forth. Not to stand beside him as the
Cricket did, but to busy and bestir themselves. To
do all honour to her image. To pull him by the
skirts, and point to it when it appeared. To cluster
round it, and embrace it, and strew flowers for it to
tread on. To try to crown its fair head with their
tiny hands. To show that they were fond of it and
loved it; and that there was not one ugly, wicked,
or accusatory creature to claim knowledge of it --
none but their playful and approving selves.
<P>His thoughts were constant to her image. It was
always there.
<P>She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and sing-
ing to herself. Such a blithe, thriving, steady little
Dot! The fairy figures turned upon him all at once,
by one consent, with one prodigious concentrated
stare, and seemed to say 'Is this the light wife you
are mourning for!'
<P>There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical in-
struments, and noisy tongues, and laughter. A crowd
of young merrymakers came pouring in; among whom
were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls. Dot
was the fairest of them all; as young as any of them
too. They came to summon her to join their party
It was a dance. If ever little foot were made for
dancing, hers was, surely. But she laughed, and
shook her head, and pointed to her cookery on the
fire, and her table ready spread: with an exulting
defiance that rendered her more charming than she
was before. And so she merrily dismissed them, nod-
ding to her would-be partners, one by one, as they
passed; but with a comical indifference, enough to
make them go and drown themselves immediately
if they were her admirers -- and they must have been
so, more or less; they couldn't help it. And yet
indifference was not her character. O no! For pres-
ently, there came a certain Carrier to the door; and
bless her what a welcome she bestowed upon him!
<P>Again the staring figures turned upon him all at
once, and seemed to say 'Is this the wife who has
forsaken you!'
<P>A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture: call
it what you will. A great shadow of the Stranger,
as he first stood underneath their roof; covering its
surface, and blotting out all other objects. But the
nimble Fairies worked like bees to clear it off again.
And Dot again was there. Still bright and beautiful.
<P>Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it
softly, and resting her head upon a shoulder which
had its counterpart in the musing figure by which the
Fairy Cricket stood.
<P>The night --  mean the real night: not going by
Fairy clocks -- was wearing now; and in this stage of
the Carrier's thoughts, the moon burst out, and shone
brightly in the sky. Perhaps some calm and quiet
light had risen also, in his mind; and he could think
more soberly of what had happened.
<P>Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at in-
tervals upon the glass -- always distinct, and big, and
thoroughly defined -- it never fell so darkly as at first.
Whenever it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general
cry of consternation, and plied their little arms and
legs, with inconceivable activity, to rub it out. And
whenever they got at Dot again, and showed her to
him once more, bright and beautiful, they cheered in
the most inspiring manner.
<P>They never showed her, otherwise than beautiful
and bright, for they were Household Spirits to whom
falsehood is annihilation; and being so, what Dot
was there for them, but the one active, beaming,
pleasant little creature who had been the light and
sun of the Carrier's Home!
<P>The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they
showed her, with the Baby, gossiping among a knot
of sage old matrons, and affecting to be wondrous
old and matronly herself, and leaning in a staid, de-
mure old way upon her husband's arm, attempting --
she! such a bud of a little woman -- to convey the
idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in
general, and of being the sort of person to whom it
was no novelty at all to be a mother; yet in the
same breath, they showed her, laughing at the Car-
rier for being awkward, and pulling up his shirt-
collar to make him smart, and mincing merrily about
that very room to teach him how to dance!
<P>They turned, and stared immensely at him when
they showed her with the Blind Girl; for, though
she carried cheerfulness and animation with her
wheresoever she went, she bore those influences into
Caleb Plummer's home, heaped up and running over
The Blind Glrl's love for her, and trust in her, and
gratitude to her; her own good busy way of setting
Bertha's thanks aside; her dexterous little arts for
filling up each moment of the visit in doing some-
thing useful to the house, and really working hard
while feigning to make holiday; her bountiful pro-
vision of those standing delicacies, the Veal and Ham-
Pie and the bottles of Beer; her radiant little face
arriving at the door, and taking leave; the wonderful
expression in her whole self, from her neat foot to the
crown of her head, of being a part of the establish-
ment -- a something necessary to it, which it couldn't
be without; all this the Fairies revelled in, and loved
her for. And once again they looked upon him all
at once, appealingly, and seemed to say, while some
among them nestled in her dress and fondled her, 'Is
this the wife who has betrayed your confidence!'
<P>More than once, or twice, or thrice, in the long
thoughtful night, they showed her to him sitting on
her favourite seat, with her bent head, her hands
clasped on her brow, her falling hair. As he had
seen her last. And when they found her thus, they
neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered
close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and
pressed on one another to show sympathy and kind-
ness to her, and forgot him altogether.
<P>Thus the night passed. The moon went down; the
stars grew pale; the cold day broke; the sun rose.
The Carrier still sat, musing in the chimney corner.
He had sat there, with his head upon his hands, all
night. All night the faithful Cricket had been Chirp,
Chirp, Chirping on the Hearth All night he had
listened to its voice. All night the household Fairies
had been busy with him. All night she had been
amiable and blameless in the glass, except when that
one shadow fell upon it.
<P>He rose up when it was broad day, and washed
and dressed himself. He couldn't go about his cus-
tomary cheerful avocations -- he wanted spirit for
them -- but it mattered the less, that it was Tackle-
ton's wedding-day, and he had arranged to make his
rounds by proxy. He thought to have gone merrily
to church with Dot. But such plans were at an end.
It was their own wedding-day too. Ah! how little
he had looked for such a close to such a year!
<P>The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would
pay him an early visit; and he was right. He had
not walked to and fro before his own door, many
minutes, when he saw the Toy-merchant coming in
his chaise along the road. As the chaise drew nearer,
he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely
for his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse's
head with flowers and favours.
<P>The horse looked much more like a bridegroom
than Tackleton, whose half-closed eye was more dis-
agreebly expressive than ever. But the Carrier
took little heed of this. His thoughts had other
occupation.
<P>'John Peerybingle!' said Tackleton, with an air
of condolence. 'My good fellow, how do you find
yourself this morning?'
<P>'I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton,'
returned the Carrier shaking his head: 'for I have
been a good deal disturbed in my mind. But it's
over now! Can you spare me half an hour or so,
for some private talk?'
<P>'I came on purpose,' returned Tackleton, alight-
ing. 'Never mind the horse. He'll stand quiet
enough, with the reins over this post, if you'll give
him a mouthful of hay.'
<P>The Carrier having brought it from his stable, and
set it before him, they turned into the house.
<P>'You are not married before noon ?' he said, 'I
think?'
<P>'No,' answered Tackleton. 'Plenty of time. Plenty
of time.'
<P> When they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was
rapping at the Stranger's door; which was only re-
moved from it by a few steps. One of her very red
eyes (for Tilly had been crying all night long, be-
cause her mistress cried) was at the keyhole; and she
was knocking very loud; and seemed frightened.
<P>'If you please I can't make nobody hear,' said
Tilly, looking round. 'I hope nobody an't gone and
been and died if you please!'
<P>This philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised
with various new raps and kicks at the door; which
led to no result whatever.
<P>'Shall I go?' said Tackieton. 'It's curious.'
<P>The Carrier, who had turned his face from the
door, signed to him to go if he would.
<P>So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy's relief; and
he too kicked and knocked; and he too failed to
get the least reply. But he thought of trying the
handle of the door; and as it opened easily, he peeped
in, looked in, went in, and soon came running out
again.
<P>'John Peerybingle,' said Tackleton, in his ear. 'I
hope there has been nothing -- nothing rash in the
night?'
<P>The Carrier turned upon him quickly.
<P>'Because he's gone!' said Tackleton; 'and the win-
dows open. I don't see any marks -- to be sure it's
almost on a level with the garden: but I was afraid
there might have been some -- some scuffle. Eh?'
<P>He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether;
he looked at him so hard. And he gave his eye, and
bis face, and his whole person, a sharp twist. As
if he would have screwed the truth out of him.
<P>'Make yourself easy,' said the Carrier. 'He went
into that room last night, without harm in word or
deed from me, and no one has entered it since. He
is away of his own free will. I'd go out gladly at
that door, and beg my bread from house to house,
for life, if I could so change the past, that he had
never come. But he has come and gone. And I
have done with him!'
<P>'Oh! -- Well, I think he has got off pretty easy,'
said Tackleton, taking a chair.
<P>The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down
too, and shaded his face with his hand, for some little
time, before proceeding.
<P>'You showed me last night,' he said at length, 'my
wife; my wife that I love; secretly --'
<P>'And tenderly,' insinuated Tackleton.
<P>'Conniving at that man's disguise, and giving him
opportunities of meeting her alone. I think there's
no sight I wouldn't have rather seen than that. I
think there's no man in the world I wouldn't have
rather had to show it to me.'
<P>'I confess to having had my suspicions always,'
said Tackleton. 'And that has made me objection-
able here, I know.'
<P>'But as you did show it me,' pursued the Carrier,
not minding him; 'and as you saw her, my wife, my
wife that I love'-- his voice, and eye, and hand, grew
steadier and firmer as he repeated these words; evi-
dently in pursuance of a steadfast purpose -- 'as you
saw her at this disadvantage, it is right and just
that you should also see with my eyes, and look into
my breast, and know what my mind is, upon the sub-
ject. For it's settled,' said the Carrier, regarding
him attentively. 'And nothing can shake it now.'
<P>Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent,
about its being necessary to vindicate something or
other; but he was overawed by the manner of his
companion. Plain and unpolished as it was, it had
a something dignified and noble in it, which nothing
but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man
could have imported.
<P>'I am a plain, rough man,' pursued the Carrier.
'with very little to recommend me. I am not a clever
man, as you very well know. I am not a young man.
I loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow
up, from a child, in her father's house; because I
knew how precious she was; because she had been
my life, for years and years. There's many men I
can't compare with, who never could have loved my
little Dot like me, I think!'
<P>He paused, and softly beat the ground a short time
with his foot, before resuming.
<P>'I often thought that though I wasn't good enough
for her, I should make her a kind husband, and per-
haps know her value better than another; and in this
way I reconciled it to myself, and came to think it
might be possible that we should be married. And
in the end it came, and we were married.'
<P>'Hah!' said Tackleton, with a significant shake of
the head.
<P>'I had studied myself; I had had experience of my-
self; I knew how much I loved her, and how happy
I should be, pursued the Carrier. 'But I had not --
I feel it now -- sufficiently considered her.'
<P>'To be sure,' said Tackleton. 'Giddiness, frivolity,
fickleness, love of admiration! Not considered! All
left out of sight! Hah!'
<P>'You had best not interrupt me,' said the Carrier
wlth some sternness, 'till you understand me, and
you're wide of doing so. If, yesterday, I'd have
struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe
a word against her, to-day I'd set my foot upon his
face, if he was my brother!'
 The Toy-merchant gazed at him in astonishment.
He went on in a softer tone:
<P>'Did I consider,' said the Carrier, 'that I took her
-- at her age, and with her beauty -- from her young
companion, and the many scenes of which she was
the ornament; in which she was the brightest little
star that ever shone, to shut her up from day to day
in my dull house, and keep my tedious company?
Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly
humour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me
must be, to one of her quick spirit? Did I consider
that it was no merit in me, or claim in me, that I
loved her, when everybody must, who knew her?
Never. I took advantage of her hopeful nature and
her cheerful disposition; and I married her. I wish
I never had! For her sake; not for mine!'
<P>The Toy-merchant gazed at him, without winking.
Even the half-shut eye was open now.
<P>'Heaven bless her!' said the Carrier, 'for the cheer-
ful constancy with which she tried to keep the knowl-
edge of this from me! And Heaven help me, that,
in my slow mind, I have not found it out before!
Poor child! Poor Dot! I not to find it out, who
have seen her eyes fill with tears, when such a mar-
riage as our own was spoken of! I, who have seen
the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times, and
never suspected it till last night! Poor girl! That
I could ever hope she would be fond of me! That
I could ever believe she was!'
<P>'She made a show of it,' said Tackleton. 'She
made such a show of it, that to tell you the truth
it was the origin of my misgivings.'
<P>And here he asserted the superiority of May Field-
ing, who certainly made no sort of show of being
fond of him.
<P>'She has tried,' said the poor Carrier, with greater
emotion than he had exhibited yet; 'I only now begin
to know how hard she has tried, to be my dutiful
and zealous wife. How good she has been; how much
she has done; how brave and strong a heart she has;
let the happiness I have known under this roof bear
witness! It will be some help and comfort to me,
when I am here alone.'
<P>'Here alone?' said Tackleton. 'Oh! Then you do
mean to take some notice of this?'
<P>'I mean,' returned the Carrier, 'to do her the great-
est kindness, and make her the best reparation, in
my power. I can release her from the daily pain of
an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it.
She shall be as free as I can render her.'
<P>'Make her reparation!' exclaimed Tackleton, twist-
ing and turning his great ears with his hands. 'There
must be something wrong here. You didn't say that,
of course.'
<P> The Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the Toy-
merchant, and shook him like a reed.
<P>'Listen to me!' he said. 'And take care that you
hear me right. Listen to me. Do I speak plainly?'
<P>'Very plainly indeed,' answered Tackleton.
<P>'As if I meant it?'
<P>'Very much as if you meant it.'
<P>'I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,' ex-
claimed the Carrier. 'On the spot where she has
often sat beside me, with her sweet face looking into
mine. I called up her whole life, day by day. I had
her dear self, in its every passage, in review before
me. And upon my soul she is innocent, if there is
One to judge the innocent and guilty!'
<P>Staunch Cricket on the Hearth! Loyal household
Fairies!
<P>'Passion and distrust have left me!' said the Car-
rier; 'and nothing but my grief remains. In an un-
appy moment some old lover, better suited to her
tastes and years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me,
against her will; returned. In an unhappy moment,
taken by surprise, and wanting time to think of what
she did, she made herself a party to his treachery,
by concealing it. Last night she saw him, in the
interview we witnessed. It was wrong. But other-
wise than this she is innocent if there is truth on
earth!'
<P>'If that is your opinion ' Tackleton began.
<P>'So let her go!' pursued the Carrier. 'Go, with
my blessing for the many happy hours she has given
me, and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused
me. Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish
her. She'll never hate me. She'll learn to like me
better, when I'm not a drag upon her, and she wears
the chain I have riveted, more lightly. This is the
day on which I took her, with so little thought for
her enjoyment, from her home. To-day she shall
return to it, and I will trouble her no more. Her
father and mother will be here to-day -- we had made
a little plan for keeping it together -- and they shall
take her home. I can trust her, there, or anywhere.
She leaves me without blame, and she will live so I
am sure. If I should die -- I may perhaps while she
is still young; I have lost some courage in a few hours
-- she'll find that I remembered her, and loved her
to the last! This is the end of what you showed me.
Now, it's over!'
<P>'O no, John, not over. Do not say it's over yet!
Not quite yet. I have heard your noble words. I
could not steal away, pretending to be ignorant of
what has affected me with such deep gratitude. Do
not say it's over, till the clock has struck again!'
<P>She had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had
remained there. She never looked at Tackleton, but
fixed her eyes upon her husband. But she kept away
from him, setting as wide a space as possible between
them; and though she spoke with most impassioned
earnestness, she went no nearer to him even then.
How different in this from her old self!
<P>'No hand can make the clock which will strike
again for me the hours that are gone,' replied the
Carrier, with a faint smile. 'But let it be so, if you
will, my dear. It will strike soon. It's of little
matter what we say. I'd try to please you in a harder
case than that.'
<P>'Well!' muttered Tackleton. 'I must be off, for
when the clock strikes again, it'll be necessary for
me to be upon my way to church. Good-morning,
John Peerybingle. I'm sorry to be deprived of the
pleasure of your company. Sorry for the loss, and
the occasion of it too!'
<P> 'I have spoken plainly?' said the Carrier, accom-
panying him to the door.
<P>'Oh quite!'
<P>'And you'll remember what I have said?'
<P>'Why, if you compel me to make the observation,'
said Tackleton, previously taking the precaution of
getting into his chaise; 'I must say that it was so
very unexpected, that I'm far from being likely to
forget it.'
<P>'The better for us both,' returned the Carrier.
Good-bye. I give you joy!'
<P>'I wish I could give it to you,' said Tackleton.
'As I can't; thank'ee. Between ourselves, (as I told
you before, eh?) I don't much think I shall have the
less joy in my married life, because May hasn't been
too officious about me, and too demonstrative. Good-
bye! Take care of yourself.'
<P>The Carrier stood looking after him until he was
smaller in the distance than his horse's flowers and
favours near at hand; and then, with a deep sigh,
went strolling like a restless, broken man, among
some neighbouring elms; unwilling to return until
the clock was on the eve of striking.
<P>His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously;
but often dried her eyes and checked herself, to say
how good he was, how excellent he was ! and once
or twice she laughed; so heartlly, triumphantly, and
incoherently (still crying all the time), that Tilly
was quite horrified.
<P>'Ow if you please don't!' said Tilly. 'It's enough
to dead and bury the Baby, so it is if you please.'
<P>'Will you bring him sometimes to see his father,
Tilly,' inquired her mistress, drying her eyes; 'when
I can't live here, and have gone to my old home?'
<P>'Ow if you please don't!' cried Tilly, throwing back
her head, and bursting out into a howl -- she looked
at the moment uncommonly like Boxer; 'Ow if you
please don't! Ow, what has everybody gone and
been and done with everybody, making everybody
else so wretched! Ow-w-w-w!'
<P>The soft-hearted Slowboy trailed off at this junc-
ture, into such a deplorable howl, the more tremen-
dous from its long suppression, that she must infal-
libly have awakened the Baby, and frightened him
into something serious (probably convulsions), if her
eyes had not encountered Caleb Plummer, leading in
his daughter. This spectacle restoring her to a sense
of the proprieties, she stood for some few moments
silent, with her mouth wide open; and then, posting
off to the bed on which the Baby lay asleep, danced
in a weird, Saint Vitus manner on the floor, and at
the same time rummaged with her face and head
among the bedclothes, apparently deriving much re-
lief from those extraordinary operations.
<P>'Mary!' said Bertha. 'Not at the marriage!'
<P>'I told her you would not be there mum,' whispered
Caleb. 'I heard as much last night. Bless you,' said
the little man, taking her tenderly by both hands,
'I don't care for what they say. I don't believe them.
There an't much of me, but that little should be torn
to pieces sooner than I'd trust a word against you!'
<P>He put hls arms about her and hugged her, as a
child might have hugged one of his own dolls.
<P>'Bertha couldn't stay at home this morning,' said
Caleb. She was afraid, I know, to hear the bells
ring, and couldn't trust herself to be so near them
on their wedding-day. So we started in good time,
and came here. I have been thinking of what I
have done,' said Caleb, after a moment's pause, 'I
have been blaming myself till I hardly knew what
to do or where to turn, for the distress of mind I
have caused her; and I've come to the conclusion that
better, if you'll stay with me, mum, the while,
tell her the truth. You'll stay with me the while?'
he inquired, trembling from head to foot. 'I don't
know what effect it may have upon her; I don't know
what she'll think of me; I don't know that she'll
ever care for her poor father afterwards. But it's
best for her that she should be undeceived, and I
must hear the consequences as I deserve!'
<P>'Mary,' said Bertha, 'where is your hand! Ah!
Here it is; here it is!' pressing it to her lips, with
a smile, and drawing it through her arm. 'I heard
them speaking softly among themselves, last night
of some blame against you. They were wrong.'
 The Carrier's Wife was silent. Caleb answered
for her.
<P>'They were wrong,' he said.
<P>'I knew it!' cried Bertha, proudly. 'I told them
so. I scorned to hear a word! Blame her with jus-
ice!' she pressed the hand between her own, and
the soft cheek against her face. 'No! I am not so
blind as that.'
<P>Her father went on one side of her, while Dot
remained upon the other: holding her hand
<P>'I know you all,' said Bertha, 'better than you
think. But none so well as her. Not even you,
father. There is nothing half so real and so true
about me, as she is. If I could be restored to sight
this instant, and not a word were spoken, I could
choose her from a crowd! My sister!'
<P>'Bertha, my dear!' said Caleb, I have something
on my mind I want to tell you, while we three are
alone. Hear me kindly! I have a confession to make
to you, my darling.'
<P>'A confession, father?'
<P>'I have wandered from the truth and lost myself,
my child,' said Caleb, with a pitiable expression in
his bewildered face. 'I have wandered from the truth,
intending to be kind to you; and have been cruel.'
<P>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him,
and repeated 'Cruel!'
<P>'He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha,' said Dot.
'You'll say so, presently. You'll be the first to tell
him so.'
<P>'He cruel to me!' cried Bertha, with a smile of
incredulity.
<P>'Not meaning it, my child,' said Caleb. 'But I
have been; though I never suspected it, till yesterday.
My dear blind daughter, hear me and forgive me!
The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn't exist
as I have represented it. The eyes you have trusted
in, have been false to you.
<P>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him
still; but drew back, and clung closer to her friend.
<P>'Your road in life was rough, my poor one,' said
Caleb, 'and I meant to smooth it for you. I have
altered objects, changed the characters of people, in-
vented many things that never have been to make
you happier. I have had concealments from you,
put deceptions on you, God forgive me! and sur-
rounded you with fancies.'
<P>'But living people are not fancies!' she said hur-
riedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring from
him. 'You can't change them.'
<P>'I have done so, Bertha,' pleaded Caleb. 'There
is one person that you know, my dove --'
<P>'Oh father! why do you say, I know?' she an-
swered, in a term of keen reproach. 'What and whom
do I know! I who have no leader! I so miser-
ably blind!'
<P>In the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her
hands, as if she were groping her way; then spread
them, in a manner most forlorn and sad, upon her
face.
<P>'The marriage that takes place to-day,' said Caleb,
'is with a stern, sordid, grinding man. A hard master
to you and me, my dear, for many years. Ugly in
his looks, and in his nature. Cold and callous always.
Unlike what I have painted him to you in every-
thing, my child. In everything.'
<P>'Oh why,' cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it
seemed, almost beyond endurance, 'why did you ever
do this. Why did you ever fill my heart so full
and then come in like Death, and tear away the
objects of my love! O Heaven, how blind I am!
How elpless and alone!'
<P>Her afflicted father hug his head, and offered no
reply but in his penitence and sorrow.
<P>She had been but a short time in this passion of
regret, when the Cricket on the Hearth, unheard by
all but her, began to chirp. Not merrily, but in a low,
faint, sorrowing way. It was so mournful that her
tears began to flow; and when the Presence which
had been beside the Carrier all night, appeared behind
her, pointing to her father, they fell down like rain.
<P>She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and
was conscious, through her blindness, of the presence
hovering about her father.
<P>'Mary,' said the Blind Girl, 'tell me what my home
is. What it truly is.'
<P>'It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare
indeed. The house will scarcely keep out wind and
rain another winter. It is as roughly shielded from
the weather, Bertha' Dot continued in a low, clear
voice, 'as your poor father in his sack-cloth coat.'
<P>The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the
Carrier's little wife aside.
<P>'Those presents that I took such care of; that came
almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome to
me,' she said, trembling; 'where did they come from?
Did you send them?'
<P>'No.'
<P>'Who then?'
<P>Dot saw she knew, already, and was silent. The
Blind Girl spread her hands before her face again.
But in quite another manner now.
<P>'Dear Mary, a moment. One moment? More this
way. Speak softly to me. You are true, I know.
You'd not deceive me now; would you?'
<P>'No, Bertha, indeed!'
<P>'No, I am sure you would not. You have too much
pity for me. Mary, look across the room to where
we were just now -- to where my father is -- my father,
so compassionate and loving to me -- and tell me
what you see.'
<P>'I see,' said Dot, who understood her well, 'an old
man sitting in a chair, and leaning sorrowfully on
the back, with his face resting on his hand. As if
his child should comfort him, Bertha.'
<P>'Yes, yes. She will. Go on.'
<P>'He is an old man, worn with care and work. He
is a spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man.
I see him now, despondent and bowed down, and
striving against nothing. But, Bertha, I have seen
him many times before, and striving hard in many
ways for one great sacred object. And I honour
his grey head, and bless him!'
<P>The Blind Girl broke away from her; and throw-
ing herself upon her knees before him, took the grey
head to her breast.
<P>'It is my sight restored. It is my sight!' she cried
I have been blind, and now my eyes are open. I
never knew him! To think I might have died, and
never truly seen the father who has been so loving
to me!'
<P>There were no words for Caleb's emotion.
<P>'There is not a gallant figure on this earth,' ex-
claimed the Blind Girl, holding him in her embrace,
'that I would love so dearly, and would cherish so
devotedly, as this! The greyer, and more worn, the
dearer, father! Never let them say I am blind again.
There's not a furrow in his face, there's not a hair
upon his head, that shall be forgotten in my prayers
and thanks to Heaven!'
<P>Caleb managed to articulate 'My Bertha!'
<P>'And in my blindness, I believed him,' said the girl
caressing him with tears of exquisite affection, 'to be
so different! And having him beside me, day by
day, so mindful of me always, never dreamed of this!'
<P>'The fresh smart father in the blue coat, Bertha,'
said poor Caleb. 'He's gone!'
<P>'Nothing is gone,' she answered. 'Dearest father,
no! Everything is here -- in you. The father that
I loved so well: the father that I never loved enough
and never knew; the benefactor whom I first began
to reverence and love, because he had such sympathy
for me; All are here in you. Nothing is dead to me.
The soul of all that was most dear to me is here --
here, with the worn face, and the grey head. And I
am NOT blind, father, any longer!'
<P>Dot's whole attention had been concentrated, dur-
ing this discourse, upon the father and daughter; but
looking, now, towards the little Haymaker in the
Moorish meadow, she saw that the clock was within
a few minutes of striking, and fell, immediately, into
a nervous and excited state.
<P>'Father,' said Bertha, hesitating. 'Mary.'
<P>'Yes my dear,' retumed Caleb. 'Here she is.'
<P>'There is no change in her. You never told me
anything of her that was not true?'
<P>'I should have done it my dear, I am afraid,' re-
turned Caleb, 'if I could have made her better than
she was. But I must have changed her for the worse,
if I had changed her at all. Nothing could improve
her, Bertha.'
<P>Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she
asked the question, her delight and pride in the re-
ply and her renewed embrace of Dot, were charming
to behold.
<P>'More changes than you think for, may happen
though, my dear,' said Dot. 'Changes for the better,
I mean; changes for great joy to some of us. You
mustn't let them startle you too much, if any such
should ever happen, and affect you. Are those wheels
upon the road? You've a quick ear, Bertha. Are
they wheels?'
<P>'Yes. Coming very fast.'
<P>'I-I-I know you have a quick ear,' said Dot,
placing her hand upon her heart, and evidently talk-
ing on, as fast as she could, to hide its palpitating
state, 'because I have noticed it often, and because
you were so quick to find out that strange step last
night. Though why you should have said, as I very
well recollect you did say, Bertha, "Whose step is
that!" and why you should have taken any greater
observation of it than of any other step, I don't know.
Though as I said just now, there are great changes
in the world: great changes: and we can't do better
than prepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly
anything.'
<P>Caleb wondered what this meant; perceiving that
she spoke to him, no less than to his daughter. He
saw her, with astonishment, so fluttered and distressed
that she could scarcely breathe; and holding to a
chair, to save herself from falling.
<P>'They are wheels indeed!' she panted. 'Coming
nearer! Nearer! Very close! And now you hear
them stopping at the garden-gate! And now you
hear a step outside the door -- the same step, Bertha,
is it not! -- and now!' --
<P>She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight;
and running up to Caleb put her hands upon his eyes
as a young man rushed into the room, and flinging
away his hat into the air, came sweeping down upon
them.
<P>'Is it over?' cried Dot.
<P>'Yes!'
<P>'Happily over?'
<P>'Yes!'
<P>'Do you recollect the voice, dear Caleb? Did you
ever hear the like of it before?' cried Dot.
<P>'If my boy in the Golden South Americas was
alive -- said Caleb, trembling.
<P>'He is alive!' shrieked Dot, removing her hand
from his eyes, and clapping them in ecstasy; 'look at
him! See where he stands before you, healthy and
loving brother, Bertha!'        
<P>All honour to the little creature for her transports!
All honour to her tears and laughter, when the three
were locked in one another's arms! All honour to the
heartiness with which she met the sunburnt sailor-
fellow, with his dark streaming hair, half way, and
never turned her rosy little mouth aside, but suffered
him to kiss it, freely, and to press her to his bound-
ing heart!
<P>And honour to the Cuckoo too -- why not! -- for
bursting out of the trap-door in the Moorish Palace
like a housebreaker, and hiccoughing twelve times on
the assembled company, as if he had got drunk
for joy!
<P>The Carrier, entering, started back. And well he
might, to find himself in such good company.
<P>'Look, John!' said Caleb, exultingly, 'look here!
My own boy from the Golden South Americas! My
own son! Him that you fitted out, and sent away
yourself! Him that you were always such a friend to!'
<P>The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand;
but, recoiling, as some feature in his face awakened
a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart, said:
<P>'Edward! Was it you?'
<P>'Now tell him all!' cried Dot. 'Tell him all, Ed-
ward; and don't spare me, for nothing shall make me
spare myself in his eyes, ever again.'
<P>'I was the man,' said Edward.
<P>'And could you steal, disguised, into the house of
your old friend?' rejoined the Carrier. 'There was a
frank boy once -- how many years is it, Caleb, since
we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we
thought? -- who never would have done that.'
<P>'There was a generous friend of mine, once; more
a father to me than a friend'; said Edward, 'who
never would have judged me, or any other man,
unheard. You were he. So I am certain you will
hear me now.'
<P>The Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who
still kept far away from him, replied 'Well! that's
but fair. I will.'
<P>'You must know that when I left here, a boy,' said
Edward, 'I was in love, and my love was returned.
She was a very young girl, who perhaps (you may
tell me) didn't know her own mind. But I knew
mine, and I had a passion for her.'
<P>'You had!' exclaimed the Carrier. 'You!'
<P>'Indeed I had,' returned the other. 'And she re-
turned it. I have ever since believed she did, and
now I am sure she did.'
<P>'Heaven help me!' said the Carrier. 'This is worse
than all.'
<P>'Constant to her,' said Edward, 'and returning, full
of hope, after many hardships and perils, to redeem
my part of our old contract, I heard, twenty miles
away, that she was false to me; that she had forgotten
me; and had bestowed herself upon another and a
richer man. I had no mind to reproach her; but I
wished to see her, and to prove beyond dispute tbat
this was true. I hoped she might have been forced
into it, against her own desire and recollection. It
would be small comfort, but it would be some, I
thought, and on I came. That I might have the
truth, the real truth; observing freely for myself, and
judging for myself, without obstruction on the one
hand, or presenting my own influence (if I had any)
before her, on the other; I dressed myself unlike my-
self -- you know how; and waited on the road -- you
know where. You had no suspicion of me; neither
had -- had she,' pointing to Dot, 'until I whispered in
her ear at that fireside, and she so nearly betrayed
me.'
<P>'But when she knew that Edward was alive, and
had come back,' sobbed Dot, now speaking for her-
self, as she had burned to do, all through this narra-
tive; 'and when she knew his purpose, she advised him
by all means to keep his secret close; for his old friend
John Peerybingle was much too open in his nature,
and too clumsy in all artifice -- being a clumsy man
in general,' said Dot, half laughing and half crying
-- to keep it for him. And when she -- that's me,
John,' sobbed the little woman -- 'told him all, and how
his sweetheart had believed him to be dead; and how
she had at last been over-persuaded by her mother
into a marriage which the silly, dear old thing called
advantageous; and when she -- that's me again, John --
told him they were not yet married (though close
upon it), and that it would be nothing but a sacrifice
if it went on, for there was no love on her side; and
when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it; then
she -- that's me again -- said she would go between
them, as she had often done before in old times, John,
and would sound his sweetheart and be sure that what
she -- me again, John -- said and thought was right.
And it WAS right, John! And they were brought to-
gether, John. And they were married, John, an hour
ago! And here's the Bride! And Gruff and Tackle-
ton may die a bachelor! And I'm a happy little
woman, May, God bless you!'
<P>She was an irresistible little woman, if that be any-
thing to the purpose; and never so completely irre-
sistible as in her present transports. There never
were congratulations so endearing and delicious, as
those she lavished on herself and on the Bride.
<P>Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the
honest Carrier had stood, confounded. Flying, now,
towards her, Dot stretched out her hand to stop him,
and retreated as before.
<P>'No John, no! Hear all! Don't love me any more,
John, till you've heard every word I have to say.
It was wrong to have a secret from you, John. I'm
very sorry. I didn't think it any harm, till I came
and sat down by you on the little stool last night.
But when I knew by what was written in your face,
that you had seen me walking in the gallery with
Edward, and when I knew what you thought, I felt
how giddy and how wrong it was. But oh, dear
John, how could you, could you, think so!'
<P>Little woman, how she sobbed again! John Peery-
bingle would have caught her in his arms. But no;
she wouldn't let him.
<P>'Don't love me yet, please John! Not for a long
time yet! When I was sad about this intended mar-
riage, dear, it was because I remembered May and
Edward such young lovers; and knew that her heart
was far away from Tackleton. You believe that,
now. Don't you John?'
<P>John was going to make another rush at this ap-
peal; but she stopped him again.
<P>'No; keep there, please John! When I laugh at
you, as I sometimes do, John, and call you clumsy
and a dear old goose, and names of that sort, it's be-
cause I love you John, so well, and take such pleasure
in your ways, and wouldn't see you altered in the
least respect to have you made a King to-morrow
<P>'Hooroar!' said Caleb with unusual vigour. 'My
opinion!'
<P>'And when I speak of people being middle-aged
and steady, John, and pretend that we are a humdrum
couple, going on in a jog-trot sort of way, it's only
because I'm such a silly little thing, John, that I like
sometimes, to act a kind of Play with Baby, and all
that: and make believe.'
<P>She saw that he was coming; and stopped him
again. But she was very nearly too late.
<P>'No, don't love me for another minute or two, if
you please John! What I want most to tell you, I
have kept to the last. My dear, good, generous, John
when we were talking the other night about the
Cricket, I had it on my lips to say, that at first I did
not love you quite so dearly as I do now; that when I
first came home here, I was half afraid I mightn't
learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and
prayed I might -- being so very young, John! But,
dear John, every day and hour I loved you more and
more. And if I could have loved you better than I
do, the noble words I heard you say this morning,
would have made me. But I can't. All the affec-
tion that I had (it was a great deal John) I gave you,
as you well deserve, long, long ago, and I have no
more left to give. Now, my dear husband, take me
to your heart again! That's my home, John; and
never, never think of sending me to any other!'
<P>You never will derive so much delight from seeing
a glorious little woman in the arms of a third party
as you would have felt if you had seen Dot run into
the Carrier's embrace. It was the most complete, un-
mitigated, soul-fraught little piece of earnestness that
ever you beheld in all your days.
<P>You may be sure the Carrier was in a state of per-
fect rapture; and you may be sure Dot was likewise;
and you may be sure they all were, incluslve of Miss
Slowboy, who wept copiously for joy, and wishing
to include her younger charge in the general inter-
change of congratulations, handed round the Baby
to everybody in succession, as if it were something to
drink.
<P>But, now, the sound of wheels was heard again out-
aide the door; and somebody exclaimed that Gruff and
Tackleton was coming back. Speedily that worthy
gentleman appeared, looking warm and flustered.
<P>'Why, what the Devil's this, John Peerybingle.'
said Tackleton. 'There's some mistake. I appointed
Mrs. Tackleton to meet me at the church, and I'll
swear I passed her on the road, on her way here.
Oh! here she is! I beg your pardon, sir; I haven't
the pleasure of knowing you; but if you can do me
the favour to spare this young lady, she has rather a
particular engagement this morning.'
<P>'But I can't spare her,' returned Edward. 'I
couldn't think of it.'
<P>'What do you mean, you vagabond? said
Tackleton.
<P>'I mean, that as I can make allowance for your
being vexed,' returned the other, with a smile, 'I am
as deaf to harsh discourse this morning, as I was to
all discourse last night.'
<P>The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and
the start he gave!
<P>'I am sorry, sir,' said Edward, holding out May's
left hand, and especially the third finger; 'that the
young lady can't accompany you to church; but as
she has been there once, this morning, perhaps you'll
excuse her.'
<P>Tackleton looked hard at the third finger, and took
a little piece of silver paper, apparently containing a
ring, from his waistcoat-pocket.
<P> 'Miss Slowboy,' said Tackleton. 'Will you have
the kindness to throw that in the fire? Thank'ee.'
<P>'It was a previous engagement, quite an old engage-
ment, that prevented my wife from keeping her ap-
pointment with you, I assure you,' said Edward
<P>'Mr. Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowl-
edge that I revealed it to him faithfully; and that I
told him, many times, I never could forget it,' said
May, blushing.
<P>'Oh certainly!' said Tackleton. 'Oh to be sure.
Oh it's all right. It's quite correct. Mrs. Edward
Plummer, I infer?'
<P>'That's the name,' returned the bridegroom
<P>'Ah, I shouldn't have known you, sir,' said Tackle-
ton, scrutinising his face narrowly, and making a low
bow. I give you joy, sir!'
<P>'Thank ee.'
<P>'Mrs. Peerybingle,' said Tackleton, turning sud-
denly to where she stood with her husband; 'I am
sorry. You haven't done me a very great kindness
but, upon my life, I am sorry. You are better than
I thought you. John Peerybingle, I am sorry. You
understand me; that's enough. It's quite correct
ladies and gentlemen all, and perfectly satisfactory.
Good-morning!'
<P>With these words he carried it off, and carried him-
self off too: merely stopping at the door, to take the
flowers and favours from his horse's head, and to kick
that animal once, in the ribs, as a means of informing
him that there was a screw loose in his arrangements.
<P>Of course it became a serious duty now, to make
such a day of it, as should mark these events for a
high Feast and Festival in the Peerybingle Calendar
for evermore. Accordingly, Dot went to work to
produce such an entertainment, as should reflect un-
dying honour on the house and on every one con-
cerned; and in a very short space of time, she was up
to her dimpled elbows in flour, and whitening the
Carrier's coat, every time he came near her, by stop-
ping him to give him a kiss. That good fellow washed
the greens, and peeled the turnips, and broke the
plates, and upset iron pots full of cold water on the
fire, and made himself useful in all sorts of ways:
while a couple of professional assistants, hastily
called in from somewhere in the neighbourhood, as on
a point of life or death, ran against each other in all
the doorways and round all the corners, and every-
body tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby,
everywhere. Tilly never came out in such force be-
fore. Her ubiquity was the theme of general admir-
ation. She was a stumbling-block in the passage at
five-and-twenty minutes past two; a man-trap in the
kitchen at half-past two precisely; and a pitfall in
the garret at five-and-twenty minutes to three. The
Baby's head was, is it were, a test and touchstone for
every description of matter, -- animal, vegetable, and
mineral. Nothing was in use that day that didn't
come, at some time or other, into close acquaintaince
with it.
<P>Then, there was a great Expedition set on foot to
go and find out Mrs. Fielding; and to be dismally
penitent to that excellent gentlewoman; and to bring
her back, by force, if needful, to be happy and for-
giving. And when the Expedition first discovered her,
she would listen to no terms at all, but said, an un-
speakable number of times, that ever she should have
lived to see the day! and couldn't be got to say any-
thing else, except, 'Now carry me to the grave': which
seemed absurd, on account of her not being dead, or
anything at all like it. After a time, she lapsed into
a state of dreadful calmness, and observed, that when
that unfortunate train of circumstances had occurred
in the Indigo Trade, she had foreseen that she would
be exposed, during her whole life, to every species of
insult and contumely; and that she was glad to find
it was the case; and begged they wouldn't trouble
themselves about her, -- for what was she? oh, dear!
a nobody! -- but would forget that such a being lived
and would take their course in life without her. From
this bitterly sarcastic mood, she passed into an angry
one, in which she gave vent to the remarkable expres-
sion that the worm would turn if trodden on; and
after that, she yielded to a soft regret, and said, if
they had only given her their confidence, what might
she not have had it in her power to suggest! Taking
advantage of this crisis in her feelings, the Expedi-
tion embraced her, and she very soon had her gloves
on, and was on her way to John Peerybingle's in a
state of unimpeachable gentility; with a paper parcel
at her side containing a cap of state, almost as tall,
and quite as stiff, as a mitre.
<P>Then, there were Dot's father and mother to come,
in another little chaise; and they were behind their
time; and fears were entertained; and there was much
looking out for them down the road; and Mrs. Field-
ing always would look in the wrong and morally im-
possible direction; and being apprised thereof, hoped
she might take the liberty of looking where she
pleased. At last they came: a chubby little couple,
jogging along in a snug and comfortable little way
that quite belonged to the Dot family; and Dot and
her mother, side by side, were wonderful to see. They
were so like each other.
<P>Then, Dot's mother had to renew her acquaintance
with May's mother; and May's mother always stood
on her gentility; and Dot's mother never stood on
anything but her active little feet. And old Dot -- so
to call Dot's father, I forgot it wasn't his right name,
but never mind -- took liberties, and shook hands at
first sight, and seemed to think a cap but so much
starch and muslin, and didn't defer himself at all to
the Indigo Trade, but said there was no help for it
now; and in Mrs. Fielding's summing up, was a good-
natured kind of man -- but coarse, my dear.
<P>I woudn't have missed Dot, doing the honours in
her wedding-gown, my benison on her bright face! for
any money. No! nor the good Carrier, so jovial and
so ruddy, at the bottom of the table. Nor the brown,
fresh, sailor-fellow, and his handsome wife. Nor any
one among them. To have missed the dinner would
have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as
man need eat; and to have missed the overflowing
cups in which they drank The Wedding-Day, would
have been the greatest miss of all.
<P>After dinner, Caleb sang the song about the Spark-
ling Bowl. As I'm a living man, hoping to keep so,
for a year or two, he sang it through.
<P>And, by the bye, a most unlooked-for incident oc-
curred, just as he finished the last verse.
<P>There was a tap at the door; and a man came stag-
gering in, without saying with your leave, or by your
leave, with something heavy on his head. Setting
this down in the middle of the table, symmetrically
in the centre of the nuts and apples, he said:
<P>'Mr. Tackleton's compliments, and as he hasn't got.
no use for the cake himself, p'raps you'll eat it.'
<P>And with those words, he walked off.
<P>There was some surprise among the company, as
you may imagine. Mrs. Fielding, being a lady of
infinite discernment, suggested that the cake was
poisoned, and related a narrative of a cake, which,
within her knowledge, had turned a seminary for
young ladies, blue. But she was overruled by ac-
clamation; and the cake was cut by May, with much
ceremony and rejoicing.
<P>I don't think any one had tasted it, when there
came another tap at the door, and the same man ap-
peared again, having under his arm a vast brown-
paper parcel.
<P>'Mr. Tackleton's compliments, and he's sent a few
toys for the Babby. They ain't ugly.'
<P>After the delivery of which expressions, he retired
again.
<P>The whole party would have experienced great
difficulty in finding words for their astonishment, even
if they had had ample time to seek them. But, they
had none at all; for, the messenger had scarcely shut
the door behind him, when there came another tap
and Tackleton himself walked in.
<P>'Mrs. Peerybingle!' said the Toy-merchant, hat in
hand. 'I'm sorry. I'm more sorry than I was this
morning. I have had time to think of it. John Peery-
bingle! I'm sour by disposition; but I can't help
being sweetened, more or less, by coming face to
face with such a man as you. Caleb! This uncon-
scious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night
of which I have found the thread. I blush to think
how easily I might have bound you and your daugh-
ter to me, and what a miserable idiot I was, when I
took her for one! Friends, one and all, my house is
very lonely to-night. I have not so much as a Cricket
on my Hearth. I have scared them all away. Be
gracious to me; let me join this happy party!'
<P>He was at home in five minutes. You never saw
such a fellow. What had he been doing with himself
all his life, never to have known, before, his great ca-
pacity of being jovial! Or what had the fairies been
doing with him, to have effected such a change!
<P>'John! you won't send me home this evening; will
you?' whispered Dot.
<P>He had been very near it though!
<P>There wanted but one living creature to make the
party complete; and, in the twinkling of an eye, there
he was, very thirsty with hard running, and engaged
in hopeless endeavours to squeeze his head into a nar-
row pitcher. He had gone with the cart to its jour-
ney's end, very much disgusted with the absence of his
master, and stupendously rebellious to the Deputy.
After lingering about the stable for some little time,
vainly attempting to incite the old horse to the muti-
nous act of returning on his own account, he had
walked into the tap-room and laid himself down be-
fore the fire. But suddenly yielding to the convic-
tion that the Deputy was a humbug, and must be
abandoned, he had got up again, turned tail, and
come home.
<P>There was a dance in the evening. With which
general mention of that recreation, I should have left
it alone, if I had not some reason to suppose that it
was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncom-
mon figure. It was formed in an odd way; in this
way.
<P>Edward, that sailor-fellow -- a good free dashing
sort of a fellow he was -- had been telling them various
marvels concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans,
and gold dust, when all at once he took it in his head
to jump up from his seat and propose a dance; for
Bertha's harp was there, and she had such a hand
upon it as you seldom hear. Dot (sly little piece of
affectation when she chose) said her dancing days
were over; I think because the Carrier was smoking
his pipe, and she liked sitting by him, best. Mrs.
Fielding had no choice, of course, but to say her danc-
ing days were over, after that; and everybody said
the same, except May; May was ready.
<P>So, May and Edward get up, amid great applause,
to dance alone; and Bertha plays her liveliest tune.
<P>Well! if you'll believe me, they have not been danc-
ing five minutes, when suddenly the Carrier flings his
pipe away, takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into
the room, and starts off with her, toe and heel, quite
wonderfully. Tackleton no sooner sees this, than he
skims across to Mrs. Fielding, takes her round the
waist, and follows suit. Old Dot no sooner sees this,
than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs. Dot in the
middle of the dance, and is the foremost there. Caleb
no sooner sees this, than he clutches Tilly Slowboy by
both hands and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy, firm
in the belief that diving hotly in among the other
couples, and effecting any number of concussions witb
them, is your only principle of footing it.
<P>Hark! how the Cricket joins the music with its
Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; and how the kettle hums!

<P>   *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *

<P>But what is this! Even as I listen to them, blithely
and turn towards Dot, for one last glimpse of a little,
figure very pleasant to me, she and the rest have van-
ished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings
upon the Hearth; a broken child's-toy lies upon the
ground; and nothing else remains.
