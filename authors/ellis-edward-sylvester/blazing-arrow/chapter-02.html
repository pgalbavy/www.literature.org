<p>Meanwhile young Edwards found himself a stirring actor in a stirring
series of events.</p>

<p>He set out with all the ardor of a young hunter to bring down
the bear, which was the most enormous one he had ever seen in
the Kentucky wilds. His fondness for his jovial companion led
him to give him what seemed to be the best chance to secure him;
and it may be said that, had the situations of the youths been
reversed, bruin would have quickly fallen a victim to the prowess
of the young Kentuckian. But fate made a turn of the wheel of
fortune of which neither dreamed.</p>

<p>Wharton Edwards possessed wonderful fleetness of foot, and counted
on no trouble in running down the lumbering beast; but when he
struck the point where he ought to have been visible, he was not
in sight.</p>

<p>The acute hearing of the youth, however, told him where the bear
was plunging through the undergrowth. It was in the direction
of the stream, and fearful that he would escape him altogether,
Wharton took up the pursuit with all the energy at his command.</p>

<p>The momentary pause had given the bear an advantage which he
used with a sagacity worthy of a more intelligent creature than
he. Without turning to the right or left, he swung ponderously
along until he reached the edge of the torrent, into which he
tumbled like a rock falling down the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>"I've got you now!" was the exultant exclamation of the youth,
who reached the point where bruin had disappeared within ten seconds
afterwards.</p>

<p>An exasperating state of affairs confronted him. The high, rocky
bluff on each side of the swift current shut out all view of the
water within two or three yards of the side on which the spectator
happened to stand. Whether instinct led the bear to adopt the
course he did is uncertain, but it is hardly credible, since his
species are well known to be stupid; but, be that as it may, this
specimen, instead of making for the other bank, kept so near to
the one from which he had leaped that young Edwards could not
see him. The only way in which he could gain a view of him was
by lying down on his face and peering over.</p>

<p>He had no time to do this, besides which, under the circumstances,
it was almost impossible to gain a shot at the swimming bear.</p>

<p>The presumption was that he would make for the other bank in
quest of some opening by which to leave the water, but Wharton,
in his eagerness, was unwilling to count upon that.</p>

<p>"If I were upon the other side," was his thought, as he hurried
nervously along the bluff, seeking to keep pace with the rushing
current, "I would have him just where I wanted him. But I shall
lose him, for there is no way to get across&mdash;yes there is, and
I'll do it, sure as a gun."</p>

<p>A hundred yards below, and quite near the falls, the bluffs approached
each other so closely that he was sure he could leap from one
to the other. Thus in a bound he could place himself in the best
position to shoot the game against which he began to feel a resentment
because of the manner in which it baffled him.</p>

<p>Had young Edwards been more familiar with his immediate surroundings,
or less enthusiastic in his pursuit of the prize, he would have
hesitated, and, adopting the good old adage, looked before he
leaped; but he was carried away by the excitement of the moment,
and did that which no one would have been quicker than he, under
other circumstances, to condemn.</p>

<p>Running rapidly along the bluff, and parallel with the course
of the stream, he reached the narrow portion upon which he had
fixed his eye, gave it a glance, and decided that by no great
effort he could leap to the corresponding bluff on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>And beyond a doubt he would have succeeded had he used only ordinary
precaution, but he was in dread lest the bear should escape him.
The falls were but a short way below, and though the raging waters
were likely to finish him, that of itself would spoil everything.
No hunter likes to see another take his game out of his hands,
and he viewed such a loss through the falls in the same light.
His blood was up, and he meant to secure the animal if it was
"in the wood."</p>

<p>Stepping hastily back for a couple of paces, he gathered himself,
ran the distance, and, concentrating his strength in the effort,
leaped toward the opposite bluff.</p>

<p>The instant he left the ledge he saw to his horror that he was
going to fall. A leaper or runner always feels what is coming
before the crisis is upon him, and Wharton Edwards knew he had
made an awful miscalculation.</p>

<p>With the desperation of despair he flung his rifle from him at
the instant of leaping, and when it was too late to withdraw.
It landed on the rocks, and the impact of the hammer caused its
discharge, the ball, by a singular concurrence of circumstances,
passing within a few inches of the owner's face.</p>

<p>It was only for a passing breath that the youth was in the air,
but it seemed to him he was held suspended for several minutes
over the raging waters. He struck only a few inches short, but
those few inches were fatal. His chest and lower part of the body
collided violently with the solid wall, and his hands were thrown
over the surface on which he had hoped and expected to place his
feet.</p>

<p>He clutched fiercely to save himself, and had there been anything
to grasp must have succeeded; but there was nothing, and, rebounding
fully a foot, he went down into the torrent twenty feet below.
As if fate meant to dally with and mock him, he splashed within
a few feet of the bear, who, with a snuff of fear, turned away
and began a wild effort to swim against the current. The brute
had become aware of the roaring falls close at hand, and saw the
trap in which he was caught, and from which it was impossible
to extricate himself until, as may be said, he was almost on the
brink of the falls.</p>

<p>A short distance from the plunge was a gap in the bluff, where
the ground was only a few inches above the surface of the water.
If the brute should hold himself close to the bank on that side
until this favoring point was reached, he could save himself.</p>

<p>And he did, though little credit belonged to him for the feat.
Like the stupid creature that he was, he continued furiously striving
to swim against the current, and without stemming it in the least;
but the same blind instinct kept him clawing at the rocks on the
side from which he had leaped, and thus held him in the only position
which gave the slightest hope.</p>

<p>All at once the beam-like claws struck the rocky bottom. The
water quickly shallowed. By a prodigious effort he checked his
swift downward progress&mdash;then he secured a foothold&mdash;his massive,
shaggy body heaved up from the water&mdash;he plunged heavily to one
side, and, with another mighty putting forth of his strength,
walked out upon the solid earth and was safe.</p>

<p>Beyond peradventure, Wharton Edwards would have done equally
well had the opportunity been given him to study for a few seconds
his perilous surroundings. He would have been quick to see the
opening through which his intended prize escaped, and the gorge
was so narrow that he could readily have swam across to it in
the few moments at his command; but the youth was in a hapless
situation.</p>

<p>He landed against the bluff with such violence that the breath
was driven from his body, and when he struck the water he was
senseless. The rush of the chilling current, as he shot below
the surface, partly revived him, and he made an instinctive effort
at self-preservation. The blow, however, had been severe, and
his brain was in a whirl the next moment, the torrent carrying
him with great swiftness toward the falls.</p>

<p>Larry Murphy was closer to the stream than he had supposed, while
reloading his rifle. The report of his friend's rifle gave him
the necessary guidance, and he dashed over the intervening distance
at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>A minute later he peered over the bluff, and, without seeing
the bear, which was almost beneath him, saw the head and shoulders
of his friend, who had come to the surface a few seconds before.</p>

<p>"Ye blundering spalpeen, that's no place to go in swimming!"
called the frightened youth, with no suspicion of the mishap that
had occurred.</p>

<p>Undecided what to do, and yet unable to stand idle, Larry ran
along the edge of the bluff, and a minute later saw to his amazement
the bear emerge and shake his dripping coat. It would have been
easy to shoot him down, for there could not have been a fairer
target; but the youth had no thought of bagging game in those
terrible moments, and he bestowed hardly a glance at the brute.</p>

<p>A second look at young Edwards told him that something was wrong.</p>

<p>"Swim toward me!" shouted Larry, loud enough for his clear voice
to be heard above the thunder of the waters.</p>

<p>He had bounded headlong down the sloping bluff, and then off
into the open low space, which offered the only hope. It was a
high leap, but in his excitement he did not notice it.</p>

<p>"Swim hard, ould felly, or it'll be too late&mdash;hivin save me,
but he's drowning!"</p>

<p>Wharton's head was dipping below the surface, and his arms had
ceased the feeble struggles they made a short time before. The
youth was really drowning.</p>

<p>He was now so nearly opposite the opening in the bluff, and so
near the plunge of waters, that had he been in the full possession
of his senses and strength he could have swam the space, brief
as it was, only by the most desperate efforts. In his senseless
condition he could not accomplish it, of course, had he been in
water as still as a mill pond.</p>

<p>Larry Murphy saw and comprehended all this in the twinkling of
an eye. He knew that if he stood where he was it would be to see
his loved friend die, and if he plunged in after him both would
go over the falls, with possibly one chance in a thousand of their
escape.</p>

<p>And did he, while quickly weighing the chances, hesitate?</p>
