<p>As his train slowed down through the darkness and stopped at
the snow-choked station, Duane, carrying suit-case, satchel, and
fur coat, swung himself off the icy steps of the smoker and stood
for a moment on the platform in the yellow glare of the railway
lanterns, looking about him.</p>

<p>Sleigh-bells sounded near&mdash;chiming through the still, cold air;
he caught sight of two shadowy restive horses, a gaily plumed
sleigh, and, at the same moment, the driver leaned sideways from
her buffalo-robed seat, calling out to him by name.</p>

<p>"Why, Kathleen!" he exclaimed, hastening forward. "Did you really
drive down here all alone to meet me?"</p>

<p>She bent over and saluted him, demure, amused, bewitchingly pretty
in her Isabella bear furs:</p>

<p>"I really did, Duane, without even a groom, so we could talk
about everything and anything all the way home. Give your checks
to the station agent&mdash;there he is! &mdash;Oh, Mr. Whitley, would
you mind sending up Mr. Mallett's trunks to-night? Thank you <em>so</em>
much. Now, Duane, dear&#11834;"</p>

<p>He tossed suit-case and satchel into the sleigh, put on his fur
coat, and climbing up beside Kathleen, burrowed into the robes.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," he said seriously, "you're getting to be a
howling beauty; not just an ordinary beauty, but a miracle. Do
you mind if I kiss you again?"</p>

<p>"Not after that," she said, presenting him a fresh-curved cheek
tinted with rose, and snowy cold. Then, laughing, she swung the
impatient horses to the left; a jingling shower of golden bell-notes
followed; and they were off through the starlight, tearing northward
across the snow.</p>

<p>"Duane!" she said, pulling the young horses down into a swift,
swinging trot, "<em>what</em> do you think! Geraldine doesn't
know you're coming!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, surprised. "I telegraphed."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she's been on the mountain with old Miller for three
days. Three of your letters are waiting for her; and then came
your telegram, and of course Scott and I thought we ought to open
it."</p>

<p>"Of course. But what on earth sent Geraldine up the Golden Dome
in the dead of winter?"</p>

<p>Kathleen shook her pretty head:</p>

<p>"She's turned into the most uncontrollable sporting proposition
you ever heard of! She's up there at Lynx Peak camp, with her
rifle, and old Miller. They're after that big boar&mdash;the biggest,
horridest thing in the whole forest. I saw him once. He's disgusting.
Scott objected, and so did I, but, somehow, I'm becoming reconciled
to these break-neck enterprises she goes in for so hard&mdash;so terribly
hard, Duane! and all I do is to fuss a little and make a few tearful
objections, and she laughs and does what she pleases."</p>

<p>He said: "It is better, is it not, to let her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Kathleen quietly, "it is better. That is why
I say very little."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, but the constraint did not last.</p>

<p>"It's twenty below zero, my poor friend," observed Kathleen.
"Luckily, there is no wind to-night, but, all the same, you ought
to keep in touch with your nose and ears."</p>

<p>Duane investigated cautiously.</p>

<p>"My features are still sticking to my face," he announced; "is
it really twenty below? It doesn't seem so."</p>

<p>"It is. Yesterday the thermometers registered thirty below, but
nobody here minds it when the wind doesn't blow; and Geraldine
has acquired the most exquisite colour!&mdash;and she's so maddeningly
pretty, Duane, and actually plump, in that long slim way of hers....
And there's another thing; she is <em>happier</em> than she has
been for a long, long while."</p>

<p>"Has that fact any particular significance to you?" he asked
slowly.</p>

<p>"Vital!... Do you understand me, Duane, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A moment later she called in her clear voice: "Gate, please!"
A lantern flashed; a door opened in the lodge; there came a crunch
of snow, a creak, and the gates of Roya-Neh swung wide in the
starlight.</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded her thanks to the keeper, let the whip whistle,
and spent several minutes in consequence recovering control of
the fiery young horses who were racing like scared deer. The road
was wide, crossed here and there by snowy "rides," and bordered
by the splendid Roya-Neh forests; wide enough to admit a white
glow from myriads of stars. Never had Duane seen so many stars
swarming in the heavens; the winter constellations were magnificent,
their diamond-like lustre silvered the world.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to hear all the news, all the gossip, from
three snow-bound rustics, don't you?" she asked. "Well, then,
let me immediately report a most overwhelming tragedy. Scott has
just discovered that several inconsiderate entomologists, who
died before he was born, all wrote elaborate life histories of
the Rose-beetle. Isn't it pathetic? And he's worked <em>so</em>
hard, and he's been like a father to the horrid young grubs, feeding
them nice juicy roots, taking their weights and measures, photographing
them, counting their degraded internal organs&mdash;oh, it is too vexing!
Because, if you should ask me, I may say that I've been a mother
to them, too, and it enrages me to find out that all those wretched,
squirming, thankless creatures have been petted and studied and
have had their legs counted and their Bertillon measurements taken
years before either Scott or I came into this old fraud of a scientific
world!"</p>

<p>Duane's unrestrained laughter excited her merriment; the star-lit
woodlands rang with it and the treble chiming of the sleigh-bells.</p>

<p>"What on earth will he find to do now?" asked Duane.</p>

<p>"He's going to see it through, he says. Isn't it fine of him?
There is just a bare chance that he may discover something that
those prying entomological people overlooked. Anyway, we are going
to devote next summer to studying the parasites of the Rose-beetle,
and try to find out what sort of creatures prey upon them. And
I want to tell you something exciting, Duane. Promise you won't
breathe one word!"</p>

<p>"Not a word!"</p>

<p>"Well, then &mdash;Scott was going to tell you, anyway!&mdash;we <em>think</em>&mdash;but,
of course, we are not sure by any means!&mdash;but we venture to think
that we have discovered a disease which kills Rose-beetles. We
don't know exactly what it is yet, or how they get it, but we
are practically convinced that it is a sort of fungus."</p>

<p>She was very serious, very earnest, charming in her conscientious
imitation of that scientific caution which abhors speculation
and never dares assert anything except dry and proven facts.</p>

<p>"What are you and Scott aiming at? Are you going to try to start
an epidemic among the Rose-beetles?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's far too early to even outline our ideas&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That's right; don't tell anything Scott wants to keep quiet
about! I'll never say a word, Kathleen, only if you'll take my
advice, feed 'em fungus! Stuff 'em with it three times a day&mdash;give
it to them boiled, fried, au gratin, à la Newburg! That'll fetch
'em!... How is old Scott, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well," she said demurely. "He informs us daily that
he weighs one hundred and ninety pounds, and stands six feet two
in his snow-shoes. He always mentions it when he tells us that
he is going to scrub your face in a snow-drift, and Geraldine
invariably insists that he isn't man enough. You know, as a matter
of fact, we're all behaving like very silly children up here.
Goodness knows what the servants think." Her smiling face became
graver.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that matters are settled and that there's enough
of your estate left to keep your mother and Naïda in comfort."</p>

<p>He nodded. "How is Scott coming out?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he'll tell you. I don't believe he has very much left.
Geraldine's part is sufficient to run Roya-Neh, and the house
in town, if she and Scott conclude to keep it. Old Mr. Tappan
has been quite wonderful. Why, Duane, he's a perfect old dear;
and we all are so terribly contrite and so anxious to make amends
for our horrid attitude toward him when he ruled us with an iron
rod."</p>

<p>"He's a funny old duck," mused Duane. "That son of his, Peter,
has had the 'indiwidool cultiwated' clean out of him. He's only
a type, like Gibson's drawings of Tag's son. Old Tappan may be
as honest as a block of granite, but it's an awful thing that
he should ever have presided over the destinies of children."</p>

<p>Kathleen sighed. "According to his light he was faithful. I know
that his system was almost impossible; I had to live and see my
children driven into themselves until they were becoming too self-centred
to care for anything else&mdash;to realise that there was anything
else or anybody else except their wishes and themselves to consider....
But, Duane, you see the right quality was latent in them. They
are coming out&mdash;they have emerged splendidly. It has altered their
lives fundamentally, of course, but, sometimes, I wonder whether,
in their particular cases, it was not better to cripple the easy,
irresponsible, and delightfully casual social instincts of the
House of Seagrave. Educated according to my own ideas, they must
inevitably have become, in a measure, types of the set with which
they are identified.... And the only serious flaw in the Seagraves
was&mdash;weakness."</p>

<p>Duane nodded, looking ahead into the star-illumined night.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Tappan's poison may have been the antidote for
them in this case. Tell me, Kathleen, has Geraldine&mdash;suffered?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;much?"</p>

<p>"Very much, Duane. Has she said nothing about it to you in her
letters?"</p>

<p>"Nothing since she went to town that time. Every letter flies
the red cross. Does she still suffer?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. She seems so wonderfully happy&mdash;so vigorous,
in such superb physical condition. For a month I have not seen
that pitiful, haunted expression come into her eyes. And it is
not mere restlessness that drives her into perpetual motion now;
it's a new delight in living hard and with all her might every
moment of the day!... She overdoes it; you will turn her energy
into other channels. She's ready for you, I think."</p>

<p>They drove on in silence for a few minutes, then swung into a
broader avenue of pines. Straight ahead glimmered the lights of
Roya-Neh.</p>

<p>Duane said naïvely: "I don't suppose I could get up to Lynx Peak
camp to-night, could I?"</p>

<p>Kathleen threw back her head, making no effort to control her
laughter.</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary," she managed to explain; "I sent a messenger
up the mountain with a note to her saying that matters of importance
required her immediate return. She'll come down to-night by sleigh
from The Green Pass and Westgate Centre."</p>

<p>"Won't she be furious?" he inquired, with a hypocritical side
glance at Kathleen, who laughed derisively and drew in the horses
under the porte-cochère. A groom took their heads; Duane swung
Kathleen clear to the steps just as Scott Seagrave, hearing sleigh-bells,
came out, bareheaded, his dinner-jacket wide open, as though he
luxuriated in the bitter air.</p>

<p>"Good work!" he said. "How are you, Duane? Geraldine arrived
from The Green Pass about five minutes ago. She thinks you're
sleighing, Kathleen, and she's tremendously curious to know why
you want her."</p>

<p>"She probably suspects," said Kathleen, disappointed.</p>

<p>"No, she doesn't. I began to talk business immediately, and I
know she thinks that some of Mr. Tappan's lawyers are coming.
So they are&mdash;next month," he added with a grin, and, turning on
Duane:</p>

<p>"I think I'll begin festivities by washing your face in the snow."</p>

<p>"You're not man enough," remarked the other; and the next moment
they had clinched and were swaying and struggling all over the
terrace, to the scandal of the servants peering from the door.</p>

<p>"He's tired and half frozen!" exclaimed Kathleen; "what a brute
you are to bully him, Scott!"</p>

<p>"I'll include you in a moment," he panted, loosing Duane and
snatching a handful of snow. Whereupon she caught up sufficient
snow to fill the hollow of her driving glove, powdered his face
thoroughly with the feathery flakes, picked up her skirt and ran
for it, knowing full well she could expect no mercy.</p>

<p>Duane watched their reckless flight through the hall and upstairs,
then walked in, dropped his coat, and advanced across the heavy
rugs toward the fireplace.</p>

<p>On the landing above he heard Geraldine's laughter, then silence,
then her clear, careless singing as she descended the stairs:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Lisetto quittée la plaine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moi perdi bonheur à moi&mdash;<br/>
Yeux à moi semblent fontaine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Depuis moi pas miré toi!"

</p>
</div>
<p>At the doorway she halted, seeing a man's figure silhouetted
against the firelight. Then she moved forward inquiringly, the
ruddy glow full in her brown eyes; and a little shock passed straight
through her.</p>

<p>"Duane!" she whispered.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms, kissed her, locked her closer; her
arms sought his head, clung, quivered, fell away; and with a nervous
movement she twisted clear of him and stood breathing fast, the
clamour of her heart almost suffocating her. And when again he
would have drawn her to him she eluded him, wide-eyed, flushed,
lips parted in the struggle for speech which came at last, brokenly:</p>

<p>"Dear, you must not take me&mdash;that way&mdash;yet. I am not ready, Duane.
You must give me time!"</p>

<p>"Time! Is anything&mdash;has anything gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no, no, no! Don't you understand I must take my own
time? I've won the right to it; I'm winning out, Duane&mdash;winning
back myself. I must have my little year of self-respect. Oh, <em>can't</em>
you understand that you mustn't sweep me off my feet this way?&mdash;that
I'm too proud to go to you&mdash;have you take me while there remains
the faintest shadow of risk?"</p>

<p>"But I don't care! I want you!" he cried.</p>

<p>"I love you for it; I want you, Duane. But be fair to me; don't
take me until I am as clean and straight and untainted as the
girl I was&mdash;as I am becoming&mdash;as I will be&mdash;surely, surely&mdash;my
darling!"</p>

<p>She caught his hands in hers and, close to him, looked into his
eyes smilingly, tearfully, and a little proudly. The sensitive
under-lip quivered; but she held her head high.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me to give you what is less perfect than I can make
it. Don't let me remember my gift and be ashamed, dear. There
must be no memory of your mistaken generosity to trouble me in
the years to come&mdash;the long, splendid years with you. Let me always
remember that I gave you myself as I really can be; let me always
know that neither your love nor compassion were needed to overlook
any flaw in what I give."</p>

<p>She bent her proud little head and laid her lips on his hands,
which she held close between her own.</p>

<p>"You can so easily carry me by storm, Duane; and in your arms
I might be weak enough to waver and forget and promise to give
you now what there is of me if you demanded it. Don't ask it;
don't carry me out of my depth. There is more to me than I can
give you yet. Let me wait to give it lest I remember your unfairness
and my humiliation through the years to come."</p>

<p>She lifted her lips to his, offering them; he kissed her; then,
with a little laugh, she abandoned his hands and stepped back,
mocking, tormenting, enjoying his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"It's cruel, isn't it, you poor lamb! But do you know the year
is already flying very, very fast? Do you think I'm not counting
the days?"&mdash;and, suddenly yielding&mdash;"if you wish&mdash;if you truly
do wish it, dear, I will marry you on the very day that the year&mdash;my
year&mdash;ends. Come over here"&mdash;she seated herself and made a place
for him&mdash;"and you won't caress me too much&mdash;will you? You wouldn't
make me unhappy, would you?... Why, yes, I suppose that I might
let you touch me occasionally.... And kiss me&mdash;at rare intervals....
But not&mdash;as we have.... You won't, will you? Then you may sit
here&mdash;a little nearer if you think it wise&mdash;and I'm ready to listen
to your views concerning anything on earth, Duane, even including
love and wedlock."</p>

<p>It was very hard for them to judge just what they might or might
not permit each other&mdash;how near it was perfectly safe to sit,
how long they might, with impunity, look into each other's eyes
in that odd and rather silly fashion which never seems to be out
of date.</p>

<p>What worried him was the notion that if she would only marry
him at once her safety was secured beyond question; but she explained
very sweetly that her safety was almost secured already; that,
if let alone, she was at present in absolute command of her fate,
mistress of her desires, in full tide of self-control. Now all
she required was an interval to develop character and self-mastery,
so that they could meet on even ground and equal terms when the
day arrived for her to surrender to him the soul and body she
had regained.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's all right," he said with a sigh, but utterly
unconvinced. "You always were fair about things, and if it's your
idea of justice to me and to yourself, that settles it."</p>

<p>"You dear old stupid!" she said, tenderly amused; "it is the
best thing for our future. The 'sphere of influence' and the 'balance
of power' are as delicate matters to adjust in marriage as they
are in world-politics. You're going to be too famous a painter
for your wife to be anything less than a thorough woman."</p>

<p>She drew a little away from him, bent her head and clasped both
hands around her knee.</p>

<p>"There is another reason why I should be in autocratic command
over myself when we marry.... It is difficult for me to explain
to you.... Do you remember that I wrote you once that I was&mdash;afraid
to marry you&mdash;<em>not</em> for our own sakes?"</p>

<p>Her young face was grave and serious; she bent her gaze on her
ringless fingers.</p>

<p>"That," she said, "is the most vital and&mdash;sacred reason of all."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear." He did not dare to touch her, scarcely dared look
at the pure, thoughtful profile until she lifted her head and
her fearless eyes sought his.</p>

<p>And they smiled, unembarrassed, unafraid.</p>

</div>
<p>"Those people are deliberately leaving us here to spoon," she
declared indignantly. "I know perfectly well that dinner was announced
ages ago!" And, raising her voice: "Scott, you silly ninny! Where
in the world are you?"</p>

<p>Scott appeared with alacrity from the library, evidently detained
there in hunger and impatience by Kathleen, who came in a moment
later, pretty eyes innocently perplexed.</p>

<p>"I declare," she said, "it is nine o'clock and dinner is supposed
to be served at eight!" And she seemed more surprised than ever
when old Howker, who evidently had been listening off stage, entered
with reproachful dignity and announced that ceremony.</p>

<p>And it was the gayest kind of a ceremony, for they ate and chattered
and laughed there together as inconsequentially as four children,
and when Howker, with pomp and circumstance, brought in a roast
boar's head garnished with holly-like crimson elder, they all
stood up and cheered as though they really liked the idea of eating
it. However, there was, from the same animal, a saddle to follow
the jowl, which everybody tasted and only Scott really liked;
and, to Duane's uneasy surprise, great silver tankards of delicious
home-brewed ale were set at every cover except Geraldine's.</p>

<p>Catching his eye she shrugged slightly and smiled; and her engaging
glance returned to him at intervals, reassuring, humorously disdainful;
and her serenely amused smile seemed to say:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, please enjoy your ale. There is not the slightest
desire on my part to join you."</p>

<p>"That isn't a very big wild boar," observed Scott, critically
eyeing the saddle.</p>

<p>"It's a two-year-old," admitted Geraldine. "I only shot him because
Lacy said we were out of meat."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> killed him!" exclaimed Duane.</p>

<p>She gave him a condescending glance; and Scott laughed.</p>

<p>"She and Miller save this establishment from daily famine," he
said. "You have no idea how many deer and boar it takes to keep
the game within limits and ourselves and domestics decently fed.
Just look at the heads up there on the walls." He waved his arm
around the oak wainscoting, where, at intervals, the great furry
heads of wild boar loomed in the candlelight, ears and mane on
end, eyes and white sabre-like tusks gleaming. "Those are Geraldine's,"
he said with brotherly pride.</p>

<p>"I want to shoot one, too!" said Duane firmly. "Do you think
I'm going to let my affianced put it all over me like that?"</p>

<p>"<em>Isn't</em> it like a man?" said Geraldine, appealing to
Kathleen. "They simply can't endure it if a girl ventures competition&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You talk like a suffragette," observed her brother. "Duane doesn't
care how many piglings you shoot; he wants to go out alone and
get that old grandfather of all boars, the one which kept you
on the mountain for the last three days&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>My</em> boar!" she cried indignantly. "I won't have it!
I won't let him. Oh, Duane, <em>am</em> I a pig to want to manage
this affair when I've been after him all winter?&mdash;and he's the
biggest, grayest, wiliest thing you ever saw&mdash;a perfectly enormous
silvery fellow with two pairs of Japanese sabre-sheaths for tusks
and a mane like a lion, and a double bend in his nose and&#11834;"</p>

<p>Shouts of laughter checked her flushed animation.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not going to sneak out all alone and pot your
old pig," said Duane; "I'll find one for myself on some other
mountain&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I want you to shoot with me!" she exclaimed in dismay. "I
wanted you to see me stalk this boar and mark him down, and have
you kill him. Oh, Duane, that was the fun. I've been saving him,
I really have. Miller knows that I had a shot once&mdash;a pretty good
one&mdash;and wouldn't take it. I killed a four-year near Hurryon instead,
just to save that one&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're the finest little sport in the land!" said Duane, "and
we are just tormenting you. Of course I'll go with you, but I'm
blessed if I pull trigger on that gentleman pig&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em>! I've saved him. Scott, make him say he will!
Kathleen, this is really too annoying! A girl plans and plans
and pictures to herself the happiness and surprise she's going
to give a man, and he's too stupid to comprehend&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Meaning me!" observed Duane. "But I leave it to you, Scott;
a man can't do such a thing decently&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you silly people," laughed Kathleen; "you may never again
see that boar. Denman, keeper at Northgate when Mr. Atwood owned
the estate, told me that everybody had been after that boar and
nobody ever got a shot at him. Which," she added, "does not surprise
me, as there are some hundred square miles of mountain and forest
on this estate, and Scott is lazy and aging very fast."</p>

<p>"By the way, Sis, you say you got a four-year near The Green
Pass?"</p>

<p>She nodded, busy with her bon-bon.</p>

<p>"Was it exciting?" asked Duane, secretly eaten up with pride
over her achievements and sportsmanship.</p>

<p>"No, not very." She went on with her bon-bon, then glanced up
at her brother, askance, like a bad child afraid of being reported.</p>

<p>"Old Miller is so fussy," she said&mdash;"the old, spoilt tyrant!
He is really very absurd sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oho!" said Scott suspiciously, "so Miller is coming to me again!"</p>

<p>"He &mdash;I'm afraid he is. Did you," appealing to Kathleen,
"ever know a more obstinate, unreasoning old man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Geraldine! What did you do!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Scott, annoyed, "what the deuce have you been up
to now? Miller is perfectly right; he's an old hunter and knows
his business, and when he comes to me and complains that you take
fool risks, he's doing his duty!"</p>

<p>He turned to Duane:</p>

<p>"That idiot girl," he said, nodding toward his abashed sister,
"knocked over a boar last month, ran up to look at his tusks,
and was hurled into a snowdrift by the beast, who was only creased.
He went for Miller, too, and how he and my sister ever escaped
without a terrible slashing before Geraldine shot the brute, nobody
knows.... There's his head up there&mdash;the wicked-looking one over
the fireplace."</p>

<p>"That's not good sportsmanship," said Duane gravely.</p>

<p>Geraldine hung her head, colouring.</p>

<p>"I know it; I mean to keep cool; truly, I do. But things happen
so quickly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why are you afraid Miller is going to complain?" interrupted
her brother.</p>

<p>"Scott&mdash;it wasn't anything very much&mdash;that is, I didn't think
so. You'd have done it&mdash;you know it's a point of honour to track
down wounded game."</p>

<p>She turned to Duane:</p>

<p>"The Green Pass feeding-ground was about a thousand yards ahead
in the alders, and I made Miller wait while I crept up. There
was a fine boar feeding about two hundred yards off, and I fired
and he went over like a cat in a fit, and then up and off, and
I after him, and Miller after me, telling me to look out."</p>

<p>She laughed excitedly, and made a little gesture. "That's just
why I ran&mdash;to look out!&mdash;and the trail was deep and strong and
not much blood-dust. I was so vexed, so distressed, because it
was almost sunset and the boar seemed to be going strongly and
faster than a grayhound. And suddenly Miller shouted something
about 'scrub hemlock' &mdash;I didn't know he meant for me to
halt!&mdash;So I &mdash;I"&mdash;she looked anxiously at her brother&mdash;"I
jumped into the scrub and kicked him up before I knew it&mdash;and
he&mdash;he tore my kilts&mdash;just one or two tears, but it didn't wound
me, Scott, it only just made my leg black and blue&mdash;and, anyway,
I got him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord," groaned her brother, "don't you know enough to reconnoitre
a wounded boar in the scrub? <em>I</em> don't know why he didn't
rip you. Do you want to be killed by a <em>pig</em>? What's the
use of being all cut and bitten to pieces, anyway?"</p>

<p>"No use, dear," she admitted so meekly that Duane scarcely managed
to retain his gravity.</p>

<p>She came over and humbly slipped her arm through his as they
all rose from the table.</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm a perfect idiot," she said under her breath;
"it's only inexperience under excitement. You'll see that I've
learned a lot when we go out together. Miller will admit that
I'm usually prudent, because, two weeks ago, I hit a boar and
he charged me, and my rifle jammed, and I went up a tree! Wasn't
that prudent?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he said gravely; "only I'd feel safer if you went
up a tree in the first place and remained there. What a child
you are, anyway!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," she confided in him, "I am a regular baby sometimes.
I do the silliest things in the woods. Once I gave Miller the
slip and went off and built a doll's house out of snow and made
three snow dolls and played with them! Isn't that the silliest
thing? And another time a boar came out by the Westgate Oaks,
and he was a black, hairy fellow, and so funny with his chin-whiskers
all dotted with icicles that I began to say aloud:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'I swear by the beard<br/>
On my chinny-chin-chin&mdash;'

</p>
</div>
<p>And of course he was off before I could pull trigger for laughing.
Isn't that foolish?"</p>

<p>"Adorably," he whispered. "You are finding the little girl in
the garden, Geraldine."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, serious, wistful.</p>

<p>"It's the boy who found her; I only helped. But I want to bring
her home all alone."</p>
