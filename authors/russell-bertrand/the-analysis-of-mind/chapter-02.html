<p>In attempting to understand the elements out of which mental
phenomena are compounded, it is of the greatest importance to
remember that from the protozoa to man there is nowhere a very
wide gap either in structure or in behaviour. From this fact it
is a highly probable inference that there is also nowhere a very
wide mental gap. It is, of course, <em>POSSIBLE </em>that there
may be, at certain stages in evolution, elements which are entirely
new from the standpoint of analysis, though in their nascent form
they have little influence on behaviour and no very marked correlatives
in structure. But the hypothesis of continuity in mental development
is clearly preferable if no psychological facts make it impossible.
We shall find, if I am not mistaken, that there are no facts which
refute the hypothesis of mental continuity, and that, on the other
hand, this hypothesis affords a useful test of suggested theories
as to the nature of mind.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of mental continuity throughout organic evolution
may be used in two different ways. On the one hand, it may be
held that we have more knowledge of our own minds than those of
animals, and that we should use this knowledge to infer the existence
of something similar to our own mental processes in animals and
even in plants. On the other hand, it may be held that animals
and plants present simpler phenomena, more easily analysed than
those of human minds; on this ground it may be urged that explanations
which are adequate in the case of animals ought not to be lightly
rejected in the case of man. The practical effects of these two
views are diametrically opposite: the first leads us to level
up animal intelligence with what we believe ourselves to know
about our own intelligence, while the second leads us to attempt
a levelling down of our own intelligence to something not too
remote from what we can observe in animals. It is therefore important
to consider the relative justification of the two ways of applying
the principle of continuity.</p>

<p>It is clear that the question turns upon another, namely, which
can we know best, the psychology of animals or that of human beings?
If we can know most about animals, we shall use this knowledge
as a basis for inference about human beings; if we can know most
about human beings, we shall adopt the opposite procedure. And
the question whether we can know most about the psychology of
human beings or about that of animals turns upon yet another,
namely: Is introspection or external observation the surer method
in psychology? This is a question which I propose to discuss at
length in Lecture VI; I shall therefore content myself now with
a statement of the conclusions to be arrived at.</p>

<p>We know a great many things concerning ourselves which we cannot
know nearly so directly concerning animals or even other people.
We know when we have a toothache, what we are thinking of, what
dreams we have when we are asleep, and a host of other occurrences
which we only know about others when they tell us of them, or
otherwise make them inferable by their behaviour. Thus, so far
as knowledge of detached facts is concerned, the advantage is
on the side of self-knowledge as against external observation.</p>

<p>But when we come to the analysis and scientific understanding
of the facts, the advantages on the side of self-knowledge become
far less clear. We know, for example, that we have desires and
beliefs, but we do not know what constitutes a desire or a belief.
The phenomena are so familiar that it is difficult to realize
how little we really know about them. We see in animals, and to
a lesser extent in plants, behaviour more or less similar to that
which, in us, is prompted by desires and beliefs, and we find
that, as we descend in the scale of evolution, behaviour becomes
simpler, more easily reducible to rule, more scientifically analysable
and predictable. And just because we are not misled by familiarity
we find it easier to be cautious in interpreting behaviour when
we are dealing with phenomena remote from those of our own minds:
Moreover, introspection, as psychoanalysis has demonstrated, is
extraordinarily fallible even in cases where we feel a high degree
of certainty. The net result seems to be that, though self-knowledge
has a definite and important contribution to make to psychology,
it is exceedingly misleading unless it is constantly checked and
controlled by the test of external observation, and by the theories
which such observation suggests when applied to animal behaviour.
On the whole, therefore, there is probably more to be learnt about
human psychology from animals than about animal psychology from
human beings; but this conclusion is one of degree, and must not
be pressed beyond a point.</p>

<p>It is only bodily phenomena that can be directly observed in
animals, or even, strictly speaking, in other human beings. We
can observe such things as their movements, their physiological
processes, and the sounds they emit. Such things as desires and
beliefs, which seem obvious to introspection, are not visible
directly to external observation. Accordingly, if we begin our
study of psychology by external observation, we must not begin
by assuming such things as desires and beliefs, but only such
things as external observation can reveal, which will be characteristics
of the movements and physiological processes of animals. Some
animals, for example, always run away from light and hide themselves
in dark places. If you pick up a mossy stone which is lightly
embedded in the earth, you will see a number of small animals
scuttling away from the unwonted daylight and seeking again the
darkness of which you have deprived them. Such animals are sensitive
to light, in the sense that their movements are affected by it;
but it would be rash to infer that they have sensations in any
way analogous to our sensations of sight. Such inferences, which
go beyond the observable facts, are to be avoided with the utmost
care.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide human movements into three classes,
voluntary, reflex and mechanical. We may illustrate the distinction
by a quotation from William James ("Psychology," i, 12):</p>

<p>"If I hear the conductor calling 'all aboard' as I enter the
depot, my heart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs respond
to the air-waves falling on my tympanum by quickening their movements.
If I stumble as I run, the sensation of falling provokes a movement
of the hands towards the direction of the fall, the effect of
which is to shield the body from too sudden a shock. If a cinder
enter my eye, its lids close forcibly and a copious flow of tears
tends to wash it out.</p>

<p>"These three responses to a sensational stimulus differ, however,
in many respects. The closure of the eye and the lachrymation
are quite involuntary, and so is the disturbance of the heart.
Such involuntary responses we know as 'reflex' acts. The motion
of the arms to break the shock of falling may also be called reflex,
since it occurs too quickly to be deliberately intended. Whether
it be instinctive or whether it result from the pedestrian education
of childhood may be doubtful; it is, at any rate, less automatic
than the previous acts, for a man might by conscious effort learn
to perform it more skilfully, or even to suppress it altogether.
Actions of this kind, with which instinct and volition enter upon
equal terms, have been called 'semi-reflex.' The act of running
towards the train, on the other hand, has no instinctive element
about it. It is purely the result of education, and is preceded
by a consciousness of the purpose to be attained and a distinct
mandate of the will. It is a 'voluntary act.' Thus the animal's
reflex and voluntary performances shade into each other gradually,
being connected by acts which may often occur automatically, but
may also be modified by conscious intelligence.</p>

<p>"An outside observer, unable to perceive the accompanying consciousness,
might be wholly at a loss to discriminate between the automatic
acts and those which volition escorted. But if the criterion of
mind's existence be the choice of the proper means for the attainment
of a supposed end, all the acts alike seem to be inspired by intelligence,
for <em>APPROPRIATENESS </em>characterizes them all alike."</p>

<p>There is one movement, among those that James mentions at first,
which is not subsequently classified, namely, the stumbling. This
is the kind of movement which may be called "mechanical"; it is
evidently of a different kind from either reflex or voluntary
movements, and more akin to the movements of dead matter. We may
define a movement of an animal's body as "mechanical" when it
proceeds as if only dead matter were involved. For example, if
you fall over a cliff, you move under the influence of gravitation,
and your centre of gravity describes just as correct a parabola
as if you were already dead. Mechanical movements have not the
characteristic of appropriateness, unless by accident, as when
a drunken man falls into a waterbutt and is sobered. But reflex
and voluntary movements are not <em>ALWAYS </em>appropriate, unless
in some very recondite sense. A moth flying into a lamp is not
acting sensibly; no more is a man who is in such a hurry to get
his ticket that he cannot remember the name of his destination.
Appropriateness is a complicated and merely approximate idea,
and for the present we shall do well to dismiss it from our thoughts.</p>

<p>As James states, there is no difference, from the point of view
of the outside observer, between voluntary and reflex movements.
The physiologist can discover that both depend upon the nervous
system, and he may find that the movements which we call voluntary
depend upon higher centres in the brain than those that are reflex.
But he cannot discover anything as to the presence or absence
of "will" or "consciousness," for these things can only be seen
from within, if at all. For the present, we wish to place ourselves
resolutely in the position of outside observers; we will therefore
ignore the distinction between voluntary and reflex movements.
We will call the two together "vital" movements. We may then distinguish
"vital" from mechanical movements by the fact that vital movements
depend for their causation upon the special properties of the
nervous system, while mechanical movements depend only upon the
properties which animal bodies share with matter in general.</p>

<p>There is need for some care if the distinction between mechanical
and vital movements is to be made precise. It is quite likely
that, if we knew more about animal bodies, we could deduce all
their movements from the laws of chemistry and physics. It is
already fairly easy to see how chemistry reduces to physics, i.e.
how the differences between different chemical elements can be
accounted for by differences of physical structure, the constituents
of the structure being electrons which are exactly alike in all
kinds of matter. We only know in part how to reduce physiology
to chemistry, but we know enough to make it likely that the reduction
is possible. If we suppose it effected, what would become of the
difference between vital and mechanical movements?</p>

<p>Some analogies will make the difference clear. A shock to a mass
of dynamite produces quite different effects from an equal shock
to a mass of steel: in the one case there is a vast explosion,
while in the other case there is hardly any noticeable disturbance.
Similarly, you may sometimes find on a mountain-side a large rock
poised so delicately that a touch will set it crashing down into
the valley, while the rocks all round are so firm that only a
considerable force can dislodge them What is analogous in these
two cases is the existence of a great store of energy in unstable
equilibrium ready to burst into violent motion by the addition
of a very slight disturbance. Similarly, it requires only a very
slight expenditure of energy to send a post-card with the words
"All is discovered; fly!" but the effect in generating kinetic
energy is said to be amazing. A human body, like a mass of dynamite,
contains a store of energy in unstable equilibrium, ready to be
directed in this direction or that by a disturbance which is physically
very small, such as a spoken word. In all such cases the reduction
of behaviour to physical laws can only be effected by entering
into great minuteness; so long as we confine ourselves to the
observation of comparatively large masses, the way in which the
equilibrium will be upset cannot be determined. Physicists distinguish
between macroscopic and microscopic equations: the former determine
the visible movements of bodies of ordinary size, the latter the
minute occurrences in the smallest parts. It is only the microscopic
equations that are supposed to be the same for all sorts of matter.
The macroscopic equations result from a process of averaging out,
and may be different in different cases. So, in our instance,
the laws of macroscopic phenomena are different for mechanical
and vital movements, though the laws of microscopic phenomena
may be the same.</p>

<p>We may say, speaking somewhat roughly, that a stimulus applied
to the nervous system, like a spark to dynamite, is able to take
advantage of the stored energy in unstable equilibrium, and thus
to produce movements out of proportion to the proximate cause.
Movements produced in this way are vital movements, while mechanical
movements are those in which the stored energy of a living body
is not involved. Similarly dynamite may be exploded, thereby displaying
its characteristic properties, or may (with due precautions) be
carted about like any other mineral. The explosion is analogous
to vital movements, the carting about to mechanical movements.</p>

<p>Mechanical movements are of no interest to the psychologist,
and it has only been necessary to define them in order to be able
to exclude them. When a psychologist studies behaviour, it is
only vital movements that concern him. We shall, therefore, proceed
to ignore mechanical movements, and study only the properties
of the remainder.</p>

<p>The next point is to distinguish between movements that are instinctive
and movements that are acquired by experience. This distinction
also is to some extent one of degree. Professor Lloyd Morgan gives
the following definition of "instinctive behaviour":</p>

<p>"That which is, on its first occurrence, independent of prior
experience; which tends to the well-being of the individual and
the preservation of the race; which is similarly performed by
all members of the same more or less restricted group of animals;
and which may be subject to subsequent modification under the
guidance of experience." *</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* "Instinct and Experience" (Methuen, 1912) p. 5.

</p>
</div>
<p>This definition is framed for the purposes of biology, and is
in some respects unsuited to the needs of psychology. Though perhaps
unavoidable, allusion to "the same more or less restricted group
of animals" makes it impossible to judge what is instinctive in
the behaviour of an isolated individual. Moreover, "the well-being
of the individual and the preservation of the race" is only a
usual characteristic, not a universal one, of the sort of movements
that, from our point of view, are to be called instinctive; instances
of harmful instincts will be given shortly. The essential point
of the definition, from our point of view, is that an instinctive
movement is in dependent of prior experience.</p>

<p>We may say that an "instinctive" movement is a vital movement
performed by an animal the first time that it finds itself in
a novel situation; or, more correctly, one which it would perform
if the situation were novel.* The instincts of an animal are different
at different periods of its growth, and this fact may cause changes
of behaviour which are not due to learning. The maturing and seasonal
fluctuation of the sex-instinct affords a good illustration. When
the sex-instinct first matures, the behaviour of an animal in
the presence of a mate is different from its previous behaviour
in similar circumstances, but is not learnt, since it is just
the same if the animal has never previously been in the presence
of a mate.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* Though this can only be decided by comparison with other<br/>
members of the species, and thus exposes us to the need of<br/>
comparison which we thought an objection to Professor Lloyd<br/>
Morgan's definition.

</p>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, a movement is "learnt," or embodies a "habit,"
if it is due to previous experience of similar situations, and
is not what it would be if the animal had had no such experience.</p>

<p>There are various complications which blur the sharpness of this
distinction in practice. To begin with, many instincts mature
gradually, and while they are immature an animal may act in a
fumbling manner which is very difficult to distinguish from learning.
James ("Psychology," ii, 407) maintains that children walk by
instinct, and that the awkwardness of their first attempts is
only due to the fact that the instinct has not yet ripened. He
hopes that "some scientific widower, left alone with his offspring
at the critical moment, may ere long test this suggestion on the
living subject." However this may be, he quotes evidence to show
that "birds do not <em>LEARN </em>to fly," but fly by instinct
when they reach the appropriate age (ib., p. 406). In the second
place, instinct often gives only a rough outline of the sort of
thing to do, in which case learning is necessary in order to acquire
certainty and precision in action. In the third place, even in
the clearest cases of acquired habit, such as speaking, some instinct
is required to set in motion the process of learning. In the case
of speaking, the chief instinct involved is commonly supposed
to be that of imitation, but this may be questioned. (See Thorndike's
"Animal Intelligence," p. 253 ff.)</p>

<p>In spite of these qualifications, the broad distinction between
instinct and habit is undeniable. To take extreme cases, every
animal at birth can take food by instinct, before it has had opportunity
to learn; on the other hand, no one can ride a bicycle by instinct,
though, after learning, the necessary movements become just as
automatic as if they were instinctive.</p>

<p>The process of learning, which consists in the acquisition of
habits, has been much studied in various animals.* For example:
you put a hungry animal, say a cat, in a cage which has a door
that can be opened by lifting a latch; outside the cage you put
food. The cat at first dashes all round the cage, making frantic
efforts to force a way out. At last, by accident, the latch is
lifted and the cat pounces on the food. Next day you repeat the
experiment, and you find that the cat gets out much more quickly
than the first time, although it still makes some random movements.
The third day it gets out still more quickly, and before long
it goes straight to the latch and lifts it at once. Or you make
a model of the Hampton Court maze, and put a rat in the middle,
assaulted by the smell of food on the outside. The rat starts
running down the passages, and is constantly stopped by blind
alleys, but at last, by persistent attempts, it gets out. You
repeat this experiment day after day; you measure the time taken
by the rat in reaching the food; you find that the time rapidly
diminishes, and that after a while the rat ceases to make any
wrong turnings. It is by essentially similar processes that we
learn speaking, writing, mathematics, or the government of an
empire.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* The scientific study of this subject may almost be said to<br/>
begin with Thorndike's "Animal Intelligence" (Macmillan,<br/>
1911).

</p>
</div>
<p>Professor Watson ("Behavior," pp. 262-3) has an ingenious theory
as to the way in which habit arises out of random movements. I
think there is a reason why his theory cannot be regarded as alone
sufficient, but it seems not unlikely that it is partly correct.
Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that there are just ten random
movements which may be made by the animal&mdash;say, ten paths down
which it may go&mdash;and that only one of these leads to food, or
whatever else represents success in the case in question. Then
the successful movement always occurs during the animal's attempts,
whereas each of the others, on the average, occurs in only half
the attempts. Thus the tendency to repeat a previous performance
(which is easily explicable without the intervention of "consciousness")
leads to a greater emphasis on the successful movement than on
any other, and in time causes it alone to be performed. The objection
to this view, if taken as the sole explanation, is that on improvement
ought to set in till after the <em>SECOND </em>trial, whereas
experiment shows that already at the second attempt the animal
does better than the first time. Something further is, therefore,
required to account for the genesis of habit from random movements;
but I see no reason to suppose that what is further required involves
"consciousness."</p>

<p>Mr. Thorndike (op. cit., p. 244) formulates two "provisional
laws of acquired behaviour or learning," as follows:</p>

<p>"The Law of Effect is that: Of several responses made to the
same situation, those which are accompanied or closely followed
by satisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal,
be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it
recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied
or closely followed by discomfort to the animal will, other things
being equal, have their connections with that situation weakened,
so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The
greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening
or weakening of the bond.</p>

<p>"The Law of Exercise is that: Any response to a situation will,
other things being equal, be more strongly connected with the
situation in proportion to the number of times it has been connected
with that situation and to the average vigour and duration of
the connections."</p>

<p>With the explanation to be presently given of the meaning of
"satisfaction" and "discomfort," there seems every reason to accept
these two laws.</p>

<p>What is true of animals, as regards instinct and habit, is equally
true of men. But the higher we rise in the evolutionary scale,
broadly speaking, the greater becomes the power of learning, and
the fewer are the occasions when pure instinct is exhibited unmodified
in adult life. This applies with great force to man, so much so
that some have thought instinct less important in the life of
man than in that of animals. This, however, would be a mistake.
Learning is only possible when instinct supplies the driving-force.
The animals in cages, which gradually learn to get out, perform
random movements at first, which are purely instinctive. But for
these random movements, they would never acquire the experience
which afterwards enables them to produce the right movement. (This
is partly questioned by Hobhouse*&mdash;wrongly, I think.) Similarly,
children learning to talk make all sorts of sounds, until one
day the right sound comes by accident. It is clear that the original
making of random sounds, without which speech would never be learnt,
is instinctive. I think we may say the same of all the habits
and aptitudes that we acquire in all of them there has been present
throughout some instinctive activity, prompting at first rather
inefficient movements, but supplying the driving force while more
and more effective methods are being acquired. A cat which is
hungry smells fish, and goes to the larder. This is a thoroughly
efficient method when there is fish in the larder, and it is often
successfully practised by children. But in later life it is found
that merely going to the larder does not cause fish to be there;
after a series of random movements it is found that this result
is to be caused by going to the City in the morning and coming
back in the evening. No one would have guessed a priori that this
movement of a middle-aged man's body would cause fish to come
out of the sea into his larder, but experience shows that it does,
and the middle-aged man therefore continues to go to the City,
just as the cat in the cage continues to lift the latch when it
has once found it. Of course, in actual fact, human learning is
rendered easier, though psychologically more complex, through
language; but at bottom language does not alter the essential
character of learning, or of the part played by instinct in promoting
learning. Language, however, is a subject upon which I do not
wish to speak until a later lecture.</p>

</div>
<p>The popular conception of instinct errs by imagining it to be
infallible and preternaturally wise, as well as incapable of modification.
This is a complete delusion. Instinct, as a rule, is very rough
and ready, able to achieve its result under ordinary circumstances,
but easily misled by anything unusual. Chicks follow their mother
by instinct, but when they are quite young they will follow with
equal readiness any moving object remotely resembling their mother,
or even a human being (James, "Psychology," ii, 396). Bergson,
quoting Fabre, has made play with the supposed extraordinary accuracy
of the solitary wasp Ammophila, which lays its eggs in a caterpillar.
On this subject I will quote from Drever's "Instinct in Man,"
p. 92:</p>

<p>"According to Fabre's observations, which Bergson accepts, the
Ammophila stings its prey <em>EXACTLY </em>and <em>UNERRINGLY
</em>in <em>EACH </em>of the nervous centres. The result is that
the caterpillar is paralyzed, but not immediately killed, the
advantage of this being that the larva cannot be injured by any
movement of the caterpillar, upon which the egg is deposited,
and is provided with fresh meat when the time comes.</p>

<p>"Now Dr. and Mrs. Peckham have shown that the sting of the wasp
is <em>NOT UNERRING, </em>as Fabre alleges, that the number of
stings is <em>NOT CONSTANT, </em>that sometimes the caterpillar
is <em>NOT PARALYZED, </em>and sometimes it is <em>KILLED OUTRIGHT,
</em>and that <em>THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT APPARENTLY
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE LARVA, </em>which is not injured by
slight movements of the caterpillar, nor by consuming food decomposed
rather than fresh caterpillar."</p>

<p>This illustrates how love of the marvellous may mislead even
so careful an observer as Fabre and so eminent a philosopher as
Bergson.</p>

<p>In the same chapter of Dr. Drever's book there are some interesting
examples of the mistakes made by instinct. I will quote one as
a sample:</p>

<p>"The larva of the Lomechusa beetle eats the young of the ants,
in whose nest it is reared. Nevertheless, the ants tend the Lomechusa
larvae with the same care they bestow on their own young. Not
only so, but they apparently discover that the methods of feeding,
which suit their own larvae, would prove fatal to the guests,
and accordingly they change their whole system of nursing" (loc.
cit., p. 106).</p>

<p>Semon ("Die Mneme," pp. 207-9) gives a good illustration of an
instinct growing wiser through experience. He relates how hunters
attract stags by imitating the sounds of other members of their
species, male or female, but find that the older a stag becomes
the more difficult it is to deceive him, and the more accurate
the imitation has to be. The literature of instinct is vast, and
illustrations might be multiplied indefinitely. The main points
as regards instinct, which need to be emphasized as against the
popular conceptions of it, are:</p>

<p>(1) That instinct requires no prevision of the biological end
which it serves;</p>

<p>(2) That instinct is only adapted to achieve this end in the
usual circumstances of the animal in question, and has no more
precision than is necessary for success AS A <em>RULE</em>;</p>

<p>(3) That processes initiated by instinct often come to be performed
better after experience;</p>

<p>(4) That instinct supplies the impulses to experimental movements
which are required for the process of learning;</p>

<p>(5) That instincts in their nascent stages are easily modifiable,
and capable of being attached to various sorts of objects.</p>

<p>All the above characteristics of instinct can be established
by purely external observation, except the fact that instinct
does not require prevision. This, though not strictly capable
of being <em>PROVED </em>by observation, is irresistibly suggested
by the most obvious phenomena. Who can believe, for example, that
a new-born baby is aware of the necessity of food for preserving
life? Or that insects, in laying eggs, are concerned for the preservation
of their species? The essence of instinct, one might say, is that
it provides a mechanism for acting without foresight in a manner
which is usually advantageous biologically. It is partly for this
reason that it is so important to understand the fundamental position
of instinct in prompting both animal and human behaviour.</p>
