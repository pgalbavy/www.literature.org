<p>One works quickly when prodded by the pique of curiosity.  And in spite
of all that omens could foretell, in spite of the dull, gloomy life
which had done its best to fashion a matter-of-fact brain for Robert
Fairchild, one sentence in that letter had found an echo, had started a
pulsating something within him that he never before had known:
</p>
<p>"--It is the blood of an adventurer."
</p><p>And it seemed that Robert Fairchild needed no more than the knowledge
to feel the tingle of it; the old house suddenly became stuffy and
prison-like as he wandered through it.  Within his pocket were two
envelopes filled with threats of the future, defying him to advance and
fight it out,--whatever <u>it</u> might be.  Again and again pounded through
his head the fact that only a night of travel intervened between
Indianapolis and St. Louis; within twelve hours he could be in the
office of Henry Beamish.  And then--
</p><p>A hurried resolution.  A hasty packing of a traveling bag and the
cashing of a check at the cigar store down on the corner.  A wakeful
night while the train clattered along upon its journey.  Then morning
and walking of streets until office hours.  At last:
</p><p>"I 'm Robert Fairchild," he said, as he faced a white-haired,
Cupid-faced man in the rather dingy offices of the Princess Building.
A slow smile spread over the pudgy features of the genial appearing
attorney, and he waved a fat hand toward the office's extra chair.
</p><p>"Sit down, Son," came casually.  "Need n't have announced yourself.  I
'd have known you--just like your father, Boy.  How is he?"  Then his
face suddenly sobered.  "I 'm afraid your presence is the answer.  Am I
right?"
</p><p>Fairchild nodded gravely.  The old attorney slowly placed his fat hands
together, peaking the fingers, and stared out of the window to the
grimy roof and signboards of the next building.
</p><p>"Perhaps it's better so," he said at last.  "We had n't seen each other
in ten years--not since I went up to Indianapolis to have my last talk
with him.  Did he get any cheerier before--he went?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Just the same, huh?  Always waiting?"
</p><p>"Afraid of every step on the veranda, of every knock at the door."
</p><p>Again the attorney stared out of the window.
</p><p>"And you?"
</p><p>"I?"  Fairchild leaned forward in his chair.  "I don't understand."
</p><p>"Are you afraid?"
</p><p>"Of what?"
</p><p>The lawyer smiled.
</p><p>"I don't know.  Only--" and he leaned forward--"it's just as though I
were living my younger days over this morning.  It doesn't seem any
time at all since your father was sitting just about where you are now,
and gad, Boy, how much you look like he looked that morning!  The same
gray-blue, earnest eyes, the same dark hair, the same strong shoulders,
and good, manly chin, the same build--and look of determination about
him.  The call of adventure was in his blood, and he sat there all
enthusiastic, telling me what he intended doing and asking my
advice--although he would n't have followed it if I had given it.  Back
home was a baby and the woman he loved, and out West was sudden wealth,
waiting for the right man to come along and find it.  Gad!"
White-haired old Beamish chuckled with the memory of it.  "He almost
made me throw over the law business that morning and go out adventuring
with him!  Then four years later," the tone changed suddenly, "he came
back."
</p><p>"What then?"  Fairchild was on the edge of his chair.  But Beamish only
spread his hands.
</p><p>"Truthfully, Boy, I don't know.  I have guessed--but I won't tell you
what.  All I know is that your father found what he was looking for and
was on the point of achieving his every dream, when something happened.
Then three men simply disappeared from the mining camp, announcing that
they had failed and were going to hunt new diggings.  That was all.
One of them was your father--"
</p><p>"But you said that he 'd found--"
</p><p>"Silver, running twenty ounces to the ton on an eight-inch vein which
gave evidences of being only the beginning of a bonanza!  I know,
because he had written me that, a month before."
</p><p>"And he abandoned it?"
</p><p>"He 'd forgotten what he had written when I saw him again.  I did n't
question him.  I did n't want to--his face told me enough to guess that
I would n't learn.  He went home then, after giving me enough money to
pay the taxes on the mine for the next twenty years, simply as his
attorney and without divulging his whereabouts.  I did it.  Eight years
or so later, I saw him in Indianapolis.  He gave me more money--enough
for eleven or twelve years--"
</p><p>"And that was ten years ago?" Robert Fairchild's eyes were reminiscent.
"I remember--I was only a kid.  He sold off everything he had, except
the house."
</p><p>Henry Beamish walked to his safe and fumbled there a moment, to return
at last with a few slips of paper.
</p><p>"Here 's the answer," he said quietly, "the taxes are paid until 1922."
</p><p>Robert Fairchild studied the receipts carefully--futilely.  They told
him nothing.  The lawyer stood looking down upon him; at last he laid a
hand on his shoulder.
</p><p>"Boy," came quietly, "I know just about what you 're thinking.  I 've
spent a few hours at the same kind of a job myself, and I 've called
old Henry Beamish more kinds of a fool than you can think of for not
coming right out flat-footed and making Thornton tell me the whole
story.  But some way, when I 'd look into those eyes with the fire all
dead and ashen within them, and see the lines of an old man in his
young face, I--well, I guess I 'm too soft-hearted to make folks
suffer.  I just couldn't do it!"
</p><p>"So you can tell me nothing?"
</p><p>"I 'm afraid that's true--in one way.  In another I 'm a fund of
information.  To-night you and I will go to Indianapolis and probate
the will--it's simple enough; I 've had it in my safe for ten years.
After that, you become the owner of the Blue Poppy mine, to do with as
you choose."
</p><p>"But--"
</p><p>The old lawyer chuckled.
</p><p>"Don't ask my advice, Boy.  I have n't any.  Your father told me what
to do if you decided to try your luck--and silver 's at $1.29.  It
means a lot of money for anybody who can produce pay ore--unless what
he said about the mine pinching out was true."
</p><p>Again the thrill of a new thing went through Robert Fairchild's veins,
something he never had felt until twelve hours before; again the urge
for strange places, new scenes, the fire of the hunt after the hidden
wealth of silver-seamed hills.  Somewhere it lay awaiting him; nor did
he even know in what form.  Robert Fairchild's life had been a plodding
thing of books and accounts, of high desks which as yet had failed to
stoop his shoulders, of stuffy offices which had been thwarted so far
in their grip at his lung power; the long walk in the morning and the
tired trudge homeward at night to save petty carfare for a silent man's
pettier luxuries had looked after that.  But the recoil had not exerted
itself against an office-cramped brain, a dusty ledger-filled life that
suddenly felt itself crying out for the free, open country, without
hardly knowing what the term meant.  Old Beamish caught the light in
the eyes, the quick contraction of the hands, and smiled.
</p><p>"You don't need to tell me, Son," he said slowly.  "I can see the
symptoms.  You 've got the fever--You 're going to work that mine.
Perhaps," and he shrugged his shoulders, "it's just as well.  But there
are certain things to remember."
</p><p>"Name them."
</p><p>"Ohadi is thirty-eight miles from Denver.  That's your goal.  Out
there, they 'll tell you how the mine caved in, and how Thornton
Fairchild, who had worked it, together with his two men, Harry Harkins,
a Cornishman, and 'Sissie' Larsen, a Swede, left town late one night
for Cripple Creek--and that they never came back.  That's the story
they 'll tell you.  Agree with it.  Tell them that Harkins, as far as
you know, went back to Cornwall, and that you have heard vaguely that
Larsen later followed the mining game farther out West."
</p><p>"Is it the truth?"
</p><p>"How do I know?  It 's good enough--people should n't ask questions.
Tell nothing more than that--and be careful of your friends.  There is
one man to watch--if he is still alive.  They call him 'Squint'
Rodaine, and he may or may not still be there.  I don't know--I 'm only
sure of the fact that your father hated him, fought him and feared him.
The mine tunnel is two miles up Kentucky Gulch and one hundred yards to
the right.  A surveyor can lead you to the very spot.  It's been
abandoned now for thirty years.  What you 'll find there is more than I
can guess.  But, Boy," and his hand clenched tight on Robert
Fairchild's shoulder, "whatever you do, whatever you run into, whatever
friends or enemies you find awaiting you, don't let that light die out
of your eyes and don't pull in that chin!  If you find a fight on your
hands, whether it's man, beast or nature, sail into it!  If you run
into things that cut your very heart out to learn--beat 'em down and
keep going!  And win!  There--that's all the advice I know.  Meet me at
the 11:10 train for Indianapolis.  Good-by."
</p><p>"Good-by--I 'll be there."  Fairchild grasped the pudgy hand and left
the office.  For a moment afterward, old Henry Beamish stood thinking
and looking out over the dingy roof adjacent.  Then, somewhat absently,
he pressed the ancient electric button for his more ancient
stenographer.
</p><p>"Call a messenger, please," he ordered when she entered, "I want to
send a cablegram."
