<p>Mother was really a great dear.  She was pretty and she was loving,
and most frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and
almost always just.  That is, she was just when she understood
things.  But of course she did not always understand things.  No
one understands everything, and mothers are not angels, though a
good many of them come pretty near it.  The children knew that
mother always WANTED to do what was best for them, even if she was
not clever enough to know exactly what was the best.  That was why
all of them, but much more particularly Anthea, felt rather
uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her of the wishing
carpet and the Phoenix.  And Anthea, whose inside mind was made so
that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others,
had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little
likely it was that her mother would believe it.</p>

<p>'Then I shall have done what's right,' said she to the Phoenix;
'and if she doesn't believe me it won't be my fault - will it?'</p>

<p>'Not in the least,' said the golden bird.  'And she won't, so
you're quite safe.'</p>

<p>Anthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons - they were
Algebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid - and she asked her
mother whether she might come and do them in the drawing-room - 'so
as to be quiet,' she said to her mother; and to herself she said,
'And that's not the real reason.  I hope I shan't grow up a LIAR.'</p>

<p>Mother said, 'Of course, dearie,' and Anthea started swimming
through a sea of x's and y's and z's.  Mother was sitting at the
mahogany bureau writing letters.</p>

<p>'Mother dear,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'Yes, love-a-duck,' said mother.</p>

<p>'About cook,' said Anthea.  '<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> know where she is.'</p>

<p>'Do you, dear?' said mother.  'Well, I wouldn't take her back after
the way she has behaved.'</p>

<p>'It's not her fault,' said Anthea.  'May I tell you about it from
the beginning?'</p>

<p>Mother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned
expression.  As you know, a resigned expression always makes you
want not to tell anybody anything.</p>

<p>'It's like this,' said Anthea, in a hurry: 'that egg, you know,
that came in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into
the Phoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet - and - '</p>

<p>'A very nice game, darling,' said mother, taking up her pen.  'Now
do be quiet.  I've got a lot of letters to write.  I'm going to
Bournemouth to-morrow with the Lamb - and there's that bazaar.'</p>

<p>Anthea went back to x y z, and mother's pen scratched busily.</p>

<p>'But, mother,' said Anthea, when mother put down the pen to lick an
envelope, 'the carpet takes us wherever we like - and - '</p>

<p>'I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern
things for my bazaar,' said mother.  'I promised them, and I've no
time to go to Liberty's now.'</p>

<p>'It shall,' said Anthea, 'but, mother - '</p>

<p>'Well, dear,' said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken
up her pen again.</p>

<p>'The carpet took us to a place where you couldn't have
whooping-cough, and the Lamb hasn't whooped since, and we took cook
because she was so tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen
of the savages.  They thought her cap was a crown, and - '</p>

<p>'Darling one,' said mother, 'you know I love to hear the things you
make up - but I am most awfully busy.'</p>

<p>'But it's true,' said Anthea, desperately.</p>

<p>'You shouldn't say that, my sweet,' said mother, gently.  And then
Anthea knew it was hopeless.</p>

<p>'Are you going away for long?' asked Anthea.</p>

<p>'I've got a cold,' said mother, 'and daddy's anxious about it, and
the Lamb's cough.'</p>

<p>'He hasn't coughed since Saturday,' the Lamb's eldest sister
interrupted.</p>

<p>'I wish I could think so,' mother replied.  'And daddy's got to go
to Scotland.  I do hope you'll be good children.'</p>

<p>'We will, we will,' said Anthea, fervently.  'When's the bazaar?'</p>

<p>'On Saturday,' said mother, 'at the schools.  Oh, don't talk any
more, there's a treasure!  My head's going round, and I've
forgotten how to spell whooping-cough.'</p>

<p>Mother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was
a new cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had
the heart to do anything to frighten her any more than seemed
natural to her.</p>

<p>The Phoenix begged to be excused.  It said it wanted a week's rest,
and asked that it might not be disturbed.  And it hid its golden
gleaming self, and nobody could find it.</p>

<p>So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and
every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to
be undertaken without the Phoenix.  They were debarred from any
carpet excursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother,
exacted in the agitation of parting, that they would not be out
after six at night, except on Saturday, when they were to go to the
bazaar, and were pledged to put on their best clothes, to wash
themselves to the uttermost, and to clean their nails - not with
scissors, which are scratchy and bad, but with flat-sharpened ends
of wooden matches, which do no harm to any one's nails.</p>

<p>'Let's go and see the Lamb,' said Jane.</p>

<p>But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in
Bournemouth it would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into
a fit.  So they sat on the carpet, and thought and thought and
thought till they almost began to squint.</p>

<p>'Look here,' said Cyril, 'I know.  Please carpet, take us somewhere
where we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.'</p>

<p>'Except the Lamb,' said Jane, quickly.</p>

<p>And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the
upside-down movement - and there they were sitting on the carpet,
and the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown
pine-needles.  There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift
clear little stream was running as fast as ever it could between
steep banks - and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was
mother, without her hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although
it was November - and there was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not
whooping at all.</p>

<p>'The carpet's deceived us,' said Robert, gloomily; 'mother will see
us directly she turns her head.'</p>

<p>But the faithful carpet had not deceived them.</p>

<p>Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE 
THEM!</p>

<p>'We're invisible,' Cyril whispered: 'what awful larks!'</p>

<p>But to the girls it was not larks at all.  It was horrible to have
mother looking straight at them, and her face keeping the same,
just as though they weren't there.</p>

<p>'I don't like it,' said Jane.  'Mother never looked at us like that
before.  Just as if she didn't love us - as if we were somebody
else's children, and not very nice ones either - as if she didn't
care whether she saw us or not.'</p>

<p>'It is horrid,' said Anthea, almost in tears.</p>

<p>But at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the
carpet, shrieking, 'Panty, own Panty - an' Pussy, an' Squiggle - an'
Bobs, oh, oh!'</p>

<p>Anthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help
it - he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all
on one side, and his precious face all dirty - quite in the old
familiar way.</p>

<p>'I love you, Panty; I love you - and you, and you, and you,' cried
the Lamb.</p>

<p>It was a delicious moment.  Even the boys thumped their baby
brother joyously on the back.</p>

<p>Then Anthea glanced at mother - and mother's face was a pale
sea-green colour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought
he had gone mad.  And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think.</p>

<p>'My Lamb, my precious!  Come to mother,' she cried, and jumped up
and ran to the baby.</p>

<p>She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or
she would have felt them; and to feel what you can't see is the
worst sort of ghost-feeling.  Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried
away from the pinewood.</p>

<p>'Let's go home,' said Jane, after a miserable silence.  'It feels
just exactly as if mother didn't love us.'</p>

<p>But they couldn't bear to go home till they had seen mother meet
another lady, and knew that she was safe.  You cannot leave your
mother to go green in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all
human aid, and then go home on your wishing carpet as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and
said 'Home' - and home they went.</p>

<p>'I don't care about being invisible myself,' said Cyril, 'at least,
not with my own family.  It would be different if you were a
prince, or a bandit, or a burglar.'</p>

<p>And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish
face of mother.</p>

<p>'I wish she hadn't gone away,' said Jane; 'the house is simply
beastly without her.'</p>

<p>'I think we ought to do what she said,' Anthea put in.  'I saw
something in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed
being sacred.'</p>

<p>'That means when they've departed farther off,' said Cyril. 
'India's coral or Greenland's icy, don't you know; not Bournemouth. 
Besides, we don't know what her wishes are.'</p>

<p>'She SAID' - Anthea was very much inclined to cry - 'she said, &quot;Get
Indian things for my bazaar;&quot; but I know she thought we couldn't,
and it was only play.'</p>

<p>'Let's get them all the same,' said Robert.  'We'll go the first
thing on Saturday morning.'</p>

<p>And on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went.</p>

<p>There was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful
wishing carpet, and said - </p>

<p>'We want Indian things for mother's bazaar.  Will you please take
us where people will give us heaps of Indian things?'</p>

<p>The docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on
the outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town.  They knew it was
Indian at once, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides,
a man went by on an elephant, and two English soldiers went along
the road, talking like in Mr Kipling's books - so after that no one
could have any doubt as to where they were.  They rolled up the
carpet and Robert carried it, and they walked bodily into the town.</p>

<p>It was very warm, and once more they had to take off their
London-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms.</p>

<p>The streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people
in the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was
strangest of all.</p>

<p>'I can't understand a word,' said Cyril.  'How on earth are we to
ask for things for our bazaar?'</p>

<p>'And they're poor people, too,' said Jane; 'I'm sure they are. 
What we want is a rajah or something.'</p>

<p>Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped
him, imploring him not to waste a wish.</p>

<p>'We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things
for bazaars,' said Anthea, 'and it will.'</p>

<p>Her faith was justified.</p>

<p>Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban
came up to them and bowed deeply.  He spoke, and they thrilled to
the sound of English words.</p>

<p>'My ranee, she think you very nice childs.  She asks do you lose
yourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet?  She see you from her
palkee.  You come see her - yes?'</p>

<p>They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more
teeth in his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked
streets to the ranee's palace.  I am not going to describe the
ranee's palace, because I really have never seen the palace of a
ranee, and Mr Kipling has.  So you can read about it in his books. 
But I know exactly what happened there.</p>

<p>The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of
other ladies with her - all in trousers and veils, and sparkling
with tinsel and gold and jewels.  And the brown, turbaned gentleman
stood behind a sort of carved screen, and interpreted what the
children said and what the queen said.  And when the queen asked to
buy the carpet, the children said 'No.'</p>

<p>'Why?' asked the ranee.</p>

<p>And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted.  The
queen spoke, and then the interpreter said - </p>

<p>'My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through
without thought of time.'</p>

<p>And they had to.  It made a long story, especially as it had all to
be told twice - once by Cyril and once by the interpreter.  Cyril
rather enjoyed himself.  He warmed to his work, and told the tale
of the Phoenix and the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the
Queen-Cook, in language that grew insensibly more and more Arabian
Nightsy, and the ranee and her ladies listened to the interpreter,
and rolled about on their fat cushions with laughter.</p>

<p>When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained
that she had said, 'Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of
tales,' and she threw him a string of turquoises from round her
neck.  </p>

<p>'OH, how lovely!' cried Jane and Anthea.</p>

<p>Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said - </p>

<p>'Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me
some of the cheap things in the bazaar.  Tell her I want them to
sell again, and give the money to buy clothes for poor people who
haven't any.'</p>

<p>'Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with
its price,' said the queen, when this was translated.</p>

<p>But Cyril said very firmly, 'No, thank you.  The things have got to
be sold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise
necklace at an English bazaar.  They'd think it was sham, or else
they'd want to know where we got it.'</p>

<p>So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her
servants piled the carpet with them.</p>

<p>'I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,' she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>But Anthea said, 'If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash
our hands and faces, she shall see a magic thing.  We and the
carpet and all these brass trays and pots and carved things and
stuffs and things will just vanish away like smoke.'</p>

<p>The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a
sandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers.  And they washed
their faces and hands in silver basins.
Then Cyril made a very polite farewell speech, and quite suddenly
he ended with the words - </p>

<p>'And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.'</p>

<p>And of course they were.  And the queen and her ladies were left
with their mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid
marble floor where the carpet and the children had been.</p>

<p>'That is magic, if ever magic was!' said the queen, delighted with
the incident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court
something to talk about on wet days ever since.</p>

<p>Cyril's stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange
sweet foods that they had had while the little pretty things were
being bought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. 
Outside, the winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town
houses.</p>

<p>'I'm glad we got washed in India,' said Cyril.  'We should have
been awfully late if we'd had to go home and scrub.'</p>

<p>'Besides,' Robert said, 'it's much warmer washing in India.  I
shouldn't mind it so much if we lived there.'</p>

<p>The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space
behind the point where the corners of two stalls met.  The floor
was littered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes
were heaped along the wall.</p>

<p>The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of
table-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle
ladies with no real work to do.  They got out at the end,
displacing a sideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of
blue geraniums.  The girls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but
Robert, as he cautiously emerged, was actually walked on by Mrs
Biddle, who kept the stall.  Her large, solid foot stood firmly on
the small, solid hand of Robert and who can blame Robert if he DID
yell a little?</p>

<p>A crowd instantly collected.  Yells are very unusual at bazaars,
and every one was intensely interested.  It was several seconds
before the three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand
that what she was walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even,
as she presently supposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living
hand of a suffering child.  When she became aware that she really
had hurt him, she grew very angry indeed.  When people have hurt
other people by accident, the one who does the hurting is always
much the angriest.  I wonder why.</p>

<p>'I'm very sorry, I'm sure,' said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in
anger than in sorrow.  'Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping
about under the stalls, like earwigs?'</p>

<p>'We were looking at the things in the corner.'</p>

<p>'Such nasty, prying ways,' said Mrs Biddle, 'will never make you
successful in life.  There's nothing there but packing and dust.'</p>

<p>'Oh, isn't there!' said Jane.  'That's all you know.'</p>

<p>'Little girl, don't be rude,' said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet.</p>

<p>'She doesn't mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all
the same,' said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to
inform the listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the
carpet were mother's contributions to the bazaar.  No one would
believe it; and if they did, and wrote to thank mother, she would
think - well, goodness only knew what she would think.  The other
three children felt the same.</p>

<p>'I should like to see them,' said a very nice lady, whose friends
had disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated
contributions to her poorly furnished stall.</p>

<p>She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, 'With pleasure, don't
mention it,' and dived back under Mrs Biddle's stall.</p>

<p>'I wonder you encourage such behaviour,' said Mrs Biddle.  'I
always speak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say,
I am surprised.'  She turned to the crowd.  'There is no
entertainment here,' she said sternly.  'A very naughty little boy
has accidentally hurt himself, but only slightly.  Will you please
disperse?  It will only encourage him in naughtiness if he finds
himself the centre of attraction.'</p>

<p>The crowd slowly dispersed.  Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a
nice curate say, 'Poor little beggar!' and loved the curate at once
and for ever.</p>

<p>Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares
brass and some inlaid sandalwood boxes.</p>

<p>'Liberty!' cried Miss Peasmarsh.  'Then Charles has not forgotten,
after all.'</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, 'these
objects are deposited behind MY stall.  Some unknown donor who does
good by stealth, and would blush if he could hear you claim the
things.  Of course they are for me.'</p>

<p>'My stall touches yours at the corner,' said poor Miss Peasmarsh,
timidly, 'and my cousin did promise - '</p>

<p>The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with
the crowd.  Their feelings were too deep for words - till at last
Robert said - </p>

<p>'That stiff-starched PIG!'</p>

<p>'And after all our trouble!  I'm hoarse with gassing to that
trousered lady in India.'</p>

<p>'The pig-lady's very, very nasty,' said Jane.</p>

<p>It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, 'She isn't very
nice, and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too.  Who's got a
pencil?'</p>

<p>it was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it.  A
large piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner.</p>

<p>She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at
every word to make it mark quite blackly: 'All these Indian things
are for pretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh's stall.'  She thought of
adding, 'There is nothing for Mrs Biddle;' but she saw that this
might lead to suspicion, so she wrote hastily: 'From an unknown
donna,' and crept back among the boards and trestles to join the
others.</p>

<p>So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the
corner of the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen
and heavy ladies could get to the corner without creeping under
stalls, the blue paper was discovered, and all the splendid,
shining Indian things were given over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she
sold them all, and got thirty-five pounds for them.</p>

<p>'I don't understand about that blue paper,' said Mrs Biddle.  'It
looks to me like the work of a lunatic.  And saying you were nice
and pretty!  It's not the work of a sane person.'</p>

<p>Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell
the things, because it was their brother who had announced the good
news that the things had come.  Miss Peasmarsh was very willing,
for now her stall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by
people who wanted to buy, and she was glad to be helped.  The
children noted that Mrs Biddle had not more to do in the way of
selling than she could manage quite well.  I hope they were not
glad - for you should forgive your enemies, even if they walk on
your hands and then say it is all your naughty fault.  But I am
afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to have been.</p>

<p>It took some time to arrange the things on the stall.  The carpet
was spread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and
silver and ivory things.  It was a happy and busy afternoon, and
when Miss Peasmarsh and the girls had sold every single one of the
little pretty things from the Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea
and Jane went off with the boys to fish in the fishpond, and dive
into the bran-pie, and hear the cardboard band, and the phonograph,
and the chorus of singing birds that was done behind a screen with
glass tubes and glasses of water.</p>

<p>They had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice
curate, and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more
than three cakes each.  It was a merry party, and the curate was
extremely pleasant to every one, 'even to Miss Peasmarsh,' as Jane
said afterwards.</p>

<p>'We ought to get back to the stall,' said Anthea, when no one could
possibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to
Miss Peas marsh about 'after Easter'.</p>

<p>'There's nothing to go back for,' said Miss Peasmarsh gaily;
'thanks to you dear children we've sold everything.'</p>

<p>'There - there's the carpet,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, 'don't bother about the
carpet.  I've sold even that.  Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for
it.  She said it would do for her servant's bedroom.'</p>

<p>'Why,' said Jane, 'her servants don't HAVE carpets.  We had cook
from her, and she told us so.'</p>

<p>'No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,' said the curate,
cheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though
she had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing.  But the
others were struck dumb.  How could they say, 'The carpet is ours!'
For who brings carpets to bazaars?</p>

<p>The children were now thoroughly wretched.  But I am glad to say
that their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as
it does sometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know
ever so much better.</p>

<p>They said, 'Thank you very much for the jolly tea,' and 'Thanks for
being so jolly,' and 'Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly
time;' for the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and
phonographs, and the chorus of singing birds, and had stood them
like a man.  The girls hugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away
they heard the curate say - </p>

<p>'Jolly little kids, yes, but what about - you will let it be
directly after Easter.  Ah, do say you will - '</p>

<p>And Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away,
'What are you going to do after Easter?'</p>

<p>Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed.  And the
curate said - </p>

<p>'I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.'</p>

<p>'I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,' said Jane.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said the curate, 'but I'm afraid I can't wait for
that.  I must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a
bishop.  I should have no time afterwards.'</p>

<p>'I've always thought I should marry a bishop,' said Jane: 'his
aprons would come in so useful.  Wouldn't YOU like to marry a
bishop, Miss Peasmarsh?'</p>

<p>It was then that they dragged her away.</p>

<p>As it was Robert's hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was
decided that he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and
so make her angry again.  Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things
at the rival stall, so they were not likely to be popular.</p>

<p>A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril
less than she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the
crowd, and it was he who said to her - </p>

<p>'Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet.  Would you sell it to
us?  We would give you - '</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' said Mrs Biddle.  'Go away, little boy.'</p>

<p>There was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the
hopelessness of persuasion.  He found the others and said - </p>

<p>'It's no use; she's like a lioness robbed of its puppies.  We must
watch where it goes - and -  Anthea, I don't care what you say.  It's
our own carpet.  It wouldn't be burglary.  It would be a sort of
forlorn hope rescue party - heroic and daring and dashing, and not
wrong at all.'</p>

<p>The children still wandered among the gay crowd - but there was no
pleasure there for them any more.  The chorus of singing birds
sounded just like glass tubes being blown through water, and the
phonograph simply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly
hear yourself speak.  And the people were buying things they
couldn't possibly want, and it all seemed very stupid.  And Mrs
Biddle had bought the wishing carpet for ten shillings.  And the
whole of life was sad and grey and dusty, and smelt of slight gas
escapes, and hot people, and cake and crumbs, and all the children
were very tired indeed.</p>

<p>They found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they
waited miserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime.  And
when it was ten the people who had bought things went away, but the
people who had been selling stayed to count up their money.</p>

<p>'And to jaw about it,' said Robert.  'I'll never go to another
bazaar as long as ever I live.  My hand is swollen as big as a
pudding.  I expect the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.'</p>

<p>Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said - </p>

<p>'Everything is over now; you had better go home.'</p>

<p>So they went.  And then they waited on the pavement under the gas
lamp, where ragged children had been standing all the evening to
listen to the band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud
till Mrs Biddle came out and was driven away in a cab with the many
things she hadn't sold, and the few things she had bought - among
others the carpet.  The other stall-holders left their things at
the school till Monday morning, but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one
would steal some of them, so she took them in a cab.</p>

<p>The children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances,
hung on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle's house.  When
she and the carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said - </p>

<p>'Don't let's burgle - I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts - till
we've given her a chance.  Let's ring and ask to see her.'</p>

<p>The others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition
that Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary
afterwards, if it really had to come to that.</p>

<p>So they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened
the front door.  While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw
her.  She was in the dining-room, and she had already pushed back
the table and spread out the carpet to see how it looked on the
floor.</p>

<p>'I knew she didn't want it for her servants' bedroom,' Jane
muttered.</p>

<p>Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the
others followed her.  Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was
smoothing down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on
the hand of Robert.  So that they were all in the room, and Cyril,
with great presence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw
them.</p>

<p>'Who is it, Jane?' she asked in a sour voice; and then turning
suddenly, she saw who it was.  Once more her face grew violet - a
deep, dark violet.  'You wicked daring little things!' she cried,
'how dare you come here?  At this time of night, too.  Be off, or
I'll send for the police.'</p>

<p>'Don't be angry,' said Anthea, soothingly, 'we only wanted to ask
you to let us have the carpet.  We have quite twelve shillings
between us, and - '</p>

<p>'How DARE you?' cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with
angriness.</p>

<p>'You do look horrid,' said Jane suddenly.</p>

<p>Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers.  'You rude,
barefaced child!' she said.</p>

<p>Anthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her.</p>

<p>'It really IS our nursery carpet,' she said, 'you ask ANY ONE if it
isn't.'</p>

<p>'Let's wish ourselves home,' said Cyril in a whisper.</p>

<p>'No go,' Robert whispered back, 'she'd be there too, and raving mad
as likely as not.  Horrid thing, I hate her!'</p>

<p>'I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,' cried Anthea,
suddenly.  'It's worth trying,' she said to herself.</p>

<p>Mrs Biddle's face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to
mauve, and from mauve to pink.  Then she smiled quite a jolly
smile.</p>

<p>'Why, so I am!' she said, 'what a funny idea!  Why shouldn't I be
in a good temper, my dears.'</p>

<p>Once more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle
alone.  The children felt suddenly good and happy.</p>

<p>'You're a jolly good sort,' said Cyril.  'I see that now.  I'm
sorry we vexed you at the bazaar to-day.'</p>

<p>'Not another word,' said the changed Mrs Biddle.  'Of course you
shall have the carpet, my dears, if you've taken such a fancy to
it.  No, no; I won't have more than the ten shillings I paid.'</p>

<p>'It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the
bazaar,' said Anthea; 'but it really IS our nursery carpet.  It got
to the bazaar by mistake, with some other things.'</p>

<p>'Did it really, now?  How vexing!' said Mrs Biddle, kindly.  'Well,
my dears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take
your carpet and we'll say no more about it.  Have a piece of cake
before you go!  I'm so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy.  Is it
all right now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, thank you,' said Robert.  'I say, you ARE good.'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Mrs Biddle, heartily.  'I'm delighted to be able
to give any little pleasure to you dear children.'</p>

<p>And she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it
away between them.</p>

<p>'You ARE a dear,' said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each
other heartily.</p>

<p>'WELL!' said Cyril as they went along the street.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Robert, 'and the odd part is that you feel just as if
it was REAL - her being so jolly, I mean - and not only the carpet
making her nice.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps it IS real,' said Anthea, 'only it was covered up with
crossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.'</p>

<p>'I hope it'll keep them away,' said Jane; 'she isn't ugly at all
when she laughs.'</p>

<p>The carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs
Biddle is, I think, the most wonderful.  For from that day she was
never anything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent
a lovely silver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when
the pretty lady married the nice curate; just after Easter it was,
and they went to Italy for their honeymoon.</p>
