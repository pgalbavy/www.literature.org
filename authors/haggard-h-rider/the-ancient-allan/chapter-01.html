<p>Now I, Allan Quatermain, come to the weirdest (with one or two
exceptions perhaps) of all the experiences which it has amused me to
employ my idle hours in recording here in a strange land, for after all
England is strange to me. I grow elderly. I have, as I suppose, passed
the period of enterprise and adventure and I should be well satisfied
with the lot that Fate has given to my unworthy self.
</p>
<p>To begin with, I am still alive and in health when by all the rules I
should have been dead many times over. I suppose I ought to be thankful
for that but, before expressing an opinion on the point, I should have
to be quite sure whether it is better to be alive or dead. The religious
plump for the latter, though I have never observed that the religious
are more eager to die than the rest of us poor mortals.
</p><p>For instance, if they are told that their holy hearts are wrong, they
spend time and much money in rushing to a place called Nauheim
in Germany, to put them right by means of water-drinking, thereby
shortening their hours of heavenly bliss and depriving their heirs of
a certain amount of cash. The same thing applies to Buxton in my own
neighbourhood and gout, especially when it threatens the stomach or the
throat. Even archbishops will do these things, to say nothing of such
small fry as deans, or stout and prominent lay figures of the Church.
</p><p>From common sinners like myself such conduct might be expected, but in
the case of those who are obviously poised on the topmost rungs of the
Jacobean--I mean, the heavenly--ladder, it is legitimate to inquire why
they show such reluctance in jumping off. As a matter of fact the only
persons that, individually, I have seen quite willing to die, except now
and again to save somebody else whom they were so foolish as to care for
more than they did for themselves, have been not those “upon whom the
light has shined” to quote an earnest paper I chanced to read this
morning, but, to quote again, “the sinful heathen wandering in their
native blackness,” by which I understand the writer to refer to their
moral state and not to their sable skins wherein for the most part they
are also condemned to wander, that is if they happen to have been born
south of a certain degree of latitude.
</p><p>To come to facts, the staff of Faith which each must shape for himself,
is often hewn from unsuitable kinds of wood, yes, even by the very best
among us. Willow, for instance, is pretty and easy to cut, but try to
support yourself with it on the edge of a precipice and see where you
are. Then of a truth you will long for ironbark, or even homely oak. I
might carry my parable further, some allusions to the proper material
of which to fashion the helmet of Salvation suggest themselves to me for
example, but I won’t.
</p><p>The truth is that we fear to die because all the religions are full of
uncomfortable hints as to what may happen to us afterwards as a reward
for our deviations from their laws and we half believe in something,
whereas often the savage, not being troubled with religion, fears less,
because he half believes in nothing. For very few inhabitants of this
earth can attain either to complete belief or to its absolute opposite.
They can seldom lay their hands upon their hearts, and say they <u>know</u>
that they will live for ever, or sleep for ever; there remains in the
case of most honest men an element of doubt in either hypothesis.
</p><p>That is what makes this story of mine so interesting, at any rate to
me, since it does seem to suggest that whether or no I have a future,
as personally I hold to be the case and not altogether without evidence,
certainly I have had a past, though, so far as I know, in this world
only; a fact, if it be a fact, from which can be deduced all kinds of
arguments according to the taste of the reasoner.
</p><p>And now for my experience, which it is only fair to add, may after all
have been no more than a long and connected dream. Yet how was I to
dream of lands, events and people where of I have only the vaguest
knowledge, or none at all, unless indeed, as some say, being a part of
this world, we have hidden away somewhere in ourselves an acquaintance
with everything that has ever happened in the world. However, it does
not much matter and it is useless to discuss that which we cannot prove.
</p><p>Here at any rate is the story.
</p>
<p>In a book or a record which I have written down and put away with others
under the title of “The Ivory Child,” I have told the tale of a certain
expedition I made in company with Lord Ragnall. Its object was to search
for his wife who was stolen away while travelling in Egypt in a state of
mental incapacity resulting from shock caused by the loss of her child
under tragic and terrible circumstances. The thieves were the priests of
a certain bastard Arab tribe who, on account of a birthmark shaped like
the young moon which was visible above her breast, believed her to be
the priestess or oracle of their worship. This worship evidently had its
origin in Ancient Egypt since, although they did not seem to know it,
the priestess was nothing less than a personification of the great
goddess Isis, and the Ivory Child, their fetish, was a statue of the
infant Horus, the fabled son of Isis and Osiris whom the Egyptians
looked upon as the overcomer of Set or the Devil, the murderer of Osiris
before his resurrection and ascent to Heaven to be the god of the dead.
</p><p>I need not set down afresh all that happened to us on this remarkable
adventure. Suffice it to say that in the end we recovered the lady and
that her mind was restored to her. Before she left the Kendah country,
however, the priesthood presented her with two ancient rolls of
papyrus, also with a quantity of a certain herb, not unlike tobacco in
appearance, which by the Kendah was called <u>Taduki</u>. Once, before we
took our great homeward journey across the desert, Lady Ragnall and I
had a curious conversation about this herb whereof the property is to
cause the person who inhales its fumes to become clairvoyant, or to
dream dreams, whichever the truth may be. It was used for this purpose
in the mystical ceremonies of the Kendah religion when under its
influence the priestess or oracle of the Ivory Child was wont to
announce divine revelations. During her tenure of this office Lady
Ragnall was frequently subjected to the spell of the <u>Taduki</u> vapour,
and said strange things, some of which I heard with my own ears. Also
myself once I experienced its effects and saw a curious vision, whereof
many of the particulars were afterwards translated into facts.
</p><p>Now the conversation which I have mentioned was shortly to the effect,
that she, Lady Ragnall, believed a time would come when she or I or both
of us, were destined to imbibe these <u>Taduki</u> fumes and see wonderful
pictures of some past or future existence in which we were both
concerned. This knowledge, she declared, had come to her while she was
officiating in an apparently mindless condition as the priestess of the
Kendah god called the Ivory Child.
</p><p>At the time I did not think it wise to pursue so exciting a subject with
a woman whose mind had been recently unbalanced, and afterwards in the
stress of new experiences, I forgot all about the matter, or at any rate
only thought of it very rarely.
</p><p>Once, however, it did recur to me with some force. Shortly after I
came to England to spend my remaining days far from the temptations of
adventure, I was beguiled into becoming a steward of a Charity dinner
and, what was worse, into attending the said dinner. Although its
objects were admirable, it proved one of the most dreadful functions
in which I was ever called upon to share. There was a vast number of
people, some of them highly distinguished, who had come to support the
Charity or to show off their Orders, I don’t know which, and others like
myself, not at all distinguished, just common subscribers, who had no
Orders and stood about the crowded room like waiters looking for a job.
</p><p>At the dinner, which was very bad, I sat at a table so remote that I
could hear but little of the interminable speeches, which was perhaps
fortunate for me. In these circumstances I drifted into conversation
with my neighbour, a queer, wizened, black-bearded man who somehow
or other had found out that I was acquainted with the wilder parts of
Africa. He proved to be a wealthy scientist whose passion it was
to study the properties of herbs, especially of such as grow in the
interior of South America where he had been travelling for some years.
</p><p>Presently he mentioned a root named Yagé, known to the Indians which,
when pounded up into a paste and taken in the form of pills, had the
effect of enabling the patient to see events that were passing at a
distance. Indeed he alleged that a vision thus produced had caused him
to return home, since in it he saw that some relative of his, I think
a twin-sister, was dangerously ill. In fact, however, he might as well
have stayed away, as he only arrived in London on the day after her
funeral.
</p><p>As I saw that he was really interested in the subject and observed that
he was a very temperate man who did not seem to be romancing, I told him
something of my experiences with <u>Taduki</u>, to which he listened with a
kind of rapt but suppressed excitement. When I affected disbelief in the
whole business, he differed from me almost rudely, asking why I rejected
phenomena simply because I was too dense to understand them. I answered
perhaps because such phenomena were inconvenient and upset one’s ideas.
To this he replied that all progress involved the upsetting of existent
ideas. Moreover he implored me, if the chance should ever come my way,
to pursue experiments with <u>Taduki</u> fumes and let him know the results.
</p><p>Here our conversation came to an end for suddenly a band that was
braying near by, struck up “God save the Queen,” and we hastily
exchanged cards and parted. I only mention it because, had it not
occurred, I think it probable that I should never have been in a
position to write this history.
</p><p>The remarks of my acquaintance remained in my mind and influenced it so
much that when the occasion came, I did as a kind of duty what, however
much I was pressed, I am almost sure I should never have done for any
other reason, just because I thought that I ought to take an opportunity
of trying to discover what was the truth of the matter. As it chanced it
was quick in coming.
</p><p>Here I should explain that I attended the dinner of which I have spoken
not very long after a very lengthy absence from England, whither I had
come to live when King Solomon’s Mines had made me rich. Therefore it
happened that between the conclusion of my Kendah adventure some years
before and this time I saw nothing and heard little of Lord and Lady
Ragnall. Once a rumour did reach me, however, I think through Sir Henry
Curtis or Captain Good, that the former had died as a result of an
accident. What the accident was my informant did not know and as I was
just starting on a far journey at the time, I had no opportunity of
making inquiries. My talk with the botanical scientist determined me
to do so; indeed a few days later I discovered from a book of reference
that Lord Ragnall was dead, leaving no heir; also that his wife survived
him.
</p><p>I was working myself up to write to her when one morning the postman
brought me here at the Grange a letter which had “Ragnall Castle”
 printed on the flap of the envelope. I did not know the writing
which was very clear and firm, for as it chanced, to the best of my
recollection, I had never seen that of Lady Ragnall. Here is a copy of
the letter it contained:
</p>
<p> “My dear Mr. Quatermain,--Very strangely I have just seen at a
  meeting of the Horticultural Society, a gentleman who declares
  that a few days ago he sat next to you at some public dinner.
  Indeed I do not think there can be any doubt for he showed me your
  card which he had in his purse with a Yorkshire address upon it.
</p><p> “A dispute had arisen as to whether a certain variety of Crinum
  lily was first found in Africa, or Southern America. This
  gentleman, an authority upon South American flora, made a speech
  saying that he had never met with it there, but that an
  acquaintance of his, Mr. Quatermain, to whom he had spoken on the
  subject, said that he had seen something of the sort in the
  interior of Africa.” (This was quite true for I remembered the
  incident.) “At the tea which followed the meeting I spoke to this
  gentleman whose name I never caught, and to my astonishment learnt
  that he must have been referring to you whom I believed to be
  dead, for so we were told a long time ago. This seemed certain,
  for in addition to the evidence of the name, he described your
  personal appearance and told me that you had come to live in
  England.
</p><p> “My dear friend, I can assure you it is long since I heard anything
  which rejoiced me so much. Oh! as I write all the past comes back,
  flowing in upon me like a pent-up flood of water, but I trust that
  of this I shall soon have an opportunity of talking to you. So let
  it be for a while.
</p><p> “Alas! my friend, since we parted on the shores of the Red Sea,
  tragedy has pursued me. As you will know, for both my husband and
  I wrote to you, although you did not answer the letters” (I never
  received them), “we reached England safely and took up our old
  life again, though to tell you the truth, after my African
  experiences things could never be quite the same to me, or for the
  matter of that to George either. To a great extent he changed his
  pursuits and certain political ambitions which he once cherished,
  seemed no longer to appeal to him. He became a student of past
  history and especially of Egyptology, which under all the
  circumstances you may think strange, as I did. However it suited
  me well enough, since I also have tastes that way. So we worked
  together and I can now read hieroglyphics as well as most people.
  One year he said that he would like to go to Egypt again, if I
  were not afraid. I answered that it had not been a very lucky
  place for us, but that personally I was not in the least afraid
  and longed to return there. For as you know, I have, or think I
  have, ties with Egypt and indeed with all Africa. Well, we went
  and had a very happy time, although I was always expecting to see
  old Harût come round the corner.
</p><p> “After this it became a custom with us who, since George
  practically gave up shooting and attending the House of Lords, had
  nothing to keep us in England, to winter in Egypt. We did this for
  five years in succession, living in a bungalow which we built at a
  place in the desert, not far from the banks of the Nile, about
  half way between Luxor which was the ancient Thebes, and Assouan.
  George took a great fancy to this spot when first he saw it, and
  so in truth did I, for, like Memphis, it attracted me so much that
  I used to laugh and say I believed that once I had something to do
  with it.
</p><p> “Now near to our villa that we called ‘Ragnall’ after this house,
  are the remains of a temple which were almost buried in the sand.
  This temple George obtained permission to excavate. It proved to
  be a long and costly business, but as he did not mind spending the
  money, that was no obstacle. For four winters we worked at it,
  employing several hundred men. As we went on we discovered that
  although not one of the largest, the temple, owing to its having
  been buried by the sand during, or shortly after the Roman epoch,
  remained much more perfect than we had expected, because the early
  Christians had never got at it with their chisels and hammers.
  Before long I hope to show you pictures and photographs of the
  various courts, etc., so I will not attempt to describe them now.
</p><p> “It is a temple to Isis--built, or rather rebuilt over the remains
  of an older temple on a site that seems to have been called Amada,
  at any rate in the later days, and so named after a city in Nubia,
  apparently by one of the Amen-hetep Pharaohs who had conquered it.
  Its style is beautiful, being of the best period of the Egyptian
  Renaissance under the last native dynasties.
</p><p> “At the beginning of the fifth winter, at length we approached the
  sanctuary, a difficult business because of the retaining walls
  that had to be built to keep the sand from flowing down as fast as
  it was removed, and the great quantities of stuff that must be
  carried off by the tramway. In so doing we came upon a shallow
  grave which appeared to have been hastily filled in and roughly
  covered over with paving stones like the rest of the court, as
  though to conceal its existence. In this grave lay the skeleton of
  a large man, together with the rusted blade of an iron sword and
  some fragments of armour. Evidently he had never been mummified,
  for there were no wrappings, canopic jars, <u>ushapti</u> figures or
  funeral offerings. The state of the bones showed us why, for the
  right forearm was cut through and the skull smashed in; also an
  iron arrow-head lay among the ribs. The man had been buried
  hurriedly after a battle in which he had met his death. Searching
  in the dust beneath the bones we found a gold ring still on one of
  the fingers. On its bezel was engraved the cartouche of ‘Peroa,
  beloved of Ra.’ Now Peroa probably means Pharaoh and perhaps he
  was Khabasha who revolted against the Persians and ruled for a
  year or two, after which he is supposed to have been defeated and
  killed, though of his end and place of burial there is no record.
  Whether these were the remnants of Khabasha himself, or of one of
  his high ministers or generals who wore the King’s cartouche upon
  his ring in token of his office, of course I cannot say.
</p><p> “When George had read the cartouche he handed me the ring which I
  slipped upon the first finger of my left hand, where I still wear
  it. Then leaving the grave open for further examination, we went
  on with the work, for we were greatly excited. At length, this was
  towards evening, we had cleared enough of the sanctuary, which was
  small, to uncover the shrine that, if not a monolith, was made of
  four pieces of granite so wonderfully put together that one could
  not see the joints. On the curved architrave as I think it is
  called, was carved the symbol of a winged disc, and beneath in
  hieroglyphics as fresh as though they had only been cut yesterday,
  an inscription to the effect that Peroa, Royal Son of the Sun,
  gave this shrine as an ‘excellent eternal work,’ together with the
  statues of the Holy Mother and the Holy Child to the ‘emanations
  of the great Goddess Isis and the god Horus,’ Amada, Royal Lady,
  being votaress or high-priestess.
</p><p> “We only read the hieroglyphics very hurriedly, being anxious to
  see what was within the shrine that, the cedar door having rotted
  away, was filled with fine, drifted sand. Basketful by basketful
  we got it out and then, my friend, there appeared the most
  beautiful life-sized statue of Isis carved in alabaster that ever
  I have seen. She was seated on a throne-like chair and wore the
  vulture cap on which traces of colour remained. Her arms were held
  forward as though to support a child, which perhaps she was
  suckling as one of the breasts was bare. But if so, the child had
  gone. The execution of the statue was exquisite and its tender and
  mystic face extraordinarily beautiful, so life-like also that I
  think it must have been copied from a living model. Oh! my friend,
  when I looked upon it, which we did by the light of the candles,
  for the sun was sinking and shadows gathered in that excavated
  hole, I felt--never mind what I felt--perhaps <u>you</u> can guess who
  know my history.
</p><p> “While we stared and stared, I longing to go upon my knees, I knew
  not why, suddenly I felt a faint trembling of the ground. At the
  same moment, the head overseer of the works, a man called Achmet,
  rushed up to us, shouting out--‘Back! Back! The wall has burst.
  The sand runs!’
</p><p> “He seized me by the arm and dragged me away beside of and behind
  the grave, George turning to follow. Next instant I saw a kind of
  wave of sand, on the crest of which appeared the stones of the
  wall, curl over and break. It struck the shrine, overturned and
  shattered it, which makes me think it was made of four pieces, and
  shattered also the alabaster statue within, for I saw its head
  strike George upon the back and throw him forward. He reeled and
  fell into the open grave which in another moment was filled and
  covered with the débris that seemed to grip me to my middle in its
  flow. After this I remembered nothing more until hours later I
  found myself lying in our house.
</p><p> “Achmet and his Egyptians had done nothing; indeed none of them
  could be persuaded to approach the place till the sun rose
  because, as they said, the old gods of the land whom they looked
  upon as devils, were angry at being disturbed and would kill them
  as they had killed the Bey, meaning George. Then, distracted as I
  was, I went myself for there was no other European there, to find
  that the whole site of the sanctuary was buried beneath hundreds
  of tons of sand, that, beginning at the gap in the broken wall,
  had flowed from every side. Indeed it would have taken weeks to
  dig it out, since to sink a shaft was impracticable and so
  dangerous that the local officials refused to allow it to be
  attempted. The end of it was that an English bishop came up from
  Cairo and consecrated the ground by special arrangement with the
  Government, which of course makes it impossible that this part of
  the temple should be further disturbed. After this he read the
  Burial Service over my dear husband.
</p><p> “So there is the end of a very terrible story which I have written
  down because I do not wish to have to talk about it more than is
  necessary when we meet. For, dear Mr. Quatermain, we shall meet,
  as I always knew that we should--yes, even after I heard that you
  were dead. You will remember that I told you so years ago in
  Kendah Land and that it would happen after a great change in my
  life, though what that change might be I could not say....”
</p>
<p>This is the end of the letter except for certain suggested dates for the
visit which she took for granted I should make to Ragnall.
