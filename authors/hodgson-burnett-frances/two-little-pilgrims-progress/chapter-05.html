<p>They did not tell each other of the strange and bold thought which had
leaped up in their minds that day. Each felt an unwonted shyness about
it, perhaps because it had been so bold; but it had been in each mind,
and hidden though it was, it remained furtively in both.
</p>
<p>They went on exactly as they had begun. Each morning Meg went to her
drudgery in the dairy and Robin followed Jones whithersoever duty led.
If the elder people had imagined they would get tired and give up they
found out their mistake. That they were often tired was true, but that
in either there arose once the thought of giving up, never! And they
worked hard. The things they did to earn their weekly stipend would have
touched the heart of a mother of cared-for children, but on Mrs.
Jennings’s model farm people knew how much work a human being could do
when necessity drove. They were all driven by necessity, and it was
nothing new to know that muscles ached and feet swelled and burned. In
fact, they knew no one who did not suffer, as a rule, from these small
inconveniences. And these children, with their set little faces and
mature intelligence, were somehow so unsuggestive of the weakness and
limitations of childhood that they were often given work which was
usually intrusted only to elder people. Mrs. Macartney found that Meg
never slighted anything, never failed in a task, and never forgot one,
so she gave her plenty to do. Scrubbing and scouring that others were
glad to shirk fell to her share. She lifted and dragged things about
that grown-up girls grumbled over. What she lacked in muscle and size
she made up in indomitable will power that made her small face set
itself and her small body become rigid as iron. Her work ended by not
confining itself to the dairy, but extended to the house, the
kitchen—anywhere there were tiresome things to be done.
</p><p>With Robin it was the same story. Jones was not afraid to give him any
order. He was of use in all quarters—in the huge fields, in the barn, in
the stables, and as a messenger to be trusted to trudge any distance
when transport was not available.
</p><p>They both grew thin but sinewy looking, and their faces had a rather
strained look. Their always large black eyes seemed to grow bigger, and
their little square jaws looked more square every day; but on Saturday
nights they each were paid their dollar, and climbed to the Straw Parlor
and unburied the Treasure and added to it.
</p><p>Those Saturday nights were wonderful things. To the end of life they
would never forget them. Through all the tired hours of labor they were
looked forward to. Then they lay in their nest of straw and talked
things over—there it seemed that they could relax and rest their limbs
as they could do it nowhere else. Mrs. Jennings was not given to sofas
and easy-chairs, and it is not safe to change position often when one
has a grown-up bedfellow. But in the straw they could roll at full
length, curl up or stretch out just as they pleased, and there they
could enlarge upon the one subject that filled their minds, and
fascinated and enraptured them.
</p><p>Who could wonder that it was so! The City Beautiful was growing day by
day, and the development of its glories was the one thing they heard
talked of. Robin had established the habit of collecting every scrap of
newspaper referring to it. He cut them out of Aunt Matilda’s old papers,
he begged them from every one, neighbors, store-keepers, work hands.
When he was sent on errands he cast an all-embracing glance ’round every
place his orders took him to. The postmaster of the nearest village
discovered his weakness and saved paragraphs and whole papers for him.
Before very long there was buried near the Treasure a treasure even more
valuable of newspaper cuttings, and on the wonderful Saturday nights
they gave themselves up to revelling in them.
</p><p>How they watched it and followed it and lived with it—this great human
scheme which somehow seemed to their young minds more like the scheme of
giants and genii! How they seized upon every new story of its wonders
and felt that there could be no limit to them! They knew every purpose
and plan connected with it—every arch and tower and hall and stone they
pleased themselves by fancying. Newspapers were liberal with
information, people talked of it, they heard of it on every side. To
them it seemed that the whole world must be thinking of nothing else.
</p><p>“While we are lying here,” Meg said—“while you are doing chores, and I
am scouring pans and scrubbing things, it is all going on. People in
France and in England and in Italy are doing work to send to it—artists
are painting pictures, and machinery is whirling and making things, and
everything is pouring into that one wonderful place. And men and women
planned it, you know—just men and women. And if we live a few years we
shall be men and women, and they were once children like us—only, if
they had been quite like us they would never have known enough to do
anything.”
</p><p>“But when they were children like us,” said Robin, “they did not know
what they would have learned by this time—and they never dreamed about
this.”
</p><p>“That shows how wonderful men and women are,” said Meg. “I believe they
can do <u>anything</u> if they set their minds to it.” And she said it
stubbornly.
</p><p>“Perhaps they can,” said Robin, slowly. “Perhaps <u>we</u> could do anything
we set our minds to.”
</p><p>There was the suggestive tone in his voice which Meg had been thrilled
by more than once before. She had been thrilled by it most strongly when
he had said that if they saved their two dollars a week they might be
able to go almost anywhere. Unconsciously she responded to it now.
</p><p>“If I could do anything I set my mind to,” she said, “do you know what I
would set my mind to first?”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“I would set my mind to going to that wonderful place. I would set it to
seeing everything there, and remembering all I could hold, and learning
all there was to be learned—and I would <u>set it hard</u>.”
</p><p>“So would I,” said Robin.
</p><p>It was a more suggestive voice than before that he said the words in;
and suddenly he got up, and went and tore away the straw from the
burying-place of the Treasure. He took out the old iron bank, and
brought it back to their corner.
</p><p>He did it so suddenly, and with such a determined air, that Meg rather
lost her breath.
</p><p>“What are you going to do with the Treasure?” she asked.
</p><p>“I am going to count it.”
</p><p>“Why?”
</p><p>He was opening the box, using the blade of a stout pocket-knife as a
screwdriver.
</p><p>“A return ticket to Chicago costs fourteen dollars,” he said. “I asked
at the dépôt. That would be twenty-eight dollars for two people. Any one
who is careful can live on a very little for a while. I want to see if
we shall have money enough to <u>go</u>.”
</p><p>“To <u>go</u>!” Meg cried out. “To the Fair, Robin?”
</p><p>She could not believe the evidence of her ears—it sounded so daring.
</p><p>“Nobody would take us!” she said. “Even if we had money enough to pay
for ourselves, nobody would take us.”
</p><p>“Take!” answered Robin, working at his screws. “No, nobody would. What’s
the matter with taking ourselves?”
</p><p>Meg sat up in the straw, conscious of a sort of shock.
</p><p>“To go by ourselves, like grown-up people! To buy our tickets ourselves,
and get on the train, and go all the way—alone! And walk about the Fair
alone, Robin?”
</p><p>“Who takes care of us here?” answered Robin. “Who has looked after us
ever since father and mother died? Ourselves! Just ourselves! Whose
business are we but our own? Who thinks of us, or asks if we are happy
or unhappy?”
</p><p>“Nobody,” said Meg. And she hid her face in her arms on her knees.
</p><p>Robin went on stubbornly.
</p><p>“Nobody is ever going to do it,” he said, “if we live to be hundreds of
years old. I’ve thought of it when I’ve been working in the fields with
Jones, and I’ve thought of it when I’ve been lying awake at night. It’s
kept me awake many and many a time.”
</p><p>“So it has me,” said Meg.
</p><p>“And since this thing began to be talked about everywhere, I’ve thought
of it more and more,” said Rob. “It means more to people like us than it
does to any one else. It’s the people who never see things, who have no
chances, it means the most to. And the more I think of it, the more I—I
won’t let it go by me!” And all at once he threw himself face downward
on the straw, and hid his face in his arms.
</p><p>Meg lifted hers. There was something in the woful desperation of his
movement that struck her to the heart. She had never known him do such a
thing in their lives before. That was not his way. Whatsoever hard thing
had happened—howsoever lonely and desolate they had felt—he had never
shown his feeling in this way. She put out her hand and touched his
shoulder.
</p><p>“Robin!” she said. “Oh, Robin!”
</p><p>“I don’t care,” he said, from the refuge of his sleeves. “We <u>are</u>
little when we are compared with grown-up people. They would call us
children; and children usually have some one to help them and tell them
what to do. I’m only like this because I’ve been thinking so much and
working so hard—and it does seem like an Enchanted City—but no one ever
thinks we could care about anything more than if we were cats and dogs.
It was not like that at home, even if we were poor.”
</p><p>Then he sat up with as little warning as he had thrown himself down, and
gave his eyes a fierce rub. He returned to the Treasure again.
</p><p>“I’ve been making up my mind to it for days,” he said. “If we have the
money we can buy our tickets and go some night without saying anything
to any one. We can leave a note for Aunt Matilda, and tell her we are
all right and we are coming back. She’ll be too busy to mind.”
</p><p>“Do you remember that book of father’s we read?” said Meg. “That one
called ‘David Copperfield.’ David ran away from the bottle place when he
was younger than we are, and he had to walk all the way to Dover.”
</p><p>“We shall not have to walk; and we won’t let any one take our money away
from us,” said Robin.
</p><p>“Are we going, really?” said Meg. “You speak as if we were truly going;
and it <u>can’t</u> be.”
</p><p>“Do you know what you said just now about believing human beings could
do <u>anything</u>, if they set their minds to it? Let’s set our minds to
it.”
</p><p>“Well,” Meg answered, rather slowly, as if weighing the matter, “let’s!”
</p><p>And she fell to helping to count the Treasure.
