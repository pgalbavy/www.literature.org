<p>Occasional American Defeats as Well as Victories &mdash;Captain
Decatur's Misfortune &mdash;The <em>Chesapeake</em> and <em>Shannon</em>.</p>

<p>You would gain a wrong impression if my account of the leading
naval events in the War of 1812 were made up wholly of American
victories. It was inevitable that our gallant officers and men
should meet with some defeats. In order, therefore, to give as
true an idea as possible of those times I shall devote this chapter
to telling about some events which went the wrong way.</p>

<p>Enough has been related concerning Stephen Decatur to show that
he was the most prominent of our naval leaders in our last war
with Great Britain. He entered into the work with the same dauntless
enthusiasm he showed whenever it was his privilege to serve his
country, and his capture of the <em>Macedonian</em> was one of
the most brilliant exploits of the many that took place during
those memorable years.</p>

<p>In order to understand my use of the words "captain" and "commodore,"
it is necessary to explain that at the time to which I now refer
the latter rank was different from what it is to-day. The commodore
of a squadron was the highest ranking officer and he might be
lower than a captain. Thus "Commodore" Perry, who won the remarkable
victory on Lake Erie, was promoted from that rank to "captain."</p>

<p>Another interesting fact may be named. The Stars and Stripes
used in that war was slightly different in pattern from the present,
for, instead of containing thirteen stripes, as it did at the
close of the Revolution and as it does to-day, it had fifteen.
The first law of Congress bearing on this point was to add a stripe
for every new State admitted to the Union, but after two had come
in and others were making ready it became evident that before
long the pattern of the beautiful emblem would be spoiled if the
rule were followed. So the increase in the number of stripes stopped
and remained fifteen for a few years after the close of the war,
even though new States had been admitted. Then the law was changed
so as to provide that the increase of States should be shown by
the stars in the blue field, while the stripes should always remain
thirteen in number, typical of the original colonies of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It was decided early in the war to send a squadron consisting
of the <em>President</em>, Captain Stephen Decatur, and the sloops
of war <em>Peacock</em>, Captain Warrington, and <em>Hornet</em>,
Lieutenant Biddle, and the storeship <em>Tom Bowline</em> on a
cruise in the Indian Ocean. This squadron was to rendezvous at
Tristan d'Acunha, but failed to do so, for a reason that has been
stated in the account of the exploits of the <em>Hornet</em> and
<em>Peacock</em>.</p>

<p>Captain Decatur lay in the harbor of New York with his vessels
and found himself so closely blockaded by the British squadron
that it was impossible for the Americans to sail in company. He
sent out the two ships named, and, on the night of January 14,
1815, when the blockading squadron had been driven to the south
by a gale, he sailed down the Narrows, hoping to get to sea before
it returned. There was good reason to expect success, but misfortune
speedily came. The beacon lights had been removed and early in
the evening the pilot ran the ship aground just before reaching
Sandy Hook. It required two hours of the hardest kind of work
to get her off. The <em>President</em> was not very seaworthy
at the start, and the efforts to reach deep water so injured her
that it was necessary to return to the city for repairs, but the
strong contrary wind prevented and she was driven over the bar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the blockading squadron had come back and, early the
next morning, Decatur had four of them in full pursuit. He put
on every stitch of canvas, threw overboard everything that could
be spared and wet his sails, but the <em>President</em> was so
badly crippled from having run aground that, despite all that
was done, she steadily lost ground. The <em>Endymion</em> led
the pursuers and soon drew up within range, her position such
that Decatur could not reply to the shots which began to injure
his ship and kill and wound his crew.</p>

<p>He formed a desperate scheme that was characteristic of him.
The <em>Endymion</em> was so far in advance of the other pursuers
that there was a possibility of turning about and capturing her.
Then, by transferring the American crew to her, the worthless
<em>President</em> could be abandoned and swift flight be made
in the <em>Endymion</em>, which had already demonstrated her superior
speed.</p>

<p>The great risk in this attempt (for no one among the Americans
doubted their ability to overcome the other crew) was that before
the capture could be accomplished the other vessels would come
up and Decatur be assailed by an overwhelming force, but he did
not hesitate. He explained his plan to his men and they responded
with cheers. No commander was ever more beloved by his crew than
Decatur, and they were ready to follow him to the death, for he
was always their leader and the foremost in personal danger.</p>

<p>Since every minute was valuable, Decatur put about and made for
the <em>Endymion</em> with the intention of engaging her at close
quarters. But the British vessel suspected his purpose, for she
also turned, and, being much the superior sailer, was able to
hold a safe distance between the two. It was an exasperating disappointment,
but Decatur opened with a heavy fire, hoping to disable his antagonist
before the arrival of the others.</p>

<p>A furious engagement followed, in which Decatur lost several
of his most valuable officers and was himself painfully wounded
by flying splinters. But the American guns were served with perfect
precision and the <em>Endymion</em> was so broken and shattered
by the fire that after two and a half hours she was incapable
of further resistance. She would have surrendered had the time
been sufficient for Decatur to enforce the demand, but the other
blockaders were hurrying up and placed the American again in grave
danger. He crowded on all sail once more, but the scurrying clouds
which gave him a chance of escaping were swept from the sky and
the bright moon revealed him so plainly to his pursuers that they
rapidly overtook the <em>President</em>. A running fight followed,
but the <em>President</em> was overmatched in every respect. In
his official report Decatur said: "Two fresh ships of the enemy,
the 38-gun frigates <em>Pomone</em> and <em>Tenedos</em>, had
come up. The <em>Pomone</em> had opened fire on the port bow,
within musket shot, the other, about two cables' length astern,
taking a raking position on our quarter, and the rest, with the
exception of the <em>Endymion</em>, within gunshot. Thus situated,
with about one-fifth of my crew killed and wounded, my ship crippled
and a more than fourfold force opposed to me, without a chance
of escape, I deemed it my duty to surrender."</p>

<p>The British senior officer of the squadron to whom Decatur offered
his sword showed his appreciation of the American's gallantry
and of his chivalrous treatment of Captain Carden, when the situations
were reversed, by handing the weapon back to Decatur with the
remark that he was proud to return the sword of an officer who
had defended his ship so nobly.</p>

<p>Shortly after this misfortune news reached this country of the
signing of a treaty of peace, though several encounters took place
on the ocean before the tidings could reach the various ships.</p>

<p>Turning back to the earlier part of the war, mention must be
made of another American hero, James Lawrence, who was born in
Burlington, <em>N.J., </em>in 1781 and was active in the war with
Tripoli. He was commander of the <em>Hornet</em> when she captured
the <em>Peacock</em> in an engagement which lasted only fifteen
minutes, with the loss of one American killed and two wounded.
He was given the command of the frigate <em>Chesapeake</em>, which
was repairing in Boston harbor. The ship had gained the reputation
of being unlucky, and, having already passed through several accidents,
Lawrence assumed command with extreme reluctance.</p>

<p>Among the blockading vessels of the enemy outside of Boston was
the <em>Shannon</em>, commanded by Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke.
She was one of the most efficient ships in the British navy, carried
38 guns and had a crew of 330 men, all well disciplined and skilled
in firing guns and in fighting, while Broke himself probably had
no superior as an officer. That he was brave was proven not only
by his sending a challenge to Lawrence, inviting him to come out
and fight him, but by his conduct during the battle.</p>

<p>Captain Lawrence sailed out of Boston harbor before Broke's challenge
reached him. He had learned that a single frigate had presumed
to blockade the port, and, having been ordered to sail as soon
as possible, he made unwise haste in venturing to give the <em>Shannon</em>
battle, even though one cause was the wish to leave the port before
other blockaders appeared.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE</em>.]</p>

<p>The crew of the <em>Chesapeake</em> was inferior in every respect
to that of the enemy, except that it contained ten more men. The
majority had been newly enlisted and contained many foreigners,
landsmen, and objectionable sailors. They were not only unaccustomed
to the ship&mdash;though they knew of its reputation as an unlucky
one&mdash;but were unacquainted with one another and nearly all were
strangers to the officers. The best of these were absent from
illness and other causes. Worse than all, many were in a maudlin
state of drunkenness when the <em>Chesapeake</em> started out
with flags flying to engage the well-manned <em>Shannon</em>.</p>

<p>On the way down the bay some of the <em>Chesapeake's</em> crew
impudently notified Lawrence that they would not fight unless
they received the prize money earned a short time before. It was
a humiliating situation for the young commander, but he was virtually
in the face of the enemy and he issued prize checks to the malcontents.
Well aware of the character of the foe he was about to encounter,
he must have looked upon the meeting with foreboding. Maclay uses
these impressive words:</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE "CHESAPEAKE" AND THE
"SHANNON</em>."]</p>

<p>"The calm deliberation with which the American and English commanders
went out to seek each other's life and the earnestness with which
they urged their officers and men to steep their hands in the
blood of their fellow beings form one of the sombre pictures of
naval history. Lawrence was the youngest son of John Lawrence,
Esquire, counselor-at-law at Burlington, <em>N.J., </em>and was
the second in command at the celebrated capture of the <em>Philadelphia</em>
in the harbor of Tripoli. Broke was the descendant of an ancient
family which had lived in Broke Hall, England, over three hundred
and fifty years and for four hundred years at Leighton. Both were
men in the prime of manhood, Lawrence in his thirty-second year
and Broke in his thirty-seventh. Both were models of chivalry
and manly grace; both were held in the highest estimation in their
profession. Lawrence had just taken an affectionate farewell of
his two sons and an hour later was urging his men to "<em>Peacock</em>
them! <em>Peacock</em> them!" Broke a short time before had committed
his wife to God's mercy and soon afterward was urging his crew
to 'Kill the men! kill the men!' Both were men of the kindliest
feelings and most tender affections; both acknowledged the justice
of the cause for which the Americans were contending, yet with
steady determination they went out at the head of their ships'
companies to take each other's life. A few hours afterward, when
Captain Broke fell on the <em>Chesapeake's</em> decks fainting
and covered with his own blood, his lieutenants, on loosening
his clothes, found a small blue silk case suspended around his
neck. It contained a lock of his wife's hair."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>DEATH OF CAPTAIN LAWRENCE</em>.]</p>

<p>Lawrence, in accordance with his chivalrous nature, disdained
to seek any unfair advantage, his purpose being to engage in what
is called a fair yardarm and yardarm fight. It was toward the
close of the first day of summer, with thousands crowding the
hills and points of advantage and peering at the ships through
glasses, that the battle opened by the fire of the <em>Shannon</em>.
Great damage was inflicted and much execution done by the return
broadside of the <em>Chesapeake</em>. The first fire severely
wounded Lawrence in the leg, but he refused to go below. Then
the firing became so close and rapid that half the American officers
were killed or wounded. The most frightful confusion that can
be imagined followed. When Lawrence formed his men to board after
the two vessels had fouled the bugler could not be found, whereupon
Captain Broke led his own men upon the deck of the <em>Chesapeake</em>.</p>

<p>It was at this critical moment that Lawrence was fatally wounded
and carried below. He kept calling out his commands while in the
cockpit to fight harder and to keep the guns going. His last words,
often repeated in his delirium, were "<em>Don't give up the ship!</em>"
and they formed the motto of the American navy for many years
afterward.</p>

THEIR SWORDS</em>.]</p>

<p>In the wild, savage fighting, where everything was so mixed that
an American lieutenant joined the British boarders under the impression
that they were his own men, Captain Broke was fearfully wounded,
though he afterward recovered. The <em>Chesapeake</em>, with a
loss of 47 killed and 99 wounded to 24 killed and 59 wounded of
the enemy, became the prize of the <em>Shannon</em>.</p>
