<p>Night found Grunty Pig huddled close to the outside of the piggery. Many
times he had walked around the low building, snuffing at the doors and
trying in vain to find some opening through which he might crawl. To his
dismay, all was snug and tight. There wasn't a hole big enough even for
Miss Kitty Cat to creep through.
</p>
<p>Though Grunty had called a good many times, nobody had answered him.
Inside the piggery, in their pen, Mrs. Pig and her other children were
sound asleep. Now and then Grunty could hear a throaty snore, which he
knew to be his mother's.
</p><p>"How can she sleep, when I'm missing?" he cried.
</p><p>Now, Mrs. Pig had been much upset by Grunty's absence. And when Farmer
Green came to put her family into the piggery for the night she had
tried to explain to him that Grunty had run away. Unfortunately, it
happened that Farmer Green was in a great hurry. He didn't stop to find
out what was troubling Mrs. Pig, but hustled her and her children inside
and closed all the doors.
</p><p>Try as she would, Mrs. Pig hadn't been able to stay awake. Her eyes
would close, in spite of all she could do. Though she slept, she dreamed
about the truant Grunty. Now and then she cried aloud in the darkness,
when some terrible creature seemed to be chasing him. But Mrs. Pig never
quite waked up.
</p><p>Once Grunty Pig thought he heard his mother speak his name. And he
called out in as brave a voice as he could muster, "Here I am, just
outside the piggery! Won't somebody please let me in?"
</p><p>He called in vain. At last he fell asleep, for he was about as tired as
any little pig could be.
</p><p>In the middle of the night Grunty Pig awoke with a start. Somebody said
"Woof!" And somebody came sniffing and snuffing around the corner of the
piggery. Dimly Grunty could see a dark, burly form. And he was so
frightened that he bawled right out, "It's a bear! It's a bear! It's a
bear!"
</p><p>Almost at the same instant old dog Spot ran out of his kennel, barking
furiously. And like magic the prowler--whoever he was--vanished into the
night.
</p><p>"Keep still!" Grunty's mother called to him; for the noise had half
roused her. "Don't you mention the word <u>bear</u> again, or I'll attend to
you in the morning."
</p><p>Drowsy as she was, Mrs. Pig actually thought Grunty was right there in
the pen with the rest of her children. And in no time at all she was
snoring again.
</p><p>Grunty Pig didn't dare open his mouth nor close his eyes the rest of the
night. And when morning came, Farmer Green found him huddled against the
door of the piggery.
</p><p>It was a joyful meeting--for Grunty Pig.
