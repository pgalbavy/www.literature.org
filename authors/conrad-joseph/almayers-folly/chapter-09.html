<p>"Can I believe what you tell me?  It is like a tale for men that
listen only half awake by the camp fire, and it seems to have
run off a woman's tongue."</p>

<p>"Who is there here for me to deceive, O Rajah?" answered Babalatchi.
"Without you I am nothing.  All I have told you I believe to be
true.  I have been safe for many years in the hollow of your hand. 
This is no time to harbour suspicions.  The danger is very great. 
We should advise and act at once, before the sun sets."</p>

<p>"Right.  Right," muttered Lakamba, pensively.</p>

<p>They had been sitting for the last hour together in the audience
chamber of the Rajah's house, for Babalatchi, as soon as he had
witnessed the landing of the Dutch officers, had crossed the river
to report to his master the events of the morning, and to confer
with him upon the line of conduct to pursue in the face of altered
circumstances.  They were both puzzled and frightened by the unexpected
turn the events had taken.  The Rajah, sitting crosslegged on
his chair, looked fixedly at the floor; Babalatchi was squatting
close by in an attitude of deep dejection.</p>

<p>"And where did you say he is hiding now?" asked Lakamba, breaking
at last the silence full of gloomy forebodings in which they both
had been lost for a long while.</p>

<p>"In Bulangi's clearing&mdash;the furthest one, away from the house. 
They went there that very night.  The white man's daughter took
him there.  She told me so herself, speaking to me openly, for
she is half white and has no decency.  She said she was waiting
for him while he was here; then, after a long time, he came out
of the darkness and fell at her feet exhausted.  He lay like one
dead, but she brought him back to life in her arms, and made him
breathe again with her own breath.  That is what she said, speaking
to my face, as I am speaking now to you, Rajah.  She is like a
white woman and knows no shame."</p>

<p>He paused, deeply shocked.  Lakamba nodded his head.  "Well,
and then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They called the old woman," went on Babalatchi, "and he told
them all&mdash;about the brig, and how he tried to kill many men. 
He knew the Orang Blanda were very near, although he had said
nothing to us about that; he knew his great danger.  He thought
he had killed many, but there were only two dead, as I have heard
from the men of the sea that came in the warship's boats."</p>

<p>"And the other man, he that was found in the river?" interrupted
Lakamba.</p>

<p>"That was one of his boatmen.  When his canoe was overturned
by the logs those two swam together, but the other man must have
been hurt.  Dain swam, holding him up.  He left him in the bushes
when he went up to the house.  When they all came down his heart
had ceased to beat; then the old woman spoke; Dain thought it
was good.  He took off his anklet and broke it, twisting it round
the man's foot.  His ring he put on that slave's hand.  He took
off his sarong and clothed that thing that wanted no clothes,
the two women holding it up meanwhile, their intent being to deceive
all eyes and to mislead the minds in the settlement, so that they
could swear to the thing that was not, and that there could be
no treachery when the white-men came.  Then Dain and the white
woman departed to call up Bulangi and find a hiding-place.  The
old woman remained by the body."</p>

<p>"Hai!" exclaimed Lakamba.  "She has wisdom."</p>

<p>"Yes, she has a Devil of her own to whisper counsel in her ear,"
assented Babalatchi.  "She dragged the body with great toil to
the point where many logs were stranded.  All these things were
done in the darkness after the storm had passed away.  Then she
waited.  At the first sign of daylight she battered the face of
the dead with a heavy stone, and she pushed him amongst the logs. 
She remained near, watching.  At sunrise Mahmat Banjer came and
found him.  They all believed; I myself was deceived, but not
for long.  The white man believed, and, grieving, fled to his
house.  When we were alone I, having doubts, spoke to the woman,
and she, fearing my anger and your might, told me all, asking
for help in saving Dain."</p>

<p>"He must not fall into the hands of the Orang Blanda," said Lakamba;
"but let him die, if the thing can be done quietly."</p>

<p>"It cannot, Tuan!  Remember there is that woman who, being half
white, is ungovernable, and would raise a great outcry.  Also
the officers are here.  They are angry enough already.  Dain must
escape; he must go.  We must help him now for our own safety."</p>

<p>"Are the officers very angry?" inquired Lakamba, with interest.</p>

<p>"They are.  The principal chief used strong words when speaking
to me&mdash;to me when I salaamed in your name.  I do not think," added
Babalatchi, after a short pause and looking very worried&mdash;"I do
not think I saw a white chief so angry before.  He said we were
careless or even worse.  He told me he would speak to the Rajah,
and that I was of no account."</p>

<p>"Speak to the Rajah!" repeated Lakamba, thoughtfully.  "Listen,
Babalatchi: I am sick, and shall withdraw; you cross over and
tell the white men."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Babalatchi, "I am going over at once; and as to Dain?"</p>

<p>"You get him away as you can best.  This is a great trouble in
my heart," sighed Lakamba.</p>

<p>Babalatchi got up, and, going close to his master, spoke earnestly.</p>

<p>"There is one of our praus at the southern mouth of the river. 
The Dutch warship is to the northward watching the main entrance. 
I shall send Dain off to-night in a canoe, by the hidden channels,
on board the prau. His father is a great prince, and shall hear
of our generosity.  Let the prau take him to Ampanam.  Your glory
shall be great, and your reward in powerful friendship.  Almayer
will no doubt deliver the dead body as Dain's to the officers,
and the foolish white men shall say, 'This is very good; let there
be peace.'  And the trouble shall be removed from your heart,
Rajah."</p>

<p>"True! true!" said Lakamba.</p>

<p>"And, this being accomplished by me who am your slave, you shall
reward with a generous hand.  That I know!  The white man is grieving
for the lost treasure, in the manner of white men who thirst after
dollars.  Now, when all other things are in order, we shall perhaps
obtain the treasure from the white man.  Dain must escape, and
Almayer must live."</p>

<p>"Now go, Babalatchi, go!" said Lakamba, getting off his chair. 
"I am very sick, and want medicine.  Tell the white chief so."</p>

<p>But Babalatchi was not to be got rid of in this summary manner. 
He knew that his master, after the manner of the great, liked
to shift the burden of toil and danger on to his servants' shoulders,
but in the difficult straits in which they were now the Rajah
must play his part.  He may be very sick for the white men, for
all the world if he liked, as long as he would take upon himself
the execution of part at least of Babalatchi's carefully thought-of
plan.  Babalatchi wanted a big canoe manned by twelve men to be
sent out after dark towards Bulangi's clearing.  Dain may have
to be overpowered.  A man in love cannot be expected to see clearly
the path of safety if it leads him away from the object of his
affections, argued Babalatchi, and in that case they would have
to use force in order to make him go.  Would the Rajah see that
trusty men manned the canoe?  The thing must be done secretly. 
Perhaps the Rajah would come himself, so as to bring all the weight
of his authority to bear upon Dain if he should prove obstinate
and refuse to leave his hiding-place.  The Rajah would not commit
himself to a definite promise, and anxiously pressed Babalatchi
to go, being afraid of the white men paying him an unexpected
visit.  The aged statesman reluctantly took his leave and went
into the courtyard.</p>

<p>Before going down to his boat Babalatchi stopped for a while
in the big open space where the thick-leaved trees put black patches
of shadow which seemed to float on a flood of smooth, intense
light that rolled up to the houses and down to the stockade and
over the river, where it broke and sparkled in thousands of glittering
wavelets, like a band woven of azure and gold edged with the brilliant
green of the forests guarding both banks of the Pantai.  In the
perfect calm before the coming of the afternoon breeze the irregularly
jagged line of tree-tops stood unchanging, as if traced by an
unsteady hand on the clear blue of the hot sky.  In the space
sheltered by the high palisades there lingered the smell of decaying
blossoms from the surrounding forest, a taint of drying fish;
with now and then a whiff of acrid smoke from the cooking fires
when it eddied down from under the leafy boughs and clung lazily
about the burnt-up grass.</p>

<p>As Babalatchi looked up at the flagstaff over-topping a group
of low trees in the middle of the courtyard, the tricolour flag
of the Netherlands stirred slightly for the first time since it
had been hoisted that morning on the arrival of the man-of-war
boats.  With a faint rustle of trees the breeze came down in light
puffs, playing capriciously for a time with this emblem of Lakamba's
power, that was also the mark of his servitude; then the breeze
freshened in a sharp gust of wind, and the flag flew out straight
and steady above the trees.  A dark shadow ran along the river,
rolling over and covering up the sparkle of declining sunlight. 
A big white cloud sailed slowly across the darkening sky, and
hung to the westward as if waiting for the sun to join it there. 
Men and things shook off the torpor of the hot afternoon and stirred
into life under the first breath of the sea breeze.</p>

<p>Babalatchi hurried down to the water-gate; yet before he passed
through it he paused to look round the courtyard, with its light
and shade, with its cheery fires, with the groups of Lakamba's
soldiers and retainers scattered about.  His own house stood amongst
the other buildings in that enclosure, and the statesman of Sambir
asked himself with a sinking heart when and how would it be given
him to return to that house.  He had to deal with a man more dangerous
than any wild beast of his experience: a proud man, a man wilful
after the manner of princes, a man in love.  And he was going
forth to speak to that man words of cold and worldly wisdom. Could
anything be more appalling?  What if that man should take umbrage
at some fancied slight to his honour or disregard of his affections
and suddenly "amok"?  The wise adviser would be the first victim,
no doubt, and death would be his reward.  And underlying the horror
of this situation there was the danger of those meddlesome fools,
the white men. A vision of comfortless exile in far-off Madura
rose up before Babalatchi.  Wouldn't that be worse than death
itself?  And there was that half-white woman with threatening
eyes.  How could he tell what an incomprehensible creature of
that sort would or would not do?  She knew so much that she made
the killing of Dain an impossibility.  That much was certain. 
And yet the sharp, rough-edged kriss is a good and discreet friend,
thought Babalatchi, as he examined his own lovingly, and put it
back in the sheath, with a sigh of regret, before unfastening
his canoe. As he cast off the painter, pushed out into the stream,
and took up his paddle, he realised vividly how unsatisfactory
it was to have women mixed up in state affairs.  Young women,
of course.  For Mrs. Almayer's mature wisdom, and for the easy
aptitude in intrigue that comes with years to the feminine mind,
he felt the most sincere respect.</p>

<p>He paddled leisurely, letting the canoe drift down as he crossed
towards the point.  The sun was high yet, and nothing pressed. 
His work would commence only with the coming of darkness.  Avoiding
the Lingard jetty, he rounded the point, and paddled up the creek
at the back of Almayer's house.  There were many canoes lying
there, their noses all drawn together, fastened all to the same
stake.  Babalatchi pushed his little craft in amongst them and
stepped on shore.  On the other side of the ditch something moved
in the grass.</p>

<p>"Who's that hiding?" hailed Babalatchi.  "Come out and speak
to me."</p>

<p>Nobody answered.  Babalatchi crossed over, passing from boat
to boat, and poked his staff viciously in the suspicious place. 
Taminah jumped up with a cry.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, surprised.  "I have nearly
stepped on your tray.  Am I a Dyak that you should hide at my
sight?"</p>

<p>"I was weary, and &mdash;I slept," whispered Taminah, confusedly.</p>

<p>"You slept!  You have not sold anything to-day, and you will
be beaten when you return home," said Babalatchi.</p>

<p>Taminah stood before him abashed and silent.  Babalatchi looked
her over carefully with great satisfaction.  Decidedly he would
offer fifty dollars more to that thief Bulangi.  The girl pleased
him.</p>

<p>"Now you go home.  It is late," he said sharply.  "Tell Bulangi
that I shall be near his house before the night is half over,
and that I want him to make all things ready for a long journey. 
You understand?  A long journey to the southward.  Tell him that
before sunset, and do not forget my words."</p>

<p>Taminah made a gesture of assent, and watched Babalatchi recross
the ditch and disappear through the bushes bordering Almayer's
compound.  She moved a little further off the creek and sank in
the grass again, lying down on her face, shivering in dry-eyed
misery.</p>

<p>Babalatchi walked straight towards the cooking-shed looking for
Mrs. Almayer.  The courtyard was in a great uproar.  A strange
Chinaman had possession of the kitchen fire and was noisily demanding
another saucepan.  He hurled objurgations, in the Canton dialect
and bad Malay, against the group of slave-girls standing a little
way off, half frightened, half amused, at his violence.  From
the camping fires round which the seamen of the frigate were sitting
came words of encouragement, mingled with laughter and jeering. 
In the midst of this noise and confusion Babalatchi met Ali, an
empty dish in his hand.</p>

<p>"Where are the white men?" asked Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"They are eating in the front verandah," answered Ali.  "Do not
stop me, Tuan.  I am giving the white men their food and am busy."</p>

<p>"Where's Mem Almayer?"</p>

<p>"Inside in the passage.  She is listening to the talk."</p>

<p>Ali grinned and passed on; Babalatchi ascended the plankway to
the rear verandah, and beckoning out Mrs. Almayer, engaged her
in earnest conversation.  Through the long passage, closed at
the further end by the red curtain, they could hear from time
to time Almayer's voice mingling in conversation with an abrupt
loudness that made Mrs. Almayer look significantly at Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said.  "He has drunk much."</p>

<p>"He has," whispered Babalatchi.  "He will sleep heavily to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Almayer looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the devil of strong gin makes him keep awake, and
he walks up and down the verandah all night, cursing; then we
stand afar off," explained Mrs. Almayer, with the fuller knowledge
born of twenty odd years of married life.</p>

<p>"But then he does not hear, nor understand, and his hand, of
course, has no strength.  We do not want him to hear to-night."</p>

<p>"No," assented Mrs. Almayer, energetically, but in a cautiously
subdued voice.  "If he hears he will kill."</p>

<p>Babalatchi looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"Hai Tuan, you may believe me.  Have I not lived many years with
that man?  Have I not seen death in that man's eyes more than
once when I was younger and he guessed at many things.  Had he
been a man of my own people I would not have seen such a look
twice; but he&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a contemptuous gesture she seemed to fling unutterable scorn
on Almayer's weak-minded aversion to sudden bloodshed.</p>

<p>"If he has the wish but not the strength, then what do we fear?"
asked Babalatchi, after a short silence during which they both
listened to Almayer's loud talk till it subsided into the murmur
of general conversation.  "What do we fear?" repeated Babalatchi
again.</p>

<p>"To keep the daughter whom he loves he would strike into your
heart and mine without hesitation," said Mrs. Almayer.  "When
the girl is gone he will be like the devil unchained.  Then you
and I had better beware."</p>

<p>"I am an old man and fear not death," answered Babalatchi, with
a mendacious assumption of indifference.  "But what will you do?"</p>

<p>"I am an old woman, and wish to live," retorted Mrs. Almayer. 
"She is my daughter also.  I shall seek safety at the feet of
our Rajah, speaking in the name of the past when we both were
young, and he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Babalatchi raised his hand.</p>

<p>"Enough.  You shall be protected," he said soothingly.</p>

<p>Again the sound of Almayer's voice was heard, and again interrupting
their talk, they listened to the confused but loud utterance coming
in bursts of unequal strength, with unexpected pauses and noisy
repetitions that made some words and sentences fall clear and
distinct on their ears out of the meaningless jumble of excited
shoutings emphasised by the thumping of Almayer's fist upon the
table.  On the short intervals of silence, the high complaining
note of tumblers, standing close together and vibrating to the
shock, lingered, growing fainter, till it leapt up again into
tumultuous ringing, when a new idea started a new rush of words
and brought down the heavy hand again.  At last the quarrelsome
shouting ceased, and the thin plaint of disturbed glass died away
into reluctant quietude.</p>

<p>Babalatchi and Mrs. Almayer had listened curiously, their bodies
bent and their ears turned towards the passage.  At every louder
shout they nodded at each other with a ridiculous affectation
of scandalised propriety, and they remained in the same attitude
for some time after the noise had ceased.</p>

<p>"This is the devil of gin," whispered Mrs. Almayer.  "Yes; he
talks like that sometimes when there is nobody to hear him."</p>

<p>"What does he say?" inquired Babalatchi, eagerly.  "You ought
to understand."</p>

<p>"I have forgotten their talk.  A little I understood.  He spoke
without any respect of the white ruler in Batavia, and of protection,
and said he had been wronged; he said that several times.  More
I did not understand. Listen!  Again he speaks!"</p>

<p>"Tse! tse! tse!" clicked Babalatchi, trying to appear shocked,
but with a joyous twinkle of his solitary eye.  "There will be
great trouble between those white men.  I will go round now and
see.  You tell your daughter that there is a sudden and a long
journey before her, with much glory and splendour at the end. 
And tell her that Dain must go, or he must die, and that he will
not go alone."</p>

<p>"No, he will not go alone," slowly repeated Mrs. Almayer, with
a thoughtful air, as she crept into the passage after seeing Babalatchi
disappear round the corner of the house.</p>

<p>The statesman of Sambir, under the impulse of vivid curiosity,
made his way quickly to the front of the house, but once there
he moved slowly and cautiously as he crept step by step up the
stairs of the verandah.  On the highest step he sat down quietly,
his feet on the steps below, ready for flight should his presence
prove unwelcome.  He felt pretty safe so. The table stood nearly
endways to him, and he saw Almayer's back; at Nina he looked full
face, and had a side view of both officers; but of the four persons
sitting at the table only Nina and the younger officer noticed
his noiseless arrival.  The momentary dropping of Nina's eyelids
acknowledged Babalatchi's presence; she then spoke at once to
the young sub, who turned towards her with attentive alacrity,
but her gaze was fastened steadily on her father's face while
Almayer was speaking uproariously.</p>

<p>" . . . disloyalty and unscrupulousness!  What have you ever
done to make me loyal?  You have no grip on this country.  I had
to take care of myself, and when I asked for protection I was
met with threats and contempt, and had Arab slander thrown in
my face.  I! a white man!"</p>

<p>"Don't be violent, Almayer," remonstrated the lieutenant; "I
have heard all this already."</p>

<p>"Then why do you talk to me about scruples?  I wanted money,
and I gave powder in exchange.  How could I know that some of
your wretched men were going to be blown up?  Scruples!  Pah!"</p>

<p>He groped unsteadily amongst the bottles, trying one after another,
grumbling to himself the while.</p>

<p>"No more wine," he muttered discontentedly.</p>

<p>"You have had enough, Almayer," said the lieutenant, as he lighted
a cigar.  "Is it not time to deliver to us your prisoner?  I take
it you have that Dain Maroola stowed away safely somewhere.  Still
we had better get that business over, and then we shall have more
drink.  Come! don't look at me like this."</p>

<p>Almayer was staring with stony eyes, his trembling fingers fumbling
about his throat.</p>

<p>"Gold," he said with difficulty.  "Hem!  A hand on the windpipe,
you know.  Sure you will excuse.  I wanted to say&mdash;a little gold
for a little powder.  What's that?"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the lieutenant soothingly.</p>

<p>"No!  You don't know.  Not one of you knows!" shouted Almayer. 
"The government is a fool, I tell you.  Heaps of gold.  I am the
man that knows; I and another one.  But he won't speak.  He is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself with a feeble smile, and, making an unsuccessful
attempt to pat the officer on the shoulder, knocked over a couple
of empty bottles.</p>

<p>"Personally you are a fine fellow," he said very distinctly,
in a patronising manner.  His head nodded drowsily as he sat muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>The two officers looked at each other helplessly.</p>

<p>"This won't do," said the lieutenant, addressing his junior. 
"Have the men mustered in the compound here.  I must get some
sense out of him.  Hi! Almayer!  Wake up, man.  Redeem your word. 
You gave your word.  You gave your word of honour, you know."</p>

<p>Almayer shook off the officer's hand with impatience, but his
ill-humour vanished at once, and he looked up, putting his forefinger
to the side of his nose.</p>

<p>"You are very young; there is time for all things," he said,
with an air of great sagacity.</p>

<p>The lieutenant turned towards Nina, who, leaning back in her
chair, watched her father steadily.</p>

<p>"Really I am very much distressed by all this for your sake,"
he exclaimed.  "I do not know;" he went on, speaking with some
embarrassment, "whether I have any right to ask you anything,
unless, perhaps, to withdraw from this painful scene, but I feel
that I must&mdash;for your father's good&mdash;suggest that you should &mdash;I
mean if you have any influence over him you ought to exert it
now to make him keep the promise he gave me before he&mdash;before
he got into this state."</p>

<p>He observed with discouragement that she seemed not to take any
notice of what he said sitting still with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>"I trust&mdash;" he began again.</p>

<p>"What is the promise you speak of?" abruptly asked Nina, leaving
her seat and moving towards her father.</p>

<p>"Nothing that is not just and proper.  He promised to deliver
to us a man who in time of profound peace took the lives of innocent
men to escape the punishment he deserved for breaking the law. 
He planned his mischief on a large scale.  It is not his fault
if it failed, partially.  Of course you have heard of Dain Maroola. 
Your father secured him, I understand.  We know he escaped up
this river.  Perhaps you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he killed white men!" interrupted Nina.</p>

<p>"I regret to say they were white.  Yes, two white men lost their
lives through that scoundrel's freak."</p>

<p>"Two only!" exclaimed Nina.</p>

<p>The officer looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why! why!  You&mdash;" he stammered, confused.</p>

<p>"There might have been more," interrupted Nina.  "And when you
get this&mdash;this scoundrel will you go?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant, still speechless, bowed his assent.</p>

<p>"Then I would get him for you if I had to seek him in a burning
fire," she burst out with intense energy.  "I hate the sight of
your white faces.  I hate the sound of your gentle voices.  That
is the way you speak to women, dropping sweet words before any
pretty face.  I have heard your voices before.  I hoped to live
here without seeing any other white face but this," she added
in a gentler tone, touching lightly her father's cheek.</p>

<p>Almayer ceased his mumbling and opened his eyes.  He caught hold
of his daughter's hand and pressed it to his face, while Nina
with the other hand smoothed his rumpled grey hair, looking defiantly
over her father's head at the officer, who had now regained his
composure and returned her look with a cool, steady stare.  Below,
in front of the verandah, they could hear the tramp of seamen
mustering there according to orders.  The sub-lieutenant came
up the steps, while Babalatchi stood up uneasily and, with finger
on lip, tried to catch Nina's eye.</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," whispered Almayer, absently, dropping
his daughter's hand.</p>

<p>"Father! father!" she cried, bending over him with passionate
entreaty. "See those two men looking at us.  Send them away. 
I cannot bear it any more.  Send them away.  Do what they want
and let them go."</p>

<p>She caught sight of Babalatchi and ceased speaking suddenly,
but her foot tapped the floor with rapid beats in a paroxysm of
nervous restlessness. The two officers stood close together looking
on curiously.</p>

<p>"What has happened?  What is the matter?" whispered the younger
man.</p>

<p>"Don't know," answered the other, under his breath.  "One is
furious, and the other is drunk.  Not so drunk, either.  Queer,
this.  Look!"</p>

<p>Almayer had risen, holding on to his daughter's arm.  He hesitated
a moment, then he let go his hold and lurched half-way across
the verandah. There he pulled himself together, and stood very
straight, breathing hard and glaring round angrily.</p>

<p>"Are the men ready?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Almayer, lead the way," said the lieutenant</p>

<p>Almayer rested his eyes on him as if he saw him for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Two men," he said thickly.  The effort of speaking seemed to
interfere with his equilibrium.  He took a quick step to save
himself from a fall, and remained swaying backwards and forwards. 
"Two men," he began again, speaking with difficulty.  "Two white
men&mdash;men in uniform&mdash;honourable men.  I want to say&mdash;men of honour. 
Are you?"</p>

<p>"Come!  None of that," said the officer impatiently.  "Let us
have that friend of yours."</p>

<p>"What do you think I am?" asked Almayer, fiercely.</p>

<p>"You are drunk, but not so drunk as not to know what you are
doing. Enough of this tomfoolery," said the officer sternly, "or
I will have you put under arrest in your own house."</p>

<p>"Arrest!" laughed Almayer, discordantly.  "Ha! ha! ha!  Arrest! 
Why, I have been trying to get out of this infernal place for
twenty years, and I can't.  You hear, man!  I can't, and never
shall!  Never!"</p>

<p>He ended his words with a sob, and walked unsteadily down the
stairs. When in the courtyard the lieutenant approached him, and
took him by the arm.  The sub-lieutenant and Babalatchi followed
close.</p>

<p>"That's better, Almayer," said the officer encouragingly.  "Where
are you going to?  There are only planks there.  Here," he went
on, shaking him slightly, "do we want the boats?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Almayer, viciously.  "You want a grave."</p>

<p>"What?  Wild again!  Try to talk sense."</p>

<p>"Grave!" roared Almayer, struggling to get himself free.  "A
hole in the ground.  Don't you understand?  You must be drunk. 
Let me go!  Let go, I tell you!"</p>

<p>He tore away from the officer's grasp, and reeled towards the
planks where the body lay under its white cover; then he turned
round quickly, and faced the semicircle of interested faces. 
The sun was sinking rapidly, throwing long shadows of house and
trees over the courtyard, but the light lingered yet on the river,
where the logs went drifting past in midstream, looking very distinct
and black in the pale red glow.  The trunks of the trees in the
forest on the east bank were lost in gloom while their highest
branches swayed gently in the departing sunlight.  The air felt
heavy and cold in the breeze, expiring in slight puffs that came
over the water.</p>

<p>Almayer shivered as he made an effort to speak, and again with
an uncertain gesture he seemed to free his throat from the grip
of an invisible hand.  His bloodshot eyes wandered aimlessly from
face to face.</p>

<p>"There!" he said at last.  "Are you all there?  He is a dangerous
man."</p>

<p>He dragged at the cover with hasty violence, and the body rolled
stiffly off the planks and fell at his feet in rigid helplessness.</p>

<p>"Cold, perfectly cold," said Almayer, looking round with a mirthless
smile.  "Sorry can do no better.  And you can't hang him, either. 
As you observe, gentlemen," he added gravely, "there is no head,
and hardly any neck."</p>

<p>The last ray of light was snatched away from the tree-tops, the
river grew suddenly dark, and in the great stillness the murmur
of the flowing water seemed to fill the vast expanse of grey shadow
that descended upon the land.</p>

<p>"This is Dain," went on Almayer to the silent group that surrounded
him. "And I have kept my word.  First one hope, then another,
and this is my last.  Nothing is left now.  You think there is
one dead man here? Mistake, I 'sure you.  I am much more dead. 
Why don't you hang me?" he suggested suddenly, in a friendly tone,
addressing the lieutenant.  "I assure, assure you it would be
a mat&mdash;matter of form altog&mdash;altogether."</p>

<p>These last words he muttered to himself, and walked zigzaging
towards his house.  "Get out!" he thundered at Ali, who was approaching
timidly with offers of assistance.  From afar, scared groups of
men and women watched his devious progress.  He dragged himself
up the stairs by the banister, and managed to reach a chair into
which he fell heavily.  He sat for awhile panting with exertion
and anger, and looking round vaguely for Nina; then making a threatening
gesture towards the compound, where he had heard Babalatchi's
voice, he overturned the table with his foot in a great crash
of smashed crockery.  He muttered yet menacingly to himself, then
his head fell on his breast, his eyes closed, and with a deep
sigh he fell asleep.</p>

<p>That night&mdash;for the first time in its history&mdash;the peaceful and
flourishing settlement of Sambir saw the lights shining about
"Almayer's Folly."  These were the lanterns of the boats hung
up by the seamen under the verandah where the two officers were
holding a court of inquiry into the truth of the story related
to them by Babalatchi.  Babalatchi had regained all his importance. 
He was eloquent and persuasive, calling Heaven and Earth to witness
the truth of his statements.  There were also other witnesses. 
Mahmat Banjer and a good many others underwent a close examination
that dragged its weary length far into the evening.  A messenger
was sent for Abdulla, who excused himself from coming on the score
of his venerable age, but sent Reshid.  Mahmat had to produce
the bangle, and saw with rage and mortification the lieutenant
put it in his pocket, as one of the proofs of Dain's death, to
be sent in with the official report of the mission.  Babalatchi's
ring was also impounded for the same purpose, but the experienced
statesman was resigned to that loss from the very beginning. 
He did not mind as long as he was sure, that the white men believed. 
He put that question to himself earnestly as he left, one of the
last, when the proceedings came to a close.  He was not certain. 
Still, if they believed only for a night, he would put Dain beyond
their reach and feel safe himself.  He walked away fast, looking
from time to time over his shoulder in the fear of being followed,
but he saw and heard nothing.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," said the lieutenant, looking at his watch and
yawning.  "I shall hear some of the captain's complimentary remarks
when we get back. Miserable business, this."</p>

<p>"Do you think all this is true?" asked the younger man.</p>

<p>"True!  It is just possible.  But if it isn't true what can we
do?  If we had a dozen boats we could patrol the creeks; and that
wouldn't be much good.  That drunken madman was right; we haven't
enough hold on this coast.  They do what they like.  Are our hammocks
slung?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told the coxswain.  Strange couple over there," said
the sub, with a wave of his hand towards Almayer's house.</p>

<p>"Hem!  Queer, certainly.  What have you been telling her?  I
was attending to the father most of the time."</p>

<p>"I assure you I have been perfectly civil," protested the other
warmly.</p>

<p>"All right.  Don't get excited.  She objects to civility, then,
from what I understand.  I thought you might have been tender. 
You know we are on service."</p>

<p>"Well, of course.  Never forget that.  Coldly civil.  That's
all."</p>

<p>They both laughed a little, and not feeling sleepy began to pace
the verandah side by side.  The moon rose stealthily above the
trees, and suddenly changed the river into a stream of scintillating
silver.  The forest came out of the black void and stood sombre
and pensive over the sparkling water.  The breeze died away into
a breathless calm.</p>

<p>Seamanlike, the two officers tramped measuredly up and down without
exchanging a word.  The loose planks rattled rhythmically under
their steps with obstrusive dry sound in the perfect silence of
the night.  As they were wheeling round again the younger man
stood attentive.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No!" said the other.  "Hear what?"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a cry.  Ever so faint.  Seemed a woman's voice. 
In that other house.  Ah!  Again!  Hear it?"</p>

<p>"No," said the lieutenant, after listening awhile.  "You young
fellows always hear women's voices.  If you are going to dream
you had better get into your hammock.  Good-night."</p>

<p>The moon mounted higher, and the warm shadows grew smaller and
crept away as if hiding before the cold and cruel light.</p>
