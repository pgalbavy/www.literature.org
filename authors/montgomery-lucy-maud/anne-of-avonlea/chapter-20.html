<P>
Anne rose betimes the next morning and blithely greeted the fresh day,
when the banners of the sunrise were shaken triumphantly across the
pearly skies.  Green Gables lay in a pool of sunshine, flecked with
the dancing shadows of poplar and willow.  Beyond the land was
Mr. Harrison's wheatfield, a great, windrippled expanse of pale gold.
The world was so beautiful that Anne spent ten blissful minutes
hanging idly over the garden gate drinking the loveliness in.
<P>
After breakfast Marilla made ready for her journey.  Dora was to go
with her, having been long promised this treat.
<P>
"Now, Davy, you try to be a good boy and don't bother Anne," she
straitly charged him.  "If you are good I'll bring you a striped
candy cane from town."
<P>
For alas, Marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people
to be good!
<P>
"I won't be bad on purpose, but s'posen I'm bad zacksidentally?"
Davy wanted to know.
<P>
"You'll have to guard against accidents," admonished Marilla. 
"Anne, if Mr. Shearer comes today get a nice roast and some steak. 
If he doesn't you'll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow."
<P>
Anne nodded.
<P>
"I'm not going to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself today,"
she said.  "That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and I'll have some
steak fried for you when you come home at night."
<P>
"I'm going to help Mr. Harrison haul dulse this morning," announced Davy.
"He asked me to, and I guess he'll ask me to dinner too.  Mr. Harrison is
an awful kind man.  He's a real sociable man.  I hope I'll be like him
when I grow up.  I mean BEHAVE like him. . .I don't want to LOOK like him.
But I guess there's no danger, for Mrs. Lynde says I'm a very handsome child.
Do you s'pose it'll last, Anne?  I want to know"
<P>
"I daresay it will," said Anne gravely.  "You ARE a handsome boy, Davy,"
. . .Marilla looked volumes of disapproval. . ."but you must live up to
it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be."
<P>
"And you told Minnie May Barry the other day, when you found her crying
'cause some one said she was ugly, that if she was nice and kind and
loving people wouldn't mind her looks," said Davy discontentedly.
"Seems to me you can't get out of being good in this world for
some reason or 'nother.  You just HAVE to behave."
<P>
"Don't you want to be good?" asked Marilla, who had learned a great
deal but had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions.
<P>
"Yes, I want to be good but not TOO good," said Davy cautiously. 
"You don't have to be very good to be a Sunday School superintendent.
Mr. Bell's that, and he's a real bad man."
<P>
"Indeed he's not," said Marila indignantly.
<P>
"He is. . .he says he is himself," asseverated Davy.  "He said it
when he prayed in Sunday School last Sunday.  He said he was a vile
worm and a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest 'niquity. 
What did he do that was so bad, Marilla?  Did he kill anybody?
Or steal the collection cents?  I want to know."
<P>
Fortunately Mrs. Lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and
Marilla made off, feeling that she had escaped from the snare of
the fowler, and wishing devoutly that Mr. Bell were not quite so
highly figurative in his public petitions, especially in the
hearing of small boys who were always "wanting to know."
<P>
Anne, left alone in her glory, worked with a will.  The floor was
swept, the beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and
hung out on the line.  Then Anne prepared for the transfer of
feathers.  She mounted to the garret and donned the first old dress
that came to hand. . .a navy blue cashmere she had worn at
fourteen.  It was decidedly on the short side and as "skimpy" as
the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the occasion of her debut at
Green Gables; but at least it would not be materially injured by
down and feathers.  Anne completed her toilet by tying a big red
and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to Matthew over
her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the kitchen
chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her
carry the feather bed.
<P>
A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky
moment Anne looked into it.  There were those seven freckles on her
nose, more rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light
from the unshaded window.
<P>
"Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night," she thought.
"I'd better run down to the pantry and do it now."
<P>
Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles.
On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the
freckles remained.  A few days previously she had found a recipe
for a freckle lotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were
within her reach, she straightway compounded it, much to the disgust
of Marilla, who thought that if Providence had placed freckles on
your nose it was your bounden duty to leave them there.
<P>
Anne scurried down to the pantry, which, always dim from the big
willow growing close to the window, was now almost dark by reason
of the shade drawn to exclude flies.  Anne caught the bottle
containing the lotion from the shelf and copiously anointed her
nose therewith by means of a little sponge sacred to the purpose. 
This important duty done, she returned to her work.  Any one who
has ever shifted feathers from one tick to another will not need to
be told that when Anne finished she was a sight to behold.  Her
dress was white with down and fluff, and her front hair, escaping from
under the handkerchief, was adorned with a veritable halo of feathers.
At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at the kitchen door.
<P>
"That must be Mr. Shearer," thought Anne.  "I'm in a dreadful mess
but I'll have to run down as I am, for he's always in a hurry."
<P>
Down flew Anne to the kitchen door.  If ever a charitable floor did
open to swallow up a miserable, befeathered damsel the Green Gables
porch floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment. 
On the doorstep were standing Priscilla Grant, golden and fair
in silk attire, a short, stout gray-haired lady in a tweed suit,
and another lady, tall stately, wonderfully gowned, with a
beautiful, highbred face and large, black-lashed violet eyes,
whom Anne "instinctively felt," as she would have said in her
earlier days, to be Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan.
<P>
In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the
confusion of Anne's mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial
straw.  All Mrs. Morgan's heroines were noted for "rising to the
occasion."  No matter what their troubles were, they invariably rose
to the occasion and showed their superiority over all ills of time,
space, and quantity.  Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise
to the occasion and she did it, so perfectly that Priscilla
afterward declared she never admired Anne Shirley more than
at that moment.  No matter what her outraged feelings were
she did not show them.  She greeted Priscilla and was introduced
to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been
arrayed in purple and fine linen.  To be sure, it was somewhat
of a shock to find that the lady she had instinctively felt
to be Mrs. Morgan was not Mrs. Morgan at all, but an unknown
Mrs. Pendexter, while the stout little gray-haired woman was
Mrs. Morgan; but in the greater shock the lesser lost its power.
Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and thence into the parlor,
where she left them while she hastened out to help Priscilla
unharness her horse.
<P>
"It's dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this,"
apologized Priscilla, "but I did not know till last night that we
were coming.  Aunt Charlotte is going away Monday and she had
promised to spend today with a friend in town.  But last night her
friend telephoned to her not to come because they were quarantined
for scarlet fever.  So I suggested we come here instead, for I knew
you were longing to see her.  We called at the White Sands Hotel and 
brought Mrs. Pendexter with us.  She is a friend of aunt's and lives
in New York and her husband is a millionaire.  We can't stay very long,
for Mrs. Pendexter has to be back at the hotel by five o'clock."
<P>
Several times while they were putting away the horse Anne caught
Priscilla looking at her in a furtive, puzzled way.
<P>
"She needn't stare at me so," Anne thought a little resentfully. 
"If she doesn't KNOW what it is to change a feather bed she might
IMAGINE it."
<P>
When Priscilla had gone to the parlor, and before Anne could escape
upstairs, Diana walked into the kitchen.  Anne caught her astonished
friend by the arm.
<P>
"Diana Barry, who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very
moment?  Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan. . .and a New York millionaire's
wife. . .and here I am like THIS. . .and NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE
FOR DINNER BUT A COLD HAM BONE, Diana!"
<P>
By this time Anne had become aware that Diana was staring at her
in precisely the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done.
It was really too much.
<P>
"Oh, Diana, don't look at me so," she implored.  "YOU, at least,
must know that the neatest person in the world couldn't empty
feathers from one tick into another and remain neat in the process."
<P>
"It. . .it. . .isn't the feathers," hesitated Diana.  "It's. . .
it's. . .your nose, Anne."
<P>
"My nose?  Oh, Diana, surely nothing has gone wrong with it!"
<P>
Anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink.  One glance
revealed the fatal truth.  Her nose was a brilliant scarlet!
<P>
Anne sat down on the sofa, her dauntless spirit subdued at last.
<P>
"What is the matter with it?" asked Diana, curiosity overcoming delicacy.
<P>
"I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it, but I must have
used that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs,"
was the despairing response.  "What shall I do?"
<P>
"Wash it off," said Diana practically.
<P>
"Perhaps it won't wash off.  First I dye my hair; then I dye my nose.
Marilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be
practicable in this case.  Well, this is another punishment for vanity
and I suppose I deserve it. . .though there's not much comfort in THAT.
It is really almost enough to make one believe in ill-luck, though Mrs.
Lynde says there is no such thing, because everything is foreordained."
<P>
Fortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne, somewhat consoled,
betook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home.  Presently
Anne came down again, clothed and in her right mind.  The muslin
dress she had fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the
line outside, so she was forced to content herself with her black
lawn.  She had the fire on and the tea steeping when Diana
returned; the latter wore HER muslin, at least, and carried a
covered platter in her hand.
<P>
"Mother sent you this," she said, lifting the cover and displaying
a nicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne's greatful eyes.
<P>
The chicken was supplemented by light new bread, excellent butter
and cheese, Marilla's fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums,
floating in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine. 
There was a big bowlful of pink-and-white asters also, by way of
decoration; yet the spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate
one formerly prepared for Mrs. Morgan.
<P>
Anne's hungry guests, however, did not seem to think anything was
lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment. 
But after the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was
or was not on her bill of fare.  Mrs. Morgan's appearance might be
somewhat disappointing, as even her loyal worshippers had been
forced to admit to each other; but she proved to be a delightful
conversationalist.  She had traveled extensively and was an
excellent storyteller.  She had seen much of men and women, and
crystalized her experiences into witty little sentences and
epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were listening to
one of the people in clever books.  But under all her sparkle there
was a strongly felt undercurrent of true, womanly sympathy and
kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy won
admiration.  Nor did she monopolize the conversation.  She could
draw others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself,
and Anne and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her.  Mrs.
Pendexter said little; she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips,
and ate chicken and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace
that she conveyed the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew.
But then, as Anne said to Diana later on, anybody so divinely beautiful
as Mrs. Pendexter didn't need to talk; it was enough for her just to LOOK.
<P>
After dinner they all had a walk through Lover's Lane and Violet
Vale and the Birch Path, then back through the Haunted Wood to the
Dryad's Bubble, where they sat down and talked for a delightful
last half hour.  Mrs. Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood
came by its name, and laughed until she cried when she heard the
story and Anne's dramatic account of a certain memorable walk
through it at the witching hour of twilight.
<P>
"It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn't it?"
said Anne, when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again.
"I don't know which I enjoyed more. . .listening to Mrs. Morgan or
gazing at Mrs. Pendexter.  I believe we had a nicer time than if
we'd known they were coming and been cumbered with much serving.
You must stay to tea with me, Diana, and we'll talk it all over."
<P>
"Priscilla says Mrs. Pendexter's husband's sister is married to an
English earl; and yet she took a second helping of the plum preserves,"
said Diana, as if the two facts were somehow incompatible.
<P>
"I daresay even the English earl himself wouldn't have turned up his
aristocratic nose at Marilla's plum preserves," said Anne proudly.
<P>
Anne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen HER nose when she
related the day's history to Marilla that evening.  But she took the
bottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window.
<P>
"I shall never try any beautifying messes again," she said, darkly
resolute.  "They may do for careful, deliberate people; but for
anyone so hopelessly given over to making mistakes as I seem to be
it's tempting fate to meddle with them."
