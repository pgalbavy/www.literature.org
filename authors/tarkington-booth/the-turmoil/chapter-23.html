<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Bibbs continued to live in the shelter of his dream. He had told
Edith, after his ineffective effort to be useful in her affairs,
that he had decided that he was "a member of the family"; but
he appeared to have relapsed to the retired list after that one
attempt at participancy&mdash;he was far enough detached from membership
now. These were turbulent days in the New House, but Bibbs had
no part whatever in the turbulence&mdash;he seemed an absent-minded
stranger, present by accident and not wholly aware that he was
present. He would sit, faintly smiling over pleasant imaginings
and dear reminiscences of his own, while battle raged between
Edith and her father, or while Sheridan unloosed jeremiads upon
the sullen Roscoe, who drank heavily to endure them. The happy
dreamer wandered into storm-areas like a somnambulist, and wandered
out again unawakened. He was sorry for his father and for Roscoe,
and for Edith and for Sibyl, but their sufferings and outcries
seemed far away.</p>

<p>Sibyl was under Gurney's care. Roscoe had sent for him on Sunday
night, not long after Bibbs returned the abandoned wraps; and
during the first days of Sibyl's illness the doctor found it necessary
to be with her frequently, and to install a muscular nurse. And
whether he would or no, Gurney received from his hysterical patient
a variety of pungent information which would have staggered anybody
but a family physician. Among other things he was given to comprehend
the change in Bibbs, and why the zinc-eater was not putting a
lump in the operator's gizzard as of yore.</p>

<p>Sibyl was not delirious&mdash;she was a thin little ego writhing and
shrieking in pain. Life had hurt her, and had driven her into
hurting herself; her condition was only the adult's terrible exaggeration
of that of a child after a bad bruise&mdash;there must be screaming
and telling mother all about the hurt and how it happened. Sibyl
babbled herself hoarse when Gurney withheld morphine. She went
from the beginning to the end in a breath. No protest stopped
her; nothing stopped her.</p>

<p>"You ought to let me die!" she wailed. "It's cruel not to let
me die! What harm have I ever done to anybody that you want to
keep me alive? Just look at my life! I only married Roscoe to
get away from home, and look what that got me into!&mdash;look where
I am now! He brought me to this town, and what did I have in my
life but his <em>FAMILY? </em>And they didn't even know the right
crowd! If they had, it might have been <em>SOMETHING! I </em>had
nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing in the world! I wanted to have a good
time&mdash;and how could I? Where's any good time among these Sheridans?
They never even had wine on the table! I thought I was marrying
into a rich family where I'd meet attractive people I'd read about,
and travel, and go to dances&mdash;and, oh, my Lord! all I got was
these Sheridans! I did the best I could; I did, indeed! Oh, I
<em>DID! I </em>just tried to live. Every woman's got a right
to live, some time in her life, I guess! Things were just beginning
to look brighter&mdash;we'd moved up here, and that frozen crowd across
the street were after Jim for their daughter, and they'd have
started us with the right people&mdash;and then I saw how Edith was
getting him away from me. She did it, too! She got him! A girl
with money can do that to a married woman&mdash;yes, she can, every
time! And what could I do? What can any woman do in my fix? I
couldn't do <em>ANYTHING </em>but try to stand it&mdash;and I couldn't
stand it! I went to that icicle&mdash;that Vertrees girl&mdash;and she could
have helped me a little, and it wouldn't have hurt her. It wouldn't
have done her any harm to help me <em>THAT </em>little! She treated
me as if I'd been dirt that she wouldn't even take the trouble
to sweep out of her house! Let her <em>WAIT</em>!"</p>

<p>Sibyl's voice, hoarse from babbling, became no more than a husky
whisper, though she strove to make it louder. She struggled half
upright, and the nurse restrained her. "I'd get up out of this
bed to show her she can't do such things to me! I was absolutely
ladylike, and she walked out and left me there alone! She'll <em>SEE!
</em>She started after Bibbs before Jim's casket was fairly underground,
and she thinks she's landed that poor loon&mdash;but she'll see! She'll
see! If I'm ever able to walk across the street again I'll show
her how to treat a woman in trouble that comes to her for help!
It wouldn't have hurt her any&mdash;it wouldn't&mdash;it wouldn't. And Edith
needn't have told what she told Roscoe&mdash;it wouldn't have hurt
her to let me alone. And HE told her I bored him&mdash;telephoning
him I wanted to see him. He needn't have done it! He needn't&mdash;needn't&mdash;"
Her voice grew fainter, for that while, with exhaustion, though
she would go over it all again as soon as her strength returned.
She lay panting. Then, seeing her husband standing disheveled
in the doorway, "Don't come in, Roscoe," she murmured. "I don't
want to see you." And as he turned away she added, "I'm kind of
sorry for you, Roscoe."</p>

<p>Her antagonist, Edith, was not more coherent in her own wailings,
and she had the advantage of a mother for listener. She had also
the disadvantage of a mother for duenna, and Mrs. Sheridan, under
her husband's sharp tutelage, proved an effective one. Edith was
reduced to telephoning Lamhorn from shops whenever she could juggle
her mother into a momentary distraction over a counter.</p>

<p>Edith was incomparably more in love than before Lamhorn's expulsion.
Her whole being was nothing but the determination to hurdle everything
that separated her from him. She was in a state that could be
altered by only the lightest and most delicate diplomacy of suggestion,
but Sheridan, like legions of other parents, intensified her passion
and fed it hourly fuel by opposing to it an intolerable force.
He swore she should cool, and thus set her on fire.</p>

<p>Edith planned neatly. She fought hard, every other evening, with
her father, and kept her bed betweentimes to let him see what
his violence had done to her. Then, when the mere sight of her
set him to breathing fast, she said pitiably that she might bear
her trouble better if she went away; it was impossible to be in
the same town with Lamhorn and not think always of him. Perhaps
in New York she might forget a little. She had written to a school
friend, established quietly with an aunt in apartments&mdash;and a
month or so of theaters and restaurants might bring peace. Sheridan
shouted with relief; he gave her a copious cheque, and she left
upon a Monday morning wearing violets with her mourning and having
kissed everybody good-by except Sibyl and Bibbs. She might have
kissed Bibbs, but he failed to realize that the day of her departure
had arrived, and was surprised, on returning from his zinc-eater,
that evening, to find her gone. "I suppose they'll be maried there,"
he said, casually.</p>

<p>Sheridan, seated, warming his stockinged feet at the fire, jumped
up, fuming. "Either you go out o' here, or I will, Bibbs!" he
snorted. "I don't want to be in the same room with the particular
kind of idiot you are! She's through with that riff-raff; all
she needed was to be kept away from him a few weeks, and I <em>KEPT
</em>her away, and it did the business. For Heaven's sake, go
on out o' here!"</p>

<p>Bibbs obeyed the gesture of a hand still bandaged. And the black
silk sling was still round Sheridan's neck, but no word of Gurney's
and no excruciating twinge of pain could keep Sheridan's hand
in the sling. The wounds, slight enough originally, had become
infected the first time he had dislodged the bandages, and healing
was long delayed. Sheridan had the habit of gesture; he could
not "take time to remember," he said, that he must be careful,
and he had also a curious indignation with his hurt; he refused
to pay it the compliment of admitting its existence.</p>

<p>The Saturday following Edith's departure Gurney came to the Sheridan
Building to dress the wounds and to have a talk with Sheridan
which the doctor felt had become necessary. But he was a little
before the appointed time and was obliged to wait a few minutes
in an anteroom&mdash;there was a directors' meeting of some sort in
Sheridan's office. The door was slightly ajar, leaking cigar-smoke
and oratory, the latter all Sheridan's, and Gurney listened.</p>

<p>"No, sir; no, sir; no, sir!" he heard the big voice rumbling,
and then, breaking into thunder, "I tell you NO! Some o' you men
make me sick! You'd lose your confidence in Almighty God if a
doodle-bug flipped his hind leg at you! You say money's tight
all over the country. Well, what if it is? There's no reason for
it to be tight, and it's not goin' to keep <em>OUR </em>money
tight! You're always runnin' to the woodshed to hide your nickels
in a crack because some fool newspaper says the market's a little
skeery! You listen to every street-corner croaker and then come
and set here and try to scare ME out of a big thing! We're IN
on this&mdash;understand? I tell you there never <em>WAS </em>better
times. These are good times and big times, and I won't stand for
any other kind o' talk. This country's on its feet as it never
was before, and this city's on its feet and goin' to stay there!"
And Gurney heard a series of whacks and thumps upon the desk.
"'Bad times'!" Sheridan vociferated, with accompanying thumps.
"Rabbit talk! These times are glorious, I tell you! We're in the
promised land, and we're goin' to <em>STAY </em>there! That's
all, gentlemen. The loan goes!"</p>

<p>The directors came forth, flushed and murmurous, and Gurney hastened
in. His guess was correct: Sheridan had been thumping the desk
with his right hand. The physician scolded wearily, making good
the fresh damage as best he might; and then he said what he had
to say on the subject of Roscoe and Sibyl, his opinion meeting,
as he expected, a warmly hostile reception. But the result of
this conversation was that by telephonic command Roscoe awaited
his father, an hour later, in the library at the New House.</p>

<p>"Gurney says your wife's able to travel," Sheridan said brusquely,
as he came in.</p>

<p>"Yes." Roscoe occupied a deep chair and sat in the dejected attitude
which had become his habit. "Yes, she is."</p>

<p>"Edith had to leave town, and so Sibyl thinks she'll have to,
too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't put it that way," Roscoe protested, drearily.</p>

<p>"No, I hear <em>YOU </em>wouldn't!" There was a bitter gibe in
the father's voice, and he added: "It's a good thing she's goin'
abroad&mdash;if she'll stay there. I shouldn't think any of us want
her here any more&mdash;you least of all!"</p>

<p>"It's no use your talking that way," said Roscoe. "You won't
do any good."</p>

<p>"Well, when are you comin' back to your office?" Sheridan used
a brisker, kinder tone. "Three weeks since you showed up there
at all. When you goin' to be ready to cut out whiskey and all
the rest o' the foolishness and start in again? You ought to be
able to make up for a lot o' lost time and a lot o' spilt milk
when that woman takes herself out o' the way and lets you and
all the rest of us alone."</p>

<p>"It's no use, father, I tell you. I know what Gurney was going
to say to you. I'm not going back to the office. I'm <em>DONE</em>!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute before you talk that way!" Sheridan began his
sentry-go up and down the room. "I suppose you know it's taken
two pretty good men about sixteen hours a day to set things straight
and get 'em runnin' right again, down in your office?"</p>

<p>"They must be good men." Roscoe nodded indifferently. "I thought
I was doing about eight men's work. I'm glad you found two that
could handle it."</p>

<p>"Look here! If I worked you it was for your own good. There are
plenty men drive harder'n I do, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. There are some that break down all the other men that work
with 'em. They either die, or go crazy, or have to quit, and are
no use the rest of their lives. The last's my case, I guess&mdash;'complicated
by domestic difficulties'!"</p>

<p>"You set there and tell me you give up?" Sheridan's voice shook,
and so did the gesticulating hand which he extended appealingly
toward the despondent figure. "Don't do it, Roscoe! Don't say
it! Say you'll come down there again and be a man! This woman
ain't goin' to trouble you any more. The work ain't goin' to hurt
you if you haven't got her to worry you, and you can get shut
o' this nasty whiskey-guzzlin'; it ain't fastened on you yet.
Don't say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no use on earth," Roscoe mumbled. "No use on earth."</p>

<p>"Look here! If you want another month's vacation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know Gurney told you, so what's the use talking about 'vacations'?"</p>

<p>"Gurney!" Sheridan vociferated the name savagely. "It's Gurney,
Gurney, Gurney! Always Gurney! I don't know what the world's comin'
to with everybody runnin' around squealin', 'The doctor says this,'
and, 'The doctor says that'! It makes me sick! How's this country
expect to get its Work done if Gurney and all the other old nanny-goats
keep up this blattin'&mdash;'Oh, oh! Don't lift that stick o' wood;
you'll ruin your <em>NERVES!' </em>So he says you got 'nervous
exhaustion induced by overwork and emotional strain.' They always
got to stick the Work in if they see a chance! I reckon you did
have the 'emotional strain,' and that's all's the matter with
you. You'll be over it soon's this woman's gone, and Work's the
very thing to make you quit frettin' about her."</p>

<p>"Did Gurney tell you I was fit to work?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" Sheridan bellowed. "I'm so sick o' that man's name
I feel like shootin' anybody that says it to me!" He fumed and
chafed, swearing indistinctly, then came and stood before his
son. "Look here; do you think you're doin' the square thing by
me? Do you? How much you worth?"</p>

<p>"I've got between seven and eight thousand a year clear, of my
own, outside the salary. That much is mine whether I work or not."</p>

<p>"It is? You could'a pulled it out without me, I suppose you think,
at your age?"</p>

<p>"No. But it's mine, and it's enough."</p>

<p>"My Lord! It's about what a Congressman gets, and you want to
quit there! I suppose you think you'll get the rest when I kick
the bucket, and all you have to do is lay back and wait! You let
me tell you right here, you'll never see one cent of it. You go
out o' business now, and what would you know about handlin' it
five or ten or twenty years from now? Because I intend to <em>STAY
</em>here a little while yet, my boy! They'd either get it away
from you or you'd sell for a nickel and let it be split up and&mdash;"
He whirled about, marched to the other end of the room, and stood
silent a moment. Then he said, solemnly: "Listen. If you go out
now, you leave me in the lurch, with nothin' on God's green earth
to depend on but your brother&mdash;and you know what he is. I've depended
on you for it <em>ALL </em>since Jim died. Now you've listened
to that dam' doctor, and he says maybe you won't ever be as good
a man as you were, and that certainly you won't be for a year
or so&mdash;probably more. Now, that's all a lie. Men don't break down
that way at your age. Look at ME! And I tell you, you can shake
this thing off. All you need is a little <em>GET-</em>up and a
little gumption. Men don't go away for <em>YEARS </em>and then
come back into <em>MOVING </em>businesses like ours&mdash;they lose
the strings. And if you could, I won't let you&mdash;if you lay down
on me now, I won't&mdash;and that's because if you lay down you prove
you ain't the man I thought you were." He cleared his throat and
finished quietly: "Roscoe, will you take a month's vacation and
come back and go to it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Roscoe, listlessly. "I'm through."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sheridan. He picked up the evening paper from
a table, went to a chair by the fire and sat down, his back to
his son. "Good-by."</p>

<p>Roscoe rose, his head hanging, but there was a dull relief in
his eyes. "Best I can do," he muttered, seeming about to depart,
yet lingering. "I figure it out a good deal like this," he said.
"I didn't <em>KNOW </em>my job was any strain, and I managed all
right, but from what Gur&mdash;from what I hear, I was just up to the
limit of my nerves from overwork, and the&mdash;the trouble at home
was the extra strain that's fixed me the way I am. I tried to
brace, so I could stand the work and the trouble too, on whiskey&mdash;and
that put the finish to me! I &mdash;I'm not hitting it as hard
as I was for a while, and I reckon pretty soon, if I can get to
feeling a little more energy, I better try to quit entirely &mdash;I
don't know. I'm all in&mdash;and the doctor says so. I thought I was
running along fine up to a few months ago, but all the time I
was ready to bust, and didn't know it. Now, then, I don't want
you to blame Sibyl, and if I were you I wouldn't speak of her
as 'that woman,' because she's your daughter-in-law and going
to stay that way. She didn't do anything wicked. It was a shock
to me, and I don't deny it, to find what she had done&mdash;encouraging
that fellow to hang around her after he began trying to flirt
with her, and losing her head over him the way she did. I don't
deny it was a shock and that it'll always be a hurt inside of
me I'll never get over. But it was my fault; I didn't understand
a woman's nature." Poor Roscoe spoke in the most profound and
desolate earnest. "A woman craves society, and gaiety, and meeting
attractive people, and traveling. Well, I can't give her the other
things, but I can give her the traveling&mdash;real traveling, not
just going to Atlantic City or New Orleans, the way she has, two,
three times. A woman has to have something in her life besides
a business man. And that's <em>ALL I </em>was. I never understood
till I heard her talking when she was so sick, and I believe if
you'd heard her then you wouldn't speak so hard-heartedly about
her; I believe you might have forgiven her like I have. That's
all. I never cared anything for any girl but her in my life, but
I was so busy with business I put it ahead of her. I never <em>THOUGHT
</em>about her, I was so busy thinking business. Well, this is
where it's brought us to&mdash;and now when you talk about 'business'
to me I feel the way you do when anybody talks about Gurney to
you. The word 'business' makes me dizzy&mdash;it makes me honestly
sick at the stomach. I believe if I had to go down-town and step
inside that office door I'd fall down on the floor, deathly sick.
You talk about a 'month's vacation'&mdash;and I get just as sick. I'm
rattled&mdash;I can't plan &mdash;I haven't got any plans&mdash;can't make
any, except to take my girl and get just as far away from that
office as I can&mdash;and stay. We're going to Japan first, and if
we&mdash;"</p>

<p>His father rustled the paper. "I said good-by, Roscoe."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Roscoe, listlessly.</p>
