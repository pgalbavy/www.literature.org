<p>It struck Ned that there was something very strange in the continued
absence of the two hunters.</p>

<p>In thinking over the particulars of that rather curious buffalo
hunt, he could not believe it possible that he was more than two
miles from where he had made his start after the creature, and
where he separated from them. All three were upon the easterly
side of the herd, so that the trail made by his own animal could
not have been obliterated by the hoofs of the buffaloes, and nothing
could be easier than to follow it. Where, then, were they? What
was the cause of their absence? These were questions which he
asked himself again and again, and which he was unable to answer
in any manner satisfactory to himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him that by climbing one of the trees
near at hand, he might extend his view, and perhaps gain a portion
of the knowledge he was so desirous of obtaining. He acted upon
the thought at once, and, selecting the tallest, first concealed
his rifle, and then climbed to the very topmost branches. There
he was rewarded by a magnificent view, and one which promised
him some of the results he was seeking. With this extension of
his field of vision he discovered more than one evidence that
he was not in a solitude. In the first place, by looking to the
southward, a mass of dust and vapor was visible, indicating the
presence and progress of some sort of herd, perhaps a drove of
sheep from New Mexico, under the convoy of Indians who had shot
the rightful owners and stampeded their property. Looking westward,
another clump of trees was discerned, from the center of which
came just enough smoke to show that there must be a camp fire
beneath.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they are there!" exclaimed Ned, to himself, "and it
may be they have started the fire on purpose to guide me to them."</p>

<p>The point to which his attention was thus directed was no more
than a mile distant, and he wondered that he had not noted it
before. It resembled in many respects the one in which he passed
the night, and he saw from the course of the stream which ran
through the latter, that it most probably watered the former where
he believed the hunters were in camp.</p>

<p>Turning his eyes in another direction, the young wanderer was
greeted by a sight which agitated him scarcely less. There, no
more than a quarter of a mile distant, quietly grazing beside
the winding stream which flowed at the base of the tree, was the
very mustang which had been captured by the hunters and from whose
back he had been thrown when in pursuit of the buffalo. He instantly
lost all interest in the smoke of the camp fire in the greater
interest he felt in the question of securing possession of the
steed. Could he but remount him he would not care particularly
whether he met the hunters or not, for, once upon the back of
such a steed, he would consider himself competent to make the
rest of the journey alone.</p>

<p>"What's to hinder?" he asked himself, as he fixed his eyes longingly
upon the steed. "Dick says none of the Apaches have any animal
that can overtake him, and all I have to do is to keep his head
turned toward the southwest. There is a trail through the mountains
yonder, and Corporal Hugg told me that there is a trail all the
way. But can I catch him?"</p>

<p>He enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure he would feel when, possessing
rifle, ammunition and horse he should resume his journey westward
and the delight and joy of his father when he should clasp him
in his arms again. He could have spent several hours building
his air-castles in this manner, had he not checked himself and
resolutely faced the difficulty before him. Looking again at the
mustang, he was to be seen with his beautiful Indian blanket somewhat
soiled from contact with the dirt, but cropping the grass with
the air of an equine which expected to spend the day at it.</p>

<p>Ned decided to try and steal upon him from the rear, thinking,
possibly, that he might get so close that when the frightened
animal discovered him, he could step forward and grasp the bridle
before the mustang could gallop away. Accordingly, he circled
out upon the prairie until he got directly behind the animal,
when he began his approach. The horse continued quietly eating
until he was within a hundred feet, when he shifted his position
so that his side was exposed. Startled lest he should be seen,
Ned dropped down upon the grass and waited for him to resume his
first attitude. After crouching in this manner for something like
ten minutes, without any change taking place, he decided that
as "the mountain would not come to Mohammed then Mohammed should
go to the mountain," and he began crawling through the grass,
with his eye upon his prize. To accomplish this without attracting
notice was a delicate task, but he succeeded perfectly. Getting
the mustang in exact range, he resumed his advance upon him, advancing
until he was within twenty feet.</p>

<p>This was more favorable than he dared hope, and his heart beat
high with expectation. He almost felt the warm body of the noble
steed beneath him. And now, inch by inch, he stole forward, like
an Indian scout moving upon a sleeping enemy until he could reach
a point where he could bury his tomahawk in his skull.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he will use those heels upon me?" reflected
the lad, when he had reduced the intervening distance to a dozen
feet. "If he were only blind in one eye, and I could get upon
that side; but then he isn't."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the greatest danger was the mustang hearing
the throbbing of his heart, which was now beating like a trip-hammer;
but the horse was as unconscious as if he were made of stone.
Still nearer, until it appeared as if he had to make but a single
leap forward, and he could grasp the long, flowing tail, and he
felt that the moment had come when he must make the attempt. Crouching
with one hand thrust out, he lifted one foot and advanced a few
inches. Another step, and he could lay his hand upon him. At this
exciting juncture, the horse abruptly ceased eating and raised
his head. Ned saw it, and paused in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>STILL NEARER, UNTIL IT APPEARED AS IF HE HAD
TO MAKE BUT A SINGLE LEAP FORWARD</em>.]</p>

<p>Looking straight off upon the prairie, the mustang gave a faint
whinney, as if he scented danger from a point directly opposite
to where the figure of the boy was stealing upon him. For a minute
the two held these stationary positions; and then, as the lad
moved a few inches again, the keen ears of the mustang told him
the truth.</p>

<p>Pricking his ears forward, he turned his head half way round,
so that he saw the crouching figure directly at his heels. Then
he turned his head still further, and gathered himself for a leap.
But Ned was expecting this; and, as quick as a flash, he leaped
forward and caught the tuft of hair hanging over his forehead,
dropping his gun and seizing at the same moment, with the other
hand, the bridle-rein. The mustang made his leap, but the lad
held on, and, by a quick, powerful effort threw one leg over his
shoulders and slid upon his back in a twinkling. The horse was
outwitted, defeated, and the boy was his conqueror.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted the latter, overflowing with exultation. "Thank
the Lord! I've had better fortune than I expected."</p>

<p>The mustang was not an ugly-tempered creature, but would have
given the lad the slip, could he have done so. It may have been
that because he was nothing but a boy, he underestimated his capacity
too much; but he had been fairly outgeneraled, and he submitted
with a grace which cannot be too highly commended. He instantly
became docile, and turned in ready obedience to the rein, and
trotted back to where the gun lay upon the ground. Here Ned was
obliged to descend again, but he kept a tight grasp upon the strap,
and scrambled back again as soon as he had recovered it. It seemed
to him, as he did so, that there was something like a mischievous
twinkle in the eye of the pony. He appeared to say:</p>

<p>"It don't do to trust my species too far, my lad; for we prefer
to be free rather than slave. However, you are a brave little
fellow, and have done so well that I think I must stand by you
hereafter."</p>

<p>Now that Ned was himself again, he turned the head of his animal
toward the grove, where the thin smoke could still be seen creeping
up through the tree tops.</p>

<p>"I will have quite a story to tell Dick and Tom," he reflected,
as he rode along at an easy gallop. "I killed my buffalo, lost
my horse, and caught him again. I don't believe that they themselves
could have done much better."</p>
