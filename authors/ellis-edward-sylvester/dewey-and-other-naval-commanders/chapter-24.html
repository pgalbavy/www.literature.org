<p>Two Worthy Sons&mdash;William D. Porter &mdash;The Career of Admiral
David Dixon Porter.</p>

<p>The reader will not forget the exploits of Captain David Porter,
in command of the <em>Essex</em> in the War of 1812. Contrary
to the rule that great men never have great sons, Captain Porter
left two boys who possessed the same remarkable qualities as himself
and one of whom became more famous than his gallant father.</p>

<p>The eldest of his sons was William D., who was born in New Orleans
in 1809, but was educated in the North and was appointed to the
navy when fourteen years old. He was placed in command of a cumbrous
ironclad constructed from a ferryboat at the beginning of the
war and named the <em>Essex</em>, in honor of the famous cruiser
with which his father played havoc with the shipping of Great
Britain in the Pacific. In the attack on Fort Henry, in February,
1862, the <em>Essex</em>, while doing effective service, had her
boiler pierced by a shot from the enemy, with appalling consequences.
Porter was scalded and knocked senseless and twenty-nine officers
and men were disabled or killed by the escaping steam.</p>

<p>Later, when he had fully recovered, he was placed in command
of the <em>Essex</em>, which was repaired and greatly improved.
The Confederates had completed a more terrible ironclad than the
<em>Merrimac</em>, which they named the <em>Arkansas</em>. Manned
by brave officers and crew, it came down the Yazoo into the Mississippi,
and, secure in her fancied invulnerability, challenged the whole
Union fleet which was assisting in the siege of Vicksburg. In
the furious engagement that followed Captain Porter, with the
<em>Essex</em>, succeeded in destroying the ironclad. He rendered
his country other valuable service, but his health gave way, and,
while in the East for medical attendance, he died in the City
of New York at the age of fifty-three.</p>

<p>The more famous son of Captain Porter was David Dixon, who was
born in Chester, Pa., in 1813. He entered Columbia College, Washington,
when only eleven years old, but left it in 1824 to accompany his
father on his cruise in the West Indies to break up piracy in
those waters. When, two years later, Captain Porter entered the
Mexican navy he appointed his son a midshipman. He acquitted himself
gallantly in more than one fight with the Spanish cruisers. While
still a mere boy he was made a midshipman in the United States
navy. As a lieutenant he saw plenty of active service in the war
with Mexico, and, at the beginning of the Civil War, was one of
our most trusted officers. In command of the <em>Powhatan</em>
he covered the landing of the reinforcements for Fort Pickens
just in time to save its capture by Confederates.</p>

<p>One of the most important captures of the war was that of New
Orleans, in the spring of 1862. The naval forces were under the
command of Admiral Farragut, while Commander Porter had charge
of the mortar fleet. The principal defences below the city were
Forts Jackson and St. Philip. In approaching them Porter had his
ships dressed out with leaves and branches of trees, the clever
disguise proving an effectual protection from a very destructive
fire.</p>

<p>The furious bombardment lasted for several days and nights. The
river was spanned by a boom of logs, which it was necessary to
break through that the vessels might reach the city above. This
was done, Porter protecting the expedition which effected it.
When the situation of the forts became hopeless his demand for
their surrender was accepted and an officer came on board under
a flag of truce to complete the negotiations.</p>

<p>While Porter and his visitor were conversing an officer came
forward with the information that the immense floating battery
<em>Louisiana</em>, of four thousand tons burden and carrying
sixteen heavy guns, had been set on fire, as Admiral Cervera did
with his ships a generation later, when his escape was cut off
from Santiago.</p>

<p>"Such an act is anything but creditable to you," remarked Porter,
addressing the Confederate commander.</p>

<p>"I am not responsible for the acts of the naval officers," replied
the visitor.</p>

<p>The explanation was reasonable, and without any excitement, Commander
Porter renewed the conversation respecting the surrender, but
a few minutes later the officer again approached.</p>

<p>"The ropes which held the floating battery to the bank have been
burned and she is drifting down stream toward us."</p>

<p>"Are her guns loaded and is there much ammunition aboard?" asked
Porter of the Confederate commander.</p>

<p>"I suppose the guns are loaded, but I know nothing about naval
matters here," was the reply.</p>

<p>Just then the heated cannon began firing their huge charges,
which, though without aim, were likely to do injury to the Union
vessels toward which the battery was floating. Besides, the magazine
was stored with powder and the impending explosion could not fail
to be disastrous.</p>

<p>"If you do not mind it," said Porter, addressing the visitor,
"we will continue our negotiations."</p>

<p>In referring to this incident, the Admiral said:</p>

<p>"A good Providence, which directs the most important events,
sent the battery off toward Fort St. Philip, and, as it came abreast
of that formidable fort, it blew up with a force which scattered
the fragments in all directions, killing one of their own men
in the fort, and when the smoke cleared off it was nowhere to
be seen, having sunk immediately in the deep water of the Mississippi.
The explosion was terrific and was seen and heard for many miles
up and down the river. Had it occurred near the vessels, it would
have destroyed every one of them."</p>

<p>After the fall of New Orleans Porter was sent to Ship Island
to await the attack that was in contemplation upon New Orleans.
He was recalled by Admiral Farragut to aid him in the siege of
Vicksburg. In passing the batteries Porter had three of his vessels
disabled and twenty-nine men killed and wounded. The capture of
that last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi was a severe
and tedious task, but General Grant, with that bulldog tenacity
for which he was famous, held on until the 4th of July, 1863,
when General Pemberton, the Confederate commander, surrendered
his whole garrison of more than 20,000 men. In thus opening the
Mississippi all the way to the Gulf the navy rendered invaluable
assistance. Porter's aid was so important and his conduct so gallant
that he received the thanks of Congress and was created a full
rear admiral, his commission dating from July 4, 1863. In a public
dispatch the Secretary of the Navy said, addressing Admiral Porter:
"To yourself, your officers and the brave and gallant sailors
who have been so fertile in resources, so persistent and so daring
under all circumstances, I tender, in the name of the President,
the thanks and congratulations of the whole country on the fall
of Vicksburg."</p>

<p>One of the most disastrous expeditions of the Civil War was that
which was undertaken by General <em>N.P. </em>Banks, in the spring
of 1864. His ostensible purpose was to complete the conquest of
Texas and Louisiana, but there is good reason to believe that
the famous Red River expedition was little more than a huge cotton
speculation. Immense quantities were stored along the river and
could it have been secured would have been worth many hundred
thousand dollars to the captors. The charge has been made, with
apparent reason, that several Confederate leaders were concerned
in the "deal," seeing as they did, that the end of the Confederacy
was at hand. The trouble, however, was that other Confederates
like General Dick Taylor did all they could to defeat the purpose
of General Banks and they succeeded to perfection.</p>

<p>The Union commander had an army of 30,000 men with which he began
the ascent of the Red River. He captured Fort de Russy March 14
and then marched against Shreveport. His forces were strewn along
for miles, with no thought of danger, when at Sabine Cross Roads
they were furiously attacked by General Dick Taylor and routed
as utterly as was the first advance upon Manassas in July, 1861.
The demoralized men were rallied at Pleasant Hill, where they
were again attacked and routed by Taylor. Banks succeeded at last
in reaching New Orleans, where he was relieved of his command.</p>

<p>When Porter had waited a short time at the appointed place of
meeting for Banks's army a messenger reached him with news of
that General's defeat and his hurried retreat. Porter saw that
it would not do for him to delay an hour. He had had great difficulty
in getting his fifty vessels up the narrow stream, whose current
was falling so rapidly that it already appeared impossible to
get the fleet past the snags and shoals to the point of safety
two hundred miles below.</p>

<p>Improving every moment and under a continual fire from the shore,
Porter managed to descend something more than half way down the
river to Grand Ecore, where he found Banks and his demoralized
army. Porter advised the commander to remain where he was until
the spring rains would enable the fleet to ascend the river again,
but Banks was too frightened to do anything but retreat, and he
kept it up until he arrived at New Orleans.</p>

<p>The river fell so rapidly that all the fleet would have been
stranded above the falls but for the genius of Lieutenant-Colonel
Joseph Bailey, of Wisconsin, a military engineer who accompanied
Banks's expedition. Under his direction several thousand men were
set to work, and, at the end of twelve days, they had constructed
a series of wing dams, through which the vessels were safely floated
into the deeper water below the falls. This accomplished their
deliverance from what otherwise would have been certain destruction.
Porter pronounced the exploit of Bailey the greatest engineering
feat of the whole war. One of the Admiral's most pleasing traits
was his appreciation of the services of his assistants. He complimented
Bailey in glowing terms in his official report, secured his promotion
to brigadier-general and presented him with a sword which cost
nearly a thousand dollars.</p>

RIVER</em>.]</p>

<p>Porter was now transferred to the North Atlantic Squadron and
commanded the powerful naval contingents in the two attacks on
Fort Fisher, December, 1864, and January, 1865. In the latter
Porter and General Terry succeeded in capturing the last important
sea fortress belonging to the Confederates. Porter was promoted
to be vice-admiral in 1866 and admiral in 1870. He was superintendent
of the naval academy until 1869, and died in Washington, February
13, 1891, one day before the death of General Sherman.</p>
