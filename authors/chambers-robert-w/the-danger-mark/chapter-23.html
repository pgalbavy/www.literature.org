"My sister badly hurt in an accident; concussion, intermittent<br/>
consciousness. We fear spinal and internal injury. What train<br/>
can you catch?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>SCOTT SEAGRAVE</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>Which telegram to Josiah Bailey, <em>M.D., </em>started that
eminent general practitioner toward Roya-Neh in company with young
Dr. Goss, a surgeon whose brilliancy and skill did not interfere
with his self-restraint when there were two ways of doing things.</p>

<p>They were to meet in an hour at the 5.07 train; but before Dr.
Bailey set out for the rendezvous, and while his man was still
packing his suit-case, the physician returned to his office, where
a patient waited, head hanging, picking nervously at his fingers,
his prominent, watery eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>The young man neither looked up nor stirred when the doctor entered
and reseated himself, picking up a pencil and pad. He thought
a moment, squinted through his glasses, and continued writing
the prescription which the receipt of the telegram from Roya-Neh
had interrupted.</p>

<p>When he had finished he glanced over the slip of paper, removed
his gold-rimmed reading spectacles, folded them, balanced them
thoughtfully in the palm of his large and healthy hand, considering
the young fellow before him with grave, far-sighted eyes:</p>

<p>"Stuyvesant," he said, "this prescription is not going to cure
you. No medicine that I can give you is going to perform any such
miracle unless you help yourself. Nothing on earth that man has
invented, or is likely to invent, can cure your disease unless
by God's grace the patient pitches in and helps himself. Is that
plain talk?"</p>

<p>Quest nodded and reached shakily for the prescription; but the
doctor withheld it.</p>

<p>"You asked for plain talk; are you listening to what I'm saying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, yes," burst out Quest; "I'm going to pull myself together.
Didn't I tell you I would? But I've got to get a starter first,
haven't I? I've got to have something to key me up first. I've
explained to you that it's this crawling, squirming movement on
the backs of my hands that I can't stand for. I want it stopped;
I'll take anything you dope out; I'll do any turn you call for&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Very well. I've told you to go to Mulqueen's. Go <em>now</em>!"</p>

<p>"All right, doctor. Only they're too damn rough with a man. All
right; I'll go. I <em>did</em> go last winter, and look where
I am now!" he snarled suddenly. "Have I got to get up against
all that business again?"</p>

<p>"You came out in perfectly good shape. It was up to you," said
the doctor, coldly using the vernacular.</p>

<p>"How was it up to me? You all say that! How was it? I understood
that if I cut it out and went up there and let that iron-fisted
Irishman slam me around, that I'd come out all right. And the
first little baby-drink I hit began the whole thing again!"</p>

<p>"Why did you take it? You didn't have to."</p>

<p>"I wanted it," retorted Quest angrily.</p>

<p>"Not badly enough to make self-control impossible. That's what
you went up there for, to get back self-control. You got it but
didn't use it. Do you think there is any sort of magic serum Mulqueen
or I or anybody under Heaven can pump into you that will render
you immune from the consequences of making an alcohol sewer of
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I certainly supposed I could come out and drink like a gentleman,"
said the young man sullenly.</p>

<p>"Drink like a&mdash;<em>what</em>? A gentleman? What's that? What's
drinking like a gentleman? I don't know what it is. You either
drink alcohol or you don't; you either swill it or you don't.
Anybody can do either. I'm not aware that either is peculiar to
a gentleman. But I know that both are peculiar to fools."</p>

<p>Quest muttered, picking his fingers, and cast an ugly side look
at the physician.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you just said," snapped Dr. Bailey, "but I'll
tell you this: alcohol is poison and it has not&mdash;and never had&mdash;in
any guise whatever, the slightest compensating value for internal
use. It isn't a food; it's a poison; it isn't a beneficial stimulant;
it's a poison; it isn't an aid to digestion; it's a poison; it
isn't a life saver; it's a life taker. It's a parasite, forger,
thief, pander, liar, brutalizer, murderer!</p>

<p>"Those are the plain facts. There isn't, and there never has
been, one word to say for it or any excuse, except morbid predisposition
or self-inculcated inclination, to offer for swallowing it. Now
go to your brewers, your wine merchants, your champagne touts,
your fool undergraduates, your clubmen, your guzzling viveurs&mdash;and
they'll all tell you the contrary. So will some physicians. And
you can take your choice. Any ass can. That is all, my boy."</p>

<p>The young man glowered sulkily at the prescription.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that this will stop the jumps?"</p>

<p>"If you really believe that, you have never heard me say so,"
snapped Dr. Bailey.</p>

<p>"Well, what the devil will it do?"</p>

<p>"The directions are there. You have my memorandum of the régime
you are to follow. It will quiet you till you get to Mulqueen's.
Those two bits of paper, however, are useless unless you help
yourself. If you want to become convalescent you can&mdash;even yet.
It won't be easy; it will hurt; but you can do it, as I say, even
yet. But it is <em>you</em> who must do it, not I or that bit
of paper or Mulqueen!</p>

<p>"Just now you happen to want to get well because the effect of
alcohol poison disturbs you. Things crawl, as you say, on the
back of your hand. Naturally, you don't care for such phenomena.</p>

<p>"Well, I've given you the key to mental and physical regeneration.
Yours is not an inherited appetite; yours is not one of those
almost foredoomed and pitiable cases. It's a stupid case; and
a case of gross self-indulgence in stupidity that began in idleness.
And that, my son, is the truth."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" sneered Quest, rising and pocketing the prescription.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so. I've known your family for forty years, Stuyvesant.
I knew your parents; I exonerate them absolutely. Sheer laziness
and wilful depravity is what has brought you here to me on this
errand. You deliberately acquired a taste for intoxicants; you
haven't one excuse, one mitigating plea to offer for what you've
done to yourself.</p>

<p>"You stood high in school and in college; you were Phi Beta Kappa,
a convincing debater, a plausible speaker, an excellent writer
of good English&mdash;by instinct a good newspaper man. Also you were
a man adapted by nature to live regularly and beyond the coarser
temptations. But you were lazy!"</p>

<p>Dr. Bailey struck his desk in emphasis.</p>

<p>"The germ of your self-indulgence lay in gross selfishness. You
did what pleased you; and it suited you to do nothing. I'm telling
you how you've betrayed yourself&mdash;how far you'll have to climb
to win back. Some men need a jab with a knife to start their pride;
some require a friend's strong helping arm around them. You need
the jab. I'm trying to administer it without anæsthetics, by telling
you what some men think of you&mdash;that it is your monstrous selfishness
that has distorted your normal common sense and landed you where
you are.</p>

<p>"Selfishness alone has resulted in a most cruel and unnatural
neglect of your sister&mdash;your only living relative&mdash;in a deliberate
relapse into slothful and vicious habits; in neglect of a most
promising career which was already yours; in a contemptible willingness
to live on your sister's income after gambling away your own fortune.</p>

<p>"I know you; I carried you through teething and measles, my son:
and I've carried you through the horrors of alcoholic delirium.
And I say to you now that, with the mental degeneration already
apparent, and your naturally quick temper, if you break down a
few more cells in that martyred brain of yours, you'll end in
an asylum&mdash;possibly one reserved for the <em>criminal</em> insane."</p>

<p>A dull colour stained the pasty whiteness of Quest's face. For
several minutes he stood there, his fingers working and picking
at each other, his pale, prominent eyes glaring.</p>

<p>"That's a big indictment, doctor," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Thank God you think it so," returned the doctor. "If you will
stand by your better self for one week&mdash;for only one week&mdash;after
leaving Mulqueen's, I'll stand by you for life, my boy. Come!
You were a good sport once. And that little sister of yours is
worth it. Come, Stuyvesant; is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>He stepped forward and held out his large, firm, reassuring hand.
The young fellow took it limply.</p>

<p>"Done with you, doctor," he said without conviction; "it's hell
for mine, I suppose, if I don't make my face behave. You're right;
I'm the goat; and if I don't quit butting I'll sure end by slapping
some sissy citizen with an axe."</p>

<p>He gave the doctor's hand a perfunctory shake with his thin,
damp fingers; dropped it, turned to go, halted, retraced his steps.</p>

<p>"Will it give me the willies if I kiss a cocktail good-bye before
I start for that fresh guy, Mulqueen?"</p>

<p>"Start <em>now</em>, I tell you! Haven't I your word?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but on the way to buy transportation can't I offer myself
one last&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Can't</em> you be a good sport, Stuyve?"</p>

<p>The youth hesitated, scowled.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he said carelessly, turned and went out.</p>

<p>As he walked along in the slush he said to himself: "I guess
it's up the river for mine.... By God, it's a shame, for I'm feeling
pretty good, too, and that's no idle quip!... Old Squills handed
out a line of talk all right-o!... He landed it, too.... I ought
to find something to do."</p>

<p>As he walked, a faint glow stimulated his enervated intelligence;
ideas, projects long abandoned, desires forgotten, even a far
echo from the old ambition stirring in its slumber, quickened
his slow pulses. The ghost of what he might have been, nay, what
he <em>could</em> have made himself, rose wavering in his path.
Other ghosts, long laid, floated beside him, accompanying him&mdash;the
ghosts of dead opportunities, dead ideals, lofty inspirations
long, long strangled.</p>

<p>"A job," he muttered; "that's the wholesome dope for Willy. There
isn't a newspaper or magazine in town where I can't get next if
I speak easy. I can deliver the goods, too; it's like wiping swipes
off a bar&#11834;"</p>

<p>In his abstraction he had walked into the Holland House, and
he suddenly became conscious that he was confronting a familiarly
respectful bartender.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," he said, greatly disconcerted, "I want some French
vichy, Gus!" He made a wry face, and added: "Put a dash of tabasco
in it, and salt it."</p>

<p>A thick-lipped, ruddy-cheeked young fellow, celebrated for his
knowledge of horses, also notorious for other and less desirable
characteristics, stood leaning against the bar, watching him.</p>

<p>They nodded civilly to one another. Quest swallowed his peppered
vichy, pulled a long face and said:</p>

<p>"We're a pair of 'em, all right."</p>

<p>"Pair of what?" inquired the thick-lipped young man, face becoming
rosier and looking more than ever like somebody's groom.</p>

<p>"Pair of bum whips. We've laid on the lash too hard. I'm going
to stable my five nags&mdash;my five wits!"&mdash;he explained with a sneer
as the other regarded him with all the bovine intelligence of
one of his own stable-boys&mdash;"because they're foundered; and that's
the why, young four-in-hand!"</p>

<p>He left the bar, adding as he passed:</p>

<p>"I'm a rotting citizen, but you"&mdash;he laughed insolently&mdash;"you
have become phosphorescent!"</p>

<p>The street outside was all fog and melting snow; the cold vichy
he had gulped made him internally uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"A gay day to go to Mulqueen's," he muttered sourly, gazing about
for a taxicab.</p>

<p>There was none for hire at that moment; he walked on for a while,
feeling the freezing slush penetrate his boot-soles; and by degrees
a sullen temper rose within him, revolting&mdash;not at what he had
done to himself&mdash;but at the consequences which were becoming more
unpleasant every moment.</p>

<p>As he trudged along, slipping, sliding, his overcoat turned up
around his pasty face, his cheeks wet with the icy fog, he continued
swearing to himself, at himself, at the slush, the cold vichy
in his belly, the appetite already awakened which must be denied.</p>

<p>Denied?... Was he never to have one more decent drink? Was this
to be the absolute and final end? Certainly. Yet his imagination
could not really comprehend, compass, picture to himself life
made a nuisance by self-denial&mdash;life in any other guise except
as a background for inertia and indulgence.</p>

<p>He swore again, profanely asking something occult why he should
be singled out to be made miserable on a day like this? Why, among
all the men he knew, he must go skulking about, lapping up cold
mineral water and cocking one ear to the sounds of human revelry
within the Tavern.</p>

<p>As for his work&mdash;yes, he ought to do it.... Interest in it was
already colder; the flare-up was dying down; habitual apathy chilled
it to its embers. Indifference, ill-temper, self-pity, resentment,
these were the steps he was slowly taking backward. He took them,
in their natural sequence, one by one.</p>

<p>Old Squills meant well, no doubt, but he had been damned impertinent....
And why had Old Squills dragged in his sister, Sylvia?... He had
paid as much attention to her as any brother does to any sister....
And how had she repaid him?</p>

<p>Head lowered doggedly against the sleet which was now falling
thickly, he shouldered his way forward, brooding on his "honour,"
on his sister, on Dysart.</p>

<p>He had not been home in weeks; he did not know of his sister's
departure with Bunny Gray. She had left a letter at home for him,
because she knew no other addresses except his clubs; and inquiry
over the telephone elicited the information that he had not been
to any of them.</p>

<p>But he was going to one of them now. He needed something to kill
that vichy; he'd have one more honest drink in spite of all the
Old Squills and Mulqueens in North America!</p>

<p>At the Cataract Club there were three fashion-haunting young
men drinking hot Scotches: Dumont, his empurpled skin distended
with whiskey and late suppers, and all his former brilliancy and
wit cankered and rotten with it, and his slim figure and clean-cut
face fattened and flabby with it; Myron Kelter, thin, elegant,
exaggerated, talking eternally about women and his successes with
the frailer ones &mdash;Myron Kelter, son of a gentleman, eking
out his meagre income by fetching, carrying, pandering to the
rich, who were too fastidious to do what they paid him for doing
in their behalf; and the third, Forbes Winton, literary dilettante,
large in every feature and in waistcoat and in gesture&mdash;large,
hard, smooth&mdash;very smooth, and worth too many millions to be contradicted
when misstating facts to suit the colour of his too luxuriant
imagination.</p>

<p>These greeted Quest in their several and fashionably wearied
manners, inviting his soul to loaf.</p>

<p>Later he had a slight dispute with Winton, who surveyed him coldly,
and insolently repeated his former misstatement of a notorious
fact.</p>

<p>"What rot!" said Quest; "I leave it to you, Kelter; am I right
or not?"</p>

<p>Kelter began a soft and soothing discourse which led nowhere
at first but ended finally in a re-order for four hot Scotches.</p>

<p>Then Dumont's witty French blood&mdash;or the muddied dregs which
were left of it&mdash;began to be perversely amusing at Quest's expense.
Epigrams slightly frayed, a jest or two a trifle stale, humorous
inversions of well-known maxims, a biting retort, the originality
of which was not entirely free from suspicion, were his contributions
to the festivities.</p>

<p>Later Kelter's nicely modulated voice and almost affectionate
manner restrained Quest from hurling his glass at the inflamed
countenance of Mr. Dumont. But it did not prevent him from leaving
the room in a vicious temper, and, ultimately, the Cataract Club.</p>

<p>The early winter night had turned cold and clear; sidewalks glittered,
sheeted with ice. He inhaled a deep breath and expelled a reeking
one, hailed a cab, and drove to the railroad station.</p>

<p>Here he bought his tickets, choosing a midnight train; for the
journey to Mulqueen's was not a very long one; he could sleep
till seven in the car; and, besides, he had his luggage to collect
from the hotel he had been casually inhabiting. Also he had not
yet dined.</p>

<p>Bodily he felt better, now that the vichy had been "killed";
mentally his temper became more vicious than ever as he thought
of Dumont's blunted wit at his expense&mdash;a wit with edge enough
left to make a ragged, nasty wound.</p>

<p>"He'll get what's coming to him some day," snarled Quest, returning
to his cab; and he bade the driver take him to the Amphitheatre,
a restaurant resort, wonderful in terra-cotta rocks, papier-maché
grottos, and Croton waterfalls&mdash;haunted of certain semi-distinguished
pushers of polite professions, among whom he had been known for
years.</p>

<p>The place was one vast eruption of tiny electric lights, and
the lights of "the profession," and the demi-monde. Virtue and
its antithesis disguised alike in silk attire and pearl collars,
rubbed elbows unconcernedly among the papier-maché grottos; the
cascades foamed with municipal water, waiters sweated and scurried,
lights winked and glimmered, and the music and electric fans annoyed
nobody.</p>

<p>In its usual grotto Quest found the usual group, was welcomed
automatically, sat down at one of the tables, and gave his order.</p>

<p>Artists, newspaper men, critics, and writers predominated. There
was also a "journalist" doing "brilliant" space work on the <em>Sun</em>.
He had been doing it nearly a month and he was only twenty-one.
It was his first job. Ambition tickled his ribs; Fame leaned familiarly
over his shoulder; Destiny made eyes at him. His name was Bunn.</p>

<p>There was also a smooth-shaven, tired-eyed, little man who had
written a volume on Welsh-rarebits and now drew cartoons. His
function was to torment Bunn; and Bunn never knew it.</p>

<p>A critic rose from the busy company and departed, to add lustre
to his paper and a nail in the coffin of the only really clever
play in town.</p>

<p>"Kismet," observed little Dill, who did the daily cartoon for
the <em>Post</em>, "no critic would be a critic if he could be
a fifth-rate anybody else&mdash;or," he added, looking at Bunn, "even
a journalist."</p>

<p>"Is that supposed to be funny?" asked Bunn complacently. "<em>I</em>
intend to do art criticism for the <em>Herald</em>."</p>

<p>"What's the objection to my getting a job on it, too?" inquired
Quest, setting his empty glass aside and signalling the waiter
for a re-order. He expected surprise and congratulation.</p>

<p>Somebody said, "<em>You</em> take a job!" so impudently that
Quest reddened and turned, showing his narrow, defective teeth.</p>

<p>"It's my choice that I haven't taken one," he snarled. "Did you
think otherwise?"</p>

<p>"Don't get huffy, Stuyve," said a large, placid, fat novelist,
whose financial success with mediocre fiction had made him no
warmer favourite among his brothers.</p>

<p>A row of artists glanced up and coldly continued their salad,
their Vandyck beards all wagging in unison.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand," said Quest, leaning both elbows offensively
on Dill's table, "that the job I ask for I expect to get."</p>

<p>"You might have expected that once," said the cool young man
who had spoken before.</p>

<p>"And I do now!" retorted Quest, raising his voice. "Why not?"</p>

<p>Somebody said: "You can furnish good copy, all right, Quest;
you do it every day that you're not working."</p>

<p>Quest, astonished and taken aback at such a universal revelation
of the contempt in which he seemed to be held, found no reply
ready&mdash;nothing at hand except another glass of whiskey and soda.</p>

<p>Minute after minute he sat there among them, sullen, silent,
wincing, nursing his chagrin in deepening wrath and bitterness;
and his clouding mind perceived in the rebuke nothing that he
had ever done to deserve it.</p>

<p>Who the devil were these rag-tags and bob-tails of the world
who presumed to snub him&mdash;these restaurant-haunting outsiders,
among whom he condescended to sit, feeling always the subtle flattery
they ought to accord him by virtue of a social position hopeless
of attainment by any of them?</p>

<p>Who were they to turn on him like this when he had every reason
to suppose they were not only aware of the great talent he had
carelessly neglected to cultivate through all these years, but
must, in the secret recesses of their grubby souls, reluctantly
admire his disdain of the only distinctions they scrambled for
and could ever hope for?</p>

<p>His black looks seemed to disturb nobody; Bunn, self-centred,
cropped his salad complacently; the Vandyck beards wagged; another
critic or two left, stern slaves to duty and paid ads.</p>

</div>
<p>The lights bothered him; tremors crawled over and over his skin;
within him a dull rage was burning&mdash;a rage directed at no one
thing, but which could at any moment be focussed.</p>

<p>Men rose and left the table singly, by twos, in groups. He sat,
glowering, head partly averted, scowlingly aware of their going,
aware of their human interest in one another but not in him, aware
at last that he counted for nothing whatever among them.</p>

<p>Some spoke to him as they passed out; he made them no answer.
And at last he was alone.</p>

<p>Reaching for his empty glass, he miscalculated the distance between
it and his quivering fingers; it fell and broke to pieces. When
the waiter came he cursed him, flung a bill at him, got up, demanded
his coat and hat, swore at the pallid, little, button-covered
page who brought it, and lurched out into the street.</p>

<p>A cab stood there; he entered it, fell heavily into a corner
of the seat, bade the driver, "Keep going, damn you!" and sat
swaying, muttering, brooding on the wrongs that the world had
done him.</p>

<p>Wrongs! Yes, by God! Every hand was against him, every tongue
slandered him. Who was he that he should endure it any longer
in patience! Had he not been patient? Had he not submitted to
the insults of a fool of a doctor?&mdash;had he not stayed his hand
from punishing Dumont's red and distended face?&mdash;had he not silently
accepted the insolent retorts of these Grub Street literati who
turned on him and flouted the talent that lay dormant in him&mdash;dead,
perhaps&mdash;but dead or dormant, it still matched theirs! And they
knew it, damn them!</p>

<p>Had he not stood enough from the rotten world?&mdash;from his own
sister, who had flung his honour into his face with impunity!&mdash;from
Dysart, whose maddening and continual ignoring of his letters
demanding an explanation&#11834;</p>

<p>There seemed to come a sudden flash in his brain; he leaned from
the window and shouted an address to the cabman. His hat had fallen
beside him, but he did not notice its absence on his fevered head.</p>

<p>"I'll begin with <em>him</em>!" he repeated with a thick laugh;
"I'll settle with him first. Now we're going to see! Now we'll
find out about several matters&mdash;or I'll break his neck off!&mdash;or
I'll twist it off&mdash;wring it off!"</p>

<p>And he beat on his knees with his fists, railing, raging, talking
incoherently, laughing sometimes, sometimes listening, as though,
suddenly, near him, a voice was mocking him.</p>

<p>He had a pocket full of bills, crushed up; some he gave to the
cabman, some he dropped as he stuffed the others into his pockets,
stumbled toward a bronze-and-glass grille, and rang. The cabman
brought him his hat, put it on him, gathered up the dropped money,
and drove off with his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<p>Quest rang again; the door opened; he gave his card to the servant,
and stealthily followed him upstairs over the velvet carpet.</p>

<p>Dysart, in a velvet dressing-gown knotted in close about his
waist, looked over the servant's shoulders and saw Quest standing
there in the hall, leering at him.</p>

<p>For a moment nobody spoke; Dysart took the offered card mechanically,
glanced at it, looked at Quest, and nodded dismissal to the servant.</p>

<p>When he and the other man stood alone, he said in a low, uncertain
voice:</p>

<p>"Get out of here!"</p>

<p>But Quest pushed past him into the lighted room beyond, and Dysart
followed, very pale.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I've asked you questions, too," retorted Quest. "Answer mine
first."</p>

<p>"Will you get out of here?"</p>

<p>"Not until I take my answer with me."</p>

<p>"You're drunk!"</p>

<p>"I know it. Look out!"</p>

<p>Dysart moistened his bloodless lips.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" And, as Quest shouted a question
at him: "Keep quiet! Speak lower, I tell you. My father is in
the next room."</p>

<p>"What in hell do I care for your father? Answer me or I'll choke
it out of you! Answer me now, you dancing blackguard! I've got
you; I want my answer, and you've got to give it to me!"</p>

<p>"If you don't lower your voice," said Dysart between his teeth,
"I'll throw you out of that window!"</p>

<p>"Lower my voice? Why? Because the old fox might hear the young
one yap! What do I care for you or your doddering family&#11834;"</p>

<p>He went down with a sharp crash; Dysart struck him again as he
rose; then, beside himself, rained blows on him, drove him from
corner to corner, out of the room, into the hall, striking him
in the face till the young fellow reeled and fell against the
bath-room door. It gave; he stumbled into darkness; and after
him sprang Dysart, teeth set&mdash;sprang into the darkness which split
before him with a roar into a million splinters of fire.</p>

<p>He stood for a second swaying, reaching out to grasp at nothing
in a patient, persistent, meaningless way; then he fell backward,
striking a terrified servant, who shrank away and screamed as
the light fell on her apron and cuffs all streaked with blood.</p>

<p>She screamed again as a young man's white and battered face appeared
in the dark doorway before her.</p>

<p>"Is he hurt?" he asked. His dilated eyes were fixed upon the
thing on the floor. "What are you howling for? Is he&mdash;dead?" whispered
Quest. Suddenly terror overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way!" he yelled, hurling the shrieking maid aside,
striking the frightened butler who tried to seize him on the stairs.
There was another manservant at the door, who stood his ground
swinging a bronze statuette. Quest darted into the drawing-room,
ran through the music-room and dining-room beyond, and slammed
the door of the butler's pantry.</p>

<p>He stood there panting, glaring, his shoulder set against the
door; then he saw a bolt, and shot it, and backed away, pistol
swinging in his bleeding fist.</p>

<p>Servants were screaming somewhere in the house; doors slammed,
a man was shouting through a telephone amid a confusion of voices
that swelled continually until the four walls rang with the uproar.
A little later a policeman ran through the basement into the yard
beyond; another pushed his way to the pantry door and struck it
heavily with his night-stick, demanding admittance.</p>

<p>For a second he waited; then the reply came, abrupt, deafening;
and he hurled himself at the bolted door, and it flew wide open.</p>

<p>But Quest remained uninterested. Nothing concerned him now, lying
there on his back, his bruised young face toward the ceiling,
and every earthly question answered for him as long as time shall
last.</p>

<p>Up-stairs a very old and shrunken man sat shivering in bed, staring
vacantly at some policemen and making feeble efforts to reach
a wig hanging from a chair beside him&mdash;a very glossy, expensive
wig, nicely curled where it was intended to fall above the ears.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he quavered, smirking at everybody with crackled,
painted lips, "I know nothing whatever about this affair. You
must ask my son Jack, gentlemen&mdash;my son Jack&mdash;te-he!&mdash;oh, yes,
he knows; he can tell you a thing or two, I warrant you! Yes,
gentlemen, he's like all the Dysarts&mdash;fit for a fight or a frolic!&mdash;te-he!&mdash;he's
all Dysart, gentlemen&mdash;my son Jack. But he is a good son to me&mdash;yes,
yes!&mdash;a good son, a good son! Tell him I said so&mdash;and&mdash;good-night."</p>

<p>"Nutty," whispered a policeman. "Come on out o' this boodwar
and lave th' ould wan be."</p>

<p>And they left him smirking, smiling, twitching his faded lips,
and making vague sounds, lying there asleep in his dotage.</p>

<p>And all night long he lay mumbling his gums and smiling, his
sleep undisturbed by the stir and lights and tramp of feet around
him.</p>

<p>And all night long in the next room lay his son, white as marble
and very still.</p>

<p>Toward morning he spoke, asking for his father. But they had
decided to probe for the bullet, and he closed his eyes wearily
and spoke no more.</p>

<p>They found it. What Dysart found as the winter sun rose over
Manhattan town, his Maker only knows, for his sunken eyes opened
unterrified yet infinitely sad. But there was a vague smile on
his lips after he lay there dead.</p>

<p>Nor did his slayer lie less serenely where bars of sunlight moved
behind the lowered curtains, calm as a schoolboy sleeping peacefully
after the eternity of a summer day where he had played too long
and fiercely with a world too rough for him.</p>

<p>And so, at last, the indictments were dismissed against them
both and their cases adjourned <em>sine die</em>.</p>
