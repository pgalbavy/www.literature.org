My mother was a great reader, and with ten minutes to spare before 
the starch was ready would begin the 'Decline and Fall' - and 
finish it, too, that winter.  Foreign words in the text annoyed her 
and made her bemoan her want of a classical education - she had 
only attended a Dame's school during some easy months - but she 
never passed the foreign words by until their meaning was explained 
to her, and when next she and they met it was as acquaintances, 
which I think was clever of her.  One of her delights was to learn 
from me scraps of Horace, and then bring them into her conversation 
with 'colleged men.'  I have come upon her in lonely places, such 
as the stair-head or the east room, muttering these quotations 
aloud to herself, and I well remember how she would say to the 
visitors, 'Ay, ay, it's very true, Doctor, but as you know, "Eheu 
fugaces, Postume, Postume, labuntur anni,"' or 'Sal, Mr. So-and-so, 
my lassie is thriving well, but would it no' be more to the point 
to say, "O matra pulchra filia pulchrior"?' which astounded them 
very much if she managed to reach the end without being flung, but 
usually she had a fit of laughing in the middle, and so they found 
her out.
<P>
Biography and exploration were her favourite reading, for choice 
the biography of men who had been good to their mothers, and she 
liked the explorers to be alive so that she could shudder at the 
thought of their venturing forth again; but though she expressed a 
hope that they would have the sense to stay at home henceforth, she 
gleamed with admiration when they disappointed her.  In later days 
I had a friend who was an African explorer, and she was in two 
minds about him; he was one of the most engrossing of mortals to 
her, she admired him prodigiously, pictured him at the head of his 
caravan, now attacked by savages, now by wild beasts, and adored 
him for the uneasy hours he gave her, but she was also afraid that 
he wanted to take me with him, and then she thought he should be 
put down by law.  Explorers' mothers also interested her very much; 
the books might tell her nothing about them, but she could create 
them for herself and wring her hands in sympathy with them when 
they had got no news of him for six months.  Yet there were times 
when she grudged him to them - as the day when he returned 
victorious.  Then what was before her eyes was not the son coming 
marching home again but an old woman peering for him round the 
window curtain and trying not to look uplifted.  The newspaper 
reports would be about the son, but my mother's comment was 'She's 
a proud woman this night.'
<P>
We read many books together when I was a boy, 'Robinson Crusoe' 
being the first (and the second), and the 'Arabian Nights' should 
have been the next, for we got it out of the library (a penny for 
three days), but on discovering that they were nights when we had 
paid for knights we sent that volume packing, and I have curled my 
lips at it ever since.  'The Pilgrim's Progress' we had in the 
house (it was as common a possession as a dresser-head), and so 
enamoured of it was I that I turned our garden into sloughs of 
Despond, with pea-sticks to represent Christian on his travels and 
a buffet-stool for his burden, but when I dragged my mother out to 
see my handiwork she was scared, and I felt for days, with a 
certain elation, that I had been a dark character.  Besides reading 
every book we could hire or borrow I also bought one now and again, 
and while buying (it was the occupation of weeks) I read, standing 
at the counter, most of the other books in the shop, which is 
perhaps the most exquisite way of reading.  And I took in a 
magazine called 'Sunshine,' the most delicious periodical, I am 
sure, of any day.  It cost a halfpenny or a penny a month, and 
always, as I fondly remember, had a continued tale about the 
dearest girl, who sold water-cress, which is a dainty not grown and 
I suppose never seen in my native town.  This romantic little 
creature took such hold of my imagination that I cannot eat water-
cress even now without emotion.  I lay in bed wondering what she 
would be up to in the next number; I have lost trout because when 
they nibbled my mind was wandering with her; my early life was 
embittered by her not arriving regularly on the first of the month.  
I know not whether it was owing to her loitering on the way one 
month to an extent flesh and blood could not bear, or because we 
had exhausted the penny library, but on a day I conceived a 
glorious idea, or it was put into my head by my mother, then 
desirous of making progress with her new clouty hearthrug.  The 
notion was nothing short of this, why should I not write the tales 
myself?  I did write them - in the garret - but they by no means 
helped her to get on with her work, for when I finished a chapter I 
bounded downstairs to read it to her, and so short were the 
chapters, so ready was the pen, that I was back with new manuscript 
before another clout had been added to the rug.  Authorship seemed, 
like her bannock-baking, to consist of running between two points.  
They were all tales of adventure (happiest is he who writes of 
adventure), no characters were allowed within if I knew their like 
in the flesh, the scene lay in unknown parts, desert islands, 
enchanted gardens, with knights (none of your nights) on black 
chargers, and round the first corner a lady selling water-cress.
<P>
At twelve or thereabout I put the literary calling to bed for a 
time, having gone to a school where cricket and football were more 
esteemed, but during the year before I went to the university, it 
woke up and I wrote great part of a three-volume novel.  The 
publisher replied that the sum for which he would print it was a 
hundred and - however, that was not the important point (I had 
sixpence): where he stabbed us both was in writing that he 
considered me a 'clever lady.'  I replied stiffly that I was a 
gentleman, and since then I have kept that manuscript concealed.  I 
looked through it lately, and, oh, but it is dull!  I defy any one 
to read it.
<P>
The malignancy of publishers, however, could not turn me back.  
From the day on which I first tasted blood in the garret my mind 
was made up; there could be no hum-dreadful-drum profession for me; 
literature was my game.  It was not highly thought of by those who 
wished me well.  I remember being asked by two maiden ladies, about 
the time I left the university, what I was to be, and when I 
replied brazenly, 'An author,' they flung up their hands, and one 
exclaimed reproachfully, 'And you an M.A.!'  My mother's views at 
first were not dissimilar; for long she took mine jestingly as 
something I would grow out of, and afterwards they hurt her so that 
I tried to give them up.  To be a minister - that she thought was 
among the fairest prospects, but she was a very ambitious woman, 
and sometimes she would add, half scared at her appetite, that 
there were ministers who had become professors, 'but it was not 
canny to think of such things.'
<P>
I had one person only on my side, an old tailor, one of the fullest 
men I have known, and quite the best talker.  He was a bachelor (he 
told me all that is to be known about woman), a lean man, pallid of 
face, his legs drawn up when he walked as if he was ever carrying 
something in his lap; his walks were of the shortest, from the tea-
pot on the hob to the board on which he stitched, from the board to 
the hob, and so to bed.  He might have gone out had the idea struck 
him, but in the years I knew him, the last of his brave life, I 
think he was only in the open twice, when he 'flitted' - changed 
his room for another hard by.  I did not see him make these 
journeys, but I seem to see him now, and he is somewhat dizzy in 
the odd atmosphere; in one hand he carries a box-iron, he raises 
the other, wondering what this is on his head, it is a hat; a faint 
smell of singed cloth goes by with him.  This man had heard of my 
set of photographs of the poets and asked for a sight of them, 
which led to our first meeting.  I remember how he spread them out 
on his board, and after looking long at them, turned his gaze on me 
and said solemnly,
<P>
<P>
What can I do to be for ever known,
And make the age to come my own?
<P>
<P>
These lines of Cowley were new to me, but the sentiment was not 
new, and I marvelled how the old tailor could see through me so 
well.  So it was strange to me to discover presently that he had 
not been thinking of me at all, but of his own young days, when 
that couplet sang in his head, and he, too, had thirsted to set off 
for Grub Street, but was afraid, and while he hesitated old age 
came, and then Death, and found him grasping a box-iron.
<P>
I hurried home with the mouthful, but neighbours had dropped in, 
and this was for her ears only, so I drew her to the stair, and 
said imperiously,
<P>
<P>
What can I do to be for ever known,
And make the age to come my own?
<P>
<P>
It was an odd request for which to draw her from a tea-table, and 
she must have been surprised, but I think she did not laugh, and in 
after years she would repeat the lines fondly, with a flush on her 
soft face.  'That is the kind you would like to be yourself!' we 
would say in jest to her, and she would reply almost passionately, 
'No, but I would be windy of being his mother.'  It is possible 
that she could have been his mother had that other son lived, he 
might have managed it from sheer love of her, but for my part I can 
smile at one of those two figures on the stair now, having long 
given up the dream of being for ever known, and seeing myself more 
akin to my friend, the tailor, for as he was found at the end on 
his board, so I hope shall I be found at my handloom, doing 
honestly the work that suits me best.  Who should know so well as I 
that it is but a handloom compared to the great guns that 
reverberate through the age to come?  But she who stood with me on 
the stair that day was a very simple woman, accustomed all her life 
to making the most of small things, and I weaved sufficiently well 
to please her, which has been my only steadfast ambition since I 
was a little boy.
<P>
Not less than mine became her desire that I should have my way - 
but, ah, the iron seats in that park of horrible repute, and that 
bare room at the top of many flights of stairs!  While I was away 
at college she drained all available libraries for books about 
those who go to London to live by the pen, and they all told the 
same shuddering tale.  London, which she never saw, was to her a 
monster that licked up country youths as they stepped from the 
train; there were the garrets in which they sat abject, and the 
park seats where they passed the night.  Those park seats were the 
monster's glaring eyes to her, and as I go by them now she is 
nearer to me than when I am in any other part of London.  I daresay 
that when night comes, this Hyde Park which is so gay by day, is 
haunted by the ghosts of many mothers, who run, wild-eyed, from 
seat to seat, looking for their sons.
<P>
But if we could dodge those dreary seats she longed to see me try 
my luck, and I sought to exclude them from the picture by drawing 
maps of London with Hyde Park left out.  London was as strange to 
me as to her, but long before I was shot upon it I knew it by maps, 
and drew them more accurately than I could draw them now.  Many a 
time she and I took our jaunt together through the map, and were 
most gleeful, popping into telegraph offices to wire my father and 
sister that we should not be home till late, winking to my books in 
lordly shop-windows, lunching at restaurants (and remembering not 
to call it dinner), saying, 'How do?' to Mr. Alfred Tennyson when 
we passed him in Regent Street, calling at publishers' offices for 
cheque, when 'Will you take care of it, or shall I?' I asked gaily, 
and she would be certain to reply, 'I'm thinking we'd better take 
it to the bank and get the money,' for she always felt surer of 
money than of cheques; so to the bank we went ('Two tens, and the 
rest in gold'), and thence straightway (by cab) to the place where 
you buy sealskin coats for middling old ladies.  But ere the laugh 
was done the park would come through the map like a blot.
<P>
'If you could only be sure of as much as would keep body and soul 
together,' my mother would say with a sigh.
<P>
'With something over, mother, to send to you.'
<P>
'You couldna expect that at the start.'
<P>
The wench I should have been courting now was journalism, that 
grisette of literature who has a smile and a hand for all 
beginners, welcoming them at the threshold, teaching them so much 
that is worth knowing, introducing them to the other lady whom they 
have worshipped from afar, showing them even how to woo her, and 
then bidding them a bright God-speed - he were an ingrate who, 
having had her joyous companionship, no longer flings her a kiss as 
they pass.  But though she bears no ill-will when she is jilted, 
you must serve faithfully while you are hers, and you must seek her 
out and make much of her, and, until you can rely on her good-
nature (note this), not a word about the other lady.  When at last 
she took me in I grew so fond of her that I called her by the 
other's name, and even now I think at times that there was more fun 
in the little sister, but I began by wooing her with contributions 
that were all misfits.  In an old book I find columns of notes 
about works projected at this time, nearly all to consist of essays 
on deeply uninteresting subjects; the lightest was to be a volume 
on the older satirists, beginning with Skelton and Tom Nash - the 
half of that manuscript still lies in a dusty chest - the only 
story was about Mary Queen of Scots, who was also the subject of 
many unwritten papers.  Queen Mary seems to have been luring me to 
my undoing ever since I saw Holyrood, and I have a horrid fear that 
I may write that novel yet.  That anything could be written about 
my native place never struck me.  We had read somewhere that a 
novelist is better equipped than most of his trade if he knows 
himself and one woman, and my mother said, 'You know yourself, for 
everybody must know himself' (there never was a woman who knew less 
about herself than she), and she would add dolefully, 'But I doubt 
I'm the only woman you know well.'
<P>
'Then I must make you my heroine,' I said lightly.
<P>
'A gey auld-farrant-like heroine!' she said, and we both laughed at 
the notion - so little did we read the future.
<P>
Thus it is obvious what were my qualifications when I was rashly 
engaged as a leader-writer (it was my sister who saw the 
advertisement) on an English provincial paper.  At the moment I was 
as uplifted as the others, for the chance had come at last, with 
what we all regarded as a prodigious salary, but I was wanted in 
the beginning of the week, and it suddenly struck me that the 
leaders were the one thing I had always skipped.  Leaders!  How 
were they written? what were they about?  My mother was already 
sitting triumphant among my socks, and I durst not let her see me 
quaking.  I retired to ponder, and presently she came to me with 
the daily paper.  Which were the leaders? she wanted to know, so 
evidently I could get no help from her.  Had she any more 
newspapers?  I asked, and after rummaging, she produced a few with 
which her boxes had been lined.  Others, very dusty, came from 
beneath carpets, and lastly a sooty bundle was dragged down the 
chimney.  Surrounded by these I sat down, and studied how to become 
a journalist.
