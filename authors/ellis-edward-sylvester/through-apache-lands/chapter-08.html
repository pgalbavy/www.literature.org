<p>By this time Ned Chadmund was pretty well frightened. Corporal
Hugg had said enough to convince him that they were in the greatest
danger of the whole journey. The lieutenant drew his men close
together, and two of the most experienced scouts rode a short
distance in advance of the others, glancing from side to side,
and on the watch for the first signs of the approach of Indians.</p>

<p>The sides of the pass as already shown, were high and precipitous,
so that there was no possibility of escape except by going backward
or forward. Furthermore, the canyon, as it must have been at some
distant day, wound in and out in such a fashion that there were
many places where it was impossible to see more than a hundred
yards in front or rear. There was no conversation between the
soldiers, and even the corporal spoke in a lower tone to his young
friend.</p>

<p>"If anything <em>does</em> happen," he said, looking down in
the handsome upturned face, "I want you to behave yourself, Ned."</p>

<p>"Don't I always do it?"</p>

<p>"I should say not!" was the emphatic response. "Haven't I ordered
you to stay in the wagon, and then looked round to see you slipping
out while I was talking to you? But things are different now.
If you see anything unusual, or hear rifle balls whizzing about
you, don't go to poking your head out to see what the matter is."</p>

<p>"What shall I do, then?" asked the boy, who was really desirous
of following the directions of his friend.</p>

<p>"Just lie down in the bottom of the ambulance and wait till I
tell you to get up again. The sides are bullet-proof, and there
ain't any danger of your getting hurt there."</p>

<p>The afternoon was drawing to a close, and the high walls, rising
up on each side, so shut out the rays of the sun, that a somber
twilight gloom filled Devil's Pass; a deep, oppressive heaviness
was in the atmosphere, that seemed in keeping with the place which
had been the scene of so many tragedies, which was now entered
with more or less misgiving upon the part of the entire company.</p>

<p>"I'd make a journey of two hundred miles extra if there was any
way of gitting around this infernal place," said the lieutenant;
"but as there isn't, all we can do is to push ahead."</p>

<p>It was about half an hour after the warning words of the corporal
to the lad, and the eyes of the entire company were fixed upon
the lieutenant and his comrade, who were riding a short distance
in advance. All at once they were seen to rein up their horses
simultaneously, as if something in front had caught their attention.
As by a common impulse, the others did the same, and breathlessly
awaited the next signal. It came in a dozen seconds. While the
hunter and his mustang remained motionless, the lieutenant wheeled
his horse about, and rode back and the others noticed that his
face was pale and expressive of great alarm.</p>

<p>"I knew we shouldn't get through here without a fight. There's
a whole pack of Indians ahead of us. Jake, take a turn back a
short distance and see whether they have fixed it so as to shut
us in."</p>

<p>The man addressed turned to do as ordered, while the others anxiously
awaited his report. He was another Indian fighter, who knew precisely
what to do, and he was gone but a short time when he came thundering
back, calling out the instant he came in view around a curve in
the pass:</p>

<p>"We're in for the biggest scrimmage of our lives! There's five
hundred Apaches coming up the pass, and they'll be here inside
of ten minutes."</p>

<p>The man who made this terrifying announcement was not one given
to exaggeration, and, although he might have overestimated the
number in this case, every one of his hearers knew that an overwhelming
force was in their rear, and, whatever they did to save themselves,
the last thing to be thought of was to turn back.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the news been announced when the scout from the
other direction galloped back.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Some of the redskins are ahead of us, that's certain."</p>

<p>"What tribe?"</p>

<p>"The Jiccarilla Apaches, I think; the worst set of scamps this
side of the Llano Estacado."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"I can't make out more than a dozen, and there may be less."</p>

<p>A hasty consultation was held, and all agreed that the appearance
of these few Indians in front was for the purpose of turning the
party back upon the main force in the rear. Consequently, the
proper course was to charge ahead, fighting their way, if necessary,
through those before them, and keeping all the distance possible
between themselves and the war party coming down from the opposite
direction. Only a few seconds were necessary to form this decision,
and the cavalry started at a gallop down the pass, Corporal Hugg
lashing his powerful steed into a much more rapid pace than he
was accustomed to, or was agreeable to him.</p>

<p>"Now, Ned, keep your head down," said the wooden-legged soldier
to the boy. "The bullets will soon be buzzing all around us."</p>

<p>As he spoke he stretched out on the flat bottom of the ambulance,
allowing his head to be elevated just enough to permit him to
peer over the foreboard and guide the horse, which was now forced
into a furious gallop. Earnest in his desire to obey, Ned Chadmund
did the same, awaiting the result of this desperate attempt to
escape from a most perilous position.</p>

<p>The bottom of the pass was quite level and hard, but the ambulance
bounded and leaped from side to side in a way that threatened
to overturn it, and made anything like connected conversation
impossible. The speed of the party was about the same, the horsemen
retaining their position a short distance in advance of the vehicle
and all nerved to the fiery charge they believed to be inevitable.
The lad, still lying flat on his face in the bottom of the ambulance,
raised his head just enough to peer over the shoulder of the corporal
at the galloping horse and the figures of the cavalry beyond.</p>

<p>Suddenly the reports of a score of rifles sounded in the pass,
and the horrified lad saw fully one half of the soldiers topple
out of their saddles, riddled by the balls that had been fired
from a skillfully arranged ambush. At the same time several horses
reared, plunged and fell, fatally wounded by others of the missiles.</p>

<p>"Down!" shouted the corporal to Ned, who, in the excitement of
the moment, had placed his hands upon the shoulders of his friend
and risen to his knees. "Down, I say! Don't you see that they
are firing at us?"</p>

<p>The rattling sound of the returning fire of the cavalry was heard,
each man being armed with a rifle, and the corporal rose to his
knees and lashed the galloping horse to a still greater speed.</p>

<p>Instead of a dozen Apaches, fully a hundred came swarming toward
the little band of soldiers, the painted warriors seeming to spring,
like the dragon's teeth of old, from the very ground. Hemmed in
on every hand, the cavalry, throwing away their rifles, which
were useless in such an emergency, and drawing their revolvers,
charged straight through the yelling horde closing in around them.
Fascinated by the terrible scene and scarcely conscious of what
he was doing, Ned crawled forward again and stared out from the
front of the ambulance, while the corporal added his voice to
the terrible din by shouting to his horse, which was plunging
forward at a rate that threatened to overturn completely the bounding
vehicle.</p>

<p>The horsemen that were left were comparatively few and they fought
like Spartans; but Ned saw them drop one by one from their animals,
until there was only the lieutenant left, and he, poor fellow,
was lying upon his steed, both badly wounded, as they strove with
the madness of desperation to escape. But it was useless. The
Apaches were all around them, pouring in their shots with such
precision that a moment later the dying horse sank heavily to
the ground and the wretches that dashed forward to slay his rider
found that he was already dead.</p>

<p>Corporal Hugg saw all this as a huge warrior dashed forward and
seized the rein of his own horse; but the next instant he dropped
to the earth, was trampled upon by the iron hoofs and run over
in a twinkling. Still the Indians swarmed in around and ahead
of the team, against which all the avenues of escape seemed hopelessly
closed.</p>
