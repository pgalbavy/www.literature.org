TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set upon by a Robber.  The
one fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself
with his stout right hand.  The Robber being slain, the timid
companion ran up and drew his sword, and then, throwing back his
traveling cloak said, "I'll at him, and I'll take care he shall
learn whom he has attacked."  On this, he who had fought with the
Robber made answer, "I only wish that you had helped me just now,
even if it had been only with those words, for I should have been
the more encouraged, believing them to be true; but now put up
your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue,
till you can deceive others who do not know you.  I, indeed, who
have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well
that no dependence can be placed on your valor."
