<p>THE year that followed was the saddest Christie had ever known,
for she suffered a sort of poverty which is more difficult to bear
than actual want, since money cannot lighten it, and the rarest
charity alone can minister to it. Her heart was empty and she could
not fill it; her soul was hungry and she could not feed it; life was
cold and dark and she could not warm and brighten it, for she knew
not where to go.</p>

<p>She tried to help herself by all the means in her power, and when
effort after effort failed she said: &quot;I am not good enough yet to
deserve happiness. I think too much of human love, too little of
divine. When I have made God my friend perhaps He will let me find
and keep one heart to make life happy with. How shall I know God?
Who will tell me where to find Him, and help me to love and lean
upon Him as I ought?&quot;</p>

<p>In all sincerity she asked these questions, in all sincerity she
began her search, and with pathetic patience waited for an answer.
She read many books, some wise, some vague, some full of
superstition, all unsatisfactory to one who wanted a living God. She
went to many churches, studied many creeds, and watched their fruits
as well as she could; but still remained unsatisfied. Some were cold
and narrow, some seemed theatrical and superficial, some stern and
terrible, none simple, sweet, and strong enough for humanity's many
needs. There was too much machinery, too many walls, laws, and
penalties between the Father and His children. Too much fear, too
little love; too many saints and intercessors; too little faith in
the instincts of the soul which turns to God as flowers to the sun.
Too much idle strife about names and creeds; too little knowledge of
the natural religion which has no name but godliness, whose creed is
boundless and benignant as the sunshine, whose faith is as the
tender trust of little children in their mother's love.</p>

<p>Nowhere did Christie find this all-sustaining power, this paternal
friend, and comforter, and after months of patient searching she
gave up her quest, saying, despondently:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid I never shall get religion, for all that's offered me
seems so poor, so narrow, or so hard that I cannot take it for my
stay. A God of wrath I cannot love; a God that must be propitiated,
adorned, and adored like an idol I cannot respect; and a God who can
be blinded to men's iniquities through the week by a little beating
of the breast and bowing down on the seventh day, I cannot serve. I
want a Father to whom I can go with all my sins and sorrows, all my
hopes and joys, as freely and fearlessly as I used to go to my human
father, sure of help and sympathy and love. Shall I ever find Him?&quot;</p>

<p>Alas, poor Christie! she was going through the sorrowful perplexity
that comes to so many before they learn that religion cannot be
given or bought, but must grow as trees grow, needing frost and
snow, rain and wind to strengthen it before it is deep-rooted in the
soul; that God is in the hearts of all, and they that seek shall
surely find Him when they need Him most.</p>

<p>So Christie waited for religion to reveal itself to her, and while
she waited worked with an almost desperate industry, trying to buy a
little happiness for herself by giving a part of her earnings to
those whose needs money could supply. She clung to her little room,
for there she could live her own life undisturbed, and preferred to
stint herself in other ways rather than give up this liberty. Day
after day she sat there sewing health of mind and body into the long
seams or dainty stitching that passed through her busy hands, and
while she sewed she thought sad, bitter, oftentimes rebellious
thoughts.</p>

<p>It was the worst life she could have led just then, for, deprived of
the active, cheerful influences she most needed, her mind preyed on
itself, slowly and surely, preparing her for the dark experience to
come. She knew that there was fitter work for her somewhere, but how
to find it was a problem which wiser women have often failed to
solve. She was no pauper, yet was one of those whom poverty sets at
odds with the world, for favors burden and dependence makes the
bread bitter unless love brightens the one and sweetens the other.</p>

<p>There are many Christies, willing to work, yet unable to bear the
contact with coarser natures which makes labor seem degrading, or to
endure the hard struggle for the bare necessities of life when life
has lost all that makes it beautiful. People wonder when such as she
say they can find little to do; but to those who know nothing of the
pangs of pride, the sacrifices of feeling, the martyrdoms of youth,
love, hope, and ambition that go on under the faded cloaks of these
poor gentle-women, who tell them to go into factories, or scrub in
kitchens, for there is work enough for all, the most convincing
answer would be, &quot;Try it.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie kept up bravely till a wearisome low fever broke both
strength and spirit, and brought the weight of debt upon her when
least fitted to bear or cast it off. For the first time she began to
feel that she had nerves which would rebel, and a heart that could
not long endure isolation from its kind without losing the cheerful
courage which hitherto had been her staunchest friend. Perfect rest,
kind care, and genial society were the medicines she needed, but
there was no one to minister to her, and she went blindly on along
the road so many women tread.</p>

<p>She left her bed too soon, fearing to ask too much of the busy
people who had done their best to be neighborly. She returned to her
work when it felt heavy in her feeble hands, for debt made idleness
seem wicked to her conscientious mind. And, worst of all, she fell
back into the bitter, brooding mood which had become habitual to her
since she lived alone. While the tired hands slowly worked, the
weary brain ached and burned with heavy thoughts, vain longings, and
feverish fancies, till things about her sometimes seemed as strange
and spectral as the phantoms that had haunted her half-delirious
sleep. Inexpressibly wretched were the dreary days, the restless
nights, with only pain and labor for companions. The world looked
very dark to her, life seemed an utter failure, God a delusion, and
the long, lonely years before her too hard to be endured.</p>

<p>It is not always want, insanity, or sin that drives women to
desperate deaths; often it is a dreadful loneliness of heart, a
hunger for home and friends, worse than starvation, a bitter sense
of wrong in being denied the tender ties, the pleasant duties, the
sweet rewards that can make the humblest life happy; a rebellious
protest against God, who, when they cry for bread, seems to offer
them a stone. Some of these impatient souls throw life away, and
learn too late how rich it might have been with a stronger faith, a
more submissive spirit. Others are kept, and slowly taught to stand
and wait, till blest with a happiness the sweeter for the doubt that
went before.</p>

<p>There came a time to Christie when the mist about her was so thick
she would have stumbled and fallen had not the little candle, kept
alight by her own hand, showed her how far &quot;a good deed shines in a
naughty world;&quot; and when God seemed utterly forgetful of her He sent
a friend to save and comfort her.</p>

<p>March winds were whistling among the house-tops, and the sky was
darkening with a rainy twilight as Christie folded up her finished
work, stretched her weary limbs, and made ready for her daily walk.
Even this was turned to profit, for then she took home her work,
went in search of more, and did her own small marketing. As late
hours and unhealthy labor destroyed appetite, and unpaid debts made
each mouthful difficult to swallow with Mrs. Flint's hard eye upon
her, she had undertaken to supply her own food, and so lessen the
obligation that burdened her. An unwise retrenchment, for, busied
with the tasks that must be done, she too often neglected or
deferred the meals to which no society lent interest, no appetite
gave flavor; and when the fuel was withheld the fire began to die
out spark by spark.</p>

<p>As she stood before the little mirror, smoothing the hair upon her
forehead, she watched the face reflected there, wondering if it
could be the same she used to see so full of youth and hope and
energy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm growing old; my youth is nearly over, and at thirty I
shall be a faded, dreary woman, like so many I see and pity. It's
hard to come to this after trying so long to find my place, and do
my duty. I'm a failure after all, and might as well have stayed with
Aunt Betsey or married Joe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Devon, to-day is Saturday, and I'm makin' up my bills, so I'll
trouble you for your month's board, and as much on the old account
as you can let me have.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint spoke, and her sharp voice rasped the silence like a
file, for she had entered without knocking, and her demand was the
first intimation of her presence.</p>

<p>Christie turned slowly round, for there was no elasticity in her
motions now; through the melancholy anxiety her face always wore of
late, there came the worried look of one driven almost beyond
endurance, and her hands began to tremble nervously as she tied on
her bonnet. Mrs. Flint was a hard woman, and dunned her debtors
relentlessly; Christie dreaded the sight of her, and would have left
the house had she been free of debt.</p>

<p>&quot;I am just going to take these things home and get more work. I am
sure of being paid, and you shall have all I get. But, for Heaven's
sake, give me time.&quot;</p>

<p>Two days and a night of almost uninterrupted labor had given a
severe strain to her nerves, and left her in a dangerous state.
Something in her face arrested Mrs. Flint's attention; she observed
that Christie was putting on her best cloak and hat, and to her
suspicious eye the bundle of work looked unduly large.</p>

<p>It had been a hard day for the poor woman, for the cook had gone off
in a huff; the chamber girl been detected in petty larceny; two
desirable boarders had disappointed her; and the incapable husband
had fallen ill, so it was little wonder that her soul was tried, her
sharp voice sharper, and her sour temper sourer than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard of folks putting on their best things and going out,
but never coming back again, when they owed money. It's a mean
trick, but it's sometimes done by them you wouldn't think it of,&quot;
she said, with an aggravating sniff of intelligence.</p>

<p>To be suspected of dishonesty was the last drop in Christie's full
cup. She looked at the woman with a strong desire to do something
violent, for every nerve was tingling with irritation and anger. But
she controlled herself, though her face was colorless and her hands
were more tremulous than before. Unfastening her comfortable cloak
she replaced it with a shabby shawl; took off her neat bonnet and
put on a hood, unfolded six linen shirts, and shook them out before
her landlady's eyes; then retied the parcel, and, pausing on the
threshold of the door, looked back with an expression that haunted
the woman long afterward, as she said, with the quiver of strong
excitement in her voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Flint, I have always dealt honorably by you; I always mean to
do it, and don't deserve to be suspected of dishonesty like that. I
leave every thing I own behind me, and if I don't come back, you can
sell them all and pay yourself, for I feel now as if I never wanted
to see you or this room again.&quot;</p>

<p>Then she went rapidly away, supported by her indignation, for she
had done her best to pay her debts; had sold the few trinkets she
possessed, and several treasures given by the Carrols, to settle her
doctor's bill, and had been half killing herself to satisfy Mrs.
Flint's demands. The consciousness that she had been too lavish in
her generosity when fortune smiled upon her, made the present want
all the harder to bear. But she would neither beg nor borrow, though
she knew Harry would delight to give, and Uncle Enos lend her money,
with a lecture on extravagance, gratis.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll paddle my own canoe as long as I can,&quot; she said, sternly; &quot;and
when I must ask help I'll turn to strangers for it, or scuttle my
boat, and go down without troubling any one.&quot;</p>

<p>When she came to her employer's door, the servant said: &quot;Missis was
out;&quot; then seeing Christie's disappointed face, she added,
confidentially:</p>

<p>&quot;If it's any comfort to know it, I can tell you that missis wouldn't
have paid you if she had a been to home. There's been three other
women here with work, and she's put 'em all off. She always does,
and beats 'em down into the bargain, which ain't genteel to my
thinkin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She promised me I should be well paid for these, because I
undertook to get them done without fail. I've worked day and night
rather than disappoint her, and felt sure of my money,&quot; said
Christie, despondently.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but you won't get it. She told me to tell you your
prices was too high, and she could find folks to work cheaper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did not object to the price when I took the work, and I have
half-ruined my eyes over the fine stitching. See if it isn't nicely
done.&quot; And Christie displayed her exquisite needlework with pride.</p>

<p>The girl admired it, and, having a grievance of her own, took
satisfaction in berating her mistress.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a shame! These things are part of a present, the ladies are
going to give the minister; but I don't believe he'll feel easy in
'em if poor folks is wronged to get 'em. Missis won't pay what they
are worth, I know; for, don't you see, the cheaper the work is done,
the more money she has to make a spread with her share of the
present? It's my opinion you'd better hold on to these shirts till
she pays for 'em handsome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I'll keep my promise, and I hope she will keep hers. Tell her I
need the money very much, and have worked very hard to please her.
I'll come again on Monday, if I'm able.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie's lips trembled as she spoke, for she was feeble still, and
the thought of that hard-earned money had been her sustaining hope
through the weary hours spent over that ill-paid work. The girl said
&quot;Good-bye,&quot; with a look of mingled pity and respect, for in her eyes
the seamstress was more of a lady than the mistress in this
transaction.</p>

<p>Christie hurried to another place, and asked eagerly if the young
ladies had any work for her. &quot;Not a stitch,&quot; was the reply, and the
door closed. She stood a moment looking down upon the passers-by
wondering what answer she would get if she accosted any one; and had
any especially benevolent face looked back at her she would have
been tempted to do it, so heart-sick and forlorn did she feel just
then.</p>

<p>She knocked at several other doors, to receive the same reply. She
even tried a slop-shop, but it was full, and her pale face was
against her. Her long illness had lost her many patrons, and if one
steps out from the ranks of needle-women, it is very hard to press
in again, so crowded are they, and so desperate the need of money.</p>

<p>One hope remained, and, though the way was long, and a foggy drizzle
had set in, she minded neither distance nor the chilly rain, but
hurried away with anxious thoughts still dogging her steps. Across a
long bridge, through muddy roads and up a stately avenue she went,
pausing, at last, spent and breathless at another door.</p>

<p>A servant with a wedding-favor in his button-hole opened to her,
and, while he went to deliver her urgent message, she peered in
wistfully from the dreary world without, catching glimpses of
home-love and happiness that made her heart ache for very pity of
its own loneliness. A wedding was evidently afoot, for hall and
staircase blazed with light and bloomed with flowers. Smiling men
and maids ran to and fro; opening doors showed tables beautiful with
bridal white and silver; savory odors filled the air; gay voices
echoed above and below; and once she caught a brief glance at the
bonny bride, standing with her father's arm about her, while her
mother gave some last, loving touch to her array; and a group of
young sisters with April faces clustered round her.</p>

<p>The pretty picture vanished all too soon; the man returned with a
hurried &quot;No&quot; for answer, and Christie went out into the deepening
twilight with a strange sense of desperation at her heart. It was
not the refusal, not the fear of want, nor the reaction of overtaxed
nerves alone; it was the sharpness of the contrast between that
other woman's fate and her own that made her wring her hands
together, and cry out, bitterly:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it isn't fair, it isn't right, that she should have so much and
I so little! What have I ever done to be so desolate and miserable,
and never to find any happiness, however hard I try to do what seems
my duty?&quot;</p>

<p>There was no answer, and she went slowly down the long avenue,
feeling that there was no cause for hurry now, and even night and
rain and wind were better than her lonely room or Mrs. Flint's
complaints. Afar off the city lights shone faintly through the fog,
like pale lamps seen in dreams; the damp air cooled her feverish
cheeks; the road was dark and still, and she longed to lie down and
rest among the sodden leaves.</p>

<p>When she reached the bridge she saw the draw was up, and a spectral
ship was slowly passing through. With no desire to mingle in the
crowd that waited on either side, she paused, and, leaning on the
railing, let her thoughts wander where they would. As she stood
there the heavy air seemed to clog her breath and wrap her in its
chilly arms. She felt as if the springs of life were running down,
and presently would stop; for, even when the old question, &quot;What
shall I do?&quot; came haunting her, she no longer cared even to try to
answer it, and had no feeling but one of utter weariness. She tried
to shake off the strange mood that was stealing over her, but spent
body and spent brain were not strong enough to obey her will, and,
in spite of her efforts to control it, the impulse that had seized
her grew more intense each moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I work and suffer any longer for myself alone?&quot; she
thought; &quot;why wear out my life struggling for the bread I have no
heart to eat? I am not wise enough to find my place, nor patient
enough to wait until it comes to me. Better give up trying, and
leave room for those who have something to live for.&quot;</p>

<p>Many a stronger soul has known a dark hour when the importunate wish
has risen that it were possible and right to lay down the burdens
that oppress, the perplexities that harass, and hasten the coming of
the long sleep that needs no lullaby. Such an hour was this to
Christie, for, as she stood there, that sorrowful bewilderment which
we call despair came over her, and ruled her with a power she could
not resist.</p>

<p>A flight of steps close by led to a lumber wharf, and, scarcely
knowing why, she went down there, with a vague desire to sit still
somewhere, and think her way out of the mist that seemed to obscure
her mind. A single tall lamp shone at the farther end of the
platform, and presently she found herself leaning her hot forehead
against the iron pillar, while she watched with curious interest the
black water rolling sluggishly below.</p>

<p>She knew it was no place for her, yet no one waited for her, no one
would care if she staid for ever, and, yielding to the perilous
fascination that drew her there, she lingered with a heavy throbbing
in her temples, and a troop of wild fancies whirling through her
brain. Something white swept by below, - only a broken oar - but she
began to wonder how a human body would look floating through the
night. It was an awesome fancy, but it took possession of her, and,
as it grew, her eyes dilated, her breath came fast, and her lips
fell apart, for she seemed to see the phantom she had conjured up,
and it wore the likeness of herself.</p>

<p>With an ominous chill creeping through her blood, and a growing
tumult in her mind, she thought, &quot;I must go,&quot; but still stood
motionless, leaning over the wide gulf, eager to see where that dead
thing would pass away. So plainly did she see it, so peaceful was
the white face, so full of rest the folded hands, so strangely like,
and yet unlike, herself, that she seemed to lose her identity, and
wondered which was the real and which the imaginary Christie. Lower
and lower she bent; looser and looser grew her hold upon the pillar;
faster and faster beat the pulses in her temples, and the rush of
some blind impulse was swiftly coming on, when a hand seized and
caught her back.</p>

<p>For an instant every thing grew black before her eyes, and the earth
seemed to slip away from underneath her feet. Then she was herself
again, and found that she was sitting on a pile of lumber, with her
head uncovered, and a woman's arm about her.</p>

<p>THE RESCUE.</p>

<p>&quot;Was I going to drown myself?&quot; she asked, slowly, with a fancy that
she had been dreaming frightfully, and some one had wakened her.</p>

<p>&quot;You were most gone; but I came in time, thank God! O Christie!
don't you know me?&quot;</p>

<p>Ah! no fear of that; for with one bewildered look, one glad cry of
recognition, Christie found her friend again, and was gathered close
to Rachel's heart.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, my dear, what drove you to it? Tell me all, and let me
help you in your trouble, as you helped me in mine,&quot; she said, as
she tenderly laid the poor, white face upon her breast, and wrapped
her shawl about the trembling figure clinging to her with such
passionate delight.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been ill; I worked too hard; I'm not myself to-night. I owe
money. People disappoint and worry me; and I was so worn out, and
weak, and wicked, I think I meant to take my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear; it was not you that meant to do it, but the weakness and
the trouble that bewildered you. Forget it all, and rest a little,
safe with me; then we'll talk again.&quot;</p>

<p>Rachel spoke soothingly, for Christie shivered and sighed as if her
own thoughts frightened her. For a moment they sat silent, while the
mist trailed its white shroud above them, as if death had paused to
beckon a tired child away, but, finding her so gently cradled on a
warm, human heart, had relented and passed on, leaving no waif but
the broken oar for the river to carry toward the sea.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me about yourself, Rachel. Where have you been so long? I 've
looked and waited for you ever since the second little note you sent
me on last Christinas; but you never came.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been away, dear heart, hard at work in another city, larger
and wickeder than this. I tried to get work here, that I might be
near you; but that cruel Cotton always found me out; and I was so
afraid I should get desperate that I went away where I was not
known. There it came into my mind to do for others more wretched
than I what you had done for me. God put the thought into my heart,
and He helped me in my work, for it has prospered wonderfully. All
this year I have been busy with it, and almost happy; for I felt
that your love made me strong to do it, and that, in time, I might
grow good enough to be your friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See what I am, Rachel, and never say that any more!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, my poor dear, and let me talk. You are not able to do any
thing, but rest, and listen. I knew how many poor souls went wrong
when the devil tempted them; and I gave all my strength to saving
those who were going the way I went. I had no fear, no shame to
overcome, for I was one of them. They would listen to me, for I knew
what I spoke; they could believe in salvation, for I was saved; they
did not feel so outcast and forlorn when I told them you had taken
me into your innocent arms, and loved me like a sister. With every
one I helped my power increased, and I felt as if I had washed away
a little of my own great sin. O Christie! never think it's time to
die till you are called; for the Lord leaves us till we have done
our work, and never sends more sin and sorrow than we can bear and
be the better for, if we hold fast by Him.&quot;</p>

<p>So beautiful and brave she looked, so full of strength and yet of
meek submission was her voice, that Christie's heart was thrilled;
for it was plain that Rachel had learned how to distil balm from the
bitterness of life, and, groping in the mire to save lost souls, had
found her own salvation there.</p>

<p>&quot;Show me how to grow pious, strong, and useful, as you are,&quot; she
said. &quot;I am all wrong, and feel as if I never could get right again,
for I haven't energy enough to care what becomes of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know the state, Christie: I've been through it all! but when I
stood where you stand now, there was no hand to pull me back, and I
fell into a blacker river than this underneath our feet. Thank God,
I came in time to save you from either death!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you find me?&quot; asked Christie, when she had echoed in her
heart the thanksgiving that came with such fervor from the other's
lips.</p>

<p>&quot;I passed you on the bridge. I did not see your face, but you stood
leaning there so wearily, and looking down into the water, as I used
to look, that I wanted to speak, but did not; and I went on to
comfort a poor girl who is dying yonder. Something turned me back,
however; and when I saw you down here I knew why I was sent. You
were almost gone, but I kept you; and when I had you in my arms I
knew you, though it nearly broke my heart to find you here. Now,
dear, come home.</p>

<p>&quot;Home! ah, Rachel, I've got no home, and for want of one I shall be
lost!&quot;</p>

<p>The lament that broke from her was more pathetic than the tears that
streamed down, hot and heavy, melting from her heart the frost of
her despair. Her friend let her weep, knowing well the worth of
tears, and while Christie sobbed herself quiet, Rachel took thought
for her as tenderly as any mother.</p>

<p>When she had heard the story of Christie's troubles, she stood up as
if inspired with a happy thought, and stretching both hands to her
friend, said, with an air of cheerful assurance most comforting to
see:</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take care of you; come with me, my poor Christie, and I'll
give you a home, very humble, but honest and happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With you, Rachel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, I must go back to my work, and you are not fit for that.
Neither must you go again to your own room, because for you it is
haunted, and the worst place you could be in. You want change, and
I'll give you one. It will seem queer at first, but it is a
wholesome place, and just what you need.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do any thing you tell me. I'm past thinking for myself
to-night, and only want to be taken care of till I find strength and
courage enough to stand alone,&quot; said Christie, rising slowly and
looking about her with an aspect as helpless and hopeless as if the
cloud of mist was a wall of iron.</p>

<p>Rachel put on her bonnet for her and wrapped her shawl about her,
saying, in a tender voice, that warmed the other's heart:</p>

<p>&quot;Close by lives a dear, good woman who often befriends such as you
and I. She will take you in without a question, and love to do it,
for she is the most hospitable soul I know. Just tell her you want
work, that I sent you, and there will be no trouble. Then, when you
know her a little, confide in her, and you will never come to such a
pass as this again. Keep up your heart, dear; I'll not leave you
till you are safe.&quot;</p>

<p>So cheerily she spoke, so confident she looked, that the lost
expression passed from Christie's face, and hand in hand they went
away together, - two types of the sad sisterhood standing on either
shore of the dark river that is spanned by a Bridge of Sighs.</p>

<p>Rachel led her friend toward the city, and, coming to the mechanics'
quarter, stopped before the door of a small, old house.</p>

<p>&quot;Just knock, say 'Rachel sent me,' and you'll find yourself at
home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stay with me, or let me go with you. I can't lose you again, for I
need you very much,&quot; pleaded Christie, clinging to her friend.</p>

<p>&quot;Not so much as that poor girl dying all alone. She's waiting for
me, and I must go. But I'll write soon; and remember, Christie, I
shall feel as if I had only paid a very little of my debt if you go
back to the sad old life, and lose your faith and hope again. God
bless and keep you, and when we meet next time let me find a happier
face than this.&quot;</p>

<p>Rachel kissed it with her heart on her lips, smiled her brave sweet
smile, and vanished in the mist.</p>

<p>Pausing a moment to collect herself, Christie recollected that she
had not asked the name of the new friend whose help she was about to
ask. A little sign on the door caught her eye, and, bending down,
she managed to read by the dim light of the street lamp these words:</p>

<p>&quot;C. WILKINS, Clear-Starcher.
&quot;Laces done up in the best style.&quot;</p>

<p>Too tired to care whether a laundress or a lady took her in, she
knocked timidly, and, while she waited for an answer to her summons,
stood listening to the noises within.</p>

<p>A swashing sound as of water was audible, likewise a scuffling as of
flying feet; some one clapped hands, and a voice said, warningly,
&quot;Into your beds this instant minute or I'll come to you! Andrew
Jackson, give Gusty a boost; Ann Lizy, don't you tech Wash's feet to
tickle 'em. Set pretty in the tub, Victory, dear, while ma sees
who's rappin'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;C. WILKINS, CLEAR STARCHER.&quot;</p>

<p>Then heavy footsteps approached, the door opened wide, and a large
woman appeared, with fuzzy red hair, no front teeth, and a plump,
clean face, brightly illuminated by the lamp she carried.</p>

<p>&quot;If you please, Rachel sent me. She thought you might be able&quot; - </p>

<p>Christie got no further, for C. Wilkins put out a strong bare arm,
still damp, and gently drew her in, saying, with the same motherly
tone as when addressing her children, &quot;Come right in, dear, and
don't mind the clutter things is in. I'm givin' the children their
Sat'day scrubbin', and they will slop and kite 'round, no matter ef
I do spank 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>Talking all the way in such an easy, comfortable voice that Christie
felt as if she must have heard it before, Mrs. Wilkins led her
unexpected guest into a small kitchen, smelling suggestively of
soap-suds and warm flat-irons. In the middle of this apartment was a
large tub; in the tub a chubby child sat, sucking a sponge and
staring calmly at the new-comer with a pair of big blue eyes, while
little drops shone in the yellow curls and on the rosy shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;How pretty!&quot; cried Christie, seeing nothing else and stopping short
to admire this innocent little Venus rising from the sea.</p>

<p>&quot;So she is! Ma's darlin' lamb! and ketehin' her death a cold this
blessed minnit. Set right down, my dear, and tuck your wet feet into
the oven. I'll have a dish o' tea for you in less 'n no time; and
while it's drawin' I'll clap Victory Adelaide into her bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie sank into a shabby but most hospitable old chair, dropped
her bonnet on the floor, put her feet in the oven, and, leaning
back, watched Mrs. Wilkins wipe the baby as if she had come for that
especial purpose. As Rachel predicted, she found herself, at home at
once, and presently was startled to hear a laugh from her own lips
when several children in red and yellow flannel night-gowns darted
like meteors across the open doorway of an adjoining room, with
whoops and howls, bursts of laughter, and antics of all sorts.</p>

<p>How pleasant it was; that plain room, with no ornaments but the
happy faces, no elegance, but cleanliness, no wealth, but
hospitality and lots of love. This latter blessing gave the place
its charm, for, though Mrs. Wilkins threatened to take her infants'
noses off if they got out of bed again, or &quot;put 'em in the kettle
and bile 'em&quot; they evidently knew no fear, but gambolled all the
nearer to her for the threat; and she beamed upon them with such
maternal tenderness and pride that her homely face grew beautiful in
Christie's eyes.</p>

<p>When the baby was bundled up in a blanket and about to be set down
before the stove to simmer a trifle before being put to bed,
Christie held out her arms, saying with an irresistible longing in
her eyes and voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Let me hold her! I love babies dearly, and it seems as if it would
do me more good than quarts of tea to cuddle her, if she'll let me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There now, that's real sensible; and mother's bird'll set along
with you as good as a kitten. Toast her tootsies wal, for she's
croupy, and I have to be extra choice of her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How good it feels!&quot; sighed Christie, half devouring the warm and
rosy little bunch in her lap, while baby lay back luxuriously,
spreading her pink toes to the pleasant warmth and smiling sleepily
up in the hungry face that hung over her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilkins's quick eyes saw it all, and she said to herself, in
the closet, as she cut bread and rattled down a cup and saucer:</p>

<p>&quot;That's what she wants, poor creeter; I'll let her have a right nice
time, and warm and feed and chirk her up, and then I'll see what's
to be done for her. She ain't one of the common sort, and goodness
only knows what Rachel sent her here for. She's poor and sick, but
she ain't bad. I can tell that by her face, and she's the sort I
like to help. It's a mercy I ain't eat my supper, so she can have
that bit of meat and the pie.&quot;</p>

<p>Putting a tray on the little table, the good soul set forth all she
had to give, and offered it with such hospitable warmth that
Christie ate and drank with unaccustomed appetite, finishing off
deliciously with a kiss from baby before she was borne away by her
mother to the back bedroom, where peace soon reigned.</p>

<p>&quot;Now let me tell you who I am, and how I came to you in such an
unceremonious way,&quot; began Christie, when her hostess returned and
found her warmed, refreshed, and composed by a woman's three best
comforters, - kind words, a baby, and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>&quot;'Pears to me, dear, I wouldn't rile myself up by telling any
werryments to-night, but git right warm inter bed, and have a good
long sleep,&quot; said Mrs. Wilkins, without a ray of curiosity in her
wholesome red face.</p>

<p>&quot;But you don't know any thing about me, and I may be the worst woman
in the world,&quot; cried Christie, anxious to prove herself worthy of
such confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;I know that you want takin' care of, child, or Rachel wouldn't a
sent you. Ef I can help any one, I don't want no introduction; and
ef you be the wust woman in the world (which you ain't), I wouldn't
shet my door on you, for then you'd need a lift more'n you do now.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie could only put out her hand, and mutely thank her new
friend with full eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;You're fairly tuckered out, you poor soul, so you jest come right
up chamber and let me tuck you up, else you'll be down sick. It
ain't a mite of inconvenience; the room is kep for company, and it's
all ready, even to a clean night-cap. I'm goin' to clap this warm
flat to your feet when you're fixed; it's amazin' comfortin' and
keeps your head cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Up they went to a tidy little chamber, and Christie found herself
laid down to rest none too soon, for she was quite worn out. Sleep
began to steal over her the moment her head touched the pillow, in
spite of the much beruffled cap which Mrs. Wilkins put on with
visible pride in its stiffly crimped borders. She was dimly
conscious of a kind hand tucking her up, a comfortable voice purring
over her, and, best of all, a motherly good-night kiss, then the
weary world faded quite away and she was at rest.</p>
