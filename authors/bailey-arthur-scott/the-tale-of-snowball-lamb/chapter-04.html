<p>After Snowball's trip to the village old dog Spot scarcely stirred from
the farmyard. He left the woodchucks to scurry about the pasture as they
pleased. For he felt that he ought to keep an eye on Snowball.
</p>
<p>The very next time that Snowball started to follow Johnnie Green out of
the yard Spot ran up to him and barked at his heels. "Go back!" Spot
growled. "Don't you dare leave this yard!"
</p><p>And then, to Spot's surprise, Johnnie Green picked up a stick and
threatened him with it.
</p><p>"You let my lamb alone!" Johnnie cried. That was bad enough, according
to old dog Spot's notion. But when Johnnie shouted, "Get out!" at him,
that was worse.
</p><p>Spot tucked his tail between his legs and slunk away, to hide himself
under the woodshed. And there he stayed for the rest of the morning and
sulked.
</p><p>But in the afternoon he began to feel more cheerful. For Spot had heard
Mrs. Green remark that school began the next day.
</p><p>That was good news. At least Spot so thought it.
</p><p>"This lamb won't get much notice from Johnnie Green after to-day," Spot
told Henrietta Hen. "He'll be left here in the yard. And it won't be
long now before Mrs. Green tells Farmer Green to put him in the pasture
with the flock. She won't have him in everybody's way. She'll get rid
of him quickly. You know that when Mrs. Green makes up her mind, things
generally happen to suit her."
</p><p>Henrietta nodded her handsome head.
</p><p>"Just what I've often told the Rooster!" she exclaimed.
</p><p>Well, the following morning, as much as an hour after breakfast, Johnnie
Green started up the road with some books under his arm and a lunch
basket in his hand. It was the first day of school. And somehow Johnnie
wasn't feeling very happy. He had dawdled about the house--so his mother
said. It appeared that he was in no hurry to leave home.
</p><p>Before Johnnie had reached the barn, which stood beside the road, Mrs.
Green stepped out of the house and looked at him.
</p><p>"You'd better get along!" she called after him. "You don't want to be
late the first day of school!"
</p><p>So Johnnie Green fell into a jog trot, which he kept up all the way to
the red schoolhouse.
</p><p>As he came in sight of the little box-like building he saw other
youngsters hurrying through the doorway. And then Johnnie ran as fast as
he could.
</p><p>He burst inside the schoolroom just as the school mistress tapped the
little bell on her desk, which meant that everybody must stop talking,
because school had begun. Johnnie Green hurried to a seat. But before he
reached it all the other pupils burst into a shout.
</p><p>Johnnie looked around. And there, trotting across the floor, was
Snowball! He had followed Johnnie all the way from Farmer Green's barn.
</p><p>It was some time before things were quiet. The teacher had to ring her
little bell a good many times, and even rap upon her desk with a ruler,
before the boys and girls stopped laughing. And then the teacher turned
to Johnnie Green and spoke to him.
</p><p>"Mary!" she said. "Is this your little lamb?"
</p><p>The teacher seemed surprised because her pupils began to roar at that.
But she made no attempt to silence them. She did not even try to quiet a
certain boy called "Red," who made more noise than all the rest
together.
</p><p>Meanwhile Johnnie Green's face looked like a great red apple. And it
grew several shades redder when Snowball walked up to his seat and stood
close beside him.
</p><p>"Don't you think--" said the teacher after a while--"don't you think,
Mary, that you'd better take your little lamb home?"
</p><p>Johnnie Green did not answer. But he hung his head as he rose and
hurried out of the schoolroom, with Snowball following close behind him.
</p><p>Once outside Johnnie could hear the children still laughing. And he even
thought that he could hear the teacher laughing, too.
</p><p>That very morning Snowball found himself turned into the pasture where
Farmer Green's flock of sheep were passing the summer. And it wasn't
long before the whole barnyard was filled with the noise of gossiping
tongues.
</p><p>"For once," said Henrietta Hen, "the Muley Cow knew what she was talking
about when she said Johnnie Green would grow tired of that white lamb."
</p><p>As for old dog Spot, he told everybody that he was going up to the
pasture to chase woodchucks.
</p><p>And as for Johnnie Green, he told his mother that he didn't believe he'd
go back to school any more.
</p><p>But she said he should, and that very morning.
</p><p>And things generally happened the way Mrs. Green intended.
