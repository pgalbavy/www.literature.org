<p>The Schools were now very near ahead of him, and, though not
much behindhand with his work, considering the intensity of his
exertions in other directions, he was anxious to make the most
of the months that were left. He read very hard in vacation, but,
when term began again, had to encounter unusual difficulties.
His father’s half-hinted warnings against a large acquaintance
proved prophetic. In fact, I used to wonder how he ever got his
reading done at all, and was often not a little annoyed with many
of my own contemporaries, and other younger men still, even to
the last batch of freshmen, whose fondness for his society was
untempered by any thought of examinations, or honours. Not one
of them could give a wine, or a breakfast party, without him,
and his good-nature kept him from refusing when he found that
his presence gave real pleasure. Then he never had the heart to
turn them out of his rooms, or keep his oak habitually sported;
and when that most necessary ceremony for a reading man had been
performed, it was not respected as it should have been. My rooms
were on the same staircase, half a flight below his (which looked
into the quadrangle, while mine looked out over the back of the
College), so that I could hear all that happened. Our College
lectures were all over at one. It was well for him if he had secured
quiet up to that hour; but, in any case, regularly within a few
minutes after the clock had struck, I used to hear steps on the
stairs, and a pause before his oak. If it was sported, kicking
or knocking would follow, with imploring appeals, "Now, old ’un"
(the term of endearment by which he went in College), "do open—I
know you’re in—only for two minutes." A short persistence seldom
failed; and soon other men followed on the same errand, "for a
few minutes only," till it was time for lunch, to which he would
then be dragged off in one of their rooms, and his oak never get
sported again till late at night. Up to his last term in College
this went on, though not to quite the same extent; and even then
there was one incorrigible young idler, who never failed in his
"open sesame," and wasted more of my brother’s time than all the
rest of the College. But who could be angry with him? He was one
of the smallest and most delicate men I ever saw, weighing about
8st. l0lb., a capital rider, and as brave as a lion, though we
always called him "the Mouse." Full of mother wit, but utterly
uncultivated, it was a perfect marvel how he ever matriculated,
and his answers, and attempts at construing, in lecture were fabulous—full
of good impulse, but fickle as the wind; reckless, spendthrift,
fast, in constant trouble with tradesmen, proctors, and the College
authorities. But no tradesman, when it came to the point, had
the heart to "court," or proctor to rusticate him; and the Dean,
though constantly in wrath at his misdeeds, never got beyond warnings,
and "gating." So he held on, until his utter, repeated, and hopeless
failure to pass his "smalls," brought his college career to its
inevitable end. Unfortunately for my brother’s reading, that career
coincided with his third year, and his society had an extraordinary
fascination for the Mouse. The perfect contrast between them,
in mind and body, may probably account for this; but I think the
little man had also a sort of longing to be decent and respectable,
and, in the midst of his wildest scrapes, felt that his intimacy
with the best oar and cricketer in the College, who was also on
good terms with the Dons, and paid his bills, and could write
Greek verses, kept him in touch with the better life of the place,
and was a constant witness to himself of his intention to amend,
some day. They had one taste in common, however, which largely
accounted for my brother’s undoubted affection for the little
"ne’er do weel," a passion for animals. The Mouse kept two terriers,
who were to him as children, lying in his bosom by night, and
eating from his plate by day. Dogs were strictly forbidden in
College, and the vigilance of the porter was proof against all
the other pets. But the Mouse’s terriers defied it. From living
on such intimate terms with their master, they had become as sharp
as undergraduates. They were never seen about the quadrangles
in the day-time, and knew the sound and sight of dean, tutor,
and porter, better than any freshman. When the Mouse went out
of College, they would stay behind on the staircase till they
were sure he must be fairly out in the street, and then scamper
across the two quadrangles, and out of the gate, as if their lives
depended on the pace. In the same way, on returning, they would
repeat the process, after first looking cautiously in at the gate
to see that the porter was safe in his den. But after dusk they
were at their ease at once, and would fearlessly trot over the
forbidden grass of the inner quad, or sit at the Provost’s door,
or on the Hall steps, and romp with anybody not in a master’s
gown. So, even when his master’s knock remained unanswered, Crib’s
or Jet’s beseeching whine and scratch would always bring my brother
to the door. He could not resist dogs, or children.</p>

<p>I have always laid my brother’s loss of his first class at the
door of his young friends, but chiefly on the Mouse, for that
little man’s delinquencies culminated in the most critical moment
of the Schools. The Saturday before paper work began he had seduced
George out for an evening stroll with him, and of course took
him through a part of the town which was famous for town-and-gown
rows. Here, a baker carrying a tray shouldered the Mouse into
the gutter. The Mouse thereupon knocked the baker’s tray off his
head. The baker knocked the little man over, and my brother floored
the baker, who sat in the mud, and howled "Gown, gown." In two
minutes a mob was on them, and they had to retreat fighting, which,
owing to the reckless pugnacity of his small comrade, was an operation
that tried all my brother’s coolness and strength to the utmost.
By the help, however, of Crib, who created timely diversions by
attacking the heels of the town at critical moments, he succeeded
in bringing the Mouse home, capless, with his gown in shreds,
and his nose and mouth bleeding, but otherwise unhurt, at the
cost to himself of a bad black-eye. The undergraduate remedies
of leeches, raw beef-steak, and paint were diligently applied
during the next thirty-six hours, but with very partial success;
and he had to appear in white tie and bands before the Examiners,
on the Monday morning, with decided marks of battle on his face.
In the evening, he wrote home:—</p>

"MY <em>DEAR FATHER</em>,

</p>
<p>
"The first day of paper work is over; I am sorry to say that<br/>
I have not satisfied myself at all. Although logic was my<br/>
strongest point as I thought, yet through nervousness, or some<br/>
other cause, I acquitted myself in a very slovenly manner;<br/>
and I feel nervous and down-hearted about the remainder of the<br/>
work, because I know that I am not so strong on those points as<br/>
I was in logic. I feel inclined myself to put off my degree,<br/>
but I should like to know what you think about it; I could<br/>
certainly get through, but I do not think I should do myself<br/>
any credit, and I am sure I should not satisfy myself. I shall<br/>
continue at the paper work till I hear from you. I should be<br/>
very willing to give up any plans which I have formed for the<br/>
vacation, and read quietly at home; and I am sure I could put<br/>
the affair beyond a doubt with a little more reading. But if<br/>
you think I had better get rid of it at once, I will continue.<br/>
I am in very good health, only, as I tell you, nervous and out<br/>
of spirits.

</p>
<p>
"Yours affectionately,

</p>
<p>
"G. E. <em>HUGHES</em>."

<p>His nervousness was out of place, as I ascertained afterwards
from his tutor, that the Examiners were very much pleased with
his paper work. Indeed, I think that he himself soon got over
his nervousness, and was well satisfied with his prospects when
his turn came for <em>vivâ voce</em> examination. I was foolish
enough to choose the same day for sitting in the Schools, a ceremony
one had to perform in the year preceding one’s own examination.
It involved attendance during the whole day, listening to the
attack of the four experts in row at the long table, on the intellectual
works of the single unfortunate, who sat facing them on the other
side. This, when the victim happens to be your brother, is a severe
and needless trial of nerves and patience.</p>

<p>For some time, however, I was quite happy, as George construed
his Greek plays capitally, and had his Aristotle at his finger
ends. He was then handed on to the third Examiner, who opened
Livy and put him on somewhere in the bewildering Samnite wars,
and, when he had construed, closed the book as if satisfied, just
putting him a casual question as to the end of the campaign, and
its effect on home politics at Rome. No answer, for George was
far too downright to attempt a shot; and, as he told me afterwards,
had not looked at this part of his Livy for more than a year.
Of course other questions followed, and then a searching examination
in this part of the history, which showed that my brother knew
his Arnold’s Rome well enough, but had probably taken up his Livy
on trust, which was very nearly the truth. I never passed a more
unpleasant hour, for I happened to be up in this part of Livy,
and, if the theories of Mesmerism were sound, should certainly
have been able to inspire him with the answers. As it was, I was
on the rack all the time, and left the Schools in a doleful state
of mind. I felt sure that he must lose his first class, and told
the group of our men so, who gathered in the Schools quadrangle
to see the Honours list posted. The Mouse, on the other hand,
swore roundly that he was certain of his first, offering to back
his opinion to any amount. I did not bet, but proved to be right.
His name came out in the second class, there being only five in
the first; and we walked back to Oriel a disconsolate band; the
Mouse, I really believe, being more cast down than any of the
party. I never told him that in my opinion he was himself not
a little responsible.</p>

<p>He was obliged to take his own name off the books shortly afterwards,
and started for the Cape, leaving Crib and Jet, the only valuable
possession I imagine that he had in the world, to my brother.
They were lovingly tended to a good old age. Their old master
joined the Mounted Rifles, in which corps (we heard at second
hand, for he never wrote a letter) he fully maintained his character
for fine riding and general recklessness, till he broke down altogether,
and died some two years later. It is a sad little history, which
carries its own moral.</p>
