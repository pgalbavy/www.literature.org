<p>As the night wore away without bringing any further evidence
of the presence of enemies, the solicitude of Vose Adams was transferred
to the two, who, hardly a mile distant, were awaiting with equal
anxiety the coming of morning. They and he had agreed upon the
plan to be pursued, but now, with the crisis at hand, the guide
became apprehensive about the final issue.</p>

<p>Suppose the couple should leave their hiding place to return
to the main trail before their pursuers were out of the way? Mutual
discovery was certain with the dreadful catastrophe that none
dreaded more than he. But it would seem that Lieutenant Russell
was too cautious to run the risk of so fatal a mistake. He would
reconnoitre the ground and keep out of sight until the coast was
clear, but the restless Adams was astir at the first streakings
of light in the cañon.</p>

<p>He first visited the animals. It was possible that the stealthy
prowler of the night before had done them injury, but, so far
as he could ascertain, nothing of the kind had occurred. Except
for what he had seen and heard during the darkness, he would not
have known that a visitor had been in camp.</p>

<p>It was not fully light when the others rose from their primitive
couches. Water was at hand, and after drinking and ablution, the
group sat down to their morning meal, which disposed of the last
remnant furnished by Vose Adams. While they were eating, he told
of the occurrences of the night and was surprised that his companions
made light of them. To them it was of less importance than to
him.</p>

<p>"So long as they do no more than prowl about the camp," remarked
Captain Dawson, "we need feel no concern."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Brush, "that if the fellow intended mischief,
he would have done it, but he has left no traces of anything of
the kind."</p>

<p>"Which was because the right kind of chance didn't show itself,"
said Vose; "if we don't have a lively fight before this bus'ness
is over, I'm much mistook, but it's time we was moving."</p>

<p>The guide seemed to have forgotten his resentment of the night
before and his friends were too considerate to refer to it. It
took but a short time to make the animals ready, when the procession
started up the gorge, Vose, as usual, leading, with the captain
next, then Wade Ruggles, while the parson brought up the rear,
that position naturally falling to him.</p>

<p>Men and beasts were refreshed by their rest and food, and it
required but a brief while to reach the top of the gorge, where,
as will be remembered, it terminated. It was here that Vose Adams
began his fine work, and he showed no more hesitancy in drawing
a "long bow," than on the previous night, when pretending to account
for his long absence.</p>

<p>"The trail leads to the right," he said, with a glance at the
ground, as if to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>His first thrill of misgiving came when he saw the parson pause
and look searchingly at the ground. Had he possessed one-half
the skill of Vose in trailing, he would have discovered that the
guide was misleading them, but he did not have that cleverness
nor did any other member of the party. The glance of the parson
was perfunctory and his brief pause was to regain his breath after
the short but laborious climb of the steep slope. Vose was watching
him closely and quickly saw the meaning of his action, for, whatever
Brush may have observed on the ground in front of him, it was
not the faint impressions left on the stones by the fugitives.
Neither the captain nor Ruggles so much as looked at the earth,
accepting the dictum of their guide without question.</p>

<p>It was not deemed best to mount the animals, because of the roughness
of the ground and the belief that they were close upon the parties
for whom they were searching. Vose took care to turn so sharply
to the right that they were speedily out of sight of the spot
where he had parted from the fugitives. Everything was going promisingly
when Wade Ruggles startled his companions by the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Helloa! there's that dog Timon!"</p>

<p>A hundred yards to the left rose a pile of rocks, the highest
of which reached an altitude of two hundred feet or more. Upon
the crest of one of the lower rocks, which had only a slight height,
the immense dog stood in plain sight. It looked as if he had started
to ascend the rocks, when he discovered the party and paused to
learn their business.</p>

<p>The picture was a striking one. The enormous size of the brute
gave the impression at first that he was a wolf or some wild animal
that had challenged the advance of the four men. This error would
have been made had not each been so familiar with the creature.
As he stood, his formidable head raised, his forequarters being
slightly higher than the remainder of his body, his position was
diagonal. He was surveying his acquaintances, who surveyed him
in turn with equal curiosity.</p>

<p>Vose Adams's heart sank. What was the meaning of this? As he
viewed it, the presence of the dog could have no other significance
than that the lieutenant and Nellie Dawson were close at hand.
Timon was in their company and would not have strayed far, so
that he had betrayed them. From some cause, which the guide could
not comprehend, Lieutenant Russell had made a change of plan and
placed himself almost in the path along which Vose was leading
the pursuers, in the belief that the fugitives were at a safe
distance.</p>

<p>The four men looked at the dog for several moments in silence,
when the captain spoke:</p>

<p>"We must be very near them."</p>

<p>"You're dead right," added Ruggles in the same undertone; "we've
got 'em cornered sooner than we expected."</p>

<p>"They can't go far," said the parson, "without being stopped
by the rocks, when we shall have them in the nicest trap that
was ever set for any game."</p>

<p>The reflection of Vose Adams was of a different nature.</p>

<p>"If they make fools of themselves and upset all my plans, what
can I do to help 'em? Why didn't they stay where they promised
to stay, and why didn't they kill that blamed dog afore he played
this trick on 'em?"</p>

<p>Timon stood for two or three minutes so immovable that he suggested
a stone image of himself, carved out of the rock on which he was
perched. Then he emitted a single husky bark and leaped lightly
down from where he had been standing. It was no more than a dozen
feet, and he alighted as gracefully as a panther. He trotted part
way to the horsemen, who were closely watching his movements,
stopped, barked again and wheeling, trotted forward over precisely
the course Vose Adams was taking when checked by the appearance
of the canine.</p>

<p>The men looked at one another in astonishment. The action of
the dog was unaccountable, but Captain Dawson's explanation sounded
reasonable.</p>

<p>"That shows we are on the right track and he has come to guide
us to where they are awaiting him."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of it. The actions of the brute said
as plainly as so many words: "Come with me and I will take you
straight to the people you want to see."</p>

<p>Instead of following Timon at once, the party kept watch of him.
He trotted a dozen steps and then paused and looked back. Observing
that he was not understood, he emitted several more barks, took
a couple of steps and then repeated the performance. His object
was so evident that Captain Dawson said:</p>

<p>"That's as plain as the nose on your face; the animal is worth
a dozen guides like you, Vose."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you foller him?" sulkily asked the latter.</p>

<p>"That's what we shall do; come on."</p>

<p>Observing that the captain left his horse standing, the parson
inquired the reason.</p>

<p>"They are of no use to us and will be only a bother; leave them
here until we need them; I will follow the dog and you can take
what order you choose, but," he added with unmistakable earnestness,
"every one of you must keep in the background till I'm through."</p>

<p>Timon held his motionless position until the four men had taken
several steps toward him and there could be no error as to their
intention. Vose Adams observed that he was following, without
a hair's variation, the course he had in mind.</p>

<p>"It serves 'em right," was his angry reflection; "when the leftenant
spoke 'bout hunting up a new trail through the mountains, I oughter
knowed he hain't no sense and was sure to make a mess of things.
Now's he gone and sneaked off where these folks will stub their
toes agin him; I'm 'sprised that the Queen didn't hammer a little
sense into his head."</p>

<p>The guide was in a torture of apprehension. The impending outcome
was likely to betray the deception he had used, but it was not
for that he cared. There could be no mistaking the deadly mood
of Captain Dawson and the equally intense hatred of Ruggles and
Brush. A meeting with Lieutenant Russell made a frightful tragedy
inevitable, and no one could be more vividly aware of the fact
than the young officer himself, for Vose had impressed it upon
him, but the guide in his anguish of spirit, saw no possible escape
from it. He stolidly followed, striving to brace himself for what
must soon come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the strange leadership continued. Timon seemed to
be impatient, for occasionally he broke into a trot, abruptly
pausing and looking back, as if to urge his followers to use more
haste. Since they did not do so, he checked himself, when about
to pass beyond sight and waited for them to draw near. He led
them around boulders and masses of rocks, over ridges, down declivities,
across one small stream, through a ravine and again among the
precipitous piles of stone, until even the hardy men were well
nigh exhausted. They had traveled fully a mile over a route that
was of the most trying nature.</p>

<p>It was about this time that an extraordinary suspicion began
forming in the mind of Vose Adams. He hardly dared give credence
to it, but it took greater hold upon him with every few rods of
advance. Nothing in the world would have induced him to make known
his suspicion, but it continued to grow.</p>

<p>Suddenly Captain Dawson stopped. As he looked around his face
was agitated.</p>

<p>"Boys," said he, "there's something infernally strange about
this."</p>

<p>Vose Adams saw that his own suspicion had entered the mind of
their leader, but the countenance of the guide was as blank as
that of a child.</p>

<p>"It's the worst tramp I ever had," remarked the parson, removing
his hat and mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>"If there's any harder work," added Ruggles, "count me out."</p>

<p>Captain Dawson looked angrily at Vose.</p>

<p>"Do you know the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>Vose shook his head and prevaricated still further by adding:</p>

<p>"Nor what you're driving at either."</p>

<p>"That dog has misled us; instead of conducting us to the couple
he has taken us away from them."</p>

<p>It was true and every one of the four knew it. The suspicion
of the guide had become certainty. Was it instinct or reason that
controlled the animal? Who shall draw the line in explaining many
of the actions of the brute creation?</p>

<p>Vose Adams was silent a moment and then emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Hang me, if I don't b'leve you're right, captain. I've been
told that that dog knowed more than a good many folks and there
ain't no doubt of it now."</p>

<p>The disgusted parson exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why didn't one of us think of that? The idea of all four being
fooled by a dog!"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been so bad if there had been two dogs," said
Ruggles, who saw the grim humor of the thing, "but it is tough
to have our eyes shet by only one."</p>

<p>It was impossible for Vose Adams wholly to restrain all evidence
of his pleasure. When in the depths of despair, he was awakened
to the fact that the canine had performed one of the most brilliant
exploits conceivable. He could not help smiling. The captain was
in an ugly mood and in a threatening voice asked:</p>

<p>"Did you have anything to do with this?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; me and Timon fixed up the thing afore he left Dead
Man's Gulch; it took us a good while; the dog didn't think it
would work, but I stuck to it and finally he promised to have
a try at it; certainly we fixed it up atween us."</p>

<p>The guide did a clever thing in thus turning the fantastic belief
of the captain into ridicule. Had he protested, he might have
added to the suspicion against himself. It was further in his
favor that it was known he had never had much to do with Timon.
As already related, the brute had few friends among the miners
and Vose Adams never sought his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was impossible to brush out of sight one significant
fact,&mdash;the long absence of Adams the day before. But for the last
occurrence, nothing would have been thought of the former, but
it was clear that Captain Dawson had begun to entertain doubts
of the loyalty of his guide.</p>

<p>"He'll never repeat his trick anyway," exclaimed the officer,
facing about and bringing his rifle to his shoulder. But his intention
of shooting Timon was frustrated, for the brute was nowhere in
sight. Unreasonable as it might sound, it looked as if he suspected
how things would turn out and took the occasion to place himself
beyond danger from the indignant men.</p>

<p>"In the army we shoot spies and traitors," remarked the captain,
so angered by his repeated disappointments that he could not govern
his feelings. In giving expression to the remark, the officer
made a serious mistake, which he saw the moment the words left
his lips. He was suspicious of Vose Adams, but he should have
concealed all evidence of it, until the proof appeared. When that
took place, he would shoot the man with no more hesitation that
he would have shot the dog. But he had now put Vose on his guard
and the difficulty of detecting him was increased tenfold.</p>

<p>As if to obliterate the memory of his words, the captain said
in the most matter of fact tone he could assume:</p>

<p>"The mistake we made has taken us from the right spot; they must
have been near the rocks where Timon showed himself."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the parson, "and were watching us."</p>

<p>"The one thing to do is to retrace our steps; perhaps the two
may be fools enough," bitterly added the captain, "to wait for
us, since that seems to be the only way by which we shall ever
come up with them."</p>

<p>A single short bark startled them. The captain wheeled like a
flash with his gun at his shoulder. But Timon was too cunning
to show himself. It is not improbable that he meant the expression
for a note of triumph over his inimitable exploit, while such
a wonderful dog was too wise to run any risk of punishment from
his indignant victims.</p>

<p>The hunter is sustained against fatigue by the excitement of
the chase; and, despite the severe labor of following the canine
guide, all four men stood it far better than the return to the
spot where the pursuit began. Angered, chagrined and in desperate
mood, even the grim leader was forced occasionally to stop and
rest. Nearly two hours passed before they descried the familiar
pile of rocks in their front.</p>

<p>"That's the spot," he said, "but what good can it do us? It's
a wonder if they have not run off with our horses; it would be
a fitting climax to this folly."</p>

<p>It was the secret wish of Adams, from the moment of discovering
the cleverness of Timon, that this very thing should be done.
If Lieutenant Russell took such a precaution, it could not fail
to be effective. Returning to the main trail after his pursuers
were out of the way, he would have an open path through the mountains
to Sacramento. If the lameness of Nellie's pony continued, her
saddle could be transferred to one of the other horses, and, leading
or driving the remainder of the animals, the four men would soon
find their task a hopeless one.</p>

<p>But the young officer was restrained from such action by a certain
chivalry that governed all his actions. He could not consent to
take so unfair an advantage of an enemy, even though the fate
of one dearer than his own life was at stake. And yet it must
be confessed that the lieutenant drew it very fine. His course
did not win the respect of his enemies, who were inclined to attribute
it to stupidity, rather than courtesy.</p>

<p>But no time was to be lost in deciding their line of action.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better make a hunt among them rocks," suggested
Wade Ruggles.</p>

<p>The others studied them with as much interest as if it were the
first time they had been seen. If the couple had taken refuge
among the caverns and crevices of this immense pile of stone,
they must have left their animals on the ground below where they
could be readily discovered.</p>

<p>"We may as well have a look," remarked the captain; "what do
you think, Vose?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything; don't ask me any questions."</p>

<p>He never looked more angry. He had not forgotten the slur of
the captain and had spirit enough to resent it. Dawson was too
proud to apologize and he could not do so, when his suspicion
of the fellow's loyalty was as strong as ever. On the contrary,
having made his blunder, the officer drove the arrow home.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you didn't take that resolution in the first place;
it would have been better for all of us, though not so good for
those we are looking for."</p>

<p>The captain and Ruggles now turned to the right, while the other
two took the opposite direction. They were thus enabled, after
more hard work, practically to pass around the mass of rocks,
returning to their starting point, without having discovered any
traces of man, woman or their animals. On the journey, Adams and
the parson exchanged few words, but it was different with the
other couple.</p>

<p>"What do you think of his long absence yesterday?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"It has a bad look,&mdash;worse than I thought when he come back."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I take it with the action of that dog. You didn't fail to notice
that Timon took us along the exact route that Vose was leadin'
us over and we found out that it was the wrong one."</p>

<p>"And you believe he purposely misled us?"</p>

<p>"It's almost sartin."</p>

<p>"Suppose it <em>was</em> certain, Wade?"</p>

<p>"I'd shoot him quicker'n lightning."</p>

<p>"So would I."</p>

<p>"But you see we can't be sartin just yit; if Vose is in that
kind of bus'ness, he'll give himself away purty soon."</p>

<p>"I agree with you and we'll watch him."</p>

<p>Thus was the momentous bargain made.</p>

<p>When the four came together once more, the parson remarked:</p>

<p>"It's my belief that after we were well out of the way, the two
went down the gorge to the main trail and are now making haste
to Sacramento."</p>

<p>The exact line of action that had been agreed upon! Vose Adams
was firmly convinced that this was the very thing that had taken
place and the utmost he could do was to prevent the horsemen from
acting on that theory until the fugitives were given opportunity
to pass beyond reach.</p>

<p>Except for the words of Captain Dawson, the guide would have
striven to delay the pursuit, but he dared not attempt it after
the warning. Ignoring the captain, he said to Felix Brush:</p>

<p>"It's more'n likely you're right, parson; that would have been
the most nat'ral thing for them to do and it's no use of our standing
here and talking, when every minute counts."</p>

<p>"We can quickly learn the truth; it isn't far to the gorge, where
they must have left traces; leave the horses here, for we can
soon return for them if it proves necessary."</p>

<p>Forgetting their fatigue, the four walked back over their own
trail. The forenoon was well advanced, and, by this time, the
fugitives were probably a good way off. Adams was relieved because
of this action, for it promised more delay.</p>

<p>Reaching the beginning of the gorge, all began an examination
of the ground, for the imprints of the horses' feet were plainly
seen. To the amazement of every one, each hoof pointed upward,
that is away from the cañon. There was no evidence that any quadruped
had descended the slope. All had gone up. Vose Adams was in despair.</p>

<p>"They have let their only chance go by," he bitterly reflected;
"it's too late now to save them!"</p>
