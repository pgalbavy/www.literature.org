<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Fred Sheldon was the only child of a widow, who lived on a small
place a mile beyond the village, and managed to eke out a living
thereon, assisted by a small pension from the government, her
husband having been killed during the late war.</p>

<p>A half-mile beyond stood a large building, gray with age and
surrounded with trees, flowers and climbing vines. The broad bricks
of which it was composed were known to have been brought from
Holland long before the revolution, and about the time when George
Washington was hunting for the cherry-tree with his little hatchet.</p>

<p>In this old structure lived the sisters Perkinpine &mdash;Annie
and Lizzie&mdash;who were nearly seventy years of age. They were twins,
had never been married, were generally known to be wealthy, but
preferred to live entirely by themselves, with no companion but
three or four cats, and not even a watch-dog.</p>

<p>Their ancestors were among the earliest settlers of the section,
and the Holland bricks could show where they had been chipped
and broken by the bullets of the Indians who howled around the
solid old structure, through the snowy night, as ravenous as so
many wolves to reach the cowering women and children within.</p>

<p>The property had descended to the sisters in regular succession,
and there could be no doubt they were rich in valuable lands,
if in nothing else. Their retiring disposition repelled attention
from their neighbors, but it was known there was much old and
valuable silver, and most probably money itself, in the house.</p>

<p>Michael Heyland was their hired man, but he lived in a small
house some distance away, where he always spent his nights.</p>

<p>Young Fred Sheldon was once sent over to the residence of the
Misses Perkinpine after a heavy snowstorm, to see whether he could
do anything for the old ladies. He was then only ten years old,
but his handsome, ruddy face, his respectful manner, and his cheerful
eagerness to oblige them, thawed a great deal of their natural
reserve, and they gradually came to like him.</p>

<p>He visited the old brick house quite often, and frequently bore
substantial presents to his mother, though, rather curiously,
the old ladies never asked that she should pay them a visit.</p>

<p>The Misses Perkinpine lived very well indeed, and Fred Sheldon
was not long in discovering it. When he called there he never
could get away without eating some of the vast hunks of gingerbread
and enormous pieces of thick, luscious pie, of which Fred, like
all boys, was very fond.</p>

<p>There was no denying that Fred had established himself as a favorite
in that peculiar household, as he well deserved to be.</p>

<p>On the afternoon succeeding his switching at school he reached
home and did his chores, whistling cheerily in the meanwhile,
and thinking of little else than the great circus on the morrow,
when he suddenly stopped in surprise upon seeing a carriage standing
in front of the gate.</p>

<p>Just then his mother called him to the house and explained:</p>

<p>"Your Uncle William is quite ill, Fred, and has sent for me.
You know he lives twelve miles away, and it will take us a good
while to get there; if you are afraid to stay here alone you can
go with us."</p>

<p>Fred was too quick to trip himself in that fashion. To-morrow
was circus day, and if he went to his Uncle Will's, he might miss
it.</p>

<p>"Miss Annie asked me this morning to go over and see them again,"
he said, alluding to one of the Misses Perkinpine, "and they'll
be mighty glad to have me there."</p>

<p>"That will be much better, for you will be so near home that
you can come over in the morning and see that everything is right,
but I'm afraid you'll eat too much pie and cake and pudding and
preserves."</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid," laughed Fred, who kissed his mother good-by
and saw the carriage vanish down the road in the gloom of the
gathering darkness. Then he busied himself with the chores, locked
up the house and put everything in shape preparatory to going
away.</p>

<p>He was still whistling, and was walking rapidly toward the gate,
when he was surprised and a little startled by observing the figure
of a man, standing on the outside, as motionless as a stone, and
no doubt watching him.</p>

<p>He appeared to be ill-dressed, and Fred at once set him down
as one of those pests of society known as a tramp, who had probably
stopped to get something to eat.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the lad, with an air of bravery which
he was far from feeling, as he halted within two or three rods
of the unexpected guest, ready to retreat if it should become
necessary.</p>

<p>"I want you to keep a civil tongue in your head," was the answer,
in a harsh rasping voice.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be uncivil," was the truthful reply of Fred,
who believed in courtesy to every one.</p>

<p>"Who lives here, then?" asked the other in the same gruff voice.</p>

<p>"My mother, Mrs. Mary Sheldon, and myself, but my mother isn't
at home."</p>

<p>The stranger was silent a moment, and then looking around, as
if to make sure that no one was within hearing, asked in a lower
voice:</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where the Miss Perkinpines live?"</p>

<p>"Right over yonder," was the response of the boy, pointing toward
the house, which was invisible in the darkness, but a star-like
twinkle of light showed where it was, surrounded by trees and
shrubbery.</p>

<p>Fred came near adding that he was on his way there, and would
show him the road, but a sudden impulse restrained him.</p>

<p>The tramp-like individual peered through the gloom in the direction
indicated, and then inquired:</p>

<p>"How fur is it?"</p>

<p>"About half a mile."</p>

<p>The stranger waited another minute or so, as if debating with
himself whether he should ask some other questions that were in
his mind; but, without another word, he moved away and speedily
disappeared from the road.</p>

<p>Although he walked for several paces on the rough gravel in front
of the gate, the lad did not hear the slightest sound. He must
have been barefooted, or more likely, wore rubber shoes.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon could not help feeling very uncomfortable over the
incident itself. The question about the old ladies, and the man's
looks and manner impressed him that he meant ill toward his good
friends, and Fred stood a long time asking himself what he ought
to do.</p>

<p>He thought of going down to the village and telling Archie Jackson,
the bustling little constable, what he feared, or of appealing
to some of the neighbors; and pity it is he did not do so, but
he was restrained by the peculiar disposition of the Misses Perkinpine,
who might be very much displeased with him.</p>

<p>As he himself was about the only visitor they received, and as
they had lived so long by themselves, they would not thank him,
to say the least&mdash;that is, viewing the matter from his standpoint.</p>

<p>"I'll tell the ladies about it," he finally concluded, "and we'll
lock the doors and sit up all night. I wish they had three or
four dogs and a whole lot of guns; or if I had a lasso," he added,
recalling one of the circus pictures, "and the tramp tried to
get in, I'd throw it over his head and pull him half way to the
top of the house and let him hang there until he promised to behave
himself."</p>

<p>Fred's head had been slightly turned by the circus posters, and
it can hardly be said that he was the best guard the ladies could
have in case there were any sinister designs on the part of the
tramp.</p>

<p>But the boy was sure he was never more needed at the old brick
house than he was on that night, and hushing his whistle, he started
up the road in the direction taken by the stranger.</p>

<p>It was a trying ordeal for the little fellow, whose chief fear
was that he would overtake the repulsive individual and suffer
for interfering with his plans.</p>

<p>There was a faint moon in the sky, but its light now and then
was obscured by the clouds which floated over its face. Here and
there, too, were trees, beneath whose shadows the boy stepped
lightly, listening and looking about him, and imagining more than
once he saw the figure dreaded so much.</p>

<p>But he observed nothing of him, nor did he meet any of his neighbors,
either in wagons or on foot, and his heart beat tumultuously when
he drew near the grove of trees, some distance back from the road,
in the midst of which stood the old Holland brick mansion.</p>

<p>To reach it it was necessary to walk through a short lane, lined
on either hand by a row of stately poplars, whose shade gave a
cool twilight gloom to the intervening space at mid-day.</p>

<p>"Maybe he isn't here, after all," said Fred to himself, as he
passed through the gate of the picket fence surrounding the house,
"and I guess&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then the slightest possible rustling caught his ear, and
he stepped back behind the trunk of a large weeping willow.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken; some one was moving through the shrubbery
at the corner of the house, and the next minute the frightened
boy saw the tramp come stealthily to view, and stepping close
to the window of the dining-room, peer into it.</p>

<p>As the curtain was down it was hard to see how he could discover
anything of the inmates, but he may have been able to detect something
of the interior by looking through at the side of the curtain,
or possibly he was only listening.</p>

<p>At any rate he stood thus but a short time, when he withdrew
and slowly passed from view around the corner.</p>

<p>The instant he was gone Fred moved forward and knocked softly
on the door, so softly indeed, that he had to repeat it before
some one approached from the inside and asked who was there.</p>

<p>When his voice was recognized the bolt was withdrawn and he was
most cordially welcomed by the old ladies, who were just about
to take up their knitting and sewing, having finished their tea.</p>

<p>When Fred told them he had come to stay all night and hadn't
had any supper, they were more pleased than ever, and insisted
that he should go out and finish a large amount of gingerbread,
custard and pie, for the latter delicacy was always at command.</p>

<p>"I'll eat some," replied Fred, "but I don't feel very hungry."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" asked Miss Annie, peering over her
spectacles in alarm; "are you sick? If you are we've got lots
of castor oil and rhubarb and jalap and boneset; shall I mix you
up some?"</p>

<p>"O my gracious! no&mdash;don't mention 'em again; I ain't sick that
way &mdash;I mean I'm scared."</p>

<p>"Scared at what? Afraid there isn't enough supper for you?" asked
Miss Lizzie, looking smilingly down upon the handsome boy.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Fred, glancing from one to the other, "I think
there's a robber going to try and break into your house to-night
and steal everything you've got, and then he'll kill you both,
and after that I'm sure he means to burn down the house, and that'll
be the last all of you and your cats."</p>

<p>When the young visitor made such a prodigious declaration, he
supposed the ladies would scream and probably faint away. But
the very hugeness of the boy's warning caused emotions the reverse
of what he anticipated.</p>

<p>They looked kindly at him a minute or so and then quietly smiled.</p>

<p>"What a little coward you are, Fred," said Miss Annie; "surely
there is nobody who would harm two old creatures like us."</p>

<p>"But they want your money," persisted Fred, still standing in
the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Both ladies were too truthful to deny that they had any, even
to such a child, and Lizzie said:</p>

<p>"We haven't enough to tempt anybody to do such a great wrong."</p>

<p>"You can't tell about that, then I 'spose some of those silver
dishes must be worth a great deal."</p>

<p>"Yes, so they are," said Annie, "and we prize them the most because
our great, great, great-grandfather brought them over the sea
a good many years ago, and they have always been in our family."</p>

<p>"But," interposed Lizzie, "we lock them up every night."</p>

<p>"What in?"</p>

<p>"A great big strong chest."</p>

<p>"Anybody could break it open, though."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's locked; and you know it's against the law to break
a lock."</p>

<p>"Well," said Fred, with a great sigh, "I hope there won't anybody
disturb you, but I hope you will fasten all the windows and doors
to-night."</p>

<p>"We always do; and then," added the benign old lady, raising
her head so as to look under her spectacles in the face of the
lad, "you know we have you to take care of us."</p>

<p>"Have you got a gun in the house?"</p>

<p>"Mercy, yes; there's one over the fire-place, where father put
it forty years ago."</p>

<p>"Is there anything the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only the lock is broke off, and I think father said
the barrel was bursted."</p>

<p>Fred laughed in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"What under the sun is such an old thing good for?"</p>

<p>"It has done us just as much good as if it were a new cannon&mdash;but
come out to your supper."</p>

<p>The cheerful manner of the old ladies had done much to relieve
Fred's mind of his fears, and a great deal of his natural appetite
came back to him.</p>

<p>He walked into the kitchen, where he seated himself at a table
on which was spread enough food for several grown persons, and
telling him he must not leave any of it to be wasted, the ladies
withdrew, closing the door behind them, so that he might not be
embarrassed by their presence.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there's any use of being scared," said Fred
to himself, as he first sunk his big, sound teeth into a huge
slice of buttered short-cake, on which some peach jam had been
spread! "If I hadn't seen that tramp looking in at the window
I wouldn't feel so bad, and I declare," he added in dismay, "when
they questioned me, I never thought to tell 'em that. Never mind,
I'll give 'em the whole story when I finish five or six slices
of this short-cake and some ginger-cake, and three or four pieces
of pie, and then, I think, they'll believe I'm right."</p>

<p>For several minutes the boy devoted himself entirely to his meal,
and had the good ladies peeped through the door while he was thus
employed they would have been highly pleased to see how well he
was getting along.</p>

<p>"I wish I was an old maid and hadn't anything to do but to cook
nice food like this and play with the cats&mdash;my gracious!"</p>

<p>Just then the door creaked, and, looking up, Fred Sheldon saw
to his consternation the very tramp of whom he had been thinking
walk into the room and approach the table.</p>

<p>His clothing was ragged and unclean, a cord being drawn around
his waist to keep his coat together, while the collar was up so
high about his neck that nothing of the shirt was visible.</p>

<p>His hair was frowsy and uncombed, as were his huge yellow whiskers,
which seemed to grow up almost to his eyes, and stuck out like
the quills on a porcupine.</p>

<p>As the intruder looked at the boy and shuffled toward him, in
his soft rubber shoes, he indulged in a broad grin, which caused
his teeth to shine through his scraggly beard.</p>

<p>He held his hat, which resembled a dishcloth, as much as anything,
in his hand, and was all suavity.</p>

<p>His voice sounded as though he had a bad cold, with now and then
an odd squeak. As he bowed he said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, young man; I hope I don't intrude."</p>

<p>As he approached the table and helped himself to a chair, the
ladies came along behind him, Miss Lizzie saying:</p>

<p>"This poor man, Frederick, has had nothing to eat for three days,
and is trying to get home to his family. I'm sure you will be
glad to have him sit at the table with you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm awful glad," replied the boy, almost choking with the
fib. "I was beginning to feel kind of lonely, but I'm through
and he can have the table to himself."</p>

<p>"You said you were a shipwrecked sailor, I believe?" was the
inquiring remark of Miss Lizzie, as the two sisters stood in the
door, beaming kindly on the tramp, who began to play havoc with
the eatables before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, mum; we was shipwrecked on the Jarsey coast; I was second
mate and all was drowned but me. I hung to the rigging for three
days and nights in the awfullest snow storm you ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Mercy goodness," gasped Annie; "when was that?"</p>

<p>"Last week," was the response, as the tramp wrenched the leg
of a chicken apart with hands and teeth.</p>

<p>"Do they have snow storms down there in summer time?" asked Fred,
as he moved away from the table.</p>

<p>The tramp, with his mouth full of meat, and with his two hands
grasping the chicken-bone between his teeth, stopped work and
glared at the impudent youngster, as if he would look him through
and through for daring to ask the question.</p>

<p>"Young man," said he, as he solemnly resumed operations, "of
course, they have snow storms down there in summer time; I'm ashamed
of your ignorance; you're rather small to put in when grown-up
folks are talking, and I'd advise you to listen arter this."</p>

<p>Fred concluded he would do so, using his eyes meanwhile.</p>

<p>"Yes, mum," continued the tramp; "I was in the rigging for three
days and nights, and then was washed off by the breakers and carried
ashore, where I was robbed of all my clothing, money and jewels."</p>

<p>"Deary, deary me!" exclaimed the sisters in concert. "How dreadful."</p>

<p>"You are right, ladies, and I've been tramping ever since."</p>

<p>"How far away is your home?"</p>

<p>"Only a hundred miles, or so."</p>

<p>"You have a family, have you?"</p>

<p>"A wife and four babies&mdash;if they only knowed what their poor
father had passed through&mdash;excuse these tears, mum."</p>

<p>The tramp just then gave a sniff and drew his sleeve across his
forehead, but Fred Sheldon, who was watching him closely, did
not detect anything like a tear.</p>

<p>But he noted something else, which had escaped the eyes of the
kind-hearted ladies.</p>

<p>The movement of the arm before the face seemed to displace the
luxuriant yellow beard. Instead of sitting on the countenance
as it did at first, even in its ugliness, it was slewed to one
side.</p>

<p>Only for a moment, however, for by a quick flirt of the hand,
as though he were scratching his chin, he replaced it.</p>

<p>And just then Fred Sheldon noticed another fact. The hand with
which this was done was as small, white and fair as that of a
woman&mdash;altogether the opposite of that which would have been seen
had the tramp's calling been what he claimed.</p>

<p>The ladies, after a few more thoughtful questions, withdrew,
so that their guest might not feel any delicacy in eating all
he wished&mdash;an altogether unnecessary step on their part.</p>

<p>Fred went out with them, but after he had been gone a few minutes
he slyly peeped through the crack of the door, without the ladies
observing the impolite proceeding.</p>

<p>The guest was still doing his best in the way of satisfying his
appetite, but he was looking around the room, at the ceiling,
the floor, the doors, windows and fire-place, and indeed at everything,
as though he was greatly interested in them, as was doubtless
the case.</p>

<p>All at once he stopped and listened, glancing furtively at the
door, as if he feared some one was about to enter the room.</p>

<p>Then he quietly rose, stepped quickly and noiselessly to one
of the windows, took out the large nail which was always inserted
over the sash at night to keep it fastened, put it in his pocket,
and, with a half chuckle and grin, seated himself again at the
table.</p>

<p>At the rate of eating which was displayed, he soon finished,
and, wiping his greasy hands on his hair, he gave a great sigh
of relief, picked up his slouchy hat, and moved toward the door
leading to the room in which the ladies sat.</p>

<p>"I'm very much obleeged to you," said he, bowing very low, as
he shuffled toward the outer door, "and I shall ever remember
you in my prayers; sorry I can't pay you better, mums."</p>

<p>The sisters protested they were more than repaid in the gratitude
he showed, and they begged him, if he ever came that way, to call
again.</p>

<p>He promised that he would be glad to do so, and departed.</p>

<p>"You may laugh all you're a mind to," said Fred, when he had
gone, "but that's the man I saw peeping in the window, and he
means to come back here to-night and rob you."</p>

<p>The boy told all that he knew, and the ladies, while not sharing
his fright, agreed that it was best to take extra precautions
in locking up.</p>
