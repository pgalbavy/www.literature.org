<p>The prima donna who grew so fond of Mike discovered several interesting
facts about him, aside from his marvellous tenor voice. He had
the talent of improvisation. When they became well enough acquainted
for him to feel at ease in her presence, he sang bits of melody
that were his own composition. She was delighted and encouraged
him to cultivate the gift. Of course he knew nothing about playing
any instrument, but under her instruction he quickly picked up
the art of accompanying himself on the piano. The music which
he sang was of the simplest nature and the chords suggested themselves
to his ear.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the lad was that, despite his exuberant,
rollicking nature, he had no taste for humorous music. When she
asked him to sing a lively song, he shook his head. He not only
knew none, but had no wish to learn any. His liking was for sentiment
and tenderness of feeling. Moore's melodies were his favorites
and he knew few others. At the last meeting of Mike and the lady
she gave him a fragment of verse which she had cut from a paper
and asked him to compose a melody for it. He promised to try.</p>

<p>With this rather lengthy explanation, and the fact that neither
Alvin Landon nor Chester Haynes had ever heard him sing, though
both had noticed that his voice was peculiarly clear, you will
understand the surprise that awaited them when he walked to the
piano and reluctantly sat down. The hoarseness which followed
his shouting when marooned on White Islands was gone and his notes
were as clear as a bell.</p>

<p>Every one expected a mirth-provoking song when he placed his
foot on the pedal and his fingers touched the keys. Even Widow
Friestone smiled in anticipation, while Alvin and Chester feared
that in his ignorance of true singing his attempts would become
comical to the last degree. The listeners glanced significantly
to one another, while he was bringing out a few preliminary notes.</p>

<p>Suddenly into the room burst the most ravishing music from the
sweetest voice they had ever heard.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"The harp that once through Tara's halls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of music shed,<br/>
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if that soul were fled.<br/>
So sleeps the pride of former days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So glory's thrill is o'er,<br/>
And hearts that once beat high for praise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now feel that pulse no more."

</p>

<p>With the same bewitching sweetness he sang the remaining stanza,
and then paused with his fingers idly rambling over the keys,
as if in doubt what next to do.</p>

<p>There was no applause. Not a person moved or seemed to breathe.
Then Alvin and Chester looked wonderingly at each other, as if
doubting their own senses. Whoever imagined that Mike Murphy was
gifted with so wonderful a voice? It seemed as if they were dreaming
and were waiting for the spell to lift.</p>

<p>It would have been affectation on the part of Mike to pretend
he was ignorant of the effect he had produced. He had seen it
too often in the past, and he knew the great songstress on the
steamer would not have said what she did had there not been good
basis therefor. So, without seeming to notice the hush&mdash;the most
sincere tribute possible&mdash;he sang the old favorite "Mavourneen,"
and at its conclusion "Annie Laurie," with a liquidity of tone
that was never surpassed by throat of nightingale.</p>

<p>At its conclusion he swung round on the stool, sprang up and
dropped into the nearest chair, looking about as if doubtful of
the reception that was to attend his efforts.</p>

<p>Nora was the first to rally. She uttered one ecstatic "Oh!" bounded
across the floor, threw her dimpled arms about his neck and kissed
him on the cheek.</p>

<p>"You darling! You sing like an angel!"</p>

<p>"Nothing could be sweeter," added the smiling mother. Mike gently
kissed the girl on her forehead, and did not release her until
she drew away.</p>

<p>"Ye're very kind. It's mesilf is glad me efforts seemed to plaise
ye, though I'm in doubt as to the Captain and second mate."</p>

<p>Alvin walked silently across the floor and reached out his hand.</p>

<p>"Glad to know ye," replied Mike, with a grin, looking up in the
face that had actually turned slightly pale. "What is yer name,
plaise?"</p>

<p>Chester joined his chum.</p>

<p>"Mike, Alvin and I were silent, for we didn't know what to say.
You have given us the surprise of our lives. I am no singer and
never can be, but I would give a hundred thousand dollars, if
I had it, for your voice. Alvin makes some pretensions. He is
the leader of his school quartette, but he can't equal you."</p>

<p>"Equal him!" sniffed the Captain. "If Mike ever shows himself
where our quartette is trying to sing, I shall make every one
shut up to save ourselves from disgrace. As for Mike, we'll give
him the choice to sing for us or to be killed."</p>

<p>Chester asked reprovingly:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you let us know about this before?"</p>

<p>"Ye didn't ask me, and what could be the difference if ye didn't
find it out? Ye wouldn't have larned the same if Nora and her
mither hadn't insisted that I should entertain them, as I tried
to do."</p>

<p>"You are a queer make-up," replied Alvin, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Since ye are the leader, Captain, of yer quartette at school,
it's up to ye to obleege the company wid something in their line."</p>

<p>Nora added her entreaties.</p>

<p>"We know you can do very well, Alvin, though of course not half
so well as Mike, for <em>nobody</em> can do that," was the na√Øve
argument of the miss.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Alvin emphatically, and, assuming deep solemnity,
he raised his hand. "I vow that I will never, never sing in Mike's
presence. I can stand a joke as well as most persons, but that
is the limit. Here's Chester, however. He will be glad to give
Mike a few lessons."</p>

<p>The fun of it was that Chester could not sing the chromatic scale
correctly if his life were at stake. He was not rattled by the
request.</p>

<p>"Mike, can you play the accompaniment to 'Greenville'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How does it go? Hum the same fur me so I can catch it."</p>

<p>Chester stood up and "hummed," but without the slightest resemblance
to any tune that the others had ever heard.</p>

<p>"That gits me," commented Mike, "as Teddy O'Rourke said whin
the p'liceman grabbed him. If ye'll sthrike in I'll do my best
to keep wid ye."</p>

<p>"No, sir; I decline to play second fiddle to anyone," and Chester
resumed his seat as if in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>At this moment Nora asked of Mike:</p>

<p>"Did you ever make up music for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have tried once or twice, but didn't do much."</p>

<p>"Oh, please sing us something of your own."</p>

<p>"A leddy on the steamer that brought me over give me some printed
words one day wid the requist that I should try to put some music
to 'em. I furgot the same till after she had gone, but I'll make
the effort if ye all won't be too hard on me."</p>

<p>(This was the only reference that Mike was ever heard to make
to the incidents recorded in the previous chapter.)</p>

<p>And then the Irish lad sang "The Sweet Long Ago."</p>
