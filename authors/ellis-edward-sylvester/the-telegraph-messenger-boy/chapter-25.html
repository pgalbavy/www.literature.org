<p>Ben would have liked to accompany the officers, but that would
have been unprofessional on their part, and he did not make the
request. He waited until they had been gone several minutes, when
he slipped out and passed down the street, determined to see what
was to be seen.</p>

<p>The chief managed the delicate and dangerous business with great
skill.</p>

<p>The first notice the burglars had of danger was from the rear.
They were down behind a screen of dark muslin they had put up,
carefully working at the safe, which contained diamonds and jewelry
of immense value. They had already drilled a considerable distance
into the chilled iron, when the "Philistines descended upon them."</p>

<p>The burglars sprang up like tigers, but they were caught so fairly
that they were borne to the floor and handcuffs clicked around
their wrists in a twinkling. There were only two, and the three
policemen mastered them without difficulty.</p>

<p>But there were two others on the street outside, and they were
quick to discover what was going on within. One of these was Dandy
Sam, who ran forward and peered through the front window. His
companion was at his elbow, and they instantly saw that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>They turned to flee, when they found themselves face to face
with the chief and his aid.</p>

<p>"Hold up your hands!" commanded the chief, leveling his pistol
at the villains.</p>

<p>One of them complied, but Dandy Sam fired point-blank at the
chief, whirled on his heel, and ran like a deer down the street.
The chief was not touched, and pistol in hand he started after
the criminal, leaving his aid to attend to the second one.</p>

<p>Dandy Sam was fleet of foot and was gaining on his pursuer, when
he came face to face with Ben Mayberry, who was hurrying toward
the scene of the burglary with a view of seeing how it terminated.</p>

<p>The two encountered where the lamp-light showed the face of each.
Ben knew the scamp on the instant, from the description given
him, and the sight of the flying rascal told him the truth.</p>

<p>Ben had his pistol in his pocket, but he could not bear the thought
of shooting a person, especially when there was a possible doubt
of the necessity.</p>

<p>Ben compromised matters by darting into the road, where he caught
up a stone weighing fully a pound.</p>

<p>The chief was some distance away shouting "Stop thief!" and firing
his pistol over his head, so there could be no doubt that Dandy
Sam was "wanted."</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry stood about as far from the fugitive as the space
between first and second base&mdash;thirty yards&mdash;when the stone left
his hand like a thunderbolt. As before, it sped true to its aim,
but struck higher than then, sending the scoundrel forward on
his face, and stunning him; only for a minute or so, but this
was sufficient.</p>

<p>While he was in the act of climbing to his feet again, the chief
dropped upon him; there was a click, and Dandy Sam was at the
end of his career of crime, at least for a considerable time to
come.</p>

<p>The chief started for the station-house with his man, whom he
watched closely despite the stunning blow he had received.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the other three officers came in with their
prisoners, who were caught in the very act of committing burglary.</p>

<p>The aid was absent so long that the chief felt uneasy, and started
out in quest of him, but at that moment he appeared with his man.</p>

<p>"He went peaceably enough for a while," explained the aid, "and
then he tried to bribe me to let him go. When he found that wouldn't
work he became ugly, and I had to use my club, but he ain't hurt
much."</p>

<p>His face was bleeding, but Ben Mayberry, with a shock, recognized
the prisoner as G. R. Burkhill, the uncle of Dolly Willard.</p>

<p>The capture of the burglars made great excitement in Damietta,
and the part taken by Ben Mayberry once more placed his name in
everyone's mouth. It was he who discovered the criminals, and
was the direct means of securing the desperado, Dandy Sam, the
leader of the notorious gang.</p>

<p>It was a great shock to all, except a few, to find that Burkhill,
the brother-in-law of Dolly Willard's father, was also one of
the guilty ones. But there were others (and among them Mr. Willard
and Mr. Grandin) who were not surprised in the least. The facts
in this singular affair, as they ultimately came to light, were
as follows:</p>

<p>George R. Burkhill was the black sheep in a most estimable family,
of which Mrs. Willard, the mother of Dolly, was a member. She
was the sister of Burkhill, and the only one who clung to the
bad brother, pronounced incorrigible by everyone else, even when
a small boy. She believed there was some good in him, and, in
the face of protests, she labored to bring him to a sense of right.
It was through her influence that he was saved from condign punishment
for more than one serious offense.</p>

<p>All four of the burglars were duly tried, found guilty, and sentenced
to the penitentiary for ten years. Rather curiously, both Dandy
Sam and Burkhill died during the third year of their imprisonment,
and it is safe to say the world was the gainer thereby.</p>

<p>Some few days after the capture of the burglars, came a glowing
letter from Dolly, who had gone home to New York, in which she
said that her father insisted that Ben should come and make them
a visit, and would accept no excuse for refusing.</p>

<p>"I'll go this time!" exclaimed Ben, knowing he would have no
trouble in obtaining permission to take a brief vacation.</p>

<p>And go he did.</p>
