<p>Billy Woodchuck was a great deal wiser than the Muley Cow had ever
suspected. She had thought she could frighten him. By telling him that
he couldn't see well because he had eaten too much clover, she actually
expected to keep him out of the clover-patch. So she had a great
surprise when he said to her:
</p>
<p>"You must be mistaken. I know there's nothing the matter with my eyes,
because <u>I can see right through you</u>!"
</p><p>The Muley Cow knew then that she had only been wasting words on Billy
Woodchuck. She realized that she hadn't frightened him in the least. And
she felt sure that the moment her back was turned he would scurry into
the clover-patch and nip off as many of the juicy red tops as he could
hold.
</p><p>[Illustration: The Muley Cow Tries to Stop Billy Woodchuck.
</p><p>(<u>Page 80</u>)]
</p><p>So she turned away. And sure enough! The moment she moved aside, out of
his path, Billy Woodchuck made a bee line for the fence. He was under it
in a twinkling.
</p><p>And the Muley Cow knew what was happening to the clover-tops.
</p><p>"There's only one thing to do," she muttered to herself. "I'll speak to
old dog Spot about this Woodchuck youngster."
</p><p>So she did, that very evening. When Spot came to drive the cows home she
told him that there was a young son of Mrs. Woodchuck who spent most of
his time in the clover-patch. "I know you'll be interested to hear the
news," she said.
</p><p>Old Spot shook his head.
</p><p>"It's no use," he growled. "I've known for weeks what was going on in
that field of clover. It's full of Woodchucks. But I never can catch
them. They always have a sentinel--a watcher--who whistles if I try to
surprise them."
</p><p>"But I don't want you to <u>catch</u> them," the Muley Cow explained. "I only
want you to <u>scare</u> them. And most of all, I want you to frighten that
young Billy Woodchuck. He's the greediest of the lot."
</p><p>"I could chase them home a dozen times a day and they'd always come back
again," said old Spot with a sigh.
</p><p>The Muley Cow saw that she could expect little help from him. And it
made her feel a bit peevish.
</p><p>"We need a good, young dog on this farm," she declared. "One that's not
old and fat and lazy!"
</p><p>Now, Spot knew better than to argue with the Muley Cow. But he couldn't
help saying to her, "Let's see! You and I are just the same age, aren't
we?"
</p><p>And for once the Muley Cow wished she had horns to prick somebody with.
