<p></p>

<p>They had the Huitzilopochtli ceremony at night, in the wide yard in
front of the church.  The guard of Huitzilopochtli, in serapes of
black, red, and yellow stripes, striped like tigers or wasps, stood
holding torches of blazing ocote.  A tall bonfire was built, but
unkindled, in the centre of the yard.</p>

<p>In the towers where the bells had been, fires were blazing and the
heavy drum of Huitzilopochtli went rolling its deep, sinister
notes.  It had been sounding all the while since the sun went down.</p>

<p>The crowd gathered under the trees, outside the gates in front of
the church.  The church doors were closed.</p>

<p>There was a bang of four firework cannons exploding simultaneously,
then four rockets shot up into the sky, leaning in the four
directions, and exploding in showers of red, green, white, and
yellow.</p>

<p>The church doors opened, and Cipriano appeared, in his brilliant
serape of Huitzilopochtli, and with three green parrot feathers
erect on his brow.  He was carrying a torch.  He stooped and lit
the big bonfire, then plucked out four blazing brands and tossed
them to four of his men, who stood waiting, naked save for their
black breech-cloths.  The men caught the brands as they flew, and
ran in the four directions, to kindle the four bonfires that
waited, one in each corner of the yard.</p>

<p>The guard had taken off their blankets and blouses, and were naked
to the red sash.  The lighter drum began to beat for the dance, and
the dance began, the half-naked men throwing their blazing torches
whirling in the air, catching them as they came down, dancing all
the while.  Cipriano, in the centre, threw up brand after brand
from the fire.</p>

<p>Now that he was stripped of his blanket, his body was seen painted
in horizontal bars of red and black, while from his mouth went a
thin green line, and from his eyes a band of yellow.</p>

<p>The five fires, built hollow of little towers of ocote faggots,
sent pure flame in a rush up to the dark sky, illuminating the
dancing men, who sang in deep voices as they danced.</p>

<p>The fires rushed rapidly upwards in flame.  The drum beat without
ceasing.  And the men of Huitzilopochtli danced on, like demons.
Meanwhile the crowd sat in the old Indian silence, their black eyes
glittering in the firelight.  And gradually the fires began to die
down, the white facade of the church, that had danced also to the
yellow flames, began to go bluish above, merging into the night,
rose-coloured below, behind the dark shapes that danced to the
sinking fires.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dance ceased, the men threw their serapes around them,
and sat down.  Little ocote fires upon the cane tripods flickered
here and there, in a silence that lasted for some minutes.  Then
the drum sounded, and a man began to sing, in a clear, defiant
voice, the First Song of Huitzilopochtli:</p>

<blockquote><div>'I am Huitzilopochtli,<br />
 The Red Huitzilopochtli,<br />
 The blood-red.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I am Huitzilopochtli,<br />
Yellow of the sun,<br />
Sun in the blood.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I am Huitzilopochtli,<br />
White of the bone,<br />
Bone in the blood.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I am Huitzilopochtli,<br />
With a blade of grass between my teeth.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I am Huitzilopochtli, sitting in the dark.<br />
With my redness staining the body of the dark.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I watch by the fire.<br />
I wait behind men.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>In the stillness of my night<br />
The cactus sharpens his thorn.<br />
The grass feels with his roots for the other sun.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Deeper than the roots of the mango tree<br />
Down in the centre of the earth<br />
Is the yellow, serpent-yellow shining of my sun.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Oh, beware of him!<br />
Oh, beware of me!<br />
Who runs athwart my serpent-flame<br />
Gets bitten and must die.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>I am the sleeping and waking<br />
Of the anger of the manhood of men.<br />
I am the leaping and quaking<br />
Of fire bent back again.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The song came to an end.  There was a pause.  Then all the men of
Huitzilopochtli took it up again, changing the 'I' into 'He.'</p>

<blockquote><div>'He is Huitzilopochtli,<br />
 The Red Huitzilopochtli,<br />
 The blood-red.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is Huitzilopochtli,<br />
Yellow of the sun,<br />
Sun in the blood.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is Huitzilopochtli,<br />
White of the bone,<br />
Bone in the blood.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is Huitzilopochtli,<br />
With a blade of green grass between his teeth.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is Huitzilopochtli, sitting in the dark,<br />
With his redness staining the body of the night.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is watching by the fire.<br />
Waiting behind men.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>In the stillness of his night<br />
Cactuses sharpen their thorns.<br />
Grass feels downwards with his roots.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Deeper than the roots of the mango tree<br />
Down in the centre of the earth<br />
Shines the yellow, serpent-yellow shining of the sun.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Oh, men, take care, take care!<br />
Take care of him and it.<br />
Nor run aslant his rays.<br />
Who is bitten, dies.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>He is Huitzilopochtli, sleeping or waking<br />
Serpent in the bellies of men.<br />
Huitzilopochtli, leaping and quaking<br />
Fire of the passion of men.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The big fires had all died down.  Only the little flames on the
tripods lit up the scene with a ruddy glow.  The guard withdrew to
the outer wall of the yard, holding bayonets erect.  The big drum
was going alone, slowly.</p>

<p>The yard was now a clear space, with the glowing red heaps of the
bonfires, and the ocote flames flapping.  And now was seen a
platform erected against the white wall of the church.</p>

<p>In the silence the big doors of the church opened, and Cipriano
came out, in his bright serape, holding in his hand a bunch of
black leaves, or feathers, and with a tuft of scarlet feathers,
black-tipped, rising from the back of his head.  He mounted the
platform and stood facing the crowd, the light of a torch on his
face and on the brilliant feathers that rose like flames from the
back of his head.</p>

<p>After him came a strange procession: a peon in floppy white
clothes, led prisoner between two of the guards of Huitzilopochtli:
who wore their serapes with red and black and yellow and white and
green stripes: then another peon prisoner: then another: in all,
five, the fifth one tall, limping, and with a red cross painted on
the breast of his white jacket.  Last of all came a woman-prisoner,
likewise between two guards, her hair flowing loose, over a red
tunic.</p>

<p>They mounted the platform.  The peons, prisoners, were placed in a
row, their guards behind them.  The limping peon was apart, with
his two guards behind him: the woman again was apart, her two
guards behind her.</p>

<p>The big drum ceased, and a bugle rang out, a long, loud triumphant
note, repeated three times.  Then the kettle-drums, or the small
tom-toms like kettle-drums, rattled fierce as hail.</p>

<p>Cipriano lifted his hand, and there was silence.</p>

<p>Out of the silence he began to speak, in his short, martial
sentences:</p>

<p>'Man that is man is more than a man.
No man is man till he is more than a man.
Till the power is in him
Which is not his own.</p>

<p>The power is in me from behind the sun,
And from middle earth.
I am Huitzilopochtli.
I am dark as the sunless under-earth,
And yellow as the fire that consumes,
And white as bone,
And red as blood.</p>

<p>But I touched the hand of Quetzalcoatl.
And between our fingers rose a blade of green grass.
I touched the hand of Quetzalcoatl.
Lo! I am lord of the watches of the night
And the dream of the night rises from me like a red feather.</p>

<p>I am the watcher, and master of the dream.
In the dream of the night I see the grey dogs prowling.
Prowling to devour the dream.</p>

<p>In the night the soul of a coward creeps out of him
Like a grey dog whose mouth is foul with rabies,
Creeping among the sleeping and the dreaming, who are lapped in my
   dark,
And in whom the dream sits up like a rabbit, lifting long ears
   tipped with night,
On the dream-slopes browsing like a deer in the dusk.</p>

<p>In the night I see the grey dogs creeping, out of the sleeping men
Who are cowards, who are liars, who are traitors, who have no
   dreams
That prick their ears like a rabbit, or browse in the dark like
   deer,
But whose dreams are dogs, grey dogs with yellow mouths.
From the liars, from the thieves, from the false and treacherous
   and mean
I see the grey dogs creeping out, where my deer are browsing in the
   dark.
Then I take my knife, and throw it upon the grey dog.
And lo! it sticks between the ribs of a man!
The house of the grey dog!</p>

<p>Beware!  Beware!
Of the men and the women who walk among you.
You know not how many are houses of grey dogs.
Men that seem harmless, women with fair words,
Maybe they kennel the grey dog.'</p>

<p>The drums began to beat and the singer began to sing, clear and
pure:</p>

<blockquote><div>THE SONG OF THE GREY DOG<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>'When you sleep and know it not<br />
 The grey dog creeps among you.<br />
 In your sleep, you twist, your soul hurts you.<br />
 The grey dog is chewing your entrails.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Then call on Huitzilopochtli:<br />
The grey dog caught me at the cross-roads<br />
As I went down the road of sleep<br />
And crossed the road of the uneasy.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>The grey dog leapt at my entrails.<br />
Huitzilopochtli, call him off.<br />
Lo! the Great One answers.  Track him down!<br />
Kill him in his unclean house.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Down the road of the uneasy<br />
You track the grey dog home<br />
To his house in the heart of a traitor,<br />
A thief, a murderer of dreams.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>And you kill him there with one stroke,<br />
Crying:  Huitzilopochtli, is this well done?<br />
That your sleep be not as a cemetery<br />
Where dogs creep unclean.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The song ceased, and there was silence.  Then Cipriano beckoned to
the men to bring forward the peon with the black cross painted on
his front and back.  He limped forward.</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'What man is that, limping?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'It is Guillermo, overseer of Don Ram&oacute;n, who betrayed Don
Ram&oacute;n, his master.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Why does he limp?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'He fell from the window on to the rocks.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'What made him wish to betray his master?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'His heart is a grey dog, and a woman, a grey bitch,
enticed him forth.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'What woman enticed the grey dog forth?'</p>

<p>The guards came forward with the woman.</p>

<p>Guards:  'This woman, Maraca, my Lord, with the grey bitch heart.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Is it she, indeed?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'It is she.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'The grey dog, and the grey bitch, we kill, for their
mouths are yellow with poison, Is it well, men of Huitzilopochtli?'</p>

<p>Guards: 'It is very well, my Lord.'</p>

<p>The guards stripped the peon Guillermo of his white clothes,
leaving him naked, in a grey loin-cloth, with a grey-white cross
painted on his naked breast.  The woman, too, had a grey-white
cross painted on her body.  She stood in a short petticoat of grey
wool.</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'The grey dog and the grey bitch shall run no more about
the world.  We will bury their bodies in quick-lime, till their
souls are eaten, and their bodies, and nothing is left.  For lime
is the thirsty bone that swallows even a soul and is not slaked. - 
Bind them with the grey cords, put ash on their heads.'</p>

<p>The guards quickly obeyed.  The prisoners, ash-grey, gazed with
black, glittering eyes, making not a sound.  A guard stood behind
each of them.  Cipriano gave a sign, and quick as lightning the
guards had got the throats of the two victims in a grey cloth, and
with a sharp jerk had broken their necks, lifting them backwards in
one movement.  The grey cloths they tied hard and tight round the
throats, laying the twitching bodies on the floor.</p>

<p>Cipriano turned to the crowd:</p>

<blockquote><div>'The Lords of Life are the Masters of Death.<br />
 Blue is the breath of Quetzalcoatl.<br />
 Red is Huitzilopochtli's blood.<br />
 But the grey dog belongs to the ash of the world.<br />
 The Lords of Life are the Masters of Death.<br />
 Dead are the grey dogs.<br />
 Living are the Lords of Life.<br />
 Blue is the deep sky and the deep water.<br />
 Red is the blood and the fire.<br />
 Yellow is the flame.<br />
 The bone is white and alive.<br />
 The hair of night is dark over our faces.<br />
 But the grey dogs are among the ashes.<br />
 The Lords of Life are the Masters of Death.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Then he turned once more, to the other, imprisoned peons.</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Who are these four?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'Four who came to kill Don Ram&oacute;n.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Four men, against one man?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'They were more than four, my Lord.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'When many men come against one, what is the name of the
many?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'Cowards, my Lord.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Cowards it is.  They are less than men.  Men that are
less than men are not good enough for the light of the sun.  If men
that are men will live, men that are less than men must be put
away, lest they multiply too much.  Men that are more than men have
the judgment of men that are less than men.  Shall they die?'</p>

<p>Guards:  'They shall surely die, my Lord.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Yet my hand has touched the hand of Quetzalcoatl, and
among the black leaves one sprung green, with the colour of
Malintzi.'</p>

<p>An attendant came and lifted Cipriano's serape over his head,
leaving his body bare to the waist.  The guards likewise took off
their serapes.</p>

<p>Cipriano lifted up his fist, in which he held a little tuft of
black feathers, or leaves.</p>

<p>Then he said slowly:</p>

<blockquote><div>Huitzilopochtli gives the black blade of death.<br />
Take it bravely.<br />
Take death bravely.<br />
Go bravely across the border, admitting your mistake.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Determine to go on and on, till you enter the Morning Star.<br />
Quetzalcoatl will show you the way.<br />
Malintzi of the green dress will open the door.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>In the fountain you will lie down.<br />
If you reach the fountain, and lie down<br />
And the fountain covers your face, forever,<br />
You will have departed forever from your mistake.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>And the man that is more than a man in you<br />
Will wake at last from the clean forgetting<br />
And stand up, and look about him,<br />
Ready again for the business of being a man.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>But Huitzilopochtli touched the hand of Quetzalcoatl<br />
And one green leaf sprang among the black.<br />
The green leaf of Malintzi<br />
Who pardons once, and no more.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Cipriano turned to the four peons.  He held out his fist with the
four black twigs, to the first.  This first one, a little man,
peered at the leaves curiously.</p>

<p>'There is no green one,' he said sceptically.</p>

<p>'Good!' said Cipriano.  'Then receive a black.'</p>

<p>And he handed him a black leaf.</p>

<p>'I knew it,' said the man, and he threw the leaf away with contempt
and defiance.</p>

<p>The second man drew a black leaf.  He stood gazing at it, as if
fascinated, turning it round.</p>

<p>The third man drew a leaf whose lower half was green.</p>

<p>'See!' said Cipriano.  'The green leaf of Malintzi!'</p>

<p>And he handed the last black leaf to the last man.</p>

<p>'Have I got to die?' said the last man.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to die, Patr&oacute;n.'</p>

<p>'You played with death, and it has sprung upon you.'</p>

<p>The eyes of the three men were blindfolded with black cloths, their
blouses and pantaloons were taken away.  Cipriano took a bright,
thin dagger.</p>

<p>'The Lords of Life are Masters of Death,' he said in a loud, clear
voice.</p>

<p>And swift as lightning he stabbed the blindfolded men to the heart,
with three swift, heavy stabs.  Then he lifted the red dagger and
threw it down.</p>

<p>'The Lords of Life are Masters of Death,' he repeated.</p>

<p>The guards lifted the bleeding bodies one by one, and carried them
into the church.  There remained only the one prisoner, with the
green leaf.</p>

<p>'Put the green leaf of Malintzi between his brows; for Malintzi
pardons once, and no more,' said Cipriano.</p>

<p>'Yes, my Lord!' replied the guard.</p>

<p>And they led the man away into the church.</p>

<p>Cipriano followed, the last of his guard after him.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the drums began to beat and men came slowly
streaming into the church.  Women were not admitted.  All the
interior was hung with red and black banners.  At the side of the
chancel was a new idol: a heavy, seated figure of Huitzilopochtli,
done in black lava stone.  And round him burned twelve red candles.
The idol held the bunch of black strips, or leaves, in his hand.
And at his feet lay the five dead bodies.</p>

<p>The fire on the altar was flickering high, to the dark statue of
Quetzalcoatl.  On his little throne Ram&oacute;n sat, wearing his blue and
white colours of Quetzalcoatl.  There was another corresponding
throne next him, but it was empty.  Six of the guard of Quetzalcoatl
stood by Ram&oacute;n: but Huitzilopochtli's side of the chancel was empty
save for the dead.</p>

<p>The hard drums of Huitzilopochtli were beating incessantly outside,
with a noise like madness.  Inside was the soft roll of the drum of
Quetzalcoatl.  And the men from the crowd outside thronged slowly
in, between the guard of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>A flute sounded the summons to close the doors.  The drums of
Quetzalcoatl ceased, and from the towers was heard again the wild
bugle of Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p>Then down the centre of the church, in silence, barefoot, came the
procession of Huitzilopochtli, naked save for the black loin-cloths
and the paint, and the scarlet feathers of the head-dresses.
Cipriano had his face painted with a white jaw, a thin band of
green stretched from his mouth, a band of black across his nose,
yellow from his eyes, and scarlet on his brow.  One green feather
rose from his forehead, and behind his head a beautiful head-dress
of scarlet feathers.  A band of red was painted round his breast,
yellow round his middle.  The rest was ash-grey.</p>

<p>After him came his guard, their faces red, black, and white, their
bodies painted as Cipriano's, and a scarlet feather rising from the
back of their head.  The hard, dry drum of Huitzilopochtli beat
monotonously.</p>

<p>As the Living Huitzilopochtli came near the altar steps, the Living
Quetzalcoatl rose and came to meet him.  The two saluted, each
covering his eyes with his left hand for a moment, then touching
fingers with the right hand.</p>

<p>Cipriano stood before the statue of Huitzilopochtli, dipped his
hand in a stone bowl, and giving the loud cry or whoop of
Huitzilopochtli, lifted up his red hand.  His guard uttered the
loud cry, and quickly filed past, each man dipping his hand and
raising his wet, red fist.  The hard drums of Huitzilopochtli
rattled like madness in the church, then fell suddenly silent.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Why is your hand red, Huitzilopochtli, my brother?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'It is the blood of the treacherous, Oh Quetzalcoatl.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'What have they betrayed?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'The yellow sun and the heart of darkness; the hearts of
men, and the buds of women.  While they lived, the Morning Star
could not be seen.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'And are they verily dead?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Verily dead, my Lord.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Their blood is shed?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Yes, my Lord, save that the grey dogs shed no blood.
Two died the bloodless death of the grey dogs, three died in
blood.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Give me the blood of the three, my brother
Huitzilopochtli, to sprinkle the fire.'</p>

<p>Cipriano brought the stone bowl, and the little bunch of black
leaves from Huitzilopochtli's idol.  Ram&oacute;n slowly, gently,
sprinkled a little blood on the fire, with the black leaves.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Darkness, drink the blood of expiation.  Sun, swallow up
the blood of expiation.  Rise, Morning Star, between the divided
sea.'</p>

<p>He gave back the bowl and the leaves to Huitzilopochtli, who placed
them by the black idol.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Thou who didst take the lives of the three,
Huitzilopochtli, my brother, what wilt thou do with the souls?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Even give them to thee, my Lord, Quetzalcoatl, my Lord
of the Morning Star.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Yea, give them to me and I will wrap them in my breath and
send them the longest journey, to the sleep and the far awakening.'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'My Lord is lord of two ways.'</p>

<p>The naked, painted guard of Huitzilopochtli came and carried the
dead bodies of the three stabbed men, carried them on red biers,
and laid them at the foot of the Quetzalcoatl statue.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'So, there is a long way to go, past the sun to the gate of
the Morning Star.  And if the sun is angry he strikes swifter than
a jaguar, and the whirr of the winds is like an angry eagle, and
the upper waters strike in wrath like silver-coloured snakes.  Ah,
three souls, make peace now with the sun and winds and waters, and
go in courage, with the breath of Quetzalcoatl around you like a
cloak.  Fear not and shrink not and fail not; but come to the end
of the longest journey, and let the fountain cover your face.  So
shall all at length be made new.'</p>

<p>When he had spoken to the dead, Ram&oacute;n took incense and threw it on
the fire, so clouds of blue smoke arose.  Then with a censer he
swung the blue smoke over the dead.  Then he unfolded three blue
cloths and covered the dead.  Then the guards of Quetzalcoatl
lifted the biers, and the flute of Quetzalcoatl sounded.</p>

<p>'Salute the Morning Star!' cried Ram&oacute;n, turning to the light beyond
the statue of Quetzalcoatl, and throwing up his right arm in the
Quetzalcoatl prayer.  Every man turned to the light and threw up
his arm in the passion.  And the silence of the Morning Star filled
the church.</p>

<p>The drum of Quetzalcoatl sounded: the guards slowly moved away with
the three blue-wrapped dead.</p>

<p>Then came the voice of the Living Huitzilopochtli:</p>

<p>'Upon the dead grey dogs the face of Quetzalcoatl cannot look.
Upon the corpses of grey dogs rises no Morning Star.  But the fire
of corpses shall consume them.'</p>

<p>There was a sharp rattle of the dry drums of Huitzilopochtli.
Ram&oacute;n remained with his back to the church, his arm upraised to the
Morning Star.  And the guard of Huitzilopochtli lifted the
strangled bodies, laid them on biers, covered them with grey
cloths, and bore them away.</p>

<p>The bugle of Huitzilopochtli sounded.</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'The dead are on their way.  Quetzalcoatl helps them on
the longest journey. - But the grey dogs sleep within the quick-
lime, in the slow corpse-fire. - It is finished.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n dropped his arm and turned to the church.  All men dropped
their hands.  The soft drums of Quetzalcoatl sounded, mingling with
the hard drums of Huitzilopochtli.  Then both guards began to sing
together:</p>

<blockquote><div>HUITZILOPOCHTLI'S WATCH<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>'Red Huitzilopochtli<br />
 Keeps day and night apart.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Huitzilopochtli the golden<br />
Guards life from death, and death from life.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>No grey-dogs, cowards, pass him.<br />
No spotted traitors crawl by,<br />
False fair ones cannot slip through<br />
Past him, from the one to the other.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Brave men have peace at nightfall,<br />
True men look up at the dawn,<br />
Men in their manhood walk out<br />
Into blue day, past Huitzilopochtli.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Red Huitzilopochtli<br />
Is the purifier.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Black Huitzilopochtli<br />
Is doom.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Huitzilopochtli golden<br />
Is the liberating fire.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>White Huitzilopochtli<br />
Is washed bone.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Green Huitzilopochtli<br />
Is Malintzi's blade of grass.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>At the beginning of each stanza, the Guard of Huitzilopochtli
struck their left palm with their scarlet right fist, and the drums
gave a great crash, a terrific splash of noise.  When the song
ended, the drums gradually died down, like subsiding thunder,
leaving the hearts of men re-echoing.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Why is your hand so red, Huitzilopochtli?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'With the blood of slain men, Brother.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n:  'Must it always be red?'</p>

<p>Cipriano:  'Till green-robed Malintzi brings her water-bowl.'</p>

<p>The bugle and the flute both sounded.  The guard of Huitzilopochtli
put out the red candles, one by one, the guard of Quetzalcoatl
extinguished the blue candles.  The church was dark, save for the
small but fierce blue-white light beyond the Quetzalcoatl statue,
and the red smouldering on the altar.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n began slowly to speak:</p>

<blockquote><div>'The dead are on their journey, the way is dark.<br />
 There is only the Morning Star.<br />
 Beyond the white of whiteness,<br />
 Beyond the blackness of black,<br />
 Beyond spoken day,<br />
 Beyond the unspoken passion of night,<br />
 The light which is fed from two vessels<br />
 From the black oil and the white<br />
 Shines at the gate.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>A gate to the innermost place<br />
Where the Breath and the Fountains commingle,<br />
Where the dead are living, and the living are dead.<br />
The deeps that life cannot fathom,<br />
The Source and the End, of which we know<br />
Only that it is, and its life is our life and our death.<br />
All men cover their eyes<br />
Before the unseen.<br />
All men be lost in silence,<br />
Within the noiseless.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The church was utterly still, all men standing with a hand pressed
over their eyes.</p>

<p>Till there was one note of a silver gong, and the green candles of
Malintzi were being lighted in the altar place. - Ram&oacute;n's voice was
heard again:</p>

<blockquote><div>'Like the green candles of Malintzi<br />
 Like a tree in new leaf.<br />
 The rain of blood is fallen, is gone into the earth.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>The dead have gone the long journey<br />
Beyond the star.<br />
Huitzilopochtli has thrown his black mantle<br />
To those who would sleep.<br />
When the blue wind of Quetzalcoatl<br />
Waves softly,<br />
When the water of Malintzi falls<br />
Making a greenness:<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Count the red grains of the Huitzilopochtli<br />
Fire in your hearts, O men.<br />
And blow the ash away.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>For the living live,<br />
And the dead die.<br />
But the fingers of all touch the fingers of all<br />
In the Morning Star.'<br />
</div></blockquote>
