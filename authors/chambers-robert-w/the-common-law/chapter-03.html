<p>One day toward the middle of June Valerie did not arrive on time
at the studio. She had never before been late.</p>

<p>About two o'clock Sam Ogilvy sauntered in, a skull pipe in his
mouth, his hair rumpled:</p>

<p>"It's that damn mermaid of mine," he said, "can't you come up
and look at her and tell me what's the trouble, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Not now. Who's posing?"</p>

<p>"Rita. She's in a volatile humour, too&mdash;fidgets; denies fidgeting;
reproaches me for making her keep quiet; says I draw like a bum
chimney&mdash;no wonder my work's rotten! Besides, she's in a tub of
water, wearing that suit of fish-scales I had made for Violet
Cliland, and she says it's too tight and she's tired of the job,
anyway. Fancy my mental condition."</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't throw you down. Rita is a good sport," said Neville.</p>

<p>"I hope so. It's an important picture. Really, Kelly, it's great
stuff&mdash;a still, turquoise-tinted pool among wet rocks; ebb tide;
a corking little mermaid caught in a pool left by the receding
waves&mdash;all tones and subtle values," he declared, waving his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't paint things in the air with your thumb," said Neville,
coldly. "No wonder Rita is nervous."</p>

<p>"Rita is nervous," said Ogilvy, "because she's been on a bat
and supped somewhere until the coy and rosy dawn chased her homeward.
And your pretty paragon, Miss West, was with the party&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" said Neville, sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Harry Annan, Rita, Burleson, Valerie&mdash;and I don't
know who else. They feasted somewhere east of Coney&mdash;where the
best is like the würst&mdash;and ultimately became full of green corn,
clams, watermelon, and assorted fidgets.... Can't you come up
and look at my picture?"</p>

<p>Neville got up, frowning, and followed Ogilvy upstairs.</p>

<p>Rita Tevis, swathed in a blanket from which protruded a dripping
tinselled fish's tail, sat disconsolately on a chair, knitting
a red-silk necktie for some party of the second part, as yet unidentified.</p>

<p>"Mr. Neville," she said, "Sam has been quarrelling with me every
minute while I'm doing my best in that horrid tub of water. If
anybody thinks it's a comfortable pose, let them try it! I wish
&mdash;I <em>wish</em> I could have the happiness of seeing Sam
afloat in this old fish-scale suit with every spangle sticking
into him and his legs cramped into this unspeakable tail!"</p>

<p>She extended a bare arm, shook hands, pulled up her blanket wrap,
and resumed her knitting with a fierce glance at Ogilvy, who had
attempted an appealing smile.</p>

<p>Neville stood stock-still before the canvas. The picture promised
well; it was really beautiful&mdash;the combined result of several
outdoor studies now being cleverly worked up. But Ogilvy's pictures
never kept their promise.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Neville stood stock-still before the canvas."]</p>

<p>"Also," observed Rita, reproachfully, "<em>I</em> posed <em>en
plein air</em> for those rainbow sketches of his&mdash;and though it
was a lonely cove with a cunningly secluded little crescent beach,
I was horribly afraid of somebody coming&mdash;and besides I got most
cruelly sun-burned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rita! You <em>said</em> you enjoyed that excursion!" exclaimed
Ogilvy, with pathos.</p>

<p>"I said it to flatter that enormous vanity of yours, Sam. I had
a perfectly wretched time."</p>

<p>"What sort of a time did you have last evening?" inquired Neville,
turning from the picture.</p>

<p>"Horrid. Everybody ate too much, and Valerie spooned with a new
man &mdash;I don't remember his name. She went out in a canoe
with him and they sang 'She kissed him on the gangplank when the
boat moved out.'"</p>

<p>Neville, silent, turned to the picture once more. In a low rapid
voice he indicated to Ogilvy where matters might be differently
treated, stepped back a few paces, nodded decisively, and turned
again to Rita:</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for Miss West," he said. "Have you any reason
to think that she might not keep her appointment this morning?"</p>

<p>"She had a headache when we got home," said Rita. "She stayed
with me last night. I left her asleep. Why don't you ring her
up. You know my number."</p>

<p>"All right," said Neville, shortly, and went out.</p>

<p>When he first tried to ring her up the wire was busy. It was
a party wire, yet a curious uneasiness set him pacing the studio,
smoking, brows knitted, until he decided it was time to try again.</p>

<p>This time he recognised her distant voice: "Hello&mdash;hello! <em>Is</em>
that you, Mr. Neville?"</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it <em>is</em> you, Kelly? I hoped you would call me up.
I <em>knew</em> it must be <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. What the deuce is the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no.'"</p>

<p>"<em>What,</em> then?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "When he first tried to ring her up the wire was
busy."]</p>

<p>"I was <em>so</em> sleepy, Kelly. Please forgive me. We had such
a late party&mdash;and it was daylight before I went to bed. Please
forgive me; won't you?"</p>

<p>"When I called you a few minutes ago your wire was busy. Were
you conversing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was talking to José Querida."</p>

<p>"H'm!"</p>

<p>"José was with us last evening.... I went canoeing with him.
He just called me up to ask how I felt."</p>

<p>"Hunh!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Are you annoyed, Louis?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it sounded as though you were irritated. I am
so ashamed at having overslept. Who told you I was here? Oh, Rita,
I suppose. Poor child, she was more faithful than I. The alarm
clock woke her and she was plucky enough to get up&mdash;and I only
yawned and thought of you, and I was <em>so</em> sleepy! Are you
sure you do forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You don't say it very kindly."</p>

<p>"I mean it cordially," he snapped. He could hear her sigh: "I
suppose you do." Then she added:</p>

<p>"I am dressing, Kelly. I don't wish for any breakfast, and I'll
come to the studio as soon as I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take your breakfast first!"</p>

<p>"No, I really don't care for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. Come ahead."</p>

<p>"I will. Good-bye, Kelly, dear."</p>

<p>He rang off, picked up the telephone again, called the great
Hotel Regina, and ordered breakfast sent to his studio immediately.</p>

<p>When Valerie arrived she found silver, crystal, and snowy linen
awaiting her with chilled grapefruit, African melon, fragrant
coffee, toast, and pigeon's eggs poached on Astrakan caviar.</p>

<p>"Oh, Louis!" she exclaimed, enraptured; "I don't deserve this&mdash;but
it is perfectly dear of you&mdash;and I <em>am</em> hungry!... Good-morning,"
she added, shyly extending a fresh cool hand; "I am really none
the worse for wear you see."</p>

<p>That was plain enough. In her fresh and youthful beauty the only
sign of the night's unwisdom was in the scarcely perceptible violet
tint under her thick lashes. Her skin was clear and white and
dewy fresh, her dark eyes unwearied&mdash;her gracefully slender presence
fairly fragrant with health and vigour.</p>

<p>She seated herself&mdash;offered to share with him in dumb appeal,
urged him in delicious pantomime, and smiled encouragingly as
he reluctantly found a chair beside her and divided the magnificent
melon.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good time?" he asked, trying not to speak ungraciously.</p>

<p>"Y-yes.... It was a silly sort of a time."</p>

<p>"Silly?"</p>

<p>"I was rather sentimental&mdash;with Querida."</p>

<p>He said nothing&mdash;grimly.</p>

<p>"I told you last night, Louis. Why couldn't you see me?"</p>

<p>"I was dining out; I couldn't."</p>

<p>She sipped her chilled grapefruit meditatively:</p>

<p>"I hadn't seen you for a week," she laughed, glancing sideways
at him, "and that lonely feeling began about five o'clock; and
I called you up at seven because I couldn't stand it.... But you
wouldn't see me; and so when Rita and the others came in a big
touring car&mdash;do you blame me very much for going with them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Her expression became serious, a trifle appealing:</p>

<p>"My room isn't very attractive," she said, timidly. "It is scarcely
big enough for the iron bed and one chair&mdash;and I get so tired
trying to read or sew every evening by the gas&mdash;and it's very
hot in there."</p>

<p>"Are you making excuses for going?"</p>

<p>"I do not know.... Unless people ask me, I have nowhere to go
except to my room; and when a girl sits there evening after evening
alone it&mdash;it is not very gay."</p>

<p>She tried the rich, luscious melon with much content, and presently
her smile came back:</p>

<p>"Louis, it was a funny party. To begin we had one of those terrible
clambakes&mdash;like a huge, horrid feast of the Middle Ages&mdash;and it
did not agree with everybody&mdash;or perhaps it was because we weren't
middle-aged&mdash;or perhaps it was just the beer. I drank water; so
did the beautiful José Querida.... I think he is pretty nearly
the handsomest man I ever saw; don't you?"</p>

<p>"He's handsome, cultivated, a charming conversationalist, and
a really great painter," said Neville, drily.</p>

<p>She looked absently at the melon; tasted it: "He is very romantic
... when he laughs and shows those beautiful, even teeth.... He's
really quite adorable, Kelly&mdash;and so gentle and considerate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's the Latin in him."</p>

<p>"His parents were born in New York."</p>

<p>She sipped her coffee, tried a pigeon egg, inquired what it was,
ate it, enchanted.</p>

<p>"How thoroughly nice you always are to me, Kelly!" she said,
looking up in the engagingly fearless way characteristic of her
when with him.</p>

<p>"Isn't everybody nice to you?" he said with a shrug which escaped
her notice.</p>

<p>"Nice?" She coloured a trifle and laughed. "Not in <em>your</em>
way, Kelly. In the sillier sense they are&mdash;some of them."</p>

<p>"Even Querida?" he said, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, just like other men&mdash;generously ready for any event. What
self-sacrificing opportunists men are! After all, Kelly," she
added, slipping easily into the vernacular, "it's always up to
the girl."</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so. I knew perfectly well that I had no business
to let Querida's arm remain around me. But&mdash;there was a moon,
Kelly."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'certainly'?"</p>

<p>"Because there <em>was</em> one."</p>

<p>"But you say it in a manner&mdash;" She hesitated, continued her breakfast
in leisurely reflection for a while, then:</p>

<p>"Louis?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Am I too frank with you?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I was just thinking. I tell you pretty nearly
everything. If I didn't have you to tell&mdash;have somebody&mdash;" She
considered, with brows slightly knitted&mdash;"if I didn't have <em>somebody</em>
to talk to, it wouldn't be very good for me. I realise that."</p>

<p>"You need a grandmother," he said, drily; "and I'm the closest
resemblance to one procurable."</p>

<p>The imagery struck her as humorous and she laughed.</p>

<p>"Poor Kelly," she said aloud to herself, "he is used and abused
and imposed upon, and in revenge he offers his ungrateful tormentor
delicious breakfasts. <em>What</em> shall his reward be?&mdash;or must
he await it in Paradise where he truly belongs amid the martyrs
and the blessed saints!"</p>

<p>Neville grunted.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>oh</em>! such a post-Raphaelite scowl! Job won't bow
to you when you go aloft, Kelly. Besides, polite martyrs smile
pleasantly while enduring torment.... What are you going to do
with me to-day?" she added, glancing around with frank curiosity
at an easel which was set with a full-length virgin canvas.</p>

<p>"Portrait," he replied, tersely.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, surprised. He had never before painted her clothed.</p>

<p>From moment to moment, as she leisurely breakfasted, she glanced
around at the canvas, interested in the new idea of his painting
her draped; a trifle perplexed, too.</p>

<p>"Louis," she said, "I don't quite see how you're ever going to
find a purchaser for just a plain portrait of me."</p>

<p>He said, irritably: "I don't have to work for a living <em>every</em>
minute, do I? For Heaven's sake give me a day off to study."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it seems like wasted time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is wasted time?"</p>

<p>"Why just to paint a portrait of me as I am. Isn't it?" She looked
up smilingly, perfectly innocent of any self-consciousness. "In
the big canvases for the Byzantine Theatre you always made my
features too radiant, too glorious for portraits. It seems rather
a slump to paint me as I am&mdash;just a girl in street clothes."</p>

<p>A singular expression passed over his face.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, after a moment&mdash;"just a girl in street clothes.
No clouds, no sky, no diaphanous draperies of silk; no folds of
cloth of gold; no gemmed girdles, no jewels. Nothing of the old
glamour, the old glory; no sunburst laced with mist; no 'light
that never was on sea or land.' ... Just a young girl standing
in the half light of my studio.... And by God!&mdash;if I can not do
it&mdash;the rest is worthless."</p>

<p>Amazed at his tone and expression she turned quickly, set back
her cup, remained gazing at him, bewildered by the first note
of bitterness she had ever heard in his voice.</p>

<p>He had risen and walked to his easel, back partly turned. She
saw him fussing with his palette, colours, and brushes, watched
him for a few moments, then she went away into the farther room
where she had a glass shelf to herself with toilet requisites&mdash;a
casual and dainty gift from him.</p>

<p>When she returned he was still bending over his colour-table;
and she walked up and laid her hand on his shoulder&mdash;not quite
understanding why she did it.</p>

<p>He straightened up to his full stature, surprised, turning his
head to meet a very clear, very sweetly disturbed gaze.</p>

<p>"Kelly, dear, are you unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"You seem to be a little discontented."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Kelly, dear, are you unhappy?'"]</p>

<p>"I hope I am. It's a healthy sign."</p>

<p>"Healthy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. The satisfied never get anywhere.... That Byzanite
business has begun to wear on my nerves."</p>

<p>"Thousands and thousands of people have gone to see it, and have
praised it. You know what the papers have been saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>Under her light hand she felt the impatient movement of his shoulders,
and her hand fell away.</p>

<p>"Don't you care for it, now that it's finished?" she asked, wondering.</p>

<p>"I'm devilish sick of it," he said, so savagely that every nerve
in her recoiled with a tiny shock. She remained silent, motionless,
awaiting his pleasure. He set his palette, frowning. She had never
before seen him like this.</p>

<p>After a while she said, quietly: "If you are waiting for me,
please tell me what you expect me to do, because I don't know,
Kelly."</p>

<p>"Oh, just stand over there," he said, vaguely; "just walk about
and stop anywhere when you feel like stopping."</p>

<p>She walked a few steps at hazard, partly turned to look back
at him with a movement adorable in its hesitation.</p>

<p>"Don't budge!" he said, brusquely.</p>

<p>"Am I to remain like this?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>He picked up a bit of white chalk, went over to her, knelt down,
and traced on the floor the outline of her shoes.</p>

<p>Then he went back, and, with his superbly cool assurance, began
to draw with his brush upon the untouched canvas.</p>

<p>From where she stood, and as far as she could determine, he seemed,
however, to work less rapidly than usual&mdash;with a trifle less decision&mdash;less
precision. Another thing she noticed; the calm had vanished from
his face. The vivid animation, the cool self-confidence, the half
indolent relapse into careless certainty&mdash;all familiar phases
of the man as she had so often seen him painting&mdash;were now not
perceptible. There seemed to be, too, a curious lack of authority
about his brush strokes at intervals&mdash;moments of grave perplexity,
indecision almost resembling the hesitation of inexperience&mdash;and
for the first time she saw in his gray eyes the narrowing concentration
of mental uncertainty.</p>

<p>It seemed to her sometimes as though she were looking at a total
stranger. She had never thought of him as having any capacity
for the ordinary and lesser ills, vanities, and vexations&mdash;the
trivial worries that beset other artists.</p>

<p>"Louis?" she said, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>"What?" he demanded, ungraciously.</p>

<p>"You are not one bit like yourself to-day."</p>

<p>He made no comment. She ventured again:</p>

<p>"Do I hold the pose properly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks," he said, absently.</p>

<p>"May I talk?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather you didn't, Valerie, just at present."</p>

<p>"All right," she rejoined, cheerfully; but her pretty eyes watched
him very earnestly, a little troubled.</p>

<p>When she was tired the pose ended; that had been their rule;
but long after her neck and back and thighs and limbs begged for
relief, she held the pose, reluctant to interrupt him. When at
last she could endure it no longer she moved; but her right leg
had lost not only all sense of feeling but all power to support
her; and down she came with a surprised and frightened little
exclamation&mdash;and he sprang to her and swung her to her feet again.</p>

<p>"Valerie! You bad little thing! Don't you know enough to stop
when you're tired?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He picked up a bit of white chalk ... and traced
on the floor the outline of her shoes."]</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>didn't know I was so utterly gone," she said, bewildered.</p>

<p>He passed his arm around her and supported her to the sofa where
she sat, demure, a little surprised at her collapse, yet shyly
enjoying his disconcerted attentions to her.</p>

<p>"It's your fault, Kelly. You had such a queer expression&mdash;not
at all like you&mdash;that I tried harder than ever to help you&mdash;and
fell down for my pains."</p>

<p>"You're an angel," he said, contritely, "but a silly one."</p>

<p>"A scared one, Kelly&mdash;and a fallen one." She laughed, flexing
the muscles of her benumbed leg: "Your expression intimidated
me. I didn't recognise you; I could not form any opinion of what
was going on inside that very stern and frowning head of yours.
If you look like that I'll never dare call you Kelly."</p>

<p>"Did I seem inhuman?"</p>

<p>"N-no. On the contrary&mdash;very human&mdash;ordinary&mdash;like the usual
ill-tempered artist man, with whom I have learned how to deal.
You know," she added, teasingly, "that you are calm and god-like,
usually&mdash;and when you suddenly became a mere mortal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do with you," he said; "I'll pick you
up and put you to bed."</p>

<p>"I wish you would, Kelly. I haven't had half enough sleep."</p>

<p>He sat down beside her on the sofa: "Don't talk any more of that
god-like business," he growled, "or I'll find the proper punishment."</p>

<p>"Would <em>you</em> punish <em>me</em>, Kelly?"</p>

<p>"I sure would."</p>

<p>"If I displeased you?"</p>

<p>"You bet."</p>

<p>"Really?" She turned partly toward him, half in earnest. "Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;"
but she stopped suddenly, with a light little laugh that lingered
pleasantly in the vast, still room.</p>

<p>She said: "I begin to think that there are two Kellys&mdash;no, <em>one</em>
Kelly and <em>one</em> Louis. Kelly is familiar to me; I seem
to have known him all my life&mdash;the happy part of my life. Louis
I have just seen for the first time&mdash;there at the easel, painting,
peering from me to his canvas with Kelly's good-looking eyes all
narrow with worry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What on earth are you chattering about, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"You and Kelly.... I don't quite know which I like best&mdash;the
dear, sweet, kind, clever, brilliant, impersonal, god-like Kelly,
or this new Louis&mdash;so very abrupt in speaking to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Valerie, dear! Forgive me. I'm out of sorts somehow. It began
&mdash;I don't know&mdash;waiting for you&mdash;wondering if you could be
ill&mdash;all alone. Then that ass, Sam Ogilvy&mdash;oh, it's just oversmoking
I guess, or &mdash;I don't know what."</p>

<p>She sat regarding him, head tipped unconsciously on one side
in an attitude suggesting a mind concocting malice.</p>

<p>"Louis?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You're very attractive when you're god-like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You little wretch!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you're positively dangerous when you're human."</p>

<p>"Valerie! I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The great god Kelly, or the fascinating, fearsome, erring Louis!
Which is it to be? I've an idea that the time is come to decide!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I <em>will</em> call you a god if I like!'"]</p>

<p>Fairly radiating a charming aura of malice she sat back, nursing
one knee, distractingly pretty and defiant, saying: "I <em>will</em>
call you a god if I like!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Valerie," he said, half in earnest; "I've
played grandmother to you long enough, by Heck!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kelly, be lofty and Olympian! Be a god and shame the rest
of us!"</p>

<p>"I'll shamefully resemble one of 'em in another moment if you
continue tormenting me!"</p>

<p>"Which one, great one?"</p>

<p>"Jupiter, little lady. He was the boss philanderer you know."</p>

<p>"What is a philanderer, my Olympian friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one of those Olympian divinities who always began the day
by kissing the girls all around."</p>

<p>"Before breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;after breakfast, Kelly."</p>

<p>"Luncheon and dinner still impend."</p>

<p>"Besides &mdash;I'm not a bit lonely to-day.... I'm afraid I
wouldn't let you, Kel &mdash;I mean Louis."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say 'Kelly'?"</p>

<p>"Kelly is too god-like to kiss."</p>

<p>"Oh! So <em>that's</em> the difference! Kelly isn't human; Louis
is."</p>

<p>"Kelly, to me," she admitted, "is practically kissless.... I
haven't thought about Louis in that regard."</p>

<p>"Consider the matter thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to?" She bent her head, smiling. Then, looking
up with enchanting audacity:</p>

<p>"I really don't know, Mr. Neville. Some day when I'm lonely&mdash;and
if Louis is at home and Kelly is out&mdash;you and I might spend an
evening together on a moonlit lake and see how much of a human
being Louis can be."</p>

<p>She laughed, watching him under the dark lashes, charming mouth
mocking him in every curve.</p>

<p>"Do you think you're likely to be lonely to-night?" he asked,
surprised at the slight acceleration of his pulses.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Besides, you'd be only the great god Kelly to me
this evening. Besides that I'm going to dinner with Querida, and
afterward we're going to see the 'Joy of the Town' at the Folly
Theatre."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," he said, curtly. For a few moments he sat there,
looking interestedly at a familiar door-knob. Then rising: "Do
you feel all right for posing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Alors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Allons, mon dieu!" she laughed.</p>

<p>Work began. She thought, watching him with sudden and unexpected
shyness, that he seemed even more aloof, more preoccupied, more
worried, more intent than before. In this new phase the man she
had known as a friend was now entirely gone, vanished! Here stood
an utter stranger, very human, very determined, very deeply perplexed,
very much in earnest. Everything about this man was unknown to
her. There seemed to be nothing about him that particularly appealed
to her confidence, either; yet the very uncertainty was interesting
her now&mdash;intensely.</p>

<p>This other phase of his dual personality had been so completely
a surprise that, captivated, curious, she could keep neither her
gaze from him nor her thoughts. Was it that she was going to miss
in him the other charm, lose the delight in his speech, his impersonal
and kindly manner, miss the comfortable security she had enjoyed
with him, perhaps after some half gay, half sentimental conflict
with lesser men?</p>

<p>What was she to expect from this brand-new incarnation of Louis
Neville? The delightful indifference, fascinating absent-mindedness
and personal neglect of the other phase? Would he be god enough
to be less to her, now? Man enough to be more than other men?
For a moment she had a little shrinking, a miniature panic lest
this man turn too much like other men. But she let her eyes rest
on him, and knew he would not. Whatever Protean changes might
yet be reserved for her to witness, she came to the conclusion
that this man was a man apart, different, and would not disappoint
her no matter what he turned into.</p>

<p>She thought to herself: "If I want Kelly to lean on, he'll surely
appear, god-like, impersonally nice, and kindly as ever; if I
want Louis to torment and provoke and flirt with&mdash;a little&mdash;a
very little &mdash;I'm quite sure he'll come, too. Whatever else
is contained in Mr. Neville I don't know; but I like him separately
and compositely, and I'm happy when I'm with him."</p>

<p>With which healthy conclusion she asked if she might rest, and
came around to look at the canvas.</p>

<p>As she had stood in silence for some time, he asked her, a little
nervously, what she thought of it.</p>

<p>"Louis &mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Is your opinion unfavourable?"</p>

<p>"N-no. I <em>am</em> like that, am I not?"</p>

<p>"In a shadowy way. It <em>will</em> be like you."</p>

<p>"Am I as&mdash;interesting?"</p>

<p>"More so," he said.</p>

<p>"Are you going to make me&mdash;beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or cut this canvas into shreds."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" she exclaimed with a soft intake of breath; "would you
have the heart to destroy me after you've made me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'd do, Valerie. I never felt just this way
about anything. If I can't paint you&mdash;a human, breathing <em>you</em>&mdash;with
all of you there on the canvas&mdash;<em>all</em> of you, soul, mind,
and body&mdash;all of your beauty, your youth, your sadness, happiness&mdash;your
errors, your nobility&mdash;<em>you</em>, Valerie!&mdash;then there's no
