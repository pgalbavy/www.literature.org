<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>By this time the short July night was drawing to a close, and
there were signs of the coming dawn in the east. All through the
solemn darkness the massacre had continued, and scenes were enacted
on both sides of the Susquehanna which the pen has never placed
on paper, and which to-day come down to us only in the shuddering
legends of those who looked upon and survived to tell of them.</p>

<p>Among the miscreants none was more inhuman than Jake Golcher,
the Tory. But for his strong admiration of the pretty Maggie Brainerd
not one of the little party of fugitives would have survived capture
for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>He was not the first, as he shall not be the last, bad man who
has been restrained from evil by the sweet beauty of some maiden
who, unconsciously to herself, has woven her subtle web around
him.</p>

<p>Had she walked up to him and promised to be his wife on condition
that every one of her friends should be released, he would have
complied, though he might have resorted to treachery afterward
to gratify the demand for revenge on the part of his Indian allies.</p>

<p>But the father of Maggie had repudiated his claim, and the point
at last was reached when he was forced to see that every one of
the fugitives, including Maggie herself, looked upon him with
unspeakable loathing, and they would die before humbling themselves
to him.</p>

<p>"What's the sense of my fooling longer?" he growled, standing
sullenly apart and glowering upon them; "they hate me worse than
Satan himself, and if Maggie should pledge me her hand, that old
father or the brother of her'n wouldn't let her keep her promise.
The Injins have got so mad at my soft-heartedness that they begin
to 'spect me, and they've gone over to t' other side the river
to have their fun there, 'cause there ain't much prospect of gettin'
it here."</p>

<p>The renegade spoke a significant truth, and, looking around,
he was able to count precisely six Senecas who remained with him.
Some of the others who were out hunting in the wood might return,
but the chances were against it, and more than likely they had
gone off to join in the orgies of which we only dare hint.</p>

<p>Striding across the brief space, Jake Golcher paused in front
of Maggie Brainerd and said:</p>

<p>"You have had more mercy to-night than you had a right to expect,
and more than you'll get any longer."</p>

<p>"Why do you talk to me thus?" asked the scared maiden, who could
not fail to understand what he meant; "why do you feel such hatred
of us who have never showed aught but kindness to you?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" interrupted the Tory, angrily; "why do you get over that
stuff to me? I want no more of it. The time for begging mercy
has gone by. If you had treated me right a while ago it would
have been well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jake, how can you?"</p>

<p>The agonized girl was about to rush forward and throw herself
on her knees before the man, when her father, with flashing eye,
interposed.</p>

<p>"Maggie, I forbid you to speak a word to such a scoundrel as
he. Sit down and keep silence."</p>

<p>The obedient girl complied, as she would have done had she known
that death was to be the penalty.</p>

<p>She placed herself beside Eva, and the two, wrapping their arms
about each other, wept in silence.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy, as if conscious the crisis had come, ceased her cooking
and softly seated herself beside them, without a word.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd, proud and defiant as ever, sat bolt upright on
the fallen tree, with arms folded, looking as keenly as an eagle
in the face of the being whom he execrated above any of his kind.</p>

<p>The Senecas watched them all, and it was easy to detect the signs
of impatience among them, for they had been baffled too long of
their prey.</p>

<p>As Jake Golcher retreated a step or two the Indians uttered a
short exclamation of surprise, as well they might, for two figures
strode for-toward out of the gloom in the light of the camp-fire.</p>

<p>One of them was Habakkuk McEwen, who led by the arm Lieutenant
Fred Godfrey, the latter stepping briskly, while a strange half-smile
hovered about his handsome mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd and the rest of the fugitives were thunderstruck,
and totally at a loss to understand the meaning of the spectacle.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they were not kept long in suspense.</p>

<p>The face of Habakkuk was wreathed in an all-embracing smile,
though there was a certain delicacy in his position that prevented
his smile becoming contagious.</p>

<p>"Well, Jake, I've brought you your man!" called out Habakkuk,
in a voice tremulous with triumph and fear.</p>

<p>"You have done well," replied Golcher, as soon as he could recover
his breath; "you have done better than I expected."</p>

<p>"It's all right now, then, ain't it&mdash;that is, with me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; you've earned your freedom and can go. These Injins
won't hurt you."</p>

<p>Golcher made a wave of his hand to the warriors grouped around
and uttered an exclamation that insured immunity to the eccentric
New Englander.</p>

<p>The latter wheeled about and walked straight toward the woods
where his friends were awaiting him.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things for a brave man to do is to
stride deliberately off, without decreasing or augmenting his
gait, when he has every reason to believe that someone is taking
careful aim at him, and that if he doesn't get beyond range in
a brief while he is certain to be punctured.</p>

<p>The expectation of receiving a bullet from the rear will make
the chills creep over the most courageous person, and give an
impetus to his gait like the actual prick of a bayonet.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen walked only a dozen steps when he was so impressed
by the situation, that he forgot his identity. With a howl he
sprang several feet from the ground and dashed off at the top
of his speed into the woods, muttering:</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I can stand it; I believe every Injin squattin'
there was taking aim at me."</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey and Jake Golcher at last stood face to face, and
by the light of the camp-fire looked steadily in the eyes of each
other.</p>

<p>"I'm here," said the lieutenant, in his ordinary voice, though
he carefully measured his words: "Habakkuk McEwen has kept his
pledge, and now I'd like to know what you are going to do about
it."</p>

<p>"You would like to know, eh? Wal, I can soon tell you. I'm going
to turn you over to these Senecas you see around you; one of them
is throwing wood on the fire now; that's for you. More than one
rebel has been roasted, and you are none too good to be served
the same way."</p>

<p>"So you intend to burn me to death, Jacob, do you?"</p>

<p>"Intend to! I'm going to do so, sartin sure&mdash;that is, I'm going
to boss the job, but I've promised to let the redskins have the
fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"That's the idea, is it? And after I'm disposed of, what then?
That is, what is to be done with my friends there?"</p>

<p>"I've no 'bjection to saying," replied the Tory, speaking loud
enough for all to hear, "that the old fellow there and that she
panther, Aunt Peggy, will be served the same way. The two girls
will be taken back to York State with us, and sort of adopted
by the Senecas."</p>

<p>All the individuals referred to heard these words, but no one
moved or stirred. It may truthfully be said that they were so
overcome for the moment that they were speechless.</p>

<p>"That's an imposing programme, Jacob, but, somehow or other,
I think there will be a hitch in carrying it out."</p>

<p>"You think so, eh? Wal, you'll see mighty soon that there ain't
no mistake about it. The fire is burning and about ready&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jacob," said Fred Godfrey in a low voice, but with such significance
that the Tory was transfixed, "I hoped that you would say and
do something that would give me excuse for believing you less
a miscreant than you are, but you have persisted in shutting out
all merciful thoughts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wh-wh-what d-d-do you m-mean?" stammered Golcher, beginning
to feel a giving away in his knees.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I was such a fool as to allow Habakkuk McEwen,
one of my best friends, to bring me back a prisoner to you? You
showed your idiocy in sending him out for me; but it is scarcely
credible that you could really think he would ever show himself
again. But he has, and here I am&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, Jacob, I have the pleasure of informing you that you
are at <em>my</em> mercy, and I have only to raise my hand&mdash;so&mdash;to
have you riddled with bullets."</p>
