When the people of the Emerald City heard that Dorothy had returned to
them every one was eager to see her, for the little girl was a general
favorite in the Land of Oz.  From time to time some of the folk from
the great outside world had found their way into this fairyland, but
all except one had been companions of Dorothy and had turned out to be
very agreeable people.  The exception I speak of was the wonderful
Wizard of Oz, a sleight-of-hand performer from Omaha who went up in a
balloon and was carried by a current of air to the Emerald City.  His
queer and puzzling tricks made the people of Oz believe him a great
wizard for a time, and he ruled over them until Dorothy arrived on her
first visit and showed the Wizard to be a mere humbug.  He was a
gentle, kind-hearted little man, and Dorothy grew to like him afterward.
When, after an absence, the Wizard returned to the Land of Oz, Ozma
received him graciously and gave him a home in a part of the palace.
<P>
In addition to the Wizard two other personages from the outside world
had been allowed to make their home in the Emerald City.  The first
was a quaint Shaggy Man, whom Ozma had made the Governor of the Royal
Storehouses, and the second a Yellow Hen named Billina, who had a fine
house in the gardens back of the palace, where she looked after a
large family.  Both these had been old comrades of Dorothy, so you
see the little girl was quite an important personage in Oz, and the
people thought she had brought them good luck, and loved her next best
to Ozma.  During her several visits this little girl had been the
means of destroying two wicked witches who oppressed the people, and
she had discovered a live scarecrow who was now one of the most
popular personages in all the fairy country.  With the Scarecrow's
help she had rescued Nick Chopper, a Tin Woodman, who had rusted in a
lonely forest, and the tin man was now the Emperor of the Country of
the Winkies and much beloved because of his kind heart.  No wonder the
people thought Dorothy had brought them good luck!  Yet, strange as it
may seem, she had accomplished all these wonders not because she was a
fairy or had any magical powers whatever, but because she was a
simple, sweet and true little girl who was honest to herself and to
all whom she met.  In this world in which we live simplicity and
kindness are the only magic wands that work wonders, and in the Land
of Oz Dorothy found these same qualities had won for her the love and
admiration of the people.  Indeed, the little girl had made many warm
friends in the fairy country, and the only real grief the Ozites had ever
experienced was when Dorothy left them and returned to her Kansas home.
<P>
Now she received a joyful welcome, although no one except Ozma
knew at first that she had finally come to stay for good and all.
<P>
That evening Dorothy had many callers, and among them were such
important people as Tiktok, a machine man who thought and spoke and
moved by clockwork; her old companion the genial Shaggy Man; Jack
Pumpkinhead, whose body was brush-wood and whose head was a ripe
pumpkin with a face carved upon it; the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry
Tiger, two great beasts from the forest, who served Princess Ozma, and
Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E.  This wogglebug was a remarkable
creature.  He had once been a tiny little bug, crawling around in a
school-room, but he was discovered and highly magnified so that he
could be seen more plainly, and while in this magnified condition he
had escaped.  He had always remained big, and he dressed like a dandy
and was so full of knowledge and information (which are distinct
acquirements) that he had been made a Professor and the head of the
Royal College.
<P>
Dorothy had a nice visit with these old friends, and also talked a
long time with the Wizard, who was little and old and withered and
dried up, but as merry and active as a child.  Afterward, she went to
see Billina's fast-growing family of chicks.
<P>
Toto, Dorothy's little black dog, also met with a cordial reception.
Toto was an especial friend of the Shaggy Man, and he knew every one
else.  Being the only dog in the Land of Oz, he was highly respected
by the people, who believed animals entitled to every consideration if
they behaved themselves properly.
<P>
Dorothy had four lovely rooms in the palace, which were always
reserved for her use and were called "Dorothy's rooms."  These
consisted of a beautiful sitting room, a dressing room, a dainty
bedchamber and a big marble bathroom.  And in these rooms were
everything that heart could desire, placed there with loving
thoughtfulness by Ozma for her little friend's use.  The royal
dressmakers had the little girl's measure, so they kept the closets in
her dressing room filled with lovely dresses of every description and
suitable for every occasion.  No wonder Dorothy had refrained from
bringing with her her old calico and gingham dresses!  Here everything
that was dear to a little girl's heart was supplied in profusion, and
nothing so rich and beautiful could ever have been found in the biggest
department stores in America.  Of course Dorothy enjoyed all these
luxuries, and the only reason she had heretofore preferred to live in
Kansas was because her uncle and aunt loved her and needed her with them.
<P>
Now, however, all was to be changed, and Dorothy was really more
delighted to know that her dear relatives were to share in her good
fortune and enjoy the delights of the Land of Oz, than she was to
possess such luxury for herself.
<P>
Next morning, at Ozma's request, Dorothy dressed herself in a pretty
sky-blue gown of rich silk, trimmed with real pearls.  The buckles of
her shoes were set with pearls, too, and more of these priceless gems
were on a lovely coronet which she wore upon her forehead.  "For,"
said her friend Ozma, "from this time forth, my dear, you must assume
your rightful rank as a Princess of Oz, and being my chosen companion
you must dress in a way befitting the dignity of your position."
<P>
Dorothy agreed to this, although she knew that neither gowns nor
jewels could make her anything else than the simple, unaffected little
girl she had always been.
<P>
As soon as they had breakfasted--the girls eating together in Ozma's
pretty boudoir--the Ruler of Oz said:
<P>
"Now, dear friend, we will use the Magic Belt to transport your uncle
and aunt from Kansas to the Emerald City.  But I think it would be
fitting, in receiving such distinguished guests, for us to sit in my
Throne Room."
<P>
"Oh, they're not very 'stinguished, Ozma," said Dorothy.  "They're
just plain people, like me."
<P>
"Being your friends and relatives, Princess Dorothy, they are
certainly distinguished," replied the Ruler, with a smile.
<P>
"They--they won't hardly know what to make of all your splendid
furniture and things," protested Dorothy, gravely.  "It may scare 'em
to see your grand Throne Room, an' p'raps we'd better go into the back
yard, Ozma, where the cabbages grow an' the chickens are playing.
Then it would seem more natural to Uncle Henry and Aunt Em."
<P>
"No; they shall first see me in my Throne Room," replied Ozma,
decidedly; and when she spoke in that tone Dorothy knew it was not
wise to oppose her, for Ozma was accustomed to having her own way.
<P>
So together they went to the Throne Room, an immense domed chamber in
the center of the palace.  Here stood the royal throne, made of solid
gold and encrusted with enough precious stones to stock a dozen
jewelry stores in our country.
<P>
Ozma, who was wearing the Magic Belt, seated herself in the throne,
and Dorothy sat at her feet.  In the room were assembled many ladies
and gentlemen of the court, clothed in rich apparel and wearing fine
jewelry.  Two immense animals squatted, one on each side of the
throne--the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger.  In a balcony high up
in the dome an orchestra played sweet music, and beneath the dome two
electric fountains sent sprays of colored perfumed water shooting up
nearly as high as the arched ceiling.
<P>
"Are you ready, Dorothy?" asked the Ruler.
<P>
"I am," replied Dorothy; "but I don't know whether Aunt Em and Uncle
Henry are ready."
<P>
"That won't matter," declared Ozma.  "The old life can have very
little to interest them, and the sooner they begin the new life here
the happier they will be.  Here they come, my dear!"
<P>
As she spoke, there before the throne appeared Uncle Henry and Aunt
Em, who for a moment stood motionless, glaring with white and startled
faces at the scene that confronted them.  If the ladies and gentlemen
present had not been so polite I am sure they would have laughed at
the two strangers.
<P>
Aunt Em had her calico dress skirt "tucked up," and she wore a faded,
blue-checked apron.  Her hair was rather straggly and she had on a
pair of Uncle Henry's old slippers.  In one hand she held a dish-towel
and in the other a cracked earthenware plate, which she had been
engaged in wiping when so suddenly transported to the Land of Oz.
<P>
Uncle Henry, when the summons came, had been out in the barn "doin'
chores."  He wore a ragged and much soiled straw hat, a checked shirt
without any collar and blue overalls tucked into the tops of his old
cowhide boots.
<P>
"By gum!" gasped Uncle Henry, looking around as if bewildered.
<P>
"Well, I swan!" gurgled Aunt Em in a hoarse, frightened voice.  Then
her eyes fell upon Dorothy, and she said: "D-d-d-don't that look like
our little girl--our Dorothy, Henry?"
<P>
"Hi, there--look out, Em!" exclaimed the old man, as Aunt Em advanced
a step; "take care o' the wild beastses, or you're a goner!"
<P>
But now Dorothy sprang forward and embraced and kissed her aunt and
uncle affectionately, afterward taking their hands in her own.
<P>
"Don't be afraid," she said to them.  "You are now in the Land of Oz,
where you are to live always, and be comfer'ble an' happy.  You'll
never have to worry over anything again, 'cause there won't be
anything to worry about.  And you owe it all to the kindness of my
friend Princess Ozma."
<P>
Here she led them before the throne and continued:
<P>
"Your Highness, this is Uncle Henry.  And this is Aunt Em.  They want
to thank you for bringing them here from Kansas."
<P>
Aunt Em tried to "slick" her hair, and she hid the dish-towel and dish
under her apron while she bowed to the lovely Ozma.  Uncle Henry took
off his straw hat and held it awkwardly in his hands.
<P>
But the Ruler of Oz rose and came from her throne to greet her newly
arrived guests, and she smiled as sweetly upon them as if they had
been a king and queen.
<P>
"You are very welcome here, where I have brought you for Princess
Dorothy's sake," she said, graciously, "and I hope you will be quite
happy in your new home."  Then she turned to her courtiers, who were
silently and gravely regarding the scene, and added: "I present to my
people our Princess Dorothy's beloved Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, who
will hereafter be subjects of our kingdom.  It will please me to have
you show them every kindness and honor in your power, and to join me
in making them happy and contented."
<P>
Hearing this, all those assembled bowed low and respectfully to the
old farmer and his wife, who bobbed their own heads in return.
<P>
"And now," said Ozma to them, "Dorothy will show you the rooms
prepared for you.  I hope you will like them, and shall expect you to
join me at luncheon."
<P>
So Dorothy led her relatives away, and as soon as they were out of the
Throne Room and alone in the corridor, Aunt Em squeezed Dorothy's hand
and said:
<P>
"Child, child!  How in the world did we ever get here so quick?  And
is it all real?  And are we to stay here, as she says?  And what does
it all mean, anyhow?"
<P>
Dorothy laughed.
<P>
"Why didn't you tell us what you were goin' to do?" inquired Uncle Henry,
reproachfully.  "If I'd known about it, I'd 'a put on my Sunday clothes."
<P>
"I'll 'splain ever'thing as soon as we get to your rooms," promised
Dorothy.  "You're in great luck, Uncle Henry and Aunt Em; an' so am I!
And oh! I'm so happy to have got you here, at last!"
<P>
As he walked by the little girl's side, Uncle Henry stroked his
whiskers thoughtfully.  "'Pears to me, Dorothy, we won't make bang-up
fairies," he remarked.
<P>
"An' my back hair looks like a fright!" wailed Aunt Em.
<P>
"Never mind," returned the little girl, reassuringly.  "You won't have
anything to do now but to look pretty, Aunt Em; an' Uncle Henry won't
have to work till his back aches, that's certain."
<P>
"Sure?" they asked, wonderingly, and in the same breath.
<P>
"Course I'm sure," said Dorothy.  "You're in the Fairyland of Oz, now;
an' what's more, you belong to it!"
