<p>Within an hour of the fall of Lu-don and Mo-sar, the chiefs and
principal warriors of Pal-ul-don gathered in the great throneroom of
the palace at A-lur upon the steps of the lofty pyramid and placing
Ja-don at the apex proclaimed him king. Upon one side of the old
chieftain stood Tarzan of the Apes, and upon the other Korak, the
Killer, worthy son of the mighty ape-man.
</p>
<p>And when the brief ceremony was over and the warriors with upraised
clubs had sworn fealty to their new ruler, Ja-don dispatched a trusted
company to fetch O-lo-a and Pan-at-lee and the women of his own
household from Ja-lur.
</p><p>And then the warriors discussed the future of Pal-ul-don and the
question arose as to the administration of the temples and the fate of
the priests, who practically without exception had been disloyal to the
government of the king, seeking always only their own power and comfort
and aggrandizement. And then it was that Ja-don turned to Tarzan. "Let
the Dor-ul-Otho transmit to his people the wishes of his father," he
said.
</p><p>"Your problem is a simple one," said the ape-man, "if you but wish to
do that which shall be pleasing in the eyes of God. Your priests, to
increase their power, have taught you that Jad-ben-Otho is a cruel god,
that his eyes love to dwell upon blood and upon suffering. But the
falsity of their teachings has been demonstrated to you today in the
utter defeat of the priesthood.
</p><p>"Take then the temples from the men and give them instead to the women
that they may be administered in kindness and charity and love. Wash
the blood from your eastern altar and drain forever the water from the
western.
</p><p>"Once I gave Lu-don the opportunity to do these things but he ignored
my commands, and again is the corridor of sacrifice filled with its
victims. Liberate these from every temple in Pal-ul-don. Bring
offerings of such gifts as your people like and place them upon the
altars of your god. And there he will bless them and the priestesses of
Jad-ben-Otho can distribute them among those who need them most."
</p><p>As he ceased speaking a murmur of evident approval ran through the
throng. Long had they been weary of the avarice and cruelty of the
priests and now that authority had come from a high source with a
feasible plan for ridding themselves of the old religious order without
necessitating any change in the faith of the people they welcomed it.
</p><p>"And the priests," cried one. "We shall put them to death upon their
own altars if it pleases the Dor-ul-Otho to give the word."
</p><p>"No," cried Tarzan. "Let no more blood be spilled. Give them their
freedom and the right to take up such occupations as they choose."
</p><p>That night a great feast was spread in the pal-e-don-so and for the
first time in the history of ancient Pal-ul-don black warriors sat in
peace and friendship with white. And a pact was sealed between Ja-don
and Om-at that would ever make his tribe and the Ho-don allies and
friends.
</p><p>It was here that Tarzan learned the cause of Ta-den's failure to attack
at the stipulated time. A messenger had come from Ja-don carrying
instructions to delay the attack until noon, nor had they discovered
until almost too late that the messenger was a disguised priest of
Lu-don. And they had put him to death and scaled the walls and come to
the inner temple court with not a moment to spare.
</p><p>The following day O-lo-a and Pan-at-lee and the women of Ja-don's
family arrived at the palace at A-lur and in the great throneroom
Ta-den and O-lo-a were wed, and Om-at and Pan-at-lee.
</p><p>For a week Tarzan and Jane and Korak remained the guests of Ja-don, as
did Om-at and his black warriors. And then the ape-man announced that
he would depart from Pal-ul-don. Hazy in the minds of their hosts was
the location of heaven and equally so the means by which the gods
traveled between their celestial homes and the haunts of men and so no
questionings arose when it was found that the Dor-ul-Otho with his mate
and son would travel overland across the mountains and out of
Pal-ul-don toward the north.
</p><p>They went by way of the Kor-ul-JA accompanied by the warriors of that
tribe and a great contingent of Ho-don warriors under Ta-den. The king
and many warriors and a multitude of people accompanied them beyond the
limits of A-lur and after they had bid them good-bye and Tarzan had
invoked the blessings of God upon them the three Europeans saw their
simple, loyal friends prostrate in the dust behind them until the
cavalcade had wound out of the city and disappeared among the trees of
the nearby forest.
</p><p>They rested for a day among the Kor-ul-JA while Jane investigated the
ancient caves of these strange people and then they moved on, avoiding
the rugged shoulder of Pastar-ul-ved and winding down the opposite
slope toward the great morass. They moved in comfort and in safety,
surrounded by their escort of Ho-don and Waz-don.
</p><p>In the minds of many there was doubtless a question as to how the three
would cross the great morass but least of all was Tarzan worried by the
problem. In the course of his life he had been confronted by many
obstacles only to learn that he who will may always pass. In his mind
lurked an easy solution of the passage but it was one which depended
wholly upon chance.
</p><p>It was the morning of the last day that, as they were breaking camp to
take up the march, a deep bellow thundered from a nearby grove. The
ape-man smiled. The chance had come. Fittingly then would the
Dor-ul-Otho and his mate and their son depart from unmapped Pal-ul-don.
</p><p>He still carried the spear that Jane had made, which he had prized so
highly because it was her handiwork that he had caused a search to be
made for it through the temple in A-lur after his release, and it had
been found and brought to him. He had told her laughingly that it
should have the place of honor above their hearth as the ancient
flintlock of her Puritan grandsire had held a similar place of honor
above the fireplace of Professor Porter, her father.
</p><p>At the sound of the bellowing the Ho-don warriors, some of whom had
accompanied Tarzan from Ja-don's camp to Ja-lur, looked questioningly
at the ape-man while Om-at's Waz-don looked for trees, since the GRYF
was the one creature of Pal-ul-don which might not be safely
encountered even by a great multitude of warriors. Its tough, armored
hide was impregnable to their knife thrusts while their thrown clubs
rattled from it as futilely as if hurled at the rocky shoulder of
Pastar-ul-ved.
</p><p>"Wait," said the ape-man, and with his spear in hand he advanced toward
the GRYF, voicing the weird cry of the Tor-o-don. The bellowing ceased
and turned to low rumblings and presently the huge beast appeared. What
followed was but a repetition of the ape-man's previous experience with
these huge and ferocious creatures.
</p><p>And so it was that Jane and Korak and Tarzan rode through the morass
that hems Pal-ul-don, upon the back of a prehistoric triceratops while
the lesser reptiles of the swamp fled hissing in terror. Upon the
opposite shore they turned and called back their farewells to Ta-den
and Om-at and the brave warriors they had learned to admire and
respect. And then Tarzan urged their titanic mount onward toward the
north, abandoning him only when he was assured that the Waz-don and the
Ho-don had had time to reach a point of comparative safety among the
craggy ravines of the foothills.
</p><p>Turning the beast's head again toward Pal-ul-don the three dismounted
and a sharp blow upon the thick hide sent the creature lumbering
majestically back in the direction of its native haunts. For a time
they stood looking back upon the land they had just quit--the land of
Tor-o-don and GRYF; of JA and JATO; of Waz-don and Ho-don; a primitive
land of terror and sudden death and peace and beauty; a land that they
all had learned to love.
</p><p>And then they turned once more toward the north and with light hearts
and brave hearts took up their long journey toward the land that is
best of all--home.
