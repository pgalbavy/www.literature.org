<P>

In considering the
distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first
great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the
dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted
for by their climatal and other physical conditions. Of late, almost
every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion.
The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its truth: for
if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost
continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental
divisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old
Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the
central parts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we
meet with the most diversified conditions; the most humid districts,
arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes,
and great rivers, under almost every temperature. There is hardly a
climate or condition in the Old World which cannot be paralleled in
the New   at least as closely as the same species generally
require; for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms
confined to any small spot, having conditions peculiar in only a
slight degree; for instance, small areas in the Old World could be
pointed out hotter than any in the New World, yet these are not
inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora. Notwithstanding this
parallelism in the conditions of the Old and New Worlds, how widely
different are their living productions!
<P>
In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts
of land in Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between
latitudes 25&deg; and 35&deg;, we shall find parts extremely similar in
all their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three
faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or again we may compare the
productions of South America south of lat. 35&deg; with those north of
25&deg;, which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate, and
they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other,
than they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly
the same climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the
inhabitants of the sea.
<P>
A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that
barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a
close and important manner to the differences between the productions
of various regions.  We see this in the great difference of nearly all
the terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in
the northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a
slightly different climate, there might have been free migration for
the northern temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic
productions. We see the same fact in the great difference between the
inhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South America under the same
latitude: for these countries are almost as much isolated from each
other as is possible. On each continent, also, we see the same fact;
for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and
of great deserts, and sometimes even of large rivers, we find
different productions; though as mountain chains, deserts, &amp;c.,
are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long as the oceans
separating continents, the differences are very inferior in degree to
those characteristic of distinct continents.
<P>
Turning to the sea, we find the same law. No two marine faunas are
more distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than
those of the eastern and western shores of South and Central America;
yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow, but
impassable, isthmus of panama. Westward of the shores of America, a
wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a
halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind,
and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the
Pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. So that here three
marine faunas range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not
far from each other, under corresponding climates; but from being
separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or
open sea, they are wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding
still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts
of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have
innumerable islands as halting-places, until after travelling over a
hemisphere we come to the shores of Africa; and over this vast space
we meet with no well-defined and distinct marine faunas. Although
hardly one shell, crab or fish is common to the above-named three
approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and the eastern
Pacific islands, yet many fish range from the Pacific into the Indian
Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the
Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa, on almost exactly opposite
meridians of longitude.
<P>
A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is
the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though
the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations.
It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers
innumerable instances. Nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for
instance, from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner
in which successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, yet
clearly related, replace each other. He hears from closely allied, yet
distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests
similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in
nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of Magellan are
inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the
plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a
true ostrich or emeu, like those found in Africa and Australia under
the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata, we see the agouti
and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and
rabbits and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but they plainly
display an American type of  structure.  We ascend the
lofty peaks of the Cordillera and we find an alpine species of
bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or
musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the American type.
Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to the islands
off the American shore, however much they may differ in geological
structure, the inhabitants, though they may be all peculiar species,
are essentially American. We may look back to past ages, as shown in
the last chapter, and we find American types then prevalent on the
American continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts
some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and time, over the
same areas of land and water, and independent of their physical
conditions. The naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not led
to inquire what this bond is.
<P>
This bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which
alone, as far as we positively know, produces organisms quite like,
or, as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other. The
dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be
attributed to modification through natural selection, and in a quite
subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical
conditions.  The degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration
of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having
been effected with more or less ease, at periods more or less remote;
  on the nature and number of the former immigrants; -- and
on their action and reaction, in their mutual struggles for life;
  the relation of organism to organism being, as I have already
often remarked, the most important of all relations. Thus the high
importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does
time for the slow process of modification through natural selection.
Widely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already
triumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes
will have the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread
into new countries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new
conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and
improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious, and
will produce groups of modified descendants. On this principle of
inheritance with modification, we can understand how it
is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are
confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the
case.
<P>
I believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of
necessary development. As the variability of each species is an
independent property, and will be taken advantage of by natural
selection, only so far as it profits the individual in its complex
struggle for life, so the degree of modification in different species
will be no uniform quantity. If, for instance, a number of species,
which stand in direct competition with each other, migrate in a body
into a new and afterwards isolated country, they will be little liable
to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can
do anything. These principles come into play only by bringing
organisms into new relations with each other, and in a lesser degree
with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the last
chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from
an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have
migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified.
<P>
On these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same
genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must
originally have proceeded from the same source, as they have descended
from the same progenitor. In the case of those species, which have
undergone during whole geological periods but little modification,
there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated
from the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatal
changes which will have supervened since ancient times, almost any
amount of migration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we
have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced
within comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this
head. It is also obvious that the individuals of the same species,
though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have
proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for,
as explained in the last chapter, it is incredible that individuals
identically the same should ever have been produced through natural
selection from parents specifically distinct.
<P>
We are thus brought to the question which has been
largely discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been
created at one or more points of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly
there are very many cases of extreme difficulty, in understanding how
the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to
the several distant and isolated points, where now found. Nevertheless
the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within
a single region captivates the mind. He who rejects it, rejects the
<I>vera causa</I> of ordinary generation with
subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is
universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a
species is continuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points
so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that
the space could not be easily passed over by migration, the fact is
given as something remarkable and exceptional. The capacity of
migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial
mammals, than perhaps in any other organic beings; and, accordingly,
we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant
points of the world. No geologist will feel any difficulty in such
cases as Great Britain having been formerly united to Europe, and
consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. But if the same species
can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single
mammal common to Europe and Australia or South America? The conditions
of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European animals
and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia; and some
of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant
points of the northern and southern hemispheres? The answer, as I
believe, is, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some
plants, from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the
vast and broken interspace. The great and striking influence which
barriers of every kind have had on distribution, is intelligible only
on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on
one side alone, and have not been able to migrate to the other side.
Some few families, many sub-families, very many genera, and a still
greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region;
and it has been observed by several naturalists, that the
most natural genera, or those genera in which the species are most
closely related to each other, are generally local, or confined to one
area. What a strange anomaly it would be, if, when coming one step
lower in the series, to the individuals of the same species, a
directly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local, but had
been produced in two or more distinct areas!
<P>
Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the
view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and
having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of
migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted,
is the most probable.  Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we
cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point
to the other. But the geographical and climatal changes, which have
certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have
interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of
many species.  So that we are reduced to consider whether the
exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a
nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by
general considerations, that each species has been produced within one
area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be
hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same
species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a
moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such
cases.  But after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of
the most striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same
species on the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant
points in the arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the
following chapter), the wide distribution of freshwater productions;
and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands
and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open
sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated
points of the earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on
the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace;
then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and
geographical changes and various occasional means of transport,
the belief that this has been the universal law, seems to me
incomparably the safest.
<P>
In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to
consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several
distinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended
from a common progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification
during some part of their migration) from the area inhabited by their
progenitor. If it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that
a region, of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or
belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has
probably received at some former period immigrants from this other
region, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly understand,
on the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region
should be related to those of another region, whence it has been
stocked. A volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the
distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably
receive from it in the course of time a few colonists, and their
descendants, though modified, would still be plainly related by
inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent.  Cases of this nature
are common, and are, as we shall hereafter more fully see,
inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This view of the
relation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ
much (by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately
advanced in an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes,
that `every species has come into existence coincident both in space
and time with a pre-existing closely allied species.' And I now know
from correspondence, that this coincidence he attributes to generation
with modification.
<P>
The previous remarks on `single and multiple centres of creation'
do not directly bear on another allied question,   namely
whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a
single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors
suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created. With those
organic beings which never intercross (if such exist), the species, on
my theory, must have descended from a succession of improved
varieties, which will never have blended with other
individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so
that, at each successive stage of modification and improvement, all
the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single
parent. But in the majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which
habitually unite for each birth, or which often intercross, I believe
that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the
species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that
many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing, and the
whole amount of modification will not have been due, at each stage, to
descent from a single parent. To illustrate what I mean: our English
racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed; but
they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any
single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many
individuals during many generations.
<P>
Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected
as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of
`single centres of creation,' I must say a few words on the means of
dispersal.
<P>
<H4>Means of Dispersal</H4> 
<P>
Sir C. Lyell and
other authors have ably treated this subject. I can give here only the
briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change of climate must
have had a powerful influence on migration: a region when its climate
was different may have been a high road for migration, but now be
impassable; I shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of
the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must also
have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two
marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged,
and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where
the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected
islands or possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed
terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. No geologist
will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the
period of existing organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the
islands in the Atlantic must recently have been connected with Europe
or Africa, and Europe likewise with America. Other
authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and have
united almost every island to some mainland. If indeed the arguments
used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a
single island exists which has not recently been united to some
continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the
same species to the most distant points, and removes many a
difficulty: but to the best of any judgement we are not authorised in
admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of
existing species. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of
great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast
changes in their position and extension, as to have united them within
the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic
islands. I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now
buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for
plants and for many animals during their migration. In the
coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as I
believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. Whenever it
is fully admitted, as I believe it will some day be, that each species
has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time
we know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall
be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the
land. But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the
recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been
continuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with
the many existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution,
  such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the
opposite sides of almost every continent,   the close relation
of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their
present inhabitants,   a certain degree of relation (as we shall
hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the depth of
the sea,   these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the
admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the
recent period, as are necessitated in the view advanced by Forbes and
admitted by his many followers. The nature and relative proportions of
the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to
the belief of their former continuity with continents.
Nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the
admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents;   if
they had originally existed as mountain-ranges on the land, some at
least of the islands would have been formed, like other
mountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous
or other such rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic
matter.
<P>
I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but
which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution.
I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or
that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for
transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said
to be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr Berkeley's aid, a
few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the
injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of 87
kinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived
an immersion of 137 days. For convenience sake I chiefly tried small
seeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few
days, they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether
or not they were injured by the salt-water. Afterwards I tried some
larger fruits, capsules, &amp;c., and some of these floated for a long
time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of
green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might
wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the
banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea.
Hence I was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe
fruit, and to place them on sea water. The majority sank quickly, but
some which whilst green floated for a very short time, when dried
floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately,
but when dried, they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted
they germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23
days, when dried it floated for 85 days, and the seeds afterwards
germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when
dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards germinated.
Altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28 days,
and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period.
So that as 64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and
as 18/94 plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in
the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28
days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts, we may
conclude that the seeds of 14/100 plants of any country might be
floated by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power
of germination. In Johnston's physical Atlas, the average rate of the
several Atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running
at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of
14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924
miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a
favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.
<P>
Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but
in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the
actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air
like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from
mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants
which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average
length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious
action of the salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry
the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen,
would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result
was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable
of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves
would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement
as in our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume
that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been
dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and
would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating
longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or
fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and Alph. de
Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.
<P>
But seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift
timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the
widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in
the Pacific, procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of
drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find on
examination, that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the
roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed
in their interstices and behind them,   so perfectly that not a
particle could be washed away in the longest transport: out of one
small portion of earth thus <I>completely</I>
enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous
plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation.
Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the
sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many
kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas
and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in
sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had
floated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly
all germinated.
<P>
Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the
transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how
frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances
across the ocean. We may I think safely assume that under such
circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour;
and some authors have given a far higher estimate. I have never seen
an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a
bird; but hard seeds of fruit will pass uninjured through even the
digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two months, I picked up
in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds,
and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which I tried, germinated.
But the following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not
secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as I know by
trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and
devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all
the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. A
bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500
miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the
contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Mr
Brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying
carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks on the 
English coast destroyed so many on their arrival. Some hawks
and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve
to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments
made in the Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination.
Some seeds of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet
germinated after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the
stomachs of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after
having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours.  Freshwater
fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water plants: fish are
frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported
from place to place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of
dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and
pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either rejected
the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of
these seeds retained their power of germination. Certain seeds,
however, were always killed by this process.
<P>
Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I
can show that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I
removed twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a
partridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the
seed of a vetch. Thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great
distances; for many facts could be given showing that soil almost
everywhere is charged with seeds. Reflect for a moment on the millions
of quails which annually cross the Mediterranean; and can we doubt
that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few
minute seeds? But I shall presently have to recur to this subject.
<P>
As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and
stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a
land-bird, I can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have
transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic
regions, as suggested by Lyell; and during the Glacial period from one
part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the
large number of the species of plants common to Europe, in comparison
with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and
(as remarked by Mr H. C. Watson) from the somewhat northern character
of the flora in comparison with the latitude, I suspected
that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds, during
the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to
inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and
he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other
rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago. Hence we may safely
infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores
of these mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may
have brought thither the seeds of northern plants.
<P>
Considering that the several above means of transport, and that
several other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have
been in action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of
years, it would I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not
thus become widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes
called accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of
the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of
wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would
carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their
vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of
seawater; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of
birds. These means, however, would suffice for occasional transport
across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to
island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one
distant continent to another. The floras of distant continents would
not by such means become mingled in any great degree; but would remain
as distinct as we now see them to be. The currents, from their course,
would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they
might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western shores,
where, if not killed by so long an immersion in salt-water, they could
not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are
blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the
western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported
by these wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to
their feet, which is in itself a rare accident. Even in this case, how
small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable
soil, and coming to maturity!  But it would be a great error to argue
that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as
far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this),
received within the last few centuries, through occasional means of
transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a
poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland,
would not receive colonists by similar means. I do not doubt that out
of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less
well-stocked than Britain, scarcely more than one would be so well
fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. But this, as it
seems to me, is no valid argument against what would be effected by
occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological
time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and before it
had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with
few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every
seed, which chanced to arrive, would be sure to germinate and survive.
</P>
<H4>Dispersal during the Glacial period</H4>
<P>
The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits,
separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the
Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking
cases known of the same species living at distant points, without the
apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other.
It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants
living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the
extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that
the plants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America,
are all the same with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as
we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe.
Even as long ago as 1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the
same species must have been independently created at several distinct
points; and we might have remained in this same belief, had not
Agassiz and others called vivid attention to the Glacial period,
which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation of
these facts. We have evidence of almost every conceivable kind,
organic and inorganic, that within a very recent
geological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an
Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their
tale more plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with
their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the
icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly
has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic
moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize.
Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders, and
rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly reveal a
former cold period.
<P>
The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of
the inhabitants of Europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by
Edward Forbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall follow the
changes more readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly
on, and then pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and
as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and
ill-fitted for their former more temperate inhabitants, the latter
would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places.
The inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time
travel southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which case
they would perish. The mountains would become covered with snow and
ice, and their former Alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains.
By the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should have a
uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of Europe,
as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain.
The now temperate regions of the United States would likewise be
covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be nearly the
same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants,
which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are
remarkably uniform round the world. We may suppose that the Glacial
period came on a little earlier or later in North America than in
Europe, so will the southern migration there have been a little
earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the final
result.
<P>
As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,
closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of
the more temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the
bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared
and thawed ground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth
increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey.
Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species,
which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old
and New Worlds, would be left isolated on distant mountain-summits
(having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic
regions of both hemispheres.
<P>
Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so
immensely remote as on the mountains of the United States and of
Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of
each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms
living due north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the
cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will
generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for
example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr H. C. Watson, and those of the
Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the
plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to
Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of
that country.  These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly
well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to
explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the
Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in
other regions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we
may almost conclude without other evidence, that a colder climate
permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts,
since become too warm for their existence.
<P>
If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any
degree warmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States
believe to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the
fossil Gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a
very late period have marched a little further north, and subsequently
have retreated to their present homes; but I have met with no
satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated
slightly warmer period, since the Glacial period.
<P>
The arctic forms, during their long southern migration and
re-migration northward, will have been exposed to nearly the same
climate, and, as is especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a
body together; consequently their mutual relations will not have been
much disturbed, and, in accordance with the principles inculcated in
this volume, they will not have been liable to much modification. But
with our Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the
returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of
the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is
not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on
mountain ranges distant from each other, and have survived there ever
since; they will, also, in all probability have become mingled with
ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains
before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during its
coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains;
they will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different climatal
influences. Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree
disturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification;
and this we find has been the case; for if we compare the present
Alpine plants and animals of the several great European
mountain-ranges, though very many of the species are identically the
same, some present varieties, some are ranked as doubtful forms, and
some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species.
<P>
In illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during the
Glacial period, I assumed that at its commencement the arctic
productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the
present day. But the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only
to strictly arctic forms, but also to many sub-arctic and to some few
northern temperate forms, for some of these are the same on the lower
mountains and on the plains of North America and Europe; and it may be
reasonably asked how I account for the necessary degree of uniformity
of the sub-arctic and northern temperate forms round the world, at the
commencement of the Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic
and northern temperate productions of the Old and New
Worlds are separated from each other by the Atlantic Ocean and by the
extreme northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when
the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards
than at present, they must have been still more completely separated
by wider spaces of ocean. I believe the above difficulty may be
surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an
opposite nature. We have good reason to believe that during the newer
Pliocene period, before the Glacial epoch, and whilst the majority of
the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now, the
climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence we may suppose that
the organisms now living under the climate of latitude 60&deg;, during
the Pliocene period lived further north under the Polar Circle, in
latitude 66&deg;-67&deg;; and that the strictly arctic productions then
lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now if we look at a
globe, we shall see that under the Polar Circle there is almost
continuous land from western Europe, through Siberia, to eastern
America. And to this continuity of the circumpolar land, and to the
consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate,
I attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the sub-arctic and
northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period
anterior to the Glacial epoch.
<P>
Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have
long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected
to large, but partial oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to
extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still
warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of
the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous
circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old
and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate
became less warm, long before the commencement of the Glacial period.
We now see, as I believe, their descendants, mostly in a modified
condition, in the central parts of Europe and the United States. On
this view we can understand the relationship, with very little
identity, between the productions of North America and Europe,  
a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance
of the two areas, and their separation by the Atlantic Ocean.
We can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several
observers, that the productions of Europe and America during the later
tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are
at the present time; for during these warmer periods the northern
parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously
united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by
cold, for the inter-migration of their inhabitants.
<P>
During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon
as the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds,
migrated south of the Polar Circle, they must have been completely cut
off from each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate
productions are concerned, took place long ages ago. And as the plants
and animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the
one great region with the native American productions, and have had to
compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the
Old World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for much
modification,   for far more modification than with the Alpine
productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the
several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two Worlds.
Hence it has come, that when we compare the now living productions of
the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few
identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more plants
are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every great
class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races,
and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or
representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as
specifically distinct.
<P>
 As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern
migration of a marine fauna, which during the Pliocene or even a
somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous
shores of the Polar Circle, will account, on the theory of
modification, for many closely allied forms now living in areas
completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the presence of
many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and
western shores of temperate North America; and the still
more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in
Dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine animals, in the
Mediterranean and in the seas of Japan,   areas now separated by
a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean.
<P>
These cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants
of seas now disjoined, and likewise of the past and present
inhabitants of the temperate lands of North America and Europe, are
inexplicable on the theory of creation. We cannot say that they have
been created alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical
conditions of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain
parts of South America with the southern continents of the Old World,
we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical
conditions, but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.
<P>
But we must return to our more immediate subject, the Glacial
period. I am convinced that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In
Europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period, from the
western shores of Britain to the Oural range, and southward to the
Pyrenees. We may infer, from the frozen mammals and nature of the
mountain vegetation, that Siberia was similarly affected. Along the
Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of
their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr Hooker saw maize growing
on gigantic ancient moraines. South of the equator, we have some
direct evidence of former glacial action in New Zealand; and the same
plants, found on widely separated mountains in this island, tell the
same story. If one account which has been published can be trusted, we
have direct evidence of glacial action in the southeastern corner of
Australia.
<P>
Looking to America; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of
rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat.
36&deg;-37&deg;, and on the shores of the Pacific, where the climate is now
so different, as far south as lat. 46&deg;; erratic boulders have, also,
been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera of Equatorial
South America, glaciers once extended far below their present level.
In central Chile I was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of
detritus, about 800 feet in height, crossing a valley of
the Andes; and this I now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine, left
far below any existing glacier. Further south on both sides of the
continent, from lat. 41&deg; to the southernmost extremity, we have the
clearest evidence of former glacial action, in huge boulders
transported far from their parent source.
<P>
We do not know that the Glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at
these several far distant points on opposite sides of the world. But
we have good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was
included within the latest geological period. We have, also, excellent
evidence, that it endured for an enormous time, as measured by
years, at each point. The cold may have come on, or have ceased,
earlier at one point of the globe than at another, but seeing that it
endured for long at each, and that it was contemporaneous in a
geological sense, it seems to me probable that it was, during a part
at least of the period, actually simultaneous throughout the world.
Without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we may at least admit
as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern
and western sides of North America, in the Cordillera under the
equator and under the warmer temperate zones, and on both sides of the
southern extremity of the continent. If this be admitted, it is
difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world
was at this period simultaneously cooler. But it would suffice for my
purpose, if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain
broad belts of longitude.
<P>
On this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal
belts, having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light
can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied
species. In America, Dr Hooker has shown that between forty and fifty
of the flowering plants of Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable
part of its scanty flora, are common to Europe, enormously remote as
these two points are; and there are many closely allied species. On
the lofty mountains of equatorial America a host of peculiar species
belonging to European genera occur. On the highest mountains of
Brazil, some few European genera were found by Gardner, which do not
exist in the wide intervening hot countries. So on the Silla of
Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging 
to genera characteristic of the Cordillera. On the mountains
of Abyssinia, several European forms and some few representatives of
the peculiar flora of the Cape of Good Hope occur. At the Cape of Good
Hope a very few European species, believed not to have been introduced
by man, and on the mountains, some few representative European forms
are found, which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts
of Africa. On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the
peninsula of India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic
cones of Java, many plants occur, either identically the same or
representing each other, and at the same time representing plants of
Europe, not found in the intervening hot lowlands. A list of the
genera collected on the loftier peaks of Java raises a picture of a
collection made on a hill in Europe! Still more striking is the fact
that southern Australian forms are clearly represented by plants
growing on the summits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these
Australian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights
of the peninsula of Malacca, and are thinly scattered, on the one hand
over India and on the other as far as Japan.
<P>
On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. M&uuml;ller has discovered
several European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur
on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by Dr.
Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the
intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable `Introduction to the
Flora of New Zealand,' by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are
given in regard to the plants of that large island.  Hence we see that
throughout the world, the plants growing on the more lofty mountains,
and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern
hemispheres, are sometimes identically the same; but they are much
oftener specifically distinct, though related to each other in a most
remarkable manner.
<P>
This brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly
analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial
animals. In marine productions, similar cases occur; as an example, I
may quote a remark by the highest authority, Prof. Dana, that `it is
certainly a wonderful fact that New Zealand should have a
closer resemblance in its crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode,
than to any other part of the world.' Sir J. Richardson, also, speaks
of the reappearance on the shores of New Zealand, Tasmania, &amp;c.,
of northern forms of fish. Dr Hooker informs me that twenty-five
species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to Europe, but have not
been found in the intermediate tropical seas.
<P>
It should be observed that the northern species and forms found in
the southern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the
mountain-ranges of the intertropical regions, are not arctic, but
belong to the northern temperate zones. As Mr. H. C. Watson has
recently remarked, `In receding from polar towards equatorial
latitudes, the Alpine or mountain floras really become less and less
arctic.' Many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer
regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful
value, being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct, by
others as varieties; but some are certainly identical, and many,
though closely related to northern forms, must be ranked as distinct
species.
<P>
Now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on
the belief, supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence,
that the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the Glacial
period simultaneously much colder than at present. The Glacial period,
as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember
over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread
within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any
amount of migration. As the cold came slowly on, all the tropical
plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides
towards the equator, followed in the rear by the temperate
productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we are not
now concerned. The tropical plants probably suffered much extinction;
how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported as
many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the Cape
of Good Hope, and in parts of temperate Australia. As we know that
many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount
of cold, many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall
of temperature, more especially by escaping into the
warmest spots. But the great fact to bear in mind is, that all
tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. On the
other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the
equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new
conditions, will have suffered less. And it is certain that many
temperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can
withstand a much warmer climate than their own. Hence, it seems to me
possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a
suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against
intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant
temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have
reached or even crossed the equator. The invasion would, of course,
have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate;
for Dr. Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the
tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate
climate. On the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will
have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives. The mountain-ranges
north-west of the Himalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem
to have afforded two great lines of invasion: and it is a striking
fact, lately communicated to me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering
plants, about forty-six in number, common to Tierra del Fuego and to
Europe still exist in North America, which must have lain on the line
of march. But I do not doubt that some temperate productions entered
and crossed even the <I>lowlands</I> of the tropics at the period when the
cold was most intense,   when arctic forms had migrated some
twenty-five degrees of latitude from their native country and covered
the land at the foot of the Pyrenees. At this period of extreme cold,
I believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea
was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or
seven thousand feet. During this the coldest period, I suppose that
large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled
tropical and temperate vegetation, like that now growing with strange
luxuriance at the base of the Himalaya, as graphically described by
Hooker.
<P>
Thus, as I believe, a considerable number of plants, a few
terrestrial animals, and some marine productions, migrated
during the Glacial period from the northern and southern temperate
zones into the intertropical regions, and some even crossed the
equator. As the warmth returned, these temperate forms would naturally
ascend the higher mountains, being exterminated on the lowlands; those
which had not reached the equator, would re-migrate northward or
southward towards their former homes; but the forms, chiefly northern,
which had crossed the equator, would travel still further from their
homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere.
Although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the
whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during
their long southern migration and re-migration northward, the case may
have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled
themselves on the intertropical mountains, and in the southern
hemisphere. These being surrounded by strangers will have had to
compete with many new forms of life; and it is probable that selected
modifications in their structure, habits, and constitutions will have
profited them. Thus many of these wanderers, though still plainly
related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern
hemispheres, now exist in their new homes as well-marked varieties or
as distinct species.
<P>
It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard
to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many
more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from
the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however,
a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and
Abyssinia.  I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to
south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the
northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers,
and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and
competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than
the southern forms.  And thus, when they became commingled during the
Glacial period, the northern forms were enabled to beat the less
powerful southern forms. Just in the same manner as we see at the
present day, that very many European productions cover
the ground in La Plata, and in a lesser degree in Australia, and have
to a certain extent beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern
forms have become naturalised in any part of Europe, though hides,
wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely
imported into Europe during the last two or three centuries from La
Plata, and during the last thirty or forty years from Australia.
Something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical
mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they were stocked with
endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere largely yielded
to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger areas and more
efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the native
productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the
naturalised; and if the natives have not been actually exterminated,
their numbers have been greatly reduced, and this is the first stage
towards extinction. A mountain is an island on the land; and the
intertropical mountains before the Glacial period must have been
completely isolated; and I believe that the productions of these
islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas
of the north, just in the same way as the productions of real islands
have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms, naturalised by
man's agency.
<P>
I am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the
view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied
species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on
the mountains of the intertropical regions. Very many difficulties
remain to be solved. I do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and
means of migration, or the reason why certain species and not others
have migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given
rise to new groups of forms, and others have remained unaltered. We
cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can say why one species
and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land;
why one ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as
common, as another species within their own homes.
<P>
I have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the
most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr. Hooker in
his botanical works on the antarctic regions. These
cannot be here discussed. I will only say that as far as regards the
occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as
Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia, I believe that towards the
close of the Glacial period, icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, have
been largely concerned in their dispersal. But the existence of
several quite distinct species, belonging to genera exclusively
confined to the south, at these and other distant points of the
southern hemisphere, is, on my theory of descent with modification, a
far more remarkable case of difficulty. For some of these species are
so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the
commencement of the Glacial period for their migration, and for their
subsequent modification to the necessary degree. The facts seem to me
to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in
radiating lines from some common centre; and I am inclined to look in
the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer
period, before the commencement of the Glacial period, when the
antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly peculiar and
isolated flora. I suspect that before this flora was exterminated by
the Glacial epoch, a few forms were widely dispersed to various points
of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by
the aid, as halting-places, of existing and now sunken islands, and
perhaps at the commencement of the Glacial period, by icebergs. By
these means, as I believe, the southern shores of America, Australia,
New Zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of
vegetable life.
<P>
Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language
almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alterations of
climate on geographical distribution. I believe that the world has
recently felt one of his great cycles of change; and that on this
view, combined with modification through natural selection, a
multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of
allied forms of life can be explained. The living waters may be said
to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the
south, and to have crossed at the equator; but to have flowed with
greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south.
As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, though
rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the
living waters left their living drift on our mountain-summits, in a
line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under
the equator. The various beings thus left stranded may be compared
with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the
mountain-fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record,
full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding
lowlands.
