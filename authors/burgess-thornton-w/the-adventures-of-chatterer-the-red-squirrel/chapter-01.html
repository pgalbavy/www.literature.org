<p>Chatterer the Red Squirrel had been scolding because there was
no excitement. He had even tried to make some excitement by waking
Bobby Coon and making him so angry that Bobby had threatened to
eat him alive. It had been great fun to dance around and call
Bobby names and make fun of him. Oh, yes, it had been great fun.
You see, he knew all the time that Bobby couldn't catch him if
he should try. But now things were different. Chatterer had all
the excitement that he wanted. Indeed, he had more than he wanted.
The truth is, Chatterer was running for his life, and he knew
it.</p>

<p>It is a terrible thing, a very terrible thing to have to run
for one's life. Peter Rabbit knows all about it. He has run for
his life often. Sometimes it has been Reddy Fox behind him, sometimes
Bowser the Hound, and once or twice Old Man Coyote. Peter has
known that on his long legs his life has depended, and more than
once a terrible fear has filled his heart. But Peter has also
known that if he could reach the old stone wall or the dear Old
Briar-patch first, he would be safe, and he always has reached
it. So when he has been running with that terrible fear in his
heart, there has always been hope there, too.</p>

<p>But Chatterer the Red Squirrel was running without hope. Yes,
Sir, there was nothing but fear, terrible fear, in his heart,
for he knew not where to go. The hollow tree or the holes in the
old stone wall where he would be safe from any one else, even
Farmer Brown's boy, offered him no safety now, for the one who
was following him with hunger in his anger-red eyes could go anywhere
that he could go&mdash;could go into any hole big enough for him to
squeeze into. You see, it was Shadow the Weasel from whom Chatterer
was running, and Shadow is so slim that he can slip in and out
of places that even Chatterer cannot get through.</p>

<p>Chatterer knew all this, and so, because it was of no use to
run to his usual safe hiding places, he ran in just the other
direction. He didn't know where he was going. He had just one
thought: to run and run as long as he could and then, well, he
would try to fight, though he knew it would be of no use.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he sobbed, as he ran out on the branch
of a tree and leaped across to the next tree, "I wish I had minded
my own business! I wish I had kept my tongue still. Shadow the
Weasel wouldn't have known where I was if he hadn't heard my voice.
Oh, dear! oh, dear me! What can I do? What can I do?"</p>

<p>Now in his great fright Chatterer had run and jumped so hard
that he was beginning to grow very tired. Presently he found that
he must make a very long jump to reach the next tree. He had often
made as long a jump as this and thought nothing of it, but now
he was so tired that the distance looked twice as great as it
really was. He didn't dare stop to run down the tree and scamper
across. So he took a long breath, ran swiftly along the branch,
and leaped. His hands just touched the tip of the nearest branch
of the other tree. He tried his very best to hold on, but he couldn't.
Then down, down, down he fell. He spread himself out as flat as
he could, and that saved him a little, but still it was a dreadful
fall, and when he landed, it seemed for just a minute as if all
the breath was gone from his body. But it wasn't quite, and in
another minute he was scrambling up the tree.</p>
