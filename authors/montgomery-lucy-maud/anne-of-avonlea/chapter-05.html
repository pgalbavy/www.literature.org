<P>
When Anne reached the school that morning. . .for the first time
in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its
beauties. . .all was quiet and still.  The preceding teacher had
trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when
Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of
"shining morning faces" and bright, inquisitive eyes.  She hung up
her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as
frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive
how she was trembling.
<P>
She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a
speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. 
She had revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had
learned it off by heart.  It was a very good speech and had some
very fine ideas in it, especially about mutual help and earnest
striving after knowledge.  The only trouble was that she could not
now remember a word of it.
<P>
After what seemed to her a year. . .about ten seconds in reality
. . .she said faintly, "Take your Testaments, please," and sank
breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter
of desk lids that followed.  While the children read their verses
Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the
array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land.
<P>
Most of them were, of course, quite well known to her.  Her own
classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had
all gone to school with her, excepting the primer class and ten
newcomers to Avonlea.  Anne secretly felt more interest in these
ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well
mapped out to her.  To be sure, they might be just as commonplace
as the rest; but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among
them.  It was a thrilling idea.
<P>
Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye.  He had a
dark, sullen little face, and was staring at Anne with a hostile
expression in his black eyes.  Anne instantly made up her mind that
she would win that boy's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly.
<P>
In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty
Sloane. . .a jolly looking little chap, with a snub nose, freckled
face, and big, light blue eyes, fringed with whitish lashes. . .
probably the DonNELL boy; and if resemblance went for anything,
his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell.  Anne
wondered what sort of mother the child had, to send her to school
dressed as she was.  She wore a faded pink silk dress, trimmed with
a great deal of cotton lace, soiled white kid slippers, and silk
stockings.  Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and
unnatural curls, surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon
bigger than her head.  Judging from her expression she was very
well satisfied with herself.
<P>
A pale little thing, with smooth ripples of fine, silky,
fawn-colored hair flowing over her shoulders, must, Anne thought,
be Annetta Bell, whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge
school district, but, by reason of hauling their house fifty yards
north of its old site were now in Avonlea.  Three pallid little
girls crowded into one seat were certainly Cottons; and there was
no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel
eyes, who was casting coquettish looks at Jack Gills over the edge
of her Testament, was Prillie Rogerson, whose father had recently
married a second wife and brought Prillie home from her grandmother's
in Grafton.  A tall, awkward girl in a back seat, who seemed to have
too many feet and hands, Anne could not place at all, but later on
discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come to
live with an Avonlea aunt.  She was also to find that if Barbara
ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own
or somebody else's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual
fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it.
<P>
But when Anne's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing
her own, a queer little thrill went over her, as if she had found
her genius.  She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel
Lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be
unlike the Avonlea children.  More than that, Anne realized that he
was unlike other children anywhere, and that there was a soul
subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes
that were watching her so intently.
<P>
She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight.  He had the
most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child. . .
features of exquisite delicacy and refinement, framed in a halo of
chestnut curls.  His mouth was delicious, being full without
pouting, the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into
finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled. 
He had a sober, grave, meditative expression, as if his spirit was
much older than his body; but when Anne smiled softly at him it
vanished in a sudden answering smile, which seemed an illumination
of his whole being, as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame
inside of him, irradiating him from top to toe.  Best of all, it
was involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but simply
the outflashing of a hidden personality, rare and fine and sweet. 
With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends
forever before a word had passed between them.
<P>
The day went by like a dream.  Anne could never clearly recall it
afterwards.  It almost seemed as if it were not she who was
teaching but somebody else.  She heard classes and worked sums and
set copies mechanically.  The children behaved quite well; only two
cases of discipline occurred.  Morley Andrews was caught driving a
pair of trained crickets in the aisle.  Anne stood Morley on the
platform for an hour and. . .which Morley felt much more keenly. . .
confiscated his crickets.  She put them in a box and on the way from
school set them free in Violet Vale; but Morley believed, then and ever
afterwards, that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement.
<P>
The other culprit was Anthony Pye, who poured the last drops of
water from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay's neck. 
Anne kept Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was
expected of gentlemen, admonishing him that they never poured water
down ladies' necks.  She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen, she said.
Her little lecture was quite kind and touching; but unfortunately
Anthony remained absolutely untouched.  He listened to her in silence,
with the same sullen expression, and whistled scornfully as he went out.
Anne sighed; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a
Pye's affections, like the building of Rome, wasn't the work of a day.
In fact, it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections
to win; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony, who looked as if he
might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness.
<P>
When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped
wearily into her chair.  Her head ached and she felt woefully
discouraged.  There was no real reason for discouragement, since
nothing very dreadful had occurred; but Anne was very tired and
inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching. 
And how terrible it would be to be doing something you didn't like
every day for. . .well, say forty years.  Anne was of two minds
whether to have her cry out then and there, or wait till she was
safely in her own white room at home.  Before she could decide
there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor,
and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made
her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison's on an overdressed
female he had seen in a Charlottetown store.  "She looked like a
head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare."
<P>
The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk,
puffed, frilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or shirring
could possibly be placed.  Her head was surmounted by a huge white
chiffon hat, bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich
feathers.  A veil of pink chiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge
black dots, hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders
and floated off in two airy streamers behind her.  She wore all the
jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman, and a very strong
odor of perfume attended her.
<P>
"I am Mrs. DonNELL. . .Mrs. H. B. DonNELL," announced this vision,
"and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told
me when she came home to dinner today.  It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY."
<P>
"I'm sorry," faltered Anne, vainly trying to recollect any incident
of the morning connected with the Donnell children.
<P>
"Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell.  Now,
Miss Shirley, the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL. . .
accent on the last syllable.  I hope you'll remember this in future."
<P>
"I'll try to," gasped Anne, choking back a wild desire to laugh. 
"I know by experience that it's very unpleasant to have one's name
SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it
pronounced wrong."
<P>
"Certainly it is.  And Clarice Almira also informed me that you
call my son Jacob."
<P>
"He told me his name was Jacob," protested Anne.
<P>
"I might well have expected that," said Mrs. H. B. Donnell, in a
tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked
for in this degenerate age.  "That boy has such plebeian tastes,
Miss Shirley.  When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair
. . .it sounds SO aristocratic, doesn't it?  But his father
insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle.  I yielded,
because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor.  And what do you
think, Miss Shirley?  When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle
Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of
his own.  Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?  The moment the
invitation to the wedding. . .for he had the impertinence to send
us an invitation, Miss Shirley. . .came to the house I said, `No
more Jacobs for me, thank you.' From that day I called my son St. 
Clair and St. Clair I am determined he shall be called.  His father
obstinately continues to call him Jacob, and the boy himself
has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name.
But St. Clair he is and St. Clair he shall remain.  You will kindly
remember this, Miss Shirley, will you not?  THANK you.  I told
Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and
that a word would set it right.  Donnell. . .accent on the last
syllable. . .and St. Clair. . .on no account Jacob.  You'll remember?
THANK you."
<P>
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school
door and went home.  At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving
by the Birch Path.  He held out to her a cluster of the dainty
little wild orchids which Avonlea children called "rice lillies."
<P>
"Please, teacher, I found these in Mr. Wright's field," he said
shyly, "and I came back to give them to you because I thought you
were the kind of lady that would like them, and because. . ." he
lifted his big beautiful eyes. . ."I like you, teacher."
<P>
"You darling," said Anne, taking the fragrant spikes.  As if Paul's
words had been a spell of magic, discouragement and weariness
passed from her spirit, and hope upwelled in her heart like a
dancing fountain.  She went through the Birch Path light-footedly,
attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction.
<P>
"Well, how did you get along?" Marilla wanted to know.
<P>
"Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you.  I can't now
. . .I don't know myself. . .I'm too near it.  My thoughts feel as if
they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy.  The only
thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught
Cliffie Wright that A is A.  He never knew it before.  Isn't it
something to have started a soul along a path that may end in
Shakespeare and Paradise Lost?"
<P>
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement.  That good
lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of
them how they liked their new teacher.
<P>
"And every one of them said they liked you splendid, Anne, except
Anthony Pye.  I must admit he didn't.  He said you `weren't any good,
just like all girl teachers.'  There's the Pye leaven for you. 
But never mind."
<P>
"I'm not going to mind," said Anne quietly, "and I'm going to make
Anthony Pye like me yet.  Patience and kindness will surely win him."
<P>
"Well, you can never tell about a Pye," said Mrs. Rachel cautiously.
"They go by contraries, like dreams, often as not.  As for that
DonNELL woman, she'll get no DonNELLing from me, I can assure you.
The name is DONnell and always has been.  The woman is crazy, that's what.
She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table
along with the family, eating off a china plate.  I'd be afraid of a
judgment if I was her.  Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible,
hard-working man, but he hadn't much gumption when he picked out a wife,
that's what."
