<p>Avon Burnet waited several minutes after the light went out,
in the hope that it would reappear and give him an indication
of its nature and cause; but darkness continued, and he concluded
that his first suspicion was right: some warrior in riding over
the prairie had halted to light his cigar or pipe, and then ridden
on to join his comrades near the cabin.</p>

<p>The youth was in the situation of the mariner who finds himself
adrift in mid-ocean, without compass or rudder. Neither the sky
nor the ground gave him any help, and in order to reach the camp
of his friends he must, under Heaven, rely upon his own skill.</p>

<p>"There's one thing certain," he concluded, "I shall never get
there without making a break. I have secured a pretty good horse,
and I may as well turn him to account."</p>

<p>Heading in the direction which seemed right, he tapped the ribs
of the mustang with his heels, and he broke at once into a sweeping
gallop, which, if rightly directed, was sure to carry him to his
destination in a brief while.</p>

<p>Though it was too much for the young man to believe he was following
the true course, he thought it was near enough for him to discover
the variation before riding far. He ought to reach the crest of
some elevation which would so extend his view that he would catch
the gleam of the camp fire of the cattlemen.</p>

<p>As the pony galloped forward with that swinging gait which he
was able to maintain for hours without fatigue, the rider glanced
to the right and left, in front and rear, on guard lest he ran
into unexpected danger, and guarding against the approach of one
or more of his foes. His horse was tractable, but the rider was
disturbed now and then by his actions.</p>

<p>While going with his swift gait, he occasionally checked his
speed so abruptly that, had the young Texan been a less skilful
equestrian, he would have pitched over his head. At such times
he pricked his ears, and snuffed and threw up his head, as though
frightened at something. But strive all he could, Avon failed
to discover the cause of this peculiar behavior. He could neither
hear nor see anything to explain it.</p>

<p>Our young friend was so keenly on the alert that he was quick
to notice that they were ascending quite a swell in the plain.
He drew the mustang down to a walk, and when at the highest point
of the elevation, brought him to a stand-still.</p>

<p>No poor sailor, floating on a plank, ever strove harder to pierce
the gloom in quest of a friendly light, than did Avon. His first
glance in the direction which seemed to him to be right failed
to show that which he longed to see. Then he slowly swept the
horizon with the same searching scrutiny.</p>

<p>Not the first star-like glimmer rewarded him. Blank darkness
enclosed him on every hand. It was right above, below, to the
right and left and to the front and rear.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be shot if this doesn't beat everything!" was his
exclamation, when he came to understand his helplessness; "it
looks as if I would have done the folks a great deal more good
if I had stayed with them."</p>

<p>Slipping down from the back of his mustang, which he took care
to hold by means of the halter, Avon pressed his ear to the earth,
as is the practice of those in a similar situation.</p>

<p>At first he thought he detected the sounds of hoofs, but the
next moment he knew it was only fancy. The better conductor in
the form of the ground told him no more than did the gloom that
surrounded him.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, the mustang tugged at the rope, as if wishing
to free himself. He must have felt that he was controlled by a
strange hand, but his efforts were easily restrained.</p>

<p>As nearly as Avon could judge, he had travelled more than two
miles since leaving the cabin, so that, provided he had followed
the proper course, he must have passed half the distance. But
if that were the case, he ought to see signs of the camp. It is
the custom of the cattlemen, when on the move, to keep a lantern
suspended from the front of the provision wagon, to serve as a
guide for the rest, and this ought to be visible for several miles
to one in his elevated position.</p>

<p>Holding the thong in one hand, the youth now pointed his Winchester
toward the sky and discharged several barrels, in the hope that
the reports would reach the ears of the Texans and bring a response
from them. The mustang did not stir a muscle; he was so accustomed
to that sort of thing that his nerves were not disturbed.</p>

<p>This appeal was equally futile, and, as Avon flung himself again
upon the back of his horse, a feeling akin to despair came over
him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was quite an exploit to get through the Comanche
lines without harm," he said to himself, "but of what avail? I
shall wander round and round until daylight, with no more knowledge
of where I am than if I were groping among the Rocky Mountains;
and, long before the rise of sun, the fate of Uncle Dohm and the
folks will be settled."</p>

<p>A feeling of exasperation succeeded his depression of spirits.
It was beyond endurance that he should be so near help and yet
be unable to secure it. If he could but gain an inkling of the
right course, he would dart across the prairie with the speed
of an arrow.</p>

<p>He had neglected no possible means of informing himself. Recalling
the direction of the wind, he strove to make use of that; but
as if even the elements had united against him, he was not long
in discovering that the wind was fitful and changing, and his
attempt to use it as a guide had much to do with his going so
far astray.</p>

<p>The rifle was discharged again, but the listening ear caught
no response, and the conviction forced itself upon him that, instead
of journeying toward the camp, he was really further from it than
when he started.</p>

<p>The mustang began to grow restless once more. Avon spoke sharply,
and started him off without any attempt to guide him. To his surprise,
the steed turned to the left almost at right angles, and without
any urging on his part, broke into a canter.</p>

<p>"I don't understand that," said the rider; "he certainly knows
more than I do, but it is too much to expect him to carry me to
my destination without any direction from me. But he is as likely
to be right as wrong, and so I'll let him do as he chooses. You're
a mighty fine animal," continued the youth, as the steed broke
into a gallop, "but I wouldn't give Thunderbolt for a hundred
like you; he knows something, and when I'm caught in a fix like
this, he is sure to help me out."</p>

<p>The youth feared that the mustang was trying to return to his
master. He, therefore, brought him down to a walk, though he broke
into a canter more than once, and leaning forward, peered through
the gloom, on the alert for the first sign of danger.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dohm believed the Comanches meant to set fire to the house;
if he hadn't thought so, I wouldn't have been in this plight;
it strikes me that it is about time they made a start; if they
do so, I will take a hand in that little game."</p>

<p>At the first glow anywhere in the sky, telling of the use of
the torch, Avon would have driven his mustang thither like the
whirlwind, and it is safe to believe that his Winchester would
have done more effective service than ever before. But the bright
eyes which continually scanned every portion of the murky heavens
caught no glimmer of a single star.</p>

<p>The mustang gave a slight whinny and rose to a canter again,
but was roughly checked by his new master.</p>

<p>"What the mischief is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Just then, something took shape in the gloom ahead. Avon stopped
his steed and leaned forward. Yes; it was unmistakable.</p>

<p>There it stood&mdash;a long, low cabin, whose familiar contour told
the alarming fact that he had come back to his starting-point,
and was among the Comanches in front of his own home!</p>
