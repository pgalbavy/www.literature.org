<p><strong>The Mountain Top - The Story That Was</strong></p>

<p>It was a June day with the sparkle and lilt of summer's brightest and
tunefulest mood in the sky and a softness and warmth in the air. The
most distant peaks of the mountains slept in a quiet and purple glory
and their nearer slopes still held a forest-freshness undulled by heat
and sunburn.
</p>
<p>Deep in the woods of the White Mountains the wild flowers were springing
joyously and the birds were pouring out the fulness of life and joy and
love from trilling throats.
</p><p>The waters of Lake Forsaken were like a mirror holding in their still
bosom all the vivid color which summer paints into its first and
sweetest days while an after-note of spring's youth still lingers. The
blue of the sky was broken only by white cloud-sails that rode high and
buoyant in the upper air currents, like galleons of dreams, and all
these things were given back in reflection from depths where the bass
leaped and the sun shimmered. On the lake's farther margin a red-brown
shape came down with careful feet gingerly lifted and set down, to raise
its antlered head. But the gentle eyes were not charged with fear, for
this was a season of security and truce with mankind.
</p><p>If the world held trouble anywhere, no shadow of its passing riffled or
marred the landscape here. And yet in this smile and song of nature,
there must be a certain disregard for human affairs, because the
movement which held the deer's gaze, as he stood there at the water's
edge, looking across the width of Lake Forsaken, was the movement of
human beings trailing along the road in a funeral cortège.
</p><p>The road along which it traveled was no longer a deeply scarred trail,
rutted through its clay surface by the hauling of lumber. It was metaled
and smooth. There were many changes in the character of things
hereabouts--all changes which attested that the curse of decay and
hopeless sterility had been lifted. Off through a rift in the hills
loomed the white concrete abutment of an aqueduct--and through the
valley wound a railroad. A man might have walked many miles and come
upon few deserted habitations, preyed upon by the twin vandals Time and
Decay and staring blankly out through unglazed windows. What had once
been a land of abandoned farms, a battle-ground where poverty had fought
and defeated humanity, was now a land redeemed. Honest thrift and
substantial comfort had crowned it with reclamation.
</p><p>The church to which the hearse was making its way had also changed in
aspect. The tumbledown building had become a more worthy house of
worship, unelaborate, but renewed. Its belfry stood upright and on the
Sabbath spoke out in the music of its chimes. Graves where once the
headstones had teetered in neglect lay now in rows of ordered care, and
those who slept in them no longer slept among the briars of over-grown
thickets.
</p><p>About the building, waiting for the coming of a new tenant in the acre
of the dead, were gathered a score or more of neighbors, because the
body which was to be laid to rest today had been, in life, the member of
a family which they delighted to honor and respect.
</p><p>Along the stone wall which skirted the road, and under the wild apple
trees, were hitched the wagons and buggies that had brought them from
many miles around, across the hills. Some of them came from houses far
back where roads narrowed and grew precipitous.
</p><p>Yet even among those who stood waiting in the churchyard near the
reminder of an open grave, the lyric tunefulness of this June morning
refused to surrender unconditionally to sadness. Off between the fence
and the rising slope of the nearest hill a ripple ran across a yellow
field of buckwheat and from a fence-post a golden-breasted lark sang
merrily.
</p><p>Those who had arrived earliest gossiped of such commonplace matters as
make the round of life where small things take the place of large
excitement, and their faces were not gloomy faces. Young men and girls
among them were strolling apart, and the smiles in their eyes told that
to them death was an incident, but June and love a nearer fact--a thing
closer to their youth.
</p><p>Then around the turn came the procession which they awaited--a hearse,
followed by several buck-boards and buggies.
</p><p>At the open gate it halted and the pall-bearers lifted down the casket
from its place, and bore it to the spot which had been prepared for its
reception. There were no formal designs from the shop of any florist,
but from every neighborhood garden had come contributions out of that
wealth which this golden month was squandering in blossom. Roses and
peonies and a brave display of those varied flowers that go in rows
about old-fashioned gardens had been gathered and brought by
sympathetic hands.
</p><p>But it was chiefly upon the woman who came here to bury the last of her
dead that the bared heads turned eyes of reverent interest. At her side
walked a young farmer, whose tanned face and curling hair and
straight-gazing gray eyes proclaimed a robust and simple manhood.
</p><p>The girl herself was well worth looking at, even had she not claimed
interest by reason of her bereavement. She walked straight and lithe and
upright with the free grace of some wild thing, as though she shared
with the deer which had looked across the lake the untrammeled strength
of the hills. She was slender, but the fine lines of her figure were
rounded to the fullness of perfect health, and the color of her cheeks,
though now paler than their wont, was like that of delicate rose-leaves,
and her lips were the curved petals of a deeper blossom. Her hair, under
a black mourning hat, tangled in the meshes of its heavy coils the glint
of sunlight on amber and brightened now and then into a hint of
burnished copper, but the features which must have challenged the gaze
of any observer not dead to a sense of color and beauty were the
marvelous and mismated eyes. One was a rich brown like illuminated agate
with a fleck or two of jet across the iris, while its twin was of a
colorful violet and deeply vivid. Now, of course, the heavy lashes were
wet with tears, but the gorgeous beauty of the eyes was not dimmed.
</p><p>She stood there by the open grave and the masses of simple flowers, with
summer and June and green hills and blue skies at her back; and, of all
their loveliness, she might have been a living impersonation.
</p><p>The preacher whose duty it was to give a rendering of the burial rites
had grown old in this pastorate, and to him all these people were his
children. He had been with many of them at baptism, he had married them
and buried their dead; they were his flock, and they listened to his
words as to one ripe in wisdom and sainted in his life.
</p><p>He looked about the little burial ground and his eyes took on an earnest
light and his voice a deep thrill as he spoke.
</p><p>"If," said he, "there is anywhere a spot which is hallowed ground it is
this spot where we are now laying to her eternal rest what yesterday was
mortal of Elizabeth Burton. She is, save her daughter, the last of the
name to be taken; and in that greater life to which she goes, she will
be reunited with those who loved her and who went before.
</p><p>"She will share with them--" the preacher paused for a moment then went
on--"the glory of reward which, I think, God loves best to bestow upon
those who, with steadfast unselfishness, have lived simple lives and
left their fellows better for having lived. I do not know how God
measures the deeds of men, or with what degrees of reward he fixes their
place in Paradise; but I feel that I stand on holy ground as my eyes
wander here and fall upon these graves where the Burtons sleep. I know
that once this was a land of want and misery; a country of abandoned
farms. Today I look about me, and, under skies that seem to sing, I see
a land redeemed. It was not redeemed by great wealth from without, but
by resolution and dauntless effort from within. I have spoken of the
headstones that mark these graves, but the Burtons have a nobler
monument. The roads and schools and the aqueduct--all the things that
transformed the land are memorials to the man who lies just there
beyond this grave where today we place his mother. On that slab we find
only the dates of birth and death and the name of Hamilton Burton; but
when I look at it, I seem to read a nobler epitaph in letters of bronze
which no weather can dim or tarnish. I seem to read--'Here lies one who
put aside a blazing dream to cast his lot into a life of humbler duty.'
If he who makes two blades of grass grow where one had grown before has
done a noble thing, then surely he who has turned a land of want into a
land of independence and made crops grow where none grew before has won
his place near the throne."
</p><p>Again the aged pastor paused and his eyes grew misty. With bared heads
bent and a stillness broken only by the rustle of the breeze through the
trees and the song of a bird, his listeners stood attentive, and he
resumed.
</p><p>"I need not tell you, for you know, what the energy and loyal
steadfastness of Hamilton Burton have done for these hills. What they
were when he came to manhood and what they are now is the answer to
that--an answer which needs no further eulogium. But there is a thing,
which you may not know, for I think--once his hard decision was made--he
never spoke of that again. Yet now I wish to speak of it. It is a thing
which should put the name of Hamilton Burton among those of the
great--the humble great. In his boyhood heart blazed a mighty vision. In
his brain burned a hunger for conquest. The man who dwelt so simply here
among us, working a regeneration, and who died among us, still young,
was gifted with a power which he might have put to more selfish uses.
Standing in the wintry loneliness of a mountain snowstorm, his eyes
could see visions of mighty things and his soul could dream unmeasured
dreams. His heart beat responsively to an inward voice which assured him
that he might equal and surpass the greatness of Destiny's greatest
sons. He fretted for a larger world, knowing that in it he could
conquer. In Hamilton Burton dwelt the soul of a Napoleon or a Cæsar ...
he might have built an empire."
</p><p>The voice had grown fervent as it rose with its words, then the speaker
let it fall again to quieter tones.
</p><p>"And these roads and schools and this aqueduct and these redeemed acres
are the monument to the sacrifice which turned its back on such a dream
as that. Hamilton Burton wrestled with his soul's hunger and conquered
it. He elected to remain here, fighting at the head of his own community
for his own land, and finding contentment in the realization that he had
done his duty. At one time--for his forcefulness was great--he had
persuaded his family to countenance his great adventure--and then he
dreamed. It seemed to him that he had looked ahead, and the whole great
panorama of the life which lay before him, should he take that turning
of the road, passed in review. Hamilton Burton did not take it. <u>He
remained here.</u> His work was the work of the sons of Martha.
</p><p>    "'As in the thronged and the lightened ways, so in
</p><p>        the dark and the desert they stand,
    Wary and watchful all their days, that their brethren's
</p><p>        days may be long in the land.'
</p><p>"If Hamilton Burton put aside such ambitions as most of us never know in
our dreams, and chose the humbler combat of a simple life, close to
God's immortal granite, you have all been sharers in the benefit of his
decision.
</p><p>"And as it was with him, so in a lesser way it was with those others who
sleep here close beside him.
</p><p>    "'Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
      Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
    Hands that the rod of empire might have swayed,
      Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.
    Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast,
      The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
    Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
      Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.'"
</p><p>In the pause which followed a low breath of reverent surprise ran
through the crowd that stood about the speaker. They had lived day by
day with Hamilton Burton until his death, and none of them had, in the
shoulder-touch of life, ever suspected those deeper things of which now
for the first time they heard. They were hearing it all from lips which
were to them as the lips of a prophet. But the preacher was not through.
</p><p>"And there was Paul. You all knew him and loved him. A nature was given
him at birth almost too delicate for a world of hard affairs, but
fragrant with a tenderness of love for his fellow-men. He was attuned to
harmony and his heart was that of a troubadour.
</p><p>"Here in this little place of our worship, his fingers on the keys have
often led us nearer to God's presence than could the poor and broken
messages I tried to preach to you. For the other world was always close
to Paul Burton and there was a magic in his minstrelsy, which was a
gift from God. I sometimes wonder if in a less simple world he could
have been so happy or if his life would have been so unmarred, away from
the songs of birds and the lilt of mountain breezes. But among us he,
too, lived and died--because Hamilton Burton turned his back on the lure
of the mirage his dreaming eyes had seen. Even now when Paul has gone,
those chimes, which you put there above our church in memory of him,
seem to sing of the things for which he stood. When their notes peal out
on the Sabbath and go softly across the valley, I like to imagine that,
through the nobler music which immortal ears may hear, he still catches
their echo.
</p><p>"There, close together, stand two more headstones, and beneath them
sleep the father and the aunt of these men. Thomas Burton, too, lived
out a life of stalwart worth. To all men, his fearless character and
unshakable integrity were precepts. He went his way and looked into
every eye that met his own. In the activities that have wrought these
changes, he was always the first and last to work with tireless zeal.
When the railroad came it was through his untiring effort. He held the
determination with fighting Burton courage that adversity should not
drive him from the land his forefathers had conquered.
</p><p>"In wondering what things would have befallen all these people had a
lad's ambition led them into a different life, I find myself treading
paths of doubt. Perhaps noble achievements might have resulted--but I
know that in remaining here they have made our land to blossom and to me
it seems enough. I can, for some reason, no more think of Thomas Burton
transplanted without hurt than I can think of some great patriarch of
the forest, which has buffeted storms and hail for decades, being
uprooted and planted anew in a trim garden and a different clime. Then
he died, too--
</p><p>    "'And as he trod that day to God, so walked he from his birth,
    In simpleness and gentleness and honor and clean mirth.'"
</p><p>The speaker talked deliberately. At times his voice mounted into a sort
of oratorical fire. At times it fell until his listeners bent forward
that they might miss none of his words. Now and again he would stop
altogether and his eyes would turn to the blue skies, and when they did
a devout and intense light glowed in their pupils. His hearers were
simple and easily touched and an occasional sob came from the women.
</p><p>"I said that Hamilton Burton died young," he resumed. "He died almost a
boy with a boy's youthful heart beating in his bosom. If he could so
bring out of desolation a land like this, while yet he was hardly a man
in years, who can say that his dream of power was all a dream? If he who
never left these hills and never saw the world beyond save as he saw it
in the exaltation of his flaming imagination, could do such things, what
man can say that with maturity and opportunity he might not have become
a Cæsar? But the feet of these people never trod beyond the nearer ways
of a simple life. Hamilton Burton burned to go out and try the eagle's
wings of his life. He had won the acquiescence of his family. He did not
go. None of them went. They lived here and died here and they fought
discontent, and to my mind they were conquerors of the earth."
</p><p>Once more there was a pause and after it came other words.
</p><p>"I suppose that they all dreamed. After the stress of that hurricane of
powerful personality, with which the boy had won them to his heart's
desire, these people could never have again lived their simple lives
without dreams coming--and doubts. To say, 'God knows best,' meant to
repress the disturbing thoughts that must have often arisen.
</p><p>"In these hills boys become men, and one boy became something more. This
was a family of beautiful and devoted love. The brothers were what God
meant brothers to be, friends whose hearts were linked. For every member
of this little group of one blood, all the others felt a mighty bond of
affection. And here they stayed." The four words might have been the
text, and through the talk it ran with the insistence of a refrain,
until it sank into the brain of every man and every woman who listened.
</p><p>"Here they stayed, and if each one of them thought often of what may
have been given up by that decision, no one of them said so.
</p><p>"Perhaps Paul, with the golden pattern of his dreams, may often have
mused upon what the outer world could have given him. Perhaps he thought
of himself as swaying audiences with his fingers on the keys and dreamed
of lips that parted and eyes that grew misty--because they listened to
the voices he could send pealing to their hearts. But he stayed here and
the audiences that sat spellbound were those little neighborhood
audiences, who stood a long way off from a full understanding of his
soul's ethereal web and woof.
</p><p>"Perhaps Thomas Burton, whose hands were calloused with toil, sometimes
permitted himself to think, at the end of his day's labors, of the ease
and comfort which might have come to him, had his son's great ambition
actually drawn him into mighty battles and victories instead of only
beckoning him.
</p><p>"Perhaps the woman, who must have felt that her children were not
ordinary children, may have shed a tear at times, because she was denied
the triumph of beholding their triumph. <u>But they stayed</u>--and if their
peaceful lives were troubled with misgivings, at least they knew that
this was certain and that doubtful--and that, while they might miss much
of achievement, they also missed much of peril, for none can say what a
journey means along an untried road. Who knows what an epic their lives
might have spelled--or what tragedy? But they stayed.
</p><p>"And now we are gathered to do homage by the grave of the woman whose
quiet life ran its course with theirs--the woman who bore these children
and taught them, at her knee, those lessons which made them
benefactors--and although we stand in the presence of death, it seems to
me that we stand, too, in the presence and the glory of that life which
is above death--and we stand on hallowed ground."
</p><p>He ended, and about him was the solemnity of simple hearts, stirred and
responsive, and over him was the serenity of June, and the warmth of the
earth pregnant with fruitfulness.
</p><p>When it was over, the crowd scattered to their vehicles and the wheels
clattered over the metaled roads, but in the burial ground, when all the
rest were gone, two figures tarried.
</p><p>For a moment the minister also stayed after the crowd had left. He went
over to the girl and spoke softly, with a hand laid tenderly on her
shoulder.
</p><p>"My daughter," he said simply, "you, too, have conquered. Every woman
has something of restless yearning in her eyes at some time. To a woman
with great charm and beauty the world sings a siren song. I saw this
thing in your eyes--and soul. I saw it come and go--and I knew that you
had won your fight, and won through to life's sweetest benison. You have
love. These lives are ended, but yours is beginning." Then he, too,
turned away, and only the girl and young man were left.
</p><p>Mary's beautiful eyes were bright with tears, and, as she stood there
slim and straight, her companion came close and his arm slipped about
her. For a moment she seemed unconscious of his presence, then she
turned and her eyes looked steadfastly into his, and as they looked they
smiled through their mistiness.
</p><p>"Mary"--the man's voice was earnest and very tender--"Mary, I know that
now you're thinking about other things and they're very sacred things.
Besides, my heart is overflowing and words don't give it enough power of
expression. Since I fell in love with you life has been all poetry to
me--but not a poetry of words.... You are thinking of them--" He paused
and his sober eyes took in the headstones, lingering for a moment on
this newest grave upon which the flowers were banked. They were fine
eyes, for in them dwelt an intrinsic honesty and courage, and, though it
was a moment of deep gravity, the little wrinkles that ran out from them
were assurances that they were often laughing eyes. This man seemed to
fit into the picture of the hills with the appropriateness of the
native-born. In his free-flung shoulders and broad chest was the health
of the open, but on one finger he wore a heavily carved ring from which
glowed the cool light of a large emerald, and in his scarf was a black
pearl, which hardly seemed characteristic of native wear. Then he went
on:
</p><p>"But, after all, Mary, they lived good lives and died good deaths,
and--" he hesitated, then said slowly--"and, after all, it's June, and
you and I are young. Can't it always be June for us, dear?"
</p><p>A bird from a great oak lifted its voice. It was a happy bird and would
tolerate no sadness. It caroled to its mate and to the sky and through
her tears Mary Burton smiled and the gorgeous vividness of her face was
illuminated.
</p><p>"While we've got each other," she said, "I guess it can be June."
</p><p>Suddenly she put out her slender, but strong, young hands and caught his
two arms, and stood there looking at him.
</p><p>"Once, dear," she said, "when I was a very little girl, I used to dream
of going out and seeing all the wonderful things beyond those hills. I
used to dream of having rich men and titled men come to me and make
love. I used to cry because I thought I was ugly--and then I met you by
the roadside--and you were my fairy prince--but I didn't guess you were
going to be my own--for always."
</p><p>Jefferson Edwardes smiled and into his eyes came a fervent glow.
</p><p>"I can see you now," he said, "as you stood that first day I ever saw
you, when I told you that your beauty would be the beauty of
gorgeousness--when I warned you that the only thing you need ever fear
was--the loss of your simplicity. The woods were flaming at your back,
but your loveliness outblazed their color, and then you were a thin
little girl--a trifle chippendale in plan."
</p><p>In spite of her sadness a smile came to her lips.
</p><p>"And you were fighting your fight for life--with only an even chance.
Suppose--" she shuddered--"suppose you had lost it!"
</p><p>"I had too much to live for," he assured her. "I couldn't lose it. You
and your hills gave me life and a dream, and you and your hills laid
their claim upon me. How could I lose?"
</p><p>"I've lain awake at night," said Mary Burton, as her long lashes drooped
with the confession of her heart. "I've lain awake at night wondering
if--now that you don't have to stay--if your own world won't call you
back--away from me. I've thought of all it holds for you--and how little
these mountains hold. I've wondered if your heart didn't ache for
foreign lands and wonderful cities--and all those things. If it does,
dear--" she paused and said very seriously--"you mustn't let me keep you
here. I belong here, but you--" The words fell into a faint note and
died away unfinished.
</p><p>"How little these hills hold for me," he exclaimed in a dismayed voice,
"when they hold you!" Then he laughed and told her as his eyes dwelt
steadfastly and with worship on her face, "I belong here no less than
you. This has been the land of my salvation and of my love. For me it is
enough. I have traded the unrest of cities for the tranquillity of the
hills and the clamor of unhappy streets for the echoes of the woods, and
the woods sing of you as the streets could never sing. I have traded at
a splendid profit, dear."
</p><p>"And you won't tire of it--and of me?"
</p><p>"I wish life could be long enough to give me a fair test of that," he
smiled, and then he added in a serious voice, "It is in the cities that
men and women grow tired. It is under artifice that the soul wearies.
That life I knew, and left with the bitterness of exile--but that was
long ago. When I go into it now, it shall be only for the joy of coming
back here again--of coming home."
</p><p>The girl looked up into his face, and the breeze fluttered a tendril of
curl against her temple.
</p><p>"You were the first person who ever called me pretty." Through the
sadness of her face came a glimmer of shy merriment. "You said I was--as
beautiful as starlight on water."
</p><p>"Mary, Mary!" The lover caught her slender figure in his strong arms and
held her so close that her breath came fragrantly against his tanned
cheek. "You <u>are</u> as beautiful as starlight on water, and to me you're
more beautiful. You're the sun and moon and stars and music--you're
everything that's fine and splendid!"
</p><p>"For your sake," she said shyly, "I wish I were much more beautiful."
</p><p>Even the near shadow of death cannot banish the god of love. Mary Burton
felt the arms of the man she loved about her, and her eyes as she looked
into his face unmasked their secrets until he could read her soul and
its message. For the moment they had forgotten all else. Then, quite
abruptly, her expression changed and became rapt, almost frightened.
</p><p>Slowly she straightened up and her pupils dilated as though they were
seeing something invisible to other eyes. Her lips parted and she drew
away from his grasp and stood gazing ahead. Then she brushed one arm
across her forehead. With instant alarm Edwardes caught her shoulders.
"What is it?" he demanded. "Is anything wrong?"
</p><p>She shook her head and spoke wonderingly with a far-away, detached sort
of utterance. "I don't know what it was--I guess I was a little faint."
But she still stood with an awed and bewildered fixity upon her face and
after a little while, he asked slowly:
</p><p>"Did you ever seem to see and hear something as though it had come out
of a different life; as though you were living it over again?"
</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. "I've often heard of such things," he
reassured. She had been nursing her mother through a long illness;
perhaps, he thought, the strain had left her nervous.
</p><p>"It was as real as if it had truly happened," she assured him as she put
up both hands and pressed her fingers against her temples. "You were
standing there--right where you are standing now, and you smiled--like
you smiled at me that day in the road.... There were little wrinkles
around your eyes."
</p><p>"That is all real enough," he laughed. "I was and am doing all those
things."
</p><p>"Yes, I know, but--" Once more she shook her head and her voice carried
the detached tone of a trance-like vagueness--"but somehow it was all
different. You were you--and I was I--and yet we were in another life
... we didn't seem to belong here ... and there seemed to be some
terrible danger hanging over us."
</p><p>"Did we seem to talk?" he asked her.
</p><p>"Yes." The girl's words came very low but with a tense emphasis. "You
said, <u>'Maybe there's some land beyond the stars where every mistake we
make here can be remedied ... where we can take up our marred lives and
live them afresh as we have dreamed them. Perhaps in that other world we
can go back to the turning of the road where we lost our ways and
choose the other path.'</u> You said that and then after a moment you
smiled again."
</p><p>"It's strange," said the young man. He unconsciously took off his hat,
baring the curly hair over the tanned face. He was very wholesome and
honest and strong, and the girl's eyes lighted into a smile of pride and
love.
</p><p>"Yes," she said. "It was you and me--in some other life. I don't know
what it means--but somehow it seems to--to guarantee everything."
</p><p>They turned and walked together to the last buggy hitched against the
stone wall under the wild apple trees.
</p><p>After a while she demanded--"After you got well--why did you stay here?"
and as promptly as an echo came his answer--
</p><p>"Because <u>you</u> stayed."
</p><hr/>
<p>The moon was up early that night and it flooded the mountains with a
glory of silver mists. The shoulders of the peaks stood out in blue
barriers, strong, abiding, beautiful. In the valleys it was all a
nocturne of dove grays and dreamlike softness. The stars, too, shone
down in a million splinters of happy light, but the radiance of the moon
paled them.
</p><p>The vines which covered the walls of the Burton house hung out their
lacy tendrils and through the windows came the soft glow of lamplight.
</p><p>There was nothing dreary or poverty-stricken about the old farm-house
now. From its front, where every shutter, by day, shone in the healthy
trim of fresh paint, to the gate upon the road went rows of flowers,
nodding their bright heads above the waving grass. The barns at the
back stood substantial and in repair, and now out beyond the road, Lake
Forsaken mirrored the stars and broke in light when a fish leaped under
the moon.
</p><p>Mary Burton and her lover walked down to the gate, and he said simply:
</p><p>"Now, dear, there is nothing more to hold you here. If you still long to
see beyond the sky-line, I can take you wherever you want to go."
</p><p>But she wheeled and laid a hand in protest on his arm.
</p><p>"No!" she exclaimed tensely. "No, this is where I belong." After a
moment she went on. "Life holds enough for me here. This is home to me.
I don't want anything else."
</p><p>"I am glad. It's what I hoped to hear you say," he responded. "I don't
think somehow I could be as happy anywhere else, but the world's a big
place and you--you have the right to the best it holds--anywhere."
</p><p>"Once, dear, you know," she told him gravely, "we threshed that out and
we had almost made up our minds to leave here. We were almost
whipped--and Ham had his dreams. He wanted to go out and try life in a
bigger world--and you recognized his power. I wanted it all, too--but we
stayed. I don't know what would have happened if we hadn't, but I do
know--" she looked up into his face and smiled; into her eyes came a
regal serenity--"I do know that I don't have to go out and hunt for
life--life has come to me, and I'm happy."
</p><p>The man caught her to him and she clasped her hands behind his head.
Before them was June and starlight and youth and life--and love. He bent
his head and pressed his lips to hers and felt her heart beat against
his own.

light of a thousand stars, and in his heart gleamed a million.
</p><p>"As beautiful as starlight on water," he whispered.
