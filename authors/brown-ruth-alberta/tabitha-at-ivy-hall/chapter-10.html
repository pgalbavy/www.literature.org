<p>Tabitha stood at the open window of Carrie's pretty room and
looked out over the scorched landscape burning under the pitiless
sun of late summer. But she did not see the scanty, shrivelled
vegetation of the parched mountains, nor was she aware of the
terrible heat of the day that seemed to have burned away the ambition
of every living creature. On the floor beside the little white
bed with its pink draperies sat Carrie, panting in the sultry
atmosphere, and anxiously watching the figure beside the window,
as she fanned herself with all the energy she could command.</p>

<p>"You aren't a bit glad, Puss," she said at last, trying to keep
the disappointment out of her voice. But if Tabitha heard she
gave no sign and the tears rose in the gentle blue eyes of the
speaker. "I thought you would think it was nice." Still Tabitha
made no reply, but kept her gaze fixed on the hot sands of the
sizzling desert. "We have planned it out so often, and now when
w &mdash;I can go, you don't like it."</p>

<p>Gulping back the lump that rose in her throat, the black-eyed
girl by the window wheeled toward her playmate, now lying prostrate
on the floor, and dropping on her knees beside her she exclaimed
penitently,</p>

<p>"I am mean, Carrie! I am glad because <em>you</em> are going
away to school, but&mdash;it is so hard to have you leave here&mdash;when
I can't go, too. Ain't I selfish? It isn't as if it would be only
for a week or even a month, but for whole years with only a few
days here in the winter! And you're the only friend I ever had
so near my own age!"</p>

<p>Tabitha was crying now and Carrie forgot her own disappointment
in soothing the greater sorrow of her mate.</p>

<p>"Don't feel so bad, Puss; maybe you can go, too."</p>

<p>"No, I can't! There isn't any use of thinking that, Carrie Carson!
It takes money to go to boarding school and Dad never has any
any more. His claims take all he gets. I wish he would let the
Cat Group go to Guinea and work for the Silver Legion like Mr.
McKittrick does. Mercedes McKittrick is going next year. I want
to go <em>so</em> much. I'm almost as far as I can get in this
little mite of a school and I can't bear to think of growing up
a know-nothing."</p>

<p>"You won't be a know-nothing, Puss, even if you never went to
school another day. Papa says it is ambition that wins, and you're
the most ambitious girl I ever knew. I'd like to go to boarding
school for the fun of it, but I do hate to study. Papa thinks
maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated, remembering that she had been cautioned not to
tell his plans, for fear they might not be successful, but it
was hard for Carrie to keep such a beautiful secret, when she
felt so confident that this kind, big-hearted father would succeed
in overcoming even Mr. Catt's prejudices in regard to a boarding-school
education for his one small daughter.</p>

<p>"Maybe what?"</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;just _may_be&mdash;he can get your father to let you go."</p>

<p>Tabitha was silent for a moment and the black eyes shone wistfully;
then she answered with a heavy sigh, "There isn't the <em>least</em>
chance of Dad's letting me go, Carrie. I know Dad. Didn't he tell
Tom that if Tom wanted to go to college he would have to earn
his own money, for he had no sympathy for 'higher education'?
No, he won't let me go, I know; and besides, he hasn't the money."</p>

<p>"Papa will p&mdash;" began Carrie, and then stopped. She had intended
to say, "pay all expenses," but before the words were spoken that
might raise Tabitha's hopes again, she remembered that she must
not tell this part of her father's plans, and was silent. But
apparently Tabitha had not heard, for she was saying,</p>

<p>"Tom has worked hard and earned his money for the first year
and now he is to go to Reno and live at Lincoln Hall maybe, while
he studies. Perhaps he can go clear through college without stopping.
He says he means to finish his course if it takes eight years
to get through&mdash;but it means a heap of money for him to earn,
and it will be a long time before he could help me any, and I
can't draw maps for the surveyor or weigh those little gold buttons
like Tom does to earn money. There aren't any berries around here
to pick, and Dad won't let me hunt centipedes and scorpions to
sell for specimens, like the boys do. Jack Leavitt has earned
more than ten dollars that way. Jimmy Gates kills rattlesnakes
for pay, but I'm afraid to do that, and I suppose Dad would object
to that, too. There is really nothing on the desert that a girl
can do to earn money."</p>

<p>Still Carrie was hopeful and tried to impart her optimism to
her heavy-hearted companion.</p>

<p>"I believe something will happen yet, Puss, so you can go. I
don't care about boarding school at all if you can't go too. Why,
Puss, what would I do with no one to help me with my lessons?
Papa and mamma won't be there to tell me how the horrid examples
must be worked, and I might just as well stay at home if you don't
go. I will never be able to see any sense in the lessons. You
always make everything so clear."</p>

<p>Tabitha smiled in appreciation of the compliment, but was not
comforted, for to her the hopelessness of the situation was very
evident, and she changed the conversation by observing, "I think
you have the sweetest dresses to wear there. Six new ones! Just
think of it! I never in all my life had so many at one time, and
I never had any so pretty. Two white ones, a pink, two blues and
a brown&mdash;aren't they dear? And three real hats! You ought to be
the happiest girl on earth, Carrie."</p>

<p>She bent over the bed where the new wardrobe was displayed, pretending
to examine the dainty apparel, but in reality to hide the tears
which would persist in gathering in her eyes at thought of separation
from this playmate who had helped make life so happy for her since
she had come to Silver Bow.</p>

<p>"Tabitha!"</p>

<p>How welcome that voice from across the road sounded just then
when she wanted to get away and be alone for a time with her thoughts,
and with a hasty hug of the rosy-cheeked girl still on the floor
by the bed, she rushed out of the house to answer her aunt's call.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening Tom found her sitting among the rocks
high up on the mountainside, gazing with somber eyes into the
golden west, for the ocean lay in that direction, and it was close
to the seashore that Carrie was going away to school.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Puss?" he asked gently, reading tragedy in
her mournful attitude, and secretly wondering who would champion
the little sister's cause when he had gone away to college.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, Tom," she answered, and then amended her statement;
"that is, nothing that can be helped."</p>

<p>He sat down on the rock beside her and waited for her confession,
but she was silent, and for a long time they sat staring off across
the flat to the mountains beyond, where the afterglow of the brilliant
sunset still hung and radiated from each peak. Then he spoke,
"Puss, in two weeks I leave for the University. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carson has just come home from Reno and he brought me all
sorts of booklets and views of the place and particularly of the
college buildings. Do you want to see them?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" She was all eagerness, for Tom's joys were hers, and his
achievements the pride of her heart. So he laid a bundle of papers
and pictures in her lap and drew nearer that he might make explanations
and answer the questions she was sure to ask.</p>

<p>"There is a High School there, too, Puss, and if I have success
in earning more than enough money to put me through college, I
will send for you and you will keep house for me and go to High
School there. Then when you graduate from that department, you
will be ready to go to college, and I will be earning a salary,
or maybe have an office all my own, so I can help you through
the University."</p>

<p>"That would be nice, Tom, ever so nice, but I am afraid you will
never earn the money. It will take a heap. Carrie is going away
to boarding school now, and I want to go with her, but Dad won't
let me."</p>

<p>"So you know?" The relief in Tom's voice made Tabitha look up.</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Dad yet?"</p>

<p>"No, but then I know he never would let me go and there is no
use in asking."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Tom, has he said anything to you about it?" asked Tabitha, for
she could read this brother's face like a book, and understood
now that there was more behind his words than he had told her.</p>

<p>"No, Puss, not a word," he declared.</p>

<p>But she wasn't deceived, and after a moment of silence said,
"Then Mr. Carson has."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Carson hasn't mentioned it&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>The pause was hardly perceptible, but Tabitha's quick ears discerned
it, and she triumphantly confronted Tom with the declaration,
"You heard him ask Dad!"</p>

<p>"What a mind-reader you are!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Now, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Dad said I couldn't go?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I told Carrie that was what would happen." Her voice was very
quiet, her face very calm, and the fierce outbreak he had expected
did not come. He was amazed but he understood the struggle going
on within that tempestuous heart, and was touched by her silent
despair.</p>

<p>"Puss," he ventured after another long pause, "would you rather
have me stay here with you instead of going to Reno?"</p>

<p>He held his breath for her answer and his heart beat wildly.
How could he renounce his ambitions or even postpone their fulfilment
when they meant so much to him? But his mother had left the little
sister in his care, and he was all she had to love and help her
over the rough path her feet had been treading all her short life.
What would she do without him, particularly if Carrie was to go
away, too? Miss Brooks had already gone and the Vanes might at
any time return to their city home from their long sojourn in
this little desert town. Tabitha would be bereft indeed if he
went to college. These thoughts flashed through his mind as he
asked that vital question and waited for her reply.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom!" she cried in utter surprise, "do you suppose I'd
want you to stay here with me when you've got the chance to get
a 'higher education'?" (Those words seemed to fascinate her.)
"That's better than if I could go. You're a boy&mdash;a man, I mean&mdash;and
you <em>have</em> to know lots to be a mining engineer like the
surveyor. I'm just a little girl, and it doesn't matter whether
I know anything or not. You must go to the University while you
have the chance, Tom. I wish I could help you earn the money so
you would be sure of the whole course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You precious little Puss!" he cried with a voice that would
tremble in spite of his efforts to hold it steady, and slipping
his arm around her he gave her a big, boyish hug. "Some day everything
will come out all right and I am sure it won't be too late for
boarding school and college either."</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to such demonstration even from the gentle-hearted
boy who loved her so dearly, Tabitha sat looking shyly up at the
tender brown eyes above her, thinking how nice it felt to have
his protecting arm holding her close, when without warning, he
stooped and kissed her full on the lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you are the dearest brother! I am so glad you are going
to college. Then you will grow up to be like Mr. Carson instead
of like a &mdash;Catt."</p>

<p>"Dad went to college."</p>

<p>Tabitha was startled. "Why, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did; but he was expelled for something another boy did,
and then after he started to earn his own living, his partner
cheated him out of his share in a valuable mine and&mdash;that's what
makes him what he is now."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've remembered things I heard him or Aunt Maria say, and
then today he told Mr. Carson some of the events of his life.
He <em>has</em> been rather unfortunate right straight along.
Only last New Year's someone 'jumped' one of his claims that he
had somehow neglected to prove up on."</p>

<p>"I don't see why that should make him so&mdash;so &mdash;I'm glad
you are different, Tom. Do you suppose he will keep on until he
is like the hermit of the hills?"</p>

<p>"Who is the hermit of the hills? I never heard of him before."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, you have! He lives in that little shack over there;"
pointing to a rough, dilapidated hut far down on the mountain
side, built of odds and ends of lumber and pieced out with empty
oil cans, rusted red with the rains of many winters. Made without
windows or openings of any sort, except a narrow door on one side,
it must have presented a very dreary, uninviting appearance to
its one occupant, who was the only person who had ever seen its
interior, for owing to his peculiar habits, people regarded him
as crazy and left him severely alone. He had never been known
to molest anyone, but sought rather to avoid meeting human beings,
so he was suffered to remain there in his lonely hut on the mountain
with no one but a stray cur for company.</p>

<p>"Oh, Surly Sim! I never heard him called such a fancy name before,
Puss. How did you suppose I would recognize him?"</p>

<p>"'The hermit of the hills' is a much grander sounding name than
'Surly Sim,' and he does look so lonely off there by himself.
I should hate to think of Dad shutting himself up like that and
having folks say he was crazy. He is kind to animals."</p>

<p>"How do you know, Puss?" asked the boy, quickly, surveying his
sister with apprehensive eyes. "You don't go over there, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I'm scared of him. Besides, he runs if he sees anyone
coming. Carrie and I were picking flowers the first time I ever
knew he lived there, or that there was even a house over there.
He saw us just as he climbed out of a hole&mdash;a prospect hole, I
suppose&mdash;and he ran as tight as he could for the house and shut
the door. We were scared and we ran the other way and never stopped
until we got home. Mr. Carson told us about him then and said
he had never hurt anyone, but he would rather we didn't go over
there, for he thought the man was really crazy. Since then I have
often sat up here and watched him when it wasn't too hot. He just
thinks lots of the little dog he has, and it is awfully homely;
hasn't any tail or ears and is the worst-looking color I ever
saw."</p>

<p>Tom laughed at her earnestness. "Poor dog!"</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't laugh; it <em>is</em> homely, and so is the
cat. He has my cat. I couldn't bear to keep it, Tom. Please don't
look at me like that. I was awfully hateful to it, I know, but
Dad would call it 'Pussy' and I couldn't bear the sight of it.
When I made sure the man was kind to the dog, I chased the cat
down there. I was afraid it would come back, like it always did
when I shoved it into the prospect holes; but it must have liked
him right away, for it stayed. Now he has an earless cat to go
with the dog. That was long ago, Tom, before the Vanes ever came
here to live. I wouldn't be so mean again, but I did hate that
cat terribly then. I've never tried to coax it back because it
was happier there, but I am truly sorry that I was ugly to it.
I don't want people to hate me because I have such a horrid temper
and name. I can't change the name, but I can hold on to my temper
sometimes, though it is hard work and I don't get along very well."</p>

<p>"You are getting along a great deal better than you think, Puss,
and people don't hate you. They like you more every day, which
is better than going to boarding school, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," hesitatingly, "but I would like mighty well to go with
Carrie."</p>

<p>"Well, I think some day maybe you can. Come home now, it is getting
dark and pretty soon we won't be able to see our way down through
the mesquite."</p>
