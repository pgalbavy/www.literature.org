<p>It was not the first time that Tim O'Rooney made a mistake. The
Indians were excited over something, but as yet they held no suspicion
that three white persons stood behind them and could be so easily
reached. They were talking in a wild manner, and ran several rods
from the beach, when they suddenly paused and picked up an object
over which they quarreled and were almost ready to proceed to
violence. From where our friends stood it looked as if it were
nothing more than a coat or some cast-off garment that had been
thrown aside by so me of the survivors when they were taken away
by the Relief.</p>

<p>"No, they have not seen us yet," said Howard, who was watching
them intently, while his two companions where looking upon the
readiest means of escape.</p>

<p>"Then why did they start after us, be the same token?" demanded
Tim, with a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"They are quarreling over something that lies upon the beach."</p>

<p>"If they'd only have the onspakable kindness to go to fighting
each other like a lot of Kilkenny cats, and not sthop till there's
not one of 'em left &mdash;I say if they'd have the kindness to
do that, it would be fortinit for us."</p>

<p>"Hardly probable, Tim; the fact, is they appear to have settled
the matter already, and have gone down to the edge of the sea
again."</p>

<p>"I don't see the use of our remaining here," said Howard. "We
daren't go any nearer them than we now are, while if we put back
into the country we stand a chance of getting something to eat.
As near as I can calculate, the Salinas River isn't very far away,
and California is said to be very fertile along its streams, if
it is barren in such places as this."</p>

<p>"And we may come upon a party of miners further inland."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," rejoined Howard. "The diggings are
on the other side of the Coast Range, between that and the Sierra
Nevada, in the Sacramento Valley, and I think they are further
north, too."</p>

<p>"Let's lave," said Tim; "if we only start tramping perhaps I
may git my mind off the subjact and forgit that I'm hungry enough
to eat a toad, which I'd starve to death afore I'd do the same."</p>

<p>While they were thus debating with themselves, Terror, unobserved
by any of them, whisked to the top of a high rock and announced
his discovery of the Indians by several loud, gruff barks. At
so great a distance it was impossible that the dog should be heard,
but the danger was that the lynx-eyed savages would see him, and
thus discover the presence of his friends. The peril was imminent,
and a hasty word from Howard brought the Newfoundland to their
feet.</p>

<p>But it was too late. He had scarcely ascended his perch when
an Indian caught sight of him, and giving out a strange half-whoop
and stream, he started on a full run toward him, closely followed
by half of the entire party.</p>

<p>"There's no mistake this time!" exclaimed Howard, wheeling round
and springing away. "Don't wait."</p>

<p>There was no waiting by either Tim or Elwood. The two boys were
slim and fleet-footed, and could easily distance their more awkward
companion; but they could not leave him alone, although he besought
them to secure their own safety, while he would attend to his.</p>

<p>There were several things in favor of the fugitives and several
against them. It was growing dark quite rapidly, and they had
a good start; but the pursuers ran over the rocks and bowlders
with the facility of mountain goats and gained very rapidly; they
were also familiar with the face of the country, while our friends
were literally "going blind."</p>

<p>"But don't we make 'em run!" called out Tim, glancing over his
shoulder. "Them fellers was made to travel, and if they'd only
throw down their guns and take up a sprig of the shillaleh, like
an ilegant gintleman should do, I wouldn't ax better fun than
to jine in wid 'em and tach 'em a few scientific tricks, such
as can be got in Tipperary and nowhere ilse &mdash;Worrah!&#11834;"</p>

<p>Tim's exclamation was caused by catching his foot against a large
stone and falling flat upon his face with considerable violence.
He quickly scrambled up again, while Elwood anxiously inquired
whether he was hurt by the fall.</p>

<p>"Not by the fall, plase your honor, but by the stone that whacked
me betwaan the eyes."</p>

<p>"They are gaining!" whispered Howard, pausing a moment for his
companions to come up.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it will be so dark in a few minutes that they can't
see us, and then we will hide ourselves until the danger is past.
Let us get along an fast as possible while the danger lasts."</p>

<p>They did strain themselves to the utmost, and speedily reached
a more open country, where they could travel with greater safety.
This, which at first appeared sadly against their prospects, was
really the means of securing their escape. The moment they reached
it they darted away at almost double their rate of speed, and
shortly reached another hilly portion, into which they plunged,
and running a short distance, at a signal from Howard, they dropped
flat upon their faces, and crawled beneath thy sheltering projections
of the rocks, Terror at the same time nestling down by the prostrate
form of Elwood.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they heard the tramp of their swift-footed pursuers,
who were running without exchanging words with each other, or
uttering those exultant whoops which the Indian of other portions
of our country are so accustomed to give when exulting in the
certainty of capturing their enemies.</p>

<p>Our friends did not venture to exchange a word with each other
until a long time after the Indians had passed, and nothing could
be heard to indicate that they were anywhere in the neighborhood.
Then they crawled near together and spoke in low whispers.</p>

<p>"They are gone!" said Elwood.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Howard, "but they may be watching somewhere.
We must be very careful. How is it, Terror, are there any strangers
near us?"</p>

<p>The dog snuffed the air, but made no sound, which was a negative
reply.</p>

<p>"I guess he is right," added Howard. "We will get as far away
from here as we can, for I am sure those Indians will look around
here until morning in the hope of getting us then."</p>

<p>All three crawled a considerable ways on their hands and knees,
when they stealthily arose to their feet, and seeing nothing suspicious,
followed a northeasterly direction&mdash;one that would both lead them
away from their pursuers and at the same time take them toward
the Salinas or San Buenaventura River, which point they hoped
to reach some time the next day.</p>

<p>After going some distance they walked more rapidly, and ventured
to exchange words with each other. Terror kept the advance, fully
aware of the responsibility that rested upon him. There was little
fear but that he would give timely notice of the approach of danger,
and a sense of comparative security took possession of our friends
as they proceeded.</p>

<p>To their great surprise, after journeying a half-mile or so,
the character of the country underwent a great change. The ground
became more level, and they found themselves traveling among stunted
trees and sparse vegetation. The moon did not rise until quite
late, so that until then they could barely see each other's bodies
as they moved along. This made them uncertain as to whether they
were following the right course; but they were greatly pleased
to find that they had deviated but slightly from the line they
intended to pursue.</p>

<p>All at once a low whine from Terror arrested them. At the same
instant all three detected the glimmer of a light among the trees.
Cautiously approaching, Tim O'Rooney in the advance, he said in
his husky whisper:</p>

<p>"There's an owld Injin noddin' by the fire, and if he has a gun,
or anything to eat, we'll try and get him to lend 'em to us!"</p>
