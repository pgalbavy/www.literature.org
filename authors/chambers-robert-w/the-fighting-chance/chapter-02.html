<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A house of native stone built into and among weather-scarred
rocks, one massive wing butting seaward, others nosing north and
south among cedars and outcropping ledges&mdash;the whole silver-grey
mass of masonry reddening under a westering sun, every dormer,
every leaded diamond pane aflame; this was Shotover as Siward
first beheld it.</p>

<p>Like the craggy vertebrae of a half-buried fossil splitting the
sod, a ragged line of rock rose as a barrier to inland winds;
the foreland, set here and there with tiny lawns and pockets of
bright flowers, fell away to the cliffs; and here, sheer wet black
rocks fronted the eternal battering of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>As the phaeton drew up under a pillared porte-cochere, one or
two servants appeared; a rather imposing specimen bowed them through
the doors into the hall where, in a wide chimney place, the embers
of a drift-wood fire glimmered like a heap of dusty jewels. Bars
of sunlight slanted on wall and rug, on stone floor and carved
staircase, on the bronze foliations of the railed gallery above,
where, in the golden gloom through a high window, sun-tipped tree
tops against a sky of azure stirred like burnished foliage in
a tapestry.</p>

<p>"There is nobody here, of course," observed Miss Landis to Siward
as they halted in front of the fire-place; "the season opens to-day
in this county, you see." She shrugged her pretty shoulders: "And
the women who don't shoot make the first field-luncheon a function."</p>

<p>She turned, nodded her adieux, then, over her shoulder, casually:
"If you haven't an appointment with the Sand-Man before dinner
you may find me in the gun-room."</p>

<p>"I'll be there in about three minutes," he said; "and what about
this dog?"&mdash;looking down at the Sagamore pup who stood before
him, wagging, attentive, always the gentleman to the tips of his
toes.</p>

<p>Miss Landis laughed. "Take him to your room if you like. Dogs
have the run of the house."</p>

<p>So he followed a servant to the floor above where a smiling and
very ornamental maid preceded him through a corridor and into
that heavy wing of the house which fronted the sea.</p>

<p>"Tea is served in the gun-room, sir," said the pretty maid, and
disappeared to give place to a melancholy and silent young man
who turned on the bath, laid out fresh raiment, and whispering,
"Scotch or Irish, sir?" presently effaced himself.</p>

<p>Before he quenched his own thirst Siward filled a bowl and set
it on the floor, and it seemed as though the dog would never finish
gulping and slobbering in the limpid icy water.</p>

<p>"It's the salt air, my boy," commented the young man, gravely
refilling his own glass as though accepting the excuse on his
own account.</p>

<p>Then man and beast completed ablutions and grooming and filed
out through the wide corridor, around the gallery, and down the
broad stairway to the gun-room&mdash;an oaken vaulted place illuminated
by the sun, where mellow lights sparkled on glass-cased rows of
fowling pieces and rifles, on the polished antlers of shaggy moose
heads.</p>

<p>Miss Landis sat curled up in a cushioned corner under the open
casement panes, offering herself a cup of tea. She looked up,
nodding invitation; he found a place beside her. A servant whispered,
"Scotch or Irish, sir," then set the crystal paraphernalia at
his elbow.</p>

<p>He said something about the salt air, casually; the girl gazed
meditatively at space.</p>

<p>The sound of wheels on the gravel outside aroused her from a
silence which had become a brown study; and, to Siward, presently,
she said: "Here endeth our first rendezvous."</p>

<p>"Then let us arrange another immediately," he said, stirring
the ice in his glass.</p>

<p>The girl considered him with speculative eyes: "I shouldn't exactly
know what to do with you for the next hour if I didn't abandon
you."</p>

<p>"Why bother to do anything with me? Why even give yourself the
trouble of deserting me? That solves the problem."</p>

<p>"I really don't mean that you are a problem to me, Mr. Siward,"
she said, amused; "I mean that I am going to drive again."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"No you don't see at all. There's a telegram; I'm not driving
for pleasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had not meant that either, and it annoyed her that she had
expressed herself in such terms. As a matter of fact, at the telegraphed
request of Mr. Quarrier, she was going to Black Fells Crossing
to meet his train from the Lakes and drive him back to Shotover.
The drive, therefore, was of course a drive for pleasure.</p>

<p>"I see," repeated Siward amiably.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do," she observed, rising to her graceful height.
He was on his feet at once, so carelessly, so good-humouredly
acquiescent that without any reason at all she hesitated.</p>

<p>"I had meant to show you about&mdash;the cliffs&mdash;the kennels and stables;
I'm sorry," she concluded, lingering.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he rejoined without meaning anything in
particular. That was the trouble, whatever he said, apparently
meant so much.</p>

<p>With the agreeable sensation of being regretted, she leisurely
gloved herself, then walked through the gun-room and hall, Siward
strolling beside her.</p>

<p>The dog followed them as they turned toward the door and passed
out across the terraced veranda to the driveway where a Tandem
cart was drawn up, faultlessly appointed. Quarrier's mania was
Tandem. She thought it rather nice of her to remember this.</p>

<p>She inspected the ensemble without visible interest for a few
moments; the wind freshened from the sea, fluttering her veil,
and she turned toward the east to face it. In the golden splendour
of declining day the white sails of yachts crowded landward on
the last leg before beating westward into Blue Harbour; a small
white cruiser, steaming south, left a mile long stratum of rose-tinted
smoke hanging parallel to the horizon's plane; the westering sun
struck sparks from her bright-work.</p>

<p>The magic light on land and water seemed to fascinate the girl;
she had walked a little way toward the cliffs, Siward following
silently, offering no comment on the beauty of sky and cliff.
As they halted once more the enchantment seemed to spread; a delicate
haze enveloped the sea; hints of rose colour tinted the waves;
over the uplands a pale mauve bloom grew; the sunlight turned
redder, slanting on the rocks, and every kelp-covered reef became
a spongy golden mound, sprayed with liquid flame.</p>

<p>They had turned their backs to the Tandem; the grooms looked
after them, standing motionless at the horses' heads.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward, this is too fine to miss," she said. "I will walk
as far as the headland with you. … Please smoke if you care to."</p>

<p>He did care to; several matches were extinguished by the wind
until she spread her skids as a barrier; and kneeling in their
shelter he got his light.</p>

<p>"Tobacco smoke diluted with sea breeze is delicious," she said,
as the wind whirled the aromatic smoke of his cigarette up into
her face. "Don't move, Mr. Siward; I like it; there is to me always
a faint odour of sweet-brier in the mélange. Did you ever notice
it?"</p>

<p>The breeze-blown conversation became fragmentary, veering as
capriciously as the purple wind-flaws that spread across the shoals.
But always to her question or comment she found in his response
the charm of freshness, of quick intelligence, or of a humourous
and idle perversity which stimulates without demanding.</p>

<p>Once, glancing back at the house where the T-cart and horses
stood, she said that she had better return; or perhaps she only
thought she said it, for he made no response that time. And a
few moments later they reached the headland, and the Atlantic
lay below, flowing azure from horizon to horizon&mdash;under a universe
of depthless blue. And for a long while neither spoke.</p>

<p>With her the spell endured until conscience began to stir. Then
she awoke, uneasy as always, under the shadow of restraint or
pressure, until her eyes fell on him and lingered.</p>

<p>A subtle change had come into his face; its leanness struck her
for the first time; that, and an utter detachment from his surroundings,
a sombre oblivion to everything&mdash;and to her.</p>

<p>How curiously had his face altered, how shadowy it had grown,
effacing the charm of youth, in it.</p>

<p>The slight amusement with which she had become conscious of her
own personal exclusion grew to an interest tinged with curiosity.</p>

<p>The interest continued, but when his silence became irksome to
her she said so very frankly. His absent eyes, still clouded,
met hers, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"I hate the sea," he said.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;hate it!" she repeated, too incredulous to be disappointed.</p>

<p>"There's no rest in it; it tires. A man who plays with it must
be on his guard every second. To spend a lifetime on it is ridiculous&mdash;a
whole life of intelligent effort, against perpetual, brutal, inanimate
resistance&mdash;one endless uninterrupted fight&mdash;a ceaseless human
manoeuvre against senseless menace; and then the counter attack
of the lifeless monster, the bellowing advance, the shock&mdash;and
no battle won&mdash;nothing final, nothing settled, no! only the same
eternal nightmare of surveillance, the same sleepless watch for
stupid treachery."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you don't have to fight it!" she said, astonished.</p>

<p>"No; but it is no secret&mdash;what it does to those who do. … Some
escape; but only by dying ashore before it gets them. That is
the way some of us reach Heaven; we die too quick for the Enemy
to catch us."</p>

<p>He was laughing when she said: "It is not a fight with the sea;
it is the battle of Life itself you mean."</p>

<p>"Yes, in a way, the battle of Life."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are morbid then. Is there anybody ever born who has
not a fight on his hands?"</p>

<p>"No; only I have known men tired out, unfairly, before life had
declared war on them."</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something about fair play&mdash;what our popular idol summarises
as a 'square deal'." He laughed again, easily, his face clearing.</p>

<p>"Nobody worth a square deal ever laments because he hasn't had
it," she said.</p>

<p>"I dare say that's true, too," he admitted listlessly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward, exactly what did you mean?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of men I knew; for example a man who through
generations has inherited every impulse and desire that he should
not harbour&mdash;a man with intellect enough to be aware of it, with
decency enough to desire decency. … What chance has he with the
storms which have been brewing for him even before he opened his
eyes on earth? Is that a square deal?"</p>

<p>The troubled concentration of her face was reflected now in his
own; the wind came whipping and flicking at them from league-wide
tossing wastes; the steady thunder of the sea accented the silence.</p>

<p>She said: "I suppose everybody has infinite capacity for decency
or mischief. I know that I have. And I fancy that this capacity
always remains, no matter how moral one's life may be. 'Watch
and pray' was not addressed to the guilty alone, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course. As for the balanced capacity for good and
evil, how about the inherited desire for the latter?"</p>

<p>"Who is free from that, too? Do you suppose anybody really desires
to be good?"</p>

<p>"You mean most people are so afraid not to be, that virtue becomes
a habit?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. It's a plain business proposition anyway. It pays."</p>

<p>"Celestial insurance?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Siward; do you?"</p>

<p>But he, turning to the sea, had become engrossed in his own thoughts
again; and again she was first curious, then impatient at the
ease with which he excluded her. She remembered, too, that the
cart was waiting; that she had scarcely time now to make the train.</p>

<p>She stood irresolute, inert, disinclined to bestir herself. An
inborn aptitude for drifting, which threatened to become a talent
for indecision, had always alternated in her with sudden impulsive
conclusions; and when her pride was involved, in decisions which
sometimes scarcely withstood the analysis of reason.</p>

<p>Physically healthy, mentally unawakened, sentimentally incredulous,
totally ignorant of any master passion, and conventionally drilled,
her beauty and sweet temper had carried her easily on the frothy
crest of her first season, over the eligible and ineligible alike,
leaving her at Lenox, a rather tired and breathless girl, in love
with pleasure and the world which treated her so well.</p>

<p>The death of her mother abroad had made little impression upon
her&mdash;her uncle, Major Belwether, having cared for her since her
father's death when she was ten years old. So, although the scandal
of her mother's self-exile had been in a measure condoned by a
tardy marriage to the man for whom she had left everything, her
daughter had grown up ignorant of any particular feeling for a
mother she could scarcely remember.</p>

<p>However, she wore black and went nowhere for the second winter,
during which time she learned a great deal concerning the unconventional
proclivities of the women of her race and family, enough to impress
her so seriously that on an exaggerated impulse she had come to
one of her characteristic decisions.</p>

<p>That decision was to break the unsavoury record at the first
justifiable opportunity. And the opportunity came in the shape
of Quarrier. As though wedlock were actually the sanctuary which
an alarmed nation pretends it to be!</p>

<p>Now, approaching the threshold of a third and last season, and
having put away her almost meaningless mourning, there had stolen
into her sense of security something irksome in the promise she
had made to give Quarrier a definite answer before winter.</p>

<p>Perhaps it had been the lack of interest in the people at Shotover,
perhaps a mental review of her ancestors' capricious records&mdash;perhaps
a characteristic impulse that had directed a telegram to Quarrier
after a midnight confab with Grace Ferrall.</p>

<p>However it may have been, she had summoned him. And now he was
on his way to get his answer, the best whip, the most eagerly
discussed, and one of the wealthiest unmarried men in America.</p>

<p>Lingering irresolutely, considering with idle eyes the shadows
lengthening across the sun-shot moorland, the sound of Siward's
even voice aroused her from a meditation bordering on lassitude.</p>

<p>She answered vaguely. He spoke again; all the agreeable, gentle,
humourous charm dominant once more&mdash;releasing her from the growing
tension of her own thoughts, absolving her from the duty of immediate
decision.</p>

<p>"I feel curiously lazy," she said; "perhaps from our long drive."
She seated herself on the turf. "Talk to me, Mr. Siward&mdash;in that
lazy way of yours."</p>

<p>What he had to say proved inconsequent enough, an irrelevant
suggestion concerning the training of field-dogs for close covert
work and the reasons for not breaking such dogs on quail. Then
the question of cross-breeding came up, and he gave his opinion
on the qualities of "droppers." To which she replied, sleepily;
and the conversation veered again toward the mystery of heredity,
and the hopelessness of escape from its laws as illustrated now
by the Sagamore pup, galloping nose in the wind, having scented
afar the traces of the forbidden rabbit.</p>

<p>"His ancestors turned 'round and 'round to flatten the long reeds
and grasses in their lairs before lying down," observed Siward.
"He does it, too, where there is nothing to flatten out. Did you
ever notice how many times a dog turns around before lying down?
And there goes the carefully schooled Sagamore, chasing rabbits!
Why? Because his wild ancestors chased rabbits. … Heredity? It's
a steady, unseen, pulling, dragging force. Like lightning, too,
it shatters, sometimes, where there is resistance."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Mr. Siward, that heredity is an excuse for moral
weakness?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Those inheriting nothing of evil say it is no
excuse."</p>

<p>"It is no excuse."</p>

<p>"You speak with authority," he said.</p>

<p>"With more than you are aware of," she murmured, not meaning
to say it.</p>

<p>She stood up impulsively, her fresh face turned to the distant
house, her rounded young figure poised in relief against the sky.</p>

<p>"Inherited or not, idleness, procrastination, are my besetting
sins. Can't you suggest the remedy, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"But they are only the thieves of Time; and we kill the poor
old gentleman."</p>

<p>"Leagued assassins," she repeated pensively.</p>

<p>Her gown had caught on the cliff briers; he knelt to release
it, she looking down, noting an ugly tear in the fabric.</p>

<p>"Payment for my iniquities&mdash;the first instalment," she said,
still looking down over his shoulder and watching his efforts
to release her. "Thank you, Mr. Siward. I think we ought to start,
don't you?"</p>

<p>He straightened up, smiling, awaiting her further pleasure. Her
pleasure being capricious, she seated herself again, saying: "What
I meant to say was this: evils that spring from heredity are no
excuse for misconduct in people of our sort. Environment, not
heredity, counts. And it's our business, who have every chance
in the world, to make good!"</p>

<p>He looked down, amused at the piquant incongruity of voice and
vernacular.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" she asked irrelevantly.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch. She turned her eyes toward the level
sun, conscious, and a little conscience-stricken that it was too
late for her to drive to Black Fells Crossing&mdash;unless she started
at once.</p>

<p>The sun hung low over the pines; all the scrubby foreland ran
molten gold in every tufted furrow; flock after flock of twittering
little birds whirled into the briers and out again, scattering
inland into undulating flight.</p>

<p>The zenith turned shell pink; through clotted shoals of clouds
spread spaces of palest green like calm lakes in the sky.</p>

<p>It grew stiller; the wind went down with the sun.</p>

<p>Doubtless he had forgotten to tell her the time; she had almost
forgotten that she had asked him. With the silence of sunset a
languor, the indolence of content, crept over her; she saw him
close his watch with the absent-minded air which she already associated
with him, and she let the question go from sheer disinclination
for the effort of repetition&mdash;let the projected drive go&mdash;acquiescent,
content that matters shape themselves without any interference
from her. The sense of ease, of physical well-being invaded her
with an agreeable relaxation as though tension somewhere had slackened.</p>

<p>They chatted on, casually, impersonally, in rather subdued tones.
The dog returned now and then to see that all was well. All was
well enough, it appeared, for she sat beside Siward, quite content,
knees clasped in her hands, exchanging impressions of life with
a man who so far had been sympathetically considerate in demanding
from her no intellectual effort.</p>

<p>The conversation drifted illogically; sometimes he stirred her
to amusement, even a hushed laughter; sometimes she smilingly
agreed with his views, sometimes she let them go, uncriticised;
or, intent on her own ideas, shook her small head in amused disapproval.</p>

<p>The stillness over all, the deepening mellow light, the blessed
indolence of the young world&mdash;and their few years in it &mdash;Youth!
That was perhaps the key to it all, after all.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," she mused aloud, knees cradled in her clasped fingers,
"to-morrow they'll shoot&mdash;with great circumstance and fuss&mdash;a
few native woodcock&mdash;there's no flight yet from the north!&mdash;a
few grouse, fewer snipe, a stray duck or two. Others will drive
motor cars over bad roads; others will ride, sail, golf&mdash;anything
to kill the eternal enemy."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Je n'en sais rien, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Mais je voudrais savoir."</p>

<p>"Pourquoi?"</p>

<p>"To lay a true course by the stars"; he looked at her blue eyes
and she laughed easily under the laughing flattery.</p>

<p>"You must seek another compass&mdash;to-morrow," she said. Then it
occurred to her that nobody could guess her decision in regard
to Quarrier; and she partly raised her eyes, looking at him, indolent
speculation under the white lids.</p>

<p>She liked him already; in fact she had liked few men as well
on such brief acquaintance.</p>

<p>"You know the majority of the people here, or coming, don't you?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>She began: "The Leroy Mortimers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Lord Alderdene and Captain Voucher, and the Page twins and Marion?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Rena Bonnesdel, the Tassel girl, Agatha Caithness, Mrs. Vendenning&mdash;all
sorts, all sets." And, with an effort: "If I'm to drive, I should
like&mdash;to&mdash;to know what time it is?"</p>

<p>He informed her; and she, too indolent to pretend surprise, and
finding reproach easier, told him that he had no business to permit
her to forget.</p>

<p>His smiling serenity under the rebuke aroused in her a slight
resentment as though he had taken something for granted.</p>

<p>Besides, she had grown uneasy; she had wired Quarrier, saying
she would meet him and drive him over. He had replied at once,
naming his train. He was an exact man and expected method and
precision in others. She didn't exactly know how it might affect
him if his reasonable demand was unsatisfied. She did not know
him very well yet, only well enough to be aware that he was a
gentleman so precisely, so judiciously constructed, that, contemplating
his equitable perfections, her awe and admiration grew as one
on whom dawns the exquisite adjustments of an almost human machine.</p>

<p>And, thinking of him now, she again made up her mind to give
him the answer which he now had every reason to expect from her.
This decision appeared to lubricate her conscience; it ran more
smoothly now, emitting fewer creaks.</p>

<p>"You say that you know Mr. Quarrier?" she began thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Not well."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>hope you will like him, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"I do not think he likes me, Miss Landis. He has reasons not
to."</p>

<p>She looked up, suddenly remembering: "Oh&mdash;since that scrape?
What has Mr. Quarrier to do&mdash;" She did not finish the sentence.
A troubled silence followed; she was trying to remember the details&mdash;something
she had paid small attention to at the time&mdash;something so foreign
to her, so distant from her comprehension that it had not touched
her closely enough for her to remember exactly what this young
man might have done to forfeit the good-will of Howard Quarrier.</p>

<p>She looked at Siward; it was impossible that anything very bad
could come from such a man. And, pursuing her reasoning aloud:
"It couldn't have been very awful," she argued; "something foolish
about an actress, was it not? And that could not concern Mr. Quarrier."</p>

<p>"I thought you did know; I thought you&mdash;remembered&mdash;while you
were driving me over from the station&mdash;that I was dropped from
my club."</p>

<p>She flushed up: "Oh!&mdash;but&mdash;what had Mr. Quarrier to do with that?"</p>

<p>"He is a governor of that club."</p>

<p>"You mean that Mr. Quarrier had you&mdash;dropped?"</p>

<p>"What else could he do? A man who is idiot enough to risk making
his own club notorious, must take the consequences. And they say
I took that risk. Therefore Mr. Quarrier, Major Belwether&mdash;all
the governors did their duty. I &mdash;I naturally conclude that
no governor of the Patroons Club feels very kindly toward me."</p>

<p>Miss Landis sat very still, her small head bent, a flush still
brightening her fair face.</p>

<p>She recalled a few of the details now&mdash;the scandal&mdash;something
of the story. Which particular actress it was she could not remember;
but some men who had dined too freely had made the wager, and
this boy sitting beside her had accepted it&mdash;and won it, by bringing
into the sacred precincts of the Patroons Club a foolish, shameless
girl disguised in a man's evening dress.</p>

<p>That was bad enough; that somebody promptly discovered it was
worse; but worst of all was the publicity, the club's name smirched,
the young man expelled from one of the two best clubs in the metropolis.</p>

<p>To read of such things in the columns of a daily paper had meant
little to her except to repell her; to hear it mentioned among
people of her own sort had left her incurious and indifferent.
But now she saw it in a new light, with the man who had figured
in it seated beside her. Did such men as he&mdash;such attractive,
well-bred, amusing men as he&mdash;do that sort of thing?</p>

<p>There he sat, hat off, the sun touching his short, thick hair
which waved a little at the temples&mdash;a boyish mould to head and
shoulders, a cleanly outlined check and chin, a thoroughbred ear
set close&mdash;a good face. What sort of a man, then, was a woman
to feel at ease with? What eye, what mouth, what manner, what
bearing was a woman to trust?</p>

<p>"Is that the kind of man you are, Mr. Siward?" she said impulsively.</p>

<p>"It appears that I was; I don't know what I am&mdash;or may be."</p>

<p>"The pity of it!" she said, still swayed by impulse. "Why did
you do&mdash;didn't you know&mdash;realize what you were doing&mdash;bringing
discredit on your own club?"</p>

<p>"I was in no condition to know, Miss Landis."</p>

<p>The crude brutality of the expression might merely have hurt
or disgusted her had she been less intelligent. Nor, as it was,
did she fully understand why he chose to use it&mdash;unless that he
meant it in self-punishment.</p>

<p>"It's rather shameful!" she said hotly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented; "it's a bad beginning."</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>beginning! Do you mean to go on?"</p>

<p>He did not reply; his head was partly turned from her. She sat
silent for a while. The dog had returned to lie at Siward's feet,
its brown eyes tirelessly watching the man it had chosen for its
friend; and the man, without turning his eyes, dropped one hand
on the dog's head, caressing the silky ears.</p>

<p>Some sentimentalist had once said that no man who cared for animals
could be wholly bad. Inexperience inclined her to believe it.
Then too, she had that inclination for overlooking offences committed
against precept, which appears to be one of those edifying human
traits peculiar to neither sex and common to both. Besides, her
knowledge of such matters was as vague as her mind was healthy
and body wholesome. Men who dined incautiously were not remarkable
for their rarity; the actress habit, being incomprehensible to
her, meant nothing; and she said, innocently: "What men like you
can find attractive in a common woman I do not understand; there
are plenty of pretty women of your own sort. The actress cult
is beyond my comprehension; I only know it is generally condoned.
But it is not for such things that we drop men, Mr. Siward. You
know that, of course."</p>

<p>"For what do you drop men?"</p>

<p>"For falsehood, deception, any dishonesty."</p>

<p>"And you don't drop a man when you read in the papers that one
of the two best clubs in town has expelled him?"</p>

<p>She gave him a troubled glance; and, naively: "But you are still
a member of the other, are you not?" Then hardening: "It was common!
common!&mdash;thoroughly disgraceful and incomprehensible!"&mdash;and with
every word uttered insensibly warming in her heart toward him
whom she was chastening; "it was not even bad&mdash;it was worse than
being simply bad; it was stupid!"</p>

<p>He nodded, one hand slowly caressing the dog's head where it
lay across his knees.</p>

<p>She watched him a moment, hesitated, then smiling a little: "So
now I know the worst about you; do I not?" she concluded.</p>

<p>He did not answer; she waited, the smile still curving her red
mouth. Had she been too severe? She wondered. "You may help me
to my feet," she said sweetly. She was very young.</p>

<p>He rose at once, holding out his hands to aid her in that pleasantly
impersonal manner so suited to him; and now they stood together
in the purple dusk of the uplands&mdash;two people young enough to
take one another seriously.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something," she said, facing him, white hands
loosely linked behind her. "I don't exactly understand how it
has happened, but you know as well as I do that we have formed
a&mdash;an acquaintance&mdash;the sort that under normal conditions requires
a long time and several conventional and preliminary chapters.
… I should like to know what you think of our performance."</p>

<p>"I think," he said laughing, "that it is charming."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; men usually find the unconventional agreeable. What
I want to know is why I find it so, too?"</p>

<p>"Do you?" A dull colour stained his cheek-bones.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do. Is it because I've had a delightful chance to
admonish a sinner&mdash;and be&mdash;just a little sorry&mdash;that he had made
such a silly spectacle of himself?"</p>

<p>He laughed, wincing a trifle.</p>

<p>"Hence this agreeably righteous glow suffusing me," she concluded.
"So now that I have answered my own question, I think that we
had better go. … Don't you?"</p>

<p>They walked for a while, subdued, soberly picking their path
through the dusk. After a few moments she began to feel doubtful,
a little uneasy, partly from a reaction which was natural, partly
because she was not at all sure what either Quarrier or Major
Belwether would think of the terms she was already on with Siward.
Suppose they objected? She had never thwarted either of these
gentlemen. Besides she already had a temporary interest in Siward&mdash;the
interest that women always cherish, quite unconsciously, for the
man whose shortcomings they have consented to overlook.</p>

<p>As they crossed the headland, through the deepening dusk the
acetylene lamps on a cluster of motor cars spread a blinding light
across the scrub. The windows of Shotover House were brilliantly
illuminated.</p>

<p>"Our shooting-party has returned," she said.</p>

<p>They crossed the drive through the white glare of the motor lamps;
people were passing, grooms with dogs and guns and fluffy bunches
of game-birds, several women in motor costumes, veils afloat,
a man or two in shooting-tweeds or khaki.</p>

<p>As they entered the hall together, she turned to him, an indefinable
smile curving her lips; then, with a little nod, friendly and
sweet, she left him standing at the open door of the gun-room.</p>
