<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The world, and his own family, had always been inclined to love
Louis Neville, and had advanced no farther than the inclination.
There were exceptions.</p>

<p>Archie Allaire, who hated him, discussing him floridly once with
Querida at the Thumb-tack Club in the presence of a dozen others,
characterised him as "one of those passively selfish snobs whose
virtues are all negative and whose modesty is the mental complacency
of an underdone capon."</p>

<p>He was sharply rebuked by Ogilvy, Annan, and Burleson; skilfully
by Querida&mdash;so adroitly indeed that his amiable and smiling apology
for the absent painter produced a curiously depressing effect
upon Ogilvy and Annan, and even left John Burleson dully uncomfortable,
although Allaire had been apparently well drubbed.</p>

<p>"All the same," said Allaire with a sneer to Querida after the
others had departed, "Neville is really a most frightful snob.
Like a busy bacillus surrounded by a glass tube full of prepared
culture, he exists in his own intellectual exudations perfectly
oblivious to the miseries and joys of the world around him. He
hasn't time for anybody except himself."</p>

<p>Querida laughed: "What has Neville done to you, my friend?"</p>

<p>"To me?" repeated Allaire with a shrug. "Oh, nothing. It isn't
that.... All the same when I had my exhibition at the Monson Galleries
I went to him and said, 'See here, Neville, I've got some Shoe-trust
and Button-trust women to pour tea for me. Now you know a lot
of fashionable people and I want my tea-pourers to see them, and
I want the papers to say that they've been to a private view of
my exhibition.'</p>

<p>"He gave me one of those absent-treatment stares and said he'd
tell all the really interesting people he knew; and the damnedest
lot of scrubby, dowdy, down-at-the-heels tatterdemalions presented
his card at my private view that you ever saw outside an artist's
rathskeller, a lower Fifth Avenue reception, or a varnishing day!
By God, I can go to the bread-line and get that sort of lookers
myself&mdash;and I don't care whether his bunch came from Tenth Street
Colonial stock or the Washington Square nobility or the landed
gentry of Chelsea or from the purlieus of the Bronx, which is
where they apparently belong! I can get that kind myself. I wanted
automobiles and broughams and clothes, and I got one sea-going
taxi, and the dirty end of the stick! And to cap the climax he
strolled in himself with a girl whose face is familiar to everybody
who looks at bath tubs in the back of the magazines &mdash;Valerie
West! And I want to tell you I couldn't look my Shoe-trust tea-pourers
in the face; and they're so mad that I haven't got an order out
of them since."</p>

<p>Querida laughed till the tears stood in his big, velvety, almond-shaped
eyes.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come to me?" he said.</p>

<p>"Tell you the truth, Querida, I would have if I'd known then
that you were painting portraits of half of upper Fifth Avenue.
Besides," he added, naïvely, "that was before I began to see you
in the grand tier at the opera every week."</p>

<p>"It was before I sat anywhere except in the gallery," said Querida
with a humorous shrug. "Until this winter I knew nobody, either.
And very often I washed my own handkerchiefs and dried them on
the window pane. I had only fame for my laundress and notoriety
for my butcher."</p>

<p>"Hey?" said Allaire, a trifle out of countenance.</p>

<p>"It is very true. It cost me so much to paint and frame my pictures
that the prices they brought scarcely paid for models and materials."
He added, pleasantly: "I have dined more often on a box of crackers
and a jar of olives than at a table set with silver and spread
with linen." He laughed without affectation or bitterness:</p>

<p>"It has been a long road, Allaire&mdash;from a stable-loft studio
to&mdash;" he shrugged&mdash;"the 'Van Rypens' grand tier box, for example."</p>

<p>"How in God's name did you do it?" inquired Allaire, awed to
the momentary obliteration of envy.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>painted," said Querida, smiling.</p>

<p>"Sure. I know that. I suppose it was the hellish row made over
your canvases last winter that did the trick."</p>

<p>Querida's eyes were partly closed as though in retrospection.
"Also," he said, softly, "I painted a very fashionable woman&mdash;for
nothing&mdash;and to her entire satisfaction."</p>

<p>"That's the <em>real</em> thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so.... Make two or three unlovely and unlovable old
ladies lovely and lovable&mdash;on canvas&mdash;for nothing. Then society
will let you slap its powdered and painted face&mdash;yes&mdash;permit you&mdash;other
liberties&mdash;if only you will paint it and sign your canvases and
ask them a wicked price for what you give them and&mdash;for what they
yield to you."</p>

<p>Allaire's ruddy face grew ruddier; he grinned and passed a muscular
hand over his thick, handsome, fox-tinted hair.</p>

<p>"I wish I could get next," he said with a hard glance at Querida.
"I'd sting 'em."</p>

<p>"I would be very glad to introduce you to anybody I know," observed
the other.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Why not. A man who has waited as I have for opportunity understands
what others feel who are still waiting."</p>

<p>"That's damn square of you, Querida."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not square; just natural. The public table is big enough
for everybody."</p>

<p>Allaire thought a moment, slowly caressing his foxy hair.</p>

<p>"After all," he said with a nervous snicker, "you needn't be
afraid of anybody. Nobody can paint like you.... But I'd like
to get a look in, Querida. I've got to make a little money in
one way or another&mdash;" he added impudently&mdash;"and if I can't paint
well enough to sting them, there's always the chance of marrying
one of 'em."</p>

<p>Querida laughed: "Any man can always marry any woman. There's
no trick in getting any <em>wife</em> you want."</p>

<p>"Sure," grinned Allaire; "a wife is a cinch; it's the front row
that keeps good men guessing." He glanced at Querida, his gray-green
eyes brimming with an imprudent malice he could not even now deny
himself&mdash;"Also the backs of the magazines keep one guessing,"
he added, carelessly; "and I've the patience of a tom-cat, myself."</p>

<p>Querida's beautifully pencilled eyebrows were raised interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll admit that the little West girl kept me sitting on
back fences until some other fellow threw a bottle at me," said
Allaire with a disagreeable laugh. He had come as near as he dared
to taunting Querida and, afraid at the last moment, had turned
the edge of it on himself.</p>

<p>Querida lighted a cigarette and blew a whiff of smoke toward
the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I've an idea," he said, lazily, "that somebody is trying to
marry her."</p>

<p>"Forget it," observed Allaire in contempt. "She wouldn't stand
for the sort who marry her kind. She'll land hard on her neck
one of these days, and the one best bet will be some long-faced
Botticelli with heavenly principles and the moral stability of
a tumbler pigeon. Then there'll be hell to pay; but <em>he</em>
will get over it and she'll get aboard the toboggan. That's the
way it ends, Querida."</p>

<p>Querida sipped his coffee and glanced out of the club window.
From the window he could see the roof of the studio building where
Neville lived. And he wondered how far Valerie was from that building
at the present moment, wondered, and sipped his coffee.</p>

<p>He was a man whose career had been builded upon perseverance.
He had begun life by slaying every doubt. And his had been a bitter
life; but he had suffered smilingly; the sordid struggle along
the edges of starvation had hardened nothing of his heart.</p>

<p>Sensitive, sympathetic, ardent, proud, and ambitious with the
quiet certainty of a man predestined, he had a woman's capacity
for patience, for suffering, and for concealment, but not for
mercy. And he cared passionately for love as he did for beauty&mdash;had
succumbed to both in spirit oftener than in the caprice of some
inconsequential amourette.</p>

<p>But never, until he came to know Valerie West, had a living woman
meant anything vital to his happiness. Yet, what she aroused in
him was that part of his nature to which he himself was a stranger&mdash;a
restless, sensuous side which her very isolation and exposure
to danger seemed to excite the more until desire to control her,
to drive others away, to subdue, master, mould her, make her his
own, obsessed him. And he had tried it and failed; and had drawn
aside, fiercely, still watching and determined.</p>

<p>Some day he meant to marry properly. He had never doubted his
ability to do so even in the sordid days. But there was no hurry,
and life was young, and so was Valerie West&mdash;young enough, beautiful
enough to bridge the years with him until his ultimate destiny
awaited him.</p>

<p>And all was going well again with him until that New-year's night;
and matters had gone ill with him since then&mdash;so ill that he could
not put the thought of it from him, and her beauty haunted him&mdash;and
the expression of Neville's eyes!&mdash;</p>

<p>But he remained silent, quiet, alert, watching and waiting with
all his capacity for enduring. And he had now something else to
watch&mdash;something that his sensitive intuition had divined in a
single unfinished canvas of Neville's.</p>

<p>So far there had been but one man supreme in the new world as
a great painter of sunlight and of women. There could not be two.
And he already felt the approach of a shadow menacing the glory
of his sunlight&mdash;already stood alert and fixedly observant of
a young man who had painted something disquieting into an unfinished
canvas.</p>

<p>That man and the young girl whom he had painted to the astonishment
and inward disturbance of José Querida, were having no easy time
in that new world which they had created for themselves.</p>

<p>Embarked upon an enterprise in the management of which they were
neither in accord nor ever seemed likely to be, they had, so far,
weathered the storms of misunderstandings and the stress of prejudice.
Blindly confident in Love, they were certain, so far, that it
was Love itself that they worshipped no matter what rites and
ceremonies each one observed in its adoration. Yet each was always
attempting to convert the other to the true faith; and there were
days of trouble and of tears and of telephones.</p>

<p>Neville presented a frightfully complex problem to Valerie West.</p>

<p>His even-tempered indifference to others&mdash;an indifference which
had always characterised him&mdash;had left only a wider and deeper
void now filling with his passion for her.</p>

<p>They were passing through a maze of cross-purposes; his ardent
and exacting intolerance of any creed and opinion save his own
was ever forcing her toward a more formal and literal appreciation
of what he was determined must become a genuine and formal engagement&mdash;which
attitude on his part naturally produced clash after clash between
them.</p>

<p>That he entertained so confidently the conviction of her ultimate
surrender to convention, at moments vexed her to the verge of
anger. At times, too, his disposition to interfere with her liberty
tried her patience. Again and again she explained to him the unalterable
fundamentals of their pact. These were, first of all, her refusal
to alienate him from his family and his own world; second, her
right to her own individuality and freedom to support herself
without interference or unrequested assistance from him; third,
absolute independence of him in material matters and the perfect
liberty of managing her own little financial affairs without a
hint of dependence on him either before or after the great change.</p>

<p>That she posed only in costume now did not satisfy him. He did
not wish her to pose at all; and they discussed various other
theatres for her business activity. But she very patiently explained
to him that she found, in posing for interesting people, much
of the intellectual pleasure that he and other men found in painting;
that the life and the environment, and the people she met, made
her happy; and that she could not expect to meet cultivated people
in any other way.</p>

<p>"I <em>don't</em> want to learn stenography and take dictation
in a stuffy office, dear," she pleaded. "I <em>don't</em> want
to sit all day in a library where people whisper about books.
I don't want to teach in a public school or read novels to invalids,
or learn how to be a trained nurse and place thermometers in people's
mouths. I like children pretty well but I don't want to be a governess
and teach other people's children; I want to be taught myself;
I want to learn &mdash;I'm a sort of a child, too, dear; and it's
the familiarity with wiser people and brighter people and pleasant
surroundings that has made me as happy as I am&mdash;given me what
I never had as a child. You don't understand, but I'm having my
childhood now&mdash;nursery, kindergarten, parties, boarding-school,
finishing school, début&mdash;all concentrated into this happy year
of being among gay, clever, animated people."</p>

<p>"Yet you will not let me take you into a world which is still
pleasanter&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the eternal discussion immediately became inevitable, tiring
both with its earnestness and its utter absence of a common ground.
Because in him apparently remained every vital germ of convention
and of generations of training in every precept of formality;
and in her&mdash;for with Valerie West adolescence had arrived late&mdash;that
mystery had been responsible for far-reaching disturbances consequent
on the starved years of self-imprisonment, of exaltations suppressed,
of fears and doubts and vague desires and dreams ineffable possessing
the silence of a lonely soul.</p>

<p>And so, essentially solitary, inevitably lonely, out of her own
young heart and an untrained mind she was evolving a code of responsibility
to herself and to the world.</p>

<p>Her ethics and her morals were becoming what wide, desultory,
and unrestrained reading was making them; her passion for happiness
and for truth, her restless intelligence, were prematurely forming
her character. There was no one in authority to tell her&mdash;check,
guide, or direct her in the revolt from dogmatism, pedantry, sophistry
and conventionalism. And by this path youthful intelligence inevitably
passes, incredulous of snare and pitfall where lie the bones of
many a savant under magic blossoms nourished by creeds long dead.</p>

<p>"To bring no sorrow to any one, Louis&mdash;that is the way I am trying
to live," she said, seriously.</p>

<p>"You are bringing it to me."</p>

<p>"If that is so&mdash;then I had better depart as I came and leave
you in peace."</p>

<p>"It's too late."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not. Shall we try it?"</p>

<p>"Could <em>you</em> recover?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am willing to try for your sake."</p>

<p>"Do you <em>want</em> to?" he asked, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"I am not thinking of myself, Louis."</p>

<p>"I <em>want</em> you to. I don't want you <em>not</em> to think
about yourself all the time."</p>

<p>She made a hopeless gesture, opening her arms and turning her
palms outward:</p>

<p>"Kelly Neville! <em>What</em> do you suppose loving you means
to me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think of yourself at all when you love me?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I suppose I do&mdash;in a way. I know I'm fortunate, happy &mdash;<em>I&mdash;"
</em>She glanced up shyly&mdash;"I am glad that I am&mdash;loved&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You darling!"</p>

<p>She let him take her into his arms, suffered his caress, looking
at him in silence out of eyes as dark and clear and beautiful
as brown pools in a forest.</p>

<p>"You're just a bad, spoiled, perverse little kid, aren't you?"
he said, rumpling her hair.</p>

<p>"You say so."</p>

<p>"Breaking my heart because you won't marry me."</p>

<p>"No, breaking my own because you don't really love me enough,
yet."</p>

<p>"I love you too much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is literary bosh, Louis."</p>

<p>"Good God! Can't you ever understand that I'm respectable enough
to want you for my wife?"</p>

<p>"You mean that you want me for what I do not wish to be. And
you decline to love me unless I turn into a selfish, dependent,
conventional nonentity, which you adore because respectable. Is
that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"I want the laws of civilisation to safeguard you," he persisted
patiently.</p>

<p>"I need no more protection than you need. I am not a baby. I
am not afraid. Are you?"</p>

<p>"That is not the question&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes it is, dear. I stand in no fear. Why do you wish to force
me to do what I believe would be a wrong to you? Can't you respect
my disreputable convictions?"</p>

<p>"They are theories&mdash;not convictions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kelly, I'm so tired of hearing you say that!"</p>

<p>"I should think you would be, you little imp of perversity!"</p>

<p>"I am.... And I wonder how I can love you just as much, as though
you were kind and reasonable and&mdash;and minded your own business,
dear."</p>

<p>"Isn't it my business to tell the girl to whom I'm engaged what
I believe to be right?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's her business to tell <em>you</em>" she said, smiling;
and put her arms higher so that they slipped around his neck for
a moment, then were quickly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"What a thoroughly obstinate boy you are!" she exclaimed. "We're
wasting such lots of time in argument when it's all so very simple.
Your soul is your own to develop; mine is mine. <em>Noli, me tangere</em>!"</p>

<p>But he was not to be pacified; and presently she went away to
pour their tea, and he followed and sat down in an armchair near
the fire, brooding gaze fixed on the coals.</p>

<p>They had tea in hostile silence; he lighted a cigarette, but
presently flung it into the fire without smoking.</p>

<p>She said: "You know, Louis, if this is really going to be an
unhappiness to you, instead of a happiness beyond words, we had
better end it now." She added, with an irrepressible laugh, partly
nervous, "Your happiness seems to be beyond words already. Your
silence is very eloquent.... I think I'll take my doll and go
home."</p>

<p>She rose, stood still a moment looking at him where he sat, head
bent, staring into the coals; then a swift tenderness filled her
eyes; her sensitive lips quivered; and she came swiftly to him
and took his head into her arms.</p>

<p>"Dear," she whispered, "I only want to do the best for you. Let
me try in my own way. It's all for you&mdash;everything I do or think
or wish or hope is for you. Even I myself was made merely for
you."</p>

<p>Sideways on the arm of his chair, she stooped down, laying her
cheek against his, drawing his face closer.</p>

<p>"I am so hopelessly in love with you," she murmured; "if I make
mistakes, forgive me; remember only that it is because I love
you enough to die for you very willingly."</p>

<p>He drew her down into his arms. She was never quick to respond
to the deeper emotions in him, but her cheeks and throat were
flushed now, and, as his embrace enclosed her, she responded with
a sudden flash of blind passion&mdash;a moment's impulsive self-surrender
to his lips and arms&mdash;and drew away from him dazed, trembling,
shielding her face with one arm.</p>

<p>All that the swift contact was awakening in him turned on her
fiercely now; in his arms again she swayed, breathless, covering
her face with desperate hands, striving to comprehend, to steady
her senses, to reason while pulses and heart beat wildly and every
vein ran fire.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" she stammered&mdash;"this is&mdash;is wrong&mdash;wrong! Louis, I beg
you, to remember what I am to you.... Don't kiss me again&mdash;I ask
you not to &mdash;I pray that you won't.... We are &mdash;I am&mdash;engaged
to you, dear.... Oh&mdash;it is wrong&mdash;wrong, now!&mdash;all wrong between
us!"</p>

<p>"Valerie," he stammered, "you care nothing for any law&mdash;nor do
<em>I&mdash;</em>now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em>! You don't understand me! Let me go. Louis&mdash;you
don't love me enough.... This&mdash;this is madness&mdash;wickedness!&mdash;you
can't love me! You don't&mdash;you can't!"</p>

<p>"I do love you, Valerie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;or you would let me go!&mdash;or you would not kiss me again&mdash;"</p>

<p>She freed herself, breathless, crimson with shame and anger,
avoiding his eyes, and slipped out of his embrace to her knees,
sank down on the rug at his feet, and laid her head against the
chair, breathing fast, both small hands pressed to her breast.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he let her lie so; then, stooping over her,
white lipped, trembling:</p>

<p>"What can you expect if we sow the wind?"</p>

<p>She began to cry, softly: "You don't understand&mdash;you never have
understood!"</p>

<p>"I understand this: that I am ready to take you in your way,
now. I cannot live without you, and I won't. I care no longer
how I take you, or when, or where, as long as I can have you for
mine, to keep for ever, to love, to watch over, to worship....
Dear&mdash;will you speak to me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, desolately, where it lay now against his
knees, amid its tumbled hair.</p>

<p>Then he asked again for her forgiveness&mdash;almost fiercely, for
passion still swayed him with every word. He told her he loved
her, adored her, could not endure life without her; that he was
only too happy to take her on any terms she offered.</p>

<p>"Louis," she said in a voice made very small and low by the crossed
arms muffling her face, "I am wondering whether you will ever
know what love is."</p>

<p>"Have I not proved that I love you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know what it is you have proved.... We were
engaged to each other&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought you cared nothing for such conventions!"</p>

<p>She began to cry again, silently.</p>

<p>"Valerie&mdash;darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you don't understand," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Understand what, dearest&mdash;dearest&mdash;</p>

<p>"That I thought our love was its own protection&mdash;and mine."</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>She knelt there silent for a little while, then put her hand
up appealingly for his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I have been very happy in loving you," she faltered; "I have
promised you all there is of myself. And you have already had
my best self. The rest&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;whatever happens to me
&mdash;I have promised&mdash;so that there will be nothing of this
girl called Valerie West which is not all yours&mdash;all, all&mdash;every
thought, Louis, every pulse-beat&mdash;mind, soul, body.... But no
future day had been set; I had thought of none as yet. Still&mdash;since
I knew I was to be to you what I am to be, I have been very busy
preparing for it&mdash;mind, soul, my little earthly possessions, my
personal affairs in their small routine.... No bride in your world,
busy with her trousseau, has been a happier dreamer than have
I, Louis. You don't know how true I have tried to be to myself,
and to the truth as I understand it&mdash;as true as I have been to
you in thought and deed.... And, somehow, what threatened&mdash;a moment
since&mdash;frightens me, humiliates me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked up at him with dimmed eyes:</p>

<p>"You were untrue to yourself, Louis&mdash;to your own idea of truth.
And you were untrue to me. And for the first time I look at you,
ashamed and shamed."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, very white.</p>

<p>"Why did you offer our love such an insult?" she asked.</p>

<p>He made no answer.</p>

<p>"Was it because, in your heart, you hold a girl lightly who promised
to give herself to you for your own sake, renouncing the marriage
vows?"</p>

<p>"No! Good God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;is it because you do not yet love me enough? For I shall
not give myself to you until you do."</p>

<p>He hung his head.</p>

<p>"I think that is it," she said, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"No. I'm no good," he said. "And that's the truth, Valerie."
A dark flush stained his face and he turned it away, sitting there
in silence, his tense clasp tightening on the arms of the chair.
Then he said, still not meeting her eyes:</p>

<p>"Whatever your beliefs are you practice them; you are true to
your convictions, loyal to yourself. I am only a miserable, rotten
specimen of man who is true to nothing&mdash;not even to himself. I'm
not worth your trouble, Valerie."</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"Well, what am I?" he demanded in fierce disgust. "I have told
you that I believe in the conventions&mdash;and I violate every one
of them. I'm a spectacle for gods and men!" His face was stern
with self-disgust: he forced himself to meet her gaze, wincing
under it; but he went on:</p>

<p>"I know well enough that I deserve your contempt; I've acquired
plenty of self-contempt already. But I <em>do</em> love you, God
knows how or in what manner, but I love you, cur that I am&mdash;and
I respect you&mdash;oh, more that you understand, Valerie. And if I
ask your mercy on such a man as I am, it is not because I deserve
it."</p>

<p>"My mercy, Louis?"</p>

<p>She rose to her knees and laid both hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> only a man, dear&mdash;with all the lovable faults
and sins and contradictions of one. But there is no real depravity
in you any more than there is in me. Only &mdash;I think you are
a little more selfish than I am&mdash;you lose self-command&mdash;" she
blushed&mdash;"but that is because you are only a man after all....
I think, perhaps, that a girl's love is different in many ways.
Dear, my love for you is perfectly honest. You believe it, don't
you? If for one moment I thought it was otherwise, I'd never let
you see me again. If I thought for one moment that anything spiritual
was to be gained for us by denying that love to you or to myself&mdash;or
by living out life alone without you, I have the courage to do
it. Do you doubt it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>She sighed, and her gaze passed from his and became remote for
a moment, then:</p>

<p>"I want to live my life with you," she said, wistfully; "I want
to be to you all that the woman you love could possibly be. But
to me, the giving of myself to you is to be, in my heart, a ceremony
more solemn than any in the world&mdash;and it is to be a rite at which
my soul shall serve on its knees, Louis."</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;dearest," he breathed, "I know&mdash;I understand &mdash;I
ask your pardon. And I worship you."</p>

<p>Then a swift, smiling change passed over her face; and, her hands
still resting on his shoulders, kneeling there before him, she
bent forward and kissed him on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Pax," she said. "You are forgiven. Love me enough, Louis. And
when I am quite sure you do, then&mdash;then&mdash;you may ask me, and I
will answer you."</p>

<p>"I love you now, enough."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;ask," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>His lips moved in a voiceless question, she could not hear him,
but she understood.</p>

<p>"In a year, I think," she answered, forcing her eyes to meet
his, but the delicate rose colour was playing over her cheeks
and throat.</p>

<p>"As long as that?"</p>

<p>"That is not long. Besides, perhaps you won't learn to love me
enough even by that time. Do you think you will? If you really
think so&mdash;perhaps in June&mdash;"</p>

<p>She watched him as he pressed her hands together and kissed them;
laughed a little, shyly, as she suddenly divined a new tenderness
and respect in his eyes&mdash;something matching the vague exaltation
of her own romantic dreams.</p>

<p>"I will wait all my life if you wish it," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"You know I do, now."</p>

<p>She considered him, smiling. "If you truly do feel that way&mdash;perhaps&mdash;perhaps
it might really be in June&mdash;or in July&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <em>said</em> June."</p>

<p>"Listen to the decree of the great god Kelly! He says it must
be in June, and he shakes his thunderbolts and frowns."</p>

<p>"June! Say so, Valerie,"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> have said so."</p>

<p>"But there's no use in <em>my</em> saying so if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she exclaimed, "the great god totters on his pedestal
and the oracle falters and I see the mere man looking very humbly
around the corner of the shrine at me, whispering, 'June, if you
please, dear lady!'"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that's what you see and hear. Now answer me,
dear."</p>

<p>"And what am I to say?"</p>

<p>"June, please."</p>

<p>"June&mdash;please," she repeated, demurely.</p>

<p>"You darling!... What day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too early to decide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, dear!"</p>

<p>"No; I don't want to decide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Won't you answer me?"</p>

<p>"If you make me answer now, I'll be tempted to fix the first
of April."</p>

<p>"All right, fix it."</p>

<p>"It's All Fool's day, you know," she threatened. "Probably it
is peculiarly suitable for us.... Very well, then, I'll say it."</p>

<p>She was laughing when he caught her hands and looked at her,
grave, unsmiling. Suddenly her eyes filled with tears and her
lip trembled.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, I meant no mockery," she whispered. "I had already
fixed the first day of June for&mdash;for the great change in our lives.
Are you content?"</p>

<p>"Yes." And before she knew what he was doing a brilliant flashed
along her ring finger and clung sparkling to it; and she stared
at the gold circlet and the gem flashing in the firelight.</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes when she kissed it, looking at him
while her soft lips rested on the jewel.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment; then, still looking at him, she drew
the ring from her finger, touched it again with her lips, and
laid it gently in his hand.</p>

<p>"No, dear," she said.</p>

<p>He did not urge her; but she knew he still believed that she
would come to think as he thought; and the knowledge edged her
lips with tremulous humour. But her eyes were very sweet and tender
as she watched him lay away the ring as though it and he were
serenely biding their time.</p>

<p>"Such a funny boy," she said, "and such a dear one. He will never,
never grow up, will he?"</p>

<p>"Such an idiot, you mean," he said, drawing her into the big
chair beside him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean that, too," she said, impudently, nose in the air.
"Because, if I were you, Louis, I wouldn't waste any more energy
in worrying about a girl who is perfectly able to take care of
herself, but transfer it to a boy who apparently is not."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean about your painting. Dear, you've got it into that obstinate
head of yours that there's something lacking in your pictures,
and there isn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Valerie! You know there is!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! There isn't anything lacking in them. They're all
of you, Louis&mdash;every bit of you&mdash;as far as you have lived."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. As far as you have lived. Now live a little more,
and let more things come into your life. You can't paint what
isn't in you; and there's nothing in you except what you get out
of life."</p>

<p>She laid her soft cheek against his.</p>

<p>"Get a little real love out of life, Louis; a little <em>real</em>
love. Then surely, surely your canvases can not disguise that
you know what life means to us all. Love nobly; and the world
will not doubt that love is noble; love mercifully; and the world
will understand mercy. For I believe that what you are must show
in your work, dear.</p>

<p>"Until now the world has seen in your work only the cold splendour,
or dreamy glamour, or the untroubled sweetness and brilliancy
of passionless romance. I love your work. It is happiness to look
at it; it thrills, bewitches, enthralls!... Dear, forgive me if
in it I have not yet found a deeper inspiration.... And that inspiration,
to be there, must be first in you, my darling&mdash;born of a wider
interest in your fellow men, a little tenderness for friends&mdash;a
more generous experience and more real sympathy with humanity&mdash;and
perhaps you may think it out of place for me to say it&mdash;but&mdash;a
deeper, truer, spiritual conviction.</p>

<p>"Do you think it strange of me to have such convictions? I can't
escape them. Those who are merciful, those who are kind, to me
are Christ-like. Nothing else matters. But to be kind is to be
first of all interested in the happiness of others. And you care
nothing for people. You <em>must</em> care, Louis!</p>

<p>"And, somehow, you who are, at heart, good and kind and merciful,
have not really awakened real love in many of those about you.
For one thing your work has absorbed you. But if, at the same
time, you could pay a little more attention to human beings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Valerie!" he said in astonishment, "I have plenty of friends.
Do you mean to say I care nothing for them?"</p>

<p>"How much <em>do</em> you care, Louis?"</p>

<p>"Why, <em>I&mdash;" </em>He fell silent, troubled gaze searching hers.</p>

<p>She smiled: "Take Sam, for example. The boy adores you. He's
a rotten painter, I know&mdash;and you don't even pretend to an interest
in what he does because you are too honest to praise it. But,
Louis, he's a lovable fellow&mdash;and he does the best that's in him.
You needn't pretend to care for what he does&mdash;but if you could
show that you do care for and respect the effort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do, Valerie&mdash;when I think about it!"</p>

<p>"Then think about it; and let Sam know that you think about his
efforts and himself. And do the same for Harry Annan. He's a worse
painter than Sam&mdash;but do you think he doesn't know it? Don't you
realise what a lot of heartache the monkey-shines of those two
boys conceal?"</p>

<p>"I am fond of them," he said, slowly. "I like people, even if
I don't show it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Louis! Louis! That is the world's incurable hurt&mdash;the silence
that replies to its perplexity&mdash;the wistful appeal that remains
unanswered.... And many, many vex God with the desolation of their
endless importunities and complaints when a look, a word, a touch
from a human being would relieve them of the heaviest of all burdens&mdash;a
sad heart's solitude."</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, impulsively:</p>

<p>"You little angel," he said, tenderly.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only a human girl who has learned what solitude can mean."</p>

<p>"I shall make you forget the past," he said.</p>

<p>"No, dear&mdash;for that might make me less kind." She put her lips
against his cheek, thoughtfully: "And &mdash;I think&mdash;that you
are going to need all the tenderness in me&mdash;some day, Louis&mdash;as
I need all of yours.... We shall have much to learn&mdash;after the
great change.... And much to endure. And I think we will need
all the kindness that we can give each other&mdash;and all that the
world can spare us."</p>
