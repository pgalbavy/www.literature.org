<p>"I pray you have done," said Godwin, "it is but a scratch from
the beast's claws. I am ashamed that you should put your hair to
such vile uses. Give me a little water."
</p>
<p>He asked it of Wulf, but Masouda rose without a word and fetched
the water, in which she mingled wine. Godwin drank of it and his
faintness left him, so that he was able to stand up and move his
arms and legs.
</p><p>"Why," he said, "it is nothing; I was only shaken. That lioness
did not hurt me at all."
</p><p>"But you hurt the lioness," said Wulf, with a laugh. "By St. Chad
a good thrust!" and he pointed to the long sword driven up to the
hilt in the brute's breast. "Why, I swear I could not have made a
better myself."
</p><p>"I think it was the lion that thrust," answered Godwin. "I only
held the sword straight. Drag it out, brother, I am still too
weak."
</p><p>So Wulf set his foot upon the breast of the lion and tugged and
tugged until at length he loosened the sword, saying as he
strained at it:
</p><p>"Oh! what an Essex hog am I, who slept through it all, never
waking until Masouda seized me by the hair, and I opened my eyes
to see you upon the ground with this yellow beast crouched on the
top of you like a hen on a nest egg. I thought that it was alive
and smote it with my sword, which, had I been fully awake, I
doubt if I should have found the courage to do. Look," and he
pushed the lioness's head with his foot, whereon it twisted round
in such a fashion that they perceived for the first time that it
only hung to the shoulders by a thread of skin.
</p><p>"I am glad you did not strike a little harder," said Godwin, "or
I should now be in two pieces and drowned in my own blood,
instead of in that of this dead brute," and he looked ruefully at
his burnous and hauberk, that were soaked with gore.
</p><p>"Yes," said Wulf, "I never thought of that. Who would, in such a
hurry?"
</p><p>"Lady Masouda," asked Godwin, "when last I saw you you were
hanging from those jaws. Say, are you hurt?"
</p><p>"Nay," she answered, "for I wear mail like you, and the teeth
glanced on it so that she held me by the cloak only. Come, let us
skin the beast, and take its pelt as a present to the lord
Al-je-bal."
</p><p>"Good," said Godwin, "and I give you the claws for a necklace."
</p><p>"Be sure that I will wear them," she answered, and helped Wulf to
flay the lioness while he sat by resting. When it was done Wulf
went to the little cave and walked into it, to come out again
with a bound.
</p><p>"Why!" he said, "there are more of them in there. I saw their
eyes and heard them snarl. Now, give me a burning branch and I
will show you, brother, that you are not the only one who can
fight a lion."
</p><p>"Let be, you foolish man," broke in Masouda. "Doubtless those are
her cubs, and if you kill them, her mate will follow us for
miles; but if they are left safe he will stay to feed them. Come,
let us begone from this place as swiftly as we can."
</p><p>So having shown them the skin of the lion, that they might know
it was but a dead thing, at the sight of which they snorted and
trembled, they packed it upon one of the mules and rode off
slowly into a valley some five miles away, where was water but no
trees. Here, since Godwin needed rest, they stopped all that day
and the night which followed, seeing no more of lions, though
they watched for them sharply enough. The next morning, having
slept well, he was himself again, and they started forward
through a broken country towards a deep cleft, on either side of
which stood a tall mountain.
</p><p>"This is Al-je-bal's gateway," said Masouda, "and tonight we
should sleep in the gate, whence one day's ride brings us to his
city."
</p><p>So on they rode till at length, perched upon the sides of the
cleft, they saw a castle, a great building, with high walls, to
which they came at sunset. It seemed that they were expected in
this place, for men hastened to meet them, who greeted Masouda
and eyed the brethren curiously, especially after they had heard
of the adventure with the lion. These took them, not into the
castle, but to a kind of hostelry at its back, where they were
furnished with food and slept the night.
</p><p>Next morning they went on again to a hilly country with beautiful
and fertile valleys. Through this they rode for two hours,
passing on their way several villages, where sombre-eyed people
were labouring in the fields. From each village, as they drew
near to it, horsemen would gallop out and challenge them, whereon
Masouda rode forward and spoke with the leader alone. Then he
would touch his forehead with his hand and bow his head and they
rode on unmolested.
</p><p>"See," she said, when they had thus been stopped for the fourth
time, "what chance you had of winning through to Masyaf
unguarded. Why, I tell you, brethren, that you would have been
dead before ever you passed the gates of the first castle."
</p><p>Now they rode up a long slope, and at its crest paused to look
upon a marvellous scene. Below them stretched a vast plain, full
of villages, cornfields, olive-groves, and vineyards. In the
centre of this plain, some fifteen miles away, rose a great
mountain, which seemed to be walled all about. Within the wall
was a city of which the white, flat-roofed houses climbed the
slopes of the mountain, and on its crest a level space of land
covered with trees and a great, many-towered castle surrounded by
more houses.
</p><p>"Behold the home of Al-je-bal, Lord of the Mountain," said
Masouda, "where we must sleep to-night. Now, brethren, listen to
me. Few strangers who enter that castle come thence living. There
is still time; I can pass you back as I passed you hither. Will
you go on?"
</p><p>"We will go on," they answered with one breath.
</p><p>"Why? What have you to gain? You seek a certain maiden. Why seek
her here whom you say has been taken to Salah-ed-din? Because the
Al-je-bal in bygone days swore to befriend one of your blood. But
that Al-je-bal is dead, and another of his line rules who took no
such oath. How do you know that he will befriend you--how that he
will not enslave or kill you? I have power in this land, why or
how does not matter, and I can protect you against all that dwell
in it--as I swear I will, for did not one of you save my life?"
and she glanced at Godwin, "except my lord Sinan, against whom I
have no power, for I am his slave."
</p><p>"He is the enemy of Saladin, and may help us for his hate's
sake."
</p><p>"Yes, he is the enemy of Salah-ed-din now more than ever. He may
help you or he may not. Also," she added with meaning, "you may
not wish the help he offers. Oh!" and there was a note of
entreaty in her voice, "think, think! For the last time, I pray
you think!"
</p><p>"We have thought," answered Godwin solemnly; "and, whatever
chances, we will obey the command of the dead."
</p><p>She heard and bowed her head in assent, then said, looking up
again:
</p><p>"So be it. You are not easily turned from your purpose, and I
like that spirit well. But hear my counsel. While you are in this
city speak no Arabic and pretend to understand none. Also drink
nothing but water, which is good here, for the lord Sinan sets
strange wines before his guests, that, if they pass the lips,
produce visions and a kind of waking madness in which you might
do deeds whereof you were afterwards ashamed. Or you might swear
oaths that would sit heavy on your souls, and yet could not be
broken except at the cost of life."
</p><p>"Fear not," answered Wulf. "Water shall be our drink, who have
had enough of drugged wines," for he remembered the Christmas
feast in the Hall at Steeple.
</p><p>"You, Sir Godwin," went on Masouda, "have about your neck a
certain ring which you were mad enough to show to me, a
stranger--a ring with writing on it which none can read save the
great men that in this land are called the dais. Well, as it
chances, the secret is safe with me; but be wise; say nothing of
that ring and let no eye see it."
</p><p>"Why not?" asked Godwin. "It is the token of our dead uncle to
the Al-je-bal."
</p><p>She looked round her cautiously and replied:
</p><p>"Because it is, or was once, the great Signet, and a day may come
when it will save your lives. Doubtless when the lord who is dead
thought it gone forever he caused another to be fashioned, so
like that I who have had both in my hand could not tell the two
apart. To him who holds that ring all gates are open; but to let
it be known that you have its double means death. Do you
understand?"
</p><p>They nodded, and Masouda continued:
</p><p>"Lastly--though you may think that this seems much to ask--trust
me always, even if I seem to play you false, who for your sakes,"
and she sighed, "have broken oaths and spoken words for which the
punishment is to die by torment. Nay, thank me not, for I do only
what I must who am a slave--a slave."
</p><p>"A slave to whom?" asked Godwin, staring at her.
</p><p>"To the Lord of all the Mountains," she answered, with a smile
that was sweet yet very sad; and without another word spurred on
her horse.
</p><p>"What does she mean," asked Godwin of Wulf, when she was out of
hearing, "seeing that if she speaks truth, for our sakes, in
warning us against him, Masouda is breaking her fealty to this
lord?"
</p><p>"I do not know, brother, and I do not seek to know. All her talk
may be a part of a plot to blind us, or it may not. Let well
alone and trust in fortune, say I."
</p><p>"A good counsel," answered Godwin, and they rode forward in
silence.
</p><p>They crossed the plain, and towards evening came to the wall of
the outer city, halting in front of its great gateway. Here, as
at the first castle, a band of solemn-looking mounted men came
out to meet them, and, having spoken a few words with Masouda,
led them over the drawbridge that spanned the first rock-cut
moat, and through triple gates of iron into the city. Then they
passed up a street very steep and narrow, from the roofs and
windows of the houses on either side of which hundreds of
people--many of whom seemed to be engaged at their evening
prayer--watched them go by. At the head of this street they
reached another fortified gateway, on the turrets of which, so
motionless that at first they took them to be statues cut in
stone, stood guards wrapped in long white robes. After parley,
this also was opened to them, and again they rode through triple
doors.
</p><p>Then they saw all the wonder of that place, for between the outer
city where they stood and the castle, with its inner town which
was built around and beneath it yawned a vast gulf over ninety
feet in depth. Across this gulf, built of blocks of stone, quite
unrailed, and not more than three paces wide, ran a causeway some
two hundred yards in length, which causeway was supported upon
arches reared up at intervals from the bottom of the gulf.
</p><p>"Ride on and have no fear," said Masouda. "Your horses are
trained to heights, and the mules and mine will follow."
</p><p>So Godwin, showing nothing in his face of the doubt that he felt
in his heart, patted Flame upon the neck, and, after hanging back
a little, the horse started lifting its hoofs high and glancing
from side to side at the terrible gulf beneath. Where Flame went
Smoke knew that it could go, and came on bravely, but snorting a
little, while the mules, that did not fear heights so long as the
ground was firm beneath their feet, followed. Only Masouda's
horse was terrified, backed, and strove to wheel round, till she
drove the spur into it, when of a sudden it started and came over
at a gallop.
</p><p>At length they were across, and, passing under another gateway
which had broad terraces on either side of it, rode up the long
street beyond and entered a great courtyard, around which stood
the castle, a vast and frowning fortress. Here a white-robed
officer came forward, greeting them with a low bow, and with him
servants who assisted them to dismount. These men took the horses
to a range of stables on one side of the courtyard, whither the
brethren followed to see their beasts groomed and fed. Then the
officer, who had stood patiently by the while, conducted them
through doorways and down passages to the guest chambers, large,
stone-roofed rooms, where they found their baggage ready for
them. Here Masouda said that she would see them again on the
following morning, and departed in company with the officer.
</p><p>Wulf looked round the great vaulted chamber, which, now that the
dark had fallen, was lit by flickering lamps set in iron
brackets upon the wall, and said:
</p><p>"Well, for my part, I had rather pass the night in a desert among
the lions than in this dismal place."
</p><p>Scarcely were the words out of his lips when curtains swung aside
and beautiful women entered, clad in gauzy veils and bearing
dishes of food. These they placed upon the ground before them,
inviting them to eat with nods and smiles, while others brought
basins of scented water, which they poured over their hands. Then
they sat down and ate the food that was strange to them, but very
pleasant to the taste; and while they ate, women whom they could
not see sang sweet songs, and played upon harps and lutes. Wine
was offered to them also; but of this, remembering Masouda's
words, they would not drink, asking by signs for water, which was
brought after a little pause.
</p><p>When their meal was done, the beautiful women bore away the
dishes, and black slaves appeared. These men led them to baths
such as they had never seen, where they washed first in hot
water, then in cold. Afterwards they were rubbed with
spicy-smelling oils, and having been wrapped in white robes,
conducted back to their chamber, where they found beds spread for
them. On these, being very weary, they lay down, when the
strange, sweet music broke out afresh, and to the sound of it
they fell asleep.
</p><p>When they awoke it was to see the light streaming through the
high, latticed windows.
</p><p>"Did you sleep well, Godwin?" asked Wulf.
</p><p>"Well enough," answered his brother, "only I dreamed that
throughout the night people came and looked at me."
</p><p>"I dreamed that also," said Wulf; "moreover, I think that it was
not all a dream, since there is a coverlet on my bed which was
not there when I went to sleep."
</p><p>Godwin looked at his own, where also was another coverlet added,
doubtless as the night grew colder in that high place.
</p><p>"I have heard of enchanted castles," he said; "now I think that
we have found one."
</p><p>"Ay," replied Wulf, "and it is well enough while it lasts."
</p><p>They rose and dressed themselves, putting on clean garments and
their best cloaks, that they had brought with them on the mules,
after which the veiled women entered the room with breakfast, and
they ate. When this was finished, having nothing else to do, they
made signs to one of the women that they wished for cloths
wherewith to clean their armour, for, as they had been bidden,
they pretended to understand no word of Arabic. She nodded, and
presently returned with a companion carrying leathers and paste
in a jar. Nor did they leave them, but, sitting upon the ground,
whether the brethren willed it or no, took the shirts of mail and
rubbed them till they shone like silver, while Godwin and Wulf
polished their helms, spurs, and bucklers, cleansing their swords
and daggers also, and sharpening them with a stone which they
carried for that purpose.
</p><p>Now as these women worked, they began to talk to each other in a
low voice, and some of their talk, though not all, the brethren
understood.
</p><p>"A handsome pair truly," said the first. "We should be fortunate
if we had such men for husbands, although they are Franks and
infidels."
</p><p>"Ay," answered the other; "and from their likeness they must be
twins. Now which of them would you choose?"
</p><p>Then for a long while they discussed them, comparing them feature
by feature and limb by limb, until the brethren felt their faces
grow red beneath the sunburn and scrubbed furiously at their
armour to show a reason for it. At length one of the women said:
</p><p>"It was cruel of the lady Masouda to bring these birds into the
Master's net. She might have warned them."
</p><p>"Masouda was ever cruel," answered the other, "who hates all men,
which is unnatural. Yet I think if she loved a man she would love
him well, and perhaps that might be worse for him than her hate."
</p><p>"Are these knights spies?" asked the first.
</p><p>"I suppose so," was the answer, "silly fellows who think that
they can spy upon a nation of spies. They would have done better
to keep to fighting, at which, doubtless, they are good enough.
What will happen to them?"
</p><p>"What always happens, I suppose--a pleasant time at first; then,
if they can be put to no other use, a choice between the faith
and the cup. Or, perhaps, as they seem men of rank, they may be
imprisoned in the dungeon tower and held to ransom. Yes, yes; it
was cruel of Masouda to trick them so, who may be but travellers
after all, desiring to see our city."
</p><p>Just then the curtain was drawn, and through it entered Masouda
herself. She was dressed in a white robe that had a dagger worked
in red over the left breast, and her long black hair fell upon
her shoulders, although it was half hid by the veil, open in
front, which hung from her head. Never had they seen her look so
beautiful as she seemed thus.
</p><p>"Greetings, brothers Peter and John. Is this fit work for
pilgrims?" she said in French, pointing to the long swords which
they were sharpening.
</p><p>"Ay," answered Wulf, as they rose and bowed to her, "for pilgrims
to this--holy city."
</p><p>The women who were cleaning the mail bowed also, for it seemed
that here Masouda was a person of importance. She took the
hauberks from their hands.
</p><p>"Ill cleansed," she said sharply. "I think that you girls talk
better than you work. Nay, they must serve. Help these lords to
don them. Fools, that is the shirt of the grey-eyed knight. Give
it me; I will be his squire," and she snatched the hauberk from
their hands, whereat, when her back was turned, they glanced at
one another.
</p><p>"Now," she said, when they were fully armed and had donned their
mantles, "you brethren look as pilgrims should. Listen, I have a
message for you. The Master"--and she bowed her head, as did the
women, guessing of whom she spoke--"will receive you in an hour's
time, till when, if it please you, we can walk in the gardens,
which are worth your seeing."
</p><p>So they went out with her, and as they passed towards the curtain
she whispered:
</p><p>"For your lives' sake, remember all that I have told you--above
everything, about the wine and the ring, for if you dream the
drink-dream you will be searched. Speak no word to me save of
common matters."
</p><p>In the passage beyond the curtain white-robed guards were
standing, armed with spears, who turned and followed them without
a word. First they went to the stables to visit Flame and Smoke,
which whinnied as they drew near. These they found well-fed and
tended--indeed, a company of grooms were gathered round them,
discussing their points and beauty, who saluted as the owners of
such steeds approached. Leaving the stable, they passed through
an archway into the famous gardens, which were said to be the
most beautiful in all the East. Beautiful they were indeed,
planted with trees, shrubs, and flowers such as are seldom seen,
while between fern-clad rocks flowed rills which fell over deep
cliffs in waterfalls of foam. In places the shade of cedars lay
so dense that the brightness of day was changed to twilight, but
in others the ground was open and carpeted with flowers which
filled the air with perfume. Everywhere grew roses, myrtles, and
trees laden with rich fruits, while from all sides came the sound
of cooing doves and the voices of many bright-winged birds which
flashed from palm to palm.
</p><p>On they walked, down the sand-strewn paths for a mile or more,
accompanied by Masouda and the guard. At length, passing through
a brake of whispering, reed-like plants, of a sudden they came to
a low wall, and saw, yawning black and wide at their very feet,
that vast cleft which they had crossed before they entered the
castle.
</p><p>"It encircles the inner city, the fortress, and its grounds,"
said Masouda; "and who lives to-day that could throw a bridge
across it? Now come back."
</p><p>So, following the gulf round, they returned to the castle by
another path, and were ushered into an ante-room, where stood a
watch of twelve men. Here Masouda left them in the midst of the
men, who stared at them with stony eyes. Presently she returned,
and beckoned to them to follow her. Walking down a long passage
they came to curtains, in front of which were two sentries, who
drew these curtains as they approached. Then, side by side, they
entered a great hall, long as Stangate Abbey church, and passed
through a number of people, all crouched upon the ground. Beyond
these the hall narrowed as a chancel does.
</p><p>Here sat and stood more people, fierce-eyed, turbaned men, who
wore great knives in their girdles. These, as they learned
afterwards, were called the fedai, the sworn assassins, who lived
but to do the command of their lord the great Assassin. At the
end of this chancel were more curtains, beyond which was a
guarded door. It opened, and on its further side they found
themselves in full sunlight on an unwalled terrace, surrounded by
the mighty gulf into which it was built out. On the right and
left edges of this terrace sat old and bearded men, twelve in
number, their heads bowed humbly and their eyes fixed upon the
ground. These were the dais or councillors.
</p><p>At the head of the terrace, under an open and beautifully carved
pavilion of wood, stood two gigantic soldiers, having the red
dagger blazoned on their white robes. Between them was a black
cushion, and on the cushion a black heap. At first, staring out
of the bright sunlight at this heap in the shadow, the brethren
wondered what it might be. Then they caught sight of the glitter
of eyes, and knew that the heap was a man who wore a black turban
on his head and a black, bell-shaped robe clasped at the breast
with a red jewel. The weight of the man had sunk him down deep
into the soft cushion, so that there was nothing of him to be
seen save the folds of the bell-shaped cloak, the red jewel, and
the head. He looked like a coiled-up snake; the dark and
glittering eyes also were those of a snake. Of his features, in
the deep shade of the canopy and of the wide black turban, they
could see nothing.
</p><p>The aspect of this figure was so terrible and inhuman that the
brethren trembled at the sight of him. They were men and he was a
man, but between that huddled, beady-eyed heap and those two tall
Western warriors, clad in their gleaming mail and coloured
cloaks, helm on brow, buckler on arm, and long sword at side, the
contrast was that of death and life.
