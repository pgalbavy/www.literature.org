<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> For a while after his second’s answering hoot Massy hung over
the engine-room gloomily. Captain Whalley, who, by the power of
five hundred pounds, had kept his command for three years, might
have been suspected of never having seen that coast before. He
seemed unable to put down his glasses, as though they had been
glued under his contracted eyebrows. This settled frown gave to
his face an air of invincible and just severity; but his raised
elbow trembled slightly, and the perspiration poured from under
his hat as if a second sun had suddenly blazed up at the zenith
by the side of the ardent still globe already there, in whose
blinding white heat the earth whirled and shone like a mote of
dust.</p>

<p>From time to time, still holding up his glasses, he raised his
other hand to wipe his streaming face. The drops rolled down his
cheeks, fell like rain upon the white hairs of his beard, and
brusquely, as if guided by an uncontrollable and anxious impulse,
his arm reached out to the stand of the engine-room telegraph.</p>

<p>The gong clanged down below. The balanced vibration of the dead-slow
speed ceased together with every sound and tremor in the ship,
as if the great stillness that reigned upon the coast had stolen
in through her sides of iron and taken possession of her innermost
recesses. The illusion of perfect immobility seemed to fall upon
her from the luminous blue dome without a stain arching over a
flat sea without a stir. The faint breeze she had made for herself
expired, as if all at once the air had become too thick to budge;
even the slight hiss of the water on her stem died out. The narrow,
long hull, carrying its way without a ripple, seemed to approach
the shoal water of the bar by stealth. The plunge of the lead
with the mournful, mechanical cry of the lascar came at longer
and longer intervals; and the men on her bridge seemed to hold
their breath. The Malay at the helm looked fixedly at the compass
card, the Captain and the Serang stared at the coast.</p>

<p>Massy had left the skylight, and, walking flat-footed, had returned
softly to the very spot on the bridge he had occupied before.
A slow, lingering grin exposed his set of big white teeth: they
gleamed evenly in the shade of the awning like the keyboard of
a piano in a dusky room.</p>

<p>At last, pretending to talk to himself in excessive astonishment,
he said not very loud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop the engines now. What next, I wonder?"</p>

<p>He waited, stooping from the shoulders, his head bowed, his glance
oblique. Then raising his voice a shade&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I dared make an absurd remark I would say that you haven’t
the stomach to . . ."</p>

<p>But a yelling spirit of excitement, like some frantic soul wandering
unsuspected in the vast stillness of the coast, had seized upon
the body of the lascar at the lead. The languid monotony of his
sing-song changed to a swift, sharp clamor. The weight flew after
a single whir, the line whistled, splash followed splash in haste.
The water had shoaled, and the man, instead of the drowsy tale
of fathoms, was calling out the soundings in feet.</p>

<p>"Fifteen feet. Fifteen, fifteen! Fourteen, fourteen . . ."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley lowered the arm holding the glasses. It descended
slowly as if by its own weight; no other part of his towering
body stirred; and the swift cries with their eager warning note
passed him by as though he had been deaf.</p>

<p>Massy, very still, and turning an attentive ear, had fastened
his eyes upon the silvery, close-cropped back of the steady old
head. The ship herself seemed to be arrested but for the gradual
decrease of depth under her keel.</p>

<p>"Thirteen feet . . . Thirteen! Twelve!" cried the leadsman anxiously
below the bridge. And suddenly the barefooted Serang stepped away
noiselessly to steal a glance over the side.</p>

<p>Narrow of shoulder, in a suit of faded blue cotton, an old gray
felt hat rammed down on his head, with a hollow in the nape of
his dark neck, and with his slender limbs, he appeared from the
back no bigger than a boy of fourteen. There was a childlike impulsiveness
in the curiosity with which he watched the spread of the voluminous,
yellowish convolutions rolling up from below to the surface of
the blue water like massive clouds driving slowly upwards on the
unfathomable sky. He was not startled at the sight in the least.
It was not doubt, but the certitude that the keel of the Sofala
must be stirring the mud now, which made him peep over the side.</p>

<p>His peering eyes, set aslant in a face of the Chinese type, a
little old face, immovable, as if carved in old brown oak, had
informed him long before that the ship was not headed at the bar
properly. Paid off from the Fair Maid, together with the rest
of the crew, after the completion of the sale, he had hung, in
his faded blue suit and floppy gray hat, about the doors of the
Harbor Office, till one day, seeing Captain Whalley coming along
to get a crew for the Sofala, he had put himself quietly in the
way, with his bare feet in the dust and an upward mute glance.
The eyes of his old commander had fallen on him favorably&mdash;it
must have been an auspicious day&mdash;and in less than half an hour
the white men in the "Ofiss" had written his name on a document
as Serang of the fire-ship Sofala. Since that time he had repeatedly
looked at that estuary, upon that coast, from this bridge and
from this side of the bar. The record of the visual world fell
through his eyes upon his unspeculating mind as on a sensitized
plate through the lens of a camera. His knowledge was absolute
and precise; nevertheless, had he been asked his opinion, and
especially if questioned in the downright, alarming manner of
white men, he would have displayed the hesitation of ignorance.
He was certain of his facts&mdash;but such a certitude counted for
little against the doubt what answer would be pleasing. Fifty
years ago, in a jungle village, and before he was a day old, his
father (who died without ever seeing a white face) had had his
nativity cast by a man of skill and wisdom in astrology, because
in the arrangement of the stars may be read the last word of human
destiny. His destiny had been to thrive by the favor of various
white men on the sea. He had swept the decks of ships, had tended
their helms, had minded their stores, had risen at last to be
a Serang; and his placid mind had remained as incapable of penetrating
the simplest motives of those he served as they themselves were
incapable of detecting through the crust of the earth the secret
nature of its heart, which may be fire or may be stone. But he
had no doubt whatever that the Sofala was out of the proper track
for crossing the bar at Batu Beru.</p>

<p>It was a slight error. The ship could not have been more than
twice her own length too far to the northward; and a white man
at a loss for a cause (since it was impossible to suspect Captain
Whalley of blundering ignorance, of want of skill, or of neglect)
would have been inclined to doubt the testimony of his senses.
It was some such feeling that kept Massy motionless, with his
teeth laid bare by an anxious grin. Not so the Serang. He was
not troubled by any intellectual mistrust of his senses. If his
captain chose to stir the mud it was well. He had known in his
life white men indulge in outbreaks equally strange. He was only
genuinely interested to see what would come of it. At last, apparently
satisfied, he stepped back from the rail.</p>

<p>He had made no sound: Captain Whalley, however, seemed to have
observed the movements of his Serang. Holding his head rigidly,
he asked with a mere stir of his lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"Going ahead still, Serang?"</p>

<p>"Still going a little, Tuan," answered the Malay. Then added
casually, "She is over."</p>

<p>The lead confirmed his words; the depth of water increased at
every cast, and the soul of excitement departed suddenly from
the lascar swung in the canvas belt over the Sofala’s side. Captain
Whalley ordered the lead in, set the engines ahead without haste,
and averting his eyes from the coast directed the Serang to keep
a course for the middle of the entrance.</p>

<p>Massy brought the palm of his hand with a loud smack against
his thigh.</p>

<p>"You grazed on the bar. Just look astern and see if you didn’t.
Look at the track she left. You can see it plainly. Upon my soul,
I thought you would! What made you do that? What on earth made
you do that? I believe you are trying to scare me."</p>

<p>He talked slowly, as it were circumspectly, keeping his prominent
black eyes on his captain. There was also a slight plaintive note
in his rising choler, for, primarily, it was the clear sense of
a wrong suffered undeservedly that made him hate the man who,
for a beggarly five hundred pounds, claimed a sixth part of the
profits under the three years’ agreement. Whenever his resentment
got the better of the awe the person of Captain Whalley inspired
he would positively whimper with fury.</p>

<p>"You don’t know what to invent to plague my life out of me. I
would not have thought that a man of your sort would condescend
. . ."</p>

<p>He paused, half hopefully, half timidly, whenever Captain Whalley
made the slightest movement in the deck-chair, as though expecting
to be conciliated by a soft speech or else rushed upon and hunted
off the bridge.</p>

<p>"I am puzzled," he went on again, with the watchful unsmiling
baring of his big teeth. "I don’t know what to think. I do believe
you are trying to frighten me. You very nearly planted her on
the bar for at least twelve hours, besides getting the engines
choked with mud. Ships can’t afford to lose twelve hours on a
trip nowadays&mdash;as you ought to know very well, and do know very
well to be sure, only . . ."</p>

<p>His slow volubility, the sideways cranings of his neck, the black
glances out of the very corners of his eyes, left Captain Whalley
unmoved. He looked at the deck with a severe frown. Massy waited
for some little time, then began to threaten plaintively.</p>

<p>"You think you’ve got me bound hand and foot in that agreement.
You think you can torment me in any way you please. Ah! But remember
it has another six weeks to run yet. There’s time for me to dismiss
you before the three years are out. You will do yet something
that will give me the chance to dismiss you, and make you wait
a twelvemonth for your money before you can take yourself off
and pull out your five hundred, and leave me without a penny to
get the new boilers for her. You gloat over that idea&mdash;don’t you?
I do believe you sit here gloating. It’s as if I had sold my soul
for five hundred pounds to be everlastingly damned in the end.
. . ."</p>

<p>He paused, without apparent exasperation, then continued evenly&mdash;</p>

<p>". . . With the boilers worn out and the survey hanging over
my head, Captain Whalley &mdash;Captain Whalley, I say, what do
you do with your money? You must have stacks of money somewhere&mdash;a
man like you must. It stands to reason. I am not a fool, you know,
Captain Whalley&mdash;partner."</p>

<p>Again he paused, as though he had done for good. He passed his
tongue over his lips, gave a backward glance at the Serang conning
the ship with quiet whispers and slight signs of the hand. The
wash of the propeller sent a swift ripple, crested with dark froth,
upon a long flat spit of black slime. The Sofala had entered the
river; the trail she had stirred up over the bar was a mile astern
of her now, out of sight, had disappeared utterly; and the smooth,
empty sea along the coast was left behind in the glittering desolation
of sunshine. On each side of her, low down, the growth of somber
twisted mangroves covered the semi-liquid banks; and Massy continued
in his old tone, with an abrupt start, as if his speech had been
ground out of him, like the tune of a music-box, by turning a
handle.</p>

<p>"Though if anybody ever got the best of me, it is you. I don’t
mind saying this. I’ve said it&mdash;there! What more can you want?
Isn’t that enough for your pride, Captain Whalley. You got over
me from the first. It’s all of a piece, when I look back at it.
You allowed me to insert that clause about intemperance without
saying anything, only looking very sick when I made a point of
it going in black on white. How could I tell what was wrong about
you. There’s generally something wrong somewhere. And, lo and
behold! when you come on board it turns out that you’ve been in
the habit of drinking nothing but water for years and years."</p>

<p>His dogmatic reproachful whine stopped. He brooded profoundly,
after the manner of crafty and unintelligent men. It seemed inconceivable
that Captain Whalley should not laugh at the expression of disgust
that overspread the heavy, yellow countenance. But Captain Whalley
never raised his eyes&mdash;sitting in his arm-chair, outraged, dignified,
and motionless.</p>

<p>"Much good it was to me," Massy remonstrated monotonously, "to
insert a clause for dismissal for intemperance against a man who
drinks nothing but water. And you looked so upset, too, when I
read my draft in the lawyer’s office that morning, Captain Whalley,&mdash;you
looked so crestfallen, that I made sure I had gone home on your
weak spot. A shipowner can’t be too careful as to the sort of
skipper he gets. You must have been laughing at me in your sleeve
all the blessed time. . . . Eh? What are you going to say?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley had only shuffled his feet slightly. A dull animosity
became apparent in Massy’s sideways stare.</p>

<p>"But recollect that there are other grounds of dismissal. There’s
habitual carelessness, amounting to incompetence&mdash;there’s gross
and persistent neglect of duty. I am not quite as big a fool as
you try to make me out to be. You have been careless of late&mdash;leaving
everything to that Serang. Why! I’ve seen you letting that old
fool of a Malay take bearings for you, as if you were too big
to attend to your work yourself. And what do you call that silly
touch-and-go manner in which you took the ship over the bar just
now? You expect me to put up with that?"</p>

<p>Leaning on his elbow against the ladder abaft the bridge, Sterne,
the mate, tried to hear, blinking the while from the distance
at the second engineer, who had come up for a moment, and stood
in the engine-room companion. Wiping his hands on a bunch of cotton
waste, he looked about with indifference to the right and left
at the river banks slipping astern of the Sofala steadily.</p>

<p>Massy turned full at the chair. The character of his whine became
again threatening.</p>

<p>"Take care. I may yet dismiss you and freeze to your money for
a year. I may . . ."</p>

<p>But before the silent, rigid immobility of the man whose money
had come in the nick of time to save him from utter ruin, his
voice died out in his throat.</p>

<p>"Not that I want you to go," he resumed after a silence, and
in an absurdly insinuating tone. "I want nothing better than to
be friends and renew the agreement, if you will consent to find
another couple of hundred to help with the new boilers, Captain
Whalley. I’ve told you before. She must have new boilers; you
know it as well as I do. Have you thought this over?"</p>

<p>He waited. The slender stem of the pipe with its bulky lump of
a bowl at the end hung down from his thick lips. It had gone out.
Suddenly he took it from between his teeth and wrung his hands
slightly.</p>

<p>"Don’t you believe me?" He thrust the pipe bowl into the pocket
of his shiny black jacket.</p>

<p>"It’s like dealing with the devil," he said. "Why don’t you speak?
At first you were so high and mighty with me I hardly dared to
creep about my own deck. Now I can’t get a word from you. You
don’t seem to see me at all. What does it mean? Upon my soul,
you terrify me with this deaf and dumb trick. What’s going on
in that head of yours? What are you plotting against me there
so hard that you can’t say a word? You will never make me believe
that you&mdash;you&mdash;don’t know where to lay your hands on a couple
of hundred. You have made me curse the day I was born. . . ."</p>

<p>"Mr. Massy," said Captain Whalley suddenly, without stirring.</p>

<p>The engineer started violently.</p>

<p>"If that is so I can only beg you to forgive me."</p>

<p>"Starboard," muttered the Serang to the helmsman; and the Sofala
began to swing round the bend into the second reach.</p>

<p>"Ough!" Massy shuddered. "You make my blood run cold. What made
you come here? What made you come aboard that evening all of a
sudden, with your high talk and your money&mdash;tempting me? I always
wondered what was your motive? You fastened yourself on me to
have easy times and grow fat on my life blood, I tell you. Was
that it? I believe you are the greatest miser in the world, or
else why . . ."</p>

<p>"No. I am only poor," interrupted Captain Whalley, stonily.</p>

<p>"Steady," murmured the Serang. Massy turned away with his chin
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it," he said in his dogmatic tone. Captain Whalley
made no movement. "There you sit like a gorged vulture&mdash;exactly
like a vulture."</p>

<p>He embraced the middle of the reach and both the banks in one
blank unseeing circular glance, and left the bridge slowly.</p>
