<p>Carfax, on duty, sat hunched up over the telephone, reporting
to the fortress.</p>

<p>Gray came in, closed the wooden shutters, hung blankets over
them, lighted an oil stove and then a candle. Flint took up the
cards, looked at Gary, then flung them aside, muttering.</p>

<p>Nobody attempted to read; nobody touched the cards again. An
orderly came in with soup. The meal was brief and perfectly silent.</p>

<p>Flint said casually, after the table had been cleared: "I haven’t
slept for a month. If I don’t get some sleep I’ll go queer. I
warn you; that’s all. I’m sorry to say it, but it’s so."</p>

<p>"They’re dirty beasts to keep us here like this," muttered Gary&mdash;"nine
months of it, and not a shot."</p>

<p>"There’ll be a few shots if things don’t change," remarked Flint
in a colourless voice. "I’m getting wrong in my head. I can feel
it."</p>

<p>Carfax turned from the switchboard with a forced laugh: "Thinking
of shooting up the camp?"</p>

<p>"That or myself," replied Flint in a quiet voice; "ever since
that cuckoo called I’ve felt queer."</p>

<p>Gary, brooding in his soiled tunic collar, began to mutter presently:
"I once knew a man in a lighthouse down in Florida who couldn’t
stand it after a bit and jumped off."</p>

<p>"Oh, we’ve heard that twenty times," interrupted Carfax wearily.</p>

<p>Gray said: "<em>What</em> a jump! &mdash;I mean down into Alsace
below&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You’re all going dotty!" snapped Carfax. "Shut up or you’ll
be doing it&mdash;some of you."</p>

<p>"I can’t sleep. That’s where I’m getting queer," insisted Flint.
"If I could get a few hours’ sleep now&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I wish to God the Boches could reach you with a big gun. That
would put you to sleep, all right!" said Gray.</p>

<p>"This war is likely to end before any of us see a Fritz," said
Carfax. "I could stand it, too, except being up here with such"&mdash;his
voice dwindled to a mutter, but it sounded to Gary as though he
had used the word "rotters."</p>

<p>Flint’s face had a white, strained expression; he began to walk
about, saying aloud to himself: "If I could only sleep. That’s
the idea&mdash;sleep it off, and wake up somewhere else. It’s the silence,
or the voices &mdash;I don’t know which. You dollar-crazy Yankees
and ignorant Provincials don’t realize what a cuckoo is. You’ve
no traditions, anyway&mdash;no past, nothing to care for&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Listen to ’Arry!" retorted Gary&mdash;"’Arry and his cuckoo!"</p>

<p>Carfax stirred heavily. "Shut up!" he said, with an effort. "The
thing is to keep doing something&mdash;something&mdash;anything&mdash;except
quarrelling."</p>

<p>He picked up a tennis ball. "Come on, you funking brutes! I’ll
teach you how to play cuckoo. Every man takes three tennis balls
and stands in a corner of the room. I stand in the middle. Then
you blow out the candle. Then I call ’cuckoo!’ in the dark and
you try to hit me, aiming by the sound of my voice. Every time
I’m hit I pay ten shillings to the pool, take my place in a corner,
and have a shot at the next man, chosen by lot. And if you throw
three balls apiece and nobody hits me, then you each pay ten shillings
to me and I’m cuckoo for another round."</p>

<p>"We aim at random?" inquired Gray, mildly interested.</p>

<p>"Certainly. It must be played in pitch darkness. When I call
out cuckoo, you take a shot at where you think I am. If you all
miss, you all pay. If I’m hit, I pay."</p>

<p>Gary chose three tennis balls and retired to a corner of the
room; Gray and Flint, urged into action, took three each, unwillingly.</p>

<p>"Blow out the candle," said Carfax, who had walked into the middle
of the room. Gary blew it out and the place was in darkness.</p>

<p>They thought they heard Carfax moving cautiously, and presently
he called, "Cuckoo!" A storm of tennis balls rebounded from the
walls; "Cuckoo!" shouted Carfax, and the tennis balls rained all
around him.</p>

<p>Once more he called; not a ball hit him; and he struck a match
where he was seated upon the floor.</p>

<p>There was some perfunctory laughter of a feverish sort; the candle
was relighted, tennis balls redistributed, and Carfax wrote down
his winnings.</p>

<p>The next time, however, Gray, throwing low, caught him. Again
the candle was lighted, scores jotted down, a coin tossed, and
Flint went in as cuckoo.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible to miss a man so near, even in total
darkness, but Flint lasted three rounds and was hit, finally,
a stinging smack on the ear. And then Gary went in.</p>

<p>It was hot work, but they kept at it feverishly, grimly, as though
their very sanity depended upon the violence of their diversion.
They threw the balls hard, viciously hard. A sort of silent ferocity
seemed to seize them. A chance hit cut the skin over Flint’s cheekbone,
and when the candle was lighted, one side of his face was bright
with blood.</p>

<p>Early in the proceedings somebody had disinterred brandy and
Schnapps from under a bunk. The room had become close; they all
were sweating.</p>

<p>Carfax emptied his iced glass, still breathing hard, tossed a
shilling and sent in Gary as cuckoo.</p>

<p>Flint, who never could stand spirits, started unsteadily for
the candle, but could not seem to blow it out. He stood swaying
and balancing on his heels, puffing out his smooth, boyish cheeks
and blowing at hazard.</p>

<p>"You’re drunk," said Gray, thickly; but he was as flushed as
the boy he addressed, only steadier of leg.</p>

<p>"What’s that?" retorted Flint, jerking his shoulders around and
gazing at Gray out of glassy eyes.</p>

<p>"Blow out that candle," said Gary heavily, "or I’ll shoot it
out! Do you get that?"</p>

<p>"Shoot!" repeated Flint, staring vaguely into Gary’s bloodshot
eyes; "<em>you</em> shoot, you old slacker&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Shut up and play the game!" cut in Carfax, a menacing roar rising
in his voice. "You’re all slackers&mdash;and rotters, too. Play the
game! Keep playing&mdash;hard!&mdash;or you’ll go clean off your fool nuts!"</p>

<p>Gary walked heavily over and knocked the tennis balls out of
Flint’s hands.</p>

<p>"There’s a better game than that," he said, his articulation
very thick; "but it takes nerve&mdash;if you’ve got it, you spindle-legged
little cockney!"</p>

<p>Flint struck at him aimlessly. "I’ve got nerve," he muttered,
"plenty of nerve, old top! What d’you want? I’m your man; I’ll
go you&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Go on with the game, I tell you!" bawled Carfax.</p>

<p>Gary swung around: "Wait till I explain&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, don’t wait! Keep going! Keep playing! Keep doing something,
for God’s sake!"</p>

<p>"Will you wait!" shouted Gary. "I want to tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>Carfax made a hopeless gesture: "It’s talk that will do the trick
for us all&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I want to tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>Carfax shrugged, emptied his full glass with a gesture of finality.</p>

<p>"Then talk, damn you! And we’ll all be at each other’s throats
before morning."</p>

<p>Gary got Gray by the elbow: "Reggie, it’s this way. We flip up
for cuckoo. Whoever gets stuck takes a shot apiece from our automatics
in the legs&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"It’s perfectly agreeable to me," assented Gray, in the mincing,
elaborate voice characteristic of him when drunk.</p>

<p>Flint wagged his head. "It’s a sportin’ game. I’m in," he said.</p>

<p>Gary looked at Carfax. "A shot in the dark at a man’s legs. And
if he gets his&mdash;it will be Blighty in exchange for hell."</p>

<p>Carfax, sullen with liquor, shoved his big hand into his pocket,
produced a shilling, and tossed it.</p>

<p>A brighter flush stained the faces which ringed him; the risky
hazard of the affair cleared their sick minds to comprehension.</p>

<p>Tails turned uppermost; Flint and Gary were eliminated. It lay
between Carfax and Gray, and the older man won.</p>

<p>"Mind you fire low," said the young fellow, with an excited laugh,
and walked into the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Gary blew out the candle. Presently from somewhere in the intense
darkness Gray called "Cuckoo!" and instantly a slanting red flash
lashed out through the gloom. And, when the deafening echo had
nearly ceased: "Cuckoo!"</p>

<p>Another pistol crashed. And after a swimming interval they heard
him moving. "Cuckoo!" he called; a level flame stabbed the dark;
something fell, thudding through the staccato uproar of the explosion.
At the same moment the outer door opened on the crack and Carfax’s
orderly peeped in.</p>

<p>Carfax struck a match with shaky fingers; the candle guttered,
sank, flared on Flint, who was laughing without a sound. "Got
the beggar, by God!" he whispered&mdash;"through the head! Look at
him. Look at Reggie Gray! Tried for his head and got him&#11834;"</p>

<p>He reeled back, chuckling foolishly, and levelled at Carfax.
"Now I’ll get you!" he simpered, and shot him through the face.</p>

<p>As Carfax pitched forward, Gary fired.</p>

<p>"Missed me, by God!" laughed Flint. "Shoot? Hell, yes. I’ll show
you how to shoot&#11834;"</p>

<p>He struck the lighted candle with his left hand and laughed again
in the thick darkness.</p>

<p>"Shoot? I’ll show you how to shoot, you old slacker&#11834;"</p>

<p>Gary fired.</p>

<p>After a silence Flint giggled in the choking darkness as the
door opened cautiously again, and shot at the terrified orderly.</p>

<p>"I’m a cockney, am I? And you don’t think much of the Devon cuckoos,
do you? Now I’ll show you that I understand all kinds of cuckoos&#11834;"</p>

<p>Both flashes split the obscurity at the same moment. Flint fell
back against the wall and slid down to the floor. The outer door
began to open again cautiously.</p>

<p>But the orderly, half dressed, remained knee-deep in the snow
by the doorway.</p>

<p>After a long interval Gary struck a match, then went over and
lit the candle. And, as he turned, Flint fired from where he lay
on the floor and Gary swung heavily on one heel, took two uncertain
steps. Then his pistol fell clattering; he sank to his knees and
collapsed face downward on the stones.</p>

<p>Flint, still lying where he had fallen, partly upright, against
the wall, began to laugh, and died a few moments later, the wind
from the slowly opening door stirring his fair hair and extinguishing
the candle.</p>

<p>And at last, through the opened door crept Carfax’s orderly;
peered into the darkness within, shivering in his unbuttoned tunic,
his boots wet with snow.</p>

<p>Dawn already whitened the east; and up out of the ghastly fog
edging the German Empire, silhouetted, monstrous, against the
daybreak, soared a <em>Lämmergeyer</em>, beating the livid void
with enormous, unclean wings.</p>

<p>The orderly heard its scream, shrank, cowering, against the door
frame as the huge bird’s ferocious red and yellow eyes blazed
level with his.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the clamor of the <em>Lämmergeyer</em>, the shrill
bell of the telephone began to ring.</p>

<p>The terrible racket of the <em>Lämmergeyer</em> filled the sky;
the orderly stumbled into the room, slipped in a puddle of something
wet, sent an empty bottle rolling and clinking away into the darkness;
stumbled twice over prostrate bodies; reached the telephone, half
fainting; whispered for help.</p>

<p>After a long, long while, the horror still thickly clogging vein
and brain, he scratched a match, hesitated, then holding it high,
reeled toward the door with face averted.</p>

<p>Outside the sun was already above the horizon, flashing over
Haut Alsace at his feet.</p>

<p>The <em>Lämmergeyer</em> was a speck in the sky, poised over
France.</p>

<p>Up out of the infinite and sunlit chasm came a mocking, joyous
hail&mdash;up through the sheer, misty gulf out of vernal depths: <em>Cuck</em>-oo!
<em>Cuck</em>-oo! <em>Cuck</em>-oo!</p>
