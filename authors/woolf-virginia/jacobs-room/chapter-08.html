<p>About half-past nine Jacob left the house, his door slamming,
other doors slamming, buying his paper, mounting his omnibus,
or, weather permitting, walking his road as other people do. Head
bent down, a desk, a telephone, books bound in green leather,
electric light.... "Fresh coals, sir?" ... "Your tea, sir."...
Talk about football, the Hotspurs, the Harlequins; six-thirty
Star brought in by the office boy; the rooks of Gray's Inn passing
overhead; branches in the fog thin and brittle; and through the
roar of traffic now and again a voice shouting: "Verdict&mdash;verdict&mdash;winner&mdash;winner,"
while letters accumulate in a basket, Jacob signs them, and each
evening finds him, as he takes his coat down, with some muscle
of the brain new stretched.</p>

<p>Then, sometimes a game of chess; or pictures in Bond Street,
or a long way home to take the air with Bonamy on his arm, meditatively
marching, head thrown back, the world a spectacle, the early moon
above the steeples coming in for praise, the sea-gulls flying
high, Nelson on his column surveying the horizon, and the world
our ship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, poor Betty Flanders's letter, having caught the second
post, lay on the hall table&mdash;poor Betty Flanders writing her son's
name, Jacob Alan Flanders, Esq., as mothers do, and the ink pale,
profuse, suggesting how mothers down at Scarborough scribble over
the fire with their feet on the fender, when tea's cleared away,
and can never, never say, whatever it may be&mdash;probably this &mdash;Don't
go with bad women, do be a good boy; wear your thick shirts; and
come back, come back, come back to me.</p>

<p>But she said nothing of the kind. "Do you remember old Miss Wargrave,
who used to be so kind when you had the whooping-cough?" she wrote;
"she's dead at last, poor thing. They would like it if you wrote.
Ellen came over and we spent a nice day shopping. Old Mouse gets
very stiff, and we have to walk him up the smallest hill. Rebecca,
at last, after I don't know how long, went into Mr. Adamson's.
Three teeth, he says, must come out. Such mild weather for the
time of year, the little buds actually on the pear trees. And
Mrs. Jarvis tells me&mdash;"Mrs. Flanders liked Mrs. Jarvis, always
said of her that she was too good for such a quiet place, and,
though she never listened to her discontent and told her at the
end of it (looking up, sucking her thread, or taking off her spectacles)
that a little peat wrapped round the iris roots keeps them from
the frost, and Parrot's great white sale is Tuesday next, "do
remember," &mdash;Mrs. Flanders knew precisely how Mrs. Jarvis
felt; and how interesting her letters were, about Mrs. Jarvis,
could one read them year in, year out&mdash;the unpublished works of
women, written by the fireside in pale profusion, dried by the
flame, for the blotting-paper's worn to holes and the nib cleft
and clotted. Then Captain Barfoot. Him she called "the Captain,"
spoke of frankly, yet never without reserve. The Captain was enquiring
for her about Garfit's acre; advised chickens; could promise profit;
or had the sciatica; or Mrs. Barfoot had been indoors for weeks;
or the Captain says things look bad, politics that is, for as
Jacob knew, the Captain would sometimes talk, as the evening waned,
about Ireland or India; and then Mrs. Flanders would fall musing
about Morty, her brother, lost all these years&mdash;had the natives
got him, was his ship sunk&mdash;would the Admiralty tell her?&mdash;the
Captain knocking his pipe out, as Jacob knew, rising to go, stiffly
stretching to pick up Mrs. Flanders's wool which had rolled beneath
the chair. Talk of the chicken farm came back and back, the women,
even at fifty, impulsive at heart, sketching on the cloudy future
flocks of Leghorns, Cochin Chinas, Orpingtons; like Jacob in the
blur of her outline; but powerful as he was; fresh and vigorous,
running about the house, scolding Rebecca.</p>

<p>The letter lay upon the hall table; Florinda coming in that night
took it up with her, put it on the table as she kissed Jacob,
and Jacob seeing the hand, left it there under the lamp, between
the biscuit-tin and the tobacco-box. They shut the bedroom door
behind them.</p>

<p>The sitting-room neither knew nor cared. The door was shut; and
to suppose that wood, when it creaks, transmits anything save
that rats are busy and wood dry is childish. These old houses
are only brick and wood, soaked in human sweat, grained with human
dirt. But if the pale blue envelope lying by the biscuit-box had
the feelings of a mother, the heart was torn by the little creak,
the sudden stir. Behind the door was the obscene thing, the alarming
presence, and terror would come over her as at death, or the birth
of a child. Better, perhaps, burst in and face it than sit in
the antechamber listening to the little creak, the sudden stir,
for her heart was swollen, and pain threaded it. My son, my son&mdash;such
would be her cry, uttered to hide her vision of him stretched
with Florinda, inexcusable, irrational, in a woman with three
children living at Scarborough. And the fault lay with Florinda.
Indeed, when the door opened and the couple came out, Mrs. Flanders
would have flounced upon her&mdash;only it was Jacob who came first,
in his dressing-gown, amiable, authoritative, beautifully healthy,
like a baby after an airing, with an eye clear as running water.
Florinda followed, lazily stretching; yawning a little; arranging
her hair at the looking-glass&mdash;while Jacob read his mother's letter.</p>

<p>Let us consider letters&mdash;how they come at breakfast, and at night,
with their yellow stamps and their green stamps, immortalized
by the postmark&mdash;for to see one's own envelope on another's table
is to realize how soon deeds sever and become alien. Then at last
the power of the mind to quit the body is manifest, and perhaps
we fear or hate or wish annihilated this phantom of ourselves,
lying on the table. Still, there are letters that merely say how
dinner's at seven; others ordering coal; making appointments.
The hand in them is scarcely perceptible, let alone the voice
or the scowl. Ah, but when the post knocks and the letter comes
always the miracle seems repeated&mdash;speech attempted. Venerable
are letters, infinitely brave, forlorn, and lost.</p>

<p>Life would split asunder without them. "Come to tea, come to
dinner, what's the truth of the story? have you heard the news?
life in the capital is gay; the Russian dancers...." These are
our stays and props. These lace our days together and make of
life a perfect globe. And yet, and yet ... when we go to dinner,
when pressing finger-tips we hope to meet somewhere soon, a doubt
insinuates itself; is this the way to spend our days? the rare,
the limited, so soon dealt out to us&mdash;drinking tea? dining out?
And the notes accumulate. And the telephones ring. And everywhere
we go wires and tubes surround us to carry the voices that try
to penetrate before the last card is dealt and the days are over.
"Try to penetrate," for as we lift the cup, shake the hand, express
the hope, something whispers, Is this all? Can I never know, share,
be certain? Am I doomed all my days to write letters, send voices,
which fall upon the tea-table, fade upon the passage, making appointments,
while life dwindles, to come and dine? Yet letters are venerable;
and the telephone valiant, for the journey is a lonely one, and
if bound together by notes and telephones we went in company,
perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;we might talk by the way.</p>

<p>Well, people have tried. Byron wrote letters. So did Cowper.
For centuries the writing-desk has contained sheets fit precisely
for the communications of friends. Masters of language, poets
of long ages, have turned from the sheet that endures to the sheet
that perishes, pushing aside the tea-tray, drawing close to the
fire (for letters are written when the dark presses round a bright
red cave), and addressed themselves to the task of reaching, touching,
penetrating the individual heart. Were it possible! But words
have been used too often; touched and turned, and left exposed
to the dust of the street. The words we seek hang close to the
tree. We come at dawn and find them sweet beneath the leaf.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flanders wrote letters; Mrs. Jarvis wrote them; Mrs. Durrant
too; Mother Stuart actually scented her pages, thereby adding
a flavour which the English language fails to provide; Jacob had
written in his day long letters about art, morality, and politics
to young men at college. Clara Durrant's letters were those of
a child. Florinda&mdash;the impediment between Florinda and her pen
was something impassable. Fancy a butterfly, gnat, or other winged
insect, attached to a twig which, clogged with mud, it rolls across
a page. Her spelling was abominable. Her sentiments infantile.
And for some reason when she wrote she declared her belief in
God. Then there were crosses&mdash;tear stains; and the hand itself
rambling and redeemed only by the fact&mdash;which always did redeem
Florinda&mdash;by the fact that she cared. Yes, whether it was for
chocolate creams, hot baths, the shape of her face in the looking-glass,
Florinda could no more pretend a feeling than swallow whisky.
Incontinent was her rejection. Great men are truthful, and these
little prostitutes, staring in the fire, taking out a powder-puff,
decorating lips at an inch of looking-glass, have (so Jacob thought)
an inviolable fidelity.</p>

<p>Then he saw her turning up Greek Street upon another man's arm.</p>

<p>The light from the arc lamp drenched him from head to toe. He
stood for a minute motionless beneath it. Shadows chequered the
street. Other figures, single and together, poured out, wavered
across, and obliterated Florinda and the man.</p>

<p>The light drenched Jacob from head to toe. You could see the
pattern on his trousers; the old thorns on his stick; his shoe
laces; bare hands; and face.</p>

<p>It was as if a stone were ground to dust; as if white sparks
flew from a livid whetstone, which was his spine; as if the switchback
railway, having swooped to the depths, fell, fell, fell. This
was in his face.</p>

<p>Whether we know what was in his mind is another question. Granted
ten years' seniority and a difference of sex, fear of him comes
first; this is swallowed up by a desire to help&mdash;overwhelming
sense, reason, and the time of night; anger would follow close
on that&mdash;with Florinda, with destiny; and then up would bubble
an irresponsible optimism. "Surely there's enough light in the
street at this moment to drown all our cares in gold!" Ah, what's
the use of saying it? Even while you speak and look over your
shoulder towards Shaftesbury Avenue, destiny is chipping a dent
in him. He has turned to go. As for following him back to his
rooms, no&mdash;that we won't do.</p>

<p>Yet that, of course, is precisely what one does. He let himself
in and shut the door, though it was only striking ten on one of
the city clocks. No one can go to bed at ten. Nobody was thinking
of going to bed. It was January and dismal, but Mrs. Wagg stood
on her doorstep, as if expecting something to happen. A barrel-organ
played like an obscene nightingale beneath wet leaves. Children
ran across the road. Here and there one could see brown panelling
inside the hall door.... The march that the mind keeps beneath
the windows of others is queer enough. Now distracted by brown
panelling; now by a fern in a pot; here improvising a few phrases
to dance with the barrel-organ; again snatching a detached gaiety
from a drunken man; then altogether absorbed by words the poor
shout across the street at each other (so outright, so lusty)&mdash;yet
all the while having for centre, for magnet, a young man alone
in his room.</p>

<p>"Life is wicked&mdash;life is detestable," cried Rose Shaw.</p>

<p>The strange thing about life is that though the nature of it
must have been apparent to every one for hundreds of years, no
one has left any adequate account of it. The streets of London
have their map; but our passions are uncharted. What are you going
to meet if you turn this corner?</p>

<p>"Holborn straight ahead of you," says the policeman. Ah, but
where are you going if instead of brushing past the old man with
the white beard, the silver medal, and the cheap violin, you let
him go on with his story, which ends in an invitation to step
somewhere, to his room, presumably, off Queen's Square, and there
he shows you a collection of birds' eggs and a letter from the
Prince of Wales's secretary, and this (skipping the intermediate
stages) brings you one winter's day to the Essex coast, where
the little boat makes off to the ship, and the ship sails and
you behold on the skyline the Azores; and the flamingoes rise;
and there you sit on the verge of the marsh drinking rum-punch,
an outcast from civilization, for you have committed a crime,
are infected with yellow fever as likely as not, and&mdash;fill in
the sketch as you like. As frequent as street corners in Holborn
are these chasms in the continuity of our ways. Yet we keep straight
on.</p>

<p>Rose Shaw, talking in rather an emotional manner to Mr. Bowley
at Mrs. Durrant's evening party a few nights back, said that life
was wicked because a man called Jimmy refused to marry a woman
called (if memory serves) Helen Aitken.</p>

<p>Both were beautiful. Both were inanimate. The oval tea-table
invariably separated them, and the plate of biscuits was all he
ever gave her. He bowed; she inclined her head. They danced. He
danced divinely. They sat in the alcove; never a word was said.
Her pillow was wet with tears. Kind Mr. Bowley and dear Rose Shaw
marvelled and deplored. Bowley had rooms in the Albany. Rose was
re-born every evening precisely as the clock struck eight. All
four were civilization's triumphs, and if you persist that a command
of the English language is part of our inheritance, one can only
reply that beauty is almost always dumb. Male beauty in association
with female beauty breeds in the onlooker a sense of fear. Often
have I seen them &mdash;Helen and Jimmy&mdash;and likened them to ships
adrift, and feared for my own little craft. Or again, have you
ever watched fine collie dogs couchant at twenty yards' distance?
As she passed him his cup there was that quiver in her flanks.
Bowley saw what was up-asked Jimmy to breakfast. Helen must have
confided in Rose. For my own part, I find it exceedingly difficult
to interpret songs without words. And now Jimmy feeds crows in
Flanders and Helen visits hospitals. Oh, life is damnable, life
is wicked, as Rose Shaw said.</p>

<p>The lamps of London uphold the dark as upon the points of burning
bayonets. The yellow canopy sinks and swells over the great four-poster.
Passengers in the mail-coaches running into London in the eighteenth
century looked through leafless branches and saw it flaring beneath
them. The light burns behind yellow blinds and pink blinds, and
above fanlights, and down in basement windows. The street market
in Soho is fierce with light. Raw meat, china mugs, and silk stockings
blaze in it. Raw voices wrap themselves round the flaring gas-jets.
Arms akimbo, they stand on the pavement bawling &mdash;Messrs.
Kettle and Wilkinson; their wives sit in the shop, furs wrapped
round their necks, arms folded, eyes contemptuous. Such faces
as one sees. The little man fingering the meat must have squatted
before the fire in innumerable lodging-houses, and heard and seen
and known so much that it seems to utter itself even volubly from
dark eyes, loose lips, as he fingers the meat silently, his face
sad as a poet's, and never a song sung. Shawled women carry babies
with purple eyelids; boys stand at street corners; girls look
across the road&mdash;rude illustrations, pictures in a book whose
pages we turn over and over as if we should at last find what
we look for. Every face, every shop, bedroom window, public-house,
and dark square is a picture feverishly turned&mdash;in search of what?
It is the same with books. What do we seek through millions of
pages? Still hopefully turning the pages&mdash;oh, here is Jacob's
room.</p>

<p>He sat at the table reading the Globe. The pinkish sheet was
spread flat before him. He propped his face in his hand, so that
the skin of his cheek was wrinkled in deep folds. Terribly severe
he looked, set, and defiant. (What people go through in half an
hour! But nothing could save him. These events are features of
our landscape. A foreigner coming to London could scarcely miss
seeing St. Paul's.) He judged life. These pinkish and greenish
newspapers are thin sheets of gelatine pressed nightly over the
brain and heart of the world. They take the impression of the
whole. Jacob cast his eye over it. A strike, a murder, football,
bodies found; vociferation from all parts of England simultaneously.
How miserable it is that the Globe newspaper offers nothing better
to Jacob Flanders! When a child begins to read history one marvels,
sorrowfully, to hear him spell out in his new voice the ancient
words.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's speech was reported in something over five
columns. Feeling in his pocket, Jacob took out a pipe and proceeded
to fill it. Five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes passed.
Jacob took the paper over to the fire. The Prime Minister proposed
a measure for giving Home Rule to Ireland. Jacob knocked out his
pipe. He was certainly thinking about Home Rule in Ireland&mdash;a
very difficult matter. A very cold night.</p>

<p>The snow, which had been falling all night, lay at three o'clock
in the afternoon over the fields and the hill. Clumps of withered
grass stood out upon the hill-top; the furze bushes were black,
and now and then a black shiver crossed the snow as the wind drove
flurries of frozen particles before it. The sound was that of
a broom sweeping&mdash;sweeping.</p>

<p>The stream crept along by the road unseen by any one. Sticks
and leaves caught in the frozen grass. The sky was sullen grey
and the trees of black iron. Uncompromising was the severity of
the country. At four o'clock the snow was again falling. The day
had gone out.</p>

<p>A window tinged yellow about two feet across alone combated the
white fields and the black trees .... At six o'clock a man's figure
carrying a lantern crossed the field .... A raft of twig stayed
upon a stone, suddenly detached itself, and floated towards the
culvert .... A load of snow slipped and fell from a fir branch
.... Later there was a mournful cry .... A motor car came along
the road shoving the dark before it .... The dark shut down behind
it....</p>

<p>Spaces of complete immobility separated each of these movements.
The land seemed to lie dead .... Then the old shepherd returned
stiffly across the field. Stiffly and painfully the frozen earth
was trodden under and gave beneath pressure like a treadmill.
The worn voices of clocks repeated the fact of the hour all night
long.</p>

<p>Jacob, too, heard them, and raked out the fire. He rose. He stretched
himself. He went to bed.</p>
