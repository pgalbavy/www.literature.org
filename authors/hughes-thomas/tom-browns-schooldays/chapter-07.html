<blockquote>&quot;Says Giles, ''Tis mortal hard to go,<br>
But if so be's I must<br>
I means to follow arter he<br>
As goes hisself the fust.'&quot; - Ballad.</blockquote>
<P>Everybody, I suppose, knows the dreamy, delicious state in which
one lies, half asleep, half awake, while consciousness begins to
return after a sound night's rest in a new place which we are
glad to be in, following upon a day of unwonted excitement and
exertion.  There are few pleasanter pieces of life.  The worst
of it is that they last such a short time; for nurse them as you
will, by lying perfectly passive in mind and body, you can't
make more than five minutes or so of them.  After which time the
stupid, obtrusive, wakeful entity which we call &quot;I&quot;, as
impatient as he is stiff-necked, spite of our teeth will force
himself back again, and take possession of us down to our very
toes.</P>
<P>It was in this state that Master Tom lay at half-past seven on
the morning following the day of his arrival, and from his clean
little white bed watched the movements of Bogle (the generic
name by which the successive shoeblacks of the School-house were
known), as he marched round from bed to bed, collecting the
dirty shoes and boots, and depositing clean ones in their
places.</P>
<P>There he lay, half doubtful as to where exactly in the universe
he was, but conscious that he had made a step in life which he
had been anxious to make.  It was only just light as he looked
lazily out of the wide windows, and saw the tops of the great
elms, and the rooks circling about and cawing remonstrances to
the lazy ones of their commonwealth before starting in a body
for the neighbouring ploughed fields.  The noise of the room-
door closing behind Bogle, as he made his exit with the
shoebasket under his arm, roused him thoroughly, and he sat up
in bed and looked round the room.  What in the world could be
the matter with his shoulders and loins?  He felt as if he had
been severely beaten all down his back - the natural results of
his performance at his first match.  He drew up his knees and
rested his chin on them, and went over all the events of
yesterday, rejoicing in his new life, what he had seen of it,
and all that was to come.</P>
<P>Presently one or two of the other boys roused themselves, and
began to sit up and talk to one another in low tones.  Then
East, after a roll or two, came to an anchor also, and nodding
to Tom, began examining his ankle.</P>
<P>&quot;What a pull,&quot; said he, &quot;that it's lie-in-bed, for I shall be as
lame as a tree, I think.&quot;</P>
<P>It was Sunday morning, and Sunday lectures had not yet been
established; so that nothing but breakfast intervened between
bed and eleven o'clock chapel - a gap by no means easy to fill
up:  in fact, though received with the correct amount of
grumbling, the first lecture instituted by the Doctor shortly
afterwards was a great boon to the School.  It was lie-in-bed,
and no one was in a hurry to get up, especially in rooms where
the sixth-form boy was a good-tempered fellow, as was the case
in Tom's room, and allowed the small boys to talk and laugh and
do pretty much what they pleased, so long as they didn't disturb
him.  His bed was a bigger one than the rest, standing in the
corner by the fireplace, with a washing-stand and large basin by
the side, where he lay in state with his white curtains tucked
in so as to form a retiring place - an awful subject of
contemplation to Tom, who slept nearly opposite, and watched the
great man rouse himself and take a book from under his pillow,
and begin reading, leaning his head on his hand, and turning his
back to the room.  Soon, however, a noise of striving urchins
arose, and muttered encouragements from the neighbouring boys of
&quot;Go it, Tadpole!&quot;  &quot;Now, young Green!&quot;  &quot;Haul away his blanket!&quot;
&quot;Slipper him on the hands!&quot;  Young Green and little Hall,
commonly called Tadpole, from his great black head and thin
legs, slept side by side far away by the door, and were for ever
playing one another tricks, which usually ended, as on this
morning, in open and violent collision; and now, unmindful of
all order and authority, there they were, each hauling away at
the other's bedclothes with one hand, and with the other, armed
with a slipper, belabouring whatever portion of the body of his
adversary came within reach.</P>
<P>&quot;Hold that noise up in the corner,&quot; called out the prepostor,
sitting up and looking round his curtains; and the Tadpole and
young Green sank down into their disordered beds; and then,
looking at his watch, added, &quot;Hullo! past eight.  Whose turn for
hot water?&quot;</P>
<P>(Where the prepostor was particular in his ablutions, the fags
in his room had to descend in turn to the kitchen, and beg or
steal hot water for him; and often the custom extended farther,
and two boys went down every morning to get a supply for the
whole room.)</P>
<P>&quot;East's and Tadpole's,&quot; answered the senior fag, who kept the
rota.</P>
<P>&quot;I can't go,&quot; said East; &quot;I'm dead lame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, be quick some of you, that's all,&quot; said the great man, as
he turned out of bed, and putting on his slippers, went out into
the great passage, which runs the whole length of the bedrooms,
to get his Sunday habiliments out of his portmanteau.</P>
<P>&quot;Let me go for you,&quot; said Tom to East; &quot;I should like it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, thank 'ee, that's a good fellow.  Just pull on your
trousers, and take your jug and mine.  Tadpole will show you the
way.&quot;</P>
<P>And so Tom and the Tadpole, in nightshirts and trousers, started
off downstairs, and through &quot;Thos's hole,&quot; as the little
buttery, where candles and beer and bread and cheese were served
out at night, was called, across the School-house court, down a
long passage, and into the kitchen; where, after some parley
with the stalwart, handsome cook, who declared that she had
filled a dozen jugs already, they got their hot water, and
returned with all speed and great caution.  As it was, they
narrowly escaped capture by some privateers from the fifth-form
rooms, who were on the lookout for the hot-water convoys, and
pursued them up to the very door of their room, making them
spill half their load in the passage.</P>
<P>&quot;Better than going down again though,&quot; as Tadpole remarked, &quot;as
we should have had to do if those beggars had caught us.&quot;</P>
<P>By the time that the calling-over bell rang, Tom and his new
comrades were all down, dressed in their best clothes, and he
had the satisfaction of answering &quot;here&quot; to his name for the
first time, the prepostor of the week having put it in at the
bottom of his list.  And then came breakfast and a saunter about
the close and town with East, whose lameness only became severe
when any fagging had to be done.  And so they whiled away the
time until morning chapel.</P>
<P>It was a fine November morning, and the close soon became alive
with boys of all ages, who sauntered about on the grass, or
walked round the gravel walk, in parties of two or three.  East,
still doing the cicerone, pointed out all the remarkable
characters to Tom as they passed:  Osbert, who could throw a
cricket-ball from the little-side ground over the rook-trees to
the Doctor's wall; Gray, who had got the Balliol scholarship,
and, what East evidently thought of much more importance, a
half-holiday for the School by his success; Thorne, who had run
ten miles in two minutes over the hour; Black, who had held his
own against the cock of the town in the last row with the louts;
and many more heroes, who then and there walked about and were
worshipped, all trace of whom has long since vanished from the
scene of their fame.  And the fourth-form boy who reads their
names rudely cut on the old hall tables, or painted upon the
big-side cupboard (if hall tables and big-side cupboards still
exist), wonders what manner of boys they were.  It will be the
same with you who wonder, my sons, whatever your prowess may be
in cricket, or scholarship, or football.  Two or three years,
more or less, and then the steadily advancing, blessed wave will
pass over your names as it has passed over ours.  Nevertheless,
play your games and do your work manfully - see only that that
be done - and let the remembrance of it take care of itself.</P>
<P>The chapel-bell began to ring at a quarter to eleven, and Tom
got in early and took his place in the lowest row, and watched
all the other boys come in and take their places, filling row
after row; and tried to construe the Greek text which was
inscribed over the door with the slightest possible success, and
wondered which of the masters, who walked down the chapel and
took their seats in the exalted boxes at the end, would be his
lord.  And then came the closing of the doors, and the Doctor in
his robes, and the service, which, however, didn't impress him
much, for his feeling of wonder and curiosity was too strong.
And the boy on one side of him was scratching his name on the
oak panelling in front, and he couldn't help watching to see
what the name was, and whether it was well scratched; and the
boy on the other side went to sleep, and kept falling against
him; and on the whole, though many boys even in that part of the
school were serious and attentive, the general atmosphere was by
no means devotional; and when he got out into the close again,
he didn't feel at all comfortable, or as if he had been to
church.</P>
<P>But at afternoon chapel it was quite another thing.  He had
spent the time after dinner in writing home to his mother, and
so was in a better frame of mind; and his first curiosity was
over, and he could attend more to the service.  As the hymn
after the prayers was being sung, and the chapel was getting a
little dark, he was beginning to feel that he had been really
worshipping.  And then came that great event in his, as in every
Rugby boy's life of that day - the first sermon from the Doctor.</P>
<P>More worthy pens than mine have described that scene - the oak
pulpit standing out by itself above the School seats; the tall,
gallant form, the kindling eye, the voice, now soft as the low
notes of a flute, now clear and stirring as the call of the
light-infantry bugle, of him who stood there Sunday after
Sunday, witnessing and pleading for his Lord, the King of
righteousness and love and glory, with whose Spirit he was
filled, and in whose power he spoke; the long lines of young
faces, rising tier above tier down the whole length of the
chapel, from the little boy's who had just left his mother to
the young man's who was going out next week into the great
world, rejoicing in his strength.  It was a great and solemn
sight, and never more so than at this time of year, when the
only lights in the chapel were in the pulpit and at the seats of
the prepostors of the week, and the soft twilight stole over the
rest of the chapel, deepening into darkness in the high gallery
behind the organ.</P>
<P>But what was it, after all, which seized and held these three
hundred boys, dragging them out of themselves, willing or
unwilling, for twenty minutes, on Sunday afternoons?  True,
there always were boys scattered up and down the School, who in
heart and head were worthy to hear and able to carry away the
deepest and wisest words there spoken.  But these were a
minority always, generally a very small one, often so small a
one as to be countable on the fingers of your hand.  What was it
that moved and held us, the rest of the three hundred reckless,
childish boys, who feared the Doctor with all our hearts, and
very little besides in heaven or earth; who thought more of our
sets in the School than of the Church of Christ, and put the
traditions of Rugby and the public opinion of boys in our daily
life above the laws of God?  We couldn't enter into half that we
heard; we hadn't the knowledge of our own hearts or the
knowledge of one another, and little enough of the faith, hope,
and love needed to that end.  But we listened, as all boys in
their better moods will listen (ay, and men too for the matter
of that), to a man whom we felt to be, with all his heart and
soul and strength, striving against whatever was mean and
unmanly and unrighteous in our little world.  It was not the
cold, clear voice of one giving advice and warning from serene
heights to those who were struggling and sinning below, but the
warm, living voice of one who was fighting for us and by our
sides, and calling on us to help him and ourselves and one
another.  And so, wearily and little by little, but surely and
steadily on the whole, was brought home to the young boy, for
the first time, the meaning of his life - that it was no fool's
or sluggard's paradise into which he had wandered by chance, but
a battlefield ordained from of old, where there are no
spectators, but the youngest must take his side, and the stakes
are life and death.  And he who roused this consciousness in
them showed them at the same time, by every word he spoke in the
pulpit, and by his whole daily life, how that battle was to be
fought, and stood there before them their fellow-soldier and the
captain of their band - the true sort of captain, too, for a
boy's army - one who had no misgivings, and gave no uncertain
word of command, and, let who would yield or make truce, would
fight the fight out (so every boy felt) to the last gasp and the
last drop of blood.  Other sides of his character might take
hold of and influence boys here and there; but it was this
thoroughness and undaunted courage which, more than anything
else, won his way to the hearts of the great mass of those on
whom he left his mark, and made them believe first in him and
then in his Master.</P>
<P>It was this quality above all others which moved such boys as
our hero, who had nothing whatever remarkable about him except
excess of boyishness - by which I mean animal life in its
fullest measure, good nature and honest impulses, hatred of
injustice and meanness, and thoughtlessness enough to sink a
three-decker.  And so, during the next two years, in which it
was more than doubtful whether he would get good or evil from
the School, and before any steady purpose or principle grew up
in him, whatever his week's sins and shortcomings might have
been, he hardly ever left the chapel on Sunday evenings without
a serious resolve to stand by and follow the Doctor, and a
feeling that it was only cowardice (the incarnation of all other
sins in such a boy's mind) which hindered him from doing so with
all his heart.</P>
<P>The next day Tom was duly placed in the third form, and began
his lessons in a corner of the big School.  He found the work
very easy, as he had been well grounded, and knew his grammar by
heart; and, as he had no intimate companions to make him idle
(East and his other School-house friends being in the lower
fourth, the form above him), soon gained golden opinions from
his master, who said he was placed too low, and should be put
out at the end of the half-year.  So all went well with him in
School, and he wrote the most flourishing letters home to his
mother, full of his own success and the unspeakable delights of
a public school.</P>
<P>In the house, too, all went well.  The end of the half-year was
drawing near, which kept everybody in a good humour, and the
house was ruled well and strongly by Warner and Brooke.  True,
the general system was rough and hard, and there was bullying in
nooks and corners - bad signs for the future; but it never got
farther, or dared show itself openly, stalking about the
passages and hall and bedrooms, and making the life of the small
boys a continual fear.</P>
<P>Tom, as a new boy, was of right excused fagging for the first
month, but in his enthusiasm for his new life this privilege
hardly pleased him; and East and others of his young friends,
discovering this, kindly allowed him to indulge his fancy, and
take their turns at night fagging and cleaning studies.  These
were the principal duties of the fags in the house.  From supper
until nine o'clock three fags taken in order stood in the
passages, and answered any prepostor who called &quot;Fag,&quot; racing to
the door, the last comer having to do the work.  This consisted
generally of going to the buttery for beer and bread and cheese
(for the great men did not sup with the rest, but had each his
own allowance in his study or the fifth-form room), cleaning
candlesticks and putting in new candles, toasting cheese,
bottling beer, and carrying messages about the house; and Tom,
in the first blush of his hero-worship, felt it a high privilege
to receive orders from and be the bearer of the supper of old
Brooke.  And besides this night-work, each prepostor had three
or four fags specially allotted to him, of whom he was supposed
to be the guide, philosopher, and friend, and who in return for
these good offices had to clean out his study every morning by
turns, directly after first lesson and before he returned from
breakfast.  And the pleasure of seeing the great men's studies,
and looking at their pictures, and peeping into their books,
made Tom a ready substitute for any boy who was too lazy to do
his own work.  And so he soon gained the character of a good-
natured, willing fellow, who was ready to do a turn for any one.</P>
<P>In all the games, too, he joined with all his heart, and soon
became well versed in all the mysteries of football, by
continual practice at the School-house little-side, which played
daily.</P>
<P>The only incident worth recording here, however, was his first
run at hare-and-hounds.  On the last Tuesday but one of the
half-year he was passing through the hall after dinner, when he
was hailed with shouts from Tadpole and several other fags
seated at one of the long tables, the chorus of which was, &quot;Come
and help us tear up scent.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom approached the table in obedience to the mysterious summons,
always ready to help, and found the party engaged in tearing up
old newspapers, copy-books, and magazines, into small pieces,
with which they were filling four large canvas bags.</P>
<P>&quot;It's the turn of our house to find scent for big-side hare-and-
hounds,&quot; exclaimed Tadpole.  &quot;Tear away; there's no time to lose
before calling-over.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's a great shame,&quot; said another small boy, &quot;to have
such a hard run for the last day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Which run is it?&quot; said Tadpole.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, the Barby run, I hear,&quot; answered the other; &quot;nine miles at
least, and hard ground; no chance of getting in at the finish,
unless you're a first-rate scud.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I'm going to have a try,&quot; said Tadpole; &quot;it's the last
run of the half, and if a fellow gets in at the end big-side
stands ale and bread and cheese and a bowl of punch; and the
Cock's such a famous place for ale.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should like to try too,&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, leave your waistcoat behind, and listen at the
door, after calling-over, and you'll hear where the meet is.&quot;</P>
<P>After calling-over, sure enough there were two boys at the door,
calling out, &quot;Big-side hare-and-hounds meet at White Hall;&quot; and
Tom, having girded himself with leather strap, and left all
superfluous clothing behind, set off for White Hall, an old
gable-ended house some quarter of a mile from the town, with
East, whom he had persuaded to join, notwithstanding his
prophecy that they could never get in, as it was the hardest run
of the year.</P>
<P>At the meet they found some forty or fifty boys, and Tom felt
sure, from having seen many of them run at football, that he and
East were more likely to get in than they.</P>
<P>After a few minutes' waiting, two well-known runners, chosen for
the hares, buckled on the four bags filled with scent, compared
their watches with those of young Brooke and Thorne, and started
off at a long, slinging trot across the fields in the direction
of Barby.</P>
<P>Then the hounds clustered round Thorne, who explained shortly,
&quot;They're to have six minutes' law.  We run into the Cock, and
every one who comes in within a quarter of an hour of the
hares'll be counted, if he has been round Barby church.&quot;  Then
came a minute's pause or so, and then the watches are pocketed,
and the pack is led through the gateway into the field which the
hares had first crossed.  Here they break into a trot,
scattering over the field to find the first traces of the scent
which the hares throw out as they go along.  The old hounds make
straight for the likely points, and in a minute a cry of
&quot;Forward&quot; comes from one of them, and the whole pack, quickening
their pace, make for the spot, while the boy who hit the scent
first, and the two or three nearest to him, are over the first
fence, and making play along the hedgerow in the long grass-
field beyond.  The rest of the pack rush at the gap already
made, and scramble through, jostling one another.  &quot;Forward&quot;
again, before they are half through.  The pace quickens into a
sharp run, the tail hounds all straining to get up to the lucky
leaders.  They are gallant hares, and the scent lies thick right
across another meadow and into a ploughed field, where the pace
begins to tell; then over a good wattle with a ditch on the
other side, and down a large pasture studded with old thorns,
which slopes down to the first brook.  The great Leicestershire
sheep charge away across the field as the pack comes racing down
the slope.  The brook is a small one, and the scent lies right
ahead up the opposite slope, and as thick as ever - not a turn
or a check to favour the tail hounds, who strain on, now
trailing in a long line, many a youngster beginning to drag his
legs heavily, and feel his heart beat like a hammer, and the
bad-plucked ones thinking that after all it isn't worth while to
keep it up.</P>
<P>Tom, East, and the Tadpole had a good start, and are well up for
such young hands, and after rising the slope and crossing the
next field, find themselves up with the leading hounds, who have
overrun the scent, and are trying back.  They have come a mile
and a half in about eleven minutes, a pace which shows that it
is the last day.  About twenty-five of the original starters
only show here, the rest having already given in; the leaders
are busy making casts into the fields on the left and right, and
the others get their second winds.</P>
<P>Then comes the cry of &quot;Forward&quot; again from young Brooke, from
the extreme left, and the pack settles down to work again
steadily and doggedly, the whole keeping pretty well together.
The scent, though still good, is not so thick; there is no need
of that, for in this part of the run every one knows the line
which must be taken, and so there are no casts to be made, but
good downright running and fencing to be done.  All who are now
up mean coming in, and they come to the foot of Barby Hill
without losing more than two or three more of the pack.  This
last straight two miles and a half is always a vantage ground
for the hounds, and the hares know it well; they are generally
viewed on the side of Barby Hill, and all eyes are on the
lookout for them to-day.  But not a sign of them appears, so now
will be the hard work for the hounds, and there is nothing for
it but to cast about for the scent, for it is now the hares'
turn, and they may baffle the pack dreadfully in the next two
miles.</P>
<P>Ill fares it now with our youngsters, that they are School-house
boys, and so follow young Brooke, for he takes the wide casts
round to the left, conscious of his own powers, and loving the
hard work.  For if you would consider for a moment, you small
boys, you would remember that the Cock, where the run ends and
the good ale will be going, lies far out to the right on the
Dunchurch road, so that every cast you take to the left is so
much extra work.  And at this stage of the run, when the evening
is closing in already, no one remarks whether you run a little
cunning or not; so you should stick to those crafty hounds who
keep edging away to the right, and not follow a prodigal like
young Brooke, whose legs are twice as long as yours and of cast-
iron, wholly indifferent to one or two miles more or less.
However, they struggle after him, sobbing and plunging along,
Tom and East pretty close, and Tadpole, whose big head begins to
pull him down, some thirty yards behind.</P>
<P>Now comes a brook, with stiff clay banks, from which they can
hardly drag their legs, and they hear faint cries for help from
the wretched Tadpole, who has fairly stuck fast.  But they have
too little run left in themselves to pull up for their own
brothers.  Three fields more, and another check, and then
&quot;Forward&quot; called away to the extreme right.</P>
<P>The two boys' souls die within them; they can never do it.
Young Brooke thinks so too, and says kindly, &quot;You'll cross a
lane after next field; keep down it, and you'll hit the
Dunchurch road below the Cock,&quot; and then steams away for the run
in, in which he's sure to be first, as if he were just starting.
They struggle on across the next field, the &quot;forwards&quot; getting
fainter and fainter, and then ceasing.  The whole hunt is out of
ear-shot, and all hope of coming in is over.</P>
<P>&quot;Hang it all!&quot; broke out East, as soon as he had got wind
enough, pulling off his hat and mopping at his face, all
spattered with dirt and lined with sweat, from which went up a
thick steam into the still, cold air.  &quot;I told you how it would
be.  What a thick I was to come!  Here we are, dead beat, and
yet I know we're close to the run in, if we knew the country.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Tom, mopping away, and gulping down his
disappointment, &quot;it can't be helped.  We did our best anyhow.
Hadn't we better find this lane, and go down it, as young Brooke
told us?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I suppose so - nothing else for it,&quot; grunted East.  &quot;If ever I
go out last day again.&quot;  Growl, growl, growl.</P>
<P>So they tried back slowly and sorrowfully, and found the lane,
and went limping down it, plashing in the cold puddly ruts, and
beginning to feel how the run had taken it out of them.  The
evening closed in fast, and clouded over, dark, cold, and
dreary.</P>
<P>&quot;I say, it must be locking-up, I should think,&quot; remarked East,
breaking the silence - &quot;it's so dark.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What if we're late?&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;No tea, and sent up to the Doctor,&quot; answered East.</P>
<P>The thought didn't add to their cheerfulness.  Presently a faint
halloo was heard from an adjoining field.  They answered it and
stopped, hoping for some competent rustic to guide them, when
over a gate some twenty yards ahead crawled the wretched
Tadpole, in a state of collapse.  He had lost a shoe in the
brook, and had been groping after it up to his elbows in the
stiff, wet clay, and a more miserable creature in the shape of
boy seldom has been seen.</P>
<P>The sight of him, notwithstanding, cheered them, for he was some
degrees more wretched than they.  They also cheered him, as he
was no longer under the dread of passing his night alone in the
fields.  And so, in better heart, the three plashed painfully
down the never-ending lane.  At last it widened, just as utter
darkness set in, and they came out on a turnpike road, and there
paused, bewildered, for they had lost all bearings, and knew not
whether to turn to the right or left.</P>
<P>Luckily for them they had not to decide, for lumbering along the
road, with one lamp lighted and two spavined horses in the
shafts, came a heavy coach, which after a moment's suspense they
recognized as the Oxford coach, the redoubtable Pig and Whistle.</P>
<P>It lumbered slowly up, and the boys, mustering their last run,
caught it as it passed, and began clambering up behind, in which
exploit East missed his footing and fell flat on his nose along
the road.  Then the others hailed the old scarecrow of a
coachman, who pulled up and agreed to take them in for a
shilling; so there they sat on the back seat, drubbing with
their heels, and their teeth chattering with cold, and jogged
into Rugby some forty minutes after locking-up.</P>
<P>Five minutes afterwards three small, limping, shivering figures
steal along through the Doctor's garden, and into the house by
the servants' entrance (all the other gates have been closed
long since), where the first thing they light upon in the
passage is old Thomas, ambling along, candle in one hand and
keys in the other.</P>
<P>He stops and examines their condition with a grim smile.  &quot;Ah!
East, Hall, and Brown, late for locking-up.  Must go up to the
Doctor's study at once.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well but, Thomas, mayn't we go and wash first?  You can put
down the time, you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doctor's study d'rectly you come in - that's the orders,&quot;
replied old Thomas, motioning towards the stairs at the end of
the passage which led up into the Doctor's house; and the boys
turned ruefully down it, not cheered by the old verger's
muttered remark, &quot;What a pickle they boys be in!&quot;  Thomas
referred to their faces and habiliments, but they construed it
as indicating the Doctor's state of mind.  Upon the short flight
of stairs they paused to hold counsel.</P>
<P>&quot;Who'll go in first?&quot; inquires Tadpole.</P>
<P>&quot;You - you're the senior,&quot; answered East.</P>
<P>&quot;Catch me.  Look at the state I'm in,&quot; rejoined Hall, showing
the arms of his jacket.  &quot;I must get behind you two.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but look at me,&quot; said East, indicating the mass of clay
behind which he was standing; &quot;I'm worse than you, two to one.
You might grow cabbages on my trousers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's all down below, and you can keep your legs behind the
sofa,&quot; said Hall.</P>
<P>&quot;Here, Brown; you're the show-figure.  You must lead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But my face is all muddy,&quot; argued Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, we're all in one boat for that matter; but come on; we're
only making it worse, dawdling here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, just give us a brush then,&quot; said Tom.  And they began
trying to rub off the superfluous dirt from each other's
jackets; but it was not dry enough, and the rubbing made them
worse; so in despair they pushed through the swing-door at the
head of the stairs, and found themselves in the Doctor's hall.</P>
<P>&quot;That's the library door,&quot; said East in a whisper, pushing Tom
forwards.  The sound of merry voices and laughter came from
within, and his first hesitating knock was unanswered.  But at
the second, the Doctor's voice said, &quot;Come in;&quot; and Tom turned
the handle, and he, with the others behind him, sidled into the
room.</P>
<P>The Doctor looked up from his task; he was working away with a
great chisel at the bottom of a boy's sailing boat, the lines of
which he was no doubt fashioning on the model of one of Nicias's
galleys.  Round him stood three or four children; the candles
burnt brightly on a large table at the farther end, covered with
books and papers, and a great fire threw a ruddy glow over the
rest of the room.  All looked so kindly, and homely, and
comfortable that the boys took heart in a moment, and Tom
advanced from behind the shelter of the great sofa.  The Doctor
nodded to the children, who went out, casting curious and amused
glances at the three young scarecrows.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, my little fellows,&quot; began the Doctor, drawing himself up
with his back to the fire, the chisel in one hand and his coat-
tails in the other, and his eyes twinkling as he looked them
over; &quot;what makes you so late?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please, sir, we've been out big-side hare-and-hounds, and lost
our way.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hah! you couldn't keep up, I suppose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said East, stepping out, and not liking that the
Doctor should think lightly of his running powers, &quot;we got round
Barby all right; but then -&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, what a state you're in, my boy!&quot; interrupted the Doctor,
as the pitiful condition of East's garments was fully revealed
to him.</P>
<P>&quot;That's the fall I got, sir, in the road,&quot; said East, looking
down at himself; &quot;the Old Pig came by -&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The what?&quot; said the Doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;The Oxford coach, sir,&quot; explained Hall.</P>
<P>&quot;Hah! yes, the Regulator,&quot; said the Doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;And I tumbled on my face, trying to get up behind,&quot; went on
East.</P>
<P>&quot;You're not hurt, I hope?&quot; said the Doctor.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well now, run upstairs, all three of you, and get clean things
on, and then tell the housekeeper to give you some tea.  You're
too young to try such long runs.  Let Warner know I've seen you.
Good-night.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good-night, sir.&quot;  And away scuttled the three boys in high
glee.</P>
<P>&quot;What a brick, not to give us even twenty lines to learn!&quot; said
the Tadpole, as they reached their bedroom; and in half an hour
afterwards they were sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's
room at a sumptuous tea, with cold meat - &quot;Twice as good a grub
as we should have got in the hall,&quot; as the Tadpole remarked with
a grin, his mouth full of buttered toast.  All their grievances
were forgotten, and they were resolving to go out the first big-
side next half, and thinking hare-and-hounds the most delightful
of games.</P>
<P>A day or two afterwards the great passage outside the bedrooms
was cleared of the boxes and portmanteaus, which went down to be
packed by the matron, and great games of chariot-racing, and
cock-fighting, and bolstering went on in the vacant space, the
sure sign of a closing half-year.</P>
<P>Then came the making up of parties for the journey home, and Tom
joined a party who were to hire a coach, and post with four
horses to Oxford.</P>
<P>Then the last Saturday, on which the Doctor came round to each
form to give out the prizes, and hear the master's last reports
of how they and their charges had been conducting themselves;
and Tom, to his huge delight, was praised, and got his remove
into the lower fourth, in which all his School-house friends
were.</P>
<P>On the next Tuesday morning at four o'clock hot coffee was going
on in the housekeeper's and matron's rooms; boys wrapped in
great-coats and mufflers were swallowing hasty mouthfuls,
rushing about, tumbling over luggage, and asking questions all
at once of the matron; outside the School-gates were drawn up
several chaises and the four-horse coach which Tom's party had
chartered, the postboys in their best jackets and breeches, and
a cornopean player, hired for the occasion, blowing away &quot;A
southerly wind and a cloudy sky,&quot; waking all peaceful
inhabitants half-way down the High Street.</P>
<P>Every minute the bustle and hubbub increased:  porters staggered
about with boxes and bags, the cornopean played louder.  Old
Thomas sat in his den with a great yellow bag by his side, out
of which he was paying journey-money to each boy, comparing by
the light of a solitary dip the dirty, crabbed little list in
his own handwriting with the Doctor's list and the amount of his
cash; his head was on one side, his mouth screwed up, and his
spectacles dim from early toil.  He had prudently locked the
door, and carried on his operations solely through the window,
or he would have been driven wild and lost all his money.</P>
<P>&quot;Thomas, do be quick; we shall never catch the Highflyer at
Dunchurch.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's your money all right, Green.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo, Thomas, the Doctor said I was to have two pound ten;
you've only given me two pound.&quot;  (I fear that Master Green is
not confining himself strictly to truth.)  Thomas turns his head
more on one side than ever, and spells away at the dirty list.
Green is forced away from the window.</P>
<P>&quot;Here, Thomas - never mind him; mine's thirty shillings.&quot;  &quot;And
mine too,&quot;  &quot;And mine,&quot; shouted others.</P>
<P>One way or another, the party to which Tom belonged all got
packed and paid, and sallied out to the gates, the cornopean
playing frantically &quot;Drops of Brandy,&quot; in allusion, probably, to
the slight potations in which the musician and postboys had been
already indulging.  All luggage was carefully stowed away inside
the coach and in the front and hind boots, so that not a hat-box
was visible outside.  Five or six small boys, with pea-shooters,
and the cornopean player, got up behind; in front the big boys,
mostly smoking, not for pleasure, but because they are now
gentlemen at large, and this is the most correct public method
of notifying the fact.</P>
<P>&quot;Robinson's coach will be down the road in a minute; it has gone
up to Bird's to pick up.  We'll wait till they're close, and
make a race of it,&quot; says the leader.  &quot;Now, boys, half a
sovereign apiece if you beat 'em into Dunchurch by one hundred
yards.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right, sir,&quot; shouted the grinning postboys.</P>
<P>Down comes Robinson's coach in a minute or two, with a rival
cornopean, and away go the two vehicles, horses galloping, boys
cheering, horns playing loud.  There is a special providence
over school-boys as well as sailors, or they must have upset
twenty times in the first five miles - sometimes actually
abreast of one another, and the boys on the roofs exchanging
volleys of peas; now nearly running over a post-chaise which had
started before them; now half-way up a bank; now with a wheel
and a half over a yawning ditch:  and all this in a dark morning,
with nothing but their own lamps to guide them.  However, it's
all over at last, and they have run over nothing but an old pig
in Southam Street.  The last peas are distributed in the Corn
Market at Oxford, where they arrive between eleven and twelve,
and sit down to a sumptuous breakfast at the Angel, which they
are made to pay for accordingly.  Here the party breaks up, all
going now different ways; and Tom orders out a chaise and pair
as grand as a lord, though he has scarcely five shillings left
in his pocket, and more than twenty miles to get home.</P>
<P>&quot;Where to, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Red Lion, Farringdon,&quot; says Tom, giving hostler a shilling.</P>
<P>&quot;All right, sir. - Red Lion, Jem,&quot; to the postboy; and Tom
rattles away towards home.  At Farringdon, being known to the
innkeeper, he gets that worthy to pay for the Oxford horses, and
forward him in another chaise at once; and so the gorgeous young
gentleman arrives at the paternal mansion, and Squire Brown
looks rather blue at having to pay two pound ten shillings for
the posting expenses from Oxford.  But the boy's intense joy at
getting home, and the wonderful health he is in, and the good
character he brings, and the brave stories he tells of Rugby,
its doings and delights, soon mollify the Squire, and three
happier people didn't sit down to dinner that day in England (it
is the boy's first dinner at six o'clock at home - great
promotion already) than the Squire and his wife and Tom Brown,
at the end of his first half-year at Rugby.</P>
