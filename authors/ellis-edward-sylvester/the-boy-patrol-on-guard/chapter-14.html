<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It has already been made clear to you that the sojourn of the
troop of Boy Scouts in the southern Maine woods during this summer
was simply a vacation in which there was a relaxation of rigid
discipline such as attended their hikes and what may be called
business outings. A certain part of each week-day was devoted
to drill; the bugle was sounded morning and evening; the National
Flag was saluted; yells practiced and so on. The leader simply
kept the youngsters on edge, as may be said. They were given full
liberty most of the time, with freedom to use the canoes for fishing
in the lake, or to wander in the woods studying trees, bird and
insect life, as the varying tastes of the boys prompted. One of
the most enjoyable treats of the boys was that of story telling.
This took place in the evening after supper, the extinguishment
of the outdoor fires, the putting away of the dishes and the setting
of things to rights. Scout Master Hall was never at a loss for
an instructive or amusing "yarn," but was too wise to give the
boys a surfeit. He encouraged them in the discussion of different
subjects, to explain what they had read and to try their own skill
at story telling.</p>

<p>"Never hurry in relating anything," said he, "for to do so is
to weaken its effect and cause impatience on the part of your
listeners. Try to bring out all the points; don’t grow garrulous
or wander from the main thread; don’t preach, or fish for a moral
where there isn’t any, and finally stop when you are through.</p>

<p>"Now, nothing is more certain than that Uncle Elk has an exhaustless
fund of stories in his wealth of knowledge and experience. You
have me with you always—or at least a good deal of the time—while
we shall not have him half as much as we wish. Let us, therefore,
use him while we can. Uncle Elk, tell us a story."</p>

<p>Every boy clapped his hands and looked expectantly at the old
gentleman sitting modestly in the background. He bowed in recognition,
while those who were seated in chairs shifted them around and
those on the floor adjusted their positions so as to face him.</p>

<p>"As Michael would say, this is so sudden that I am uncertain
for the moment how best to comply with your wishes; but while
listening to the examination of our young friend and the well
chosen words of Mr. Hall, I called to mind the record of a man
who lived and died many years before any of you were born, and
who in many respects will serve as a model for all Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>And this is the story which Uncle Elk told, and concerning which
I wish merely to say that it is strictly true in every particular:</p>

<p>"One of the strangest characters who had to do with the settlement
of the Middle West was Jonathan Chapman, born in New England in
1770. He was of gentle birth, and well educated, but was ill treated
by a young woman. I have never heard the particulars, but it is
said she turned him away in favor of another person, and Chapman
felt so bad he made an exile of himself.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, quite likely when you become a few years older, you
will meet some young woman who you will feel sure is the finest
person of her sex that ever lived, and perhaps you will think
life isn’t worth while unless you can win her love. I hope you
will have no such disappointments, but, if you do, don’t let it
break your heart. You have heard the old saying that there are
as fine fish in the sea as ever were caught. So there are thousands
of excellent girls and if you don’t gain the first one you fix
your affections upon, brace up and look around for another."</p>

<p>"And ’spose she likewise turns ye down, as was the case wid Tim
O’Shaughnessy in Ireland, who was rejected by more young leddies
than he could kaap count of?" gravely inquired Mike Murphy.</p>

<p>"Stick to it; never give up the ship."</p>

<p>"I’ll sind yer advice to Tim, though I misgive me that he will
die of old age while the search is still going on, but he must
find enj’yment in coorting or he wouldn’t keep at it as he does
and smile all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, to go back to Jonathan Chapman. He felt so bad that he
packed up his belongings and left New England forever. He started
for the West as it was then called and the next heard of him was
in what are now the states of Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky, which
at that time formed a part of the vast, wild Northwest Territory.
He tramped by himself among the scattered settlements and visited
the different tribes of Indians, who in those years were continually
on the war path; but no red man, no matter how fierce, ever tried
to harm Chapman."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Alvin Landon, voicing the surprise of the
other boys.</p>

<p>"The Indians believe that any one whose brain is unbalanced,
or who is seemingly lacking in some of his mental faculties, is
under the special care of the Great Spirit, and instead of trying
to injure such a person they will befriend him."</p>

<p>Mike nudged Alvin and said in an undertone which, however, every
one heard:</p>

<p>"Ye needn’t be afeared, me friend, to spend your days among the
same red gintlemen."</p>

<p>Alvin shook his fist at his friend, who dodged an imaginary blow.
Uncle Elk smiled at the by-play and continued:</p>

<p>"In some respects Chapman was a model Scout, for no kinder hearted
man ever lived. He would never kill an animal unless to save his
own life and even then he grieved over the necessity which made
him do it. When he almost stepped upon a coiled rattler, he would
turn aside and leave him unharmed. One cold night he started a
fire at the base of a huge oak in the woods. A few minutes later
he heard a great scratching inside the hollow trunk and the snout
of a she-bear was thrust out of the opening above his head. She
and her cubs were alarmed by the unusual proceeding and she seemed
to be getting ready to make a change of quarters with her family.
Chapman instantly kicked apart the burning brands and left. The
story is that he sat and shivered in other quarters the night
through, but I can’t see the necessity for that and I must think
he kindled a new fire after making sure he did not disturb any
wild creature.</p>

<p>"Chapman is remembered in the history of the Middle West as ‘Johnny
Appleseed,’ because he thought it was his mission to distribute
apple seeds among the settlers and Indians, asking only that they
should be planted and the king of all fruits cultivated. With
a bag thus filled and slung over his shoulder, he tramped for
hundreds of miles through all sorts of weather, sometimes paddling
down or up a river, sleeping wherever night overtook him, often
in Indian lodges and again in the lonely cabin of some settler,
or by the camp fire of a party of scouts far in the depths of
the wilderness. Whoever his hosts might be he presented them with
handfuls of seeds and made them promise to plant and tend the
fruit. Very few failed to keep their promise to him.</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised when I add that Johnny Appleseed was
deeply religious. He spent hours in prayer and tried to employ
his waking time just as he believed his Heavenly Father wished
him to use it. He was a Swedenborgian in faith, and in addition
to the stock of appleseeds he always carried a number of tracts
which he distributed among his friends. Since the Indians could
not read the printed words, he told them of the Great Spirit as
he believed him to be, and who shall say that such precious seed
did not bear fruitage?</p>

<p>"When his supply of tracts ran low, he tore them into separate
sheets and divided them among the scouts and settlers accompanying
them with a few words of counsel. The hardy men might jest with
him at times but they never purposely hurt his feelings. Simon
Kenton, one of the greatest of all the western scouts, kept for
years the tracts which he received from Johnny Appleseed. You
may not know it, but Kenton in his later days became a humble
Christian. He had a fine voice and often led the singing at the
famous camp meetings in the West.</p>

<p>"But to return to Johnny Appleseed. Year after year, in summer
and winter, in storm and sunshine, he tramped the lonely wilderness,
or guided his dugout up and down the rivers and streams, distributing
tracts and seeds, giving good advice and showing by his conduct
that he lived as close to his Saviour as mortal man can live.</p>

<p>"One summer afternoon he landed on the shore of the Ohio, and
with his plump bag of seeds over his shoulder, plunged into the
woods. He was on his way to a village of Wyandots, where he was
sure of welcome. Before he reached the place, he came upon nearly
a hundred warriors gathered in a large natural clearing. They
were running races, wrestling, throwing the tomahawk and firing
at targets. Moreover, their faces were daubed with black and red
paint.</p>

<p>"The first glance told Johnny the truth. These red men were about
to go on the war path. A raid had been planned upon the frontier
settlements, and fire, destruction and massacre would again sweep
along the border as it had done many times. Did Johnny argue or
plead with them? He was too wise to do that. He passed in and
out among the fierce bucks, addressing the leaders by name, giving
them handfuls of seeds and saying something pleasant to each.
He even stood by and praised their skill in marksmanship and athletic
sports. Not an Indian showed the slightest distrust, but treated
him with as much kindness as if he belonged to their own race
and meant to take part with them in the raid near at hand.</p>

<p>"Johnny stayed with them for more than an hour, then said good
bye and with the bag over his shoulder strolled toward the river
bank where he had left his dugout. As soon as he was beyond sight,
he dropped his burden to the ground and ran like a deer. Leaping
into the crude craft, he sent it skimming over the water like
a swallow, never pausing until he had gone five or six miles.
Then he caught sight of that for which he was hunting,—the gleam
of a tiny point of light in the dense undergrowth along shore.
He sped like an arrow to it and hardly paused to draw his boat
on the bank when he dashed to the camp fire with a shout. Had
he not called out his name, he probably would have been shot by
one of the three scouts who were broiling their evening meal,
for the rule with those hardy fellows was to shoot first and investigate
afterward.</p>

<p>"One of the party was Simon Kenton. They were out on a scout
because of rumors of impending trouble among the Shawnees, Wyandots
and other tribes. The story which Johnny Appleseed told made further
scouting on their part unnecessary: the red men were about to
start on the war path and no time was to be lost in warning the
settlements and exposed pioneers.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes after the arrival of the messenger the four had
scattered, all taking different directions and hurrying with the
speed of the wind through the dark wilderness. It would have been
throwing effort away to keep together or to travel in couples.
By breaking apart they could reach as many different points without
unnecessary delay and thus make the warning more general.</p>

<p>"Now, while Kenton and each of his comrades made all haste toward
the settlements, Johnny Appleseed put forth every effort to reach
the home of a pioneer acquaintance who lived by himself with his
wife and two small children. It was only a few miles off and was
certain to be visited by a small party of Wyandots, who would
draw away from the main band long enough to destroy the family
that, having no suspicion of their danger, would be caught unawares.</p>

<p>"The incident which followed sounds unbelievable and yet it was
only one of several similar ones. Despite Johnny’s haste when
he reached the clearing in front of the cabin, he discovered a
party of a dozen Wyandots, in the act of surrounding the house
with the intention of setting it on fire and burning the inmates
to death. The red men were too powerful and well prepared to be
beaten off by the single defender. Johnny carried no gun, his
only weapon being a large knife, which he used in preparing food
or his camp fire. Besides, he was ready at any time to give up
his life rather than fight.</p>

<p>"What he did do was to rush in among the painted warriors and
address them like some inspired prophet sent of heaven. He told
them the Great Spirit would be angry if they harmed the white
man who had always been their friend, and that disaster would
assuredly overtake them in their more important attack upon the
settlements. His message was from the Great Spirit and woe to
them if they closed their ears to his warning words!</p>

<p>"Well, he must have had a hard time of it, but he played his
part to perfection. In the end, the band of redskins drew off
and went back to the main company, the settler whom Johnny had
saved never dreaming of his danger or suspecting what had taken
place, until Johnny told him the story many years afterwards.
I may add that the main campaign proved what they called in those
days a ‘flash in the pan,’ since the message of Johnny Appleseed
gave Kenton and his two companions just enough time in which to
reach the stockades that otherwise might have been captured.</p>

<p>"I might tell you many stories of the remarkable man known as
Johnny Appleseed, who spent his life in doing good in his own
peculiar way. As I said at the beginning, he was an ideal Boy
Scout grown to maturity, whose sole purpose was to help his fellow
men. <em>That</em> is the basis of our organization. Every boy
and girl, every man and woman, can do something, and God judges
you only by the improvement you make of your opportunities. It
may not be yours to wander through the woods, distributing seeds
and tracts and giving good counsel, but you can speak the cheering
word, encourage the discouraged one, cheerfully obey your parents
and teachers, help the feeble and downhearted and do hundreds
of things which, small of themselves, amount in the end to more
than you can estimate. The consciousness that comes to you when
you do something of that kind repays you a hundred fold.</p>

<p>"Some folks say that Jonathan Chapman or Johnny Appleseed was
crazy. Measured according to our standards, perhaps he was mentally
unbalanced, but I have sometimes fancied that he was one of the
sanest of men, for he gave his all for humanity. He thought and
cared nothing for his own comfort. He often went hungry, shivered
with cold or panted with heat, but so long as life lasted he never
fainted by the way."</p>

<p>"How long did he live?" asked the Scout Master.</p>

<p>"Until about three-score and ten. The last picture that we have
of him is standing on an eminence and looking down with radiant
face on one of the most beautiful panoramas that mind can picture.
His long thin gray hair dangled over his shoulders, his beard
was white and scraggling, he had no cap or coat, the only garment
being a shaggy buffalo skin wrapped about his gaunt body, with
his legs below his knees bare. One of the leather bags was slung
over his shoulder, and a staff was in his hand.</p>

<p>"He died in 1847, and of him it may be said his labors bore fruit
over a hundred thousand square miles of territory. Limitless acres
of choicest apples in the Middle West sprang from the seeds which
he scattered over that vast region. His birthday—January 15—will
always be honored by the pomological societies of America." </p>
