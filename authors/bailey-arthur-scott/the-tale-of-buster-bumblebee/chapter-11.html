<p>Yes! Buster Bumblebee was a drone. He never gathered any nectar from the
flowers and brought it home to help swell the family store of honey. He
let the workers of the household do that. And since they never
complained, but seemed to enjoy their drudgery, Buster saw no reason why
he should interfere with the honey-making in any way.
</p>
<p>He was content to live a life of ease and pleasure. And never having to
bestir himself--never having to hurry or worry--he quickly grew into a
somewhat clumsy and blundering young gentleman. And what was still worse,
this handsome young idler soon gained the name of being none too
keen-witted. <u>Good-natured, but a bit stupid</u>--that was what the field
and forest folk called Buster Bumblebee.
</p><p>But bless you! <u>He</u> never bothered his head with what people said. When
anybody called him a drone he would only laugh. And when some busybody
asked him for pity's sake why didn't he go to work, he would merely grin
and reply that he was a queen's son and that queens' sons never did
anything except eat a plenty and have a good time.
</p><p>Well, that must have been an excellent answer, for it seemed to keep
people quiet. And it made some think that perhaps Buster Bumblebee was
not quite so dull as he often appeared.
</p><p>Once, indeed, he had thought it would be fun to help with the
honey-making. So he stopped one of the workers when she was on her way
home with a load of nectar.
</p><p>"Let me help you carry that home!" Buster said.
</p><p>Now, the workers were all a shrewish lot. They were terribly
short-tempered--especially if anybody interfered with their work, which
they loved better than anything else in the world.
</p><p>"Don't you come near me!" snapped the worker angrily. "Keep away or I'll
sting you!" she threatened.
</p><p>Naturally, a happy, easy-going person like Buster Bumblebee wasn't
looking for trouble of that sort. So he dodged clumsily out of sight
behind a milkweed; and he made up his mind then that that was the last
time he would ever have anything to do with one of those testy
honey-makers.
</p><p>Of course it was a bit difficult to avoid them entirely in a family of
two hundred or more, all living together in a medium-sized house. And so
Buster Bumblebee decided at last that he would be far happier in some
place that was not so crowded, and where there was no work going on--and
no workers.
</p><p>And so, one fine August day, Buster left the family home, never to set
foot inside it again. But he often passed that way and lingered just
outside the door, to listen to the music and the sound of dancing within.
</p><p>That was the thing that he missed most; for, like all his family, he was
fond of music. And he was forever humming to himself as he sipped nectar
from the clover-tops or the flowers in Farmer Green's garden.
