<p>For two days after that Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his own or at
Dolokhov's home: on the third day he received a note from him:</p>

<p>As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell
supper tonight to my friends- come to the English Hotel.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock Rostov went to the English Hotel straight from the
theater, where he had been with his family and Denisov. He was at once
shown to the best room, which Dolokhov had taken for that evening.
Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dolokhov sat
between two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper
money, and he was keeping the bank. Rostov had not seen him since
his proposal and Sonya's refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought
of how they would meet.</p>

<p>Dolokhov's clear, cold glance met Rostov as soon as he entered the
door, as though he had long expected him.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a long time since we met,&quot; he said. &quot;Thanks for coming. I'll
just finish dealing, and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I called once or twice at your house,&quot; said Rostov, reddening.</p>

<p>Dolokhov made no reply.</p>

<p>&quot;You may punt,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Rostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once
had with Dolokhov. &quot;None but fools trust to luck in play,&quot; Dolokhov
had then said.</p>

<p>&quot;Or are you afraid to play with me?&quot; Dolokhov now asked as if
guessing Rostov's thought.</p>

<p>Beneath his smile Rostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the
Club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he
had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually
cruel, action.</p>

<p>Rostov felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke
with which to reply to Dolokhov's words. But before he had thought
of anything, Dolokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and
deliberately so that everyone could hear:</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember we had a talk about cards... 'He's a fool who
trusts to luck, one should make certain,' and I want to try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To try his luck or the certainty?&quot; Rostov asked himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you'd better not play,&quot; Dolokhov added, and springing a new
pack of cards said: &quot;Bank, gentlemen!&quot;</p>

<p>Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostov sat down by his
side and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you play?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up
a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.</p>

<p>&quot;I have no money with me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll trust you.&quot;</p>

<p>Rostov staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and
again lost. Dolokhov &quot;killed,&quot; that is, beat, ten cards of Rostov's
running.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Dolokhov after he had dealt for some time. &quot;Please
place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I
ask you to put the money on your cards,&quot; replied Dolokhov. &quot;Don't
stint yourself, we'll settle afterwards,&quot; he added, turning to Rostov.</p>

<p>The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.</p>

<p>All Rostov's cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles
scored up against him. He wrote &quot;800 rubles&quot; on a card, but while
the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to
his usual stake of twenty rubles.</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it,&quot; said Dolokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking
at Rostov, &quot;you'll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others
but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?&quot; he asked again.</p>

<p>Rostov submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a
seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the
floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the
seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written
&quot;800 rubles&quot; in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm
champagne that was handed him, smiled at Dolokhov's words, and with
a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dolokhov's
hands which held the pack. Much depended on Rostov's winning or losing
on that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had
given his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked
speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all
he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical
this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough
for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more
till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that
money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of
sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word.
With a sinking heart he watched Dolokhov's hands and thought, &quot;Now
then, make haste and let me have this card and I'll take my cap and
drive home to supper with Denisov, Natasha, and Sonya, and will
certainly never touch a card again.&quot; At that moment his home life,
jokes with Petya, talks with Sonya, duets with Natasha, piquet with
his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the
Povarskaya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm
that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss,
long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the
seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him
of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and
plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could
not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dolokhov's
hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from
under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a
pipe that were handed him.</p>

<p>&quot;So you are not afraid to play with me?&quot; repeated Dolokhov, and as
if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in
his chair, and began deliberately with a smile:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, gentlemen, I've been told there's a rumor going about Moscow
that I'm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come now, deal!&quot; exclaimed Rostov.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, those Moscow gossips!&quot; said Dolokhov, and he took up the
cards with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Aah!&quot; Rostov almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The
seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He
had lost more than he could pay.</p>

<p>&quot;Still, don't ruin yourself!&quot; said Dolokhov with a side glance at
Rostov as he continued to deal.</p>
