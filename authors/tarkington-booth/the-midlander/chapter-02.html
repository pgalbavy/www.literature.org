<p>IT <em>WAS </em>not altogether without difficulty that the older
of the brothers graduated. Harlan obtained a diploma inscribed
with a special bit of classic praise, for he was an "Honour Man";
but Daniel trod the primrose way a little too gayly as a junior
and as a senior. Anxiety had sometimes been felt at home, though
knowledge of this was kept from old Mrs. Savage; and Mr. and Mrs.
Oliphant were relieved of a strain when Dan was granted his degree
at a most reluctant eleventh hour, and telegraphed them:</p>

Last prof to hold out gave up after I talked to him all<br/>
afternoon and said I could have diploma, if I would quit<br/>
arguing.

<p>Thus the two young bachelors of arts came forth together into
a pleasant world, of which they already knew somewhat less than
they supposed they did.</p>

<p>The world for them, in that day, which the newspapers were beginning
to call <em>fin de siècle</em>, included rather sketchily London,
Paris, Florence, and a part of the Alps, for they had spent two
vacations abroad with their parents; but in the main the field
of action to which they emerged from the campus consisted of their
own city and New York. No sooner were they out of the university
than they began the series of returns eastward that was part of
the life of every affluent young midland graduate. They went back
for the football games, for class dinners, for baseball and boat
races, and commencement. New York was their playground as they
went and came; and they remained there to play for months at a
time.</p>

<p>It was a pleasanter playground in those days than it is now,
when even the honeycombed ground under foot has its massacres,
and the roaring surface congests with multitude on multitude till
fires must burn and patients must die, since neither firemen nor
doctors may pass. For the growth came upon New York as it came
upon the midland cities, and it produced a glutted monster, able
to roar and heave and mangle, but not to digest or even to swallow
the swarms that came begging to be devoured. In the change there
perished something romantic and charming, something that a true
poet used to call Bagdad.</p>

<p>So far as it concerned Mr. Daniel Oliphant, aged twenty-six,
New York was romantic Bagdad enough when the jingling harness
began to glitter in the park and on the Avenue in the afternoon,
and he would go out from the Holland House to see the pretty women,
all beautifully dressed, he thought, and wearing clumps of violets,
or orchids, as they reclined in their victorias drawn by high-stepping
horses. Dan liked to watch, too, the handsome grooms and coachmen
in their liveries, with cockaded silk hats, white breeches, top
boots, and blue coats; for they were the best-dressed men in the
town, he thought, and he often wished he knew whether they were
really as haughty as the horses they drove or only affected to
be so proud professionally.</p>

<p>In New York, this Daniel took some thought to his own tailoring
and haberdashing; he would even add a camellia to the lapel of
his frock coat when he strolled down to lounge in the doorway
of the great Fifth Avenue Hotel and stare at the procession of
lovely girls from everywhere in the country, their faces rosy
in the wind, as they walked up Broadway after an autumn matinée.
Then he would join the procession, a friend accoutred like himself
being usually with him, and they would accompany the procession
sedately in its swing up the Avenue; sometimes leaving it, however,
at the magnificent new Waldorf, where the men’s café offered them
refreshment among lively companions. In truth, this congenial
resort had too great an attraction for the amiable Dan, and so
did the room with the big mirror behind the office at the Holland
House. Moreover, when he spoke of Daly’s, he did not always mean
Mr. Augustin Daly’s theatre, though he preferred it to the other
theatres; sometimes he meant a Daly’s where adventure was to be
obtained by any one who cared to bet he could guess when a marble
would stop rolling upon a painted disk.</p>

<p>Of course he made excursions into the Bowery, waltzed and two-stepped
at the Haymarket after long dinners at clubs, fell asleep in hansom
cabs at sunrise, and conducted himself in general about as did
any other "rather wild young man," native or alien, in the metropolis.
There were droves of such young men, and, like most of the others,
Dan frequently became respectable, and went to a dinner or a dance
at the house of a classmate; he was even seen at church in the
pew of a Madison Avenue family of known severity. However, no
one was puzzled by this act of devotion, for Lena McMillan, the
daughter of the severe house, was pretty enough to be the explanation
for anything.</p>

<p>Her brother George, lacking the severity of other McMillans,
and as unobtrusive as possible in advertising that lack, was one
of Dan’s chance acquaintances during a Bagdadian night. At the
conclusion of many festivities, the chance acquaintance murmured
his address, but Dan comprehended the unwisdom of a sunrise return
of so flaccid a young gentleman into a house as formidable as
the McMillans’ appeared to be, when the night-hawk hansom stopped
before it; and the driver was instructed to go on to the Holland
House. Young McMillan woke at noon in Dan’s room there; shuddered
to think that but for a Good Samaritan this waking might have
taken place at home, and proved himself first grateful, then devoted.
It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship; and he took Dan
to tea in Madison Avenue that afternoon.</p>

<p>Something withholding about the McMillans reminded their guest
of his brother Harlan; and probably Dan would have defined this
as "an air of reserve"; but it was more than reserve, deeper than
reserve, as in time he discovered. George McMillan alone seemed
to have none of it; on the contrary, his air was habitually friendly
and apologetic—possibly because of what he knew about himself
and what his family didn’t. Mrs. McMillan and her daughters found
it unnecessary either to smile or offer their hands when George
presented the good-looking young Midlander, nor did they seem
to believe themselves committed to any effort to make the stranger
feel at home in their long, dark drawing-room.</p>

<p>They gave him a cup of tea and a bit of toast, and that appeared
to be the end of their obligation to a stray guest, for they at
once continued a conversation begun before his arrival, not addressing
themselves to him or even looking at him. Mrs. McMillan’s cousin’s
husband, named Oliver, he gathered, was about to be offered a
position in the cabinet at Washington, and Mrs. McMillan hoped
Oliver wouldn’t accept, because Milly and Anna and Charlotte,
persons unknown to Dan, would have to give up so much if they
went to live in Washington instead of Boston. If it were an ambassadorship
the President wanted Oliver for, that would be better, especially
on Charlotte’s account.</p>

<p>The guest began to have an uncomfortable feeling that he must
be invisible;—no one seemed to know that he was present, not even
the grateful George, who was feeble that afternoon and looked
distrustfully at his tea, of which he partook with an air of foreboding.
Dan could not help meditating upon what a difference there would
have been if the position were reversed, with George as the guest
and himself as the host. Dan thought of it: how heartily his mother
and father would have shaken hands with the young Easterner, welcoming
him, doing every reassuring thing they could to make him feel
at home, talking cordial generalities until they could get better
acquainted and find what interested him. But although Dan felt
awkward and even a little resentful, it was not the first time
he had been exposed to this type of hospitality, and he was able
to accept it as the custom of the country. He made the best of
it and was philosophic, thinking that the McMillans had given
tea to a great many stray young men of whom they knew nothing,
and saw once but usually never again. Also, it was a pleasure
to look at Lena McMillan, even though she was so genuinely unaware
of him.</p>

<p>Outwardly, at least, she was unlike her mother and older sister.
Mrs. McMillan was a large woman, shapely, but rather stony—or
so she appeared to Dan—and her hair rose above her broad pink
forehead as a small dome of trim gray curls, not to be imagined
as ever being disarranged or uncurled or otherwise than as they
were. She and her older daughter, who resembled her, both wore
black of an austere fashionableness; but the younger Miss McMillan
had alleviated her own dark gown with touches of blue—not an impertinent
blue, but a blue darkly effective; and, with what seemed almost
levity in this heavy old drawing-room, she wore Italian earrings
of gold and lapis lazuli. Her mother did not approve of these;
no one except opera singers wore earrings, Mrs. McMillan had told
her before the arrival of the two young men.</p>

<p>Lena was sometimes defined as a "<em>petite brunette</em>," and
sometimes as a "perfectly beautiful French doll"; for she had
to perfection a doll’s complexion and eyelashes; but beyond this
point the latter definition was unfair, since dolls are usually
thought wanting in animation, a quality she indeed possessed.
Dan Oliphant, watching her, thought he had never before met so
sparkling a creature; and a glamour stole over him. He began to
think she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Possibly she became aware of the favour with which he was regarding
her, for although her shoulder and profile were toward him, and
for twenty minutes and more she seemed to be as unconscious of
his presence as her mother and older sister really were, she finally
gave him a glance and spoke to him. "George tells me you’re from
the West," she said.</p>

<p>"No. Not very," he returned.</p>

<p>"Not very west?"</p>

<p>"I mean not from the Far West," Dan explained. "Out there they’d
call me an Easterner, of course."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" she cried incredulously. "Would they, really?"</p>

<p>Already he thought her a wonderful being, but at this he showed
some spirit. "I’m afraid so," he said.</p>

<p>She laughed, not offended, and exclaimed: "Oh, so you don’t <em>mind</em>
being a Westerner! I only meant you people are so funny about
rubbing in the letter <em>R</em> and overdoing the short A that
no one can ever make a mistake about which of the provinces you
belong in. I’ve been in the West, myself—rather west, that is.
I didn’t care for it much."</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>"Rochester. I believe you’re from farther out, aren’t you? Perhaps
you can tell me if it’s true, what we hear things are like beyond
Rochester."</p>

<p>"Things beyond Rochester?" he asked, mystified. "What sort of
things do you mean?"</p>

<p>"All sorts," she answered. "I’ve always heard that when you get
west of Rochester every house has a room you people call a ‘sitting-room’,
and you always keep a sewing-machine in it and apples on a centre
table, and all the men keep tobacco in their cheeks and say, ‘Wa’al,
no, ma’am,’ and ‘Why, certainly, ma’am,’ and ‘Yes, <em>ma’am</em>!’
Isn’t that what it’s like?"</p>

<p>"Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I had a cousin who used to visit people out there. She said
it was funny but dreadful. Isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"I wish you’d come and see," he said earnestly. "I wish you and
your brother’d come and let me show you."</p>

<p>"Good heavens," she cried;—"but you’re hospitable! Do you always
ask everybody to visit you after they’ve said two words to you?"</p>

<p>"No, not everybody," he returned, and on the impulse continued:
"I’d ask <em>you</em>, though, after you’d said <em>one</em> word
to me." And because he meant it, he instantly became red.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she cried again, and stared at him thoughtfully,
perceiving without difficulty his heightened colour. "Is that
the way they talk in the West, Mr.—uh——"</p>

<p>"Oliphant," he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"My name’s Oliphant," he informed her apologetically. "You called
me Mister Uh."</p>

<p>"I see," she said, and as her attention was caught just then
by something her sister was saying about Milly and Anna and Charlotte
and Oliver, she turned from him to say something more, herself,
about Milly and Anna and Charlotte and Oliver. Then, having turned
away from him, she turned not back again, but seemed to have forgotten
him.</p>

<p>The son of the house presently took him away, the mother and
her older daughter murmuring carelessly as the two young men rose
to go, while Lena said more distinctly, "Good afternoon, Mister
Uh." But the unfortunate Daniel carried with him a picture that
remained tauntingly before his mind’s eye; and he decided to stay
in New York a little longer, though he had written his father
that he would leave for home the next day. He had been stricken
at first sight.</p>

<p>He could not flatter himself that she had bestowed a thought
upon him. On the contrary, he told himself that his impetuosity
had made headway backwards; and he was as greatly astonished as
he was delighted when George McMillan came to see him two afternoons
later, at the Holland House, and brought him a card for a charity
ball at the Metropolitan. "We had some extra ones," George said.
"Lena thought you might like to come."</p>

<p>"She did? Why, I—I——" Dan was breathless at once.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, I didn’t think she noticed I was on earth. This is perfectly
beautiful of her!"</p>

<p>"Why, no," George assured him; "it’s nothing at all. We had four
or five cards we really didn’t know what to do with. There’ll
be an awful crowd there, all kinds of people."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but it was just beautiful of her to think of me."
And Dan added solemnly: "That sister of yours reminds me of a
flower."</p>

<p>"She does?" George said, visibly surprised. "You mean Lena?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. She’s like the most perfect flower that ever blossomed."</p>

<p>"That’s strange news to me," said George. "Then maybe you’d be
willing to come to the house to dinner and go to this show with
the family. Heaven knows I’d like to have you; it might help me
to sneak out after we get ’em there. You sure you could stand
it?"</p>

<p>"I should consider it the greatest privilege of my life," said
Dan.</p>

<p>"Heavens, but you’re solemn!" his caller exclaimed. "You make
me feel at home—I mean, as if I were at home with my solemn family.
Wait till you meet some of the others—and my father. He’s the
solemnest. In fact, they’re all solemn except Lena. There’s only
one trouble with Lena."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The poor thing hasn’t got any sense," Lena’s brother said lightly.
"Never did. Never will have. Otherwise she’s charming—when she’s
in a mood to be!"</p>

<p>Evidently Lena was in a mood to be charming that night; she sat
next to Dan at the solemn dinner and chattered to him gayly, though
in a lowered voice, for George had not exaggerated when he spoke
of his father. If she was a French doll, she was at least a radiant
one in her ball gown of heavy ivory silk, and it was a thrilled
young Midlander indeed who took her lightly in his arms for a
two-step when they came out upon the dancing floor that had been
laid over the chairs at the opera house. "It was nice of you to
send me these flowers," she said, as he dexterously moved her
through the crowd of other two-steppers. "They’d tell anybody
you’re Western, if nothing else would. Western men always send
orchids. But then, of course, nobody’d need to be told you’re
from out there. You tell them yourself."</p>

<p>"You mean I always mention it?"</p>

<p>"No," she laughed;—"your dialect does. The way you pronounce
<em>R</em> and <em>A</em>, and slide your words together."</p>

<p>"I’ve got a brother that doesn’t," said Dan. "He talks the way
you and your family do; he says ‘lahst’ and ‘fahst’ and calls
father ‘fathuh’ and New York ‘New Yawk,’ and keeps all his words
separated. He began it when he was about fifteen and he’s stuck
to it ever since. Says he doesn’t do it to be English, but because
it’s correct pronunciation. I expect you’d like him."</p>

<p>At that she looked up at him suddenly, and he was shown an inscrutable
depth of dark blue glance that shook his heart. "I like <em>you</em>!"
she said.</p>

<p>"Do you?" he gasped. "You didn’t seem to, that day I met you."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I didn’t decide I liked you till after you’d gone.
You aren’t quite cut to the pattern of most of the men I know.
There’s something hearty about your looks; and I like your broad
shoulders and your not seeming to have put a sleek surface over
you. At least it’s pleasant for a change."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he asked, a little disappointed. "Just for a change?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Is there anybody else in your family besides your
brother?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, yes! To begin with, I’ve got a grand old grandmother;
she’s over ninety, but she’s the head of the family all right!
Then there’s my father and mother——"</p>

<p>"What are they like?"</p>

<p>"My mother’s beautiful," Dan said. "She’s just the loveliest,
kindest person in the world, and so’s my father. He’s a lawyer."</p>

<p>"What are you?"</p>

<p>"I’m nothin’ at all yet. So far, I’ve just been helpin’ my grandmother
settle up my grandfather’s estate. Somebody had to, and my brother’s
in my father’s office."</p>

<p>"And do your grandmother and your mother have sitting-rooms with
sewing-machines in them?"</p>

<p>"I wish you’d come and see."</p>

<p>"Do you?" She had continued to look at him, and now her eyes
almost deliberately became dreamy. "I might—if you keep on asking
me," she said gravely. "I’m sure I’d hate the West, though."</p>

<p>"Yet, you might come?"</p>

<p>"Ask me again to-morrow."</p>

<p>He was but too glad to be obedient, and asked her again the next
day. This was over a table for two at a restaurant on Lafayette
Place, where she met him as a surreptitious adventure, suggested
by herself and undertaken without notifying her mother. It was
a Lochinvar courtship, she said afterward, thus implying that
her share in it was passive, though there were indeed days when
the young man out of the West found her not merely passive, but
dreamily indifferent. And once or twice she was more than that,
puzzling and grieving him by an inexplicable coldness almost like
anger, so that he consulted George McMillan to find out what could
be the matter.</p>

<p>"Moods," George told him. "She’s nothing but moods. Just has
’em; that’s all. It doesn’t matter how you are to her; sometimes
she’ll treat you like an angel and sometimes like the dickens.
It doesn’t depend on anything you do."</p>

<p>Dan thought her all the more fascinating, and put off his return
home another month, to the increasing mystification of his family,
for this month included the Christmas holidays, and Mrs. Oliphant
wrote that they all missed him, and that Mrs. Savage really needed
him. The McMillans, on the other hand, were not mystified, and
Lena appeared to be able to control them. The manner of her parents
and her sister toward the suitor was one of endurance—an endurance
that intended to be as thoroughbred as it could, but was nevertheless
evident. It had no discouraging effect on the ardent young man,
who took it as a privilege to be endured by beings so close to
her. Besides, George McMillan was helpful with the exalted family,
for he showed both tact and sympathy, though the latter sometimes
appeared to consist of a compassionate amusement; and once he
went so far as to ask Dan, laughingly, if he were quite sure he
knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>"Am I <em>sure</em>?" Dan repeated incredulously. "I don’t know
what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean about Lena."</p>

<p>"To me," Dan said, with the solemnity he had come to use in speaking
of her, "your sister Lena is the finest flower of womanhood ever
created!"</p>

<p>Upon that, his friend stared at him and saw that his eyes were
bright with a welling moisture, so deep was his worship; and George
was himself affected.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, if you feel that way about it," he said, "I guess
it’ll be all right. I’m sure it will. You’re a mighty right chap,
I think."</p>

<p>"I?" Dan exclaimed. "I’m nothin’ at all! And when I think that
your sister could stoop—could <em>stoop</em> to—to <em>me</em>—why,
I——"</p>

<p>He was overcome and could not go on.</p>

<p>The end of it was that when he went home in February it was to
acquaint his family with the fact of his engagement; and in spite
of his happiness he was a little uneasy. He did not fear the interview
with his father and mother; and though he disliked the prospect
of talking about Lena with Harlan, who was sure to be critical
and superior, he had learned to get along without Harlan’s approval.
What made him uneasy was his anticipation of the invincible pessimism
of that iron old lady, his grandmother. </p>
