<p>Lying a short distance off the Maine coast is an island which
belongs to nobody and is therefore referred to as No Man's Land.
If you look for it on the map you will find it marked as Muscongus.
It is also known as Loud's Island, in honor of the first settler.
The strange state of affairs came about in this way:</p>

<p>The Lincolnshire or Muscongus Patent, granted in 1630 by the
Council of Plymouth to Beauchamp and Leverett, included the land
from the seaboard, between the Muscongus and Penobscot rivers,
for a certain distance inland, but made no mention of the island
on the south. The grant passed to General Samuel Waldo, and was
the origin of most of the land titles in that section of Maine.</p>

<p>One of the most honored names in colonial England is that of
Samoset, the Wampanoag Indian, who met the first Plymouth settlers
with the English greeting, "Welcome, Englishmen!" He had picked
up a few words from the fishermen who made their headquarters
at Monhegan, an island ten miles farther out to sea. Samoset was
accustomed to spend his summers on Muscongus. If you dig in the
sand on the island you will be pretty sure to find relics of the
aboriginal occupation of the place.</p>

<p>Captain Loud commanded a privateer in the service of George <em>III,
</em>and one day lost his temper in a dispute over some prize
money. The quarrel waxed so hot that he declared in his rage he
would never lift his hand again in the service of the king, even
to save the monarch's head. Such <em>lese majest√©</em> was sure
to bring serious consequences to the peppery old salt, so he hurriedly
sailed for Boston on his brig. While coasting the province of
Maine, he came upon Muscongus, and was so charmed that he spent
the remainder of his life there. In some way that no one can explain,
the United States surveyors overlooked this island, three miles
in length and a mile broad, and the mistake has never been corrected.
Muscongus therefore remains no man's land.</p>

<p>It is well wooded and watered and has a picturesque shore, with
rocky coves, white sandy beaches, and an attractive appearance
from every direction. No steamer ever stops there, and it is rather
ticklish business to pick your way over the crags to the dilapidated
landing and so on to the firm land beyond.</p>

<p>The unique condition of Muscongus causes some queer things. For
a long time, the people, who now number a hundred and twenty-five,
paid taxes to the township of Bristol on the mainland two miles
away. Every year the tax collector sailed or rowed over to Muscongus
and marked in chalk on each door the amount of taxes due from
that family. He gave his receipt for payment of the same by rubbing
out the chalked figures.</p>

<p>This was a pleasing but one-sided arrangement. Bristol gained
the sole advantage and by and by the Muscongus folks awoke to
the fact. Then they refused to pay any taxes unless the collector
showed legal authority for his assessment. The chalk marks were
rubbed off the doors and after some spirited scenes the collector
withdrew, since, as has been shown, he had no legal means of enforcing
his demands. Since then Muscongus has been the only community
in New England which is not taxed, except so far as it chooses
to impose the burden upon itself.</p>

<p>Among the islanders every man was a Democrat with a single exception.
At the Congressional election on the mainland the Republican candidate
was unpopular, but the vote of Muscongus was cast for and elected
him. The canvassers, however, threw out the vote because of the
refusal to pay taxes. This was just before the Civil War, and
in the words of the chronicler of Muscongus: "That was the end
of all things here in connection with the mainland."</p>

<p>You need not be reminded that as the great war went on the government
was forced to resort to drafting to obtain the soldiers it needed.
Muscongus was included in the Bristol district, but the inhabitants
warned the authorities that any attempt to enforce the draft would
cause bloodshed. Some of them, however, were alarmed at the thought
of fighting the national government. At a mass meeting the community
voted to donate nine hundred dollars toward the expense of the
war, and a number paid three hundred dollars apiece for substitutes,
though none volunteered. These contributions meant many sacrifices
to the poor fisher folk.</p>

<p>A man living on Muscongus had once served in the regular army,
and a certain major at Bristol determined to secure him for Uncle
Sam. The officer was taken over to the island in a small sailboat,
and made his way to the home of the veteran he wanted. He was
absent, but his wife was in the kitchen peeling potatoes. A few
minutes later the major's companions awaiting him at the shore
saw him dash through the door and run at his highest speed for
the boat. A few paces behind him, holding the pan of potatoes
against her side with one hand, and snatching them out with the
other, she bombarded the terrified fugitive. She could throw,
too, with the force and accuracy of a short stop of the professional
league, and every missile landed. She kept up the bombardment
all the way to the waterside, by which time her ammunition was
used up. When the battered major stepped ashore at Bristol he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Thunderation! if I had a regiment of women like her I'd capture
Richmond in three days!"</p>

<p>The foregoing facts Captain Alvin Landon related to Chester Haynes
and Mike Murphy one sunshiny forenoon as the <em>Deerfoot</em>
swept past the numerous islands between Cape Newagen and Pemaquid
Point, and rounded to at the rickety landing on the southern side
of Muscongus. The boys stepped out upon the rocks, leaping and
climbing to the wabbling support over which they picked their
way to the solid earth. A few rods distant a goodly sized sailboat
was moored, the passengers having already gone up the sloping
bank and inland. Hardly a fair summer day goes by without bringing
visitors to one of the most interesting spots on the coast of
Maine.</p>

<p>Since the excursion was likely to take most of the afternoon,
our young friends brought their lunch with them. At the crest
of the slope, they sat down on the grass under a group of trees,
and with keen appetites ate the last morsel of their meal. Then
followed a stroll, with ears and eyes open. They found the islanders
courteous, hospitable and ready to answer all questions. One of
the first interesting facts learned by the youthful callers was
that nearly all the people were blue-eyed, and the men straight,
tall, rugged and with a physique superior to that of their neighbors
on the mainland. Several descendants of the Loud and other pioneers
were met, one or two of whom were approaching the century mark.
Contentment was everywhere, and all were proud of their independent
lives with not the slightest wish to change it. Some of the men
seek their wives outside of the little model republic, and more
than one husband has been drawn to the island by the attraction
of a pair of violet eyes and the sweet disposition of a coy maiden.
It has been charged that there is a mental and physical deterioration
because of intermarriages between relatives, but nothing of the
kind seems to have occurred.</p>

<p>Muscongus knows little, except by hearsay, of crime and pauperism.
All the doors are left unlocked at night, and a drunken person
is never seen. Should any fall in need of charity it is given
cheerfully. Years ago there was an aged couple whose five sons
were lost at sea, and who were unable to provide for themselves.
They were supported in comfort in their own home as long as they
lived.</p>

<p>Of course there has to be some form of government. It is of the
simplest nature. All general meetings are held in the little schoolhouse,
the only public building on the island. The presiding officer
is chosen by acclamation, and is always the school agent and superintendent
of business of the community. An open discussion follows of the
measures needed for the public welfare, and whatever rules are
adopted are obeyed without protest.</p>

<p>In former years the porgy industry was the chief support. But
that declined and was succeeded by lobster and mackerel fishing,
which does not pay so well. Every family owns a little farm, the
soil is good, and all live in modest comfort. The neat, tidy houses
nestling among the firs are surrounded by fruit trees trim and
productive. The small library in the schoolhouse is free to all.</p>

<p>As to religious services, a prayer meeting is held every Sunday
evening in the schoolhouse and Sunday School in the afternoon,
but there is no resident minister. Occasionally the clergyman
at Friendship, near Bristol, comes over to preach, and the faithful
coast missionary who works among remote islanders and lighthouse
keepers brings reading matter and ministers to the spiritual wants
of the people. Among the islanders are Free Masons, Odd Fellows,
Knights of Pythias and Red Men, who conduct the funeral services.</p>

<p>"It calls to mind the ould counthry," said Mike Murphy, when
the <em>Deerfoot</em> had started homeward.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Chester at his side.</p>

<p>"It's so different; think if ye can of any part of Ireland living
for a waak, lit alone months and years, widout a shindy."</p>

<p>"There are few sections in our own country of which that can
be said."</p>

<p>"It taxes me mind to thry to draw the painful picter; let us
think of something else."</p>

<p>Since the weather was favorable, Captain Landon made a circuit
farther south, leaving the small White Islands on his left, the
Hypocrites on his right, and so on into the broad bay, whose western
boundary is Southport.</p>

<p>"I say, Captain," suddenly called Mike.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Landon, looking partly round.</p>

<p>"If ye have no objiction I should like to take a thrick at the
wheel."</p>

<p>"All right; come over here."</p>

<p>In a twinkling the two had changed places. As Mike assumed his
duty, he added:</p>

<p>"I've been obsarving ye so close that I belave I can run the
battleship as well as yersilf. I have noted that whin ye wish
to turn to the right, ye move the wheel around that way, sarving
it according whin ye wish to head t'other way. 'Spose now ye find
it nicessary to go backward?"</p>

<p>"Pull over the reversing lever; the wheel has nothing to do with
that."</p>

<p>"I'll remimber the same. Hullo!" added Mike in some excitement.
"I obsarve a ship ahead; do ye think it's a pirate?"</p>

<p>His companions laughed and Alvin answered:</p>

<p>"That is the steamer <em>Enterprise</em>, which runs from Portland
to East Boothbay and back on alternate days, calling at different
points."</p>

<p>"I mustn't run her down," said Mike, swinging over the wheel
so as to pass her bow; "she's right in our path."</p>

<p>"Don't change your course; she has plenty of time to get out
of your way."</p>

<p>"Begorrah! do ye maan to say <em>she is moving</em>?"</p>

<p>His companions scrutinized the lumbering craft for a minute as
if in doubt. It was Chester who said:</p>

<p>"I think she is."</p>

<p>"Better make sure," remarked Mike heading the launch to the south,
thus contributing his part to a joke which has been fashionable
for years in that section of the Union over the sluggishness of
the freight and passenger steamer named.</p>
