<p>Never lived any person with more possession of himself than Antonio;
he bowed to each of us with the utmost amiability; and for expression&mdash;all
one saw of it was a little streak of light in his eye-glass.</p>

<p>"It is yourself, Raffaele?" he said to me, in the politest manner,
in our own tongue, the others thinking it some commonplace, and
I knew by his voice that the meeting was as surprising and as
exasperating to him as to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes dazzling flashes of light explode across the eyes of
blind people. Such a thing happened to my own, now, in the darkness.
I found myself hot all over with a certain rashness that came
to me. I felt that anything was possible if I would but dare enough.</p>

<p>"I am able to see that it is the same yourself!" I answered,
and made the faintest eye-turn toward Miss Landry. Simultaneously
bowing, I let my hand fall upon my pocket&mdash;a language which he
understood, and for which (the Blessed Mother be thanked!) he
perceived that I meant to offer battle immediately, though at
that moment he offered me an open smile of benevolence. He knew
nothing of my new cause for war; there was enough of the old!</p>

<p>The others were observing us.</p>

<p>"You have met?" asked the gentle voice of Miss Landry. "You know
each other?"</p>

<p>"Exceedingly!" I answered, bowing low to her.</p>

<p>"The dinner is waiting in our own salon," said Mrs. Landry, interrupting.
She led the way with Antonio to an open door on the terrace where
servants were attending, and such a forest of flowers on the table
and about the room as almost to cause her escort to stagger; for
I knew, when I caught sight of them, that he had never been wise
enough to send them. Neither had Poor Jr. done it out of wisdom,
but because of his large way of performing everything, and his
wish that loveliest things should be a background for that lady.</p>

<p>Alas for him! Those great jars of perfume, orchids and hyacinths
and roses, almost shut her away from his vision. We were at a
small round table, and she directly in opposition to him. Upon
her right was Antonio, and my heart grew cold to see how she listened
to him.</p>

<p>For Antonio could talk. At that time he spoke English even better
than I, though without some knowledge of the North-American idiom
which my travels with Poor Jr. had given me. He was one of those
splendid egoists who seem to talk in modesty, to keep themselves
behind scenes, yet who, when the curtain falls, are discovered
to be the heroes, after all, though shown in so delicate a fashion
that the audience flatters itself in the discovery.</p>

<p>And how practical was this fellow, how many years he had been
developing his fascinations! I was the only person of that small
company who could have a suspicion that his moustache was dyed,
that his hair was toupee, or that hints of his real age were scorpions
and adders to him. I should not have thought it, if I had not
known it. Here was my advantage: I had known his monstrous vanity
all my life.</p>

<p>So he talked of himself in his various surreptitious ways until
coffee came, Miss Landry listening eagerly, and my poor friend
making no effort; for what were his quiet United States absurdities
compared to the whole-world gaieties and Abyssinian adventures
of this Othello, particularly for a young girl to whom Antonio's
type was unfamiliar? For the first time I saw my young man's brave
front desert him. His mouth drooped, and his eyes had an appearance
of having gazed long at a bright light. I saw that he, unhappy
one, was at last too sure what her answer would be.</p>

<p>For myself, I said very little &mdash;I waited. I hoped and believed
Antonio would attack me in his clever, disguised way, for he had
always hated me and my dead brother, and he had never failed to
prove himself too skilful for us. In my expectancy of his assault
there was no mistake. I comprehended Antonio very well, and I
knew that he feared I might seek to do him an injury, particularly
after my inspired speech and gesture upon the terrace. Also, I
felt that he would, if possible, anticipate my attempt and strike
first. I was willing; for I thought myself in possession of his
vulnerable point&mdash;never dreaming that he might know my own!</p>

<p>At last when he, with the coffee and cigarettes, took the knife
in his hand, he placed a veil over the point. He began, laughingly,
with the picture of a pickpocket he had helped to catch in London.
London was greatly inhabited by pickpockets, according to Antonio's
declaration. Yet, he continued, it was nothing in comparison to
Paris. Paris was the rendezvous, the world's home, for the criminals,
adventurers, and rascals if the world, English, Spanish, South-Americans,
North-Americans,&mdash;and even Italians! One must beware of people
one had met in Paris!</p>

<p>"Of course," he concluded, with a most amiable smile, "there
are many good people there also. That is not to be forgotten.
If I should dare to make a risk on such a trifle, for instance,
I would lay wager that you"&mdash;he nodded toward Poor Jr.&mdash;"made
the acquaintance of Ansolini in Paris?"</p>

<p>This was of the greatest ugliness in its underneath significance,
though the manner was disarming. Antonio's smile was so cheerful,
his eye-glass so twinkling, that none of them could have been
sure he truly meant anything harmful of me, though Poor Jr. looked
up, puzzled and frowning.</p>

<p>Before he could answer I pulled myself altogether, as they say,
and leaned forward, resting my elbows upon the table. "It is true,"
and I tried to smile as amiably as Antonio. "These coincidences
occur. You meet all the great frauds of the world in Paris. Was
it not there" &mdash;I turned to Mrs. Landry&mdash;"that you met the
young Prince here?"</p>

<p>At this there was no mistaking that the others perceived. The
secret battle had begun and was not secret. I saw a wild gleam
in Poor Jr.'s eyes, as if he comprehended that strange things
were to come; but, ah, the face of distress and wonder upon Mrs.
Landry, who beheld the peace of both a Prince and a dinner assailed;
and, alas! the strange and hurt surprise that came from the lady
of the pongee! Let me not be a boastful fellow, but I had borne
her pity and had adored it &mdash;I could face her wonder, even
her scorn.</p>

<p>It was in the flash of her look that I saw my great chance and
what I must try to do. Knowing Antonio, it was as if I saw her
falling into the deep water and caught just one contemptuous glance
from her before the waves hid her. But how much juster should
that contempt have been if I had not tried to save her!</p>

<p>As for that old Antonio, he might have known enough to beware.
I had been timid with him always, and he counted on it now, but
a man who has shown a painted head-top to the people of Paris
will dare a great deal.</p>

<p>"As the Prince says," replied Mrs. Landry, with many flutters,
"one meets only the most agreeable people in Paris!"</p>

<p>"Paris!" I exclaimed. "Ah, that home of ingenuity! How they paint
there! How they live, and how they dye&mdash;their beards!"</p>

<p>You see how the poor Ansolini played the buffoon. I knew they
feared it was wine, I had been so silent until now; but I did
not care, I was beyond care.</p>

<p>"Our young Prince speaks truly," I cried, raising my voice. "He
is wise beyond his years, this youth! He will be great when he
reaches middle age, for he knows Paris and understands North America!
Like myself, he is grateful that the people of your continent
enrich our own! We need all that you can give us! Where should
we be&mdash;any of us" (I raised my voice still louder and waved my
hand to Antonio),&mdash;"where should we be, either of us" (and I bowed
to the others) "without you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Landry rose with precipitousness, and the beautiful lady,
very red, followed. Antonio, unmistakably stung with the scorpions
I had set upon him, sprang to the door, the palest yellow man
I have ever beheld, and let the ladies pass before him.</p>

<p>The next moment I was left alone with Poor Jr. and his hyacinth
trees.</p>
