<p>He remembered now what he had been too hurried to remember earlier.
He had worn these clothes on the previous Saturday, and, returning
from a glorified walk with Miss Pratt, he had demonstrated a fact
to which his near-demolition of the wafers, this afternoon, was
additional testimony. This fact, roughly stated, is that a person
of seventeen, in love, is liable to sit down anywhere. William
had dreamily seated himself upon a tabouret in the library, without
noticing that Jane had left her open paint-box there. Jane had
just been painting sunsets; naturally all the little blocks of
color were wet, and the effect upon William's pale-gray trousers
was marvelous&mdash;far beyond the capacity of his coat to conceal.
Collar-buttons and children's paint-boxes&mdash;those are the trolls
that lie in wait!</p>

<p>The gray clothes and the flannel trousers had been destined for
the professional cleaner, and William, rousing himself from a
brief stupor, made a piteous effort to substitute himself for
that expert so far as the gray trousers were concerned. He divested
himself of them and brought water, towels, bath-soap, and a rubber
bath-sponge to the bright light of his window; and; there, with
touching courage and persistence, he tried to scrub the paint
out of the cloth. He obtained cloud studies and marines which
would have interested a Post-Impressionist, but upon trousers
they seemed out of place.</p>

<p>There came one seeking and calling him again; raps sounded upon
the door, which he had not forgotten to lock.</p>

<p>"Willie," said a serious voice, "mamma wants to know what in
mercy's name is the matter! She wants to know if you know for
mercy's name what time it is! She wants to know what in mercy's
name you think they're all goin' to think! She says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"G'<em>WAY</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, she said I had to find out what in mercy's name you're
doin', Willie."</p>

<p>"You tell her," he shouted, hoarsely&mdash;"tell her I'm playin' dominoes!
What's she <em>THINK I'</em>m doin'?"</p>

<p>"I guess" &mdash;Jane paused, evidently to complete the swallowing
of something&mdash;"I guess she thinks you're goin' crazy. I don't
like Miss Pratt, but she lets me play with that little dog. It's
name's Flopit!"</p>

<p>"You go 'way from that door and stop bothering me," said William.
"I got enough on my mind!"</p>

<p>"Mamma looks at Miss Pratt," Jane remarked. "Miss Pratt puts
cakes in that Mr. Bullitt's mouth and Johnnie Watson's mouth,
too. She's awful."</p>

<p>William made it plain that these bulletins from the party found
no favor with him. He bellowed, "If you don't get away from that
<em>DOOR</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jane was interested in the conversation, but felt that it would
be better to return to the refreshment-table. There she made use
of her own conception of a whisper to place before her mother
a report which was considered interesting and even curious by
every one present; though, such was the courtesy of the little
assembly, there was a general pretense of not hearing.</p>

<p>"I told him," thus whispered Jane, "an' he said, 'You g'way from
that door or I'll do somep'm'&mdash;he didn't say what, mamma. He said,
'What you think I'm doin'? I'm playin' dominoes.' He didn't mean
he <em>WAS </em>playin' dominoes, mamma. He just said he was.
I think maybe he was just lookin' in the lookin'-glass some more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter was becoming embarrassed. She resolved to go to William's
room herself at the first opportunity; but for some time her conscientiousness
as a hostess continued to occupy her at the table, and then, when
she would have gone, Miss Pratt detained her by a roguish appeal
to make Mr. Bullitt and Mr. Watson behave. Both refused all nourishment
except such as was placed in their mouths by the delicate hand
of one of the Noblest, and the latter said that really she wanted
to eat a little tweetie now and then herself, and not to spend
her whole time feeding the Men. For Miss Pratt had the same playfulness
with older people that she had with those of her own age; and
she elaborated her pretended quarrel with the two young gentlemen,
taking others of the dazzled company into her confidence about
it, and insisting upon "Mamma Batster's" acting formally as judge
to settle the difficulty. However, having thus arranged matters,
Miss Pratt did not resign the center of interest, but herself
proposed a compromise: she would continue to feed Mr. Bullitt
and Mr. Watson "every other tweetie"&mdash;that is, each must agree
to eat a cake "all by him own self," after every cake fed to him.
So the comedietta went on, to the running accompaniment of laughter,
with Mr. Bullitt and Mr. Watson swept by such gusts of adoration
they were like to perish where they sat. But Mrs. Baxter's smiling
approval was beginning to be painful to the muscles of her face,
for it was hypocritical. And if William had known her thoughts
about one of the Noblest, he could only have attributed them to
that demon of groundless prejudice which besets all females, but
most particularly and outrageously the mothers and sisters of
Men.</p>

<p>A colored serving-maid entered with a laden tray, and, having
disposed of its freight of bon-bons among the guests, spoke to
Mrs. Baxter in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Could you manage step in the back hall a minute, please, ma'am?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter managed and, having closed the door upon the laughing
voices, asked, quickly&mdash;"What is it, Adelia? Have you seen Mr.
William? Do you know why he doesn't come down?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Adelia. "He gone mighty near out his head, Miz
Baxter."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. He come floppin' down the back stairs in his baf-robe
li'l' while ago. He jes' gone up again. He 'ain't got no britches,
Miz Baxter."</p>

<p>"No <em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Adelia. "He 'ain't got no britches at all."</p>

<p>A statement of this kind is startling under Almost any circumstances,
and it is unusually so when made in reference to a person for
whom a party is being given. Therefore it was not unreasonable
of Mrs. Baxter to lose her breath.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it can't BE!" she gasped. "He has! He has plenty!"</p>

<p>"No'm, he 'ain't," Adelia assured her. "An' he's carryin' on
so I don't scarcely think he knows much what he's doin', Miz Baxter.
He brung down some gray britches to the kitchen to see if I couldn'
press an' clean 'em right quick: they was the ones Miss Jane,
when she's paintin' all them sunsets, lef' her paint-box open,
an' one them sunsets got on these here gray britches, Miz Baxter;
an' hones'ly, Miz Baxter, he's fixed 'em in a condishum, tryin'
to git that paint out, I don't believe it 'll be no use sendin'
'em to the cleaner. 'Clean 'em an' press 'em <em>QUICK?' I </em>says.
'I couldn' clean 'em by Resurreckshum, let alone pressin' 'em!'
No'm! Well, he had his blue britches, too, but they's so ripped
an' tore an' kind o' shredded away in one place, the cook she
jes' hollered when he spread 'em out, an' he didn' even ast me
could I mend 'em. An' he had two pairs o' them white flannen britches,
but hones'ly, Miz Baxter, I don't scarcely think Genesis would
wear 'em, the way they is now! 'Well,' I says, 'ain't but one
thing lef' to do <em>I</em> can see,' I says. 'Why don't you go
put on that nice black suit you had las' winter?'"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Mrs. Baxter cried. "I'll go and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Adelia. "You don' need to. He's up in the attic
now, r'arin' roun' 'mongs' them trunks, but seem to me like I
remember you put that suit away under the heavy blankets in that
big cedar ches' with the padlock. If you jes' tell me where is
the key, I take it up to him."</p>

<p>"Under the bureau in the spare room," said Mrs. Baxter. "<em>HURRY</em>!"</p>

<p>Adelia hurried; and, fifteen minutes later, William, for the
last time that afternoon, surveyed himself in his mirror. His
face showed the strain that had been upon him and under which
he still labored; the black suit was a map of creases, and William
was perspiring more freely than ever under the heavy garments.
But at least he was clothed.</p>

<p>He emptied his pockets, disgorging upon the floor a multitude
of small white spheres, like marbles. Then, as he stepped out
into the hall, he discovered that their odor still remained about
him; so he stopped and carefully turned his pockets inside out,
one after the other, but finding that he still smelled vehemently
of the "moth-balls," though not one remained upon him, he went
to his mother's room and sprinkled violet toilet-water upon his
chest and shoulders. He disliked such odors, but that left by
the moth-balls was intolerable, and, laying hands upon a canister
labeled "Hyacinth," he contrived to pour a quantity of scented
powder inside his collar, thence to be distributed by the force
of gravity so far as his dampness permitted.</p>

<p>Lo, William was now ready to go to his party! Moist, wilted,
smelling indeed strangely, he was ready.</p>

<p>But when he reached the foot of the stairs he discovered that
there was one thing more to be done. Indignation seized him, and
also a creeping fear chilled his spine, as he beheld a lurking
shape upon the porch, stealthily moving toward the open door.
It was the lowly Clematis, dog unto Genesis.</p>

<p>William instantly divined the purpose of Clematis. It was debatable
whether Clematis had remained upon the premises after the departure
of Genesis, or had lately returned thither upon some errand of
his own, but one thing was certain, and the manner of Clematis&mdash;his
attitude, his every look, his every gesture&mdash;made it as clear
as day. Clematis had discovered, by one means or another, the
presence of Flopit in the house, and had determined to see him
personally.</p>

<p>Clematis wore his most misleading expression; a stranger would
have thought him shy and easily turned from his purpose&mdash;but William
was not deceived. He knew that if Clematis meant to see Flopit,
a strong will, a ready brain, and stern action were needed to
thwart him; but at all costs that meeting must be prevented. Things
had been awful enough, without that!</p>

<p>He was well aware that Clematis could not be driven away, except
temporarily, for nothing was further fixed upon Clematis than
his habit of retiring under pressure, only to return and return
again. True, the door could have been shut in the intruder's face,
but he would have sought other entrance with possible success,
or, failing that, would have awaited in the front yard the dispersal
of the guests and Flopit's consequent emerging. This was a contretemps
not to be endured.</p>

<p>The door of the living-room was closed, muffling festal noises
and permitting safe passage through the hall. William cast a hunted
look over his shoulder; then he approached Clematis.</p>

<p>"Good ole doggie," he said, huskily. "Hyuh, Clem! Hyuh, Clem!"</p>

<p>Clematis moved sidelong, retreating with his head low and his
tail denoting anxious thoughts.</p>

<p>"Hyuh, Clem!" said William, trying, with only fair success, to
keep his voice from sounding venomous. "Hyuh, Clem!"</p>

<p>Clematis continued his deprecatory retreat.</p>

<p>Thereupon William essayed a ruse&mdash;he pretended to nibble at something,
and then extended his hand as if it held forth a gift of food.
"Look, Clem," he said. "Yum-yum! Meat, Clem! Good meat!"</p>

<p>For once Clematis was half credulous. He did not advance, but
he elongated himself to investigate the extended hand, and the
next instant found himself seized viciously by the scruff of the
neck. He submitted to capture in absolute silence. Only the slightest
change of countenance betrayed his mortification at having been
found so easy a gull; this passed, and a look of resolute stoicism
took its place.</p>

<p>He refused to walk, but offered merely nominal resistance, as
a formal protest which he wished to be of record, though perfectly
understanding that it availed nothing at present. William dragged
him through the long hall and down a short passageway to the cellar
door. This he opened, thrust Clematis upon the other side of it,
closed and bolted it.</p>

<p>Immediately a stentorian howl raised blood-curdling echoes and
resounded horribly through the house. It was obvious that Clematis
intended to make a scene, whether he was present at it or not.
He lifted his voice in sonorous dolor, stating that he did not
like the cellar and would continue thus to protest as long as
he was left in it alone. He added that he was anxious to see Flopit
and considered it an unexampled outrage that he was withheld from
the opportunity.</p>

<p>Smitten with horror, William reopened the door and charged down
the cellar stairs after Clematis, who closed his caitiff mouth
and gave way precipitately. He fled from one end of the cellar
to the other and back, while William pursued; choking, and calling
in low, ferocious tones: "Good doggie! Good ole doggie! Hyuh,
Clem! Meat, Clem, meat&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was dodging through coal-bins; there was squirming between
barrels; there was high jumping and broad jumping, and there was
a final aspiring but baffled dash for the top of the cellar stairs,
where the door, forgotten by William, stood open. But it was here
that Clematis, after a long and admirable exhibition of ingenuity,
no less than agility, submitted to capture. That is to say, finding
himself hopelessly pinioned, he resumed the stoic.</p>

<p>Grimly the panting and dripping William dragged him through the
kitchen, where the cook cried out unintelligibly, seeming to summon
Adelia, who was not present. Through the back yard went captor
and prisoner, the latter now maintaining a seated posture&mdash;his
pathetic conception of dignity under duress. Finally, into a small
shed or tool-house, behind Mrs. Baxter's flower-beds, went Clematis
in a hurried and spasmodic manner. The instant the door slammed
he lifted his voice&mdash;and was bidden to use it now as much as he
liked.</p>

<p>Adelia, with a tray of used plates, encountered the son of the
house as he passed through the kitchen on his return, and her
eyes were those of one who looks upon miracles.</p>

<p>William halted fiercely.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded. "Is my face dirty?"</p>

<p>"You mean, are it too dirty to go in yonduh to the party?" Adelia
asked, slowly. "No, suh; you look all right to go in there. You
lookin' jes' fine to go in there now, Mist' Willie!"</p>

<p>Something in her tone struck him as peculiar, even as ominous,
but his blood was up&mdash;he would not turn back now. He strode into
the hall and opened the door of the "living-room."</p>

<p>Jane was sitting on the floor, busily painting sunsets in a large
blank-book which she had obtained for that exclusive purpose.</p>

<p>She looked up brightly as William appeared in the doorway, and
in answer to his wild gaze she said:</p>

<p>"I got a little bit sick, so mamma told me to keep quiet a while.
She's lookin' for you all over the house. She told papa she don't
know what in mercy's name people are goin' to think about you,
Willie."</p>

<p>The distraught youth strode to her. "The party&mdash;" he choked.
"<em>WHERE</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They all stayed pretty long," said Jane, "but the last ones
said they had to go home to their dinners when papa came, a little
while ago. Johnnie Watson was carryin' Flopit for that Miss Pratt."</p>

<p>William dropped into the chair beside which Jane had established
herself upon the floor. Then he uttered a terrible cry and rose.</p>

<p>Again Jane had painted a sunset she had not intended.</p>
