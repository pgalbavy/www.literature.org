<p>From the battlements nothing further was observed. The sun journeyed
westward, and at last went down; but, to the eyes of all these eager
sentinels, no living thing appeared in the neighbourhood of Tunstall
House.
</p><p>When the night was at length fairly come, Throgmorton was led to a room
overlooking an angle of the moat. Thence he was lowered with every
precaution; the ripple of his swimming was audible for a brief period;
then a black figure was observed to land by the branches of a willow and
crawl away among the grass. For some half-hour Sir Daniel and Hatch
stood eagerly giving ear; but all remained quiet. The messenger had got
away in safety.
</p><p>Sir Daniel's brow grew clearer. He turned to Hatch.
</p><p>"Bennet," he said, "this John Amend-All is no more than a man, ye see.
He sleepeth. We will make a good end of him, go to!"
</p><p>All the afternoon and evening, Dick had been ordered hither and thither,
one command following another, till he was bewildered with the number
and the hurry of commissions. All that time he had seen no more of Sir
Oliver, and nothing of Matcham; and yet both the priest and the young
lad ran continually in his mind. It was now his chief purpose to escape
from Tunstall Moat House as speedily as might be; and yet, before he
went, he desired a word with both of these.
</p><p>At length, with a lamp in one hand, he mounted to his new apartment. It
was large, low, and somewhat dark. The window looked upon the moat, and
although it was so high up, it was heavily barred. The bed was
luxurious, with one pillow of down and one of lavender, and a red
coverlet worked in a pattern of roses. All about the walls were
cupboards, locked and padlocked, and concealed from view by hangings of
dark-coloured arras. Dick made the round, lifting the arras, sounding
the panels, seeking vainly to open the cupboards. He assured himself
that the door was strong and the bolt solid; then he set down his lamp
upon a bracket, and once more looked all around.
</p><p>For what reason had he been given this chamber? It was larger and finer
than his own. Could it conceal a snare? Was there a secret entrance? Was
it, indeed, haunted? His blood ran a little chilly in his veins.
</p><p>Immediately over him the heavy foot of a sentry trod the leads. Below
him, he knew, was the arched roof of the chapel; and next to the chapel
was the hall. Certainly there was a secret passage in the hall; the eye
that had watched him from the arras gave him proof of that. Was it not
more than probable that the passage extended to the chapel, and, if so,
that it had an opening in his room?
</p><p>To sleep in such a place, he felt, would be foolhardy. He made his
weapons ready, and took his position in a corner of the room behind the
door. If ill was intended, he would sell his life dear.
</p><p>The sound of many feet, the challenge, and the password sounded overhead
along the battlements; the watch was being changed.
</p><p>And just then there came a scratching at the door of the chamber; it
grew a little louder; then a whisper:
</p><p>"Dick, Dick, it is I!"
</p><p>Dick ran to the door, drew the bolt, and admitted Matcham. He was very
pale, and carried a lamp in one hand and a drawn dagger in the other.
</p><p>"Shut me the door," he whispered. "Swift, Dick! This house is full of
spies; I hear their feet follow me in the corridors; I hear them breathe
behind the arras."
</p><p>"Well, content you," returned Dick, "it is closed. We are safe for this
while, if there be safety anywhere within these walls. But my heart is
glad to see you. By the mass, lad, I thought ye were sped! Where hid
ye?"
</p><p>"It matters not," returned Matcham. "Since we be met, it matters not.
But, Dick, are your eyes open? Have they told you of to-morrow's
doings?"
</p><p>"Not they," replied Dick. "What make they to-morrow?"
</p><p>"To-morrow, or to-night, I know not," said the other, "but one time or
other, Dick, they do intend upon your life. I had the proof of it; I
have heard them whisper; nay, they as good as told me."
</p><p>"Ay," returned Dick, "is it so? I had thought as much."
</p><p>And he told him the day's occurrences at length.
</p><p>When it was done, Matcham arose and began, in turn, to examine the
apartment.
</p><p>"No," he said, "there is no entrance visible. Yet 'tis a pure certainty
there is one. Dick, I will stay by you. An y'are to die, I will die with
you. And I can help--look! I have stolen a dagger--I will do my best!
And meanwhile, an ye know of any issue, any sally-port we could get
opened, or any window that we might descend by, I will most joyfully
face any jeopardy to flee with you."
</p><p>"Jack," said Dick, "by the mass, Jack, y'are the best soul, and the
truest, and the bravest in all England! Give me your hand, Jack."
</p><p>And he grasped the other's hand in silence.
</p><p>"I will tell you," he resumed. "There is a window, out of which the
messenger descended; the rope should still be in the chamber. 'Tis a
hope."
</p><p>"Hist!" said Matcham.
</p><p>Both gave ear. There was a sound below the floor; then it paused, and
then began again.
</p><p>"Some one walketh in the room below," whispered Matcham.
</p><p>"Nay," returned Dick, "there is no room below; we are above the chapel.
It is my murderer in the secret passage. Well, let him come; it shall go
hard with him"; and he ground his teeth.
</p><p>"Blow me the lights out," said the other. "Perchance he will betray
himself."
</p><p>They blew out both the lamps and lay still as death. The footfalls
underneath were very soft, but they were clearly audible. Several times
they came and went; and then there was a loud jar of a key turning in a
lock, followed by a considerable silence.
</p><p>Presently the steps began again, and then, all of a sudden, a chink of
light appeared in the planking of the room in a far corner. It widened;
a trap-door was being opened, letting in a gush of light. They could see
the strong hand pushing it up; and Dick raised his cross-bow, waiting
for the head to follow.
</p><p>But now there came an interruption. From a distant corner of the Moat
House shouts began to be heard, and first one voice, and then several,
crying aloud upon a name. This noise had plainly disconcerted the
murderer, for the trap-door was silently lowered to its place, and the
steps hurriedly returned, passed once more close below the lads, and
died away in the distance.
</p><p>Here was a moment's respite. Dick breathed deep, and then, and not till
then, he gave ear to the disturbance which had interrupted the attack,
and which was now rather increasing than diminishing. All about the Moat
House feet were running, doors were opening and slamming, and still the
voice of Sir Daniel towered above all this bustle, shouting for
"Joanna."
</p><p>"Joanna!" repeated Dick. "Why, who the murrain should this be? Here is
no Joanna, nor ever hath been. What meaneth it?"
</p><p>Matcham was silent. He seemed to have drawn further away. But only a
little faint starlight entered by the window, and at the far end of the
apartment, where the pair were, the darkness was complete.
</p><p>"Jack," said Dick, "I wot not where ye were all day. Saw ye this
Joanna?"
</p><p>"Nay," returned Matcham, "I saw her not."
</p><p>"Nor heard tell of her?" he pursued.
</p><p>The steps drew nearer. Sir Daniel was still roaring the name of Joanna
from the courtyard.
</p><p>"Did ye hear of her?" repeated Dick.
</p><p>"I heard of her," said Matcham.
</p><p>"How your voice twitters! What aileth you?" said Dick. "'Tis a most
excellent good fortune, this Joanna; it will take their minds from us."
</p><p>"Dick," cried Matcham, "I am lost; we are both lost. Let us flee if
there be yet time. They will not rest till they have found me. Or, see!
let me go forth; when they have found me, ye may flee. Let me forth,
Dick--good Dick, let me away!"
</p><p>She was groping for the bolt, when Dick at last comprehended.
</p><p>"By the mass!" he cried, "y'are no Jack; y'are Joanna Sedley; y'are the
maid that would not marry me!"
</p><p>The girl paused, and stood silent and motionless. Dick, too, was silent
for a little; then he spoke again.
</p><p>"Joanna," he said, "y' 'ave saved my life, and I have saved yours; and
we have seen blood flow, and been friends and enemies--ay, and I took my
belt to thrash you; and all that time I thought ye were a boy. But now
death has me, and my time's out, and before I die I must say this: Y'
are the best maid and the bravest under heaven, and, if only I could
live, I would marry you blithely; and, live or die, I love you."
</p><p>She answered nothing.
</p><p>"Come," he said, "speak up, Jack. Come, be a good maid, and say ye love
me!"
</p><p>"Why, Dick," she cried, "would I be here?"
</p><p>"Well, see ye here," continued Dick, "an we but escape whole we'll
marry; and an we're to die, we die, and there's an end on't. But now
that I think, how found ye my chamber?"
</p><p>"I asked it of Dame Hatch," she answered.
</p><p>"Well, the dame's staunch," he answered; "she'll not tell upon you. We
have time before us."
</p><p>And just then, as if to contradict his words, feet came down the
corridor, and a fist beat roughly on the door.
</p><p>"Here!" cried a voice. "Open, Master Dick; open!"
</p><p>Dick neither moved nor answered.
</p><p>"It is all over," said the girl; and she put her arms about Dick's neck.
</p><p>One after another, men came trooping to the door. Then Sir Daniel
arrived himself, and there was a sudden cessation of the noise.
</p><p>"Dick," cried the knight, "be not an ass. The Seven Sleepers had been
awake ere now. We know she is within there. Open, then, the door, man."
</p><p>Dick was again silent.
</p><p>"Down with it," said Sir Daniel. And immediately his followers fell
savagely upon the door with foot and fist. Solid as it was, and strongly
bolted, it would soon have given way; but once more fortune interfered.
Over the thunder-storm of blows the cry of a sentinel was heard; it was
followed by another; shouts ran along the battlements, shouts answered
out of the wood. In the first moment of alarm it sounded as if the
foresters were carrying the Moat House by assault. And Sir Daniel and
his men, desisting instantly from their attack upon Dick's chamber,
hurried to defend the walls.
</p><p>"Now," cried Dick, "we are saved."
</p><p>He seized the great old bedstead with both hands, and bent himself in
vain to move it.
</p><p>"Help me, Jack. For your life's sake, help me stoutly!" he cried.
</p><p>Between them, with a huge effort, they dragged the big frame of oak
across the room, and thrust it endwise to the chamber door.
</p><p>"Ye do but make things worse," said Joanna, sadly. "He will then enter
by the trap."
</p><p>"Not so," replied Dick. "He durst not tell his secret to so many. It is
by the trap that we shall flee. Hark! The attack is over. Nay, it was
none!"
</p><p>It had, indeed, been no attack; it was the arrival of another party of
stragglers from the defeat of Risingham that had disturbed Sir Daniel.
They had run the gauntlet under cover of the darkness; they had been
admitted by the great gate; and now, with a great stamping of hoofs and
jingle of accoutrements and arms, they were dismounting in the court.
</p><p>"He will return anon," said Dick. "To the trap!"
</p><p>He lighted a lamp, and they went together into the corner of the room.
The open chink through which some light still glittered was easily
discovered, and, taking a stout sword from his small armoury, Dick
thrust it deep into the seam, and weighed strenuously on the hilt. The
trap moved, gaped a little, and at length came widely open. Seizing it
with their hands, the two young folk threw it back. It disclosed a few
steps descending, and at the foot of them, where the would-be murderer
had left it, a burning lamp.
</p><p>"Now," said Dick, "go first and take the lamp. I will follow to close
the trap."
</p><p>So they descended one after the other, and as Dick lowered the trap, the
blows began once again to thunder on the panels of the door.
