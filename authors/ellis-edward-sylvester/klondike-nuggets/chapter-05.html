<p>As Frank Mansley's words rang through the tent they were followed
by the awful roar of the descending avalanche, and all awoke on
the instant. But no one could do anything to save himself. They
could only cower and pray to Heaven to protect them.</p>

<p>Something struck the side of the tent, like the plunge of a mountain
torrent, yet it was not that, nor was it the snow. Tim McCabe
knew its nature, and catching his breath, he called:</p>

<p>"It's the wind of the avalanche! That won't hurt ye!"</p>

<p>The wonder was that it did not blow the canvas like a feather
from its path; but the tent held its position, and the appalling
rush and roar ceased with more suddenness than it had begun. The
throbbing air became still.</p>

<p>Jeff Graham, who had not spoken, struck a match, and holding
it above his head, peered around the interior of the tent, which
he observed had sagged a good deal from the impact of the avalanche's
breath, though the stakes held their places in the snow. He saw
Frank Mansley standing pale with affright, while Roswell, sitting
on the edge of his couch, was equally startled. Ike Hardman had
covered his face with his blanket, like a child, who thus seeks
to escape an impending danger. Incredible as it may seem, Tim
McCabe was filling his pipe in the gloom, preparatory to a smoke.</p>

<p>"Be aisy," was his comment, as he struck a match and held it
above the bowl; "we're as safe as if in 'Frisco, and a little
safer, for it's whin ye are there ye are liable to have an airthquake
tumble the buildings about yer hid."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that an avalanche?" asked the amazed Frank.</p>

<p>"It was that, but it didn't hit us. If we had put up the tint
a little beyant and further to the right, we'd've been mashed
flat."</p>

<p>He spoke the truth. The enormous mass of snow, weighing thousands
of tons, had toppled over and slid down the mountain-side with
a roar like Niagara, but stopped short, just before reaching the
tent. Some of the feathery particles sailed forward and struck
the canvas, the greatest effect being produced by the wind, but
the monster was palsied before he could reach forward and seize
his victims.</p>

<p>When the situation became clear, every one uttered expressions
of gratitude, but the boys were not relieved of all fear. What
had taken place might occur again.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," was Tim's reassuring reply. "I've obsarved
the things before, and we shan't be bothered agin to-night. Take
me advice and go to sleep, which the same is what I shall do mesilf
as soon as I finishes me smoke."</p>

<p>The shock, however, had been too great for all to compose their
nerves at once. Jeff was the first to succumb, having faith in
the assurance of his friend, and Ike Hardman soon followed him
in the land of dreams. Frank and Roswell lay for a long time talking
in low tones, but finally drowsiness overcame them, and with the
pungent odor of Tim's pipe in their nostrils they sank into slumber,
which was not broken until Jeff called to them that breakfast
was waiting.</p>

<p>The melted snow furnished what water they needed to drink and
in which to lave their faces and hands. Then, before eating, they
hurried outside the tent to survey the snowy mountain that had
come so near swallowing them up. They were filled with amazement
when they looked upon the vast pile, amid which were observed
many chunks and masses of ice, several that must have weighed
hundreds of pounds, lying on the snow within a few yards of the
tent. Had one of these been precipitated against the shelter,
it would have crushed the inmates, like the charge from the most
enormous of our seacoast guns. It was a providential escape, indeed,
for our friends, and it was no wonder that they continued to discuss
it and to express their gratitude to Heaven, that had mercifully
shielded them while they slept.</p>

<p>Standing at Sheep Camp, they saw the summit towering thirty-five
hundred feet in front, though Chilkoot Pass, which they were to
follow, is five hundred feet lower. The task of climbing to the
summit of this pass is of the most trying nature conceivable,
and many gold-seekers have turned back in despair. Terrific weather
is often encountered, and men have been held in camp for weeks,
during which the crest of the mountains was hidden by clouds and
tempests, and the whirling snow and sleet were so blinding that
they hardly ventured to peep out from their tent. The weather
was such as has baffled the most intrepid of explorers for centuries
in their search for the North Pole.</p>

<p>Our friends were unusually fortunate in being favored with good
weather, there being hardly any wind stirring, while, more wonderful
than all, the sun shone from an unclouded sky, in a section where
the clear days average less than seventy degrees in the course
of the entire year.</p>

<p>No one who has ever climbed Chilkoot Pass will forget it. Some,
alas! who have made the attempt never succeeded in reaching the
other side, but perished in the frightful region; while many more
have become disheartened by the perils and difficulties and turned
back when on the threshold of the modern El Dorado. At the foot
of the pass our friends met two men, bending low with the packs
strapped to their shoulders, and plodding wearily southward. Tim
called to them to know what the trouble was, and received a glum
answer, accompanied by an oath that they had had enough of such
a country, and if they ever lived to reach New York, they would
shoot any man who pronounced the word "Klondike" in their presence.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact regarding this famous pass that the snow
with which it is choked is what makes it possible for travel.
The snow sometimes lies to the depth of fifty or sixty feet, and
from February, through May, and often June, its smooth surface
allows one to walk over it without trouble. Should it be fine
and yielding, the snow-shoes come into play, but when the crust
is hard, no better support could be asked. The trouble lies in
the steep incline, which becomes more decided the higher one climbs.</p>

<p>Underneath this enormous mass rush violent torrents of water,
which, hollowing out passages for themselves, leave the snow white
arches far above, over which one walks upon a natural bridge.
Later in the season, when the effects of the warm weather are
felt, these arches begin to tumble in, and the incautious traveller
who misses his footing and drops into one of the huge crevices
is lost.</p>

<p>As has been said, the steepness increases as one approaches the
top, the last five hundred feet being like the roof of a house.
Bending forward under their loads, our friends often found their
noses within a few inches of the snow, while masses of rock protruding
in many places added to the difficulties of travel. The combined
strength of the party was required to get a single sled to the
top. While one was left behind, they joined in pushing and pulling
the other, with frequent pauses for rest, until, after hours of
the hardest work conceivable, they succeeded in reaching the summit.
Then, resting again, they began their descent for the other sled.
It was fortunate that the crust of the snow removed the need of
using the long snow-shoes, whose make suggests the bats used in
playing tennis, for the men were the only ones who knew how to
handle the awkward contrivances, which would have proved a sore
perplexity for Roswell and Frank.</p>

<p>Under some circumstances it becomes a question which is the harder,
to descend or ascend a steep hill. Despite the utmost care, the
whole five stumbled several times. Roswell felt the chills run
through him, and he held his breath in dismay when he saw himself
sliding toward the edge of a ravine, over which if he fell he
would have been dashed to death on the instant. While desperately
trying to check himself, he shouted for help, but it looked equally
fatal for any one to venture near him, since the slope was so
abrupt that he could not check himself.</p>

<p>Jeff Graham was carrying the coil of rope which he had loosened
from the first sled, and, seeing the peril of his young friend,
he flung the end toward him with the skill of a Mexican or cowboy
in throwing the <em>rita</em>, or lasso. The youth was slipping
downward on his face, with his terrified countenance turned appealingly
to his friends, while he tried, by jamming his toes and clutching
at the surface, to check himself, and Frank was on the point of
going to his help when the end of the rope struck his shoulder
and he seized it with both hands. The next minute he was drawn
back to safety.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised wid ye," remarked Tim McCabe, when the panting
youth stood among them again. "I thought ye were too tired to
indulge in any such foolin'. Whin ye want to slide down hill,
make use of the slid instead of your stummick."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll want to do any more sliding down hill in
this part of the world," replied the frightened, but grateful
youth.</p>

<p>Once more they bent to their work, and pulling themselves together,
succeeded at last in reaching the summit with the second sled,
the whole party utterly used up. Even Jeff Graham sat down on
one of the loads, panting and too tired to speak. When he found
voice, he said:</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>ALL JOINED IN PUSHING AND PULLING ONE SLED</em>.]</p>

<p>"What fools we are! And yet if I went back to 'Frisco, I'd start
agin for the Klondike the next day; so I reckon we'll keep on."</p>

<p>No one responded, for they were so wearied that talking itself
was labor.</p>

<p>Looking to the southwest, they could see the blue shimmer of
the Pacific, where the Gulf of Alaska rolls its white surges against
the dismal shores. Far in the distance a faint line against the
sky showed where a steamer was probably ploughing its way to St.
Michael's, with hundreds of gold-seekers on board, the van of
the army that is pushing toward the Klondike from the West, the
South, and the East, until it would seem that even that immense
region must overflow with the innumerable multitudes, drawn thither
by the most resistless magnet that can make men brave peril, suffering,
and death.</p>

<p>Turning in the opposite direction, they saw the mountain slope
melting away in the great valley of the Yukon, with the trail
leading through a narrow, rocky gap, and with naked granite rocks
rising steeply to the partly snow-clad mountains. The party had
been fortunate in completing the ascent in less than a day, when
it often requires twice as long. The first half mile of the descent
was steep, when the slope becomes more gradual. The glare of the
snow compelled all to use their glasses, and seven miles from
the summit they reached the edge of timber, where camp was made.</p>

<p>Freed from all fear of descending avalanches, with plenty of
food and wood for fuel, the exhausted gold-hunters lay down on
their blankets, resting upon more hemlock boughs, and enjoyed
the most refreshing sleep since leaving the steamer at Juneau.
It was not until considerably after daylight that Jeff awoke and
started a new fire, with which to prepare their breakfast, and
when that was ready the boys were roused from slumber.</p>

<p>They were now within three miles of Lake Lindeman, a body of
water five miles in length, and the journey was speedily made.
It was on the shore of this lake that the party expected to build
a raft or boat with which to make the long, rough voyage to the
Yukon, but, to their pleased surprise, they found an old Indian,
with a broad scow, anxious to transport them and their luggage
to the foot of the lake. He had already secured three men and
their outfits, but was able to carry the new arrivals, and Jeff
was not long in making a bargain with him.</p>
