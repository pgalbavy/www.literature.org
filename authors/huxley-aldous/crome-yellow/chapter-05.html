<p>Mr. Wimbush had taken them to see the sights of the Home Farm,
and now they were standing, all six of them &mdash;Henry Wimbush,
Mr. Scogan, Denis, Gombauld, Anne, and Mary&mdash;by the low wall of
the piggery, looking into one of the styes.</p>

<p>"This is a good sow," said Henry Wimbush. "She had a litter of
fourteen.</p>

<p>"Fourteen?" Mary echoed incredulously. She turned astonished
blue eyes towards Mr. Wimbush, then let them fall onto the seething
mass of elan vital that fermented in the sty.</p>

<p>An immense sow reposed on her side in the middle of the pen.
Her round, black belly, fringed with a double line of dugs, presented
itself to the assault of an army of small, brownish-black swine.
With a frantic greed they tugged at their mother’s flank. The
old sow stirred sometimes uneasily or uttered a little grunt of
pain. One small pig, the runt, the weakling of the litter, had
been unable to secure a place at the banquet. Squealing shrilly,
he ran backwards and forwards, trying to push in among his stronger
brothers or even to climb over their tight little black backs
towards the maternal reservoir.</p>

<p>"There <em>ARE </em>fourteen," said Mary. "You’re quite right.
I counted. It’s extraordinary."</p>

<p>"The sow next door," Mr. Wimbush went on, "has done very badly.
She only had five in her litter. I shall give her another chance.
If she does no better next time, I shall fat her up and kill her.
There’s the boar,"  he pointed towards a farther sty. "Fine old
beast, isn’t he? But he’s getting past his prime. He’ll have to
go too."</p>

<p>"How cruel!" Anne exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But how practical, how eminently realistic!" said Mr. Scogan.
"In this farm we have a model of sound paternal government. Make
them breed, make them work, and when they’re past working or breeding
or begetting, slaughter them."</p>

<p>"Farming seems to be mostly indecency and cruelty," said Anne.</p>

<p>With the ferrule of his walking-stick Denis began to scratch
the boar’s long bristly back. The animal moved a little so as
to bring himself within easier range of the instrument that evoked
in him such delicious sensations; then he stood stock still, softly
grunting his contentment. The mud of years flaked off his sides
in a grey powdery scurf.</p>

<p>"What a pleasure it is," said Denis, "to do somebody a kindness.
I believe I enjoy scratching this pig quite as much as he enjoys
being scratched. If only one could always be kind with so little
expense or trouble..."</p>

<p>A gate slammed; there was a sound of heavy footsteps.</p>

<p>"Morning, Rowley!" said Henry Wimbush.</p>

<p>"Morning, sir," old Rowley answered. He was the most venerable
of the labourers on the farm&mdash;a tall, solid man, still unbent,
with grey side-whiskers and a steep, dignified profile. Grave,
weighty in his manner, splendidly respectable, Rowley had the
air of a great English statesman of the mid-nineteenth century.
He halted on the outskirts of the group, and for a moment they
all looked at the pigs in a silence that was only broken by the
sound of grunting or the squelch of a sharp hoof in the mire.
Rowley turned at last, slowly and ponderously and nobly, as he
did everything, and addressed himself to Henry Wimbush.</p>

<p>"Look at them, sir," he said, with a motion of his hand towards
the wallowing swine. "Rightly is they called pigs."</p>

<p>"Rightly indeed," Mr. Wimbush agreed.</p>

<p>"I am abashed by that man," said Mr. Scogan, as old Rowley plodded
off slowly and with dignity. "What wisdom, what judgment, what
a sense of values! ‘Rightly are they called swine.’ Yes. And I
wish I could, with as much justice, say, ‘Rightly are we called
men.’"</p>

<p>They walked on towards the cowsheds and the stables of the cart-horses.
Five white geese, taking the air this fine morning, even as they
were doing, met them in the way. They hesitated, cackled; then,
converting their lifted necks into rigid, horizontal snakes, they
rushed off in disorder, hissing horribly as they went. Red calves
paddled in the dung and mud of a spacious yard. In another enclosure
stood the bull, massive as a locomotive. He was a very calm bull,
and his face wore an expression of melancholy stupidity. He gazed
with reddish-brown eyes at his visitors, chewed thoughtfully at
the tangible memories of an earlier meal, swallowed and regurgitated,
chewed again. His tail lashed savagely from side to side; it seemed
to have nothing to do with his impassive bulk. Between his short
horns was a triangle of red curls, short and dense.</p>

<p>"Splendid animal," said Henry Wimbush. "Pedigree stock. But he’s
getting a little old, like the boar."</p>

<p>"Fat him up and slaughter him," Mr. Scogan pronounced, with a
delicate old-maidish precision of utterance.</p>

<p>"Couldn’t you give the animals a little holiday from producing
children?" asked Anne. "I’m so sorry for the poor things."</p>

<p>Mr. Wimbush shook his head. "Personally," he said, "I rather
like seeing fourteen pigs grow where only one grew before. The
spectacle of so much crude life is refreshing."</p>

<p>"I’m glad to hear you say so," Gombauld broke in warmly. "Lots
of life: that’s what we want. I like pullulation; everything ought
to increase and multiply as hard as it can."</p>

<p>Gombauld grew lyrical. Everybody ought to have children &mdash;Anne
ought to have them, Mary ought to have them&mdash;dozens and dozens.
He emphasised his point by thumping with his walking-stick on
the bull’s leather flanks. Mr. Scogan ought to pass on his intelligence
to little Scogans, and Denis to little Denises. The bull turned
his head to see what was happening, regarded the drumming stick
for several seconds, then turned back again satisfied, it seemed,
that nothing was happening. Sterility was odious, unnatural, a
sin against life. Life, life, and still more life. The ribs of
the placid bull resounded.</p>

<p>Standing with his back against the farmyard pump, a little apart,
Denis examined the group. Gombauld, passionate and vivacious,
was its centre. The others stood round, listening &mdash;Henry
Wimbush, calm and polite beneath his grey bowler; Mary, with parted
lips and eyes that shone with the indignation of a convinced birth-controller.
Anne looked on through half-shut eyes, smiling; and beside her
stood Mr. Scogan, bolt upright in an attitude of metallic rigidity
that contrasted strangely with that fluid grace of hers which
even in stillness suggested a soft movement.</p>

<p>Gombauld ceased talking, and Mary, flushed and outraged, opened
her mouth to refute him. But she was too slow. Before she could
utter a word Mr. Scogan’s fluty voice had pronounced the opening
phrases of a discourse. There was no hope of getting so much as
a word in edgeways; Mary had perforce to resign herself.</p>

<p>"Even your eloquence, my dear Gombauld," he was saying&mdash;"even
your eloquence must prove inadequate to reconvert the world to
a belief in the delights of mere multiplication. With the gramophone,
the cinema, and the automatic pistol, the goddess of Applied Science
has presented the world with another gift, more precious even
than these&mdash;the means of dissociating love from propagation. Eros,
for those who wish it, is now an entirely free god; his deplorable
associations with Lucina may be broken at will. In the course
of the next few centuries, who knows? the world may see a more
complete severance. I look forward to it optimistically. Where
the great Erasmus Darwin and Miss Anna Seward, Swan of Lichfield,
experimented&mdash;and, for all their scientific ardour, failed&mdash;our
descendants will experiment and succeed. An impersonal generation
will take the place of Nature’s hideous system. In vast state
incubators, rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world
with the population it requires. The family system will disappear;
society, sapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations;
and Eros, beautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a
gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world."</p>

<p>"It sounds lovely," said Anne.</p>

<p>"The distant future always does."</p>

<p>Mary’s china blue eyes, more serious and more astonished than
ever, were fixed on Mr. Scogan. "Bottles?" she said. "Do you really
think so? Bottles..."</p>
