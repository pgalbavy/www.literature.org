<p>I sat down in an armchair and felt very sick. That lasted for
maybe five minutes, and was succeeded by a fit of the horrors.
The poor staring white face on the floor was more than I could
bear, and I managed to get a table-cloth and cover it. Then I
staggered to a cupboard, found the brandy and swallowed several
mouthfuls. I had seen men die violently before; indeed I had killed
a few myself in the Matabele War; but this cold-blooded indoor
business was different. Still I managed to pull myself together.
I looked at my watch, and saw that it was half-past ten.</p>

<p>An idea seized me, and I went over the flat with a small-tooth
comb. There was nobody there, nor any trace of anybody, but I
shuttered and bolted all the windows and put the chain on the
door. By this time my wits were coming back to me, and I could
think again. It took me about an hour to figure the thing out,
and I did not hurry, for, unless the murderer came back, I had
till about six o’clock in the morning for my cogitations.</p>

<p>I was in the soup—that was pretty clear. Any shadow of a doubt
I might have had about the truth of Scudder’s tale was now gone.
The proof of it was lying under the table-cloth. The men who knew
that he knew what he knew had found him, and had taken the best
way to make certain of his silence. Yes; but he had been in my
rooms four days, and his enemies must have reckoned that he had
confided in me. So I would be the next to go. It might be that
very night, or next day, or the day after, but my number was up
all right.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I thought of another probability. Supposing I went
out now and called in the police, or went to bed and let Paddock
find the body and call them in the morning. What kind of a story
was I to tell about Scudder? I had lied to Paddock about him,
and the whole thing looked desperately fishy. If I made a clean
breast of it and told the police everything he had told me, they
would simply laugh at me. The odds were a thousand to one that
I would be charged with the murder, and the circumstantial evidence
was strong enough to hang me. Few people knew me in England; I
had no real pal who could come forward and swear to my character.
Perhaps that was what those secret enemies were playing for. They
were clever enough for anything, and an English prison was as
good a way of getting rid of me till after June 15th as a knife
in my chest.</p>

<p>Besides, if I told the whole story, and by any miracle was believed,
I would be playing their game. Karolides would stay at home, which
was what they wanted. Somehow or other the sight of Scudder’s
dead face had made me a passionate believer in his scheme. He
was gone, but he had taken me into his confidence, and I was pretty
well bound to carry on his work.</p>

<p>You may think this ridiculous for a man in danger of his life,
but that was the way I looked at it. I am an ordinary sort of
fellow, not braver than other people, but I hate to see a good
man downed, and that long knife would not be the end of Scudder
if I could play the game in his place.</p>

<p>It took me an hour or two to think this out, and by that time
I had come to a decision. I must vanish somehow, and keep vanished
till the end of the second week in June. Then I must somehow find
a way to get in touch with the Government people and tell them
what Scudder had told me. I wished to Heaven he had told me more,
and that I had listened more carefully to the little he had told
me. I knew nothing but the barest facts. There was a big risk
that, even if I weathered the other dangers, I would not be believed
in the end. I must take my chance of that, and hope that something
might happen which would confirm my tale in the eyes of the Government.</p>

<p>My first job was to keep going for the next three weeks. It was
now the 24th day of May, and that meant twenty days of hiding
before I could venture to approach the powers that be. I reckoned
that two sets of people would be looking for me—Scudder’s enemies
to put me out of existence, and the police, who would want me
for Scudder’s murder. It was going to be a giddy hunt, and it
was queer how the prospect comforted me. I had been slack so long
that almost any chance of activity was welcome. When I had to
sit alone with that corpse and wait on Fortune I was no better
than a crushed worm, but if my neck’s safety was to hang on my
own wits I was prepared to be cheerful about it.</p>

<p>My next thought was whether Scudder had any papers about him
to give me a better clue to the business. I drew back the table-cloth
and searched his pockets, for I had no longer any shrinking from
the body. The face was wonderfully calm for a man who had been
struck down in a moment. There was nothing in the breast-pocket,
and only a few loose coins and a cigar-holder in the waistcoat.
The trousers held a little penknife and some silver, and the side
pocket of his jacket contained an old crocodile-skin cigar-case.
There was no sign of the little black book in which I had seen
him making notes. That had no doubt been taken by his murderer.</p>

<p>But as I looked up from my task I saw that some drawers had been
pulled out in the writing-table. Scudder would never have left
them in that state, for he was the tidiest of mortals. Someone
must have been searching for something—perhaps for the pocket-book.</p>

<p>I went round the flat and found that everything had been ransacked—the
inside of books, drawers, cupboards, boxes, even the pockets of
the clothes in my wardrobe, and the sideboard in the dining-room.
There was no trace of the book. Most likely the enemy had found
it, but they had not found it on Scudder’s body.</p>

<p>Then I got out an atlas and looked at a big map of the British
Isles. My notion was to get off to some wild district, where my
veldcraft would be of some use to me, for I would be like a trapped
rat in a city. I considered that Scotland would be best, for my
people were Scotch and I could pass anywhere as an ordinary Scotsman.
I had half an idea at first to be a German tourist, for my father
had had German partners, and I had been brought up to speak the
tongue pretty fluently, not to mention having put in three years
prospecting for copper in German Damaraland. But I calculated
that it would be less conspicuous to be a Scot, and less in a
line with what the police might know of my past. I fixed on Galloway
as the best place to go. It was the nearest wild part of Scotland,
so far as I could figure it out, and from the look of the map
was not over thick with population.</p>

<p>A search in Bradshaw informed me that a train left St Pancras
at 7.10, which would land me at any Galloway station in the late
afternoon. That was well enough, but a more important matter was
how I was to make my way to St Pancras, for I was pretty certain
that Scudder’s friends would be watching outside. This puzzled
me for a bit; then I had an inspiration, on which I went to bed
and slept for two troubled hours.</p>

<p>I got up at four and opened my bedroom shutters. The faint light
of a fine summer morning was flooding the skies, and the sparrows
had begun to chatter. I had a great revulsion of feeling, and
felt a God-forgotten fool. My inclination was to let things slide,
and trust to the British police taking a reasonable view of my
case. But as I reviewed the situation I could find no arguments
to bring against my decision of the previous night, so with a
wry mouth I resolved to go on with my plan. I was not feeling
in any particular funk; only disinclined to go looking for trouble,
if you understand me.</p>

<p>I hunted out a well-used tweed suit, a pair of strong nailed
boots, and a flannel shirt with a collar. Into my pockets I stuffed
a spare shirt, a cloth cap, some handkerchiefs, and a tooth-brush.
I had drawn a good sum in gold from the bank two days before,
in case Scudder should want money, and I took fifty pounds of
it in sovereigns in a belt which I had brought back from Rhodesia.
That was about all I wanted. Then I had a bath, and cut my moustache,
which was long and drooping, into a short stubbly fringe.</p>

<p>Now came the next step. Paddock used to arrive punctually at
7.30 and let himself in with a latch-key. But about twenty minutes
to seven, as I knew from bitter experience, the milkman turned
up with a great clatter of cans, and deposited my share outside
my door. I had seen that milkman sometimes when I had gone out
for an early ride. He was a young man about my own height, with
an ill-nourished moustache, and he wore a white overall. On him
I staked all my chances.</p>

<p>I went into the darkened smoking-room where the rays of morning
light were beginning to creep through the shutters. There I breakfasted
off a whisky-and-soda and some biscuits from the cupboard. By
this time it was getting on for six o’clock. I put a pipe in my
pocket and filled my pouch from the tobacco jar on the table by
the fireplace.</p>

<p>As I poked into the tobacco my fingers touched something hard,
and I drew out Scudder’s little black pocket-book....</p>

<p>That seemed to me a good omen. I lifted the cloth from the body
and was amazed at the peace and dignity of the dead face. "Goodbye,
old chap," I said; "I am going to do my best for you. Wish me
well, wherever you are."</p>

<p>Then I hung about in the hall waiting for the milkman. That was
the worst part of the business, for I was fairly choking to get
out of doors. Six-thirty passed, then six-forty, but still he
did not come. The fool had chosen this day of all days to be late.</p>

<p>At one minute after the quarter to seven I heard the rattle of
the cans outside. I opened the front door, and there was my man,
singling out my cans from a bunch he carried and whistling through
his teeth. He jumped a bit at the sight of me.</p>

<p>"Come in here a moment," I said. "I want a word with you." And
I led him into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"I reckon you’re a bit of a sportsman," I said, "and I want you
to do me a service. Lend me your cap and overall for ten minutes,
and here’s a sovereign for you."</p>

<p>His eyes opened at the sight of the gold, and he grinned broadly.
"Wot’s the gyme?"he asked.</p>

<p>"A bet," I said. "I haven’t time to explain, but to win it I’ve
got to be a milkman for the next ten minutes. All you’ve got to
do is to stay here till I come back. You’ll be a bit late, but
nobody will complain, and you’ll have that quid for yourself."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" he said cheerily. "I ain’t the man to spoil a bit
of sport. ’Ere’s the rig, guv’nor."</p>

<p>I stuck on his flat blue hat and his white overall, picked up
the cans, banged my door, and went whistling downstairs. The porter
at the foot told me to shut my jaw, which sounded as if my make-up
was adequate.</p>

<p>At first I thought there was nobody in the street. Then I caught
sight of a policeman a hundred yards down, and a loafer shuffling
past on the other side. Some impulse made me raise my eyes to
the house opposite, and there at a first-floor window was a face.
As the loafer passed he looked up, and I fancied a signal was
exchanged.</p>

<p>I crossed the street, whistling gaily and imitating the jaunty
swing of the milkman. Then I took the first side street, and went
up a left-hand turning which led past a bit of vacant ground.
There was no one in the little street, so I dropped the milk-cans
inside the hoarding and sent the cap and overall after them. I
had only just put on my cloth cap when a postman came round the
corner. I gave him good morning and he answered me unsuspiciously.
At the moment the clock of a neighbouring church struck the hour
of seven.</p>

<p>There was not a second to spare. As soon as I got to Euston Road
I took to my heels and ran. The clock at Euston Station showed
five minutes past the hour. At St Pancras I had no time to take
a ticket, let alone that I had not settled upon my destination.
A porter told me the platform, and as I entered it I saw the train
already in motion. Two station officials blocked the way, but
I dodged them and clambered into the last carriage.</p>

<p>Three minutes later, as we were roaring through the northern
tunnels, an irate guard interviewed me. He wrote out for me a
ticket to Newton-Stewart, a name which had suddenly come back
to my memory, and he conducted me from the first-class compartment
where I had ensconced myself to a third-class smoker, occupied
by a sailor and a stout woman with a child. He went off grumbling,
and as I mopped my brow I observed to my companions in my broadest
Scots that it was a sore job catching trains. I had already entered
upon my part.</p>

<p>"The impidence o’ that gyaird!" said the lady bitterly. "He needit
a Scotch tongue to pit him in his place. He was complainin’ o’
this wean no haein’ a ticket and her no fower till August twalmonth,
and he was objectin’ to this gentleman spittin’."</p>

<p>The sailor morosely agreed, and I started my new life in an atmosphere
of protest against authority. I reminded myself that a week ago
I had been finding the world dull.</p>
