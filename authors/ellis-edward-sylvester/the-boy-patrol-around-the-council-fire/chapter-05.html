<p>As Mike Murphy approached the landing he saw the second canoe
drawn up the beach, which was proof that his friends had returned
from their excursion to the western end of the lake. The bright
light from the main room of the clubhouse showed that the Boy
Scouts were gathered there and he decided to go in.</p>

<p>The night was so mild that no fire burned on the broad hearth,
but the suspended lamp filled the apartment with a soft illumination
which served almost as well as midday. Jack Crandall, the hero
of the broken leg, sat in his invalid chair in front of the fireplace
and at his side was Uncle Elk. Jack had been listening to the
reports of his young friends who had been investigating trees,
but were mostly interested in bird lore. The comments which Jack
made on the written notes as read to him showed that he was the
best informed of any of the Scouts concerning birds. He cleared
up many doubts and answered questions so intelligently that the
venerable Instructor in Woodcraft complimented him.</p>

<p>Mike came through the open door so silently that none of the
boys noticed him. No chair being available, he sat down on the
floor, as the majority had already done. He was near the entrance
and aimed to avoid observation, but as Uncle Elk from his position
faced him it was probable he noticed the lad, as did Jack Crandall,
who also fronted that direction.</p>

<p>The reports and the comments thereon having been finished, the
old man was speaking:</p>

<p>"To make satisfactory progress in acquiring knowledge," said
he in his low, musical voice to which all listened with alert
interest, "you must do so systematically. In our tramp through
the woods the other day we picked up a good deal of information,
but it was haphazard. We talked of trees as we came across them,
but it was fragmentary and ten times as much was left unlearned
as was learned. I am glad to know that your Scout Master has followed
the right course in directing your study of our native trees,
not alone in Maine but as far north as Canada, westward to the
Rockies and down to the northern boundaries of the Southern States.
The subject is too vast for us to cover in one evening or in a
dozen evenings. Let us rather summarize. We shall put our wits
together and see how many families we can name, without giving
the different species under each. The first is the magnolia family,
of which there are four varieties, while under the custard apple
there is but one, the papaw. Now let me hear from you."</p>

<p>Nearly an hour was spent during which scarcely a boy in the room
kept silent. The pleased old man nodded his head and finally raised
his hand for quiet.</p>

<p>"I believe you have mentioned about all. Now, while Isaac jots
down the names at the table, let’s try to evolve something like
order therefrom. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Isaac Rothstein nodded and held his lead pencil over the paper.
Here is the list upon which all finally agreed:</p>

<p>Magnolia, custard-apple, linden, rue, ailantus, holly, staff-tree,
buckthorn, rose, pea, sumach, maple, horse chestnut, heath, honeysuckle,
dogwood, ginseng, witch hazel, ebony, olive, begonia, laurel,
mulberry, elm, plane-tree, walnut, birch, beech, willow, pine,
yew and oak.</p>

<p>"None of you has seen all of these," continued the old man, "but
I hope you will have the opportunity of studying their peculiarities
sometime. To illustrate what a rich treat is before you, we shall
give a few minutes’ attention to the oak family, concerning which
you may think I had considerable to say the other day. Let me
show you how much was left unsaid.</p>

<p>"Most persons think of the oak as a slow grower. This is true
of two or three species but not of the family. The majority need
a hundred years to attain perfection and they rarely bear acorns
until twenty years old. The acorn requires no protection in order
to mature, and those that are not eaten by wild animals or trodden
under foot do their work well. The <em>quercus</em> is one of
the longest-lived trees."</p>

<p>"What is the greatest age that they attain, Uncle Elk?" asked
Scout Master Hall, one of the most interested in the audience.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to say, but there is little doubt that many
of them flourish for a thousand years. There are vigorous oaks
to-day in England that were old in the time of William the Conqueror.
The famous White Oak of Hartford, in which Captain Wadsworth hid
the charter two hundred and twenty-five years ago, was several
centuries old at the time, and it was not until the summer of
1856 that a windstorm brought it to the ground. While it is one
of the most valuable of the family, the white oak is in danger
of extinction, because of its value as timber and on account of
the sweetness of its nuts, which makes it a favorite with wild
creatures that will not eat the bitter acorns of other oaks. You
know the white oak is so called because of the color of its bark,
which however is generally an ashen gray. Can any of you tell
me the name of the oak that is fifty feet or slightly more in
height, grows in Texas, has a fine-checked bark nearly the color
of the white oak, with an awkward form and has shoots along the
whole length of its branches, with the leaves coarse and rough
on both sides? I shall not wait for you to guess the name, which
is the post oak.</p>

<p>"The bur oak grows to a height of a hundred and fifty feet and
ranges south to Texas and from the foothills of the Rockies to
the Atlantic coast, being most abundant in Kansas and Nebraska.
One of J. Fenimore Cooper’s most pleasing tales is ‘The Oak Openings,’
a name applied to the scattered forests of Minnesota. Now, you
may know that the cork of commerce is the outer bark of an oak
growing in southern Europe. The bur oak seems to be striving to
produce the same thing and probably will succeed after awhile.</p>

<p>"The chestnut oak sometimes reaches a height of a hundred feet,
but the trunk divides into large limbs a few feet above the ground.
It is found in this State, westward through Ohio and as far south
as Kentucky. It has many features in common with the yellow oak,
whose range is somewhat different.</p>

<p>"The dwarf chinkapin, or scrub chestnut oak, is a shrub rarely
more than a dozen feet high and grows on sandy or rocky soil.
We do not meet with it north of Massachusetts. In Missouri and
Kansas, it acquires dimensions more like a tree.</p>

<p>"The swamp white oak grows to a height of more than a hundred
feet, and is fond of the borders of swamps. The top is narrow
and round and the branches pendulous. You know about the red oak,
which is a rapid grower and ranges from this State to Georgia
and westward to Kansas, but attains its finest development north
of the Ohio.</p>

<p>"To continue, I should add the names of the scarlet oak, the
black and the yellow oak, the pin oak, the swamp Spanish, the
bear, the scrub, the black jack, the barren, the shingle, the
laurel, and the willow.</p>

<p>"You have noticed that I have done little more than mention the
names of the different species. You have learned very little,
for it is necessary that you should know the range of each, the
height to which it grows, the characteristics of the bark, the
wood, the leaves, the flowers and acorns. In conclusion, I shall
say that the willow oak is one of the most interesting of trees.
Its leaves resemble those of the willow, as do the straight slender
shoots. It grows on the wet borders of swamps, but keeps away
from the sea coast. Its acorns are very small, with a kernel so
bitter that you would never bite into it a second time.</p>

<p>"My object this evening," said Uncle Elk, "has been rather to
awaken a desire on your part to study systematically our common
American trees than to give you actual information. Let us dismiss
the subject, for in dropping a matter of that kind we should follow
the rule in eating, which is to stop before the appetite is cloyed.
Suppose to-morrow night we have a little talk about American birds."</p>

<p>There was general nodding of heads and the old man rose to his
feet. He was so pleased with his listeners that he said:</p>

<p>"If we get through that subject in time, I’ll promise to tell
you a story, provided you would like to hear one from me."</p>

<p>He could be seen smiling behind his abundant gray beard.</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys always. Nothing suits them better than a story.
So I shall bid you good night for the present, hoping nothing
will interfere with our meeting again to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"The better plan," suggested Scout Master Hall, "is for you to
take supper with us, for I foresee that there will be much for
you to tell us. We don’t want to miss the talk about birds, and
I am as eager as the boys to hear your story, which I know will
be a good one."</p>

<p>All crowded around the Instructor in Woodcraft, shaking hands,
thanking him and urging him so warmly to accept the invitation
that he could not refuse. The last one with whom he clasped hands
was Jack Crandall, who straightened up in his easy chair and declared
he was receiving more benefit than a dozen doctors could impart.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy had risen to his feet at the close of the old man’s
talk, but kept his place by the door until Uncle Elk came opposite.
A nod of the hermit’s head told Mike that he wished to speak with
him alone. The signal was observed by several who stayed behind
as the two passed out and down the porch to the beach. Uncle Elk
did not speak until they were beyond the hearing of the others.
Then he halted and looked into the face of the youth.</p>

<p>"Well, Michael, what word do you bring me?"</p>

<p>"I told the docther what ye said and he is agreeable. He will
not come to the bungalow in the evening unless we signal for him,
which the same doesn’t seem to be likely."</p>

<p>"That is what I wanted to know, and I thank you for your service.
Well, my son, did you learn anything to-night?"</p>

<p>The youth was not sure of the scope of the question.</p>

<p>"If ye ask whither I larned anything from your words to the byes,
I may say I picked up a good deal more than I iver knowed, which
wasn’t much."</p>

<p>"I refer to what you did after leaving the home of Dr. Spellman
and paddling to the upper side of the lake."</p>

<p>"Did ye obsarve me?" asked the astonished Mike.</p>

<p>"How could I help it, when I passed within a few feet of you
in my own boat?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t notice it whin I came ashore."</p>

<p>"I landed a little way up the beach, where my boat now awaits
me. You haven’t told me whether you learned anything through your
scouting."</p>

<p>"I saan no one but yersilf, but I heerd them two tramps laughing
over something and I smelled the cigar that one of them was smoking."</p>

<p>"No, you didn’t."</p>

<p>"I don’t catch yer maaning, Uncle Elk," said the mystified Mike;
"I sartinly sniffed a cigar and heerd two men chuckling to thimsilves."</p>

<p>"I haven’t denied that, but they were not the tramps you have
in mind."</p>

<p>"How can ye know the same for sartin?"</p>

<p>"I went to that spot on the shore to meet those men; they are
old acquaintances and the name of neither is Biggs nor Hutt."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"It would be useless to name them, since they are strangers to
you."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t ye stay and inthrodooce me?"</p>

<p>"I may do so one of these days, but I gave you a chance to find
out things for yourself."</p>

<p>"And mighty little I larned," remarked Mike disgustedly; "if
ye don’t mind, would ye tell me what the mischief scared thim
two tramps to the extint that they jumped out of the canoe they
had stole and took a bath in Gosling Lake?"</p>

<p>Uncle Elk was distinctly heard to chuckle.</p>

<p>"I had a talk with my two friends regarding the incident and
I don’t wonder that they laughed even after I had left them."</p>

<p>"I faal like laughing mesilf, Uncle Elk, and if ye’ll give me
the same cause I’ll laugh so hard that it will wake the docther’s
daughter on t’other side of the lake."</p>

<p>"Have patience, Michael, and don’t think I am trifling with you,
but I am under a promise not to reveal this little secret until
I have permission. Good night."</p>

<p>Mike stood gazing after the old man until he passed from sight
in the obscurity and he heard him launching his canoe. Then the
youth strolled thoughtfully back.</p>

<p>"I’m getting mixed," he muttered with a sigh, "as Jerry Lanagan
said whin they run him through a thrashing machine." </p>
