<p>Ram&oacute;n saw Carlota and his boys in the city, but it was a rather
fruitless meeting.  The elder boy was just uncomfortable in the
presence of his father, but the younger Cyprian, who was delicate
and very intelligent, had a rather lofty air of displeasure with
his parent.</p>

<p>'Do you know what they sing, papa?' he said.</p>

<p>'Not all the things they sing,' said Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'They sing - ' the boy hesitated.  Then, in his clear young voice,
he piped up, to the tune of La Cucaracha:</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Don Ram&oacute;n don't drink, don't smoke.<br />
 Do&ntilde;a Carlota wished he would.<br />
 He's going to wear the sky-blue cloak<br />
 That he's stolen from the Mother of God.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>'No, I'm not,' said Ram&oacute;n, smiling.  'Mine's got a snake and a bird
in the middle, and black zigzags and a red fringe.  You'd better
come and see it.'</p>

<p>'No, papa!  I don't want to.'</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'I don't want to be mixed up in this affair.  It makes us all look
ridiculous.'</p>

<p>'But how do you think you look, anyhow, in your striped little
sailor suit and your little saintly look?  We'd better dress you as
the Infant Jesus.'</p>

<p>'No, papa!  You are in bad taste.  One doesn't say those things.'</p>

<p>'Now you'll have to confess to a fib.  You say one doesn't say
those things, when I, who am your father, said them only a moment
ago, and you heard me.'</p>

<p>'I mean good people don't.  Decent people.'</p>

<p>'Now you'll have to confess again, for calling your father
indecent. - Terrible child!'</p>

<p>The child flushed, and tears rose to his eyes.  There was silence
for a while.</p>

<p>'So you don't want to come to Jamiltepec?' said Ram&oacute;n, to his boys.</p>

<p>'Yes!' said the elder boy, slowly.  'I want to come and bathe in
the lake, and have a boat.  But - they say it is impossible.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'They say you make yourself a peon, in your clothes.' - The boy was
shy.</p>

<p>'They're very nice clothes, you know.  Nicer than those little
breeches of yours.'</p>

<p>'They say, also, that you pretend to be the Aztec god
Quetzalcoatl.'</p>

<p>'Not at all.  I only pretend that the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl is
coming back to the Mexicans.'</p>

<p>'But, papa, it is not true.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Because it is impossible.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'There never was any Quetzalcoatl, except idols.'</p>

<p>'Is there any Jesus, except images?'</p>

<p>'Yes, papa.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'In heaven.'</p>

<p>'Then in heaven there is also Quetzalcoatl.  And what is in heaven
is capable of coming back to earth.  Don't you believe me?'</p>

<p>'I can't.'</p>

<p>'Then go on unbelieving,' said the father, laughing at them and
rising to leave them.</p>

<p>'It is very bad that they sing songs about you, and put mama in;
like about Pancho Villa,' said the younger boy.  'It hurts me very
much.'</p>

<p>'Rub it with Vapour-rub, my pet,' said Ram&oacute;n.  'Rub it with Vapour-
rub, where it hurts you.'</p>

<p>'What a real bad man you are, papa!'</p>

<p>'What a real good child are you, my son!  Isn't that so?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, papa.  I only know you are bad.'</p>

<p>'Oh!  Oh!  Is that all they teach thee at thy American school?'</p>

<p>'Next term,' said Ciprianito, 'I want to change my name.  I don't
want to be called Carrasco any more.  When thou art in the
newspapers, they will laugh at us.'</p>

<p>'Oh!  Oh!  I am laughing at thee NOW, little frog!  What name wilt
thou choose, then?  Espina, perhaps.  Thou knowest Carrasco is a
wild bush, on the moors in Spain, where we come from.  Wilt thou be
the little thorn on the bush?  Call thyself Espina, thou art a
sprig of the old tree.  Entonces, adi&oacute;s!  Se&ntilde;or Espina Espinita!'</p>

<p>'Adi&oacute;s!' said the boy abruptly, flushing with rage.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n took a motor-car to Sayula, for there was a made road.  But
already the rains were washing it away.  The car lurched and bumped
in the great gaps.  In one place a cami&oacute;n lay on its back, where it
had overturned.</p>

<p>On the flat desert there were already small smears of water, and
the pink cosmos flowers, and the yellow, were just sprouting their
tufts of buds.  The hills in the distance were going opaque, as
leaves came out on the invisible trees and bushes.  The earth was
coming to life.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n called in Sayula at Kate's house.  She was out, but the wild
Concha came scouring across the beach, to fetch her. - 'There is Don
Ram&oacute;n!  There is Don Ram&oacute;n!'</p>

<p>Kate hurried home, with sand in her shoes.</p>

<p>She thought Ram&oacute;n looked tired, and, in his black suit, sinister.</p>

<p>'I didn't expect you,' she said.</p>

<p>'I am on my way back from town.'</p>

<p>He sat very still, with that angry look on his creamy dark face,
and he kept pushing back his black moustache from his closed, angry
lips.</p>

<p>'Did you see anybody in town?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I saw Don Cipriano - and Do&ntilde;a Carlota, and my boys!'</p>

<p>'Oh, how nice for you!  Are they quite well?'</p>

<p>'In excellent health, I believe.'</p>

<p>She laughed suddenly.</p>

<p>'You are still cross,' she said.  'Is it about the monkeys still?'</p>

<p>'Se&ntilde;ora,' he said, leaning forward, so that his black hair dropped
a little on his brow, 'in monkeydom I don't know who is prince.
But in the kingdom of fools, I believe it is I.'</p>

<p>'Why?' she said.</p>

<p>And as he did not answer, she added:</p>

<p>'It must be a comfort to be a prince, even of fools.'</p>

<p>He looked daggers at her, then burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>'Oh, Se&ntilde;ora m&iacute;a!  What ails us men, when we are always wanting to
be good?'</p>

<p>'Are you repenting of it?' she laughed.</p>

<p>'Yes!' he said.  'I am a prince of fools!  Why have I started this
Quetzalcoatl business?  Why?  Pray tell me why.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you wanted to.'</p>

<p>He pondered for a time, pushing up his moustache.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it is better to be a monkey than a fool.  I object to
being called a monkey, nevertheless.  Carlota is a monkey, no more;
and my two boys are prize young monkeys in sailor suits.  And I am
a fool.  Yet what is the difference between a fool and a monkey?'</p>

<p>'Qui&eacute;n sabe?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'One wants to be good, and the other is sure he IS good.  So I make
a fool of myself.  They are sure they are always good, so that
makes monkeys of them.  Oh, if only the world would blow up like a
bomb!'</p>

<p>'It won't!' said Kate.</p>

<p>'True enough. - Ah, well!'</p>

<p>He drew himself erect, pulling himself together.</p>

<p>'Do you think, Se&ntilde;ora Caterina, you might marry our mutual
General?'  Ram&oacute;n had put himself aside again.</p>

<p>'I - I don't know!' stammered Kate.  'I hardly think so.'</p>

<p>'He is not sympathetic to you at all?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is.  He is alive, and there is even a certain fascination
about him. - But one shouldn't try marrying a man of another race,
do you think, even if he were more sympathetic?'</p>

<p>'Ah!' sighed Ram&oacute;n.  'It's no good generalizing.  It's no good
marrying anybody, unless there will be a real fusion somewhere.'</p>

<p>'And I feel there wouldn't,' said Kate.  'I feel he just wants
something of me; and perhaps I just want something of him.  But he
would never meet me.  He would never come forward himself, to meet
me.  He would come to take something from me and I should have to
let him.  And I don't want merely that.  I want a man who will come
half-way, just half-way, to meet me.'</p>

<p>Don Ram&oacute;n pondered, and shook his head.</p>

<p>'You are right,' he said.  'Yet, in these matters, one never knows
what is half-way, nor where it is.  A woman who just wants to be
taken, and then to cling on, is a parasite.  And a man who wants
just to take, without giving, is a creature of prey.'</p>

<p>'And I'm afraid Don Cipriano might be that,' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Possibly,' said Ram&oacute;n.  'He is not so with me.  But perhaps he
would be, if we did not meet - perhaps it is our half-way - in some
physical belief that is at the very middle of us, and which we
recognize in one another.  Don't you think there might be that
between you and him?'</p>

<p>'I doubt if he'd feel it necessary, with a woman.  A woman wouldn't
be important enough.'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n was silent.</p>

<p>'Perhaps!' he said.  'With a woman, a man always wants to let
himself go.  And it is precisely with a woman that he should never
let himself go.  It is precisely with a woman that he should never
let himself go, but stick to his innermost belief, and meet her
just there.  Because when the innermost belief coincides in them
both, if it's physical, there, and then, and nowhere else, they can
meet.  And it's no good unless there is a meeting.  It's no good a
man ravishing a woman, and it's absolutely no good a woman
ravishing a man.  It's a sin, that is.  There is such a thing as
sin, and that's the centre of it.  Men and women keep on ravishing
one another.  Absurd as it may sound, it is not I who would ravish
Carlota.  It is she who would ravish me.  Strange and absurd and a
little shameful, it is true. - Letting oneself go, is either
ravishing or being ravished.  Oh, if we could only abide by our own
souls, and meet in the abiding place. - Se&ntilde;ora, I have not a very
great respect for myself.  Woman and I have failed with one
another, and it is a bad failure to have in the middle of oneself.'</p>

<p>Kate looked at him in wonder, with a little fear.  Why was he
confessing to her?  Was he going to love her?  She almost suspended
her breathing.  He looked at her with a sort of sorrow on his brow,
and in his dark eyes, anger, vexation, wisdom, and a dull pain.</p>

<p>'I am sorry,' he went on, 'that Carlota and I are as we are with
one another.  Who am I, even to talk about Quetzalcoatl, when my
heart is hollow with anger against the woman I have married and the
children she bore me? - We never met in our souls, she and I.  At
first I loved her, and she wanted me to ravish her.  Then after a
while a man becomes uneasy.  He can't keep on wanting to ravish a
woman, the same woman.  He has revulsions.  Then she loved me, and
she wanted to ravish me.  And I liked it for a time.  But she had
revulsions too.  The eldest boy is really my boy, when I ravished
her.  And the youngest is her boy, when she ravished me.  See how
miserable it is!  And now we can never meet; she turns to her
crucified Jesus, and I to my uncrucified and uncrucifiable
Quetzalcoatl, who at least cannot be ravished.'</p>

<p>'And I'm sure you won't make him a ravisher,' she said.</p>

<p>'Who knows?  If I err, it will be on that side.  But you know,
Se&ntilde;ora, Quetzalcoatl is to me only the symbol of the best a man may
be, in the next days.  The universe is a nest of dragons, with a
perfectly unfathomable life-mystery at the centre of it.  If I call
the mystery the Morning Star, surely it doesn't matter!  A man's
blood can't beat in the abstract.  And man is a creature who wins
his own creation inch by inch from the nest of the cosmic dragons.
Or else he loses it little by little, and goes to pieces.  Now we
are all losing it, in the ravishing and ravished disintegration.
We must pull ourselves together, hard, both men and women, or we
are all lost. - We must pull ourselves together, hard.'</p>

<p>'But are you a man who needs a woman in his life?' she said.</p>

<p>'I am a man who yearns for the sensual fulfilment of my soul,
Se&ntilde;ora,' he said.  'I am a man who has no belief in abnegation of
the blood desires.  I am a man who is always on the verge of taking
wives and concubines to live with me, so deep is my desire for that
fulfilment.  Except that now I know that is useless - not momentarily
useless, but in the long run - my ravishing a woman with hot desire.
No matter how much she is in love with me and desires me to ravish
her.  It is no good, and the very inside of me knows it is no good.
Wine, woman, and song - all that - all that game is up.  Our insides
won't really have it any more.  Yet it is hard to pull ourselves
together.'</p>

<p>'So that you really want a woman to be with you?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Ah, Se&ntilde;ora!  If I could trust myself; and trust her!  I am no
longer a young man, who can afford to make mistakes.  I am forty-
two years old, and I am making my last - and perhaps in truth, my
first great effort as a man.  I hope I may perish before I make a
big mistake.'</p>

<p>'Why should you make a mistake?  You needn't?'</p>

<p>'I?  It is very easy for me to make a mistake.  Very easy, on the
one hand, for me to become arrogant and a ravisher.  And very easy,
on the other hand, for me to deny myself, and make a sort of
sacrifice of my life.  Which is being ravished.  Easy to let
myself, in a certain sense, be ravished.  I did it to a small
degree even yesterday, with the Bishop of Guadalajara.  And it is
bad.  If I had to end my life in a mistake, Se&ntilde;ora, I had rather
end it in being a ravisher, than in being ravished.  As a hot
ravisher, I can still slash and cut at the disease of the other
thing, the horrible pandering and the desire men have to be
ravished, the hateful, ignoble desire they have.'</p>

<p>'But why don't you do as you say, stick by the innermost soul that
is in you, and meet a woman there, meet her, as you say, where your
two souls coincide in their deepest desire?  Not always that
horrible unbalance that you call ravishing.'</p>

<p>'Why don't I?  But which woman can I meet in the body, without that
slow degradation of ravishing, or being ravished, setting in?  If I
marry a Spanish woman or a dark Mexican, she will give herself up
to me to be ravished.  If I marry a woman of the Anglo-Saxon or any
blonde northern stock, she will want to ravish me, with the will of
all the ancient white demons.  Those that want to be ravished are
parasites on the soul, and one has revulsions.  Those that want to
ravish a man are vampires.  And between the two, there is nothing.'</p>

<p>'Surely there are SOME really good women?'</p>

<p>'Well, show me them.  They are all potential Carlotas or - or - yes,
Caterinas.  I am sure you ravished your Joachim till he died.  No
doubt he wanted it; even more than you wanted it.  It is not just
sex.  It lies in the will.  Victims and victimizers.  The upper
classes, craving to be victims to the lower classes; or else
craving to make victims of the lower classes.  The politicians,
craving to make one people victims to another.  The Church, with
its evil will for turning the people into humble, writhing things
that shall crave to be victimized, to be ravished - I tell you, the
earth is a place of shame.'</p>

<p>'But if YOU want to be different,' said Kate, 'surely a few other
people do - really.'</p>

<p>'It may be,' he said, becoming calm.  'It may be.  I wish I kept
myself together better.  I must keep myself together, keep myself
within the middle place, where I am still.  My Morning Star.  Now I
am ashamed of having talked like this to you, Se&ntilde;ora Caterina.'</p>

<p>'Why?' she cried.  And for the first time, the flush of hurt and
humiliation came into her face.</p>

<p>He saw it at once, and put his hand on hers for a moment.</p>

<p>'No,' he said.  'I am not ashamed.  I am relieved.'</p>

<p>She flushed deeply at his touch, and was silent.  He rose hastily,
to leave, craving to be alone again with his own soul.</p>

<p>'On Sunday,' he said, 'will you come into the plaza, in the
morning, when the drum sounds?  Will you come?'</p>

<p>'What for?' she said.</p>

<p>'Well!  Come, and you will see.'</p>

<p>He was gone in a flash.</p>

<p>There were many soldiers in the village.  When she went to the
post-office, she saw the men in their cotton uniforms lying about
in the entrance to the military station.  There must have been
fifty or more, little men, not the tall soldiers in slouched hats.
These were little, quick, compact men, like Cipriano, and they
talked in a strange Indian language, very subdued.  They were very
rarely seen in the streets.  They kept out of sight.</p>

<p>But at night everyone was requested to be indoors by ten o'clock,
and through the darkness Kate heard the patrols of horse-soldiers
riding round.</p>

<p>There was an air of excitement and mystery in the place.  The
parish priest, a rather overbearing, fat man of fifty or so, had
preached a famous Saturday evening sermon against Ram&oacute;n and
Quetzalcoatl, forbidding the heathen name to be mentioned,
threatening with all the penalties any parishioner who read the
Hymns, or even listened.</p>

<p>So, of course, he was attacked when he left the church, and had to
be rescued by soldiers who were in the doorway.  They marched him
safely home.  But his criada, the old woman who served him, was
told by more women than one that the next time the padre opened his
mouth against Quetzalcoatl, he would have a few inches of machete
in his fat guts.</p>

<p>So his reverence stayed at home, and a curate officiated.</p>

<p>Practically all the people who came over the lake in boats on
Saturdays went to mass in Sayula church.  The great doors stood
open all the day.  Men as they passed to and fro to the lake, took
off their big hats, with a curious cringing gesture, as they went
by the gateway of the church.  All day long, scattered people were
kneeling in the aisles or among the benches, the men kneeling
erect, their big hats down by their knees, their curious tall-
shaped Indian heads with the thick black hair also erect; only the
kneeling legs, close together, humble.  The women hooded themselves
in their dark rebozos and spread their elbows as they kneeled at a
bench, in a slack sort of voluptuousness.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, a great ruddy flickering of many candle-points,
away down the dark cavern of the church; and a clustering of dark
men's heads, a shuffling of women, a come and go of men arriving
from the lake, of men departing to the market.  A hush, not exactly
of worship, but of a certain voluptuous admiration of the loftiness
and glitter, a sensual, almost victimized self-abandon to the god
of death, the Crucified streaked with blood, or to the pretty white
woman in a blue mantle, with her little doll's face under her
crown, Mary, the doll of dolls, Ni&ntilde;a of Ni&ntilde;as.</p>

<p>It was not worship.  It was a sort of numbness and letting the soul
sink uncontrolled.  And it was a luxury, after all the week of
unwashed dullness in their squalid villages of straw huts.  But it
irritated Kate.</p>

<p>The men got up and tiptoed away in their sandals, crossing
themselves front and back, on the navel and on the back of the
head, with holy water.  And their black eyes shone with a loose,
sensuous look.  Instead of having gathered themselves together and
become graver, stronger, more collected and deep in their own
integrity, they emerged only the more loose and sloppy and
uncontrolled.</p>

<p>Oh, if there is one thing men need to learn, but the Mexican
Indians especially, it is to collect each man his own soul together
deep inside him, and to abide by it.  The Church, instead of
helping men to this, pushes them more and more into a soft,
emotional helplessness, with the unpleasant sensuous gratification
of feeling themselves victims, victimized, victimized, but at the
same time with the lurking sardonic consciousness that in the end a
victim is stronger than the victimizer.  In the end, the victims
pull down their victimizer, like a pack of hyenas on an unwary
lion.  They know it.  Cursed are the falsely meek, for they are
inheriting the earth.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning there was early mass at sunrise, another mass at
seven o'clock, another at nine, another at eleven.  Then there was
a little band of violins and 'cellos, playing old-fashioned dance
music; there was, especially early in the morning, a solid mass of
peons and women, kneeling on the floor; and a flapping of dusky
candles, a smell of the exhaust air of candles, a heavy, rolling
fume of incense, and the heavy choir of men's voices, solid,
powerful, impressive, from the gallery.</p>

<p>And the people went away in sensuous looseness, which soon turned,
in the market, to hate, the old, unfathomable hate which lies at
the bottom of the Indian heart, and which always rises black and
turbid when they have swayed awhile in sensuous gratification.</p>

<p>The church inside was a dead interior, like all Mexican churches,
even the gorgeous Puebla cathedral.  The interior of almost any
Mexican church gives the impression of cynical barrenness, cynical
meaninglessness, an empty, cynical, mocking shell.  The Italian
churches are built much in the same style, and yet in them lingers
a shadow and stillness of old, mysterious holiness.  The hush.</p>

<p>But not in Mexico.  The churches outside are impressive.  Inside,
and it is curious to define it, they are blatant; void of sound and
yet with no hush, simple, and yet completely vulgar, barren,
sterile.  More barren than a bank or a schoolroom or an empty
concert-hall, less mysterious than any of these.  You get a sense
of plaster, of mortar, of whitewash, of smeared blue-wash or grey-
wash; and of gilt laid on and ready to peel off.  Even in the most
gorgeous churches, the gilt is hatefully gilt, never golden.
Nothing is soft nor mellow.</p>

<p>So the interior of Sayula church; and Kate had often been in.  The
white exterior was charming, and so valuable in the landscape, with
the twin white pagoda-towers peering out of the green willow-trees.
But inside, it seemed nothing but whitewash, stencilled over with
grey scroll-work decorations.  The windows were high, and many,
letting in the light as into a schoolroom.  Jesus, streaked with
blood, was in one of the transepts, and the Virgin, a doll in faded
satin, stood startled inside a glass case.  There were rag flowers
and paper flowers, coarse lace and silver that looked like tin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was quite clean, and very much frequented.</p>

<p>The Month of Mary had gone by, the blue and white paper ribbons
were all taken down, the palm-trees in pots were all removed from
the aisle, the little girls in white dresses and little crowns of
flowers no longer came with posies in their hand, at evening.
Curious, the old gentle ceremonials of Europe, how trashy they seem
in Mexico, just a cheap sort of charade.</p>

<p>The day of Corpus Christi came, with high mass and the church full
to the doors with kneeling peons, from dawn till noon.  Then a
feeble little procession of children within the church, because the
law forbids religious processions outside.  But all, somehow, for
nothing.  Just so that the people could call it a fiesta, and so
have an excuse to be more slack, more sloshy and uncontrolled than
ever.  The one Mexican desire; to let themselves go in sloppy
inertia.</p>

<p>And this was the all-in-all of the religion.  Instead of doing as
it should, collecting the soul into its own strength and integrity,
the religious day left it all the more decomposed and degenerate.</p>

<p>However, the weeks passed, the crowd in the church seemed the same
as ever.  But the crowd in the church one hour was the crowd of
Quetzalcoatl the next hour.  Just a sensation.</p>

<p>Till the more socialistic Readers mingled a little anti-clerical
bitterness in their reading.  And all the peons began to say: was
El Se&ntilde;or a gringo, and the Sant&iacute;sima, was she nothing but a
gringuita?</p>

<p>This provoked retaliation on the part of the priests, first mere
admonitions, then at last the loud denunciations and threat of that
sermon.  Which meant war.</p>

<p>Everybody waited for Saturday.  Saturday came, and the church
remained shut.  Saturday night, the church was dark and closed.
Sunday, the church was silent and the doors blank fastened.</p>

<p>Something like consternation spread through the market host.  They
had nowhere to go! - But among the consternation was a piqued
curiosity.  Perhaps something exciting was going to happen.</p>

<p>Things had happened before.  In the revolutions, many of the
churches in Mexico have been used for stables and for barracks.
And churches are turned into schools, and concert halls, and
cinematograph theatres.  The convents and the monasteries are most
of them barracks for the rag-tag-and-bobtail soldiers.  The world
changes, is bound to change.</p>

<p>The second Saturday of the closed church was, as it happened, a big
market.  Much fruit and stuff had come up the lake, from the south
from far distances, even from Colima.  There were men with lacquer
wooden bowls, and women with glazed pottery.  And as usual, men
crouching in guard over twenty centavos worth of nauseous tropical
plums, or chiles, or mangoes, in tiny pyramids along the roadway.</p>

<p>A crowded market, with the much and the little of the Indians.  And
the church doors shut and locked, the church bells silent, even the
clock stopped.  True, the clock was always stopping.  But not with
such a final arrest.</p>

<p>No mass, no confession, no little orgy of incense and slack
emotion!  The low rumble of murmuring tones, the quick, apprehensive
glances around.  Vendors by the causeway squatted tight, as if to
make themselves dense and small, squatting down on their haunches
with their knees up to their shoulders, like the Aztec idols.  And
soldiers in twos and threes sprinkled everywhere.  And Se&ntilde;oras and
Se&ntilde;oritas, in their black gauze scarves or mantillas, tripping to
the church for mass and shrilling round the gateway of the church,
all a bubble and a froth of chatter; though they had known quite
well the church was shut.</p>

<p>But it was Sunday morning, and something was due to happen.</p>

<p>At about half-past ten, a boat appeared, and men in snow-white
clothes got out, one carrying a drum.  They marched quickly through
the people, under the old trees on the sand, across to the church.
They passed through the broken iron gates into the stone courtyard
in front of the church.</p>

<p>At the church doors, which were still shut, they took off their
blouses, and stood in a ring, with dark naked shoulders and the
blue-and-black sashes of Quetzalcoatl round their waists.</p>

<p>The drum began to beat, with a powerful, pounding note, as the men
stood bare-headed and bare-breasted in a circle outside the church
doors; a strange ring of lustrous, bluey-black heads and dark
shoulders, above the snowy-white pantaloons.  Monotonously the drum
beat, on and on.  Then the little clay flute with the husky sound
wheezed a clear melody.</p>

<p>The whole market pressed densely towards the gateways of the
church.  But there, soldiers stood guard.  And on the inside of the
stone yard in front of the church, soldiers quietly guarded the low
walls, letting nobody mount.  So that outside, under the old
willow- and pepper-trees, in the hot morning sun, the dense crowd
stood gazing at the church doors.  They were mostly men in big
hats; but some townsmen were there, and some women, and Kate with a
parasol lined with dark blue.  A close, silent, tense throng under
the spangled shade, pressing round the trunks of the palm-trees,
climbing on the roots of the pepper-trees.  And behind were the
camiones and the motorcars drawn up.</p>

<p>The drum shuddered and went still, and the earthen flute was
silent.  The lake could be heard lapping, and a clink of glasses
and a sound of chauffeurs' voices at the little cantina-booth.  For
the rest, the silent breathing of the crowd. - Soldiers were quickly
distributing a few leaflets among the crowd.  A strong, far-
carrying male voice began to sing to the softened thud of the drum.</p>

<p>While this was singing, another boat had arrived, and soldiers made
way through the crowd for Ram&oacute;n, in his white serape with the blue
edges and scarlet fringe, and a young priest of the church in a
black cassock, and six men in dark serapes with the blue borders of
Quetzalcoatl.  This strange procession marched through the crowd
and through the gateways of the yard.</p>

<p>As they approached, the ring of men round the drum opened, and
spread into a crescent.  Ram&oacute;n stood tall behind the drum, the six
men in dark serapes divided and went to the wings of the crescent,
the young, slim priest in a black cassock stood alone, in front of
the crescent, facing the crowd.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand; Ram&oacute;n took off his hat; all the men in the
crowd took off their hats.</p>

<p>The priest turned, met Ram&oacute;n at the centre of the crescent, and,
across the drum, handed him the key of the church.  Then the priest
waited.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n unlocked the church doors and flung them open.  The men in
front of the crowd kneeled down suddenly, seeing the church dark
like a cavern, but a trembling blaze of many candles, away,
seemingly far down the mysterious darkness, shuddering with dark,
rippling flame, like the Presence of the burning bush.</p>

<p>The crowd swayed and rustled, and subsided, kneeling.  Only here
and there a labourer, a chauffeur or a railway man stood erect.</p>

<p>The priest raised his hand a little higher, re-turning towards the
people.</p>

<p>'My children,' he said; and as he spoke the lake seemed to rustle;
'God the Almighty has called home His Son, and the Holy Mother of
the Son.  Their days are over in Mexico.  They go back to the
Father.</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>Jesus, the Son of God, bids you farewell.<br />
Mary, the Mother of God, bids you farewell.<br />
For the last time they bless you, as they leave you.<br />
Answer Adi&oacute;s!<br />
Say Adi&oacute;s! my children.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The men in the circle said a deep Adi&oacute;s!  And from the soldiers,
and from the kneeling crowd, a ragged, muttered, strange repeating
of Adi&oacute;s! again and again, like a sort of storm.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in a blast, down the darkness of the church into which
the kneeling people were staring, the burning bush of candles was
gone, there was only darkness.  Across the sunshine, lit here and
there by a frail light of a taper, was a cave of darkness.</p>

<p>Men in the crowd exclaimed and groaned.</p>

<p>Then the drum softly touched, and two men in the crescent began to
sing, in magnificent, terrible voices, the Farewell Hymn again.
They were men whom Ram&oacute;n, or his followers, had found in low
drinking-dens in Mexico City, men with trained and amazing voices,
the powerful Mexican tenor that seemed to tear the earth open.  Men
whom the 'times' have reduced to singing in low city dives.  And
now they sang with all the terrible desperation that was in them,
the hopeless, demonish recklessness.</p>

<p>When they finished, the priest again lifted his hand, and gave the
benediction; adding in a quiet voice:</p>

<p>'And now, with all the saints, let Me go, saith Jesus.  For I go
back to my Father which is in heaven, and I lead my Mother in my
right hand, home to peace.'</p>

<p>He turned and went into the church.  Ram&oacute;n followed.  Then slowly,
all the men of the crescent.  Overhead the church bell rang a
little while, on the deathly silence.  It ceased.</p>

<p>And in a moment, from the depths of the church sounded a drum, with
a remote, fearsome thud, and a slow monotony.</p>

<p>The priest, in his white vestments with rich lace, appeared in the
doorway of the church, bearing a tall crucifix.  He hesitated, then
came into the sun.  The kneeling people clasped their hands.</p>

<p>Candles in the dark church were clustering towards the door, lonely
flames.  Don Ram&oacute;n came out of the dark, naked to the waist, his
serape over one shoulder, bearing the front pole of the great bier
whereon lies, within a glass case, the lifelike, terrible dead
Christ of Holy Week.  A tall, dark man, naked to the waist, held
the other end of the pole on his shoulder.  The crowd moaned and
crossed themselves.  The lifelike Dead Christ seemed really dead,
as he passed the gate.  As He entered the crowd, kneeling men and
women lifted sightless faces and flung their arms wide apart, and
so remained, arms rigid and outflung, in an unspeakable ecstasy of
fear, supplication, acknowledgement of death.</p>

<p>After the bier of the Dead Christ, a slow procession of men naked
to the waist, carrying litter after litter.  First the terrible
scourged Christ, with naked body striped like a tiger with blood.
Then the image of the Saviour of the Sacred Heart, the well-known
figure from the side altar, with long hair and outstretched hands.
Then the image of Jesus of Nazareth, with a crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Then the Virgin with the blue mantle and lace, and the golden
crown.  The women began to moan as she emerged rather trashily into
the blazing sunlight.  Behind her, in the church, the candles were
one by one going out.</p>

<p>Then came brown Saint Anthony of Padua, with a child in his arms.
Then Saint Francis, looking strangely at a cross in his hand.  Then
Saint Anna.  And last, Saint Joaquin.  And as he emerged, the last
candles in the dark church went out, there were only open doors
upon a darkness.</p>

<p>The images on the shoulders of the brown-skinned men rode rather
childishly out through the blazing sun, into the shadow of trees.
The drum followed last, slowly thudding.  On the glass case of the
big Dead Christ the sun flashed with startling flashes, as the
powerful men carrying it turned towards the water.  The crowd
murmured and swayed on its knees.  Women cried:  Pur&iacute;sima!
Pur&iacute;sima!  Don't leave us! and some men ejaculated in strangled
anguish, over and over again:  Se&ntilde;or!  Se&ntilde;or!  Se&ntilde;or!</p>

<p>But the strange procession made its way slowly under the trees, to
the coarse sands, and descended again into the great light towards
the lake.  There was a little breeze under a blaze of sun.  Folded
serapes on naked, soft shoulders swung unevenly, the images rocked
and tottered a little.  But onwards to the edge of the water went
the tall crucifix, then the flashing glass box.  And after, came
Jesus in a red silk robe, fluttering, then a wooden Jesus all paint
and streaks, then Jesus in white with a purple mantle that blew
like a kerchief, Mary in lace that fluttered upon stiff white and
blue satin.  But the Saints were only painted; painted wood.</p>

<p>The slim, lace-smocked priest staggered down the sand under the
heavy crucifix, which had a white Christ Crucified stretched aloft,
facing the lake.  By the little wall was a large black canoa,
sailing boat, with a broad plank gangway up to her stern.  Two
bare-legged, white-clad men walked by the slim priest, whose white
sleeves blew like flags as he slowly climbed the gangway to the
ship.  Men helped him on board, and he walked away to the prow,
where at length he stood the big crucifix, with the Christ still
facing outwards.</p>

<p>The ship was open, without deck or hatches, but with fixed tables
for the images.  Slowly Ram&oacute;n ascended and descended into the boat,
the great glass case was laid down on its rest, the two men could
wipe their wet brows and their hot, black hair.  Ram&oacute;n put on his
blanket and his hat, against the sun.  The boat heaved very
slightly.  The wind was from the west.  The lake was pale and
unreal, sun-blinded.</p>

<p>One after another the images rose over the stern of the boat,
against the sky, then descended into the vessel, to be set down on
their rests, where they rose above the black sides of the canoa, in
view of the throng on the shore.</p>

<p>It was a strange and tawdry collection of images.  And yet, each
image had a certain pathos of its own, and a certain touch of
horror, as they were grouped together for their last ride, upon the
trestle-supports, within the vessels.  By each image stood the
bearers, in hats and serapes, keeping a steady hand on the poles.</p>

<p>There was a little line of soldiers on the shore, and three motor-
boats with soldiers waited by the big canoa.  The shore was covered
with a mass of people.  Many row-boats came rowing inquisitively
round, like fishes.  But none came too near.</p>

<p>Bare-legged sailors began to pole the ship from the shore.  They
leaned heavily on the poles, and walked along the rims of the
vessel.  Slowly she began to move upon the waters, in the shallows.
Slowly she was leaving the shore, and the throng.</p>

<p>Two other sailors swiftly began to hoist the huge, square white
sail.  Quickly, yet heavily it rose in the air, and took the wind.
It had the great sign of Quetzalcoatl, the circling blue snake and
the blue eagle upon a yellow field, at the centre, like a great
eye.</p>

<p>The wind came from the west, but the boat was steering south-east,
for the little Island of the Scorpions, which rose like a small dim
hummock from the haze of the lake.  So the sail reached out, and
the great eye seemed to be glancing back, at the village with the
green willows and the empty white church, the throng on the shore.</p>

<p>Motor-boats circled the huge, slow canoe, small boats like insects
followed and ranged round at a distance, never coming too close.
The running water clucked and spoke, the men by the images steadied
the poles with one hand, their hats with the other, the great eye
on the sail ever looked back at the land, the sweep of the white
canvas sweeping low above the glass case of death, the Christ caked
with gore, the images in their fluttering mantles.</p>

<p>On the shore, the people wandered away, or sat on the sands waiting
and watching in a sort of dumb patience that was half indifference.
The canoe grew smaller, more inconspicuous, lapsing into the light,
the little boats circled around it like mere dots.  The lake tired
the eyes with its light.</p>

<p>Away under the trees, in a half silence, a half vacancy, a woman
bought a dark water-melon, smashed it open on a stone, and gave the
big pinky fragments to her children.  In silence, men sprinkled
salt on the thick slice of cucumber sold by the woman under the
tree.  In silence they wandered into the church, past the soldiers
on guard at the door.</p>

<p>The church was absolutely dark, save for the light that entered the
doorway, and absolutely bare; walls, floor, altar, transepts, all
stark bare and empty.  The people wandered away again, in silence.</p>

<p>It was noon, and a hot day.  The canoa slowly ranged to the small
hummock of the island amid the waters, where lived one family of
Indians - fishers, with a few goats and one dry little place where
they grew a few beans and heads of maize.  For the rest, the island
was all dry rock and thorny bushes, and scorpions.</p>

<p>The vessel was poled round to the one rocky bay.  Slowly she drew
near the island.  The motor-boats and the little boats hurried
ahead.  Already brown, naked men were bathing among the rocks.</p>

<p>The great sail sank, the canoa edged up to the rocky shore, men
sprang from her into the water, the images were lowered and slowly
carried on to the rocks.  There they waited for the bearers.</p>

<p>Slowly the procession went again up the bank of the dishevelled
island, past the couple of huts, where a red cock was crowing among
the litter, and over to rocks, beyond the bushes, on the far side.</p>

<p>The side facing Sayula was all rock, naked and painful to tread on.
In a rocky hollow at the water's edge, tall stones had been put up
on end, with iron bars across the top, like a grill.  Underneath, a
pile of faggots ready; and at the side, a pile of faggots.</p>

<p>The images, the glass box of the great Dead Christ, were laid on
the iron bars of the grill, in a pathetic cluster all together.
The crucifix was leaned against them.  It was noon, the heat and
the light were fierce and erect.  But already down the lake clouds
were pushing up fantastically.</p>

<p>Beyond the water, beyond the glare, the village looked like a
mirage, with its trees and villages and white church towers.</p>

<p>Men who had come in boats crowded on the rocks of the little
amphitheatre.  In silence, Ram&oacute;n kindled shreds of cane and ocote,
with a burning-glass.  Little hasty flames like young snakes arose
in the solid sunlight, with vapour of smoke.  He set fire to the
carefully-arranged pyramid of faggots beneath the grill-table of
the images.</p>

<p>There was a crackling, and a puffing of whitish smoke, the sweet
scent of ocote, and orange-red tongues of half-substantial flame
were leaping up in the hot white air.  Hot breaths blew suddenly,
sudden flames gushed up, and the ocote, full of sweet resin, began
to roar.  The glass of the great box emitted strange, painful yelps
as it splintered and fell tinkling.  Between the iron bars,
brownish flames pushed up among the images, which at once went
black.  The little vestments of silk and satin withered in a moment
to blackness, the caked wounds of paint bubbled black.</p>

<p>The young priest took off his linen vestment, his stole, and his
chasuble, and with flushed face flung them in the flame.  Then he
stripped off his black cassock, and emerged in the white cotton of
the men of Quetzalcoatl, his white drawers rolled up to the knee.
He threw his cassock in the fire.  Someone handed him a big hat,
and a white serape with blue ends.</p>

<p>There was a smell of burning paint, and wool, and ocote.  The fire
rushed in a dusky mass upon the blackened, flickering images, till
nothing was to be seen but a confused bush of smoke and brown-red
flames, puthering, reeking, roaring.  The flaming crucifix slipped
aside, and fell.  A man seized it and pushed it into the fire,
under the images.  Men in a sort of ecstasy threw on more of the
heavy, resinous wood, that almost exploded into flame.  Rocks
cracked and exploded like guns.  Everybody drew back from that
roaring tree of flame, which rose ever higher and higher, its dark
smoke and its sparks unfolding into heaven.</p>

<p>One of the supporting stones burst with a bang, bars of iron and
blazing stumps of images tumbled in a confused roar.  The glass
case had disappeared, but ribbons of iron waved, then curled over
red, into the torrent of the sudden fire.  Strange rods of iron
appeared out of nowhere, protruding from solid red coals.</p>

<p>And soon, all that was left was a fierce glow of red coals of wood,
with a medley of half-fused iron.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n stood aside and watched in silence, his dark brow quite
expressionless.</p>

<p>Then, when only the last bluish flames flickered out of a tumble of
red fire, from the eminence above rockets began to shoot into the
air with a swish, exploding high in the sightless hot blue, with a
glimmer of bluish showers, and of gold.</p>

<p>The people from the shore had seen the tree of smoke with its trunk
of flame.  Now they heard the heavy firing of the rockets, they
looked again, exclaiming, half in dismay, half in the joyful lust
of destruction:</p>

<p>'Se&ntilde;or!  Se&ntilde;or!  La Pur&iacute;sima!  La Sant&iacute;sima!'</p>

<p>The flame and the smoke and the rockets melted as if by miracle,
into nothingness, leaving the hot air unblemished.  The coals of
fire were shovelled and dropped down a steep hole.</p>

<p>As the canoa sailed back, the side of the lake, through filmy air,
looked brownish and changeless.  A cloud was rising in the south-
west, from behind the dry, silent mountains, like a vast white
tail, like the vast white fleecy tail of some squirrel, that had
just dived out of sight behind the mountains.  This wild white tail
fleeced up and up, to the zenith, straight at the sun.  And as the
canoa spread her sail to tack back, already a delicate film of
shadow was over the chalk-white lake.</p>

<p>Only on the low end of the isle of Scorpions, hot air still
quivered.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n returned in one of the motor-boats.  Slowly the sky was
clouding for the thunder and the rain.  The canoa, unable to make
her way across, was sailing for Tuliapan.  The little boats hurried
in silence.</p>

<p>They landed before the wind rose.  Ram&oacute;n went and locked the doors
of the church.</p>

<p>The crowd scattered in the wind, rebozos waving wildly, leaves
torn, dust racing.  Sayula was empty of God, and, at heart, they
were glad.</p>
