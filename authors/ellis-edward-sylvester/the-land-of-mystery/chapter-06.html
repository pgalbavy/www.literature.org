<p>If any further proof were needed of the delicacy and danger of
the situation of the white men, it came the next minute, when,
as they were in the act of stepping back into the trail, the sailor
caught the arm of his friend and checked him.</p>

<p>No need of speaking, for Ashman had detected the peril at the
same instant.</p>

<p>Two natives were stealing like phantoms along the path, from
the direction of the river and going toward the village.</p>

<p>Had they been ten seconds later, the foremost would have collided
with the young explorer.</p>

<p>The latter held his breath, and placed his hand on his revolver,
believing a fight was inevitable.</p>

<p>So it would have been, had not the attention of the savages been
absorbed by the scene in the square, of which they caught sight
a pace or two before coming opposite the watchers.</p>

<p>They strode directly onward, and swung across the open space,
swerving enough to one side to avoid the struggling lines, and
moving on until they reached the fringe of spectators beyond. 
There they could no longer be identified, and probably took their
places among those who were enjoying the cruel spectacle.</p>

<p>Ashman waited a brief while beside the path, fearful that other
natives might be coming; but, when the minutes passed without
their appearance, he resumed picking his way back, and quickly
stood erect in the narrow opening, which he felt had been followed
too far from the Xingu.</p>

<p>There was no reason to suspect that any of the natives knew of
the presence of the mysterious strangers so near them, but since
they seemed to have a remarkable disposition to be on the move,
our friends felt it would not be safe to relax their caution for
a single instant.</p>

<p>While they did not apprehend a direct pursuit, there was a probability
that some parties might be moving along the trail behind them,
while they had seen enough to convince them of the danger from
the front. Ashman, therefore, whispered to his companion to keep
special guard against an approach from the rear, while he would
be equally alert in guarding the front.</p>

<p>The two kept so near that they could have reached each other
by simply extending the hand.</p>

<p>They had no more than fairly started on their withdrawal from
the spot, when Johnston touched the arm of his friend, who instantly
halted to learn the cause.</p>

<p>"I believe some of 'em are following us," said Johnston.</p>

<p>Fred listened, but his straining ear could detect nothing to
warrant such an alarming conclusion, and he so stated.</p>

<p>The sailor became convinced that possibly he was mistaken.  There
is no law governing noises at night, and it might be that he had
misjudged the rustling of a branch or possibly the stealthy footsteps
of some wild animal.</p>

<p>Not entirely convinced, however, that his companion was mistaken,
Fred once more resumed the advance, trying to perform the difficult
task of giving as much attention to the rear as the front.</p>

<p>If the savages suspected the presence of others, they would be
likely to tread so lightly that their footfalls could not be heard;
but inasmuch as neither of the whites could believe they had even
the most shadowy knowledge of them, they relied more on hearing
than sight.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fred started and almost uttered an exclamation.  In
his nervous, apprehensive state, he was sure that one of their
dusky foes had leaped from the side of the path and was crouching
in front.</p>

<p>He drew his pistol and waited for the assault, which he was confident
would come the next moment; but the seconds passed and all remained
profoundly still.</p>

<p>With his weapon ready for instant use, he advanced a pace or
two, touching the sailor as a command for him to remain motionless;
but the chivalrous fellow would not obey, and was close behind
him, when he stooped down and placed his hand on a piece of decayed
limb that had fallen into the path.</p>

<p>"What a mistake," muttered Fred, with a sigh, as he shoved it
aside with his foot, explaining its nature to the wondering Johnston.</p>

<p>But it was only simple prudence to maintain unceasing vigilance,
and he did not permit the error to lessen his watchfulness.  It
was rather the reverse.</p>

<p>But the explorers were threading their way through a labyrinth
of peril, the like of which they had never encountered before.</p>

<p>Fred had not gone a hundred yards further, when his companion
once more caught his arm, and he turned about as before to learn
the cause.</p>

<p>"What have you heard?" he asked, with his mouth almost against
the ear of the other.</p>

<p>"There are some of 'em behind us, certain sure!"</p>

<p>"How do you know there are more than one?"</p>

<p>"By the sound&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>The amazement of the two may be understood, when they not only
detected the sound of footfalls, but discovered that instead of
being at the rear as both thought, they were in front!</p>

<p>A party of natives were approaching from the Xingu, and the keener
hearing of Johnston first discovered them.</p>

<p>The whites had stopped near a spot where a few rays of moonlight
fell upon the trail, giving them a faint but needed view of the
direction from which the danger threatened.</p>

<p>Neither spoke again, but with the utmost care and noiselessness,
they stepped aside from the path and crouched among the undergrowth.</p>

<p>They had barely time to ensconce themselves in their new position,
when the footfalls sounded more distinctly than before, and something
in the nature of an exclamation was heard from one of the approaching
savages.</p>

<p>It sounded more like the grunt of a pig than anything the listeners
could call to mind, and Ashman feared it was notice of one warrior
to his companions that he had discovered something amiss.</p>

<p>But if such were the fact, the natives would have stopped, while
the cat-like steps were more audible than before, though the wonder
to the watchers was that the parties continued invisible.</p>

<p>The eyes of both remained fixed on the faintly illuminated space,
where they expected to catch sight of them, but the straining
gaze failed to detect the most shadowy form.</p>

<p>Ashman was just beginning to suspect some strange mistake had
been made, when he suddenly saw the form of a tall savage with
bushy head and a javelin in his hand, glide like a shadow into
the darkness in front.  A moment after, a second followed, then
a third, fourth and fifth, the last carrying a long-bow, and all
plainly seen by the whites at the side of the trail.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Fred once more took the advance, reflecting
that they were as likely to meet more of the natives as to have
them overtake them.</p>

<p>The mystery was where they had come from in the first place. 
They could not have entered the trail at the camp where Ashman
and Johnston had started on their little exploring enterprise. 
It looked as though they were hiding among the trees at the time
the canoe approached the land, and may have followed the explorers
soon after they started along the path with the purpose of cutting
off their retreat.  If such should prove to be the case, Fred
felt that not only he and his companion were in danger, but all
the rest were liable to be attacked by these natives, who, as
has been stated, were the most athletic that had been encountered
since leaving the Amazon.</p>

<p>"Fred," whispered the sailor a little later, "they've turned
back and are following us again."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"There's no mistake about it."</p>

<p>Fred was debating whether they should not turn again from the
path, but he reflected that the natives having discovered the
trick played on them, would be likely to defeat such a piece of
strategy.</p>

<p>Before he could decide upon the best course, Johnston whispered:</p>

<p>"Run! it's the only chance we've got!"</p>
