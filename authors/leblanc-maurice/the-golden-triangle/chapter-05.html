<p>The accomplices started, as though they had received an electric shock.
Bournef darted forward:
</p><p>"What did you say?"
</p><p>"I said four millions, which means a million for each of you."
</p><p>"Look here! . . . Do you mean it? . . . Four millions? . . ."
</p><p>"Four millions is what I said."
</p><p>The figure was so gigantic and the proposal so utterly unexpected that
the accomplices had the same feeling which Patrice Belval on his side
underwent. They suspected a trap; and Bournef could not help saying:
</p><p>"The offer is more than we expected. . . . And I am wondering what
induced you to make it."
</p><p>"Would you have been satisfied with less?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Bournef, candidly.
</p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't make it less. I have only one means of escaping
death; and that is to open my safe for you. And my safe contains four
bundles of a thousand bank-notes each."
</p><p>Bournef could not get over his astonishment and became more and more
suspicious.
</p><p>"How do you know that, after taking the four millions, we shall not
insist on more?"
</p><p>"Insist on what? The secret of the site?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Because you know that I would as soon die as tell it you. The four
millions are the maximum. Do you want them or don't you? I ask for no
promise in return, no oath of any kind, for I am convinced that, when
you have filled your pockets, you will have but one thought, to clear
off, without handicapping yourselves with a murder which might prove
your undoing."
</p><p>The argument was so unanswerable that Bournef ceased discussing and
asked:
</p><p>"Is the safe in this room?"
</p><p>"Yes, between the first and second windows, behind my portrait."
</p><p>Bournef took down the picture and said:
</p><p>"I see nothing."
</p><p>"It's all right. The lines of the safe are marked by the moldings of the
central panel. In the middle you will see what looks like a rose, not of
wood but of iron; and there are four others at the four corners of the
panel. These four turn to the right, by successive notches, forming a
word which is the key to the lock, the word Cora."
</p><p>"The first four letters of Coralie?" asked Bournef, following Essarès'
instructions as he spoke.
</p><p>"No," said Essarès Bey, "the first four letters of the Coran. Have you
done that?"
</p><p>After a moment, Bournef answered:
</p><p>"Yes, I've finished. And the key?"
</p><p>"There's no key. The fifth letter of the word, the letter N, is the
letter of the central rose."
</p><p>Bournef turned this fifth rose; and presently a click was heard.
</p><p>"Now pull," said Essarès. "That's it. The safe is not deep: it's dug in
one of the stones of the front wall. Put in your hand. You'll find four
pocket-books."
</p><p>It must be admitted that Patrice Belval expected to see something
startling interrupt Bournef's quest and hurl him into some pit suddenly
opened by Essarès' trickery. And the three confederates seemed to share
this unpleasant apprehension, for they were gray in the face, while
Bournef himself appeared to be working very cautiously and suspiciously.
</p><p>At last he turned round and came and sat beside Essarès. In his hands he
held a bundle of four pocket-books, short but extremely bulky and bound
together with a canvas strap. He unfastened the buckle of the strap and
opened one of the pocket-books.
</p><p>His knees shook under their precious burden, and, when he had taken a
huge sheaf of notes from one of the compartments, his hands were like
the hands of a very old man trembling with fever.
</p><p>"Thousand-franc notes," he murmured. "Ten packets of thousand-franc
notes."
</p><p>Brutally, like men prepared to fight one another, each of the other
three laid hold of a pocket-book, felt inside and mumbled:
</p><p>"Ten packets . . . they're all there. . . . Thousand-franc notes . . ."
</p><p>And one of them forthwith cried, in a choking voice:
</p><p>"Let's clear out! . . . Let's go!"
</p><p>A sudden fear was sending them off their heads. They could not imagine
that Essarès would hand over such a fortune to them unless he had some
plan which would enable him to recover it before they had left the room.
That was a certainty. The ceiling would come down on their heads. The
walls would close up and crush them to death, while sparing their
unfathomable adversary.
</p><p>Nor had Patrice Belval any doubt of it. The disaster was preparing.
Essarès' revenge was inevitably at hand. A man like him, a fighter as
able as he appeared to be, does not so easily surrender four million
francs if he has not some scheme at the back of his head. Patrice felt
himself breathing heavily. His present excitement was more violent than
any with which he had thrilled since the very beginning of the tragic
scenes which he had been witnessing; and he saw that Coralie's face was
as anxious as his own.
</p><p>Meanwhile Bournef partially recovered his composure and, holding back
his companions, said:
</p><p>"Don't be such fools! He would be capable, with old Siméon, of releasing
himself and running after us."
</p><p>Using only one hand, for the other was clutching a pocket-book, all four
fastened Essarès' arm to the chair, while he protested angrily:
</p><p>"You idiots! You came here to rob me of a secret of immense importance,
as you well knew, and you lose your heads over a trifle of four
millions. Say what you like, the colonel had more backbone than that!"
</p><p>They gagged him once more and Bournef gave him a smashing blow with his
fist which laid him unconscious.
</p><p>"That makes our retreat safe," said Bournef.
</p><p>"What about the colonel?" asked one of the others. "Are we to leave him
here?"
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>But apparently he thought this unwise; for he added:
</p><p>"On second thoughts, no. It's not to our interest to compromise Essarès
any further. What we must do, Essarès as well as ourselves, is to make
ourselves scarce as fast as we can, before that damned letter of the
colonel's is delivered at headquarters, say before twelve o'clock in the
day."
</p><p>"Then what do you suggest?"
</p><p>"We'll take the colonel with us in the motor and drop him anywhere. The
police must make what they can of it."
</p><p>"And his papers?"
</p><p>"We'll look through his pockets as we go. Lend me a hand."
</p><p>They bandaged the wound to stop the flow of blood, took up the body,
each holding it by an arm or leg, and walked out without any one of them
letting go his pocket-book for a second.
</p><p>Patrice Belval heard them pass through another room and then tramp
heavily over the echoing flags of a hall.
</p><p>"This is the moment," he said. "Essarès or Siméon will press a button
and the rogues will be nabbed."
</p><p>Essarès did not budge.
</p><p>Siméon did not budge.
</p><p>Patrice heard all the sounds accompanying their departure: the slamming
of the carriage-gate, the starting-up of the engine and the drone of the
car as it moved away. And that was all. Nothing had happened. The
confederates were getting off with their four millions.
</p><p>A long silence followed, during which Patrice remained on tenterhooks.
He did not believe that the drama had reached its last phase; and he was
so much afraid of the unexpected which might still occur that he
determined to make Coralie aware of his presence.
</p><p>A fresh incident prevented him. Coralie had risen to her feet.
</p><p>Her face no longer wore its expression of horror and affright, but
Patrice was perhaps more scared at seeing her suddenly animated with a
sinister energy that gave an unwonted sparkle to her eyes and set her
eyebrows and her lips twitching. He realized that Coralie was preparing
to act.
</p><p>In what way? Was this the end of the tragedy?
</p><p>She walked to the corner on her side of the gallery where one of the two
spiral staircases stood and went down slowly, without, however, trying
to deaden the sound of her feet. Her husband could not help hearing her.
Patrice, moreover, saw in the mirror that he had lifted his head and was
following her with his eyes.
</p><p>She stopped at the foot of the stairs. But there was no indecision in
her attitude. Her plan was obviously quite clear; and she was only
thinking out the best method of putting it into execution.
</p><p>"Ah!" whispered Patrice to himself, quivering all over. "What are you
doing, Little Mother Coralie?"
</p><p>He gave a start. The direction in which Coralie's eyes were turned,
together with the strange manner in which they stared, revealed her
secret resolve to him. She had caught sight of the dagger, lying on the
floor where it had slipped from the colonel's grasp.
</p><p>Not for a second did Patrice believe that she meant to pick up that
dagger with any other thought than to stab her husband. The intention of
murder was so plainly written on her livid features that, even before
she stirred a limb, Essarès was seized with a fit of terror and strained
every muscle to break the bonds that hampered his movements.
</p><p>She came forward, stopped once more and, suddenly bending, seized the
dagger. Without waiting, she took two more steps. These brought her to
the right of the chair in which Essarès lay. He had only to turn his
head a little way to see her. And an awful minute passed, during which
the husband and wife looked into each other's eyes.
</p><p>The whirl of thoughts, of fear, of hatred, of vagrant and conflicting
passions that passed through the brains of her who was about to kill and
him who was about to die, was reproduced in Patrice Belval's mind and
deep down in his inner consciousness. What was he to do? What part ought
he to play in the tragedy that was being enacted before his eyes? Should
he intervene? Was it his duty to prevent Coralie from committing the
irreparable deed? Or should he commit it himself by breaking the man's
head with a bullet from his revolver?
</p><p>Yet, from the beginning, Patrice had really been swayed by a feeling
which, mingling with all the others, gradually paralyzed him and
rendered any inward struggle illusory: a feeling of curiosity driven to
its utmost pitch. It was not the everyday curiosity of unearthing a
squalid secret, but the higher curiosity of penetrating the mysterious
soul of a woman whom he loved, who was carried away by the rush of
events and who suddenly, becoming once more mistress of herself, was of
her own accord and with impressive calmness taking the most fearful
resolution. Thereupon other questions forced themselves upon him. What
prompted her to take this resolution? Was it revenge? Was it punishment?
Was it the gratification of hatred?
</p><p>Patrice Belval remained where he was.
</p><p>Coralie raised her arm. Her husband, in front of her, no longer even
attempted to make those movements of despair which indicate a last
effort. There was neither entreaty nor menace in his eyes. He waited in
resignation.
</p><p>Not far from them, old Siméon, still bound, half-lifted himself on his
elbows and stared at them in dismay.
</p><p>Coralie raised her arm again. Her whole frame seemed to grow larger and
taller. An invisible force appeared to strengthen and stiffen her whole
being, summoning all her energies to the service of her will. She was on
the point of striking. Her eyes sought the place at which she should
strike.
</p><p>Yet her eyes became less hard and less dark. It even seemed to Patrice
that there was a certain hesitation in her gaze and that she was
recovering not her usual gentleness, but a little of her womanly grace.
</p><p>"Ah, Little Mother Coralie," murmured Patrice, "you are yourself again!
You are the woman I know. Whatever right you may think you have to kill
that man, you will not kill him . . . and I prefer it so."
</p><p>Slowly Coralie's arm dropped to her side. Her features relaxed. Patrice
could guess the immense relief which she felt at escaping from the
obsessing purpose that was driving her to murder. She looked at her
dagger with astonishment, as though she were waking from a hideous
nightmare. And, bending over her husband she began to cut his bonds.
</p><p>She did so with visible repugnance, avoiding his touch, as it were, and
shunning his eyes. The cords were severed one by one. Essarès was free.
</p><p>What happened next was in the highest measure unexpected. With not a
word of thanks to his wife, with not a word of anger either, this man
who had just undergone the most cruel torture and whose body still
throbbed with pain hurriedly tottered barefoot to a telephone standing
on a table. He was like a hungry man who suddenly sees a piece of bread
and snatches at it greedily as the means of saving himself and returning
to life. Panting for breath, Essarès took down the receiver and called
out:
</p><p>"Central 40.39."
</p><p>Then he turned abruptly to his wife:
</p><p>"Go away," he said.
</p><p>She seemed not to hear. She had knelt down beside old Siméon and was
setting him free also.
</p><p>Essarès at the telephone began to lose patience:
</p><p>"Are you there? . . . Are you there? . . . I want that number to-day,
please, not next week! It's urgent. . . . 40.39. . . . It's urgent, I
tell you!"
</p><p>And, turning to Coralie, he repeated, in an imperious tone:
</p><p>"Go away!"
</p><p>She made a sign that she would not go away and that, on the contrary,
she meant to listen. He shook his fist at her and again said:
</p><p>"Go away, go away! . . . I won't have you stay in the room. You go away
too, Siméon."
</p><p>Old Siméon got up and moved towards Essarès. It looked as though he
wished to speak, no doubt to protest. But his action was undecided; and,
after a moment's reflection, he turned to the door and went without
uttering a word.
</p><p>"Go away, will you, go away!" Essarès repeated, his whole body
expressing menace.
</p><p>But Coralie came nearer to him and crossed her arms obstinately and
defiantly. At that moment, Essarès appeared to get his call, for he
asked:
</p><p>"Is that 40.39? Ah, yes . . ."
</p><p>He hesitated. Coralie's presence obviously displeased him greatly, and
he was about to say things which he did not wish her to know. But time,
no doubt, was pressing. He suddenly made up his mind and, with both
receivers glued to his ears, said, in English:
</p><p>"Is that you, Grégoire? . . . Essarès speaking. . . . Hullo! . . . Yes,
I'm speaking from the Rue Raynouard. . . . There's no time to lose.
. . . Listen. . . ."
</p><p>He sat down and went on:
</p><p>"Look here. Mustapha's dead. So is the colonel. . . . Damn it, don't
interrupt, or we're done for! . . . Yes, done for; and you too. . . .
Listen, they all came, the colonel, Bournef, the whole gang, and robbed
me by means of violence and threats. . . . I finished the colonel, only
he had written to the police, giving us all away. The letter will be
delivered soon. So you understand, Bournef and his three ruffians are
going to disappear. They'll just run home and pack up their papers; and
I reckon they'll be with you in an hour, or two hours at most. It's the
refuge they're sure to make for. They prepared it themselves, without
suspecting that you and I know each other. So there's no doubt about it.
They're sure to come. . . ."
</p><p>Essarès stopped. He thought for a moment and resumed:
</p><p>"You still have a second key to each of the rooms which they use as
bedrooms? Is that so? . . . Good. And you have duplicates of the keys
that open the cupboards in the walls of those rooms, haven't you? . . .
Capital. Well, as soon as they get to sleep, or rather as soon as you
are certain that they are sound asleep, go in and search the cupboards.
Each of them is bound to hide his share of the booty there. You'll find
it quite easily. It's the four pocket-books which you know of. Put them
in your bag, clear out as fast as you can and join me."
</p><p>There was another pause. This time it was Essarès listening. He replied:
</p><p>"What's that you say? Rue Raynouard? Here? Join me here? Why, you must
be mad! Do you imagine that I can stay now, after the colonel's given me
away? No, go and wait for me at the hotel, near the station. I shall be
there by twelve o'clock or one in the afternoon, perhaps a little later.
Don't be uneasy. Have your lunch quietly and we'll talk things over
. . . Hullo! Did you hear? . . . Very well, I'll see that everything's
all right. Good-by for the present."
</p><p>The conversation was finished; and it looked as if Essarès, having taken
all his measures to recover possession of the four million francs, had
no further cause for anxiety. He hung up the receiver, went back to the
lounge-chair in which he had been tortured, wheeled it round with its
back to the fire, sat down, turned down the bottoms of his trousers and
pulled on his socks and shoes, all a little painfully and accompanied by
a few grimaces, but calmly, in the manner of a man who has no need to
hurry.
</p><p>Coralie kept her eyes fixed on his face.
</p><p>"I really ought to go," thought Captain Belval, who felt a trifle
embarrassed at the thought of overhearing what the husband and wife were
about to say.
</p><p>Nevertheless he stayed. He was not comfortable in his mind on Coralie's
account.
</p><p>Essarès fired the first shot:
</p><p>"Well," he asked, "what are you looking at me like that for?"
</p><p>"So it's true?" she murmured, maintaining her attitude of defiance. "You
leave me no possibility of doubt?"
</p><p>"Why should I lie?" he snarled. "I should not have telephoned in your
hearing if I hadn't been sure that you were here all the time."
</p><p>"I was up there."
</p><p>"Then you heard everything?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And saw everything?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And, seeing the torture which they inflicted on me and hearing my
cries, you did nothing to defend me, to defend me against torture,
against death!"
</p><p>"No, for I knew the truth."
</p><p>"What truth?"
</p><p>"The truth which I suspected without daring to admit it."
</p><p>"What truth?" he repeated, in a louder voice.
</p><p>"The truth about your treason."
</p><p>"You're mad. I've committed no treason."
</p><p>"Oh, don't juggle with words! I confess that I don't know the whole
truth: I did not understand all that those men said or what they were
demanding of you. But the secret which they tried to force from you was
a treasonable secret."
</p><p>"A man can only commit treason against his country," he said, shrugging
his shoulders. "I'm not a Frenchman."
</p><p>"You were a Frenchman!" she cried. "You asked to be one and you became
one. You married me, a Frenchwoman, and you live in France and you've
made your fortune in France. It's France that you're betraying."
</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense! And for whose benefit?"
</p><p>"I don't know that, either. For months, for years indeed, the colonel,
Bournef, all your former accomplices and yourself have been engaged on
an enormous work--yes, enormous, it's their own word--and now it appears
that you are fighting over the profits of the common enterprise and the
others accuse you of pocketing those profits for yourself alone and of
keeping a secret that doesn't belong to you. So that I seem to see
something dirtier and more hateful even than treachery, something
worthy of a common pickpocket. . . ."
</p><p>The man struck the arm of his chair with his fist:
</p><p>"Enough!" he cried.
</p><p>Coralie seemed in no way alarmed:
</p><p>"Enough," she echoed, "you are right. Enough words between us. Besides,
there is one fact that stands out above everything: your flight. That
amounts to a confession. You're afraid of the police."
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders a second time:
</p><p>"I'm afraid of nobody."
</p><p>"Very well, but you're going."
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then let's have it out. When are you going?"
</p><p>"Presently, at twelve o'clock."
</p><p>"And if you're arrested?"
</p><p>"I sha'n't be arrested."
</p><p>"If you are arrested, however?"
</p><p>"I shall be let go."
</p><p>"At least there will be an inquiry, a trial?"
</p><p>"No, the matter will be hushed up."
</p><p>"You hope so."
</p><p>"I'm sure of it."
</p><p>"God grant it! And you will leave France, of course?"
</p><p>"As soon as I can."
</p><p>"When will that be?"
</p><p>"In a fortnight or three weeks."
</p><p>"Send me word of the day, so that I may know when I can breathe again."
</p><p>"I shall send you word, Coralie, but for another reason."
</p><p>"What reason?"
</p><p>"So that you may join me."
</p><p>"Join you!"
</p><p>He gave a cruel smile:
</p><p>"You are my wife," he said. "Where the husband goes the wife goes; and
you know that, in my religion, the husband has every right over his
wife, including that of life and death. Well, you're my wife."
</p><p>Coralie shook her head, and, in a tone of indescribable contempt,
answered:
</p><p>"I am not your wife. I feel nothing for you but loathing and horror. I
don't wish to see you again, and, whatever happens, whatever you may
threaten, I shall not see you again."
</p><p>He rose, and, walking to her, bent in two, all trembling on his legs, he
shouted, while again he shook his clenched fists at her:
</p><p>"What's that you say? What's that you dare to say? I, I, your lord and
master, order you to join me the moment that I send for you."
</p><p>"I shall not join you. I swear it before God! I swear it as I hope to be
saved."
</p><p>He stamped his feet with rage. His face underwent a hideous contortion;
and he roared:
</p><p>"That means that you want to stay! Yes, you have reasons which I don't
know, but which are easy to guess! An affair of the heart, I suppose.
There's some one in your life, no doubt. . . . Hold your tongue, will
you? . . . Haven't you always detested me? . . . Your hatred does not
date from to-day. It dates back to the first time you saw me, to a time
even before our marriage. . . . We have always lived like mortal
enemies. I loved you. I worshipped you. A word from you would have
brought me to your feet. The mere sound of your steps thrilled me to the
marrow. . . . But your feeling for me is one of horror. And you imagine
that you are going to start a new life, without me? Why, I'd sooner kill
you, my beauty!"
</p><p>He had unclenched his fists; and his open hands were clutching on either
side of Coralie, close to her head, as though around a prey which they
seemed on the point of throttling. A nervous shiver made his jaws clash
together. Beads of perspiration gleamed on his bald head.
</p><p>In front of him, Coralie stood impassive, looking very small and frail.
Patrice Belval, in an agony of suspense and ready at any moment to act,
could read nothing on her calm features but aversion and contempt.
</p><p>Mastering himself at last, Essarès said:
</p><p>"You shall join me, Coralie. Whether you like it or not, I am your
husband. You felt it just now, when the lust to murder me made you take
up a weapon and left you without the courage to carry out your
intention. It will always be like that. Your independent fit will pass
away and you will join the man who is your master."
</p><p>"I shall remain behind to fight against you," she replied, "here, in
this house. The work of treason which you have accomplished I shall
destroy. I shall do it without hatred, for I am no longer capable of
hatred, but I shall do it without intermission, to repair the evil which
you have wrought."
</p><p>He answered, in a low voice:
</p><p>"I <u>am</u> capable of hatred. Beware, Coralie. The very moment when you
believe that you have nothing more to fear will perhaps be the moment
when I shall call you to account. Take care."
</p><p>He pushed an electric bell. Old Siméon appeared.
</p><p>"So the two men-servants have decamped?" asked Essarès. And, without
waiting for the answer, he went on, "A good riddance. The housemaid and
the cook can do all I want. They heard nothing, did they? No, their
bedroom is too far away. No matter, Siméon: you must keep a watch on
them after I am gone."
</p><p>He looked at his wife, surprised to see her still there, and said to his
secretary:
</p><p>"I must be up at six to get everything ready; and I am dead tired. Take
me to my room. You can come back and put out the lights afterwards."
</p><p>He went out, supported by Siméon. Patrice Belval at once perceived that
Coralie had done her best to show no weakness in her husband's presence,
but that she had come to the end of her strength and was unable to walk.
Seized with faintness, she fell on her knees, making the sign of the
cross.
</p><p>When she was able to rise, a few minutes later, she saw on the carpet,
between her and the door, a sheet of note-paper with her name on it. She
picked it up and read:
</p><pre>
      "Little Mother Coralie, the struggle is too much for
      you. Why not appeal to me, your friend? Give a signal
      and I am with you."</pre>
<p>She staggered, dazed by the discovery of the letter and dismayed by
Belval's daring. But, making a last effort to summon up her power of
will, she left the room, without giving the signal for which Patrice was
longing.
