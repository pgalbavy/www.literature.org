<p>Birth of the American Navy&mdash;The Privateers &mdash;Capture of
New Providence, in the Bahamas&mdash;Paul Jones&mdash;A Clever Exploit&mdash;A
Skilful Escape &mdash;Fine Seamanship &mdash;An Audacious Scheme.</p>

<p>When, on April 19, 1775, the battle of Lexington opened the Revolution
the Colonies did not possess a single ship with which to form
the beginning of a navy. They had for many years been actively
engaged in the coasting trade and some of their vessels did valiant
service on the side of England in the wars against France and
Spain. We had a good many hardy, skilled seamen, who formed the
best material from which to man a navy, and before long Congress
undertook the work of building one. That body ordered the construction
of thirteen frigates&mdash;one for each State&mdash;and some of these did
noble work, but by the close of the war few of them were left;
nearly all had been captured or destroyed.</p>

<p>It was far different with the privateers, which were vessels
fitted out by private parties, under the authority of Congress,
to cruise the seas wherever they chose and capture English vessels
wherever they could. When a prize was taken the lucky officers
and crews divided the plunder. It was a very tempting field for
the brave and enterprising Americans and when, in March, 1776,
Congress gave them permission to fit out and sail privateers,
they were quick to use the chance of securing prize money as it
was called. Those swift sailing vessels and their daring crews
sailed out of Salem, Cape Ann, Newburyport, Bristol and other
seacoast towns, and they did not have to hunt long before they
found the richest sort of prizes. In the single year 1776 these
privateers captured 342 British vessels and wrought great havoc
among the English shipping.</p>

<p>In January, 1778, one of these privateers entered the harbor
of New Providence, in the Bahamas, and captured the fort and a
sixteen-gun man-of-war. Many other valiant exploits were performed
and before long some of the more daring privateers boldly crossed
the Atlantic and by their deeds threw the coast of Great Britain
into consternation.</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable of these naval heroes was a young Scotchman,
not quite thirty years old.</p>

<p>[Illustration]</p>

<p>He had been trained in the merchant service and had become a
skilful sailor before he removed to Virginia, where he made his
home. He devotedly loved his adopted country, and, when the war
broke out between the colonies and Great Britain, and the long,
hard struggle for independence began, he was among the very first
to offer his services on the side of liberty. His character was
so well known and appreciated that he was appointed a first lieutenant.
I am sure you have all heard of him, for his name was John Paul
Jones, though since, for some reason or other, he dropped his
first name and is generally referred to simply as Paul Jones.</p>

<p>His first service was on the <em>Alfred</em>, which helped in
the capture of the fort at New Providence, already spoken of.
Jones with his own hands hoisted the first flag displayed on an
American man-of-war. It was of yellow silk, with the device of
a rattlesnake, and bore the motto, "Don't tread on me."</p>

<p>Jones attracted such favorable attention during this enterprise
that on his return he was made commander of the twelve-ton brig
<em>Providence</em> and was employed for a time in carrying troops
from Rhode Island to New York. Since he was by birth a citizen
of Great Britain, which then insisted that "once a British subject
always a British subject," the English cruisers made determined
efforts to capture him. Many of the officers declared that if
they could lay hands on the audacious freebooter, as they called
him, they would hang him at the yard arm. But, before doing so,
they had to catch him, and that proved a harder task than they
suspected. He was chased many times and often fired into, but
the <em>Providence</em> was always swift enough to show a clean
pair of heels to her pursuers and Jones himself was such a fine
sailor that he laughed at their efforts to take him prisoner.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest exploits of Jones was performed in the autumn
of 1776. He saw an American brig returning from the West Indies,
heavily laden with supplies for Washington's army, which was badly
in need of them. A British frigate was in hot pursuit of the American,
which was straining every nerve to escape, but would not have
been able to do so except for Jones, who ran in between the two,
and, firing into the frigate, induced her to let the American
go and chase him. Taking advantage of the chance thus offered,
the brig got safely away and then Jones himself dodged away from
the frigate, which thus lost both.</p>

<p>In the month of October, 1776, Jones was promoted to the rank
of captain and ordered to cruise between Boston and the Delaware.
I must tell you an anecdote which illustrates his wonderful seamanship.</p>

<p>Some weeks before he was made a captain, and while cruising off
Bermuda, he saw five sail far to the windward and he beat up,
doing so carefully and with the purpose of finding out whether
there was a chance for him to strike an effective blow. He picked
out what looked like a large merchant ship and gave chase. He
gained fast, but to his dismay, when he was quite close, he discovered
that instead of a merchant ship he had almost run into a twenty-eight
gun frigate of the enemy.</p>

<p>Finding he had caught a Tartar, Jones did the only thing left
to him. He hauled off and put on every stitch of sail and the
frigate did the same. She proved the better sailer, and, though
she gained slowly, it was surely, and in the course of a few hours
she had approached within musket shot of the brig's lee quarter.
There seemed no possible escape for Jones, knowing which, he did
a remarkable thing. He veered off until the frigate was almost
astern, when he put about dead before the wind, with every yard
of canvas set.</p>

<p>The Englishman was dumfounded by the daring manoeuvre, which
brought the American within pistol shot, for he did not fire a
gun until Jones was beyond reach of his grape. The pursuit was
continued hour after hour, but the brig was now at her best and
finally left her pursuer hopelessly astern. When the <em>Providence</em>
ran into Newport in October she had captured or destroyed fifteen
prizes.</p>

<p>Jones's bold and skilful seamanship drew attention to him and
he was now given command of the 24-gun ship <em>Alfred</em>, while
Captain Hacker took charge of the <em>Providence</em>. The two
vessels started on a cruise in company and some days later the
<em>Alfred</em> fell in with three British vessels, and, after
a brisk action, captured them all. One proved to be a transport
with 150 men and a large amount of supplies for Burgoyne's army,
which was at that time organizing in Montreal for its notable
campaign through New York, where it was captured by General Gates,
at Saratoga.</p>

<p>This transport was so valuable that Jones, instead of putting
a prize crew on board, determined to take her into port, and,
if in danger of capture from pursuit, he meant to sink her. It
began snowing the following night and the <em>Providence</em>
and <em>Alfred</em> were obliged to separate.</p>

<p>Jones was making for Boston when he was discovered by the frigate
that he had outwitted two months before, when the <em>Providence</em>
narrowly escaped capture. Night was closing in and the frigate
being to windward, her outlines were indistinct. Captain Jones
ordered his prizes to steer southward and to pay no attention
to the signals displayed on his own vessel. At midnight he hoisted
a toplight and tacked to the west, knowing the others would continue
to the southward as he had directed. The strategem was successful,
for at daylight the frigate was pressing hard after the <em>Alfred</em>,
while the prizes had disappeared. The <em>Alfred</em> eluded her
enemy as before, and, upon reaching Boston, Jones found his captives
awaiting him.</p>

<p>An idea of the effectiveness of the privateers may be gained
by the statement that during the year 1777 nearly 500 vessels
were captured by them. By that time Paul Jones had proven himself
to be the finest officer in the American Navy. He had every quality
to make him such. No one could surpass him in seamanship. He was
cool and daring and was animated by the highest patriotism for
his adopted country. Such a man was sure to be heard of again,
as Great Britain learned to her cost.</p>

<p>France had shown a strong liking for the American colonies from
the first. No doubt this liking was influenced by her hatred of
England, for the nations had been bitter rivals for years. We
had sent several commissioners to Paris, and they did a good deal
for our country. The commissioners had a heavy, single-decked
frigate built in Holland, which was named the <em>South Carolinian</em>
and was intended for Paul Jones, but some difficulties occurred
and he was sent to sea in the 18-gun ship <em>Ranger</em>, which
left Portsmouth, <em>N.H., </em>at the beginning of November.
She was so poorly equipped that Jones complained, though he did
not hesitate on that account.</p>

<p>On the way to Nantes, in France, the <em>Ranger</em> captured
two prizes, refitted at Brest, and in April, 1778, sailed for
the British coast. Having made several captures, Captain Jones
headed for the Isle of Man, his intention being to make a descent
upon Whitehaven. A violent wind that night baffled him, and, hoping
to prevent his presence in the section from being discovered,
he kept his vessel disguised as a merchantman. Sailing hither
and thither, generally capturing all vessels that he sighted,
he finally turned across to the Irish coast and in the latter
part of the month was off Carrickfergus, where he learned from
some fishermen that the British sloop-of-war <em>Drake</em> was
at anchor in the roads. Jones was exceedingly anxious to attack
her, and planned a night surprise, but again the violent wind
interfered and he was forced to give up the scheme, so well suited
to his daring nature.</p>

<p>This brave man now set out to execute one of the most startling
schemes that can be imagined. Whitehaven at that time was a city
of 50,000 inhabitants and the harbor was filled with shipping.
His plan was to sail in among the craft and burn them all. It
seemed like the idea of a man bereft of his senses, but there
was not the slightest hesitation on his part. Such enterprises
often succeed through their very boldness, and his belief was
that by acting quickly he could accomplish his purpose and strike
a blow at England that would carry consternation to the people
and the government.</p>

<p>Captain Jones had in mind the many outrages committed by British
vessels along our seacoast, for, describing his purpose in a memorial
to Congress, he said his intention was, by one good fire in England
of British shipping, "to put an end to all burnings in America."</p>
