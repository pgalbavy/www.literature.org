I
<P>
So I made my peace with my uncle, and we set out upon this bright
enterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at
one-and-three-halfpence and two-and-nine a bottle, including the
Government stamp.  We made Tono-Bungay hum!  It brought us
wealth, influence, respect, the confidence of endless people. 
All that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement;
Tono-Bungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of
scientific research, no passionate service of humanity could ever
have given me....
<P>
It was my uncle's genius that did it.  No doubt he needed me,--I
was, I will admit, his indispensable right hand; but his was the
brain to conceive.  He wrote every advertisement; some of them
even he sketched. You must remember that his were the days before
the Time took to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that
antiquated Encyclopedia.  That alluring, button-holing, let-me
-just-tell-you-quite-soberly-something-you-ought-to-know style of
newspaper advertisement, with every now and then a convulsive
jump of some attractive phrase into capitals, was then almost a
novelty.  "Many people who are MODERATELY well think they are
QUITE well," was one of his early efforts.  The jerks in capitals
were, "DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR MEDICINE," and "SIMPLY A PROPER
REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE."  One was warned against the chemist
or druggist who pushed "much-advertised nostrums" on one's
attention.  That trash did more harm than good.  The thing needed
was regimen--and Tono-Bungay!
<P>
Very early, too, was that bright little quarter column, at least
it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers:
"HILARITY--Tono-Bungay.  Like Mountain Air in the Veins."  The
penetrating trio of questions: "Are you bored with your Business?
Are you bored with your Dinner.  Are you bored with your Wife?"
--that, too, was in our Gower Street days.  Both these we had in
our first campaign when we worked London south central, and west;
and then, too, we had our first poster--the HEALTH, BEAUTY, AND
STRENGTH one.  That was his design; I happen still to have got by
me the first sketch he made for it.  I have reproduced it here
with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the
mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London.
<P>
(The second one is about eighteen months later, the germ of the
well-known "Fog" poster; the third was designed for an influenza
epidemic, but never issued.)
<P>
These things were only incidental in my department.  
<P>
I had to polish them up for the artist and arrange the business
of printing and distribution, and after my uncle had had a
violent and needless quarrel with the advertising manager of the
Daily Regulator about the amount of display given to one of
his happy thoughts, I also took up the negotiations of
advertisements for the press.
<P>
We discussed and worked out distribution together first in the
drawing-room floor in Gower Street with my aunt sometimes helping
very shrewdly, and then, with a steadily improving type of cigar
and older and older whisky, in his smuggery at their first house,
the one in Beckenham.  Often we worked far into the night
sometimes until dawn.
<P>
We really worked infernally hard, and, I recall, we worked with a
very decided enthusiasm, not simply on my uncle's part but mine,
It was a game, an absurd but absurdly interesting game, and the
points were scored in cases of bottles.  People think a happy
notion is enough to make a man rich, that fortunes can be made
without toil.  It's a dream, as every millionaire (except one or
two lucky gamblers) can testify; I doubt if J.D. Rockefeller in
the early days of Standard Oil, worked harder than we did.  We
worked far into the night--and we also worked all day.  We made a
rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced to keep
things right--for at first we could afford no properly
responsible underlings--and we traveled London, pretending to be
our own representatives and making all sorts of special
arrangements.
<P>
But none of this was my special work, and as soon as we could get
other men in, I dropped the traveling, though my uncle found it
particularly interesting and kept it up for years.  "Does me
good, George, to see the chaps behind their counters like I was
once,"  he explained.  My special and distinctive duty was to
give Tono-Bungay substance and an outward and visible bottle, to
translate my uncle's great imaginings into the creation of case
after case of labelled bottles of nonsense, and the punctual
discharge of them by railway, road and steamer towards their
ultimate goal in the Great Stomach of the People.  By all modern
standards the business was, as my uncle would say, "absolutely
bona fide."  We sold our stuff and got the money, and spent the
money honestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff.  Section
by section we spread it over the whole of the British Isles;
first working the middle-class London suburbs, then the outer
suburbs, then the home counties, then going (with new bills and a
more pious style of "ad") into Wales, a great field always for a
new patent-medicine, and then into Lancashire.
<P>
My uncle had in his inner office a big map of England, and as we
took up fresh sections of the local press and our consignments
invaded new areas, flags for advertisements  and pink underlines
for orders showed our progress.
<P>
"The romance of modern commerce, George!" my uncle would say,
rubbing his hands together and drawing  in air through his
teeth.  "The romance of modern commerce, eh?  Conquest.  Province
by province.  Like sogers."  
<P>
We subjugated England and Wales; we rolled over the Cheviots with
a special adaptation containing eleven per cent. of absolute
alcohol; "Tono-Bungay: Thistle Brand."  We also had the Fog
poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland scene.
<P>
Under the shadow of our great leading line we were presently
taking subsidiary specialties into action; "Tono-Bungay Hair
Stimulant" was our first supplement.   Then came "Concentrated
Tono-Bungay" for the eyes.  That didn't go, but we had a
considerable success with the Hair Stimulant.  We broached the
subject, I remember, in a little catechism beginning: "Why does
the hair fall out?  Because the follicles are fagged.  What are
the follicles?..."  So it went on to the climax that the Hair
Stimulant contained all "The essential  principles of that most
reviving tonic, Tono-Bungay, together with an emollient and
nutritious oil derived from crude Neat's Foot Oil by a process of
refinement, separation and deodorization....  It will be manifest
to any one of scientific attainments that in Neat's Foot Oil
derived from the hoofs and horns of beasts, we must necessarily
have a natural skin and hair lubricant."  
<P>
And we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries,
"Tono-Bungay Lozenges," and "Tono-Bungay Chocolate."  These we
urged upon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and
recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain.  We gave them
posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging 
from marvelously vertical cliffs, cyclist champions upon the
track, mounted messengers engaged in Aix-to-Ghent rides, soldiers
lying out in action under a hot sun.  "You can GO for twenty-four
hours," we declared, "on Tono-Bungay Chocolate."  We didn't say
whether you could return on the same commodity.  We also showed a
dreadfully barristerish barrister, wig, side-whiskers, teeth, a
horribly life-like portrait of all existing barristers, talking
at a table, and beneath, this legend: "A Four Hours' Speech on
Tono-Bungay Lozenges, and as fresh as when he began."  Then
brought in regiments of school-teachers, revivalist ministers,
politicians and the like.  I really do believe there was an
element of "kick" in the strychnine in these lozenges, especially
in those made according to our earlier formula.  For we altered
all our formulae--invariably weakening them enormously as sales
got ahead.
<P>
In a little while--so it seems to me now--we were employing
travelers and opening up Great Britain at the rate of a hundred
square miles a day.  All the organisation throughout was sketched
in a crude, entangled, half-inspired fashion by my uncle, and
all of it had to be worked out into a practicable scheme of
quantities and expenditure by me.  We had a lot of trouble
finding our travelers; in the end at least half of them were
Irish-Americans, a wonderful breed for selling  medicine.  We had
still more trouble over our factory  manager, because of the
secrets of the inner room, and in the end we got a very capable
woman, Mrs. Hampton Diggs, who had formerly managed a large
millinery workroom, whom we could trust to keep everything in
good working order without finding out anything that wasn't put
exactly under her loyal and energetic nose.  She conceived a high
opinion of Tono-Bungay and took it in all forms and large
quantities so long as I knew her.  It didn't seem to do her any
harm.  And she kept the girls going quite wonderfully.
<P>
My uncle's last addition to the Tono-Bungay group was the
Tono-Bungay Mouthwash.  The reader has probably read a hundred
times that inspiring inquiry of his, "You are Young Yet, but are
you Sure Nothing has Aged your Gums?"
<P>
And after that we took over the agency for three or four good
American lines that worked in with our own, and could be handled
with it; Texan Embrocation, and "23--to clear the system" were
the chief....
<P>
I set down these bare facts.  To me they are all linked with the
figure of my uncle.  In some of the old seventeenth and early
eighteenth century prayerbooks at Bladesover there used to be
illustrations with long scrolls coming out of the mouths of the
wood-cut figures.  I wish I could write all this last chapter on
a scroll coming out of the head of my uncle, show it all the time
as unfolding and pouring out from a short, fattening,
small-legged man with stiff cropped hair, disobedient glasses on
a perky little nose, and a round stare behind them.  I wish I
could show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose
as his pen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or
a picture page, and make you hear his voice, charged with solemn
import like the voice of a squeaky prophet, saying, "George!
list'n!  I got an ideer.  I got a notion!  George!" 
<P>
I should put myself into the same picture.  Best setting for us,
I think, would be the Beckenham snuggery,  because there we
worked hardest.  It would be the lamplit room of the early
nineties, and the clock upon the mantel would indicate midnight
or later.  We would be sitting on either side of the fire, I with
a pipe, my uncle with a cigar or cigarette.  There would be
glasses standing inside the brass fender.  Our expressions would
be very grave.   My uncle used to sit right back in his armchair;
his toes always turned in when he was sitting down and his legs
had a way of looking curved, as though they hadn't bones or
joints but were stuffed with sawdust.
<P>
"George, whad'yer think of T.B. for sea-sickness?" he would
say.
<P>
"No good that I can imagine."  
<P>
"Oom!  No harm TRYING, George.  We can but try."  
<P>
I would suck my pipe.  "Hard to get at.  Unless we sold our stuff
specially at the docks.  Might do a special at Cook's office, or
in the Continental Bradshaw."  
<P>
"It 'ud give 'em confidence, George."  
<P>
He would Zzzz, with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing
coals.
<P>
"No good hiding our light under a Bushel," he would remark.
<P>
I never really determined whether my uncle regarded Tono-Bungay
as a fraud, or whether he didn't come to believe in it in a kind
of way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions.  I think
that his average attitude was one of kindly, almost parental,
toleration.  I remember saying on one occasion, "But you don't
suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good
all?"  and how his face assumed a look of protest, as of one
reproving harshness and dogmatism.
<P>
"You've a hard nature, George," he said.  "You're too ready to
run things down.  How can one TELL?  How can one venture to
TELL!..."
<P>
I suppose any creative and developing game would have interested
me in those years.  At any rate, I know I put as much zeal into
this Tono-Bungay as any young lieutenant could have done who
suddenly found himself in command of a ship.  It was
extraordinarily interesting to me to figure out the advantage
accruing from this shortening of the process or that, and to
weigh it against the capital cost of the alteration.  I made a
sort of machine for sticking on the labels, that I patented; to
this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from that. 
I also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated, got the
bottles, which all came sliding down a guarded slant-way, nearly
filled with distilled water at one tap, and dripped our magic
ingredients in at the next.  This was an immense economy of space
for the inner sanctum.  For the bottling we needed special taps,
and these, too, I invented and patented.
<P>
We had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an
inclined glass trough made slippery with running water.  At one
end a girl held them up to the light, put aside any that were
imperfect and placed the others in the trough; the filling was
automatic; at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove
it home with a little mallet.  Each tank, the little one for the
vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled  water, had a
level indicator, and inside I had a float arrangement that
stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low.  Another girl
stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand
them to the three packers, who slipped them into their outer
papers and put them, with a pad of corrugated paper between each
pair, into a little groove from which they could be made to slide
neatly into position in our standard packing-case.  It sounds
wild, I know, but I believe I was the first man in the city of
London to pack patent medicines through the side of the
packing-case, to discover there was a better way in than by the
lid.  Our cases packed themselves, practically; had only to be
put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled
to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs, who padded
up the free space and nailed on top and side.  Our girls,
moreover, packed with corrugated paper and matchbook-wood box
partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to
pack through the top of the box with straw, many breakages and
much waste and confusion.
<P>

<P>
As I look back at them now, those energetic years seem all
compacted to a year or so; from the days of our first hazardous
beginning in Farringdon Street with barely a thousand pounds'
worth of stuff or credit all told--and that got by something
perilously like snatching--to the days when my uncle went to the
public on behalf of himself and me (one-tenth share) and our
silent partners, the drug wholesalers and the printing people and
the owner of that group of magazines and newspapers, to ask with
honest confidence for L150,000.  Those silent partners were
remarkably sorry, I know, that they had not taken larger shares
and given us longer credit when the subscriptions came pouring
in.  My uncle had a clear half to play with (including the
one-tenth understood to be mine).
<P>
L150,000--think of it!--for the goodwill in a string of lies and
a trade in bottles of mitigated water!  Do you realise the
madness of the world that sanctions such a thing?  Perhaps you
don't.  At times use and wont certainly blinded me.  If it had
not been for Ewart, I don't think I should have had an inkling of
the wonderfulness  of this development of my fortunes; I should
have grown accustomed to it, fallen in with all its delusions as
completely as my uncle presently did.  He was immensely proud of
the flotation.  "They've never been given such value," he said,
"for a dozen years."   But Ewart, with his gesticulating hairy
hands and bony wrists, his single-handed chorus to all this as it
played itself over again in my memory, and he kept my fundamental
absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time.
<P>
"It's just on all fours with the rest of things," he remarked;
"only more so.  You needn't think you're anything out of the
way."  
<P>
I remember one disquisition very distinctly.  It was just after
Ewart had been to Paris on a mysterious expedition to "rough in"
some work for a rising American sculptor.  This young man had
a commission for an allegorical figure of Truth (draped, of
course) for his State Capitol, and he needed help.  Ewart had
returned with his hair cut en brosse and with his costume
completely translated into French.  He wore, I remember, a
bicycling suit of purplish-brown, baggy beyond ageing--the only
creditable thing about it was that it had evidently not been made
for him--a voluminous black tie, a decadent soft felt hat and
several French expletives of a sinister description.  "Silly
clothes, aren't they?" he said at the sight of my startled eye.
"I don't know why I got'm.  They seemed all right over there."  
<P>
He had come down to our Raggett Street place to discuss a
benevolent project of mine for a poster by him, and he scattered
remarkable discourse over the heads (I hope it was over the
heads) of our bottlers.
<P>
"What I like about it all, Ponderevo, is its poetry.... That's
where we get the pull of the animals.  No animal would ever run a
factory like this.  Think!... One remembers the Beaver, of
course.  He might very possibly bottle things, but would he stick
a label round 'em and sell 'em?  The Beaver is a dreamy fool,
I'll admit, him and his dams, but after all there's a sort of
protection about 'em, a kind of muddy practicality!  They prevent
things getting at him.  And it's not your poetry only.  It's the
poetry of the customer too.  Poet answering to poet--soul to
soul.  Health, Strength and Beauty--in a bottle--the magic
philtre! Like a fairy tale....
<P>
"Think of the people to whom your bottles of footle go! (I'm
calling it footle, Ponderevo, out of praise,"  he said in
parenthesis.)
<P>
"Think of the little clerks and jaded women and overworked
people.  People overstrained with wanting to do, people
overstrained with wanting to be.... People, in fact,
overstrained....  The real trouble of life, Ponderevo, isn't that
we exist--that's a vulgar error; the real trouble is that we
DON'T really exist and we want to.  That's what this--in the
highest sense--just stands for! The hunger to be--for
once--really alive--to the finger tips!...
<P>
"Nobody wants to do and be the things people are--nobody.  YOU
don't want to preside over this--this bottling; I don't want to
wear these beastly clothes and be led about by you; nobody wants
to keep on sticking labels on silly bottles at so many farthings
a gross. That isn't existing! That's--sus--substratum.  None of
us want to be what we are, or to do what we do. Except as a sort
of basis.  What do we want?  You know.  I know.  Nobody
confesses.  What we all want to be is something perpetually young
and beautiful--young  Joves--young Joves, Ponderevo" --his voice
became loud, harsh and declamatory--"pursuing coy half-willing
nymphs through everlasting forests."...
<P>
There was a just-perceptible listening hang in the work about us.
<P>
"Come downstairs," I interrupted, "we can talk better there."  
<P>
"I can talk better here," he answered.
<P>
He was just going on, but fortunately the implacable face of Mrs.
Hampton Diggs appeared down the aisle of bottling machines.
<P>
"All right," he said, "I'll come."  
<P>
In the little sanctum below, my uncle was taking a digestive
pause after his lunch and by no means alert.  His presence sent
Ewart back to the theme of modern commerce, over the excellent
cigar my uncle gave him.  He behaved with the elaborate deference
due to a business magnate from an unknown man.
<P>
"What I was pointing out to your nephew, sir," said Ewart,
putting both elbows on the table, "was the poetry of commerce. 
He doesn't, you know, seem to see it at all."  
<P>
My uncle nodded brightly.  "Whad I tell 'im," he said round his
cigar.
<P>
"We are artists.  You and I, sir, can talk, if you will permit
me, as one artist to another.  It's advertisement has--done it. 
Advertisement has revolutionised trade and industry; it is going
to revolutionise the world.  The old merchant used to tote about
commodities; the new one creates values.  Doesn't need to tote. 
He takes something that isn't worth anything--or something that
isn't particularly worth anything--and he makes it worth
something.  He takes mustard that is just like anybody else's
mustard, and he goes about saying, shouting, singing, chalking on
walls, writing inside people's books, putting it everywhere,
'Smith's Mustard is the Best.' And behold it is the best!" 
<P>
"True," said my uncle, chubbily and with a dreamy sense of
mysticism; "true!" 
<P>
"It's just like an artist; he takes a lump of white marble on the
verge of a lime-kiln, he chips it about, he makes--he makes a
monument to himself--and others--a monument the world will not
willingly let die.  Talking of mustard, sir, I was at Clapham
Junction the other day, and all the banks are overgrown with
horse radish that's got loose from a garden somewhere.  You know
what horseradish is--grows like wildfire--spreads --spreads.  I
stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and
thinking about it.  'Like fame,' I thought, 'rank and wild where
it isn't wanted.  Why don't the really good things in life grow
like horseradish?' I thought.  My mind went off in a peculiar way
it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin--I
bought some the other day for a ham I had.  It came into my head
that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to
adulterate mustard.  I had a sort of idea that I could plunge
into business on that, get rich and come back to my own proper
monumental art again.  And then I said, 'But why adulterate?  I
don't like the idea of adulteration.'"
<P>
"Shabby," said my uncle, nodding his head.  "Bound to get found
out!" 
<P>
"And totally unnecessary, too! Why not do up a
mixture--three-quarters pounded horseradish and a quarter
mustard--give it a fancy name--and sell it at twice the mustard
price.  See?  I very nearly started the business straight away,
only something happened.  My train came along."  
<P>
"Jolly good ideer," said my uncle.  He looked at me. "That really
is an ideer, George," he said.
<P>
"Take shavin's, again! You know that poem of Longfellow's, sir,
that sounds exactly like the first declension.  What is
it?--'Marr's a maker, men say!'"
<P>
My uncle nodded and gurgled some quotation that died away.
<P>
'Jolly good poem, George," he said in an aside to me.
<P>
"Well, it's about a carpenter and a poetic Victorian child, you
know, and some shavin's.  The child made no end out of the
shavin's.  So might you.  Powder 'em.  They might be anything. 
Soak 'em in jipper,--Xylo-tobacco!  Powder'em and get a little
tar and turpentinous smell in,--wood-packing for hot baths--a
Certain Cure for the scourge of Influenza! There's all these
patent grain foods,--what Americans call cereals.  I believe I'm
right, sir, in saying they're sawdust."  
<P>
"No!" said my uncle, removing his cigar; "as far as I can find
out it's really grain,--spoilt grain.... I've been going into
that."  
<P>
"Well, there you are!" said Ewart.  "Say it's spoilt grain.  It
carried out my case just as well.  Your modern  commerce is no
more buying and selling than sculpture.  It's mercy--it's
salvation.  It's rescue work!  It takes all sorts of fallen
commodities by the hand and raises them.  Cana isn't in it.  You
turn water--into Tono-Bungay."  
<P>
"Tono-Bungay's all right," said my uncle, suddenly grave.  "We
aren't talking of Tono-Bungay."  
<P>
"Your nephew, sir, is hard; he wants everything to go to a sort
of predestinated end; he's a Calvinist of Commerce.  Offer him a
dustbin full of stuff; he calls it refuse--passes by on the other
side.  Now YOU, sir  you'd make cinders respect themselves."  
<P>
My uncle regarded him dubiously for a moment.  But there was a
touch of appreciation in his eye.
<P>
"Might make 'em into a sort of sanitary brick," he reflected over
his cigar end.
<P>
"Or a friable biscuit.  Why NOT?  You might advertise: 'Why are
Birds so Bright?  Because they digest their food perfectly!  Why
do they digest their food so perfectly?  Because they have a
gizzard!  Why hasn't man a gizzard? Because he can buy
Ponderevo's Asphalt Triturating, Friable Biscuit--Which is
Better.'"
<P>
He delivered the last words in a shout, with his hairy hand
flourished in the air....
<P>
"Damn clever fellow," said my uncle, after he had one.  "I know a
man when I see one.  He'd do.  But drunk, I should say.  But that
only makes some chap brighter .  If he WANTS to do that poster,
he can.  Zzzz.  That ideer of his about the horseradish.  There's
something  in that, George.  I'm going to think over that...."  
<P>
I may say at once that my poster project came to nothing in the
end, though Ewart devoted an interesting week to the matter.  He
let his unfortunate disposition to irony run away with him.  He
produced a picture of two beavers with a subtle likeness, he
said, to myself and my uncle--the likeness to my uncle certainly
wasn't half bad--and they were bottling rows and rows of
Tono-Bungay, with the legend "Modern commerce."  It certainly
wouldn't have sold a case, though he urged it on me one cheerful
evening on the ground that it would "arouse curiosity."  In
addition he produced a quite shocking study of my uncle,
excessively and needlessly nude, but, so far as I was able to
judge, an admirable likeness, engaged in feats of strength of a
Gargantuan type before an audience of deboshed and shattered
ladies.  The legend, "Health, Beauty, Strength," below, gave a
needed point to his parody.  This he hung up in the studio over
the oil shop, with a flap of brown paper; by way of a curtain
over it to accentuate its libellous offence.
