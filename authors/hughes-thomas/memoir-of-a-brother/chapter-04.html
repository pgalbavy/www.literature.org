<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My brother went up to Oxford full of good resolves as to reading,
which he carried out far better than most men do, although undoubtedly
after his first year, his popularity, by enlarging the circle
of his acquaintance to an inconvenient extent, somewhat interfered
with his studies. Your grandfather was delighted at having a son
likely to distinguish himself actually resident in his own old
College. In his time it had occupied the place in the University
now held by Balliol. Copleston and Whately had been his tutors;
and, as he had resided a good deal after taking his degree, he
had seen several generations of distinguished men in the common
room, including Arnold, Blanco White, Keble, Pusey, and Hampden.
Moreover, there was a tradition of University distinction in his
family; his father had been Setonian Prizeman and Chancellor’s
Medallist at Cambridge, and he himself had carried off the Latin
verse prize, and one of the English Odes recited before the United
Sovereigns, when they paid a visit to the Oxford Commemoration
in 1814, with Wellington, Blücher, and a host of the great soldiers
of that day.</p>

<p>His anxiety as to George’s start at Oxford manifested itself
in many ways, and particularly as to the want of punctuality,
and accuracy in small matters, which he had already noticed. As
a delicate lesson on this subject, I find him taking advantage
of the fact that George’s watch was in the hands of the maker
for repairs, to send him his own chronometer, adding: "As your
sense of trustworthiness in little and great things is a considerably
multiplied multiple of your care for your own private property
(which doubtless will grow to its right proportion when you have
been cheated a little), I have no doubt old Trusty will return
to me in as good order as when he left me. Furthermore, it is
possible you may take a fancy to him when you have learnt the
value of an unfailing guide to punctuality. In which case, if
you can tell me at the end of term that you have, to the best
of your belief, made the most of your time, I will with great
pleasure swap with you. As to what is making the best of your
time, you would of course like to have my ideas. Thus, then"—and
your grandfather proceeds to give a number of rules, founded on
his own old Oxford experience, as to reading, and goes on:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"All this, you will say, cuts out a tolerably full<br/>
employment for the term. But when you can call this in your<br/>
recollections, ‘<em>terminus alba cretâ notandus</em>,’ it will be<br/>
worth trouble. I believe the intentions of most freshmen are<br/>
good, and the first term generally well spent: the second and<br/>
third are often the trial, when one gets confidence in oneself;<br/>
and the sense of what is right and honourable must come in<br/>
place of that deference for one’s superior officers, which is<br/>
at first instinctive. I am glad you find you can do as you<br/>
please, and choose your own society without making yourself<br/>
at all remarkable. So I found, for the same reasons that<br/>
facilitate the matter to you. Domestic or private education,<br/>
I believe, throws more difficulties in the way of saying ‘No’<br/>
when it is your pleasure so to do, and the poor wight only gets<br/>
laughed at instead of cultivated. After all, one may have too<br/>
many acquaintance, unexceptionable though they be. But I do not<br/>
know that much loss of time can occur to a person of perfectly<br/>
sober habits, as you are, if he leaves wine parties with a<br/>
clear head at chapel time, and eschews supping and lounging,<br/>
and lunching and gossiping, and tooling in High Street, and<br/>
such matters, which belong more to particular cliques than to<br/>
a generally extended acquaintance in College. In all these<br/>
things, going not as a raw lad, but as a man of nineteen, with<br/>
my father’s entire confidence, I found I could settle the<br/>
thing to my satisfaction in no time: your circumstances are<br/>
precisely the same, and the result will probably be the same.<br/>
I applaud, and κυδίζε, and clap you on the back for rowing:<br/>
row, box, fence, and walk with all possible sturdiness. Another<br/>
thing: I believe an idea prevails that it is necessary to ride<br/>
sometimes, to show yourself of equestrian rank. If you have<br/>
any mind this way, write to Franklin to send Stevens with your<br/>
horse; keep him a few weeks, and I will allow you a £5 note to<br/>
assert your equestrian dignity, now or at any other time. This<br/>
is a better style of thing than piaffing about on hired Oxford<br/>
cocky-horses, like Jacky Popkin, and all such half-measures.<br/>
The only objection to such doings is, that you certainly do see<br/>
a style of men always across a horse who are fit for nothing<br/>
else, and <em>non constat</em> that they always know a hock from a<br/>
stifle-joint. But this is only <em>per accidens</em>. And if you have<br/>
a fancy for an occasional freak this way, remember I was bred<br/>
in the saddle, and, whatever my present opinions may be from<br/>
longer experience, can fully enter into your ideas."

</p>
</div>
<p>You will see by his answer how readily George entered into some
of his father’s ideas, though I don’t think he ever sent for his
horse. A few weeks later, in 1841, he writes:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Now to answer your last letters. I shall be delighted to<br/>
accept you as my prime minister for the next two years. Any<br/>
plan of reading which you chalk out for me I think I shall be<br/>
able to pursue—at least I am sure I will try to do so. Men<br/>
reading for honours now generally employ ‘a coach.’ If you will<br/>
condescend to be my coach, I will try to answer to the whip to<br/>
the best of my power."

</p>
</div>
<p>Your grandfather accepted the post with great pleasure; and there
are a number of his letters, full of hints and directions as to
study, which I hope you may all read some day, but which would
make this memoir too long. You will see later on how well satisfied
he was with the general result, though in one or two instances
he had sad disappointments to bear, as most fathers have who are
anxious about their sons’ work. The first of these happened this
year. He was specially anxious that George should write for the
Latin Verse, which prize he himself had won. Accordingly George
wrote in his first year, but, instead of taking his poem himself
to the Proctor’s when he had finished it, left it with his College
tutor to send in. The consequence was, it was forgotten till after
the last day for delivery, and so could not be received. This
was a sad trial to your grandfather, both because he had been
very sanguine as to the result, and because here was another instance
of George’s carelessness about his own affairs, and want of punctuality
in small things. However, he wrote so kindly about it, that George
was more annoyed than if he had been very angry, and set to work
on the poem for the next year as soon as the subject was announced,
which I remember was "<em>Noachi Diluvium</em>." You may be sure
that now the poem went in in good time, but in due course the
Examiners announced that no prize would be given for the year.
I do not know that any reason was ever given for this unusual
course, which surprised everyone, as it was known that several
very good scholars, including, I believe, the late Head-master
of Marlborough, had been amongst the competitors. Your grandfather
was very much vexed. He submitted George’s poem to two of his
old college friends, Dean Milman and Bishop Lonsdale, both of
whom had been Latin prizemen; and, when they expressed an opinion
that, in default of better copies of verses, these should have
been entitled to the prize, he had them printed, with the following
heading:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The refusal of the Official Committee of Examiners to award<br/>
any prize for the Oxford Latin verse of 1842, has naturally<br/>
led to a supposition that the scholarship and intelligence<br/>
of the competitors has fallen short of the usual standard.<br/>
Having, however, perused the following copy of verses, which<br/>
are probably a fair specimen of those sent in, I am inclined<br/>
to think, as a graduate and somewhat conversant with such<br/>
subjects, that this discouraging inference is unfounded, and<br/>
that the committee have been influenced in their discretion<br/>
by some unexplained reason, involving no reflection on the<br/>
candidates for the prize, as compared with those of former<br/>
years."

</p>
</div>
<p>The real fact I believe to have been, so far as George was concerned,
that there were two false quantities in his verses; and though
these were so palpable, as your grandfather remarked, "as to be
obvious to any fifth-form boy, and plainly due to carelessness
in transcription, and want of revision by a second person," the
Examiners were clearly not bound to make allowances for such carelessness.</p>

<p>Many years after, in a letter to his sister, on some little success
of her boy at Rugby, George writes:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I congratulate you on Walter’s success. We are much more<br/>
interested for our brats than we were for ourselves. I remember<br/>
how miserable my poor father made himself once when I did not<br/>
get a Latin Verse prize at Oxford, and how much more sorry I<br/>
was for him than for myself. Anyhow, there is no pleasure equal<br/>
to seeing one’s children distinguish themselves—it makes one<br/>
young again."

</p>
</div>
<p>But I must return to his freshman’s year at Oxford.</p>

<p>I have told you already that this was our first separation of
any length. I did not see him from the day he went to Oxford in
January until our Rugby Eleven went up to Lords, at the end of
the half-year, for the match with the <em>M.C.C. </em>It was the
first time I had ever played there, and of course I was very full
of it, and fancied the match the most important event which was
occurring in England the time. One of our Eleven did not turn
up, and George was allowed to play for us. He was, as usual, a
tower of strength in a boys’ Eleven, because you could rely on
his nerve. When the game was going badly, he was always put in
to keep up his wicket, and very seldom failed to do it. On this
occasion we were in together, and he made a long score, but, I
thought, did not play quite in his usual style; and on talking
the matter over with him when we got home, I found that he had
not been playing at Oxford, but had taken to boating.</p>

<p>I expressed my sorrow at this, and spoke disparagingly of boating,
of which I knew nothing whatever. We certainly had a punt in the
stream at home, but it was too narrow for oars, and I scarcely
knew a stretcher from a rowlock. He declared that he was as fond
of cricket as ever, but that in the whole range of sport, even
including hunting, there was no excitement like a good neck-and-neck
boat-race, and that I should come to think so too.</p>

<p>At this time his boating career had only just begun, and rowing
was rather at a discount at Oxford. For several years Cambridge
had had their own way with the dark blues, notably in this very
year of 1841. But a radical reformer had just appeared at Oxford,
whose influence has lasted to the present day, and to whom the
substitution of the long stroke with sharp catch at the beginning
(now universally accepted as the only true form) for the short,
digging "waterman’s" stroke, as it used to be called, is chiefly
due. This was Fletcher Menzies, then captain of the University
College boat. He had already begun to train a crew on his own
principles, in opposition to the regular University crew, and,
amongst others, had selected my brother, though a freshman, and
had taken him frequently down the river behind himself in a pair-oar.
The first result of this instruction was, that my brother won
the University pair-oar race, pulling stroke to another freshman
of his own college.</p>

<p>In Michaelmas Term, 1841, it became clear to all judges of rowing
that the opposition was triumphant. F. Menzies was elected captain
of the O. U. B. C., and chose my brother as his No. 7, so that
on my arrival at Oxford in the spring of 1842, I found him training
in the University crew. The race with Cambridge was then rowed
in the summer, and over the six-mile course, between Westminster
and Putney bridges. This year the day selected was the 12th of
June. I remember it well, for I was playing at the same time in
the Oxford and Cambridge match at Lord’s. The weather was intensely
hot, and we were getting badly beaten. So confident were our opponents
in the prowess of their University, that, at dinner in the Pavilion,
they were offering even bets that Cambridge would win all three
events—the cricket match, the race at Westminster, and the Henley
Cup, which was to be rowed for in the following week. This was
too much for us, and the bets were freely taken; I myself, for
the first and last time in my life, betting five pounds with the
King’s man who sat next me. Before our match was over the news
came up from the river that Oxford had won.</p>

<p>It was the last race ever rowed by the Universities over the
long six-mile course. To suit the tide, it was rowed down, from
Putney to Westminster Bridge. My brother unluckily lost his straw
hat at the start, and the intense heat on his head caused him
terrible distress. The boats were almost abreast down to the Battersea
reach, where there were a number of lighters moored in mid stream,
waiting for the tide. This was the crisis of the race. As the
boats separated, each taking its own side, Egan, the Cambridge
coxswain, called on his crew: Shadwell, the Oxford coxswain, heard
him, and called on his own men, and when the boats came in sight
of each other again from behind the lighters, Oxford was well
ahead. But my brother was getting faint from the effects of the
sun on his head, when Shadwell reminded him of the slice of lemon
which was placed in each man’s thwart. He snatched it up, and
at the same time F. Menzies took off his own hat and gave it him;
and, when the boat shot under Westminster Bridge with a clear
lead, he was quite himself again.</p>

<p>In our college boat—of which he was now stroke, and which he
took with a brilliant rush to the head of the river, bumping University,
the leading boat, to which his captain, F. Menzies, was still
stroke, after two very severe races—he always saw that every man
had a small slice of lemon at the start, in memory of the Battersea
reach.</p>

<p>Next year (1843), owing to a dispute about the time, there was
no University race over the London course, but the crews were
to meet at the Henley Regatta. The meeting was looked forward
to with more than ordinary interest, as party feeling was running
high between the Universities. In the previous year, after their
victory in London, the Oxford boat had gone to Henley, but had
withdrawn, in consequence of a decision of the stewards, allowing
a man to row in the Cambridge crew who had already rowed in a
previous heat, in another boat. So the cup remained in the possession
of the Cambridge Rooms, a London rowing club, composed of men
who had left college, and of the best oarsmen still at the University.
If the Cambridge Rooms could hold the challenge cup this year
also, it would become their property. But we had little fear of
this, as Menzies’ crew was in better form than ever. He had beaten
Cambridge University in 1842, and we were confident would do it
again; and, as the Rooms were never so strong as the University,
we had no doubt as to the result of the final heat also. I remember
walking over from Oxford the night before the regatta, with a
friend, full of these hopes, and the consternation with which
we heard, on arriving at the town, that the Cambridge University
boat had withdrawn, so that the best men might be draughted from
it into the Rooms’ crew, the holders of the cup. Those only who
have felt the extraordinary interest which these contests excite
can appreciate the dismay with which this announcement filled
us. Our boat would, by this arrangement, have to contend with
the picked oars of two first-class crews; and we forgot that,
after all, though the individual men were better, the fact of
their not having trained regularly together made them really less
formidable competitors. But far worse news came in the morning.
F. Menzies had been in the Schools in the previous month, and
the strain of his examination, combined with training for the
race, had been too much for him. He was down with a bad attack
of fever. What was to be done? It was settled at once that my
brother should row stroke, and a proposal was made that the vacant
place in the boat should be filled by one of Menzies’ college
crew. The question went before the stewards, who, after long deliberation,
determined that this could not be allowed. In consequence of the
dispute in the previous year, they had decided, that only those
oarsmen whose names had been sent in could row in any given race.
I am not sure where the suggestion came from, I believe from Menzies
himself, that his crew should row the race with seven oars; but
I well remember the indignation and despair with which the final
announcement was received.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it, and we ran down the bank to
the starting-place by the side of our crippled boat, with sad
hearts, cheering them to show our appreciation of their pluck,
but without a spark of hope as to the result. When they turned
to take up their place for the start, we turned also, and went
a few hundred yards up the towing-path, so as to get start enough
to enable us to keep up with the race. The signal-gun was fired,
and we saw the oars flash in the water, and began trotting up
the bank with our heads turned over our shoulders. First one,
and then another, cried out that "we were holding our own," that
"light blue was not gaining." In another minute they were abreast
of us, close together, but the dark blue flag the least bit to
the front. A third of the course was over, and, as we rushed along
and saw the lead improved foot by foot, almost inch by inch, hope
came back, and the excitement made running painful. In another
minute, as they turned the corner and got into the straight reach,
the crowd became too dense for running. We could not keep up,
and could only follow with our eyes and shouts, as we pressed
up towards the bridge. Before we could reach it the gun fired,
and the dark blue flag was run up, showing that Oxford had won.</p>

<p>Then followed one of the temporary fits of delirium which sometimes
seize Englishmen, the sight of which makes one slow to disbelieve
any crazy story which is told of the doings of other people in
moments of intense excitement. The crew had positively to fight
their way into their hotel, and barricade themselves there, to
escape being carried round Henley on our shoulders. The enthusiasm,
frustrated in this direction, burst out in all sorts of follies,
of which you may take this as a specimen. The heavy toll-gate
was pulled down, and thrown over the bridge into the river, by
a mob of young Oxonians headed by a small, decorous, shy man in
spectacles, who had probably never pulled an oar in his life,
but who had gone temporarily mad with excitement, and I am confident
would, at that moment, have led his followers not only against
the Henley constables, but against a regiment with fixed bayonets.
Fortunately, no harm came of it but a few broken heads and black
eyes, and the local authorities, making allowances for the provocation,
were lenient at the next petty sessions.</p>

<p>The crew went up to London from Henley, to row for the Gold Cup,
in the Thames Regatta, which had just been established. Here they
met the Cambridge Rooms’ crew again, strengthened by a new No.
3 and a new stroke, and the Leander, then in its glory, and won
the cup after one of the finest and closest races ever rowed.
There has been much discussion as to these two races ever since
in the boating world, in which my brother was on one occasion
induced to take part. "The Oxford University came in first," was
his account, "with a clear lead of the Leander, the Cambridge
crew overlapping the Leander. We were left behind at the start,
and had great difficulty in passing our opponents, not from want
of pace, but from want of room." And, speaking of the Henley race,
which was said to have been won against a "scratch crew," he adds:
"A ‘scratch crew’ may mean anything short of a perfectly trained
crew of good materials. Anyone who cares about it will find the
names of the Rooms’ crew at p. 100 of Mr. Macmichael’s book, and
by consulting the index will be able to form a judgment as to
the quality of our opponents. <em>We</em> had a very great respect
for them. I never attempted to exaggerate the importance of the
‘seven oars’ race,’ and certainly never claimed to have beaten
a Cambridge University crew on that occasion." It will always
remain, however, one of the most interesting of the heroic records
of a noble English sport.</p>

<p>He announced his own triumphs at home as follows, from the Golden
Cross, where the Oxford crew then stopped:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"MY <em>DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,—I </em>should have been with you<br/>
yesterday, but was obliged to wait because they had not<br/>
finished the gold oars which we have won at Putney. We have<br/>
been as successful here as we were at Henley, and I hope<br/>
I shall bring home the cup to show you. I shall be home<br/>
to-morrow, and very glad to get to Donnington again. I don’t<br/>
feel the least unsettled by these proceedings, and am in an<br/>
excellent humour for reading."

</p>
</div>
<p>The two great cups came to Donnington, and remained for the year
on your grandfather’s sideboard, who could never quite make up
his mind about them; pride at his son’s extraordinary prowess
being dashed with fears as to the possible effects on him. George
himself, at this time, certainly had no idea that he was at all
the worse for it, and maintained in his letters that pulling "is
not so severe exercise as boxing or fencing hard for an hour."
"You may satisfy yourselves I shall not overdo it. I have always
felt the better for it as yet, but if I were to feel the least
inconvenience I should give it up at once."</p>

<p>One effect the seven-oar race had on our generation at Oxford:
it made boating really popular, which it had not been till then.
I, amongst others, was quite converted to my brother’s opinion,
and began to spend all my spare time on the water. Our college
entered for the University four-oar races in the following November
Term, and, to my intense delight, I was selected for No. 2, my
brother pulling stroke.</p>

<p>Our first heat was against Balliol, and through my awkwardness
it proved to be the hardest race my brother ever rowed. At the
second stroke after the start I caught a crab (to use boating
phrase), and such a bad one that the head of our boat was forced
almost into the bank, and we lost not a stroke or two, but at
least a dozen, Balliol going away with a lead of two boats’ lengths
and more. Few strokes would have gone on in earnest after this,
and I am not sure that my brother would, but that it was my first
race for a University prize. As it was, he turned round, took
a look at Balliol, and just said, "Shove her head out! Now then,"
and away we went. Of course I was burning with shame, and longing
to do more than my utmost to make up for my clumsiness. The boat
seemed to spring under us, but I could feel it was no doing of
mine. Just before the Gut we were almost abreast of them, but,
as they had the choice of water, we were pushed out into mid stream,
losing half a boat’s length, and having now to pull up against
the full current while Balliol went up on the Oxford side under
the willows. Our rivals happened also to be personal friends,
and I remember well becoming conscious as we struggled up the
reach that I was alongside, first of their stroke, the late Sir
H. Lambert, then of No. 3, W. Spottiswoode, and at last, as we
came to the Cherwell, just before the finish, of our old schoolfellow,
T. Walrond, who was pulling the bow oar. I felt that the race
was won, for they had now to come across to us; and won it was,
but only by a few feet. I don’t think the rest of us were much
more distressed than we had been before in college races. But
my brother’s head drooped forward, and he could not speak for
several seconds. I should have learnt then, if I had needed to
learn, that it is the stroke who wins boat races.</p>

<p>Our next heat against University, the holders of the cup was
a much easier affair. We won by some lengths, and my brother had
thus carried off every honour which an oarsman can win at the
University, except the sculls, for which he had never been able
to enter. I cannot remember any race in which he pulled stroke
and was beaten.</p>

<p>There are few pleasanter memories in my life than those of the
river-side, when we were training behind him in our college crew.
He was perhaps a thought too easy, and did not keep us quite so
tightly in hand as the captains of some of the other leading boats
kept their men. But the rules of training were then barbarous,
and I think we were all the better for not being strictly limited
even in the matter of a draught of cold water, or compelled to
eat our meat half cooked. He was most judicious in all the working
part of training, and no man ever knew better when to give his
crew the long Abingdon reach, and when to be content with Iffley
or Sandford. At the half-hour’s rest at those places he would
generally sit quiet, and watch the skittles, wrestling, quoits,
or feats of strength which were going on all about. But if he
did take part in them, he almost always beat everyone else. I
only remember one occasion on which he was fairly foiled. In consequence
of his intimacy with F. Menzies, our crew were a great deal with
that of University College, and much friendly rivalry existed
between us. One afternoon one of their crew,[10] R. Mansfield,
brother of George’s old vaulting antagonist, rode down to Sandford,
where, in the field near the inn, there was always a furze hurdle
for young gentlemen to leap over. In answer to some chaffing remark,
Mansfield turned round, and, sitting with his face towards his
horse’s tail, rode him over this hurdle. Several of us tried it
after him, George amongst the number, but we all failed; and of
course declared that it was all a trick, and that his horse was
trained to do it under him, and to refuse under anybody else.</p>

<p>The four-oar race was the last of my brother’s boating triumphs.
At the end of the term he gave up rowing, as his last year was
beginning, and he was anxious to get more time for his preparation
for the Schools. I am not sure that he succeeded in this as, strong
exercise of some kind being a necessity to him, he took to playing
an occasional game at cricket, and was caught and put into the
University Eleven. He pulled, however, in one more great race,
in the Thames Regatta of 1845, when he was still resident as a
bachelor, attending lectures. Number 6 in the Oxford boat broke
down, and his successor applied to him to fill the place, to which
he assented rather unwillingly. The following extract from a letter
to his father gives the result, and the close of his boating career:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"You will have seen that Oxford was unsuccessful in London for<br/>
the Grand Cup, but I really think we should have won it had it<br/>
not been for that unlucky foul. I only consented to take an oar<br/>
in the boat because they said they could not row without me,<br/>
and found myself well up to the work."

</p>
</div>
<p>He always retained his love for rowing, and came up punctually
every year to take his place on the umpire’s boat at the University
race, to which he had a prescriptive claim as an old captain of
the <em>O.U.B.C. </em>And this chapter may fitly close with a
boating song, the best of its kind that I know of, which he wrote
at my request. It appeared in Mr. Severn’s "Almanac of English
Sports," published at Christmas 1868. I had rashly promised the
editor to give him some verses for March, on the University race,
and put it off till it was time to go to press. When my time was
limited by days, and I had to sit down to my task in the midst
of other work, I found that the knack of rhyming had left me,
and turned naturally to the brother who had helped me in many
a copy of verses thirty years back. I sent him down some dozen
hobbling lines, and within a post or two I received from him the
following, on the March Boat Race:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The wood sways and rocks in the fierce Equinox,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The old heathen war-god bears rule in the sky,<br/>
Aslant down the street drives the pitiless sleet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of the house-tops the cloud-rack spins by.

</p>
<p>
Old Boreas may bluster, but gaily we’ll muster,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowd every nook on bridge, steamboat, and shore,<br/>
With cheering to greet Cam and Isis, who meet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Derby of boating, our fête of the oar.

</p>
<p>
"Off jackets!"—each oarsman springs light to his seat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we veterans, while ever more fierce beats the rain,<br/>
Scan well the light form of each hardy athlete,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And live the bright days of our youth once again.

</p>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho’ lumpy the water and furious the wind,<br/>
Against a "dead noser"[11] our champions can row, Sir,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave the poor "Citizens" panting behind.

</p>
<p>
"Swing together!" The Crab-tree, Barnes, Chiswick are past;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mortlake—and hark to the signaling gun!<br/>
While the victors, hard all, long and strong to the last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rush past Barker’s rails, and our Derby is won.

</p>
<p>
Our Derby, unsullied by fraud and chicane,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By thieves-Latin jargon, and leg’s howling din—<br/>
Our Derby, where "nobbling" and "roping" are vain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all run their best, and the best men must win.

</p>
<p>
No dodges we own but strength, courage, and science;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold rules not the fate of our Isthmian games;<br/>
In brutes—tho’ the noblest—we place no reliance;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our racers are men, and our turf is the Thames.

</p>
<p>
The sons of St. Dennis in praise of their tennis,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chases and volleys, may brag to their fill;<br/>
To the northward of Stirling, of golf, and of curling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the chiels wi’ no trousers crack on as they will.

</p>
<p>
Cricket, football, and rackets—but hold, I’ll not preach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Every man to his fancy:—I’m too old to mend—<br/>
So give <em>me</em> a good stretch down the Abingdon reach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Six miles every inch, and "hard all" to the end.

</p>
<p>
Then row, dear Etonians and Westminsters, row,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Row, hard-fisted craftsmen on Thames and on Tyne,<br/>
Labuan,[12] New Zealand, your chasubles[13] peel, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In one spurt of hard work, and hard rowing, combine

</p>
<p>
Our maundering critics may prate as they please<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glory departed and influence flown—<br/>
Row and work, boys of England, on rivers and seas,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old land shall hold, firm as ever, her own.

<p>[11] "Dead noser," the Tyne phrase for a wind in your teeth.</p>

<p>[12] The Bishops were famous oarsmen. Dr. Macdougal rowed bow
oar in Menzies’ boat, and was a dear friend of my brother’s.</p>
