<p>Blight, Mildew, and Smut..." Mary was puzzled and distressed.
Perhaps her ears had played her false. Perhaps what he had really
said was, "Squire, Binyon, and Shanks," or "Childe, Blunden, and
Earp," or even "Abercrombie, Drinkwater, and Rabindranath Tagore."
Perhaps. But then her ears never did play her false. "Blight,
Mildew, and Smut." The impression was distinct and ineffaceable.
"Blight, Mildew..." she was forced to the conclusion, reluctantly,
that Denis had indeed pronounced those improbable words. He had
deliberately repelled her attempts to open a serious discussion.
That was horrible. A man who would not talk seriously to a woman
just because she was a woman&mdash;oh, impossible! Egeria or nothing.
Perhaps Gombauld would be more satisfactory. True, his meridional
heredity was a little disquieting; but at least he was a serious
worker, and it was with his work that she would associate herself.
And Denis? After all, what <em>WAS </em>Denis? A dilettante, an
amateur...</p>

<p>Gombauld had annexed for his painting-room a little disused granary
that stood by itself in a green close beyond the farm-yard. It
was a square brick building with a peaked roof and little windows
set high up in each of its walls. A ladder of four rungs led up
to the door; for the granary was perched above the ground, and
out of reach of the rats, on four massive toadstools of grey stone.
Within, there lingered a faint smell of dust and cobwebs; and
the narrow shaft of sunlight that came slanting in at every hour
of the day through one of the little windows was always alive
with silvery motes. Here Gombauld worked, with a kind of concentrated
ferocity, during six or seven hours of each day. He was pursuing
something new, something terrific, if only he could catch it.</p>

<p>During the last eight years, nearly half of which had been spent
in the process of winning the war, he had worked his way industriously
through cubism. Now he had come out on the other side. He had
begun by painting a formalised nature; then, little by little,
he had risen from nature into the world of pure form, till in
the end he was painting nothing but his own thoughts, externalised
in the abstract geometrical forms of the mind’s devising. He found
the process arduous and exhilarating. And then, quite suddenly,
he grew dissatisfied; he felt himself cramped and confined within
intolerably narrow limitations. He was humiliated to find how
few and crude and uninteresting were the forms he could invent;
the inventions of nature were without number, inconceivably subtle
and elaborate. He had done with cubism. He was out on the other
side. But the cubist discipline preserved him from falling into
excesses of nature worship. He took from nature its rich, subtle,
elaborate forms, but his aim was always to work them into a whole
that should have the thrilling simplicity and formality of an
idea; to combine prodigious realism with prodigious simplification.
Memories of Caravaggio’s portentous achievements haunted him.
Forms of a breathing, living reality emerged from darkness, built
themselves up into compositions as luminously simple and single
as a mathematical idea. He thought of the "Call of Matthew," of
"Peter Crucified," of the "Lute players," of "Magdalen."  He had
the secret, that astonishing ruffian, he had the secret! And now
Gombauld was after it, in hot pursuit. Yes, it would be something
terrific, if only he could catch it.</p>

<p>For a long time an idea had been stirring and spreading, yeastily,
in his mind. He had made a portfolio full of studies, he had drawn
a cartoon; and now the idea was taking shape on canvas. A man
fallen from a horse. The huge animal, a gaunt white cart-horse,
filled the upper half of the picture with its great body. Its
head, lowered towards the ground, was in shadow; the immense bony
body was what arrested the eye, the body and the legs, which came
down on either side of the picture like the pillars of an arch.
On the ground, between the legs of the towering beast, lay the
foreshortened figure of a man, the head in the extreme foreground,
the arms flung wide to right and left. A white, relentless light
poured down from a point in the right foreground. The beast, the
fallen man, were sharply illuminated; round them, beyond and behind
them, was the night. They were alone in the darkness, a universe
in themselves. The horse’s body filled the upper part of the picture;
the legs, the great hoofs, frozen to stillness in the midst of
their trampling, limited it on either side. And beneath lay the
man, his foreshortened face at the focal point in the centre,
his arms outstretched towards the sides of the picture. Under
the arch of the horse’s belly, between his legs, the eye looked
through into an intense darkness; below, the space was closed
in by the figure of the prostrate man. A central gulf of darkness
surrounded by luminous forms...</p>

<p>The picture was more than half finished. Gombauld had been at
work all the morning on the figure of the man, and now he was
taking a rest&mdash;the time to smoke a cigarette. Tilting back his
chair till it touched the wall, he looked thoughtfully at his
canvas. He was pleased, and at the same time he was desolated.
In itself, the thing was good; he knew it. But that something
he was after, that something that would be so terrific if only
he could catch it&mdash;had he caught it? Would he ever catch it?</p>

<p>Three little taps&mdash;rat, tat, tat! Surprised, Gombauld turned
his eyes towards the door. Nobody ever disturbed him while he
was at work; it was one of the unwritten laws. "Come in!" he called.
The door, which was ajar, swung open, revealing, from the waist
upwards, the form of Mary. She had only dared to mount half-way
up the ladder. If he didn’t want her, retreat would be easier
and more dignified than if she climbed to the top.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She skipped up the remaining two rungs and was over the threshold
in an instant. "A letter came for you by the second post," she
said. "I thought it might be important, so I brought it out to
you." Her eyes, her childish face were luminously candid as she
handed him the letter. There had never been a flimsier pretext.</p>

<p>Gombauld looked at the envelope and put it in his pocket unopened.
"Luckily," he said, "it isn’t at all important. Thanks very much
all the same."</p>

<p>There was a silence; Mary felt a little uncomfortable. "May I
have a look at what you’ve been painting?" she had the courage
to say at last.</p>

<p>Gombauld had only half smoked his cigarette; in any case he wouldn’t
begin work again till he had finished. He would give her the five
minutes that separated him from the bitter end. "This is the best
place to see it from," he said.</p>

<p>Mary looked at the picture for some time without saying anything.
Indeed, she didn’t know what to say; she was taken aback, she
was at a loss. She had expected a cubist masterpiece, and here
was a picture of a man and a horse, not only recognisable as such,
but even aggressively in drawing. Trompe-l’oeil&mdash;there was no
other word to describe the delineation of that foreshortened figure
under the trampling feet of the horse. What was she to think,
what was she to say? Her orientations were gone. One could admire
representationalism in the Old Masters. Obviously. But in a modern...?
At eighteen she might have done so. But now, after five years
of schooling among the best judges, her instinctive reaction to
a contemporary piece of representation was contempt&mdash;an outburst
of laughing disparagement. What could Gombauld be up to? She had
felt so safe in admiring his work before. But now&mdash;she didn’t
know what to think. It was very difficult, very difficult.</p>

<p>"There’s rather a lot of chiaroscuro, isn’t there?" she ventured
at last, and inwardly congratulated herself on having found a
critical formula so gentle and at the same time so penetrating.</p>

<p>"There is," Gombauld agreed.</p>

<p>Mary was pleased; he accepted her criticism; it was a serious
discussion. She put her head on one side and screwed up her eyes.
"I think it’s awfully fine," she said. "But of course it’s a little
too...too...trompe-l’oeil for my taste." She looked at Gombauld,
who made no response, but continued to smoke, gazing meditatively
all the time at his picture. Mary went on gaspingly. "When I was
in Paris this spring I saw a lot of Tschuplitski. I admire his
work so tremendously. Of course, it’s frightfully abstract now&mdash;frightfully
abstract and frightfully intellectual. He just throws a few oblongs
on to his canvas&mdash;quite flat, you know, and painted in pure primary
colours. But his design is wonderful. He’s getting more and more
abstract every day. He’d given up the third dimension when I was
there and was just thinking of giving up the second. Soon, he
says, there’ll be just the blank canvas. That’s the logical conclusion.
Complete abstraction. Painting’s finished; he’s finishing it.
When he’s reached pure abstraction he’s going to take up architecture.
He says it’s more intellectual than painting. Do you agree?" she
asked, with a final gasp.</p>

<p>Gombauld dropped his cigarette end and trod on it. "Tschuplitski’s
finished painting," he said. "I’ve finished my cigarette. But
I’m going on painting." And, advancing towards her, he put his
arm round her shoulders and turned her round, away from the picture.</p>

<p>Mary looked up at him; her hair swung back, a soundless bell
of gold. Her eyes were serene; she smiled. So the moment had come.
His arm was round her. He moved slowly, almost imperceptibly,
and she moved with him. It was a peripatetic embracement. "Do
you agree with him?" she repeated. The moment might have come,
but she would not cease to be intellectual, serious.</p>

<p>"I don’t know. I shall have to think about it." Gombauld loosened
his embrace, his hand dropped from her shoulder. "Be careful going
down the ladder," he added solicitously.</p>

<p>Mary looked round, startled. They were in front of the open door.
She remained standing there for a moment in bewilderment. The
hand that had rested on her shoulder made itself felt lower down
her back; it administered three or four kindly little smacks.
Replying automatically to its stimulus, she moved forward.</p>

<p>"Be careful going down the ladder," said Gombauld once more.</p>

<p>She was careful. The door closed behind her and she was alone
in the little green close. She walked slowly back through the
farmyard; she was pensive.</p>
