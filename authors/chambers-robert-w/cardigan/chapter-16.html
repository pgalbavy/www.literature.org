<p>As we came to the high stockade which surrounded the Roanoke
Racing Plain, a bell struck somewhere inside; there was a moment's
silence, then a roar, "They're off!" and the confused shouting
of a crowd: "Greensleeves leads! Heather-Bee! Heather-Bee!" which
suddenly died out, ceased, then swelled into a sharp yell: "Orange
and Black! Orange wins! Baltimore! Baltimore! Baltimore! No! No!
The Jersey colt! The Jersey colt! Crimson! Crimson!" A hush; the
dull, double thud of galloping; a scramble, a rush, and a hurricane
of wild cheers: "Heather-Bee! Heather-Bee! Good Greensleeves!
Hi&mdash;yi&mdash;yi! Hooray!"</p>

<p>"I would I had a sovereign laid on this same Heather-Bee," said
Mount, mechanically fumbling in his empty pockets.</p>

<p>I glanced at him in surprise. Had the novelty of our present
peril already grown so stale that the shouting of a rabble over
a winning horse could blot it out?</p>

<p>He observed my disapproval and took his hands from his pocket-flaps,
muttering something about a passion for betting; and I paid the
gate-keepers the fee they demanded for us both, which included
a card giving us entry to the paddock.</p>

<p>When I entered I expected to see a "sweet and delightsome plain,"
as the public crier had advertised so loudly with his horn, but
truly I was not prepared for the beauty which was now revealed.
Bowered in trees the lovely pale green meadow lay, all starred
with buttercups and cut by the bronzed oval of the course. Pavilion
and field glowed in the colours of fluttering gowns; white and
scarlet and green marked the line where half a dozen mounted jockeys
walked their lean horses under the starter's tower. The sun blazed
down, gilding the chestnut necks of the horses; a cool breeze
bellied the bright sleeves of the jockeys, and blew the petticoats
and ribbons till they flapped like rainbow flags.</p>

<p>Mount was nudging me, sulkily demanding to be informed where
bets were placed, and adding that he knew a horse as well as the
next man. However, when he proposed that I allow him to double
my capital for me, I flatly refused, and reproached him for wishing
to risk anything now.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he muttered, "lay a sovereign yourself for luck;"
but I paid no attention, and fixed my eyes on the pavilion to
search it through and through for Silver Heels.</p>

<p>The longer I searched the more hopeless I felt my task to be;
I could see a score of maids in that vast bouquet, any one of
which might have been Silver Heels, but was not.</p>

<p>I then sought to discover Lady Shelton, a large, sluggish lady
whom I had noticed at Johnstown&mdash;not attracted by her beauty,
but to observe her how she did eat a barrel of oysters in pickle,
when visiting our guard-house with her kinsman, Colonel Guy Johnson.</p>

<p>I could not find her, though there were many ladies in the pavilion
who appeared to resemble her in largeness and girth, and in fatness
of hand and foot.</p>

<p>With my arm on Mount's, who had fallen a-pouting, I paced the
sward, searching the pavilion through and through, unmindful of
the battery of bright eyes which swept and raked us with indolent
contempt. Where was Silver Heels? Ay, where in the devil's name
had the little baggage hid herself? Many ladies and their consorts
in the pavilion were rising and passing under a yellow canopy
to the right, where there appeared to be a luncheon spread on
tables; and I did see and smell large bowls of sweetened punch,
Mount smelling the same and thoughtfully clacking his tongue.</p>

<p>"The quality," he observed, "have punch and French wines. Yet
I dare wager a pocketful o' sixpences that they have not my depth,
and God knows I would cheerfully prove it."</p>

<p>"Nobody is like to challenge you," I said, coldly. "Come, we
must find my cousin, Miss Warren, or our journey here fails."</p>

<p>The fox-hunting gentry in pink were coming across the field in
a body, spurs glistening and curly horns striking fire in the
sunshine. As they passed us, clink! clink! over the turf, a strangely
familiar eye met mine and held it&mdash;the puzzled eye of a young
man, dressed in red coat and tops and wearing a black velvet cap.
Where had I seen him before? He, too, appeared perplexed, and,
as he passed, involuntarily touched the peak of his cap with his
hunting-whip. Suddenly I knew him, and at the same moment he left
the company and came hastily up to me, offering his hand. The
fox-hunter was my old acquaintance, Mr. Bevan, the dragoon, and
he had actually recognized me under my sunburn and buckskins.
Rivals never forget.</p>

<p>However, there was no mistaking his cordiality, and I should
have been an oaf and a churl not to have met him fairly by the
hand he offered.</p>

<p>"<em>Sans arrière pensée, sans rancune!</em>" he said, heartily,
the French not pleasing me; but I returned his straightforward
clasp and told him I bore no more malice than did he.</p>

<p>"I heard you speak in 'Governor's Hall,'" he said, and I saw
his eyes twinkle, though his mouth betrayed no mirth, so I only
bowed seriously and told him I was honoured by his presence.</p>

<p>"Was not that gentleman Patrick Henry&mdash;the one in black who led
the poor savage out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you know Patrick Henry better than I do," I answered,
cautiously.</p>

<p>He laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Pray, believe me, Mr. Cardigan, I am not prying. It is rumoured
that Patrick Henry has been at some rebel tavern in town. A few
thought they recognized him in 'Governor's Hall,' and many claim
that he wrote that great speech for Logan."</p>

<p>"If he did he is the greatest orator of our times," I said.</p>

<p>"Do you believe he did?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, bluntly.</p>

<p>He looked at me with curious, friendly eyes.</p>

<p>"You have become famous, Mr. Cardigan, since we last met."</p>

<p>"You would say 'notorious,'" I rejoined, smiling.</p>

<p>He protested vigorously:</p>

<p>"No! no! I understand you are not of our party, but, believe
me, were I a&mdash;a&mdash;patriot, as they say, I should be proud to hear
a comrade utter the words you uttered in 'Governor's Hall'!"</p>

<p>"Did I say I was a rebel?" I asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well," he rejoined, "if that speech did not commit you, we are
but a dull company here in Pittsburg."</p>

<p>He glanced after his comrades, who were now entering the canopied
space where refreshments lay piled between the bottles and punch-bowls;
and he straightway invited me, turning with a bow to include Jack
Mount, whom I had not dared present under his proper name.</p>

<p>Mount began to accept with a flourish, but I cut him short with
excuses, which Mr. Bevan accepted politely, expressing his regret.
Then again he offered me his hand so frankly that I drew him aside,
and begged his indulgence and forgetfulness for my boorish behaviour
at Johnson Hall.</p>

<p>"The fault was mine," he said, instantly; "I sneered at your
militia and deserved your rebuke. Had I not deserved it, I should
have called you out, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"You conducted properly," said I; "on the contrary, I must blush
for my churlishness when you favoured my hilt with a ribbon."</p>

<p>His friendly eyes grew grave, and he began bending his hunting-whip
into a bow, thoughtfully studying the buttercups at his feet.</p>

<p>After a moment he looked up, saying, "Do you know that this morning
the banns were published for the wedding of Lord Dunmore and your
kinswoman, Miss Warren?"</p>

<p>So, after all, and in spite of my letter, Dunmore had done this
shameful thing! I think my scowling face gave Bevan his answer,
for he laid his hand on my arm and looked at me earnestly.</p>

<p>"It is no shame," he said, "for me to tell you that Miss Warren
has refused me. How can a heart be humbled which has loved such
a woman?"</p>

<p>"She is not a woman yet," I said, harshly; "she is a child, and
a wilful one at that! Damnation! sir, it maddens me to see men
after her, and she but fifteen!"</p>

<p>"Miss Warren celebrated her sixteenth birthday with a dinner
at Lady Shelton's a week since," said Bevan, colouring up.</p>

<p>I thought a moment, frowning and counting on my fingers. Yes,
that was true; Silver Heels was sixteen now. But that only increased
my irritation, for the danger suddenly assumed menacing proportions,
which must increase every moment now that the barriers of childhood
no longer barred the men who hunted her.</p>

<p>"I have told you this," said Bevan, stiffly, "because I believed
you were in love with Miss Warren, and must suffer great pain
to learn of her betrothal to Lord Dunmore."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what then, sir?" I asked, angry and perplexed.</p>

<p>"This, Mr. Cardigan! That my own ill fortune has not left me
less devoted to her happiness; that this marriage is a monstrous
thing and will one day drive her to despair; that I do most earnestly
believe that Miss Warren loves a man more worthy of her."</p>

<p>"What man?" I demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>"You should not ask me that!" he retorted, more sharply still.</p>

<p>"But I do! Confound it, I know from her own lips that she dotes
on some conceited, meddling ass! And if I can but lay my hand
on his collar&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bevan was staring at me in such frank amazement that I bit my
words short.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Warren confess that she loved?" he asked.</p>

<p>I assented in silence.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a fool?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>Bevan burst into a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you, sir, that I have heard her praise this
same meddling fool and laud his every word as Heaven's own wisdom!
Ay, sir, and boast of his bravery and his wit and his glorious
person till I thought this fool a very god from Olympus, and marvelled
at my own blindness in not earlier perceiving it."</p>

<p>"You know him?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Indeed, he is now well known in Pittsburg town, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him."</p>

<p>After a moment's silence I said, "Is he worthy of her?"</p>

<p>"What man is?" he answered, quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, many men; pardon, but you are in love, and so are blinded.
I see clearly. I know my cousin, and I know that she is a wilful
maid who has raised the devil out o' bounds, and is ready to run
to cover now."</p>

<p>Bevan was red in the face.</p>

<p>"It is a kinsman's privilege to criticise," he said.</p>

<p>"A kinsman's duty!" I added. "Were I not jealous for her honour
and happiness, I would cry Dunmore <em>merci!</em> and think my
cousin a fortunate maid! Curse him! When I think of that man I
can scarce look at my hands so guiltless of the creature's blood.
But they will not stay clean long if he pushes me. God help the
man who bars our way northward!"</p>

<p>"If you mean to take her," said Bevan, in a low voice, "I wish
you godspeed. But how can you pass the fort, Mr. Cardigan?"</p>

<p>"Do you believe Dunmore would detain us?" I asked, blankly.</p>

<p>"I know he would if he heard of it in time."</p>

<p>I thought a moment, then laid my hand on Bevan's shoulder, and,
on the impulse, told him what our plans were. He listened in silent
sympathy, nodding at times, turning to glance at Mount, who sat
under a tree chewing grass-blades and sniffing at the distant
punch-bowls.</p>

<p>When I had told him all, he reflected, slowly switching the sod
with his whip. Presently he said: "I am glad you told me this.
I will be at the King's Road gate to-night. If there is trouble
with the sentries I will vouch for you."</p>

<p>His quiet generosity touched me deeply, and I told him so.</p>

<p>"Could a gentleman do less?" he asked, gravely. Then a sudden
smile lighted his eyes, and he added: "She will never give up
her Olympian god, though she thought to fling him away for his
indifference. And, Mr. Cardigan, though this man she loves is
truly all she claims, he is, as she told you, the greatest fool
on earth!"</p>

<p>"Then he can never have her!" I said, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;wait!" he replied, with a curiously sad smile. "A fool and
his folly are soon parted when in the company of Miss Warren."</p>

<p>"You believe he will follow her? That's what she said, too!"
I exclaimed, hotly.</p>

<p>Again he burst into a laugh which was quite free from bitterness.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is certain to follow you," he said. "Black Care rides
behind the horseman, but this man will stick closer than your
own shadow."</p>

<p>"We'll see," I muttered.</p>

<p>He offered me his hand, pressing mine firmly.</p>

<p>"You know Miss Warren is here?" he asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>"I am seeking her," said I.</p>

<p>"She walked to the hill, yonder, with Lady Shelton, after the
last race," he said, pointing with his whip to a wooded knoll
which I could just see rising behind the paddocks.</p>

<p>"Dunmore is searching everywhere for her," he added, significantly.</p>

<p>So we parted, I warm with gratitude, he quietly cordial, yet
still wearing that singular smile which I could not quite understand.</p>

<p>As for pity, I had none for him, nor did I believe his sorrow
could be very profound over his dismissal by Silver Heels. But
then I knew nothing of such matters, having never been in love.
As for the gentleman-god who had turned Silver Heels's silly head,
I meant to deal with him the instant he made his appearance.</p>

<p>Mount, tired of cropping the herbage under his tree, rejoined
me fretfully, demanding to know why I had not accepted the invitation
to refreshment; and I told him quite plainly that I had no intention
to further test his sobriety, in view of the work we had before
us.</p>

<p>Together we entered the paddock, where hostlers and jockeys were
grooming the beautiful, slender horses, and though I longed to
linger, I dared not stay longer than to hug one splendid mare
and whisper in her listening, silky ears that she was a beauty
without peer.</p>

<p>The boy who was washing her sourly warned me off, doubtless fearing
the touch of a stranger, lest he prove one of those miscreants
who harm horses. So I passed on, nodding good-bye to the lovely
mare, Heather-Bee, as she was called by the name stitched on her
blanket.</p>

<p>In the rear of the paddock a path led through a gate and up the
wooded knoll. I looked around for Mount; he was plaintively helping
himself to a cup of water from the horse-trough spring, so I waited.
And, as I stood there, down the path came two fat people, a lady
and her escort, picking their way with all the majesty of elephants.
I knew Lady Shelton at once; none could mistake that faded and
moon-like face with the little selfish under-lip and the folded
creases beside a mouth which was made only for feeding. None could
mistake those little fat feet, trotting under the daintily raised
petticoat.</p>

<p>She scarcely deigned to glance at me; the gentleman beside her
paid me no attention; and I was thankful enough that Lady Shelton
had not recognized me.</p>

<p>They were waddling down the paddock some distance away when Mount
rejoined me, complaining of the cheerless draught which my obstinacy
had compelled him to swallow, and we passed the gate and ascended
the pretty slope.</p>

<p>We were, perhaps, half-way up the slope, when I heard a footstep
behind us and glanced back. What was my astonishment to behold
the Weasel trotting along at our heels.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you come from?" I asked.</p>

<p>"From the 'Virginia Arms,'" he replied, seriously. "I like to
be near Jack."</p>

<p>Mount, in pleased surprise, had already laid his great paw on
the Weasel's shoulder. Now he smiled at the little careworn man
with wonderful tenderness. It was strange, the affection between
these two roaming men, the naïve fidelity of the Weasel, the fostering
care of the younger giant, whose attitude was sometimes fatherly,
sometimes filial.</p>

<p>The Weasel looked back at the course where, already, the bell
was striking to warn the jockeys, and where, one after another,
the horses cantered out to the judges' stand and stood restively,
or backed and pirouetted and reared in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Have you ever before seen a race?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I? A race?" He waved his hand with a peculiarly sad gesture.
"Many a noble horse has carried my colours on Cambridge Downs,"
he said, simply. "Many a plate have my youngsters won for me,
Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>He looked out over the green meadow, folding his small, dry hands
meekly.</p>

<p>"Lord, Lord," he murmured, "the world has changed since then!
The world has changed!"</p>

<p>"Friends have not," murmured Mount.</p>

<p>"No, no, you are quite right, Jack," said Renard, hastily.</p>

<p>"Then who the devil cares how the world may change," snapped
Mount. "Come, Cade, old friend, sit you here in the sweet grass
and you and I will wager straws on the jockeys' colours yonder,
while our young gentleman here lightly goes a-courting!"</p>

<p>I did not choose to notice Mount's remark, knowing that he meant
no offence, so I left the pair sitting on the sod and climbed
the remaining half of the slope alone.</p>

<p>Now, no sooner had I reached the top of the knoll than I perceived
Silver Heels, sitting upon a rock, reading a letter; and when
I drew near, my moccasins making no sound, I could not help but
see that it was my letter she perused so diligently. It gratified
me to observe that she apparently valued the instructions in my
letter, and I trusted she intended to profit by them, for Heaven
knew she needed admonition and the judicious counsel of a mature
intellect.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," I began, kindly.</p>

<p>She started, then crushed the letter to a ball, thrusting it
into her bosom.</p>

<p>"Oh, Michael, you are insufferable!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed, astonished.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled and she sprang up.</p>

<p>"I know not whether to laugh or cry, so vexed am I!" she stammered,
and called me booby and Paul Pry, drying her eyes the while her
tongue upbraided me.</p>

<p>"I am not spying," said I, hotly; "don't pretend that scrawl
was a love-letter, for I know it to be my own!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you <em>did</em> come spying!" she flashed out, stamping
her foot furiously.</p>

<p>"Lord! was there ever such a spiteful maid!" I cried. "I came
here to have a word with you concerning our journey this night.
I care not a penny whistle for your love-letters. Can you not
understand that?"</p>

<p>She turned somewhat pale and stood still. Her under-lip quivered
between her teeth.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, slowly, "I understand."</p>

<p>I had not meant to speak harshly, and I told her so. She nodded,
scarcely listening. Then I spoke of our coming journey, which,
though it galled me to say so, I explained to her was nothing
less than a flight.</p>

<p>She acquiesced, saying she was ready, and that she only longed
to leave the town forever. She said that she had known nothing
but unhappiness here, and that the memory of it would always be
abhorrent, which surprised me, as I had understood that the gentleman-god
dwelt hereabouts. However, I said nothing to disturb her or endanger
her docility, and we discussed our plans reasonably and with perfect
calmness.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see that she already appeared to be in better
health. Rouge and patch had disappeared; her colour was better;
her eyes brighter; her lips redder. Also, her gown was simpler
and more pleasing to me, and her hair bore no extravagant towers,
but was sweetly puffed and rolled from her white forehead. Still,
her arms were more frail than I liked to see, and there rested
a faint bluish shadow under each eye.</p>

<p>"How came you to find me out, here in my retreat?" she asked,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bevan told me," I replied, watching her.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Bevan," she murmured; "how jealous you were of him."</p>

<p>"He is a splendid fellow," I declared, much ashamed.</p>

<p>"So you are already friends," she observed, in a musing way.</p>

<p>"I trust so," I replied, fervently.</p>

<p>"Is it not sudden?" she asked.</p>

<p>But I would not commit myself.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," I said, "does it not seem good to be together
again here in the sunshine?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" she cried, impetuously, then stopped.</p>

<p>Doubtless she was thinking of the gentleman-god.</p>

<p>I sat down on the grass beside her and began pulling buttercups.
One I held under her white chin to see if she still loved butter.</p>

<p>"I love all that I ever loved," she said, leaning forward over
her knees to pluck a tiny blue bud in the grass.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that day you bit me in the school-room?" I asked,
with youthful brutality.</p>

<p>The crimson flooded her temples. She involuntarily glanced at
my left hand; the scar was still there, and she covered her eyes
tightly with her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! <em>Oh!</em>" she murmured, in horror. "What a savage
I was! No wonder you hated me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only at moments," I said, magnanimously; "I always liked you,
Silver Heels."</p>

<p>Presently she drew her hands from her eyes and touched her flushed
cheeks with the blue blossom thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Michael," she said, "I &mdash;I never told you, but I was very
glad when you came to explain to me that night in the pantry."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, stiffly, "you certainly concealed your pleasure.
Lord, child, how you scorned me!"</p>

<p>"I know it," she muttered, in quick vexation; "I was a perfect
fool. You see, I &mdash;I was hurt so deeply that it frightened
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You ought to have known that I meant nothing," said I. "Mrs.
Hamilton tormented me till I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>well, whatever
I did was harmless. Anyway, it was done because I thought I loved
you &mdash;I mean like a lover, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"After that," said I, smiling, "I knew my own mind."</p>

<p>"And I knew mine," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"And now I know the difference between hurt vanity and love,"
I added, complacently.</p>

<p>"I, too," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"You can't know such things; you are scarcely sixteen," I insisted.</p>

<p>"My mother was wedded at sixteen; she wedded for love."</p>

<p>After a silence I asked her how she knew that, as she had never
seen her mother.</p>

<p>"Sir Peter Warren has told me in his letters," she said, simply.
"Besides, you are wrong when you say I never saw my mother. I
did, but I was too young to remember. She died when I was a year
old."</p>

<p>"But you never saw your father," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh no. He was killed at sea by the French."</p>

<p>That was news to me, although I had always been aware that he
had died at sea on board his Majesty's ship <em>Leda</em>, one
of Sir Peter's squadron.</p>

<p>"Who told you he was killed by the French?" I asked, soberly.</p>

<p>"Sir Peter. A few days after you left Johnstown I received a
packet from Sir Peter. It came on a war-ship which put in at New
York, and the express brought it. Sir Peter also wrote to Sir
William. I don't know what he said. Sir William was very silent
with me after that, but just before I left with Lady Shelton to
come here, he had a long talk with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>Silver Heels twirled the blue bud in her fingers.</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;to&mdash;to tell you if I saw you in Pittsburg&mdash;to&mdash;to &mdash;I
mean that I was to say to you that Sir William had changed his
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About what?" I demanded, irritably.</p>

<p>"Our betrothal."</p>

<p>"Our betrothal?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am not to wed you."</p>

<p>"Of course not," I said, rather blankly; "but I thought Sir William
desired it. He said that he did. He said it to me!"</p>

<p>"He no longer wishes it," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered, faintly.</p>

<p>I was hurt.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," I observed, resentfully, "doubtless Sir William
has chosen a wealthy gentleman of rank and distinction for you.
He is quite right. I am only a cornet of horse, and won't be that
long. All the same, I cannot see why he forbids me to wed you.
He told me he wished it! I cannot see why he should so slight
me! Why should he forbid me to wed you?"</p>

<p>"Do you care?" asked Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Who &mdash;I? Care? Why&mdash;why, I don't know. It is not very pleasant
to be told you are too poor and humble to wed your own kin if
you wish to. Suppose I wished to?"</p>

<p>After a moment she said: "Well&mdash;it's too late now."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I said, sharply. "I do not see why I should
be driven away from you! It is unfair! It is unkind! It is mortifying
and I don't like it! See here, Silver Heels, why should Sir William
drive me away from you?"</p>

<p>"You have never needed driving," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have!" I retorted. "Didn't you drive me away for Bevan?"</p>

<p>After a silence she stole a glance at me.</p>

<p>"Would you come back&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>Something in her voice startled me.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes," I stammered, not knowing exactly what she meant;
"I cannot see that there is such difference in rank between us
that Sir William should forbid me to wed you. Of course you would
not wed beneath you, and, as for me, I'd sooner cut my head off!"</p>

<p>"I was afraid," she ventured, "that perhaps&mdash;perhaps Sir William
thought you had become too fine for me. I could not endure to
wed you if that were true."</p>

<p>This was a new idea. Was it true that my quality unfitted me
to mate with Silver Heels? The idea did not gratify me now.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you this," said I, "that if I loved you in that way&mdash;you
know what I mean! &mdash;I'd wed you anyhow!"</p>

<p>"But I would not wed you!" she said, haughtily.</p>

<p>"You would not refuse me?" I asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>"I should hate you&mdash;if you were above me&mdash;in rank!"</p>

<p>"Even if you loved me before?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;even if I loved you&mdash;as I love&mdash;him whom I love."</p>

<p>Her clear eyes were looking straight into mine now. Again her
voice had stirred some new and untouched chord which curiously
thrilled, sounding stealthily within me.</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes to the blue blossom in her fingers, and
I saw her crush it. What soft, white fingers she had! The flushed
tips, crushing the blossom, fascinated me.</p>

<p>Again, suddenly, my heart began to beat heavily, thumping in
my throat so strangely that I shivered and passed my hand over
my breast.</p>

<p>Silver Heels bent lower over her idle hands; her fingers, so
exquisite, were still now.</p>

<p>Presently I said, "Who is this fool whom you love?"</p>

<p>I had not thought to fright or hurt her, but she flushed and
burned until all her face was surging scarlet to her hair.</p>

<p>"Silver Heels," I stammered, catching her fingers.</p>

<p>At the touch the strange thrill struck through my body and I
choked, unable to utter a word; but the desire for her hands set
me quivering, and I caught her fingers and drew them, interlocked,
from her eyes. Her eyes! Their beauty amazed me; their frightened,
perilous sweetness drew my head down to them. Breathless, her
mouth touched mine; against me her heart was beating; then suddenly
she had gone, and I sprang to my feet to find her standing tearful,
quivering, with her hands on her throbbing throat. I leaned against
a sapling, dazed, content to meet her eyes and strive to think.
Useless! In my whirling thoughts I could but repeat her name,
endlessly. Other thoughts crept in, but flew scattering to the
four winds, while every pulse within me throbbed out her name,
repeating, ceaselessly repeating, in my beating heart.</p>

<p>We were so poor in years, so utterly untried in love, that the
strangeness of it set us watching one another. Passion, shaking
frail bodies, startles, till pain, always creeping near, intrudes,
dismaying maid and youth to love's confusion.</p>

<p>With a sort of curious terror she watched me leaning there, and
I saw her trembling fingers presently busied with the silken hat
ribbons under her chin, tying and retying as though she knew not
what she did. Then of a sudden she dropped on the rock and fell
a-weeping without a sound; and I knelt beside her, crushing her
shoulders close to me, and kissing her neck and hands, nay, the
very damask on her knees, and the silken tongue of her buckled
shoon among the buttercups.</p>

<p>Why she wept I knew not, nor did she&mdash;nor did I ask her why.
Her frail hands fell listlessly, scarcely moving under my lips.
Once she laid her arm about my neck, then dropped it as though
repelled. And never a word could we find to break the silence.</p>

<p>I heard the wind blowing somewhere in the world, but where, I
cared not. I heard blossoms discreetly stirring, and dusky branches
interlacing, taking counsel together behind their leafy, secret
screens. My ears were filled with voiceless whisperings, delicate
and noiseless words were forming in the silence, "I love you";
and my dumb tongue and lips, unstirring, understood, and listened.
Then, when my sweetheart had also heard, she turned and put both
arms around my neck, linking her fingers, and her gray eyes looked
down at me, beside her knees.</p>

<p>"Now you must go," she was repeating, touching her little French
hat with tentative fingers to straighten it, but eyes and lips
tenderly smiling at me. "My Lady Shelton and Sir Timerson Chank
will surely return to catch you here if you hasten not&mdash;dear heart."</p>

<p>"But will you not tell me when you first loved me, Silver Heels?"
I persisted.</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;if you must be told&mdash;it was on the day when you
first wore your uniform, and I saw you were truly a man!"</p>

<p>"That day! When you scarcely spoke to me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that was the reason. Yet now I think of it, I know I have
always loved you dearly; else why should I have been so hurt when
you misused me; why should I have cried abed so many, many nights,
vowing to my heart that I did hate you as I hated no man! Ah&mdash;dear
friend, you will never know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But," I insisted, "you grew cool enough to wed Lord Dunmore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Horror! Why must you ever hark back to him when I tell you it
was not I who did that, but a cruelly used and foolish child,
stung with the pain of your indifference, maddened to hear you
talk of mating me as though I were your hound!&mdash;and my only thought
was to put myself above you and beyond your reach to shame me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Silver Heels!" I murmured, aghast at my own wickedness.</p>

<p>But she was already smiling again, with her slender hands laid
on my shoulders.</p>

<p>"All that tastes sweetly&mdash;now," she said.</p>

<p>"It is ashes in my mouth," I said, bitterly, and upbraided myself
aloud, until she placed her fingers on my face and silently signed
me to turn around.</p>

<p>At the same instant a wheezy noise came to my ears, and the next
moment, over the edge of the slope, a large, round face rose like
the full moon.</p>

<p>Fascinated, I watched it; the wheezing grew louder and more laboured.</p>

<p>"Lady Shelton! Oh, go! go!" whispered Silver Heels. But it was
too late for flight had I been so minded.</p>

<p>Suddenly my Lady Shelton's fat feet began to trot as though of
their own notion, for her cold, flabby features expressed no emotion,
although, from the moment her moon-like face had risen behind
the hill, I saw that her eyes were fixed on me.</p>

<p>After her puffed the fat gentleman, Sir Timerson Chank, and behind
him came mincing Lord Dunmore, fanning his face with a lace handkerchief,
his little gold-edged French hat under his arm. Faith, he was
in a rare temper.</p>

<p>Lady Shelton paddled up to Silver Heels, halted, and panted at
her. Then she turned on me and panted at me until her voice returned.
With her voice, her features assumed a most extraordinary change;
billows of fat agitated the expanse of chin and cheek, and her
voice, babyish in fury, made me jump, for it sounded as though
some tiny, pixy creature, buried inside of her, was scolding me.</p>

<p>Sir Timerson Chank now bore down on my left and presently rounded
to, delivering his broadside at short range; but I turned on him
savagely, bidding him hold his tongue, which so astonished him
that he obeyed me.</p>

<p>As for Dunmore, his shrill prattle never ceased, and he danced
and vapoured and fingered his small-sword, till my hands itched
to throw him into the blackberry thicket.</p>

<p>"If," said I, to Lady Shelton, "you are pleased to forbid me
your door, pray remember, madam, that your authority extends no
farther! I shall not ask your permission to address my cousin,
Miss Warren&mdash;nor yours!" I added, wheeling on Sir Timerson Chank.</p>

<p>"Sir Timerson! Sir Timerson! Arrest him! You are a magistrate.
Sir Timerson! Arrest him! Oh, I'm all of a twitter!" panted Lady
Shelton.</p>

<p>But Sir Timerson Chank made no sign of compliance.</p>

<p>"Lord Dunmore," I said, "by what privilege do you assume to vapour
and handle the hilt of your small-sword in Miss Warren's presence?"</p>

<p>"Sink me!" cried Lord Dunmore. "Sink me now, Mr. Cardigan; you
should know that I have privileges, sir. I will have you to know
that I have privileges, sir! Crib me! but I will assert my rights!"</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;what?" I replied, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"My rights! My privilege to defend Miss Warren&mdash;my rights, sir!
I stand upon them, crib me, if I don't!"</p>

<p>"Shame on you!" cried Lady Shelton, panting angrily at me. "Shame
on you&mdash;you mannerless, roving, blustering, hectoring rebel!&mdash;you&mdash;you
<em>boy</em>! Oh, I'm all of a twitter! Sir Timerson, I'm all
of a twitter!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh tally!" broke in Dunmore, peeping at me through his quizzing-glass.
"The lad's moon-mad! A guinea to a china orange that the lad's
moon-mad. You may see it in his eyes, Sir Timerson. You may see
he's non compos&mdash;eh, Sir Timerson? Sink me if he isn't!"</p>

<p>How I controlled myself I scarcely know, but I strove to remember
that a hand raised to Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, meant
the ruin of my plans for the night. As I stood staring at the
wizened macaroni, aching to take his sword, break it, and spank
him with the fragments, I saw Jack Mount and the Weasel cautiously
reconnoitring the situation from the hill's edge.</p>

<p>Ere I could motion them away they had made up their minds that
I was in distress, and now they came swaggering into our circle,
thumbs hooked in their shirts, saluting poor Silver Heels with
a flourish that drew a thin scream from Lady Shelton.</p>

<p>"Trouble with this old scratch-wig?" inquired Mount, nodding
his head sideways towards Lord Dunmore.</p>

<p>"Damme!" gasped Dunmore. "Do you know who I am, you beast?"</p>

<p>"I know you're a ruddled old hunks," said Mount, carelessly.
"Who may the other guinea wig-stand be, Mr. Cardigan?"</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked across at Sir Timerson Chank, then suddenly
his eyes grew big as saucers and a low whistle escaped his lips.</p>

<p>"Gad!" he exclaimed. "It's the magistrate or I'm a codfish!"</p>

<p>"Fellow!" roared Sir Timerson, his face purpling with passion.
"Fellow! Thunder and Mars! Lord Dunmore, this is Jack Mount, the
highwayman!"</p>

<p>For an instant Dunmore stood transfixed, then he screamed out:
"Close the gates! Close the gates, Sir Timerson! He shall not
escape, damme! No, he shall not escape! Call the constables, Sir
Timerson; call the constables!"</p>

<p>Mount had paled a little, but now as Sir Timerson began to bellow
for a constable, his colour came back and he stepped forward,
laying a heavy hand on the horrified magistrate's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come now; come now," he said; "stop that bawling, or I'll put
your head between your knees and truss you up like a basted capon!"
And he gave him a slight shake which dislodged Sir Timerson's
forty-guinea wig.</p>

<p>"You Tory hangman," said Mount, scowling, "if I ever took a penny
from you it was to help drive you and your thieving crew out of
the land! Do you hear that? Now go and howl for your thief-takers,
and take his Lordship, here, with you to squall for his precious
constables!" And he gave Sir Timerson a shove over the grassy
slope.</p>

<p>Lady Shelton shrieked as Sir Timerson went wabbling down the
hill, but Mount turned fiercely on Dunmore and shook his huge
fist under his nose.</p>

<p>"Hunt me down if you dare!" he growled. "Move a finger to molest
me and the people shall know how you stop public runners and scalp
them, too! Oho! Now you scare, eh? Out o' my way, you toothless
toad!"</p>

<p>Dunmore shrank back, almost toppling down the hill, which he
hurriedly descended and made off after Sir Timerson towards the
pavilion.</p>

<p>"Come," said I, "that will do for the present, Jack. Look yonder!
Your friend, the magistrate, is toddling fast to trap you. You
should be starting if you mean to get out of this scrape a free
man."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" replied Mount, swaggering. "I've time to dine if I chose,
but I'm not hungry. Come, Cade; we needs must kick some planks
out of that stockade below us, if they guard the gates. But we
have time to stroll."</p>

<p>The Weasel did not appear to hear him, and stood staring at Silver
Heels with an expression so strange that it was almost terrifying.
For a moment I feared he had gone stark mad.</p>

<p>"Cade!" repeated Mount. "What is the matter, Cade? What do you
see? Not another fat magistrate? Cade! What on earth troubles
you, old friend?" And he stepped quickly to the Weasel's side,
I following.</p>

<p>"Cade!" he cried, shaking his comrade's arm.</p>

<p>The Weasel turned a ghastly face.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" he motioned, with his lips.</p>

<p>"Do you mean Miss Warren?" I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"A ghost," he muttered, shivering in every limb.</p>

<p>Presently he began to move towards Silver Heels, and Mount and
I drew him back by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Cade! Cade!" cried Mount, anxiously. "Don't look like that,
for God's sake!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake," repeated Renard, trembling.</p>

<p>His eyes were dim with tears. Mount leaned over to me and whispered:
"He is mad!" But the Weasel heard him and looked up slowly.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said; "a little wrong in the head, Jack, only a
little wrong. I thought I saw my wife, Jack, or her ghost&mdash;ay,
her ghost&mdash;the ghost of her youth and mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>A spasm shook him; he hid his face in his hands a moment, then
scoured out the tears with his withered fingers.</p>

<p>"Ask the young lady's pardon for me," he muttered; "I have frightened
her."</p>

<p>I walked over to Silver Heels, who stood beside Lady Shelton,
amazed at the scenes which had passed so swiftly before her eyes,
and I drew her aside, mechanically asking pardon from the petrified
dowager.</p>

<p>"He is a little mad," I said; "he thought he saw in you the ghost
of his lost wife. Sorrow has touched his brain, I think, but he
is very gentle and means no harm. Speak to him, Silver Heels.
I owe my life to those two men."</p>

<p>She stood looking at them a moment, then, laying her hand on
my arm, she went slowly across to Mount and Renard.</p>

<p>They uncovered as she came up; the Weasel's face grew dead and
fixed, but the pathos in his eyes was indescribable.</p>

<p>"If you are Mr. Cardigan's friends, you must be mine, too," said
Silver Heels, sweetly. "All you have done for him, you have done
for me."</p>

<p>Fascinated, Mount gaped at her, tongue-tied, clutching his coon-skin
cap to his breast. But the fibre of the two men showed the difference
of their grain in a startling form, for, into Renard's shrunken
frame came something that straightened him and changed him; he
lifted his head with a peculiar dignity almost venerable, and,
stepping forward, took Silver Heels's small hand in his with a
delicate grace that any man might envy. Then he bent and touched
her fingers with his lips.</p>

<p>"An old man's devotion, my child," he said. "You have your mother's
eyes."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my mother's eyes?" faltered Silver Heels, glancing fearfully
at me.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;your mother's eyes&mdash;and all of her. I knew her, child."</p>

<p>"My&mdash;mother?"</p>

<p>He touched her hand with his lips again, slowly.</p>

<p>"I am a little troubled in my head sometimes," he said, gravely.
"Do you fear me?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>no," murmured Silver Heels.</p>

<p>Their eyes met in silence.</p>

<p>Presently I took Silver Heels by the hand and led her back to
Lady Shelton.</p>

<p>"Madam," I said, "if aught of harm comes to these two men, through
Lord Dunmore, betwixt this hour and the same hour to-morrow, there
is not a hole on earth into which he can creep for mercy. Tell
this to my Lord Dunmore, and bid him stay away. I speak in no
heat, madam; I mean what I say. For as surely as I stand here
now, that hour in which Lord Dunmore and Sir Timerson start to
hunt us down, they die. Pray you, madam, so inform those gentlemen."</p>

<p>Then I turned to Silver Heels, who impulsively stretched out
both hands. The next moment I rejoined Mount and Renard, and we
passed rapidly through the grove and down the hill to the stockade,
where Mount drove out a plank with his huge shoulder, and we were
free of Roanoke Plain.</p>
