<p>Oscar Gleeson, the Texan, was correct in his suspicion of the
purpose of the Comanches in making Captain Shirril their prisoner;
having secured possession of him, they intended to force a liberal
ransom on the part of his friends, as a condition of his restoration
to liberty.</p>

<p>The act was not only an audacious one on their part, but it will
be perceived that the fulfilment of the terms was certain to be
attended with the gravest difficulty. The cowboys were not to
be trifled with, and, since it was inevitable that a point would
be reached where one party must of necessity trust the pledges
of the other, a violent collision with serious consequences appeared
unavoidable.</p>

<p>It has been shown that it was not until he arrived close to the
hills, among which the red men had fled with their captive, that
there was any response to the signal he displayed almost from
the first.</p>

<p>The moment he caught sight of the two warriors, he stopped his
mustang and awaited their approach. It was not singular that a
man who had crossed the Indian Nation so frequently as this veteran,
recognized the couple as Wygwind, the chieftain, and Richita,
whom he had met more than once and knew to be two of the worst
miscreants belonging to the American race.</p>

<p>With no evidence, however, of his identification, he deliberately
lowered his flag of truce, and returning it to its place around
his brawny neck, secured it by tying the usual knot. Then with
a half military salute he asked:</p>

<p>"Is the white man with you hurt bad?"</p>

<p>"Hurt not much," replied Wygwind, who spoke English far better
than his comrade.</p>

<p>"Why did you take him away?"</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, is of melancholy temperament,
but at this question the Comanche displayed an unmistakable grin
which revealed his even white teeth.</p>

<p>"We sell him&mdash;he worth good much."</p>

<p>"What price do you ask for him?" demanded Gleeson, coming to
the point with undiplomatic abruptness.</p>

<p>The expectation of the Texan was that these ambassadors would
demand a large number of cattle, probably five hundred, in exchange
for their valuable captive. He ardently hoped that such would
prove the case, for he had already formed a scheme for paying
off the rogues in their own coin.</p>

<p>His intention was to transfer the cattle, managing the payment,
however, with such care that all breach of faith on the part of
the captain's enemies would be frustrated. Then, after he was
safe with his friends, and the property was placed in the hands
of the Comanches, it would be necessary for the red men to <em>hold</em>
them. The field would become an open one, and before they could
turn their newly acquired property to account, they were likely
to hear from the original proprietors.</p>

<p>But Wygwind was too shrewd to be ensnared in this style. He and
his partners, in elaborating the scheme that had worked so well
up to this point, had foreseen the very contingency in the mind
of the white man, who sat on his horse before the delegates.</p>

<p>"We take horses&mdash;so many."</p>

<p>In making this answer, Wygwind raised the fingers and thumbs
of his hands twice in succession. Unable to count a score in the
English language, he proved nevertheless that he had a clear idea
of the number, which was indicated so plainly that the Texan could
make no mistake as to his meaning.</p>

<p>Gleeson was disappointed as well as surprised. Since each cowboy
was provided with at least three horses, there were about thirty
with the company. To turn two-thirds of these over to the red
men would seriously cripple the whites, who had still a long journey
before them.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it must effect a material change in the programme
the Texan had formed. Horseflesh is as dear to the red as to the
white man, and, well mounted as the former would be after the
exchange, the chances of recovering the property by the Texans
must be reduced to the minimum.</p>

<p>But the new phase of affairs had to be met. Suppressing all evidence
of his feelings, Gleeson said:</p>

<p>"We have not enough horses to give what you ask; we will let
you have <em>that</em> many."</p>

<p>And he held up the thumb and fingers of his right hand. Wygwind
with another grin shook his head.</p>

<p>"Take <em>so</em> many"&mdash;and he repeated the gestures by which
he first indicated twenty.</p>

<p>Gleeson now doubled his offer, which, it will be understood,
was half the price demanded; but the wily Comanche felt that he
was in a position to dictate terms, and remained inexorable.</p>

<p>The Texan knew it was useless to haggle, but he kept it up with
a view of gaining time. Naturally keen-witted and trained in the
subtlety of the dusky men of the plains, he sought to do more
than dispute over the conditions of a proposed bargain. While
thus employed, he used his senses to their fullest extent. Without
seeming to do so, he was scrutinizing the hills just beyond the
couple, on the ground in front of him. He sought to learn whether
any of their warriors were at hand. They might have been, without
his knowledge, but the fact that he saw no sign of them led him
to believe they were not within immediate call.</p>

<p>Had he been confronted by a single warrior instead of a couple,
the Texan would have attempted an exploit in which there was hardly
one chance in a hundred of succeeding. It was to seize the warrior,
make off with him, and then hold him as a hostage for the safety
of Captain Shirril.</p>

<p>True, this was a violation of the flag of truce, but under the
circumstances it would not have been one-tenth as flagrant as
that by which our government captured the famous Seminole chieftain
Osceola, and held him prisoner until his death; but with two doughty
warriors to combat, it would seem that nothing could be more foolhardy
than any such effort on the part of the Texan.</p>

<p>And yet Gleeson seriously asked himself whether it was not possible
to shoot one, and leaping upon the other, overcome and carry him
off before his friends could interfere. In referring to it afterward
he admitted its absurdity, and yet he would have made the attempt
but for a trifling discovery when almost in the act of taking
the decisive step.</p>
