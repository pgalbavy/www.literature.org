<p>Arthur did not delay his departure from Madeira. The morning following
Mildred's ball he embarked on board a Portuguese boat, a very dirty
craft which smelt of garlic and rancid oil, and sailed for Lisbon. He
arrived there safely, and mooned about that city for a while, himself
a monument of serious reflections, and then struck across into Spain,
where he spent a month or so inspecting the historical beauties of
that fallen country. Thence he penetrated across the Pyrenees into
Southern France, which was pleasant in the spring months. Here he
remained another month, meeting with no adventures worthy of any note,
and improving his knowledge of the French language. Tiring at last of
this, he travelled to Paris, and went to the theatres, but found his
own thoughts too absorbing to allow of his taking any keen interest in
their sensationalisms; so, after a brief stay, he made his way up to
Brittany and Normandy, and went in for inspecting old castles and
cathedrals, and finally ended up his continental travels by spending a
week on the island rock of Saint Michel.
</p>
<p>This place pleased him more than any he had visited. He liked to
wander about among the massive granite pillars of that noble
ecclesiastical fortress, and at night to watch the phosphoric tide
come rushing in with all the speed of a race-horse, over the wide
sands, which separate it from the mainland. There the thirty-first day
of May found him, and he bethought him that it was time to return to
London and see about getting the settlements drawn and ordering the
wedding bouquet. To speak the truth, he thought more about the bouquet
than the settlements.
</p><p>He arrived in London on the first of June, and went to see his family
lawyer, a certain Mr. Borley, who had been solicitor to the trust
during his minority.
</p><p>"Bless me, Heigham, how like your father you have grown!" said that
legal gentleman, as soon as Arthur was ensconced in the client's chair
--a chair that, had it been endowed with the gift of speech, could
have told some surprising stories. "It seems only the other day that
he was sitting there dictating the terms of his will, and yet that was
before the Crimean war, more than twenty years ago. Well, my boy, what
is it?"
</p><p>Arthur, thus encouraged, entered into a rather blundering recital of
the circumstances of his engagement.
</p><p>Mr. Borley did not say much, but, from his manner and occasional
comments, it was evident that he considered the whole story very odd--
regarding it, indeed, with some suspicion.
</p><p>"I must tell you frankly, Mr. Heigham," he said, at last, "I don't
quite understand this business. The young lady, no doubt, is charming
--young ladies, looking at them from my clients' point of view, always
are--but I can't say I like your story about her father. Why did you
not tell me all this before? I might then have been able to give you
some advice worth having, or, at any rate, to make a few confidential"
--he laid great emphasis on the word "confidential"--"inquiries."
</p><p>Arthur replied that it had not occurred to him to do so.
</p><p>"Umph, pity--great pity; but there is no time for that sort of thing
now, if you think you are going to get married on the tenth; so I
suppose the only thing to do is to go through with it and await the
upshot. What do you wish done?"
</p><p>Arthur explained his views, which apparently included settling all his
property on his bride in the most absolute fashion possible. To this
Mr. Borley forcibly objected, and in the end Arthur had to give way
and make such arrangements as the old gentleman thought proper--
arrangements differing considerably from those proposed by himself.
</p><p>This interview over, he had other and pleasanter duties to perform,
such as ordering his wedding clothes, making arrangements with a
florist for the bridal bouquet, and last, but not least, having his
mother's diamonds re-set as a present for his bride.
</p><p>But still the days went very slowly, there seemed to be no end to
them. He had no relations to go and see, and in his present anxious
excited state he preferred to avoid his friends and club
acquaintances. Fifth, sixth, seventh; never did a schoolboy await the
coming of the day that marked the advent of his holidays with such
intense anxiety.
</p><p>At length the eighth of June arrived. Months before, he had settled
what his programme should be on that day. His promise, as the reader
may remember, forbade him to see Angela till the ninth, that is, at
any hour after twelve on the night of the eighth, or, practically, as
early as possible on the following morning. Now the earliest train
would not get him down to Roxham till eleven o'clock, which would
involve a wicked waste of four or five hours of daylight that might be
spent with Angela, so he wisely resolved to start on the evening of
the eighth, by a train leaving Paddington at six o'clock, and reaching
Roxham at nine.
</p><p>The day he spent in signing the settlements, finally interviewing the
florist, and giving him directions as to forwarding the weddingbouquet, 
which was to be composed of orange-blossoms, lilies of the
valley, and stephanois, and in getting the marriage-license. But,
notwithstanding these manifold employments, he managed to be threequarters 
of an hour before his train, the longest forty-five minutes
he ever spent.
</p><p>He had written to the proprietor of the inn at Rewtham, where he had
slept a year ago the night after he had left Isleworth, to send a gig
to meet him at the station, and, on arriving at Roxham, a porter told
him that a trap was waiting for him. On emerging from the station,
even in the darkness, he was able to recognize the outlines of the
identical vehicle which had conveyed him to the Abbey House some
thirteen months ago, whilst the sound of an ancient, quavering voice
informed him that the Jehu was likewise the same. His luggage was soon
bundled up behind, and the steady-going old nag departed into the
darkness.
</p><p>"Well, Sam, do you remember me?"
</p><p>"Well, no, sir, I can't rightly say how I do: wait a bit; bean't you
the gemman as travels in the dry line, and as I seed a-kissing the
chambermaid?"
</p><p>"No, I don't travel at present, and I have not kissed a chambermaid
for some time. Do you remember driving a gentleman over to the Abbey
House a year or so ago?"
</p><p>"Why, yes, in course I does. Lord, now, and be you he? and we seed old
Devil's Caresfoot's granddaughter. Ah! many's the time that he has
damned me, and all so soft and pleasant like; but it was his eyes that
did the trick. They was awful, just awful; and you gave me half-acrown, 
you did. But somehow I thought I heard summat about you, sir,
but I can't rightly remember what it be, my head not being so good as
it used to."
</p><p>"Perhaps you heard what I was going to be married?"
</p><p>"No. I don't think how as it was that neither."
</p><p>"Well, never mind me; have you seen Miss Caresfoot--the young lady you
saw the day you drove me to the Abbey House--anywhere about lately?"
</p><p>Arthur waited for the old man's lingering answer with all his heart
upon his lips.
</p><p>"Lor', yes, sir, that I have; I saw her this morning driving through
the Roxham market-place."
</p><p>"And how did she look?"
</p><p>"A bit pale, I thought, sir; but well enough, and wonnerful handsome."
</p><p>Arthur gave a sigh of relief. He felt like a man who has just come
scatheless through some horrible crisis, and once more knows the sweet
sensation of safety. What a load the old man's words had lifted from
his mind? In his active imagination he had pictured all sorts of evils
which might have happened to Angela during his year of absence. Lovers
are always prone to such imaginings, and not altogether without
reason, for there would seem to be a special power of evil that
devotes itself to the derangement of their affairs, and the ingenious
disappointment of their hopes. But now the vague dread was gone,
Angela was not spirited away or dead, and to know her alive was to
know her faithful.
</p><p>As they drove along, the old ostler continued to volunteer various
scraps of information which fell upon his ears unheeded, till
presently his attention was caught by the name Caresfoot.
</p><p>"What about him?" he asked, quickly.
</p><p>"He be a-dying, they do say."
</p><p>"Which of them?"
</p><p>"Why, the red-haired one, him as lives up at the Hall yonder."
</p><p>"Poor fellow," said Arthur, feeling quite fond of George in his
happiness.
</p><p>They had by this time reached the inn, where he had some supper, for
old Sam's good news had brought back his appetite, which of late had
not been quite up to par, and then went straight to his room that
faced towards the Abbey House. It was, he noticed, the same in which
he had slept the year before, and looking at the bed he remembered his
dream, and smiled as he thought that the wood was passed, and before
him lay nothing but the flowery meadows. Mildred Carr, too, crossed
his mind, but of her he did not think much, not that he was by any
means heartless--indeed, what had happened had pained him acutely, the
more so because his own conscience told him he had been a fool. He was
very sorry, but, love being here below one of the most selfish of the
passions, he had not time to be sorry just then.
</p><p>For just on the horizon he could distinguish a dense mass which was
the trees surrounding the Abbey House, and between the trees there
glimmered a faint light which might proceed from some rising star, or
from Angela's window. He preferred to believe it was the latter. The
propinquity made him very happy. What was she doing? he wondered--
sitting by her window and thinking of him! He would ask her on the
morrow. It was worth while going through that year of separation in
order to taste the joy of meeting. It seemed like a dream to think
that within six-and-thirty hours he would probably be Angela's
husband, and how nobody in the world would be able to take her away
from him. He stretched out his arms towards her.
</p><p>"My darling, my darling," he cried aloud into the still night. "My
darling, my darling," the echo answered sadly.
