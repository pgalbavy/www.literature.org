<p>Megaphones were constructed out of heavy wrapping-paper, and
Penrod, Sam, and Herman set out in different directions, delivering
vocally the inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large
section of the residential quarter, and leaving Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, with Verman in the loft, shielded from all deadhead
eyes. Upon the return of the heralds, the Schofield and Williams
Military Band played deafeningly, and an awakened public once
more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm.</p>

<p>Prosperity smiled again. The very first audience after the acquisition
of Roderick was larger than the largest of the morning. Master
Bitts&mdash;the only exhibit placed upon a box&mdash;was a supercurio. All
eyes fastened upon him and remained, hungrily feasting, throughout
Penrod's luminous oration.</p>

<p>But the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another.
We dwell in a vale of seesaws&mdash;and cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel.
Verman, the tattooed wild boy, speaking only in his native foreign
languages, Verman the gay, Verman the caperer, capered no more;
he chuckled no more, he beckoned no more, nor tapped his chest,
nor wreathed his idolatrous face in smiles. Gone, all gone, were
his little artifices for attracting the general attention to himself;
gone was every engaging mannerism which had endeared him to the
mercurial public. He squatted against the wall and glowered at
the new sensation. It was the old story&mdash;the old, old story of
too much temperament: Verman was suffering from artistic jealousy.</p>

<p>The second audience contained a cash-paying adult, a spectacled
young man whose poignant attention was very flattering. He remained
after the lecture, and put a few questions to Roddy, which were
answered rather confusedly upon promptings from Penrod. The young
man went away without having stated the object of his interrogations,
but it became quite plain, later in the day. This same object
caused the spectacled young man to make several brief but stimulating
calls directly after leaving the Schofield and Williams Big Show,
and the consequences thereof loitered not by the wayside.</p>

<p>The Big Show was at high tide. Not only was the auditorium filled
and throbbing; there was an indubitable line&mdash;by no means wholly
juvenile&mdash;waiting for admission to the next pufformance. A group
stood in the street examining the poster earnestly as it glowed
in the long, slanting rays of the westward sun, and people in
automobiles and other vehicles had halted wheel in the street
to read the message so piquantly given to the world. These were
the conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop, and
a large, chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended,
and progressed across the yard with an air of violence.</p>

<p>At sight of her, the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared,
and most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way.
She was followed by a stricken man in livery.</p>

<p>The stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep; Mrs. Roderick
Magsworth Bitts was of a stout favour; and the voice of Penrod
was audible during the ascent.</p>

<p>"<em>RE-MEM-BUR, </em>gentilmun and lay-deeze, each and all are
now gazing upon Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, the only living
nephew of the great Rena Magsworth. She stuck ars'nic in the milk
of eight separate and distinck people to put in their coffee and
each and all of 'em died. The great ars'nic murderess, Rena Magsworth,
gentilmun and lay-deeze, and Roddy's her only living nephew. She's
a relation of all the Bitts family, but he's her one and only
living nephew. <em>RE-MEM-BUR! </em>Next July she's goin' to be
hung, and, each and all, you now see before you&#11834;"</p>

<p>Penrod paused abruptly, seeing something before himself&mdash;the
august and awful presence which filled the entryway. And his words
(it should be related) froze upon his lips.</p>

<p>Before <em>HERSELF, </em>Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts saw her
son&mdash;her scion&mdash;wearing a moustache and sideburns of blue, and
perched upon a box flanked by Sherman and Verman, the Michigan
rats, the Indian dog Duke, Herman, and the dog part alligator.</p>

<p>Roddy, also, saw something before himself. It needed no prophet
to read the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway.
His mouth opened&mdash;remained open&mdash;then filled to capacity with
a calamitous sound of grief not unmingled with apprehension.</p>

<p>Penrod's reason staggered under the crisis. For a horrible moment
he saw Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts approaching like some fatal
mountain in avalanche. She seemed to grow larger and redder; lightnings
played about her head; he had a vague consciousness of the audience
spraying out in flight, of the squealings, tramplings and dispersals
of a stricken field. The mountain was close upon him&#11834;</p>

<p>He stood by the open mouth of the hay-chute which went through
the floor to the manger below. Penrod also went through the floor.
He propelled himself into the chute and shot down, but not quite
to the manger, for Mr. Samuel Williams had thoughtfully stepped
into the chute a moment in advance of his partner. Penrod lit
upon Sam.</p>

<p>Catastrophic noises resounded in the loft; volcanoes seemed to
romp upon the stairway.</p>

<p>There ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing
of Roderick as he was borne to the tumbril. Then all was silence.</p>

<p>. . . Sunset, striking through a western window, rouged the walls
of the Schofields' library, where gathered a joint family council
and court martial of four &mdash;Mrs. Schofield, Mr. Schofield,
and Mr. and Mrs. Williams, parents of Samuel of that ilk. Mr.
Williams read aloud a conspicuous passage from the last edition
of the evening paper:</p>

<p>"Prominent people here believed close relations of woman sentenced
to hang. Angry denial by Mrs. R. Magsworth Bitts. Relationship
admitted by younger member of family. His statement confirmed
by boy-friends&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Mrs. Williams, addressing her husband vehemently.
"We've all read it a dozen times. We've got plenty of trouble
on our hands without hearing <em>THAT </em>again!"</p>

<p>Singularly enough, Mrs. Williams did not look troubled; she looked
as if she were trying to look troubled. Mrs. Schofield wore a
similar expression. So did Mr. Schofield. So did Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>"What did she say when she called <em>YOU </em>up?" Mrs. Schofield
inquired breathlessly of Mrs. Williams.</p>

<p>"She could hardly speak at first, and then when she did talk,
she talked so fast I couldn't understand most of it, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It was just the same when she tried to talk to me," said Mrs.
Schofield, nodding.</p>

<p>"I never did hear any one in such a state before," continued
Mrs. Williams. "So furious&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Quite justly, of course," said Mrs. Schofield.</p>

<p>"Of course. And she said Penrod and Sam had enticed Roderick
away from home&mdash;usually he's not allowed to go outside the yard
except with his tutor or a servant&mdash;and had told him to say that
horrible creature was his aunt&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How in the world do you suppose Sam and Penrod ever thought
of such a thing as <em>THAT!" </em>exclaimed Mrs. Schofield. "It
must have been made up just for their 'show.' Della says there
were just <em>STREAMS </em>going in and out all day. Of course
it wouldn't have happened, but this was the day Margaret and I
spend every month in the country with Aunt Sarah, and I didn't
<em>DREAM</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"She said one thing I thought rather tactless," interrupted Mrs.
Williams. "Of course we must allow for her being dreadfully excited
and wrought up, but I do think it wasn't quite delicate in her,
and she's usually the very soul of delicacy. She said that Roderick
had <em>NEVER </em>been allowed to associate with&mdash;common boys&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Meaning Sam and Penrod," said Mrs. Schofield. "Yes, she said
that to me, too."</p>

<p>"She said that the most awful thing about it," Mrs. Williams
went on, "was that, though she's going to prosecute the newspapers,
many people would always believe the story, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I imagine they will," said Mrs. Schofield musingly. "Of
course you and I and everybody who really knows the Bitts and
Magsworth families understand the perfect absurdity of it; but
I suppose there are ever so many who'll believe it, no matter
what the Bittses and Magsworths say."</p>

<p>"Hundreds and hundreds!" said Mrs. Williams. "I'm afraid it will
be a great come-down for them."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," said Mrs. Schofield gently. "A very great one&mdash;yes,
a very, very great one."</p>

<p>"Well," observed Mrs. Williams, after a thoughtful pause, "there's
only one thing to be done, and I suppose it had better be done
right away."</p>

<p>She glanced toward the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mr. Schofield agreed. "But where <em>ARE </em>they?"</p>

<p>"Have you looked in the stable?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"I searched it. They've probably started for the far West."</p>

<p>"Did you look in the sawdust-box?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"Then that's where they are."</p>

<p>Thus, in the early twilight, the now historic stable was approached
by two fathers charged to do the only thing to be done. They entered
the storeroom.</p>

<p>"Penrod!" said Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>"Sam!" said Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbed the twilight hush.</p>

<p>But by means of a ladder, brought from the carriage-house, Mr.
Schofield mounted to the top of the sawdust-box. He looked within,
and discerned the dim outlines of three quiet figures, the third
being that of a small dog.</p>

<p>The two boys rose, upon command, descended the ladder after Mr.
Schofield, bringing Duke with them, and stood before the authors
of their being, who bent upon them sinister and threatening brows.
With hanging heads and despondent countenances, each still ornamented
with a moustache and an imperial, Penrod and Sam awaited sentence.</p>

<p>This is a boy's lot: anything he does, anything whatever, may
afterward turn out to have been a crime&mdash;he never knows.</p>

<p>And punishment and clemency are alike inexplicable.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams took his son by the ear.</p>

<p>"You march home!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Sam marched, not looking back, and his father followed the small
figure implacably.</p>

<p>"You goin' to whip me?" quavered Penrod, alone with Justice.</p>

<p>"Wash your face at that hydrant," said his father sternly.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes later, Penrod, hurriedly entering the corner
drug store, two blocks distant, was astonished to perceive a familiar
form at the soda counter.</p>

<p>"Yay, Penrod," said Sam Williams. "Want some sody? Come on. He
didn't lick me. He didn't do anything to me at all. He gave me
a quarter."</p>

<p>"So'd mine," said Penrod.</p>
