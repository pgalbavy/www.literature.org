<p>He fell asleep beside her, after a long spell of waking during which
his uneasiness was gradually assuaged by the soft and regular rhythm
which marked the young girl's breathing.
</p><p>When he woke, fairly late in the morning, Dolores was stooping and
bathing her beautiful arms and her face in the stream that flowed down
the hillside. She moved slowly; and all her attitude, as she dried her
arms and put back her hair, knotting it low on her neck, were full of
a grave harmony.
</p><p>As Simon stood up, she filled a glass and brought it to him:
</p><p>"Drink that," she said. "Contrary to what I thought, it's fresh water.
I heard our horses drinking it in the night."
</p><p>"That's easily explained," said Simon. "During the first few days, the
rivers of the old coasts filtered in more or less anywhere, until
forced, by their increasing flow, to wear themselves a new course.
Judging by the direction which this one seems to follow and by its
size, it should be a French river, doubtless the Somme, which will
join the sea henceforth between Le Havre and Southampton. Unless.
. . ."
</p><p>He was not certain of his argument. In reality, under the implacable
veil of the clouds, which were still motionless and hanging very low,
and without his compass, which he had heedlessly handed to Antonio, he
did not know how to take his bearings. He had followed in Isabel's
track last evening; and he hesitated to venture in either direction
now that this track was lost and that there was no clue to justify his
seeking her in one direction rather than in another.
</p><p>A discovery of Dolores put an end to his hesitation. In exploring the
immediate surroundings, the girl had noticed a submarine cable which
crossed the river.
</p><p>"Capital!" he said. "The cable evidently comes from England, like
ourselves. If we follow it, we shall be going towards France. We shall
be sure of going the same way as our enemies and we shall very likely
pick up some information on the road."
</p><p>"France is a long way off," Dolores remarked, "and our horses perhaps
won't last for more than another half day."
</p><p>"That's their lookout," cried Simon. "We shall finish the journey on
foot. The great thing is to reach the French coast. Let us make a
start."
</p><p>At two hundred yards' distance, in a depression of the soil, the cable
rose from the river and ran straight to a sand-bank, after which it
appeared once more, like one of those roads which show in sections on
uneven plains.
</p><p>"It will lead you to Dieppe," said a wandering Frenchman, whom Simon
had stopped. "I've just come from there. You've only to follow it."
</p><p>They followed it in silence. A mute companion, speaking none save
indispensable words, Dolores seemed to be always self-absorbed, or to
heed only the horses and the details of the expedition. As for Simon,
he gave no thought to her. It was a curious fact that he had not yet
felt, even casually, that there was something strange and disturbing
in the adventure that brought him, a young man, and her, a young
woman, together. She remained the unknown; yet this mystery had no
particular attraction for him, nor did Antonio's enigmatic words recur
to his memory. Though he was perfectly well aware that she was very
beautiful, though it gave him pleasure to look at her from time to
time and though he often felt her eyes resting on him, she was never
the subject of his thoughts and did not for a moment enter into the
unbroken reflections aroused by his love for Isabel Bakefield and the
dangers which she was incurring.
</p><p>These dangers he now judged to be less terrible than he had supposed.
Since Rolleston's plan consisted in sending Lord Bakefield to a Paris
banker to obtain money, it might be assumed that Isabel, held as a
hostage, would be treated with a certain consideration, at least until
Rolleston, after receiving a ransom, made further demands. But, when
this happened, would not he, Simon, be there?
</p><p>They were now entering a region of a wholly different character, where
there was no longer either sand or mud, but a floor of grey rock
streaked with thin sheets of hard, sharp-edged stone, which refused to
take the imprint of a trail and which even the iron of the horses'
shoes failed to mark. Their only chance of information was from the
prowlers whom they might encounter.
</p><p>These were becoming more and more numerous. Two full days had elapsed
since the emergence of the new land. It was now the third day; and
from all parts, from every point of the sea-side counties or
departments, came hastening all who did not fear the risk of the
undertaking: vagabonds, tramps, poachers, reckless spirits, daredevils
of all kinds. The ruined towns poured forth their contingent of
poverty-striken, starving outcasts and escaped prisoners. Armed with
rifles and swords, with clubs or scythes, all these brigands wore an
air that was both defiant and threatening. They watched one another
warily, each of them gauging at a glance his neighbour's strength,
ready to spring upon him or ready to act in self-defence.
</p><p>Simon's questions hardly evoked as much as a grumbling reply:
</p><p>"A woman tied up? A party? Horses? Not come my way."
</p><p>And they went on. But, two hours later, Simon was greatly surprised to
see the motley dress of three men walking some distance ahead, their
shoulders laden with bundles which each of them carried slung on the
end of a stick. Weren't those Antonio's Indians?
</p><p>"Yes," murmured Dolores. "It's Forsetta and the Mazzani brothers."
But, when Simon proposed to go after them, "No!" she said, without
concealing her repugnance. "They're a bad lot. There's nothing to be
gained by joining them."
</p><p>But he was not listening; and, as soon as they were within hearing, he
shouted:
</p><p>"Is Antonio anywhere about?"
</p><p>The three men set down their bundles, while Simon and Dolores
dismounted and Forsetta, who had a revolver in his hand, thrust it
into his pocket. He was a great giant of a fellow.
</p><p>"Ah, so it's you, Dolores?" he said, after saluting Simon. "Faith, no,
Antonio's nowhere hereabouts. We've not seen him."
</p><p>He smiled with a wry mouth and treacherous eyes.
</p><p>"That means," retorted Simon, pointing to their burdens, "that you and
Mazzani thought it simpler to go hunting in this direction?"
</p><p>"May be," he said, with a leer.
</p><p>"But the old professor? Antonio left him in your charge."
</p><p>"We lost sight of him soon after the <u>Queen Mary</u>. He was looking for
shells. So Mazzani and I came on."
</p><p>Simon was losing patience. Dolores interrupted him:
</p><p>"Forsetta," she said gravely. "Antonio was your chief. We four were
fellow-workers; and he asked if you would come with him and me to
avenge my uncle's death. You had no right to desert Antonio."
</p><p>The Indians looked at one another and laughed. It was obvious that
notions of right and wrong, promises, obligations, duties of
friendship, established rules, decent behaviour, all these had
suddenly became things which they had ceased to understand. In the
stupendous chaos of events, in the heart of this virgin soil, nothing
mattered but the satisfaction of the appetites. It was a new
situation, which they were unable to analyse, though they hastened to
profit by its results without so much as discussing them.
</p><p>The brothers Mazzani lifted their bundles to their shoulders. Forsetta
went up to Dolores and stared at her for a moment without speaking,
with eyes that glittered between his half-closed lids. His face
betrayed at the same time hesitation and a brutal desire, which he
made no attempt to conceal, to seize the girl as his prey.
</p><p>But he restrained himself and, picking up his bag, moved off with his
companions.
</p><p>Simon had watched the scene in silence. His eyes met Dolores'. She
coloured slightly and said, in a low voice:
</p><p>"Forsetta used to know how to keep his distance. . . . The air of the
prairie, as you say, has acted on him as it has on the others."
</p><p>Around them, a bed of dried wrack and other sea-weeds, beneath which
the cable disappeared for a length of several miles, formed a series
of hills and valleys. Dolores decided that they would halt there and
led the horses a little way off, so that they should not disturb
Simon's rest.
</p><p>As it happened, Simon, having lain down on the ground and fallen
asleep, was attacked, knocked helpless, gagged and bound before he was
able to offer the least resistance to his assailants. These were the
three Indians, who had returned at a run.
</p><p>Forsetta took possession of Simon's pocket-book and watch, tested the
firmness of his bonds and then, flat on his stomach, with one of the
Mazzanis on either side, crawled under the wrack and seaweed towards
the spot where the girl was tending the horses.
</p><p>Simon repeatedly saw their supple bodies wriggling like reptiles.
Dolores, who was busied over the saddle-bags, had her back to them. No
feeling of uneasiness warned her of her danger. In vain Simon strove
against his bonds and uttered shouts which were stifled by his gag. No
power could prevent the Indians from attaining their aim.
</p><p>The younger Mazzani was the swifter of the two. He suddenly sprung
upon Dolores and threw her down, while his brother leapt upon one of
the horses and Forsetta, holding another by the bridle, gave his
orders in a hoarse tone of triumph:
</p><p>"Lift her. Take away her rifle. . . . Good! Bring her here. . . .
We'll tie her on."
</p><p>Dolores was placed across the saddle. But, just as Forsetta was
uncoiling a rope which he carried round his waist, she raised herself
upon the horse's neck, towering over young Mazzani and, raising her
arm, struck him full in the chest with her dagger. The Indian fell
like a stone against Forsetta; and, when the latter had released
himself and made as though to continue the struggle on his own
account, Dolores was already before him, threatening him point-blank
with her rifle, which she had recovered:
</p><p>"Clear out," she said. "You too, Mazzani, clear out."
</p><p>Mazzani obeyed and flew off at a gallop. Forsetta, his features
convulsed with rage, withdrew with deliberate steps, leading the
second horse. Dolores called to him:
</p><p>"Leave that horse, Forsetta! This moment . . . or I fire!"
</p><p>He dropped the bridle and then, twenty paces farther on, suddenly
turned his back and fled as fast as he could run.
</p><p>Simon was impressed not so much by the incident itself--a mere episode
in the great tragedy--as by the extraordinary coolness which the girl
had displayed. When she came to release him, her hands were cold as
ice and her lips quivering:
</p><p>"He's dead," she faltered. "The young Mazzani is dead. . . ."
</p><p>"You had to defend yourself," said Simon.
</p><p>"Yes . . . yes . . . but to take a man's life . . . how horrible! I
struck instinctively . . . as though I were acting for the films: you
see, we rehearsed this scene a hundred times and more, the four of us,
the Mazzanis, Forsetta and I, in the same way, with the words and
gestures in the same order. . . . Even to the stab! It was young
Mazzani himself who taught me that; and he often used to say: 'Bravo,
Dolores! If ever you play the kidnapping-scene in real life, I'm sorry
for your adversary!'"
</p><p>"Let's hurry," said Simon. "Mazzani may try to avenge his brother's
death; and a man like Forsetta doesn't easily give up. . . ."
</p><p>They continued on their way and once more came upon the cable. Simon
went on foot, abreast of Dolores. By turning his head a little, he
could see her sad face, with its crown of black hair. She had lost her
broad-brimmed hat, as well as her bolero, which was strapped to the
saddle of the horse stolen by Mazzani. A silk shirt revealed the
modelling of her breasts. Her rifle was slung across her shoulders.
</p><p>Once more the region of streaked stone extended to the horizon, dotted
with wrecks as before and crossed by the wandering shapes of looters.
Clouds hung overhead. From time to time there was the humming of an
aeroplane.
</p><p>At noon Simon calculated that they had still twelve or fifteen miles
to cover and that therefore they might be able to reach Dieppe before
night. Dolores, who had dismounted and, like him, was walking,
declared:
</p><p>"We, yes, we shall get there. But not the horse. He will drop before
that."
</p><p>"No matter!" said Simon. "The great thing is for us to get there."
</p><p>The rocky ground was now interspersed with tracts of sand where
footprints were once more visible; and among other trails were those
of two horses coming in their direction along the line of the cable.
</p><p>"Yet we passed no one on horseback," said Simon. "What do you make of
it?"
</p><p>She did not reply: but a little later, as they reached the top of a
slope, she showed him a broad river mingling with the horizon and
barring their progress. When they were nearer, they saw that it was
flowing from their right to their left; and, when they were nearer
still, it reminded them of the stream which they had left that
morning. The colour, the banks, the windings were the same. Simon,
disconcerted, examined the country around to discover something that
was different; but the landscape was identical, as a whole and in
every detail.
</p><p>"What does this mean?" muttered Simon. "There must be an inexplicable
mirage . . . for, after all, it is impossible to admit that we can
have made a mistake."
</p><p>But proofs of the blunder committed were becoming more numerous. The
track of the two horses having led them away from the cable, they went
down to the river-bank and there, on a flat space bearing the traces
of an encampment, they were compelled to recognize the spot where they
had passed the previous night!
</p><p>Thus, in a disastrous fit of distraction due to the attack by the
Indians and the death of the younger Mazzani, both of them, in their
excitement, had lost their bearings, and, trusting to the only
indication which they had discovered, had gone back to the submarine
cable. Then, when they resumed their journey, there had been nothing,
no landmark of any kind, to reveal the fact that they were following
the cable in the reverse direction, that they were retracing the path
already travelled and that they were returning, after an exhausting
and fruitless effort, to the spot which they had left some hours ago!
</p><p>Simon yielded to a momentary fit of despondency. That which was only a
vexatious delay assumed in his eyes the importance of an irreparable
event. The upheaval of the 4th of June had caused this corner of the
world to relapse into absolute barbarism; and to struggle against the
obstacles which it presented called for qualities which he did not
possess. While the marauders and outcasts felt at home from the
beginning in this new state of things, he, Simon Dubosc, was vainly
seeking for the solution of the problems propounded by the exceptional
circumstances. Where was he to go? What was he to do? Against whom was
he to defend himself? How was he to rescue Isabel?
</p><p>As completely lost in the new land as he would have been in the
immensity of the sea, he ascended the course of the river, following,
with a distraught gaze, the trace of the two trails marking the sand,
which was wet in places. He recognized the prints left by Dolores'
sandals.
</p><p>"It's no use going in that direction," she said. "I explored all the
surrounding country this morning."
</p><p>He went on, however, against the girl's wishes and with no other
object than that of acting and moving. And, so doing, in some fifteen
minutes' time he came upon a spot where the bank was trampled and
muddy, like the banks of a river at a ford.
</p><p>He stopped suddenly. Horses had passed that way. The mark of their
shoes was plainly visible.
</p><p>"Oh!" he cried, in bewilderment. "Here is Rolleston's trail! . . .
This is the distinct pattern of his rubber soles! Can I believe my
eyes?"
</p><p>Almost immediately his quest assumed a more definite form. Fifty yards
higher were the traces, still plainly marked, of a camp; and Simon
declared:
</p><p>"Of course! . . . Of course! . . . It was here that they landed last
night! Like us, they must have fled before the sudden rise of the
water; and like us, they camped on the further side of a hill. Oh," he
continued, despairingly, "we were less than a mile from them! We could
have surprised them in their sleep! Isn't it frightful to think that
nothing told us of it . . . and that such an opportunity. . . ."
</p><p>He squatted on his heels and, bending over the ground, examined it for
some minutes. Then he rose, his eyes met those of Dolores and he
said, in a low voice:
</p><p>"There is one extraordinary thing. . . . How do you explain it?"
</p><p>The girl's tanned face turned crimson; and he saw that she guessed
what he was about to say:
</p><p>"You came here this morning, Dolores, while I was asleep. Several
times your footsteps cover those of our enemies, which proves that you
came after they were gone. Why didn't you tell me?"
</p><p>She was silent, with her eyes still fixed upon Simon's and her grave
face animated by an expression of mingled defiance and fear. Suddenly
Simon seized her hand:
</p><p>"But then . . . but then you knew the truth! Ever since this morning,
you have known that they went along the river-bank. . . . Look . . .
over there . . . you can see their tracks leading eastward. . . . And
you never told me! Worse than that. . . . Why, yes . . . it was you
who called my attention to the cable. . . . It was you who set me
going in a southerly direction . . . towards France. . . . And it is
through you that we have lost nearly a whole day!"
</p><p>Standing close up to her, with his eyes plumbing hers, holding her
fingers in his, he resumed:
</p><p>"Why did you do that? It was an unspeakable piece of treachery. . . .
Tell me, why? You know that I love Miss Bakefield, that she is in the
most terrible danger and that to her one day lost may mean dishonour
. . . and death. . . . Then why did you do it?"
</p><p>He said no more. He felt that, in spite of her appearance, which was
impassive as usual, the girl was overcome with emotion and that he was
dominating her with all the power of his manhood. Dolores' knees were
giving way beneath her. There was nothing in her now but
submissiveness and gentleness; and, since, in their exceptional
position, no reserve could restrain her confession or check her
impulsiveness, she whispered:
</p><p>"Forgive me. . . . I wasn't thinking . . . or rather I thought of no
one but you . . . you and myself. . . . Yes, from the first moment of
our meeting, the other day, I was swept off my feet by a feeling
stronger than anything in this world. . . . I don't know why. . . . It
was your way of doing things . . . your delicacy, when you threw your
coat over my shoulders. . . . I'm not used to being treated like that.
. . . You seemed to me different from the others. . . . That night,
at the Casino, your triumph intoxicated me. . . . And since then my
whole life has been centred on you. . . . I have never felt like this
before. . . . Men . . . men are brutal to me . . . violent . . .
terrible. . . . They run after me like brutes . . . I loathe them.
. . . You . . . you . . . you're different. . . . With you I feel a
slave. . . . I want to please you. . . . Your every movement delights
me. . . . With you I am happier than I've ever been in my life. . . ."
</p><p>She stood drooping before him, with lowered head. Simon was bewildered
at the expression of this spontaneous love, which to him was so
completely unforeseen, which was at once so humble and so passionate.
It wounded him in his love for Isabel, as though he had committed an
offence in listening to the girl's avowal. Yet she spoke so gently;
and it was so strange to see this proud and beautiful creature bowing
before him with such reverence that he could not but experience a
certain emotion.
</p><p>"I love another woman," he repeated, to set up definitely the obstacle
of this love, "and nothing can come between us."
</p><p>"Yes," she said. "Nevertheless I hoped . . . I don't know what. . . .
I had no object in view. . . . I only wanted us to be alone together,
just the two of us, as long as possible. It's over now. I swear it.
. . . We shall find Miss Bakefield. . . . Let me take you to her: I
think I shall be better able than you. . . ."
</p><p>Was she sincere? How could he reconcile this offer of devotion with
the passion to which she had confessed?
</p><p>"What proof have you?" asked Simon.
</p><p>"What proof of my loyalty? The absolute acknowledgement of the wrong
which I have done and which I wish to repair. This morning, when I
came here alone, I looked all over the ground to see if there was
anything that might give us a clue and I ended by discovering on the
edge of this rock a scrap of paper with some writing on it. . . ."
</p><p>"Have you it?" cried Simon, sharply. "Has she written? Miss Bakefield,
I mean?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"It's for me, of course?" continued Simon, with increasing excitement.
</p><p>"It's not addressed. But of course it was written for you just as
yesterday's message was. Here it is. . . ."
</p><p>She held out a piece of paper, moist and crumpled, on which he read
the following words, hastily scribbled in Isabel's hand:
</p><pre>
      "No longer making for Dieppe. They have heard a rumour
      of a fountain of gold . . . a real, gushing spring, it
      seems. We are going in that direction. No immediate
      cause for anxiety."</pre>
<p>And Dolores added:
</p><p>"They left before daybreak, going up the river. If this river is
really the Somme, we must suppose that they have crossed it somewhere,
which will have delayed them. So we shall find them, Simon."
