<p>Nothing is impossible to pluck and perseverance. That boy who
is determined to become brilliant in his studies, no matter what
their nature, or to master a difficult profession, or to attain
any point possible of attainment, is sure to win, if he will but
<em>stick to it</em>.</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam was resolved to become skillful with the rifle, and
he gave all the time he could spare to practice with the gun which
belonged to Mr. Marston. He was desirous of starting after the
bear with Sam, as soon as he could use the gun, but his sensible
father shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Nicholas, that would be doing wrong, for you do not know
how to handle the rifle; God does not step in and help the lazy
and careless; first learn how to use the weapon, so you will never
miss; then you may go hunt bears."</p>

<p>Although a lusty lad, Nick found the heavy gun was quite a burden,
and he preferred to rest the barrel on the fence, or in the crotch
of a tree, when aiming, but Sam Harper told him he could never
amount to anything unless he used his weapon off-hand, and was
ready to do so effectively, no matter how sudden the call.</p>

<p>Nick applied all his energies, and in the course of a few weeks
won the praise of Sam, who had become very fond of the bright
and good-natured "Pennsylvania Dutchman," who, in return, helped
him in his efforts to improve his knowledge in arithmetic, which
he studied in a desultory way on the long autumn evenings, having
promised his father to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Marston owned a dog which was not of much account, but the
boys trained him with rare patience, and were confident he would
prove valuable when they took him on the hunt.</p>

<p>By the time they were ready to start autumn was advanced, and
Nick, who had carefully studied up the peculiarities of the animal,
said he was afraid the bear had gone into some hollow tree or
cave to take his winter's sleep.</p>

<p>"I don't think they do that till the weather gets colder," said
Sam, who had once helped hunt bruin in the wilds of Tennessee,
"and even in very cold weather I have seen their tracks in the
snow; but if we can only find the tree or cave where he is hiding,
why, that will just be splendid."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"He is fat, lazy, and so sleepy that he don't fight much; but
in the spring-time he is lean, hungry, and fierce, and then everybody
must look out. There are so many chestnuts and hickory nuts in
the woods now that he can get all he wants to eat without scaring
the farmers by visiting them."</p>

<p>"The bear eats almost everything," said Nick, "but I don't believe
he can make much of a meal off hickory nuts."</p>

<p>"Well, he has got a good thing of it anyway, here, there is so
much food around him, and if he had only been smart enough to
keep out of sight and never show himself he might have died of
old age without being once disturbed by hunters."</p>

<p>"I ain't sure he won't die of old age as it is," said Nick, with
a laugh; "for every one who went after him came back without the
first glimpse. I guess they have all given up hope of shooting
him, and I shouldn't wonder if we had to do the same."</p>

<p>But whether such was to be the result or not remained to be seen,
and the boys were sure of plenty of sport in an all-day ramble
through the woods.</p>

<p>During all this time Nick and Nellie were attending school, and
they maintained their places in their studies, and were surpassed
by none in the excellence of their deportment.</p>

<p>Nick rose early and helped his father with his work, and at night
did his chores. With all this, he found opportunity to practice
with the rifle and to prepare his lessons for the morrow, so that
it need not be said he had little idle time on his hands.</p>

<p>On a bright Saturday morning in November, when the smoky haze
of the delicious Indian summer overspread forest, stream, and
country, Sam Harper came to the house of Nick Ribsam according
to appointment.</p>

<p>His rifle was slung over his shoulder, and the dog, which they
had christened Bowser, was at his heels. There was no school that
day, and Mr. Ribsam, having satisfied himself of the ability of
Nick to handle the rifle of his neighbor, had given him permission
to go on a hunt for the bear which had so frightened Nellie a
couple of months before.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter were a little anxious when the rosy-cheeked
boy donned his heavy boots, pushed his trousers down the legs,
and taking the long-barreled rifle from where it rested in the
corner turned to kiss them good-by.</p>

<p>Mr. Ribsam seemed as cool and stolid as ever; but any one looking
closely at him would have observed that he puffed his pipe a little
oftener than was his wont, while his eye beamed more kindly upon
his brave little boy.</p>

<p>"Look out, Nick, and don't be too venturesome," said the mother,
as she pressed her lips to those of her only son.</p>

<p>"And remember that the bear is an awful big animal," said Nellie,
"for I <em>seen</em> him."</p>

<p>The brother, who was in the act of leaning over his sister to
kiss her, drew back with a reproving look.</p>

<p>"Why is it a girl can't talk without saying 'awful' in every
sentence? I wish for variety's sake, Nellie, you and the rest
of the girls would leave 'awful' out of one sentence in a hundred,
and don't say 'I <em>seen</em> him,' for you know better than
that, sister."</p>

<p>She hung her head and her eyes were growing misty, when Nick
took the kiss with a laugh and moved to the door.</p>

<p>"There, there, good-by; you all act as if I was going to Africa
to hunt lions and tigers."</p>

<p>Nellie snapped him up in a flash:</p>

<p>"There ain't any tigers in Africa, smarty!"</p>

<p>"You got me that time," laughed Nick; "where is father?"</p>

<p>"He went out of the door a minute ago; he is standing by the
gate," said the mother, after a quick glance through the window.</p>

<p>Mr. Ribsam was leaning on the gate-post, as was a favorite custom
of his, and the tobacco smoke ascended in clouds and rings, as
though he was a locomotive tugging hard at a train, with the wheels
continually slipping.</p>

<p>He looked at the boys without stirring or speaking, as they passed
out the gate and gently closed it, so as not to jar the old gentleman
leaning upon it.</p>

<p>When they had gone a rod or so, Mr. Ribsam called out:</p>

<p>"Nicholas!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" answered the son, wheeling instantly.</p>

<p>The father took the long stem of his pipe from his mouth, emitted
a blast of vapor, and then shut his eyes and flung his head backward
with a quick flirt, which meant that his boy should come to him.</p>

<p>Nick obeyed with his usual promptness, and paused immediately
in front of his parent, while Sam Harper stopped short and looked
backward at the two, with the purpose of waiting until the interview
ended.</p>

<p>The old gentleman meant his words for both, and he therefore
used the English tongue as best he could, and spoke loud:</p>

<p>"Nicholas, bears ish shtrong amimals as nefer vos: they can squeeze
in der ribs of a ox of dey tried, I dinks, so looks out dot de
bears don't not squeeze mit you."</p>

<p>"I will take good care, you may depend."</p>

<p>"His claws am sharp and he has big jaws; look outs for dem, Nicholas!"</p>

<p>"You may be sure I will."</p>

<p>"And, Nicholas, ven you goes for to hunt bears <em>you must helps
one anoder; you hears</em>?"</p>

<p>This was the all-important sentence the father had prepared himself
to utter. It will be observed that it was in violation of his
oft repeated creed, for it clearly called upon the boys to render
mutual support should danger arise; and they would have been zanies
had they not done so.</p>

<p>The father expected them to show that much sense, but he was
impelled to impress the necessity of it: he meant them to understand
that his declarations were subject to amendment under certain
conditions.</p>

<p>Nick gave the pledge and stepped briskly up the road with Sam,
while Bowser frolicked in the fields and road until they were
fairly in the woods, when he frisked among the trees, sometimes
starting up a squirrel or rabbit, which had no trouble in skurrying
out of his reach.</p>

<p>As the bear when seen by Nellie was near Shark Creek, the boys
agreed to follow the road to the bridge, descend into the bed
of the stream, and then go downward toward the pond and finally
off into the woods, where they intended to pass that day and probably
the night and following day.</p>

<p>They had reached and passed the tree in which Nellie Ribsam took
refuge two months before, when Nick suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hallo, there is some one ahead of us!"</p>

<p>"It's the season for game and we shall find plenty of hunters
in the wood," said Sam Harper, who, nevertheless, scanned the
person with much interest.</p>

<p>The fact that the boys were following precisely in his footsteps
raised the suggestion that perhaps he was engaged on the same
business or sport, as it might be termed.</p>

<p>Our friends hastened their pace so as to overtake him, for his
company might be desirable, or possibly it might be otherwise.</p>

<p>"Hallo, there!" called out Nick; "wait a minute!"</p>

<p>The individual thus hailed turned about, and looked back to see
who it was that called.</p>

<p>As he did so his face was seen, and Nick Ribsam gave utterance
to an expression of astonishment.</p>
