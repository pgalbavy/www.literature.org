<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Towards the close of a wet afternoon two tongas discharged Lewis,
George, two native servants, and a collection of gun-cases in
the court-yard of the one hotel in Bardur. They had made a record
journey up country, stopping to present no letters of introduction,
which are the thieves of time. Now, as Lewis found himself in
the strait valley, with the eternal snows where the sky should
be, and sniffed the dry air from the granite walls, he glowed
with the pleasure of recollection.</p>

<p>The place was the same as ever. The same medley of races perambulated
the streets. Sheep-skinned Central Asians and Mongolian merchants
from Yarkand still displayed their wares and their cunning; Hunza
tribesmen, half-clad Chitralis, wild-eyed savages from Yagistan
mingled in the narrow stone streets with the civilized Persian
and Turcoman from beyond the mountains. Kashmir sepoys, an untidy
race, still took their ease in the sun, and soldiers of South
India from the Imperial Service Troops showed their odd accoutrements
and queer race mixtures. The place looked and smelled like a kind
of home, and Lewis, with one eye on the gun-cases and one on the
great hills, forgot his heart-sickness and had leisure for the
plain joys of expectation.</p>

<p>"I am going to get to work at once," he said, when he had washed
the dust out of his eyes and throat. "I shall go and call on the
Logans this very minute, and I expect we shall see Thwaite and
some of the soldiers at the club to-night." So George, much against
his will, was compelled to don a fresh suit and suffer himself
to be conducted to the bungalow of the British Resident.</p>

<p>The Sahib was from home, at Gilgit, but Madame would receive
the strangers. So the two found themselves in a drawing-room aggressively
English in its air, shaking hands with a small woman with kind
eyes and a washed-out complexion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Logan was unaffectedly glad to see them. She had that trick
of dominating her surroundings which English ladies seem to bear
to the uttermost ends of the globe. There, in that land of snows
and rock, with savage tribesmen not thirty miles away, and the
British frontier-line something less than fifty, she gave them
tea and talked small talk with the ease and gusto of an English
country home.</p>

<p>"It's the most unfortunate thing in the world," she cried. "If
you had only wired, Gilbert would have stayed, but as it is he
has gone down to Gilgit about some polo ponies, and won't be back
for two days. Things are so humdrum and easy-going up here that
one loses interest in one's profession. Gilbert has nothing to
do except arrange with the foreman of the coolies who are making
roads, and hold stupid courts, and consult with Captain Thwaite
and the garrison people. The result is that the poor man has become
crazy about golf, and wastes all his spare money on polo ponies.
You can have no idea what a godsend a new face is to us poor people.
It is simply delightful to see you again, Mr. Haystoun. You left
us about sixteen months ago, didn't you? Did you enjoy going back?"</p>

<p>Lewis said yes, with an absurd sense of the humour of the question.
The lady talked as if home had been merely an interlude, instead
of the crisis of his life.</p>

<p>"And what did you do? And whom did you see? Please tell me, for
I am dying for a gossip."</p>

<p>"I have been home in Scotland, you know. Looking after my affairs
and idling. I stood for Parliament and got beaten."</p>

<p>"Really! How exciting! Where is your home in Scotland, Mr. Haystoun?
You told me once, but I have forgotten. You know I have no end
of Scotch relatives."</p>

<p>"It's in rather a remote part, a place called Etterick, in Glenavelin."</p>

<p>"Glenavelin, Glenavelin," the lady repeated. "That's where the
Manorwaters live, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"My uncle," said Lewis.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from a friend who was staying there in the summer.
I wonder if you ever met her. A Miss Wishart. Alice Wishart?"</p>

<p>Lewis strove to keep any extraordinary interest out of his eyes.
This voice from another world had broken rudely in upon his new
composure.</p>

<p>"I knew her," he said, and his tone was of such studied carelessness
that Mrs. Logan looked up at him curiously.</p>

<p>"I hope you liked her, for her mother was a relation of my husband,
and when I have been home the small Alice has always been a great
friend of mine. I wonder if she has grown pretty. Gilbert and
I used to bet about it on different sides. I said she would be
very beautiful some day."</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," said Lewis in a level voice, and George,
feeling the thin ice, came to his friend's rescue. He could at
least talk naturally of Miss Wishart.</p>

<p>"The Wisharts took the place, you know, Mrs. Logan, so we saw
a lot of them. The girl was delightful, good sportswoman and all
that sort of thing, and capital company. I wonder she never told
us about you. She knew we were coming out here, for I told her,
and she was very interested."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's odd, for I suppose she had read Mr. Haystoun's book,
where my husband comes in a good deal. I shall tell her about
seeing you in my next letter. And now tell me your plans."</p>

<p>Lewis's face had begun to burn in a most compromising way. Those
last days in Glenavelin had risen again before the eye of his
mind and old wounds were reopened. The thought that Alice was
not yet wholly out of his life, that the new world was not utterly
severed from the old, affected him with a miserable delight. Mrs.
Logan became invested with an extraordinary interest. He pulled
himself together to answer her question.</p>

<p>"Oh, our errand is much the same as last time. We want to get
all the sport we can, and if possible to cross the mountains into
Turkestan. I am rather keen on geographical work just now, and
there's a bit of land up here which wants exploring."</p>

<p>The lady laughed. "That sounds like poor dear Mr. Gribton. I
suppose you remember him? He left here in the summer, but when
he lived in Bardur he had got that northern frontier-line on the
brain. He was a horrible bore, for he would always work the conversation
round to it sooner or later. I think it was really Mr. Gribton
who made people often lose interest in these questions. They had
to assume an indolent attitude in pure opposition to his fussiness."</p>

<p>"When will your husband be home?" Lewis asked.</p>

<p>"In two days, or possibly three. I am so sorry about it. I'll
wire at once, but it's a slow journey, especially if he is bringing
ponies. Of course you want to see him before you start. It's such
a pity, but Bardur is fearfully empty of men just now. Captain
Thwaite has gone off after ibex, and though I think he will be
back to-morrow, I am afraid he will be too late for my dance.
Oh, really, this is lucky. I had forgotten all about it. Of course
you two will come. That will make two more men, and we shall be
quite a respectable party. We are having a dance to-morrow night,
and as the English people here are so few and uncertain in their
movements we can't afford to miss a chance. You <em>must</em>
come. I've got the Thwaites and the Beresfords and the Waltons,
and some of the garrison people who are down on leave. Oh, and
there's a man coming whom you must know. A Mr. Marker, a most
delightful person. I don't think you met him before, but you must
have heard my husband talk about him. He is the very man for your
purpose. Gilbert says he knows the hills better than any of the
Hunza tribesmen, and that he is the best sportsman he ever met.
Besides, he is such an interesting person, very much a man of
the world, you know, who has been everywhere and knows everybody."</p>

<p>Lewis congratulated himself on his luck. "I should like very
much to come to the dance, and I especially want to meet Mr. Marker."</p>

<p>"He is half Scotch, too," said the lady. "His mother was a Kirkpatrick
or some name like that, and he actually seems to talk English
with a kind of Scotch accent. Of course that may be the German
part of him. He is a Pomeranian count or something of the sort,
and very rich. You might get him to go with you into the hills."</p>

<p>"I wish we could," said Lewis falsely. His curiosity was keenly
excited.</p>

<p>"Why does he come up here such a lot?" George asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose because he likes to 'knock about,' as you call it.
He is a tremendous traveller. He has been into Tibet and all over
Turkestan and Persia. Gilbert says that he is the wonder of the
age."</p>

<p>"Is he here just now?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so. I know he is coming to-morrow, because
he wrote me about it, and promised to come to my dance. But he
is a very busy man, so I don't suppose he will arrive till just
before. He wrote me from Gilgit, so he may find Gilbert there
and bring him up with him."</p>

<p>Marker, Marker. The air seemed full of the strange name. Lewis
saw again Wratislaw's wrinkled face when he talked of him, and
remembered his words. "You were within an ace of meeting one of
the cleverest men living, a cheerful being in whom the Foreign
Office is more interested than in any one else in the world."
Wratislaw had never been in the habit of talking without good
authority. This Marker must be indeed a gentleman of parts.</p>

<p>Then conversation dwindled. Lewis, his mind torn between bitter
memories and the pressing necessities of his mission, lent a stupid
ear to Mrs. Logan's mild complaints, her gossip about Bardur,
her eager questions about home. George manfully took his place,
and by a fortunate clumsiness steered the flow of the lady's talk
from Glenavelin and the Wisharts. Lewis spoke now and then, when
appealed to, but he was busy thinking out his own problem. On
the morrow night he should meet Marker, and his work would reveal
itself. Meanwhile he was in the dark, the flimsiest adventurer
on the wildest of errands. This easy, settled place, these Englishmen
whose minds held fast by polo and games, these English ladies
who had no thought beyond little social devices to relieve the
monotony of the frontier, all seemed to make a mockery of his
task. He had fondly imagined himself going to a certainty of toil
and danger; to his vexation this certainty seemed to be changing
into the most conventional of visits to the most normal of places.
But to-morrow he should see Marker; and his hope revived at the
prospect.</p>

<p>"It is so pleasant seeing two fresh fellow-countrymen," Mrs.
Logan was saying. "Do you know, you two people look quite different
from our men up here. They are all so dried up and tired out.
Our complexions are all gone, and our eyes have got that weariness
of the sun in them which never goes away even when we go home
again. But you two look quite keen and fresh and enthusiastic.
You mustn't mind compliments from an old woman, but I wish our
own people looked as nice as you. You will make us all homesick."</p>

<p>A native servant entered, more noiseless and more dignified than
any English footman, and announced another visitor. Lewis lifted
his head, and saw the lady rise, smiling, to greet a tall man
who had come in with the frankness of a privileged acquaintance.
"How do you do, Mr. Marker?" he heard. "I am so glad to see you.
We didn't dare to expect you till to-morrow. May I introduce two
English friends, Mr. Haystoun and Mr. Winterham?"</p>

<p>And so the meeting came about in the simplest way. Lewis found
himself shaking hands cordially with a man who stood upright,
quite in the English fashion, and smiled genially on the two strangers.
Then he took the vacant chair by Mrs. Logan, and answered the
lady's questions with the ease and kindliness of one who knows
and likes his fellow-creatures. He deplored Logan's absence, grew
enthusiastic about the dance, and produced from a pocket certain
sweetmeats, not made in Kashmir, for the two children. Then he
turned to George and asked pleasantly about the journey. How did
they find the roads from Gilgit? He hoped they would get good
sport, and if he could be of any service, would they command him?
He had heard of Lewis's former visit, and, of course, he had read
his book. The most striking book of travel he had seen for long.
Of course he didn't agree with certain things, but each man for
his own view; and he should like to talk over the matter with
Mr. Haystoun. Were they staying long? At Galetti's of course?
By good luck that was also his headquarters. And so he talked
pleasingly, in the style of a lady's drawing-room, while Lewis,
his mind consumed with interest, sat puzzling out the discords
in his face.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Marker, we were talking about you before you
came in. I was telling Mr. Haystoun that I thought you were half
Scotch. Mr. Haystoun, you know, lives in Scotland."</p>

<p>"Do you really? Then I am a thousand times delighted to meet
you, for I have many connections with Scotland. My grandmother
was a Scotswoman, and though I have never been in your beautiful
land, yet I have known many of your people. And, indeed, I have
heard of one of your name who was a friend of my father's&mdash;a certain
Mr. Haystoun of Etterick."</p>

<p>"My father," said Lewis.</p>

<p>"Ah, I am so pleased to hear. My father and he met often in Paris,
when they were attached to their different embassies. My father
was in the German service."</p>

<p>"Your mother was Russian, was she not?" Lewis asked tactlessly,
impelled by he knew not what motive.</p>

<p>"Ah, how did you know?" Mr. Marker smiled in reply, with the
slightest raising of the eyebrows. "I have indeed the blood of
many nationalities in my veins. Would that I were equally familiar
with all nations, for I know less of Russia than I know of Scotland.
We in Germany are their near neighbours, and love them, as you
do here, something less than ourselves."</p>

<p>He talked English with that pleasing sincerity which seems inseparable
from the speech of foreigners, who use a purer and more formal
idiom than ourselves. George looked anxiously towards Lewis, with
a question in his eyes, but finding his companion abstracted,
he spoke himself.</p>

<p>"I have just arrived," said the other simply; "but it was from
a different direction. I have been shooting in the hills, getting
cool air into my lungs after the valleys. Why, Mrs. Logan, I have
been down to Rawal Pindi since I saw you last, and have been choked
with the sun. We northerners do not take kindly to glare and dust."</p>

<p>"But you are an old hand here, they tell me. I wish you'd show
me the ropes, you know. I'm very keen, but as ignorant as a babe.
What sort of rifles do they use here? I wish you'd come and look
at my ironmongery." And George plunged into technicalities.</p>

<p>When Lewis rose to leave, following unwillingly the convention
which forbids a guest to stay more than five minutes after a new
visitor has arrived, Marker crossed the room with them. "If you're
not engaged for to-night, Mr. Haystoun, will you do me the honour
to dine with me? I am alone, and I think we might manage to find
things to talk about." Lewis accepted gladly, and with one of
his sweetest smiles the gentleman returned to Mrs. Logan's side.</p>
