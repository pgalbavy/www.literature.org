<p><em>THIS </em>savage onslaught, which but for the presence of
mind of M. Eliphaste would have terminated in the amputation of
M. Longuet’s hand, proved to them that the sanguine imagination
of Cartouche had so completely invaded the brain of M. Longuet
that it seemed to them the only remedy for such a misfortune was
the death of Cartouche.</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste did not hesitate. He had reasoned with him in vain,
and had even hoped at one time that he had been victorious, but
this incident undoubtedly proved otherwise. He rose and looked
at Théophraste, giving him a long, steady glance, which seemed
to pierce the uttermost depths of his soul. Théophraste sighed
several times and began to tremble violently, when M. Eliphaste
cried, "Cartouche, I order you to sleep." Théophraste fell as
if stricken on the armchair which stood behind him, and did not
make another move. His respiration was so silent that they doubted
if he still lived. Marceline ran to him alarmed, but M. Eliphaste
restrained her, saying, "All is well. The operation of the death
of Cartouche has begun."</p>

<p>Adolphe knew, from several examples, that there is always a great
risk when one wishes to kill a reincarnated soul—that is to say,
to throw it back toward the past. There is a risk of killing the
body in which it is reincarnated. And so he knew that trying to
kill the soul of Cartouche without killing Théophraste was a great
undertaking.</p>

<p>It needed all the authority, and all the science of M. Eliphaste,
to calm them in the extremity in which they found themselves.
He was the most intellectual and scientific spiritualist of the
day. He had the most absolute and domineering will that the world
had seen since Jacques Molay, to whom he had succeeded, by the
supreme direction of the secret order of Temphis. He had made
an allegorical demonstration of his last treatise on "Psychic
Surgery," and had analyzed the subject in his pamphlet on "Astral
Scalpel."</p>

<p>It is necessary to enumerate all the accomplishments of M. Eliphaste,
for it gives Adolphe a chance of refuting in advance the reproach
put upon him for letting him treat his best friend with the utmost
severity. The criminal eccentricities of M. Longuet, of which
Signor Petito was the first victim, made him dread the most irremediable
catastrophes, and it was for this reason that he was led to consider
the operation of Cartouche as a benefit, not only possible, but
probable, without too great a risk to Théophraste. As to Mme.
Longuet, her faith in M. Eliphaste was so great that at first
she only made a few remarks, so as to relieve her of any responsibility,
and then the terror that she had of sleeping with Cartouche made
her, over and above everything, desire his death.</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste told Adolphe to take Théophraste’s heels, and he
took and held him under the armpits, and they carried him into
the sub-cellar, where a laboratory had been fitted up, which was
lighted in the day by gas, with large, red, hissing flames.</p>

<p>Mme. Longuet followed. They placed Théophraste on a bed, and
bound him down with straps. He was still under the mesmeric influence.
M. Eliphaste stood over him, watching him closely, for a quarter
of an hour, during which time there was a deep silence in the
room. At length a voice was heard. It was M. Eliphaste praying.
The prayer began in this way:</p>

<p>"In the beginning there was silence. Oh, age Eternal, source
of all ages&#11834;"</p>

<p>When the prayer was ended, M. Eliphaste took Théophraste by the
hand and seemed to command him without speaking. He questioned
Théophraste by the strength of his domineering spirit —only by
the answers Théophraste made could they understand what he had
been commanded to tell. Théophraste said, without effort, "Yes,
I see. Yes, I am. I am M. Théophraste Longuet; in an apartment
of the Rue Gerondeau." M. Eliphaste turned toward Adolphe and
Marceline. "The operation is a bad one," he said in a deep voice.
"I have put Cartouche to sleep, and Théophraste answers me. He
is sleeping in the present. We must not precipitate matters. It
will be dangerous."</p>

<p>"I am in the Rue Gerondeau—in the apartment under mine—and I
see stretched on the bed a man without ears. In front of him a
woman; a dark woman—she is pretty—she is young—her name is Regina—the
woman is saying to the man, ‘Signor Petito, as true as I am called
Regina, and that you have lost your ears, you will cease to see
me in forty-eight hours if you have not found the means to give
me a little comfort, to which I have a right. When I married you,
you basely deceived me, both as to your fortune and as to your
intelligence. Your fortune rested only in hopes which have not
been realized. What are you going to do?’</p>

<p>"Signor Petito replies, ‘My dear Regina, you puzzle me. Leave
me in peace to find a trace of the treasures that the imbecile
above is incapable of snatching from the profound depths of the
earth.’"</p>

<p>Théophraste made them understand, in his sleep, that the imbecile
referred to was Cartouche. M. Eliphaste turned toward them, saying,
"I expect that word to make him quit the present. Now, madam,
the time has come. I am going to tempt God." And then he spoke
in a commanding voice, in a voice that it seemed impossible not
to obey. "Cartouche," said he, extending his hand above the strapped
bed with a commanding majesty, "Cartouche, where wast thou on
the night of the first of April, 1721, at ten o’clock?"</p>

<p>"On the night of April first, 1721, at ten o’clock, I struck
two light blows on the door, with the intention of making them
open the door of the Tavern Reine Margot. I never should have
believed that I could have reached the ironmonger’s shop so easily.
But I had killed the horse of the French guardsman, and I had
thrown those who had followed him into the Seine. At the Reine
Margot I found Paleton, Gatelard, and Guenal Noire. La Belle Laittiere
was with them. I related the story to them while emptying a bottle
of wine. I had confidence in them, and I told them that I suspected
Va de Bon Cœur—and perhaps Marie Antoinette—of having whispered
something to the spies. They cried out, but I cried out louder
than they. I announced to them that I had decided to deal summarily
with all who gave me cause to suspect them. I became very angry,
and La Belle Laittiere told me that I was no longer bearable.
Was it my fault? Every one had betrayed me. I could not sleep
two nights consecutively in one place. Where, then, were the days
when all Paris was with me? Where, then, was the day of my wedding
to Marie Antoinette, when we sang the air of ‘Tout joli belle
menniere, Tout joli moulin’? Where was now my uncle Taton? Shut
up in a castle. And his son? Killed by me because he was going
to denounce me. I had done it quickly. A pistol shot, and his
corpse was under a pile of rubbish. Then I was sure of his silence.
I killed the robber Pepin, and the police officer Huron. I did
not ask anything, only that they leave me alone to police Paris
for the security of everybody. My great council," this he murmured
to himself, "did not pardon me for having Jacques le Febrere executed.
I am no longer bearable, and that is because I wish to live. After
that which had come to pass," continued Théophraste in his hypnotic
sleep, "and the miraculous way in which I escaped in spite of
treachery and the precautions taken by the spies, I did not conceal
from Gate-lard or from Guenal Noire that I had decided to leave
them.</p>

<p>"I soon left them and opened the door of the Reine Margot. Not
a soul in the ironmonger’s shop. I was saved. I did not even stop
Magdelen, whom I passed while walking along the walls of the cemetery,
where I was going to sleep that night. Truth was, I was going
to pass the night like a robber in my hole in the Rue Amelot.
It was pouring with rain."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the strange tone in which this
narrative was related. The undulation of the phrases, their stops
and their stations, then the peculiar monotone in which the words
fell from Théophraste’s lips while he was in the hypnotic sleep.
His face sometimes expressed anger, sometimes contempt, and sometimes
terror.</p>

<p>M. Lecamus, who had seen Cartouche’s portrait, recalled that
at certain times there was a striking resemblance to that of Théophraste.
Just as he was relating the incident of passing Magdelen, and
the downpour of rain, Théophraste’s face showed a most peculiar
expression, changing from joy to most overwhelming despair.</p>

<p>M. Eliphaste, leaning over the bed, asked him: "What then, Cartouche?"</p>

<p>Théophraste replied in a rattling voice: "I killed a passerby."</p>

<p>The operation continued, but it was only by degrees that M. Eliphaste
wished to bring Cartouche to the hour of his death. Before making
him live his death, it was necessary to make him live a little
of his life. That was the reason that M. Eliphaste had thrown
the spirit of Cartouche back to the month of April, 1721.</p>

<p>Though the minutes following were terrible for the onlookers,
they were worse for Cartouche, who was passing through the end
of his career the second time.</p>

<p>It was not until October 11, 1721, that the treason bore fruit.</p>

<p>Coustard, sergeant in the company of Cha-bannes, took forty men
and four sergeants with him, all of whom were designated by Duchatelle,
Cartouche’s lieutenant, who had betrayed him. This little army,
in citizen clothes, concealing its arms very mysteriously, surrounded
the house pointed out by Duchatelle.</p>

<p>It could not have been more than nine o’clock in the evening
when they arrived in sight of the tavern, Au Pictolet, kept by
Germain Tassard and his wife, near the Rue des Trois Bornes. Tassard
was smoking his pipe on the doorstep, when Duchatelle came up
and demanded, "Is there nobody upstairs? No? Where are the four
ladies?"</p>

<p>Tassard, who expected this question, said, "Go up."</p>

<p>The little troop rushed in, and when they came to the room above,
they found Boloquy and Cartouche drinking wine before the fireplace.
Gaillard was in bed, and Cartouche was seated on the bed, mending
his breeches.</p>

<p>They rushed upon him. The attack was so sudden that he had no
time to make any resistance. They tied him with strong ropes,
and, placing him in the coach, took him prisoner to Monsieur the
Secretary of State. Then he was taken to the Grande Châtelet.</p>

<p>He was in his shirt, having had no time to put on his breeches.
He kept cool, congratulating the lieutenant who had betrayed him
on the fine livery he wore.</p>

<p>As the coach passed down the road, it nearly crushed some poor
wretch who was in the way, and Cartouche, seeing his plight, shouted
to him that phrase which he seemed to have affected, "It is necessary
to look out for the wheel."</p>

<p>All the people ran out to see him on his way to the house of
M. the Secretary of State. They cried out, "It is Cartouche! It
is Cartouche!" only half believing it, as they had so often been
deceived.</p>

<p>While in the prison awaiting trial, Cartouche received many illustrious
visitors. The Regent came; the courtesan Emilie and the Mme. le
Maréchale de Boufflers followed one after the other to pay the
prisoner small attentions. Some one had composed a play, and Quinnato,
the famous actor of the time, who filled the principal rôle in
it, came to ask him for suggestions about the chief scene.</p>

<p>When Cartouche had been sufficiently amused, he began to think
of making his escape. He intended doing this in spite of the very
close watch that was being kept over him.</p>

<p>After getting out of his dungeon, and just as he was pushing
the last bar which separated him from the street and liberty,
he was discovered and caught.</p>

<p>Thinking that the Grande Châtelet was not strong enough for so
ingenious a man, he was bound securely in chains and taken to
the Conciergerie, in the most formidable corner of the tower of
Montgomery.</p>
