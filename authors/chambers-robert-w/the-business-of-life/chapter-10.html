<p>Desboro's guests were determined to turn the house out of the
windows; its stodgy respectability incited them; every smug, smooth
portrait goaded them to unusual effort, and they racked their
brains to invent novelties.</p>

<p>On one day they opened all the windows in the disused west wing,
flooded the ground floor, hung the great stone room with paper
lanterns, and held an ice carnival. As masks and costumes had
been made entirely out of paper, there were several startling
effects and abrupt retirements to repair damages; but the dancing
on skates in the lantern light was very pretty, and even the youth
and pride of Westchester found the pace not unsuitably rapid.</p>

<p>On another day, Desboro's feminine guests sent to town for enough
green flannel to construct caricatures of hunting coats for everybody.</p>

<p>The remains of a stagnant pack of harriers vegetated on a neighbouring
estate; Desboro managed to mount his guests on his own live-stock,
including mules, farm horses, polo ponies, and a yoke of oxen;
and the county saw a hunting that they were not likely to forget.</p>

<p>Reggie Ledyard was magnificent astride an ox, with a paper megaphone
for a hunting horn, rubber boots, and his hastily basted coat
split from skirt to collar. The harriers ran wherever they pleased,
and the astonished farm mules wouldn't run at all. There was hysterical
excitement when one cotton-tail rabbit was started behind a barn
and instantly lost under it.</p>

<p>The hunt dinner was a weird and deafening affair, and the Weber-Field
ball costumes unbelievable.</p>

<p>Owing to reaction and exhaustion, repentant girls came to Jacqueline
requesting an interim of intellectual recuperation; so she obligingly
announced a lecture in the jade room, and talked to them very
prettily about jades and porcelains, suiting her words to their
intellectual capacity, which could grasp Kang-he porcelains and
Celedon and Sang-de-boeuf, but balked at the "three religions,"
and found <em>blanc de Chine</em> uninspiring. So she told them
about the <em>famille vert</em> and the <em>famille rose</em>;
about the K'ang Hsi period, which they liked, and how the imperial
kilns at Kiangsi developed the wonderful <em>clair de lune</em>
"turquoise blue" and "peach bloom," for which some of their friends
or relatives had paid through their various and assorted noses.</p>

<p>All of this her audience found interesting because they recognised
in the exquisite examples from Desboro's collection, with which
Jacqueline illustrated her impromptu lecture, objects both fashionable
and expensive; and what is both fashionable and expensive appeals
very forcibly to mediocrity.</p>

<p>"I saw a jar like that one at the Clydesdales'," said Reggie
Ledyard, a trifle excited at his own unexpected intelligence.
"How much is it worth, Miss Nevers?"</p>

<p>She laughed and looked at the vase between her slender fingers.</p>

<p>"Really," she said, "it isn't worth very much. But wealthy people
have established fictitious values for many rather crude and commonplace
things. If people had the courage to buy only what appealed to
them personally, there would be a mighty crash in tumbling values."</p>

<p>"We'd all wake up and find ourselves stuck," remarked Van Alstyne,
who possessed some pictures which he had come to loathe, but for
which he had paid terrific prices. "Jim, do you want to buy any
primitives, guaranteed genuine?"</p>

<p>"There's the thrifty Dutch trader for you," said Reggie. "I'm
loaded with rickety old furniture, too. They got me to furnish
my place with antiques! But you don't see me trying to sell 'em
to my host at a house party!"</p>

<p>"Stop your disputing," said Desboro pleasantly, "and ask Miss
Nevers for her professional opinion later. The chances are that
you both have been properly stuck, and I never had any sympathy
for wealthy ignorance, anyway."</p>

<p>But Ledyard and Van Alstyne, being very wealthy, became frightfully
depressed over the unfeeling jibes of Desboro; and Jacqueline
seemed to be by way of acquiring a pair of new clients.</p>

<p>In fact, both young men at various moments approached her on
the subject, but Desboro informed them that they might with equal
propriety ask a physician to prescribe for them at a dance, and
that Miss Nevers' office was open from nine until five.</p>

<p>"Gad," remarked Ledyard to Van Alstyne, with increasing respect,
"she is some girl, believe <em>me</em>, Stuyve. Only if she ever
married up with a man of our kind&mdash;good-night! She'd quit him
in a week."</p>

<p>Van Alstyne touched his forehead significantly.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "Nothing doing <em>inside</em> our conks. But
why the Lord made her such a peach outside as well as inside is
driving me to Jersey! Most of 'em are so awful to look at, don't
y'know. Come on, anyway. <em>I</em> can't keep away from her."</p>

<p>"She's somewhere with the others playing baseball golf," said
Reggie, gloomily, following his friend. "Isn't it terrible to
see a girl in the world like that&mdash;apparently created to make
some good gink happy&mdash;and suddenly find out that she has even
more brains than beauty! My God, Stuyve, it's hard on a man like
me."</p>

<p>"Are you really hard hit?"</p>

<p>"<em>Am</em> I? And how about you?"</p>

<p>"It's the real thing here," admitted Van Alstyne. "But what's
the use?"</p>

<p>They agreed that there was no use; but during the dance that
evening both young men managed to make their intentions clear
to Jacqueline.</p>

<p>Reggie Ledyard had persuaded her to a few minutes' promenade
in the greenhouse; and there, standing amid thickets of spicy
carnations, the girl listened to her first proposal from a man
of that outer world about which, until a few days ago, she had
known nothing.</p>

<p>The boy was not eloquent; he made a clumsy attempt to kiss her
and was defeated. He seemed to her very big, and blond, and handsome
as he stood there; and she felt a little pity for him, too, partly
because his ideas were so few and his vocabulary so limited.</p>

<p>Perplexed, silent, sorry for him, yet still conscious of a little
thrill of wonder and content that a man of the outer world had
found her eligible, she debated within herself how best to spare
him. And, as usual, the truth presented itself to her as the only
explanation.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, lifting her troubled eyes, "I am in love
with some one else."</p>

<p>"Good God!" he muttered. After a silence he said humbly: "Would
it be unpardonable if <em>I&mdash;</em><em>would</em> you tell me whether
you are engaged?"</p>

<p>She blushed with surprise at the idea.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, startled. "<em>I&mdash;</em>don't expect to be."</p>

<p>"What?" he exclaimed incredulously. "Is there a man on earth
ass enough not to fall in love with you if you ever condescended
to smile at him twice?"</p>

<p>But the ideas which he was evoking seemed to distress her, and
she averted her face and stood twisting a long-stemmed carnation
with nervous fingers.</p>

<p>Not even to herself, either before or since Desboro's letter
which had revealed him so unmistakably, had the girl ventured
in her inmost thoughts to think the things which this big, blond,
loutish boy had babbled.</p>

<p>What Desboro was, she understood. She had had the choice of dismissing
him from her mind, with scorn and outraged pride as aids to help
the sacrifice, or of accepting him as he was&mdash;as she knew him
to be&mdash;for the sake of something about him as yet inexplicable
even to herself.</p>

<p>And she had chosen.</p>

<p>But now a man of Desboro's world had asked her to be his wife.
More than that; he had assumed that she was fitted to be the wife
of anybody.</p>

</div>
<p>They walked back together. She was adorable with him, kind, timidly
sympathetic and smilingly silent by turns, venturing even to rally
him a little, console him a little, moved by an impulse toward
friendship wholly unfeigned.</p>

<p>"All I have to say is," he muttered, "that you're a peach and
a corker; and I'm going to invent some way of marrying you, even
if it lands me in an East Side night-school."</p>

<p>Even he joined in her gay laughter; and presently Van Alstyne,
who had been glowering at them, managed to get her away. But she
would have nothing further to do with greenhouses, or dark landings,
or libraries; so he asked her bluntly while they were dancing;
and she shook her head, and very soon dropped his arm.</p>

<p>There was a bay-window near them; she made a slight gesture of
irritation; and there, in the partly curtained seclusion, he learned
that she was grateful and happy that he liked her so much; that
she liked him very much, but that she loved somebody else.</p>

<p>He took it rather badly at first; she began to understand that
few girls would have lightly declined a Van Alstyne; and he was
inclined to be patronising, sulky and dignified&mdash;an impossible
combination&mdash;for it ditched him finally, and left him kissing
her hands and declaring constancy eternal.</p>

<p>That night, at parting, Desboro retained her offered hand a trifle
longer than convention required, and looked at her more curiously
than usual.</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying the party, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Every minute of it. I have never been as happy."</p>

<p>"I suppose you realise that everybody is quite mad about you."</p>

<p>"Everybody is nice to me! People are so much kinder than I imagined."</p>

<p>"Are they? How do you get on with the gorgon?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hammerton? Do you know she is perfectly sweet? I never
dreamed she could be so gentle and thoughtful and considerate.
Why&mdash;and it seems almost ridiculous to say it&mdash;she seems to have
the ideas of a mother about whatever concerns me. She actually
fusses over me sometimes&mdash;and&mdash;it is&mdash;agreeable."</p>

<p>An inexplicable shyness suddenly overcame her, and she said good-night
hastily, and mounted the stairs to her room.</p>

<p>Later, when she was prepared for bed, Mrs. Hammerton knocked
and came in.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline," she said bluntly, "what was Reggie Ledyard saying
to you this evening? I'll box his ears if he proposed to you.
Did he?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I am afraid he did."</p>

<p>"You didn't take him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I should think not! I'd as soon expect you to marry a stable
groom. He has all the beauty and healthy colour of one. Also the
distinguished mental capacity. You don't want that kind."</p>

<p>"I don't want any kind."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it. Did any other fool hint anything more of that
sort?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Alstyne."</p>

<p>"Oho! Stuyvesant, too? Well, what did you say to <em>him</em>?"
asked the old lady, with animation.</p>

<p>"I said no."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I said no. I am not in love with Mr. Van Alstyne."</p>

<p>"Child! Do you realise that you had the opportunity of your life!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline's smile was confused and deprecating.</p>

<p>"But when a girl doesn't care for a man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to marry for <em>love</em>?"</p>

<p>The girl sat silent a moment, then shook her head.</p>

<p>"I shall not marry," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! And if you feel that way, what am I good for? What
earthly use am I to you? Will you kindly inform me?"</p>

<p>She had seated herself on the bed's edge, leaning over the girl
where she lay on her pillows.</p>

<p>"Answer me," she insisted. "Of what use am I to you?"</p>

<p>For a full minute the girl lay there looking up at her without
stirring. Then a smile glimmered in her eyes; she lifted both
arms and laid them on the older woman's shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are useful&mdash;this way," she said; and kissed her lightly
on the forehead.</p>

<p>The effect on Aunt Hannah was abrupt; she caught the girl to
her breast and held her there fiercely and in silence for a moment;
then, releasing her, tucked her in with mute violence, turned
off the light and marched out without a word.</p>

</div>
<p>Day after day Desboro's guests continued to turn the house inside
out, ransacking it from garret to cellar.</p>

<p>"We don't intend to do anything in this house that anybody has
ever done here, or at any house party," explained Reggie Ledyard
to Jacqueline. "So if any lady cares to walk down stairs on her
head the incident will be quite in order."</p>

<p>"Can she slide down the banisters instead?" asked Helsa Steyr.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll have to slide up to be original," said Betty Barkley.</p>

<p>"How can anybody slide <em>up</em> the banisters?" demanded Reggie
hotly.</p>

<p>"You've the intellect of a terrapin," said Betty scornfully.
"It's because nobody has ever done it that it ought to be done
here."</p>

<p>Desboro, seated on the pool table, told her she could do whatever
she desired, including arson, as long as she didn't disturb the
Aqueduct Police.</p>

<p>Katharine Frere said to Jacqueline: "Everything you do is so
original. Can't you invent something new for us to do?"</p>

<p>"She might suggest that you all try to think," said Mrs. Hammerton
tartly. "That would be novelty enough."</p>

<p>Cairns seized the megaphone and shouted: "Help! Help! Aunt Hannah
is after us!"</p>

<p>Captain Herrendene, seated beside Desboro with a half smile on
his face, glanced across at Jacqueline who stood in the embrasure
of a window, a billiard cue resting across her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Please invent something for us, Miss Nevers," he said.</p>

<p>"Why don't you play hide and seek?" sneered Mrs. Hammerton, busily
knitting a tie. "It's suited to your intellects."</p>

<p>"Let Miss Nevers suggest a new way of playing the oldest game
ever invented," added Betty Barkley. "There is no possibility
of inventing anything new; everything was first done in the year
one. Even protoplasmic cells played hide-and-seek together."</p>

<p>"What rot!" said Reggie. "You can't play that in a new way."</p>

<p>"You could play it in a sporting way," said Cairns.</p>

<p>"How's that, old top?"</p>

<p>"Well, for example, you conceal yourself, and whatever girl finds
you has got to marry you. How's that for a reckless suggestion?"</p>

<p>But it had given Reggie something resembling an idea.</p>

<p>"Let us be hot sports," he said, with animation; "draw lots to
see which girl will hide somewhere in the house; make a time-limit
of one hour; and if any man finds her she'll marry him. There
isn't a girl here," he added, jeeringly, "who has the sporting
nerve to try it!"</p>

<p>A chorus of protests greeted the challenge. Athalie Vannis declared
that she was crazy to marry somebody; but she insisted that the
men would only pretend to search, and were really too cowardly
to hunt in earnest. Cairns retorted that the girl in concealment
would never permit a real live man to miss her hiding place while
she possessed lungs to reveal it.</p>

<p>"There isn't," repeated Reggie, "a girl who has the nerve! Not
one!" He inspected them scornfully through the wrong end of the
megaphone. "Phony sports," he added. "No nerves and all fidgets.
Look at me; <em>I</em> don't want to get married; but I'm game
for an hour. There isn't a girl here to call my bluff!" And he
ventured to glance at Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"They've had a chance to look at you by daylight, Reggie, and
that is fatal," said Cairns. "Now, if they were only sure that
I'd discover 'em, or the god-like captain yonder, or the beautiful
Mr. Desboro&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to do it," said Helsa Steyr. "Marie, will you
draw lots to see who hides?"</p>

<p>"Why doesn't a man hide?" drawled Miss Ledyard. "I'm very sure
I could drag him to the altar in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Cairns had found a sheet of paper, torn it into slips, and written
down every woman's name, including Aunt Hannah's.</p>

<p>"She's retired to her room in disgust," said Jacqueline, laughing.</p>

<p>"Is <em>she</em> included?" faltered Reggie.</p>

<p>"You've brought it on yourself," said Cairns. "Are you going
to renig just because Aunt Hannah is a possible prize? Are you
really a tin sport?"</p>

<p>"No, by heck! Come on, Katharine!" to Miss Frere. "But Betty
Barkley can't figure in this, or there may be bigamy done."</p>

<p>"That makes it a better sporting proposition," said Betty coolly.
"I insist on figuring; Bertie can take his chances."</p>

<p>"Then I'm jingled if I don't play, too," said Barkley. "And I'm
not sure I'll hunt very hard if it's Betty who hides."</p>

<p>The pretty little woman turned up her nose at her husband and
sent a dazzling smile at Desboro.</p>

<p>"I'll whistle three times, like the daughter in the poem," she
said. "Please beat my husband to it."</p>

<p>Cairns waved the pool basket aloft: "Come ladies!" he cried.
"Somebody reach up and draw; and may heaven smile upon your wedding
day!"</p>

<p>Betty Barkley, standing on tip-toe, reached up, stirred the folded
ballots with tentative fingers, grasped one, drew it forth, and
flourished it.</p>

<p>"Goodness! How my heart really beats!" she said. "I don't know
whether I want to open it or not. I hadn't contemplated bigamy."</p>

<p>"If it's my name, I'm done for," said Katharine Frere calmly.
"I'm nearly six feet, and I can't conceal them all."</p>

<p>"Open it," said Athalie Vannis, with a shiver. "After all there's
the divorce court!" And she looked defiantly at Cairns.</p>

<p>Betty turned over the ballot between forefinger and thumb and
regarded it with dainty aversion.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "if I'm in for a scandal, I might as well know
it. Will you be kind to me, Jim, and not flirt with my maid?"</p>

<p>She opened the ballot, examined the name written there, turned
and passed it to Jacqueline, who flushed brightly as a delighted
shout greeted her.</p>

<p>"The question is," said Reggie Ledyard excitedly, "are you a
sport, Miss Nevers, or are you not? Kindly answer with appropriate
gestures."</p>

<p>The girl stood with her golden head drooping, staring at the
bit of paper in her hand; then, as Desboro watched her, she glanced
up with that sudden, reckless smile which he had seen once before&mdash;the
first day he met her&mdash;and made a gay little gesture of acceptance.</p>

<p>"You're not really going to do it, are you?" said Betty, incredulously.
"You don't have to; they're every one of them short sports themselves!"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> am not," said Jacqueline, smiling.</p>

<p>"But," argued Katharine Frere, "suppose Reggie should find you.
You'd never marry <em>him</em>, would you?"</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" shouted Ledyard. "She might have a worse fate.
There's Desboro!"</p>

<p>"You don't really mean it, do you, Miss Nevers?" asked Captain
Herrendene.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Jacqueline. "I always was a gambler by nature."</p>

<p>The tint of excitement was bright on her cheeks; she shot a daring
glance at Ledyard, looked at Van Alstyne and laughed, but her
back remained turned toward Desboro.</p>

<p>He said: "If the papers ever get wind of this they'll print it
as a serious item."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> perfectly serious," she said, looking coolly at
him over her shoulder. "If there is a man here clever enough to
find me, I'll marry him in a minute. But"&mdash;and she laughed in
Desboro's face&mdash;"there isn't. So nobody need really lose one moment
in anxiety. And if a girl finds me it's all off, of course. May
I have twenty minutes? And will you time me, Mr. Ledyard? And
will you all remain in this room with the door closed?"</p>

<p>"If nobody finds you," cried Cairns, as she crossed the threshold,
"we each forfeit whatever you ask of us?"</p>

<p>She paused at the door, looking back: "Is that understood?"</p>

<p>Everybody cried: "Yes! Certainly!"</p>

<p>She nodded and disappeared.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes they waited; then, as Reggie closed his watch,
a general stampede ensued. Amazed servants shrank aside as Cairns,
blowing fearful blasts on the megaphone, cheered on the excited
human pack; everywhere Desboro's cats and dogs fled before the
invasion; room after room was ransacked, maids routed, butler
and valet defied. Even Aunt Hannah's sanctuary was menaced until
that lady sat up on her bed and swore steadily at Ledyard, who
had scaled the transom.</p>

<p>Desboro, hunting by himself, entered the armoury, looked suspiciously
at the armoured figures, shook a few, opened the vizors of others,
and peered at the painted faces inside the helmets.</p>

<p>Others joined him, prying curiously, gathering in groups amid
the motionless army of mailed men. Then, as more than half of
the allotted hour had already expired, Ledyard suggested an attic
party, where trunks full of early XIXth century clothing might
be rifled with pleasing results.</p>

<p>"We may find her up there in a chest, like the celebrated bride,"
remarked Aunt Hannah, who had reappeared from her retreat. "It's
the lesser of several tragedies that might happen," she added
insolently, to Desboro.</p>

<p>"To the attic!" thundered Cairns through his megaphone; and they
started.</p>

<p>But Desboro still lingered at the armoury door, looking back.
The noise of the chase died away in the interior of the main house;
the armoury became very still under the flood of pale winter sunshine.</p>

<p>He glanced along the steel ranks of men-at-arms; he looked up
at the stately mounted figures; dazzling sunlight glittered over
helmet and cuirass and across the armoured flanks of horses.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that she was seated up there, hidden inside
some suit of blazing mail, astride a battle-horse?</p>

<p>Cautiously he came back, skirting the magnificent and motionless
ranks, hesitated and halted.</p>

<p>Of course the whole thing had been proposed and accepted in jest;
he told himself that. And yet&mdash;if some other man did discover
her&mdash;the foundation of the jest might serve for a more permanent
understanding. He didn't want her to have any intimate understanding
with anybody until he and she understood each other, and he understood
himself.</p>

<p>He didn't want another man to find and claim the forfeit, even
in jest, because he didn't know what might happen. No man was
ever qualified to foretell what another man might do; and men
already were behaving toward her with a persistency and seriousness
unmistakable&mdash;men like Herrendene, who meant what he looked and
said; and young Hammerton, Daisy's brother, eager, inexperienced
and susceptible; and Bertie Barkley, a little, hard-faced snob,
with an unerring instinct for anybody who promised to be popular
among desirable people, was beginning to test her metal with the
acid of his experience.</p>

<p>Desboro stood quite still, looking almost warily about him and
thinking faster and faster, trying to recollect who it was who
had dragged in the silly subject of marriage. That blond and hulking
ass Ledyard, wasn't it?</p>

<p>He began to walk, slowly passing the horsemen in review.</p>

<p>Suppose a blond animal like Reggie Ledyard offered himself in
earnest. Was she the kind of girl who would nail the worldly opportunity?
And Herrendene&mdash;that quiet, self-contained, keen-eyed man of forty-five.
You could never tell what Herrendene was thinking about anything,
or what he was capable of doing. And his admiration for Jacqueline
was undisguised, and his attentions frankly persistent. Last night,
too, when they were coasting under the new moon, there was half
an hour's disappearance for which neither Herrendene nor Jacqueline
had even pretended to account, though bantered and challenged&mdash;to
Desboro's vague discomfort. And the incident had left Desboro
a trifle cool toward her that morning; and she had pretended not
to be aware of the slight constraint between them, which made
him sulky.</p>

</div>
<p>He had reached the end of the double lane of horsemen. Now he
pivoted and retraced his steps, hands clasped behind his back,
absently scanning the men-at-arms, preoccupied with his own reflections.</p>

<p>How seriously had she taken the rôle she was playing somewhere
at that moment? Only fools accepted actual hazards when dared.
He himself was apt to be that kind of a fool. Was <em>she</em>?
Would she really have abided by the terms if discovered by Herrendene,
for example, or Dicky Hammerton&mdash;if they were mad enough to take
it seriously?</p>

<p>He thought of that sudden and delicious flash of recklessness
in her eyes. He had seen it twice now.</p>

<p>"By God!" he thought. "I believe she would! She is the sort that
sees a thing through to the bitter end."</p>

<p>He glanced up, startled, as though something, somewhere in the
vast, silent place, had moved. But he heard nothing, and there
was no movement anywhere among the armoured effigies.</p>

<p>Suppose she were here hidden somewhere within a hollow suit of
steel. She must be! Else why was he lingering? Why was he not
hunting her with the pack? And still, if she actually were here,
why was he not searching for her under every suit of sunlit mail?
Could it be because he did not really <em>want</em> to find her&mdash;with
this silly jest of marriage dragged in&mdash;a thing not to be mentioned
between her and him even in jest?</p>

<p>Was it that he had become convinced in his heart that she must
be here, and was he merely standing guard like a jealous, sullen
dog, watching lest some other fool come blundering back from a
false trail to discover the right one&mdash;and perhaps her?</p>

<p>Suddenly, without reason, he became certain that she and he were
there in the armoury alone together. He knew it somehow, felt
it, divined it in every quickening pulse beat.</p>

<p>He heard the preliminary click of the armoury clock, indicating
five minutes' grace before the hour struck. He looked up at the
old dial, where it was set against the wall&mdash;an ancient piece
in azure and gold under a foliated crest borne by some long dead
dignitary.</p>

<p>Four more minutes now. And suppose she should stir in her place,
setting her harness clashing? Had the thought of marrying him
ever entered her head? Was it in such a girl to challenge the
possibility, make it as near a serious question as it ever could
be? It had never existed for them, even as a question. It was
not a dead issue, because it had never lived. If she made one
movement now, if she so much as lifted her finger, this occult
thing would be alive. He knew it&mdash;knew that it lay with her; and
stood silent, unstirring, listening for the slightest sound. There
was no sound.</p>

<p>It lacked now only a minute to the hour. He looked at the face
of the lofty clock; and, looking, all in a moment it flashed upon
him where she was concealed.</p>

<p>Wheeling in his tracks, on the impulse of the moment he walked
straight back to the great painted wooden charger, sheathed in
steel and cloth of gold, bearing on high a slender, mounted figure
in full armour&mdash;the dainty Milanese mail Of the Countess of Oroposa.</p>

<p>The superb young figure sat its saddle, hollow backed, graceful,
both delicate gauntlets resting easily over the war-bridle on
the gem-set pommel. Sunbeams turned the long spurs to two golden
flames, and splintered into fire across the helmet's splendid
crest. He could not pierce the dusk behind the closed vizor; but
in every heart-beat, every nerve, he felt her living presence
within that hollow shell of inlaid steel and gold.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood staring up at her, then glanced mechanically
toward the high clock. Thirty seconds! Time to speak if he would;
time for her to move, if in her heart there ever had been the
thought which he had never uttered, never meant to voice. Twenty
seconds! Through that slitted vizor, also, the clock was in full
view. She could read the flight of time as well as he. Now she
must move&mdash;if ever she meant to challenge in him that to which
he never would respond.</p>

<p>He waited now, looking at the clock, now at the still figure
above him. Ten seconds! Five!</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!" he cried impulsively.</p>

<p>There was no movement, no answer from the slitted helmet.</p>

<p>"Jacqueline! Are you there?"</p>

<p>No sound.</p>

<p>Then the lofty gold and azure clock struck. And when the last
of the twelve resounding strokes rang echoing through the sunlit
armoury, the mailed figure stirred in its saddle, stretched both
stirrups, raised its arms and flexed them.</p>

<p>"You nearly caught me," she said calmly. "I was afraid you'd
see my eyes through the helmet slits. Was it your lack of enterprise
that saved me&mdash;or your prudence?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to you before the hour was up. It seems to me that I
<em>have</em> won."</p>

<p>"Not at all. You might just as well have stood in the cellar
and howled my name. That isn't discovering me, you know."</p>

<p>"I felt in my heart that you were there," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>She laughed. "What a man feels in his heart doesn't count. Do
you realise that I'm nearly dead sitting for an hour here? This
helmet is abominably hot! How in the world could that poor countess
have stood it?"</p>

<p>"Shall I climb up beside you and unlace your helmet?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. Mrs. Quant will get me out of it." She rose in
the stirrups, swung one steel-shod leg over, and leaped to the
floor beside him, clashing from crest to spur.</p>

<p>"What a silly game it was, anyway!" she commented, lifting her
vizor and lowering the beaver. Her face was deliciously flushed,
and the gold hair straggled across her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It's quite wonderful how the armour of the countess fits me,"
she said. "I wonder what she looked like. I'll wager, anyway,
that she never played as risky a game in her armour as I have
played this morning."</p>

<p>"You didn't really mean to abide by the decision, did you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Do you think I did?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>She smiled. "Perhaps you are correct. But I've always been afraid
I'd do something radical and irrevocable, and live out life in
misery to pay for it. Probably I wouldn't. I <em>must</em> take
off these gauntlets, anyway. Thank you"&mdash;as he relieved her of
them and tossed them under the feet of the wooden horse.</p>

<p>"Last Thursday," he said, "you fascinated everybody with your
lute and your Chinese robes. Heaven help the men when they see
you in armour! I'll perform my act of fealty now." And he lifted
her hands and kissed them lightly where the gauntlets had left
pink imprints on the smooth white skin.</p>

<p>As always when he touched her, she became silent; and, as always,
he seemed to divine the instant change in her to unresponsiveness
under physical contact. It was not resistance, it was a sort of
inertia&mdash;an endurance which seemed to stir in him a subtle brutality,
awaking depths which must not be troubled&mdash;unless he meant to
cut his cables once for all and drift headlong toward the rocks
of chance.</p>

<p>"You and Herrendene behaved shockingly last night," he said lightly.
"Where on earth did you go?"</p>

<p>"Is it to you that I must whisper 'je m'accuse'?" she asked smilingly.</p>

<p>"To whom if not to me, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;and what exactly then may be your status? Don't answer,"
she added, flushing scarlet. "I didn't mean to say that. Because
I know what is your status with me."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"You once made it clear to me, and I decided that your friendship
was worth everything to me&mdash;whatever you yourself might be."</p>

<p>"Whatever <em>I</em> might be?" he repeated, reddening.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are what you are&mdash;what you wrote me you were. I understood
you. But&mdash;do you notice that it has made any difference in my
friendship? Because it has not."</p>

<p>The dull colour deepened over his face. They were standing near
the closed door now; she laid one hand on the knob, then ventured
to raise her eyes.</p>

<p>"It has made no difference," she repeated. "Please don't think
it has."</p>

<p>His arms had imprisoned her waist; she dropped her head and her
hand slipped from the knob of the great oak door as he drew her
toward him.</p>

<p>"In armour!" she protested, trying to speak lightly, but avoiding
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Is that anything new?" he said. "You are always instantly in
armour when my lightest touch falls on you. Why?"</p>

<p>He lifted her drooping head until it rested against his arm.</p>

<p>"Isn't it anything at all to you when I kiss you?" he asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"Isn't it, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>But she only closed her eyes, and her lips remained coldly unresponsive
to his.</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "Can't you care for me at all&mdash;in this
way? Answer me!"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>care for you."</p>

<p>"<em>This</em> way?"</p>

<p>Over her closed lids a tremor passed, scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>"Don't you know how&mdash;how deeply <em>I&mdash;</em>care for you?" he
managed to say, feeling prudence and discretion violently tugging
at their cables. "Don't you <em>know</em> it, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I know you&mdash;care for me."</p>

<p>"Good God!" he said, trying to choke back the very words he uttered.
"Can't you respond&mdash;when you know I find you so adorable! When&mdash;when
you must know that I love you! Isn't there anything in you to
respond?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>care for you. If I did not, could I endure&mdash;what
you do?"</p>

<p>A sort of blind passion seized and possessed him; he kissed again
and again the fragrant, unresponsive lips. Presently she lifted
her head, loosened his clasp at her waist, stepped clear of the
circle of his arms.</p>

<p>"You see," she managed to say calmly, "that I do care for you.
So&mdash;may I go now?"</p>

<p>He opened the door for her and they moved slowly out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"You do not show that you care very much, Jacqueline."</p>

<p>"How can a girl show it more honestly? Could you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I have never stirred you to any tenderness&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>She moved beside him with head lowered, hands resting on her
plated hips, the bright hair in disorder across her cheeks. Presently
she said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I wish you could see into my heart."</p>

<p>"I wish I could! And I wish you could see into mine. That would
settle it one way or another!"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "because I <em>can</em> see into your heart.
And it settles nothing for me&mdash;except that I would like to&mdash;remain."</p>

<p>"Remain? Where?"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;in your heart."</p>

<p>He strove to speak coolly: "Then you <em>can</em> see into it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you know that you are there alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"And now that you have looked into it and know what is there,
do you care to remain in the heart of&mdash;of such a man as I am?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What you are <em>I&mdash;</em>forgive."</p>

<p>An outburst of merriment came from the library, and several figures
clad in the finery of the early nineteenth century came bustling
out into the hall.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Cheer after cheer rang through the hallway"]</p>

<p>Evidently his guests had rifled the chests and trunks in the
attic and had attired themselves to their heart's content. At
sight of Desboro approaching accompanied by a slim figure in complete
armour, they set up a shout of apprehension and then cheer after
cheer rang through the hallway.</p>

<p>"Do you know," cried Betty Barkley, "you are the most darling
thing in armour that ever happened! I want to get into some steel
trousers like yours immediately! Are there any in the armoury
that will fit me, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em> discover her?" demanded Reggie Ledyard, aghast.</p>

<p>"Not within the time limit, old chap," said Desboro, pretending
deep chagrin.</p>

<p>"Then you don't have to marry him, do you, Miss Nevers?" exclaimed
Cairns, gleefully.</p>

<p>"I don't have to marry anybody, Mr. Cairns. And <em>isn't</em>
it humiliating?" she returned, laughingly, edging her way toward
the stairs amid the noisy and admiring group surrounding her.</p>

<p>"No! No!" cried Katharine Frere. "You can't escape! You are too
lovely that way, and you certainly must come to lunch in your
armour!"</p>

<p>"I'd perish!" protested Jacqueline. "No Christian martyr was
ever more absolutely cooked than am I in this suit of mail."</p>

<p>Helsa Steyr started for her, but Jacqueline sprang to the stairs
and ran up, pursued by Helsa and Betty.</p>

<p>"<em>Isn't</em> she the cunningest, sweetest thing!" sighed Athalie
Vannis, looking after her. "I'm simply and sentimentally mad over
her. Why <em>didn't</em> you have brains enough to discover her,
Jim, and make her marry you?"</p>

<p>"I'd have knocked 'em out if he had had enough brains for that,"
muttered Ledyard. "But the horrible thing is that I haven't any
brains, either, and Miss Nevers has nothing but!"</p>

<p>"A girl like that marries diplomats and dukes, and discoverers
and artists and things," commented Betty. "You're just a good-looking
simp, Reggie. So is Jim."</p>

<p>Ledyard retorted wrathfully; Desboro, who had been summoned to
the telephone, glanced at Aunt Hannah as he walked away, and was
rather disturbed at the malice in the old lady's menacing smile.</p>

<p>But what Daisy Hammerton said to him over the telephone disturbed
him still more.</p>

<p>"Jim! Elena and Cary Clydesdale are stopping with us. May I bring
them to dinner this evening?"</p>

<p>For a moment he was at a loss, then he said, with forced cordiality:</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Daisy. But have you spoken to them about it?
I've an idea that they might find my party a bore."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Elena wished me to ask you to invite them. And Cary
was listening."</p>

<p>"Did <em>he</em> care to come?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He grinned. He always does what Elena asks him to do."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then bring them by all means."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jim."</p>

<p>And that was all; and Desboro, astonished and troubled for a
few moments, began to see in the incident not only the dawn of
an understanding between Clydesdale and his wife, but something
resembling a vindication for himself in this offer to renew a
friendship so abruptly terminated. More than that, he saw in it
a return of Elena to her senses, and it pleased him so much that
when he passed Aunt Hannah in the hall he was almost smiling.</p>

<p>"What pleases you so thoroughly, James&mdash;yourself?" she asked
grimly.</p>

<p>But he only smiled at her and sauntered on, exchanging friendly
body-blows with Reggie Ledyard as he passed.</p>

<p>"Reggie," said Mrs. Hammerton, with misleading mildness, "come
and exercise me for a few moments&mdash;there's a dear." And she linked
arms with him and began to march up and down the hall vigorously.</p>

<p>"She's very charming, isn't she?" observed Aunt Hannah blandly.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>"She's a dream," said Reggie, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Such a thoroughbred air," commented the old lady.</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;she's only a shop-keeper."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that Miss Nevers keeps an antique shop?"</p>

<p>"What of it?" he said, turning red. "I peddle stocks. My grandfather
made snuff. What do I care what Miss Nevers does?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Only&mdash;would <em>you</em> marry her?"</p>

<p>"Huh! Like a shot! But I see her letting me! Once I was even
ass enough to think I could kiss her, but it seems she won't even
stand for that! And Herrendene makes me sick&mdash;the old owl&mdash;sneaking
off with her whenever he can get the chance! They all make me
sick!" he added, lighting a cigarette. "I wish to goodness I had
a teaspoonful of intellect, and I'd give 'em a run for her. Because
I have the looks, if I do say it," he added, modestly.</p>

<p>"Looks never counted seriously with a woman yet," said Mrs. Hammerton
maliciously. "Also, I've seen better looking coachmen than you."</p>

<p>"Thanks. What are you going to do with her anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't have to do anything. She'll do whatever is necessary."</p>

<p>"That's right, too. Lord, but she'll cut a swathe! Even that
dissipated creature Cairns sits up and takes notice. I should
think Desboro would, too&mdash;more than he does."</p>

<p>"I understand there's a girl in blue, somewhere," observed Mrs.
Hammerton.</p>

<p>"That's a different kind of girl," said the young man, with contempt,
and quite oblivious to his own naïve self-revelation. Mrs. Hammerton
shrugged her trim shoulders.</p>

<p>"Also," he said, "there is Elena Clydesdale&mdash;speaking of scandal
and James Desboro in the same breath."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that story?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But that sort of affair never counts seriously with a man
who wants to marry."</p>

<p>"Really? How charming! But perhaps it might count against him
with the girl he wants to marry. Young girls are sometimes fastidious,
you know."</p>

<p>"They never hear about such things until somebody tells 'em,
after they're married. Then it's rather too late to throw any
pre-nuptial fits," he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Reginald," said Mrs. Hammerton, "day by day I am humbly learning
how to appreciate the innate delicacy, chivalry, and honourable
sentiments of your sex. You yourself are a wonderful example.
For instance, when rumour couples Elena Clydesdale's name with
James Desboro's, does it occur to you to question the scandal?
No; you take it for granted, and very kindly explain to me how
easily Mrs. Clydesdale can be thrown over if her alleged lover
decides he'd like to marry somebody."</p>

<p>"That's what's done," he said sulkily. "When a man&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You don't have to tell <em>me</em>!" she fairly hissed, turning
on him so suddenly that he almost fell backward. "Don't you think
I know what is the code among your sort&mdash;among the species of
men you find sympathetic? You and Jack Cairns and James Desboro&mdash;and
Cary Clydesdale, too? Let him reproach himself if his wife misbehaves!
And I don't blame her if she does, and I don't believe she does!
Do you hear me, you yellow-haired, blue-eyed little beast?"</p>

<p>Ledyard stood open-mouthed, red to the roots of his blond hair,
and the tiny, baleful black eyes of Mrs. Hammerton seemed to hypnotise
him.</p>

<p>"You're all alike," she said with withering contempt. "Real men
are out in the world, doing things, not crawling around over the
carpet under foot, or sitting in clubs, or dancing with a pack
of women, or idling from polo field to tennis court, from stable
to steam-yacht. You've no real blood in you; it's only Scotch
and soda gone flat. You've the passions of overfed lap dogs with
atrophied appetites. There's not a real man here&mdash;except Captain
Herrendene&mdash;and he's going back to his post in a week. You others
have no posts. And do you think that men of your sort are fitted
to talk about marrying such a girl as Miss Nevers? Let me catch
one of you trying it! She's in my charge. But that doesn't count.
She'll recognise a real man when she sees one, and glittering
counterfeits won't attract her."</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" faltered Reggie. "What a horrible lambasting!
I &mdash;I've heard you could do it; but this is going some&mdash;really,
you know, it's going some! And I'm not all those things that you
say, either!" he added, in naïve resentment. "I may be no good,
but I'm not as rotten as all that."</p>

<p>He stood with lips pursed up into a half-angry, half-injured
pout, like a big, blond, blue-eyed yokel facing school-room punishment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammerton's harsh face relaxed; and finally a smile wrinkled
her eyes.</p>

<p>"I suppose men can't help being what they are&mdash;a mixture of precocious
child and trained beast. The best of 'em have both of these in
'em. And you are far from the best. Reggie, come here to me!"</p>

<p>He came, after a moment's hesitation, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Lord!" she said. "How we cherish the worst of you! I sometimes
think we don't know enough to appreciate the best. Otherwise,
perhaps they'd give us more of their society. But, generally,
all we draw is your sort; and we cast our nets in vain into the
real world&mdash;where Captain Herrendene is going on Monday. Reggie,
dear?"</p>

<p>"What?" he said suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Was I severe with you and your friends?"</p>

<p>"Great heavens! There isn't another woman I'd take such a drubbing
from!"</p>

<p>"But you <em>do</em> take it," she said, with one of her rare
and generous smiles which few people ever saw, and of which few
could believe her facially capable.</p>

<p>And she slipped her arm through his and led him slowly toward
the library where already Farris was announcing luncheon.</p>

<p>"By heck!" he repeated later, in the billiard room, to a group
of interested listeners. "Aunt Hannah is all that they say she
is. She suddenly let out into me, and I give y'm'word she had
me over the ropes in one punch&mdash;tellin' me what beasts men are&mdash;and
how we're not fit to associate with nice girls&mdash;no b'jinks&mdash;nor
fit to marry 'em, either."</p>

<p>Cairns laughed unfeelingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can laugh!" muttered Ledyard. "But to be lit into that
way hurts a man's self-respect. You'd better be careful or you'll
be in for a dose of Aunt Hannah, too. She evidently has no use
for any of us&mdash;barrin' the Captain, perhaps."</p>

<p>That gentleman smiled and picked up his hockey stick.</p>

<p>"There's enough ice left&mdash;if you don't mind a wetting," he said.
"Shall we start?"</p>

<p>Desboro rose, saying carelessly: "The Hammertons and Clydesdales
are coming over. I'll have to wait for them."</p>

<p>Bertie Barkley turned his hard little smooth-shaven face toward
him.</p>

<p>"Where are the Clydesdales?"</p>

<p>"I believe they're stopping with the Hammertons for a week or
two &mdash;I really don't know. You can ask them, as they'll be
here to dinner."</p>

<p>Cairns laid aside a cue with which he had been punching pool-balls;
Van Alstyne unhooked his skate-bag, and the others followed his
example in silence. Nobody said anything further about the Clydesdales
to Desboro.</p>

<p>Out in the hall a gay group of young girls in their skating skirts
were gathering, among them Jacqueline, now under the spell of
happiness in their companionship.</p>

<p>Truly, even in these few days, the "warm sunlight of approval"
had done wonders for her. She had blossomed out deliriously and
exquisitely in her half-shy friendships with these young girls,
responding diffidently at first to their overtures, then frankly
and with a charming self-possession based on the confidence that
she was really quite all right if everybody only thought so.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to think so; Athalie Vannis's friendship for
her verged on the sentimental, for the young girl was enraptured
at the idea that Jacqueline actually earned her own living. Marie
Ledyard lazily admired and envied her slight but exceedingly fashionable
figure; Helsa Steyr passionately adored her; Katharine Frere was
profoundly impressed by her intellectual attainments; Betty Barkley
saw in her a social success, with Aunt Hannah to pilot her&mdash;that
is, every opportunity for wealth or position, or even both, through
the marriage to which, Betty cheerfully conceded, her beauty entitled
her.</p>

<p>So everybody of her own sex was exceedingly nice to her; and
the men already were only too anxious to be. And what more could
a young girl want?</p>

<p>As the jolly party started out across the snow, in random and
chattering groups made up by hazard, Jacqueline turned from Captain
Herrendene, with whom she found herself walking, and looked back
at Desboro, who had remained standing bareheaded on the steps.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming?" she called out to him, in her clear young
voice.</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"Please excuse me a moment," she murmured to Herrendene, and
ran back along the middle drive. Desboro started forward to meet
her at the same moment, and they met under the dripping spruces.</p>

<p>"Why aren't you coming with us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can't very well. I have to wait here for some people who might
arrive early."</p>

<p>"You are going to remain here all alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, until they come. You see they are dining here, and I can't
let them arrive and find the house empty."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to stay with you? Mrs. Hammerton is in her room,
and it would be perfectly proper."</p>

<p>He said, reddening with surprise and pleasure: "It's very sweet
of you. <em>I&mdash;</em>had no idea you'd offer to do such a thing&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? Besides, I'd rather be where you are than anywhere
else."</p>

<p>"With <em>me</em>, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Are you really surprised to hear me admit it?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Why, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Because you never before have been demonstrative, even in speech."</p>

<p>She blushed: "Not as demonstrative as you are. But you know that
I might learn to be."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously, but with more or less self-control.</p>

<p>"Do you really care for me that way, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"I know of no way in which I don't care for you," she said quickly.</p>

<p>"Does your caring for me amount to&mdash;love?" he asked deliberately.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think so&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The emotion in his face was now palely reflected in hers; their
voices were no longer quite steady under the sudden strain of
self-repression.</p>

<p>"Say it, Jacqueline, if it is true," he whispered. His face was
tense and white, but not as pale as hers. "Say it!" he whispered
again.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;in words. But it is true&mdash;what you asked me."</p>

<p>"That you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought you knew it long ago."</p>

<p>They stood very still, facing each other, breathing more rapidly.
Her fate was upon her, and she knew it.</p>

<p>Captain Herrendene, who had waited, watched them for a moment
more, then, lighting a cigarette, sauntered on carelessly, swinging
his hockey-stick in circles.</p>

<p>Desboro said in a low, distinct voice, and without a tremor:
"I am more in love with you than ever, Jacqueline. But that is
as much as I shall ever say to you&mdash;nothing more than that."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you do. Shall I leave you in peace? It can still
be done. Or&mdash;shall I tell you again that I love you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you wish, tell me&mdash;that."</p>

<p>"Is love <em>enough</em> for you, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Ask yourself, Jim. With what you give I must be content&mdash;or
starve."</p>

<p>"Do you realise&mdash;what it means for us?" He could scarcely speak
now.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I know." She turned and looked back. Herrendene was
now a long way off, walking slowly and alone. Then she turned
once more to Desboro, absently, as though absorbed in her own
reflections. Herrendene had asked her to marry him that morning.
She was thinking of it now.</p>

<p>Then, in her remote gaze the brief dream faded, her eyes cleared,
and she looked up at the silent man beside her.</p>

<p>"Shall I remain here with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>He made an effort to speak, but his voice was no longer under
command. She waited, watching him; then they both turned and slowly
entered the house together. Her hand had fallen into his, and
when they reached the library he lifted it to his lips and noticed
that her fingers were trembling. He laid his other hand over them,
as though to quiet the tremor; and looked into her face and saw
how colourless it had become.</p>

<p>"My darling!" But the time had not yet come when he could tolerate
his own words; contempt for them choked him for a moment, and
he only took her into his arms in silence.</p>

<p>She strove to think, to speak, to master her emotion; but for
a moment his mounting passion subdued her and she remained silent,
quivering in his embrace.</p>

<p>Then, with an effort, she found her voice and loosened his arms.</p>

<p>"Listen," she whispered. "You must listen. I know what you are&mdash;how
you love me. But you are wrong! If I could only make you see it!
If you would not think me selfish, self-seeking&mdash;believe unworthy
motives of me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, suddenly chilled.</p>

<p>"I mean that I am worth more to you than&mdash;than to be&mdash;what you
wish me to be to you. You won't misunderstand, will you? I am
not bargaining, not begging, not trading. I love you! I couldn't
bargain; I could only take your terms&mdash;or leave them. And I have
not decided. But&mdash;may I say something&mdash;for your sake more than
for my own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, coolly.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;for your sake&mdash;far more than for mine&mdash;if you do really
love me&mdash;make more of me than you have thought of doing! I know
I shall be worth it to you. Could you consider it?"</p>

<p>After a terrible silence, he said: "I can&mdash;get out of your life&mdash;dog
that I am! I can leave you in peace. And that is all."</p>

<p>"If that is all you can do&mdash;don't leave me&mdash;in peace. I &mdash;I
will take the chances of remaining&mdash;honest&#11834;"</p>

<p>The hint of fear in her eyes and in her voice startled him.</p>

<p>"There is a martyrdom," she said, "which I might not be able
to endure forever. I don't know. I shall never love another man.
And all my life I have wanted love. It is here; and I may not
be brave enough to deny it and live my life out in ignorance of
it. But, Jim, if you only could understand&mdash;if you only knew what
I can be to you&mdash;to the world for your sake&mdash;what I can become
merely because I love you&mdash;what I am capable of for the sake of
your pride in&mdash;in me&mdash;and&#11834;" She turned very white. "Because
it is better for your sake, Jim. I am not thinking of myself,
and how wonderful it would be for me&mdash;truly I am not. Don't you
believe me? Only&mdash;there is so much to me &mdash;I am really so
much of a woman&mdash;that it would begin to trouble you if ever I
became anything&mdash;anything less than your&mdash;wife. And you would
feel sorry for me&mdash;and I couldn't truthfully console you because
all the while I'd know in my heart what you had thrown away that
might have belonged to us both."</p>

<p>"Your life?" he said, with dry lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim! I mean more than your life and mine! For our lives&mdash;yours
and mine&mdash;would not be all you would throw away and deny. Before
we die we would want children. Ought I not to say it?" She turned
away, blind with tears, and dropped onto the sofa. "I'm wondering
if I'm in my right mind," she sobbed, "for yesterday I did not
even dare think of these things I am saying to you now! But&mdash;somehow&mdash;even
while Captain Herrendene was speaking&mdash;it all flashed into my
mind. I don't know how I knew it, but I suddenly understood that
you belonged to me&mdash;just as you are, Jim&mdash;all the good, all the
evil in you&mdash;everything&mdash;even your intentions toward me&mdash;how you
may deal with me&mdash;all, all belonged to me! And so I went back
to you, to help you. And now I have said this thing&mdash;for your
sake alone, not for my own&mdash;only so that in years to come you
may not have me on your conscience. For if you do not marry me&mdash;and
I let myself really love you&mdash;you will wish that the beginning
was to be begun again, and that we had loved each other&mdash;otherwise."</p>

<p>He came over and stood looking down at her for a moment. His
lips were twitching.</p>

<p>"Would you marry me now," he managed to say, "<em>now</em>, after
you know what a contemptible cad I am?"</p>

<p>"You are only a man. I love you, Jim. I will marry you&mdash;if you'll
let me&#11834;"</p>

<p>Suddenly she covered her eyes with her hands. He seated himself
beside her, sick with self-contempt, dumb, not daring to touch
her where she crouched, trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>For a long while they remained so, in utter silence; then the
doorbell startled them. Jacqueline fled to her room; Desboro composed
himself with a desperate effort and went out into the hall.</p>

<p>He welcomed his guests on the steps when Farris opened the door,
outwardly master of himself once more.</p>

<p>"We came over early, Jim," explained Daisy, "because Uncle John
is giving a dinner and father and mother need the car. Do you
mind?"</p>

<p>He laughed and shook hands with her and Elena, who looked intently
and unsmilingly into his face, and then let her expressionless
glance linger for a moment on her husband, who was holding out
a huge hand to Desboro.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, Clydesdale," said Desboro pleasantly, and
took that bulky gentleman's outstretched hand, who mumbled something
incoherent; but the fixed grin remained. And that was the discomforting&mdash;yes,
the dismaying&mdash;characteristic of the man&mdash;his grin never seemed
to be affected by his emotions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quant bobbed away upstairs, piloting Daisy and Elena. Clydesdale
followed Desboro to the library&mdash;the same room where he had discovered
his wife that evening, and had learned in what esteem she held
the law that bound her to him. Both men thought of it now&mdash;could
not avoid remembering it. Also, by accident, they were seated
very nearly as they had been seated that night, Clydesdale filling
the armchair with his massive figure, Desboro sitting on the edge
of the table, one foot resting on the floor.</p>

<p>Farris brought whiskey; both men shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Will you have a cigar, Clydesdale?" asked the younger man.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>They smoked in silence for a few moments, then:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came," said Desboro simply.</p>

<p>"Yes. Men don't usually raise that sort of hell with each other
unless a woman starts it."</p>

<p>"Don't talk that way about your wife," said Desboro sharply.</p>

<p>"See here, young man, I have no illusions concerning my wife.
What happened here was her doing, not yours. I knew it at the
time&mdash;if I didn't admit it. You behaved well&mdash;and you've behaved
well ever since&mdash;only it hurt me too much to tell you so before
to-day."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Clydesdale&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is going to be all right now, I guess." A curious expression
flitted across his red features, softening the grin for a moment.
"I always liked you, Desboro; and Elena and I were staying with
the Hammertons, so she told that Daisy girl to ask you to invite
us. That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>"Good business!" said Desboro, smiling. "I'm glad it's all clear
between us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's clear sailing now, I guess." Again the curiously softening
expression made his heavy red features almost attractive, and
he remained silent for a while, occupied with thoughts that seemed
to be pleasant ones.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly emerging from his revery, he grinned at Desboro:</p>

<p>"So Mrs. Hammerton has our pretty friend Miss Nevers in tow,"
he said. "Fine girl, Desboro. She's been at my collection, you
know, fixing it up for the hammer."</p>

<p>"So you are really going to sell?" inquired Desboro.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I <em>was</em> going to. But I'm taking a new
interest in my hobby since&#11834;" he reddened, then added very simply,
"since Elena and I have been getting on better together."</p>

<p>"Sure," nodded Desboro, gravely understanding him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it's about like that, Desboro. Things were rotten bad up
to that night. And afterward, too, for a while. They're clearing
up a little better, I think. We're going to get on together, I
believe. I don't know much about women; never liked 'em much&mdash;except
Elena. It's funny about Miss Nevers, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hammerton's being so crazy about her. She's a good girl,
and a pretty one. Elena is wild to meet her."</p>

<p>"Didn't your wife ever meet her at your house?" asked Desboro
dryly.</p>

<p>"When she was there appraising my jim-cracks? No. Elena has no
use for my gallery or anybody who goes into it. Besides, until
this morning she didn't even know that Miss Nevers was the same
expert you employed. Now she wants to meet her."</p>

<p>Desboro slowly raised his eyes and looked at Clydesdale. The
unvaried grin baffled him, and presently he glanced elsewhere.</p>

<p>Clydesdale, smoking, slowly crossed one ponderous leg over the
other. Desboro continued to gaze out of the window. Neither spoke
again until Daisy Hammerton came in with Elena. If the young wife
remembered the somewhat lurid circumstances of her last appearance
in that room, her animated and smiling face betrayed no indication
of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"When is that gay company of yours going to return, Jim?" she
demanded. "I am devoured by curiosity to meet this beautiful Miss
Nevers. Fancy her coming to my house half a dozen times this winter
and I never suspecting that my husband's porcelain gallery concealed
such a combination of genius and beauty! I could have bitten somebody's
head off in vexation," she rattled on, "when I found out who she
was. So I made Daisy ask you to invite us to meet her. <em>Is</em>
she so unusually wonderful, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," he said drily.</p>

<p>"They say every man who meets her falls in love with her immediately&mdash;and
that most of the women do, too," appealing to Daisy, who nodded
smiling corroboration.</p>

<p>"She is very lovely and very clever, Elena. I think I never saw
anything more charming than that rainbow dance she did for us
last night in Chinese costume," turning to Desboro, "'The Rainbow
Skirt,' I think it is called?"</p>

<p>"A dance some centuries old," said Desboro, and let his careless
glance rest on Elena for a moment.</p>

<p>"She looked," said Daisy, "like some exquisite Chinese figure
made of rose-quartz, crystal and green jade."</p>

<p>"Jade?" said Clydesdale, immediately interested. "That girl knows
jades, I can tell you. By gad! The first thing she did when she
walked into my gallery was to saw into a few glass ones with a
file; and good-night to about a thousand dollars in Japanese phony!"</p>

<p>"That was pleasant," said Desboro, laughing.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it! And my rose-quartz Fêng-huang! The Chia-Ching period
of the Ming dynasty! Do you get me, Desboro? It was Jap!"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Clydesdale brought down his huge fist with a thump on the table:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe it! I told Miss Nevers she didn't know her
business! I asked her to consider the fact that the crystallisation
was rhombohedral, the prisms six-sided, hardness 7, specific gravity
2.6, no trace of cleavage, immune to the three acids or the blow-pipe
alone, and reacted with soda in the flame. I thought I knew it
all, you see. First she called my attention to the colour. 'Sure,'
I said, 'it's a little faded; but rose-quartz fades when exposed
to light!' 'Yes,' said she, 'but moisture restores it.' So we
tried it. Nix doing! Only a faint rusty stain becoming visible
and infecting that delicious rose colour. 'Help!' said I. 'What
the devil is it?' 'Jap funny business,' said she. 'Your rose-quartz
phoenix of the Ming dynasty is common yellow crystal carved in
Japan and dyed that beautiful rose tint with something, the composition
of which my chemist is investigating!' Wasn't it horrible, Desboro?"</p>

<p>Daisy's brown eyes were very wide open, and she exclaimed softly:</p>

<p>"What a beautiful knowledge she has of a beautiful profession!"
And to Desboro: "Can you imagine anything in the world more fascinating
than to use such knowledge? And how in the world did she acquire
it? She is so very young to know so much!"</p>

<p>"Her father began her training as a child," said Desboro. There
was a slight burning sensation in his face, and a hotter pride
within him. After a second or two he felt Elena's gaze; but did
not choose to encounter it at the moment, and was turning to speak
to Daisy Hammerton when Jacqueline entered the library.</p>

<p>Clydesdale lumbered to his feet and tramped over to shake hands
with her; Daisy greeted her cordially; she and Elena were presented,
and stood smiling at each other for a second's silence. Then Mrs.
Clydesdale moved a single step forward, and Jacqueline crossed
to her and offered her hand, looking straight into her eyes so
frankly and intently that Elena's colour rose and for once in
her life her tongue remained silent.</p>

<p>"Your husband and I are already business acquaintances," said
Jacqueline. "I know your very beautiful gallery, too, and have
had the privilege of identifying and classifying many of the jades
and porcelains."</p>

<p>Elena's eyes were level and cool as she said: "If I had known
who you were I would have received you myself. You must not think
me rude. Mr. Desboro's unnecessary reticence concerning you is
to blame; not I."</p>

<p>Jacqueline's smile became mechanical: "Mr. Desboro's reticence
concerning a business acquaintance was very natural. A busy woman
neither expects nor even thinks about social amenities under business
circumstances."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Business is kinder to men than women sometimes
believe'"]</p>

<p>Elena's flush deepened: "Business is kinder to men than women
sometimes believe&mdash;if it permits acquaintance with such delightful
people as yourself."</p>

<p>Jacqueline said calmly: "All business has its compensations,"&mdash;she
smiled and made a friendly little salute with her head to Clydesdale
and Desboro,&mdash;"as you will witness for me. And I am employed by
other clients who also are considerate and kind. So you see the
woman who works has scarcely any time to suffer from social isolation."</p>

<p>Daisy said lightly: "Nobody who is happily employed worries over
social matters. Intelligence and sweet temper bring more friends
than a busy girl knows what to do with. Isn't that so, Miss Nevers?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline turned to Elena with a little laugh: "It's an axiom
that nobody can have too many friends. I want all I can have,
Mrs. Clydesdale, and am most grateful when people like me."</p>

<p>"And when they don't," asked Elena, smiling, "what do you do
then, Miss Nevers?"</p>

<p>"What is there to do, Mrs. Clydesdale?" she said gaily. "What
would you do about it?"</p>

<p>But Elena seemed not to have heard her, for she was already turning
to Desboro, flushed, almost feverish in her animation:</p>

<p>"So many things have happened since I saw you, Jim&#11834;" she hesitated,
then added daringly, "at the opera. Do you remember <em>Ariane</em>?"</p>

<p>"I think you were in the Barkley's box," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"Your memory is marvellous! In point of fact, I was there. And
since then so many, many things have happened that I'd like to
compare notes with you&mdash;sometime."</p>

<p>"I'm quite ready now," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you think your daily record fit for public scrutiny, Jim?"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't mind sharing it with anybody here," he retorted gaily,
"if you have no objection."</p>

<p>His voice and hers, and their laughter seemed so perfectly frank
that thrust and parry passed as without significance. She and
Desboro were still lightly rallying each other; Clydesdale was
explaining to Daisy that lapis lazuli was the sapphire of the
ancients, while Jacqueline was showing her a bit under a magnifying
glass, when the noise of sleighs and motors outside signalled
the return of the skating party.</p>

<p>As Desboro passed her, Elena said under her breath: "I want a
moment alone with you this evening."</p>

<p>"It's impossible," he motioned with his lips; and passed on with
a smile of welcome for his returning guests.</p>

<p>Later, in the billiard room, where they all had gathered before
the impromptu dance which usually terminated the evening, Elena
found another chance for a word aside: "Jim, I must speak to you
alone, please."</p>

<p>"It can't be done. You see that for yourself, don't you?"</p>

<p>"It can be done. Go to your room and I'll come&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Almost. I tell you you'd better find some way&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>"I mean to have <em>you</em> tell <em>me</em>, Jim."</p>

<p>A dull flush came into his face: "Oh! Well, I'll tell you now,
if you like."</p>

<p>Her heart seemed to stop for a second, then almost suffocated
her, and she instinctively put her hand to her throat.</p>

<p>He was leaning over the pool table, idly spinning the ivory balls;
she, seated on the edge, one pretty, bare arm propping her body,
appeared to be watching him as idly. All around them rang the
laughter and animated chatter of his guests, sipping their after-dinner
coffee and cordial around the huge fireplace.</p>

<p>"Don't say&mdash;that you are going to &mdash;Jim&#11834;" she breathed.
"It isn't true&mdash;it mustn't be&#11834;"</p>

<p>He interrupted deliberately: "What are you trying to do to me?
Make a servant out of me? Chain me up while you pass your life
deciding at leisure whether to live with your husband or involve
yourself and me in scandal?"</p>

<p>"Are you in love with that girl&mdash;after what you have promised
me?"</p>

<p>"Are you sane or crazy?"</p>

<p>"You once told me you would never marry. I have rested secure
in the knowledge that when the inevitable crash came you would
be free to stand by me!"</p>

<p>"You have a perfectly good husband. You and he are on better
terms&mdash;you are getting on all right together. Do you expect to
keep me tied to the table-leg in case of eventualities?" he said,
in a savage whisper. "How many men do you wish to control?"</p>

<p>"One! I thought a Desboro never lied."</p>

<p>"Have I lied to you?"</p>

<p>"If you marry Miss Nevers you will have lied to me, Jim."</p>

<p>"Very well. Then you'll release me from that fool of a promise.
I remember I did say that I would never marry. I've changed my
mind, that's all. I've changed otherwise, too&mdash;please God! The
cad you knew as James Desboro is not exactly what you're looking
at now. It's in me to be something remotely resembling a man.
I learned how to try from her, if you want to know. What I was
can't be helped. What I'm to make of the débris of what I am concerns
myself. If you ever had a shred of real liking for me you'll show
it now."</p>

<p>"Jim! Is this how you betray me&mdash;after persuading me to continue
a shameful and ghastly farce with Cary Clydesdale! You <em>have</em>
betrayed me&mdash;for your own ends! You have made my life a living
lie again&mdash;so that you could evade responsibility&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Was I ever responsible for you?"</p>

<p>"You asked me to marry you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Before you married Cary. Good God! Does that entail hard labour
for life?"</p>

<p>"You promised not to marry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What is it to you what I do&mdash;if you treat your husband decently?"</p>

<p>"I have tried&#11834;" She crimsoned. "I &mdash;I endured degradation
to which I will never again submit&mdash;whatever the law may be&mdash;whatever
marriage is supposed to include! Do you think you can force me
to&mdash;to that&mdash;for your own selfish ends&mdash;with your silly and unsolicited
advice on domesticity and&mdash;and children&mdash;when my heart is elsewhere&mdash;when
you have it, and you know you possess it&mdash;and all that I am&mdash;every
bit of me. Jim! Don't be cruel to me who have been trying to live
as you wished, merely to satisfy a moral notion of your own! Don't
betray me now&mdash;at such a time&mdash;when it's a matter of days, hours,
before I tell Cary that the farce is ended. Are you going to leave
me to face things alone? You can't! I won't let you! I am&#11834;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Be careful,' he said.... 'People are watching
us'"]</p>

<p>"Be careful," he said, spinning the 13 ball into a pocket. "People
are watching us. Toss that cue-ball back to me, please. Laugh
a little when you do it."</p>

<p>For a second she balanced the white ivory ball in a hand which
matched it; then the mad impulse to dash it into his smiling face
passed with a shudder, and she laughed and sent it caroming swiftly
from cushion to cushion, until it darted into his hand.</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, "you are not really serious. I know it, too;
and because I do know it, I have been able to endure the things
you have done&mdash;your idle fancies for a pretty face and figure&mdash;your
indiscretions, ephemeral courtships, passing inclinations. But
this is different&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is different," he said. "And so am I, Elena. Let us
be about the honest business of life, in God's name, and clear
our hearts and souls of the morbid and unwholesome mess that lately
entangled us."</p>

<p>"Is <em>that</em> how you speak of what we have been to each
other?" she asked, very pale.</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"Jim, dear," she said timidly, "won't you give me ten minutes
alone with you?"</p>

<p>He scarcely heard her. He spun the last parti-coloured ball into
a corner pocket, straightened his shoulders, and looked at Jacqueline
where she sat in the corner of the fireplace. Herrendene, cross-legged
on the rug at her feet, was doing Malay card tricks to amuse her;
but from moment to moment her blue eyes stole across the room
toward Desboro and Mrs. Clydesdale where they leaned together
over the distant pool table. Suddenly she caught his eye and smiled
a pale response to the message in his gaze.</p>

<p>After a moment he said quietly to Elena: "I am deeply and reverently
in love&mdash;for the first and only time in my life. It is proper
that you should know it. And now you do know it. There is absolutely
nothing further to be said between us."</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;more than you think," she whispered, white to the
lips.</p>
