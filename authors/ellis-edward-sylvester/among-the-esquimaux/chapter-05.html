<p>By this time the sailor felt that he had forgotten himself in
the agitation caused by the loss of the boat. Although he might
see the dark future with clearer vision than his young friends,
it was his duty to keep their sight veiled as long as he could.
Time enough to face the terrors and their direful consequences
when the possibility of avoiding them no longer existed.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that when the little party stepped out from
the small boat upon the iceberg they did so on the side farthest
from the "Nautilus," so that all view of the ship was shut off,
and neither Captain McAlpine nor any of his crew could observe
the action of Jack and the boys.</p>

<p>The skipper had warrant for supposing that such an experienced
sailor as the one in charge of the lads would be quick to notice
the threatening change in the weather, and would make all haste
to return. Inasmuch as he had failed to do so, the party must
be left to themselves for the time, while the commander gave his
full attention to the care of the ship&mdash;a responsibility that
required his utmost skill, with no slight chance of his failure.</p>

<p>The storm or squall, or whatever it might be termed, was one
of those sudden changes, sometimes seen in the high latitudes,
whose coming is so sudden that there is but the briefest warning
ere it bursts in all its fury.</p>

<p>By the time our friends reached the spot where they expected
to find their boat it was almost as dark as night. This darkness
deepened so rapidly, after losing sight of the craft, that they
were unable to see more than fifty feet in any direction. Fortunately,
before leaving the "Nautilus," they had donned their heaviest
clothing, so that they were quite well protected under the circumstances.
Had they neglected this precaution they must have perished of
the extreme cold that followed.</p>

<p>Accompanying the oppressive gloom was a marked falling of the
temperature, and a fierceness of blast which, so long as they
were exposed to it, cut them to the bone. The gale, instead of
blowing in their faces, swept along the side of the iceberg. They
had but to withdraw, therefore, only a short distance when they
were able to take shelter behind some of the numerous projections,
and save themselves from its full force.</p>

<p>All at once the air was full of millions of particles of snow,
which eddied and whirled in such fantastic fashion that when they
crouched down they were so blinded that they could not see each
other's forms, although near enough to clasp hands.</p>

<p>This lasted but a few minutes, when it ceased as suddenly as
it began. The air was clear, but the gloom was profound. They
could see nothing of the raging ocean, nor of a tall spire-like
mass of ice, which towered a hundred feet above their heads, within
a few yards of them, and which had attracted their admiration
on their first visit.</p>

<p>It was blowing great guns. The sound of the waves, as they broke
against the solid abutment of ice, and were dashed into spray
and spume, was like that of the breakers in a hurricane. Inconceivable
as was the bulk of the berg, they plainly felt it yield to the
resistless power of the ocean. It acquired a slow sea-saw motion,
more alarming than the most violent disturbance they had ever
known on the "Nautilus" in a storm. The movement was slight, but
too distinct to be mistaken.</p>

<p>For some time the three huddled together, under the protection
of the friendly projection, and no one spoke a word. They had
laid down their guns, for there was no need of keeping them in
their hands. The metal was so intensely cold that it could be
noted through the protection of their thick mittens, and they
needed every atom of vitality in their shivering bodies. They
pressed closer together and found comfort in the mutual warmth
thus secured.</p>

<p>The sky was blackness itself. There was no glimpse of moon or
friendly star. They were adrift on an iceberg in darkness and
gloom in the midst of a trackless ocean. Whither they were going,
when the terrifying voyage should end, what was to be the issue,
only One knew. They could but pray and trust and hope and await
the end.</p>

<p>It is a curious feature of this curious human nature of ours
that the most hopeless depression of spirits is frequently followed
by a rebound, as the highest spirits are quickly succeeded by
the deepest dejection. Our make-up is such that nature reacts,
and neither state can continue long without change, unless the
conditions are exceptional. Were it otherwise, many a strong mind
would break down under its weight of trouble.</p>

<p>The three had remained crouching together silent and motionless
for some minutes, no one venturing to express a hope or opinion,
when Rob Carrol suddenly spoke, in the cheeriest tones.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do, fellows."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Fred, quick to seize the relief of hearing
each other's voices.</p>

<p>"Let's start a fire."</p>

<p>"A good idee," assented Jack Cosgrove, falling into the odd mood
that had taken possession of his companions; "you gather the fuel
and I'll kindle it. It happens I haven't such a thing as a match
about me, but I'll find a way to start it."</p>

<p>"Rob and I have plenty, but, if we hadn't, we could rub some
pieces of ice together till the friction started a flame."</p>

<p>"The Esquimaux have another plan," added Rob. "They will trim
a piece of ice in the form of a convex lens and concentrate the
sun's rays on the object they want to set on fire. Why not try
that?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid there isn't enough sunlight to amount to anything,"
replied Fred, craning his head forward and peering through the
gloom, as if searching for the orb of day.</p>

<p>"That isn't the only way of getting up steam," remarked Jack,
who, just like his honest self, was striving to dispose of his
body so as to give each of the boys the greatest possible amount
of warmth; "I know a better one."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"Race back and forth along the side of the berg till we start
the blood circulating; nothing like that."</p>

<p>"Suppose we should slip, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Then you'd flop into the sea; it's a good thing to take a bath
when your blood is heated too much."</p>

<p>"If there was only a footpath where we could do that, it would
be a good plan," observed Rob, "but, as it is, we shall have to
huddle together till morning, when I hope Captain McAlpine will
send a boat after us."</p>

<p>The boys noticed that Jack made no reply to this. They expected
an encouraging response, but he remained silent, as though he
was considering difficulties, dangers, complications, and perils
of which they could form no idea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gale raged with resistless fury. There was no more
fall of snow, but the wind was like a hurricane. The most vivid
idea of its awful power was gained when the friends, far removed
from the water's edge, and at no small elevation above it, felt
drops of spray flung in their faces.</p>

<p>The thunder of the surges, shattered into mist and foam against
the adamantine side of the iceberg, was so overpowering that,
had not the heads of the three been close, they would not have
heard each other's voices. The see-sawing of the colossal mass
was more perceptible than ever, and caused them to think, with
unspeakable dread, of the possibility of the berg breaking apart,
or overturning like the other, in the effort to preserve its equilibrium.</p>

<p>The gale whistled around and among the projections of the ice
with a weird, uncanny sound, alike and yet different from that
heard when it moans through the network of ropes and rigging of
a great ship. The question was whether such a vast volume of wind,
impinging against the thousands of square feet of ice, would not
affect the course and speed of the mass. If the hurricane drove
in the same direction as the controlling current, it ought to
be of much help. If opposed, it might check it; if quartering,
it might make a radical change in its course.</p>

<p>All these speculations were in vain, however, and, as has been
said, there was nothing to be done, but to wait and trust in the
only One who could help them, and who had been so merciful in
the past that their faith in His goodness and protecting care
could not be shaken.</p>

<p>"My lads," said Jack, when the silence which followed their brief
conversation had lasted some minutes, "there's only one thing
to do, and that's to make ourselves as comfortable as we can where
we are."</p>

<p>"Isn't that what we are doing?" asked Rob.</p>

<p>"Of course it is, but I didn't know but what you was trying to
conjure up some other plan. If so, give it up, say your prayers,
and go to bed."</p>
