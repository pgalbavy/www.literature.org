<p>"Attention, children! Close copy books and pass them to the right.
Monitors, collect."</p>

<p>Tired Miss Phelps laid down her crayon, with one sweep of her
arm erased the letter exercises she had so laboriously traced
on the blackboard for her fifty pupils to copy, wiped the clinging
chalk from her dry, chapped hands, and sank wearily into her chair
beside the littered desk, as she issued her commands in sharp,
almost impatient tones. Her head ached fiercely, her brain seemed
on fire, the subdued scratching of scores of pens in unskilled
fingers set her nerves on edge, and she was ready to collapse
with the strain of the day. Yet another hour remained before the
afternoon session would draw to a close. How was she ever to hear
the stupid geography recitation, or listen to the halting, singsong
voices stumble through pages of a Reader too old for their understanding?</p>

<p>Again she glanced at the clock. A full hour of torture, and she
was simply longing for bed! A sudden determination seized her.
She would read to her scholars instead of listening to the lessons
they had prepared to recite! So, selecting a book from the row
on her desk, she waited until the blotted, inky copy books had
been gleefully whisked shut by their owners, passed across the
aisle and gathered in neat piles by the monitors, who creaked
solemnly up to the corner table and laid them beside the day's
written exercises for the teacher's inspection later. Then they
clattered back to their seats and waited with expectant eyes fixed
upon Miss Phelps for the next command.</p>

<p>"Take rest position!"</p>

<p>There was a brisk scraping of feet, a rustling of dresses, and
fifty active bodies sat stiffly erect with hands clasped on the
desk-tops in front of them. No,&mdash;not fifty. One child, a brown-eyed
girl with short, riotous curls tumbling about her round, animated
face, sat heedless of her surroundings, staring out of the window
near her into the bright Spring sunshine, and from her rapt expression
it was evident that her thoughts were far away from school and
lessons.</p>

<p>Miss Phelps waited an instant, but the child was lost in her
dreams and did not feel the unusual silence of the room. Following
the gaze of the intent brown eyes, the teacher glanced out of
the window and saw a flock of pigeons disporting themselves on
the barn roof across the road; and as they fluttered and strutted,
scolded and cooed, the little watcher at her desk unconsciously
imitated their movements, thrusting out her chest, cocking her
head pertly on one side and nodding and pecking at imaginary birds,
just as her pretty feathered friends were doing as they basked
in the warm sunshine. Involuntarily the woman smiled. Then, as
the girl continued to mimic the doves, she tapped her foot impatiently
on the floor and repeated emphatically, "Children, take rest position!"</p>

<p>Stealthily the other pupils let their eyes rove about the room
in search of the guilty member, for it was very plain from the
teacher's manner that someone was out of order. Instantly a pencil
rapped sharply on the desk, and forty-nine pair of inquisitive
eyes jerked quickly to the front again. But the fiftieth pair
continued to stare out of the window, until in exasperation the
woman's voice rasped out, "Peace Greenfield, will you please give
me your undivided attention?"</p>

<p>With a start of horrified surprise the culprit awoke from her
daydreams, to discover that she was flapping her outstretched
arms in either aisle like some exultant cockerel just ready to
crow. Abashed and dismayed at having been caught napping, she
thrust her hands hastily into her desk, seized her geography,
and scrambling to her feet, started for the front of the room,
remembering that her class was the next to recite. The children
tittered, and Peace, much amazed to find that no one followed,
paused uncertainly, searched her brain desperately to recall the
teacher's command, and then glibly recited, "Brazil is bounded
on the north by&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scholars burst into a howl of derision, and poor Peace slumped
into her seat, covered with confusion. Even the tired teacher
smiled at the child's discomfort, but immediately rapped for order,
and said sternly, "Rest position, please! The geography and reading
classes will not recite this afternoon. I shall read to you from
our book of mythology, and when I have finished, I shall expect
you to repeat the story. What was the last we read about?"</p>

<p>"The wooden horse in the siege of Troy," shouted a score of voices.</p>

<p>"Correct," smiled the teacher faintly. "And today I shall tell
you about Ganymede and how he was connected with the other characters
we have been studying. Ganymede&mdash;repeat the name after me."</p>

<p>"Ganymede," roared the obedient scholars.</p>

<p>"Ganymede," whispered Peace to herself. "Ganymede&mdash;what a funny
name! I wonder if he was any relation to those folks Hope was
talking about last night. They were Medes and&mdash;and Persians. I
d'clare, I 'most forgot that word. Hist'ry like Hope's must be
int'resting. I'll be glad when I get big enough to study about
the Goffs and Salts and&mdash;and Sandals and the rest of that bunch."
She meant Goths and Celts and Vandals, but somehow words had a
bad habit of getting sadly mixed up in that active brain which
tried to absorb all it heard; and she was always making outrageous
speeches in consequence.</p>

<p>"I don't like mythology. What do we care about Herc'les and his
sore heel, or Helen or Hector? &mdash;I wonder if that's the man
Hec Abbott was named after? I'd rather &mdash;My! what a lovely
day it is for March! No wonder the doves are talking. Wouldn't
I like to be up on that barn roof in the sun! Bet I'd do some
talking too. S'posing I was a really dove. What fun it would be
to fly away, away up in the blue sky. I wonder if they ever bump
into the clouds. There goes a white cloud skimming right over
the sun. Now it's gone and we're in the shine once more. Queer
how it can shine in spots and be cloudy in spots at the same time.
That's like laughing with one eye and bawling with the other.
I don't b'lieve a body could ever do that. Wish I could, just
to see what it would feel like.</p>

<p>"'Twon't take many days like this 'fore the grass begins to grow
and the leaves to come. The trees are budded big now. I am crazy
wild for the cowslips and vi'lets to get here. Hicks promised
to help us plant some flowers on our Lilac Lady's grave. It looks
so bare and lonely now with the snow all gone, and only that tall
white stone to tell where she is. I know where the loveliest yellow
vi'lets grow."</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield!"</p>

<p>Again Peace came to the earth with an abruptness that left her
breathless and quaking. "Yes, ma'am," she responded meekly.</p>

<p>"You weren't paying attention, were you?" demanded the long-suffering
teacher.</p>

<p>Peace pondered. She could scarcely say "yes" truthfully, and
yet her intentions were good. She had not meant to lose herself
again, nor did realize how very little she had heard of the story
which the teacher had been reading.</p>

<p>"Were you?" repeated Miss Phelps relentlessly.</p>

<p>"Partly," Peace responded haughtily.</p>

<p>The woman gasped; then as the scholars giggled, she said sternly,
"Tell us what the story was about."</p>

<p>Peace opened her mouth. "Gan&mdash;" she began and halted. What <em>had</em>
the story been about? Rapidly she searched through her memory.
It was such a funny word. How could she have forgotten it?</p>

<p>The children sniggered audibly.</p>

<p>"Gan&mdash;what?" urged the weary teacher sarcastically.</p>

<p>O, yes, now she remembered it! "Gandermeats and pigeons," triumphantly
finished Peace, with a saucy toss of her head.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence in the room; then a jeering
shout rose from forty-nine throats. But it was instantly quelled
by a sharp rap on the desk, and when order was restored, Miss
Phelps said encouragingly, "Ganymede and what, Peace? Surely not
<em>pigeon</em>! You didn't mean that, now did you?"</p>

<p>But Peace had come to the end of her resources. If it wasn't
pigeons, what was it?</p>

<p>"Tell her, children," prompted Miss Phelps, as Peace floundered
helplessly.</p>

<p>"An eagle," yelled the chorus of eager voices.</p>

<p>An <em>eagle</em>! Queer, but she had heard no mention made of
an eagle; and she trembled in her shoes for fear the teacher would
ask still more embarrassing questions.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, Miss Phelps turned to the lad across the
aisle, and said, "Johnny, you may tell us the story of Ganymede."</p>

<p>Johnny was nearly bursting his jacket in his eagerness to publish
his knowledge; so to Peace's immense gratification and relief,
he gabbled off his version of Ganymede's experience with Jupiter's
eagle. And Peace breathed more freely when he sat down puffing
with pride at the teacher's, "Well told, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Mercy! I'm glad she didn't ask me any more about the old fellow,"
Peace sighed. "I &mdash;I guess I didn't hear much she said, but
that horrid mythology is so dry. I don't see why she keeps reading
the stuff to us. I'd a sight rather study about physiology and
<em>cardrack</em> valves and <em>oil-factory</em> nerves in the
nose like Cherry does; though I don't see how she ever remembers
those long words and what part of the body they b'long to. I'd&mdash;yes,
I'd rather have mental 'rithmetic every day of the week than mythology
about old gods that never lived, and did only mean things to everybody
when they b'lieved they lived."</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield!" sounded an exasperated voice in her ear.
"If you would rather watch those pigeons across the street than
to pay attention to your lessons, we will just excuse you and
let you stand by the window until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't watching a single pigeon that time," Peace broke in
hotly. "I was only thinking about those hateful gods folks used
to b'lieve in, and wondering why the School Board makes us study
about them when they were just clear fakes&mdash;every one of 'em&mdash;'nstead
of learning things that really did happen at some time. There's
enough true, int'resting things going on around us to keep us
busy without studying fakes, seems to me."</p>

<p>Now it happened that the mythological tales with which Miss Phelps
regaled her small charges from time to time were not a part of
the regular course of study laid out for her grade, and at this
pupil's blunt criticism, the teacher's face became scarlet; but
she quickly regained her poise, and turning to the school, asked,
"How many of you enjoy listening to these myths which I have been
reading?"</p>

<p>A dozen wavering, uncertain hands went up. The rest remained
clasped on their desks.</p>

<p>The woman was astounded. "What kind of stories <em>do</em> you
like best?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Those in the new Readers," responded the pupils as with one
voice.</p>

<p>Mechanically Miss Phelps reached for one of the volumes, and
opening it at random, read the New England tale of the Pine-tree
Shillings to her delighted audience.</p>

<p>Peace tried to center her thoughts upon what was being read,
but the lure of the Spring sunshine and blue sky was too great
to be resisted; and before the story was ended, she was again
wandering in realms of her own. Down by the river where the pussy
willows grew, out in the marshland where the cowslips soon would
blow, up the gently sloping hillside, far up where the tall shaft
of marble stood sentinel over the grave of her beloved Lilac Lady,
she wandered, planning, planning what she would do when the warm
Spring sunshine had chased away the Frost King for another year.</p>

<p>The book closed with a sudden snap, and the teacher demanded
crisply, "All who think they can tell the story as well as Johnny
told us about Ganymede, raise your hands."</p>

<p>Vaguely aware that Miss Phelps had told them to raise their hands,
Peace quickly shot one plump arm into the air and waved it frantically.</p>

<p>"Very well, Peace, you may begin."</p>

<p>Peace bounced to her feet. What was expected of her? Why had
she raised her hand?</p>

<p>"Aw, tell her about the pine-tree shillings," prompted boastful
Johnny in a whisper, and Peace plunged boldly into the half-heard
story, wondering within herself how she was going to end it respectably
when she did not know the true ending because her mind had been
wool-gathering.</p>

<p>"Once there was a man&mdash;a man&mdash;a man&mdash;" blundered the girl, trying
in vain to remember whether or not he had a name.</p>

<p>"Yes, a man," repeated the teacher impatiently. "Go on. Where
did he live and what did he do?"</p>

<p>"He lived in olden times," replied Peace, grasping eagerly at
the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well, but in what country? Asia or Africa?"</p>

<p>"Neither. He lived in the New England,"&mdash;the New England chanced
to be Martindale's largest furniture store,&mdash;"and he was very
rich and had a buckskin maiden."</p>

<p>"A <em>what</em>?" gasped the astonished woman, dropping her
book to the floor with a bang.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a buckskin maiden," repeated the child slowly, realizing
that she had made some mistake, but not knowing where.</p>

<p>"Buxom," whispered Johnny frantically.</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a bucksin maiden," corrected Peace.</p>

<p>"Buxom!" snapped the teacher irritably.</p>

<p>"Bucksome," repeated Peace, with the picture of a bucking billy
goat uppermost in her mind, and wondering how a maiden could be
<em>bucksome</em>.</p>

<p>"Go on," sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, this bucksome maiden wanted awful bad to get married,
like all other women do, and so her father found a man for her,
but she had to have a dairy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dowry," corrected the teacher. "What is a dowry, Peace?"</p>

<p>"A place where they keep cows," responded the child, sure of
herself this time; but to her amazement, the rest of the scholars
hooted derisively, and Miss Phelps said wearily, "Peace was evidently
asleep when I explained the meaning of that word. Alfred, you
may tell her what a dowry is."</p>

<p>"A dowry is the money and jew'ls and things a girl gets from
her father to keep for her very own when she marries."</p>

<p>"Oh," breathed Peace, suddenly enlightened. "Well, her father
stood her in a pair of scales and weighed her with shingles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With&mdash;?" Miss Phelps fortunately had not caught the word.</p>

<p>"Pine-tree shillings," prompted Johnny under his breath. "He
had a chest full of 'em."</p>

<p>"Pine-tree shingles," answered Peace dutifully. "He had a chest
made of them."</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield!" Miss Phelps' patience had come to an end.
Sometimes it seemed to her as if this solemn-eyed child purposely
misunderstood, and mocked at her attempts to lead unwilling feet
along the path of learning, and she was at a loss to know how
to deal with the sprightly elf who danced and flitted about like
an elusive will-o'-wisp. The fact that she was the University
President's granddaughter was the only thing that had saved her
thus far from utter disfavor in the eyes of her teacher; but now
even that fact was lost sight of in face of the child's repeated
misdemeanors and flagrant inattention. She should be punished.
It was the only way out.</p>

<p>Drawing her thin lips into a straight, grim line to express her
disapproval, Miss Phelps repeated, "Peace Greenfield, you may
remain after school."</p>

<p>The gong rang at that instant, the notes of the piano echoed
through the building, and surprised, dismayed Peace, after one
searching look at her teacher's face and a longing glance out
into the bright sunlight, sank into her seat and watched her comrades
march gleefully down the hall and scatter along the street. It
was too bad to be kept in on such a beautiful day! O, dear, what
a queer world it was and how many queer people in it! There was
Miss Phelps for one. She was so strict and stern and sarcastic,&mdash;almost
as sharp and harsh as Miss Peyton, who had made life so miserable
for poor Peace in Chestnut School the year before. But Miss Peyton
did begin to understand at last, while Miss Phelps&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace, come here."</p>

<p>Peace roused from her bitter revery with a start. She had not
observed the teacher's noiseless return to the room after conducting
her pupils down the hall, and was astonished to find the stiff
figure sitting in its accustomed place behind the desk which had
once more been whisked into spick and span order for another day.</p>

<p>Peace scuttled spryly down the aisle, casting one final wistful
glance over her shoulder at the doves across the street. How delightful
it must be to be a bird! The teacher saw the glance, and putting
on her severest expression, demanded sternly, "What is the matter
with you, child? Have you lost your wits entirely, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, teacher," the eager voice burst forth, as Peace pointed rapturously
out of the window, "isn't this the elegantest day? Seems 's if
Winter had stayed twice as long this year as it ought to, and
it's been an awful trial to everyone, with its blizzards and drifts.
I like winter, too. It's such fun coasting and skating and sleighing
and snow-balling. But I've got enough for once. I'm <em>glad</em>
Spring is here at last." Her voice sent a responding joyous thrill
through the woman's cold heart in spite of herself. "The ice in
the river is 'most all gone, the pussy willows by the boathouse
are peeking out their queer little jackets, and the robins are
beginning to build their nests in the trees. Grandpa says when
the birds commence to build, Spring is here to stay; and I'm <em>so</em>
glad. I've just been aching to go hunting vi'lets and cowslips
and 'nemones. We are going to plant a heap of wild flowers on
her grave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whose grave?" the amazed teacher heard herself asking.</p>

<p>"My Lilac Lady's. It's so bare now. The grass was all dead when
she fell asleep last Fall, and only the ugly ground shows now&mdash;just
the size of the bed they laid her in. We're going to cover it
with the flowers she liked best, first the wild ones from the
woods, and then the garden blossoms&mdash;pansies and forget-me-nots
and English daisies. I know where the prettiest vi'lets grow,&mdash;just
scads and oodles of 'em&mdash;down by the stone bridge over Bartlett's
Creek in Parker; and Hicks is going to help us transplant them.
Only it's too early yet. They aren't even up through the ground
now. But it won't take long, with days like this. It's hard to
study with Spring smelling so d'licious right under your nose.
Doesn't it make you want to get out and jump rope and play marbles
and leap-frog, and&mdash;and just jump and skip and <em>yell</em>?
I can pretty near fly with gladness!"</p>

<p>Peace turned a radiant face toward the silent woman, and was
dismayed to find tears glistening in the cold gray eyes. "Oh!"
she exclaimed in deep contrition, "what is the matter? Did <em>I&mdash;</em>what
have I said now to make you squall?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear," smiled the teacher, wiping away the telltale
drops with a hasty whisk of her handkerchief. "I &mdash;I just
saw in my mind a picture of the little old cottage where I used
to live, and it made me homesick, I think. My head aches, too,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you mustn't let me keep you here," cried the child, forgetting
that she had been bidden to remain after school as a punishment
for inattention. "You better go right home, drink a cup of good,
hot tea, and go to bed. That'll make you feel all right by morning,
I know, 'cause that's the way we fix Grandpa up when his head
bothers. Here's your hat and coat. Just breathe in lots of air,
too. It's pretty muddy under foot to walk very far, but the fresh
air will do you good."</p>

<p>Before the woman could realize how it happened, Peace had coaxed
her into her wraps, slipped on her own, and hand in hand with
the astounded teacher was walking demurely down the muddy street,
still chattering gayly. At the corner, faithful Allee awaited
the coming of her unfortunate sister, and Peace, seeing the yellow
curls bobbing under the blue stocking cap, gave the teacher's
hand a parting squeeze, waved a smiling good-bye, and skipped
off beside the younger child as if there were no such a thing
as being kept in after school.</p>

<p>"O, Allee," Miss Phelps heard her say as they pelted down the
avenue, "do you s'pose Grandma'll let us go over to Evelyn's to
play? It's dry enough, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Cherry's gone on ahead to find out," Allee panted. "They are
going to play anti-over, &mdash;Ted and Johnny and all the rest."</p>

<p>"Goody! I just know Grandma won't put her foot down. It's such
a lovely day! Hear that robin say, 'Spring is here, Spring is
here!' S'posin' we were robins, Allee, and had to hunt up horse-hair
and hay to build our nests of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! Allee! Hurry up. We are already to play," screamed Evelyn
Smiley, leaning over her gate and beckoning wildly to the racing
girls. "Your grandmother says you can stay till five o'clock.
Ted's 'it' this time. Johnny has a dandy ball, and we are going
to play over the house."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Peace incredulously, "that's so high!"</p>

<p>"All the more fun," answered Ted, joining them at the gate.</p>

<p>"But we might break some windows."</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! Our ball is big and soft Couldn't break anything
with it. 'Tain't like Fred's hard rubber one. Come on. This is
my side of the house. You take the other."</p>

<p>The rest of the dozen children gathered on the front lawn scuttled
away to the place designated, and the game was on. Such laughing
and shouting, such running and dodging! Once Edith Smiley, Evelyn's
aunt, beloved of all the children, came to the window and watched
the boisterous, exhilarating frolic with an anxious pucker between
her brows. "I am afraid someone will get hurt, Mother," she said
in answer to the white-haired grandmother's questioning glance.</p>

<p>"How can they? Seems to me they are playing a very harmless game."</p>

<p>"But the house is too high for 'anti-over.' They should have
taken the garage."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! They are developing muscle. Watch that Peace fling
the ball. She can throw almost as well as a boy."</p>

<p>"The lawn is so slippery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are nimble on their feet, and the ground is soft."</p>

<p>Edith retired to her piano practise and the mother resumed her
knitting with her usual tranquillity. Suddenly above the soft
strains of music that filled the house, rose a yell of dismay
from a dozen throats outside.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" Edith glanced apprehensively toward the door.</p>

<p>"Their ball is caught on the roof," answered her mother, still
smiling placidly. "Guess their game is over for tonight. Well,
it is time. The clock is just ready to strike five."</p>

<p>Edith turned back to the piano, but before her hands had touched
the ivory keys, there was a wild, excited, protesting shout from
outside that brought her to her feet and sent her flying for the
door.</p>

<p>"Peace, Peace! Come down. You'll fall! You'll fall!"</p>

<p>"Johnny Gates, take that back! She's not a coward! She couldn't
keep the ball from catching in that corner."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace, never mind the ball. It's Johnny who's the coward."</p>

<p>"Hush! You will confuse her!" Edith's voice was low but vibrant,
and the screams from the terrified watchers below abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>Peace had reached the ball wedged in a hollow by the chimney,
and with accurate aim, sent it spinning down to its white-faced,
tearful owner; but as she turned to crawl back the way she had
come, her foot slipped, she wavered uncertainly, and fell with
a crash to the roof, rolling over and over in a vain endeavor
to stop her mad career, till, with the horrified eyes of the stricken
audience glued upon her, she slid over the coping and landed in
a crumpled heap on the sodden turf below.</p>

<p>Then pandemonium broke loose. Evelyn burst into uncontrollable
sobs, Fanny toppled over in blissful unconsciousness, Cherry,
beside herself with grief, tore down the street to break the direful
news to those at home; and the boys danced and pranced in their
terror, as they screamed, "She's dead, she's dead! Peace Greenfield's
dead!"</p>

<p>For a brief instant, which seemed like eternity to Edith Smiley,
she stood rooted to the spot, transfixed by the very horror of
it all. Then loyal Allee's frenzied scream brought her to her
senses, and she saw the golden head bending over the disheveled
form in the mud, as the child repeated again and again, "She's
<em>not</em> dead! She <em>can't</em> be dead! I won't <em>let</em>
her be dead!" Swiftly Edith knelt beside the pair and sought to
lift the older child to carry her into the house. But at her first
touch, the brown eyes unclosed, and a roguish smile broke over
the white face, as Peace looked up at the frightened figures above
her and giggled hysterically, "I've often wondered what it would
feel like to fly. Do you s'pose it makes the birds sick and dizzy
every time they make a swoop?"</p>

<p>"Peace!" gasped Edith, "are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, only things look kind of tipsy 'round here, and my breath
has got St. Vitas Dance." Slowly she stretched out her arms and
legs that they might see that none of her limbs were broken; but
when she attempted to sit up, her lips went white and she fell
back on the trampled grass with a stifled groan.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> hurt, Peace Greenfield," declared anxious Allee,
hovering over her like a mother bird over her young.</p>

<p>"There's a place in my back," whispered the injured girl faintly.
"I guess maybe one of my ribs is cracked."</p>

<p>At this moment the distracted President and wild-eyed Gail pushed
through the knot of children huddled about the fallen heroine,
and demanded huskily, "How is she? Not dead? Thank God! Any bones
broken?"</p>

<p>"Nope, Grandpa," smiled Peace cheerfully. "I just got a <em>cricket</em>
in my back, so it hurts a little when I wiggle; but I got Johnny's
ball, too, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there is something wrong," whispered Edith Smiley,
with a worried look in her eyes, as she made way for the President.
"She can't move without groaning."</p>

<p>The stalwart man stooped over the outstretched figure and gathered
it in his arms, but as he lifted her from the ground she screamed
in agony and fainted quite away. Thus they bore her home&mdash;the
President with the still form on his bosom, Gail bearing the muddy
red stocking cap, Cherry and Allee bringing up the rear, while
a hushed, scared-faced throng of playmates followed at some distance.</p>

<p>The next morning the corner seat by the window in Miss Phelps'
room was vacant for the first time that year, and the teacher
looked up in surprise when no familiar voice answered, "Present,"
when she called Peace Greenfield's name.</p>

<p>"She fell off the roof of Smiley's house," volunteered one scholar.</p>

<p>"And broke her back," supplemented another.</p>

<p>"What!" shrieked the horrified teacher, with a strange, sickening
fear clutching at her heart.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the school principal entered the room, looking
worn and distraught.</p>

<p>"Miss Lisk," cried the teacher, turning eagerly to her superior,
"the children tell me that Peace Greenfield has fallen from some
roof and broken her back."</p>

<p>"O, it's not as bad as that," responded the older woman promptly.
"She has had a nasty fall and is&mdash;hurt. How badly, the doctor
is unable yet to say, but we hope she will soon be with us again."
Lowering her voice so none but the teacher could hear, she added,
"The physician is afraid that her spine is injured."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Phelps, too shocked for further words.</p>

<p>"It is too bad such a thing should happen to her," continued
Miss Lisk sadly. "She is such a lovable child, the life of her
home."</p>

<p>Had anyone paid such a tribute to the lively Peace on the previous
day, her teacher would merely have raised her eyebrows doubtfully;
but with the memory of that flushed, joyous face still so vividly
before her, and with the sound of the eager, childish prattle
still ringing in her ears, she nodded her head in assent, and
turned back to the day's duties with a heaviness of heart that
was overwhelming. With that restless, active figure gone from
its accustomed corner, the sun seemed to have set in mid-day and
left the whole world in darkness.</p>
