<p>The hateful entreaty still murmured in her resentful ears, that
night, as she fell asleep; and she passed into the beginnings
of a dream with her lips slightly dimpling the surface of her
pillow in belated repartee. And upon waking, though it was Sunday,
her first words, half slumbrous in the silence of the morning,
were, "Vile Things!" Her faculties became more alert during the
preparation of a toilet that was to serve not only for breakfast,
but with the addition of gloves, a hat, and a blue-velvet coat,
for Church and Sunday-school as well; and she planned a hundred
vengeances. That is to say, her mind did not occupy itself with
plots possible to make real; but rather it dabbled among those
fragmentary visions that love to overlap and displace one another
upon the changeful retina of the mind's eye.</p>

<p>In all of these pictures, wherein prevailingly she seemed to
be some sort of deathly powerful Queen of Poetry, the postures
assumed by the figures of Messrs. Atwater and Rooter (both in
an extremity of rags) were miserably suppliant. So she soothed
herself a little&mdash;but not long. Herbert, in the next pew, in church,
and Henry in the next beyond that, were perfect compositions in
smugness. They were cold, contented, aristocratic; and had an
imperturbable understanding between themselves (even then perceptible
to the sensitive Florence) that she was a nuisance now capably
disposed of by their beautiful discovery of "Say not so!" Florence's
feelings were unbecoming to the place and occasion.</p>

<p>But at four o'clock, that afternoon, she was assuaged into a
milder condition by the arrival, according to an agreement made
in Sunday-school, of the popular Miss Patty Fairchild.</p>

<p>Patty was thirteen and a half; an exquisite person with gold-dusted
hair, eyes of singing blue, and an alluring air of sweet self-consciousness.
Henry Rooter and Herbert Illingsworth Atwater, Jr., out gathering
news, saw her entering Florence's gate, and immediately forgot
that they were reporters. They became silent, gradually moving
toward the house of their newspaper's sole poetess.</p>

<p>Florence and Patty occupied themselves indoors for half an hour;
then went out in the yard to study a mole's tunnel that had interested
Florence recently. They followed it across the lawn at the south
side of the house, discussing the habits of moles and other matters
of zo√∂logy; and finally lost the track near the fence, which was
here the "side fence" and higher than their heads. Patty looked
through a knot-hole to see if the tunnel was visible in the next
yard, but, without reporting upon her observations, she turned,
as if carelessly, and leaned back against the fence, covering
the knot-hole.</p>

<p>"Florence," she said, in a tone softer than she had been using
heretofore;&mdash;"Florence, do you know what I think?"</p>

<p>"No. Could you see any more tracks over there?"</p>

<p>"Florence," said Patty;&mdash;"I was just going to tell you something,
only maybe I better not."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Florence inquired. "Go on and tell me."</p>

<p>"No," said Patty gently. "You might think it was silly."</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>"Yes, you <em>might</em>."</p>

<p>"I promise I won't."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;oh, Florence I'm <em>sure</em> you'll think it's
silly!"</p>

<p>"I <em>promised</em> I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I don't think I better say it."</p>

<p>"Go on," Florence urged. "Patty, you <em>got</em> to."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I got to," said Patty. "What I was going to say,
Florence: Don't you think your cousin Herbert and Henry Rooter
have got the nicest eyes of any boy in town?"</p>

<p>"<em>Who</em>?" Florence was astounded.</p>

<p>"I do," Patty said in her charming voice. "I think Herbert and
Henry've got the nicest eyes of any boy in town."</p>

<p>"You do?" Florence cried incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I really do, Florence. I think Herbert Atwater and Henry
Rooter have got the nicest eyes of any boy in town."</p>

<p>"Well, I never heard anything like <em>this</em> before!" Florence
declared.</p>

<p>"But <em>don't</em> you think they've got the nicest eyes of
any boy in town?" Patty insisted, appealingly.</p>

<p>"I think," said Florence, "their eyes are just horrable!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"<em>Herbert's</em> eyes," continued Florence, ardently, "are
the very worst lookin' ole squinty eyes I ever saw, and that nasty
little Henry <em>Rooter's</em> eyes&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Patty had suddenly become fidgety; she hurried away from
the fence. "Come over here, Florence," she said. "Let's go over
to the other side of the yard and talk."</p>

<p>It was time for her to take some such action. Messrs. Atwater
and Rooter, seated quietly together upon a box on the other side
of the fence (though with their backs to the knot-hole), were
beginning to show signs of inward disturbance. Already flushed
with the unexpected ineffabilities overheard, their complexions
had grown even pinker upon Florence's open-hearted expressions
of opinion. Slowly they turned their heads to look at the fence,
upon the other side of which stood the maligner of their eyes.
Not that they cared what <em>that</em> ole girl thought&mdash;but she
oughtn't to be allowed to go around talking like this and perhaps
prejudicing everybody that had a kind word to say for them.</p>

<p>"Come on over here, Florence," called Patty huskily, from the
other side of the yard. "Let's talk over here."</p>

<p>Florence was puzzled, but consented. "What you want to talk over
here for?" she asked as she came near her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Patty. "Let's go out in the front yard."</p>

<p>She led the way round the house, and a moment later uttered a
cry of surprise as the firm of Atwater &amp; Rooter, passing along
the pavement, hesitated at the gate. Their celebrated eyes showed
doubt for a moment, then a brazenness: Herbert and Henry decided
to come in.</p>

<p>"Isn't this the funniest thing?" cried Patty. "After what I just
said awhile ago&mdash;<em>you</em> know, Florence. Don't you dare to
tell 'em!"</p>

<p>"I cert'nly won't!" her hostess promised, and, turning inhospitably
to the two callers, "What on earth you want around here?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>Herbert chivalrously took upon himself the duty of response.
"Look here; this is my own aunt and uncle's yard, isn't it? I
guess if I want to come in it I got a perfect right to."</p>

<p>"I should say so," his partner said warmly.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" the cordial Patty agreed. "We can play some
nice Sunday games, or something. Let's sit on the porch steps
and think what to do."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> just as soon," said Henry Rooter. "<em>I</em> got
nothin' p'ticular to do."</p>

<p>"I haven't either," said Herbert.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Patty sat between them on the steps.</p>

<p>"This is <em>per-feckly</em> grand!" she cried. "Come on, Florence,
aren't you going to sit down with all the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"Well, pray kindly excuse <em>me</em>!" said Miss Atwater; and
she added that she would neither sit on the same steps with Herbert
Atwater and Henry Rooter, nor, even if they entreated her with
accompanying genuflections, would she have anything else whatever
to do with them. She concluded with a reference to the oldest
pair of shoes she might ever come to possess; and withdrew to
the railing of the veranda at a point farthest from the steps;
and, seated there, swinging one foot rhythmically, she sang hymns
in a tone at once plaintive and inimical.</p>

<p>It was not lost upon her, however, that her withdrawal had little
effect upon her guests. They chattered gaily, and Patty devised,
or remembered, harmless little games that could be played by a
few people as well as by many; and the three participants were
so congenial and noisy and made so merry, that before long Florence
was unable to avoid the impression that whether she liked it or
not she was giving quite a party.</p>

<p>At times the noted eyes of Atwater &amp; Rooter were gentled
o'er with the soft cast of enchantment, especially when Patty
felt called upon to reprove the two with little coquetries of
slaps and pushes. Noted for her sprightliness, she was never sprightlier;
her pretty laughter tooted continuously, and the gentlemen accompanied
it with doting sounds so repulsive to Florence that without being
actively conscious of what she did, she embodied the phrase, "perfeckly
sickening," in the hymn she was crooning, and repeated it over
and over to the air of "Rock of Ages."</p>

<p>"Now I tell you what let's play," the versatile Patty proposed,
after exhausting the pleasures of "Geography," "Ghosts" and other
tests of intellect. "Let's play 'Truth.' We'll each take a piece
o' paper and a pencil, and then each of us asks the other one
some question, and we haf to write down the answer and sign your
name and fold it up so nobody can see it except the one that asked
the question, and we haf to keep it a secret and never tell as
long as we live."</p>

<p>"All right," said Henry Rooter. "I'll be the one to ask you a
question, Patty."</p>

<p>"No," Herbert said promptly. "I ought to be the one to ask Patty."</p>

<p>"Why ought you?" Henry demanded. "Why ought you?"</p>

<p>"Listen!" Patty cried, "<em>I</em> know the way we'll do. I'll
ask each of you a question&mdash;we haf to whisper it&mdash;and each one
of you'll ask me one, and then we'll write it. That'll be simply
grand!" She clapped her hands; then checked herself. "Oh, I guess
we can't either. We haven't got any paper and pencils unless&#11834;"
Here she seemed to recall her hostess. "Oh, Florrie, dear! Run
in the house and get us some paper and pencils."</p>

<p>Florence gave no sign other than to increase the volume of her
voice as she sang: "Perf'ly sick'ning, clef' for me, let me <em>perf'_ly
sick-kin-_ning</em>!"</p>

<p>"We got plenty," said Herbert; whereupon he and Henry produced
pencils and their professional note-books, and supplied their
fair friend and themselves with material for "Truth." "Come on,
Patty, whisper me whatever you want to."</p>

<p>"No; I ought to have her whisper <em>me</em>, first," Henry Rooter
objected. "I'll write the answer to <em>any</em> question; I don't
care what it's about."</p>

<p>"Well, it's got to be the <em>truth</em>, you know," Patty warned
them. "We all haf to write down just exackly the truth on our
word of honour and sign our name. Promise?"</p>

<p>They promised earnestly.</p>

<p>"All right," said Patty. "Now I'll whisper Henry a question first,
and then you can whisper yours to me first, Herbert."</p>

<p>This seemed to fill all needs happily, and the whispering and
writing began, and continued with a coziness little to the taste
of the piously singing Florence. She altered all previous opinions
of her friend Patty, and when the latter finally closed the session
on the steps, and announced that she must go home, the hostess
declined to accompany her into the house to help her find where
she had left her hat and wrap.</p>

<p>"I haven't the <em>least</em> idea where I took 'em off!" Patty
declared in the airiest manner. "If you won't come with me, Florrie,
s'pose you just call in the front door and tell your mother to
get 'em for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're <em>somewhere</em> in there," Florence said coldly,
not ceasing to swing her foot, and not turning her head. "You
can find 'em by yourself, I presume, or if you can't I'll have
our maid throw 'em out in the yard or somep'n to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>thank</em> you!" Miss Fairchild rejoined, as she entered
the house.</p>

<p>The two boys stood waiting, having in mind to go with Patty as
far as her own gate. "That's a <em>pretty</em> way to speak to
company!" Herbert addressed his cousin with heavily marked severity.
"Next time you do anything like that I'll march straight in the
house and inform your mother of the fact."</p>

<p>Florence still swung her foot and looked dreamily away. She sang,
to the air of "Rock of Ages":</p>

<p>"Henry Rooter, Herbert, too&mdash;they make me sick, they make me
sick, that's what they do."</p>

<p>However, they were only too well prepared with their annihilating
response.</p>

<p>"Oh, say not so! Florence, say not so! <em>Florence!</em> Say
not so!"</p>

<p>They even sent this same odious refrain back to her from the
street, as they departed with their lovely companion; and, so
tenuous is feminine loyalty sometimes, under these stresses, Miss
Fairchild mingled her sweet, tantalizing young soprano with their
changing and cackling falsetto.</p>

<p>"Say not so, Florence! Oh, say not so! Say not so!"</p>
