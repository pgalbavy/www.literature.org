<p>Suddenly, nearly all the soldiers disappeared from the village,
there was a 'rebellion' in Colima.  A train had been held up,
people killed.  And somebody, Generals Fulano and Tulano, had
'pronounced' against the government.</p>

<p>Stir in the air, everybody enjoying those periodical shivers of
fear!  But for these shivers, everything much the same as usual.
The church remained shut up, and dumb.  The clock didn't go.  Time
suddenly fell off, the days walked naked and timeless, in the old,
uncounted manner of the past.  The strange, old, uncounted,
unregistered, unreckoning days of the ancient heathen world.</p>

<p>Kate felt a bit like a mermaid trying to swim in a wrong element.
She was swept away in some silent tide, to the old, antediluvian
silence, where things moved without contact.  She moved and existed
without contact.  Even the striking of the hours had ceased.  As a
drowning person sees nothing but the waters, so Kate saw nothing
but the face of the timeless waters.</p>

<p>So, of course, she clutched at her straw.  She couldn't bear it.
She ordered an old, rickety Ford car, to take her bumping out to
Jamiltepec, over the ruinous roads in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The country had gone strange and void, as it does when these
'rebellions' start.  As if the life-spirit were sucked away, and
only some empty, anti-life void remained in the wicked hollow
countryside.  Though it was not far to Jamiltepec, once outside the
village, the chauffeur and his little attendant lad began to get
frightened, and to go frog-like with fear.</p>

<p>There is something truly mysterious about the Mexican quality of
fear.  As if man and woman collapsed and lay wriggling on the
ground like broken reptiles, unable to rise.  Kate used all her
will, against this cringing nonsense.</p>

<p>They arrived without ado at Jamiltepec.  The place seemed quiet,
but normal.  An oxen wagon stood empty in the courtyard.  There
were no soldiers on guard.  They had all been withdrawn, against
the rebellion.  But several peons were moving round, in a desultory
fashion.  The day was a fiesta, when not much work was doing.  In
the houses of the peons, the women were patting tortillas, and
preparing hot chile sauce, grinding away on the metates.  A fiesta!
Only the windmill that pumped up water from the lake was spinning
quickly, with a little noise.</p>

<p>Kate drove into the yard in silence, and two mozos with guns and
belts of cartridges came to talk in low tones to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>'Is Do&ntilde;a Carlota here?' asked Kate.</p>

<p>'No, Se&ntilde;ora.  The patrona is not here.'</p>

<p>'Don Ram&oacute;n?'</p>

<p>'S&iacute;, Se&ntilde;ora!  Est&aacute;.'</p>

<p>Even as she hesitated, rather nervous, Ram&oacute;n came out of the inner
doorway of the courtyard, in his dazzling white clothes.</p>

<p>'I came to see you,' said Kate.  'I don't know if you'd rather I
hadn't.  But I can go back in the motor-car.'</p>

<p>'No,' he said.  'I am glad.  I was feeling deserted, I don't know
why.  Let us go upstairs.'</p>

<p>'Patr&oacute;n!' said the chauffeur, in a low voice.  'Must I stay?'</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n said a few words to him.  The chauffeur was uneasy, and
didn't want to stay.  He said he had to be back in Sayula at such
and such a time.  Excuses, anyhow.  But it was evident he wanted to
get away.</p>

<p>'Then best let him go,' said Ram&oacute;n to Kate.  'You do not mind going
home in the boat?'</p>

<p>'I don't want to give you trouble.'</p>

<p>'It is least trouble to let this fellow go, and you can leave by
boat just whenever you wish to.  So we shall all be more free.'</p>

<p>Kate paid the chauffeur, and the Ford started rattling.  After
rattling a while, it moved in a curve round the courtyard, and
lurched through the zagu&aacute;n, disappearing as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n spoke to his two mozos with the guns.  They went to the outer
doorway, obediently.</p>

<p>'Why do you have to have armed men?' she said.</p>

<p>'Oh, they're afraid of bandits,' he said.  'Whenever there's a
rebellion anywhere, everybody is afraid of bandits.  So of course
that calls bandits into life.'</p>

<p>'But where do they come from?' said Kate, as they passed into the
inner doorways.</p>

<p>'From the villages,' he said, closing the heavy door of that
entrance behind him, and putting the heavy iron bars across, from
wall to wall.</p>

<p>The inner archway was now a little prison, for the strong iron
gates at the lake end of the passage were shut fast.  She looked
through, at the little round pond.  It had some blue water-lilies
on it.  Beyond, the pallid lake seemed almost like a ghost, in the
glare of the sun.</p>

<p>A servant was sent to the kitchen quarters, Ram&oacute;n and Kate climbed
the stone stairs to the upper terrace.  How lonely, stonily
lonesome and forlorn the hacienda could feel!  The very stone walls
could give off emptiness, loneliness, negation.</p>

<p>'But which villages do the bandits come from?' she insisted.</p>

<p>'Any of them.  Mostly, they say, from San Pablo or from Ahuajijic.'</p>

<p>'Quite near!' she cried.</p>

<p>'Or from Sayula,' he added.  'Any of the ordinary men in big hats
you see around the plaza may possibly be bandits, when banditry
pays, as a profession, and isn't punished with any particular
severity.'</p>

<p>'It is hard to believe!' she said.</p>

<p>'It is so obvious!' he said, dropping into one of the rocking-
chairs opposite her, and smiling across the onyx table.</p>

<p>'I suppose it is!' she said.</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and his mozo Martin came up.  Ram&oacute;n ordered
something, in a low, subdued tone.  The man replied in an even
lower, more subdued tone.  Then the master and man nodded at one
another, and the man departed, his huaraches swishing a little on
the terrace.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n had fallen into the low, crushed sort of voice so common in
the country, as if everyone were afraid to speak aloud, so they
murmured guardedly.  This was unusual, and Kate noticed it in him
with displeasure.  She sat looking past the thick mango-trees,
whose fruit was changing colour like something gradually growing
hot, to the ruffled, pale-brown lake.  The mountains of the
opposite shore were very dark.  Above them lay a heavy, but distant
black cloud, out of which lightning flapped suddenly and uneasily.</p>

<p>'Where is Don Cipriano?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Don Cipriano is very much General Viedma at the moment,' he
replied.  'Chasing rebels in the State of Colima.'</p>

<p>'Will they be very hard to chase?'</p>

<p>'Probably not.  Anyhow Cipriano will enjoy chasing them.  He is
Zapotee, and most of his men are Zapotecans, from the hills.  They
love chasing men who aren't.'</p>

<p>'I wondered why he wasn't there on Sunday when you carried away the
images,' she said.  'I think it was an awfully brave thing to do.'</p>

<p>'Do you?' he laughed.  'It wasn't.  It's never half so brave to
carry something off, and destroy it, as to set a new pulse
beating.'</p>

<p>'But you have to destroy those old things, first.'</p>

<p>'Those frowsty images - why, yes.  But it's no good until you've got
something else moving, from the inside.'</p>

<p>'And have you?'</p>

<p>'I think I have.  Don't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, a little doubtful.</p>

<p>'I think I have,' he said.  'I feel there's a new thing moving
inside me.'  He was laughing at her, for her hesitation.  'Why
don't you come and join us?' he added.</p>

<p>'How?' she said.  'By being married off to Don Cipriano?'</p>

<p>'Not necessarily.  Not necessarily.  Not necessarily by being
married to anybody.'</p>

<p>'What are you going to do next?' she said.</p>

<p>'I?  I am going to re-open the church, for Quetzalcoatl to come in.
But I don't like lonely gods.  There should be several of them, I
think, for them to be happy together.'</p>

<p>'Does one need gods?' she said.</p>

<p>'Why yes.  One needs manifestations, it seems to me.'</p>

<p>Kate sat in unwilling silence.</p>

<p>'One needs goddesses too.  That is also a dilemma,' he added, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>'How I would HATE,' said Kate, 'to have to be a goddess for
people.'</p>

<p>'For the monkeys?' he said, smiling.</p>

<p>'Yes!  Of course.'</p>

<p>At that moment, he sat erect, listening.  There had been a shot,
which Kate had heard, but which she had hardly noticed; to her
ears, it might have been a motor-car back-firing, or even a motor-
boat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a sharp little volley of shots.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n rose swiftly, swift as a great cat, and slammed to the iron
door at the top of the stairway, shooting the bars.</p>

<p>'Won't you go into that room?' he said to her, pointing to a dark
doorway.  'You will be all right there.  Just stay a few minutes
till I come back.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, there came a shriek from the courtyard at the back,
and a man's death-voice yelled Patr&oacute;n!</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n's eyes dilated with terrible anger, the anger of death.  His
face went pale and strange, as he looked at her without seeing her,
the black flame filling his eyes.  He had drawn a long-barrelled
steel revolver from his hip.</p>

<p>Still without seeing her, he strode rapidly, soft and catlike,
along the terrace, and leaped up the end staircase on to the roof.
The soft, eternal passion of anger in his limbs.</p>

<p>Kate stood in the doorway of the room, transfixed.  The light of
day seemed to have darkened before her face.</p>

<p>'Hol&aacute;!  You there!' she heard his voice from the roof, in such
anger it was almost a laugh, from far away.</p>

<p>For answer, a confused noise from the courtyard, and several shots.
The slow, steady answer of shots!</p>

<p>She started as a rushing hiss broke on the air.  In terror she
waited.  Then she saw it was a rocket bursting with a sound like a
gun, high over the lake, and emitting a shower of red balls of
light.  A signal from Ram&oacute;n!</p>

<p>Unable to go into the dark room, Kate waited as if smitten to
death.  Then something stirred deep in her, she flew along the
terrace and up the steps to the roof.  She realized that she didn't
mind dying so long as she died with that man.  Not alone.</p>

<p>The roof was glaring with sunshine.  It was flat, but its different
levels were uneven.  She ran straight out into the light, towards
the parapet wall, and had nearly come in sight of the gateway of
the courtyard below, when something gave a slight smack, and bits
of plaster flew in her face and her hair.  She turned and fled back
like a bee to the stairway.</p>

<p>The stairs came up in a corner, where there was a little sort of
stone turret, square, with stone seats.  She sank on one of these
seats, looking down in terror at the turn of the stairs.  It was a
narrow little stone stairway, between the solid stone walls.</p>

<p>She was almost paralysed with shock and with fear.  Yet something
within her was calm.  Leaning and looking out across calm sunshine
of the level roof, she could not believe in death.</p>

<p>She saw the white figure and the dark head of Ram&oacute;n within one of
the small square turrets across the roof.  The little tower was
open, and hardly higher than his head.  He was standing in a
corner, looking sideways down a loop-hole, perfectly motionless.
Snap! went his revolver, deliberately.  There was a muffled cry
below, and a sudden volley of shots.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n stood away from the loop-hole and took off his white blouse,
so that it should not betray him.  Above his sash was a belt of
cartridges.  In the shadow of the turret, his body looked curiously
dark, rising from the white of his trousers.  Again he took his
stand quietly at the side of the long, narrow, slanting aperture.
He lifted his revolver carefully, and the shots, one, two, three,
slow and deliberate, startled her nerves.  And again there was a
volley of shots from below, and bits of stone and plaster smoking
against the sky.  Then again, silence, long silence.  Kate pressed
her hands against her body, as she sat.</p>

<p>The clouds had shifted, the sun shone yellowish.  In the heavier
light, the mountains beyond the parapet showed a fleece of young
green, smoky and beautiful.</p>

<p>All was silent.  Ram&oacute;n in the shadow did not move, pressing himself
against the wall, and looking down.  He commanded, she knew, the
big inner doors.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he shifted.  With his revolver in his hand he
stooped and ran, like some terrible cat, the sun gleaming on his
naked back as he crouched under the shelter of the thick parapet
wall, running along the roof to the corresponding front turret.</p>

<p>This turret was roofless, and it was nearer to Kate, as she sat
spellbound, in a sort of eternity, on the stone seat at the head of
the stairs, watching Ram&oacute;n.  He pressed himself against the wall,
and lifted his revolver to the slit.  And again, one, two, three,
four, five, the shots exploded deliberately.  Some voice below
yelled Ay-ee! Ay-ee!  Ay-ee! in yelps of animal pain.  A voice was
heard shouting command.  Ram&oacute;n kneeled on one knee, re-loading his
revolver.  Then he struck a match, and again Kate almost started
out of her skin, as a rocket rushed ferociously up into the sky,
exploded like a gun, and let fall the balls of red flame that
lingered as if loth to die away, in the high, remote air.</p>

<p>She sighed, wondering what it all was.  It was death, she knew.
But so strange, so vacant.  Just these noises of shots!  And she
could see nothing outside.  She wanted to see what was in the
courtyard.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n was at his post, pressing himself close to the wall, looking
down, with bent head, motionless.  There were shots, and a spatter
of lead from below.  But he did not move.  She could not see his
face, only part of his back; the proud, heavy, creamy-brown
shoulders, the black head bent a little forward, in concentration,
the cartridge-belt dropping above his loins, over the white, floppy
linen of the trousers.  Still and soft in watchful concentration,
almost like silence itself.  Then with soft, diabolic swiftness in
his movements, he changed his position, and took aim.</p>

<p>He was utterly unaware of her; even of her existence.  Which was as
it should be, no doubt.  She sat motionless, waiting.  Waiting,
waiting, waiting, in that yellowish sunlight of eternity, with a
certain changeless suspense of stillness inside her.  Someone would
come from the village.  There would be an end.  There would be an
end.</p>

<p>At the same time, she started every time he fired, and looked at
him.  And she heard his voice saying:  'One needs manifestations,
it seems to me.'  Ah, how she hated the noise of shots.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a piercing shriek, and in one leap was out of her
retreat.  She had seen a black head turning the stairs.</p>

<p>Before she knew it, Ram&oacute;n jumped past her like a great cat, and two
men clashed in mid-air, as the unseen fellow leaped up from the
stairs.  Two men in a crash went down on the floor, a revolver went
off, terrible limbs were writhing.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n's revolver was on the floor.  But again there was a shot from
the tangled men, and a redness of blood suddenly appearing out of
nowhere, on the white cotton clothing, as the two men twisted and
fought on the floor.</p>

<p>They were both big men.  Struggling on the ground, they looked
huge.  Ram&oacute;n had the bandit's revolver-hand by the wrist.  The
bandit, with a ghastly black face with rolling eyes and sparse
moustache, had got Ram&oacute;n's naked arm in his white teeth, and was
hanging on, showing his red gums, while with his free hand he was
feeling for his knife.</p>

<p>Kate could not believe that the black, ghastly face with the
sightless eyes and biting mouth was conscious.  Ram&oacute;n had him
clasped round the body.  The bandit's revolver fell, and the
fellow's loose black hand scrabbled on the concrete, feeling for
it.  Blood was flowing over his teeth.  Yet some blind super-
consciousness seemed to possess him, as if he were a devil, not a
man.</p>

<p>His hand nearly touched Ram&oacute;n's revolver.  In horror Kate ran and
snatched the weapon from the warm concrete, running away as the
bandit gave a heave, a great sudden heave of his body, under the
body of Ram&oacute;n.  Kate raised the revolver.  She hated that horrible
devil under Ram&oacute;n as she had never hated in her life.  Yet she
dared not fire.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n shouted something, glancing at her.  She could not understand.
But she ran round, to be able to shoot the man under Ram&oacute;n.  Even as
she ran, the bandit twisted with a great lunge of his body, heaved
Ram&oacute;n up, and with his short free hand got Ram&oacute;n's own knife from
the belt at the groin, and stabbed.</p>

<p>Kate gave a cry!  Oh, how she wanted to shoot!  She saw the knife
strike sideways, slanting in a short jab into Ram&oacute;n's back.  At the
same moment there was a stumble on the stairs, and another black-
headed man was leaping on to the roof from the turret.</p>

<p>She stiffened her wrist and fired without looking, in a sudden
second of pure control.  The black head came crashing at her.  She
recoiled in horror, lifted the revolver and fired again, and
missed.  But even as it passed her, she saw red blood among the
black hairs of that head.  It crashed down, the buttocks of the
body heaving up, the whole thing twitching and jerking along, the
face seeming to grin in a mortal grin.</p>

<p>Glancing from horror to horror, she saw Ram&oacute;n, his face still as
death, blood running down his arm and his back, holding down the
head of the bandit by the hair and stabbing him with short stabs in
the throat, one, two, while blood shot out like a red projectile;
there was a strange sound like a soda-syphon, a ghastly bubbling,
one final terrible convulsion from the loins of the stricken man,
throwing Ram&oacute;n off, and Ram&oacute;n lay twisted, still clutching the
man's hair in one hand, the bloody knife in the other, and gazing
into the livid, distorted face, in which ferocity seemed to have
gone frozen, with a steady, intent, inhuman gaze.</p>

<p>Then, without letting go his victim's hair, he looked up,
cautiously.  To see Kate's man, with black hair wet with blood, and
blood running down into his glazed, awful eyes, slowly rising to
his knees.  It was the strangest face in the world; the high, domed
head with blood-soddened hair, blood running in several streams
down the narrow, corrugated brow and along the black eyebrows above
the glazed, black, numb eyes, in which the last glazing was of
ferocity, stranger even than wonder, the glazed and absolute
ferocity which the man's last consciousness showed.</p>

<p>It was a long, thin, handsome face, save for those eyes of glazed
ferocity, and for the longish white teeth under the sparse
moustache.</p>

<p>The man was reduced to his last, blank term of being; a glazed and
ghastly ferocity.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n dropped the hair of his victim, whose head dropped sideways
with a gaping red throat, and rose to a crouching position.  The
second bandit was on his knees, but his hand already clasped his
knife.  Ram&oacute;n crouched.  They were both perfectly still.  But Ram&oacute;n
had got his balance, crouching between his feet.</p>

<p>The bandit's black, glazed eyes of blank ferocity took a glint of
cunning.  He was stretching.  He was going to leap to his feet for
his stroke.</p>

<p>And even as he leaped, Ram&oacute;n shot the knife, that was all bright
red as a cardinal bird.  It flew red like a bird, and the drops of
Ram&oacute;n's handful of blood flew with it, splashing even Kate, who
kept her revolver ready, watching near the stairway.</p>

<p>The bandit dropped on his knees again, and remained for a moment
kneeling as if in prayer, the red pommel of the knife sticking out
of his abdomen, from his white trousers.  Then he slowly bowed
over, doubled up, and went on his face again, once more with his
buttocks in the air.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n still crouched at attention, almost supernatural, his dark
eyes glittering with watchfulness, in pure, savage attentiveness.
Then he rose, very smooth and quiet, crossed the blood-stained
concrete to the fallen man, picked up the clean, fallen knife that
belonged to the fellow, lifted the red-dripping chin, and with one
stroke drove the knife into the man's throat.  The man subsided
with the blow, not even twitching.</p>

<p>Then again, Ram&oacute;n turned to look at the first man.  He gazed a
moment attentively.  But that horrible black face was dead.</p>

<p>And then Ram&oacute;n glanced at Kate, as she stood near the stairs with
the revolver.  His brow was like a boy's, very pure and primitive,
and the eyes underneath had a certain primitive gleaming look of
virginity.  As men must have been, in the first awful days, with
that strange beauty that goes with pristine rudimentariness.</p>

<p>For the most part, he did not recognize her.  But there was one
remote glint of recognition.</p>

<p>'Are they both dead?' she asked, awestruck.</p>

<p>'Creo que s&iacute;!' he replied in Spanish.</p>

<p>He turned to look once more, and to pick up the pistol that lay on
the concrete.  As he did so, he noticed that his right hand was
bright red, with the blood that flowed still down his arm.  He
wiped it on the jacket of the dead man.  But his trousers on his
loins were also sodden with blood, they stuck red to his hips.  He
did not notice.</p>

<p>He was like a pristine being, remote in consciousness, and with
far, remote sex.</p>

<p>Curious rattling, bubbling noises still came from the second man,
just physical sounds.  The first man lay sprawling in a ghastly
fashion, his evil face fixed above a pool of blackening blood.</p>

<p>'Watch the stairs!' said Ram&oacute;n in Spanish to her, glancing at her
with farouche eyes, from some far remote jungle.  Yet still the
glint of recognition sparked furtively out of the darkness.</p>

<p>He crept to the turret, and stealthily looked out.  Then he crept
back, with the same stealth, and dragged the nearest dead man to
the parapet, raising the body till the head looked over.  There was
no sound.  Then he raised himself, and peeped over.  No sign, no
sound.</p>

<p>He looked at the dead body as he let it drop.  Then he went to
Kate, to look down the stairs.</p>

<p>'You grazed that man with your first shot, you only stunned him, I
believe,' he said.</p>

<p>'Are there any more?' she asked, shuddering.</p>

<p>'I think they are all gone.'</p>

<p>He was pale, almost white, with that same pristine clear brow, like
a boy's, a sort of twilight changelessness.</p>

<p>'Are you much hurt?' she said.</p>

<p>'I?  No!' and he put his fingers round to his back, to feel the
slowly welling wound, with his bloody fingers.</p>

<p>The afternoon was passing towards yellow, heavy evening.</p>

<p>He went again to look at the terrible face of the first dead man.</p>

<p>'Did you know him?' she said.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'Not that I am aware,' he said.  Then:  'Good that he is dead.
Good that he is dead. - Good that we killed them both.'</p>

<p>He looked at her with that glint of savage recognition from afar.</p>

<p>'Ugh!  No!  It's terrible!' she said, shuddering.</p>

<p>'Good for me that you were there!  Good that we killed them between
us!  Good they are dead.'</p>

<p>The heavy, luxurious yellow light from below the clouds gilded the
mountains of evening.  There was the sound of a motor-car honking
its horn.</p>

<p>Ram&oacute;n went in silence to the parapet, the blood wetting his
pantaloons lower and lower, since they stuck to him when he bent
down.  Rich yellow light flooded the blood-stained roof.  There was
a terrible smell of blood.</p>

<p>'There is a car coming,' he said.</p>

<p>She followed, frightened, across the roof.</p>

<p>She saw the hills and lower slopes inland swimming in gold light
like lacquer.  The black huts of the peons, the lurid leaves of
bananas showed up uncannily, the trees green-gold stood up, with
boughs of shadow.  And away up the road was a puther of dust, then
the flash of glass as the automobile turned.</p>

<p>'Stay here,' said Ram&oacute;n, 'while I go down.'</p>

<p>'Why didn't your peons come and help you?' she said.</p>

<p>'They never do!' he replied.  'Unless they are armed on purpose.'</p>

<p>He went, picking up his blouse and putting it on.  And immediately
the blood came through.</p>

<p>He went down.  She listened to his steps.  Below, the courtyard was
all shadow, and empty, save for two dead white-clothed bodies of
men, one near the zagu&aacute;n, one against a pillar of the shed.</p>

<p>The motor-car came sounding its horn wildly all the way between the
trees.  It lurched into the zagu&aacute;n.  It was full of soldiers,
soldiers standing on the running-boards, hanging on.</p>

<p>'Don Ram&oacute;n!  Don Ram&oacute;n!' shouted the officer, leaping out of the
car.  'Don Ram&oacute;n!'  He was thundering at the doors of the inner
zagu&aacute;n.</p>

<p>Why did not Ram&oacute;n open?  Where was he?</p>

<p>She leaned over the parapet and screamed like a wild bird.</p>

<p>'Viene!  Viene Don Ram&oacute;n!  &Eacute;l viene!'</p>

<p>The soldiers all looked up at her.  She drew back in terror.  Then,
in a panic, she turned downstairs, to the terrace.  There was blood
on the stone stairs, at the bottom, a great pool.  And on the
terrace near the rocking-chairs, two dead men in a great pool of
blood.</p>

<p>One was Ram&oacute;n!  For a moment she went unconscious.  Then slowly she
crept forward.  Ram&oacute;n had fallen, reeking with blood from his
wound, his arms round the body of the other man, who was bleeding
too.  The second man opened his eyes, wildly, and in a rattling
voice, blind and dying, said:</p>

<p>'Patr&oacute;n!'</p>

<p>It was Martin, Ram&oacute;n's own mozo.  He was stiffening and dying in
Ram&oacute;n's arms.  And Ram&oacute;n, lifting him, had made his own wound gush
with blood, and had fainted.  He lay like dead.  But Kate could see
the faintest pulse in his neck.</p>

<p>She ran blindly down the stairs, and fought to get the great iron
bars from across the door, screaming all the time:</p>

<p>'Come!  Somebody!  Come to Don Ram&oacute;n!  He will die.'</p>

<p>A terrified boy and a woman appeared from the kitchen quarters.
The door was opened, just as six horse-soldiers galloped into the
courtyard.  The officer leaped from his horse and ran like a hare,
his revolver drawn, his spurs flashing, straight through the doors
and up the stairs, like a madman.  When Kate got up the stairs
again, the officer was standing with drawn revolver, gazing down at
Ram&oacute;n.</p>

<p>'He is dead?' he said, stupefied, looking at Kate.</p>

<p>'No!' she said.  'It is only loss of blood.'</p>

<p>The officers lifted Ram&oacute;n and laid him on the terrace.  Then
quickly they got off his blouse.  The wound was bleeding thickly in
the back.</p>

<p>'We've got to stop this wound,' said the lieutenant.  'Where is
Pablo?'</p>

<p>Instantly there was a cry for Pablo.</p>

<p>Kate ran into a bedroom for water, and she switched an old linen
sheet from the bed.  Pablo was a young doctor among the soldiers.
Kate gave him the bowl of water and the towel, and was tearing the
sheet into bands.  Ram&oacute;n lay naked on the floor, all streaked with
blood.  And the light was going.</p>

<p>'Bring light!' said the young doctor.</p>

<p>With swift hands he washed the wound, peering with his nose almost
touching it.</p>

<p>'It is not much!' he said.</p>

<p>Kate had prepared bandages and a pad.  She crouched to hand them to
the young man.  The woman-servant set a lamp with a white shade on
the floor by the doctor.  He lifted it, peering again at the wound.</p>

<p>'No!' he said.  'It is not much.'</p>

<p>Then glancing up at the soldiers who stood motionless, peering
down, the light on their dark faces.</p>

<p>'Tu!' he said, making a gesture.</p>

<p>Quickly the lieutenant took the lamp, holding it over the inert
body, and the doctor, with Kate to help, proceeded to staunch and
bind the wound.  And Kate, as she touched the soft, inert flesh of
Ram&oacute;n, was thinking to herself:  This too is he, this silent body!
And that face that stabbed the throat of the bandit was he!  And
that twilit brow, and those remote eyes, like a death-virgin, was
he.  Even a savage out of the twilight!  And the man that knows me,
where is he?  One among these many men, no more!  Oh God! give the
man his soul back, into this bloody body.  Let the soul come back,
or the universe will be cold for me and for many men.</p>

<p>The doctor finished his temporary bandage, looked at the wound in
the arm, swiftly wiped the blood off the loins and buttocks and
legs, and said:</p>

<p>'We must put him in bed.  Lift his head.'</p>

<p>Quickly Kate lifted the heavy, inert head.  The eyes were half
open.  The doctor pressed the closed lips, under the sparse black
moustache.  But the teeth were firmly shut.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>'Bring a mattress,' he said.</p>

<p>The wind was suddenly roaring, the lamp was leaping with a long,
smoky needle of flame, inside its chimney.  Leaves and dust flew
rattling on the terrace, there was a splash of lightning.  Ram&oacute;n's
body lay there uncovered and motionless, the bandage was already
soaked with blood, under the darkening, leaping light of the lamp.</p>

<p>And again Kate saw, vividly, how the body is the flame of the soul,
leaping and sinking upon the invisible wick of the soul.  And now
the soul, like a wick, seemed spent, the body was a sinking, fading
flame.</p>

<p>'Kindle his soul again, oh God!' she cried to herself.</p>

<p>All she could see of the naked body was the terrible absence of the
living soul of it.  All she wanted was for the soul to come back,
the eyes to open.</p>

<p>They got him upon the bed and covered him, closing the doors
against the wind and the rain.  The doctor chafed his brow and
hands with cognac.  And at length the eyes opened; the soul was
there, but standing far back.</p>

<p>For some moments Ram&oacute;n lay with open eyes, without seeing or
moving.  Then he stirred a little.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he said.</p>

<p>'Keep still, Don Ram&oacute;n,' said the doctor, who with his slim dark
hands was even more delicate than a woman.  'You have lost much
blood.  Keep still.'</p>

<p>'Where is Martin?'</p>

<p>'He is outside.'</p>

<p>'How is he?'</p>

<p>'He is dead.'</p>

<p>The dark eyes under the black lashes were perfectly steady and
changeless.  Then came the voice:</p>

<p>'Pity we did not kill them all.  Pity we did not kill them all.  We
have got to kill them all. - Where is the Se&ntilde;ora Inglesa?'</p>

<p>'Here she is.'</p>

<p>His black eyes looked up at Kate.  Then more of his consciousness
came back.</p>

<p>'Thank you for my life,' he said, closing his eyes.  Then:  'Put
the lamp aside.'</p>

<p>Soldiers were tapping at the glass pane, for the lieutenant.  A
black little fellow entered, wiping the rain from his black face
and pushing his thick black hair back.</p>

<p>'There are two more dead on the azotea,' he announced to his
officer.</p>

<p>The lieutenant rose, and followed him out.  Kate too went on to the
terrace.  In the early darkness the rain was threshing down.  A
lantern was coming down from the roof: it came along the terrace to
the stairs, and after it two soldiers in the pouring rain, carrying
a dead body, then behind, two more, with the other body.  The
huaraches of the soldiers clicked and shuffled on the wet terrace.
The dismal cort&egrave;ge went downstairs.</p>

<p>Kate stood on the terrace facing the darkness, while the rain
threshed down.  She felt uneasy here, in this house of men and of
soldiers.  She found her way down to the kitchen, where the boy was
fanning a charcoal fire, and the woman was crushing tomatoes on the
metate, for a sauce.</p>

<p>'Ay, Se&ntilde;ora!' cried the woman.  'Five men dead, and the Patr&oacute;n
wounded to death!  Ay!  Ay!'</p>

<p>'Seven men dead!' said the boy.  'Two on the azotea!'</p>

<p>'Seven men!  Seven men!'</p>

<p>Kate sat on her chair, stunned, unable to hear anything but the
threshing rain, unable to feel anything more.  Two or three peons
came in, and two more women, the men wrapped to their noses in
their blankets.  The women brought masa, and began a great clapping
of tortillas.  The people conversed in low, rapid tones, in the
dialect, and Kate could not listen.</p>

<p>At length the rain began to abate.  She knew it would leave off
suddenly.  There was a great sound of water running, gushing,
splashing, pouring into the cistern.  And she thought to herself:
The rain will wash the blood off the roof and down the spouts into
the cistern.  There will be blood in the water.</p>

<p>She looked at her own blood-smeared white frock.  She felt chilly.
She rose to go upstairs again, into the dark, empty, masterless
house.</p>

<p>'Ah, Se&ntilde;ora!  You are going upstairs?  Go, Daniel, carry the
lantern for the Se&ntilde;ora!'</p>

<p>The boy lit a candle in a lantern, and Kate returned to the upper
terrace.  The light shone out of the room where Ram&oacute;n was.  She
went into the salon and got her hat and her brown shawl.  The
lieutenant heard her, and came to her quickly, very kindly and
respectful.</p>

<p>'Won't you come in, Se&ntilde;ora?' he said, holding the door to the room
where Ram&oacute;n lay; the guest-room.</p>

<p>Kate went in.  Ram&oacute;n lay on his side, his black, rather thin
moustache pushed against the pillow.  He was himself.</p>

<p>'It is very unpleasant for you here, Se&ntilde;ora Caterina,' he said.
'Would you like to go to your house?  The lieutenant will send you
in the motor-car.'</p>

<p>'Is there nothing I can do here?' she said.</p>

<p>'Ah no!  Don't stay here!  It is too unpleasant for you. - I shall
soon get up, and I shall come to thank you for my life.'</p>

<p>He looked at her, into her eyes.  And she saw that his soul had
come back to him, and with his soul he saw her and acknowledged
her; though always from the peculiar remoteness that was inevitable
in him.</p>

<p>She went downstairs with the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>'Ah, what a horrible affair!  They were not bandits, Se&ntilde;ora!' said
the young man, with passion.  'They didn't come to rob.  They came
to murder Don Ram&oacute;n, you know, Se&ntilde;ora! simply to murder Don Ram&oacute;n.
And but for your being here, they would have done it! - Ah, think of
it, Se&ntilde;ora!  Don Ram&oacute;n is the most precious man in Mexico.  It is
possible that in the world there is not a man like him.  And
personally, he hasn't got enemies.  As a man among men, he hasn't
got enemies.  No, Se&ntilde;ora.  Not one!  But do you know who it will
be? the priests, and the Knights of Cort&eacute;s.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure?' said Kate.</p>

<p>'Sure, Se&ntilde;ora!' cried the lieutenant indignantly.  'Look!  There
are seven men dead.  Two were the mozos with guns, watching in the
zagu&aacute;n.  One was Don Ram&oacute;n's own mozo Martin! - ah, what a faithful
man, what a brave one!  Never will Don Ram&oacute;n pardon his death.
Then moreover, the two men killed on the azotea, and two men in the
courtyard, shot by Don Ram&oacute;n.  Besides these, a man whom Martin
wounded, who fell and broke his leg, so we have got him.  Come and
see them, Se&ntilde;ora.'</p>

<p>They were down in the wet courtyard.  Little fires had been lighted
under the sheds, and the little, black, devil-may-care soldiers
were crouching round them, with a bunch of peons in blankets
standing round.  Across the courtyard, horses stamped and jingled
their harness.  A boy came running with tortillas in a cloth.  The
dark-faced little soldiers crouched like animals, sprinkled salt on
the tortillas, and devoured them with small, white, strong teeth.</p>

<p>Kate saw the great oxen tied in their sheds, lying down, the wagons
standing inert.  And a little crowd of asses was munching alfalfa
in a corner.</p>

<p>The officer marched beside Kate, his spurs sparkling in the
firelight.  He went to the muddy car, that stood in the middle of
the yard, then to his horse.  From a saddle-pocket he took an
electric torch, and led Kate across to the end shed.</p>

<p>There he suddenly flashed his light upon seven dead bodies, laid
side by side.  The two from the roof were wet.  Ram&oacute;n's dead man
lay with his dark, strong breast bare, and his blackish, thick,
devilish face sideways; a big fellow.  Kate's man lay rigid.
Martin had been stabbed in the collar bone; he looked as if he were
staring at the roof of the shed.  The others were two more peons,
and two fellows in black boots and grey trousers and blue overall
jackets.  They were all inert and straight and dead, and somehow, a
little ridiculous.  Perhaps it is clothing that makes dead people
gruesome and absurd.  But also, the grotesque fact that the bodies
are vacant, is always present.</p>

<p>'Look!' said the lieutenant, touching a body with his toe.  'This
is a chauffeur from Sayula; this is a boatman from Sayula.  These
two are peons from San Pablo.  This man' - the lieutenant kicked the
dead body - 'we don't know.'  It was Ram&oacute;n's dead man.  'But this
man' - he kicked her dead man, with the tall domed head - 'is from
Ahuajijic, and he was married to the woman that now lives with a
peon here. - You see, Se&ntilde;ora!  A chauffeur and a boatman from
Sayula - they are Knights-of-Cort&eacute;s men; and those two peons from
San Pablo are priests' men. - These are not bandits.  It was an
attempt at assassination.  But of course they would have robbed
everything, everything, if they had killed Don Ram&oacute;n.'</p>

<p>Kate was staring at the dead men.  Three of them were handsome;
one, the boatman, with a thin line of black beard framing his
shapely face, was beautiful.  But dead, with the mockery of death
in his face.  All of them men who had been in the flush of life.
Yet dead, they did not even matter.  They were gruesome, but it did
not matter that they were dead men.  They were vacant.  Perhaps
even in life there had been a certain vacancy, nothingness, in
their handsome physique.</p>

<p>For a pure moment, she wished for men who were not handsome as
these dark natives were.  Even their beauty was suddenly repulsive
to her; the dark beauty of half-created, half-evolved things, left
in the old, reptile-like smoothness.  It made her shudder.</p>

<p>The soul!  If only the soul in man, in woman, would speak to her,
not always this strange, perverse materialism, or a distorted
animalism.  If only people were souls, and their bodies were
gestures from the soul!  If one could but forget both bodies and
facts, and be present with strong, living souls!</p>

<p>She went across the courtyard, that was littered with horse-
droppings, to the car.  The lieutenant was choosing the soldiers
who should stay behind.  The horse-soldiers would stay.  A peon on
a delicate speckled horse, a flea-bitten roan, came trotting past
the soldiers in the zagu&aacute;n.  He had been to Sayula for doctor's
stuff, and to give messages to the Jefe.</p>

<p>At last the car, with little soldiers clinging on to it all round,
moved slowly out of the courtyard.  The lieutenant sat beside Kate.
He stopped the car again at the big white barn under the trees, to
talk to two soldiers picketed there.</p>

<p>Then they moved slowly on, under the wet trees, in the mud that
crackled beneath the wheels, up the avenue to the highroad, where
were the little black huts of the peons.  Little fires were
flapping in front of one or two huts, women were baking tortillas
on the flat earthenware plates, upon the small wood fires.  A woman
was going to her hut with a blazing brand, like a torch, to kindle
her fire.  A few peons in dirty-white clothes squatted silent
against the walls of their houses, utterly silent.  As the motor-
car turned its great glaring headlights upon the highroad, little
sandy pigs with short, curly hair started up squealing, and faces
and figures stood out blindly, as in a searchlight.</p>

<p>There was a hut with a wide opening in the black wall, and a grey
old man was standing inside.  The car stopped for the lieutenant to
call to the peons under the wall.  They came to the car with their
black eyes glaring and glittering apprehensively.  They seemed very
much abashed, and humble, answering the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kate watched a boy buy a drink for one centavo and a
piece of rope for three centavos, from the grey old man at the dark
hole, which was a shop.</p>

<p>The car went on, the great lights glaring unnaturally upon the
hedges of cactus and mesquite and palo blanco trees, and upon the
great pools of water in the road.  It was a slow progress.</p>
