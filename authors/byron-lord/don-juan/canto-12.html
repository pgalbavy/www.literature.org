<p>
Of all the barbarous middle ages, that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is most barbarous is the middle age<br/>
Of man; it is<br/>
&mdash;I really scarce know what;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we hover between fool and sage,<br/>
And don't know justly what we would be at&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A period something like a printed page,<br/>
Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair<br/>
Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Too old for youth,&mdash;too young, at thirty-five,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,&mdash;<br/>
I wonder people should be left alive;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But since they are, that epoch is a bore:<br/>
Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for other love, the illusion 's o'er;<br/>
And money, that most pure imagination,<br/>
Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.

</p>
<p>
O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;<br/>
Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.<br/>
Ye who but see the saving man at table,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,<br/>
And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,<br/>
Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.

</p>
<p>
Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;<br/>
But making money, slowly first, then quicker,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And adding still a little through each cross<br/>
(Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.<br/>
O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,<br/>
Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.

</p>
<p>
Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?<br/>
Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)<br/>
Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?<br/>
The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-<br/>
Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.

</p>
<p>
Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan<br/>
Is not a merely speculative hit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But seats a nation or upsets a throne.<br/>
Republics also get involved a bit;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown<br/>
On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,<br/>
Must get itself discounted by a Jew.

</p>
<p>
Why call the miser miserable? as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I said before: the frugal life is his,<br/>
Which in a saint or cynic ever was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss<br/>
Canonization for the self-same cause,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?<br/>
Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;&mdash;<br/>
Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.

</p>
<p>
He is your only poet;&mdash;passion, pure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,<br/>
Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays<br/>
Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,<br/>
While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies<br/>
Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.

</p>
<p>
The lands on either side are his; the ship<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads<br/>
For him the fragrant produce of each trip;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,<br/>
And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His very cellars might be kings' abodes;<br/>
While he, despising every sensual call,<br/>
Commands&mdash;the intellectual lord of all.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To build a college, or to found a race,<br/>
A hospital, a church,&mdash;and leave behind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:<br/>
Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the very ore which makes them base;<br/>
Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,<br/>
Or revel in the joys of calculation.

</p>
<p>
But whether all, or each, or none of these<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May be the hoarder's principle of action,<br/>
The fool will call such mania a disease:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What is his own? Go&mdash;look at each transaction,<br/>
Wars, revels, loves&mdash;do these bring men more ease<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?<br/>
Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!<br/>
Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours&mdash;who 's wiser?

</p>
<p>
How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins<br/>
(Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,<br/>
But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,<br/>
Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:&mdash;<br/>
Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.

</p>
<p>
'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'&mdash;'for love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is heaven, and heaven is love:'&mdash;so sings the bard;<br/>
Which it were rather difficult to prove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A thing with poetry in general hard).<br/>
Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared<br/>
To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)<br/>
If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.

</p>
<p>
But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;<br/>
Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without cash, Malthus tells you&mdash;'take no brides.'<br/>
So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:<br/>
And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey<br/>
Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.

</p>
<p>
Is not all love prohibited whatever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,<br/>
After a sort; but somehow people never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the same thought the two words have help'd out:<br/>
Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And marriage also may exist without;<br/>
But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,<br/>
And ought to go by quite another name.

</p>
<p>
Now if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruited all with constant married men,<br/>
Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;&mdash;<br/>
Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So celebrated for his morals, when<br/>
My Jeffrey held him up as an example<br/>
To me;&mdash;of whom these morals are a sample.

</p>
<p>
Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,<br/>
The only time when much success is needed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my success produced what I, in sooth,<br/>
Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,<br/>
Of late the penalty of such success,<br/>
But have not learn'd to wish it any less.

</p>
<p>
That suit in Chancery,&mdash;which some persons plead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,<br/>
In the faith of their procreative creed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baptize posterity, or future clay,&mdash;<br/>
To me seems but a dubious kind of reed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lean on for support in any way;<br/>
Since odds are that posterity will know<br/>
No more of them, than they of her, I trow.

</p>
<p>
Why, I 'm posterity&mdash;and so are you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.<br/>
Were every memory written down all true,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;<br/>
Even Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;<br/>
And Mitford in the nineteenth century<br/>
Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.

</p>
<p>
Good people all, of every degree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,<br/>
In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As serious as if I had for inditers<br/>
Malthus and Wilberforce:&mdash;the last set free<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;<br/>
While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,<br/>
And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.

</p>
<p>
I 'm serious&mdash;so are all men upon paper;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And why should I not form my speculation,<br/>
And hold up to the sun my little taper?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation<br/>
On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While sages write against all procreation,<br/>
Unless a man can calculate his means<br/>
Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.

</p>
<p>
That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is<br/>
(Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,<br/>
If that politeness set it not apart;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)&mdash;<br/>
I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'<br/>
Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.

</p>
<p>
And now to business.<br/>
&mdash;O my gentle Juan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art in London&mdash;in that pleasant place,<br/>
Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which can await warm youth in its wild race.<br/>
'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art no novice in the headlong chase<br/>
Of early life; but this is a new land,<br/>
Which foreigners can never understand.

</p>
<p>
What with a small diversity of climate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,<br/>
I could send forth my mandate like a primate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the rest of Europe's social state;<br/>
But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.<br/>
All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the<br/>
There is but one superb menagerie.

</p>
<p>
But I am sick of politics. Begin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided<br/>
Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the ice had like a skater glided:<br/>
When tired of play, he flirted without sin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With some of those fair creatures who have prided<br/>
Themselves on innocent tantalisation,<br/>
And hate all vice except its reputation.

</p>
<p>
But these are few, and in the end they make<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows<br/>
That even the purest people may mistake<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;<br/>
And then men stare, as if a new ass spake<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows<br/>
Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)<br/>
With the kind world's amen&mdash;'Who would have thought it?'

</p>
<p>
The little Leila, with her orient eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And taciturn Asiatic disposition<br/>
(Which saw all western things with small surprise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the surprise of people of condition,<br/>
Who think that novelties are butterflies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be pursued as food for inanition),<br/>
Her charming figure and romantic history<br/>
Became a kind of fashionable mystery.

</p>
<p>
The women much divided&mdash;as is usual<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the sex in little things or great.<br/>
Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always liked you better than I state:<br/>
Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being apt to talk at a great rate;<br/>
And now there was a general sensation<br/>
Amongst you, about Leila's education.

</p>
<p>
In one point only were you settled&mdash;and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,<br/>
As beautiful as her own native land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And far away, the last bud of her race,<br/>
Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,<br/>
Would be much better taught beneath the eye<br/>
Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.

</p>
<p>
So first there was a generous emulation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there was a general competition,<br/>
To undertake the orphan's education.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Juan was a person of condition,<br/>
It had been an affront on this occasion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk of a subscription or petition;<br/>
But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,<br/>
Whose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'

</p>
<p>
And one or two sad, separate wives, without<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough&mdash;<br/>
Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,<br/>
Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all her points as thorough-bred to show:<br/>
And I assure you, that like virgin honey<br/>
Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).

</p>
<p>
How all the needy honourable misters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,<br/>
The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy<br/>
At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy<br/>
Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,<br/>
To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!

</p>
<p>
Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, married dames will now and then discover<br/>
Such pure disinterestedness of passion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.<br/>
'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'<br/>
While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,<br/>
Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.

</p>
<p>
Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is fine to see them scattering refusals<br/>
And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Friends of the party), who begin accusals,<br/>
Such as&mdash;'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals<br/>
To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,<br/>
Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?

</p>
<p>
'Why?&mdash;Why?<br/>
&mdash;Besides, Fred really was attach'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was not her fortune&mdash;he has enough without:<br/>
The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So good an opportunity, no doubt:&mdash;<br/>
But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:<br/>
And after all poor Frederick may do better&mdash;<br/>
Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'

</p>
<p>
Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,<br/>
After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;<br/>
And when at last the pretty creature gets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,<br/>
It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected<br/>
To find how very badly she selected.

</p>
<p>
For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn out with importunity; or fall<br/>
(But here perhaps the instances are fewer)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.<br/>
A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(If 't is not vain examples to recall)<br/>
To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I<br/>
See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.

</p>
<p>
I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'True, 't is a pity&mdash;pity 't is, 't is true'),<br/>
Was chosen from out an amatory score,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Albeit my years were less discreet than few;<br/>
But though I also had reform'd before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those became one who soon were to be two,<br/>
I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,<br/>
That the young lady made a monstrous choice.

</p>
<p>
O, pardon my digression&mdash;or at least<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end<br/>
That I dissert, like grace before a feast:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,<br/>
A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My Muse by exhortation means to mend<br/>
All people, at all times, and in most places,<br/>
Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.

</p>
<p>
But now I 'm going to be immoral; now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean to show things really as they are,<br/>
Not as they ought to be: for I avow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far<br/>
From much improvement with that virtuous plough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar<br/>
Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,<br/>
Only to keep its corn at the old price.

</p>
<p>
But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,<br/>
Or like the old comparison of snows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.<br/>
Like many people everybody knows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan was delighted to secure<br/>
A goodly guardian for his infant charge,<br/>
Who might not profit much by being at large.

</p>
<p>
Besides, he had found out he was no tutor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wish that others would find out the same);<br/>
And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:<br/>
So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his little wild Asiatic tame,<br/>
Consulting 'the Society for Vice<br/>
Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.

</p>
<p>
Olden she was&mdash;but had been very young;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtuous she was&mdash;and had been, I believe;<br/>
Although the world has such an evil tongue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That&mdash;but my chaster ear will not receive<br/>
An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,<br/>
As that abominable tittle-tattle,<br/>
Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.

</p>
<p>
Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight observer in a modest way),<br/>
And so may every one except a dunce,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ladies in their youth a little gay,<br/>
Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sad consequence of going astray,<br/>
Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe<br/>
Which the mere passionless can never know.

</p>
<p>
While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By railing at the unknown and envied passion,<br/>
Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,&mdash;<br/>
The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Entreating you to pause before you dash on;<br/>
Expounding and illustrating the riddle<br/>
Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.

</p>
<p>
Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As better knowing why they should be so,<br/>
I think you 'll find from many a family picture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That daughters of such mothers as may know<br/>
The world by experience rather than by lecture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show<br/>
Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,<br/>
Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.

</p>
<p>
I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?<br/>
But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,<br/>
And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she was given to charity and pity,<br/>
And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)<br/>
For being a most exemplary wife.

</p>
<p>
High in high circles, gentle in her own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the mild reprover of the young,<br/>
Whenever&mdash;which means every day&mdash;they 'd shown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An awkward inclination to go wrong.<br/>
The quantity of good she did 's unknown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the least would lengthen out my song:<br/>
In brief, the little orphan of the East<br/>
Had raised an interest in her, which increased.

</p>
<p>
Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,<br/>
A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,<br/>
And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this might ruin others, it did not him,<br/>
At least entirely&mdash;for he had seen too many<br/>
Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.

</p>
<p>
And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For when they happen at a riper age,<br/>
People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wonder Providence is not more sage.<br/>
Adversity is the first path to truth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,<br/>
Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,<br/>
Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.

</p>
<p>
How far it profits is another matter.-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hero gladly saw his little charge<br/>
Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being long married, and thus set at large,<br/>
Had left all the accomplishments she taught her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,<br/>
To the next comer; or&mdash;as it will tell<br/>
More Muse-like&mdash;like to Cytherea's shell.

</p>
<p>
I call such things transmission; for there is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A floating balance of accomplishment<br/>
Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According as their minds or backs are bent.<br/>
Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of metaphysics; others are content<br/>
With music; the most moderate shine as wits;<br/>
While others have a genius turn'd for fits.

</p>
<p>
But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,<br/>
May be the baits for gentlemen or lords<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With regular descent, in these our days,<br/>
The last year to the new transfers its hoards;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise<br/>
Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches&mdash;<br/>
All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.

</p>
<p>
But now I will begin my poem. 'T is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,<br/>
That from the first of Cantos up to this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 've not begun what we have to go through.<br/>
These first twelve books are merely flourishes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preludios, trying just a string or two<br/>
Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;<br/>
And when so, you shall have the overture.

</p>
<p>
My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:<br/>
Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.<br/>
I thought, at setting off, about two dozen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,<br/>
If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,<br/>
I think to canter gently through a hundred.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,<br/>
Although the highest: but as swords have hilts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By which their power of mischief is increased,<br/>
When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,<br/>
Must still obey the high&mdash;which is their handle,<br/>
Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.

</p>
<p>
He had many friends who had many wives, and was<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well look'd upon by both, to that extent<br/>
Of friendship which you may accept or pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It does nor good nor harm being merely meant<br/>
To keep the wheels going of the higher class,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:<br/>
And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,<br/>
For the first season such a life scarce palls.

</p>
<p>
A young unmarried man, with a good name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fortune, has an awkward part to play;<br/>
For good society is but a game,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,<br/>
Where every body has some separate aim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An end to answer, or a plan to lay&mdash;<br/>
The single ladies wishing to be double,<br/>
The married ones to save the virgins trouble.

</p>
<p>
I don't mean this as general, but particular<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples may be found of such pursuits:<br/>
Though several also keep their perpendicular<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like poplars, with good principles for roots;<br/>
Yet many have a method more reticular&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:<br/>
For talk six times with the same single lady,<br/>
And you may get the wedding dresses ready.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;<br/>
Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand<br/>
What 'your intentions are?'<br/>
&mdash;One way or other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:<br/>
And between pity for her case and yours,<br/>
You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.

</p>
<p>
I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of them high names: I have also known<br/>
Young men who&mdash;though they hated to discuss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown&mdash;<br/>
Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,<br/>
And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,<br/>
In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.

</p>
<p>
There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A peril&mdash;not indeed like love or marriage,<br/>
But not the less for this to be depreciated:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I meant and mean not to disparage<br/>
The show of virtue even in the vitiated&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It adds an outward grace unto their carriage&mdash;<br/>
But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,<br/>
'Couleur de rose,' who 's neither white nor scarlet.

</p>
<p>
Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing<br/>
On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.<br/>
This works a world of sentimental woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;<br/>
But yet is merely innocent flirtation,<br/>
Not quite adultery, but adulteration.

</p>
<p>
'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The next of perils, though I place it sternest,<br/>
Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.<br/>
Abroad, such things decide few women's fate&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)&mdash;<br/>
But in old England, when a young bride errs,<br/>
Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.

</p>
<p>
For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Country, where a young couple of the same ages<br/>
Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there's the vulgar trick of those dd damages! !<br/>
A verdict&mdash;grievous foe to those who cause it!-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;<br/>
Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,<br/>
And evidences which regale all readers.

</p>
<p>
But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy<br/>
Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;<br/>
You may see such at all the balls and dinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the proudest of our aristocracy,<br/>
So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste&mdash;<br/>
And all by having tact as well as taste.

</p>
<p>
Juan, who did not stand in the predicament<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;<br/>
For he was sick&mdash;no, 't was not the word sick I meant&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had seen so much love before,<br/>
That he was not in heart so very weak;<br/>
&mdash;I meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thus much, and no sneer against the shore<br/>
Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,<br/>
Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.

</p>
<p>
But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,<br/>
And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a country where 't is half a fashion,<br/>
Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:<br/>
Besides (alas! his taste&mdash;forgive and pity!)<br/>
At first he did not think the women pretty.

</p>
<p>
I say at first&mdash;for he found out at last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But by degrees, that they were fairer far<br/>
Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the influence of the eastern star.<br/>
A further proof we should not judge in haste;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet inexperience could not be his bar<br/>
To taste:&mdash;the truth is, if men would confess,<br/>
That novelties please less than they impress.

</p>
<p>
Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,<br/>
To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Geography finds no one to oblige her<br/>
With such a chart as may be safely stuck to&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'<br/>
But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there<br/>
No doubt I should be told that black is fair.

</p>
<p>
It is. I will not swear that black is white;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I suspect in fact that white is black,<br/>
And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack<br/>
Perhaps this new position&mdash;but I 'm right;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:&mdash;<br/>
He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark<br/>
Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.

</p>
<p>
But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same<br/>
Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;<br/>
And this reflection brings me to plain physics,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the beauties of a foreign dame,<br/>
Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,<br/>
Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.

</p>
<p>
Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;&mdash;<br/>
Not that there 's not a quantity of those<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have a due respect for their own wishes.<br/>
Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:<br/>
They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,<br/>
As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.

</p>
<p>
But this has nought to do with their outsides.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that Juan did not think them pretty<br/>
At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half her attractions&mdash;probably from pity&mdash;<br/>
And rather calmly into the heart glides,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than storms it as a foe would take a city;<br/>
But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)<br/>
She keeps it for you like a true ally.

</p>
<p>
She cannot step as does an Arab barb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,<br/>
Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;<br/>
Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;le those bravuras (which I still am learning<br/>
To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,<br/>
And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);&mdash;

</p>
<p>
She cannot do these things, nor one or two<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, in that off-hand and dashing style<br/>
Which takes so much&mdash;to give the devil his due;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,<br/>
Nor settles all things in one interview<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A thing approved as saving time and toil);&mdash;<br/>
But though the soil may give you time and trouble,<br/>
Well cultivated, it will render double.

</p>
<p>
And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very serious thing indeed:<br/>
Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,<br/>
The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:<br/>
But the tenth instance will be a tornado,<br/>
For there 's no saying what they will or may do.

</p>
<p>
The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;<br/>
And when the delicacies of the law<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,<br/>
Society, that china without flaw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,<br/>
To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:<br/>
For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is as it should be;&mdash;it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,<br/>
And be thy sins forgiven:'&mdash;but upon this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave the saints to settle their own score.<br/>
Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An erring woman finds an opener door<br/>
For her return to Virtue&mdash;as they cal<br/>
That lady, who should be at home to all.

</p>
<p>
For me, I leave the matter where I find it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads<br/>
People some ten times less in fact to mind it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And care but for discoveries and not deeds.<br/>
And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,<br/>
But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,<br/>
By rendering desperate those who had else repented.

</p>
<p>
But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the moral lessons of mankind:<br/>
Besides, he had not seen of several hundred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady altogether to his mind.<br/>
A little 'blase'&mdash;'t is not to be wonder'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:<br/>
And though not vainer from his past success,<br/>
No doubt his sensibilities were less.

</p>
<p>
He also had been busy seeing sights&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament and all the other houses;<br/>
Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)<br/>
The world to gaze upon those northern lights<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;<br/>
He had also stood at times behind the throne&mdash;<br/>
But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.

</p>
<p>
He saw, however, at the closing session,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That noble sight, when really free the nation,<br/>
A king in constitutional possession<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such a throne as is the proudest station,<br/>
Though despots know it not&mdash;till the progression<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of freedom shall complete their education.<br/>
'T is not mere splendour makes the show august<br/>
To eye or heart&mdash;it is the people's trust.

</p>
<p>
There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,<br/>
With fascination in his very bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of promise, as the spring of prime.<br/>
Though royalty was written on his brow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,<br/>
Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,<br/>
A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.

</p>
<p>
And Juan was received, as hath been said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the best society: and there<br/>
Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However disciplined and debonnaire:&mdash;<br/>
The talent and good humour he display'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,<br/>
Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,<br/>
Even though himself avoided the occasion.

</p>
<p>
But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not to be put hastily together;<br/>
And as my object is morality<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Whatever people say), I don't know whether<br/>
I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But harrow up his feelings till they wither,<br/>
And hew out a huge monument of pathos,<br/>
As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.

</p>
<p>
Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ends. When the body of the book 's begun,<br/>
You 'll find it of a different construction<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From what some people say 't will be when done:<br/>
The plan at present 's simply in concoction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;<br/>
That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit<br/>
Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.

</p>
<p>
And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, reader! you have had before<br/>
The worst of tempests and the best of battles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,<br/>
Besides the most sublime of<br/>
&mdash;Heaven knows what else:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An usurer could scarce expect much more&mdash;<br/>
But my best canto, save one on astronomy,<br/>
Will turn upon 'political economy.'

</p>
<p>
That is your present theme for popularity:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,<br/>
It grows an act of patriotic charity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To show the people the best way to break.<br/>
My plan (but I, if but for singularity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve it) will be very sure to take.<br/>
Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,<br/>
And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.
