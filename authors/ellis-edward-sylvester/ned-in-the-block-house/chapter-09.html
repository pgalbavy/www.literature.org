<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Having hurled his tomahawk with such venomous force at the vanishing
fugitive, the baffled Wyandot, for the first time, seemed to think
of his own safety.</p>

<p>The momentum of his furious pursuit carried him almost against
the door of the block-house and directly beneath the overhanging
floor, built so as to allow the defenders to fire down on the
heads of their assailants. The rapid shifting of position served
to confuse the garrison to a certain extent, but the action of
the Indian was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Making a sharp turn to the left, he ran with astonishing swiftness
along the front of the building and stockade, until he was half
way to the north-western angle, around which he had only to dart
to be beyond reach of any bullet; but he seemed to think all at
once that he had made a mistake. He stopped like a flash, turned
with inconceivable quickness, and sped directly over the ground
he had traversed, passing in front of the stockade and the block-house,
his evident purpose being to reach the deserted cabin from which
he had emerged in the first place.</p>

<p>As he was running with tremendous speed in front of the building,
another gun was discharged at him, but he showed no sign of being
harmed, and, without a second's hesitation, made for the cabin,
where a brother brave awaited him.</p>

<p>"I consider that that 'ere beats all creation!" exclaimed Jo
Stinger, aggravated over the repeated escapes of the daring redskin;
"all I want is a chance to get a pop at him."</p>

<p>There was little time to spare, for the movements of the Wyandot
proved him to be no ordinary athlete, and he was going for the
open window of the cabin, like the wind.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, by the utmost haste, beat him in the novel contest,
and, thrusting his gun hastily through the loophole, aimed and
fired with unusual nervousness.</p>

<p>"I struck him!" he exclaimed in great glee, as the warrior sprang
in air, as if shot upward by a catapult.</p>

<p>"You haven't harmed a hair of his head!" laughed Jim Turner,
who was peering through one of the loopholes; "it wasn't your
bullet that made him jump."</p>

<p>"You're right," muttered the chagrined scout; "if I had another
gun, I would break this one to pieces."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the fault of your <em>rifle</em>," was the truthful
remark of his companion.</p>

<p>At the very moment Jo Stinger took his hasty aim and fired his
gun, the fleeing Wyandot was so near the cabin that he bounded
upward from the ground and went through the door, as the performer
in the circus bounds through the hoop covered with paper.</p>

<p>The bullet which so rarely missed its mark did so in this instance
by a hair's-breadth; but under such circumstances, a miss was
as good as a mile, and the courageous Wyandot plunged through
the entrance without a scratch, or so much as the "smell of fire"
about his garments.</p>

<p>He had played a most desperate game and won so brilliantly that
the veteran Jo Stinger, while exasperated over his own failure,
felt like cheering the exploit.</p>

<p>The safety of the brave seemed to be the signal for a general
fire along the lines. The Wyandots began discharging their rifles
from the wood beyond the stockade, north, east and south, while
Deerfoot was somewhat alarmed to hear several shots from the river
bank where he was crouching, and at no great distance from him.</p>

<p>A number crept up to the rear of the nearest cabin, into which
they entered without much danger to themselves, and from the windows
of which they discharged their pieces at the block-house. This
seemed a useless expenditure of ammunition, but there was a chance
or two of doing something. Some of the bullets sent from the woods
and cabins might enter a loophole: a number did pass through the
narrow windows and were buried in the heavy logs beyond.</p>

<p>Unless the inmates were specially careful, one or more of these
invisible messengers would strike them, and it was this hope which
led the assailants to keep up the desultory firing for more than
an hour succeeding the remarkable incidents on the clearing.</p>

<p>The garrison did not throw away their ammunition: they kept a
sharp lookout for signs of their enemies, and, when there was
a chance of doing execution, they were quick to take advantage
of it, but there was no shooting at random, as is too often the
case, under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>While these dropping shots were heard from many different points,
the figure of the fallen Wyandot was stretched on the clearing
in front of the block-house. It lay flat on its back, with the
swarthy face turned upward, still and motionless, and an impressive
evidence of the frightful and inexcusable enmity of the members
of the same human family toward each other.</p>

<p>No one ventured to approach it, although the American Indian
leaves no effort untried to remove his dead from the battle-ground.
They would have gone forward on the present occasion to withdraw
the remains, but they could not expect immunity from the rifles
of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the dead warrior must wait until the
darkness of the night, which is the chosen season of his race
for carrying out his designs against all enemies.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger, who had followed the trail and lived in the woods
for many years, was intensely mortified over his failure, and
carefully reloading his gun, resolved that the blunder on his
part should be retrieved.</p>

<p>He cautioned the new arrivals, and especially the children of
Mrs. Preston, to keep away from the loopholes, through which the
leaden missiles were likely to come any moment, on their mission
of death. The good mother was too sensible of the peril to which
they were all exposed, to allow her children to run any risk that
could be avoided: there were places both above and below stairs,
where no bullet could penetrate, and she made certain that her
children never wandered beyond these somewhat narrow limits.</p>

<p>As soon as the door was securely fastened behind the entrance
of Blossom Brown and Ned Preston, the Colonel, who, of course,
was on the lower floor, grasped each in turn by the hand and congratulated
them most warmly. Mrs. Preston, as soon as it was safe, descended
the ladder and joined in the expressions of thankfulness.</p>

<p>Both the boys were panting from their tremendous exertions, and
they sat down each on a chair until they could recover breath.
As Ned drew forth the letters from his inner pocket and handed
them to the Colonel, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was the hardest struggle of my life; I never want to go through
such another."</p>

<p>"Are you hurt in any way?" asked his aunt, laying her hand on
the head of her nephew, who had taken off his cap and was drawing
his handkerchief across his forehead.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, and I thank heaven, for, when that Wyandot
let drive his tomahawk, it came like a cannon-ball, and if it
hadn't struck my rifle-barrel as it did, it would have ended my
days. I wonder whether it hurt the gun," suddenly added Ned, with
that rapid transition from one subject to another which is characteristic
of boyhood.</p>

<p>He examined the weapon, but although the brown barrel was pretty
well scraped, it showed no real injury, and, in accordance with
the teachings of his father, Ned now proceeded to reload the piece,
while the dull reports of the guns, overhead and along the edge
of the woods and the bank of the river, were heard.</p>

<p>By this time, Blossom Brown had recovered his breath, and he
imitated the example of his young master. When he had completed
his task, he regained a great deal of his assurance.</p>

<p>"Tings was sort ob lively for a while," he remarked in his offhand
manner, as though there was nothing remarkable in their escape,
"but I knowed we was comin' out all right."</p>

<p>"How could you know that," asked the surprised Mrs. Preston,
"when we could not be certain, until you were both within the
house?"</p>

<p>"I seed from de way dat Injine drawed back his tomahawk and squinted
his eye, dat he wasn't goin' to shoot straight, and I knowed too
dat de tomahawk was gwine to glance along de barrel jes' as it
did, which am why I moved off to one side so dat it wouldn't tech
me."</p>

<p>"That won't do," said Ned, with a shake of the head; "you knew
just as much as I did, which was nothing at all."</p>

<p>"P'raps I did and p'raps I didn't," said Blossom in his loftiest
manner, throwing his head back; "I neber brag ob what I'm doin',
but I show from de way I act dat I knows what's what. I seed dat
tings was gettin' mixed, and so I started for de house to impress
de Colonel how it was and to git him to manage tings right."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mary and Susie Preston hurried down the ladder
to greet their cousin.</p>

<p>"O Ned!" they shouted together, as they came near tumbling through
the rounds; "we're so glad to see you!"</p>

<p>And the words were scarcely out of their mouths, when Susie,
the younger, leaped from the middle round straight into the arms
of Ned, which were outspread to receive her. Mary embraced the
waist of the sturdy lad and insisted on attention. So Ned, after
kissing the younger several times, set her down on the floor and
did the same with the elder. Then he resumed his chair, and, holding
them on his knees, laughed and talked as though he had passed
through no such fearful scene as we have described, and as though
no peril was yet impending over their heads.</p>

<p>"I knew the wicked Indians wouldn't hurt you," said little Susie,
turning her pretty face up to that of her cousin.</p>

<p>"And how could you know that, little one?"</p>

<p>"'Cause Mary and I prayed to God, when we saw you coming across
the clearing, to take care of you."</p>

<p>"Well, I prayed hard too," said Ned, "and then did the best I
knew how, and I think God always takes care of those who do that:
it isn't any use of praying unless you try to help yourselves."</p>

<p>This was orthodox, though the sentiment was not very original,
and the little sisters subscribed to it as fully as though they
had been taught it at their mother's knee.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston had delivered the letters to the parties to whom
they belonged, and had read his own. He had looked out for the
opportunity to use his gun, but saw none, and he now turned about
and gave his whole attention to his "recruits."</p>

<p>"Where is Deerfoot?" was his first natural question.</p>

<p>"He was on the edge of the clearing, when we left, and I suppose
he is there yet, unless the Wyandots have driven him out."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely he has been allowed to stay there long, for
I notice that some of the shots come from that direction. How
was it he befriended you as he did?"</p>

<p>"He is a great friend of mine, you know, Uncle."</p>

<p>"That isn't what I mean; how was it he brought you here and helped
you to enter the block-house?"</p>

<p>In a few words, Ned Preston told the story which is already known
to the reader. Before it was finished, the Colonel saw plainly
the purpose of the Shawanoe youth.</p>

<p>"He believed there was instant necessity for me to have more
guns at command, and that was why he used such great exertion
to run you in."</p>

<p>"Do you think he did right, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"I must say I cannot see the necessity of his taking such terrible
risks, when your help, although very welcome, was not so all important
that our lives depended on it. Inasmuch as all of you were safely
on the outside, where Jo Stinger tried so hard to get, it would
have been the wiser plan, in my opinion, for you to have made
all haste to Wild Oaks: the distance is not so great that you
could not have brought help to us within two or three days."</p>

<p>"That is just the way I put the case to Deerfoot; but he insisted
that the first thing to be done was to place us inside the block-house,
and nothing could change his view. He knows so much more about
such things than we, that I could not refuse to do as he wished."</p>

<p>"He may have had reasons which he has not made known, for he
is an extraordinary Indian, although still a boy."</p>

<p>"That arrow which came through the window was a surprise, was
it not?"</p>

<p>"A very great one: no one had any thought that it was anything
other than a hostile one. I supposed it was intended to set fire
to the building."</p>

<p>"Did you see it coming?"</p>

<p>"None of us saw it; but the thud it made, when it struck, told
us its nature, and I went down to find out whether it was likely
to do any damage. The moment my eyes rested on it, I noticed the
paper tied around the shaft: that told the story, of course, and
soon every one within knew the message. Well, you were not long
in getting the signal you asked for, and you know the rest. That
was a wonderful shot of the young Shawanoe."</p>

<p>"And would you believe, Uncle, that he told me after making it,
that, if he had missed sending the arrow through the window, it
would have been the death of all three of us."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"The Wyandots would have found it and would have been quick to
learn what it meant: then, as he said, we were in such a position
that we could not get away from them."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt he spoke the truth, which shows what a fearful
risk he ran; but he must have had great confidence in his ability
to use his bow."</p>

<p>"And he has good reason for his confidence, as he has proven
more than once; but, in spite of all his skill, I cannot help
feeling that he has put himself in a trap from which he cannot
free himself. Because the Wyandots have surrounded the block-house,
and because some of them are always watching it, they must have
seen the flight of the shaft through the air."</p>

<p>"If they did, they could not have known its errand."</p>

<p>"No, but they would recall that none of them use the bow except
to shoot burning arrows, and they would be apt to suspect something
was wrong."</p>

<p>"They often use such things to set fire to buildings."</p>

<p>"But this was not one, as they could have seen with but a single
glance; and, had it been, they would have known all about it,
if it was discharged by one of their own party."</p>

<p>"Ned," said Colonel Preston, "I have been talking against my
own convictions, just to see what you thought about it: I agree
with you. Subtle as the Shawanoe is, beyond any of his years,
he has done a thing for which I cannot see the reason, and I believe
he has placed himself in peril that admits of no escape. If such
proves to be the case, he has also deprived himself of the opportunity
to do us the great service we need."</p>

<p>"'Scuse me," interrupted Blossom Brown, who had been showing
uneasiness for several minutes, and who was now snuffing the air
in a suggestive way; "I tinks I smell corn bread, and I haben't
dined dis mornin' yet."</p>
