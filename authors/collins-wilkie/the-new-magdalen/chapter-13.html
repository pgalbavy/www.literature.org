<P>
A WEEK has passed. The scene opens again in the dining-room at
Mablethorpe House.
<P>
The hospitable table bears once more its burden of good things
for lunch. But on this occasion Lady Janet sits alone. Her
attention is divided between reading her newspaper and feeding
her cat. The cat is a sleek and splendid creature. He carries an
erect tail. He rolls luxuriously on the soft carpet. He
approaches his mistress in a series of coquettish curves. He
smells with dainty hesitation at the choicest morsels that can be
offered to him. The musical monotony of his purring falls
soothingly on her ladyship's ear. She stops in the middle of a
leading article and looks with a careworn face at the happy cat.
"Upon my honor," cries Lady Janet, thinking, in her inveterately
ironical manner, of the cares that trouble her, "all things
considered, Tom, I wish I was You!"
<P>
The cat starts--not at his mistress's complimentary apostrophe,
but at a knock at the door, which follows close upon it. Lady
Janet says, carelessly enough, "Come in;" looks round listlessly
to see who it is; and starts, like the cat, when the door opens
and discloses--Julian Gray!
<P>
"You--or your ghost?" she exclaims.
<P>
She has noticed already that Julian is paler than usual, and that
there is something in his manner at once uneasy and
subdued--highly uncharacteristic of him at other times. He takes
a seat by her side, and kisses her hand. But--for the first time
in his aunt's experience of him--he refuses the good things on
the luncheon table, and he has nothing to say to the cat! That
neglected animal takes refuge on Lady Janet's lap. Lady Janet,
with her eyes fixed expectantly on her nephew (determining to
"have it out of him" at the first opportunity), waits to hear
what he has to say for himself. Julian has no alternative but to
break the silence, and tell his story as he best may.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"I got back from the Continent last night," he began. "And I come
here, as I promised, to report myself on my return. How does your
ladyship do? How is Miss Roseberry?"
<P>
Lady Janet laid an indicative finger on the lace pelerine which
ornamented the upper part of her dress. "Here is the old lady,
well," she answered--and pointed next to the room above them.
"And there," she added, "is the young lady, ill. Is anything the
matter with _you_, Julian?"
<P>
"Perhaps I am a little tired after my journey. Never mind me. Is
Miss Roseberry still suffering from the shock?"
<P>
"What else should she be suffering from? I will never forgive
you, Julian, for bringing that crazy impostor into my house."
<P>
"My dear aunt, when I was the innocent means of bringing her here
I had no idea that such a person as Miss Roseberry was in
existence. Nobody laments what has happened more sincerely than I
do. Have you had medical advice?"
<P>
"I took her to the sea-side a week since by medical advice."
<P>
"Has the change of air don e her no good?"
<P>
"None whatever. If anything, the change of air has made her
worse. Sometimes she sits for hours together, as pale as death,
without looking at anything, and without uttering a word.
Sometimes she brightens up, and seems as if she was eager to say
something; and then Heaven only knows why, checks herself
suddenly as if she was afraid to speak. I could support that. But
what cuts me to the heart, Julian, is, that she does not appear
to trust me and to love me as she did. She seems to be doubtful
of me; she seems to be frightened of me. If I did not know that
it was simply impossible that such a thing could be, I should
really think she suspected me of believing what that wretch said
of her. In one word (and between ourselves), I begin to fear she
will never get over the fright which caused that fainting-fit.
There is serious mischief somewhere; and, try as I may to
discover it, it is mischief beyond my finding."
<P>
"Can the doctor do nothing?"
<P>
Lady Janet's bright black eyes answered before she replied in
words, with a look of supreme contempt.
<P>
"The doctor!" she repeated, disdainfully. "I brought Grace back
last night in sheer despair, and I sent for the doctor this
morning. He is at the head of his profession; he is said to be
making ten thousand a year; and he knows no more about it than I
do. I am quite serious. The great physician has just gone away
with two guineas in his pocket. One guinea, for advising me to
keep her quiet; another guinea for telling me to trust to time.
Do you wonder how he gets on at this rate? My dear boy, they all
get on in the same way. The medical profession thrives on two
incurable diseases in these modern days--a He-disease and a
She-disease. She-disease--nervous depression;
He-disease--suppressed gout. Remedies, one guinea, if _you_ go to
the doctor; two guineas if the doctor goes to _you_. I might have
bought a new bonnet," cried her ladyship, indignantly, "with the
money I have given to that man! Let us change the subject. I lose
my temper when I think of it. Besides, I want to know something.
Why did you go abroad?"
<P>
At that plain question Julian looked unaffectedly surprised. "I
wrote to explain," he said. "Have you not received my letter?"
<P>
"Oh, I got your letter. It was long enough, in all conscience;
and, long as it was, it didn't tell me the one thing I wanted to
know."
<P>
"What is the 'one thing'?"
<P>
Lady Janet's reply pointed--not too palpably at first--at that
second motive for Julian's journey which she had suspected Julian
of concealing from her.
<P>
"I want to know," she said, "why you troubled yourself to make
your inquiries on the Continent _in person?_ You know where my
old courier is to be found. You have yourself pronounced him to
be the most intelligent and trustworthy of men. Answer me
honestly--could you not have sent him in your place?"
<P>
"I _might_ have sent him," Julian admitted, a little reluctantly.
<P>
"You might have sent the courier--and you were under an
engagement to stay here as my guest. Answer me honestly once
more. Why did you go away?"
<P>
Julian hesitated. Lady Janet paused for his reply, with the air
of a women who was prepared to wait (if necessary) for the rest
of the afternoon.
<P>
"I had a reason of my own for going," Julian said at last.
<P>
"Yes?" rejoined Lady Janet, prepared to wait (if necessary) till
the next morning.
<P>
"A reason," Julian resumed, "which I would rather not mention."
<P>
"Oh!" said Lady Janet. "Another mystery--eh? And another woman at
the bottom of it, no doubt. Thank you--that will do--I am
sufficiently answered. No wonder, as a clergyman, that you look a
little confused. There is, perhaps, a certain grace, under the
circumstances, in looking confused. We will change the subject
again. You stay here, of course, now you have come back?"
<P>
Once more the famous pulpit orator seemed to find himself in the
inconceivable predicament of not knowing what to say. Once more
Lady Janet looked resigned to wait (if necessary) until the
middle of next week.
<P>
Julian took refuge in an answer worthy of the most commonplace
man on the face of the civilized earth.
<P>
"I beg your ladyship to accept my thanks and my excuses," he
said.
<P>
Lady Janet's many-ringed fingers, mechanically stroking the cat
in her lap, began to stroke him the wrong way.
<P>
Lady Janet's inexhaustible patience showed signs of failing her
at last.
<P>
"Mighty civil, I am sure," she said. "Make it complete. Say, Mr.
Julian Gray presents his compliments to Lady Janet Roy, and
regrets that a previous engagement-- Julian!" exclaimed the old
lady, suddenly pushing the cat off her lap, and flinging her last
pretense of good temper to the winds--"Julian, I am not to be
trifled with! There is but one explanation of your conduct--you
are evidently avoiding my house. Is there somebody you dislike in
it? Is it me?"
<P>
Julian intimated by a gesture that his aunt's last question was
absurd. (The much-injured cat elevated his back, waved his tail
slowly, walked to the fireplace, and honored the rug by taking a
seat on it.)
<P>
Lady Janet persisted. "Is it Grace Roseberry?" she asked next.
<P>
Even Julian's patience began to show signs of yielding. His
manner assumed a sudden decision, his voice rose a tone louder.
<P>
"You insist on knowing?" he said. "It _is_ Miss Roseberry."
<P>
"You don't like her?" cried Lady Janet, with a sudden burst of
angry surprise.
<P>
Julian broke out, on his side: "If I see any more of her," he
answered, the rare color mounting passionately in his cheeks, "I
shall be the unhappiest man living. If I see any more of her, I
shall be false to my old friend, who is to marry her. Keep us
apart. If you have any regard for my peace of mind, keep us
apart."
<P>
Unutterable amazement expressed itself in his aunt's lifted
hands. Ungovernable curiosity uttered itself in his aunt's next
words.
<P>
"You don't mean to tell me you are in love with Grace?"
<P>
Julian sprung restlessly to his feet, and disturbed the cat at
the fireplace. (The cat left the room.)
<P>
"I don't know what to tell you," he said; "I can't realize it to
myself. No other woman has ever roused the feeling in me which
this woman seems to have called to life in an instant. In the
hope of forgetting her I broke my engagement here; I purposely
seized the opportunity of making those inquiries abroad. Quite
useless. I think of her, morning, noon, and night. I see her and
hear her, at this moment, as plainly as I see and hear you. She
has made _her_self a part of _my_self. I don't understand my life
without her. My power of will seems to be gone. I said to myself
this morning, 'I will write to my aunt; I won't go back to
Mablethorpe House.' Here I am in Mablethorpe House, with a mean
subterfuge to justify me to my own conscience. 'I owe it to my
aunt to call on my aunt.' That is what I said to myself on the
way here; and I was secretly hoping every step of the way that
she would come into the room when I got here. I am hoping it now.
And she is engaged to Horace Holmcroft--to my oldest friend, to
my best friend! Am I an infernal rascal? or am I a weak fool? God
knows--I don't. Keep my secret, aunt. I am heartily ashamed of
myself; I used to think I was made of better stuff than this.
Don't say a word to Horace. I must, and will, conquer it. Let me
go."
<P>
He snatched up his hat. Lady Janet, rising with the activity of a
young woman, pursued him across the room, and stopped him at the
door.
<P>
"No," answered the resolute old lady, "I won't let you go. Come
back with me."
<P>
As she said those words she noticed with a certain fond pride the
brilliant color mounting in his cheeks--the flashing brightness
which lent an added luster to his eyes. He had never, to her
mind, looked so handsome before. She took his arm, and led him to
the chairs which they had just left. It was shocking, it was
wrong (she mentally admitted) to look on Mercy, under the
circumstances, with any other eye than the eye of a brother or a
friend. In a clergyman (perhaps) doubly shocking, doubly wrong.
But, with all her respect for the vested interests of Horace,
Lady Janet could not blame Julian. Worse still, she was privately
conscious that he had, somehow or other, risen, rather than
fallen, in her estima tion within the last minute or two. Who
could deny that her adopted daughter was a charming creature? Who
could wonder if a man of refined tastes admired her? Upon the
whole, her ladyship humanely decided that her nephew was rather
to be pitied than blamed. What daughter of Eve (no matter whether
she was seventeen or seventy) could have honestly arrived at any
other conclusion? Do what a man may--let him commit anything he
likes, from an error to a crime--so long as there is a woman at
the bottom of it, there is an inexhaustible fund of pardon for
him in every other woman's heart. "Sit down," said Lady Janet,
smiling in spite of herself; "and don't talk in that horrible way
again. A man, Julian--especially a famous man like you--ought to
know how to control himself."
<P>
Julian burst out laughing bitterly.
<P>
"Send upstairs for my self-control," he said. "It's in _her_
possession--not in mine. Good morning, aunt."
<P>
He rose from his chair. Lady Janet instantly pushed him back into
it.
<P>
"I insist on your staying here," she said, "if it is only for a
few minutes longer. I have something to say to you."
<P>
"Does it refer to Miss Roseberry?"
<P>
"It refers to the hateful woman who frightened Miss Roseberry.
Now are you satisfied?"
<P>
Julian bowed, and settled himself in his chair.
<P>
"I don't much like to acknowledge it," his aunt went on. "But I
want you to understand that I have something really serious to
speak about, for once in a way. Julian! that wretch not only
frightens Grace--she actually frightens me."
<P>
"Frightens you? She is quite harmless, poor thing."
<P>
"'Poor thing'!" repeated Lady Janet. "Did you say 'poor thing'?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Is it possible that you pity her?"
<P>
"From the bottom of my heart."
<P>
The old lady's temper gave way again at that reply. "I hate a man
who can't hate anybody!" she burst out. "If you had been an
ancient Roman, Julian, I believe you would have pitied Nero
himself."
<P>
Julian cordially agreed with her. "I believe I should," he said,
quietly. "All sinners, my dear aunt, are more or less miserable
sinners. Nero must have been one of the wretchedest of mankind."
<P>
"Wretched!" exclaimed Lady Janet. "Nero wretched! A man who
committed robbery, arson and murder to his own violin
accompaniment--_only_ wretched! What next, I wonder? When modern
philanthropy begins to apologize for Nero, modern philanthropy
has arrived at a pretty pass indeed! We shall hear next that
Bloody Queen Mary was as playful as a kitten; and if poor dear
Henry the Eighth carried anything to an extreme, it was the
practice of the domestic virtues. Ah, how I hate cant! What were
we talking about just now? You wander from the subject, Julian;
you are what I call bird-witted. I protest I forget what I wanted
to say to you. No, I won't be reminded of it. I may be an old
woman, but I am not in my dotage yet! Why do you sit there
staring? Have you nothing to say for yourself? Of all the people
in the world, have _you_ lost the use of your tongue?"
<P>
Julian's excellent temper and accurate knowledge of his aunt's
character exactly fitted him to calm the rising storm. He
contrived to lead Lady Janet insensibly back to the lost subject
by dexterous reference to a narrative which he had thus far left
untold--the narrative of his adventures on the Continent.
<P>
"I have a great deal to say, aunt," he replied. "I have not yet
told you of my discoveries abroad."
<P>
Lady Janet instantly took the bait.
<P>
"I knew there was something forgotten," she said. "You have been
all this time in the house, and you have told me nothing. Begin
directly."
<P>
Patient Julian began.
