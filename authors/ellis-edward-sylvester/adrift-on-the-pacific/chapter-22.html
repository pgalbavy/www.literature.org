<p>There, at the front of the oyster, and slightly to one side,
was the most marvelous pearl upon which the eyes of the men had
ever rested. It was the size of an ordinary hen's egg, clear and
pure, and worth a sum of money which neither of the astounded
men dared attempt to guess.</p>

<p>For a few seconds they were speechless, and then Inez clapped
her hands with delight, and asked:</p>

<p>"Is that for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is yours," replied Captain Bergen. "The mate and I
give it to you, to be yours and no one's else."</p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid?" cried Inez, catching it up, passing it from
one hand to the other, holding it up in the sunlight, and showing
as much genuine pleasure as if she were a veritable South Sea
Islander, presented with some new trinket.</p>

<p>"That," said Mate Storms, "may be called The Pearl of the Pacific!"</p>

<p>"No," objected the captain, "it is she who is the pearl of this
great ocean, for it was upon its surface that we first saw her,
and she has proved herself far above the worth of pearls or diamonds
or rubies. To her, under heaven, my life, and not impossibly yours,
is owing. The greatest pleasure of this voyage has come from her
companionship, and all that I ask now is that we shall be able
to preserve this wealth for her, and that the opportunity may
be ours to do our full duty toward her."</p>

<p>Mate Storms looked admiringly at the captain, who had so eloquently
expressed his own sentiments.</p>

<p>"You are right, Jack," said he, speaking in his familiar way.
"It is she who is the Pearl of the Pacific!"</p>

<p>The men surveyed, with the greatest pleasure, the frolicsome
delight of the little one, who was all unmindful of the immense
treasure which had fallen to her lot, and of the title of honor
which her friends had given her. Naturally, the entire party were
so absorbed that for a time they hardly glanced beyond their immediate
surroundings; but when Abe Storms came up for the last time, he
glanced, by the merest accident, out to sea, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness! Just look there, Jack!"</p>

<p>No more than half a mile distant, a flying proa was seen, speeding
with great swiftness over the water, while a number of dark figures
were discovered on the deck, evidently looking with no little
curiosity at the white men.</p>

<p>The singular craft, however, came no nearer, and soon vanished
in the distance. Its appearance caused some apprehension and uneasiness
on the part of our friends, and after discussing the matter they
decided, as a matter of precaution, to bury the pearls.</p>

<p>Inez was persuaded, without difficulty, to trust hers to the
keeping of her friends, who dug a small well in the sand, and
inclosing the entire number of pearls in strong canvas bags, made
for that purpose, buried them out of sight, there to remain until
one or both of the men should choose to dig them up again, and
it was agreed that that should not be done until the way opened
for them to leave the island.</p>

<p>The long afternoon was well advanced when this task was completed,
they fixing the precise spot so clearly in their minds that there
was no necessity of landmarks, either being sure of finding it
whenever it should become necessary.</p>

<p>"It seems to me the swells are larger than usual, and they make
more noise when they break upon the beach," observed Mr. Storms,
looking curiously at the sky.</p>

<p>They had just dumped back the remains of the pearl-oysters into
the sea, so as to leave no trace of their work, and Captain Bergen
straightened up and surveyed the sky.</p>

<p>"There's a storm coming&mdash;a regular screamer! Look, by the great
horn spoon!" he added, in no little excitement.</p>

<p>There was good cause for the emotion of the captain, for the
light of the sun was obscured by a thick, yellow haze, which was
fast overspreading the sky, and, far out to sea, the long line
of mist seemed to be churning the water into foam, and to be advancing
rapidly toward the island, where stood the two men contemplating
the coming fury of the elements.</p>

<p>The light of the sun was obscured, and there was a perceptible
chilliness in the air, and the barometer&mdash;which they had brought
from the <em>Coral</em>&mdash;showed a most startling change. One of
the fiercest of the tropical tempests was gathering, and was sure
to break upon the island in a few minutes.</p>

<p>This was alarming to contemplate, for the men knew well what
kind of elemental disturbances spring up on the shortest notice
in the South Seas. But it was not this alone which startled them.</p>

<p>Looking directly out to sea, toward the yeasty waters, they saw
a schooner sinking and rising upon the long swells, and certain
to be caught, in the very vortex, as may be said, of the hurricane,
or tornado, or typhoon, or whatever it should be termed. The craft
was not an unfamiliar one&mdash;both knew it well&mdash;for it was the <em>Coral</em>,
with the mutineers on board.</p>

<p>Unarmed as they were, they would not dare place themselves in
the power of those toward whom they had shown such enmity, but
that they were literally forced to do so to escape almost certain
destruction from the impending tempest.</p>

<p>If they should run into the lagoon to wait until the storm should
subside, neither the captain nor mate would disturb them&mdash;provided
they took their departure as soon as it became safe. Still, knowing
their treacherous character so well, Bergen and Storms did not
mean to trust them at all. Inez was therefore placed within the
cabin, while her protectors made certain they were armed and ready
for any contingency.</p>

<p>Now that the sun was shut out from sight, a darkness like that
of night overspread land and water, while the strong gale howled
among the palms, which swayed and bent as if they would soon be
uprooted and flung out into the boiling sea. The swells were topped
with foam, and large drops of rain, sweeping almost horizontally
across the island, struck against the face like pebbles.</p>

<p>The mutineers were heading, so far as was possible, towards the
opening in the atoll, but they were not in position to strike
it, and, with the deepening darkness and increasing tempest, the
task was becoming more difficult every minute. Suddenly a vivid
flash of lightning illumined the gloom, and the schooner <em>Coral</em>
was observed on the crest of a high wave, heading toward the island;
but the two men who saw her, saw also, that she missed the opening
and was too close in to make it.</p>

<p>The rumble of thunder continued for some minutes, when once more
a blinding flash swept across the murky sky, lighting up sea and
island for the instant, as if with the glare of the noonday sun.
Captain Bergen and Mate Storms were straining their eyes to catch
sight of the little schooner and its crew, but it was invisible.
In that single searching glance, they could not have failed to
see her had she been afloat. The conclusion, therefore, was inevitable.
She and her crew had gone to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. The mutineers had met a frightful though merited
fate, and could trouble our friends no more.</p>
