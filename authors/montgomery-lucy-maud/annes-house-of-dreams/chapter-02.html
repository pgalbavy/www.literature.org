<P>
There was more excitement in the air of Green Gables
than there had ever been before in all its history. 
Even Marilla was so excited that she couldn't help
showing it--which was little short of being phenomenal.
<P>
"There's never been a wedding in this house," she
said, half apologetically, to Mrs. Rachel Lynde. 
"When I was a child I heard an old minister say that a
house was not a real home until it had been consecrated
by a birth, a wedding and a death.  We've had deaths
here--my father and mother died here as well as
Matthew; and we've even had a birth here.  Long ago,
just after we moved into this house, we had a married
hired man for a little while, and his wife had a baby
here.  But there's never been a wedding before.  It
does seem so strange to think of Anne being married. 
In a way she just seems to me the little girl Matthew
brought home here fourteen years ago.  I can't realize
that she's grown up.  I shall never forget what I felt
when I saw Matthew bringing in a GIRL.  I wonder what
became of the boy we would have got if there hadn't
been a mistake.  I wonder what HIS fate was."
<P>
"Well, it was a fortunate mistake," said Mrs. Rachel
Lynde, "though, mind you, there was a time I didn't
think so--that evening I came up to see Anne and she
treated us to such a scene.  Many things have changed
since then, that's what."
<P>
Mrs. Rachel sighed, and then brisked up again.  When
weddings were in order Mrs. Rachel was ready to let the
dead past bury its dead.
<P>
"I'm going to give Anne two of my cotton warp
spreads," she resumed.  "A tobacco-stripe one and an
apple-leaf one.  She tells me they're getting to be
real fashionable again.  Well, fashion or no fashion, I
don't believe there's anything prettier for a
spare-room bed than a nice apple-leaf spread, that's
what.  I must see about getting them bleached.  I've
had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since Thomas
died, and no doubt they're an awful color.  But
there's a month yet, and dew-bleaching will work
wonders."
<P>
Only a month!  Marilla sighed and then said proudly:
<P>
"I'm giving Anne that half dozen braided rugs I have
in the garret. I never supposed she'd want
them--they're so old-fashioned, and nobody seems to
want anything but hooked mats now.  But she asked me
for them--said she'd rather have them than anything
else for her floors.  They ARE pretty.  I made them of
the nicest rags, and braided them in stripes.  It was
such company these last few winters.  And I'll make
her enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet
for a year.  It seems real strange.  Those blue plum
trees hadn't even a blossom for three years, and I
thought they might as well be cut down.  And this last
spring they were white, and such a crop of plums I
never remember at Green Gables."
<P>
"Well, thank goodness that Anne and Gilbert really are
going to be married after all.  It's what I've always
prayed for," said Mrs. Rachel, in the tone of one who
is comfortably sure that her prayers have availed much. 
"It was a great relief to find out that she really
didn't mean to take the Kingsport man.  He was rich, to
be sure, and Gilbert is poor--at least, to begin with;
but then he's an Island boy."
<P>
"He's Gilbert Blythe," said Marilla contentedly. 
Marilla would have died the death before she would have
put into words the thought that was always in the
background of her mind whenever she had looked at
Gilbert from his childhood up--the thought that, had it
not been for her own wilful pride long, long ago, he
might have been HER son.  Marilla felt that, in some
strange way, his marriage with Anne would put right
that old mistake.  Good had come out of the evil of the
ancient bitterness.
<P>
As for Anne herself, she was so happy that she almost
felt frightened.  The gods, so says the old
superstition, do not like to behold too happy mortals. 
It is certain, at least, that some human beings do not. 
Two of that ilk descended upon Anne one violet dusk and
proceeded to do what in them lay to prick the rainbow
bubble of her satisfaction.  If she thought she was
getting any particular prize in young Dr. Blythe, or if
she imagined that he was still as infatuated with her
as he might have been in his salad days, it was surely
their duty to put the matter before her in another
light.  Yet these two worthy ladies were not enemies
of Anne; on the contrary, they were really quite fond
of her, and would have defended her as their own young
had anyone else attacked her.  Human nature is not
obliged to be consistent.
<P>
Mrs. Inglis--nee Jane Andrews, to quote from the Daily
Enterprise--came with her mother and Mrs. Jasper Bell. 
But in Jane the milk of human kindness had not been
curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings.  Her lines
had fallen in pleasant places.  In spite of the
fact--as Mrs. Rachel Lynde would say--that she had
married a millionaire, her marriage had been happy. 
Wealth had not spoiled her.  She was still the placid,
amiable, pink-cheeked Jane of the old quartette,
sympathising with her old chum's happiness and as
keenly interested in all the dainty details of Anne's
trousseau as if it could rival her own silken and
bejewelled splendors.  Jane was not brilliant, and had
probably never made a remark worth listening to in her
life; but she never said anything that would hurt
anyone's feelings-- which may be a negative talent but
is likewise a rare and enviable one.
<P>
"So Gilbert didn't go back on you after all," said
Mrs. Harmon Andrews, contriving to convey an expression
of surprise in her tone.  "Well, the Blythes generally
keep their word when they've once passed it, no matter
what happens.  Let me see--you're twenty-five, aren't
you, Anne?  When I was a girl twenty-five was the first
corner.  But you look quite young.  Red-headed people
always do."
<P>
"Red hair is very fashionable now," said Anne, trying
to smile, but speaking rather coldly.  Life had
developed in her a sense of humor which helped her over
many difficulties; but as yet nothing had availed to
steel her against a reference to her hair.
<P>
"So it is--so it is," conceded Mrs. Harmon.  "There's
no telling what queer freaks fashion will take.  Well,
Anne, your things are very pretty, and very suitable to
your position in life, aren't they, Jane?  I hope
you'll be very happy.  You have my best wishes, I'm
sure.  A long engagement doesn't often turn out well. 
But, of course, in your case it couldn't be helped."
<P>
"Gilbert looks very young for a doctor.  I'm afraid
people won't have much confidence in him," said Mrs.
Jasper Bell gloomily.  Then she shut her mouth tightly,
as if she had said what she considered it her duty to
say and held her conscience clear.  She belonged to the
type which always has a stringy black feather in its
hat and straggling locks of hair on its neck.
<P>
Anne's surface pleasure in her pretty bridal things was
temporarily shadowed; but the deeps of happiness below
could not thus be disturbed; and the little stings of
Mesdames Bell and Andrews were forgotten when Gilbert
came later, and they wandered down to the birches of
the brook, which had been saplings when Anne had come
to Green Gables, but were now tall, ivory columns in a
fairy palace of twilight and stars.  In their shadows
Anne and Gilbert talked in lover-fashion of their new
home and their new life together.
<P>
"I've found a nest for us, Anne."
<P>
"Oh, where?  Not right in the village, I hope.  I
wouldn't like that altogether."
<P>
"No.  There was no house to be had in the village. 
This is a little white house on the harbor shore, half
way between Glen St. Mary and Four Winds Point.  It's a
little out of the way, but when we get a 'phone in that
won't matter so much.  The situation is beautiful.  It
looks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor
before it.  The sand-dunes aren't very far away--the
sea winds blow over them and the sea spray drenches
them."
<P>
"But the house itself, Gilbert,--OUR first home?  What
is it like?"
<P>
"Not very large, but large enough for us.  There's a
splendid living room with a fireplace in it downstairs,
and a dining room that looks out on the harbor, and a
little room that will do for my office.  It is about
sixty years old--the oldest house in Four Winds.  But
it has been kept in pretty good repair, and was all
done over about fifteen years ago--shingled, plastered
and re-floored.  It was well built to begin with.  I
understand that there was some romantic story connected
with its building, but the man I rented it from didn't
know it.
<P>
He said Captain Jim was the only one who could spin
that old yarn now."
<P>
"Who is Captain Jim?"
<P>
"The keeper of the lighthouse on Four Winds Point. 
You'll love that Four Winds light, Anne.  It's a
revolving one, and it flashes like a magnificent star
through the twilights.  We can see it from our living
room windows and our front door."
<P>
"Who owns the house?"
<P>
"Well, it's the property of the Glen St. Mary
Presbyterian Church now, and I rented it from the
trustees.  But it belonged until lately to a very old
lady, Miss Elizabeth Russell.  She died last spring,
and as she had no near relatives she left her property
to the Glen St. Mary Church.  Her furniture is still in
the house, and I bought most of it--for a mere song you
might say, because it was all so old- fashioned that
the trustees despaired of selling it.  Glen St. Mary
folks prefer plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors
and ornamentations, I fancy.  But Miss Russell's
furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like it,
Anne."
<P>
"So far, good," said Anne, nodding cautious approval. 
"But, Gilbert, people cannot live by furniture alone. 
You haven't yet mentioned one very important thing. 
Are there TREES about this house?"
<P>
"Heaps of them, oh, dryad!  There is a big grove of
fir trees behind it, two rows of Lombardy poplars down
the lane, and a ring of white birches around a very
delightful garden.  Our front door opens right into the
garden, but there is another entrance--a little gate
hung between two firs.  The hinges are on one trunk and
the catch on the other.  Their boughs form an arch
overhead."
<P>
"Oh, I'm so glad!  I couldn't live where there were no
trees-- something vital in me would starve.  Well,
after that, there's no use asking you if there's a
brook anywhere near.  THAT would be expecting too
much."
<P>
"But there IS a brook--and it actually cuts across one
corner of the garden."
<P>
"Then," said Anne, with a long sigh of supreme
satisfaction, "this house you have found IS my house
of dreams and none other."
