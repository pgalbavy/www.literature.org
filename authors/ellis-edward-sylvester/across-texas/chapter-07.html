<p><em>THE </em>minutes pass slowly at such times, and, though Herbert’s
duty lasted only two hours, they seemed double the length of that
period during the day, or when his companions were awake.</p>

<p>The listening ear caught no further sounds of the multitudinous
feet, and he dismissed the matter from his mind. The still air
now and then was moved by what seemed a slight breeze, or eddy
of wind, but it was barely sufficient to stir the blaze. Once
he heard the report of a gun, startlingly distinct, though he
knew it might have been fired fully a mile away.</p>

<p>"We are not the only people in this part of the world," he mused,
giving expression to his reveries; "and that shot may have ended
the life of some person."</p>

<p>It was a disturbing thought, and, as if to drive off the oppressiveness
that was weighing him down, he rose to his feet and threw more
sticks on the flames. His watch showed that it was only half-past
twelve. He held the time-piece to his ear, suspecting that it
had stopped running; but the familiar ticking was audible, and
a glance at the tiny second-hand showed that it was really moving,
though it never seemed to creep so tardily around the little circle.</p>

<p>Then he watched the indicator as it marked its course, and resorted
to the many artifices that occur to those who find time dragging
wearily on their hands. No hour ever seemed longer than was required
for the watch to show that a fourth of that time had passed forever.</p>

<p>"But it will be worse for Nick," he concluded; "I think his task
more wearisome than mine. We have all to take our share, however,
as I suppose everyone must in the good and bad of life."</p>

<p>Herbert waited till the full time was up, and several minutes
over, when he stepped to where Nick was lying, and gently shook
his shoulder. He awoke readily, prepared to act his part as sentinel
for the next two hours.</p>

<p>The elder told his friend what had occurred, adding that he discovered
nothing else to disturb him. Then bidding him good-night, he wrapped
himself in his own blanket and lay down with his feet toward the
fire, falling asleep almost as quickly as had the cowboys before
him.</p>

<p>Nick examined his rifle and saw it was ready for instant service,
as was his pistol, with which he had practised until quite expert
in its use. He sat down just beyond the circle of illumination
thrown out by the blaze, for, somehow or other, it always seemed
to him that such a course was not only safer, but that he could
maintain more effective watch by doing so. He was able to see
every one of his friends, while a prowler was not likely to observe
him, unless his approach to camp was such as to place the guardsman
between him and the blaze. In that event, he was quite sure to
notice his outlines against the fire.</p>

<p>That this was a wise proceeding was proven by what followed.</p>

<p>He had been on duty for a half hour or more when he was disturbed
by the same cause that startled Herbert. One of the horses uttered
a slight neigh, giving no other evidence of alarm, if that was
the meaning of the sound.</p>

<p>At this moment Nick was well back, on the opposite of the camp
from the animals. He was therefore confident that if anything
threatened them, he himself was invisible to whatever it might
be.</p>

<p>After listening a few minutes, he decided to investigate for
himself. This he did, not by proceeding in a direct line, as he
could have done, but by making a circle which took him beyond
the light of the fire until nigh enough to observe the animals.</p>

<p>They were on the ground, as though they had cropped their fill,
and now enjoyed rest more than food. They appeared to be reposing
quietly, and he concluded that the slight noise which he had noticed
signified nothing. Horses and other domestic animals often start
in their sleep, as though disturbed by dreams, the same as do
we, and that which Nick heard may have been evidence of the fact.</p>

<p>Still, it is also a truth that men, when in situations of peril,
frequently find it safer to rely more on the acuteness of their
horse than upon their own vigilance. The animal seems to have
his senses sharpened to the finest point, for his master’s good.</p>

<p>"I guess there’s nothing wrong," said Nick to himself, after
inspecting the ponies; "but it is best to act as though danger
always threatens. That’s what Strubell and Lattin say, and everyone
must see its logic."</p>

<p>The fire was now burning so low that he gathered up a lot of
wood and threw it on the flames. While thus employed, his gun
lay on the ground near the feet of Herbert. The thought that,
if any hostile prowler was near, it was the easiest thing in the
world to pick him off, caused a strange feeling to come over the
youthful sentinel, and his relief was great when able to catch
up his gun and slip back in the protecting gloom of the night.</p>

<p>He had taken occasion, while near the fire, to glance at his
watch, and, like his companion, was astonished to learn how brief
the time was that he had been on duty. It was less than half an
hour.</p>

<p>About the same period passed without the most trifling alarm.
Nick studiously held himself in the background, where he moved
slowly about, dreading to sit down, though often tempted to do
so. He knew that so long as he kept the erect posture his senses
would be at command, and it was far easier to do this by motion,
no matter how slight, than by standing still.</p>

<p>He had reached the conclusion that the night was to be as uneventful
as those that had preceded it, when once more one of the ponies
uttered the same sound that had disturbed him before. Nick was
startled, for the belief flashed upon him that this signified
something. There must be some cause for the alarm of the animals,
outside of themselves.</p>

<p>He reflected for a minute upon the most prudent thing to do.
He dismissed the thought of awaking the Texans, for, like Herbert,
he shrank from asking their help until certain it was needed,
for, by so doing, he confessed his own inability to meet the danger,
whatever it might be.</p>

<p>He now determined to make a much larger circuit than before,
his object being to bring the horses between him and the fire.
This would not only show the animals, but was likely to reveal
the disturbing cause. At the same time, Nick himself could remain
in the gloom, where it was hardly possible to be seen. The moon,
which might have interfered with the success of this plan, would
not be above the horizon for several hours to come.</p>

<p>In order to traverse the distance he had in mind, he was forced
to move around several large rocks and bowlders, cross the small
stream which flowed near the camp, and pick his way with the utmost
care. Stillness was necessary above all things.</p>

<p>The darkness, while favorable in many respects, had its disadvantages,
as was quickly proven. At the moment when he believed he was opposite
the ponies, and, therefore, near them, he stepped upon a rolling
stone, and despite his expertness, fell with a thump to the ground.</p>

<p>He was impatient with himself, and could hardly repress an angry
exclamation, for a snuff from one of the animals showed how alert
they were to the slightest disturbance.</p>

<p>"The next thing to be done," reflected Nick, "is to shoot off
my rifle; then the job will be in fine shape."</p>

<p>But, so far as he could judge, no harm had been done, and he
pressed on with greater care than before. It took considerable
time to reach the desired point, but it was attained at last.
The horses were in a direct line with the camp fire, and he began
stealing toward them.</p>

<p>This was the time for extreme caution, for, if the least noise
betrayed him, all chance of success would be destroyed. It may
be doubted, however, whether either of the Texans himself could
have carried out the plan more skilfully than did Nick Ribsam.</p>

<p>When he halted, he was not fifty feet from his own animal, and
had approached him so silently that no one of the ponies was disturbed.
They were silent, as if asleep.</p>

<p>But at the moment when Nick was motionless and carefully studying
the dark figures, whose upper parts were shown against the background
of the fire, he saw one of the animals raise his head higher than
the others and emit a snuff, louder than ever.</p>

<p>"It couldn’t be that I caused that," was the decision of Nick,
who was in a crouching posture; "it’s something else that alarmed
them, and, whatever it is, it is closer to them than I am."</p>

<p>He was right, for hardly had he begun creeping forward, when
the head and shoulders of a man slowly rose between him and the
horses, and in a direct line with the camp fire, which revealed
the upper part of his body as distinctly as if stamped with ink
against the yellow background of flame.</p>

<p>"It’s a white man," was Nick’s conclusion, "and he is there for
no good."</p>

<p>The presence of the intruder now helped the youth in his hurried
but stealthy approach; for, when the horses showed additional
excitement, perhaps, at the coming of a second person, the stranger
would believe it was caused wholly by himself. Apprehending no
approach, too, from the rear, he would give no attention to that
direction, but keep his eye on the camp to be ready for any demonstration
from that quarter.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that he saw Nick when he withdrew beyond
the light, but he had no reason to suspect he had flanked him
and passed round to the other side.</p>

<p>It took the sentinel but a few more minutes to satisfy himself
of the errand of the intruder. Nick’s own pony was approached
and obliged to rise to his feet. The stranger was a horse thief,
making a stealthy raid upon the camp, while all the campers but
one were asleep.</p>

<p>Taking the head of Nick’s horse, he was in the act of flinging
himself upon his bare back, when the youth stepped forward in
the gloom and called out:</p>

<p>"<em>Hands up, quicker than lightning!</em>"</p>

<p>Nick imitated as nearly as he could the voice and manner of one
of the Texans when making a similar startling demand.</p>
