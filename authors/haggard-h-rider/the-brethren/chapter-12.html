<p>Masouda ran forward and prostrated herself at full length, but
Godwin and Wulf stared at the heap, and the heap stared at them.
Then, at some motion of his chin, Masouda arose and said:
</p>
<p>"Strangers, you stand in the presence of the Master, Sinan, Lord
of Death. Kneel, and do homage to the Master."
</p><p>But the brethren stiffened their backs and would not kneel. They
lifted their hands to their brows in salute, but no more.
</p><p>Then from between the black turban and the black cloak came a
hollow voice, speaking in Arabic, and saying:
</p><p>"Are these the men who brought me the lion's skin? Well, what
seek ye, Franks?" They stood silent.
</p><p>"Dread lord," said Masouda, "these knights are but now come from
England over sea, and do not understand our tongue."
</p><p>"Set out their story and their request," said Al-je-bal, "that we
may judge of them."
</p><p>"Dread lord," answered Masouda, "as I sent you word, they say
that they are the kin of a certain knight who in battle saved
the life of him who ruled before you, but is now an inhabitant of
Paradise."
</p><p>"I have heard that there was such a knight," said the voice. "He
was named D'Arcy, and he bore the same cognizance on his
shield--the sign of a skull."
</p><p>"Lord, these brethren are also named D'Arcy, and now they come
to ask your help against Salah-ed-din."
</p><p>At that name the heap stirred as a snake stirs when it hears
danger, and the head erected itself a little beneath the great
turban.
</p><p>"What help, and why?" asked the voice.
</p><p>"Lord, Salah-ed-din has stolen a woman of their house who is his
niece, and these knights, her brothers, ask you to aid them to
recover her."
</p><p>The beady eyes instantly became interested.
</p><p>"Report has been made to me of that story," said the voice; "but
what sign do these Franks show? He who went before me gave a
ring, and with it certain rights in this land, to the knight
D'Arcy who befriended him in danger. Where is that sacred ring,
with which he parted in his foolishness?"
</p><p>Masouda translated, and seeing the warning in her eyes and
remembering her words, the brethren shook their heads, while Wulf
answered:
</p><p>"Our uncle, the knight Sir Andrew, was cut down by the soldiers
of Salah-ed-din, and as he died bade us seek you out. What time
had he to tell us of any ring?"
</p><p>The head sank upon the breast.
</p><p>"I hoped," said Sinan to Masouda, "that they had the ring, and it
was for this reason, woman, that I allowed you to lead these
knights hither, after you had reported of them and their quest to
me from Beirut. It is not well that there should be two holy
Signets in the world, and he who went before me, when he lay
dying, charged me to recover his if that were possible. Let them
go back to their own land and return to me with the ancient ring,
and I will help them."
</p><p>Masouda translated the last sentence only, and again the brethren
shook their heads. This time it was Godwin who spoke.
</p><p>"Our land is far away, O lord, and where shall we find this
long-lost ring? Let not our journey be in vain. O mighty One,
give us justice against Salah-ed-din."
</p><p>"All my years have I sought justice on Salah-ed-din," answered
Sinan, "and yet he prevails against me. Now I make you an offer.
Go, Franks, and bring me his head, or at least put him to death
as I shall show you how, and we will talk again."
</p><p>When they heard this saying Wulf said to Godwin, in English:
</p><p>"I think that we had best go; I do not like this company." But
Godwin made no answer.
</p><p>As they stood silent thus, not knowing what to say, a man entered
through the door, and, throwing himself on his hands and knees,
crawled towards the cushion through the double line of
councillors or dais.
</p><p>"Your report?" said Sinan in Arabic.
</p><p>"Lord," answered the man, "I acquaint you that your will has been
done in the matter of the vessel." Then he went on speaking in a
low voice, so rapidly that the brethren could scarcely hear and
much less understand him.
</p><p>Sinan listened, then said:
</p><p>"Let the fedai enter and make his own report, bringing with him
his prisoners."
</p><p>Now one of the dais, he who sat nearest the canopy, rose and
pointing towards the brethren, said.
</p><p>"Touching these Franks, what is your will?"
</p><p>The beady eyes, which seemed to search out their souls, fixed
themselves upon them and for a long while Sinan considered. They
trembled, knowing that he was passing some judgment concerning
them in his heart, and that on his next words much might
hang--even their lives.
</p><p>"Let them stay here," he said at length. "I may have questions to
ask them."
</p><p>For a time there was silence. Sinan, Lord of Death, seemed to be
lost in thought under the black shade of his canopy; the double
line of dais stared at nothingness across the passage way; the
giant guards stood still as statues; Masouda watched the brethren
from beneath her long eye-lashes, while the brethren watched the
sharp edge of the shadow of the canopy on the marble floor. They
strove to seem unconcerned, but their hearts were beating fast
within them who felt that great things were about to happen,
though what these might be they knew not.
</p><p>So intense was the silence, so dreadful seemed that inhuman,
snake-like man, so strange his aged, passionless councillors, and
the place of council surrounded by a dizzy gulf, that fear took
hold of them like the fear of an evil dream. Godwin wondered if
Sinan could see the ring upon his breast, and what would happen
to him if he did see it; while Wulf longed to shout aloud, to do
anything that would break this deathly, sunlit quiet. To them
those minutes seemed like hours; indeed, for aught they knew,
they might have been hours.
</p><p>At length there was a stir behind the brethren, and at a word
from Masouda they separated, falling apart a pace or two, and
stood opposite each other and sideways to Sinan. Standing thus,
they saw the curtains drawn. Through them came four men, carrying
a stretcher covered with a cloth, beneath which they could see
the outline of a form, that lay there stirless. The four men
brought the stretcher to the front of the canopy, set it on the
ground, prostrated themselves, and retired, walking backwards
down the length of the terrace.
</p><p>Again there was silence, while the brethren wondered whose corpse
it was that lay beneath the cloth, for a corpse it must surely
be; though neither the Lord of the Mountain nor his dais and
guards seemed to concern themselves in the matter. Again the
curtains parted, and a procession advanced up the terrace. First
came a great man clad in a white robe blazoned with the bleeding
dagger, after whom walked a tall woman shrouded in a long veil,
who was followed by a thick-set knight clad in Frankish armour
and wearing a cape of which the cowl covered his head as though
to keep the rays of the sun from beating on his helm. Lastly
walked four guards. Up the long place they marched, through the
double line of dais, while with a strange stirring in their
breasts the brethren watched the shape and movements of the
veiled woman who stepped forward rapidly, not seeing them, for
she turned her head neither to the right nor left. The leader of
the little band reached the space before the canopy, and,
prostrating himself by the side of the stretcher, lay still. She
who walked behind him stopped also, and, seeing the black heap
upon the cushion, shuddered.
</p><p>"Woman, unveil," commanded the voice of Sinan.
</p><p>She hesitated, then swiftly undid some fastening, so that her
drapery fell from her head. The brethren stared, rubbed their
eyes, and stared again.
</p><p>Before them stood Rosamund!
</p><p>Yes, it was Rosamund, worn with sickness, terrors, and travel,
Rosamund herself beyond all doubt. At the sight of her pale,
queenly beauty the heap on the cushion stirred beneath his black
cloak, and the beady eyes were filled with an evil, eager light.
Even the dais seemed to wake from their contemplation, and
Masouda bit her red lip, turned pale beneath her olive skin, and
watched with devouring eyes, waiting to read this woman's heart.
</p><p>"Rosamund!" cried the brethren with one voice.
</p><p>She heard. As they sprang towards her she glanced wildly from
face to face, then with a low cry flung an arm about the neck of
each and would have fallen in the ecstacy of her joy had they not
held her. Indeed, her knees touched the ground. As they stooped
to lift her it flashed into Godwin's mind that Masouda had told
Sinan that they were her brethren. The thought was followed by
another. If this were so, they might be left with her, whereas
otherwise that black-robed devil--
</p><p>"Listen," he whispered in English; "we are not your cousins--we
are your brothers, your half-brothers, and we know no Arabic."
</p><p>She heard and Wulf heard, but the watchers thought that they were
but welcoming each other, for Wulf began to talk also, random
words in French, such as "Greeting, sister!" "Well found,
sister!" and kissed her on the forehead.
</p><p>Rosamund opened her eyes, which had closed, and, gaining her
feet, gave one hand to each of the brethren. Then the voice of
Masouda was heard interpreting the words of Sinan.
</p><p>"It seems, lady, that you know these knights."
</p><p>"I do--well. They are my brothers, from whom I was stolen when
they were drugged and our father was killed."
</p><p>"How is that, lady, seeing that you are said to be the niece of
Salah-ed-din? Are these knights, then, the nephews of
Salah-ed-din?"
</p><p>"Nay," answered Rosamund, "they are my father's sons, but of
another wife."
</p><p>The answer appeared to satisfy Sinan, who fixed his eyes upon the
pale beauty of Rosamund and asked no more questions. While he
remained thus thinking, a noise arose at the end of the terrace,
and the brethren, turning their heads, saw that the thick-set
knight was striving to thrust his way through the guards who
stood by the curtains and barred his path with the shafts of
their spears.
</p><p>Then it came into Godwin's mind that just before Rosamund
unveiled he had seen this knight suddenly turn and walk down the
terrace.
</p><p>The lord Sinan looked up at the sound and made a sign. Thereon
two of the dais sprang to their feet and ran towards the curtain,
where they spoke with the knight, who turned and came back with
them, though slowly, as one who is unwilling. Now his hood had
fallen from his head, and Godwin and Wulf stared at him as he
advanced, for surely they knew those great shoulders, those round
black eyes, those thick lips, and that heavy jowl.
</p><p>"Lozelle! It is Lozelle!" said Godwin.
</p><p>"Ay," echoed Rosamund, "it is Lozelle, the double traitor, who
betrayed me first to the soldiers of Saladin, and, because I
would have none of his love, next to this lord Sinan."
</p><p>Wulf heard, and, as Lozelle drew near to them, sprang forward
with an oath and struck him across the face with his mailed hand.
Instantly guards thrust themselves between them, and Sinan asked
through Masouda:
</p><p>"Why do you dare to strike this Frank in my presence?"
</p><p>"Because, lord," answered Wulf, "he is a rogue who has brought
all these troubles on our house. I challenge him to meet me in
battle to the death."
</p><p>"And I also," said Godwin.
</p><p>"I am ready," shouted Lozelle, stung to fury by the blow.
</p><p>"Then, dog, why did you try to run away when you saw our faces?"
asked Wulf.
</p><p>Masouda held up her hand and began to interpret, addressing
Lozelle, and speaking in the first person as the "mouth" of
Sinan.
</p><p>"I thank you for your service who have served me before. Your
messenger came, a Frank whom I knew in old days. As you had
arranged it should be, I sent one of my fedais with soldiers to
kill the men of Salah-ed-din on the ship and capture this lady
who is his niece, all of which it seems has been done. The
bargain that your messenger made was that the lady should be
given over to you--"
</p><p>Here Godwin and Wulf ground their teeth and glared at him.
</p><p>"But these knights say that you stole her, their kinswoman, from
them, and one of them has struck you and challenged you to single
combat, which challenge you have accepted. I sanction the combat
gladly, who have long desired to see two knights of the Franks
fight in tourney according to their custom. I will set the
course, and you shall be given the best horse in my kingdom; this
knight shall ride his own. These are the conditions--the course
shall be on the bridge between the inner and outer gates of the
castle city, and the fight, which must be to the death, shall
take place on the night of the full moon--that is, three days
from now. If you are victor, we will talk of the matter of the
lady for whom you bargained as a wife."
</p><p>"My lord, my lord," answered Lozelle, "who can lay a lance on
that terrible place in moonlight? Is it thus that you keep faith
with me?"
</p><p>"I can and will!" cried Wulf. "Dog, I would fight you in the
gates of hell, with my soul on the hazard."
</p><p>"Keep faith with yourself," said Sinan, "who said that you
accepted the challenge of this knight and made no conditions,
and when you have proved upon his body that his quarrel is not
just, then speak of my faith with you. Nay, no more words; when
this fight is done we will speak again, and not before. Let him
be led to the outer castle and there given of our best. Let my
great black horse be brought to him that he may gallop it to and
fro upon the bridge, or where he will within the circuit of the
walls, by day or by night; but see that he has no speech with
this lady whom he has betrayed into my power, or with these
knights his foes, nor suffer him to come into my presence. I will
not talk with a man who has been struck in the face until he has
washed away the blow in blood."
</p><p>As Masouda finished translating, and before Lozelle could answer,
the lord Sinan moved his head, whereon guards sprang forward and
conducted Lozelle from the terrace.
</p><p>"Farewell, Sir Thief," cried Wulf after him, "till we meet again
upon the narrow bridge and there settle our account. You have
fought Godwin, perhaps you will have better luck with Wulf."
</p><p>Lozelle glared back at him, and, finding no answer, went on his
way.
</p><p>"Your report," said Sinan, addressing the tall fedai who all this
while had lain upon his face before him, still as the form that
was stretched upon the bier. "There should have been another
prisoner, the great emir Hassan. Also, where is the Frankish
spy?"
</p><p>The fedai rose and spoke.
</p><p>"Lord," he said, "I did your bidding. The knight who has gone
steered the ship into the bay, as had been arranged. I attacked
with the daylight. The soldiers of Salah-ed-din fought bravely,
for the lady here saw us, and gave them time to gather, and we
lost many men. We overcame and killed them all, except the prince
Hassan, whom we took prisoner. I left some men to watch the ship.
The crew we spared, as they were the servants of the Frank
Lozelle, setting them loose upon the beach, together with a
Frankish woman, who was the servant of the lady here, to find
their way to the nearest city. This woman I would have killed,
but the lady your captive begged for her life, saying she had
come from the land of the Franks to seek her husband; so, having
no orders, let her go. Yesterday morning we started for Masyaf,
the prince Hassan riding in a litter together with that Frankish
spy who was here a while ago, and told you of the coming of the
ship. At night they slept in the same tent; I left the prince
bound and set a guard, but in the morning when we looked we found
him gone--how, I know not--and lying in the tent the Frankish
spy, dead, with a knife-wound through his heart. Behold!" and
withdrawing the cloth from the stretcher he revealed the stiff
form of the spy Nicholas, who lay there dead, a look of terror
frozen on his face.
</p><p>"At least this one has come to an end he deserved," muttered Wulf
to Godwin.
</p><p>"So, having searched without avail, I came on here with the lady
your prisoner and the Frank Lozelle. I have spoken."
</p><p>Now when he had heard this report, forgetting his calm, Sinan
arose from the cushion and stepped forward two paces. There he
halted, with fury in his glittering eyes, looking like a man
clothed in a black bell. For a moment he stroked his beard, and
the brethren noted that on the first finger of his right hand
was a ring so like to that which hung about the neck of Godwin
that none could have told them apart.
</p><p>"Man," Sinan said in a low voice, "what have you done? You have
left the emir Hassan go, who is the most trusted friend and
general of the Sultan of Damascus. By now he is there, or near
it, and within six days we shall see the army of Salah-ed-din
riding across the plain. Also you have not killed the crew and
the Frankish woman, and they too will make report of the taking
of the ship and the capture of this lady, who is of the house of
Salah-ed-din and whom he seeks more earnestly than all the
kingdom of the Franks. What have you to say?"
</p><p>"Lord," answered the tall fedai, and his hand trembled as he
spoke, "most mighty lord, I had no orders as to the killing of
the crew from your lips, and the Frank Lozelle told me that he
had agreed with you that they should be spared."
</p><p>"Then, slave, he lied. He agreed with me through that dead spy
that they should be slain, and do you not know that if I give no
orders in such a case I mean death, not life? But what of the
prince Hassan?"
</p><p>"Lord, I have nothing to say. I think he must have bribed the spy
named Nicholas"--and he pointed to the corpse--"to cut his bonds,
and afterwards killed the man for vengeance sake, for by the body
we found a heavy purse of gold. That he hated him as he hated
yonder Lozelle I know, for he called them dogs and traitors in
the boat; and since he could not strike them, his hands being
bound, he spat in their faces, cursing them in the name of Allah.
That is why, Lozelle being afraid to be near him, I set the spy
Nicholas, who was a bold fellow, as a watch over him, and two
soldiers outside the tent, while Lozelle and I watched the lady."
</p><p>"Let those soldiers be brought," said Sinan, "and tell their
story."
</p><p>They were brought and stood by their captain, but they had no
story to tell. They swore that they had not slept on guard, nor
heard a sound, yet when morning came the prince was gone. Again
the Lord of Death stroked his black beard. Then he held up the
Signet before the eyes of the three men, saying:
</p><p>"You see the token. Go."
</p><p>"Lord," said the fedai, "I have served you well for many years."
</p><p>"Your service is ended. Go!" was the stern answer.
</p><p>The fedai bowed his head in salute, stood for a moment as though
lost in thought, then, turning suddenly, walked with a steady
step to the edge of the abyss and leapt. For an instant the
sunlight shone on his white and fluttering robe, then from the
depths of that darksome place floated up the sound of a heavy
fall, and all was still.
</p><p>"Follow your captain to Paradise," said Sinan to the two
soldiers, whereon one of them drew a knife to stab himself, but a
dai sprang up, saying:
</p><p>"Beast, would you shed blood before your lord? Do you not know
the custom? Begone!"
</p><p>So the poor men went, the first with a steady step, and the
second, who was not so brave, reeling over the edge of the
precipice as one might who is drunken.
</p><p>"It is finished," said the dais, clapping their hands gently.
"Dread lord, we thank thee for thy justice."
</p><p>But Rosamund turned sick and faint, and even the brethren paled.
This man was terrible indeed--if he were a man and not a
devil--and they were in his power. How long would it be, they
wondered, before they also were bidden to walk that gulf? Only
Wulf swore in his heart that if he went by this road Sinan should
go with him.
</p><p>Then the corpse of the false palmer was borne away to be thrown
to the eagles which always hovered over that house of death, and
Sinan, having reseated himself upon the cushion, began to talk
again through his "mouth" Masouda, in a low, quiet voice, as
though nothing had happened to anger him.
</p><p>"Lady," he said to Rosamund, "your story is known to me.
Salah-ed-din seeks you, nor is it wonderful"--here his eyes
glittered with a new and horrible light--"that he should desire
to see such loveliness at his court, although the Frank Lozelle
swore through yonder dead spy that you are precious in his eyes
because of some vision that has come to him. Well, this heretic
sultan is my enemy whom Satan protects, for even my fedais have
failed to kill him, and perhaps there will be war on account of
you. But have no fear, for the price at which you shall be
delivered to him is higher than Salah-ed-din himself would care
to pay, even for you. So, since this castle is impregnable, here
you may dwell at peace, nor shall any desire be denied you.
Speak, and your wishes are fulfilled."
</p><p>"I desire," said Rosamund in a low, steady voice, "protection
against Sir Hugh Lozelle and all men."
</p><p>"It is yours. The Lord of the Mountain covers you with his own
mantle."
</p><p>"I desire," she went on, "that my brothers here may lodge with
me, that I may not feel alone among strange people."
</p><p>He thought awhile, and answered:
</p><p>"Your brethren shall lodge near you in the guest castle. Why not,
since from them you cannot need protection? They shall meet you
at the feast and in the garden. But, lady, do you know it? They
came here upon faith of some old tale of a promise made by him
who went before me to ask my help to recover you from
Salah-ed-din, unwitting that I was your host, not Salah-ed-din.
That they should meet you thus is a chance which makes even my
wisdom wonder, for in it I see omens. Now she whom they wished to
rescue from Salah-ed-din, these tall brethren of yours might wish
to rescue from Al-je-bal. Understand then, all of you, that from
the Lord of Death there is but one escape. Yonder runs its path,"
and he pointed to the dizzy place whence his three servants had
leapt to their doom.
</p><p>"Knights," he went on, addressing Godwin and Wulf, "lead your
sister hence. This evening I bid her, and you to my banquet. Till
then, farewell. Woman," he added to Masouda, "accompany them. You
know your duties; this lady is in your charge. Suffer that no
strange man comes near her--above all, the Frank Lozelle. Dais
take notice and let it be proclaimed--To these three is given the
protection of the Signet in all things, save that they must not
leave my walls except under sanction of the Signet--nay, in its
very presence."
</p><p>The dais rose, bowed, and seated themselves again. Then, guided
by Masouda and preceded and followed by guards, the brethren and
Rosamund walked down the terrace through the curtains into the
chancel-like place where men crouched upon the ground; through
the great hall were more men crouched upon the ground; through
the ante-chamber where, at a word from Masouda, the guards
saluted; through passages to that place where they had slept.
Here Masouda halted and said:
</p><p>"Lady Rose of the World, who are fitly so named, I go to prepare
your chamber. Doubtless you will wish to speak awhile with these
your--brothers. Speak on and fear not, for it shall be my care
that you are left alone, if only for a little while. Yet walls
have ears, so I counsel you use that English tongue which none of
us understand in the land of Al-je-bal--not even I."
</p><p>Then she bowed and went.
