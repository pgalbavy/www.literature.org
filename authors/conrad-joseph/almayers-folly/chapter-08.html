<p>The news as to the identity of the body lying now in Almayer's
compound spread rapidly over the settlement.  During the forenoon
most of the inhabitants remained in the long street discussing
the mysterious return and the unexpected death of the man who
had become known to them as the trader.  His arrival during the
north-east monsoon, his long sojourn in their midst, his sudden
departure with his brig, and, above all, the mysterious appearance
of the body, said to be his, amongst the logs, were subjects to
wonder at and to talk over and over again with undiminished interest. 
Mahmat moved from house to house and from group to group, always
ready to repeat his tale: how he saw the body caught by the sarong
in a forked log; how Mrs. Almayer coming, one of the first, at
his cries, recognised it, even before he had it hauled on shore;
how Babalatchi ordered him to bring it out of the water.  "By
the feet I dragged him in, and there was no head," exclaimed Mahmat,
"and how could the white man's wife know who it was?  She was
a witch, it was well known.  And did you see how the white man
himself ran away at the sight of the body?  Like a deer he ran!" 
And here Mahmat imitated Almayer's long strides, to the great
joy of the beholders.  And for all his trouble he had nothing. 
The ring with the green stone Tuan Babalatchi kept.  "Nothing! 
Nothing!"  He spat down at his feet in sign of disgust, and left
that group to seek further on a fresh audience.</p>

<p>The news spreading to the furthermost parts of the settlement
found out Abdulla in the cool recess of his godown, where he sat
overlooking his Arab clerks and the men loading and unloading
the up-country canoes. Reshid, who was busy on the jetty, was
summoned into his uncle's presence and found him, as usual, very
calm and even cheerful, but very much surprised.  The rumour of
the capture or destruction of Dain's brig had reached the Arab's
ears three days before from the sea-fishermen and through the
dwellers on the lower reaches of the river.  It had been passed
up-stream from neighbour to neighbour till Bulangi, whose clearing
was nearest to the settlement, had brought that news himself to
Abdulla whose favour he courted.  But rumour also spoke of a fight
and of Dain's death on board his own vessel.  And now all the
settlement talked of Dain's visit to the Rajah and of his death
when crossing the river in the dark to see Almayer.</p>

<p>They could not understand this.  Reshid thought that it was very
strange. He felt uneasy and doubtful.  But Abdulla, after the
first shock of surprise, with the old age's dislike for solving
riddles, showed a becoming resignation.  He remarked that the
man was dead now at all events, and consequently no more dangerous. 
Where was the use to wonder at the decrees of Fate, especially
if they were propitious to the True Believers?  And with a pious
ejaculation to Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, Abdulla
seemed to regard the incident as closed for the present.</p>

<p>Not so Reshid.  He lingered by his uncle, pulling thoughtfully
his neatly trimmed beard.</p>

<p>"There are many lies," he murmured.  "He has been dead once before,
and came to life to die again now.  The Dutch will be here before
many days and clamour for the man.  Shall I not believe my eyes
sooner than the tongues of women and idle men?"</p>

<p>"They say that the body is being taken to Almayer's compound,"
said Abdulla.  "If you want to go there you must go before the
Dutch arrive here.  Go late.  It should not be said that we have
been seen inside that man's enclosure lately."</p>

<p>Reshid assented to the truth of this last remark and left his
uncle's side.  He leaned against the lintel of the big doorway
and looked idly across the courtyard through the open gate on
to the main road of the settlement.  It lay empty, straight, and
yellow under the flood of light. In the hot noontide the smooth
trunks of palm trees, the outlines of the houses, and away there
at the other end of the road the roof of Almayer's house visible
over the bushes on the dark background of forest, seemed to quiver
in the heat radiating from the steaming earth.  Swarms of yellow
butterflies rose, and settled to rise again in short flights before
Reshid's half-closed eyes.  From under his feet arose the dull
hum of insects in the long grass of the courtyard.  He looked
on sleepily.</p>

<p>From one of the side paths amongst the houses a woman stepped
out on the road, a slight girlish figure walking under the shade
of a large tray balanced on its head.  The consciousness of something
moving stirred Reshid's half-sleeping senses into a comparative
wakefulness.  He recognised Taminah, Bulangi's slave-girl, with
her tray of cakes for sale&mdash;an apparition of daily recurrence
and of no importance whatever. She was going towards Almayer's
house.  She could be made useful.  He roused himself up and ran
towards the gate calling out, "Taminah O!"  The girl stopped,
hesitated, and came back slowly.</p>

<p>Reshid waited, signing to her impatiently to come nearer.</p>

<p>When near Reshid Taminah stood with downcast eyes.  Reshid looked
at her a while before he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you going to Almayer's house?  They say in the settlement
that Dain the trader, he that was found drowned this morning,
is lying in the white man's campong."</p>

<p>"I have heard this talk," whispered Taminah; "and this morning
by the riverside I saw the body.  Where it is now I do not know."</p>

<p>"So you have seen it?" asked Reshid, eagerly.  "Is it Dain? 
You have seen him many times.  You would know him."</p>

<p>The girl's lips quivered and she remained silent for a while,
breathing quickly.</p>

<p>"I have seen him, not a long time ago," she said at last.  "The
talk is true; he is dead.  What do you want from me, Tuan?  I
must go."</p>

<p>Just then the report of the gun fired on board the steam launch
was heard, interrupting Reshid's reply.  Leaving the girl he ran
to the house, and met in the courtyard Abdulla coming towards
the gate.</p>

<p>"The Orang Blanda are come," said Reshid, "and now we shall have
our reward."</p>

<p>Abdulla shook his head doubtfully.  "The white men's rewards
are long in coming," he said.  "White men are quick in anger and
slow in gratitude. We shall see."</p>

<p>He stood at the gate stroking his grey beard and listening to
the distant cries of greeting at the other end of the settlement. 
As Taminah was turning to go he called her back.</p>

<p>"Listen, girl," he said: "there will be many white men in Almayer's
house.  You shall be there selling your cakes to the men of the
sea.  What you see and what you hear you may tell me.  Come here
before the sun sets and I will give you a blue handkerchief with
red spots.  Now go, and forget not to return."</p>

<p>He gave her a push with the end of his long staff as she was
going away and made her stumble.</p>

<p>"This slave is very slow," he remarked to his nephew, looking
after the girl with great disfavour.</p>

<p>Taminah walked on, her tray on the head, her eyes fixed on the
ground. From the open doors of the houses were heard, as she passed,
friendly calls inviting her within for business purposes, but
she never heeded them, neglecting her sales in the preoccupation
of intense thinking. Since the very early morning she had heard
much, she had also seen much that filled her heart with a joy
mingled with great suffering and fear. Before the dawn, before
she left Bulangi's house to paddle up to Sambir she had heard
voices outside the house when all in it but herself were asleep. 
And now, with her knowledge of the words spoken in the darkness,
she held in her hand a life and carried in her breast a great
sorrow.  Yet from her springy step, erect figure, and face veiled
over by the everyday look of apathetic indifference, nobody could
have guessed of the double load she carried under the visible
burden of the tray piled up high with cakes manufactured by the
thrifty hands of Bulangi's wives.  In that supple figure straight
as an arrow, so graceful and free in its walk, behind those soft
eyes that spoke of nothing but of unconscious resignation, there
slept all feelings and all passions, all hopes and all fears,
the curse of life and the consolation of death.  And she knew
nothing of it all.  She lived like the tall palms amongst whom
she was passing now, seeking the light, desiring the sunshine,
fearing the storm, unconscious of either.  The slave had no hope,
and knew of no change.  She knew of no other sky, no other water,
no other forest, no other world, no other life.  She had no wish,
no hope, no love, no fear except of a blow, and no vivid feeling
but that of occasional hunger, which was seldom, for Bulangi was
rich and rice was plentiful in the solitary house in his clearing. 
The absence of pain and hunger was her happiness, and when she
felt unhappy she was simply tired, more than usual, after the
day's labour.  Then in the hot nights of the south-west monsoon
she slept dreamlessly under the bright stars on the platform built
outside the house and over the river.  Inside they slept too:
Bulangi by the door; his wives further in; the children with their
mothers.  She could hear their breathing; Bulangi's sleepy voice;
the sharp cry of a child soon hushed with tender words.  And she
closed her eyes to the murmur of the water below her, to the whisper
of the warm wind above, ignorant of the never-ceasing life of
that tropical nature that spoke to her in vain with the thousand
faint voices of the near forest, with the breath of tepid wind;
in the heavy scents that lingered around her head; in the white
wraiths of morning mist that hung over her in the solemn hush
of all creation before the dawn.</p>

<p>Such had been her existence before the coming of the brig with
the strangers.  She remembered well that time; the uproar in the
settlement, the never-ending wonder, the days and nights of talk
and excitement.  She remembered her own timidity with the strange
men, till the brig moored to the bank became in a manner part
of the settlement, and the fear wore off in the familiarity of
constant intercourse.  The call on board then became part of her
daily round.  She walked hesitatingly up the slanting planks of
the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less decent
jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks.  There she sold her
wares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so
free. There was a throng, a constant coming and going; calls interchanged,
orders given and executed with shouts; the rattle of blocks, the
flinging about of coils of rope.  She sat out of the way under
the shade of the awning, with her tray before her, the veil drawn
well over her face, feeling shy amongst so many men.  She smiled
at all buyers, but spoke to none, letting their jests pass with
stolid unconcern.  She heard many tales told around her of far-off
countries, of strange customs, of events stranger still.  Those
men were brave; but the most fearless of them spoke of their chief
with fear.  Often the man they called their master passed before
her, walking erect and indifferent, in the pride of youth, in
the flash of rich dress, with a tinkle of gold ornaments, while
everybody stood aside watching anxiously for a movement of his
lips, ready to do his bidding.  Then all her life seemed to rush
into her eyes, and from under her veil she gazed at him, charmed,
yet fearful to attract attention.  One day he noticed her and
asked, "Who is that girl?"  "A slave, Tuan!  A girl that sells
cakes," a dozen voices replied together. She rose in terror to
run on shore, when he called her back; and as she stood trembling
with head hung down before him, he spoke kind words, lifting her
chin with his hand and looking into her eyes with a smile. "Do
not be afraid," he said.  He never spoke to her any more.  Somebody
called out from the river bank; he turned away and forgot her
existence. Taminah saw Almayer standing on the shore with Nina
on his arm.  She heard Nina's voice calling out gaily, and saw
Dain's face brighten with joy as he leaped on shore.  She hated
the sound of that voice ever since.</p>

<p>After that day she left off visiting Almayer's compound, and
passed the noon hours under the shade of the brig awning.  She
watched for his coming with heart beating quicker and quicker,
as he approached, into a wild tumult of newly-aroused feelings
of joy and hope and fear that died away with Dain's retreating
figure, leaving her tired out, as if after a struggle, sitting
still for a long time in dreamy languor.  Then she paddled home
slowly in the afternoon, often letting her canoe float with the
lazy stream in the quiet backwater of the river.  The paddle hung
idle in the water as she sat in the stern, one hand supporting
her chin, her eyes wide open, listening intently to the whispering
of her heart that seemed to swell at last into a song of extreme
sweetness.  Listening to that song she husked the rice at home;
it dulled her ears to the shrill bickerings of Bulangi's wives,
to the sound of angry reproaches addressed to herself.  And when
the sun was near its setting she walked to the bathing-place and
heard it as she stood on the tender grass of the low bank, her
robe at her feet, and looked at the reflection of her figure on
the glass-like surface of the creek.  Listening to it she walked
slowly back, her wet hair hanging over her shoulders; laying down
to rest under the bright stars, she closed her eyes to the murmur
of the water below, of the warm wind above; to the voice of nature
speaking through the faint noises of the great forest, and to
the song of her own heart.</p>

<p>She heard, but did not understand, and drank in the dreamy joy
of her new existence without troubling about its meaning or its
end, till the full consciousness of life came to her through pain
and anger.  And she suffered horribly the first time she saw Nina's
long canoe drift silently past the sleeping house of Bulangi,
bearing the two lovers into the white mist of the great river. 
Her jealousy and rage culminated into a paroxysm of physical pain
that left her lying panting on the river bank, in the dumb agony
of a wounded animal.  But she went on moving patiently in the
enchanted circle of slavery, going through her task day after
day with all the pathos of the grief she could not express, even
to herself, locked within her breast.  She shrank from Nina as
she would have shrunk from the sharp blade of a knife cutting
into her flesh, but she kept on visiting the brig to feed her
dumb, ignorant soul on her own despair.  She saw Dain many times. 
He never spoke, he never looked.  Could his eyes see only one
woman's image?  Could his ears hear only one woman's voice? He
never noticed her; not once.</p>

<p>And then he went away.  She saw him and Nina for the last time
on that morning when Babalatchi, while visiting his fish baskets,
had his suspicions of the white man's daughter's love affair with
Dain confirmed beyond the shadow of doubt.  Dain disappeared,
and Taminah's heart, where lay useless and barren the seeds of
all love and of all hate, the possibilities of all passions and
of all sacrifices, forgot its joys and its sufferings when deprived
of the help of the senses.  Her half-formed, savage mind, the
slave of her body&mdash;as her body was the slave of another's will&mdash;forgot
the faint and vague image of the ideal that had found its beginning
in the physical promptings of her savage nature.  She dropped
back into the torpor of her former life and found consolation&mdash;even
a certain kind of happiness&mdash;in the thought that now Nina and
Dain were separated, probably for ever.  He would forget.  This
thought soothed the last pangs of dying jealousy that had nothing
now to feed upon, and Taminah found peace.  It was like the dreary
tranquillity of a desert, where there is peace only because there
is no life.</p>

<p>And now he had returned.  She had recognised his voice calling
aloud in the night for Bulangi.  She had crept out after her master
to listen closer to the intoxicating sound.  Dain was there, in
a boat, talking to Bulangi.  Taminah, listening with arrested
breath, heard another voice. The maddening joy, that only a second
before she thought herself incapable of containing within her
fast-beating heart, died out, and left her shivering in the old
anguish of physical pain that she had suffered once before at
the sight of Dain and Nina.  Nina spoke now, ordering and entreating
in turns, and Bulangi was refusing, expostulating, at last consenting. 
He went in to take a paddle from the heap lying behind the door. 
Outside the murmur of two voices went on, and she caught a word
here and there.  She understood that he was fleeing from white
men, that he was seeking a hiding-place, that he was in some danger. 
But she heard also words which woke the rage of jealousy that
had been asleep for so many days in her bosom.  Crouching low
on the mud in the black darkness amongst the piles, she heard
the whisper in the boat that made light of toil, of privation,
of danger, of life itself, if in exchange there could be but a
short moment of close embrace, a look from the eyes, the feel
of light breath, the touch of soft lips.  So spoke Dain as he
sat in the canoe holding Nina's hands while waiting for Bulangi's
return; and Taminah, supporting herself by the slimy pile, felt
as if a heavy weight was crushing her down, down into the black
oily water at her feet.  She wanted to cry out; to rush at them
and tear their vague shadows apart; to throw Nina into the smooth
water, cling to her close, hold her to the bottom where that man
could not find her.  She could not cry, she could not move.  Then
footsteps were heard on the bamboo platform above her head; she
saw Bulangi get into his smallest canoe and take the lead, the
other boat following, paddled by Dain and Nina.  With a slight
splash of the paddles dipped stealthily into the water, their
indistinct forms passed before her aching eyes and vanished in
the darkness of the creek.</p>

<p>She remained there in the cold and wet, powerless to move, breathing
painfully under the crushing weight that the mysterious hand of
Fate had laid so suddenly upon her slender shoulders, and shivering,
she felt within a burning fire, that seemed to feed upon her very
life.  When the breaking day had spread a pale golden ribbon over
the black outline of the forests, she took up her tray and departed
towards the settlement, going about her task purely from the force
of habit.  As she approached Sambir she could see the excitement
and she heard with momentary surprise of the finding of Dain's
body.  It was not true, of course.  She knew it well.  She regretted
that he was not dead.  She should have liked Dain to be dead,
so as to be parted from that woman&mdash;from all women.  She felt
a strong desire to see Nina, but without any clear object.  She
hated her, and feared her and she felt an irresistible impulse
pushing her towards Almayer's house to see the white woman's face,
to look close at those eyes, to hear again that voice, for the
sound of which Dain was ready to risk his liberty, his life even. 
She had seen her many times; she had heard her voice daily for
many months past.  What was there in her?  What was there in that
being to make a man speak as Dain had spoken, to make him blind
to all other faces, deaf to all other voices?</p>

<p>She left the crowd by the riverside, and wandered aimlessly among
the empty houses, resisting the impulse that pushed her towards
Almayer's campong to seek there in Nina's eyes the secret of her
own misery.  The sun mounting higher, shortened the shadows and
poured down upon her a flood of light and of stifling heat as
she passed on from shadow to light, from light to shadow, amongst
the houses, the bushes, the tall trees, in her unconscious flight
from the pain in her own heart.  In the extremity of her distress
she could find no words to pray for relief, she knew of no heaven
to send her prayer to, and she wandered on with tired feet in
the dumb surprise and terror at the injustice of the suffering
inflicted upon her without cause and without redress.</p>

<p>The short talk with Reshid, the proposal of Abdulla steadied
her a little and turned her thoughts into another channel.  Dain
was in some danger. He was hiding from white men.  So much she
had overheard last night.  They all thought him dead.  She knew
he was alive, and she knew of his hidingplace.  What did the Arabs
want to know about the white men?  The white men want with Dain? 
Did they wish to kill him?  She could tell them all&mdash;no, she would
say nothing, and in the night she would go to him and sell him
his life for a word, for a smile, for a gesture even, and be his
slave in far-off countries, away from Nina.  But there were dangers. 
The one-eyed Babalatchi who knew everything; the white man's wife&mdash;she
was a witch.  Perhaps they would tell.  And then there was Nina. 
She must hurry on and see.</p>

<p>In her impatience she left the path and ran towards Almayer's
dwelling through the undergrowth between the palm trees.  She
came out at the back of the house, where a narrow ditch, full
of stagnant water that overflowed from the river, separated Almayer's
campong from the rest of the settlement.  The thick bushes growing
on the bank were hiding from her sight the large courtyard with
its cooking shed.  Above them rose several thin columns of smoke,
and from behind the sound of strange voices informed Taminah that
the Men of the Sea belonging to the warship had already landed
and were camped between the ditch and the house.  To the left
one of Almayer's slave-girls came down to the ditch and bent over
the shiny water, washing a kettle.  To the right the tops of the
banana plantation, visible above the bushes, swayed and shook
under the touch of invisible hands gathering the fruit.  On the
calm water several canoes moored to a heavy stake were crowded
together, nearly bridging the ditch just at the place where Taminah
stood.  The voices in the courtyard rose at times into an outburst
of calls, replies, and laughter, and then died away into a silence
that soon was broken again by a fresh clamour. Now and again the
thin blue smoke rushed out thicker and blacker, and drove in odorous
masses over the creek, wrapping her for a moment in a suffocating
veil; then, as the fresh wood caught well alight, the smoke vanished
in the bright sunlight, and only the scent of aromatic wood drifted
afar, to leeward of the crackling fires.</p>

<p>Taminah rested her tray on a stump of a tree, and remained standing
with her eyes turned towards Almayer's house, whose roof and part
of a whitewashed wall were visible over the bushes.  The slave-girl
finished her work, and after looking for a while curiously at
Taminah, pushed her way through the dense thicket back to the
courtyard.  Round Taminah there was now a complete solitude. 
She threw herself down on the ground, and hid her face in her
hands.  Now when so close she had no courage to see Nina.  At
every burst of louder voices from the courtyard she shivered in
the fear of hearing Nina's voice.  She came to the resolution
of waiting where she was till dark, and then going straight to
Dain's hiding-place. From where she was she could watch the movements
of white men, of Nina, of all Dain's friends, and of all his enemies. 
Both were hateful alike to her, for both would take him away beyond
her reach.  She hid herself in the long grass to wait anxiously
for the sunset that seemed so slow to come.</p>

<p>On the other side of the ditch, behind the bush, by the clear
fires, the seamen of the frigate had encamped on the hospitable
invitation of Almayer.  Almayer, roused out of his apathy by the
prayers and importunity of Nina, had managed to get down in time
to the jetty so as to receive the officers at their landing. 
The lieutenant in command accepted his invitation to his house
with the remark that in any case their business was with Almayer&mdash;and
perhaps not very pleasant, he added. Almayer hardly heard him. 
He shook hands with them absently and led the way towards the
house.  He was scarcely conscious of the polite words of welcome
he greeted the strangers with, and afterwards repeated several
times over again in his efforts to appear at ease.  The agitation
of their host did not escape the officer's eyes, and the chief
confided to his subordinate, in a low voice, his doubts as to
Almayer's sobriety.  The young sub-lieutenant laughed and expressed
in a whisper the hope that the white man was not intoxicated enough
to neglect the offer of some refreshments.  "He does not seem
very dangerous," he added, as they followed Almayer up the steps
of the verandah.</p>

<p>"No, he seems more of a fool than a knave; I have heard of him,"
returned the senior.</p>

<p>They sat around the table.  Almayer with shaking hands made gin
cocktails, offered them all round, and drank himself, with every
gulp feeling stronger, steadier, and better able to face all the
difficulties of his position.  Ignorant of the fate of the brig
he did not suspect the real object of the officer's visit.  He
had a general notion that something must have leaked out about
the gunpowder trade, but apprehended nothing beyond some temporary
inconveniences.  After emptying his glass he began to chat easily,
lying back in his chair with one of his legs thrown negligently
over the arm.  The lieutenant astride on his chair, a glowing
cheroot in the corner of his mouth, listened with a sly smile
from behind the thick volumes of smoke that escaped from his compressed
lips.  The young sub-lieutenant, leaning with both elbows on the
table, his head between his hands, looked on sleepily in the torpor
induced by fatigue and the gin.  Almayer talked on&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a great pleasure to see white faces here.  I have lived
here many years in great solitude.  The Malays, you understand,
are not company for a white man; moreover they are not friendly;
they do not understand our ways.  Great rascals they are.  I believe
I am the only white man on the east coast that is a settled resident. 
We get visitors from Macassar or Singapore sometimes&mdash;traders,
agents, or explorers, but they are rare. There was a scientific
explorer here a year or more ago.  He lived in my house: drank
from morning to night.  He lived joyously for a few months, and
when the liquor he brought with him was gone he returned to Batavia
with a report on the mineral wealth of the interior.  Ha, ha,
ha!  Good, is it not?"</p>

<p>He ceased abruptly and looked at his guests with a meaningless
stare. While they laughed he was reciting to himself the old story:
"Dain dead, all my plans destroyed.  This is the end of all hope
and of all things." His heart sank within him.  He felt a kind
of deadly sickness.</p>

<p>"Very good.  Capital!" exclaimed both officers.  Almayer came
out of his despondency with another burst of talk.</p>

<p>"Eh! what about the dinner?  You have got a cook with you.  That's
all right.  There is a cooking shed in the other courtyard.  I
can give you a goose.  Look at my geese&mdash;the only geese on the
east coast&mdash;perhaps on the whole island.  Is that your cook? 
Very good.  Here, Ali, show this Chinaman the cooking place and
tell Mem Almayer to let him have room there.  My wife, gentlemen,
does not come out; my daughter may.  Meantime have some more drink. 
It is a hot day."</p>

<p>The lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth, looked at the
ash critically, shook it off and turned towards Almayer.</p>

<p>"We have a rather unpleasant business with you," he said.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," returned Almayer.  "It can be nothing very serious,
surely."</p>

<p>"If you think an attempt to blow up forty men at least, not a
serious matter you will not find many people of your opinion,"
retorted the officer sharply.</p>

<p>"Blow up!  What?  I know nothing about it," exclaimed Almayer. 
"Who did that, or tried to do it?"</p>

<p>"A man with whom you had some dealings," answered the lieutenant. 
"He passed here under the name of Dain Maroola.  You sold him
the gunpowder he had in that brig we captured."</p>

<p>"How did you hear about the brig?" asked Almayer.  "I know nothing
about the powder he may have had."</p>

<p>"An Arab trader of this place has sent the information about
your goings on here to Batavia, a couple of months ago," said
the officer.  "We were waiting for the brig outside, but he slipped
past us at the mouth of the river, and we had to chase the fellow
to the southward.  When he sighted us he ran inside the reefs
and put the brig ashore.  The crew escaped in boats before we
could take possession.  As our boats neared the craft it blew
up with a tremendous explosion; one of the boats being too near
got swamped.  Two men drowned&mdash;that is the result of your speculation,
Mr. Almayer.  Now we want this Dain.  We have good grounds to
suppose he is hiding in Sambir.  Do you know where he is?  You
had better put yourself right with the authorities as much as
possible by being perfectly frank with me.  Where is this Dain?"</p>

<p>Almayer got up and walked towards the balustrade of the verandah. 
He seemed not to be thinking of the officer's question.  He looked
at the body laying straight and rigid under its white cover on
which the sun, declining amongst the clouds to the westward, threw
a pale tinge of red. The lieutenant waited for the answer, taking
quick pulls at his half-extinguished cigar.  Behind them Ali moved
noiselessly laying the table, ranging solemnly the ill-assorted
and shabby crockery, the tin spoons, the forks with broken prongs,
and the knives with saw-like blades and loose handles.  He had
almost forgotten how to prepare the table for white men.  He felt
aggrieved; Mem Nina would not help him.  He stepped back to look
at his work admiringly, feeling very proud.  This must be right;
and if the master afterwards is angry and swears, then so much
the worse for Mem Nina.  Why did she not help?  He left the verandah
to fetch the dinner.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Almayer, will you answer my question as frankly as
it is put to you?" asked the lieutenant, after a long silence.</p>

<p>Almayer turned round and looked at his interlocutor steadily. 
"If you catch this Dain what will you do with him?" he asked.</p>

<p>The officer's face flushed.  "This is not an answer," he said,
annoyed.</p>

<p>"And what will you do with me?" went on Almayer, not heeding
the interruption.</p>

<p>"Are you inclined to bargain?" growled the other.  "It would
be bad policy, I assure you.  At present I have no orders about
your person, but we expected your assistance in catching this
Malay."</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted Almayer, "just so: you can do nothing without
me, and I, knowing the man well, am to help you in finding him."</p>

<p>"This is exactly what we expect," assented the officer.  "You
have broken the law, Mr. Almayer, and you ought to make amends."</p>

<p>"And save myself?"</p>

<p>"Well, in a sense yes.  Your head is not in any danger," said
the lieutenant, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Almayer, with decision, "I shall deliver the
man up to you."</p>

<p>Both officers rose to their feet quickly, and looked for their
side-arms which they had unbuckled.  Almayer laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Steady, gentlemen!" he exclaimed.  "In my own time and in my
own way. After dinner, gentlemen, you shall have him."</p>

<p>"This is preposterous," urged the lieutenant.  "Mr. Almayer,
this is no joking matter.  The man is a criminal.  He deserves
to hang.  While we dine he may escape; the rumour of our arrival&mdash;"</p>

<p>Almayer walked towards the table.  "I give you my word of honour,
gentlemen, that he shall not escape; I have him safe enough."</p>

<p>"The arrest should be effected before dark," remarked the young
sub.</p>

<p>"I shall hold you responsible for any failure.  We are ready,
but can do nothing just now without you," added the senior, with
evident annoyance.</p>

<p>Almayer made a gesture of assent.  "On my word of honour," he
repeated vaguely.  "And now let us dine," he added briskly.</p>

<p>Nina came through the doorway and stood for a moment holding
the curtain aside for Ali and the old Malay woman bearing the
dishes; then she moved towards the three men by the table.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Almayer, pompously.  "This is my daughter. 
Nina, these gentlemen, officers of the frigate outside, have done
me the honour to accept my hospitality."</p>

<p>Nina answered the low bows of the two officers by a slow inclination
of the head and took her place at the table opposite her father. 
All sat down.  The coxswain of the steam launch came up carrying
some bottles of wine.</p>

<p>"You will allow me to have this put upon the table?" said the
lieutenant to Almayer.</p>

<p>"What!  Wine!  You are very kind.  Certainly, I have none myself. 
Times are very hard."</p>

<p>The last words of his reply were spoken by Almayer in a faltering
voice. The thought that Dain was dead recurred to him vividly
again, and he felt as if an invisible hand was gripping his throat. 
He reached for the gin bottle while they were uncorking the wine
and swallowed a big gulp.  The lieutenant, who was speaking to
Nina, gave him a quick glance.  The young sub began to recover
from the astonishment and confusion caused by Nina's unexpected
appearance and great beauty.  "She was very beautiful and imposing,"
he reflected, "but after all a half-caste girl."  This thought
caused him to pluck up heart and look at Nina sideways.  Nina,
with composed face, was answering in a low, even voice the elder
officer's polite questions as to the country and her mode of life. 
Almayer pushed his plate away and drank his guest's wine in gloomy
silence.</p>
