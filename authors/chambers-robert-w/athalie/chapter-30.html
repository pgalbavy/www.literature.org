<p>Lights yet burned on the lower floors and behind the drawn blinds
of Athalie's room. The night was quiet and soft and lovely; the
moon still young in its first quarter.</p>

<p>There was no wind to blow the fountain jet, so that every drop
fell straight back where the slim column of water broke against
a strip of stars above the garden wall. Somewhere in distant darkness
the little owl trilled.</p>

<p>If he were walking or motionless he no longer knew it; nor did
he seem to be aware of anything around.</p>

<p>Hafiz came up to him through the dusk with a little mew of recognition
or of loneliness. Afterward the cat followed him for a while and
then settled down upon the grass intent on the invisible stirring
stealthily in obscurity.</p>

<p>The fragrance of the iris grew sweeter, fresher. Many new buds
had unfolded since high noon. One stalk had fallen across the
path and Clive's dragging feet passed over it where he moved blindly,
at hazard, with stumbling steps along the path&mdash;errant, senseless,
and always blind.</p>

<p>For on the garden bench a young girl sat, slender, exquisite,
smiling as he approached. But he could not see her, nor could
he see in her arms the little flower-like face, and the tiny hands
against her breast.</p>

<p>"Clive!" she said. But he could not hear her.</p>

<p>"Clive," she whispered; "my beloved!"</p>

<p>But he could neither see nor hear. His knees, too, were failing;
he put out one hand, blindly, and sank down upon the garden bench.</p>

<p>All night long she sat beside him, her head against his shoulder,
sometimes touching his drawn face with warm, sweet lips, sometimes
looking down at the little face pressed to her quiet breast.</p>

<p>And all night long the light burned behind the closed blinds
of her room; and the little silvery dusk-moths floated in and
out of the rays. And Hafiz, sitting on the grass, watched them
sometimes; sometimes he gazed at his young mistress out of wide,
unblinking eyes.</p>

<p>"Hafiz," she murmured lazily in her sweetly humorous way.</p>

<p>The cat uttered a soft little mew but did not move. And when
she laid her cheek close to Clive's whispering,&mdash;"I love you &mdash;I
love you so!"&mdash;he never stirred.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes, brooding, grew patient, calm, and tender; she
looked down silently into the little face close cradled in her
arms.</p>

<p>Then the child's eyes opened like two blue stars; and she bent
over in a swift ecstasy of bliss, covering the flower-like face
with kisses.</p>
