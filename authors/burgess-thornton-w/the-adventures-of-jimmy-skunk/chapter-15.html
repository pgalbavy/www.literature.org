<p>Jimmy Skunk couldn't think of anything but eggs. The more he
thought of them, the more he wanted some. After parting from Unc'
Billy Possum in the Green Forest he went back to the Green Meadows
and prowled about, hunting for the nests of his feathered neighbors
who build on the ground, and having no more luck than he had had
before.</p>

<p>Unc' Billy Possum was faring about the same way. He couldn't,
for the life of him, stop thinking about those eggs that belonged
to Mrs. Grouse. The more he tried to forget about them, the more
he thought about them.</p>

<p>"Ah feels it in mah bones that there isn't the least bit of use
in huntin' fo' them," said he to himself, as he watched Jimmy
Skunk amble out of sight up the Lone Little Path. "No, Sah, there
isn't the least bit of use. Ah done look every place Ah can think
of already. Still, Ah haven't got anything else special on mah
mind, and those aiggs cert'nly would taste good. Ah reckons it
must be Ah needs those aiggs, or Ah wouldn't have them on mah
mind so much. Ah finds it rather painful to carry aiggs on mah
mind all the time, but Ah would enjoy carrying them in mah stomach.
Ah cert'nly would." Unc' Billy grinned and started to ramble about
aimlessly, hoping that chance would lead him to the nest of Mrs.
Grouse.</p>

<p>Do what he would, Unc' Billy couldn't get the thought of eggs
off his mind, and the more he thought about them the more he wanted
some. And that led him to think of Farmer Brown's henhouse. He
had long ago resolved never again to go there, but the longing
for a taste of eggs was too much for his good resolutions, and
as soon as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sank to rest behind the Purple
Hills, and the Black Shadows came creeping across the Green Meadows
and through the Green Forest, Unc' Billy slipped away, taking
pains that old Mrs. Possum shouldn't suspect where he was going.</p>

<p>Out from the Green Forest, keeping among the Black Shadows along
by the old stone wall on the edge of the Old Orchard, he stole,
and so at last he reached Farmer Brown's henhouse. He stopped
to listen. There was no sign of Bowser the Hound, and Unc' Billy
sighed gently. It was a sigh of relief. Then he crept around a
corner of the henhouse towards a certain hole under it he remembered
well. Just as he reached it, he saw something white. It moved.
It was coming towards him from the other end of the henhouse.
Unc' Billy stopped right where he was. He was undecided whether
to run or stay. Then he heard a little grunt and decided to stay.
He even grinned. A few seconds later up came Jimmy Skunk. It was
a white stripe on Jimmy's coat that Unc' Billy had seen.</p>

<p>Jimmy gave a little snort of surprise when he almost bumped into
Unc' Billy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Just taking a li'l walk fo' the good of mah appetite," replied
Unc' Billy, grinning more broadly than ever. "What are yo' doing
here, Brer Skunk?"</p>

<p>"The same thing," replied Jimmy. Then he chuckled. "This is an
unexpected meeting. I guess you must have had the same thing on
your mind all day that I have," he added.</p>

<p>"Ah reckon so," replied Unc' Billy, and both grinned.</p>
