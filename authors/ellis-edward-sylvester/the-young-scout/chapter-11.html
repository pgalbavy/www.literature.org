<p>The scout selected by Geronimo showed his wisdom by dismounting
and setting out on foot to perform his delicate mission. Like
Mendez, he did not mean to handicap himself with the presence
of his horse.</p>

<p>In going to the stream he almost stepped upon the White Mountain
Apache, who, fortunately for him, had about buried himself in
the sand, but with all his astonishing skill, the hostile saw
not the object which could not have escaped his vision had he
once looked down to the earth, instead of keeping his eyes fixed
on the silently flowing stream and the clearly defined bank beyond.</p>

<p>Mendez had certainly gone through his share of trying danger.
He had learned all that it was necessary to know and much more
than he expected to learn, and his one desire now was to get back
to his friends. A grim warrior had started to seek their lives,
and, knowing his own race as he did, Mendez feared the issue.</p>

<p>The moon had climbed so high in the heavens and its light was
so powerful that the scout not only dared not approach the creek,
but was afraid to change his position or fling off any part of
the blanket of sand that had served so well to conceal him. He
must stay where he was until Geronimo and his band moved away.</p>

<p>Luckily for the scout his suspense was soon relieved. Suddenly
the horsemen were in motion, and, approaching the stream, followed
its bank until out of sight to the eastward.</p>

<p>This was the chance for which Mendez was waiting with a feeling
akin to impatience. Like a sleeper roused from slumber, he shook
himself free from the rattling particles, and, rising to his feet,
skurried to the water’s edge, at the point where he had emerged.
A quick glance showed no one in sight, and stepping into the current
he made his way to the other shore without incident.</p>

<p>His object now was to rejoin his friends as soon as he could,
impart the important tidings he had gained, and help them guard
against the treacherous attempt that was sure to be made against
their lives.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker had told him where to seek himself and Freeman.
They might have shifted their position, but not far. He recalled
the point whence the fatal shot had been fired into the group
of three Apaches, and turned his footsteps thither.</p>

<p>It was destined to be a night of adventure to the daring scout,
for while he was making his way along shore, two horsemen suddenly
loomed to view. They were on the other side of the stream, however,
and he might have taken them for his friends had the light been
less powerful. As it was, the first glance showed them to be hostiles.</p>

<p>It will be understood that in one respect Mendez held an immense
advantage over them, for he knew they were enemies, while they
took him for a friend—a natural mistake, since he belonged to
their own race, and his attire was similar to that of many of
the tribe.</p>

<p>Another incident contributed to the blunder: their own scout
had crossed but a few minutes before. He was on foot, and in height
and general appearance resembled Mendez, while the moonlight was
just faint enough to exclude a close scrutiny.</p>

<p>The distance between the two was so slight that it was easy to
understand each other by using an ordinary conversational tone.</p>

<p>"Cavarho," said one of the horsemen, using the name of the supposed
scout, "why do you seek the white men by the side of the stream?"</p>

<p>"Was it not from this side that they slew one of our bravest
men?" asked Mendez in turn.</p>

<p>"True, but not from that spot."</p>

<p>"It is further up the bank and I am making my way there."</p>

<p>"But in the strong light of the moon they will see you, Cavarho."</p>

<p>"No sooner than they will see you on your horses."</p>

<p>"We shall watch for them."</p>

<p>"And I will do the same."</p>

<p>"Cavarho is our best scout," was the complimentary remark of
the horseman who had done the talking for himself and companion.</p>

<p>And as if nothing more remained to be said, the two wheeled their
ponies and rode off, taking a course that led away from the stream,
as if in respect to the warning their supposed friend had given.</p>

<p>Mendez silently brought his rifle to his shoulder. He could not
have asked a better target and he was certain of bringing down
one if not both of them. He made his aim true and then—lowered
his weapon without firing.</p>

<p>It is not often that an Apache is inspired by anything of a chivalrous
nature, but it was so in this instance. Had the horsemen been
facing him, probably Mendez would have discharged his Winchester,
but with their backs toward him, and without a suspicion of their
danger, even his soul rebelled. He allowed them to ride beyond
range, and never did they know how close they trod the verge of
death.</p>

<p>The scout resumed his guarded advance along the stream and concluded
that he was in the neighborhood of his friends. He halted and
looked around, but saw nothing of them. As far as the eye could
reach, which in the clear atmosphere was further than would be
supposed, the white sand stretched, with the winding stream agleam
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Mendez was on the point of emitting the signal, when once more
the whinny of a horse sounded on the still night air. It startled
him more than any sound he had heard that night, for it was from
his own pony. Its direction left no doubt of that.</p>

<p>The conviction flashed upon him that the hostile who had preceded
him in crossing the stream had come upon his horse and was probably
trying to make off with him. The whole nature of Mendez flamed
up at the outrage. He forgot everything for the moment and set
out to punish the criminal and prevent the success of his daring
purpose.</p>

<p>But intense as was his anger, the scout did not forget the situation.
He was about to confront one of the most daring and skillful of
his own race, who was eager to make him bite the dust.</p>

<p>The suspicion of Mendez was correct. Cavarho, after crossing
the stream, had gone inland and away from the shore, instead of
turning to the left, which would have taken him near the spot
where Lieutenant Decker and Maurice Freeman were awaiting the
return of Mendez and the development of events. This course led
him almost in a straight line to where the pony of the friendly
scout was also awaiting the coming of his master.</p>

<p>Cavarho showed his quickness of perception by discovering the
animal before the latter detected him. The presence of the pony
in this lonely place suggested the proximity of his master, and
the scout did considerable maneuvering before venturing nearer.
A complete circuit of the animal, however, showed that nothing
of that nature was to be feared. Probably Cavarho suspected the
true state of the case, though of course nothing can be said with
certainty on that point. At any rate, having learned that no person
beside himself was in the immediate vicinity, he walked toward
the animal with the intention of making a prisoner of him.</p>

<p>Before this, the horse had perceived him and stood with head
erect, studying the figure as it drew near. His intelligence quickly
told him it was not his master, but a number of soothing expressions
quieted his fears, and he suffered the stranger to come quite
close before taking the alarm.</p>

<p>Cavarho advanced with a slow and almost imperceptible movement,
murmuring gently in his own tongue, while the beast hesitated
whether to permit more familiarity or to bound away.</p>

<p>He decided upon the latter, but deferred the matter just a second
too long. In the act of wheeling, the Apache made a catlike leap
and grasped his forelock, holding him with a grip which could
not be shaken off. The pony uttered an angry whinny and struggled
to free himself, but, unable to do so, quickly gave up the effort.</p>

<p>It was rarely that Mendez used a saddle. He generally preferred
to ride bareback, with a rope or a strap for a halter, his voice
being generally sufficient for all directions. The fact that he
had no bridle or saddle must have given Cavarho an inkling of
the truth and told him that the horse belonged either to Mendez
or Cemuri. Be that as it may, he flung himself upon his back and
became for the moment master of the situation.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that a faint, peculiar cry struck the
ear of the horse, which recognized it as the call of his master.
Instantly he dashed in the direction whence it came. A dozen Cavarhos
would not have been sufficient to restrain or turn the steed aside
from his purpose.</p>

<p>But the acumen of the strange rider told him the meaning of all
this, and he leaped to the ground in a twinkling. As he did so,
he saw the figure of the enraged Mendez bearing down upon him.</p>

<p>There was little time for preparation and none for the peculiar
strategy in which both were experts. Each was armed with a Winchester,
and almost simultaneously they were brought to a level.</p>

<p>Mendez was quick enough to anticipate Cavarho.</p>

<p>The pleased horse, happy to recognize his own master, rubbed
his nose against his cheek, while Mendez petted and uttered many
an endearing expression. It would have been a sore grief to the
scout to lose his precious steed, that had been his faithful companion
in many a perilous experience.</p>

<p>Mendez was on his back the next instant, and keeping in mind
the points of the compass, he readily guided him toward the spot
where he expected to find his friends.</p>

<p>Nor was he disappointed. Lieutenant Decker and Captain Freeman
were on the alert, and, when the familiar whistle of the scout
pierced the still air, there was so little doubt in the mind of
the young officer that he answered it without hesitation.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mendez emerged from the gloom, and, riding
forward a brief space, the two saluted the other.</p>
