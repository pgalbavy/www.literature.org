<p>Perhaps middle-aged people might discern Nature's real intentions
in the matter of pain if they would examine a boy's punishments
and sorrows, for he prolongs neither beyond their actual duration.
With a boy, trouble must be of Homeric dimensions to last overnight.
To him, every next day is really a new day. Thus, Penrod woke,
next morning, with neither the unspared rod, nor Mr. Kinosling
in his mind. Tar, itself, so far as his consideration of it went,
might have been an undiscovered substance. His mood was cheerful
and mercantile; some process having worked mysteriously within
him, during the night, to the result that his first waking thought
was of profits connected with the sale of old iron&mdash;or perhaps
a ragman had passed the house, just before he woke.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock he had formed a partnership with the indeed amiable
Sam, and the firm of Schofield and Williams plunged headlong into
commerce. Heavy dealings in rags, paper, old iron and lead gave
the firm a balance of twenty-two cents on the evening of the third
day; but a venture in glassware, following, proved disappointing
on account of the scepticism of all the druggists in that part
of town, even after seven laborious hours had been spent in cleansing
a wheelbarrow-load of old medicine bottles with hydrant water
and ashes. Likewise, the partners were disheartened by their failure
to dispose of a crop of "greens," although they had uprooted specimens
of that decorative and unappreciated flower, the dandelion, with
such persistence and energy that the Schofields' and Williams'
lawns looked curiously haggard for the rest of that summer.</p>

<p>The fit passed: business languished; became extinct. The dog-days
had set in.</p>

<p>One August afternoon was so hot that even boys sought indoor
shade. In the dimness of the vacant carriage-house of the stable,
lounged Masters Penrod Schofield, Samuel Williams, Maurice Levy,
Georgie Bassett, and Herman. They sat still and talked. It is
a hot day, in rare truth, when boys devote themselves principally
to conversation, and this day was that hot.</p>

<p>Their elders should beware such days. Peril hovers near when
the fierceness of weather forces inaction and boys in groups are
quiet. The more closely volcanoes, Western rivers, nitroglycerin,
and boys are pent, the deadlier is their action at the point of
outbreak. Thus, parents and guardians should look for outrages
of the most singular violence and of the most peculiar nature
during the confining weather of February and August.</p>

<p>The thing which befell upon this broiling afternoon began to
brew and stew peacefully enough. All was innocence and languor;
no one could have foretold the eruption.</p>

<p>They were upon their great theme: "When I get to be a man!" Being
human, though boys, they considered their present estate too commonplace
to be dwelt upon. So, when the old men gather, they say: "When
I was a boy!"  It really is the land of nowadays that we never
discover.</p>

<p>"When I'm a man," said Sam Williams, "I'm goin' to hire me a
couple of coloured waiters to swing me in a hammock and keep pourin'
ice-water on me all day out o' those waterin'-cans they sprinkle
flowers from. I'll hire you for one of 'em, Herman."</p>

<p>"No; you ain' goin' to," said Herman promptly. "You ain' no flowuh.
But nev' min' nat, anyway. Ain' nobody goin' haih me whens <em>I</em>'m
a man. Goin' be my own boss. <em>I</em>'m go' be a rai'road man!"</p>

<p>"You mean like a superintendent, or sumpthing like that, and
sell tickets?" asked Penrod.</p>

<p>"Sup'in&mdash;nev' min' nat! Sell ticket? NO suh! Go' be a PO'tuh!
My uncle a po'tuh right now. Solid gole buttons&mdash;oh, oh!"</p>

<p>"Generals get a lot more buttons than porters," said Penrod.
"Generals&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Po'tuhs make the bes' l'vin'," Herman interrupted. "My uncle
spen' mo' money 'n any white man n'is town."</p>

<p>"Well, I rather be a general," said Penrod, "or a senator, or
sumpthing like that."</p>

<p>"Senators live in Warshington," Maurice Levy contributed the
information. "I been there. Warshington ain't so much; Niag'ra
Falls is a hundred times as good as Warshington. So's 'Tlantic
City, I was there, too. I been everywhere there is. I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Sam Williams, raising his voice in order
to obtain the floor, "anyway, I'm goin' to lay in a hammock all
day, and have ice-water sprinkled on top o' me, and I'm goin'
to lay there all night, too, and the next day. I'm goin' to lay
there a couple o' years, maybe."</p>

<p>"I bet you don't!" exclaimed Maurice. "What'd you do in winter?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do when it's winter, out in a hammock with
water sprinkled on top o' you all day? I bet you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'd stay right there," Sam declared, with strong conviction,
blinking as he looked out through the open doors at the dazzling
lawn and trees, trembling in the heat. "They couldn't sprinkle
too much for ME!"</p>

<p>"It'd make icicles all over you, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I wish it would," said Sam. "I'd eat 'em up."</p>

<p>"And it'd snow on you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yay! I'd swaller it as fast as it'd come down. I wish I had
a <em>BARREL </em>o' snow right now. I wish this whole barn was
full of it. I wish they wasn't anything in the whole world except
just good ole snow."</p>

<p>Penrod and Herman rose and went out to the hydrant, where they
drank long and ardently. Sam was still talking about snow when
they returned.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't just roll in it. I'd stick it all round inside
my clo'es, and fill my hat. No, I'd freeze a big pile of it all
hard, and I'd roll her out flat and then I'd carry her down to
some ole tailor's and have him make me a <em>SUIT </em>out of
her, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Can't you keep still about your ole snow?" demanded Penrod petulantly.
"Makes me so thirsty I can't keep still, and I've drunk so much
now I bet I bust. That ole hydrant water's mighty near hot anyway."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to have a big store, when I grow up," volunteered
Maurice.</p>

<p>"Candy store?" asked Penrod.</p>

<p>"NO, sir! I'll have candy in it, but not to eat, so much. It's
goin' to be a deportment store: ladies' clothes, gentlemen's clothes,
neckties, china goods, leather goods, nice lines in woollings
and lace goods&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yay! I wouldn't give a five-for-a-cent marble for your whole
store,"  said Sam. "Would you, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Not for ten of 'em; not for a million of 'em! <em>I</em>'m goin'
to have&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" clamoured Maurice. "You'd be foolish, because they'd
be a toy deportment in my store where they'd be a hunderd marbles!
So, how much would you think your five-for-a-cent marble counts
for? And when I'm keepin' my store I'm goin' to get married."</p>

<p>"Yay!" shrieked Sam derisively. "<em>MARRIED! </em>Listen!" Penrod
and Herman joined in the howl of contempt.</p>

<p>"Certumly I'll get married," asserted Maurice stoutly. "I'll
get married to Marjorie Jones. She likes me awful good, and I'm
her beau."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" inquired Penrod in a cryptic voice.</p>

<p>"Because she's my beau, too," came the prompt answer. "I'm her
beau because she's my beau; I guess that's plenty reason! I'll
get married to her as soon as I get my store running nice."</p>

<p>Penrod looked upon him darkly, but, for the moment, held his
peace.</p>

<p>"Married!" jeered Sam Williams. "Married to Marjorie Jones! You're
the only boy I ever heard say he was going to get married. I wouldn't
get married for&mdash;why, I wouldn't for&mdash;for&#11834;" Unable to think
of any inducement the mere mention of which would not be ridiculously
incommensurate, he proceeded: "I wouldn't do it! What you want
to get married for? What do married people do, except just come
home tired, and worry around and kind of scold? You better not
do it, M'rice; you'll be mighty sorry."</p>

<p>"Everybody gets married," stated Maurice, holding his ground.</p>

<p>"They gotta."</p>

<p>"I'll bet <em>I</em> don't!" Sam returned hotly. "They better
catch me before they tell ME I have to. Anyway, I bet nobody has
to get married unless they want to."</p>

<p>"They do, too," insisted Maurice. "They <em>GOTTA</em>!"</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Look at what my own papa told me!" cried Maurice, heated with
argument. "Didn't he tell me your papa had to marry your mamma,
or else he never'd got to handle a cent of her money? Certumly,
people gotta marry. Everybody. You don't know anybody over twenty
years old that isn't married&mdash;except maybe teachers."</p>

<p>"Look at policemen!" shouted Sam triumphantly. "You don't s'pose
anybody can make policemen get married, I reckon, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, policemen, maybe," Maurice was forced to admit. "Policemen
and teachers don't, but everybody else gotta."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be a policeman," said Sam. "<em>THEN I </em>guess
they won't come around tellin' me I have to get married. What
you goin' to be, Penrod?"</p>

<p>"Chief police," said the laconic Penrod.</p>

<p>"What you?" Sam inquired of quiet Georgie Bassett.</p>

<p>"I am going to be," said Georgie, consciously, "a minister."</p>

<p>This announcement created a sensation so profound that it was
followed by silence. Herman was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"You mean preachuh?" he asked incredulously. "You go' <em>PREACH</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Georgie, looking like Saint Cecilia at the organ.</p>

<p>Herman was impressed. "You know all 'at preachuh talk?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to learn it," said Georgie simply.</p>

<p>"How loud kin you holler?" asked Herman doubtfully.</p>

<p>"He can't holler at all," Penrod interposed with scorn. "He hollers
like a girl. He's the poorest hollerer in town!"</p>

<p>Herman shook his head. Evidently he thought Georgie's chance
of being ordained very slender. Nevertheless, a final question
put to the candidate by the coloured expert seemed to admit one
ray of hope.</p>

<p>"How good kin you clim a pole?"</p>

<p>"He can't climb one at all," Penrod answered for Georgie. "Over
at Sam's turning-pole you ought to see him try to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Preachers don't have to climb poles," Georgie said with dignity.</p>

<p>"<em>GOOD </em>ones do," declared Herman. "Bes' one ev' <em>I</em>
hear, he clim up an' down same as a circus man. One n'em big 'vivals
outen whens we livin' on a fahm, preachuh clim big pole right
in a middle o' the church, what was to hol' roof up. He clim way
high up, an' holler: 'Goin' to heavum, goin' to heavum, goin'
to heavum <em>NOW. </em>Hallelujah, praise my Lawd!' An' he slide
down little, an' holler: 'Devil's got a hol' o' my coat-tails;
devil tryin' to drag me down! Sinnuhs, take wawnun! Devil got
a hol' o' my coat-tails; I'm a-goin' to hell, oh Lawd!' Nex',
he clim up little mo', an' yell an' holler: 'Done shuck ole devil
loose; goin' straight to heavum agin! Goin' to heavum, goin' to
heavum, my Lawd!' Nex', he slide down some mo' an' holler, 'Leggo
my coat-tails, ole devil! Goin' to hell agin, sinnuhs! Goin' straight
to hell, my Lawd!' An' he clim an' he slide, an' he slide, an'
he clim, an' all time holler: 'Now 'm a-goin' to heavum; now 'm
a-goin' to hell! Goin'to heavum, heavum, heavum, my Lawd!' Las'
he slide all a-way down, jes' a-squallin' an' a-kickin' an' a-rarin'
up an' squealin', 'Goin' to hell. Goin' to hell! Ole Satum got
my soul! Goin' to hell! Goin' to hell! Goin' to hell, hell, hell!"</p>

<p>Herman possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting
which is the great native gift of his race, and he enchained his
listeners. They sat fascinated and spellbound.</p>

<p>"Herman, tell that again!" said Penrod, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Herman, nothing loath, accepted the encore and repeated the Miltonic
episode, expanding it somewhat, and dwelling with a fine art upon
those portions of the narrative which he perceived to be most
exciting to his audience. Plainly, they thrilled less to Paradise
gained than to its losing, and the dreadful climax of the descent
into the Pit was the greatest treat of all.</p>

<p>The effect was immense and instant. Penrod sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Georgie Bassett couldn't do that to save his life," he declared.
"<em>I</em>'m goin' to be a preacher! I'D be all right for one,
wouldn't I, Herman?"</p>

<p>"So am I!" Sam Williams echoed loudly. "I guess I can do it if
<em>YOU </em>can. I'd be better'n Penrod, wouldn't I, Herman?"</p>

<p>"I am, too!" Maurice shouted. "I got a stronger voice than anybody
here, and I'd like to know what&#11834;"</p>

<p>The three clamoured together indistinguishably, each asserting
his qualifications for the ministry according to Herman's theory,
which had been accepted by these sudden converts without question.</p>

<p>"Listen to ME!" Maurice bellowed, proving his claim to at least
the voice by drowning the others. "Maybe I can't climb a pole
so good, but who can holler louder'n this? Listen to <em>ME-E-E</em>!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" cried Penrod, irritated. "Go to heaven; go to hell!"</p>

<p>"Oo-o-oh!" exclaimed Georgie Bassett, profoundly shocked.</p>

<p>Sam and Maurice, awed by Penrod's daring, ceased from turmoil,
staring wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"You cursed and swore!" said Georgie.</p>

<p>"I did not!" cried Penrod, hotly. "That isn't swearing."</p>

<p>"You said, 'Go to a big H'!" said Georgie.</p>

<p>"I did not! I said, 'Go to heaven,' before I said a big H. That
isn't swearing, is it, Herman? It's almost what the preacher said,
ain't it, Herman? It ain't swearing now, any more&mdash;not if you
put 'go to heaven' with it, is it, Herman? You can say it all
you want to, long as you say 'go to heaven' first, <em>CAN'T </em>you,
Herman? Anybody can say it if the preacher says it, can't they,
Herman? I guess I know when I ain't swearing, don't I, Herman?"</p>

<p>Judge Herman ruled for the defendant, and Penrod was considered
to have carried his point. With fine consistency, the conclave
established that it was proper for the general public to "say
it," provided "go to heaven" should in all cases precede it. This
prefix was pronounced a perfect disinfectant, removing all odour
of impiety or insult; and, with the exception of Georgie Bassett
(who maintained that the minister's words were "going" and "gone,"
not "go"), all the boys proceeded to exercise their new privilege
so lavishly that they tired of it.</p>

<p>But there was no diminution of evangelical ardour; again were
heard the clamours of dispute as to which was the best qualified
for the ministry, each of the claimants appealing passionately
to Herman, who, pleased but confused, appeared to be incapable
of arriving at a decision.</p>

<p>During a pause, Georgie Bassett asserted his prior rights. "Who
said it first, I'd like to know?" he demanded. "I was going to
be a minister from long back of to-day, I guess. And I guess I
said I was going to be a minister right to-day before any of you
said anything at all. <em>DIDN'T I, </em>Herman? <em>YOU </em>heard
me, didn't you, Herman? That's the very thing started you talking
about it, wasn't it, Herman?"</p>

<p>"You' right," said Herman. "You the firs' one to say it."</p>

<p>Penrod, Sam, and Maurice immediately lost faith in Herman.</p>

<p>"What if you did say it first?" Penrod shouted. "You couldn't
BE a minister if you were a hunderd years old!"</p>

<p>"I bet his mother wouldn't let him be one," said Sam. "She never
lets him do anything."</p>

<p>"She would, too," retorted Georgie. "Ever since I was little,
she&#11834;"</p>

<p>"He's too sissy to be a preacher!" cried Maurice. "Listen at
his squeaky voice!"</p>

<p>"I'm going to be a better minister," shouted Georgie, "than all
three of you put together. I could do it with my left hand!"</p>

<p>The three laughed bitingly in chorus. They jeered, derided, scoffed,
and raised an uproar which would have had its effect upon much
stronger nerves than Georgie's. For a time he contained his rising
choler and chanted monotonously, over and over: "I <em>COULD!
I COULD, TOO! I COULD! I COULD, TOO!" </em>But their tumult wore
upon him, and he decided to avail himself of the recent decision
whereby a big H was rendered innocuous and unprofane. Having used
the expression once, he found it comforting, and substituted it
for: "I could! I could, too!"</p>

<p>But it relieved him only temporarily. His tormentors were unaffected
by it and increased their howlings, until at last Georgie lost
his head altogether. Badgered beyond bearing, his eyes shining
with a wild light, he broke through the besieging trio, hurling
little Maurice from his path with a frantic hand.</p>

<p>"I'll show you!" he cried, in this sudden frenzy. "You give me
a chance, and I'll prove it right <em>NOW</em>!"</p>

<p>"That's talkin' business!" shouted Penrod. "Everybody keep still
a minute. Everybody!"</p>

<p>He took command of the situation at once, displaying a fine capacity
for organization and system. It needed only a few minutes to set
order in the place of confusion and to determine, with the full
concurrence of all parties, the conditions under which Georgie
Bassett was to defend his claim by undergoing what may be perhaps
intelligibly defined as the Herman test. Georgie declared he could
do it easily. He was in a state of great excitement and in no
condition to think calmly or, probably, he would not have made
the attempt at all. Certainly he was overconfident.</p>
