<p>Billy Woodchuck grew so fast that he soon looked very much like his
father. Of course, he was still much smaller than Mr. Woodchuck.
But like him, Billy was quite gray; and he had whiskers,
too--though, to be sure, those were black. His eyes also were black
and large and bright. When Billy sat up on his hind legs--as he
often did--he appeared for all the world like a huge squirrel.
</p>
<p>In fact, some of Billy's friends remarked how like a squirrel he
looked. And one day when Billy was playing near the edge of the
woods a disagreeable young hedgehog told him that. To tell the
truth, Billy Woodchuck had grown to be the least bit vain. He loved
to gaze upon his bushy tail; and he spent a good deal of time
stroking his whiskers. He hoped that the neighbors had noticed
them.
</p><p>Now, other people are always quick to see when anyone is silly in
that way. And the young hedgehog thought that Billy Woodchuck
needed taking down a peg. So he said to him:
</p><p>"Why don't you join the circus?"
</p><p>"Circus? What's that?" Billy asked.
</p><p>"A circus is a place where they have all kinds of freaks," the
hedgehog answered with a sly smile--"giants and dwarfs, and thin
people and fat people."
</p><p>"But I'm not a freak," Billy Woodchuck replied. "Of course, I'm big
for my age. But I'm not a giant."
</p><p>"Yes, you are," the hedgehog insisted.
</p><p>"You're a giant squirrel. You look like <u>him</u>"--he pointed to a
young fellow called Frisky Squirrel--"only you're ever so much
bigger."
</p><p>That made Billy Woodchuck very angry. And he began to chatter and
scold.
</p><p>Wise old Mr. Crow, who sat in a tree nearby, told him to keep his
temper.
</p><p>"Certainly you are not a squirrel," he said. "It is nonsense to say
that a ground hog is the same as a squirrel----"
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck's voice broke into a shrill scream. A <u>ground hog</u>!
He was terribly angry.
</p><p>"Why, yes!" Mr. Crow said, nodding his head with a knowing air.
"You're a marmot, you know."
</p><p>"No, I'm not!" Billy cried. "I'm a woodchuck! That's what I am. And
I'm going home and tell my mother what horrid names you've been
calling me."
</p><p>Mr. Crow laughed. He said nothing more. But as Billy hurried away
he could hear the young hedgehog calling:
</p><p>"Ground hog! Marmot! Ground hog! Marmot!" over and over again.
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck was surprised to see how calm his mother was when
he told her those horrid names. He had rather expected that she
would hurry over to the woods and say a few things to that young
hedgehog, and to old Mr. Crow as well. But she only said:
</p><p>"Don't be silly! Of course you're a ground hog. You're an American
marmot, too. Though our family has been known in this neighborhood
for many years as the Woodchuck family, you needn't be ashamed of
either of those other names. Isn't 'ground hog' every bit as good a
name as 'hedgehog?'"
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck began to think it was. And as for "marmot"--that
began to have quite a fine sound in his ears.
</p><p>"Why can't we change our name to that?" he asked his mother.
</p><p>But Mrs. Woodchuck shook her head.
</p><p>"We are plain country people," she said. "Woodchuck is the best
name for us."
