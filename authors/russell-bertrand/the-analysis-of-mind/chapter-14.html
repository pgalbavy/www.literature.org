<p>On the two subjects of the present lecture I have nothing original
to say, and I am treating them only in order to complete the discussion
of my main thesis, namely that all psychic phenomena are built
up out of sensations and images alone.</p>

<p>Emotions are traditionally regarded by psychologists as a separate
class of mental occurrences: I am, of course, not concerned to
deny the obvious fact that they have characteristics which make
a special investigation of them necessary. What I am concerned
with is the analysis of emotions. It is clear that an emotion
is essentially complex, and we have to inquire whether it ever
contains any non-physiological material not reducible to sensations
and images and their relations.</p>

<p>Although what specially concerns us is the analysis of emotions,
we shall find that the more important topic is the physiological
causation of emotions. This is a subject upon which much valuable
and exceedingly interesting work has been done, whereas the bare
analysis of emotions has proved somewhat barren. In view of the
fact that we have defined perceptions, sensations, and images
by their physiological causation, it is evident that our problem
of the analysis of the emotions is bound up with the problem of
their physiological causation.</p>

<p>Modern views on the causation of emotions begin with what is
called the James-Lange theory. James states this view in the following
terms ("Psychology," vol. ii, p. 449):</p>

<p>"Our natural way of thinking about these coarser emotions, grief,
fear, rage, love, is that the mental perception of some fact excites
the mental affection called the emotion, and that this latter
state of mind gives rise to the bodily expression. My theory,
on the contrary, is that <em>THE BODILY CHANGES FOLLOW DIRECTLY
THE PERCEPTION OF THE EXCITING FACT, AND THAT OUR FEELING OF THE
SAME CHANGES AS THEY OCCUR <em>IS</em> THE EMOTION (</em>James's
italics). Common sense says: we lose our fortune, are sorry and
weep; we meet a bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted
by a rival, are angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended
says that this order of sequence is incorrect, that the one mental
state is not immediately induced by the other, that the bodily
manifestations must first be interposed between, and that the
more rational statement is that we feel sorry because we cry,
angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and not that
we cry, strike, or tremble, because we are sorry, angry, or fearful,
as the case may be. Without the bodily states following on the
perception, the latter would be purely cognitive in form, pale,
colourless, destitute of emotional warmth."</p>

<p>Round this hypothesis a very voluminous literature has grown
up. The history of its victory over earlier criticism, and its
difficulties with the modern experimental work of Sherrington
and Cannon, is well told by James R. Angell in an article called
"A Reconsideration of James's Theory of Emotion in the Light of
Recent Criticisms."* In this article Angell defends James's theory
and to me&mdash;though I speak with diffidence on a question as to
which I have little competence&mdash;it appears that his defence is
on the whole successful.</p>

<p>Sherrington, by experiments on dogs, showed that many of the
usual marks of emotion were present in their behaviour even when,
by severing the spinal cord in the lower cervical region, the
viscera were cut off from all communication with the brain, except
that existing through certain cranial nerves. He mentions the
various signs which "contributed to indicate the existence of
an emotion as lively as the animal had ever shown us before the
spinal operation had been made."* He infers that the physiological
condition of the viscera cannot be the cause of the emotion displayed
under such circumstances, and concludes: "We are forced back toward
the likelihood that the visceral expression of emotion is <em>SECONDARY
</em>to the cerebral action occurring with the psychical state....
We may with James accept visceral and organic sensations and the
memories and associations of them as contributory to primitive
emotion, but we must regard them as re-enforcing rather than as
initiating the psychosis."*</p>

<p>Angell suggests that the display of emotion in such cases may
be due to past experience, generating habits which would require
only the stimulation of cerebral reflex arcs. Rage and some forms
of fear, however, may, he thinks, gain expression without the
brain. Rage and fear have been especially studied by Cannon, whose
work is of the greatest importance. His results are given in his
book, "Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage" (D. Appleton
and Co., 1916).</p>

<p>The most interesting part of Cannon's book consists in the investigation
of the effects produced by secretion of adrenin. Adrenin is a
substance secreted into the blood by the adrenal glands. These
are among the ductless glands, the functions of which, both in
physiology and in connection with the emotions, have only come
to be known during recent years. Cannon found that pain, fear
and rage occurred in circumstances which affected the supply of
adrenin, and that an artificial injection of adrenin could, for
example, produce all the symptoms of fear. He studied the effects
of adrenin on various parts of the body; he found that it causes
the pupils to dilate, hairs to stand erect, blood vessels to be
constricted, and so on. These effects were still produced if the
parts in question were removed from the body and kept alive artificially.*</p>

* Cannon's work is not unconnected with that of Mosso, who<br/>
maintains, as the result of much experimental work, that<br/>
"the seat of the emotions lies in the sympathetic nervous<br/>
system." An account of the work of both these men will be<br/>
found in Goddard's "Psychology of the Normal and Sub-normal"<br/>
(Kegan Paul, 1919), chap. vii and Appendix.

</p>
</div>
<p>Cannon's chief argument against James is, if I understand him
rightly, that similar affections of the viscera may accompany
dissimilar emotions, especially fear and rage. Various different
emotions make us cry, and therefore it cannot be true to say,
as James does, that we "feel sorry because we cry," since sometimes
we cry when we feel glad. This argument, however, is by no means
conclusive against James, because it cannot be shown that there
are no visceral differences for different emotions, and indeed
it is unlikely that this is the case.</p>

<p>As Angell says (loc. cit.): "Fear and joy may both cause cardiac
palpitation, but in one case we find high tonus of the skeletal
muscles, in the other case relaxation and the general sense of
weakness."</p>

<p>Angell's conclusion, after discussing the experiments of Sherrington
and Cannon, is: "I would therefore submit that, so far as concerns
the critical suggestions by these two psychologists, James's essential
contentions are not materially affected." If it were necessary
for me to take sides on this question, I should agree with this
conclusion; but I think my thesis as to the analysis of emotion
can be maintained without coming to a probably premature conclusion
upon the doubtful parts of the physiological problem.</p>

<p>According to our definitions, if James is right, an emotion may
be regarded as involving a confused perception of the viscera
concerned in its causation, while if Cannon and Sherrington are
right, an emotion involves a confused perception of its external
stimulus. This follows from what was said in Lecture <em>VII.
</em>We there defined a perception as an appearance, however irregular,
of one or more objects external to the brain. And in order to
be an appearance of one or more objects, it is only necessary
that the occurrence in question should be connected with them
by a continuous chain, and should vary when they are varied sufficiently.
Thus the question whether a mental occurrence can be called a
perception turns upon the question whether anything can be inferred
from it as to its causes outside the brain: if such inference
is possible, the occurrence in question will come within our definition
of a perception. And in that case, according to the definition
in Lecture <em>VIII, </em>its non-mnemic elements will be sensations.
Accordingly, whether emotions are caused by changes in the viscera
or by sensible objects, they contain elements which are sensations
according to our definition.</p>

<p>An emotion in its entirety is, of course, something much more
complex than a perception. An emotion is essentially a process,
and it will be only what one may call a cross-section of the emotion
that will be a perception, of a bodily condition according to
James, or (in certain cases) of an external object according to
his opponents. An emotion in its entirety contains dynamic elements,
such as motor impulses, desires, pleasures and pains. Desires
and pleasures and pains, according to the theory adopted in Lecture
<em>III, </em>are characteristics of processes, not separate ingredients.
An emotion&mdash;rage, for example&mdash;will be a certain kind of process,
consisting of perceptions and (in general) bodily movements. The
desires and pleasures and pains involved are properties of this
process, not separate items in the stuff of which the emotion
is composed. The dynamic elements in an emotion, if we are right
in our analysis, contain, from our point of view, no ingredients
beyond those contained in the processes considered in Lecture
<em>III. </em>The ingredients of an emotion are only sensations
and images and bodily movements succeeding each other according
to a certain pattern. With this conclusion we may leave the emotions
and pass to the consideration of the will.</p>

<p>The first thing to be defined when we are dealing with Will is
a <em>VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT. </em>We have already defined vital movements,
and we have maintained that, from a behaviourist standpoint, it
is impossible to distinguish which among such movements are reflex
and which voluntary. Nevertheless, there certainly is a distinction.
When we decide in the morning that it is time to get up, our consequent
movement is voluntary. The beating of the heart, on the other
hand, is involuntary: we can neither cause it nor prevent it by
any decision of our own, except indirectly, as e.g. by drugs.
Breathing is intermediate between the two: we normally breathe
without the help of the will, but we can alter or stop our breathing
if we choose.</p>

<p>James ("Psychology," chap. xxvi) maintains that the only distinctive
characteristic of a voluntary act is that it involves an idea
of the movement to be performed, made up of memory-images of the
kinaesthetic sensations which we had when the same movement occurred
on some former occasion. He points out that, on this view, no
movement can be made voluntarily unless it has previously occurred
involuntarily.*</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>I see no reason to doubt the correctness of this view. We shall
say, then, that movements which are accompanied by kinaesthetic
sensations tend to be caused by the images of those sensations,
and when so caused are called <em>VOLUNTARY</em>.</p>

<p>Volition, in the emphatic sense, involves something more than
voluntary movement. The sort of case I am thinking of is decision
after deliberation. Voluntary movements are a part of this, but
not the whole. There is, in addition to them, a judgment: "This
is what I shall do"; there is also a sensation of tension during
doubt, followed by a different sensation at the moment of deciding.
I see no reason whatever to suppose that there is any specifically
new ingredient; sensations and images, with their relations and
causal laws, yield all that seems to be wanted for the analysis
of the will, together with the fact that kinaesthetic images tend
to cause the movements with which they are connected. Conflict
of desires is of course essential in the causation of the emphatic
kind of will: there will be for a time kinaesthetic images of
incompatible movements, followed by the exclusive image of the
movement which is said to be willed. Thus will seems to add no
new irreducible ingredient to the analysis of the mind.</p>
