<p>As winter faded into spring the first tracery of green fringed
the branches in Stuyvesant Square. The municipal authorities decorated
the grass with tulips and later with geraniums. Later still, cannas
and foliage plants were planted, over which two fountains spurted
aqua Crotonis.</p>

<p>But in spite of tasteless horticulture it is a quaint old square,
a little sad and shabby, perhaps, yet mercifully green inside
its two iron-railed parallelograms. Above the great sycamores
and elms the truncated towers of St. George's brood heavily; along
the short, leafy reach of Rutherford Place an old-time Quaker
meeting-house keeps gentle vigil; northward, aged mansions peer
at the square through time-dimmed windows; south, above the Sisters
of The Assumption, a painted Virgin clasps her stone hands and
looks down on the little children of the poor.</p>

<p>Along the east side of the square runs Livingston Place; behind
it an elevated railroad roars; in front lies the square, shabby,
unkempt, but lovely always, when night lends to it her mystery.
For at night the trees loom gigantic; lights sparkle over lawn
and fountain; the illuminated dial of St. George's hangs yellow
as a harvest moon above the foliage; and the pleasant bell sounds
from the towers, changing, for a moment, the streets' incessant
monotone to a harmony.</p>

<p>Into this square went Landon; oftener, as the summer grew hotter
and work grew scarcer.</p>

<p>Once, at the close of a scorching afternoon, his pretty neighbour
from across the corridor came slowly into the square and rested
for a few moments on the same bench he occupied.</p>

<p>So lovely and fresh and sweet she seemed in the early dusk that
he, for an instant, was tempted from his parched loneliness to
speak to her; but before he could bring himself to it she turned,
recognized him, rose and went back to the house without a second
glance.</p>

<p>"We've been neighbours for a year," he thought, "and she has
never been civil enough to look at me yet&mdash;and I've been too civil
to look at her. I was an ass."</p>

<p>He was wrong; she had looked at him often, when unafraid that
his eyes might surprise her.</p>

<p>He was amusingly wrong. Waking, she remembered him; during the
long day she thought of him; at night, when she returned from
business, the radiance from his studio lamp streaming through
the transom had for her all the thrilling fascination that a lighted
shop window, at Christmas, has for a lonesome child passing in
darkness.</p>

<p>From the dim monotony of her own life she had, at times, caught
glimpses through his open door of splendours scarcely guessed.
In her eyes an enchanted world lay just beyond his studio's threshold;
a bright, warm, mellow wonderland, indistinct in the golden lamplight,
where only a detail here and there half revealed a figured tapestry
or carved foliation&mdash;perhaps some soft miracle of ancient Eastern
weaving on the floor, perhaps a mysterious marble shape veiled
in ruddy shadow&mdash;enough to set her youthful imagination on fire,
enough to check her breath and start the pulses racing as she
turned the key in her own door and reëntered the white dusk of
her own life once more.</p>

<p>The three most important events of her brief career had occurred
within the twelvemonth&mdash;her mother's death, her coming here to
live&mdash;and love. That also had happened. But she did not call it
love; it did not occur to her to consider him in any possible,
tangible relation to herself.</p>

<p>She never even expected to know him, to speak to him, or that
he could possibly care to speak to her. As far as the east is
from the west, so far apart were their two worlds. For them the
gusty corridor was wider than interstellar voids; she had not
even a thought that a miracle might bridge the infinite from her
tiny world to his, which seemed to her so bright and splendid;
she had never advanced farther than the happiness of lying still
after the day's work, and thinking, innocently, of what she knew
about him and what she timidly divined.</p>

<p>At such times, stretched across her bed, the backs of her hands
resting on her closed lids, she pondered on that alluring wonderland,
his studio&mdash;of the mystery that so fittingly surrounded his artist's
life. She saw him always amid the tints and hues of ancient textiles,
sometimes dreaming, sometimes achieving with fiery inspiration&mdash;but
precisely how or what he achieved remained to her part of his
mystery. She cherished only the confused vision of the youth of
him, and its glorious energy and wisdom.</p>

<p>He could be very human, too, she thought; and often the smile
curved her lips and cheeks at the recollection of the noisy gayety
coming in gusts through his transom on those nights when his friends
were gathered there&mdash;laughter and song&mdash;the incense of tobacco
drifting into her own white room from the corridor. She loved
it; the odor seemed spicy with a delicate hint of sweet-brier,
and she opened her transom wider to let it in.</p>

<p>Usually she fell asleep, the distant uproar of gayety lulling
her into happier slumbers. And for days and nights afterward its
recollection made life easier and pleasanter, as though she lived
with amusing memories of events in which she herself had participated.</p>

<p>All day long, in a fashionable dry-goods shop, she sold cobweb
finery and frail, intimate, lacy stuffs to very fine ladies, who
usually drew a surprised breath at her beauty, and sometimes dealt
with her as though they were dealing with one of their own caste.</p>

<p>At night, tired, she looked forward to her return, when, behind
her own closed door, she could rest or read a little, or lie still
and think of Landon. But even in the daring magic of waking dreams
she had scarcely ventured any acquaintance with him; in dreamland
they were as yet only just aware of one another. He had lately&mdash;oh,
breathless and audacious imagination of hers!&mdash;smiled at her in
the corridors of dreamland; and she had been a good many days
trying to decide what she was going to do about it. In her phantom
world matters were going well with her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, except for the stupefying heat, the actual world was
also going well with her. She had saved a little money, enough
to give her ten days of luxury and fresh air when the time came.
She needed it; the city had been hard on her. Yet the pleasure
of going was not unmixed; for, as the day of her release drew
nearer, she realized how, within the year, he had, in her dreams,
insensibly become to her a part of her real life, and that she
would miss him sorely. Which gave her courage to hasten their
acquaintance in dreamland; and so it came about that he spoke
to her one night as she lay dreaming, awake on her pillow; and
she felt her cheeks burn in the dark as though it had all been
real.</p>

<p>Yet he was very gentle with her in dreamland&mdash;quite wonderful&mdash;indeed,
all that the most stilted vision of a young girl could desire.</p>

<p>Less unquiet, now that they knew each other, she looked forward
to the real separation with comparative resignation.</p>

<p>Then came that unexpected episode when she seated herself on
the same bench with him, unintentionally braving him in the flesh.</p>

<p>All that night she thought about it in consternation&mdash;piteously
explaining it to him in dreamland. He understood&mdash;in dreamland&mdash;but
did he understand in real life? Would he think she had meant to
give him a chance to speak&mdash;horror of crimson dismay! Would he
think her absurd to leave so abruptly when he caught her eye?
And oh, she cared so much what he might think, so much more than
she supposed she dared care!</p>

<p>All day long it made her miserable as she moved listlessly behind
the counter; at night the heated pavements almost stunned her
as she walked home to save the pennies.</p>

<p>She saw no light in his studio as she slipped through the corridor
into her stifling room. Later, she bathed and dressed in a thinner
gown, but it, also, was in black, in memory of her mother, and
seemed to sere her body. The room grew hotter; she went out to
the passage; no light threatened her from his transom, so she
ventured to leave her door open.</p>

<p>But even this brought no relief; the heat became unendurable;
and she rose at last, pinned on her big black hat of straw, and
went out into the dusk.</p>

<p>Through the gates of the square she saw the poor surging into
the park. The police had opened the scant bits of lawn to them.
Men, women, children, lay half-naked on the grass, fighting for
breath. And, after a little while, she crossed the street and
went in among them.</p>

<p>The splash of the fountain was refreshing. She wandered at random,
past the illuminated façade of the Lying-in Hospital, past the
painted Virgin, then crossed Second Avenue, entered the gates
again, and turned aimlessly by the second fountain. There seemed
to be no resting-place for her on the crowded benches.</p>

<p>Beyond the fountain a shadowy sycamore stood in the centre of
a strip of lawn. She went toward it, hesitated, glancing at the
motionless, recumbent figures near by, then ventured to seat herself
on the grass and lean back against the tree. Presently, she unpinned
her hat, lifted a white face to the night, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>How long she sat there she did not know when again she opened
her tired lids.</p>

<p>A figure stood near her. For a moment she confused dream and
reality and smiled at him; then sat up, rigid, breathless, as
the figure stirred and came forward.</p>

<p>She remembered attempting to rise, remembered nothing else very
distinctly&mdash;not even his first words, though his voice was gentle
and pleasant, just as it was in dreamland.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my speaking to you?" he was asking now.</p>

<p>"No," she said faintly.</p>

<p>He raised his head and looked out across the feverish city, passing
one thin hand across his eyes. Then, with a slight movement of
his shoulders, he seated himself on the ground at her feet.</p>

<p>"We have been neighbours so long," he said, "that I thought perhaps
I might dare to speak to you to-night. My name is Landon &mdash;James
Landon. I think I know your last name."</p>

<p>"O'Connor&mdash;Ellie O'Connor &mdash;Eleanor, I mean," she added,
unafraid. A curious peace seemed to possess her at the sound of
his voice. There was a stillness in it that reassured.</p>

<p>The silence between them was ringed with the distant roar of
the city. He looked around him at the shadowy forms flung across
bench and lawn; his absent glance swept the surrounding walls
of masonry and iron, all a-glitter with tiny, lighted windows.
Overhead a tarnished moon looked down into the vast trap where
five million souls lay caught, gasping for air&mdash;he among the others&mdash;and
this young girl beside him&mdash;trapped, helpless, foredoomed. The
city had got them all! But he sat up the straighter, giving the
same slightly-impatient shake to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I came," he said, "to ask you one or two questions&mdash;if I may."</p>

<p>"Ask them," she answered, as in a dream.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you go to business, do you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He nodded: "And now I'm going to venture another question which
may sound impertinent, but I do not mean it so. May I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said in a low, hushed voice, as though a clearer tone
might break some spell.</p>

<p>"It is about your salary. I do not suppose it is very large."</p>

<p>"My wages? Shall I tell you?" she asked, so innocently that he
flushed up.</p>

<p>"No, no! &mdash;I merely wish to&mdash;to find out from you whether
you might care to take a chance of increasing your salary."</p>

<p>"I don't think I know what you mean," she said, looking at him.</p>

<p>"I know you don't," he said, patiently; "let me begin a little
farther back. I am a sculptor. You know, of course, what that
is&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I am educated." She even found courage to smile at him.</p>

<p>His answering smile covered both confusion and surprise; then
perplexity etched a crease between his brows.</p>

<p>"That makes it rather harder for me"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"or easier;
I don't know which."</p>

<p>"What makes it harder?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Your being &mdash;I don't know&mdash;different&mdash;from what I imagined&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Educated?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes&#11834;"</p>

<p>She laughed deliciously in her new-born confidence.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish to ask?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," he said. "I need a model&mdash;and I'm too poor to
pay for one. I've pledged everything in my studio. A chance has
come to me. It's only a chance, however. But I can't take it because
I cannot afford a model."</p>

<p>There was a silence; then she inquired what he meant by a model.
And he told her&mdash;not everything, not clearly.</p>

<p>"You mean that you wish me to sit for my portrait in marble?"</p>

<p>"There are two figures to be executed for the new Department
of Peace in Washington," he explained, "and they are to be called
'Soul' and 'Body.' Six sculptors have been invited to compete.
I am one. We have a year before us."</p>

<p>She remained silent.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly apparent, of course, that you are exquis&mdash;admirably
fitted"&mdash;he stammered under her direct gaze, then went on; "I
scarcely dared dream of such a model even if I had the means to
afford&mdash;" He could get no further.</p>

<p>"Are you really poor?" she asked in gentle wonder.</p>

<p>"At present&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed it," she said. "I thought&mdash;otherwise."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing; some day things will come out right. Only
&mdash;I have a chance now&mdash;if you&mdash;if you would help me.... I
<em>could</em> win with you; I know it. And if I do win&mdash;with
your aid &mdash;I will double your present salary. And that is
what I've come here to say. Is that fair?"</p>

<p>He waited, watching her intently. She had dropped her eyes, sitting
there very silent at the foot of the tree, cradling the big straw
hat in her lap.</p>

<p>"Whatever you decide to be fair&mdash;" he began again, but she looked
up wistfully.</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of that," she said; "I was only&mdash;sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry?"</p>

<p>"That you are poor."</p>

<p>He misunderstood her. "I know; I wish I could offer you something
beside a chance&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh-h," she whispered, but so low that he heard only a long,
indrawn breath.</p>

<p>She sat motionless, eyes on the grass. When again she lifted
them their pure beauty held him.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish?" she asked. "That I should be your model
for the&mdash;this prize which you desire to strive for?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for that."</p>

<p>"How can I? I work all day."</p>

<p>"I could use you at night and on Saturday afternoons, and all
day Sunday. And&mdash;have you had your yearly vacation?"</p>

<p>She drew a quietly tired breath. "No," she said.</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I will give you two hundred dollars extra for those
ten days," he went on eagerly&mdash;so eagerly that he forgot the contingency
on which hung any payment at all. As for her, payment was not
even in her thoughts.</p>

<p>Through the deep, sweet content which came to her with the chance
of serving him, ran an undercurrent of confused pain that he could
so blindly misunderstand her. If she thought at all of the amazing
possibility of such a fortune as he offered, she knew that she
would not accept it from him. But this, and the pain of his misunderstanding,
scarcely stirred the current of a strange, new happiness that
flowed through every vein.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could really help you?"</p>

<p>"If you will." His voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Are you sure&mdash;quite sure? If you are &mdash;I will do what you
wish."</p>

<p>He sprang up buoyant, transfigured.</p>

<p>"If I win it will be <em>you</em>!" he said. "Could you come
into the studio a moment? I'll show you the two sketches I have
made for 'Soul' and 'Body'."</p>

<p>On the prospect of a chance&mdash;the chance that had come at last&mdash;he
was completely forgetting that she must be prepared to comprehend
what he required of her; he forgot that she could know nothing
of a sculptor's ways and methods of production. On the way to
the studio, however, he tardily remembered, and it rather scared
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know any painters or sculptors?" he asked, keeping impatient
pace beside her.</p>

<p>"I know a woman who makes casts of hands and arms," she said
shyly. "She stopped me in the street once and asked permission
to cast my hands. Would you call her a sculptor?"</p>

<p>"<em>N&mdash;</em>well, perhaps she may be. We sculptors often use
casts of the human body." He plunged into it more frankly: "You
know, of course, that to become a sculptor or a painter, one has
to model and paint from living people."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, undisturbed.</p>

<p>"And," he continued, "it would be impossible for a sculptor to
produce the beautiful marbles you have seen&mdash;er&mdash;around&mdash;unless
he could pose a living model to copy from."</p>

<p>An unquiet little pulse began to beat in her breast; she looked
up at him, but he was smiling so amiably that she smiled, too.</p>

<p>Mortally afraid of frightening her, he could not exactly estimate
how much she divined of what was to be required of her.</p>

<p>He continued patiently: "Unless a student dissects he can never
become a surgeon. It is the same with us; our inspiration and
originality must be founded on a solid study of the human body.
That is why we must always have before us as perfect a living
model as we can find."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do you think&mdash;" she stopped, pink and confused.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, quietly impersonal, "that, speaking as a
sculptor, you are as perfect and as beautiful a model as ever
the old Greek masters saw, alive or in their dreams."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>did not&mdash;know it," she faltered, thrilling from
head to foot.</p>

<p>They entered the corridor together. Her breath came faster as
he unlocked his door and, turning up a lamp, invited her to enter.</p>

<p>At last in the magic world! And with <em>him</em>!</p>

<p>Figured tapestries hung from the golden mystery of the ceiling;
ancient dyes glowed in the soft rugs under foot; the mellow light
glimmered on dull foliations. She stood still, looking about her
as in a trance.</p>

<p>"All this I will buy back again with your help," he said, laughingly;
but his unsteady voice betrayed the tension to which he was keyed.
A slow excitement was gaining on her, too.</p>

<p>"I will redeem all these things, never fear," he said, gayly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;if you only can.... It is too cruel to take such things
from you."</p>

<p>The emotion in her eyes and voice surprised him for one troubled
moment. Then the selfishness of the artist ignored all else save
the work and the opportunity.</p>

<p>"You <em>will</em> help me, won't you?" he asked. "It is a promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I will."</p>

<p>"Is it a <em>promise</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, wondering.</p>

<p>"Then please sit here. I will bring the sketches. They merely
represent my first idea; they are done without a living model."
He was off, lighting a match as he hastened. A tapestry fell back
into place; she lifted her blue eyes to the faded figures of saints
and seraphim stirring when the fabric moved.</p>
