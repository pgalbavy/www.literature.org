<p>At six minutes after four o'clock on the second afternoon following
Julia's return, Noble Dill closed his own gate behind him and
set forth upon the four-minute walk that would bring him to Julia's.
He wore a bit of scarlet geranium in the buttonhole of his new
light overcoat; he flourished a new walking-stick and new grey
gloves. As for his expression, he might have been a bridegroom.</p>

<p>Passing the mouth of an alley, as he swung along the street,
he was aware of a commotion, of missiles hurled and voices clashed.
In this alley there was a discord: passion and mockery were here
inimically intermingled.</p>

<p>Casting <em>a</em> glance that way, Noble could see but one person;
a boy of fourteen who looked through a crack in a board fence,
steadfastly keeping an eye to this aperture and as continuously
calling through it, holding his head to a level for this purpose,
but at the same time dancing&mdash;and dancing tauntingly, it was conveyed&mdash;with
the other parts of his body. His voice was now sweet, now piercing,
and again far too dulcet with the overkindness of burlesque; and
if, as it seemed, he was unburdening his spleen, his spleen was
a powerful one and gorged. He appeared to be in a torment of tormenting;
and his success was proved by the pounding of bricks, parts of
bricks and rocks of size upon the other side of the fence, as
close to the crack as might be.</p>

<p>"Oh, dolling!" he wailed, his tone poisonously amorous. "Oh,
dolling Henery! Oo's dot de mos' booful eyes in a dray bid nasty
world. Henery! Oh, <em>has</em> I dot booful eyes, dolling Pattywatty?
Yes, I <em>has</em>! I <em>has</em> dot pretty eyes!" His voice
rose unbearably. "<em>Oh</em>, what prettiest eyes I dot! Me and
Herbie Atwater! <em>Oh</em>, my booful eyes! Oh, my <em>booful</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>But even as he reached this apex, the head, shoulders, and arms
of Herbert Atwater rose momentarily above the fence across the
alley, behind the tormentor. Herbert's expression was implacably
resentful, and so was the gesture with which he hurled an object
at the comedian preoccupied with the opposite fence. This object,
upon reaching its goal, as it did more with a splash than a thud,
was revealed as a tomato, presumably in a useless state. The taunter
screamed in astonishment, and after looking vainly for an assailant,
began necessarily to remove his coat.</p>

<p>Noble, passing on, thought he recognized the boy as one of the
Torbin family, but he was not sure, and he had no idea that the
episode was in any possible manner to be connected with his own
recent history. How blindly we walk our ways! As Noble flourished
down the street, there appeared a wan face at a prison window;
and the large eyes looked out upon him wistfully. But Noble went
on, as unwitting that he had to do with this prison as that he
had to do with Master Torbin's tomato.</p>

<p>The face at the window was not like Charlotte Corday's, nor was
the window barred, though the prisoner knew a little solace in
wondering if she did not suggest that famous picture. For all
purposes, except during school hours, the room was certainly a
cell; and the term of imprisonment was set at three days. Uncle
Joseph had been unable to remain at the movies forever: people
do have to go home eventually, especially when accompanied by
thirteen-year-old great-nieces. Florence had finally to face the
question awaiting her; and it would have been better for her had
she used less imagination in her replies.</p>

<p>Yet she was not wholly despondent as her eyes followed the disappearing
figure of Noble Dill. His wholesome sprightliness was visible
at any distance; and who would not take a little pride in having
been even the mistaken instrument of saving so gay a young man
from the loss of his reason? No; Florence was not cast down. Day-after-to-morrow
she would taste Freedom again, and her profoundest regret was
that after all her Aunt Julia was not to be married. Florence
had made definite plans for the wedding, especially for the principal
figure at the ceremony. This figure, as Florence saw things, would
have been that of the "Flower Girl," naturally a niece of the
bride; but she was able to dismiss the bright dream with some
philosophy. And to console her for everything, had she not a star
in her soul? Had she not discovered that she could write poetry
whenever she felt like it?</p>

<p>Noble passed from her sight, but nevertheless continued his radiant
progress down Julia's Street. Life stretched before him, serene,
ineffably fragrant, unending. He saw it as a flower-strewn sequence
of calls upon Julia, walks with Julia, talks with Julia by the
library fire. Old Mr. Atwater was to be away four days longer,
and Julia, that great-hearted bride-not-to-be, had given him her
promise.</p>

<p>Blushing, indeed divinely, she had promised him upon her sacred
word, never so long as she lived, to be engaged to anybody at
all.</p>
