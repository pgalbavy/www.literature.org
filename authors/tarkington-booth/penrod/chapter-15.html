<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Penrod entered the schoolroom, Monday picturesquely leaning upon
a man's cane shortened to support a cripple approaching the age
of twelve. He arrived about twenty minutes late, limping deeply,
his brave young mouth drawn with pain, and the sensation he created
must have been a solace to him; the only possible criticism of
this entrance being that it was just a shade too heroic. Perhaps
for that reason it failed to stagger Miss Spence, a woman so saturated
with suspicion that she penalized Penrod for tardiness as promptly
and as coldly as if he had been a mere, ordinary, unmutilated
boy. Nor would she entertain any discussion of the justice of
her ruling. It seemed, almost, that she feared to argue with him.</p>

<p>However, the distinction of cane and limp remained to him, consolations
which he protracted far into the week&mdash;until Thursday evening,
in fact, when Mr. Schofield, observing from a window his son's
pursuit of Duke round and round the backyard, confiscated the
cane, with the promise that it should not remain idle if he saw
Penrod limping again. Thus, succeeding a depressing Friday, another
Saturday brought the necessity for new inventions.</p>

<p>It was a scented morning in apple-blossom time. At about ten
of the clock Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door. His
pockets bulged abnormally; so did his checks, and he swallowed
with difficulty. A threatening mop, wielded by a cooklike arm
in a checkered sleeve, followed him through the doorway, and he
was preceded by a small, hurried, wistful dog with a warm doughnut
in his mouth. The kitchen door slammed petulantly, enclosing the
sore voice of Della, whereupon Penrod and Duke seated themselves
upon the pleasant sward and immediately consumed the spoils of
their raid.</p>

<p>From the cross-street which formed the side boundary of the Schofields'
ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced clatter of
a pair of trotting horses, and Penrod, looking up, beheld the
passing of a fat acquaintance, torpid amid the conservative splendours
of a rather old-fashioned victoria. This was Roderick Magsworth
Bitts, Junior, a fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing
Class, but otherwise not often a companion: a home-sheltered lad,
tutored privately and preserved against the coarsening influences
of rude comradeship and miscellaneous information. Heavily overgrown
in all physical dimensions, virtuous, and placid, this cloistered
mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod Schofield. Nevertheless,
Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, was a personage on account of
the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family; and it was Penrod's
destiny to increase Roderick's celebrity far, far beyond its present
aristocratic limitations.</p>

<p>The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive;
there was no other reason. And they were impressive because they
believed themselves important. The adults of the family were impregnably
formal; they dressed with reticent elegance, and wore the same
nose and the same expression&mdash;an expression which indicated that
they knew something exquisite and sacred which other people could
never know. Other people, in their presence, were apt to feel
mysteriously ignoble and to become secretly uneasy about ancestors,
gloves, and pronunciation. The Magsworth Bitts manner was withholding
and reserved, though sometimes gracious, granting small smiles
as great favours and giving off a chilling kind of preciousness.
Naturally, when any citizen of the community did anything unconventional
or improper, or made a mistake, or had a relative who went wrong,
that citizen's first and worst fear was that the Magsworth Bittses
would hear of it. In fact, this painful family had for years terrorized
the community, though the community had never realized that it
was terrorized, and invariably spoke of the family as the "most
charming circle in town." By common consent, Mrs. Roderick Magsworth
Bitts officiated as the supreme model as well as critic-in-chief
of morals and deportment for all the unlucky people prosperous
enough to be elevated to her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Magsworth was the important part of the name. Mrs. Roderick Magsworth
Bitts was a Magsworth born, herself, and the Magsworth crest decorated
not only Mrs. Magsworth Bitts' note-paper but was on the china,
on the table linen, on the chimney-pieces, on the opaque glass
of the front door, on the victoria, and on the harness, though
omitted from the garden-hose and the lawn-mower.</p>

<p>Naturally, no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious
crest with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose
name had grown week by week into larger and larger type upon the
front pages of newspapers, owing to the gradually increasing public
and official belief that she had poisoned a family of eight. However,
the statement that no sensible person could have connected the
Magsworth Bitts family with the arsenical Rena takes no account
of Penrod Schofield.</p>

<p>Penrod never missed a murder, a hanging or an electrocution in
the newspapers; he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as
her jurymen did, though they sat in a court-room two hundred miles
away, and he had it in mind&mdash;so frank he was&mdash;to ask Roderick
Magsworth Bitts, Junior, if the murderess happened to be a relative.</p>

<p>The present encounter, being merely one of apathetic greeting,
did not afford the opportunity. Penrod took off his cap, and Roderick,
seated between his mother and one of his grown-up sisters, nodded
sluggishly, but neither Mrs. Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter
acknowledged the salutation of the boy in the yard. They disapproved
of him as a person of little consequence, and that little, bad.
Snubbed, Penrod thoughtfully restored his cap to his head. A boy
can be cut as effectually as a man, and this one was chilled to
a low temperature. He wondered if they despised him because they
had seen a last fragment of doughnut in his hand; then he thought
that perhaps it was Duke who had disgraced him. Duke was certainly
no fashionable looking dog.</p>

<p>The resilient spirits of youth, however, presently revived, and
discovering a spider upon one knee and a beetle simultaneously
upon the other, Penrod forgot Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts in
the course of some experiments infringing upon the domain of Doctor
Carrel. Penrod's efforts&mdash;with the aid of a pin&mdash;to effect a transference
of living organism were unsuccessful; but he convinced himself
forever that a spider cannot walk with a beetle's legs. Della
then enhanced zoological interest by depositing upon the back
porch a large rat-trap from the cellar, the prison of four live
rats awaiting execution.</p>

<p>Penrod at once took possession, retiring to the empty stable,
where he installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet
of broken window-glass&mdash;held down by a brickbat&mdash;over the top.
Thus the symptoms of their agitation, when the box was shaken
or hammered upon, could be studied at leisure. Altogether this
Saturday was starting splendidly.</p>

<p>After a time, the student's attention was withdrawn from his
specimens by a peculiar smell, which, being followed up by a system
of selective sniffing, proved to be an emanation leaking into
the stable from the alley. He opened the back door.</p>

<p>Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had
built on the rear line of his lot and rented to negroes; and the
fact that a negro family was now in process of "moving in" was
manifested by the presence of a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon,
the latter laden with the semblance of a stove and a few other
unpretentious household articles.</p>

<p>A very small darky boy stood near the mule. In his hand was a
rusty chain, and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod
perceived the source of the special smell he was tracing&mdash;a large
raccoon. Duke, who had shown not the slightest interest in the
rats, set up a frantic barking and simulated a ravening assault
upon the strange animal. It was only a bit of acting, however,
for Duke was an old dog, had suffered much, and desired no unnecessary
sorrow, wherefore he confined his demonstrations to alarums and
excursions, and presently sat down at a distance and expressed
himself by intermittent threatenings in a quavering falsetto.</p>

<p>"What's that 'coon's name?" asked Penrod, intending no discourtesy.</p>

<p>"Aim gommo mame," said the small darky.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Aim gommo mame."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>The small darky looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"Aim <em>GOMMO </em>mame, I hell you," he said impatiently.</p>

<p>Penrod conceived that insult was intended.</p>

<p>"What's the matter of you?" he demanded advancing. "You get fresh
with ME, and I'll&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hyuh, white boy!" A coloured youth of Penrod's own age appeared
in the doorway of the cottage. "You let 'at brothuh mine alone.
He ain' do nothin' to you."</p>

<p>"Well, why can't he answer?"</p>

<p>"He can't. He can't talk no better'n what he <em>WAS </em>talkin'.
He tongue-tie'."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Penrod, mollified. Then, obeying an impulse so universally
aroused in the human breast under like circumstances that it has
become a quip, he turned to the afflicted one.</p>

<p>"Talk some more," he begged eagerly.</p>

<p>"I hoe you ackoom aim gommo mame," was the prompt response, in
which a slight ostentation was manifest. Unmistakable tokens of
vanity had appeared upon the small, swart countenance.</p>

<p>"What's he mean?" asked Penrod, enchanted.</p>

<p>"He say he tole you 'at 'coon ain' got no name."</p>

<p>"What's <em>YOUR </em>name?"</p>

<p>"I'm name Herman."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" Penrod pointed to the tongue-tied boy.</p>

<p>"Verman."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Verman. Was three us boys in ow fam'ly. Ol'est one name Sherman.
'N'en come me; I'm Herman. 'N'en come him; he Verman. Sherman
dead. Verman, he de littles' one."</p>

<p>"You goin' to live here?"</p>

<p>"Umhuh. Done move in f'm way outen on a fahm."</p>

<p>He pointed to the north with his right hand, and Penrod's eyes
opened wide as they followed the gesture. Herman had no forefinger
on that hand.</p>

<p>"Look there!" exclaimed Penrod. "You haven't got any finger!"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> mum map," said Verman, with egregious pride.</p>

<p>"HE done 'at," interpreted Herman, chuckling. "Yessuh; done chop
'er spang off, long 'go. He's a playin' wif a ax an' I lay my
finguh on de do'-sill an' I say, 'Verman, chop 'er off!' So Verman
he chop 'er right spang off up to de roots! Yessuh."</p>

<p>"What <em>FOR</em>?"</p>

<p>"Jes' fo' nothin'."</p>

<p>"He hoe me hoo," remarked Verman.</p>

<p>"Yessuh, I tole him to," said Herman, "an' he chop 'er off, an'
ey ain't airy oth' one evuh grown on wheres de ole one use to
grow. Nosuh!"</p>

<p>"But what'd you tell him to do it for?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'. I 'es' said it 'at way&mdash;an' he jes' chop er off!"</p>

<p>Both brothers looked pleased and proud. Penrod's profound interest
was flatteringly visible, a tribute to their unusualness.</p>

<p>"Hem bow goy," suggested Verman eagerly.</p>

<p>"Aw ri'," said Herman. "Ow sistuh Queenie, she a growed-up woman;
she got a goituh."</p>

<p>"Got a what?"</p>

<p>"Goituh. Swellin' on her neck&mdash;grea' big swellin'. She heppin'
mammy move in now. You look in de front-room winduh wheres she
sweepin'; you kin see it on her."</p>

<p>Penrod looked in the window and was rewarded by a fine view of
Queenie's goitre. He had never before seen one, and only the lure
of further conversation on the part of Verman brought him from
the window.</p>

<p>"Verman say tell you 'bout pappy," explained Herman. "Mammy an'
Queenie move in town an' go git de house all fix up befo' pappy
git out."</p>

<p>"Out of where?"</p>

<p>"Jail. Pappy cut a man, an' de police done kep' him in jail evuh
sense Chris'mus-time; but dey goin' tuhn him loose ag'in nex'
week."</p>

<p>"What'd he cut the other man with?"</p>

<p>"Wif a pitchfawk."</p>

<p>Penrod began to feel that a lifetime spent with this fascinating
family were all too short. The brothers, glowing with amiability,
were as enraptured as he. For the first time in their lives they
moved in the rich glamour of sensationalism. Herman was prodigal
of gesture with his right hand; and Verman, chuckling with delight,
talked fluently, though somewhat consciously. They cheerfully
agreed to keep the raccoon&mdash;already beginning to be mentioned
as "our 'coon" by Penrod&mdash;in Mr. Schofield's empty stable, and,
when the animal had been chained to the wall near the box of rats
and supplied with a pan of fair water, they assented to their
new friend's suggestion (inspired by a fine sense of the artistic
harmonies) that the heretofore nameless pet be christened Sherman,
in honour of their deceased relative.</p>

<p>At this juncture was heard from the front yard the sound of that
yodelling which is the peculiar accomplishment of those whose
voices have not "changed." Penrod yodelled a response; and Mr.
Samuel Williams appeared, a large bundle under his arm.</p>

<p>"Yay, Penrod!" was his greeting, casual enough from without;
but, having entered, he stopped short and emitted a prodigious
whistle. "<em>YA-A-AY!"  </em>he then shouted. "Look at the 'coon!"</p>

<p>"I guess you better say, 'Look at the 'coon!'" Penrod returned
proudly. "They's a good deal more'n him to look at, too. Talk
some, Verman."  Verman complied.</p>

<p>Sam was warmly interested. "What'd you say his name was?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Verman."</p>

<p>"How d'you spell it?"</p>

<p>"V-e-r-m-a-n," replied Penrod, having previously received this
information from Herman.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Sam.</p>

<p>"Point to sumpthing, Herman," Penrod commanded, and Sam's excitement,
when Herman pointed was sufficient to the occasion.</p>

<p>Penrod, the discoverer, continued his exploitation of the manifold
wonders of the Sherman, Herman, and Verman collection. With the
air of a proprietor he escorted Sam into the alley for a good
look at Queenie (who seemed not to care for her increasing celebrity)
and proceeded to a dramatic climax&mdash;the recital of the episode
of the pitchfork and its consequences.</p>

<p>The cumulative effect was enormous, and could have but one possible
result. The normal boy is always at least one half Barnum.</p>

<p>"Let's get up a <em>SHOW</em>!"</p>

<p>Penrod and Sam both claimed to have said it first, a question
left unsettled in the ecstasies of hurried preparation. The bundle
under Sam's arm, brought with no definite purpose, proved to have
been an inspiration. It consisted of broad sheets of light yellow
wrapping-paper, discarded by Sam's mother in her spring house-cleaning.
There were half-filled cans and buckets of paint in the storeroom
adjoining the carriage-house, and presently the side wall of the
stable flamed information upon the passer-by from a great and
spreading poster.</p>

<p>"Publicity," primal requisite of all theatrical and amphitheatrical
enterprise thus provided, subsequent arrangements proceeded with
a fury of energy which transformed the empty hayloft. True, it
is impossible to say just what the hay-loft was transformed into,
but history warrantably clings to the statement that it was transformed.
Duke and Sherman were secured to the rear wall at a considerable
distance from each other, after an exhibition of reluctance on
the part of Duke, during which he displayed a nervous energy and
agility almost miraculous in so small and middle-aged a dog. Benches
were improvised for spectators; the rats were brought up; finally
the rafters, corn-crib, and hay-chute were ornamented with flags
and strips of bunting from Sam Williams' attic, Sam returning
from the excursion wearing an old silk hat, and accompanied (on
account of a rope) by a fine dachshund encountered on the highway.
In the matter of personal decoration paint was generously used:
an interpretation of the spiral, inclining to whites and greens,
becoming brilliantly effective upon the dark facial backgrounds
of Herman and Verman; while the countenances of Sam and Penrod
were each supplied with the black moustache and imperial, lacking
which, no professional showman can be esteemed conscientious.</p>

<p>It was regretfully decided, in council, that no attempt be made
to add Queenie to the list of exhibits, her brothers warmly declining
to act as ambassadors in that cause. They were certain Queenie
would not like the idea, they said, and Herman picturesquely described
her activity on occasions when she had been annoyed by too much
attention to her appearance. However, Penrod's disappointment
was alleviated by an inspiration which came to him in a moment
of pondering upon the dachshund, and the entire party went forth
to add an enriching line to the poster.</p>

<p>They found a group of seven, including two adults, already gathered
in the street to read and admire this work.</p>

<p>A heated argument took place between Sam and Penrod, the point
at issue being settled, finally, by the drawing of straws; whereupon
Penrod, with pardonable self-importance&mdash;in the presence of an
audience now increased to nine&mdash;slowly painted the words inspired
by the dachshund:</p>
