<P>
IT mattered little to me to what port the vessel was bound. Go
where I might, I knew that I was on my way to Mrs. Van Brandt.
She had need of me again; she had claimed me again. Where the
visionary hand of the child had pointed, thither I was destined
to go. Abroad or at home, it mattered nothing: when I next set my
foot on the land, I should be further directed on the journey
which lay before me. I believed this as firmly as I believed that
I had been guided, thus far, by the vision of the child.
<P>
For two nights I had not slept--my weariness overpowered me. I
descended to the cabin, and found an unoccupied corner in which I
could lie down to rest. When I awoke, it was night already, and
the vessel was at sea.
<P>
I went on deck to breathe the fresh air. Before long the
sensation of drowsiness returned; I slept again for hours
together. My friend, the physician, would no doubt have
attributed this prolonged need of repose to the exhausted
condition of my brain, previously excited by delusions which had
lasted uninterruptedly for many hours together. Let the cause be
what it might, during the greater part of the voyage I was awake
at intervals only. The rest of the time I lay like a weary
animal, lost in sleep.
<P>
When I stepped on shore at Rotterdam, my first proceeding was to
ask my way to the English Consulate. I had but a small sum of
money with me; and, for all I knew to the contrary, it might be
well, before I did anything else, to take the necessary measures
for replenishing my purse.
<P>
I had my traveling-bag with me. On the journey to Greenwater
Broad I had left it at the inn in the market-town, and the waiter
had placed it in the carriage when I started on my return to
London. The bag contained my checkbook, and certain letters which
assisted me in proving my identity to the consul. He kindly gave
me the necessary introduction to the correspondents at Rotterdam
of my bankers in London.
<P>
Having obtained my money, and having purchased certain
necessaries of which I stood in need, I walked slowly along the
street, knowing nothing of what my next proceeding was to be, and
waiting confidently for the event which was to guide me. I had
not walked a hundred yards before I noticed the name of "Van
Brandt" inscribed on the window-blinds of a house which appeared
to be devoted to mercantile purposes.
<P>
The street door stood open. A second door, on one side of the
passage, led into the office. I entered the room and inquired for
Mr. Van Brandt. A clerk who spoke English was sent for to
communicate with me. He told me there were three partners of that
name in the business, and inquired which of them I wished to see.
I remembered Van Brandt's Christian name, and mentioned it. No
such person as "Mr. Ernest Van Brandt" was known at the office.
<P>
"We are only the branch house of the firm of Van Brandt here,"
the clerk explained. "The head office is at Amsterdam. They may
know where Mr. Ernest Van Brandt is to be found, if you inquire
there."
<P>
It mattered nothing to me where I went, so long as I was on my
way to Mrs. Van Brandt. It was too late to travel that day; I
slept at a hotel. The night passed quietly and uneventfully. The
next morning I set forth by the public conveyance for Amsterdam.
<P>
Repeating my inquiries at the head office on my arrival, I was
referred to one of the partners in the firm. He spoke English
perfectly; and he received me with an appearance of interest
which I was at a loss to account for at first.
<P>
"Mr. Ernest Van Brandt is well known to me," he said. "May I ask
if you are a relative or friend of the English lady who has been
introduced here as his wife?"
<P>
I answered in the affirmative; adding, "I am here to give any
assistance to the lady of which she may stand in need."
<P>
The merchant's next words explained the appearance of interest
with which he had received me.
<P>
"You are most welcome," he said. "You relieve my partners and
myself of a great anxiety. I can only explain what I mean by
referring for a moment to the business affairs of my firm. We
have a fishing establishment in the ancient city of Enkhuizen, on
the shores of the Zuyder Zee. Mr. Ernest Van Brandt had a share
in it at one time, which he afterward sold. Of late years our
profits from this source have been diminishing; and we think of
giving up the fishery, unless our prospects in that quarter
improve after a further trial. In the meantime, having a vacant
situation in the counting-house at Enkhuizen, we thought of Mr.
Ernest Van Brandt, and offered him the opportunity of renewing
his connection with us, in the capacity of a clerk. He is related
to one of my partners; but I am bound in truth to tell you that
he is a very bad man. He has awarded us for our kindness to him
by embezzling our money; and he has taken to flight--in what
direction we have not yet discovered. The English lady and her
child are left deserted at Enkhuizen; and until you came here
to-day we were quite at a loss to know what to do with them. I
don't know whether you are already aware of it, sir; but the
lady's position is made doubly distressing by doubts which we
entertain of her being really Mr. Ernest Van Brandt's wife. To
our certain knowledge, he was privately married to another woman
some years since; and we have no evidence whatever that the first
wife is dead. If we can help you in any way to assist your
unfortunate country-woman, pray believe that our services are at
your disposal."
<P>
With what breathless interest I listened to these words it is
needless to say. Van Brandt had deserted her! Surely (as my poor
mother had once said) "she must turn to me now." The hopes that
had abandoned me filled my heart once more; the future which I
had so long feared to contemplate showed itself again bright with
the promise of coming happiness to my view. I thanked the good
merchant with a fervor that surprised him. "Only help me to find
my way to Enkhuizen," I said, "and I will answer for the rest."
<P>
"The journey will put you to some expense," the merchant replied.
"Pardon me if I ask the question bluntly. Have you money?"
<P>
"Plenty of money."
<P>
"Very good. The rest will be easy enough. I will place you under
the care of a countryman of yours, who has been employed in our
office for many years. The easiest way for you, as a stranger,
will be to go by sea; and the Englishman will show you where to
hire a boat."
<P>
In a few minutes more the clerk and I were on our way to the
harbor.
<P>
Difficulties which I had not anticipated occurred in finding the
boat and in engaging a crew. This done, it was next necessary to
purchase provisions for the voyage. Thanks to the experience of
my companion, and to the hearty good-will with which he exerted
it, my preparations were completed before night-fall. I was able
to set sail for my destination on the next day.
<P>
The boat had the double advantage, in navigating the Zuyder Zee,
of being large, and of drawing very little water; the captain's
cabin was at the stern; and the two or three men who formed his
crew were berthed forward, in the bows. The whole middle of the
boat, partitioned off on the one side and on the other from the
captain and the crew, was assigned to me for my cabin. Under
these circumstances, I had no reason to complain of want of
space; the vessel measuring between fifty and sixty tons. I had a
comfortable bed, a table, and chairs. The kitchen was well away
from me, in the forward part of the boat. At my own request, I
set forth on the voyage without servant or interpreter. I
preferred being alone. The Dutch captain had been employed, at a
former period of his life, in the mercantile navy of France; and
we could communicate, whenever it was necessary or desirable, in
the French language.
<P>
We left the spires of Amsterdam behind us, and sailed over the
smooth waters of the lake on our way to the Zuyder Zee.
<P>
The history of this remarkable sea is a romance in itself. In the
days when Rome was mistress of the world, it had no existence.
Where the waves now roll, vast tracts of forest surrounded a
great inland lake, with but one river to serve it as an outlet to
the sea. Swelled by a succession of tempests, the lake overflowed
its boundaries: its furious waters, destroying every obstacle in
their course, rested only when they reached the furthest limits
of the land.
<P>
The Northern Ocean beyond burst its way in through the gaps of
ruin; and from that time the Zuyder Zee existed as we know it
now. The years advanced, the generations of man succeeded each
other; and on the shores of the new ocean there rose great and
populous cities, rich in commerce, renowned in history. For
centuries their prosperity lasted, before the next in this mighty
series of changes ripened and revealed itself. Isolated from the
rest of the world, vain of themselves and their good fortune,
careless of the march of progress in the natio ns round them, the
inhabitants of the Zuyder Zee cities sunk into the fatal torpor
of a secluded people. The few members of the population who still
preserved the relics of their old energy emigrated, while the
mass left behind resignedly witnessed the diminution of their
commerce and the decay of their institutions. As the years
advanced to the nineteenth century, the population was reckoned
by hundreds where it had once been numbered by thousands. Trade
disappeared; whole streets were left desolate. Harbors, once
filled with shipping, were destroyed by the unresisted
accumulation of sand. In our own times the decay of these once
flourishing cities is so completely beyond remedy, that the next
great change in contemplation is the draining of the now
dangerous and useless tract of water, and the profitable
cultivation of the reclaimed land by generations that are still
to come. Such, briefly told, is the strange story of the Zuyder
Zee.
<P>
As we advanced on our voyage, and left the river, I noticed the
tawny hue of the sea, caused by sand-banks which color the
shallow water, and which make the navigation dangerous to
inexperienced seamen. We found our moorings for the night at the
fishing island of Marken--a low, lost, desolate-looking place, as
I saw it under the last gleams of the twilight. Here and there,
the gabled cottages, perched on hillocks, rose black against the
dim gray sky. Here and there, a human figure appeared at the
waterside, standing, fixed in contemplation of the strange boat.
And that was all I saw of the island of Marken.
<P>
Lying awake in the still night, alone on a strange sea, there
were moments when I found myself beginning to doubt the reality
of my own position.
<P>
Was it all a dream? My thoughts of suicide; my vision of the
mother and daughter; my journey back to the metropolis, led by
the apparition of the child; my voyage to Holland; my night
anchorage in the unknown sea--were these, so to speak, all pieces
of the same morbid mental puzzle, all delusions from which I
might wake at any moment, and find myself restored to my senses
again in the hotel at London? Bewildered by doubts which led me
further and further from any definite conclusion, I left my bed
and went on deck to change the scene. It was a still and cloudy
night. In the black void around me, the island was a blacker
shadow yet, and nothing more. The one sound that reached my ears
was the heavy breathing of the captain and his crew sleeping on
either side of me. I waited, looking round and round the circle
of darkness in which I stood. No new vision showed itself. When I
returned again to the cabin, and slumbered at last, no dreams
came to me. All that was mysterious, all that was marvelous, in
the later events of my life seemed to have been left behind me in
England. Once in Holland, my course had been influenced by
circumstances which were perfectly natural, by commonplace
discoveries which might have revealed themselves to any man in my
position. What did this mean? Had my gifts as a seer of visions
departed from me in the new land and among the strange people? Or
had my destiny led me to the place at which the troubles of my
mortal pilgrimage were to find their end? Who could say?
<P>
Early the next morning we set sail once more.
<P>
Our course was nearly northward. On one side of me was the tawny
sea, changing under certain conditions of the weather to a dull
pearl-gray. On the other side was the flat, winding coast,
composed alternately of yellow sand and bright-green
meadow-lands; diversified at intervals by towns and villages,
whose red-tiled roofs and quaint church-steeples rose gayly
against the clear blue sky. The captain suggested to me to visit
the famous towns of Edam and. Hoorn; but I declined to go on
shore. My one desire was to reach the ancient city in which Mrs.
Van Brandt had been left deserted. As we altered our course, to
make for the promontory on which Enkhuizen is situated, the wind
fell, then shifted to another quarter, and blew with a force
which greatly increased the difficulties of navigation. I still
insisted, as long as it was possible to do so, on holding on our
course. After sunset, the strength of the wind abated. The night
came without a cloud, and the starry firmament gave us its pale
and glittering light. In an hour more the capricious wind shifted
back again in our favor. Toward ten o'clock we sailed into the
desolate harbor of Enkhuizen.
<P>
The captain and crew, fatigued by their exertions, ate their
frugal suppers and went to their beds. In a few minutes more, I
was the only person left awake in the boat.
<P>
I ascended to the deck, and looked about me.
<P>
Our boat was moored to a deserted quay. Excepting a few fishing
vessels visible near us, the harbor of this once prosperous place
was a vast solitude of water, varied here and there by dreary
banks of sand. Looking inland, I saw the lonely buildings of the
Dead City--black, grim, and dreadful under the mysterious
starlight. Not a human creature, not even a stray animal, was to
be seen anywhere. The place might have been desolated by a
pestilence, so empty and so lifeless did it now appear. Little
more than a hundred years ago, the record of its population
reached sixty thousand. The inhabitants had dwindled to a tenth
of that number when I looked at Enkhuizen now!
<P>
I considered with myself what my next course of proceeding was to
be.
<P>
The chances were certainly against my discovering Mrs. Van Brandt
if I ventured alone and unguided into the city at night. On the
other hand, now that I had reached the place in which she and her
child were living, friendless and deserted, could I patiently
wait through the weary interval that must elapse before the
morning came and the town was astir? I knew my own
self-tormenting disposition too well to accept this latter
alternative. Whatever came of it, I determined to walk through
Enkhuizen on the bare chance of meeting some one who might inform
me of Mrs. Van Brandt's address.
<P>
First taking the precaution of locking my cabin door, I stepped
from the bulwark of the vessel to the lonely quay, and set forth
upon my night wanderings through the Dead City.
