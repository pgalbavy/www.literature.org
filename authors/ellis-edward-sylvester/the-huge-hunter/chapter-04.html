<p>'<em>HELLO, YOUNKER! </em>what in thunder yer tryin' to make?'</p>

<p>Johnny Brainerd paused and looked up, not a little startled by
the strange voice and the rather singular figure which stood before
him. It was a hunter in half civilized costume, his pants tucked
into his immense boot tops, with revolvers and rifles at his waist,
and a general negligent air, which showed that he was at home
in whatever part of the world he chose to wander.</p>

<p>He stood with his hand in his pocket, chewing his quid, and complacently
viewing the operations of the boy, who was not a little surprised
to understand how he obtained entrance into his shop.</p>

<p>'Stopped at the house to ax whar old Washoe Pete keeps his hotel,'
replied the stranger, rightly surmising the query which was agitating
him, 'and I cotched a glimpse of yer old machine. Thought I'd
come in and see what in blazes it war. Looks to me like a man
that's gwine to run by steam.'</p>

<p>'That's just what it is,' replied the boy, seeing there was no
use in attempting to conceal the truth from the man.</p>

<p>'Will it do it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Don't think you mean to lie, younker, but I don't believe any
such stuff as that.'</p>

<p>'It don't make any difference to me whether you believe me or
not,' was the quiet reply of the boy; 'but if you will come inside
and shut the door, and let me fasten it, so that there will be
no danger of our being disturbed, I will soon show you.'</p>

<p>These two personages, so unlike in almost every respect, had
taken quite a fancy to each other. The strong, hardy, bronzed
trapper, powerful in all that goes to make up the physical man,
looked upon the pale, sweet-faced boy, with his misshapen body,
as an affectionate father would look upon an afflicted child.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the brusque, outspoken manner of the hunter
pleased the appreciative mind of the boy, who saw much to admire,
both in his appearance and manner.</p>

<p>'I don't s'pose yer know me,' said the stranger, as he stepped
inside and allowed the boy to secure the door behind him.</p>

<p>'I never saw you before.'</p>

<p>'I am Baldy Bicknell, though I ginerally go by the name of 'Baldy.''</p>

<p>'That's rather an odd name.'</p>

<p>'Yas; that's the reason.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, the stranger removed his hat and displayed his clean-shaven
pate.</p>

<p>'Yer don't understand that, eh? That 'ere means I had my ha'r
lifted ten years ago. The Sioux war the skunks that done it. After
they took my top-knot off.  It had grow'd on ag'in and that's
why they call me Baldy.'</p>

<p>In the mean time the door had been closed, and all secured. The
hat of the steam man emptied its smoke and steam into a section
of stove-pipe, which led into the chimney, so that no suspicion
of anything unusual could disturb the passers-by in the street.</p>

<p>'You see it won't do to let him walk here, for when I tried it
first, he went straight through the side of the house; but you
can tell by the way in which he moves his legs, whether he is
able to walk or not.'</p>

<p>'That's the way we ginerally gits the p'ints of an animal,' returned
Baldy, with great complaisance, as he seated himself upon a bench
to watch the performance.</p>

<p>It required the boy but a short time to generate a sufficient
quantity of steam to set the legs going at a terrific rate, varying
the proceedings by letting some of the vapor through the whistle
which composed the steam man's nose.</p>

<p>Baldy Bicknell stood for some minutes with a surprise too great
to allow him to speak. Wonderful as was the mechanism, yet the
boy who had constructed it was still more worthy of wonder. When
the steam had given out, the hunter placed his big hand upon the
head of the little fellow, and said:</p>

<p>'You'se a mighty smart chap, that be you. Did anybody help you
make that?'</p>

<p>'No; I believe not.'</p>

<p>'What'll you take for it?'</p>

<p>'I never thought of selling it.'</p>

<p>'Wal, think of it now.'</p>

<p>'What do you want to do with it?</p>

<p>'Thar's three of us goin' out to hunt fur gold, and that's jist
the thing to keep the Injins back an' scart. I've been out thar
afore, and know what's the matter with the darned skunks. So,
tell me how much money will buy it.'</p>

<p>'I would rather not sell it, said Johnny, after a few minutes'
further thought.' It has taken me a great while to finish it,
and I would rather not part with it, for the present, at least.'</p>

<p>'But, skin me, younker, I want to buy it! I'll give you a thousand
dollars fur it, slap down.'</p>

<p>Although much less than the machine was really worth, yet it
was a large offer, and the boy hesitated for a moment. But it
was only for a moment, when he decidedly shook his head.</p>

<p>'I wish you wouldn't ask me, for I don't want to sell it, until
I have had it some time. Besides, it isn't finished yet.'</p>

<p>'It ain't,' exclaimed Baldy, in surprise. 'Why, it works, what
more do you want?'</p>

<p>'I've got to make a wagon to run behind it.'</p>

<p>'That's it, eh? I thought you war goin' to ride on its back.
How much will it draw?'</p>

<p>'As much as four horses, and as fast as they can run.'</p>

<p>The hunter was half wild with excitement. The boy's delight was
never equal to one-half of his.</p>

<p>'Skulp me ag'in, ef that don't beat all! It's jest the thing
for the West; we'll walk through the Injins in the tallest kind
of style, and skear 'em beautiful. How long afore you'll have
it done?'</p>

<p>'It will take a month longer, at least.'</p>

<p>Baldy stood a few minutes in thought.</p>

<p>'See here, younker, we're on our way to the 'diggin's,' and spect
to be thar all summer. Ef the red-skins git any ways troublesome,
I'm comin' back arter this y'ar covey. Ef yer don't want to sell
him, yer needn't. Ef I bought him, it ain't likely I'd run him
long afore I'd bust his b'iler, or blow my own head off.'</p>

<p>'Just what I thought when you were trying to persuade me to sell
it,' interrupted the boy.</p>

<p>'Then, if he got the cramp in any of his legs, I wouldn't know
how to tie it up ag'in, and thar we'd be.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to see you take such a sensible view of it,' smiled
Johnny.</p>

<p>'So, I'm goin' on West, as I said, with two fools besides myself,
and we're goin' to stay thar till yer get this old thing finished;
and then I'm comin' after you to take a ride out thar.'</p>

<p>'That would suit me very well,' replied the boy, his face lighting
up with more pleasure than he had shown. 'I would be very glad
to make a trip on the prairies.'</p>

<p>'Wal, look fur me in about six weeks.'</p>

<p>And with this parting, the hunter was let out the door, and disappeared,
while Johnny resumed his work.</p>

<p>That day saw the steam man completed, so far as it was possible.
He was painted up, and every improvement made that the extraordinarily
keen mind of the boy could suggest. When he stood one side, and
witnessed the noiseless but powerful workings of the enormous
legs, he could not see that anything more could be desired.</p>

<p>It now remained for him to complete the wagon, and he began at
once.</p>

<p>It would have been a much easier matter for him to have secured
an ordinary carriage or wagon, and alter it to suit himself; but
this was not in accordance with the genius of the boy. No contrivance
could really suit him unless he made it himself. He had his own
ideas, which no one else could work out to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that the vehicle was made very strong
and durable.</p>

<p>This was the first great requisite. In some respects it resembled
the ordinary express wagons, except that it was considerably smaller.</p>

<p>It had heavy springs, and a canvas covering, with sufficient,
as we have shown in another place, to cover the man also, when
necessary.</p>

<p>This was arranged to carry the wood, a reserve of water, and
the necessary tools to repair it, when any portion of the machinery
should become disarranged.</p>

<p>English coal could be carried to last for two days, and enough
wood to keep steam going for twenty-four hours. When the reserve
tank in the bottom of the wagon was also filled, the water would
last nearly as long.</p>

<p>When these contingencies were all provided against, the six weeks
mentioned by the hunter were gone, and Johnny Brainerd found himself
rather longing for his presence again. </p>
