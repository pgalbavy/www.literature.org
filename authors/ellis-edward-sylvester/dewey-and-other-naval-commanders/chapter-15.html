<p>David Porter&mdash;A Clever Feat&mdash;Numerous Captures by the <em>Essex</em>
&mdash;Her Remarkable Cruise in the Pacific &mdash;Her Final Capture.</p>

<p>David Porter was born in 1780 and died in 1842. He came from
a seafaring family, and, entering the navy at an early age, did
gallant service in the war with France and Tripoli. He was the
father of David Dixon Porter, who, on account of his brilliant
record in the war for the Union, was made vice-admiral in 1866
and admiral in 1870.</p>

<p>The elder Porter was appointed captain of the <em>Essex</em>
at the beginning of the War of 1812, and, leaving New York, started
on a cruise after the British 36-gun <em>Thetis</em>, which was
on her way to South America with a large amount of specie aboard.
She took several unimportant prizes, and, failing to meet the
<em>Thetis</em>, turned northward and on the night of July 10,
1812, sighted a fleet of merchantmen.</p>

<p>The night was cloudy and dark and Porter with a great deal of
cleverness pushed his way among the vessels without his identity
being suspected. He had drawn in his guns, hidden most of his
men and done all he could to give the <em>Essex</em> the appearance
of being an inoffensive merchantman. His object was to learn whether
the escort was too powerful to be attacked. He opened conversation
with the captain of one of the vessels, who, unsuspicious of his
identity, informed him that the fleet was carrying a thousand
soldiers from Barbados to Quebec, and that the convoying vessel
was the <em>Minerva</em>, a 32-gun frigate. In addition, several
of the merchantmen were heavily armed.</p>

<p>Captain Porter's next act was still more audacious. He glided
forward among the fleet and hailed the captain of a second vessel,
but the latter became suspicious, and was on the point of signalling
to the escort the appearance of a stranger among them, when Porter
thrust out the muzzles of twenty cannon and warned him that if
he failed to keep perfect silence and follow in his wake he would
blow him out of the water. The English captain obeyed, and Porter
extricated his prize with such astonishing skill that not a vessel
took the alarm. When a safe point was reached, Porter found that
his prize was a brig with about two hundred British soldiers on
board.</p>

<p>Having succeeded so well, Porter again returned to the fleet
for another capture. But by this time day was breaking and the
character of his vessel was discovered. It being useless to attempt
further disguise, he cleared for action and offered the <em>Minerva</em>
battle. The captain, however, deemed it his duty to remain with
his convoy, and continued his course to Quebec, while Porter headed
southward, afterward restoring his prize to its owners for a liberal
ransom.</p>

<p>Captain Porter had become so clever in disguising his vessel
as a merchantman that some days later he lured the British 16-gun
ship-sloop <em>Alert</em> to attack him. In the space of eight
minutes the <em>Alert</em> was so helplessly crippled that her
captain surrendered. The <em>Essex</em> did not suffer the slightest
injury and no men were killed on either vessel.</p>

<p>The <em>Essex</em> had now five hundred prisoners aboard, and
they formed an element of serious danger, for they began plotting
among themselves to capture the ship from the Americans and turn
her over to the enemy. Captain Porter was a severe disciplinarian,
and one of his practices was to have the alarm of fire sounded
at all hours of the day or night, that his crew might be taught
the successful way of fighting the ever-present danger. To make
such training perfect, he occasionally started a fire in the hatches.</p>

<p>The leader in the conspiracy to seize the ship fixed upon a night
to make the attempt, and his friends were on the alert to join
him the moment he gave the signal. In one of the hammocks was
sleeping a midshipmite only eleven years old, but, young as he
was, he was a hero. Pistol in hand, the plotter tiptoed up beside
the hammock to learn whether the boy was asleep. The little fellow
was never wider awake in his life; but he kept his eyes closed
and breathed regularly, so as to deceive the scoundrel, who slipped
away to lead his companions in their murderous uprising.</p>

<p>The instant the man disappeared the boy midshipman sprang out
of his hammock, crept to the cabin and told Captain Porter what
he had seen. That officer ran into the berth deck and loudly shouted
"<em>Fire</em>!" The finely disciplined crew promptly answered
the call, and going to the main hatch, were speedily armed and
received their orders from Captain Porter. The plotters were overawed
and the rebellion nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>Thus the <em>Essex</em> was saved by the wits of a boy only eleven
years old. The name of that boy was David Glasgow Farragut, and
he became the greatest naval officer of the American navy. Of
course I shall have more to tell you about him later on.</p>

<p>Determined to rid himself of the dangerous prisoners, Captain
Porter placed them on board the <em>Alert</em> and sent them to
Nova Scotia on parole. In a cruise of sixty days he made nine
captures, recaptured five privateers and merchantmen, and arrived
in the Delaware early in September.</p>

<p>He sailed again in the latter part of October with the smallest
frigate in the navy, but with a full complement of officers and
men. Among the former, it need hardly be said, was young Midshipman
Farragut. The first port at which he stopped was Port Praya, where
the Portuguese governor showed them much courtesy. In December
the <em>Essex</em> crossed the equator, and soon after overhauled
a British brig of war, which strained every effort to escape.
The two manoeuvred for position, but the <em>Essex</em> proved
her superiority, and, after a volley of musketry, which killed
one man, the <em>Nocton</em>, as she proved to be, hauled down
her flag. She carried only 10 guns and 31 men, but had $50,000
in specie on board. Captain Porter placed an officer and crew
in charge of the prize, with instructions to make the nearest
American port. While striving to do so he was captured by the
British frigate <em>Belvidera</em>.</p>

<p>Captain Porter's instructions were to meet the <em>Constitution</em>
and <em>Hornet</em>, which were cruising in that part of the world.
He made continued efforts to do so, and frequently got on their
track, but finally had to give it up. Then Captain Porter formed
the bold plan of doubling Cape Horn and entering the Pacific ocean.</p>

<p>This venture was more dangerous than would be supposed, for all
the South American countries on that side of the continent were
dominated by Great Britain, and in entering the vast expanse the
American knew he would meet plenty of enemies and not a solitary
friend. Like an army when it invades a country, however, he determined
to live off the enemy. He knew that scores of English vessels
were in the Pacific, and all Porter had to do was to capture them.
He had had sufficient experience at that sort of work to give
him confidence, and he liked the business.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was the most dangerous season of the year for
doubling the Horn, which is always attended with peril. The <em>Essex</em>
was caught in a tempest that lasted for three days, and was so
terrific that the stoutest hearted sailors quailed. The escape
of the gallant little ship could not have been narrower, and she
suffered great damage, but finally the dreaded extremity of South
America was weathered, and in the beginning of March, 1813, the
<em>Essex</em> sailed into the calmer water of the Pacific, where
no armed American vessel had ever before penetrated.</p>

<p>The first halt was made off the island of Mocha, where a hunting
party secured a number of hogs, which were salted down for future
use. Captain Porter wished to keep secret his presence in that
part of the world until after he had secured a number of prizes,
but the condition of his vessel compelled him to put into Valparaiso,
where he learned that Chili had begun her war of independence
against Spain.</p>

<p>A sail which was sighted displayed the Spanish colors, and, believing
her to be one of the vessels that had been preying upon American
commerce in the Pacific, Captain Porter hoisted the British flag.
The stranger approached and sent an armed boat to the <em>Essex</em>.
It was immediately sent back with orders for the Peruvian cruiser
to come under the lee of the <em>Essex</em>. This was done, and
she was compelled to strike. Upon the demand of Porter, her captain
gave a list of all the vessels, so far as he could remember, that
were cruising in the Pacific. Then the arms, ammunition and spars
of the captive were thrown overboard and she was allowed to go.</p>

<p>From that time forward the captures made by the <em>Essex</em>
were so numerous that the full story would be monotonous. The
swiftest and best of the captured cruisers were fitted out with
crews and added to the American vessel, until Captain Porter had
under his command seven ships, carrying 80 guns and 340 men, in
addition to nearly a hundred prisoners. Still more were added,
and the cruise of the <em>Essex</em> and her companions in that
part of the world became very much like a picnic.</p>

<p>A number of powerful British frigates were searching for the
<em>Essex</em>, which had wrought such prodigious mischief. Porter
sailed for the Marquesas Islands, reaching them in the latter
part of October. There he landed, built a fort and made the repairs
of which his vessel stood in sore need.</p>

<p>The work accomplished by Captain Porter was almost beyond computation.
He literally destroyed English commerce in the Pacific, for none
of the vessels not captured dared leave port, and the American
merchant ships were protected. The play being over, he craved
more serious business. He therefore set out to hunt up some of
the British cruisers that were trying to hunt him up.</p>

<p>In February, 1814, the <em>Essex</em> and the <em>Essex Junior</em>,
as one of the newly manned prizes had been christened, entered
Valparaiso, where they learned that the 36-gun frigate <em>Phoebe</em>
was in the neighborhood searching for them. Captain Porter gave
a reception to the officials of Valparaiso, and the next morning,
while half of the crew were ashore, the <em>Essex Junior</em>
signalled from the offing that two British frigates were in sight.
They came into port, the captain of the <em>Phoebe</em> exchanging,
compliments with Porter, they being old acquaintances; but, all
the same, each was distrustful of the other, and both maintained
what may be termed a position of armed neutrality.</p>

<p>For six weeks the two frigates blockaded Porter. Learning then
that other ships were expected, Porter determined to get to sea.
In the attempt, his vessel was completely disabled by a storm.
Despite the neutrality of the port, the two British frigates attacked
him, keeping beyond range of the <em>Essex's</em> short guns and
thus rendering her perfectly powerless to help herself. The <em>Essex</em>
was pounded at long range until 58 of her men were killed and
66 wounded, when, to save her officers and crew from annihilation,
she surrendered.</p>
