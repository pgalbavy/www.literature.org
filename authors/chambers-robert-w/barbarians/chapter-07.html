<p>She had seated herself on a stool by the hearth. Presently she
spread her apron with trembling fingers, took the glazed bowl
of soup upon her lap and began to eat, slowly, casting long, unquiet
glances at him from time to time where he still at table leaned
heavily, looking out into the rain.</p>

<p>When he caught her eye he smiled, summoning her with a nod of
his boyish head. She set aside her bowl obediently, and, rising,
brought him his crutches. And at the same moment somebody knocked
lightly on the outer door.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine had unpinned her coiffe. Now she pinned it on
over her <em>bonnet</em> before going to the door, glancing uneasily
around at him while she tied her tresses and settled the delicate
starched wings of her bonnet.</p>

<p>"That’s odd," he said, "that knocking," staring at the door.
"Perhaps it is the lost Englishman."</p>

<p>"God send them," she whispered, going to the door and opening
it.</p>

<p>It certainly seemed to be one of the lost Englishmen&mdash;a big,
square-shouldered, blond young fellow, tall and powerful, in the
leather dress of an aëronaut. His glass mask was lifted like the
visor of a tilting helmet, disclosing a red, weather-beaten face,
wet with rain. Strength, youth, rugged health was their first
impression of this leather-clad man from the clouds.</p>

<p>He stepped inside the house immediately, halted when he caught
sight of Wayland in his undress uniform, glanced involuntarily
at his crutches and bandaged leg, cast a quick, penetrating glance
right and left; then he spoke pleasantly in his hesitating, imperfect
French&mdash;so oddly imperfect that Wayland could not understand him
at all.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded in English.</p>

<p>The airman seemed astonished for an instant, then a quick smile
broke out on his ruddy features:</p>

<p>"I say, this <em>is</em> lucky! Fancy finding an Englishman here!&mdash;wherever
this place may be." He laughed. "Of course I know I’m ’somewhere
in France,’ as the censor has it, but I’m hanged if I know where!"</p>

<p>"Come in and shut the door," said Wayland, reassured. Marie-Josephine
closed the door. The aëronaut came forward, stood dripping a moment,
then took the chair to which Wayland pointed, seating himself
as though a trifle tired.</p>

<p>"Shot down," he explained, gaily. "An enemy submarine winged
us out yonder somewhere. I tramped over these bally moors for
hours before I found a sign of any path. A sheepwalk brought me
here."</p>

<p>"You are lucky. There is only one house on these moors&mdash;this!
Who are you?" asked Wayland.</p>

<p>"West&mdash;flight-lieutenant, 10th division, Cinque-Ports patrolling
squadron."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, man! What are you doing in Finistère?"</p>

<p>"<em>What!</em>"</p>

<p>"You are in Brittany, province of Finistère. Didn’t you know
it?"</p>

<p>The air-officer seemed astounded. Presently he said: "The dirty
weather foxed us. Then that fellow out yonder winged us. I was
glad enough to see a coast line."</p>

<p>"Did you fall?"</p>

<p>"No; we controlled our landing pretty well."</p>

<p>"Where did you land?"</p>

<p>There was a second’s hesitation; the airman looked at Wayland,
glanced at his crippled leg.</p>

<p>"Out there near some woods," he said. "My pilot’s there now trying
to patch up.... You are not French, are you?"</p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p>"Oh! <em>A&mdash;</em>volunteer, I presume."</p>

<p>"Foreign Legion&mdash;2d."</p>

<p>"I see. Back from the trenches with a leg."</p>

<p>"It’s nearly well. I’ll be back soon."</p>

<p>"Can you walk?" asked the airman so abruptly that Wayland, looking
at him, hesitated, he did not quite know why.</p>

<p>"Not very far," he replied, cautiously. "I can get to the window
with my crutches pretty well."</p>

<p>And the next moment he felt ashamed of his caution when the airman
laughed frankly.</p>

<p>"I need a guide to some petrol," he said. "Evidently you can’t
go with me."</p>

<p>"Haven’t you enough petrol to take you to Lorient?"</p>

<p>"How far is Lorient?"</p>

<p>Wayland told him.</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said the flight-lieutenant; "I’ll have to try
to get somewhere. I suppose it is useless for me to ask," he added,
"but have you, by any chance, a bit of canvas&mdash;an old sail or
hammock? &mdash;I don’t need much. That’s what I came for&mdash;and
some shellac and wire, and a screwdriver of sorts? We need patching
as well as petrol; and we’re a little short of supplies."</p>

<p>Wayland’s steady gaze never left him, but his smile was friendly.</p>

<p>"We’re in a tearing hurry, too," added the flight-lieutenant,
looking out of the window.</p>

<p>Wayland smiled. "Of course there’s no petrol here. There’s nothing
here. I don’t suppose you could have landed in a more deserted
region if you had tried. There’s a château in the Laïs woods,
but it’s closed; owner and servants are at the war and the family
in Paris."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "Everybody has cleared out; the war
has stripped the country; and there never were any people on these
moors, excepting shooting parties and, in the summer, a stray
artist or two from Quimperlé."</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at him. "You say there is nobody here&mdash;between
here and Lorient? No&mdash;troops?"</p>

<p>"There’s nothing to guard. The coast is one vast shoal. Ships
pass hull down. Once a day a coast guard patrols along the cliffs&#11834;"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"He has passed, unfortunately. Otherwise he might signal by relay
to Lorient and have them send you out some petrol. By the way&mdash;are
you hungry?"</p>

<p>The flight-lieutenant showed all his firm, white teeth under
a yellow mustache, which curled somewhat upward. He laughed in
a carefree way, as though something had suddenly eased his mind
of perplexity&mdash;perhaps the certainty that there was no possible
chance for petrol. Certainty is said to be more endurable than
suspense.</p>

<p>"I’ll stop for a bite&mdash;if you don’t mind&mdash;while my pilot tinkers
out yonder," he said. "We’re not in such a bad way. It might easily
have been worse. Do you think you could find us a bit of sail,
or something, to use for patching?"</p>

<p>Wayland indicated an old high-backed chair of oak, quaintly embellished
with ancient leather in faded blue and gold. It had been a royal
chair in its day, or the Fleur-de-Lys lied.</p>

<p>The flight-lieutenant seated himself with a rather stiff bow.</p>

<p>"If you need canvas" &mdash;Wayland hesitated&mdash;then, gravely:
"There are, in my room, a number of artists’ <em>toiles</em>&mdash;old
chassis with the blank canvas still untouched."</p>

<p>"Exactly what we need!" exclaimed the other. "What luck, now,
to meet a painter in such a place as this!"</p>

<p>"They belonged to my father," explained Wayland. "We &mdash;Marie-Josephine
and <em>I&mdash;</em>have always kept my father’s old canvases and
colours&mdash;everything of his.... I’ll be glad to give them to a
British soldier.... They’re about all I have that was his&mdash;except
that oak chair you sit on."</p>

<p>He rose on his crutches, spoke briefly in Breton to Marie-Josephine,
then limped slowly away to his room.</p>

<p>When he returned with half a dozen blank canvases the flight-lieutenant,
at table, was eating pork and black bread and drinking Breton
cider.</p>

<p>Wayland seated himself, laid both crutches across his knees,
picked up one of the chassis, and began to rip from it the dusty
canvas. It was like tearing muscles from his own bones. But he
smiled and chatted on, casually, with the air-officer, who ate
as though half starved.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Wayland, "you’ll start back across the Channel
as soon as you secure petrol enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"You could go by way of Quimper or by Lorient. There’s petrol
to be had at both places for military purposes"&mdash;leisurely continuing
to rip the big squares of canvas from the frames.</p>

<p>The airman, still eating, watched him askance at intervals.</p>

<p>"I’ve brought what’s left of the shellac; it isn’t much use,
I fear. But here is his hammer and canvas stretcher, and the remainder
of the nails he used for stretching his canvases," said Wayland,
with an effort to speak carelessly.</p>

<p>"Many thanks. You also are a painter, I take it."</p>

<p>Wayland laid one hand on the sleeve of his uniform and laughed.</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> a writer. But there are only soldiers in the
world now."</p>

<p>"Quite so ... This is an odd place for an American to live in."</p>

<p>"My father bought it years ago. He was a painter of peasant life."
He added, lowering his voice, although Marie-Josephine understood
no English: "This old peasant woman was his model many years ago.
She also kept house for him. He lived here; I was born here."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but my father desired that I grow up a good Yankee. I was
at school in America when he&mdash;died."</p>

<p>The airman continued to eat very busily.</p>

<p>"He died&mdash;out there" &mdash;Wayland looked through the window,
musingly. "There was an Iceland schooner wrecked off the Isle
des Chouans. And no life-saving crew short of Ylva Light. So my
father went out in his little American catboat, all alone....
Marie-Josephine saw his sail off Eryx Rocks ... for a few moments
... and saw it no more."</p>

<p>The airman, still devouring his bread and meat, nodded in silence.</p>

<p>"That is how it happened," said Wayland. "The French authorities
notified me. There was a little money and this hut, and &mdash;Marie-Josephine.
So I came here; and I write children’s stories&mdash;that sort of thing....
It goes well enough. I sell a few to American publishers. Otherwise
I shoot and fish and read ... when war does not preoccupy me...."</p>

<p>He smiled, experiencing the vague relief of talking to somebody
in his native tongue. Quesnel Moors were sometimes very lonely.</p>

<p>"It’s been a long convalescence," he continued, smilingly. "One
of their ’coal-boxes’ did this"&mdash;touching his leg. "When I was
able to move I went to America. But the sea off the Eryx called
me back; and the authorities permitted me to come down here. I’m
getting well very fast now."</p>

<p>He had stripped every chassis of its canvas, and had made a roll
of the material.</p>

<p>"I’m very glad to be of any use to you," he said pleasantly,
laying the roll on the table.</p>

<p>Marie-Josephine, on her low chair by the hearth, sat listening
to every word as though she had understood. The expression in
her faded eyes varied constantly; solicitude, perplexity, vague
uneasiness, a recurrent glimmer of suspicion were succeeded always
by wistful tenderness when her gaze returned to Wayland and rested
on his youthful face and figure with a pride forever new.</p>

<p>Once she spoke in mixed French and Breton:</p>

<p>"Is the stranger English, Monsieur Jacques, <em>mon chéri</em>?"</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, Marie-Josephine. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Why dost thou believe him to be English?"</p>

<p>"He has the tricks of speech. Also his accent is of an English
university. There is no mistaking it."</p>

<p>"Are not young Huns sometimes instructed in the universities
of England?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Gar à nous, mon p’tit</em>, Jacques. In Finistère a stranger
is a suspect. Since earliest times they have done us harm in Finistère.
The strangers &mdash;God knows what centuries of evil they have
wrought."</p>

<p>"No fear," he said, reassuringly, and turned again to the airman,
who had now satisfied his hunger and had already risen to gather
up the roll of canvas, the hammer, nails, and shellac.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, old chap!" he said cordially. "I’ll take these
articles, if I may. It’s very good of you ... I’m in a tearing
hurry&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Won’t your pilot come over and eat a bit?"</p>

<p>"I’ll take him this bread and meat, if I may. Many thanks." He
held out his heavily gloved hand with a friendly smile, nodded
to Marie-Josephine. And as he hurriedly turned to go, the ancient
carving on the high-backed chair caught him between the buttons
of his leather coat, tearing it wide open over the breast. And
Wayland saw the ribbon of the Iron Cross there fastened to a sea-grey
tunic.</p>

<p>There was a second’s frightful silence.</p>

<p>"What’s that you wear?" said Wayland hoarsely. "Stop! Stand where
you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Halt! Don’t touch that shotgun!" cried the airman sharply. But
Wayland already had it in his hands, and the airman fired twice
at him where he stood&mdash;steadied the automatic to shoot again,
but held his fire, seeing it would not be necessary. Besides,
he did not care to shoot the old woman unless military precaution
made it advisable; and she was on her knees, her withered arms
upflung, shielding the prostrate body with her own.</p>

<p>"You Yankee fool," he snapped out harshly&mdash;"it is your own fault,
not mine!... Like the rest of your imbecile nation you poke your
nose where it has no business! And <em>I&mdash;" </em>He ceased speaking,
realizing that his words remained unheard.</p>

<p>After a moment he backed toward the door, carrying the canvas
roll under his left arm and keeping his eye carefully on the prostrate
man. Also, one can never trust the French!&mdash;he was quite ready
for that old woman there on the floor who was holding the dead
boy’s head to her breast, muttering: "My darling! My child!&mdash;Oh,
little son of Marie-Josephine!&mdash;I told thee &mdash;I warned thee
of the stranger in Finistère!... Marie&mdash;holy&mdash;intercede!... All&mdash;all
are born to grief in Finistère!..."</p>
