<P>On Malicorne's arrival at Orleans, he was informed that the
Comte de Guiche had just set out for Paris. Malicorne rested
himself for a couple of hours, and then prepared to continue
his journey. He reached Paris during the night, and alighted
at a small hotel, where, in his previous journeys to the
capital, he had been accustomed to put up, and at eight
o'clock the next morning presented himself at the Hotel
Grammont. Malicorne arrived just in time, for the Comte de
Guiche was on the point of taking leave of Monsieur before
setting out for Havre, where the principal members of the
French nobility had gone to await Madame's arrival from
England. Malicorne pronounced the name of Manicamp and was
immediately admitted. He found the Comte de Guiche in the
courtyard of the Hotel Grammont, inspecting his horses,
which his trainers and equerries were passing in review
before him. The count, in the presence of his tradespeople
and of his servants, was engaged in praising or blaming, as
the case seemed to deserve, the appointments, horses, and
harness that were being submitted to him; when, in the midst
of this important occupation, the name of Manicamp was
announced.</P>
<P>&quot;Manicamp!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;let him enter by all means.&quot; And
he advanced a few steps toward the door.</P>
<P>Malicorne slipped through the half-open door, and looking at
the Comte de Guiche, who was surprised to see a face he did
not recognize, instead of the one he expected, said:
&quot;Forgive me, monsieur le comte, but I believe a mistake has
been made. M. Manicamp himself was announced to you, instead
of which it is only an envoy from him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed De Guiche, coldly, &quot;and what do you bring
me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A letter, monsieur le comte.&quot; Malicorne handed him the
first document, and narrowly watched the count's face, who,
as he read it began to laugh.</P>
<P>&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;another maid of honor? Are all the
maids of honor in France, then, under his protection?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne bowed. &quot;Why does he not come himself?&quot; he
inquired.</P>
<P>&quot;He is confined to his bed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The deuce! he has no money then, I suppose,&quot; said De
Guiche, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;What does he do with his
money?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne made a movement, to indicate that upon this
subject he was as ignorant as the count himself. &quot;Why does
he not make use of his credit, then?&quot; continued De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;With regard to that, I think  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That Manicamp has credit with no one but yourself, monsieur
le comte!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He will not be at Havre, then?&quot; Whereupon Malicorne made
another movement.</P>
<P>&quot;But every one will be there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I trust, monsieur le comte, that he will not neglect so
excellent an opportunity.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He should be at Paris by this time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He will take the direct road perhaps to make up for lost
time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At Orleans.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said De Guiche, &quot;you seem to me a man of very
good taste.&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne was wearing some of Manicamp's old-new clothes. He
bowed in return, saying, &quot;You do me a very great honor,
monsieur le comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My name is Malicorne, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. de Malicorne, what do you think of these
pistol-holsters?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne was a man of great readiness, and immediately
understood the position of affairs. Besides, the &quot;de&quot; which
had been prefixed to his name, raised him to the rank of the
person with whom he was conversing. He looked at the
holsters with the air of a connoisseur and said, without
hesitation: &quot;Somewhat heavy, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; said De Guiche to the saddler, &quot;this gentleman,
who understands these matters well, thinks the holsters
heavy, a complaint I had already made.&quot; The saddler was full
of excuses.</P>
<P>&quot;What do you think,&quot; asked De Guiche, &quot;of this horse, which
I have just purchased?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To look at it, it seems perfect, monsieur le comte; but I
must mount it before I give you my opinion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do so, M. de Malicorne, and ride him round the court two or
three times.&quot;</P>
<P>The courtyard of the hotel was so arranged, that whenever
there was any occasion for it, it could be used as a
riding-school. Malicorne, with perfect ease, arranged the
bridle and snaffle-reins, placed his left hand on the
horse's mane, and, with his foot in the stirrup, raised
himself and seated himself in the saddle. At first, he made
the horse walk the whole circuit of the court-yard at a
foot-pace; next at a trot; lastly at a gallop. He then drew
up close to the count, dismounted, and threw the bridle to a
groom standing by. &quot;Well,&quot; said the count, &quot;what do you
think of it, M. de Malicorne?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This horse, monsieur le comte, is of the Mecklenburg breed.
In looking whether the bit suited his mouth, I saw that he
was rising seven, the very age when the training of a horse
intended for a charger should commence. The forehand is
light. A horse which holds its head high, it is said, never
tires his rider's hand. The withers are rather low. The
drooping of the hindquarters would almost make me doubt the
purity of its German breed, and I think there is English
blood in him. He stands well on his legs, but he trots high,
and may cut himself, which requires attention to be paid to
his shoeing. He is tractable; and as I made him turn round
and change his feet, I found him quick and ready in doing
so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well said, M. de Malicorne,&quot; exclaimed the comte; &quot;you are
a judge of horses, I perceive;&quot; then, turning towards him
again, he continued, &quot;You are most becomingly dressed, M. de
Malicorne. That is not a provincial cut, I presume. Such a
style of dress is not to be met with at Tours or Orleans.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur le comte; my clothes were made at Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no doubt about that. But let us resume our own
affair. Manicamp wishes for the appointment of a second maid
of honor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You perceive what he has written, monsieur le comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For whom was the first appointment?&quot;</P>
<P>Malicorne felt the color rise in his face as he answered
hurriedly.</P>
<P>&quot;A charming maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, ah! you are acquainted with her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are affianced, or nearly so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is quite another thing, then; a thousand compliments,&quot;
exclaimed De Guiche, upon whose lips a courtier's jest was
already fitting, but to whom the word &quot;affianced,&quot; addressed
by Malicorne with respect to Mademoiselle de Montalais,
recalled the respect due to women.</P>
<P>&quot;And for whom is the second appointment destined?&quot; asked De
Guiche, &quot;is it for anyone to whom Manicamp may happen to be
affianced? In that case I pity her, poor girl! for she will
have a sad fellow for a husband.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur le comte, the second appointment is for
Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Unknown,&quot; said De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Unknown? yes, monsieur,&quot; said Malicorne, smiling in his
turn.</P>
<P>&quot;Very good. I will speak to Monsieur about it. By the by,
she is of gentle birth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She belongs to a very good family and is maid of honor to
Madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's well. Will you accompany me to Monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Most certainly, if I may be permitted the honor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you your carriage?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No; I came here on horseback.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Dressed as you are?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur; I posted from Orleans, and I changed my
traveling suit for the one I have on, in order to present
myself to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;True, you already told me you had come from Orleans;&quot;
saying which he crumpled Manicamp's letter in his hand, and
thrust it in his pocket.</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Malicorne, timidly; &quot;but I do not
think you have read all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not read all, do you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, there were two letters in the same envelope.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! are you sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quite sure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us look, then,&quot; said the count, as he opened the letter
again.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! you are right,&quot; he said, opening the paper which he had
not yet read.</P>
<P>&quot;I suspected it,&quot; he continued  -  &quot;another application for
an appointment under Monsieur. This Manicamp is a regular
vampire:  -  he is carrying on a trade in it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, monsieur le comte, he wishes to make a present of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To whom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To myself, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why did you not say so at once, my dear M. Mauvaisecorne?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Malicorne, monsieur le comte.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me; it is the Latin that bothers me  -  that
terrible mine of etymologies. Why the deuce are young men of
family taught Latin? Mala and mauvaise  -  you understand it
is the same thing. You will forgive me, I trust, M. de
Malicorne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your kindness affects me much, monsieur: but it is a reason
why I should make you acquainted with one circumstance
without any delay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That I was not born a gentleman. I am not without courage,
and not altogether deficient in ability; but my name is
Malicorne simply.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You appear to me, monsieur!&quot; exclaimed the count, looking
at the astute face of his companion, &quot;to be a most agreeable
man. Your face pleases me, M. Malicorne, and you must
possess some indisputably excellent qualities to have
pleased that egotistical Manicamp. Be candid, and tell me
whether you are not some saint descended upon the earth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For the simple reason that he makes you a present of
anything. Did you not say that he intended to make you a
present of some appointment in the king's house</P>
<P>&quot;I beg your pardon, count; but, if I succeed in obtaining
the appointment, you, and not he, will have bestowed it on
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Besides, he will not have given it to you for nothing, I
suppose. Stay, I have it;  -  there is a Malicorne at
Orleans, who lends money to the prince.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think that must be my father, monsieur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! the prince has the father, and that terrible dragon of
a Manicamp has the son. Take care, monsieur, I know him. He
will fleece you completely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The only difference is, that I lend without interest,&quot; said
Malicorne, smiling.</P>
<P>&quot;I was correct in saying you were either a saint or very
much resembled one. M. Malicorne, you shall have the post
you want, or I will forfeit my name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! monsieur le comte, what a debt of gratitude shall I not
owe you?&quot; said Malicorne, transported.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go to the prince, my dear M. Malicorne.&quot; And De
Guiche proceeded toward the door, desiring Malicorne to
follow him. At the very moment they were about to cross the
threshold, a young man appeared on the other side. He was
from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, of pale
complexion, bright eyes and brown hair and eyebrows.</P>
<P>&quot;Good-day,&quot; he said, suddenly, almost pushing De Guiche back
into the courtyard again.</P>
<P>&quot;Is that you, De Wardes?  -  What! and booted, spurred, and
whip in hand, too?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The most befitting costume for a man about to set off for
Havre. There will be no one left in Paris tomorrow.&quot; And
hereupon he saluted Malicorne with great ceremony, whose
handsome dress gave him the appearance of a prince.</P>
<P>&quot;M. Malicorne,&quot; said De Guiche to his friend. De Wardes
bowed.</P>
<P>&quot;M. de Wardes,&quot; said Guiche to Malicorne, who bowed in
return. &quot;By the by, De Wardes,&quot; continued De Guiche, &quot;you
who are so well acquainted with these matters, can you tell
us, probably, what appointments are still vacant at the
court; or rather in the prince's household?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the prince's household,&quot; said De Wardes, looking up with
an air of consideration, &quot;let me see  -  the appointment of
the master of the horse is vacant, I believe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Malicorne, &quot;there is no question of such a post
as that, monsieur; my ambition is not nearly so exalted.&quot;</P>
<P>De Wardes had a more penetrating observation than De Guiche,
and fathomed Malicorne immediately. &quot;The fact is,&quot; he said,
looking at him from head to foot, &quot;a man must be either a
duke or a peer to fill that post.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All I solicit,&quot; said Malicorne, &quot;is a very humble
appointment; I am of little importance, and I do not rank
myself above my position.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;M. Malicorne, whom you see here,&quot; said De Guiche to De
Wardes, &quot;is a very excellent fellow, whose only misfortune
is that of not being of gentle birth. As far as I am
concerned, you know, I attach little value to those who have
but gentle birth to boast of.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Assuredly,&quot; said De Wardes; &quot;but will you allow me to
remark, my dear count, that, without rank of some sort, one
can hardly hope to belong to his royal highness's
household?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right,&quot; said the count, &quot;court etiquette is
absolute. The devil!  -  we never so much as gave it a
thought.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas! a sad misfortune for me, monsieur le comte,&quot; said
Malicorne, changing color.</P>
<P>&quot;Yet not without remedy, I hope,&quot; returned De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;The remedy is found easily enough,&quot; exclaimed De Wardes;
&quot;you can be created a gentleman. His Eminence, the Cardinal
Mazarin, did nothing else from morning till night&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush, hush, De Wardes,&quot; said the count; &quot;no jests of that
kind; it ill becomes us to turn such matters into ridicule.
Letters of nobility, it is true, are purchasable; but that
is a sufficient misfortune without the nobles themselves
laughing at it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon my word, De Guiche, you're quite a Puritan, as the
English say.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment the Vicomte de Bragelonne was announced by
one of the servants in the courtyard, in precisely the same
manner as he would have done in a room.</P>
<P>&quot;Come here, my dear Raoul. What! you, too, booted and
spurred? You are setting off, then?&quot;</P>
<P>Bragelonne approached the group of young men, and saluted
them with that quiet and serious manner peculiar to him. His
salutation was principally addressed to De Wardes, with whom
he was unacquainted, and whose features, on his perceiving
Raoul, had assumed a strange sternness of expression. &quot;I
have come, De Guiche,&quot; he said, &quot;to ask your companionship.
We set off for Havre, I presume.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is admirable  -  delightful. We shall have a most
enjoyable journey. M. Malicorne, M. Bragelonne  -  ah! M. de
Wardes, let me present you.&quot; The young men saluted each
other in a restrained manner. Their very natures seemed,
from the beginning, disposed to take exception to each
other. De Wardes was pliant, subtle, full of dissimulation;
Raoul was calm, grave, and upright. &quot;Decide between us  - 
between De Wardes and myself, Raoul.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon what subject?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Upon the subject of noble birth.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who can be better informed on that subject than a De
Grammont?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No compliments; it is your opinion I ask.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At least, inform me of the subject under discussion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;De Wardes asserts that the distribution of titles is
abused; I, on the contrary, maintain that a title is useless
to the man on whom it is bestowed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you are correct,&quot; said Bragelonne, quietly.</P>
<P>&quot;But, monsieur le vicomte,&quot; interrupted De Wardes, with a
kind of obstinacy, &quot;I affirm that it is I who am correct.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What was your opinion, monsieur?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was saying that everything is done in France at the
present moment to humiliate men of family.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And by whom?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By the king himself. He surrounds himself with people who
cannot show four quarterings.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said De Guiche, &quot;where could you possibly have
seen that, De Wardes?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One example will suffice,&quot; he returned, directing his look
fully upon Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;State it then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you know who has just been nominated captain-general of
the musketeers?  -  an appointment more valuable than a
peerage; for it gives precedence over all the marechals of
France.&quot;</P>
<P>Raoul's color mounted in his face; for he saw the object De
Wardes had in view. &quot;No; who has been appointed? In any case
it must have been very recently, for the appointment was
vacant eight days ago; a proof of which is, that the king
refused Monsieur, who solicited the post for one of his
proteges.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, the king refused it to Monsieur's protege, in order
to bestow it upon the Chevalier d'Artagnan, a younger
brother of some Gascon family, who has been trailing his
sword in the ante-chambers during the last thirty years.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Forgive me if I interrupt you,&quot; said Raoul, darting a
glance full of severity at De Wardes; &quot;but you give me the
impression of being unacquainted with the gentleman of whom
you are speaking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I not acquainted with M. d'Artagnan? Can you tell me,
monsieur, who does not know him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Those who do know him, monsieur,&quot; replied Raoul with still
greater calmness and sternness of manner, &quot;are in the habit
of saying, that if he is not as good a gentleman as the king
 -  which is not his fault  -  he is the equal of all the
kings of the earth in courage and loyalty. Such is my
opinion, monsieur, and I thank heaven I have known M.
d'Artagnan from my birth.&quot;</P>
<P>De Wardes was about to reply, when De Guiche interrupted
him.</P></article>
