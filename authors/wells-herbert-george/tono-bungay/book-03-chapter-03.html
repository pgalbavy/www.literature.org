I                             
<P>
For nearly all the time that my uncle was incubating and hatching
Crest Hill I was busy in a little transverse valley between that
great beginning and Lady Grove with more and more costly and
ambitious experiments in aerial navigation.  This work was indeed
the main substance  of my life through all the great time of the
Tono-Bungay symphony.
<P>
I have told already how I came to devote myself to this system of
inquiries, how in a sort of disgust with the common adventure of
life I took up the dropped ends of my college studies, taking
them up again with a man's resolution instead of a boy's
ambition.  From the first I did well at this work.  It--was, I
think, largely a case of special aptitude, of a peculiar
irrelevant vein of faculty running through my mind.  It is one of
those things men seem to have by chance, that has little or
nothing to do with their general merit, and which it is
ridiculous to be either conceited or modest about.  I did get
through a very big mass of work in those years, working for a
time with a concentrated fierceness that left little of such
energy or capacity as I possess unused.  I worked out a series
of problems connected with the stability of bodies pitching in
the air and the internal movements of the wind, and I also
revolutionised one leading part at last of the theory of
explosive engines.  These things are to be found in the
Philosophical Transactions, the Mathematical Journal, and
less frequently in one or two other such publications, and they
needn't detain us here.  Indeed, I doubt if I could write about
them here.  One acquires a sort of shorthand for one's notes and
mind in relation to such special work.  I have never taught; nor
lectured, that is to say, I have never had to express my thoughts
about mechanical things in ordinary everyday language, and I
doubt very much if I could do so now without extreme tedium.
<P>
My work was, to begin with, very largely theoretical.  I was able
to attack such early necessities of verification as arose with
quite little models, using a turntable to get the motion through
the air, and cane, whalebone and silk as building material.  But
a time came when incalculable factors crept in, factors of human
capacity and factors of insufficient experimental knowledge, when
one must needs guess and try.  Then I had to enlarge the scale of
my operations, and soon I had enlarged them very greatly.  I set
to work almost concurrently on the balance and stability of
gliders and upon the steering of inflated bags, the latter a
particularly expensive branch of work.  I was no doubt moved by
something of the same spirit of lavish expenditure that was
running  away with my uncle in these developments.  Presently 
my establishment above Lady Grove had grown to a painted wood
chalet big enough to accommodate six men, and in which I would
sometimes live for three weeks together; to a gasometer, to a
motor-house, to three big corrugated-roofed sheds and lock-up
houses, to a stage from which to start gliders, to a workshop and
so forth.  A rough road was made.  We brought up gas from
Cheaping and electricity from Woking, which place I found also
afforded a friendly workshop for larger operations than I could
manage.  I had the luck also to find a man who seemed my
heaven-sent second-in-command--Cothope his name was.  He was a
self-educated-man; he had formerly been a sapper and he was
one of the best and handiest working engineers alive.  Without
him I do not think I could have achieved half what I have done. 
At times he has been not so much my assistant as my collaborator,
and has followed my fortunes to this day.  Other men came and
went as I needed them.
<P>
I do not know how far it is possible to convey to any one who has
not experienced it, the peculiar interest, the peculiar
satisfaction that lies in a sustained research when one is not
hampered by want of money.  It is a different thing from any
other sort of human effort.  You are free from the exasperating
conflict with your fellow-creatures altogether--at least so far
as the essential work goes; that for me is its peculiar merit.
Scientific truth is the remotest of mistresses; she hides in
strange places, she is attained by tortuous and laborious  roads,
but SHE IS ALWAYS THERE!  Win to her and she will not fail you;
she is yours and mankind's for ever.  She is reality, the one
reality I have found in this strange disorder of existence.  She
will not sulk with you nor misunderstand you nor cheat you of
your reward upon some petty doubt.  You cannot change her by
advertisement or clamour, nor stifle her in vulgarities.  Things
grow under your hands when you serve her, things that are
permanent as nothing else is permanent in the whole life of man. 
That, I think, is the peculiar satisfaction of science and its
enduring reward....
<P>
The taking up of experimental work produced a great change in
my personal habits.  I have told how already once in my life at
Wimblehurst I had a period of discipline and continuous effort,
and how, when I came to South Kensington, I became demoralised by
the immense effect of London, by its innumerable imperative
demands upon my attention and curiosity.  And I parted with much
of my personal pride when I gave up science for the development
of Tono-Bungay.  But my poverty kept me abstinent and my youthful
romanticism kept me chaste until my married life was well under
way.  Then in all directions I relaxed.  I did a large amount of
work, but I never troubled to think whether it was my maximum nor
whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times were
avoidable things.  With the coming of plenty I ate abundantly and
foolishly, drank freely and followed my impulses more and more
carelessly.  I felt no reason why I should do anything else. 
Never at any point did I use myself to the edge of my capacity. 
The emotional crisis of my divorce did not produce any immediate
change in these matters of personal discipline.  I found some
difficulty at first in concentrating my mind upon scientific
work, it was so much more exacting than business, but I got over
that difficulty by smoking.  I became an inordinate cigar smoker;
it gave me moods of profound depression, but I treated these
usually by the homeopathic method,--by lighting another cigar.  I
didn't realise at all how loose my moral and nervous fibre had
become until I reached the practical side of my investigations
and was face to face with the necessity of finding out just how
it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one.
<P>
I got into this relaxed habit of living in spite of very real
tendencies in my nature towards discipline. I've never been in
love with self-indulgence.  That philosophy of the loose lip and
the lax paunch is one for which I've always had an instinctive
distrust.  I like bare things, stripped things, plain, austere
and continent things, fine lines and cold colours.  But in these
plethoric times when there is too much coarse stuff for everybody
and the struggle for life takes the form of competitive
advertisement and the effort to fill your neighbour's eye, when
there is no urgent demand either for personal courage, sound
nerves or stark beauty, we find ourselves by accident.  Always
before these times the bulk of the people did not over-eat
themselves, because they couldn't, whether they wanted to do so
or not, and all but a very few were kept "fit" by unavoidable
exercise and personal danger.  Now, if only he pitch his standard
low enough and keep free from pride, almost any one can achieve a
sort of excess. You can go through contemporary life fudging and
evading, indulging and slacking, never really hungry nor
frightened nor passionately stirred, your highest moment a mere
sentimental orgasm, and your first real contact with primary and
elemental necessities, the sweat of your death-bed.  So I think
it was with my uncle; so, very nearly, it was with me.
<P>
But the glider brought me up smartly.  I had to find out how
these things went down the air, and the only way to find out is
to go down with one.  And for a time I wouldn't face it.
<P>
There is something impersonal about a book, I suppose. At any
rate I find myself able to write down here just the confession
I've never been able to make to any one face to face, the
frightful trouble it was to me to bring myself to do what I
suppose every other coloured boy in the West Indies could do
without turning a hair, and that is to fling myself off for my
first soar down the wind.  The first trial was bound to be the
worst; it was an experiment I made with life, and the chance of
death or injury was, I supposed, about equal to the chance of
success.  I believed that with a dawn-like lucidity.  I had
begun with a glider that I imagined was on the lines of the
Wright brothers' aeroplane, but I could not be sure.  It might
turn over.  I might upset it.  It might burrow its nose at the
end and smash itself and me.  The conditions of the flight
necessitated alert attention; it wasn't a thing to be done by
jumping off and shutting one's eyes or getting angry or drunk to
do it.  One had to use one's weight to balance.  And when at last
I did it it was horrible--for ten seconds. For ten seconds or so,
as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and
with the wind in my eyes, the rush of the ground beneath me
filled me with sick and helpless terror; I felt as though some
violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone,
and I groaned aloud.  I set my teeth and groaned.  It was a groan
wrung out of me in spite of myself.  My sensations of terror
swooped to a climax.  And then, you know, they ended!
<P>
Suddenly my terror was over and done with.  I was soaring through
the air right way up, steadily, and no mischance had happened.  I
felt intensely alive and my nerves were strung like a bow.  I
shifted a limb, swerved and shouted between fear and triumph as I
recovered from the swerve and heeled the other way and steadied
myself.
<P>
I thought I was going to hit a rook that was flying athwart
me,--it was queer with what projectile silence that jumped upon
me out of nothingness, and I yelled helplessly, "Get out of the
way!"  The bird doubled itself up like a partly inverted V,
flapped, went up to the right abruptly and vanished from my
circle of interest.   Then I saw the shadow of my aeroplane
keeping a fixed distance before me and very steady, and the turf
as it seemed streaming out behind it.  The turf!--it wasn't after
all streaming so impossibly fast.
<P>
When I came gliding down to the safe spread of level green I had
chosen, I was as cool and ready as a city clerk who drops off an
omnibus in motion, and I had learnt much more than soaring.  I
tilted up her nose at the right moment, levelled again and
grounded like a snowflake on a windless day.  I lay flat for an
instant and then knelt up and got on my feet atremble, but very
satisfied with myself.  Cothope was running down the hill to me. 
...
<P>
But from that day I went into training, and I kept myself in
training for many months.  I had delayed my experiments for very
nearly six weeks on various excuses because of my dread of this
first flight, because of the slackness of body and spirit that
had come to me with the business life.  The shame of that
cowardice spurred me none the less because it was probably
altogether my own secret.  I felt that Cothope at any rate might
suspect.  Well,--he shouldn't suspect again.
<P>
It is curious that I remember that shame and self accusation and
its consequences far more distinctly than I recall the weeks of
vacillation before I soared.  For a time I went altogether
without alcohol, I stopped smoking altogether and ate very
sparingly, and every day I did something that called a little
upon my nerves and muscles.  I soared as frequently as I could. 
I substituted a motor-bicycle for the London train and took my
chances in the southward traffic, and I even tried what thrills
were to be got upon a horse.  But they put me on made horses, and
I conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes of
equestrian exercise in comparison with the adventures of
mechanism.  Also I walked along the high wall at the back of Lady
Grove garden, and at last brought myself to stride the gap where
the gate comes.  If I didn't altogether get rid of a certain
giddy instinct by such exercises, at least I trained my will
until it didn't matter.  And soon I no longer dreaded flight, but
was eager to go higher into the air, and I came to esteem soaring
upon a glider, that even over the deepest dip in the ground had
barely forty feet of fall beneath it, a mere mockery of what
flight might be.  I began to dream of the keener freshness in the
air high above the beechwoods, and it was rather to satisfy that
desire than as any legitimate development of my proper work that
presently I turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my
private income to the problem of the navigable balloon.
<P>
II
<P>
I had gone far beyond that initial stage; I had had two smashes
and a broken rib which my aunt nursed with great energy, and was
getting some reputation in the aeronautic world when, suddenly,
as though she had never really left it, the Honourable Beatrice
Normandy, dark-eyed, and with the old disorderly wave of the
hair from her brow, came back into my life.  She came riding down
a grass path in the thickets below Lady Grove, perched up on a
huge black horse, and the old Earl of Carnaby and Archie Garvell,
her half-brother, were with her.  My uncle had been bothering me
about the Crest Hill hot-water pipes, and we were returning by a
path transverse to theirs and came out upon them suddenly.  Old
Carnaby was trespassing on our ground, and so he hailed us in a
friendly fashion and pulled up to talk to us.
<P>
I didn't note Beatrice at all at first.  I was interested in Lord
Carnaby, that remarkable vestige of his own brilliant youth.  I
had heard of him, but never seen him.  For a man of sixty-five
who had sinned all the sins, so they said, and laid waste the
most magnificent political debut of any man of his generation, he
seemed to me to be looking remarkably fit and fresh.  He was a
lean little man with grey-blue eyes in his brown face, and his
cracked voice was the worst thing in his effect.
<P>
"Hope you don't mind us coming this way, Ponderevo," he cried;
and my uncle, who was sometimes a little too general and generous
with titles, answered, "Not at all, my lord, not at all!  Glad
you make use of it!" 
<P>
"You're building a great place over the hill," said Carnaby.
<P>
"Thought I'd make a show for once," said my uncle. "It looks big
because it's spread out for the sun."  
<P>
"Air and sunlight," said the earl.  "You can't have too much of
them.  But before our time they used to build for shelter and
water and the high road."  
<P>
Then I discovered that the silent figure behind the earl was
Beatrice.
<P>
I'd forgotten her sufficiently to think for a moment that she
hadn't changed at all since she had watched me from behind the
skirts of Lady Drew.  She was looking at me, and her dainty brow
under her broad brimmed hat--she was wearing a grey hat and loose
unbuttoned coat--was knit with perplexity, trying, I suppose, to
remember where she had seen me before.  Her shaded eyes met mine
with that mute question....
<P>
It seemed incredible to me she didn't remember.
<P>
"Well," said the earl and touched his horse.
<P>
Garvell was patting the neck of his horse, which was inclined to
fidget, and disregarding me.  He nodded over his shoulder and
followed.  His movement seemed to release a train of memories in
her.  She glanced suddenly at him and then back at me with a
flash of recognition that warmed instantly to a faint smile.  
She hesitated as if to speak to me, smiled broadly and
understandingly and turned to follow the others.  All three broke
into a canter and she did not look back. I stood for a second or
so at the crossing of the lanes, watching her recede, and then
became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking
over his shoulder in the belief that I was close behind.  I
turned about and strode to overtake him.  My mind was full of
Beatrice and this surprise.  I remembered her simply as a
Normandy.  I'd clean forgotten that Garvell was the son and she
the step-daughter of our neighbour, Lady Osprey.  Indeed, I'd
probably forgotten at that time that we had Lady Osprey as a
neighbour.  There was no reason at all for remembering it.  It
was amazing to find her in this Surrey countryside, when I'd
never thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at
Bladesover Park, near forty miles and twenty years away.  She was
so alive--so unchanged!  The same quick warm blood was in her
cheeks.  It seemed only yesterday that we had kissed among the
bracken stems....
<P>
"Eh?" I said.
<P>
"I say he's good stuff," said my uncle.  "You can say what you
like against the aristocracy, George; Lord Carnaby's rattling
good stuff.  There's a sort of Savoir Faire, something--it's an
old-fashioned phrase, George, but a good one there's a
Bong-Tong.... It's like the Oxford turf, George, you can't grow
it in a year.  I wonder how they do it.  It's living always on a
Scale, George.  It's being there from the beginning."...
<P>
"She might," I said to myself, "be a picture by Romney come
alive!" 
<P>
"They tell all these stories about him," said my uncle, "but what
do they all amount to?" 
<P>
"Gods!" I said to myself; "but why have I forgotten for so long?
Those queer little brows of hers, the touch of mischief in her
eyes--the way she breaks into a smile!" 
<P>
"I don't blame him," said my uncle.  "Mostly it's imagination. 
That and leisure, George.  When I was a young man I was kept
pretty busy.  So were you.  Even then--!" 
<P>
What puzzled me more particularly was the queer trick of my
memory that had never recalled anything vital of Beatrice
whatever when I met Garvell again that had, indeed, recalled
nothing except a boyish antagonism and our fight.  Now when my
senses were full of her, it seemed incredible that I could ever
have forgotten....
<P>
III
<P>
"Oh, Crikey!" said my aunt, reading a letter behind her
coffee-machine.  "HERE'S a young woman, George!" 
<P>
We were breakfasting together in the big window bay at Lady Grove
that looks upon the iris beds; my uncle was in London.
<P>
I sounded an interrogative note and decapitated an egg.
<P>
"Who's Beatrice Normandy?" asked my aunt.  "I've not heard of her
before."  
<P>
"She the young woman?" 
<P>
"Yes.  Says she knows you.  I'm no hand at old etiquette, George,
but her line is a bit unusual.  Practically she says she's going
to make her mother--"
<P>
"Eh?  Step-mother, isn't it?" 
<P>
"You seem to know a lot about her.  She says 'mother'--Lady
Osprey.  They're to call on me, anyhow, next Wednesday week at
four, and there's got to be you for tea."  
<P>
"Eh?" 
<P>
"You--for tea.
<P>
"H'm.  She had rather--force of character.  When I knew her
before."  
<P>
I became aware of my aunt's head sticking out obliquely from
behind the coffee-machine and regarding me with wide blue
curiosity.  I met her gaze for a moment, flinched, coloured, and
laughed.
<P>
"I've known her longer than I've known you," I said, and
explained at length.
<P>
My aunt kept her eye on me over and round the coffee-machine as
I did so.  She was greatly interested, and asked several
elucidatory questions.
<P>
"Why didn't you tell me the day you saw her?  You've had her on
your mind for a week," she said.
<P>
"It IS odd I didn't tell you," I admitted.
<P>
"You thought I'd get a Down on her," said my aunt conclusively. 
"That's what you thought" and opened the rest of her letters.
<P>
The two ladies came in a pony-carriage with conspicuous 
punctuality, and I had the unusual experience of seeing my aunt
entertaining callers.  We had tea upon the terrace under the
cedar, but old Lady Osprey, being an embittered Protestant, had
never before seen the inside of the house, and we made a sort of
tour of inspection that reminded me of my first visit to the
place.  In spite of my preoccupation with Beatrice, I stored a
queer little memory of the contrast between the two other women;
my aunt, tall, slender and awkward, in a simple blue homekeeping
dress, an omnivorous reader and a very authentic wit, and the
lady of pedigree, short and plump, dressed with Victorian
fussiness, living at the intellectual level of palmistry and
genteel fiction, pink in the face and generally flustered by a
sense of my aunt's social strangeness and disposed under the
circumstances to behave rather like an imitation of the more
queenly moments of her own cook.  The one seemed made of
whalebone, the other of dough.  My aunt was nervous, partly
through the intrinsic difficulty of handling the lady and partly
because of her passionate desire to watch Beatrice and me, and
her nervousness took a common form with her, a wider clumsiness
of gesture and an exacerbation of her habitual oddity of phrase
which did much to deepen the pink perplexity of the lady of
title.  For instance, I heard my aunt admit that one of the
Stuart Durgan ladies did look a bit "balmy on the crumpet"; she
described the knights of the age of chivalry as "korvorting about
on the off-chance of a dragon"; she explained she was "always
old mucking about the garden," and instead of offering me a
Garibaldi biscuit, she asked me with that faint lisp of hers, to
"have some squashed flies, George."  I felt convinced Lady Osprey
would describe her as "a most eccentric person" on the very first
opportunity;-- "a most eccentric person."  One could see her, as
people say, "shaping" for that.
<P>
Beatrice was dressed very quietly in brown, with a simple but
courageous broad-brimmed hat, and an unexpected quality of being
grown-up and responsible.  She guided her step-mother through
the first encounter, scrutinised my aunt, and got us all well in
movement through the house, and then she turned her attention to
me with a quick and half-confident smile.
<P>
"We haven't met," she said, "since--"
<P>
"It was in the Warren."  
<P>
"Of course," she said, "the Warren!  I remembered it all except
just the name.... I was eight."  
<P>
Her smiling eyes insisted on my memories being thorough.  I
looked up and met them squarely, a little at a loss for what I
should say.
<P>
"I gave you away pretty completely," she said, meditating upon my
face.  "And afterwards I gave way Archie."  
<P>
She turned her face away from the others, and her voice fell ever
so little.
<P>
"They gave him a licking for telling lies!" she said, as though
that was a pleasant memory.  "And when it was all over I went to
our wigwam.  You remember the wigwam?" 
<P>
"Out in the West Wood?" 
<P>
"Yes--and cried--for all the evil I had done you, I suppose.... 
I've often thought of it since."...
<P>
Lady Osprey stopped for us to overtake her.  "My dear!" she said
to Beatrice.  "Such a beautiful gallery!"  Then she stared very
hard at me, puzzled in the most naked fashion to understand who I
might be.
<P>
"People say the oak staircase is rather good," said my aunt, and
led the way.
<P>
Lady Osprey, with her skirts gathered for the ascent to the
gallery and her hand on the newel, turned and addressed a look
full of meaning overflowing indeed with meanings--at her charge. 
The chief meaning no doubt was caution about myself, but much of
it was just meaning at large.  I chanced to catch the response in
a mirror and detected Beatrice with her nose wrinkled into a
swift and entirely diabolical grimace.  Lady Osprey became a
deeper shade of pink and speechless with indignation--it was
evident she disavowed all further responsibility, as she
followed my aunt upstairs.
<P>
"It's dark, but there's a sort of dignity," said Beatrice  very
distinctly, regarding the hall with serene tranquillity, and
allowing the unwilling feet on the stairs to widen their distance
from us.  She stood a step up, so that she looked down a little
upon me and over me at the old hall.
<P>
She turned upon me abruptly when she thought her step-mother was
beyond ear-shot.
<P>
"But how did you get here?" she asked.
<P>
"Here?" 
<P>
"All this."  She indicated space and leisure by a wave of the
hand at hall and tall windows and sunlit terrace.  "Weren't you
the housekeeper's son?" 
<P>
"I've adventured.  My uncle has become--a great financier.  He
used to be a little chemist about twenty miles from Bladesover. 
We're promoters now, amalgamators, big people on the new model." 
<P>
"I understand."  She regarded me with interested eyes, visibly
thinking me out.
<P>
"And you recognised me?" I asked.
<P>
"After a second or so.  I saw you recognised me.  I couldn't
place you, but I knew I knew you.  Then Archie being there helped
me to remember."  
<P>
"I'm glad to meet again," I ventured.  "I'd never forgotten you."
<P>
"One doesn't forget those childish things."  
<P>
We regarded one another for a moment with a curiously easy and
confident satisfaction in coming together again.  I can't explain
our ready zest in one another. The thing was so.  We pleased each
other, we had no doubt in our minds that we pleased each other. 
From the first we were at our ease with one another.  "So
picturesque, so very picturesque," came a voice from above, and
then:  "Bee-atrice!" 
<P>
"I've a hundred things I want to know about you," she said with
an easy intimacy, as we went up the winding  steps....
<P>
As the four of us sat at tea together under the cedar on the
terrace she asked questions about my aeronautics. My aunt helped
with a word or so about my broken ribs.  Lady Osprey evidently
regarded flying as a most indesirable and improper topic--a
blasphemous intrusion upon the angels.  "It isn't flying," I
explained. "We don't fly yet."  
<P>
"You never will," she said compactly.  "You never will."  
<P>
"Well," I said, "we do what we can."  
<P>
The little lady lifted a small gloved hand and indicated  a
height of about four feet from the ground. "Thus far," she said,
"thus far--AND NO FARTHER!  No!" 
<P>
She became emphatically pink.  "NO," she said again quite
conclusively, and coughed shortly.  "Thank you," she said to her
ninth or tenth cake.  Beatrice burst into cheerful laughter with
her eye on me.  I was lying on the turf, and this perhaps caused
a slight  confusion about the primordial curse in Lady Osprey's
mind.
<P>
"Upon his belly shall he go," she said with quiet distinctness,
"all the days of his life."  
<P>
After which we talked no more of aeronautics.
<P>
Beatrice sat bunched together in a chair and regarded me with
exactly the same scrutiny, I thought, the same adventurous
aggression, that I had faced long ago at the tea-table in my
mother's room.  She was amazingly like that little Princess of my
Bladesover memories, the wilful misbehaviours of her hair seemed
the same--her voice; things one would have expected to be changed
altogether.  She formed her plans in the same quick way, and
acted with the same irresponsible decision.
<P>
She stood up abruptly.
<P>
"What is there beyond the terrace?" she said, and found me
promptly beside her.
<P>
I invented a view for her.
<P>
At the further corner from the cedar she perched herself up upon
the parapet and achieved an air of comfort among the lichenous
stones.  "Now tell me,"  she said, "all about yourself.  Tell me
about yourself; I know such duffers of men!  They all do the same
things.  How did you get--here?  All my men WERE here.  They
couldn't have got here if they hadn't been here always.  They
wouldn't have thought it right. You've climbed."  
<P>
"If it's climbing," I said.
<P>
She went off at a tangent.  "It's--I don't know if you'll
understand--interesting to meet you again.  I've remembered you. 
I don't know why, but I have.  I've used you as a sort of lay
figure--when I've told myself stories.  But you've always been
rather stiff and difficult in my stories--in ready-made
clothes--a Labour Member or a Bradlaugh, or something like that. 
You're not like that a bit.  And yet you ARE!" 
<P>
She looked at me.  "Was it much of a fight?  They make out it is.
<P>
I don't know why."  
<P>
"I was shot up here by an accident," I said.  "There was no fight
at all.  Except to keep honest, perhaps and I made no great
figure in that.  I and my uncle mixed a medicine and it blew us
up.  No merit in that!  But you've been here all the time.  Tell
me what you have done first."  
<P>
"One thing we didn't do."  She meditated for a moment.
<P>
"What?" said I.
<P>
"Produce a little half-brother for Bladesover.  So it went to
the Phillbrick gang.  And they let it!  And I and my
step-mother--we let, too.  And live in a little house."  
<P>
She nodded her head vaguely over her shoulder and turned to me
again.  "Well, suppose it was an accident.  Here you are!  Now
you're here, what are you going to do?  You're young.  Is it to
be Parliament? heard some men the other day talking about you. 
Before I knew you were you.  They said that was what you ought to
do."...
<P>
She put me through my intentions with a close and vital
curiosity.  It was just as she had tried to imagine  me a soldier
and place me years ago.  She made me feel more planless and
incidental than ever.  "You want to make a flying-machine," she
pursued, "and when you fly?  What then?  Would it be for
fighting?
<P>
I told her something of my experimental work.  She had never
heard of the soaring aeroplane, and was excited  by the thought,
and keen to hear about it.  She had thought all the work so far
had been a mere projecting of impossible machines.  For her
Pilcher and Lilienthal had died in vain.  She did not know such
men had lived in the world.
<P>
"But that's dangerous!" she said, with a note of discovery.
<P>
"Oh!--it's dangerous."  
<P>
"Bee-atrice!" Lady Osprey called.
<P>
Beatrice dropped from the wall to her feet.
<P>
"Where do you do this soaring?" 
<P>
"Beyond the high Barrows.  East of Crest Hill and the wood."  
<P>
"Do you mind people coming to see?" 
<P>
"Whenever you please.  Only let me know"
<P>
"I'll take my chance some day.  Some day soon."   She looked at
me thoughtfully, smiled, and our talk was at an end.
<P>
IV                       
<P>
All my later work in aeronautics is associated in my memory with
the quality of Beatrice, with her incidenta] presence, with
things she said and did and things I thought of that had
reference to her.
<P>
In the spring of that year I had got to a flying machine that
lacked nothing but longitudinal stability.  My model flew like a
bird for fifty or a hundred yards or so, and then either dived
and broke its nose or, what was commoner, reared up, slid back
and smashed its propeller.  The rhythm of the pitching puzzled
me.  I felt it must obey some laws not yet quite clearly stated.
I became therefore a student of theory and literature for a time;
I hit upon the string of considerations that led me to what is
called Ponderevo's Principle and my F.R.S., and I worked this out
in three long papers.  Meanwhile I made a lot of turn-table and
glider models and started in upon an idea of combining gas-bags
and gliders.  Balloon work was new to me.  I had made one or two
ascents in the balloons of the Aero Club before I started my
gasometer and the balloon shed and gave Cothope a couple of
months with Sir Peter Rumchase.   My uncle found part of the
money for these developments; he was growing interested and
competitive in this business because of Lord Boom's prize and
the amount of reclame involved, and it was at his request that
I named my first navigable balloon Lord Roberts Alpha.
<P>
Lord Roberts A very nearly terminated all my investigations.  My
idea both in this and its more successful and famous younger
brother, Lord Roberts B, was to utilise the idea of a contractile
balloon with a rigid flat base, a balloon shaped rather like an
inverted boat that should almost support the apparatus, but not
quite.  The gas-bag was of the chambered sort used for these long
forms, and not with an internal balloonette.  The trouble was to
make the thing contractile.  This I sought to do by fixing a
long, fine-meshed silk net over it that was fastened to be
rolled up on two longitudinal rods.  Practically I contracted my
sausage gas-bag by netting it down.  The ends were too complex
for me to describe here, but I thought them out elaborately and
they were very carefully planned.  Lord Roberts A was furnished
with a single big screw forward, and there was a rudder aft.  The
engine was the first one to be, so to speak, right in the plane
of the gas-bag.  I lay immediately under the balloon on a sort
of glider framework, far away from either engine or rudder,
controlling them by wire-pulls constructed on the principle of
the well-known Bowden brake of the cyclist.
<P>
But Lord Roberts A has been pretty exhaustively figured and
described in various aeronautical publications.  The unforeseen
defect was the badness of the work in the silk netting.  It tore
aft as soon as I began to contract the balloon, and the last two
segments immediately bulged through the hole, exactly as an
inner tube will bulge through the ruptured outer cover of a
pneumatic tire, and then the sharp edge of the torn net cut the
oiled-silk of the distended last segment along a weak seam and
burst it with a loud report.
<P>
Up to that point the whole thing had been going on extremely
well.  As a navigable balloon and before I contracted it, the
Lord Roberts A was an unqualified success.  It had run out of the
shed admirably at nine or ten miles an hour or more, and although
there was a gentle southwester blowing, it had gone up and turned
and faced it as well as any craft of the sort I have ever seen.
<P>
I lay in my customary glider position, horizontal and face
downward, and the invisibility of all the machinery gave an
extraordinary effect of independent levitation.  Only by looking
up, as it were, and turning my head back could I see the flat
aeroplane bottom of the balloon and the rapid successive
passages, swish, swish, swish of the vans of the propeller.  I
made a wide circle over Lady Grove and Duffield and out towards
Effingham and came back quite successfully to the starting-point.
<P>
Down below in the October sunlight were my sheds and the little
group that had been summoned to witness the start, their faces
craned upward and most of them scrutinising my expression through
field-glasses.  I could see Carnaby and Beatrice on horseback,
and two girls I did not know with them; Cothope and three or four
workmen I employed; my aunt and Mrs. Levinstein, who was staying
with her, on foot, and Dimmock, the veterinary surgeon, and one
or two others.  My shadow moved a little to the north of them
like the shadow of a fish.  At Lady Grove the servants were out
on the lawn, and the Duffield school playground swarmed with
children too indifferent to aeronautics to cease their playing. 
But in the Crest Hill direction--the place looked extraordinarily
squat and ugly from above--there were knots and strings of
staring workmen everywhere--not one of them working, but all
agape.  (But now I write it, it occurs to me that perhaps it was
their dinner hour; it was certainly near twelve.)  I hung for a
moment or so enjoying the soar, then turned about to face a clear
stretch of open down, let the engine out to full speed and set my
rollers at work rolling in the net, and so tightening the
gas-bags.  Instantly the pace quickened with the diminished
resistance...
<P>
In that moment before the bang I think I must have been really
flying.  Before the net ripped, just in the instant when my
balloon was at its systole, the whole apparatus was, I am
convinced, heavier than air.  That, however, is a claim that has
been disputed, and in any case this sort of priority is a very
trivial thing.
<P>
Then came a sudden retardation, instantly followed by an
inexpressibly disconcerting tilt downward of the machine.  That I
still recall with horror.  I couldn't see what was happening at
all and I couldn't imagine. It was a mysterious, inexplicable
dive.  The thing, it seemed, without rhyme or reason, was kicking
up its heels in the air.  The bang followed immediately, and I
perceived I was falling rapidly.
<P>
I was too much taken by surprise to think of the proper cause of
the report.  I don't even know what I made of it.  I was
obsessed, I suppose, by that perpetual dread of the modern
aeronaut, a flash between engine and balloon.  Yet obviously I
wasn't wrapped in flames.  I ought to have realised instantly it
wasn't that.  I did, at any rate, whatever other impressions
there were, release the winding of the outer net and let the
balloon expand again, and that no doubt did something to break my
fall.  I don't remember doing that.  Indeed, all I do remember is
the giddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it
down a flat spiral, the hurried rush of fields and trees and
cottages on my left shoulder and the overhung feeling as if the
whole apparatus was pressing down the top of my head.  I didn't
stop or attempt to stop the screw.  That was going on, swish,
swish, swish all the time.
<P>
Cothope really knows more about the fall than I do.  He describes
the easterly start, the tilt, and the appearance and bursting of
a sort of bladder aft.  Then down I swooped, very swiftly, but
not nearly so steeply as I imagined I was doing.  "Fifteen or
twenty degrees,"  said Cothope, "to be exact."  From him it was
that I learnt that I let the nets loose again, and so arrested my
fall.  He thinks I was more in control of myself than I remember.
<P>
But I do not see why I should have forgotten so excellent a
resolution.  His impression is that I was really steering and
trying to drop into the Farthing Down beeches.  "You hit the
trees," he said, "and the whole affair stood on its nose among
them, and then very slowly crumpled up.  I saw you'd been jerked
out, as I thought, and I didn't stay for more.  I rushed for my
bicycle."  
<P>
As a matter of fact, it was purely accidental that I came down in
the woods.  I am reasonably certain that I had no more control
then than a thing in a parcel. I remember I felt a sort of
wincing, "Now it comes!" as the trees rushed up to me.  If I
remember that, I should remember steering.  Then the propeller
smashed, everything stopped with a jerk, and I was falling into a
mass of yellowing leaves, and Lord Roberts A, so it seemed to me,
was going back into the sky.
<P>
I felt twigs and things hit me in the face, but I didn't feel
injured at the time; I clutched at things that broke, tumbled
through a froth of green and yellow into a shadowy world of great
bark-covered arms, and there, snatching wildly, got a grip on a
fair round branch, and hung.
<P>
I became intensely alert and clear-headed.  I held by that
branch for a moment and then looked about me, and caught at
another, and then found myself holding to a practicable fork.  I
swung forward to that and got a leg around it below its junction,
and so was able presently to clamber down, climbing very coolly
and deliberately. I dropped ten feet or so from the lowest branch
and fell on my feet.  "That's all right," I said, and stared up
through the tree to see what I could of the deflated and crumpled
remains that had once been Lord Roberts A festooned on the
branches it had broken. "Gods!" I said, "what a tumble!" 
<P>
I wiped something that trickled from my face and was shocked to
see my hand covered with blood.  I looked at myself and saw what
seemed to me an astonishing quantity of blood running down my arm
and shoulder.  I perceived my mouth was full of blood. It's a
queer moment when one realises one is hurt, and perhaps badly
hurt, and has still to discover just how far one is hurt.  I
explored my face carefully and found unfamiliar contours on the
left side.  The broken end of a branch had driven right through
my cheek, damaging my cheek and teeth and gums, and left a
splinter of itself stuck, like an explorer's fartherest-point
flag, in the upper maxillary.  That and a sprained wrist were all
my damage.  But I bled as though I had been chopped to pieces,
and it seemed to me that my face had been driven in.  I can't
describe just the horrible disgust I felt at that.
<P>
"This blood must be stopped, anyhow," I said, thickheadedly.
<P>
"I wonder where there's a spider's web"--an odd twist for my
mind to take.  But it was the only treatment that occurred to me.
<P>
I must have conceived some idea of going home unaided, because I
was thirty yards from the tree before I dropped.
<P>
Then a kind of black disc appeared in the middle of the world and
rushed out to the edge of things and blotted them out.  I don't
remember falling down.  I fainted from excitement, disgust at my
injury and loss of blood, and lay there until Cothope found me.
<P>
He was the first to find me, scorching as he did over the
downland turf, and making a wide course to get the Carnaby
plantations at their narrowest.  Then presently, while he was
trying to apply the methodical teachings of the St. John's
Ambulance classes to a rather abnormal case, Beatrice came
galloping through the trees full-tilt, with Lord Carnaby hard
behind her, and she was hatless, muddy from a fall, and white as
death.  "And cool as a cucumber, too," said Cothope, turning it
over in his mind as he told me.
<P>
("They never seem quite to have their heads, and never seem quite
to lose 'em," said Cothope, generalising about the sex.)
<P>
Also he witnessed she acted with remarkable decision.  The
question was whether I should be taken to the house her
step-mother occupied at Bedley Corner, the Carnaby dower house,
or down to Carnaby's place at Easting.  Beatrice had no doubt in
the matter, for she meant to nurse me.  Carnaby didn't seem to
want that to happen. "She WOULD have it wasn't half so far,"
said Cothope.  "She faced us out....
<P>
"I hate to be faced out of my opinion, so I've taken a pedometer
over it since.  It's exactly forty-three yards further.
<P>
"Lord Carnaby looked at her pretty straight," said Cothope,
finishing the picture; "and then he give in."
<P>
V                         
<P>
But my story has made a jump from June to October, and during
that time my relations with Beatrice and the countryside that was
her setting had developed in many directions.  She came and went,
moving in an orbit for which I had no data, going to London and
Paris, into Wales and Northampton, while her stepmother, on some
independent system of her own, also vanished and recurred
intermittently.  At home they obeyed the rule of an inflexible
old maid, Charlotte, and Beatrice exercised all the rights of
proprietorship in Carnaby's extensive stables.  Her interest in
me was from the first undisguised.  She found her way to my
worksheds and developed rapidly, in spite of the sincere 
discouragement of Cothope, into a keen amateur of aeronautics. 
She would come sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the
afternoon, sometimes afoot with an Irish terrier, sometimes
riding.  She would come for three or four days every day, vanish
for a fortnight or three weeks, return.
<P>
It was not long before I came to look for her.  From the first I
found her immensely interesting.  To me she was a new feminine
type altogether--I have made it plain, I think, how limited was
my knowledge of women.  But she made me not simply interested in
her, but in myself.  She became for me something that greatly
changes a man's world.  How shall I put it?  She became an
audience.  Since I've emerged from the emotional developments of
the affair I have thought it out in a hundred aspects, and it
does seem to me that this way in which men and women make
audiences for one another is a curiously influential force in
their lives.  For some it seems an audience is a vital necessity,
they seek audiences as creatures seek food; others again, my
uncle among them, can play to an imaginary audience.  I, I think,
have lived and can live without one.  In my adolescence I was my
own audience and my own court of honour.  And to have an audience
in one's mind is to play a part, to become self-conscious and
dramatic.  For many years I had been self-forgetful and
scientific.  I had lived for work and impersonal interests until
I found scrutiny, applause and expectation in Beatrice's eyes. 
Then I began to live for the effect I imagined I made upon her,
to make that very soon the principal value in my life.  I played
to her.  I did things for the look of them.  I began to dream
more and more of beautiful situations and fine poses and
groupings with her and for her.
<P>
I put these things down because they puzzle me.  I think I was in
love with Beatrice, as being in love is usually understood; but
it was quite a different state altogether from my passionate
hunger for Marion, or my keen, sensuous desire for and pleasure
in Effie.  These were selfish, sincere things, fundamental and 
instinctive, as sincere as the leap of a tiger.  But until
matters drew to a crisis with Beatrice, there was an immense
imaginative insurgence of a quite different quality.  I am
setting down here very gravely, and perhaps absurdly, what are no
doubt elementary commonplaces  for innumerable people.  This love
that grew up between Beatrice and myself was, I think--I put it
quite tentatively and rather curiously--romantic love.  That
unfortunate and truncated affair of my uncle and the Scrymgeour
lady was really of the same stuff, if a little different in
quality.  I have to admit that.  The factor of audience was of
primary importance in either else.
<P>
Its effect upon me was to make me in many respects adolescent
again.  It made me keener upon the point of honour, and anxious
and eager to do high and splendid things, and in particular,
brave things.  So far it ennobled and upheld me.  But it did also
push me towards vulgar and showy things.  At bottom it was
disingenuous; it gave my life the quality of stage scenery, with
one side to the audience, another side that wasn't meant to show,
and an economy of substance.  It certainly robbed my work of high
patience and quality.  I cut down the toil of research in my
eagerness and her eagerness for fine flourishes in the air,
flights that would tell. I shirked the longer road.
<P>
And it robbed me, too, of any fine perception of absurdity.
<P>
Yet that was not everything in our relationship.  The elemental
thing was there also.  It came in very suddenly.
<P>
It was one day in the summer, though I do not now recall without
reference to my experimental memoranda whether it was in July or
August.  I was working  with a new and more bird-like aeroplane
with wing curvatures studied from Lilienthal, Pilcher and
Phillips, that I thought would give a different rhythm for the
pitching oscillations than anything I'd had before.  I was
soaring my long course from the framework on the old barrow by my
sheds down to Tinker's Corner.  It is a clear stretch of
downland, except for two or three thickets of box and thorn to
the right of my course; one transverse trough, in which there is
bush and a small rabbit warren, comes in from the east.  I had
started, and was very intent on the peculiar long swoop with
which any new arrangement flew.  Then, without any sort of
notice, right ahead of me appeared Beatrice, riding towards
Tinker's Corner to waylay and talk to me.  She looked round over
her shoulder, saw me coming, touched her horse to a gallop, and
then the brute bolted right into the path of my machine.
<P>
There was a queer moment of doubt whether we shouldn't all smash
together.  I had to make up my mind very quickly whether I would
pitch-up and drop backward at once and take my chance of falling
undamaged--a poor chance it would have been--in order to avoid
any risk to her, or whether I would lift against the wind and
soar right over her.  This latter I did.  She had already got her
horse in hand when I came up to her.  Her woman's body lay along
his neck, and she glanced up as I, with wings aspread, and every
nerve in a state of tension, swept over her.
<P>
Then I had landed, and was going back to where her horse stood
still and trembling.
<P>
We exchanged no greetings.  She slid from her saddle into my
arms, and for one instant I held her.
<P>
"Those great wings," she said, and that was all.
<P>
She lay in my arms, and I thought for a moment she had fainted.
<P>
"Very near a nasty accident," said Cothope, coming up and
regarding our grouping with disfavour.  He took her horse by the
bridle.  "Very dangerous thing coming across us like that."  
<P>
Beatrice disengaged herself from me, stood for a moment
trembling, and then sat down on the turf "I'll just sit down for
a moment," she said.
<P>
"Oh!" she said.
<P>
She covered her face with her hands, while Cothope looked at her
with an expression between suspicion and impatience.
<P>
For some moments nobody moved.  Then Cothope remarked that
perhaps he'd better get her water.
<P>
As for me, I was filled with a new outrageous idea, begotten I
scarcely know how from this incident, with its instant contacts
and swift emotions, and that was that I must make love to and
possess Beatrice.  I see no particular reason why that thought
should have come to me in that moment, but it did.  I do not
believe that before then I had thought of our relations in such
terms at all.  Suddenly, as I remember it, the factor of passion
came.  She crouched there, and I stood over her, and neither of
us said a word.  But it was just as though something had been
shouted from the sky.
<P>
Cothope had gone twenty paces perhaps when she uncovered her
face.  "I shan't want any water," she said.  "Call him back." 
<P>
VI
                           
After that the spirit of our relations changed.  The old ease had
gone.  She came to me less frequently, and when she came she
would have some one with her, usually old Carnaby, and he would
do the bulk of the talking.  All through September she was away. 
When we were alone together there was a curious constraint. We
became clouds of inexpressible feeling towards one another; we
could think of nothing that was not too momentous for words.
<P>
Then came the smash of Lord Roberts A, and I found myself with a
bandaged face in a bedroom in the Bedley Corner dower-house
with Beatrice presiding over an inefficient nurse, Lady Osprey
very pink and shocked in the background, and my aunt jealously
intervening.
<P>
My injuries were much more showy than serious, and I could have
been taken to Lady Grove next day, but Beatrice would not permit
that, and kept me at Bedley Corner three clear days.  In the
afternoon of the second day she became extremely solicitous for
the proper aeration of the nurse, packed her off for an hour in a
brisk rain, and sat by me alone.
<P>
I asked her to marry me.
<P>
All the whole I must admit it was not a situation that lent
itself to eloquence.  I lay on my back and talked through
bandages, and with some little difficulty, for my tongue and
mouth had swollen.  But I was feverish and in pain, and the
emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her
became now an unendurable impatience.
<P>
"Comfortable?" she asked.
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Shall I read to you?" 
<P>
"No.  I want to talk."  
<P>
"You can't.  I'd better talk to you."  
<P>
"No," I said, "I want to talk to you."  
<P>
She came and stood by my bedside and looked me in the eyes.  "I
don't--I don't want you to talk to me," she said.  "I thought you
couldn't talk."  
<P>
"I get few chances--of you."  
<P>
"You'd better not talk.  Don't talk now.  Let me chatter instead.
<P>
You ought not to talk."  
<P>
"It isn't much" I said.
<P>
"I'd rather you didn't."  
<P>
"I'm not going to be disfigured," I said.  "Only a scar."  
<P>
"Oh!" she said, as if she had expected something quite
different.  "Did you think you'd become a sort of gargoyle?" 
<P>
"L'Homme qui Rit!--I didn't know.  But that's all right.  Jolly
flowers those are!" 
<P>
"Michaelmas daisies," she said.  "I'm glad you'r not disfigured,
and those are perennial sunflowers.  Do you know no flowers at
all?  When I saw you on the ground I certainly thought you were
dead.  You ought to have been, by all the rules of the game."  
<P>
She said some other things, but I was thinking of my next move.
<P>
"Are we social equals?" I said abruptly.
<P>
She stared at me.  "Queer question," she said.
<P>
"But are we?" 
<P>
"H'm.  Difficult to say.  But why do you ask?  Is the daughter of
a courtesy Baron who died--of general disreputableness, I
believe--before his father--?  I give it up.  Does it matter?" 
<P>
"No.  My mind is confused.  I want to know if you will marry me."
<P>
She whitened and said nothing.  I suddenly felt I must plead with
her.  "Damn these bandages!" I said, breaking into ineffectual
febrile rage.
<P>
She roused herself to her duties as nurse.  "What are you doing?
Why are you trying to sit up?  Sit down!  Don't touch your
bandages.  I told you not to talk."  
<P>
She stood helpless for a moment, then took me firmly by the
shoulders and pushed me back upon the pillow.  She gripped the
wrist of the hand I had raised to my face.
<P>
"I told you not to talk," she whispered close to my face.  "I
asked you not to talk.  Why couldn't you do as I asked you?" 
<P>
"You've been avoiding me for a month," I said.
<P>
"I know.  You might have known.  Put your hand back--down by your
side."  
<P>
I obeyed.  She sat on the edge of the bed.  A flush had come to
her cheeks, and her eyes were very bright. "I asked you," she
repeated, "not to talk."  
<P>
My eyes questioned her mutely.
<P>
She put her hand on my chest.  Her eyes were tormented.
<P>
"How can I answer you now?" she said.
<P>
"How can I say anything now?" 
<P>
"What do you mean?" I asked.
<P>
She made no answer.
<P>
"Do you mean it must be 'No'?" 
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"But" I said, and my whole soul was full of accusations.
<P>
"I know," she said.  "I can't explain.  I can't.  But it has to
be 'No!' It can't be.  It's utterly, finally, for ever
impossible.... Keep your hands still!" 
<P>
"But," I said, "when we met again--"
<P>
"I can't marry.  I can't and won't."  
<P>
She stood up. "Why did you talk?" she cried, "couldn't you SEE?"
<P>
She seemed to have something it was impossible to say.
<P>
She came to the table beside my bed and pulled the Michaelmas
daisies awry.  "Why did you talk like that?" she said in a tone
of infinite bitterness.  "To begin like that!" 
<P>
"But what is it?" I said.  "Is it some circumstance--my social
position?" 
<P>
"Oh, DAMN your social position!" she cried.
<P>
She went and stood at the further window, staring out at the
rain.  For a long time we were absolutely still.  The wind and
rain came in little gusts upon the pane.  She turned to me
abruptly.
<P>
"You didn't ask me if I loved you," she said.
<P>
"Oh, if it's THAT!" said I.
<P>
"It's not that," she said.  "But if you want to know--"  She
paused.
<P>
"I do," she said.
<P>
We stared at one another.
<P>
"I do--with all my heart, if you want to know."
<P>
"Then, why the devil--?" I asked.
<P>
She made no answer.  She walked across the room to the piano and
began to play, rather noisily and rapidly, with odd gusts of
emphasis, the shepherd's pipe music from the last act in "Tristan
and Isolde."  Presently she missed a note, failed again, ran her
finger heavily up the scale, struck the piano passionately with
her fist, making a feeble jar in the treble, jumped up, and went
out of the room....
<P>
The nurse found me still wearing my helmet of bandages, partially
dressed, and pottering round the room to find the rest of my
clothes.  I was in a state of exasperated hunger for Beatrice,
and I was too inflamed and weakened to conceal the state of my
mind.  I was feebly angry because of the irritation of dressing,
and particularly of the struggle to put on my trousers without
being able to see my legs.  I was staggering about, and once I
had fallen over a chair and I had upset the jar of Michaelmas
daisies.
<P>
I must have been a detestable spectacle.  "I'll go back to bed,"
said I, "if I may have a word with Miss Beatrice.  I've got
something to say to her.  That's why I'm dressing."  
<P>
My point was conceded, but there were long delays.  Whether the
household had my ultimatum or whether she told Beatrice directly
I do not know, and what Lady Osprey can have made of it in the
former case I don't imagine.
<P>
At last Beatrice came and stood by my bedside. "Well?" she said.
<P>
"All I want to say," I said with the querulous note of a
misunderstood child, "is that I can't take this as final.  I want
to see you and talk when I'm better, and write.  I can't do
anything now.  I can't argue."  
<P>
I was overtaken with self-pity and began to snivel, "I can't
rest.  You see? I can't do anything."  
<P>
She sat down beside me again and spoke softly.  "I promise I will
talk it all over with you again.  When you are well.  I promise I
will meet you somewhere so that we can talk.  You can't talk now.
<P>
I asked you not to talk now.  All you want to know you shall
know... Will that do?" 
<P>
"I'd like to know"
<P>
She looked round to see the door was closed, stood up and went to
it.
<P>
Then she crouched beside me and began whispering very softly and
rapidly with her face close to me.
<P>
"Dear," she said, "I love you.  If it will make you happy to
marry me, I will marry you.  I was in a mood just now--a stupid,
inconsiderate mood.  Of course I will marry you.  You are my
prince, my king.  Women are such things of mood--or I would have
behaved differently.  We say 'No' when we mean 'Yes'--and fly
into crises.  So now, Yes--yes--yes.  I will.  I can't even kiss
you.  Give me your hand to kiss that.  Understand, I am yours. 
Do you understand? I am yours just as if we had been married
fifty years.  Your wife--Beatrice.  Is that enough?  Now--now
will you rest?" 
<P>
"Yes," I said, "but why?" 
<P>
"There are complications.  There are difficulties.  When you are
better you will be able to--understand them.  But now they don't
matter.  Only you know this must be secret--for a time. 
Absolutely secret between  us.  Will you promise that?" 
<P>
"Yes," I said, "I understand.  I wish I could kiss you."
<P>
She laid her head down beside mine for a moment and then she
kissed my hand.
<P>
"I don't care what difficulties there are," I said, and I shut my
eyes.
<P>
VII                         
<P>
But I was only beginning to gauge the unaccountable elements in
Beatrice.  For a week after my return to Lady Grove I had no sign
of her, and then she called with Lady Osprey and brought a huge
bunch of perennial sunflowers and Michaelmas daisies, "just the
old flowers there were in your room," said my aunt, with a
relentless eye on me.  I didn't get any talk alone with Beatrice
then, and she took occasion to tell us she was going to London
for some indefinite number of weeks.  I couldn't even pledge her
to write to me, and when she did it was a brief, enigmatical,
friendly letter with not a word of the reality between us.
<P>
I wrote back a love letter--my first love letter--and she made no
reply for eight days.  Then came a scrawl: "I can't write
letters.  Wait till we can talk.  Are you better?" 
<P>
I think the reader would be amused if he could see the papers on
my desk as I write all this, the mangled and disfigured pages,
the experimental arrangements of notes, the sheets of suggestions
balanced in constellations, the blottesque intellectual
battlegrounds over which I have been fighting.  I find this
account of my relations to Beatrice quite the most difficult part
of my story to write.  I happen to be a very objective-minded
person, I forget my moods, and this was so much an affair of
moods.  And even such moods and emotions as I recall are very
difficult to convey.  To me it is about as difficult as
describing a taste or a scent.
<P>
Then the objective story is made up of little things that are
difficult to set in a proper order.  And love in an hysterical
passion, now high, now low, now exalted, and now intensely
physical.  No one has ever yet dared to tell a love story
completely, its alternations, its comings  and goings, its
debased moments, its hate.  The love stories we tell, tell only
the net consequence, the ruling effect....
<P>
How can I rescue from the past now the mystical quality of
Beatrice; my intense longing for her; the overwhelming,
irrational, formless desire?  How can I explain how intimately
that worship mingled with a high, impatient resolve to make her
mine, to take her by strength and courage, to do my loving in a
violent heroic manner?  And then the doubts, the puzzled arrest
at the fact of her fluctuations, at her refusal to marry me, at
the fact that even when at last she returned to Bedley Corner she
seemed to evade me?
<P>
That exasperated me and perplexed me beyond measure.
<P>
I felt that it was treachery.  I thought of every conceivable
explanation, and the most exalted and romantic confidence in her
did not simply alternate, but mingled with the basest misgivings.
<P>
And into the tangle of memories comes the figure of Carnaby,
coming out slowly from the background to a position of
significance, as an influence, as a predominant strand in the
nets that kept us apart, as a rival.  What were the forces that
pulled her away from me when it was so clearly manifest she loved
me?  Did she think of marrying him?  Had I invaded some
long-planned scheme?  It was evident he did not like me, that in
some way I spoilt the world for him.  She returned to Bedley
Corner, and for some weeks she was flitting about me, and never
once could I have talk with her alone.  When she came to my sheds
Carnaby was always with her, jealously observant.  (Why the devil
couldn't she send him about his business?) The days slipped by
and my anger gathered.
<P>
All this mingles with the making of Lord Roberts B.  I had
resolved upon that one night as I lay awake at Bedley Corner; I
got it planned out before the bandages were off my face.  I
conceived this second navigable balloon in a grandiose manner. 
It was to be a second Lord Roberts A, only more so; it was to be
three times as big, large enough to carry three men, and it was
to be an altogether triumphant vindication of my claims upon the
air.  The framework was to be hollow like a bird's bones,
airtight, and the air pumped in or out, and the weight of fuel I
carried changed.  I talked much and boasted to Cothope--whom I
suspected of scepticisms  about this new type--of what it would
do, and it progressed--slowly.  It progressed slowly because I
was restless and uncertain.  At times I would go away to London
to snatch some chance of seeing Beatrice there, at times nothing
but a day of gliding and hard and dangerous exercise would
satisfy me.  And now in the newspapers, in conversation, in
everything about me, arose a new invader of my mental states. 
Something was happening to the great schemes of my uncle's
affairs; people were beginning to doubt, to question.  It was the
first quiver of his tremendous insecurity, the first wobble of
that gigantic credit top he had kept spinning so long.
<P>
There were comings and goings, November and December slipped by. 
I had two unsatisfactory meetings with Beatrice, meetings that
had no privacy--in which we said things of the sort that need
atmosphere, baldly and furtively.  I wrote to her several times
and she wrote back notes that I would sometimes respond to
altogether, sometimes condemn as insincere evasions.  "You don't
understand.  I can't just now explain.  Be patient with me. 
Leave things a little while to me."  She wrote.
<P>
I would talk aloud to these notes and wrangle over them in my
workroom--while the plans of Lord Roberts B waited.
<P>
"You don't give me a chance!" I would say.  "Why don't you let me
know the secret?  That's what I'm for--to settle difficulties! 
to tell difficulties to!" 
<P>
And at last I could hold out no longer against these accumulating
pressures.
<P>
I took an arrogant, outrageous line that left her no loopholes; I
behaved as though we were living in a melodrama.
<P>
"You must come and talk to me," I wrote, "or I will come and take
you.  I want you--and the time runs away."  
<P>
We met in a ride in the upper plantations.  It must have been
early in January, for there was snow on the ground and on the
branches of the trees.  We walked to and fro for an hour or more,
and from the first I pitched the key high in romance and made
understandings impossible.  It was our worst time together.  I
boasted like an actor, and she, I know not why, was tired and
spiritless.
<P>
Now I think over that talk in the light of all that has happened
since, I can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal I
was too foolish to let her make.  I don't know.  I confess I have
never completely understood Beatrice.  I confess I am still
perplexed at many things she said and did.  That afternoon,
anyhow, I was impossible.  I posed and scolded. I was--I said
it--for "taking the Universe by the throat!" 
<P>
"If it was only that," she said, but though I heard, I did not
heed her.
<P>
At last she gave way to me and talked no more.  Instead she
looked at me--as a thing beyond her controlling, but none the
less interesting--much as she had looked at me from behind the
skirts of Lady Drew in the Warren when we were children together.
<P>
Once even I thought she smiled faintly.
<P>
"What are the difficulties" I cried.  "there's no difficulty I
will not overcome for you!  Do your people think I'm no equal for
you?  Who says it?  My dear, tell me to win a title!  I'll do it
in five years!...
<P>
"Here am I just grown a man at the sight of you. I have wanted
something to fight for.  Let me fight for you!...
<P>
"I'm rich without intending it.  Let me mean it, give me an
honourable excuse for it, and I'll put all this rotten old Warren
of England at your feet!" 
<P>
I said such things as that.  I write them down here in all their
resounding base pride.  I said these empty and foolish things,
and they are part of me.  Why should I still cling to pride and
be ashamed?  I shouted her down.
<P>
I passed from such megalomania to petty accusations.
<P>
"You think Carnaby is a better man than I?" I said.
<P>
"No!" she cried, stung to speech.  "No!" 
<P>
"You think we're unsubstantial.  You've listened to all these
rumours Boom has started because we talked of a newspaper of our
own.  When you are with me you know I'm a man; when you get away
from me you think I'm a cheat and a cad....  There's not a word
of truth in the things they say about us.  I've been slack.  I've
left things.  But we have only to exert ourselves.  You do not
know how wide and far we have spread our nets.  Even now we have
a coup--an expedition--in hand.  It will put us on a footing."...
<P>
Her eyes asked mutely and asked in vain that I would cease to
boast of the very qualities she admired in me.
<P>
In the night I could not sleep for thinking of that talk and the
vulgar things I had said in it.  I could not understand the drift
my mind had taken.  I was acutely disgusted.  And my unwonted
doubts about myself spread from a merely personal discontent to
our financial position.  It was all very well to talk as I had
done of wealth and power and peerages, but what did I know
nowadays of my uncle's position?  Suppose in the midst of such
boasting and confidence there came some turn I did not suspect,
some rottenness he had concealed from me?  I resolved I had been
playing with aeronautics long enough; that next morning I would
go to him and have things clear between us.
<P>
I caught an early train and went up to the Hardingham.
<P>
I went up to the Hardingham through a dense London fog to see how
things really stood.  Before I had talked to my uncle for ten
minutes I felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak,
inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream.
