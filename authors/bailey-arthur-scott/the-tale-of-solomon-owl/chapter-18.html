<p>It proved to be just as Solomon Owl had told his cousin, Simon Screecher.
Solomon had so much on his mind that he had no sooner fallen asleep than
he awoke again, to study over the question that perplexed him. He
certainly did not want Simon to have twice as many mice as he. But Simon’s
argument was a good one. He had said that since Solomon was more than
twice his size, it was proper that he should have a chance to grow. And
everybody knew—Solomon reflected—everybody knew that <u>eating</u> made one
larger.
</p>
<p>The longer Solomon pondered, the farther he seemed from any answer that he
liked. And he had begun to fear that he would not succeed in getting more
than thirty-nine winks all day—instead of forty—when all at once an idea
came into his mind.
</p><p>Solomon knew right away that he had nothing more to worry about. He
dropped into a sound sleep with a pleasant smile upon his usually solemn
face. And when he opened his eyes again it was time for Simon Screecher to
arrive.
</p><p>Yes! Solomon could hear his cousin’s whistle even then. So he hurried to
his door; and there was Simon, sitting on a limb of the big hemlock
waiting for him!
</p><p>“It’s all right!” said Solomon to his cousin. “I agree to your suggestion.
We’ll hunt together again to-night; and if you will give me one-third of
all the mice you catch, I promise to give you two-thirds of all the mice
that I capture.”
</p><p>“Good!” said Simon Screecher. And he looked vastly relieved. “Just hoot
when you have any mice for me!”
</p><p>“Whistle when you have any for me!” Solomon Owl replied.
</p><p>And at that they started out for their night’s sport. It was not long
before Simon Screecher’s well known whistle brought Solomon hurrying to
him. Simon already had three mice, one of which he gave to Solomon,
according to their agreement.
</p><p>That same thing happened several times; until at last Simon Screecher
began to grumble.
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” he asked his cousin. “You are not hooting, as you
promised you would.”
</p><p>“But I haven’t caught any mice yet!” Solomon Owl replied.
</p><p>                            [<u>Illustration 3</u>]
</p><p>                      “It’s All Right,” Said Solomon
</p>
<p>Again and again and again Simon’s call summoned Solomon. But not once did
Solomon’s summon Simon. And all the time Simon Screecher grew more
discontented. Toward the end of the night he declared flatly that he
wasn’t going to hunt any more with his cousin.
</p><p>“I’ve done exactly as I agreed!” Solomon Owl protested.
</p><p>“You’re altogether too slow and clumsy,” Simon Screecher told him bluntly.
“If I’m going to hunt with anybody after this I’m going to choose someone
that’s as spry as I am. There’s no sense in my working for you. Here I’ve
toiled all night long and I’m still hungry, for I’ve given you a third of
my food.”
</p><p>They parted then—and none too pleasantly.
</p><p>In Simon’s whistle, as he flew away toward his home, there was
unmistakable anger. But Solomon Owl’s answering hoots—while they were not
exactly sweet—seemed to carry more than a hint of laughter.
</p><p>One would naturally think that Solomon might have been even hungrier than
his small cousin. But it was not so. He had had more to eat than usual;
for he had been very busy catching locusts and katydids—and frogs, too.
Solomon Owl had not tried to catch a single mouse that night.
</p><p>You know now the idea that had come to him while he was lying awake in his
house during the daytime. He had made up his mind that he would not hunt
for <u>mice</u>. And since he had not promised Simon to give him anything else,
there was no reason why he should not eat all the frogs and katydids and
locusts that he could find.
</p><p>Perhaps it was not surprising that Simon Screecher never guessed the
truth. But he seemed to know that there was something queer about that
night’s hunting, for he never came to Solomon Owl’s house again.
