<p>As long as she could remember she had been permitted to play
with the contents of the late Herr Conrad Wilner's wonder-box.
The programme on such occasions varied little; the child was permitted
to rummage among the treasures in the box until she had satisfied
her perennial curiosity; conversation with her absent-minded father
ensued, which ultimately included a personal narrative, dragged
out piecemeal from the reticent, dreamy invalid. Then always a
few pages of the diary kept by the late Herr Wilner were read
as a bedtime story. And bath and bed and dreamland followed. That
was the invariable routine, now once more in full swing.</p>

<p>Her father lay on his invalid's chair, reading; his rubber-shod
crutches rested against the wall, within easy reach. By him, beside
the kerosene lamp, her mother sat, mending her child's stockings
and underwear.</p>

<p>Outside the circle of lamplight the incandescent eyes of the
stove glowed steadily through the semi-dusk; and the child, always
fascinated by anything that aroused her imagination, lifted her
gaze furtively from time to time to convince herself that it really
was the big, familiar stove which glared redly back at her, and
not a dragon into which her creative fancy had so often transformed
it.</p>

<p>Reassured, she continued to explore the contents of the wonder-box&mdash;a
toy she preferred to her doll, but not to her beloved set of water-colours
and crayon pencils.</p>

<p>Some centuries ago Pandora's box let loose a world of troubles;
Herr Wilner's box apparently contained only pleasure for a little
child whose pleasures were mostly of her own invention.</p>

<p>It was a curious old box, made of olive wood and bound with bands
of some lacquered silvery metal to make it strong&mdash;rupee silver,
perhaps&mdash;strangely wrought with Arabic characters engraved and
in shallow relief. It had handles on either side, like a sea-chest;
a silver-lacquered lock and hasp which retained traces of violent
usage; and six heavy strap hinges of the same lacquered metal.</p>

<p>Within it the little child knew that a most fascinating collection
of articles was to be discovered, taken out one by one with greatest
care, played with discreetly, and, at her mother's command, returned
to their several places in Herr Wilner's box.</p>

<p>There were, in this box, two rather murderous-looking Kurdish
daggers in sheaths of fretted silver&mdash;never to be unsheathed,
it was solemnly understood, except by the child's father.</p>

<p>There was a pair of German army revolvers of the pattern of 1900,
the unexploded cartridges of which had long since been extracted
and cautiously thrown into the mill pond by the child's mother,
much to the surprise, no doubt, of the pickerel and sunfish.</p>

<p>There were writing materials of sandalwood, a few sea shells,
a dozen books in German with many steel plate engravings; also
a red Turkish fez with a dark blue tassel; two pairs of gold-rimmed
spectacles; several tobacco pipes of Dresden porcelain, a case
full of instruments for mechanical drawing, a thick blank book
bound in calf and containing the diary of the late Herr Wilner
down to within a few minutes before his death.</p>

<p>Also there was a figure in bronze, encrusted with tarnished gold
and faded traces of polychrome decoration.</p>

<p>Erlik, the Yellow Devil, as Herr Wilner called it, seemed too
heavy to be a hollow casting, and yet, when shaken, something
within rattled faintly, as though when the molten metal was cooling
a fissure formed inside, into which a few loose fragments of bronze
had fallen.</p>

<p>It apparently had not been made to represent any benign Chinese
god; the aspect of the yellow figure was anything but benevolent.
The features were terrific; scowls infested its grotesque countenance;
threatening brows bent inward; angry eyes rolled in apparent fury;
its double gesture with sword and javelin was violent and almost
humorously menacing. And Ruhannah adored it.</p>

<p>For a little while the child played her usual game of frightening
her doll with the Yellow Devil and then rescuing her by the aid
of a fairy prince which she herself had designed, smeared with
water-colours, and cut out with scissors from a piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>After a time she turned to the remaining treasures in the wonder-box.
These consisted of several volumes containing photographs, others
full of sketches in pencil and water-colour, and a thick roll
of glazed linen scrolls covered with designs in India ink.</p>

<p>The photographs were of all sorts&mdash;landscapes, rivers, ships
in dock, dry dock, and at sea; lighthouses, forts, horses carrying
soldiers armed with lances and wearing the red fez; artillery
on the march, infantry, groups of officers, all wearing the same
sort of fez which lay there in Herr Wilner's box of olive wood.</p>

<p>There were drawings, too&mdash;sketches of cannon, of rifles, of swords;
drawings of soldiers in various gay uniforms, all carefully coloured
by hand. There were pictures of ships, from the sterns of which
the crescent flag floated lazily; sketches of great, ugly-looking
objects which her father explained were Turkish ironclads. The
name "ironclad" always sounded menacing and formidable to the
child, and the forbidding pictures fascinated her.</p>

<p>Then there were scores and scores of scrolls made out of slippery
white linen, on which had been drawn all sorts of most amazing
geometrical designs in ink.</p>

<p>"Plans," her father explained vaguely. And, when pressed by reiterated
questions: "Plans for military works, I believe&mdash;forts, docks,
barracks, fortified cuts and bridges. You are not yet quite old
enough to understand, Ruhannah."</p>

<p>"Who did draw them, daddy?"</p>

<p>"A German friend of mine, Herr Conrad Wilner."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I think his master sent him to Turkey to make those pictures."</p>

<p>"For the Sultan?"</p>

<p>"No; for his Emperor."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know, Rue."</p>

<p>At this stage of the conversation her father usually laid aside
his book and composed himself for the inevitable narrative soon
to be demanded of him.</p>

<p>Then, although having heard the story many times from her crippled
father's lips, but never weary of the repetition, the child's
eyes would grow round and very solemn in preparation for her next
and inevitable question:</p>

<p>"And did Herr Wilner <em>die</em>, daddy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well, it was when I was a missionary in the Trebizond district,
and your mother and I went&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And <em>me</em>, daddy? And <em>me</em>, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes; you were a little baby in arms. And we all went to Gallipoli
to attend the opening of a beautiful new school which was built
for little Mohammedan converts to Christianity&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did I see those little Christian children, daddy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you saw them. But you are too young to remember."</p>

<p>"Tell me. Don't stop!"</p>

<p>"Then listen attentively without interrupting, Rue: Your mother
and you and I went to Gallipoli; and my friend, Herr Wilner, who
had been staying with us at a town called Tchardak, came along
with us to attend the opening of the American school.</p>

<p>"And the night we arrived there was trouble. The Turkish people,
urged on by some bad officials in the Sanjak, came with guns and
swords and spears and set fire to the mission school.</p>

<p>"They did not offer to harm us. We had already collected our
converts and our personal baggage. Our caravan was starting. The
mob might not have done anything worse than burn the school if
Herr Wilner had not lost his temper and threatened them with a
dog whip. Then they killed him with stones, there in the walled
yard."</p>

<p>At this point in the tragedy, the eagerly awaited and ardently
desired shivers passed up and down the child's back.</p>

<p>"<em>O&mdash;</em>oh! Did they kill him <em>dead</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Was he a martyr?"</p>

<p>"In a way he was a martyr to his duty, I suppose. At least I
gather so from his diary and from what he once told me of his
life."</p>

<p>"And then what happened? Tell me, daddy."</p>

<p>"A Greek steamer took us and our baggage to Trebizond."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"And then, a year later, the terrible massacre at our Trebizond
mission occurred&#11834;"</p>

<p>That was what the child was waiting for.</p>

<p>"I know!" she interrupted eagerly. "The wicked Turks and the
cruel Kurds did come galloping and shouting 'Allah!' And all the
poor, converted people became martyrs. And God loves martyrs,
doesn't He?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And then they did kill all the poor little Christian children!"
exclaimed the child excitedly. "And they did cut you with swords
and guns! And then the kind sailors with the American flag took
you and mamma and me to a ship and saved us by the grace of our
Lord Jesus!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tell me!"</p>

<p>"That is all&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No; you walk on two crutches, and you cannot be a missionary
any more because you are sick all the time! Tell me, daddy!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And that is all, Rue&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Please! Tell me!... And then, don't you remember how
the brave British sailors and our brave American sailors pointed
their cannon at the <em>I</em>-ronclads, and they said, 'Do not
shoot or we shall shoot you to pieces.' And then the brave American
sailors went on shore and brought back some poor little wounded
converted children, and your baggage and the magic box of Herr
Wilner!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. And now that is enough tonight&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, daddy, you must first read in the di-a-ry which Herr Wilner
made!"</p>

<p>"Bring me the book, Rue."</p>

<p>With an interest forever new, the Carew family prepared to listen
to the words written by a strange man who had died only a few
moments after he had made the last entry in the book&mdash;before even
the ink was entirely dry on the pages.</p>

<p>The child, sitting cross-legged on the floor, clasped her little
hands tightly; her mother laid aside her sewing, folded it, and
placed it in her lap; her father searched through the pencilled
translation which he had written in between the lines of German
script, found where he had left off the time before, then continued
the diary of Herr Conrad Wilner, deceased:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>March 3.</em> My original plans have been sent to the Yildiz Palace.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My duplicates are to go to Berlin when a messenger from our<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embassy arrives. Murad Bey knows this. I am sorry he knows it. But<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nobody except myself is aware that I have a third set of plans<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully hidden.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 4.</em> All day with Murad's men setting wire entanglements<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under water; two Turkish destroyers patrolling the entrance to the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bay, and cavalry patrols on the heights to warn away the curious.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 6.</em> Forts Alamout and Shah Abbas are being reconstructed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the new plans. Wired areas under water and along the coves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shoals are being plotted. Murad Bey is unusually polite and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effusive, conversing with me in German and French. A spidery man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and very dangerous.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 7.</em> A strange and tragic affair last night. The heat being<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;severe, I left my tent about midnight and went down to the dock<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where my little sailboat lay, with the object of cooling myself on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water. There was a hot land breeze; I sailed out into the bay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cruised north along the coves which I have wired. As I rounded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little rocky point I was surprised to see in the moonlight, very<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near, a steam yacht at anchor, carrying no lights. The longer I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked at her the more certain I became that I was gazing at the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial yacht. I had no idea what the yacht might be doing here;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran my sailboat close under the overhanging rocks and anchored.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw a small boat in the moonlight, pulling from the yacht<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward shore, where the crescent cove had already been thoroughly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staked and the bottom closely covered with barbed wire as far as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the edge of the deep channel which curves in here like a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scimitar.

</p>
<p>
It must have been that the people in the boat miscalculated the<br/>
location of the channel, for they were well over the sunken barbed<br/>
wire when they lifted and threw overboard what they had come there<br/>
to get rid of&mdash;two dark bulks that splashed.

</p>
<p>
I watched the boat pull back to the Imperial yacht. A little later<br/>
the yacht weighed anchor and steamed northward, burning no lights.<br/>
Only the red reflection tingeing the smoke from her stacks was<br/>
visible. I watched her until she was lost in the moonlight,<br/>
thinking all the while of those weighted sacks so often dropped<br/>
overboard along the Bosporus and off Seraglio Point from that same<br/>
Imperial yacht.

</p>
<p>
When the steamer had disappeared, I got out my sweeps and rowed<br/>
for the place where the dark objects had been dropped overboard. I<br/>
knew that they must be resting somewhere on the closely<br/>
criss-crossed mesh of wires just below the surface of the water;<br/>
but I probed for an hour before I located anything. Another hour<br/>
passed in trying to hook into the object with the little<br/>
three-fluked grapnel which I used as an anchor. I got hold of<br/>
something finally; a heavy chest of olive wood bound with metal;<br/>
but I had to rig a tackle before I could hoist it aboard.

</p>
<p>
Then I cast out again; and very soon my grapnel hooked into what I<br/>
expected&mdash;a canvas sack, weighted with a round shot. When I got it<br/>
aboard, I hesitated a long while before opening it. Finally I made<br/>
a long slit in the canvas with my knife....

</p>
<p>
She was very young&mdash;not over sixteen, I think, and she was really<br/>
beautiful, even under her wet, dark hair. She seemed to be a<br/>
Caucasian girl&mdash;maybe a Georgian. She wore a small gold cross<br/>
which hung from a gold cord around her neck. There was another,<br/>
and tighter, cord around her neck, too. I cut the silk bowstring<br/>
and closed and bound her eyes with my handkerchief before I rowed<br/>
out a little farther and lowered her into the deep channel which<br/>
cuts eastward here like the scimitar of that true believer, Abdul<br/>
Hamid.

</p>
<p>
Then I hoisted sail and beat up slowly toward my little dock under<br/>
a moon which had become ghastly under the pallid aura of a<br/>
gathering storm&#11834;

</p>
</div>
<p>"A poor dead young lady!" interrupted the child, clasping her
hands more tightly. "Did the Sultan kill her, daddy?"</p>

<p>"It seems so, Ruhannah."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He was a very cruel and wicked Sultan."</p>

<p>"I don't see why he killed the beautiful poor dead lady."</p>

<p>"If you will listen and not interrupt, you shall learn why."</p>

<p>"And was the chest that Herr Wilner pulled up the very same chest
that is here on the floor beside me?" insisted the child.</p>

<p>"The very same. Now listen, Rue, and I shall read a little more
in Herr Wilner's diary, and then you must have your bath and be
put to bed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please read, daddy!"</p>

<p>The Reverend Wilbour Carew turned the page and quietly continued:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>March 20.</em> In my own quarters at Trebizond again, and rid of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murad for a while.

</p>
<p>
A canvas cover and rope handles concealed the character of my<br/>
olive wood chest. I do not believe anybody suspects it to be<br/>
anything except one of the various boxes containing my own<br/>
personal effects. I shall open it tonight with a file and chisel,<br/>
if possible.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 21.</em> The contents of the chest reveal something of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tragedy. The box is full of letters written in Russian, and full<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of stones which weigh collectively a hundred pounds at least.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing else in the chest except a broken Ikon and a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bronze figure of Erlik, a Yildiz relic, no doubt, of some Kurdish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raid into Mongolia, and probably placed beside the dead girl by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her murderers in derision. I am translating the letters and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arranging them in sequence.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 25.</em> I have translated the letters. The dead girl's name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was evidently Tatyana, one of several children of some Cossack<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief or petty prince, and on the eve of her marriage to a young<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;officer named Mitya the Kurds raided the town. They carried poor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatyana off along with her wedding chest&mdash;the chest fished up with<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my grapnel.

</p>
<p>
In brief, the chest and the girl found their way into Abdul's<br/>
seraglio. The letters of the dead girl&mdash;which were written and<br/>
entrusted probably to a faithless slave, but which evidently never<br/>
left the seraglio&mdash;throw some light on the tragedy, for they<br/>
breathe indignation and contempt of Islam, and call on her<br/>
affianced, on her parents, and on her people to rescue her and<br/>
avenge her.

</p>
<p>
And after a while, no doubt Abdul tired of reading fierce,<br/>
unreconciled little Tatyana's stolen letters, and simply ended the<br/>
matter by having her bowstrung and dumped overboard in a sack,<br/>
together with her marriage chest, her letters, and the Yellow<br/>
Devil in bronze as a final insult.

</p>
<p>
She seems to have had a sister, Naïa, thirteen years old,<br/>
betrothed to a Prince Mistchenka, a cavalry officer in the Terek<br/>
Cossacks. Her father had been Hetman of the Don Cossacks before<br/>
the Emperor Nicholas reserved that title for Imperial use. And<br/>
<em>she</em> ended in a sack off Gallipoli! That is the story of Tatyana<br/>
and her wedding chest.

</p>
<p>
<em>March 29.</em> Murad arrived, murderously bland and assiduous in his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solicitude for my health and comfort. I am almost positive he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knows that I fished up something from Cove No. 37 under the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theoretical guns of theoretical Fort Osman, both long plotted out<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but long delayed.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 5.</em> My duplicate plans for Gallipoli have been stolen. I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a third set still. Colonel Murad Bey is not to be trusted. My<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position is awkward and is becoming serious. There is no faith to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be placed in Abdul Hamid. My credentials, the secret agreement<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my Government, are no longer regarded even with toleration in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Yildiz Kiosque. A hundred insignificant incidents prove it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every day. And if Abdul dare not break with Germany it is only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he is not yet ready to defy the Young Turk party. The<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Embassy is very active and bothers me a great deal.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 10.</em> My secret correspondence with Enver Bey has been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered, and my letters opened. This is a very bad business. I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have notified my Government that the Turkish Government does not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want me here; that the plan of a Germanised Turkish army is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becoming objectionable to the Porte; that the duplicate plans of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our engineers for the Dardanelles and the Gallipoli Peninsula have<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been stolen.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 13.</em> A secret interview with Enver Bey, who promises that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our ideas shall be carried out when his party comes into power.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently he does not know that my duplicates have been stolen.

</p>
<p>
Troubles threaten in the Vilayet of Trebizond, where is an<br/>
American Mission. I fear that our emissaries and the emissaries of<br/>
Enver Bey are deliberately fomenting disorders because Americans<br/>
are not desired by our Government. Enver denies this; but it is<br/>
idle to believe anyone in this country.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 16.</em> Another interview with Enver Bey. His scheme is flatly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revolutionary, namely, the deposition of Abdul, a secret alliance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offensive and defensive, with us; the Germanisation of the Turkish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;army and navy; the fortification of the Gallipoli district<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to our plans; a steadily increasing pressure on Serbia;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a final reckoning with Russia which is definitely to settle the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status of Albania and Serbia and leave the Balkan grouping to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;settled between Austria, Germany, and Turkey.

</p>
<p>
I spoke several times about India and Egypt, but he does not<br/>
desire to arouse England unless she interferes.

</p>
<p>
I spoke also of Abdul Hamid's secret and growing fear of Germany,<br/>
and his increasing inclination toward England once more.

</p>
<p>
No trace of my stolen plans. The originals are in the Yildiz<br/>
Palace. I have a third set secreted, about which nobody knows.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 21.</em> I have been summoned to the Yildiz Palace. It possibly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means my assassination. I have confided my box of data,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;photographs, and plans, to the Reverend Wilbour Carew, an American<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missionary in the Trebizond sanjak.

</p>
<p>
There are rumours that Abdul has become mentally unhinged through<br/>
dread of assassination. One of his own aides-de-camp, while being<br/>
granted an audience in the Yildiz, made a sudden and abrupt<br/>
movement to find his handkerchief; and Abdul Hamid whipped out a<br/>
pistol and shot him dead. This is authentic.

</p>
<p>
<em>April 30.</em> Back at Tchardak with my good missionary and his wife.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange interview with Abdul. There were twenty French clocks in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the room, all going and all striking at various intervals. The<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walls were set with French mirrors.

</p>
<p>
Abdul's cordiality was terrifying; the full original set of my<br/>
Gallipoli plans was brought in. After a while, the Sultan reminded<br/>
me that the plans were in duplicate, and asked me where were these<br/>
duplicates. What duplicity! But I said pleasantly that they were<br/>
to be sent to General Staff Headquarters in Berlin.

</p>
<p>
He pretended to understand that this was contrary to the<br/>
agreement, and insisted that the plans should first be sent to him<br/>
for comparison. I merely referred him to his agreement with my<br/>
Government. But all the while we were talking I was absolutely<br/>
convinced that the stolen duplicates were at that moment in the<br/>
Yildiz Kiosque. Abdul must have known that I believed it. Yet we<br/>
both merely smiled our confidence in each other.

</p>
<p>
He seemed to be unusually good-natured and gracious, saying that<br/>
no doubt I was quite right in sending the plans to Berlin. He<br/>
spoke of Enver Bey cordially, and said he hoped to be reconciled<br/>
to him and his friends very soon. When Abdul Hamid becomes<br/>
reconciled to anybody who disagrees with him, the latter is<br/>
<em>always</em> dead.

</p>
<p>
He asked me where I was going. I told him about the plans I was<br/>
preparing for the Trebizond district. He offered me an escort of<br/>
Kurdish cavalry, saying that he had been told the district was not<br/>
very safe. I thanked him and declined his escort of assassins.

</p>
<p>
I saw it all very plainly. Like a pirate captain, Abdul orders his<br/>
crew to dig a secret hole for his treasure, and when the hole is<br/>
dug and the treasure hidden, he murders the men who hid it for<br/>
him, so that they shall never betray its location. I am one of<br/>
those men. That is what he means for me, who have given him his<br/>
Gallipoli plans. No wonder that in England they call him Abdul the<br/>
Damned!

</p>
<p>
<em>May 3.</em> In the Bazaar at Tchardak yesterday two men tried to stab<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me. I got their daggers, but they escaped in the confusion. Murad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called to express horror and regret. Yes; regret that I had not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been murdered.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 5.</em> I have written to my Government that my usefulness here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems to be ended; that my life is in hourly danger; that I desire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be more thoroughly informed concerning the relations between<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berlin and the Yildiz Palace.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 6.</em> I am in disgrace. My Government is furious because my<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correspondence with Enver Bey has been stolen. The Porte has<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complained about me to Berlin; Berlin disowns me, disclaims all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of my political activities outside of my engineering<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work.

</p>
<p>
This is what failure to carry out secret instructions invariably<br/>
brings&mdash;desertion by the Government from which such instructions<br/>
are received. In diplomacy, failure is a crime never forgiven.<br/>
Abandoned by my Government I am now little better than an outlaw<br/>
here. Two courses remain open to me&mdash;to go back in disgrace and<br/>
live obscurely for the remainder of my life, or to risk my life by<br/>
hanging on desperately here with an almost hopeless possibility<br/>
before me of accomplishing something to serve my Government and<br/>
rehabilitate myself.

</p>
<p>
The matter of the stolen plans is being taken up by our Ambassador<br/>
at the Sublime Porte. The British Embassy is suspected. What<br/>
folly! I possess a third set of plans. Our Embassy ought to send<br/>
to Trebizond for them. I don't know what to do.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 12.</em> A letter I wrote May 10 to the German Embassy has been<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stolen. I am now greatly worried about the third set of plans. It<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems safest to include the box containing them among the baggage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the American missionary, the Reverend Wilbour Carew; and, too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me to seek shelter with him.

</p>
<p>
As I am now afraid that an enemy may impersonate an official of<br/>
the German Embassy, I have the missionary's promise that he will<br/>
retain and conceal the contents of my box until I instruct him<br/>
otherwise. I am practically in hiding at his house, and in actual<br/>
fear of my life.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 15.</em> The missionary and his wife and baby travel to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallipoli, where an American school for girls is about to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened.

</p>
<p>
Today, in a café, I noticed that the flies, swarming on the edge<br/>
of my coffee cup, fell into the saucer dead. I did not taste my<br/>
coffee.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 16.</em> Last night a shot was fired through my door. I have<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided to travel to Gallipoli with the missionary.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 18.</em> My groom stole and ate an orange from my breakfast tray.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is dead.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 20.</em> The Reverend Mr. Carew and his wife are most kind and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sympathetic. They are good people, simple, kindly, brave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faithful, and fearlessly devoted to God's service in this vile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of treachery and lies.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 21.</em> I have confessed to the Reverend Mr. Carew as I would<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confess to a priest in holy orders. I have told him all under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pledge of secrecy. I told him also that the sanctuary he offers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be violated with evil consequences to him; and that I would<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travel as far as Gallipoli with him and then leave. But the kind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courageous missionary and his wife insist that I remain under the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protection which he says the flag of his country affords me. If I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could only get my third set of plans out of the country!

</p>
<p>
<em>May 22.</em> Today my coffee was again poisoned. I don't know what<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevented me from tasting it&mdash;some vague premonition. A pariah dog<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ate the bread I soaked in it, and died before he could yelp.

</p>
<p>
It looks to me as though my end were inevitable. Today I gave my<br/>
bronze figure of Erlik, the Yellow Devil, to Mrs. Carew to keep as<br/>
a dowry for her little daughter, now a baby in arms. If it is<br/>
hollow, as I feel sure, there are certain to be one or two jewels<br/>
in it. And the figure itself might bring five hundred marks at an<br/>
antiquary's.

</p>
<p>
<em>May 30.</em> Arrived at the Gallipoli mission. Three Turkish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ironclads lying close inshore. A British cruiser, the <em>Cobra</em>, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an American cruiser, the <em>Oneida</em>, appeared about sunset and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anchored near the ironclads. The bugles on deck were plainly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audible. If a German warship appears I shall carry my box on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;board. My only chance to rehabilitate myself is to get the third<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set of plans to Berlin.

</p>
<p>
<em>June 1.</em> In the middle of the religious exercises with which the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new school is being inaugurated, cries of "Allah" come from a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great crowd which has gathered. From my window where I am writing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see how insolent the attitude of this Mohammedan riffraff is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becoming. They spit upon the ground&mdash;a pebble is tossed at a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convert&mdash;a sudden shout of "Allah"&mdash;pushing and jostling&mdash;a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lighted torch blazes! I take my whip of rhinoceros hide and go<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down into the court to put a stop to this insolence&#11834;

</p>

<p>Her father slowly closed the book.</p>

<p>"Daddy! Is that where poor Herr Wilner died?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>After a silence his wife said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"I have always considered it very strange that the German Government
did not send for Herr Wilner's papers."</p>

<p>"Probably they did, Mary. And very probably Murad Bey told them
that the papers had been destroyed."</p>

<p>"And you never believed it to be your duty to send the papers
to the German Government?"</p>

<p>"No. It was an unholy alliance that Germany sought with that
monster Abdul. And when Enver Pasha seized the reins of government
such an alliance would have been none the less unholy. You know
and so do I that if Germany did not actually incite the Armenian
massacres she at least was cognisant of preparations made to begin
them. Germany is still hostile to all British or American missions,
all Anglo-Saxon influence in Turkey.</p>

<p>"No; I did not send Herr Wilner's papers to Berlin; and the events
of the last fifteen years have demonstrated that I was right in
withholding them."</p>

<p>His wife nodded, laid aside her work basket, and rose.</p>

<p>"Come, Ruhannah," she said with decision; "put everything back
into the wonder-box."</p>

<p>And, stooping, she lifted and laid away in it the scowling, menacing
Yellow Devil.</p>

<p>And so, every month or two, the wonder-box was opened for the
child to play with, the same story told, extracts from the diary
read; but these ceremonies, after a while, began to recur at lengthening
intervals as the years passed and the child grew older.</p>

<p>And finally it was left to her to open the box when she desired,
and to read for herself the pencilled translation of the diary,
which her father had made during some of the idle and trying moments
of his isolated and restricted life. And, when she had been going
to school for some years, other and more vivid interests replaced
her dolls and her wonder-box; but not her beloved case of water-colours
and crayon pencils.</p>
