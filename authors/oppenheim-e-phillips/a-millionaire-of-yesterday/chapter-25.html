On the summit of a little knoll, with a pipe between his teeth and
his back against a palm-tree, Trent was lounging away an hour of
the breathless night.  Usually a sound sleeper, the wakefulness,
which had pursued him from the instant his head had touched his
travelling pillow an hour or so back, was not only an uncommon
occurrence, but one which seemed proof against any effort on his
part to overcome it.  So he had risen and stolen away from the
little camp where his companions lay wrapped in heavy slumber.  They
had closed their eyes in a dense and tropical darkness - so thick
indeed that they had lit a fire, notwithstanding the stifling heat,
to remove that vague feeling of oppression which chaos so complete
seemed to bring with it.  Its embers burnt now with a faint and
sickly glare in the full flood of yellow moonlight which had
fallen upon the country.  From this point of vantage Trent could
trace backwards their day's march for many miles, the white posts
left by the surveyor even were visible, and in the background rose
the mountains of Bekwando.  It had been a hard week's work for
Trent.  He had found chaos, discontent, despair.  The English agent
of the Bekwando Land Company was on the point of cancelling his
contract, the surveyors were spending valuable money without making
any real attempt to start upon their undoubtedly difficult task.
Everywhere the feeling seemed to be that the prosecution of his
schemes was an impossibility.  The road was altogether in the clouds.
Trent was flatly told that the labour they required was absolutely
unprocurable.  Fortunately Trent knew the country, and he was a man
of resource.  From the moment when he had appeared upon the spot,
things had begun to right themselves.  He had found Oom Sam
established as a sort of task-master and contractor, and had
promptly dismissed him, with the result that the supply of Kru boys
was instantly doubled.  He had found other sources of labour and
started them at once on clearing work, scornfully indifferent to the
often-expressed doubts of the English surveyor as to possibility of
making the road at all.  He had chosen overseers with that swift
and intuitive insight into character which in his case amounted
almost to genius.  With a half-sheet of notepaper and a pencil, he
had mapped out a road which had made one, at least, of the two
surveyors thoughtful, and had largely increased his respect for the
English capitalist.  Now he was on his way back from a tour almost
to Bekwando itself by the route of the proposed road.  Already the
work of preparation had begun.  Hundreds of natives left in their
track were sawing down palm-trees, cutting away the bush, digging
and making ready everywhere for that straight, wide thoroughfare
which was to lead from Bekwando village to the sea-coast.  Cables
as to his progress had already been sent back to London.  Apart from
any other result, Trent knew that he had saved the Syndicate a
fortune by his journey here.
<P>
The light of the moon grew stronger - the country lay stretched out
before him like a map.  With folded arms and a freshly-lit pipe
Trent leaned with his back against the tree and fixed eyes.  At
first he saw nothing but that road, broad and white, stretching to
the horizon and thronged with oxen-drawn wagons.  Then the fancy
suddenly left him and a girl's face seemed to be laughing into his
 - a face which was ever changing, gay and brilliant one moment,
calm and seductively beautiful the next.  He smoked his pipe
furiously, perplexed and uneasy.  One moment the face was Ernestine's,
the next it was Monty's little girl laughing up at him from the worn
and yellow tin-type.  The promise of the one - had it been fulfilled
in the woman?  At least he knew that here was the one great weakness
of his life.  The curious flood of sentiment, which had led him to
gamble for the child's picture, had merged with equal suddenness
into passion at the coming of her later presentment.  High above
all his plans for the accumulation of power and wealth, he set
before him now a desire which had become the moving impulse of his
life - a desire primitive but overmastering - the desire of a strong
man for the woman he loves.  In London he had scarcely dared admit
so much even to himself.  Here, in this vast solitude, he was more
master of himself - dreams which seemed to him the most beautiful
and the most daring which he had ever conceived, filled his brain
and stirred his senses till the blood in his veins seemed flowing
to a new and wonderful music.  Those were wonderful moments for him.
<P>
His pipe was nearly out, and a cooler breeze was stealing over the
plain.  After all, perhaps an hour or so's sleep would be possible
now.  He stretched himself and yawned, cast one more glance across
the moonlit plain, and then stood suddenly still, stiffened into an
attitude of breathless interest.  Yonder, between two lines of
shrubs, were moving bodies - men, footsore and weary, crawling
along with slow, painful movements; one at least of them was a
European, and even at that distance Trent could tell that they were
in grievous straits.  He felt for his revolver, and, finding that
it was in his belt, descended the hill quickly towards them.
<P>
With every step which he took he could distinguish them more
plainly.  There were five Kru boys, a native of a tribe which he
did not recognise, and a European who walked with reeling footsteps,
and who, it was easy to see, was on the point of exhaustion.  Soon
they saw him, and a feeble shout greeted his approach.  Trent was
within hailing distance before he recognised the European.  Then,
with a little exclamation of surprise, he saw that it was Captain
Francis.
<P>
They met face to face in a moment, but Francis never recognised him.
His eyes were bloodshot, a coarse beard disguised his face, and his
clothes hung about him in rags.  Evidently he was in a terrible
plight.  When he spoke his voice sounded shrill and cracked.
<P>
"We are starving men," he said; "can you help us?"
<P>
"Of course we can," Trent answered quickly.  "This way.  We've
plenty of stores."
<P>
The little party stumbled eagerly after him.  In a few moments they
were at the camp.  Trent roused his companions, packages were
hastily undone and a meal prepared.  Scarcely a word was said or a
question asked.  One or two of the Kru boys seemed on the verge of
insanity - Francis himself was hysterical and faint.  Trent boiled
a kettle and made some beef-tea himself.  The first mouthful Francis
was unable to swallow.  His throat had swollen and his eyes were
hideously bloodshot.  Trent, who had seen men before in dire straits,
fed him from a spoon and forced brandy between his lips.  Certainly,
at the time, he never stopped to consider that he was helping back
to life the man who in all the world was most likely to do him ill.
<P>
"Better?" he asked presently.
<P>
"Much.  What luck to find you.  What are you after - gold?"
<P>
Trent shook his head.
<P>
"Not at present.  We're planning out the new road from Attra to
Bekwando."
<P>
Francis looked up with surprise.
<P>
"Never heard of it," he said; "but there's trouble ahead for you.
They are dancing the war-dance at Bekwando, and the King has been
shut up for three days with the priest and never opened his mouth.
We were on our way from the interior, and relied upon them for food
and drink.  They've always been friendly, but this time we barely
escaped with our lives."
<P>
Trent's face grew serious.  This was bad news for him, and he was
thankful that they had not carried out their first plan and
commenced their prospecting at Bekwando village.
<P>
"We have a charter," he said, "and, if necessary, we must fight.
I'm glad to be prepared though."
<P>
"A charter!"  Francis pulled himself together and looked curiously
at the man who was still bending over him.
<P>
"Great Heavens!" he exclaimed, "why, you are Scarlett Trent, the
man whom I met with poor Villiers in Bekwando years ago."
<P>
Trent nodded.
<P>
"We waited for you," he said, "to witness our concession.  I thought
that you would remember."
<P>
"I thought," Francis said slowly, "that there was something familiar
about you....  I remember it all now.  You were gambling with poor
old Monty for his daughter's picture against a bottle of brandy."
<P>
Trent winced a little.
<P>
"You have an excellent memory," he said drily.
<P>
Francis raised himself a little, and a fiercer note crept into his
tone.
<P>
"It is coming back to me," he said.  "I remember more about you now,
Scarlett Trent.  You are the man who left his partner to die in a
jungle, that you might rob him of his share in the concession.  Oh
yes, you see my memory is coming back!  I have an account against
you, my man."
<P>
"It's a lie!" said Trent passionately.  "When I left him, I honestly
believed him to be a dead man."
<P>
<P>
"How many people will believe that?" Francis scoffed.  "I shall
take Monty with me to England.  I have finished with this country
for awhile - and then - and then - "
<P>
He was exhausted, and sank back speechless.  Trent sat and watched
him, smoking in thoughtful silence.  They two were a little apart
from the others, and Francis was fainting.  A hand upon his throat
 - a drop from that phial in the medicine-chest - and his faint
would carry him into eternity.  And still Trent sat and smoked.
