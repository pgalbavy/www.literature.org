<p>While the feet of the Prince continued to run swiftly, his heart, which
had at first by far outstripped his running, soon began to linger and
hang back.  Not that he ceased to pity the misfortune or to yearn for the
sight of Seraphina; but the memory of her obdurate coldness awoke within
him, and woke in turn his own habitual diffidence of self.  Had Sir John
been given time to tell him all, had he even known that she was speeding
to the Felsenburg, he would have gone to her with ardour.  As it was, he
began to see himself once more intruding, profiting, perhaps, by her
misfortune, and now that she was fallen, proffering unloved caresses to
the wife who had spurned him in prosperity.  The sore spots upon his
vanity began to burn; once more, his anger assumed the carriage of a
hostile generosity; he would utterly forgive indeed; he would help, save,
and comfort his unloving wife; but all with distant self-denial, imposing
silence on his heart, respecting Seraphina’s disaffection as he would the
innocence of a child.  So, when at length he turned a corner and beheld
the Princess, it was his first thought to reassure her of the purity of
his respect, and he at once ceased running and stood still.  She, upon
her part, began to run to him with a little cry; then, seeing him pause,
she paused also, smitten with remorse; and at length, with the most
guilty timidity, walked nearly up to where he stood.
</p>
<p>‘Otto,’ she said, ‘I have ruined all!’
</p><p>‘Seraphina!’ he cried with a sob, but did not move, partly withheld by
his resolutions, partly struck stupid at the sight of her weariness and
disorder.  Had she stood silent, they had soon been locked in an embrace.
But she too had prepared herself against the interview, and must spoil
the golden hour with protestations.
</p><p>‘All!’ she went on, ‘I have ruined all!  But, Otto, in kindness you must
hear me—not justify, but own, my faults.  I have been taught so cruelly;
I have had such time for thought, and see the world so changed.  I have
been blind, stone-blind; I have let all true good go by me, and lived on
shadows.  But when this dream fell, and I had betrayed you, and thought I
had killed—’  She paused.  ‘I thought I had killed Gondremark,’ she said
with a deep flush, ‘and I found myself alone, as you said.’
</p><p>The mention of the name of Gondremark pricked the Princes generosity like
a spur.  ‘Well,’ he cried, ‘and whose fault was it but mine?  It was my
duty to be beside you, loved or not.  But I was a skulker in the grain,
and found it easier to desert than to oppose you.  I could never learn
that better part of love, to fight love’s battles.  But yet the love was
there.  And now when this toy kingdom of ours has fallen, first of all by
my demerits, and next by your inexperience, and we are here alone
together, as poor as Job and merely a man and a woman—let me conjure you
to forgive the weakness and to repose in the love.  Do not mistake me!’
he cried, seeing her about to speak, and imposing silence with uplifted
hand.  ‘My love is changed; it is purged of any conjugal pretension; it
does not ask, does not hope, does not wish for a return in kind.  You may
forget for ever that part in which you found me so distasteful, and
accept without embarrassment the affection of a brother.’
</p><p>‘You are too generous, Otto,’ she said.  ‘I know that I have forfeited
your love.  I cannot take this sacrifice.  You had far better leave me.
O, go away, and leave me to my fate!’
</p><p>‘O no!’ said Otto; ‘we must first of all escape out of this hornet’s
nest, to which I led you.  My honour is engaged.  I said but now we were
as poor as Job; and behold! not many miles from here I have a house of my
own to which I will conduct you.  Otto the Prince being down, we must try
what luck remains to Otto the Hunter.  Come, Seraphina; show that you
forgive me, and let us set about this business of escape in the best
spirits possible.  You used to say, my dear, that, except as a husband
and a prince, I was a pleasant fellow.  I am neither now, and you may
like my company without remorse.  Come, then; it were idle to be
captured.  Can you still walk?  Forth, then,’ said he, and he began to
lead the way.
</p><p>A little below where they stood, a good-sized brook passed below the
road, which overleapt it in a single arch.  On one bank of that
loquacious water a foot-path descended a green dell.  Here it was rocky
and stony, and lay on the steep scarps of the ravine; here it was choked
with brambles; and there, in fairy haughs, it lay for a few paces evenly
on the green turf.  Like a sponge, the hillside oozed with well-water.
The burn kept growing both in force and volume; at every leap it fell
with heavier plunges and span more widely in the pool.  Great had been
the labours of that stream, and great and agreeable the changes it had
wrought.  It had cut through dykes of stubborn rock, and now, like a
blowing dolphin, spouted through the orifice; along all its humble
coasts, it had undermined and rafted-down the goodlier timber of the
forest; and on these rough clearings it now set and tended primrose
gardens, and planted woods of willow, and made a favourite of the silver
birch.  Through all these friendly features the path, its human acolyte,
conducted our two wanderers downward,—Otto before, still pausing at the
more difficult passages to lend assistance; the Princess following.  From
time to time, when he turned to help her, her face would lighten upon
his—her eyes, half desperately, woo him.  He saw, but dared not
understand.  ‘She does not love me,’ he told himself, with magnanimity.
‘This is remorse or gratitude; I were no gentleman, no, nor yet a man, if
I presumed upon these pitiful concessions.’
</p><p>Some way down the glen, the stream, already grown to a good bulk of
water, was rudely dammed across, and about a third of it abducted in a
wooden trough.  Gaily the pure water, air’s first cousin, fleeted along
the rude aqueduct, whose sides and floor it had made green with grasses.
The path, bearing it close company, threaded a wilderness of briar and
wild-rose.  And presently, a little in front, the brown top of a mill and
the tall mill-wheel, spraying diamonds, arose in the narrows of the glen;
at the same time the snoring music of the saws broke the silence.
</p><p>The miller, hearing steps, came forth to his door, and both he and Otto
started.
</p><p>‘Good-morning, miller,’ said the Prince.  ‘You were right, it seems, and
I was wrong.  I give you the news, and bid you to Mittwalden.  My throne
has fallen—great was the fall of it!—and your good friends of the Phoenix
bear the rule.’
</p><p>The red-faced miller looked supreme astonishment.  ‘And your Highness?’
he gasped.
</p><p>‘My Highness is running away,’ replied Otto, ‘straight for the frontier.’
</p><p>‘Leaving Grünewald?’ cried the man.  ‘Your father’s son?  It’s not to be
permitted!’
</p><p>‘Do you arrest us, friend?’ asked Otto, smiling.
</p><p>‘Arrest you?  I?’ exclaimed the man.  ‘For what does your Highness take
me?  Why, sir, I make sure there is not a man in Grünewald would lay
hands upon you.’
</p><p>‘O, many, many,’ said the Prince; ‘but from you, who were bold with me in
my greatness, I should even look for aid in my distress.’
</p><p>The miller became the colour of beetroot.  ‘You may say so indeed,’ said
he.  ‘And meanwhile, will you and your lady step into my house.’
</p><p>‘We have not time for that,’ replied the Prince; ‘but if you would oblige
us with a cup of wine without here, you will give a pleasure and a
service, both in one.’
</p><p>The miller once more coloured to the nape.  He hastened to bring forth
wine in a pitcher and three bright crystal tumblers.  ‘Your Highness must
not suppose,’ he said, as he filled them, ‘that I am an habitual drinker.
The time when I had the misfortune to encounter you, I was a trifle
overtaken, I allow; but a more sober man than I am in my ordinary, I do
not know where you are to look for; and even this glass that I drink to
you (and to the lady) is quite an unusual recreation.’
</p><p>The wine was drunk with due rustic courtesies; and then, refusing further
hospitality, Otto and Seraphina once more proceeded to descend the glen,
which now began to open and to be invaded by the taller trees.
</p><p>‘I owed that man a reparation,’ said the Prince; ‘for when we met I was
in the wrong and put a sore affront upon him.  I judge by myself,
perhaps; but I begin to think that no one is the better for a
humiliation.’
</p><p>‘But some have to be taught so,’ she replied.
</p><p>‘Well, well,’ he said, with a painful embarrassment.  ‘Well, well.  But
let us think of safety.  My miller is all very good, but I do not pin my
faith to him.  To follow down this stream will bring us, but after
innumerable windings, to my house.  Here, up this glade, there lies a
cross-cut—the world’s end for solitude—the very deer scarce visit it.
Are you too tired, or could you pass that way?’
</p><p>‘Choose the path, Otto.  I will follow you,’ she said.
</p><p>‘No,’ he replied, with a singular imbecility of manner and appearance,
‘but I meant the path was rough.  It lies, all the way, by glade and
dingle, and the dingles are both deep and thorny.’
</p><p>‘Lead on,’ she said.  ‘Are you not Otto the Hunter?’
</p><p>They had now burst across a veil of underwood, and were come into a lawn
among the forest, very green and innocent, and solemnly surrounded by
trees.  Otto paused on the margin, looking about him with delight; then
his glance returned to Seraphina, as she stood framed in that silvan
pleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable eyes.  A
weakness both of the body and mind fell on him like the beginnings of
sleep; the cords of his activity were relaxed, his eyes clung to her.
‘Let us rest,’ he said; and he made her sit down, and himself sat down
beside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound.
</p><p>She sat with her eyes downcast, her slim hand dabbling in grass, like a
maid waiting for love’s summons.  The sound of the wind in the forest
swelled and sank, and drew near them with a running rush, and died away
and away in the distance into fainting whispers.  Nearer hand, a bird out
of the deep covert uttered broken and anxious notes.  All this seemed but
a halting prelude to speech.  To Otto it seemed as if the whole frame of
nature were waiting for his words; and yet his pride kept him silent.
The longer he watched that slender and pale hand plucking at the grasses,
the harder and rougher grew the fight between pride and its kindly
adversary.
</p><p>‘Seraphina,’ he said at last, ‘it is right you should know one thing: I
never . . .’  He was about to say ‘doubted you,’ but was that true?  And,
if true, was it generous to speak of it?  Silence succeeded.
</p><p>‘I pray you, tell it me,’ she said; ‘tell it me, in pity.’
</p><p>‘I mean only this,’ he resumed, ‘that I understand all, and do not blame
you.  I understand how the brave woman must look down on the weak man.  I
think you were wrong in some things; but I have tried to understand it,
and I do.  I do not need to forget or to forgive, Seraphina, for I have
understood.’
</p><p>‘I know what I have done,’ she said.  ‘I am not so weak that I can be
deceived with kind speeches.  I know what I have been—I see myself.  I am
not worth your anger, how much less to be forgiven!  In all this downfall
and misery, I see only me and you: you, as you have been always; me, as I
was—me, above all!  O yes, I see myself: and what can I think?’
</p><p>‘Ah, then, let us reverse the parts!’ said Otto.  ‘It is ourselves we
cannot forgive, when we deny forgiveness to another—so a friend told me
last night.  On these terms, Seraphina, you see how generously _I_ have
forgiven myself.  But am not I to be forgiven?  Come, then, forgive
yourself—and me.’
</p><p>She did not answer in words, but reached out her hand to him quickly.  He
took it; and as the smooth fingers settled and nestled in his, love ran
to and fro between them in tender and transforming currents.
</p><p>‘Seraphina,’ he cried, ‘O, forget the past!  Let me serve and help you;
let me be your servant; it is enough for me to serve you and to be near
you; let me be near you, dear—do not send me away.’  He hurried his
pleading like the speech of a frightened child.  ‘It is not love,’ he
went on; ‘I do not ask for love; my love is enough . . .’
</p><p>‘Otto!’ she said, as if in pain.
</p><p>He looked up into her face.  It was wrung with the very ecstasy of
tenderness and anguish; on her features, and most of all in her changed
eyes, there shone the very light of love.
</p><p>‘Seraphina?’ he cried aloud, and with a sudden, tuneless voice,
‘Seraphina?’
</p><p>‘Look round you at this glade,’ she cried, ‘and where the leaves are
coming on young trees, and the flowers begin to blossom.  This is where
we meet, meet for the first time; it is so much better to forget and to
be born again.  O what a pit there is for sins—God’s mercy, man’s
oblivion!’
</p><p>‘Seraphina,’ he said, ‘let it be so, indeed; let all that was be merely
the abuse of dreaming; let me begin again, a stranger.  I have dreamed,
in a long dream, that I adored a girl unkind and beautiful; in all things
my superior, but still cold, like ice.  And again I dreamed, and thought
she changed and melted, glowed and turned to me.  And I—who had no merit
but a love, slavish and unerect—lay close, and durst not move for fear of
waking.’
</p><p>‘Lie close,’ she said, with a deep thrill of speech.
</p><p>So they spake in the spring woods; and meanwhile, in Mittwalden
Rath-haus, the Republic was declared.
</p>

<p><strong>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL POSTSCRIPT TO COMPLETE THE STORY</strong>
</p>
<p>The reader well informed in modern history will not require details as to
the fate of the Republic.  The best account is to be found in the memoirs
of Herr Greisengesang (7 Bände: Leipzig), by our passing acquaintance the
licentiate Roederer.  Herr Roederer, with too much of an author’s
licence, makes a great figure of his hero—poses him, indeed, to be the
centre-piece and cloud-compeller of the whole.  But, with due allowance
for this bias, the book is able and complete.
</p><p>The reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous and bracing pages of
Sir John (2 vols., London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown).  Sir
John, who plays but a tooth-comb in the orchestra of this historical
romance, blows in his own book the big bassoon.  His character is there
drawn at large; and the sympathy of Landor has countersigned the
admiration of the public.  One point, however, calls for explanation; the
chapter on Grünewald was torn by the hand of the author in the palace
gardens; how comes it, then, to figure at full length among my more
modest pages, the Lion of the caravan?  That eminent literatus was a man
of method; ‘Juvenal by double entry,’ he was once profanely called; and
when he tore the sheets in question, it was rather, as he has since
explained, in the search for some dramatic evidence of his sincerity,
than with the thought of practical deletion.  At that time, indeed, he
was possessed of two blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double.  But the
chapter, as the reader knows, was honestly omitted from the famous
‘Memoirs on the various Courts of Europe.’  It has been mine to give it
to the public.
</p><p>Bibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of our characters.  I
have here before me a small volume (printed for private circulation: no
printer’s name; n.d.), ‘Poésies par Frédéric et Amélie.’  Mine is a
presentation copy, obtained for me by Mr. Bain in the Haymarket; and the
name of the first owner is written on the fly-leaf in the hand of Prince
Otto himself.  The modest epigraph—‘Le rime n’est pas riche’—may be
attributed, with a good show of likelihood, to the same collaborator.  It
is strikingly appropriate, and I have found the volume very dreary.
Those pieces in which I seem to trace the hand of the Princess are
particularly dull and conscientious.  But the booklet had a fair success
with that public for which it was designed; and I have come across some
evidences of a second venture of the same sort, now unprocurable.  Here,
at least, we may take leave of Otto and Seraphina—what do I say? of
Frédéric and Amélie—ageing together peaceably at the court of the wife’s
father, jingling French rhymes and correcting joint proofs.
</p><p>Still following the book-lists, I perceive that Mr. Swinburne has
dedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous sonnets to the memory of
Gondremark; that name appears twice at least in Victor Hugo’s
trumpet-blasts of patriot enumeration; and I came latterly, when I
supposed my task already ended, on a trace of the fallen politician and
his Countess.  It is in the ‘Diary of J. Hogg Cotterill, Esq.’ (that very
interesting work).  Mr. Cotterill, being at Naples, is introduced (May
27th) to ‘a Baron and Baroness Gondremark—he a man who once made a
noise—she still beautiful—both witty.  She complimented me much upon my
French—should never have known me to be English—had known my uncle, Sir
John, in Germany—recognised in me, as a family trait, some of his <u>grand
air</u> and studious courtesy—asked me to call.’  And again (May 30th),
‘visited the Baronne de Gondremark—much gratified—a most <u>refined</u>,
<u>intelligent</u> woman, quite of the old school, now, <u>hélas</u>! extinct—had
read my <u>Remarks on Sicily</u>—it reminds her of my uncle, but with more of
grace—I feared she thought there was less energy—assured no—a softer
style of presentation, more of the <u>literary grace</u>, but the same firm
grasp of circumstance and force of thought—in short, just Buttonhole’s
opinion.  Much encouraged.  I have a real esteem for this patrician
lady.’  The acquaintance lasted some time; and when Mr. Cotterill left in
the suite of Lord Protocol, and, as he is careful to inform us, in
Admiral Yardarm’s flag-ship, one of his chief causes of regret is to
leave ‘that most <u>spirituelle</u> and sympathetic lady, who already regards
me as a younger brother.’
