<p>Docak had no children, the single son born to him ten years before
having died in infancy. His wife was about his age, and had noticeably
lighter skin and bright brown eyes. It was evident that she had
more white blood in her veins than her husband, who was of mixed
breed.</p>

<p>Docak did not knock before entering. His wife was trimming the
lamp at the moment, and looked around to see whom he had brought
with him. She must have felt surprised, but, if so, she concealed
all evidence of it. She smiled in her pleasant way, showing her
fine white teeth, and said in a low, soft voice, "Con-ji-meet,"
which is the native word for welcome.</p>

<p>Her first curiosity was concerning the boys, with whom she shook
hands, but, when she turned to the grinning Jack, she made no
effort to hide her astonishment, for he had addressed her by name.</p>

<p>"Crestana, I guess you haven't forgot Jack Cosgrove?"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh! dat you&mdash;much glad! much glad!" she said, laughing
more heartily than her husband had done.</p>

<p>She was very vivacious, and, though she could not speak the English
tongue as well as he, she made it up by her earnestness.</p>

<p>"So glad&mdash;much glad&mdash;whale kill vessel ag'in? Docak bring no
ice? Where capen? How you be? Crestana glad to see you&mdash;yes, heap
much glad."</p>

<p>"By the great horned spoon," said Jack, holding the small hand
of Crestana in his hearty grasp, and looking around at the others
with one of his broadest grins; "the women are the same the world
over; they can talk faster than a Greenland harrycane, and when
they're glad they're glad all over, and clean through. Docak,
you're a purty good chap, but you aint half good enough for such
a wife as Crestana, and that reminds me we're as hungry as git
out."</p>

<p>The wife evidently thought the sailor was a funny fellow, for
she broke into merry laughter again, and, disengaging her hand,
hurried into the kitchen, where she had been busying herself with
her husband's supper.</p>

<p>The visitors, knowing how heartily welcome they were, seated
themselves on the benches, doffed their heavy outer clothing,
and made themselves as much at home as if in the cabin of the
"Nautilus." They leaned their rifles in the corner near the table,
alongside of the long muzzle-loader and several spears belonging
to Docak.</p>

<p>A large supply of dry driftwood was piled near the window, and
from this the native kept such a glow in the stove that the whole
interior was filled with grateful warmth.</p>

<p>In the course of a few moments Crestana bustled in, her pretty
teeth showing between her lips as she chatted with Jack and her
husband. She drew the table out near the middle of the room, and
quickly brought in some fish, "done to a turn." She furnished
coffee, too, and the three guests who partook of her hospitality
insist to this day that never in the wide world will they ever
taste such fragrant coffee and such delicately-flavored fish as
they feasted upon that night in Docak's hut. But we must not forget
that they had the best sauce ever known&mdash;hunger.</p>

<p>The meal was enlivened by lively conversation, in which Jack
managed to tell the story of the mishap that had befallen himself
and companions. She showed less interest in the boys than in the
sailor, though, as may be supposed, Rob and Fred were charmed
with her simplicity and good-nature. She placed spoons, knives
and forks, cups, saucers, and plates before them, and there was
a neatness about herself and the room which added doubly to its
attractiveness, and did much to enlighten the youths about these
people, whom they supposed to be barely half civilized.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, and the wife occupied herself in
clearing away things, Docak brought out a couple of pipes, filled
with tobacco, and offered one each to Rob and Fred. They, declining
with thanks, he did the same to Jack, who accepted one, and a
minute later the two were puffing away like a couple of veteran
devotees of the weed.</p>

<p>The boys felt some curiosity to learn how it was that Docak,
whose manner of living proved that he knew the ways of the more
civilized people among the settlements, made his home in this
lonely place, far removed from all neighbors. They could not learn
everything that evening but they ascertained it afterward.</p>

<p>Docak had lived awhile in Invernik, and then took up his residence
at Ivigtut, where he lived until four or five years before Rob
and Fred met him. It was in the latter place he married Crestana,
and it was there that his only child died.</p>

<p>The loss of the little one made him morose for awhile, and he
got into a difficulty with one of his people, in which, in the
eyes of the law, Docak was wholly to blame. He was punished, and,
in resentment, he withdrew to a place on the west coast, about
sixty miles north of the famous cryolite mines. There he lived,
alone with his wife, as serenely contented as he could be anywhere.
He made occasional visits to Ivigtut, to Invernik, Julianshaab,
and other settlements, but it was only for the purpose of getting
ammunition and other supplies which could be obtained in no other
way.</p>

<p>Docak was not only a skilled fisherman, but, what is rare among
his class of people, he was a great hunter. He was sometimes absent
for days at a time in the interior, traveling many miles on snow-shoes,
forcing his way over the icy mountains and braving the Arctic
blasts that had driven back many a hardy European from his search
for the North Pole.</p>

<p>While he was absent his wife went about her duties with calm
contentment, where a more sensitive person would have gone out
of her mind from very loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p>Our friends having effected their escape from the iceberg, it
was time to decide what next should be done.</p>

<p>The most obvious course was to go to Ivigtut, where they could
obtain the means of returning to England, most likely by way of
Denmark, and possibly might hear something of the "Nautilus,"
if she had survived the gale which caused her to part company
with Jack and the boys.</p>

<p>The kayak was strong enough to carry them, and Docak could make
the voyage in a couple of days. This Rob and Fred supposed would
be the plan adopted, but the native put another idea into their
heads which caused in a twinkling a radical change of programme,
and brought an experience to the two of which neither dreamed.</p>

<p>While Docak and Jack sat beside each other on the longer bench,
smoking and talking, the native frequently cast admiring glances
at the rifles leaning against the wall in the corner. Finally
he rose, and, walking over, examined the three weapons, taking
up each in turn and holding it so the light from the lamp fell
upon it. He was most struck with Rob's, which had more ornamentation
than the others. It was a modern loader, but not a repeater.</p>

<p>"He berry good," he remarked, setting it down again in the corner
and resuming his place on the bench beside his friend; "why you
not go hunting with me 'fore go to Ivigtut?"</p>

<p>Jack saw the eyes of the boys sparkle at the suggestion. Why
not, indeed, go on a hunting excursion into the interior before
they returned to the settlement? What was to prevent? It would
take but a few days, and there is royal game to be found in Greenland.</p>

<p>Docak explained that this was the time of the year when he was
accustomed to indulge in a long hunt. Twelve months before he
had brought down some animals rarely ever encountered in that
portion of the country, and he was hopeful of doing the same again,
when he could have his friends to help.</p>

<p>So the matter needed only to be broached to be settled. The whole
party would go on a hunt, and they would start the following morning,
returning whenever they deemed best, and then making their way
to Ivigtut at a leisurely rate, set about their return home, if
that should be deemed the best course.</p>

<p>The warmth and smoke in the room led the boys to decide to step
outside a brief while, to inhale the crisp air, and, inviting
Fred to follow, Rob sprang up and hurried in a stooping posture
through the long entry-way. Fred stopped a minute in the road
to peep through the opening into the kitchen, where the thrifty
housewife was busy.</p>

<p>She smiled pleasantly at him, and he might have lingered had
he not heard the voice of his friend.</p>

<p>"Hurry out, Fred! Here's the most wonderful sight you ever saw.
Quick, or you will lose it!"</p>

<p>Fred lost no time in rushing after Rob, whose excitement was
fully justified.</p>
