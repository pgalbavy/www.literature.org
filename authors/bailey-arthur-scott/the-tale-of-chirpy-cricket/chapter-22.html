<p>One night when Chirpy Cricket was fiddling his prettiest, not far from
the fence between the farmyard and the meadow, he had a queer feeling, as
if somebody were gazing at him. And glancing up quickly, he saw that a
plump person sat on a fence-rail, busily engaged in staring at him.
</p>
<p>"How-dy do!" Chirpy Cricket piped; for the fat, four-legged person looked
both cheerful and harmless. "I take it you're fond of music."
</p><p>The stranger, whose name was Mr. Meadow Mouse, smiled. "I won't dispute
your statement," he said.
</p><p>"Perhaps you play some instrument yourself," Chirpy observed.
</p><p>But Mr. Meadow Mouse shook his head.
</p><p>"No!" he replied. "No! To tell the truth, I haven't much time for that
sort of thing. Besides, it seems to me somewhat dangerous. I was
wondering, while I watched you, whether you weren't likely to fiddle
yourself into bits--you were working so hard."
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket assured him that there wasn't the least danger.
</p><p>"All my family are famous fiddlers," he said. "And I've never heard of
such an accident happening to any of them."
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse appeared to be slightly disappointed.
</p><p>"I thought," he said, "I could pick up the pieces for you, in case you
fell apart."
</p><p>Dark as he was, Chirpy Cricket almost turned pale.
</p><p>"You--you weren't intending to--to swallow the pieces, were you?" he
stammered.
</p><p>"Dear me! No!" Mr. Meadow Mouse gasped. "I'm what's known as a
vegetarian."
</p><p>Well, when he heard that, Chirpy Cricket made ready to jump out of the
stranger's way. He didn't know what a vegetarian was; but it sounded
terrible to him.
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse must have guessed that Chirpy was uneasy. Anyhow, he
hastened to explain that a vegetarian was one that ate only food that
grew on plants of one kind or another.
</p><p>"I live for the most part on seeds and grain," he said. "So you see I'm
quite harmless."
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket told him that he was glad to know it.
</p><p>"I'm a vegetarian myself," he added proudly, "for I eat blades of grass.
And you see I'm harmless too."
</p><p>Mr. Meadow Mouse bestowed another fat smile on him.
</p><p>"Then," he said, "it must be quite safe for me to stay here and talk with
you."
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket didn't know why the plump gentleman was smiling, unless it
was because he felt easy in his mind. Chirpy couldn't help liking him, he
was so friendly.
</p><p>"I'll play my favorite tune for you, if you wish," Chirpy offered, being
eager to do something pleasant for his new acquaintance.
</p><p>"Do!" said Mr. Meadow Mouse. "And make it as lively as you please. For
I've just dined well and I'm in a very cheerful mood."
</p><p>So Chirpy Cricket began his _cr-r-r-i!_ _cr-r-r-i! cr-r-r-i!_ while Mr.
Meadow Mouse moved nearer and watched him closely. After a time he began
to fidget. And at last he asked Chirpy if he wouldn't please be still for
a moment, because there was something he wanted to say.
</p><p>Chirpy stopped fiddling.
</p><p>"I notice," said Mr. Meadow Mouse, "that you're having some trouble
tuning up your fiddle. So if you don't mind I'll go over in the cornfield
on a matter of business and come back here later. Then, no doubt, you'll
be all ready to play a tune for me."
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket had to explain that he had been playing a tune all the
time--that he always played on one note.
</p><p>So Mr. Meadow Mouse stayed and heard more of the fiddling. He begged
Chirpy's pardon for his mistake. And he said that if he only had a fiddle
he should like to learn the same tune himself. "Although," he added, "it
must be very difficult to play always on the same note. It must take a
great deal of practice."
