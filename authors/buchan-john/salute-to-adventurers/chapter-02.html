<p>The storm died away in the night, and I awoke to a clear, rain-washed
world and the chill of an autumn morn. I was as stiff and sore
as if I had been whipped, my clothes were sodden and heavy, and
not till I had washed my face and hands in the burn and stretched
my legs up the hill-side did I feel restored to something of my
ordinary briskness.</p>

<p>The encampment looked weird indeed as seen in the cruel light
of day. The women were cooking oatmeal on iron girdles, but the
fire burned smokily, and the cake I got was no better than dough.
They were a disjaskit lot, with tousled hair and pinched faces,
in which shone hungry eyes. Most were barefoot, and all but two&mdash;three
were ancient beldames who should have been at home in the chimney
corner. I noticed one decent-looking young woman, who had the
air of a farm servant; and two were well-fed country wives who
had probably left a brood of children to mourn them. The men were
little better. One had the sallow look of a weaver, another was
a hind with a big, foolish face, and there was a slip of a lad
who might once have been a student of divinity. But each had a
daftness in the eye and something weak and unwholesome in the
visage, so that they were an offence to the fresh, gusty moorland.</p>

<p>All but Muckle John himself. He came out of his tent and prayed
till the hill-sides echoed. It was a tangle of bedlamite ravings,
with long screeds from the Scriptures intermixed like currants
in a bag-pudding. But there was power in the creature, in the
strange lift of his voice, in his grim jowl, and in the fire of
his sombre eyes. The others I pitied, but him I hated and feared.
On him and his kind were to be blamed all the madness of the land,
which had sent my father overseas and desolated our dwelling.
So long as crazy prophets preached brimstone and fire, so long
would rough-shod soldiers and cunning lawyers profit by their
folly; and often I prayed in those days that the two evils might
devour each other.</p>

<p>It was time that I was cutting loose from this ill-omened company
and continuing my road Edinburgh-wards. We were lying in a wide
trough of the Pentland Hills, which I well remembered. The folk
of the plains called it the Cauldstaneslap, and it made an easy
path for sheep and cattle between the Lothians and Tweeddale.
The camp had been snugly chosen, for, except by the gleam of a
fire in the dark, it was invisible from any distance. Muckle John
was so filled with his vapourings that I could readily slip off
down the burn and join the southern highway at the village of
Linton.</p>

<p>I was on the verge of going when I saw that which pulled me up.
A rider was coming over the moor. The horse leaped the burn lightly,
and before I could gather my wits was in the midst of the camp,
where Muckle John was vociferating to heaven.</p>

<p>My heart gave a great bound, for I saw it was the girl who had
sung to me in the rain. She rode a fine sorrel, with the easy
seat of a skilled horsewoman. She was trimly clad in a green riding-coat,
and over the lace collar of it her hair fell in dark, clustering
curls. Her face was grave, like a determined child's; but the
winds of the morning had whipped it to a rosy colour, so that
into that clan of tatterdemalions she rode like Proserpine descending
among the gloomy Shades. In her hand she carried a light riding-whip.</p>

<p>A scream from the women brought Muckle John out of his rhapsodies.
He stared blankly at the slim girl who confronted him with hand
on hip.</p>

<p>"What seekest thou here, thou shameless woman?" he roared.</p>

<p>"I am come," said she, "for my tirewoman, Janet Somerville, who
left me three days back without a reason. Word was brought me
that she had joined a mad company called the Sweet-Singers, that
lay at the Cauldstaneslap. Janet's a silly body, but she means
no ill, and her mother is demented at the loss of her. So I have
come for Janet."</p>

<p>Her cool eyes ran over the assembly till they lighted on the
one I had already noted as more decent-like than the rest. At
the sight of the girl the woman bobbed a curtsy.</p>

<p>"Come out of it, silly Janet," said she on the horse; "you'll
never make a Sweet-Singer, for there's not a notion of a tune
in your head."</p>

<p>"It's not singing that I seek, my leddy," said the woman, blushing.
"I follow the call o' the Lord by the mouth o' His servant, John
Gib."</p>

<p>"You'll follow the call of your mother by the mouth of me, Elspeth
Blair. Forget these havers, Janet, and come back like a good Christian
soul. Mount and be quick. There's room behind me on Bess."</p>

<p>The words were spoken in a kindly, wheedling tone, and the girl's
face broke into the prettiest of smiles. Perhaps Janet would have
obeyed, but Muckle John, swift to prevent defection, took up the
parable.</p>

<p>"Begone, ye daughter of Heth!" he bellowed, "ye that are like
the devils that pluck souls from the way of salvation. Begone,
or it is strongly borne in upon me that ye will dree the fate
of the women of Midian, of whom it is written that they were slaughtered
and spared not."</p>

<p>The girl did not look his way. She had her coaxing eyes on her
halting maid. "Come, Janet, woman," she said again. "It's no job
for a decent lass to be wandering at the tail of a crazy warlock."</p>

<p>The word roused Muckle John to fury. He sprang forward, caught
the sorrel's bridle, and swung it round. The girl did not move,
but looked him square in the face, the young eyes fronting his
demoniac glower. Then very swiftly her arm rose, and she laid
the lash of her whip roundly over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The man snarled like a beast, leaped back and plucked from his
seaman's belt a great horse-pistol. I heard the click of it cocking,
and the next I knew it was levelled at the girl's breast. The
sight of her and the music of her voice had so enthralled me that
I had made no plan as to my own conduct. But this sudden peril
put fire into my heels, and in a second I was at his side. I had
brought from home a stout shepherd's staff, with which I struck
the muzzle upwards. The pistol went off in a great stench of powder,
but the bullet wandered to the clouds.</p>

<p>Muckle John let the thing fall into the moss, and plucked another
weapon from his belt. This was an ugly knife, such as a cobbler
uses for paring hides. I knew the seaman's trick of throwing,
having seen their brawls at the pier of Leith, and I had no notion
for the steel in my throat. The man was far beyond me in size
and strength, so I dared not close with him. Instead, I gave him
the point of my staff with all my power straight in the midriff.
The knife slithered harmlessly over my shoulder, and he fell backwards
into the heather.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost, for the whole clan came round me
like a flock of daws. One of the men, the slim lad, had a pistol,
but I saw by the way he handled it that it was unprimed. I was
most afraid of the women, who with their long claws would have
scratched my eyes out, and I knew they would not spare the girl.
To her I turned anxiously, and, to my amazement, she was laughing.
She recognized me, for she cried out, "Is this the way to Kirknewton,
sir?" And all the time she shook with merriment. In that hour
I thought her as daft as the Sweet-Singers, whose nails were uncommonly
near my cheek.</p>

<p>I got her bridle, tumbled over the countryman with a kick, and
forced her to the edge of the sheepfold. But she wheeled round
again, crying, "I must have Janet," and faced the crowd with her
whip. That was well enough, but I saw Muckle John staggering to
his feet, and I feared desperately for his next move. The girl
was either mad or extraordinarily brave.</p>

<p>"Get back, you pitiful knaves," she cried. "Lay a hand on me,
and I will cut you to ribbons. Make haste, Janet, and quit this
folly."</p>

<p>It was gallant talk, but there was no sense in it. Muckle John
was on his feet, half the clan had gone round to our rear, and
in a second or two she would have been torn from the saddle. A
headstrong girl was beyond my management, and my words of entreaty
were lost in the babel of cries.</p>

<p>But just then there came another sound. From the four quarters
of the moor there closed in upon us horsemen. They came silently
and were about us before I had a hint of their presence. It was
a troop of dragoons in the king's buff and scarlet, and they rode
us down as if we had been hares in a field. The next I knew of
it I was sprawling on the ground with a dizzy head, and horses
trampling around me, I had a glimpse of Muckle John with a pistol
at his nose, and the sorrel curveting and plunging in a panic.
Then I bethought myself of saving my bones, and crawled out of
the mellay behind the sheepfold.</p>

<p>Presently I realized that this was the salvation I had been seeking.
Gib was being pinioned, and two of the riders were speaking with
the girl. The women hung together like hens in a storm, while
the dragoons laid about them with the flat of their swords. There
was one poor creature came running my way, and after her followed
on foot a long fellow, who made clutches at her hair. He caught
her with ease, and proceeded to bind her hands with great brutality.</p>

<p>"Ye beldame," he said, with many oaths, "I'll pare your talons
for ye."</p>

<p>Now I, who a minute before had been in danger from this very
crew, was smitten with a sudden compunction. Except for Muckle
John, they were so pitifully feeble, a pack of humble, elderly
folk, worn out with fasting and marching and ill weather. I had
been sickened by their crazy devotions, but I was more sickened
by this man's barbarity. It was the woman, too, who had given
me food the night before.</p>

<p>So I stepped out, and bade the man release her.</p>

<p>He was a huge, sunburned ruffian, and for answer aimed a clour
at my head. "Take that, my mannie," he said. "I'll learn ye to
follow the petticoats."</p>

<p>His scorn put me into a fury, in which anger at his brutishness
and the presence of the girl on the sorrel moved my pride to a
piece of naked folly. I flew at his throat, and since I had stood
on a little eminence, the force of my assault toppled him over.
My victory lasted scarcely a minute. He flung me from him like
a feather, then picked me up and laid on to me with the flat of
his sword.</p>

<p>"Ye thrawn jackanapes," he cried, as he beat me. "Ye'll pay dear
for playing your pranks wi' John Donald."</p>

<p>I was a child in his mighty grasp, besides having no breath left
in me to resist. He tied my hands and legs, haled me to his horse,
and flung me sack-like over the crupper. There was no more shamefaced
lad in the world than me at that moment, for coming out of the
din I heard a girl's light laughter.</p>
