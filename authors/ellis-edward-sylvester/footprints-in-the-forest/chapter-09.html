<p>Among all the chagrined Pawnees, there was none so humiliated
as Lone Bear, who had been thrown headlong by the trick of the
young Shawanoe dropping in front of him. That was bad enough,
but it was made a hundred-fold worse when Deerfoot stepped on
the crown of his head before he could rise, or prevent it. It
was Red Wolf who cruelly remarked that the reason for the youth
taking that step was that he might have a <em>soft place</em>
whereon to rest his moccasin.</p>

<p>Instead of replying to the chaffings of his two companions, Lone
Bear sat on a pile of fagots in the deserted camp, and smoked
his pipe in silence.</p>

<p>Red Wolf and the other Pawnee sat near, but neither lighted his
pipe. They had done all they cared to do in the way of tantalizing
their comrade, who had spent a part of his early boyhood among
the Shawanoes on the other side of the Mississippi. They saw he
was in an ugly mood, and would be likely to fight if provoked
further. Though they did not hold him in fear, they did not seek
a quarrel. Besides, too, they saw the serious side to the business:
Deerfoot had already proved that he was a remarkable warrior,
for, amid the shooting and firing of guns, which came from the
forest beyond, there was heard no signal which told that the daring
youth had been shot or captured. The moment such a result should
take place, it would be made known by the exultation whoop from
the one fortunate enough to bring it about.</p>

<p>The question which presented itself to Red Wolf and his companion
was, whether it was probable the wonderful Deerfoot was alone.
The Pawnees were returning from a long excursion eastward, which
had led them across and into new hunting grounds, where their
presence was sure to arouse enmity whenever discovered. On that
journey toward the Mississippi, the Pawnees had come in collision
with other parties of red men; guns had been fired and one or
two scalps taken, including one lost. In addition, the invaders
had destroyed much game, so that abundant ground for complaint
rested with the strangers. What more probable than that some of
those aggrieved tribes had determined on a retaliatory policy,
by sending a strong party to chastise the Pawnees?</p>

<p>Before Red Wolf could start a discussion on this question, the
one at his side became so interested in what was going on deeper
in the woods that he sprang to his feet and was off like a shot.
This left Red Wolf and Lone Bear alone, and the former felt much
less disposition to pick a quarrel than before.</p>

<p>"Are not the hunting grounds of the Shawanoes beyond the Great
River?" asked Red Wolf.</p>

<p>Lone Bear glared at him, as if doubting the sincerity of the
question, but, satisfied a moment later that the inquirer was
in quest of truth, he shook off his surliness and answered:</p>

<p>"Two suns' travel beyond the Great River lie the hunting grounds
of the Shawanoes and Wyandots."</p>

<p>"The Shawanoes are brave warriors?"</p>

<p>"Only the Pawnees excel them," was the reply of Lone Bear, who
in those words uttered the greatest compliment possible to the
warlike tribe which did more than any other to give Kentucky its
baptismal name of the Dark and Bloody Ground.</p>

<p>"Why is the Shawanoe whom you call Deerfoot journeying toward
the hunting grounds of the Pawnees?"</p>

<p>This was a pertinent question, which Lone Bear would have been
glad to have some one answer for him, but which, as might be expected,
he sought to solve without hesitation.</p>

<p>"He has come to look upon the woods and streams and prairies
so favored by the Great Spirit, where the bravest warriors, the
Pawnees, are born, and from which they drive all strangers."</p>

<p>Had Red Wolf chosen, he might have reminded the speaker of the
bad taste of this remark, when he had been so recently overthrown
and disgraced by one of the tribe which he placed lower in rank
than his own; but Red Wolf was disposed to take a more practical
view of matters, and it was natural he should go to the Pawnee
who had once lived among the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>"We saw only one Shawanoe, but there may be more hiding among
the trees, and waiting to fire at the Pawnees when they have their
eyes closed in slumber."</p>

<p>"Red Wolf has seen no Shawanoe!" exclaimed the other, wrathfully.
"There has been none here."</p>

<p>"Why does Lone Bear speak in riddles? What is the totem of the
young warrior called Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>"He <em>was</em> a Shawanoe; his father was Allomaug the great
chief; but Deerfoot became a pale-face; he listened to the prating
of the missionaries, and turned away from the wigwams of his people;
he has not consorted with the Shawanoes for years; they would
give a hundred scalps if they could tear his from his crown. If
the warriors of the Shawanoes were in the woods," added Lone Bear,
with a sweep of his right arm, "Deerfoot would not be here, for
he is a dog that runs when he hears the call of his masters."</p>

<p>None could be more aware of the falsity of this than Lone Bear,
who, though he left the tribe before Deerfoot did, had heard of
his exploits since then, and knew him to be one of the bravest
youths that ever lived. And, again, he lost sight of his recent
experience with him.</p>

<p>But when he reminded Red Wolf that the Shawanoe dwelt beyond
the Great River, whither the Pawnees had not penetrated, and that
Deerfoot had made known that his errand was to look for the captive
pale-face, all fear of his being in the company of a war party
was removed.</p>

<p>However, no matter what explanation was given, it brought forward
other questions which could not be explained away. One of these
was the natural one, that, if the Pawnees had happened to have
the German lad in their custody, by what means did he hope to
recover him? He brought with him nothing in the shape of a ransom,
so far as could be seen, and it was hard to imagine what other
method he expected to employ.</p>

<p>When Otto was bought of the Sauks, a pretty fair price was paid
for him, and it was not to be expected that his purchasers would
discount that compensation. The conclusion that the daring Shawanoe
relied upon other means, which were not apparent, gave a vague
misgiving to Lone Bear and Red Wolf, as they sat near the camp-fire
talking over the stirring incidents of the last half hour.</p>

<p>Now and then they ceased and listened to the sounds which came
from the forest, wherein the efforts were pushed to make prisoner
the young Shawanoe, who was dodging hither and thither as if running
a gauntlet. The temptation was strong to mingle in the general
melee, as it may be called, but the treatment Lone Bear had received
at the hands of the Shawanoe filled him with a fear that he had
never known before, for there was a tinge of superstition in it,
as appeared in the next remark he made.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot calls himself a Shawanoe; he was born with the people,
but when he left them he became an Evil Spirit."</p>

<p>This was Lone Bear's method of saying that the devil bore an
active part in the exploits of the youth, an opinion which was
shared by Red Wolf.</p>

<p>"The Evil One is his friend: if he was not, he would have fallen
by the bullets that were aimed at him. Lone Bear would have slain
the greatest warrior, when he was running before him as Deerfoot
ran, but he could not slay Deerfoot, because the Evil One was
his friend."</p>

<p>This was the kind of remark to please Lone Bear, for it implied
that the best possible reason existed for his failure; his enemy
was of the supernatural class, and, therefore, beyond the power
of any human being to overcome.</p>

<p>Lone Bear turned his head toward the woods, while he held his
lips closed over his pipe-stem. The sharp report of a rifle had
reached their ears, and the two Pawnees listened for a minute
without moving or speaking. Deerfoot just then was doing wonders
in the way of dodging and running, and the warriors sitting by
the camp-fire could almost read the narrative, as you have done
from these printed pages.</p>

<p>Red Wolf leaned forward and lighted his pipe from the glowing
coals, and then seated himself a little closer than before to
his companion. They were at the end of the fire, as may be said,
and so near each other that when they talked and gesticulated
their heads almost touched.</p>

<p>"They will not harm the Shawanoe," was the truthful remark of
Lone Bear, though in his heart he hoped they would bring his reeking
scalp into camp. "The Evil One runs at his side, and when the
bullet is aimed by the brave Pawnees, he catches it in his hand
and holds it that it may not harm the Shawanoe."</p>

<p>This was an ingenious explanation, for it helped to release the
warrior from a questionable situation. Red Wolf, who was sitting
cross-legged, like a tailor, sent an enormous puff of smoke over
his shoulder, and nodded several times with much vigor, to signify
that he indorsed the sentiments of his comrade.</p>

<p>"He can not be harmed until the Good Spirit shall drive the Evil
One away; then the bullet of Lone Bear and the tomahawk of Red
Wolf and the knives of the Pawnees shall reach him. He shall then
die as dies the rattlesnake coiled in our path."</p>

<p>At intervals the two ceased speaking, and, looking toward the
wood, listened, but an interval of silence followed. Both began
to hope that in spite of the armor they had thrown around the
Shawanoe, he had been brought down by some of the Pawnees, who
were making such efforts to destroy him.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the wood from which Deerfoot had caught
sight of the Pawnee war party came down to the edge of the broad
stream over which he swam in order to reach them. On their side,
the growth of the forest ceased some rods away from the water,
so that for a considerable distance, a broad band of open land
lined the river. In this cleared space the camp-fire of the Pawnees
was burning, and they were grouped around it, with nearly as many
warriors at varying distances in the wilderness beyond. When they
looked, it was toward the nearest trees, from which they expected
almost every moment to see some of their comrades emerge, escorting
the prisoner.</p>

<p>Red Wolf seemed to glow with anger, because the Shawanoe persisted
in keeping out of the hands of the Pawnees, who, it may be said,
surrounded him. Removing his long-stemmed pipe from between his
teeth, he held it poised in his left hand, while he gesticulated
with his right.</p>

<p>"Who are the bravest warriors that hunt through the wilderness
and over the prairies?" he asked, launching out in that vain-glorious
boasting, so characteristic of his race: "who drove all other
red men before them? Whose war-whoop makes the pale-faces run
to their cabins and hold their doors closed? Whose shouts cause
their enemies to tremble and call on the Great Spirit to protect
them? Who is it that sweeps&mdash;"</p>

<p>A splintering crash broke in upon this series of questions, and
the bowl of Red Wolf's pipe was shattered into a hundred fragments,
the atoms flying into the faces of the startled Pawnees, who,
accustomed to surprises, leaped to their feet and glanced right
and left to learn the cause of the astounding occurrence.</p>

<p>At that instant something like the flitting of a bird's wing
twinkled in front of their eyes, and the quick "chuck" which followed
showed them an Indian arrow with its head buried in the ground
fifty feet beyond, and the feathered point still a-tremble from
the force with which it had been driven from the bow.</p>

<p>Like a flash they looked toward the opposite point, and that
which met their gaze was perhaps the most alarming sight they
had ever seen. Scarcely a hundred feet away, on the edge of the
wood, stood Deerfoot the Shawanoe. He had already launched two
arrows, and, when they caught sight of him, he was standing with
a third drawn to the head, and apparently in the very act of letting
fly at one of the terrified warriors.</p>

<p>The American Indian as a rule is not powerful, and his muscular
development is moderate; but his life accustoms him to quickness
of movement, and he generally excels in running and leaping. Any
one looking upon Lone Bear and Red Wolf at that moment would have
set them down as the champions of their tribe. When they identified
the archer and saw that he was on the point of discharging another
missile, they made a break for shelter.</p>

<p>Red Wolf headed for the river, possibly because he didn't dare
to lose the time it would take to turn partly on his feet. He
ran as if he meant to make the effort to leap entirely across,
or at least to outrun the arrow which he believed was chasing
him.</p>

<p>He hadn't far to go, and it didn't take him long to travel it.
A bound, a splash, and he vanished.</p>

<p>Lone Bear knew he was closer to the wood than to the water, and
he was equally determined to attain shelter. In his tremendous
effort, he seemed to think he could dodge the shafts that were
whizzing through the air in quick succession after him. He bent
his head so that he was crouching half way to the ground, and
leaped from side to side, ducked and dodged and contorted himself
in an indescribable fashion. When he bounded among the trees,
he must have felt he had made the escape of his life.</p>

<p>But the third arrow did not leave the bow. Deerfoot had not sought
to harm either of the Pawnees, but in obedience to that disposition
to humor which he sometimes displayed, he took pains to fire as
close as he could without hitting them. When he saw their dismay,
he shook from head to foot with silent laughter.</p>

<p>But his mirth was brief. A slight noise caused him to turn his
head. There stood two other Indians directly behind him, one with
his gun leveled directly at his heart.</p>
