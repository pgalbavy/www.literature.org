<p><em>DURING THE </em>absence of Baldy Bicknell in search of the
steam man, neither Mickey nor Ethan had been disturbed by Indians.</p>

<p>They had worked unceasingly in digging the gold mine to which
they had gained access through the instrumentality of the trapper.
When they had gathered together quite a quantity of the gravel
and dirt, with the yellow sand glittering through it, it was carried
a short distance to the margin of the river, where it underwent
the 'washing' process.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, one of them was constantly running up the
bank, to make sure that their old enemies did not steal upon them
unawares. Once or twice they caught sight of several moving in
the distance, but they did not come near enough to molest them,
doing nothing more than to keep them on the qui vive.</p>

<p>There was one Indian, however, who bestrode a black horse, who
haunted them like a phantom. When they glanced over the river,
at almost any time, they could see this individual cautiously
circling about on his horse, and apparently waiting for a chance
to get a shot at his enemies.</p>

<p>'Begorrah, but he loves us, that he does, as the lamb observed
when speaking of the wolf,' said Mickey, just after he had sent
a bullet whistling about their ears.</p>

<p>'Jehosiphat! he loves us too much!' added the Yankee, who had
no relish for these stolen shots. 'If we ain't keerful, there'll
be nuthin' of us left when Baldy comes back, that is, if he comes
back at all.'</p>

<p>This red-skin on his black horse was so dangerous that he required
constant watching, and the men could perform only half their usual
work. It was while Mickey was on the lookout for him that he caught
sight of the steam man coming toward him, as we have related in
another place.</p>

<p>So long as that personage was kept puffing and tearing round
the vicinity, they knew there was no fear of disturbance from
the treacherous red-skins, who were so constantly on the alert
to avenge themselves for the loss they had suffered in the attack;
but it would hardly pay to keep an iron man as sentinel, as the
wear and tear in all probability would be too much for him.</p>

<p>After consulting together upon the return of Baldy, and after
they had ridden behind the steam man to their heart's content,
they decided upon their future course. As the boy, Johnny, had
no intention of devoting himself to manual labor, even had he
been able, it was agreed that he should take upon himself the
part of sentinel, while the others were at work.</p>

<p>In this way it was believed that they could finish within a couple
of weeks, bidding good-by to the Indians, and quickly reach the
States and give up their dangerous pursuits altogether, whereas,
if compelled to do duty themselves as sentinels, their stay would
be doubly prolonged.</p>

<p>This arrangement suited the boy very well, who was thereby given
opportunity to exercise his steam man by occasional airings over
the prairies. To the east and south the plains stretched away
till the horizon shut down upon them, as the sky does on the sea.
To the west, some twenty odd miles distant, a range of mountains
was visible, the peaks being tinged with a faint blue in the distance,
while some of the more elevated looked like white conical clouds
resting against the clear sky beyond.</p>

<p>From the first, young Brainerd expressed a desire to visit these
mountains. There was something in their rugged grandeur which
invited a close inspection, and he proposed to the trapper that
they should make a hunting excursion in that direction.</p>

<p>'No need of goin' so fur for game,' he replied, 'takes too much
time, and thar's sure to be red-skins.'</p>

<p>'But if we go with the steam man we shall frighten them all away,'
was the reply.</p>

<p>'Yas,' laughed Baldy, 'and we'll skear the game away too.'</p>

<p>'But we can overtake that as we did the poor Indian the other
day.'</p>

<p>'Not if he takes to the mountains. Leastways yer isn't him that
would like to undertake to ride up the mountain behind that old
gintle-man.'</p>

<p>'Nor I either, but we can leave the wagon when we get to the
base of the mountain.'</p>

<p>'And give the reds time to come down and run off with yer whole
team.'</p>

<p>'Do you think there is danger of that?'</p>

<p>'Dunno as thar be, but ef they catched sight of yourself, they'd
raise yer ha'r quicker'n lightning.'</p>

<p>Seeing that the little fellow was considerably discouraged, Baldy
hastened to add:</p>

<p>'Ef you're keerful, younker, and I b'lieve yer generally be,
take a ride thar yerself, behind yer jumping-jack, but remember
my advice and stick to yer wagon.'</p>

<p>Having thus obtained permission of the hunter, Johnny Brainerd,
as may well be supposed, did not wait long before availing himself
of his privilege.</p>

<p>The weather, which had been threatening toward the latter part
of the day, entirely cleared away, and the next morning dawned
remarkably clear and beautiful. So the boy announced his intention
of making the expected visit, after which, he promised to devote
himself entirely to performing the duty of sentinel.</p>

<p>'Abeout what time may we look for you, neow!' asked Ethan, as
he was on the point of starting.</p>

<p>'Sometime this afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Come in before dark, as me mither used to observe to meself,
when I wint out shparkin',' added Mickey.</p>

<p>The boy promised to heed their warnings, and began firing up
again. The tank was completely filled with water, and the wagon
filled nearly full of wood, so that the two were capable of running
the contrivance for the entire day, provided there was no cessation,
and that he was on the 'go' continually.</p>

<p>Before starting, it was thoroughly oiled through and through,
and put in the best possible condition, and then waving them all
a pleasant farewell, he steamed gayly toward the mountains.</p>

<p>The ground was admirable, and the steam man traveled better than
ever. Like a locomotive, he seemed to have acquired a certain
smoothness and steadiness of motion, from the exercise he had
already had, and the sharp eye of the boy detected it at once.
He saw that he had been very fortunate indeed in constructing
his wonderful invention, as it was impossible for any human skill
to give it any better movement than it now possessed.</p>

<p>The first three or four miles were passed at a rattling gait,
and the boy was sitting on the front of his wagon, dreamily watching
the play of the huge engine, when it suddenly paused, and with
such abruptness that he was thrown forward from his seat, with
violence, falling directly between the legs of the monster, which
seemed to stand perfectly motionless, like the intelligent elephant
that is fearful of stirring a limb, lest he might crush his master
lying beneath him.</p>

<p>The boy knew at once that some accident had happened, and unmindful
of the severe scratch he had received, he instantly clambered
to his feet, and began examining the machinery, first taking the
precaution to give vent to the surplus steam, which was rapidly
gathering.</p>

<p>It was some time before he could discover the cause of difficulty,
but he finally ascertained that a small bolt had slipped loose,
and had caught in such a manner as to check the motion of the
engine on the instant.</p>

<p>Fortunately no permanent injury was done, and while he was making
matters right, he recollected that in chatting with the trapper
as he was on the point of starting, he had begun to screw on the
bolt, when his attention had been momentarily diverted, when it
escaped his mind altogether, so that he alone was to blame for
the accident, which had so narrowly escaped proving a serious
one.</p>

<p>Making sure that everything was right, he remounted the wagon,
and cautiously resumed his journey, going very slowly at first,
so as to watch the play of the engine.</p>

<p>Everything moved with its usual smoothness, and lifting his gaze
he descried three buffaloes, standing with erect heads, staring
wonderingly at him.</p>

<p>'If you want a chase you may have it!' exclaimed the boy as he
headed toward them. </p>
