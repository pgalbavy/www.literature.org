<P>D'Artagnan had judged correctly; Mordaunt felt that he had
no time to lose, and he lost none. He knew the rapidity of
decision and action that characterized his enemies and
resolved to act with reference to that. This time the
musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them.</P>
<P>After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided
into the subterranean passage, sheathing on the way his now
useless sword, and thus reached the neighboring house, where
he paused to examine himself and to take breath.</P>
<P>&quot;Good!&quot; he said, &quot;nothing, almost nothing  -  scratches,
nothing more; two in the arm and one in the breast. The
wounds that I make are better than that  -  witness the
executioner of Bethune, my uncle and King Charles. Now, not
a second to lose, for a second lost will perhaps save them.
They must die  -  die all together  -  killed at one stroke by
the thunder of men in default of God's. They must disappear,
broken, scattered, annihilated. I will run, then, till my
legs no longer serve, till my heart bursts in my bosom but I
will arrive before they do.&quot;</P>
<P>Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry
barracks, about a quarter of a league distant. He made that
quarter of a league in four or five minutes. Arrived at the
barracks he made himself known, took the best horse in the
stables, mounted and gained the high road. A quarter of an
hour later he was at Greenwich.</P>
<P>&quot;There is the port,&quot; he murmured. &quot;That dark point yonder is
the Isle of Dogs. Good! I am half an hour in advance of
them, an hour, perhaps. Fool that I was! I have almost
killed myself by my needless haste. Now,&quot; he added, rising
in the stirrups and looking about him, &quot;which, I wonder, is
the Lightning?&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment, as if in reply to his words, a man lying on
a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him.
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket, and tying a
knot at each corner  -  the signal agreed upon  -  waved it in
the air and the man came up to him. He was wrapped in a
large rough cape, which concealed his form and partly his
face.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you wish to go on the water, sir?&quot; said the sailor.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, just so. Along the Isle of Dogs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than
another. You would like one that sails as rapidly as  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lightning,&quot; interrupted Mordaunt.</P>
<P>&quot;Then mine is the boat you want, sir. I'm your man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I begin to think so, particularly if you have not forgotten
a certain signal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here it is, sir,&quot; and the sailor took from his coat a
handkerchief, tied at each corner.</P>
<P>&quot;Good, quite right!&quot; cried Mordaunt, springing off his
horse. &quot;There's not a moment to lose; now take my horse to
the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; asked the sailor, &quot;where are your companions? I
thought there were four of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to me, sir. I'm not the man you take me for; you are
in Captain Rogers's post, are you not? under orders from
General Cromwell. Mine, also, are from him!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, sir, I recognize you; you are Captain Mordaunt.&quot;</P>
<P>Mordaunt was startled.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, fear nothing,&quot; said the skipper, showing his face. &quot;I
am a friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Captain Groslow!&quot; cried Mordaunt.</P>
<P>&quot;Himself. The general remembered that I had formerly been a
naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition.
Is there anything new in the wind?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought, perhaps, that the king's death  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has only hastened their flight; in ten minutes they will
perhaps be here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What have you come for, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To embark with you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ah! the general doubted my fidelity?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, but I wish to have a share in my revenge. Haven't you
some one who will relieve me of my horse?&quot;</P>
<P>Groslow whistled and a sailor appeared.</P>
<P>&quot;Patrick,&quot; said Groslow, &quot;take this horse to the stables of
the nearest inn. If any one asks you whose it is you can say
that it belongs to an Irish gentleman.&quot;</P>
<P>The sailor departed without reply.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,&quot; said Mordaunt, &quot;are you not afraid that they will
recognize you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no danger, dressed as I am in this pilot coat, on
a night as dark as this. Besides even you didn't recognize
me; they will be much less likely to.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is true,&quot; said Mordaunt, &quot;and they will be far from
thinking of you. Everything is ready, is it not?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The cargo on board?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Five full casks?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And fifty empty ones.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are carrying port wine to Anvers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Excellent. Now take me aboard and return to your post, for
they will soon be here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am ready.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is important that none of your crew should see me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have but one man on board, and I am as sure of him as I
am of myself. Besides, he doesn't know you; like his mates
he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well; let us go.&quot;</P>
<P>They then went down to the Thames. A boat was fastened to
the shore by a chain fixed to a stake. Groslow jumped in,
followed by Mordaunt, and in five minutes they were quite
away from that world of houses which then crowded the
outskirts of London; and Mordaunt could discern the little
vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs. When they
reached the side of this felucca, Mordaunt, dexterous in his
eagerness for vengeance, seized a rope and climbed up the
side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare
among landsmen. He went with Groslow to the captain's berth,
a sort of temporary cabin of planks, for the chief apartment
had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers, who
were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat.</P>
<P>&quot;They will have nothing to do, then at this end?&quot; said
Mordaunt.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's a capital arrangement. Return to Greenwich and bring
them here. I shall hide myself in your cabin. You have a
longboat?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That in which we came.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It appeared light and well constructed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quite a canoe.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fasten it to the poop with a rope; put the oars into it, so
that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to
do except to cut the cord. Put a good supply of rum and
biscuit in it for the seamen; should the night happen to be
stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console
themselves with.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Consider all this done. Do you wish to see the
powder-room?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No. When you return I will set the fuse myself, but be
careful to conceal your face, so that you cannot be
recognized by them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never fear.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's ten o'clock striking at Greenwich.&quot;</P>
<P>Groslow, then, having given the sailor on duty an order to
be on the watch with more than usual vigilance, went down
into the longboat and soon reached Greenwich. The wind was
chilly and the jetty was deserted, as he approached it; but
he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses
galloping upon the paved road.</P>
<P>These horsemen were our friends, or rather, an avant garde,
composed of D'Artagnan and Athos. As soon as they arrived at
the spot where Groslow stood they stopped, as if guessing
that he was the man they wanted. Athos alighted and calmly
opened the handkerchief tied at each corner, whilst
D'Artagnan, ever cautious, remained on horseback, one hand
upon his pistol, leaning forward watchfully.</P>
<P>On seeing the appointed signal, Groslow, who had at first
crept behind one of the cannon planted on that spot, walked
straight up to the gentlemen. He was so well wrapped up in
his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face
even if the night had not been so dark as to render
precaution superfluous; nevertheless, the keen glance of
Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before
them.</P>
<P>&quot;What do you want with us?&quot; he asked of Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;I wish to inform you, my lord,&quot; replied Groslow, with an
Irish accent, feigned of course, &quot;that if you are looking
for Captain Rogers you will not find him. He fell down this
morning and broke his leg. But I'm his cousin; he told me
everything and desired me to watch instead of him, and in
his place to conduct, wherever they wished to go, the
gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each
corner, like that one which you hold and one which I have in
my pocket.&quot;</P>
<P>And he drew out the handkerchief.</P>
<P>&quot;Was that all he said?&quot; inquired Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;No, my lord; he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds
if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne or any other port
you choose in France.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you think of all this?&quot; said Athos, in a low tone
to D'Artagnan, after explaining to him in French what the
sailor had said in English.</P>
<P>&quot;It seems a likely story to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And to me, too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Besides, we can but blow out his brains if he proves
false,&quot; said the Gascon; &quot;and you, Athos, you know something
of everything and can be our captain. I dare say you know
how to navigate, should he fail us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear friend, you guess well. My father meant me for the
navy and I have some vague notions about navigation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You see!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>They then summoned their friends, who, with Blaisois,
Musqueton and Grimaud, promptly joined them, leaving Parry
behind them, who was to take back to London the horses of
the gentlemen and of their lackeys, which had been sold to
the host in settlement of their account with him. Thanks to
this stroke of business the four friends were able to take
away with them a sum of money which, if not large, was
sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents.</P>
<P>Parry parted from his friends regretfully; they had proposed
his going with them to France, but he had straightway
declined.</P>
<P>&quot;It is very simple,&quot; Musqueton had said; &quot;he is thinking of
Groslow.&quot;</P>
<P>It was Captain Groslow, the reader will remember, who had
broken Parry's head.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that
was habitual with him. He found the wharf too completely
deserted, the night too dark, the captain too accommodating.
He had reported to Aramis what had taken place, and Aramis,
not less distrustful than he, had increased his suspicions.
A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed
Athos of the Gascon's uneasiness.</P>
<P>&quot;We have no time now for suspicions,&quot; said Athos. &quot;The boat
is waiting for us; come.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Besides,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;what prevents our being distrustful
and going aboard at the same time? We can watch the
skipper.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And if he doesn't go straight I will crush him, that's
all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well said, Porthos,&quot; replied D'Artagnan. &quot;Let us go, then.
You first, Musqueton,&quot; and he stopped his friends, directing
the valets to go first, in order to test the plank leading
from the pier to the boat.</P>
<P>The three valets passed without accident. Athos followed
them, then Porthos, then Aramis. D'Artagnan went last, still
shaking his head.</P>
<P>&quot;What in the devil is the matter with you, my friend?&quot; said
Porthos. &quot;Upon my word you would make Caesar afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The matter is,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;that I can see upon
this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you complain of that!&quot; said Porthos. &quot;Everything goes
as if in flowery paths.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything goes too well, Porthos. But no matter; we must
trust in God.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his
place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors,
who, boat-hook in hand, began to push out from the labyrinth
of boats in which they were involved. The other sailor had
already seated himself on the port side and was ready to
row. As soon as there was room for rowing, his companion
rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly.</P>
<P>&quot;At last we are off!&quot; exclaimed Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Alas,&quot; said Athos, &quot;we depart alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; but all four together and without a scratch; which is
a consolation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We are not yet at our destination,&quot; observed the prudent
D'Artagnan; &quot;beware of misadventure.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, my friend!&quot; cried Porthos, &quot;like the crows, you always
bring bad omens. Who could intercept us on such a night as
this, pitch dark, when one does not see more than twenty
yards before one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but to-morrow morning  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow we shall be at Boulogne.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I hope so, with all my heart,&quot; said the Gascon, &quot;and I
confess my weakness. Yes, Athos, you may laugh, but as long
as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels
lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of
musketry which would crush us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But,&quot; said Porthos, with great wisdom, &quot;that was
impossible, for they would have killed the captain and the
sailors.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah! much Monsieur Mordaunt would care. You don't imagine
he would consider a little thing like that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At any rate,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I am glad to hear D'Artagnan
admit that he is afraid.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I not only confess it, but am proud of it,&quot; returned the
Gascon; &quot;I'm not such a rhinoceros as you are. Oho! what's
that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Lightning,&quot; answered the captain, &quot;our felucca.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So far, so good,&quot; laughed Athos.</P>
<P>They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them
to the berth prepared for them  -  a cabin which was to serve
for all purposes and for the whole party; he then tried to
slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one.</P>
<P>&quot;Stop a moment,&quot; cried D'Artagnan; &quot;pray how many men have
you on board, captain?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; was the reply.</P>
<P>&quot;Explain it, Athos.&quot;</P>
<P>Groslow, on the question being interpreted, answered,
&quot;Three, without counting myself.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan understood, for while replying the captain had
raised three fingers. &quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I begin to be
more at my ease, however, whilst you settle yourselves, I
shall make the round of the boat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As for me,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I will see to the supper.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A very good idea, Porthos,&quot; said the Gascon. &quot;Athos lend me
Grimaud, who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps
picked up a little English, and can act as my interpreter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go, Grimaud,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, finding a lantern on the deck, took it up and
with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain, in
English, &quot;Come,&quot; (being, with the classic English oath, the
only English words he knew), and so saying he descended to
the lower deck.</P>
<P>This was divided into three compartments  -  one which was
covered by the floor of that room in which Athos, Porthos
and Aramis were to pass the night; the second was to serve
as the sleeping-room for the servants, the third, under the
prow of the ship, was under the temporary cabin in which
Mordaunt was concealed.</P>
<P>&quot;Oho!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, as he went down the steps of the
hatchway, preceded by the lantern, &quot;what a number of
barrels! one would think one was in the cave of Ali Baba.
What is there in them?&quot; he added, putting his lantern on one
of the casks.</P>
<P>The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again, but
controlling himself he answered:</P>
<P>&quot;Port wine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! port wine! 'tis a comfort,&quot; said the Gascon, &quot;since we
shall not die of thirst. Are they all full?&quot;</P>
<P>Grimaud translated the question, and Groslow, who was wiping
the perspiration from off his forehead, answered:</P>
<P>&quot;Some full, others empty.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan struck the barrels with his hand, and having
ascertained that he spoke the truth, pushed his lantern,
greatly to the captain's alarm, into the interstices between
the barrels, and finding that there was nothing concealed in
them:</P>
<P>&quot;Come along,&quot; he said; and he went toward the door of the
second compartment.</P>
<P>&quot;Stop!&quot; said the Englishman, &quot;I have the key of that door;&quot;
and he opened the door, with a trembling hand, into the
second compartment, where Musqueton and Blaisois were
preparing supper.</P>
<P>Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and
they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment.</P>
<P>This was the room appropriated to the sailors. Two or three
hammocks hung upon the ceiling, a table and two benches
composed the entire furniture. D'Artagnan picked up two or
three old sails hung on the walls, and meeting nothing to
suspect, regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel.</P>
<P>&quot;And this room?&quot; he asked, pointing to the captain's cabin.</P>
<P>&quot;That's my room,&quot; replied Groslow.</P>
<P>&quot;Open the door.&quot;</P>
<P>The captain obeyed. D'Artagnan stretched out his arm in
which he held the lantern, put his head in at the half
opened door, and seeing that the cabin was nothing better
than a shed:</P>
<P>&quot;Good,&quot; he said. &quot;If there is an army on board it is not
here that it is hidden. Let us see what Porthos has found
for supper.&quot; And thanking the captain, he regained the state
cabin, where his friends were.</P>
<P>Porthos had found nothing, and with him fatigue had
prevailed over hunger. He had fallen asleep and was in a
profound slumber when D'Artagnan returned. Athos and Aramis
were beginning to close their eyes, which they half opened
when their companion came in again.</P>
<P>&quot;Well!&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;All is well; we may sleep tranquilly.&quot;</P>
<P>On this assurance the two friends fell asleep; and
D'Artagnan, who was very weary, bade good-night to Grimaud
and laid himself down in his cloak, with naked sword at his
side, in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage,
and it should be impossible to enter the room without
upsetting him.</P></article>
