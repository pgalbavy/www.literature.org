<P>
I found her down in the old neighborhood near the
blueberry swamp, where my mother lived and where
Lop-Ear and I had built our first tree-shelter.  It was
unexpected.  As I came under the tree I heard the
familiar soft sound and looked up.  There she was, the
Swift One, sitting on a limb and swinging her legs back
and forth as she looked at me.
<P>
I stood still for some time.  The sight of her had made
me very happy.  And then an unrest and a pain began to
creep in on this happiness.  I started to climb the
tree after her, and she retreated slowly out the limb.
Just as I reached for her, she sprang through the air
and landed in the branches of the next tree.  From amid
the rustling leaves she peeped out at me and made soft
sounds.  I leaped straight for her, and after an
exciting chase the situation was duplicated, for there
she was, making soft sounds and peeping out from the
leaves of a third tree.
<P>
It was borne in upon me that somehow it was different
now from the old days before Lop-Ear and I had gone on
our adventure-journey. I wanted her, and I knew that I
wanted her.  And she knew it, too. That was why she
would not let me come near her.  I forgot that she was
truly the Swift One, and that in the art of climbing
she had been my teacher.  I pursued her from tree to
tree, and ever she eluded me, peeping back at me with
kindly eyes, making soft sounds, and dancing and
leaping and teetering before me just out of reach.  The
more she eluded me, the more I wanted to catch her, and
the lengthening shadows of the afternoon bore witness
to the futility of my effort.
<P>
As I pursued her, or sometimes rested in an adjoining
tree and watched her, I noticed the change in her.  She
was larger, heavier, more grown-up.  Her lines were
rounder, her muscles fuller, and there was about her
that indefinite something of maturity that was new to
her and that incited me on.  Three years she had been
gone--three years at the very least, and the change in
her was marked.  I say three years; it is as near as I
can measure the time.  A fourth year may have elapsed,
which I have confused with the happenings of the other
three years.  The more I think of it, the more
confident I am that it must be four years that she was
away.
<P>
Where she went, why she went, and what happened to her
during that time, I do not know.  There was no way for
her to tell me, any more than there was a way for
Lop-Ear and me to tell the Folk what we had seen when
we were away.  Like us, the chance is she had gone off
on an adventure-journey, and by herself.  On the other
hand, it is possible that Red-Eye may have been the
cause of her going.  It is quite certain that he must
have come upon her from time to time, wandering in the
woods; and if he had pursued her there is no question
but that it would have been sufficient to drive her
away.  From subsequent events, I am led to believe that
she must have travelled far to the south, across a
range of mountains and down to the banks of a strange
river, away from any of her kind.  Many Tree People
lived down there, and I think it must have been they
who finally drove her back to the horde and to me.  My
reasons for this I shall explain later.
<P>
The shadows grew longer, and I pursued more ardently
than ever, and still I could not catch her.  She made
believe that she was trying desperately to escape me,
and all the time she managed to keep just beyond reach.
I forgot everything--time, the oncoming of night, and
my meat-eating enemies.  I was insane with love of her,
and with--anger, too, because she would not let me come
up with her.  It was strange how this anger against her
seemed to be part of my desire for her.
<P>
As I have said, I forgot everything.  In racing across
an open space I ran full tilt upon a colony of snakes.
They did not deter me.  I was mad.  They struck at me,
but I ducked and dodged and ran on.  Then there was a
python that ordinarily would have sent me screeching to
a tree-top.  He did run me into a tree; but the Swift
One was going out of sight, and I sprang back to the
ground and went on.  It was a close shave.  Then there
was my old enemy, the hyena.  From my conduct he was
sure something was going to happen, and he followed me
for an hour.  Once we exasperated a band of wild pigs,
and they took after us.  The Swift One dared a wide
leap between trees that was too much for me.  I had to
take to the ground.  There were the pigs.  I didn't
care.  I struck the earth within a yard of the nearest
one.  They flanked me as I ran, and chased me into two
different trees out of the line of my pursuit of the
Swift One.  I ventured the ground again, doubled back,
and crossed a wide open space, with the whole band
grunting, bristling, and tusk-gnashing at my heels.
<P>
If I had tripped or stumbled in that open space, there
would have been no chance for me.  But I didn't.  And I
didn't care whether I did or not.  I was in such mood
that I would have faced old Saber-Tooth himself, or a
score of arrow-shooting Fire People.  Such was the
madness of love...with me.  With the Swift One it was
different.  She was very wise.  She did not take any
real risks, and I remember, on looking back across the
centuries to that wild love-chase, that when the pigs
delayed me she did not run away very fast, but waited,
rather, for me to take up the pursuit again.  Also, she
directed her retreat before me, going always in the
direction she wanted to go.
<P>
At last came the dark.  She led me around the mossy
shoulder of a canyon wall that out-jutted among the
trees.  After that we penetrated a dense mass of
underbrush that scraped and ripped me in passing.  But
she never ruffled a hair.  She knew the way.  In the
midst of the thicket was a large oak.  I was very close
to her when she climbed it; and in the forks, in the
nest-shelter I had sought so long and vainly, I caught
her.
<P>
The hyena had taken our trail again, and he now sat
down on the ground and made hungry noises.  But we did
not mind, and we laughed at him when he snarled and
went away through the thicket. It was the spring-time,
and the night noises were many and varied. As was the
custom at that time of the year, there was much
fighting among the animals.  From the nest we could
hear the squealing and neighing of wild horses, the
trumpeting of elephants, and the roaring of lions.  But
the moon came out, and the air was warm, and we laughed
and were unafraid.
<P>
I remember, next morning, that we came upon two ruffled
cock-birds that fought so ardently that I went right up
to them and caught them by their necks.  Thus did the
Swift One and I get our wedding breakfast.  They were
delicious.  It was easy to catch birds in the spring of
the year.  There was one night that year when two elk
fought in the moonlight, while the Swift One and I
watched from the trees; and we saw a lion and lioness
crawl up to them unheeded, and kill them as they
fought.
<P>
There is no telling how long we might have lived in the
Swift One's tree-shelter.  But one day, while we were
away, the tree was struck by lightning.  Great limbs
were riven, and the nest was demolished.  I started to
rebuild, but the Swift One would have nothing to do
with it.  As I was to learn, she was greatly afraid of
lightning, and I could not persuade her back into the
tree.  So it came about, our honeymoon over, that we
went to the caves to live.  As Lop-Ear had evicted me
from the cave when he got married, I now evicted him;
and the Swift One and I settled down in it, while he
slept at night in the connecting passage of the double
cave.
<P>
And with our coming to live with the horde came
trouble.  Red-Eye had had I don't know how many wives
since the Singing One.  She had gone the way of the
rest.  At present he had a little, soft, spiritless
thing that whimpered and wept all the time, whether he
beat her or not; and her passing was a question of very
little time.  Before she passed, even, Red-Eye set his
eyes on the Swift One; and when she passed, the
persecution of the Swift One began.
<P>
Well for her that she was the Swift One, that she had
that amazing aptitude for swift flight through the
trees.  She needed all her wisdom and daring in order
to keep out of the clutches of Red-Eye. I could not
help her.  He was so powerful a monster that he could
have torn me limb from limb.  As it was, to my death I
carried an injured shoulder that ached and went lame in
rainy weather and that was a mark of is handiwork.
<P>
The Swift One was sick at the time I received this
injury.  It must have been a touch of the malaria from
which we sometimes suffered; but whatever it was, it
made her dull and heavy.  She did not have the
accustomed spring to her muscles, and was indeed in
poor shape for flight when Red-Eye cornered her near
the lair of the wild dogs, several miles south from the
caves.  Usually, she would have circled around him,
beaten him in the straight-away, and gained the
protection of our small-mouthed cave.  But she could
not circle him.  She was too dull and slow.  Each time
he headed her off, until she gave over the attempt and
devoted her energies wholly to keeping out of his
clutches.
<P>
Had she not been sick it would have been child's play
for her to elude him; but as it was, it required all
her caution and cunning. It was to her advantage that
she could travel on thinner branches than he, and make
wider leaps.  Also, she was an unerring judge of
distance, and she had an instinct for knowing the
strength of twigs, branches, and rotten limbs.
<P>
It was an interminable chase.  Round and round and back
and forth for long stretches through the forest they
dashed.  There was great excitement among the other
Folk.  They set up a wild chattering, that was loudest
when Red-Eye was at a distance, and that hushed when
the chase led him near.  They were impotent onlookers.
The females screeched and gibbered, and the males beat
their chests in helpless rage.  Big Face was especially
angry, and though he hushed his racket when Red-Eye
drew near, he did not hush it to the extent the others
did.
<P>
As for me, I played no brave part.  I know I was
anything but a hero.  Besides, of what use would it
have been for me to encounter Red-Eye? He was the
mighty monster, the abysmal brute, and there was no
hope for me in a conflict of strength.  He would have
killed me, and the situation would have remained
unchanged.  He would have caught the Swift One before
she could have gained the cave.  As it was, I could
only look on in helpless fury, and dodge out of the way
and cease my raging when he came too near.
<P>
The hours passed.  It was late afternoon.  And still
the chase went on.  Red-Eye was bent upon exhausting
the Swift One.  He deliberately ran her down.  After a
long time she began to tire and could no longer
maintain her headlong flight.  Then it was that she
began going far out on the thinnest branches, where he
could not follow.  Thus she might have got a breathing
spell, but Red-Eye was fiendish.  Unable to follow her,
he dislodged her by shaking her off.  With all his
strength and weight, he would shake the branch back and
forth until he snapped her off as one would snap a fly
from a whip-lash.  The first time, she saved herself by
falling into branches lower down.  Another time, though
they did not save her from the ground, they broke her
fall.  Still another time, so fiercely did he snap her
from the branch, she was flung clear across a gap into
another tree.  It was remarkable, the way she gripped
and saved herself.  Only when driven to it did she seek
the temporary safety of the thin branches.  But she was
so tired that she could not otherwise avoid him, and
time after time she was compelled to take to the thin
branches.
<P>
Still the chase went on, and still the Folk screeched,
beat their chests, and gnashed their teeth.  Then came
the end.  It was almost twilight.  Trembling, panting,
struggling for breath, the Swift One clung pitiably to
a high thin branch.  It was thirty feet to the ground,
and nothing intervened.  Red-Eye swung back and forth
on the branch farther down.  It became a pendulum,
swinging wider and wider with every lunge of his
weight.  Then he reversed suddenly, just before the
downward swing was completed. Her grips were torn
loose, and, screaming, she was hurled toward the
ground.
<P>
But she righted herself in mid-air and descended feet
first. Ordinarily, from such a height, the spring in
her legs would have eased the shock of impact with the
ground.  But she was exhausted. She could not exercise
this spring.  Her legs gave under her, having only
partly met the shock, and she crashed on over on her
side.  This, as it turned out, did not injure her, but
it did knock the breath from her lungs.  She lay
helpless and struggling for air.
<P>
Red-Eye rushed upon her and seized her.  With his
gnarly fingers twisted into the hair of her head, he
stood up and roared in triumph and defiance at the awed
Folk that watched from the trees. Then it was that I
went mad.  Caution was thrown to the winds; forgotten
was the will to live of my flesh.  Even as Red-Eye
roared, from behind I dashed upon him.  So unexpected
was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.  I
twined my arms and legs around him and strove to hold
him down.  This would have been impossible to
accomplish had he not held tightly with one hand to the
Swift One's hair.
<P>
Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden
ally.  He charged in, sank his teeth in Red-Eye's arm,
and ripped and tore at his face.  This was the time for
the rest of the Folk to have joined in.  It was the
chance to do for Red-Eye for all time.  But they
remained afraid in the trees.
<P>
It was inevitable that Red-Eye should win in the
struggle against the two of us.  The reason he did not
finish us off immediately was that the Swift One
clogged his movements.  She had regained her breath and
was beginning to resist.  He would not release his
clutch on her hair, and this handicapped him.  He got a
grip on my arm.  It was the beginning of the end for
me.  He began to draw me toward him into a position
where he could sink his teeth into my throat.  His
mouth was open, and he was grinning.  And yet, though
he had just begun to exert his strength, in that moment
he wrenched my shoulder so that I suffered from it for
the remainder of my life.
<P>
And in that moment something happened.  There was no
warning.  A great body smashed down upon the four of us
locked together.  We were driven violently apart and
rolled over and over, and in the suddenness of surprise
we released our holds on one another.  At the moment of
the shock, Big-Face screamed terribly.  I did not know
what had happened, though I smelled tiger and caught a
glimpse of striped fur as I sprang for a tree.
<P>
It was old Saber-Tooth.  Aroused in his lair by the
noise we had made, he had crept upon us unnoticed.  The
Swift One gained the next tree to mine, and I
immediately joined her.  I put my arms around her and
held her close to me while she whimpered and cried
softly.  From the ground came a snarling, and crunching
of bones. It was Saber-Tooth making his supper off of
what had been Big-Face.  From beyond, with inflamed
rims and eyes, Red-Eye peered down.  Here was a monster
mightier than he.  The Swift One and I turned and went
away quietly through the trees toward the cave, while
the Folk gathered overhead and showered down abuse and
twigs and branches upon their ancient enemy.  He lashed
his tail and snarled, but went on eating.
<P>
And in such fashion were we saved.  It was a mere
accident--the sheerest accident.  Else would I have
died, there in Red-Eye's clutch, and there would have
been no bridging of time to the tune of a thousand
centuries down to a progeny that reads newspapers and
rides on electric cars--ay, and that writes narratives
of bygone happenings even as this is written.
