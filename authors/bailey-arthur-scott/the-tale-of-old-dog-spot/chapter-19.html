<p>Great circus posters had covered one side of Farmer Green's barn for
weeks. Ever since some men came and pasted them on the barn Johnnie
Green had studied them carefully. He had practiced bareback riding on
his pony, Twinkleheels. He had tried a high dive into the mill pond from
the top of the dam. And much to old dog Spot's disgust Johnnie had tried
to make him jump through a hoop covered with paper.
</p>
<p>Spot had refused flatly to do anything of the kind. If he had known that
his young master had half a notion to teach him to jump through a hoop
of fire Spot would have run away--at least until circus time had come
and gone.
</p><p>"What puts all these queer ideas into Johnnie's head?" the old dog asked
his friend Ebenezer, the horse, one day.
</p><p>"Don't you know?" said Ebenezer. "It's those circus pictures. Johnnie
won't think of anything else until the twenty-third of August."
</p><p>"What's going to happen then?" Spot inquired.
</p><p>"That's the day when the circus comes to the village," the old horse
explained. "The whole family's going to see it."
</p><p>"Do you expect to take them?"
</p><p>"No!" Ebenezer replied. "Farmer Green will hitch the bays to the
carryall. And to tell the truth, I'll be just as pleased to stay behind.
It will be a great day to take naps here at home."
</p><p>"It will be a lonesome day, with everybody away," said Spot. "I believe
I'll go to the circus myself."
</p><p>"Farmer Green may decide to leave you here," the old horse suggested.
</p><p>"Then I'll surprise him," said Spot. "I'll hide behind a tree until
Farmer Green has driven out of the yard. And then I'll follow the
carryall."
</p><p>The old dog began to tell everybody in the farmyard that he was going to
the circus on the twenty-third of August. Of course some of the farmyard
folk were jealous of him. The Rooster remarked that he didn't believe
Spot would hear any <u>crowing</u> at the circus that would be worth
listening to. Turkey Proudfoot said that when it came to <u>strutting</u> the
circus couldn't show Spot any that couldn't be beaten right there on the
farm. And Henrietta Hen, who went to the county fair the year before,
declared that she shouldn't care to go to the village except to see a
poultry show.
</p><p>But old dog Spot didn't mind anything they said. And when the
twenty-third of August came he lingered about the farmyard. Early in the
morning he saw Farmer Green run the carryall into the yard and harness
the bays to it. Then the rest of the family came out of the house.
</p><p>Spot, from his hiding place behind a tree, was pleased to see that
Johnnie Green did not forget to bring a big lunch basket with him.
</p><p>At last everybody was ready to start. And then, to Spot's dismay, Farmer
Green caught sight of his nose, sticking out from behind a tree.
</p><p>"That dog means to follow us," he cried. "I'll have to shut him up in
the barn." And to old Spot he called, "Come here, sir!"
</p><p>Spot didn't dare disobey. With his tail between his legs he crept up to
the carryall. And though he whined and begged to be taken to the circus,
Farmer Green caught hold of his collar and led him into the barn. Then
Farmer Green closed the door.
</p><p>Poor Spot had to give one loud howl when he heard the wheels of the
carryall crunching on the gravel driveway.
