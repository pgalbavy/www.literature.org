<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

IT was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one, to see Joe 
arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss 
Havisham's. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to 
the occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better 
in his working dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so 
dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was 
for me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it 
made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of 
feathers. 

<p>At breakfast time my sister declared her intention of going to 
town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's, and called 
for `when we had done with our fine ladies' -- a way of putting the 
case, from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The 
forge was shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the 
door (as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he 
was not at work) the monosyllable H O U T, accompanied by a 
sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had 
taken. 

<p>We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large 
beaver bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England 
in plaited straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, 
though it was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these 
articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but, I rather 
think they were displayed as articles of property -- much as Cleo- 
patra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit 
her wealth in a pageant or procession. 

<p>When we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and 
left us. As it was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss 
Havisham's house. Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the mo- 
ment she appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by 
the brim in both his hands: as if he had some urgent reason in his 
mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce. 

<p>Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I 
knew so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I 
looked back at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his 
hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides 
on the tips of his toes. 

<p>Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the 
coat-cuffand conducted him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was 
seated at her dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately. 

<p>`Oh!' said she to Joe. `You are the husband of the sister of this 
boy?' 

<p>I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike 
himself or so like some extraordinary bird; standing, as he did, 
speechless, with his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open, as 
if he wanted a worm. 

<p>`You are the husband,' repeated Miss Havisham, `of the sister of 
this boy?' 

<p>It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview Joe 
persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham. 

<p>`Which I meantersay, Pip,' Joe now observed in a manner that 
was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, 
and great politeness, `as I hup and married your sister, and I were 
at the time what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a 
single man.' 

<p>`Well!' said Miss Havisham. `And you have reared the boy, with 
the intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr 
Gargery ? ' 

<p>`You know, Pip,' replied Joe, `as you and me were ever friends, 
and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to 
lead to larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections 
to the business -- such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like 
- not but what they would have been attended to, don't you see?' 

<p>`Has the boy,' said Miss Havisham, `ever made any objection? 
Does he like the trade?' 

<p>`Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,' returned Joe, 
strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, 
and politeness, `that it were the wish of your own hart.' (I saw 
the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph 
to the occasion, before he went on to say) `And there weren't no 
objection on your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your 
hart!' 

<p>It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible 
that he ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces 
and gestures to him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, 
and polite, he persisted in being to Me. 

<p>`Have you brought his indentures with you?'  asked Miss 
Havisham. 

<p>`Well Pip, you know,' replied Joe, as if that were a little un- 
reasonable, `you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore 
you know as they are here.' With which he took them out, and 
gave them, not to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was 
ashamed of the dear good fellow -- I <I>know</I> I was ashamed of him -- 
when I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, 
and that her eyes laughed mischievoualy. I took the indentures out 
of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham. 

<p>`You expected,' said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, 
`no premium with the boy?' 

<p>`Joe!' I remonstrated; for he made no reply at all. `Why don't 
you answer --' 

<p>`Pip,' returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, `which I 
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt 
yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full well 
No. You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?' 

<p>Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he 
really was, better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was 
there; and took up a little bag from the table beside her. 

<p>`Pip has earned a premium here,' she said, `and here it is. There 
are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, 
Pip.' 

<p>As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder 
awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, 
even at this pass, persisted in addressing me. 

<p>`This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,' said Joe, `and it is as 
such received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far 
nor near nor nowheres. And now, old chap,' said Joe, conveying 
to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt 
as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham; `and 
now, old chap, may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, 
both on us by one and another, and by them which your liberal 
present -- have -- conweyed -- to be -- for the satisfaction of mind -- 
of -- them as never --' here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen 
into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued himself 
with the words, `and from myself far be it!' These words had 
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them 
twice. 

<p>`Good-bye, Pip!' said Miss Havisham. `Let them out, Estella.' 

<p>`Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?' I asked. 

<p>`No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!' 

<p>Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say 
to Joe, in a distinct emphatic voice, `The boy has been a good boy 
here, and that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will 
expect no other and no more.' 

<p>How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to deter- 
mine; but, I know that when he did get out he was steadily pro- 
ceeding up-stairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all 
remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him. In 
another minute we were outside the gate, and it was locked, and 
Estella was gone. 

<p>When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up 
against a wall, and said to me, `Astonishing!' And there he re- 
mained so long, saying `Astonishing' at intervals, so often, that I 
began to think his senses were never coming back. At length he 
prolonged his remark into `Pip, I do assure <I>you</I> this is as-To N- 
ishing!' and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to 
walk away. 

<p>I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the 
encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to 
Pumblechook's he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason 
is to be found in what took place in Mr Pumblechook's parlour: 
where, on our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference 
with that detested seedsman. 

<p>`Well?' cried my sister, addressing us both at once. `And what's 
happened to you ? I wonder you condescend to come back to such 
poor society as this, I am sure I do!' 

<p>`Miss Havisham,' said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort 
of remembrance, `made it wery partick'ler that we should give her 
-- were it compliments or respects, Pip?' 

<p>`Compliments,' I said. 

<p>`Which that were my own belief,' answered Joe -- `her compli- 
ments to Mrs J. Gargery --' 

<p>`Much good they'll do me!' observed my sister; but rather grati- 
fied too. 

<p>`And wishing,' pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like 
another effort of remembrance, `that the state of Miss Havisham's 
elth were sitch as would have -- allowed, were it, Pip?' 

<p>`Of her having the pleasure,' I added. 

<p>`Of ladies' company,' said Joe. And drew a long breath. 

<p>`Well!' cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr Pumble- 
chook. `She might have had the politeness to send that message 
at first, but it's better late than never. And what did she give young 
Rantipole a here? ' 

<p>`She giv' him,' said Joe, `nothing.' 

<p>Mrs Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on. 

<p>`What she giv',' said Joe, `she giv' to his friends. ``And by his 
friends,'' were her explanation, ``I mean into the hands of his 
sister Mrs J. Gargery.'' Them were her words; ``Mrs J. Gargery.'' 
She mayn't have know'd,' added Joe, with an appearance of 
reflection, `whether it were Joe, or Jorge.' 

<p>My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of 
his wooden armchair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he 
had known all about it beforehand. 

<p>`And how much have you got?' asked my sister, laughing. 
Positively, laughing! 

<p>`What would present company say to ten pound?' demanded 
Joe. 

<p>`They'd say,' returned my sister, curtly, `pretty well. Not too 
much, but pretty well.' 

<p>`It's more than that, then,' said Joe. 

<p>That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and 
said, as he rubbed the arms of his chair: `It's more than that, Mum.' 

<p>`Why, you don't mean to say --' began my sister. 

<p>`Yes I do, Mum,' said Pumblechook; `but wait a bit. Go on, 
Joseph. Good in you! Go on!' 

<p>`What would present company say,' proceeded Joe, `to twenty 
pound?' 

<p>`Handsome would be the word,' returned my sister. 

<p>`Well, then,' said Joe, `It's more than twenty pound.' 

<p>That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, 
with a patronizing laugh, `It's more than that, Mum. Good againl 
Follow her up, Joseph!' 

<p>`Then to make an end of it,' said Joe, delightedly handing the 
bag to my sister; `it's five-and-twenty pound.' 

<p>`It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum,' echoed that basest of 
swindlers, Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; `and it's 
no more than your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), 
and I wish you joy of the money!' 

<p>If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been suffici- 
ently awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me 
into custody, with a right of patro nage that left all his former 
criminality far behind. 

<p>`Now you see, Joseph and wife,' said Pumblechook, as he took 
me by the arm above the elbow, `I am one of them that always go 
right through with what they've begun. This boy must be bound, 
out of hand. That's <I>my</I> way. Bound out of hand.' 

<p>`Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,' said my sister (grasp- 
ing the money), `we're deeply beholden to you.' 

<p>`Never mind me, Mum, returned that diabolical corn-chandler. 
`A pleasure's a pleasure, all the world over. But this boy, you 
know; we must have him bound. I said I'd see to it-- to tell you the 
truth.' 

<p>The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we 
at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the 
Magisterial presence. I say, we went over, but I was pushed over 
by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket 
or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression in Coutt that 
I had been taken red-handed, for, as Pumblechook shoved me 
before him through the crowd, I heard some people say, `What's he 
done?' and others, `He's a young 'un, too, but looks bad, don't 
he?' One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a 
tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man 
fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled, TO 
BE READ IN MY CELL. 

<p>The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it 
than a church -- and with people hanging over the pews looking 
on -- and with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning 
back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to aleep, 
or writing or reading the newspapers -- and with some shining 
black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a 
composition of hardbake and sticking-plaister. Here, in a corner, 
my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was `bound;' 
Mr Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in 
on our way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries 
disposed of. 

<p>When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who 
had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me 
publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that 
my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to 
Pumblechook's. And there my sister became so excited by the 
twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve her but we must 
have a dinner out of that windfall, at the Blue Boar, and that 
Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the 
Hubbles and Mr Wopsle. 

<p>It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. 
For, it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of 
the whole company, that I was an excrescence on the entertain- 
ment. And to make it worse, they all asked me from time to time -- 
in short, whenever they had nothing else to do -- why I didn't 
enjoy myself. And what could I possibly do then, but say I <I>was</I>
enjoying myself -- when I wasn't? 

<p>However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they 
made the most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into 
the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the 
top of the table; and, when he addressed them on the subject of my 
being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being 
liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, 
kept late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries 
which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next 
to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair beside him, to 
illustrate his remarks. 

<p>My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they 
wouldn't let me go to aleep, but whenever they saw me dropping 
off, woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in 
the evening Mr Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his blood- 
stain'd sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came 
in and said `The Commercials underneath sent up their compli- 
ments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.' That, they were all in 
excellent spirits on the road home, and sang O Lady Fair! Mr 
Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong 
voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of 
music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about 
everybody's private affairs) that <I>he</I> was the man with his white 
locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim 
going. 

<p>Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom l 
was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I 
should never like Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not 
now.
