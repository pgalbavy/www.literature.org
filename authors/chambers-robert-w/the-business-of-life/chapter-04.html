<p>When the doorbell rang the maid of all work pushed the button
and stood waiting at the top of the stairs. There was a pause,
a moment's whispering, then light footsteps flying through the
corridor, and:</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been for a week?" asked Cynthia Lessler,
coming into Jacqueline's little parlour, where the latter sat
knitting a white wool skating jacket for herself.</p>

<p>Jacqueline laid aside the knitting and greeted her visitor with
a warm, quick embrace.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been everywhere," she said. "Out in Westchester, mostly.
To-day being Sunday, I'm at home."</p>

<p>"What were you doing in the country, sweetness?"</p>

<p>"Business."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, cataloguing a collection. Take the armchair and sit near
the stove, dear. And here are the chocolates. Put your feet on
the fender as I do. It was frightfully cold in Westchester yesterday&mdash;everything
frozen solid&mdash;and we &mdash;I skated all over the flooded fields
and swamps. It was simply glorious, Cynthia&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I thought you were out there on business," remarked Cynthia
dryly.</p>

<p>"I was. I merely took an hour at noon for luncheon."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Even a bricklayer has an hour at noon to himself."</p>

<p>"Whose collection are you cataloguing?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to a Mr. Desboro," said Jacqueline carelessly.</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In his house&mdash;a big, old house about five miles from the station&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How do you get there?"</p>

<p>"They send a car for me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"They &mdash;Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"They? Is he plural?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," said Jacqueline. "It is his car and his collection,
and I'm having a perfectly good time with both."</p>

<p>"And with him, too? Yes?"</p>

<p>"If you knew him you wouldn't talk that way."</p>

<p>"I know who he is."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Jacqueline calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. He's the 'Jim' Desboro whose name you see in the
fashionable columns. I know something about <em>that</em> young
man," she added emphatically.</p>

<p>Jacqueline looked up at her with dawning displeasure. Cynthia,
undisturbed, bit into a chocolate and waved one pretty hand:</p>

<p>"Read the <em>Tattler</em>, as I do, and you'll see what sort
of a man your young man is."</p>

<p>"I don't care to read such a&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I do. It tells you funny things about society. Every week or
two there's something about him. You can't exactly understand
it&mdash;they put it in a funny way&mdash;but you can guess. Besides, he's
always going around town with Reggie Ledyard, and Stuyve Van Alstyne,
and &mdash;Jack Cairns&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Don't</em> speak that way&mdash;as though you usually lunched
with them. I hate it."</p>

<p>"How do you know I don't lunch with some of them? Besides everybody
calls them Reggie, and Stuyve, and Jack&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Everybody except their mothers, probably. I don't want to hear
about them, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why not, darling?"</p>

<p>"Because you and I don't know them and never will&#11834;"</p>

<p>Cynthia said maliciously: "You may meet them through your friend,
Jimmy Desboro&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> is the limit!" exclaimed Jacqueline, flushing;
and her pretty companion leaned back in her armchair and laughed
until Jacqueline's unwilling smile began to glimmer in her wrath-darkened
eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't torment me, Cynthia," she said. "You know quite well that
it's a business matter with me entirely."</p>

<p>"Was it a business matter with that Dawley man? You had to get
me to go with you into that den of his whenever you went at all."</p>

<p>Jacqueline shrugged and resumed her knitting: "What a horrid
thing he was," she murmured.</p>

<p>Cynthia assented philosophically: "But most men bother a girl
sooner or later," she concluded. "You don't read about it in novels,
but it's true. Go down town and take dictation for a living. It's
an education in how to look out for yourself."</p>

<p>"It's a rotten state of things," said Jacqueline under her breath.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's funny, too. So many men <em>are</em> that way. What
do they care? Do you suppose we'd be that way, too, if we were
men?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'There are nice men, too'"]</p>

<p>"No. There are nice men, too."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;dead ones."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"With very few exceptions, Jacqueline. There are horrid, <em>horrid</em>
ones, and <em>nice</em>, horrid ones, and dead ones and <em>dead</em>
ones&mdash;but only a few nice, <em>nice</em> ones. I've known some.
You think your Mr. Desboro is one, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't thought about him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Honestly, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I haven't! He's nice to <em>me</em>. That's all I
know."</p>

<p>"Is he <em>too</em> nice?"</p>

<p>"No. Besides, he's under his own roof. And it depends on a girl,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Not always. If we behave ourselves we're dead ones; if we don't
we'd better be. Isn't it a rotten deal, Jacqueline! Just one fresh
man after another dropped into the discards because he gets too
gay. And being employed by the kind who'd never marry us spoils
us for the others. <em>You</em> could marry one of your clients,
I suppose, but I never could in a million years."</p>

<p>"You and I will never marry such men," said Jacqueline coolly.
"Perhaps we wouldn't if they asked us."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> might. You're educated and bright, and&mdash;you <em>look</em>
the part, with all the things you know&mdash;and your trips to Europe&mdash;and
the kind of beauty yours is. Why not? If I were you," she added,
"I'd kill a man who thought me good enough to hold hands with,
but not good enough to marry."</p>

<p>"I don't hold hands," observed Jacqueline scornfully.</p>

<p>"I do. I've done it when it was all right; and I've done it when
I had no business to; and the chances are I'll do it again without
getting hurt. And then I'll finally marry the sort of man you
call Ed," she added disgustedly.</p>

<p>Jacqueline laughed, and looked intently at her: "You're <em>so</em>
pretty, Cynthia&mdash;and so silly sometimes."</p>

<p>Cynthia stretched her young figure full length in the chair,
yawning and crooking both arms back under her curly brown head.
Her eyes, too, were brown, and had in them always a half-veiled
languor that few men could encounter undisturbed.</p>

<p>"A week ago," she said, "you told me over the telephone that
you would be at the dance. <em>I</em> never laid eyes on you."</p>

<p>"I came home too tired. It was my first day at Silverwood. I
overdid it, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"Where I go to business in Westchester," she explained patiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Desboro's place!" with laughing malice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Desboro's place."</p>

<p>The hint of latent impatience in Jacqueline's voice was not lost
on Cynthia; and she resumed her tormenting inquisition:</p>

<p>"How long is it going to take you to catalogue Mr. Desboro's
collection?"</p>

<p>"I have several weeks' work, I think &mdash;I don't know exactly."</p>

<p>"All winter, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Is <em>he</em> always there, darling?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline was visibly annoyed: "He has happened to be, so far.
I believe he is going South very soon&mdash;if that interests you."</p>

<p>"'Phone me when he goes," retorted Cynthia, unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"What makes you say such things!" exclaimed Jacqueline. "I tell
you he isn't that kind of a man."</p>

<p>"Read the <em>Tattler</em>, dearest!"</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever read it?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Curiosity."</p>

<p>"I haven't any."</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed incredulously:</p>

<p>"People who have no curiosity are either idiots or they have
already found out. Now, you are not an idiot."</p>

<p>Jacqueline smiled: "And I haven't found out, either."</p>

<p>"Then you're just as full of curiosity as the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Not of unworthy curiosity&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I never knew a good person who wasn't. I'm good, am I not, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'm full of all kinds of curiosities&mdash;worthy and
unworthy. I want to know about everything!"</p>

<p>"Everything good."</p>

<p>"Good and bad. God lets both exist. I want to know about them."</p>

<p>"Why be curious about what is bad? It doesn't concern us."</p>

<p>"If you know what concerns you only, you'll never know anything.
Now, when I read a newspaper I read about fashionable weddings,
millionaires, shows, murders &mdash;I read everything&mdash;not because
I'm going to be fashionably married, or become a millionaire or
a murderer, but because all these things exist and happen, and
I want to know all about them because I'm not an idiot, and I
haven't already found out. And so that's why I buy the <em>Tattler</em>
whenever I have five cents to spend on it!"</p>

<p>"It's a pity you're not more curious about things worth while,"
commented Jacqueline serenely.</p>

<p>Cynthia reddened: "Dear, I haven't the education or brain to
be interested in the things that occupy you."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," protested Jacqueline, embarrassed. "I only&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know, dear. You are too sweet to say it; but it's true. The
bunch you play with knows it. We all realise that you are way
ahead of us&mdash;that you're different&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say that&mdash;or think it."</p>

<p>"But it's true. You really belong with the others&mdash;" she made
a gay little gesture&mdash;"over there in the Fifth Avenue district,
where art gets gay with fashion; where lady highbrows wear tiaras;
where the Jims and Jacks and Reggies float about and hand each
other new ones between quarts; where you belong, darling&mdash;wherever
you finally land!"</p>

<p>Jacqueline was laughing: "But I don't wish to land <em>there</em>!
I never wanted to."</p>

<p>"All girls do! We all dream about it!"</p>

<p>"Here is one girl who really doesn't. Of course, I'd like to
have a few friends of that kind. I'd rather like to visit houses
where nobody has to think of money, and where young people are
jolly, and educated, and dress well, and talk about interesting
things&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dear, we all would like it. That's what I'm saying. Only there's
a chance for you because you know something&mdash;but none for us.
We understand that perfectly well&mdash;and we dream on all the same.
We'd miss a lot if we didn't dream."</p>

<p>Jacqueline said mockingly: "I'll invite you to my Fifth Avenue
residence the minute I marry what you call a Reggie."</p>

<p>"I'll come if you'll stand for me. I'm not afraid of any Reggie
in the bench show!"</p>

<p>They laughed; Cynthia stretched out a lazy hand for another chocolate;
Jacqueline knitted, the smile still hovering on her scarlet lips.</p>

<p>Bending over her work, she said: "You won't misunderstand when
I tell you how much I enjoy being at Silverwood, and how nice
Mr. Desboro has been."</p>

<p>"<em>Has</em> been."</p>

<p>"Is, and surely will continue to be," insisted Jacqueline tranquilly.
"Shall I tell you about Silverwood?"</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mr. Desboro has such a funny old housekeeper there,
who gives me 'magic drops' on lumps of sugar. The drops are aromatic
and harmless, so I take them to please her. And he has an old,
old butler, who is too feeble to be very useful; and an old, old
armourer, who comes once a week and potters about with a bit of
chamois; and a parlour maid who is sixty and wears glasses; and
a laundress still older. And a whole troop of dogs and cats come
to luncheon with us. Sometimes the butler goes to sleep in the
pantry, and Mr. Desboro and I sit and talk. And if he doesn't
wake up, Mr. Desboro hunts about for somebody to wait on us. Of
course there are other servants there, and farmers and gardeners,
too. Mr. Desboro has a great deal of land. And so," she chattered
on quite happily and irrelevantly, "we go skating for half an
hour after lunch before I resume my cataloguing. He skates very
well; we are learning to waltz on skates&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who does the teaching?"</p>

<p>"He does. I don't skate very well; and unless it were for him
I'd have <em>such</em> tumbles! And once we went sleighing&mdash;that
is, he drove me to the station&mdash;in rather a roundabout way. And
the country was <em>so</em> beautiful! And the stars&mdash;oh, millions
and millions, Cynthia! It was as cold as the North Pole, but I
loved it&mdash;and I had on his other fur coat and gloves. He is very
nice to me. I wanted you to understand the sort of man he is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is the original hundredth man," remarked Cynthia
skeptically.</p>

<p>"Most men are hundredth men when the nine and ninety girls behave
themselves. It's the hundredth girl who makes the nine and ninety
men horrid."</p>

<p>"That's what you believe, is it?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Dream on, dear." She went to a glass, pinned her pretty hat,
slipped into the smart fur coat that Jacqueline held for her,
and began to draw on her gloves.</p>

<p>"Can't you stay to dinner," asked Jacqueline.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sweetness, but I'm dining at the Beaux Arts."</p>

<p>"With any people I know?"</p>

<p>"You don't know that particular 'people'," said Cynthia, smiling,
"but you know a friend of his."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"Really!" she said, colouring.</p>

<p>Cynthia frowned at her: "Don't become sentimental over that young
man!"</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"Because I don't think he's very much good."</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em>&mdash;but I <em>won't</em>," explained Jacqueline
laughing. "I know quite well how to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;know."</p>

<p>"Cynthia! Of course you know!"</p>

<p>"Do I? Well, perhaps I do. Perhaps all girls know how to take
care of themselves. But sometimes&mdash;especially when their home
life is the limit&#11834;" She hesitated, slowly twisting a hairpin
through the buttonhole of one glove. Then she buttoned it decisively.
"When things got so bad at home two years ago, and I went with
that show&mdash;you didn't see it&mdash;you were in mourning&mdash;but it ran
on Broadway all winter. And I met one or two Reggies at suppers,
and another man&mdash;the same sort&mdash;only his name happened to be Jack&mdash;and
I want to tell you it was hard work not to like him."</p>

<p>Jacqueline stood, slim and straight, and silent, listening unsmilingly.</p>

<p>Cynthia went on leisurely:</p>

<p>"He was a friend of Mr. Desboro&mdash;the same kind of man, I suppose.
<em>That's</em> why I read the <em>Tattler</em>&mdash;to see what they
say about him."</p>

<p>"Wh-what do they say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, things&mdash;funny sorts of things, about his being attentive
to this girl, and being seen frequently with that girl. I don't
know what they mean exactly&mdash;they always make it sound queer&mdash;as
though all the men and women in society are fast. And this man,
too&mdash;perhaps he is."</p>

<p>"But what do you care, dear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It was hard work not to like him. You don't understand
how it was; you've always lived at home. But home was hell for
me; and I was getting fifteen per; and it grew horribly cold that
winter. I had no fire. Besides&mdash;it was so hard not to like him.
I used to come to see you. Do you remember how I used to come
here and cry?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I thought it was because you had been so unhappy at
home."</p>

<p>"Partly. The rest was&mdash;the other thing."</p>

<p>"You <em>did</em> like him, then!"</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;too much."</p>

<p>"I understand that. But it's over now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Cynthia stood idly turning her muff between her white-gloved
hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, after a moment, "it's over. But I'm thinking
how nearly over it was with me, once or twice that winter. I thought
I knew how to take care of myself. But a girl never knows, Jacqueline.
Cold, hunger, debt, shabby clothes are bad enough; loneliness
is worse. Yet, these are not enough, by themselves. But if we
like a man, with all that to worry over&mdash;then it's pretty hard
on us."</p>

<p>"How <em>could</em> you care for a bad man?"</p>

<p>"Bad? Did I say he was? I meant he was like other men. A girl
becomes accustomed to men."</p>

<p>"And likes them, notwithstanding?"</p>

<p>"Some of them. It depends. If you like a man you seem to like
him anyhow. You may get angry, too, and still like him. There's
so much of the child in them. I've learned that. They're bad;
but when you like one of them, he seems to belong to you, somehow&mdash;badness
and all. I must be going, dear."</p>

<p>Still, neither moved; Cynthia idly twirled her muff; Jacqueline,
her slender hands clasped behind her, stood gazing silently at
the floor.</p>

<p>Cynthia said: "That's the trouble with us all. I'm afraid you
like this man, Desboro. I tell you that he isn't much good; but
if you already like him, you'll go on liking him, no matter what
I say or what he does. For it's that way with us, Jacqueline.
And where in the world would men find a living soul to excuse
them if it were not for us? That seems to be about all we're for&mdash;to
forgive men what they are&mdash;and what they do."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't forgive them," said Jacqueline fiercely; "&mdash;or
women, either."</p>

<p>"Oh, nobody forgives women! But you will find excuses for some
man some day&mdash;if you like him. I guess even the best of them require
it. But the general run of them have got to have excuses made
for them, or no woman would stand for her own honeymoon, and marriages
would last about a week. Good-bye, dear."</p>

<p>They kissed.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs outside, Jacqueline kissed her again.</p>

<p>"How is the play going?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's going."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance for you to get a better part?"</p>

<p>"No chance I care to take. Max Schindler is like all the rest
of them."</p>

<p>Jacqueline's features betrayed her wonder and disgust, but she
said nothing; and presently Cynthia turned and started down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear," she called back, with a gay little flourish
of her muff. "They're all alike&mdash;only we always forgive the one
we care for!"</p>
