<p>It always seemed to Jethro Juggens that Kenton took a great deal
more pains or used a greater degree of caution than was necessary
when he undertook a task in which Indians were concerned. The
density of the African's intellect did not blind him to the need
of using caution or care in dealing with the treacherous people,
but the excessive timidity of so active or powerful a man as the
pioneer struck the dusky youth unfavorably.</p>

<p>"He tinks dat dat canoe am ober yender, somewhar near dat flatboat,"
mused Jethro, several minutes after the departure of the scout;
"I has a little ob dat 'pinion myself. It wouldn't take more dan
five minutes to run across to de oder side. Dat's what he oughter
do, but instead ob dat he goes clear round de clearing frough
de woods&mdash;de most obfoolishest ting dat he could do. He runs de
risk ob steppin' on a rattlesnake and gettin' stung, or ob catchin'
a limb under his chin and liftin' him offen his feet and droppin'
him on his back wid a violence dat will shake all de teeth out
ob his head."</p>

<p>The reader has learned the success of the plan adopted by Kenton.</p>

<p>"I don't feel perzactly right ober dis bus'ness," muttered Jethro,
some minutes later. "I come along to help look after Mr. Kenton,
and when de danger comes I let him slip away without me.</p>

<p>"He played de boss fust ober me, which am all right, 'cause dat
am de way to fix dem tings, but it's 'bout time my turn come."</p>

<p>An expression of displeasure passed over the ebon countenance.</p>

<p>"He told me I musn't speak nor move nor breve. Dar ain't no sense
in dat. Den he gib me percumission to breve. 'Sposen he hadn't
done so, what would hab come of me? I couldn't hold my bref for
free, four hours while he war gone. As for movin' and talkin',
I hab already done dat, so dar ain't no use ob tinting any more
'bout it."</p>

<p>It was really a relief to reflect that he had violated all the
commands laid upon him, for the fact ended the mental struggle
which might have continued indefinitely. Inasmuch, therefore,
as the bars were down, the disobedience grew or expanded.</p>

<p>Kenton, before parting with the servant, made sure he was in
a place where there was little danger of discovery. The undergrowth
was so dense that no one was likely to pass through it except
in case of necessity, for work would be saved by making a much
longer tour around. It was quite near the river, on the margin
of the clearing, though far enough from the latter to prevent
the fellow being seen if he used only ordinary prudence.</p>

<p>In open violation of his orders, Jethro made his way to the open
space, putting forth no special precaution in doing so, and peered
around. There was nothing in the appearance of the flatboat to
interest him, nor could he note any change in the looks of the
cabin.</p>

<p>"I don't feel dat dis matter am gwine right," he mused, returning
to his former position; "I'se gettin' worried 'bout Mr. Kenton;
it war understood dat I war to go 'long to help took care ob him,
and dar's no knowing what trouble he'll get into."</p>

<p>Enough had passed between the two before their separation for
Jethro to understand quite clearly the scheme he had in mind.
He knew the ranger meant to take the longest way round to the
other side of the clearing, throwing away, in the estimation of
the African, a great deal of time and effort.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Jethro did not yield to his impulse to solve the
matter by striding across the open space and making a hunt himself
for the cause that was destined to play a most important part
in the fortunes of the pioneers. Thus, a calamity, far-reaching
in its consequences, was averted.</p>

<p>But a few minutes more of reflection induced the youth to do
something hardly less dangerous or ill-advised.</p>

<p>He decided to follow after Kenton, taking the same course and
making for the same destination.</p>

<p>"It'll s'prise him," thought Jethro, with a grin, "when I sort
of whistle, and he looks round and sees me standin' dar smilin'
at him. I'll doot!"</p>

<p>The youth was not sufficiently skilled in woodcraft to follow
the ranger by means of his trail. Indeed, there was no need of
his doing so, since the course was well known to him.</p>

<p>It was not without some misgiving that Jethro started upon his
venture, for, despite his sophistries, he knew he was quite likely
to incur the displeasure of Kenton, who had shown more than once
a partiality toward him. If any disaster followed, the youth knew
he would be blamed. It was his task, therefore, so to conduct
himself that only the best results should flow from his violation
of orders.</p>

<p>Jethro kept well back among the trees while circling around the
clearing. The increased light on his right was all the guide he
needed, even had he not gained a slight acquaintance with the
section by his stirring experience earlier in the day.</p>

<p>Now and then he approached near enough to the cleared space to
see the cabin, and thus took hardly a step without fully knowing
where he was. At a point in a line with the cabin and the flatboat
beyond, he came to a halt and glanced at his immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>"Dis is 'bout de spot whar I stood when I plugged dat Injun,
and," added Jethro, with a chuckle, "whar I scooped de shirt dat
dat Girty hung out to dry. Dey tried to make b'leve aftwards dat
it war a flag ob trooce, meanin' dat dey wanted us all to stop
shootin' while we had a talk wid each oder; dey fooled Kenton
and de rest ob de folks, but dey didn't fool dis chile."</p>

<p>He found a fascination in studying the rear of the cabin, which
George Ashbridge and his father had builded with so much care
and labor.</p>

<p>"Lucky for me dat I wasn't wid' em," reflected Jethro, "for if
I had been dey would hab sat 'round while I done all de work.
Mighty strange dat eberybody tinks I'm good fur nuffin but work,
but dey done forgot dat I knows how to shoot a gun as well as
oder folks."</p>

<p>He stood for a minute or two in deep thought. He was revolving
an important scheme in his mind.</p>

<p>"From de style dat Mr. Kenton moved wid when he luff me, it'll
take him 'bout two days to git 'round to where he's gwine to find
dat canoe, consequinchly dar ain't no use ob my being in such
a hurry dat I'll broke my neck. I'll take a look inside dat house
to make sure dat matters am all right."</p>

<p>And without the first hesitation he proceeded to carry out his
extraordinary purpose.</p>

<p>He first approached the rear of the cabin, where, it will be
remembered, were two windows on the lower floor and two on the
upper. Each of these was too narrow to permit any man to force
his body through. It was from one of the lower ones that Simon
Girty had displayed the flag of truce, only to have it whipped
off the ramrod and appropriated by the watchful Jethro, who, after
wearing the garment for a time, laid it aside in order to escape
the merriment his appearance caused for the others.</p>

<p>The dusky youth peeped through the opening at the interior, where
the furniture and goods were tumbled about in great confusion.
The view was unsatisfactory, and he passed around to the front,
with the intention of entering by means of the door.</p>

<p>There are unnumbered incidents continually occurring, as they
have occurred in the past, in which luck seems to play a most
prominent part. We doubt whether any other explanation can be
made of the extraordinary series of events in which Jethro Juggens
now became involved, and which were destined to have a momentous
bearing upon the fortunes of his friends, beyond even the calculations
of the sagacious Boone and Kenton.</p>

<p>It is probable that had the colored youth presented himself in
front of the door a half-hour sooner, he not only would have been
instantly detected by some of the Shawanoes, but would have been
slain. It is certain that had he delayed his movements for a less
time than that named these consequences would have followed, for
the reader has learned that before the warrior guarding the canoe
fell asleep he showed a good deal of interest in the cabin in
the clearing.</p>

<p>But Jethro's action was so timed (without any credit due to himself)
that he escaped both perils, as well as that of being seen by
Kenton, who, it will be remembered, gave considerable attention
to the same quarter. It is hard to imagine what his feelings would
have been, had the scout turned his gaze towards the building
at the moment the colored youth came around the corner and walked
to the front door.</p>

<p>"Dat's right," muttered Jethro, when he noted the latch-string
hanging out; "dat makes it discumnecessary for me to kick in de
door."</p>

<p>The leathern thong was smartly twitched, the door shoved gently
inward, and, with a slightly quickened throbbing of the heart,
Jethro Juggens stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p>Boxes of varying sizes were broken apart, or scattered here or
there about the lower floor. Near the broad, spacious fireplace
were a number of pots, kettles, a crane, and irons, or other simple
utensils, such as were used by our forefathers. The whole floor
was so cluttered up that care was necessary in moving about the
circumscribed space.</p>

<p>The sloping ladder leading to the upper floor was in place, but
little, if anything, had been carried thither. The time, of course,
was too brief to permit it.</p>

<p>Jethro peeped through the windows in turn, but discovered nothing
to cause alarm. Then, it may be said, he did his first sensible
act of the day; he pulled in the latch-string to prevent an enemy
stealing upon him unawares.</p>

<p>A chuckle escaped the youngster when his eye rested upon a box
containing what was left of the bread that had furnished the pioneers
with their last meal. Leaning his rifle against the wall, he clutched
a goodly-sized loaf of the dark, wholesome staff of life, and
buried his big, perfect teeth in it, crunching crust and lighter
portion as though they were the most tender and delicious fruits.</p>

<p>Stretching out upon the hard floor, which served him as well
as a bed of eider-down, he sank into a deep, peaceful slumber,
with no thought of the consequences that were certain to flow
from this unprecedented action upon his part.</p>

<p>By this time the long summer day was drawing to a close. When
darkness finally settled over forest and river, Jethro Juggens
was still sleeping.</p>
