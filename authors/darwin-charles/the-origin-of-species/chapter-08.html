THE view generally entertained by naturalists is
that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with the
quality of sterility, in order to prevent the confusion of all organic
forms. This view certainly seems at first probable, for species within
the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable
of crossing freely. The importance of the fact that hybrids are very
generally sterile, has, I think, been much underrated by some late
writers. On the theory of natural selection the case is especially
important, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be
of any advantage to them, and therefore could not have been acquired
by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of
sterility.  I hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is not
a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is incidental on other
acquired differences.

<P>
In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent
fundamentally different, have generally been confounded together;
namely, the sterility of two 
species when first crossed, and the
sterility of the hybrids produced from them.

<P>
Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a
perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no
offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive
organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the
state of the male element in both plants and animals; though the
organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope
reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form
the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all
developed, or are imperfectly developed. This distinction is
important, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two
cases, has to be considered. The distinction has probably been slurred
over, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a
special endowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.

<P>
The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed
to have descended from common parents, when intercrossed, and 
likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of
equal importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a
broad and clear distinction between varieties and species.

<P>
First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their
hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and
works of those two conscientious and admirable observers,
K&ouml;lreuter and G&auml;rtner, who almost devoted their lives to
this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality
of some degree of sterility. K&ouml;lreuter makes the rule universal;
but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two
forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile
together, he 
unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. G&auml;rtner,
also, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire
fertility of K&ouml;lreuter's ten cases. But in these and in many
other cases, G&auml;rtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in
order to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always
compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when
crossed and by their hybrid offspring, with the average number
produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. But a
serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a plant to
be hybridised must be castrated, and, what is often more important,
must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by
insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimentised on by
G&auml;rtner were potted, and apparently were kept in a chamber in his
house. That these  processes are often injurious to the
fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for G&auml;rtner gives in his
table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and
artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all
cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged
difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their
fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as G&auml;rtner during
several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we
have such good reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or
twice succeeded in getting fertile seed; as he found the common red
and blue pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best
botanists rank as varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he
came to the same conclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems
to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other
species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as G&auml;rtner
believes.

<P>
It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various
species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so
insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species
is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical
purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and
sterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be required
than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived,
namely, K&ouml;lreuter and G&auml;rtner, should have arrived at
diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species.
It is also most instructive to compare   but I have not space
here to enter on details   the evidence advanced by our best
botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be
ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility
adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author, from
experiments made during different years.  It can thus be shown that
neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between
species and varieties; but that the evidence from this source
graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence
derived from other constitutional and structural differences.

<P>
In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations;
though G&auml;rtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully
guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six
or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts
positively that their fertility never increased, but generally greatly
decreased. I do not doubt that this is usually the case, and that the
fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations.
Nevertheless I believe that in all these experiments the fertility has
been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from close
interbreeding. I have collected so large a body of facts, showing 
that
close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand, that an
occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases
fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this almost
universal belief amongst breeders. Hybrids are seldom raised by
experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other
allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of
insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence
hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their
own individual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious
to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am
strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly
made by G&auml;rtner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be
artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their
fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation,
sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in
artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know
from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from
the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a
cross between two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be
thus effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in
progress, so careful an observer as G&auml;rtner would have castrated
his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross
with the pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or
from another plant of the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange
fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of
<I>artificially fertilised</I> hybrids may, I
believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided.

<P>
Now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most
experienced hybridiser, namely, the Hon. and 
Rev. W.
Herbert. He is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are
perfectly fertile   as fertile as the pure parent-species
  as are K&ouml;lreuter and G&auml;rtner that some degree of
sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. He
experimentised on some of the very same species as did G&auml;rtner.
The difference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for
by Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hothouses at
his command. Of his many important statements I will here give only a
single one as an example, namely, that 'every ovule in a pod of Crinum
capense fertilised by C.  revolutum produced a plant, which (he says)
I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation.' So that we
here have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect, fertility in a
first cross between two distinct species.

<P>
This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact,
namely, that there are individual plants, as with certain species of
Lobelia, and with all the species of the genus Hippeastrum, which can
be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct
species, than by their own pollen. For these plants have been found to
yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species, though quite sterile
with their own pollen, notwithstanding that their own pollen was found
to be perfectly good, for it fertilised distinct species. So that
certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species
can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be
self-fertilised! For instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced
four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen,
and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound
hybrid descended from three other and distinct species: the result was
that 'the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and
after a 
few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by the
pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to
maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.' In a letter to
me, in 1839, Mr Herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment
during five years, and he continued to try it during several
subsequent years, and always with the same result. This result
has, also,  been confirmed by other observers in the case
of Hippeastrum with its sub-genera, and in the case of some other
genera, as Lobelia, Passiflora and Verbascum. Although the plants in
these experiments appeared perfectly healthy, and although both the
ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect
to other species, yet as they were functionally imperfect in their
mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural
state.  Nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious
causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed, in
comparison with the same species when self-fertilised, sometimes
depends.

<P>
The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with
scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how
complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,
Petunia, Rhododendron, &amp;c., have been crossed, yet many of these
hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from
Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely
dissimilar in general habit, 'reproduced itself as perfectly as if it
had been a natural species from the mountains of Chile.' I have taken
some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex
crosses of Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are
perfectly fertile. Mr C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he
raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid 
between Rhod. Ponticum and
Catawbiense, and that this hybrid 'seeds as freely as it is possible
to imagine.' Had hybrids, when fairly treated, gone on decreasing in
fertility in each successive generation, as G&auml;rtner believes to
be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen.
Horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids, and such alone
are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals of
the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other,
and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented.
Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of
insect-agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of
hybrid rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on
their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.

<P>
In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been 
carefully tried than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can
be trusted, that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each
other, as are the genera of plants, then we may infer that animals
more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily
crossed than in the case of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I
think, more sterile. I doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile
hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated. It
should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding
freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for
instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine other finches,
but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement, we
have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the
canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with
respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile
hybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of
the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different
parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the
contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each
successive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated
admonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is not at all
surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone
on increasing. If we were to act thus, and pair brothers and sisters
in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause had the least
tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few
generations.

<P>
Although I do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases
of perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have some reason to believe
that the hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from
Phasianus colchicus with p.  torquatus and with p. versicolor are
perfectly fertile. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A.
cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally
ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either
pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred <I>inter se.</I>
This was effected by Mr Eyton, who
raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches;
and from these two birds he raised no less than  eight
hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India,
however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am
assured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr Blyth and Capt.
Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various
parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither
pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly fertile.

<P>
A doctrine which originated with Pallas, has been 
largely accepted
by modern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have
descended from two or more aboriginal species, since commingled by
intercrossing. On this view, the aboriginal species must either at
first have produced quite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have
become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication.
This latter alternative seems to me the most probable, and I am
inclined to believe in its truth, although its rests on no direct
evidence. I believe, for instance, that our dogs have descended from
several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain
indigenous domestic dogs of South America, all are quite fertile
together; and analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the several
aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have
produced quite fertile hybrids. So again there is reason to believe
that our European and the humped Indian cattle are quite fertile
together; but from facts communicated to me by Mr Blyth, I think they
must be considered as distinct species.  On this view of the origin of
many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the
almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when
crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible
characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication.

<P>
Finally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing
of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of
sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely
general result; but that it cannot, under our present state of
knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal.
<P>
<I>Laws governing the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids.</I> 
We will now consider a little more in detail the 
circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses
and of hybrids.   Our chief object will be to see whether
or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed
with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and blending
together in utter confusion. The following rules and conclusions are
chiefly drawn up from G&auml;rtner's admirable work on the
hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far
the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge
is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how
generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.

<P>
It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of
first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect
fertility. It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation
can be shown to exist; but only the barest outline of the facts can
here be given. When pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the
stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence
than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the
pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of
some one species, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds
produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility; and,
as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of
fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen will produce. So
in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and
probably never would produce, even with the pollen of either pure
parent, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a first
trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure
parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than
it otherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is
well known to be a sign 
of incipient fertilisation. From this extreme
degree of sterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a
greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility.

<P>
Hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and
which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but
the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and
the sterility of the hybrids thus produced   two classes of 
facts which are generally confounded together   is by no means
strict. There are many cases, in which two pure species can be
united with unusual facility, and produce numerous
hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the
other hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or
with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are
very fertile. Even within the limits of the same genus, for instance
in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.

<P>
The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily
affected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure
species. But the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable;
for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed
under the same circumstances, but depends in part upon the
constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for
the experiment. So it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility
is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised
from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same
conditions.

<P>
By the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between
species in structure and in constitution, more especially in the
structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and
which differ little in the allied species. Now the fertility of first
crosses 
between species, and of the hybrids produced from them, is
largely governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown
by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by
systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very
closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the
correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of
crossing is by no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given of
very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with extreme
difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite
with the utmost facility. In the same family there may be a genus, as
Dianthus, in which very many species can most readily be crossed; and
another genus, as Silene, in which the most persevering efforts have
failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid.
Even within the limits of the same genus, we meet with this same
difference; for instance, the many species of Nicotiana have been more
largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus; but
G&auml;rtner found that N. acuminata, which is not  a
particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to
be fertilised by, no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Very
many analogous facts could be given.

<P>
No one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of
difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two
species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in
habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences
in every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in
the cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous
and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted
for extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.

<P>
By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for
instance, of a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass,
and then a male-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to
have been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible
difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases
are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two
species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic
affinity, or of any recognisable difference in their whole
organisation. On the other hand, these cases clearly show that the
capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences
imperceptible by us, and confined to the reproductive system. This
difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two
species was long ago observed by K&ouml;lreuter. To give an instance:
Mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M.
longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but
K&ouml;lreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight
following years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the
pollen of M. jalappa, and utterly failed. Several other equally
striking cases could be given. Thuret has observed the same fact with
certain sea-weeds or Fuci. G&auml;rtner, moreover, found that this
difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely
common in a lesser degree. He has observed it even between forms so
closely related (as Matthiola annua and glabra) that many botanists
rank them only as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact, that
hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of
 the very same two species, the one species having first
been used as the father and then as the mother, generally differ
in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree.

<P>
Several other singular rules could be given from 
G&auml;rtner: for
instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other
species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of
impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two
powers do not at all necessarily go together. There are certain
hybrids which instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate
character between their two parents, always closely resemble one of
them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure
parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. So again
amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between
their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are
born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and these
hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other hybrids
raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of
fertility.  These facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is
independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.

<P>
Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility
of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be
considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility
graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under
certain conditions in excess. That their fertility, besides being
eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is
innately variable. That it is by no means always the same in degree in
the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross. That the
fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they
resemble in external appearance either parent. And lastly, that the
facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always
governed by their systematic affinity or 
degree of resemblance to each
other. This latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses
between the same two species, for according as the one species or the
other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some
difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference,
in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids,
moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.

<P>
Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have
been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming
confounded in nature?  I think not. For why should the sterility be so
extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all
of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from
blending together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately
variable in the individuals of the same species? Why should some
species cross with facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and
other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly
fertile hybrids? Why should there often be so great a difference in
the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it
may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted?  To
grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and then to
stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility, not
strictly related to the facility of the first union between their
parents, seems to be a strange arrangement.

<P>
The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me
clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of
hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences,
chiefly in the reproductive systems, of the species which are crossed.
The differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, 
that, in
reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the
one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other,
but not in a reversed direction. It will be advisable to explain a
little more fully by an example what I mean by sterility being
incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed quality.
As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so
entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature, I presume
that no one will suppose that this capacity is a <I>
specially</I> endowed quality, but will admit that it
is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants.
We can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another,
from differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their
wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, &amp;c.; but
in a  multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever.
Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the
other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and
adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the
two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the
capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able
to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families; and, on
the other hand, closely allied species, and varieties of the same
species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But
this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed
by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within the same
family have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same
genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted far more
readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on
the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even different
varieties of the pear take 
with different degrees of facility on the
quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain
varieties of the plum.

<P>
As G&auml;rtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference
in different <I>individuals</I> of the same two
species in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with
different individuals of the same two species in being grafted
together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union
is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the
common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant,
whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the
gooseberry.

<P>
We have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their
reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a very different
case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their
reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a
certain extent parallel.  Something analogous occurs in grafting; for
Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on
their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty
on another species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the
other hand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species,
yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots.  We are
reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of
Hippeastrum, Lobelia, &amp;c., which seeded much more freely when
fertilised with the pollen of distinct species, than when
self-fertilised with their own pollen.

<P>
We thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental
difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union
of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that
there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and
of crossing distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and
complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on
each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative
systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the
facility of first crosses, are incidental on unknown differences,
chiefly in their reproductive systems. These differences, in both
cases, follow to a certain extent, as might have been expected,
systematic affinity, by which every kind of resemblance and
dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. The
facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser
difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has
been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the
difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific
forms, as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.
<P>
<I>Causes of the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids.</I> 
We may now look a little closer at the probable causes
of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.  These two cases are
fundamentally different, for, as just remarked, in the union of two
pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect, whereas
in hybrids they are imperfect. Even in first crosses, the greater or
lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several
distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical impossibility in
the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case with a plant
having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. It
has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on
the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes
protrude, they do not penetrate  the stigmatic surface.
Again, the 
male element may reach the female element, but be incapable
of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case
with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given
of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on
others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early
period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to;
but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who
has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds, that the
early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in
first crosses. I was at first very unwilling to believe in this view;
as hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as
we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however, are
differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and living
in a country where their two parents can live, they are generally
placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of
only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and therefore
before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb or
within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to
conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to
perish at an early period; more especially as all very young beings
seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.

<P>
In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements
are imperfectly developed, the case is very different. I have more
than once alluded to a large body of facts, which I have collected,
showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural
conditions, they are extremely liable to have their reproductive
systems seriously affected. This, in fact, is 
the great bar to the
domestication of animals. Between the sterility thus superinduced and
that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity. In both cases
the sterility is independent of general health, and is often
accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. In both cases, the
sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male element is the
most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more than the
male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic
affinity, or whole groups of animals and plants are rendered
impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups
of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one
species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions
with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a group will produce
unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell, till he tries, whether any
particular animal will breed under confinement or any plant seed
freely under culture; nor can he tell, till he tries, whether any two
species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly,
when organic beings are placed during several generations under
conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary,
which is due, as I believe, to their reproductive systems having been
specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility
ensues. So it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations
are eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.

<P>
Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and
unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural
crossing of two species, the reproductive system, independently of the
general state of health, is affected by sterility in a very similar
manner. In the one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed,
though often in so slight a degree as to 
be inappreciable by us; in
the other case, or that of hybrids,the external conditions have
remained the same, but the organisation has been disturbed by two
different structures and constitutions having been blended into one.
For it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be
compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the
development, or periodical action, or mutual relation of the different
parts and organs one to another, or to the conditions of life.  When
hybrids are able to breed <I>inter se</I>, they
transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same
compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their
sterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes.

<P>
It must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting
on vague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of
hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from
reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which
occasionally and exceptionally resemble  closely either
pure parent. Nor do I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the
root of the matter: no explanation is offered why an organism, when
placed under unnatural conditions, is rendered sterile. All that I
have attempted to show, is that in two cases, in some respects allied,
sterility is the common result,   in the one case from the
conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the
organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been
compounded into one.

<P>
It may seem fanciful, but I suspect that a similar parallelism
extends to an allied yet very different class of facts. It is an old
and almost universal belief, founded, I think, on a considerable body
of evidence, that slight changes in the conditions of life are
beneficial to all living things. We see this acted on by 
farmers and
gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, &amp;c., from
one soil or climate to another, and back again. During the
convalescence of animals, we plainly see that great benefit is derived
from almost any change in the habits of life.  Again, both with plants
and animals, there is abundant evidence, that a cross between very
distinct individuals of the same species, that is between members of
different strains or sub-breeds, gives vigour and fertility to the
offspring. I believe, indeed, from the facts alluded to in our fourth
chapter, that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even with
hermaphrodites; and that close interbreeding continued during several
generations between the nearest relations, especially if these be kept
under the same conditions of life, always induces weakness and
sterility in the progeny.

<P>
Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the
conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand,
that slight crosses, that is crosses between the males and females of
the same species which have varied and become slightly different, give
vigour and fertility to the offspring. But we have seen that greater
changes, or changes of a particular nature, often render organic
beings in some degree sterile; and that greater crosses, that is
crosses between males and females which have become widely or
specifically different, produce hybrids which are generally sterile in
some degree.  I cannot  persuade myself that this
parallelism is an accident or an illusion. Both series of facts seem to
be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is
essentially related to the principle of life.
<P>
<I>Fertility of Varieties when crossed, and of their Mongrel off-spring.</I> 
It may be urged, as a most forcible argument, 
that there must be some essential distinction between
species and varieties, and that there must be some error in all the
foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however much they may differ
from each other in external appearance, cross with perfect facility,
and yield perfectly fertile offspring. I fully admit that this is
almost invariably the case. But if we look to varieties produced under
nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties; for if
two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile
together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For
instance, the blue and red pimpernel, the primrose and cowslip, which
are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties, are said by
G&auml;rtner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and he
consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a
circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will
assuredly have to be granted.

<P>
If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been
produced, under domestication, we are still involved in doubt. For when
it is stated, for instance, that the German Spitz dog unites more
easily than other dogs with foxes, or that certain South American
indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with European dogs, the
explanation which will occur to everyone, and probably the true one,
is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct
species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic
varieties, differing widely from each other in appearance, for
instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more
especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though
resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when
intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the fertility of
domestic varieties less remarkable than 
at first appears. It can, in
the first place, be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity
between two  species does not determine their greater or
lesser degree of sterility when crossed; and we may apply the same
rule to domestic varieties. In the second place, some eminent
naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to
eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids, which
were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we surely
ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing
under nearly the same conditions of life. Lastly, and this seems to me
by far the most important consideration, new races of animals and
plants are produced under domestication by man's methodical and
unconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he
neither wishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the
reproductive system, or other constitutional difference correlated
with the reproductive system. He supplies his several varieties with
the same food; treats them in nearly the same manner, and does not
wish to alter their general habits of life. Nature acts uniformly and
slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organization, in any
way which may be for each creature's own good; and thus she may,
either directly, or more probably indirectly, through correlation,
modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one
species. Seeing this difference in the process of selection, as carried
on by man and nature, we need not be surprised at some difference in
the result.

<P>
I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were
invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it seems to me impossible to
resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility
in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The
evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe 
in the
sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is, also, derived
from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and
sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. G&auml;rtner
kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and
a tall variety with red seeds, growing near each other in his garden;
and although these plants have separated sexes, they never naturally
crossed. He then fertilized thirteen flowers of the one with the
pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed, and
this one head produced  only five grains. Manipulation in
this case could not have been injurious, as the plants have separated
sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize
are distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid
plants thus raised were themselves <I>perfectly</I> fertile; so
that even G&auml;rtner did not venture to consider the two varieties
as specifically distinct.

<P>
Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like
the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual
fertilization is by so much the less easy as their differences are
greater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the
forms experimentised on, are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his
classification by the test of infertility, as varieties.

<P>
The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite
incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of
experiments made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so
good an observer and so hostile a witness, as G&auml;rtner: namely,
that yellow and white varieties of the same species of Verbascum
when intercrossed produce less seed, than do either coloured
varieties when fertilized with pollen from their own coloured
flowers. Moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white varieties
of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a
<I>distinct</I> species, more seed is produced by the crosses
between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are
differently coloured. Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no
other difference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one
variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other.

<P>
From observations which I have made on certain varieties of
hollyhock, I am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.

<P>
K&ouml;lreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every
subsequent observer, has proved the remarkable fact, that one variety
of the common tobacco is more fertile, when crossed with a widely
distinct species, than are the other varieties. He experimentised on
five forms, which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he
tested by the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he
found their mongrel offspring perfectly  fertile. But one
of these five varieties, when used either as father or mother, and
crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so
sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties
when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the reproductive system of this
one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified.

<P>
From these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the
infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety
if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from
man selecting only external characters in the production of the most
distinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to
produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive
system; from these several considerations and facts, I do not think
that the very general 
fertility of varieties can be proved to be of
universal occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between
varieties and species. The general fertility of varieties does not
seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which I have taken with
respect to the very general, but not invariable, sterility of first
crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment,
but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more especially in
the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.
<P>
<I>Hybrids and Mongrels compared, independently of their fertility.</I> 
Independently of the question of fertility,
the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed
may be compared in several other respects.  G&auml;rtner, whose strong
wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and
varieties, could find very few and, as it seems to me, quite
unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of
species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties. And, on the
other hand, they agree most closely in very many important respects.

<P>
I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity.  The most
important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are
more variable than hybrids; but G&auml;rtner admits that hybrids from
species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the
first generation; and I have myself seen striking 
instances of this fact. G&auml;rtner further admits that hybrids
between very closely allied species are more variable than those from
very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the
degree of variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more
fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme
amount of variability in their offspring is notorious; 
but some few
cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of
character could be given. The variability, however, in the successive
generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids.

<P>
This greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem
to me at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties,
and mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried
on natural varieties), and this implies in most cases that there has
been recent variability; and therefore we might expect that such
variability would often continue and be super-added to that arising
from the mere act of crossing. The slight degree of variability in
hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation, in contrast
with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations, is a
curious fact and deserves attention. For it bears on and corroborates
the view which I have taken on the cause of ordinary variability;
namely, that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently
sensitive to any change in the conditions of life, being thus often
rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function
of producing offspring identical with the parent-form. Now hybrids in
the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long
cultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way
affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their
reproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are
highly variable.

<P>
But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids:
G&auml;rtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to
revert to either parent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly
only a difference in degree.
G&auml;rtner further insists that when any two species, although most
closely allied to each other, are 
crossed with a third species, the
hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very
distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species,
the hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can
make out, is founded on a single experiment; and  seems
directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by
K&ouml;lreuter.

<P>
These alone are the unimportant differences, which G&auml;rtner is
able to point out, between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other
hand, the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective
parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related
species, follows according to G&auml;rtner the same laws. When two
species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing
its likeness on the hybrid; and so I believe it to be with varieties
of plants. With animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent
power over another variety.  Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal
cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it is with
mongrels from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be
reduced to either pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive
generations with either parent.

<P>
These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the
subject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence
of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to
prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex
than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and
when one variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I
think those authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a
prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny
more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs
more strongly in the male-ass than in 
the female, so that the mule,
which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass,
than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and
stallion.

<P>
Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact,
that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents;
but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet I
grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. Looking to
the cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely
resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to
characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly
appeared   such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or
horns, or additional  fingers and toes; and do not relate
to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection.
Consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect character of either
parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are
descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in
character, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly
and naturally produced. On the whole I entirely agree with Dr Prosper
Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to
animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the
child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ much
or little from each other, namely in the union of individuals of the
same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.

<P>
Laying aside the question of fertility and sterility, in all other
respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the
offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at
species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having
been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an
astonishing fact. But it harmonizes perfectly with the view that there
is no essential distinction between species and varieties.
<P>
<I>Summary of Chapter.</I> 
First crosses
between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species, and their
hybrids, are very generally, but not universally, sterile.  The
sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that the two most
careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to
diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The
sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and
is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions.
The degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity,
but is governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally
different, and sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses
between the same two species. It is not always equal in degree in a
first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross.

<P>
In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one
species or variety to take on another, is incidental on generally
unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so in
crossing, the greater or less facility of one species to unite with
another, is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive
systems. There is no more reason to think that species have been
specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them
crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been
specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of
difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming
inarched in our forests.

<P>
The sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have
their reproductive systems perfect, seems 
to depend on several
circumstances; in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo.
The sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive systems
imperfect, and which have had this system and their whole organisation
disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species, seems closely
allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species,
when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed. This view
is supported by a parallelism of another kind;   namely, that
the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the
vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight changes in
the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and
fertility of all organic beings. It is not surprising that the degree
of difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of
their hybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to
distinct causes; for both depend on the amount of difference of some
kind between the species which are crossed. Nor is it surprising that
the facility of effecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids
produced, and the capacity of being grafted together   though
this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different
circumstances   should all run, to a certain extent, parallel
with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to
experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of
resemblance between all species.

<P>
First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently
alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are
very generally, but not quite universally, fertile. Nor is this nearly
general and perfect fertility surprising, when  we
remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to
varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater
number of varieties have been produced under domestication 
by the
selection of mere external differences, and not of differences in the
reproductive system. In all other respects, excluding fertility, there
is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. Finally,
then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me
opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no
fundamental distinction between species and varieties.
