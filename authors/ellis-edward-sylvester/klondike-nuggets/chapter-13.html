<p>The little party of gold-seekers had every cause to congratulate
themselves, for after a journey of nearly two thousand miles from
Seattle, through wild passes, dangerous rapids and ca√±ons, over
precipitous mountains, amid storm and tempests, with their lives
many a time in peril, half frozen and exhausted by the most wearisome
toil, they had arrived at Dawson City, in the midst of the wonderful
gold district of the Northwest, all without mishap and in better
condition than when they left home.</p>

<p>The boys, in roughing it, had breathed the invigorating ozone
and gained in rugged health and strength. Youth and buoyant spirits
were on their side, and their muscles, which would have become
flabby in the unwholesome atmosphere of a store, were hardened,
and their endurance and capacity for trying work immeasurably
increased. There are thousands of men to-day enjoying life, without
an ache or pain, who owe their splendid condition to the campaigning
they underwent in the war for the Union. If that terrific struggle
swept multitudes into their graves, it brought the balm of strength
and health to many more, who otherwise would not have lived out
half their days.</p>

<p>The trying experience of Jeff Graham in his youth and early manhood
did this service for him. It was not strange, therefore, that
he with his iron muscles bore the strain better than any of his
companions. He seemed to be tireless, and his sturdy strength
often put others to shame. He had never sapped his constitution
by dissipation; and it may be said that the severe hardships of
that journey from Dyea through Chilkoot Pass and the wild regions
about the Upper Yukon confirmed that which already existed within
his splendid make-up. As for Roswell Palmer and Frank Mansley,
their excellent home training, not denying credit to the grim
old miner for his wise counsel, had held them free from the bad
habits which too often make boys effeminate and weak and old before
their time. Gifted by nature with the best of constitutions, they
had strengthened rather than undermined them. Neither had known
an hour's illness throughout the long, laborious journey, and
they were in the best condition possible for the great task that
now confronted them.</p>

<p>As for Tim McCabe and Ike Hardman, their weakness lay in yielding
to the temptation to drink. No such temptation appeared on the
road, and their enforced temperance had the best effect. Tim was
less disposed to drink than the other, but, sad to say, he indulged
at times. Hardman's ideal was to obtain the means for doing nothing
and minister to his base appetites.</p>

<p>It was in 1887 that Dr. George M. Dawson, the leader of an exploring
expedition sent by the Canadian Government into the Yukon district,
made a report confirming the presence of gold in vast quantities
throughout that section. The principal mining camp established
there was named in his honor. It faces on one of the banks of
the Yukon River, along which it extends for about a mile. It has
a sawmill, stores, and churches of the Baptist, Presbyterian,
Methodist, and Roman Catholic denominations. Being the headquarters
of the Canadian Northwest mounted police, it is one of the best-governed
towns on the American continent. At the time of our friends' arrival
its population was about four thousand, but the rush will swell
it in an incredibly short while to ten, twenty, and possibly fifty
times that number, for beyond question it is the centre of the
most marvellous gold district that the world has ever known.</p>

<p>Copper, silver, and coal are found in large quantities, but no
one gives them a thought when so much of the vastly more attractive
yellow metal is within reach. It is singular that while the existence
of gold was incontestably known for many years, little or no excitement
was produced until 1896 and 1897, when the whole civilized world
was turned almost topsy-turvy by the bewildering reports. During
the first three months of the latter year more than four million
dollars were taken from a space of forty square miles, where a
few placer claims were worked. What harvest will be during the
next few years no man dare attempt to guess. How suggestive the
fact that on one stream so much of the metal has been found that
it was given the name "Too Much Gold Creek!"</p>

<p>Inasmuch as our friends are now on the ground, a few more facts
are proper, in order to understand the task that confronted them.
Dawson City, it will be remembered, is in British territory, and
all the great discoveries of gold have been made to the east of
that town. Doubtless gold will be gathered in Alaska itself, but
the probabilities are that the richest deposits are upon Canadian
soil.</p>

<p>The mining claims begin within two and a half miles of Dawson
City, on the Klondike, and follow both sides of that stream into
the interior, taking in its tributaries like Hunker's Creek, Gold
Bottom, Last Chance, Bear Creek, Bould's Bonanza, and El Dorado.
Of these the richest are El Dorado, Gold Bottom, Hunker, and the
oddly named Too Much Gold Creek. The last is the farthest from
Dawson City, and the least known; but there can be no question
that numerous other streams, at present unvisited, are equally
rich, and will be speedily developed.</p>

<p>Just now placer mining is the only method employed. According
to the mining laws of the Northwest, the words "mine," "placer
mine," and "diggings" mean the same thing, and refer to any natural
stratum or bed of earth, gravel, or cement mined for gold or other
precious mineral. There is very little quartz mining, or crushing
of rocks, as is practised in many sections of California. This
requires expensive machinery, and little necessity for it seems
to exist in the Klondike. In placer mining the pay dirt is washed
by the simplest methods, such as were practised in California
during the pioneer days.</p>

<p>Everything was hurry and bustle at Dawson City on that day, late
in May, when our friends arrived. It was a noticeable fact that
the date of their arrival was exactly two months after the boys
kissed their parents good-by in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Tim McCabe had gathered much practical knowledge during his experience
in this region, while Jeff had not forgotten what he passed through
"in the days of '49," to which wisdom he had added, as opportunity
presented, while on the way to the Klondike. When the party had
eaten together at the principal hotel and the men had lit their
pipes in a group by themselves, a surprise came. The old miner
smoked a minute or two in silence, and then turned to Hardman,
who was sitting a little apart, moody and reserved.</p>

<p>"Ike," said he, "I've stood by you all the way from Juneau, hain't
I?"</p>

<p>The fellow looked wonderingly at him, as did the others, none
suspecting what was coming.</p>

<p>"In course," was the gruff reply of Hardman; "we all stood by
one another, fur if we hadn't we wouldn't stood at all."</p>

<p>"You've got to Dawson City without it costing you a penny, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"There hain't been much chance to spend money since we left Dyea,"
replied Hardman with a grin.</p>

<p>Jeff was nettled by this dodging of the issue; but he kept his
temper.</p>

<p>"And if there had been you hadn't a dollar to spend onless you
kept back some of that which you stole from Tim."</p>

<p>"I don't see the use of your harping on that affair," said Hardman
angrily. "I've owned up, and am going to make it all right with
Tim. It's none of your business, anyway, and I don't want to hear
any more of it."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "I <em>DON'T SEE THE USE OF YOUR HARPING ON THAT
AFFAIR," SAID HARDMAN</em>.]</p>

<p>"Well, what I'm getting at is this: if it hadn't been for me
you'd never got to this place. You're here, and now you must look
out for yourself; I won't have you an hour longer in the party;
we part; get away as soon as you can!"</p>

<p>Hardman looked savagely at the old miner, as if suspecting he
had not heard aright. But a moment's reflection convinced him
there was no mistake. With a muttered imprecation he rose to his
feet and left. But it was by no means the last of him.</p>
