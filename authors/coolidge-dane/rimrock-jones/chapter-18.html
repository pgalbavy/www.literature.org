<p>Rimrock Jones' return to New York was as dramatic and spectacular as
his first visit had been pretentious and prodigal.  With two thousand
dollars and a big black hat he had passed for a Western millionaire;
now, still wearing the hat but loaded down with real money, he returned
and was hailed as a Croesus.  There are always some people in public
life whose least act is heralded to the world; whereas others, much
more distinguished but less given to publicity, accomplish miracles and
are hardly known.  And then there are still others who, fed up with
flattery and featured in a hundred ways, are all unwittingly the
victims of a publicity bureau whose aim is their ultimate undoing.
</p><p>A real Western cowboy with a pistol under his coat, a prospector turned
multi-millionaire in a year, such a man--especially if he wears a
sombrero and gives five-dollar tips to the bell-hops--is sure to break
into the prints.  But it was a strange coincidence, when Rimrock jumped
out of his taxicab and headed for the Waldorf entrance, to find a
battery of camera men all lined up to snap him and a squad of reporters
inside.  No sooner had Rimrock been shot through the storm door into
the gorgeous splendors of Peacock Alley than they assailed him en
masse--much as the bell-boys had just done to gain his grip and the
five-dollar tip.
</p><p>That went down first--the five-dollar tip--and his Western remarks on
the climate.  Then his na√Øve hospitality in inviting them all to the
bar where they could talk the matter over at their ease, and his
equally cordial agreement to make it tea when he was reminded that some
reporters were women--it all went down and came out the same evening,
at which Rimrock Jones was dazed.  If he had telegraphed ahead, or let
anyone know that he planned to return to New York, it would not have
been surprising to find the reporters waiting, for he was, of course, a
great man; but this was a quick trip, made on the spur of the moment,
and he hadn't told a soul.  Yet in circumstances like these, with a
roomful of newspapers and your name played up big on the front page, it
is hardly human nature to enquire too closely or wonder what is going
on.  Still, there was something up, for even coincidence can explain
things only so far.  Leaving out the fact that Mrs. Hardesty might have
sent on the telegram herself, and that Whitney H. Stoddard might have
motives of his own in inviting his newspapers to act; it did not stand
to reason that the first man Rimrock ran into should have had such a
sweet inside tip.  Yet that was what the gay Buckbee told him--and
circumstances proved he was right.  The money that Rimrock put up that
night, after talking it over in the cafe, that money was doubled within
the next three days, and the stock still continued to advance.  It was
invested on a margin in Navajoa Copper, a minor holding of the great
Hackmeister combine that Stoddard had set out to break.
</p><p>Stoddard was selling short, so Buckbee explained, throwing great blocks
of stock on a market that refused to break; and when the rush came and
Navajoa started up Rimrock was there with the rest of his roll.  It was
a game that he took to--any form of gambling--and besides, he was
bucking Stoddard!  And then, there was Buckbee.  He knew more in a
minute than some brokers know in a lifetime; and he had promised to
keep him advised.  Of course it was a gamble, a man might lose, but it
beat any game Rimrock had played.  And copper was going up.  Copper,
the metal that stood behind it all, and that men could not do without.
</p><p>There was a movement on such as Rimrock had never dreamed of, to
control the copper product of the world.  It had been tried before and
had ended disastrously, but that did not prove it impossible.  There
were in the United States six or eight companies that produced the bulk
of the ore.  Two or three, like the Tecolote, were closed corporations,
where the stock was held by a few; but the rest were on the market, the
football of The Street, their stock owned by anybody and everybody.  It
was for these loose stocks that the combine and Stoddard were fighting,
with thousands of the public buying in, and as the price of some stock
was jigged up and down it was the public that cast the die.
</p><p>If the people were convinced that a certain stock was good and refused
to be shaken down, the price of that stock went up.  But if the people,
through what they had read, decided that the stock was bad; then there
was a panic that nothing could stop and the big interests snapped up
the spoils.  So much Rimrock learned from Buckbee, and Mrs. Hardesty
told him the rest.  It was her judgment, really, that he came to rely
upon; though Buckbee was right, in the main.  He told the facts, but
she went behind them and showed who was pulling the strings.
</p><p>It was from her that he had learned of the mighty press agencies--which
at the moment were making much of his coup--and how shrewd financiers
like the Hackmeisters or Stoddard used them constantly to influence the
market.  If it became known, for instance, that Rimrock Jones was
plunging on Navajoa and that within three days he had doubled his money
and was still holding out for a rise; that was big news for Hackmeister
and his papers made the most of it.  But if Navajoa went down and some
broker's clerk lost his holdings and committed embezzlement, or if a
mining engineer made an adverse report, or the company passed a
dividend, then Stoddard's press agents would make the most of each
item--if he wished the stock to go down.  Otherwise it would not be
mentioned.  It was by following out such subtleties and closely
studying the tape, that brokers like Buckbee guessed out each move in
advance and were able to earn their commissions.
</p><p>But all this information did not come to Rimrock for nothing--there was
a price which had to be paid.  For reasons of her own the dashing Mrs.
Hardesty appeared frequently in the Waldorf lobby, and when Rimrock
came in with any of his friends he was expected to introduce them.  And
Rimrock's friends in that swarming hotel were as numerous as they were
in Gunsight.  He expected no less, wherever he went, than the
friendship of every man; and if any held back, for any reason, he
marked him as quickly for an enemy.  He was as open-hearted and free in
those marble corridors and in the velvet-hung club and cafe as the old
Rimrock had been on the streets of Gunsight when he spoke to every
Mexican.
</p><p>It was his day of triumph, this return to the Waldorf where before he
had been but a pretender, and it did his heart good to share his
victory with the one woman who could understand.  She knew all his ways
now, his swift impulsive hatreds and his equally impulsive affections;
and she knew, as a woman, just when to oppose him and when to lead him
on.  She knew him, one might say, almost too well for her success; for
Rimrock was swayed more by his heart than his head, and at times she
seemed a little cold.  There was a hard, worldly look that came over
her at times, a sly, calculating look that chilled him when he might
have told everything he knew.  Yet it may easily be that he told her
enough, and more than she needed to know.
</p><p>In some curious way that Rimrock could never fathom, Mrs. Hardesty was
interested in stocks.  She never explained it, but her visits to the
Waldorf had something to do with trades.  Whether she bought or sold,
gathered tips or purveyed them or simply guarded her own investments
was a mystery that he never solved; but she knew many people and, in
some way not specified, she profited by their acquaintance.  She was an
elusive woman, like another that he knew; but at times she startled
him, too.  Those times were mostly on the rare occasions when she
invited him to supper at her rooms.  These were at the St. Cyngia, not
far from the Waldorf, a full suite with two servants to attend.
</p><p>On his first formal call Rimrock had been taken aback by the wealth and
luxury displayed.  There were rare French tapestries and soft Persian
rugs that seemed to merge into the furniture of the rooms and at his
very first dinner she had poured out the wine until even his strong
head began to swim.  It was a new world to him and a new kind of
woman--with the intellect and, yes, the moral standards of a man.  She
was dainty and feminine, and with a dark type of beauty that went to
his head worse than wine, but with it all she had a stockbroker's
information and smoked and drank like a man.  But then, as she said,
all the women smoked now; and as far as he could judge, it was so.  The
women they saw in the gay all-night restaurants or after the theater in
cabarets, all beautifully gowned and apparently with their husbands,
drank and smoked the same as the men.
</p><p>But the thing that startled Rimrock and made him uneasy was the way she
had when they were alone.  After the dinner was over, in her luxurious
apartments, when the servant had left them alone, as they sat together
across the table and smoked the scented cigarettes that she loved, he
could feel a spell, a sort of enchantment, in every soft sweep of her
eyes.  At other times her long, slender arms seemed thin, in a way, and
unrounded; but then her whole form took on the slim grace of a dancer
and that strange light came into her eyes.  It too was a light such as
comes to dancers' eyes, as they take on some languid pose; but it had
this difference--it was addressed to him, and her words belied her
eyes.  The eyes spoke of love, but, leaning across the table, the tiger
lady talked of stocks.
</p><p>It was on the occasion of his first winning on copper, when he had sold
out his Navajoa at a big profit; and, after the celebration that he had
provided, she had invited him to supper.  The cigarettes were smoked
and, with champagne still singing in his ears, Rimrock followed her to
the dimly lighted reception-room.  They sat by the fire, her slim arms
gleaming and dark shadows falling beneath her hair; and as Rimrock
watched her, his heart in his throat, she glanced up from her musing to
smile.
</p><p>"What a child you are, after all!" she observed and Rimrock raised his
head.
</p><p>"Yes, sure," he said, "I'm a regular baby.  It's a wonder someone
hasn't noticed and took me in off the street."
</p><p>"Yes, it is," she said with a twist of the lips, "the Street's no place
for you.  Some of those big bears will get you, sure.  But here's what
I was thinking.  You came back to New York to watch Whitney Stoddard
and be where you could do him the most harm.  That's childish in itself
because there's no reason in the world why both of you shouldn't be
friends.  But never mind that--men will fight, I suppose--it's only a
question of weapons."
</p><p>"Well, what do we care?" answered Rimrock with a ready smile, "I
thought maybe you might adopt me."
</p><p>"No, indeed," she replied, "you'd run away.  I've seen boys like you
before.  But to think that you'd come back here to get the lifeblood of
Stoddard and then go to buying Navajoa!  Why not?  Why, you might as
well be a mosquito for all the harm you will do.  A grown man like
you--Rimrock Jones, the copper king--fighting Stoddard through Navajoa!"
</p><p>"Well, why not?" defended Rimrock.  "Didn't I put a crimp in him?
Didn't I double my money on the deal?"
</p><p>"Yes, but why Navajoa?  Why not Tecolote?  If you must fight, why not
use a real club?"
</p><p>Rimrock thought a while, for the spell was passing and his mind had
switched from her charms.
</p><p>"How'm I going to use Tecolote?" he blurted out at last.  "It's tied
up, until I can find that girl!"
</p><p>"Not necessarily," she replied.  "We who live by the Street learn to
use our enemies as well as our friends.  You will never whip Stoddard
as long as you stand off and refuse to sit in on the game.  Isn't his
vote as good as your friend, the typist's?  Then use it to put Tecolote
on the market.  You know what I mean--to vote Tecolote commons and get
the stakes on the board.  Then while this scramble is on and he's
fighting the Hackmeisters, buy Tecolote and get your control."
</p><p>"Fine and dandy!" mocked Rimrock.  "You're right, I'm a sucker; and
it's a shame to take my money.  But I don't want any Tecolote Commons."
</p><p>"Why not?" she challenged, laughing gayly at his vehemence.  "Are you
afraid to play the game?"
</p><p>"Not so you'd notice it," answered Rimrock grimly, "but I never play
the other fellow's game.  The Tecolote game is going to be played in
Arizona, where my friends can see fair play.  But look at Navajoa, how
balled up that company is with its stocks all scattered around.  Until
it comes in for transfer nobody knows who's got it.  They may be sold
clear out and never know it.  No, I may look easy, but I've been
dog-bit once and I've got the leg to show for it.  To issue that stock
we'd have to call in the lawyers and go through some reorganization
scheme; and by the time we got through, with Miss Fortune gone, I'd
find myself badly left.  There'll be no lawyers for me, and no common
stock.  I know another way to win."
</p><p>He paused and as she failed to ask what it was, he grunted and lit
another cigarette.
</p><p>"I wonder," she began after a thoughtful pause, "if Stoddard doesn't
know where she is."
</p><p>She had guessed it as surely as if he had stated his plan--he still
hoped to find Mary Fortune.  And then?  Well, his plan was a little
nebulous right there; but Mary held the necessary stock.  If he could
get control, in any way whatsoever, of that one per cent. of the stock
he could laugh at Stoddard and take his dividends to carry on his fight
in coppers.  He had neglected her before, but this time it would be
different; she could have anything she asked.  And his detectives were
hunting for her everywhere.
</p><p>"Don't know," he answered after a dogged silence.  "Why? what makes you
think he does?"
</p><p>She laughed.
</p><p>"You don't know Mr. Stoddard as well as I do.  He's a very successful
man.  Very thorough.  If <u>he</u> set out to find Mary Fortune he'd be
almost sure to do it."
</p><p>"Hm," said Rimrock.  "I'd better watch him, then.  I'll call up about
that to-morrow.  Just have a man there to watch the door--she might be
going in or out."
</p><p>"What a sleuth you are!" she answered gravely, and then she broke down
and laughed.  "Well, well," she said, "'tis a battle of wits, but love
may find a way.  Do you believe in love?" she went on abruptly as
Rimrock showed signs of pique.  "I just wanted to know.  You great, big
Western men seem more fitted, somehow, for the part of copper kings.
But tell me honestly, I feel so trifling to-night, do you believe in
the great love for one woman?  Or do you hold with these drawing-room
philosophers that man is by nature polygamous?  Never mind my
feelings--just tell me."
</p><p>She coiled up lazily in her soft plush great-chair and regarded him
with languid eyes, and Rimrock never suspected that the words he had
spoken would go straight to Stoddard that night.  He forgot his
rejection of a get-together plan and his final refusal of common
stocks; all he saw was this woman with her half-veiled glances and the
firelight as it played on her arms.  He had confessed his hope of still
finding Mary and of winning her back to his side; but as he gazed at
the tiger lady, sprawling so negligently before him, his fickle
thoughts wandered to her.  He denounced the theory of these latter-day
philosophers that man is essentially a brute and, still watching her
furtively, he expressed the conviction that he could love the One Woman
forever.
