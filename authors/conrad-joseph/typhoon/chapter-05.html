<p>He waited. Before his eyes the engines turned with slow labour,
that in the moment of going off into a mad fling would stop dead
at Mr. Rout's shout, "Look out, Beale!" They paused in an intelligent
immobility, stilled in mid-stroke, a heavy crank arrested on the
cant, as if conscious of danger and the passage of time. Then,
with a "Now, then!"  from the chief, and the sound of a breath
expelled through clenched teeth, they would accomplish the interrupted
revolution and begin another.</p>

<p>There was the prudent sagacity of wisdom and the deliberation
of enormous strength in their movements. This was their work&mdash;this
patient coaxing of a distracted ship over the fury of the waves
and into the very eye of the wind. At times Mr. Rout's chin would
sink on his breast, and he watched them with knitted eyebrows
as if lost in thought.</p>

<p>The voice that kept the hurricane out of Jukes' ear began: "Take
the hands with you . . . ," and left off unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"What could I do with them, sir?"</p>

<p>A harsh, abrupt, imperious clang exploded suddenly. The three
pairs of eyes flew up to the telegraph dial to see the hand jump
from <em>FULL </em>to <em>STOP, </em>as if snatched by a devil.
And then these three men in the engineroom had the intimate sensation
of a check upon the ship, of a strange shrinking, as if she had
gathered herself for a desperate leap.</p>

<p>"Stop her!" bellowed Mr. Rout.</p>

<p>Nobody&mdash;not even Captain MacWhirr, who alone on deck had caught
sight of a white line of foam coming on at such a height that
he couldn't believe his eyes&mdash;nobody was to know the steepness
of that sea and the awful depth of the hollow the hurricane had
scooped out behind the running wall of water.</p>

<p>It raced to meet the ship, and, with a pause, as of girding the
loins, the Nan-Shan lifted her bows and leaped. The flames in
all the lamps sank, darkening the engine-room. One went out. With
a tearing crash and a swirling, raving tumult, tons of water fell
upon the deck, as though the ship had darted under the foot of
a cataract.</p>

<p>Down there they looked at each other, stunned.</p>

<p>"Swept from end to end, by God!" bawled Jukes.</p>

<p>She dipped into the hollow straight down, as if going over the
edge of the world. The engine-room toppled forward menacingly,
like the inside of a tower nodding in an earthquake. An awful
racket, of iron things falling, came from the stokehold. She hung
on this appalling slant long enough for Beale to drop on his hands
and knees and begin to crawl as if he meant to fly on all fours
out of the engine-room, and for Mr. Rout to turn his head slowly,
rigid, cavernous, with the lower jaw dropping. Jukes had shut
his eyes, and his face in a moment became hopelessly blank and
gentle, like the face of a blind man.</p>

<p>At last she rose slowly, staggering, as if she had to lift a
mountain with her bows.</p>

<p>Mr. Rout shut his mouth; Jukes blinked; and little Beale stood
up hastily.</p>

<p>"Another one like this, and that's the last of her," cried the
chief.</p>

<p>He and Jukes looked at each other, and the same thought came
into their heads. The Captain! Everything must have been swept
away. Steering-gear gone&mdash;ship like a log. All over directly.</p>

<p>"Rush!" ejaculated Mr. Rout thickly, glaring with enlarged, doubtful
eyes at Jukes, who answered him by an irresolute glance.</p>

<p>The clang of the telegraph gong soothed them instantly. The black
hand dropped in a flash from <em>STOP </em>to <em>FULL</em>.</p>

<p>"Now then, Beale!" cried Mr. Rout.</p>

<p>The steam hissed low. The piston-rods slid in and out. Jukes
put his ear to the tube. The voice was ready for him. It said:
"Pick up all the money. Bear a hand now. I'll want you up here."
And that was all.</p>

<p>"Sir?" called up Jukes. There was no answer.</p>

<p>He staggered away like a defeated man from the field of battle.
He had got, in some way or other, a cut above his left eyebrow&mdash;a
cut to the bone. He was not aware of it in the least: quantities
of the China Sea, large enough to break his neck for him, had
gone over his head, had cleaned, washed, and salted that wound.
It did not bleed, but only gaped red; and this gash over the eye,
his dishevelled hair, the disorder of his clothes, gave him the
aspect of a man worsted in a fight with fists.</p>

<p>"Got to pick up the dollars." He appealed to Mr. Rout, smiling
pitifully at random.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Mr. Rout, wildly. "Pick up . . . ? I don't
care. . . ." Then, quivering in every muscle, but with an exaggeration
of paternal tone, "Go away now, for God's sake. You deck people'll
drive me silly. There's that second mate been going for the old
man. Don't you know? You fellows are going wrong for want of something
to do. . . ."</p>

<p>At these words Jukes discovered in himself the beginnings of
anger. Want of something to do&mdash;indeed. . . . Full of hot scorn
against the chief, he turned to go the way he had come. In the
stokehold the plump donkeyman toiled with his shovel mutely, as
if his tongue had been cut out; but the second was carrying on
like a noisy, undaunted maniac, who had preserved his skill in
the art of stoking under a marine boiler.</p>

<p>"Hallo, you wandering officer! Hey! Can't you get some of your
slush-slingers to wind up a few of them ashes? I am getting choked
with them here. Curse it! Hallo! Hey! Remember the articles: Sailors
and firemen to assist each other. Hey! D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>Jukes was climbing out frantically, and the other, lifting up
his face after him, howled, "Can't you speak? What are you poking
about here for? What's your game, anyhow?"</p>

<p>A frenzy possessed Jukes. By the time he was back amongst the
men in the darkness of the alleyway, he felt ready to wring all
their necks at the slightest sign of hanging back. The very thought
of it exasperated him. He couldn't hang back. They shouldn't.</p>

<p>The impetuosity with which he came amongst them carried them
along. They had already been excited and startled at all his comings
and goings&mdash;by the fierceness and rapidity of his movements; and
more felt than seen in his rushes, he appeared formidable&mdash;busied
with matters of life and death that brooked no delay. At his first
word he heard them drop into the bunker one after another obediently,
with heavy thumps.</p>

<p>They were not clear as to what would have to be done. "What is
it? What is it?" they were asking each other. The boatswain tried
to explain; the sounds of a great scuffle surprised them: and
the mighty shocks, reverberating awfully in the black bunker,
kept them in mind of their danger. When the boatswain threw open
the door it seemed that an eddy of the hurricane, stealing through
the iron sides of the ship, had set all these bodies whirling
like dust: there came to them a confused uproar, a tempestuous
tumult, a fierce mutter, gusts of screams dying away, and the
tramping of feet mingling with the blows of the sea.</p>

<p>For a moment they glared amazed, blocking the doorway. Jukes
pushed through them brutally. He said nothing, and simply darted
in. Another lot of coolies on the ladder, struggling suicidally
to break through the battened hatch to a swamped deck, fell off
as before, and he disappeared under them like a man overtaken
by a landslide.</p>

<p>The boatswain yelled excitedly: "Come along. Get the mate out.
He'll be trampled to death. Come on."</p>

<p>They charged in, stamping on breasts, on fingers, on faces, catching
their feet in heaps of clothing, kicking broken wood; but before
they could get hold of him Jukes emerged waist deep in a multitude
of clawing hands. In the instant he had been lost to view, all
the buttons of his jacket had gone, its back had got split up
to the collar, his waistcoat had been torn open. The central struggling
mass of Chinamen went over to the roll, dark, indistinct, helpless,
with a wild gleam of many eyes in the dim light of the lamps.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone&mdash;damn you. I am all right," screeched Jukes.
"Drive them forward. Watch your chance when she pitches. Forward
with 'em. Drive them against the bulkhead. Jam 'em up."</p>

<p>The rush of the sailors into the seething 'tween-deck was like
a splash of cold water into a boiling cauldron. The commotion
sank for a moment.</p>

<p>The bulk of Chinamen were locked in such a compact scrimmage
that, linking their arms and aided by an appalling dive of the
ship, the seamen sent it forward in one great shove, like a solid
block. Behind their backs small clusters and loose bodies tumbled
from side to side.</p>

<p>The boatswain performed prodigious feats of strength. With his
long arms open, and each great paw clutching at a stanchion, he
stopped the rush of seven entwined Chinamen rolling like a boulder.
His joints cracked; he said, "Ha!" and they flew apart. But the
carpenter showed the greater intelligence. Without saying a word
to anybody he went back into the alleyway, to fetch several coils
of cargo gear he had seen there&mdash;chain and rope. With these life-lines
were rigged.</p>

<p>There was really no resistance. The struggle, however it began,
had turned into a scramble of blind panic. If the coolies had
started up after their scattered dollars they were by that time
fighting only for their footing. They took each other by the throat
merely to save themselves from being hurled about. Whoever got
a hold anywhere would kick at the others who caught at his legs
and hung on, till a roll sent them flying together across the
deck.</p>

<p>The coming of the white devils was a terror. Had they come to
kill? The individuals torn out of the ruck became very limp in
the seamen's hands: some, dragged aside by the heels, were passive,
like dead bodies, with open, fixed eyes. Here and there a coolie
would fall on his knees as if begging for mercy; several, whom
the excess of fear made unruly, were hit with hard fists between
the eyes, and cowered; while those who were hurt submitted to
rough handling, blinking rapidly without a plaint. Faces streamed
with blood; there were raw places on the shaven heads, scratches,
bruises, torn wounds, gashes. The broken porcelain out of the
chests was mostly responsible for the latter. Here and there a
Chinaman, wild-eyed, with his tail unplaited, nursed a bleeding
sole.</p>

<p>They had been ranged closely, after having been shaken into submission,
cuffed a little to allay excitement, addressed in gruff words
of encouragement that sounded like promises of evil. They sat
on the deck in ghastly, drooping rows, and at the end the carpenter,
with two hands to help him, moved busily from place to place,
setting taut and hitching the life-lines. The boatswain, with
one leg and one arm embracing a stanchion, struggled with a lamp
pressed to his breast, trying to get a light, and growling all
the time like an industrious gorilla. The figures of seamen stooped
repeatedly, with the movements of gleaners, and everything was
being flung into the bunker: clothing, smashed wood, broken china,
and the dollars, too, gathered up in men's jackets. Now and then
a sailor would stagger towards the doorway with his arms full
of rubbish; and dolorous, slanting eyes followed his movements.</p>

<p>With every roll of the ship the long rows of sitting Celestials
would sway forward brokenly, and her headlong dives knocked together
the line of shaven polls from end to end. When the wash of water
rolling on the deck died away for a moment, it seemed to Jukes,
yet quivering from his exertions, that in his mad struggle down
there he had overcome the wind somehow: that a silence had fallen
upon the ship, a silence in which the sea struck thunderously
at her sides.</p>

<p>Everything had been cleared out of the 'tween-deck&mdash;all the wreckage,
as the men said. They stood erect and tottering above the level
of heads and drooping shoulders. Here and there a coolie sobbed
for his breath. Where the high light fell, Jukes could see the
salient ribs of one, the yellow, wistful face of another; bowed
necks; or would meet a dull stare directed at his face. He was
amazed that there had been no corpses; but the lot of them seemed
at their last gasp, and they appeared to him more pitiful than
if they had been all dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the coolies began to speak. The light came and
went on his lean, straining face; he threw his head up like a
baying hound. From the bunker came the sounds of knocking and
the tinkle of some dollars rolling loose; he stretched out his
arm, his mouth yawned black, and the incomprehensible guttural
hooting sounds, that did not seem to belong to a human language,
penetrated Jukes with a strange emotion as if a brute had tried
to be eloquent.</p>

<p>Two more started mouthing what seemed to Jukes fierce denunciations;
the others stirred with grunts and growls. Jukes ordered the hands
out of the 'tweendecks hurriedly. He left last himself, backing
through the door, while the grunts rose to a loud murmur and hands
were extended after him as after a malefactor. The boatswain shot
the bolt, and remarked uneasily, "Seems as if the wind had dropped,
sir."</p>

<p>The seamen were glad to get back into the alleyway. Secretly
each of them thought that at the last moment he could rush out
on deck&mdash;and that was a comfort. There is something horribly repugnant
in the idea of being drowned under a deck. Now they had done with
the Chinamen, they again became conscious of the ship's position.</p>

<p>Jukes on coming out of the alleyway found himself up to the neck
in the noisy water. He gained the bridge, and discovered he could
detect obscure shapes as if his sight had become preternaturally
acute. He saw faint outlines. They recalled not the familiar aspect
of the Nan-Shan, but something remembered&mdash;an old dismantled steamer
he had seen years ago rotting on a mudbank. She recalled that
wreck.</p>

<p>There was no wind, not a breath, except the faint currents created
by the lurches of the ship. The smoke tossed out of the funnel
was settling down upon her deck. He breathed it as he passed forward.
He felt the deliberate throb of the engines, and heard small sounds
that seemed to have survived the great uproar: the knocking of
broken fittings, the rapid tumbling of some piece of wreckage
on the bridge. He perceived dimly the squat shape of his captain
holding on to a twisted bridge-rail, motionless and swaying as
if rooted to the planks. The unexpected stillness of the air oppressed
Jukes.</p>

<p>"We have done it, sir," he gasped.</p>

<p>"Thought you would," said Captain MacWhirr.</p>

<p>"Did you?" murmured Jukes to himself.</p>

<p>"Wind fell all at once," went on the Captain.</p>

<p>Jukes burst out: "If you think it was an easy job&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his captain, clinging to the rail, paid no attention. "According
to the books the worst is not over yet."</p>

<p>"If most of them hadn't been half dead with seasickness and fright,
not one of us would have come out of that 'tween-deck alive,"
said Jukes.</p>

<p>"Had to do what's fair by them," mumbled MacWhirr, stolidly.
"You don't find everything in books."</p>

<p>"Why, I believe they would have risen on us if I hadn't ordered
the hands out of that pretty quick," continued Jukes with warmth.</p>

<p>After the whisper of their shouts, their ordinary tones, so distinct,
rang out very loud to their ears in the amazing stillness of the
air. It seemed to them they were talking in a dark and echoing
vault.</p>

<p>Through a jagged aperture in the dome of clouds the light of
a few stars fell upon the black sea, rising and falling confusedly.
Sometimes the head of a watery cone would topple on board and
mingle with the rolling flurry of foam on the swamped deck; and
the Nan-Shan wallowed heavily at the bottom of a circular cistern
of clouds. This ring of dense vapours, gyrating madly round the
calm of the centre, encompassed the ship like a motionless and
unbroken wall of an aspect inconceivably sinister. Within, the
sea, as if agitated by an internal commotion, leaped in peaked
mounds that jostled each other, slapping heavily against her sides;
and a low moaning sound, the infinite plaint of the storm's fury,
came from beyond the limits of the menacing calm. Captain MacWhirr
remained silent, and Jukes' ready ear caught suddenly the faint,
long-drawn roar of some immense wave rushing unseen under that
thick blackness, which made the appalling boundary of his vision.</p>

<p>"Of course," he started resentfully, "they thought we had caught
at the chance to plunder them. Of course! You said&mdash;pick up the
money. Easier said than done. They couldn't tell what was in our
heads. We came in, smash&mdash;right into the middle of them. Had to
do it by a rush."</p>

<p>"As long as it's done . . . ," mumbled the Captain, without attempting
to look at Jukes. "Had to do what's fair."</p>

<p>"We shall find yet there's the devil to pay when this is over,"
said Jukes, feeling very sore. "Let them only recover a bit, and
you'll see. They will fly at our throats, sir. Don't forget, sir,
she isn't a British ship now. These brutes know it well, too.
The damned Siamese flag."</p>

<p>"We are on board, all the same," remarked Captain MacWhirr.</p>

<p>"The trouble's not over yet," insisted Jukes, prophetically,
reeling and catching on. "She's a wreck," he added, faintly.</p>

<p>"The trouble's not over yet," assented Captain MacWhirr, half
aloud . . . . "Look out for her a minute."</p>

<p>"Are you going off the deck, sir?" asked Jukes, hurriedly, as
if the storm were sure to pounce upon him as soon as he had been
left alone with the ship.</p>

<p>He watched her, battered and solitary, labouring heavily in a
wild scene of mountainous black waters lit by the gleams of distant
worlds. She moved slowly, breathing into the still core of the
hurricane the excess of her strength in a white cloud of steam&mdash;and
the deep-toned vibration of the escape was like the defiant trumpeting
of a living creature of the sea impatient for the renewal of the
contest. It ceased suddenly. The still air moaned. Above Jukes'
head a few stars shone into a pit of black vapours. The inky edge
of the cloud-disc frowned upon the ship under the patch of glittering
sky. The stars, too, seemed to look at her intently, as if for
the last time, and the cluster of their splendour sat like a diadem
on a lowering brow.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr had gone into the chart-room. There was no light
there; but he could feel the disorder of that place where he used
to live tidily. His armchair was upset. The books had tumbled
out on the floor: he scrunched a piece of glass under his boot.
He groped for the matches, and found a box on a shelf with a deep
ledge. He struck one, and puckering the corners of his eyes, held
out the little flame towards the barometer whose glittering top
of glass and metals nodded at him continuously.</p>

<p>It stood very low&mdash;incredibly low, so low that Captain MacWhirr
grunted. The match went out, and hurriedly he extracted another,
with thick, stiff fingers.</p>

<p>Again a little flame flared up before the nodding glass and metal
of the top. His eyes looked at it, narrowed with attention, as
if expecting an imperceptible sign. With his grave face he resembled
a booted and misshapen pagan burning incense before the oracle
of a Joss. There was no mistake. It was the lowest reading he
had ever seen in his life.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr emitted a low whistle. He forgot himself till
the flame diminished to a blue spark, burnt his fingers and vanished.
Perhaps something had gone wrong with the thing!</p>

<p>There was an aneroid glass screwed above the couch. He turned
that way, struck another match, and discovered the white face
of the other instrument looking at him from the bulkhead, meaningly,
not to be gainsaid, as though the wisdom of men were made unerring
by the indifference of matter. There was no room for doubt now.
Captain MacWhirr pshawed at it, and threw the match down.</p>

<p>The worst was to come, then&mdash;and if the books were right this
worst would be very bad. The experience of the last six hours
had enlarged his conception of what heavy weather could be like.
"It'll be terrific," he pronounced, mentally. He had not consciously
looked at anything by the light of the matches except at the barometer;
and yet somehow he had seen that his water-bottle and the two
tumblers had been flung out of their stand. It seemed to give
him a more intimate knowledge of the tossing the ship had gone
through. "I wouldn't have believed it," he thought. And his table
had been cleared, too; his rulers, his pencils, the inkstand&mdash;all
the things that had their safe appointed places&mdash;they were gone,
as if a mischievous hand had plucked them out one by one and flung
them on the wet floor. The hurricane had broken in upon the orderly
arrangements of his privacy. This had never happened before, and
the feeling of dismay reached the very seat of his composure.
And the worst was to come yet! He was glad the trouble in the
'tween-deck had been discovered in time. If the ship had to go
after all, then, at least, she wouldn't be going to the bottom
with a lot of people in her fighting teeth and claw. That would
have been odious. And in that feeling there was a humane intention
and a vague sense of the fitness of things.</p>

<p>These instantaneous thoughts were yet in their essence heavy
and slow, partaking of the nature of the man. He extended his
hand to put back the matchbox in its corner of the shelf. There
were always matches there&mdash;by his order. The steward had his instructions
impressed upon him long before. "A box . . . just there, see?
Not so very full . . . where I can put my hand on it, steward.
Might want a light in a hurry. Can't tell on board ship what you
might want in a hurry. Mind, now."</p>

<p>And of course on his side he would be careful to put it back
in its place scrupulously. He did so now, but before he removed
his hand it occurred to him that perhaps he would never have occasion
to use that box any more. The vividness of the thought checked
him and for an infinitesimal fraction of a second his fingers
closed again on the small object as though it had been the symbol
of all these little habits that chain us to the weary round of
life. He released it at last, and letting himself fall on the
settee, listened for the first sounds of returning wind.</p>

<p>Not yet. He heard only the wash of water, the heavy splashes,
the dull shocks of the confused seas boarding his ship from all
sides. She would never have a chance to clear her decks.</p>

<p>But the quietude of the air was startlingly tense and unsafe,
like a slender hair holding a sword suspended over his head. By
this awful pause the storm penetrated the defences of the man
and unsealed his lips. He spoke out in the solitude and the pitch
darkness of the cabin, as if addressing another being awakened
within his breast.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to lose her," he said half aloud.</p>

<p>He sat unseen, apart from the sea, from his ship, isolated, as
if withdrawn from the very current of his own existence, where
such freaks as talking to himself surely had no place. His palms
reposed on his knees, he bowed his short neck and puffed heavily,
surrendering to a strange sensation of weariness he was not enlightened
enough to recognize for the fatigue of mental stress.</p>

<p>From where he sat he could reach the door of a washstand locker.
There should have been a towel there. There was. Good. . . . He
took it out, wiped his face, and afterwards went on rubbing his
wet head. He towelled himself with energy in the dark, and then
remained motionless with the towel on his knees. A moment passed,
of a stillness so profound that no one could have guessed there
was a man sitting in that cabin. Then a murmur arose.</p>

<p>"She may come out of it yet."</p>

<p>When Captain MacWhirr came out on deck, which he did brusquely,
as though he had suddenly become conscious of having stayed away
too long, the calm had lasted already more than fifteen minutes&mdash;long
enough to make itself intolerable even to his imagination. Jukes,
motionless on the forepart of the bridge, began to speak at once.
His voice, blank and forced as though he were talking through
hard-set teeth, seemed to flow away on all sides into the darkness,
deepening again upon the sea.</p>

<p>"I had the wheel relieved. Hackett began to sing out that he
was done. He's lying in there alongside the steering-gear with
a face like death. At first I couldn't get anybody to crawl out
and relieve the poor devil. That boss'n's worse than no good,
I always said. Thought I would have had to go myself and haul
out one of them by the neck."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," muttered the Captain. He stood watchful by Jukes'
side.</p>

<p>"The second mate's in there, too, holding his head. Is he hurt,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;crazy," said Captain MacWhirr, curtly.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he had a tumble, though."</p>

<p>"I had to give him a push," explained the Captain.</p>

<p>Jukes gave an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"It will come very sudden," said Captain MacWhirr, "and from
over there, I fancy. God only knows though. These books are only
good to muddle your head and make you jumpy. It will be bad, and
there's an end. If we only can steam her round in time to meet
it. . . ."</p>

<p>A minute passed. Some of the stars winked rapidly and vanished.</p>

<p>"You left them pretty safe?" began the Captain abruptly, as though
the silence were unbearable.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of the coolies, sir? I rigged lifelines all
ways across that 'tween-deck."</p>

<p>"Did you? Good idea, Mr. Jukes."</p>

<p>"I didn't . . . think you cared to . . . know," said Jukes&mdash;the
lurching of the ship cut his speech as though somebody had been
jerking him around while he talked&mdash;"how I got on with . . . that
infernal job. We did it. And it may not matter in the end."</p>

<p>"Had to do what's fair, for all&mdash;they are only Chinamen. Give
them the same chance with ourselves&mdash;hang it all. She isn't lost
yet. Bad enough to be shut up below in a gale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what I thought when you gave me the job, sir," interjected
Jukes, moodily.</p>

<p>"&mdash;without being battered to pieces," pursued Captain MacWhirr
with rising vehemence. "Couldn't let that go on in my ship, if
I knew she hadn't five minutes to live. Couldn't bear it, Mr.
Jukes."</p>

<p>A hollow echoing noise, like that of a shout rolling in a rocky
chasm, approached the ship and went away again. The last star,
blurred, enlarged, as if returning to the fiery mist of its beginning,
struggled with the colossal depth of blackness hanging over the
ship&mdash;and went out.</p>

<p>"Now for it!" muttered Captain MacWhirr. "Mr. Jukes."</p>

<p>"Here, sir."</p>

<p>The two men were growing indistinct to each other.</p>

<p>"We must trust her to go through it and come out on the other
side. That's plain and straight. There's no room for Captain Wilson's
storm-strategy here."</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"She will be smothered and swept again for hours," mumbled the
Captain. "There's not much left by this time above deck for the
sea to take away&mdash;unless you or me."</p>

<p>"Both, sir," whispered Jukes, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"You are always meeting trouble half way, Jukes," Captain MacWhirr
remonstrated quaintly. "Though it's a fact that the second mate
is no good. D'ye hear, Mr. Jukes? You would be left alone if.
. . ."</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr interrupted himself, and Jukes, glancing on
all sides, remained silent.</p>

<p>"Don't you be put out by anything," the Captain continued, mumbling
rather fast. "Keep her facing it. They may say what they like,
but the heaviest seas run with the wind. Facing it&mdash;always facing
it&mdash;that's the way to get through. You are a young sailor. Face
it. That's enough for any man. Keep a cool head."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jukes, with a flutter of the heart.</p>

<p>In the next few seconds the Captain spoke to the engine-room
and got an answer.</p>

<p>For some reason Jukes experienced an access of confidence, a
sensation that came from outside like a warm breath, and made
him feel equal to every demand. The distant muttering of the darkness
stole into his ears. He noted it unmoved, out of that sudden belief
in himself, as a man safe in a shirt of mail would watch a point.</p>

<p>The ship laboured without intermission amongst the black hills
of water, paying with this hard tumbling the price of her life.
She rumbled in her depths, shaking a white plummet of steam into
the night, and Jukes' thought skimmed like a bird through the
engine-room, where Mr. Rout&mdash;good man&mdash;was ready. When the rumbling
ceased it seemed to him that there was a pause of every sound,
a dead pause in which Captain MacWhirr's voice rang out startlingly.</p>

<p>"What's that? A puff of wind?"&mdash;it spoke much louder than Jukes
had ever heard it before&mdash;"On the bow. That's right. She may come
out of it yet."</p>

<p>The mutter of the winds drew near apace. In the forefront could
be distinguished a drowsy waking plaint passing on, and far off
the growth of a multiple clamour, marching and expanding. There
was the throb as of many drums in it, a vicious rushing note,
and like the chant of a tramping multitude.</p>

<p>Jukes could no longer see his captain distinctly. The darkness
was absolutely piling itself upon the ship. At most he made out
movements, a hint of elbows spread out, of a head thrown up.</p>

<p>Captain MacWhirr was trying to do up the top button of his oilskin
coat with unwonted haste. The hurricane, with its power to madden
the seas, to sink ships, to uproot trees, to overturn strong walls
and dash the very birds of the air to the ground, had found this
taciturn man in its path, and, doing its utmost, had managed to
wring out a few words. Before the renewed wrath of winds swooped
on his ship, Captain MacWhirr was moved to declare, in a tone
of vexation, as it were: "I wouldn't like to lose her."</p>

<p>He was spared that annoyance.</p>
