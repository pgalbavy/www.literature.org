<p> Quite another case, and having nothing to do with drink, was
that of poor Captain B—.  He used to suffer from sick headaches,
in his young days, every time he was approaching a coast.  Well
over fifty years of age when I knew him, short, stout, dignified,
perhaps a little pompous, he was a man of a singularly well-informed
mind, the least sailor-like in outward aspect, but certainly one
of the best seamen whom it has been my good luck to serve under. 
He was a Plymouth man, I think, the son of a country doctor, and
both his elder boys were studying medicine.  He commanded a big
London ship, fairly well known in her day.  I thought no end of
him, and that is why I remember with a peculiar satisfaction the
last words he spoke to me on board his ship after an eighteen
months’ voyage.  It was in the dock in Dundee, where we had brought
a full cargo of jute from Calcutta.  We had been paid off that
morning, and I had come on board to take my sea-chest away and
to say good-bye.  In his slightly lofty but courteous way he inquired
what were my plans.  I replied that I intended leaving for London
by the afternoon train, and thought of going up for examination
to get my master’s certificate.  I had just enough service for
that.  He commended me for not wasting my time, with such an evident
interest in my case that I was quite surprised; then, rising from
his chair, he said:</p>

<p>"Have you a ship in view after you have passed?"</p>

<p>I answered that I had nothing whatever in view.</p>

<p>He shook hands with me, and pronounced the memorable words:</p>

<p>"If you happen to be in want of employment, remember that as
long as I have a ship you have a ship, too."</p>

<p>In the way of compliment there is nothing to beat this from a
ship’s captain to his second mate at the end of a voyage, when
the work is over and the subordinate is done with.  And there
is a pathos in that memory, for the poor fellow never went to
sea again after all.  He was already ailing when we passed St.
Helena; was laid up for a time when we were off the Western Islands,
but got out of bed to make his Landfall.  He managed to keep up
on deck as far as the Downs, where, giving his orders in an exhausted
voice, he anchored for a few hours to send a wire to his wife
and take aboard a North Sea pilot to help him sail the ship up
the east coast.  He had not felt equal to the task by himself,
for it is the sort of thing that keeps a deep-water man on his
feet pretty well night and day.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Dundee, Mrs. B— was already there, waiting
to take him home.  We travelled up to London by the same train;
but by the time I had managed to get through with my examination
the ship had sailed on her next voyage without him, and, instead
of joining her again, I went by request to see my old commander
in his home.  This is the only one of my captains I have ever
visited in that way.  He was out of bed by then, "quite convalescent,"
as he declared, making a few tottering steps to meet me at the
sitting-room door.  Evidently he was reluctant to take his final
cross-bearings of this earth for a Departure on the only voyage
to an unknown destination a sailor ever undertakes.  And it was
all very nice—the large, sunny room; his deep, easy-chair in a
bow window, with pillows and a footstool; the quiet, watchful
care of the elderly, gentle woman who had borne him five children,
and had not, perhaps, lived with him more than five full years
out of the thirty or so of their married life.  There was also
another woman there in a plain black dress, quite gray-haired,
sitting very erect on her chair with some sewing, from which she
snatched side-glances in his direction, and uttering not a single
word during all the time of my call.  Even when, in due course,
I carried over to her a cup of tea, she only nodded at me silently,
with the faintest ghost of a smile on her tight-set lips.  I imagine
she must have been a maiden sister of Mrs. B— come to help nurse
her brother-in-law. His youngest boy, a late-comer, a great cricketer
it seemed, twelve years old or thereabouts, chattered enthusiastically
of the exploits of W. G. Grace.  And I remember his eldest son,
too, a newly-fledged doctor, who took me out to smoke in the garden,
and, shaking his head with professional gravity, but with genuine
concern, muttered: "Yes, but he doesn’t get back his appetite. 
I don’t like that—I don’t like that at all."  The last sight of
Captain B— I had was as he nodded his head to me out of the bow
window when I turned round to close the front gate.</p>

<p>It was a distinct and complete impression, something that I don’t
know whether to call a Landfall or a Departure.  Certainly he
had gazed at times very fixedly before him with the Landfall’s
vigilant look, this sea-captain seated incongruously in a deep-backed
chair.  He had not then talked to me of employment, of ships,
of being ready to take another command; but he had discoursed
of his early days, in the abundant but thin flow of a wilful invalid’s
talk.  The women looked worried, but sat still, and I learned
more of him in that interview than in the whole eighteen months
we had sailed together.  It appeared he had "served his time"
in the copper-ore trade, the famous copper-ore trade of old days
between Swansea and the Chilian coast, coal out and ore in, deep-loaded
both ways, as if in wanton defiance of the great Cape Horn seas—a
work, this, for staunch ships, and a great school of staunchness
for West-Country seamen.  A whole fleet of copper-bottomed barques,
as strong in rib and planking, as well-found in gear, as ever
was sent upon the seas, manned by hardy crews and commanded by
young masters, was engaged in that now long defunct trade.  "That
was the school I was trained in," he said to me almost boastfully,
lying back amongst his pillows with a rug over his legs.  And
it was in that trade that he obtained his first command at a very
early age.  It was then that he mentioned to me how, as a young
commander, he was always ill for a few days before making land
after a long passage.  But this sort of sickness used to pass
off with the first sight of a familiar landmark.  Afterwards,
he added, as he grew older, all that nervousness wore off completely;
and I observed his weary eyes gaze steadily ahead, as if there
had been nothing between him and the straight line of sea and
sky, where whatever a seaman is looking for is first bound to
appear.  But I have also seen his eyes rest fondly upon the faces
in the room, upon the pictures on the wall, upon all the familiar
objects of that home, whose abiding and clear image must have
flashed often on his memory in times of stress and anxiety at
sea.  Was he looking out for a strange Landfall, or taking with
an untroubled mind the bearings for his last Departure?</p>

<p>It is hard to say; for in that voyage from which no man returns
Landfall and Departure are instantaneous, merging together into
one moment of supreme and final attention.  Certainly I do not
remember observing any sign of faltering in the set expression
of his wasted face, no hint of the nervous anxiety of a young
commander about to make land on an uncharted shore.  He had had
too much experience of Departures and Landfalls!  And had he not
"served his time" in the famous copper-ore trade out of the Bristol
Channel, the work of the staunchest ships afloat, and the school
of staunch seamen?</p>
