<p>No man succeeds in everything he undertakes. In that sense we
are all failures. The great point is not to fail in ordering and
sustaining the effort of our life. In this matter vanity is what
leads us astray. It is our vanity which hurries us into situations
from which we must come out damaged. Whereas pride is our safeguard
by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our endeavour, as much
as by the virtue of its sustaining power.</p>

<p>General D'Hubert was proud and reserved. He had not been damaged
by casual love affairs successful or otherwise. In his war-scarred
body his heart at forty remained unscratched. Entering with reserve
into his sister's matrimonial plans, he felt himself falling irremediably
in love as one falls off a roof. He was too proud to be frightened.
Indeed, the sensation was too delightful to be alarming.</p>

<p>The inexperience of a man of forty is a much more serious thing
than the inexperience of a youth of twenty, for it is not helped
out by the rashness of hot blood. The girl was mysterious, as
all young girls are, by the mere effect of their guarded ingenuity;
and to him the mysteriousness of that young girl appeared exceptional
and fascinating. But there was nothing mysterious about the arrangements
of the match which Madame Léonie had arranged. There was nothing
peculiar, either. It was a very appropriate match, commending
itself extremely to the young lady's mother (her father was dead)
and tolerable to the young lady's uncle&mdash;an old <em>émigré</em>,
lately returned from Germany, and pervading cane in hand like
a lean ghost of the <em>ancien régime</em> in a long-skirted brown
coat and powdered hair, the garden walks of the young lady's ancestral
home.</p>

<p>General D'Hubert was not the man to be satisfied merely with
the girl and the fortune&mdash;when it came to the point. His pride&mdash;and
pride aims always at true success&mdash;would be satisfied with nothing
short of love. But as pride excludes vanity, he could not imagine
any reason why this mysterious creature, with deep and candid
eyes of a violet colour, should have any feeling for him warmer
than indifference. The young lady (her name was Adèle) baffled
every attempt at a clear understanding on that point. It is true
that the attempts were clumsy and timidly made, because by then
General D'Hubert had become acutely aware of the number of his
years, of his wounds, of his many moral imperfections, of his
secret unworthiness&mdash;and had incidentally learned by experience
the meaning of the word funk. As far as he could make it out she
seemed to imply that with a perfect confidence in her mother's
affection and sagacity she had no pronounced antipathy for the
person of General D'Hubert; and that this was quite sufficient
for a well-brought-up dutiful young lady to begin married life
upon. This view hurt and tormented the pride of General D'Hubert.
And yet, he asked himself with a sort of sweet despair, What more
could he expect? She had a quiet and luminous forehead; her violet
eyes laughed while the lines of her lips and chin remained composed
in an admirable gravity. All this was set off by such a glorious
mass of fair hair, by a complexion so marvellous, by such a grace
of expression, that General D'Hubert really never found the opportunity
to examine, with sufficient detachment, the lofty exigencies of
his pride. In fact, he became shy of that line of inquiry, since
it had led once or twice to a crisis of solitary passion in which
it was borne upon him that he loved her enough to kill her rather
than lose her. From such passages, not unknown to men of forty,
he would come out broken, exhausted, remorseful, a little dismayed.
He derived, however, considerable comfort from the quietist practice
of sitting up now and then half the night by an open window, and
meditating upon the wonder of her existence, like a believer lost
in the mystic contemplation of his faith.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that all these variations of his inward
state were made manifest to the world. General D'Hubert found
no difficulty in appearing wreathed in smiles: because, in fact,
he was very happy. He followed the established rules of his condition,
sending over flowers (from his sister's garden and hothouses)
early every morning, and a little later following himself to have
lunch with his intended, her mother, and her <em>émigré</em> uncle.
The middle of the day was spent in strolling or sitting in the
shade. A watchful deferential gallantry trembling on the verge
of tenderness, was the note of their intercourse on his side&mdash;with
a playful turn of the phrase concealing the profound trouble of
his whole being caused by her inaccessible nearness. Late in the
afternoon General D'Hubert walked home between the fields of vines,
sometimes intensely miserable, sometimes supremely happy, sometimes
pensively sad, but always feeling a special intensity of existence:
that elation common to artists, poets, and lovers, to men haunted
by a great passion, by a noble thought or a new vision of plastic
beauty.</p>

<p>The outward world at that time did not exist with any special
distinctness for General D'Hubert. One evening, however, crossing
a ridge from which he could see both houses, General D'Hubert
became aware of two figures far down the road. The day had been
divine. The festal decoration of the inflamed sky cast a gentle
glow on the sober tints of the southern land. The gray rocks,
the brown fields, the purple undulating distances harmonised in
luminous accord, exhaled already the scents of the evening. The
two figures down the road presented themselves like two rigid
and wooden silhouettes all black on the ribbon of white dust.
General D'Hubert made out the long, straight-cut military <em>capotes</em>,
buttoned closely right up to the black stocks, the cocked hats,
the lean carven brown countenances&mdash;old soldiers&mdash;<em>vieilles
moustaches!</em> The taller of the two had a black patch over
one eye; the other's hard, dry countenance presented some bizarre
disquieting peculiarity which, on nearer approach, proved to be
the absence of the tip of the nose. Lifting their hands with one
movement to salute the slightly lame civilian walking with a thick
stick, they inquired for the house where the General Baron D'Hubert
lived and what was the best way to get speech with him quietly.</p>

<p>"If you think this quiet enough," said General D'Hubert, looking
round at the ripening vine-fields framed in purple lines and dominated
by the nest of gray and drab walls of a village clustering around
the top of a steep, conical hill, so that the blunt church tower
seemed but the shape of a crowning rock&mdash;"if you think this quiet
enough you can speak to him at once. And I beg you, comrades,
to speak openly with perfect confidence."</p>

<p>They stepped back at this and raised again their hands to their
hats with marked ceremoniousness. Then the one with the chipped
nose, speaking for both, remarked that the matter was confidential
enough and to be arranged discreetly. Their general quarters were
in that village over there where the infernal clodhoppers&mdash;damn
their false royalist hearts&mdash;looked remarkably cross-eyed at three
unassuming military men. For the present he should only ask for
the name of General D'Hubert's friends.</p>

<p>"What friends?" said the astonished General D'Hubert, completely
off the track. "I am staying with my brother-in-law over there."</p>

<p>"Well, he will do for one," suggested the chipped veteran.</p>

<p>"We're the friends of General Feraud," interjected the other,
who had kept silent till then, only glowering with his one eye
at the man who had never loved the emperor. That was something
to look at. For even the gold-laced Judases who had sold him to
the English, the marshals and princes, had loved him at some time
or other. But this man had <em>never</em> loved the emperor. General
Feraud had said so distinctly.</p>

<p>General D'Hubert felt a sort of inward blow in his chest. For
an infinitesimal fraction of a second it was as if the spinning
of the earth had become perceptible with an awful, slight rustle
in the eternal stillness of space. But that was the noise of the
blood in his ears and passed off at once. Involuntarily he murmured:</p>

<p>"Feraud! I had forgotten his existence."</p>

<p>"He's existing at present, very uncomfortably it is true, in
the infamous inn of that nest of savages up there," said the one-eyed
cuirassier drily. "We arrived in your parts an hour ago on post
horses. He's awaiting our return with impatience. There is hurry,
you know. The general has broken the ministerial order of sojourn
to obtain from you the satisfaction he's entitled to by the laws
of honour, and naturally he's anxious to have it all over before
the <em>gendarmerie</em> gets the scent."</p>

<p>The other elucidated the idea a little further.</p>

<p>"Get back on the quiet&mdash;you understand? Phitt! No one the wiser.
We have broken out, too. Your friend the king would be glad to
cut off our scurvy pittances at the first chance. It's a risk.
But honour before everything."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert had recovered his power of speech.</p>

<p>"So you come like this along the road to invite me to a throat-cutting
match with that&mdash;that..." A laughing sort of rage took possession
of him.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>His fists on his hips, he roared without restraint while they
stood before him lank and straight, as unexpected as though they
had been shot up with a snap through a trapdoor in the ground.
Only four-and-twenty months ago the masters of Europe, they had
already the air of antique ghosts, they seemed less substantial
in their faded coats than their own narrow shadows falling so
black across the white road&mdash;the military and grotesque shadows
of twenty years of war and conquests. They had the outlandish
appearance of two imperturbable bronzes of the religion of the
sword. And General D'Hubert, also one of the ex-masters of Europe,
laughed at these serious phantoms standing in his way.</p>

<p>Said one, indicating the laughing general with a jerk of the
head:</p>

<p>"A merry companion that."</p>

<p>"There are some of us that haven't smiled from the day the Other
went away," said his comrade.</p>

<p>A violent impulse to set upon and beat these unsubstantial wraiths
to the ground frightened General D'Hubert. He ceased laughing
suddenly. His urgent desire now was to get rid of them, to get
them away from his sight quickly before he lost control of himself.
He wondered at this fury he felt rising in his breast. But he
had no time to look into that peculiarity just then.</p>

<p>"I understand your wish to be done with me as quickly as possible.
Then why waste time in empty ceremonies. Do you see that wood
there at the foot of that slope? Yes, the wood of pines. Let us
meet there to-morrow at sunrise. I will bring with me my sword
or my pistols or both if you like."</p>

<p>The seconds of General Feraud looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Pistols, general," said the cuirassier.</p>

<p>"So be it. <em>Au revoir</em>&mdash;to-morrow morning. Till then let
me advise you to keep close if you don't want the <em>gendarmerie</em>
making inquiries about you before dark. Strangers are rare in
this part of the country."</p>

<p>They saluted in silence. General D'Hubert, turning his back on
their retreating figures, stood still in the middle of the road
for a long time, biting his lower lip and looking on the ground.
Then he began to walk straight before him, thus retracing his
steps till he found himself before the park gate of his intended's
home. Motionless he stared through the bars at the front of the
house gleaming clear beyond the thickets and trees. Footsteps
were heard on the gravel, and presently a tall stooping shape
emerged from the lateral alley following the inner side of the
park wall.</p>

<p>Le Chevalier de Valmassigue, uncle of the adorable Adèle, ex-brigadier
in the army of the princes, bookbinder in Altona, afterwards shoemaker
(with a great reputation for elegance in the fit of ladies' shoes)
in another small German town, wore silk stockings on his lean
shanks, low shoes with silver buckles, a brocaded waistcoat. A
long-skirted coat <em>à la Française</em> covered loosely his
bowed back. A small three-cornered hat rested on a lot of powdered
hair tied behind in a queue.</p>

<p>"<em>Monsieur le Chevalier</em>," called General D'Hubert softly.</p>

<p>"What? You again here, <em>mon ami</em>? Have you forgotten something?"</p>

<p>"By heavens! That's just it. I have forgotten something. I am
come to tell you of it. No&mdash;outside. Behind this wall. It's too
ghastly a thing to be let in at all where she lives."</p>

<p>The Chevalier came out at once with that benevolent resignation
some old people display towards the fugue of youth. Older by a
quarter of a century than General D'Hubert, he looked upon him
in the secret of his heart as a rather troublesome youngster in
love. He had heard his enigmatical words very well, but attached
no undue importance to what a mere man of forty so hard hit was
likely to do or say. The turn of mind of the generation of Frenchmen
grown up during the years of his exile was almost unintelligible
to him. Their sentiments appeared to him unduly violent, lacking
fineness and measure, their language needlessly exaggerated. He
joined the general on the road, and they made a few steps in silence,
the general trying to master his agitation and get proper control
of his voice.</p>

<p>"Chevalier, it is perfectly true. I forgot something. I forgot
till half an hour ago that I had an urgent affair of honour on
my hands. It's incredible but so it is!"</p>

<p>All was still for a moment. Then in the profound evening silence
of the countryside the thin, aged voice of the Chevalier was heard
trembling slightly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur! That's an indignity."</p>

<p>It was his first thought. The girl born during his exile, the
posthumous daughter of his poor brother, murdered by a band of
Jacobins, had grown since his return very dear to his old heart,
which had been starving on mere memories of affection for so many
years.</p>

<p>"It is an inconceivable thing &mdash;I say. A man settles such
affairs before he thinks of asking for a young girl's hand. Why!
If you had forgotten for ten days longer you would have been married
before your memory returned to you. In my time men did not forget
such things&mdash;nor yet what's due to the feelings of an innocent
young woman. If I did not respect them myself I would qualify
your conduct in a way which you would not like."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert relieved himself frankly by a groan.</p>

<p>"Don't let that consideration prevent you. You run no risk of
offending her mortally."</p>

<p>But the old man paid no attention to this lover's nonsense. It's
doubtful whether he even heard.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "What's the nature of..."</p>

<p>"Call it a youthful folly, <em>Monsieur le Chevalier</em>. An
inconceivable, incredible result of..."</p>

<p>He stopped short. "He will never believe the story," he thought.
"He will only think I am taking him for a fool and get offended."
General D'Hubert spoke up again. "Yes, originating in youthful
folly it has become..."</p>

<p>The Chevalier interrupted. "Well then it must be arranged."</p>

<p>"Arranged."</p>

<p>"Yes. No matter what it may cost your <em>amour propre</em>.
You should have remembered you were engaged. You forgot that,
too, I suppose. And then you go and forget your quarrel. It's
the most revolting exhibition of levity I ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Chevalier! You don't imagine I have been picking
up that quarrel last time I was in Paris or anything of the sort.
Do you?"</p>

<p>"Eh? What matters the precise date of your insane conduct!" exclaimed
the Chevalier testily. "The principal thing is to arrange it..."</p>

<p>Noticing General D'Hubert getting restive and trying to place
a word, the old <em>émigré</em> raised his arm and added with
dignity:</p>

<p>"I've been a soldier, too. I would never dare to suggest a doubtful
step to the man whose name my niece is to bear. I tell you that
<em>entre gallants hommes</em> an affair can be always arranged."</p>

<p>"But, <em>saperlotte, Monsieur le Chevalier</em>, it's fifteen
or sixteen years ago. I was a lieutenant of Hussars then."</p>

<p>The old Chevalier seemed confounded by the vehemently despairing
tone of this information.</p>

<p>"You were a lieutenant of Hussars sixteen years ago?" he mumbled
in a dazed manner.</p>

<p>"Why, yes! You did not suppose I was made a general in my cradle
like a royal prince."</p>

<p>In the deepening purple twilight of the fields, spread with vine
leaves, backed by a low band of sombre crimson in the west, the
voice of the old ex-officer in the army of the princes sounded
collected, punctiliously civil.</p>

<p>"Do I dream? Is this a pleasantry? Or do you mean me to understand
that you have been hatching an affair of honour for sixteen years?"</p>

<p>"It has clung to me for that length of time. That is my precise
meaning. The quarrel itself is not to be explained easily. We
have been on the ground several times during that time of course."</p>

<p>"What manners! What horrible perversion of manliness! Nothing
can account for such inhumanity but the sanguinary madness of
the Revolution which has tainted a whole generation," mused the
returned <em>émigré</em> in a low tone. "Who is your adversary?"
he asked a little louder.</p>

<p>"What? My adversary! His name is Feraud." Shadowy in his_ tricorne_
and old-fashioned clothes like a bowed thin ghost of the <em>ancien
régime</em> the Chevalier voiced a ghostly memory.</p>

<p>"I can remember the feud about little Sophie Derval between Monsieur
de Brissac, captain in the Bodyguards and d'Anjorrant. Not the
pockmarked one. The other. The Beau d'Anjorrant as they called
him. They met three times in eighteen months in a most gallant
manner. It was the fault of that little Sophie, too, who <em>would</em>
keep on playing..."</p>

<p>"This is nothing of the kind," interrupted General D'Hubert.
He laughed a little sardonically. "Not at all so simple," he added.
"Nor yet half so reasonable," he finished inaudibly between his
teeth and ground them with rage.</p>

<p>After this sound nothing troubled the silence for a long time
till the Chevalier asked without animation:</p>

<p>"What is he&mdash;this Feraud?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant of Hussars, too &mdash;I mean he's a general. A Gascon.
Son of a blacksmith, I believe."</p>

<p>"There! I thought so. That Bonaparte had a special predilection
for the <em>canaille</em>. I don't mean this for you, D'Hubert.
You are one of us, though you have served this usurper who..."</p>

<p>"Let's leave him out of this," broke in General D'Hubert.</p>

<p>The Chevalier shrugged his peaked shoulders.</p>

<p>"A Feraud of sorts. Offspring of a blacksmith and some village
troll.... See what comes of mixing yourself up with that sort
of people."</p>

<p>"You have made shoes yourself, Chevalier."</p>

<p>"Yes. But I am not the son of a shoemaker. Neither are you, Monsieur
D'Hubert. You and I have something that your Bonaparte's, princes,
dukes, and marshals have not because there's no power on earth
that could give it to them," retorted the <em>émigré</em>, with
the rising animation of a man who has got hold of a hopeful argument.
"Those people don't exist&mdash;all these Ferauds. Feraud! What is
Feraud? A <em>va-nu-pieds</em> disguised into a general by a Corsican
adventurer masquerading as an emperor. There is no earthly reason
for a D'Hubert to <em>s'encanailler</em> by a duel with a person
of that sort. You can make your excuses to him perfectly well.
And if the <em>manant</em> takes it into his head to decline them
you may simply refuse to meet him." "You say I may do that?" "Yes.
With the clearest conscience." "<em>Monsieur le Chevalier!</em>
To what do you think you have returned from your emigration?"</p>

<p>This was said in such a startling tone that the old exile raised
sharply his bowed head, glimmering silvery white under the points
of the little <em>tricorne</em>. For a long time he made no sound.</p>

<p>"God knows!" he said at last, pointing with a slow and grave
gesture at a tall roadside cross mounted on a block of stone and
stretching its arms of forged stone all black against the darkening
red band in the sky. "God knows! If it were not for this emblem,
which I remember seeing in this spot as a child, I would wonder
to what we, who have remained faithful to our God and our king,
have returned. The very voices of the people have changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a changed France," said General D'Hubert. He had
regained his calm. His tone was slightly ironic. "Therefore, I
cannot take your advice. Besides, how is one to refuse to be bitten
by a dog that means to bite? It's impracticable. Take my word
for it. He isn't a man to be stopped by apologies or refusals.
But there are other ways. I could, for instance, send a mounted
messenger with a word to the brigadier of the <em>gendarmerie</em>
in Senlac. These fellows are liable to arrest on my simple order.
It would make some talk in the army, both the organised and the
disbanded. Especially the disbanded. All <em>canaille</em>. All
my comrades once&mdash;the companions in arms of Armand D'Hubert. But
what need a D'Hubert care what people who don't exist may think?
Or better still, I might get my brother-in-law to send for the
mayor of the village and give him a hint. No more would be needed
to get the three 'brigands' set upon with flails and pitchforks
and hunted into some nice deep wet ditch. And nobody the wiser!
It has been done only ten miles from here to three poor devils
of the disbanded Red Lancers of the Guard going to their homes.
What says your conscience, Chevalier? Can a D'Hubert do that thing
to three men who do not exist?"</p>

<p>A few stars had come out on the blue obscurity, clear as crystal,
of the sky. The dry, thin voice of the Chevalier spoke harshly.</p>

<p>"Why are you telling me all this?"</p>

<p>The general seized a withered, frail old hand with a strong grip.</p>

<p>"Because I owe you my fullest confidence. Who could tell Adèle
but you? You understand why I dare not trust my brother-in-law
nor yet my own sister. Chevalier! I have been so near doing these
things that I tremble yet. You don't know how terrible this duel
appears to me. And there's no escape from it."</p>

<p>He murmured after a pause, "It's a fatality," dropped the Chevalier's
passive hand, and said in his ordinary conversational voice:</p>

<p>"I shall have to go without seconds. If it is my lot to remain
on the ground, you at least will know all that can be made known
of this affair."</p>

<p>The shadowy ghost of the <em>ancien régime</em> seemed to have
become more bowed during the conversation.</p>

<p>"How am I to keep an indifferent face this evening before those
two women?" he groaned. "General! I find it very difficult to
forgive you."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert made no answer.</p>

<p>"Is your cause good at least?"</p>

<p>"I am innocent."</p>

<p>This time he seized the Chevalier's ghostly arm above the elbow,
gave it a mighty squeeze.</p>

<p>"I must kill him," he hissed, and opening his hand strode away
down the road.</p>

<p>The delicate attentions of his adoring sister had secured for
the general perfect liberty of movement in the house where he
was a guest. He had even his own entrance through a small door
in one corner of the orangery. Thus he was not exposed that evening
to the necessity of dissembling his agitation before the calm
ignorance of the other inmates. He was glad of it. It seemed to
him that if he had to open his lips, he would break out into horrible
imprecation, start breaking furniture, smashing china and glasses.
From the moment he opened the private door, and while ascending
the twenty-eight steps of winding staircase, giving access to
the corridor on which his room opened, he went through a horrible
and humiliating scene in which an infuriated madman, with bloodshot
eyes and a foaming mouth, played inconceivable havoc with everything
inanimate that may be found in a well-appointed dining room. When
he opened the door of his apartment the fit was over, and his
bodily fatigue was so great that he had to catch at the backs
of the chairs as he crossed the room to reach a low and broad
divan on which he let himself fall heavily. His moral prostration
was still greater. That brutality of feeling, which he had known
only when charging sabre in hand, amazed this man of forty, who
did not recognise in it the instinctive fury of his menaced passion.
It was the revolt of jeopardised desire. In his mental and bodily
exhaustion it got cleared, fined down, purified into a sentiment
of melancholy despair at having, perhaps, to die before he had
taught this beautiful girl to love him.</p>

<p>On that night General D'Hubert, either stretched on his back
with his hands over his eyes or lying on his breast, with his
face buried in a cushion, made the full pilgrimage of emotions.
Nauseating disgust at the absurdity of the situation, dread of
the fate that could play such a vile trick on a man, awe at the
remote consequences of an apparently insignificant and ridiculous
event in his past, doubt of his own fitness to conduct his existence
and mistrust of his best sentiments&mdash;for what the devil did he
want to go to Fouché for?&mdash;he knew them all in turn. "I am an
idiot, neither more nor less," he thought. "A sensitive idiot.
Because I overheard two men talk in a café... I am an idiot afraid
of lies&mdash;whereas in life it is only truth that matters."</p>

<p>Several times he got up, and walking about in his socks, so as
not to be heard by anybody downstairs, drank all the water he
could find in the dark. And he tasted the torments of jealousy,
too. She would marry somebody else. His very soul writhed. The
tenacity of that Feraud, the awful persistence of that imbecile
brute came to him with the tremendous force of a relentless fatality.
General D'Hubert trembled as he put down the empty water ewer.
"He will have me," he thought. General D'Hubert was tasting every
emotion that life has to give. He had in his dry mouth the faint,
sickly flavour of fear, not the honourable fear of a young girl's
candid and amused glance, but the fear of death and the honourable
man's fear of cowardice.</p>

<p>But if true courage consists in going out to meet an odious danger
from which our body, soul and heart recoil together General D'Hubert
had the opportunity to practise it for the first time in his life.
He had charged exultingly at batteries and infantry squares and
ridden with messages through a hail of bullets without thinking
anything about it. His business now was to sneak out unheard,
at break of day, to an obscure and revolting death. General D'Hubert
never hesitated. He carried two pistols in a leather bag which
he slung over his shoulder. Before he had crossed the garden his
mouth was dry again. He picked two oranges. It was only after
shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness.</p>

<p>He stepped out disregarding it, and after going a few yards regained
the command of his legs. He sucked an orange as he walked. It
was a colourless and pellucid dawn. The wood of pines detached
its columns of brown trunks and its dark-green canopy very clearly
against the rocks of the gray hillside behind. He kept his eyes
fixed on it steadily. That temperamental, good-humoured coolness
in the face of danger, which made him an officer liked by his
men and appreciated by his superiors, was gradually asserting
itself. It was like going into battle. Arriving at the edge of
the wood he sat down on a boulder, holding the other orange in
his hand, and thought that he had come ridiculously early on the
ground. Before very long, however, he heard the swishing of bushes,
footsteps on the hard ground, and the sounds of a disjointed loud
conversation. A voice somewhere behind him said boastfully, "He's
game for my bag."</p>

<p>He thought to himself, "Here they are. What's this about game?
Are they talking of me?" And becoming aware of the orange in his
hand he thought further, "These are very good oranges. Leonie's
own tree. I may just as well eat this orange instead of flinging
it away."</p>

<p>Emerging from a tangle of rocks and bushes, General Feraud and
his seconds discovered General D'Hubert engaged in peeling the
orange. They stood still waiting till he looked up. Then the seconds
raised their hats, and General Feraud, putting his hands behind
his back, walked aside a little way.</p>

<p>"I am compelled to ask one of you, messieurs, to act for me.
I have brought no friends. Will you?"</p>

<p>The one-eyed cuirassier said judicially:</p>

<p>"That cannot be refused."</p>

<p>The other veteran remarked:</p>

<p>"It's awkward all the same."</p>

<p>"Owing to the state of the people's minds in this part of the
country there was no one I could trust with the object of your
presence here,"  explained General D'Hubert urbanely. They saluted,
looked round, and remarked both together:</p>

<p>"Poor ground."</p>

<p>"It's unfit."</p>

<p>"Why bother about ground, measurements, and so on. Let us simplify
matters. Load the two pairs of pistols. I will take those of General
Feraud and let him take mine. Or, better still, let us take a
mixed pair. One of each pair. Then we will go into the wood while
you remain outside. We did not come here for ceremonies, but for
war. War to the death. Any ground is good enough for that. If
I fall you must leave me where I lie and clear out. It wouldn't
be healthy for you to be found hanging about here after that."</p>

<p>It appeared after a short parley that General Feraud was willing
to accept these conditions. While the seconds were loading the
pistols he could be heard whistling, and was seen to rub his hands
with an air of perfect contentment. He flung off his coat briskly,
and General D'Hubert took off his own and folded it carefully
on a stone.</p>

<p>"Suppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood
and let him enter exactly in ten minutes from now," suggested
General D'Hubert calmly, but feeling as if he were giving directions
for his own execution. This, however, was his last moment of weakness.</p>

<p>"Wait! Let us compare watches first."</p>

<p>He pulled out his own. The officer with the chipped nose went
over to borrow the watch of General Feraud. They bent their heads
over them for a time.</p>

<p>"That's it. At four minutes to five by yours. Seven to, by mine."</p>

<p>It was the cuirassier who remained by the side of General D'Hubert,
keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch
he held in the palm of his hand. He opened his mouth wide, waiting
for the beat of the last second, long before he snapped out the
word:</p>

<p>"<em>Avancez!</em>"</p>

<p>General D'Hubert moved on, passing from the glaring sunshine
of the Provençal morning into the cool and aromatic shade of the
pines. The ground was clear between the reddish trunks, whose
multitude, leaning at slightly different angles, confused his
eye at first. It was like going into battle. The commanding quality
of confidence in himself woke up in his breast. He was all to
his affair. The problem was how to kill his adversary. Nothing
short of that would free him from this imbecile nightmare. "It's
no use wounding that brute," he thought. He was known as a resourceful
officer. His comrades, years ago, used to call him "the strategist."
And it was a fact that he could think in the presence of the enemy,
whereas Feraud had been always a mere fighter. But a dead shot,
unluckily.</p>

<p>"I must draw his fire at the greatest possible range," said General
D'Hubert to himself.</p>

<p>At that moment he saw something white moving far off between
the trees. The shirt of his adversary. He stepped out at once
between the trunks exposing himself freely, then quick as lightning
leaped back. It had been a risky move, but it succeeded in its
object. Almost simultaneously with the pop of a shot a small piece
of bark chipped off by the bullet stung his ear painfully.</p>

<p>And now General Feraud, with one shot expended, was getting cautious.
Peeping round his sheltering tree, General D'Hubert could not
see him at all. This ignorance of his adversary's whereabouts
carried with it a sense of insecurity. General D'Hubert felt himself
exposed on his flanks and rear. Again something white fluttered
in his sight. Ha! The enemy was still on his front then. He had
feared a turning movement. But, apparently, General Feraud was
not thinking of it. General D'Hubert saw him pass without special
haste from one tree to another in the straight line of approach.
With great firmness of mind General D'Hubert stayed his hand.
Too far yet. He knew he was no marksman. His must be a waiting
game&mdash;to kill.</p>

<p>He sank down to the ground wishing to take advantage of the greater
thickness of the trunk. Extended at full length, head on to his
enemy, he kept his person completely protected. Exposing himself
would not do now because the other was too near by this time.
A conviction that Feraud would presently do something rash was
like balm to General D'Hubert's soul. But to keep his chin raised
off the ground was irksome, and not much use either. He peeped
round, exposing a fraction of his head, with dread but really
with little risk. His enemy, as a matter of fact, did not expect
to see anything of him so low down as that. General D'Hubert caught
a fleeting view of General Feraud shifting trees again with deliberate
caution. "He despises my shooting," he thought, with that insight
into the mind of his antagonist which is of such great help in
winning battles. It confirmed him in his tactics of immobility.
"Ah! if I only could watch my rear as well as my front!" he thought,
longing for the impossible.</p>

<p>It required some fortitude to lay his pistols down. But on a
sudden impulse General D'Hubert did this very gently&mdash;one on each
side. He had been always looked upon as a bit of a dandy, because
he used to shave and put on a clean shirt on the days of battle.
As a matter of fact he had been always very careful of his personal
appearance. In a man of nearly forty, in love with a young and
charming girl, this praiseworthy self-respect may run to such
little weaknesses as, for instance, being provided with an elegant
leather folding case containing a small ivory comb and fitted
with a piece of looking-glass on the outside. General D'Hubert,
his hands being free, felt in his breeches pockets for that implement
of innocent vanity, excusable in the possessor of long silky moustaches.
He drew it out, and then, with the utmost coolness and promptitude,
turned himself over on his back. In this new attitude, his head
raised a little, holding the looking-glass in one hand just clear
of his tree, he squinted into it with one eye while the other
kept a direct watch on the rear of his position. Thus was proved
Napoleon's saying, that for a French soldier the word impossible
does not exist. He had the right tree nearly filling the field
of his little mirror.</p>

<p>"If he moves from there," he said to himself exultingly, "I am
bound to see his legs. And in any case he can't come upon me unawares."</p>

<p>And sure enough he saw the boots of General Feraud flash in and
out, eclipsing for an instant everything else reflected in the
little mirror. He shifted its position accordingly. But having
to form his judgment of the change from that indirect view, he
did not realise that his own feet and a portion of his legs were
now in plain and startling view of General Feraud.</p>

<p>General Feraud had been getting gradually impressed by the amazing
closeness with which his enemy had been keeping cover. He had
spotted the right tree with bloodthirsty precision. He was absolutely
certain of it. And yet he had not been able to sight as much as
the tip of an ear. As he had been looking for it at the level
of about five feet ten inches it was no great wonder&mdash;but it seemed
very wonderful to General Feraud.</p>

<p>The first view of these feet and legs determined a rush of blood
to his head. He literally staggered behind his tree, and had to
steady himself with his hand. The other was lying on the ground&mdash;on
the ground! Perfectly still, too! Exposed! What did it mean?...
The notion that he had knocked his adversary over at the first
shot then entered General Feraud's head. Once there, it grew with
every second of attentive gazing, overshadowing every other supposition&mdash;irresistible&mdash;triumphant&mdash;ferocious.</p>

<p>"What an ass I was to think I could have missed him!" he said
to himself. "He was exposed <em>en plein</em>&mdash;the fool&mdash;for quite
a couple of seconds."</p>

<p>And the general gazed at the motionless limbs, the last vestiges
of surprise fading before an unbounded admiration of his skill.</p>

<p>"Turned up his toes! By the god of war that was a shot!" he continued
mentally. "Got it through the head just where I aimed, staggered
behind that tree, rolled over on his back and died."</p>

<p>And he stared. He stared, forgetting to move, almost awed, almost
sorry. But for nothing in the world would he have had it undone.
Such a shot! Such a shot! Rolled over on his back, and died!</p>

<p>For it was this helpless position, lying on the back, that shouted
its sinister evidence at General Feraud. He could not possibly
imagine that it might have been deliberately assumed by a living
man. It was inconceivable. It was beyond the range of sane supposition.
There was no possibility to guess the reason for it. And it must
be said that General D'Hubert's turned-up feet looked thoroughly
dead. General Feraud expanded his lungs for a stentorian shout
to his seconds, but from what he felt to be an excessive scrupulousness,
refrained for a while.</p>

<p>"I will just go and see first whether he breathes yet," he mumbled
to himself, stepping out from behind his tree. This was immediately
perceived by the resourceful General D'Hubert. He concluded it
to be another shift. When he lost the boots out of the field of
the mirror, he became uneasy. General Feraud had only stepped
a little out of the line, but his adversary could not possibly
have supposed him walking up with perfect unconcern. General D'Hubert,
beginning to wonder where the other had dodged to, was come upon
so suddenly that the first warning he had of his danger consisted
in the long, early-morning shadow of his enemy falling aslant
on his outstretched legs. He had not even heard a footfall on
the soft ground between the trees!</p>

<p>It was too much even for his coolness. He jumped up instinctively,
leaving the pistols on the ground. The irresistible instinct of
most people (unless totally paralysed by discomfiture) would have
been to stoop&mdash;exposing themselves to the risk of being shot down
in that position. Instinct, of course, is irreflective. It is
its very definition. But it may be an inquiry worth pursuing,
whether in reflective mankind the mechanical promptings of instinct
are not affected by the customary mode of thought. Years ago,
in his young days, Armand D'Hubert, the reflective promising officer,
had emitted the opinion that in warfare one should "never cast
back on the lines of a mistake." This idea afterward restated,
defended, developed in many discussions, had settled into one
of the stock notions of his brain, became a part of his mental
individuality. And whether it had gone so inconceivably deep as
to affect the dictates of his instinct, or simply because, as
he himself declared, he was "too scared to remember the confounded
pistols," the fact is that General D'Hubert never attempted to
stoop for them. Instead of going back on his mistake, he seized
the rough trunk with both hands and swung himself behind it with
such impetuosity that going right round in the very flash and
report of a pistol shot, he reappeared on the other side of the
tree face to face with General Feraud, who, completely unstrung
by such a show of agility on the part of a dead man, was trembling
yet. A very faint mist of smoke hung before his face which had
an extraordinary aspect as if the lower jaw had come unhinged.</p>

<p>"Not missed!" he croaked hoarsely from the depths of a dry throat.</p>

<p>This sinister sound loosened the spell which had fallen on General
D'Hubert's senses.</p>

<p>"Yes, missed&mdash;a <em>bout portant</em>" he heard himself saying
exultingly almost before he had recovered the full command of
his faculties. The revulsion of feeling was accompanied by a gust
of homicidal fury resuming in its violence the accumulated resentment
of a lifetime. For years General D'Hubert had been exasperated
and humiliated by an atrocious absurdity imposed upon him by that
man's savage caprice. Besides, General D'Hubert had been in this
last instance too unwilling to confront death for the reaction
of his anguish not to take the shape of a desire to kill.</p>

<p>"And I have my two shots to fire yet," he added pitilessly.</p>

<p>General Feraud snapped his teeth, and his face assumed an irate,
undaunted expression.</p>

<p>"Go on," he growled.</p>

<p>These would have been his last words on earth if General D'Hubert
had been holding the pistols in his hand. But the pistols were
lying on the ground at the foot of a tall pine. General D'Hubert
had the second's leisure necessary to remember that he had dreaded
death not as a man but as a lover, not as a danger but as a rival&mdash;not
as a foe to life but as an obstacle to marriage. And, behold,
there was the rival defeated! Miserably defeated-crushed&mdash;done
for!</p>

<p>He picked up the weapons mechanically, and instead of firing
them into General Feraud's breast, gave expression to the thought
uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>"You will fight no more duels now."</p>

<p>[Illustration: frontispiece166.jpg "You will fight no more duels
now."]</p>

<p>His tone of leisurely, ineffable satisfaction was too much for
General Feraud's stoicism.</p>

<p>"Don't dawdle then, damn you for a coldblooded staff-coxcomb!"
he roared out suddenly out of an impassive face held erect on
a rigid body.</p>

<p>General D'Hubert uncocked the pistols carefully. This proceeding
was observed with a sort of gloomy astonishment by the other general.</p>

<p>"You missed me twice," he began coolly, shifting both pistols
to one hand. "The last time within a foot or so. By every rule
of single combat your life belongs to me. That does not mean that
I want to take it now."</p>

<p>"I have no use for your forbearance," muttered General Feraud
savagely.</p>

<p>"Allow me to point out that this is no concern of mine," said
General D'Hubert, whose every word was dictated by a consummate
delicacy of feeling. In anger, he could have killed that man,
but in cold blood, he recoiled from humiliating this unreasonable
being&mdash;a fellow soldier of the Grand Armée, his companion in the
wonders and terrors of the military epic. "You don't set up the
pretension of dictating to me what I am to do with what is my
own."</p>

<p>General Feraud looked startled. And the other continued:</p>

<p>"You've forced me on a point of honour to keep my life at your
disposal, as it were, for fifteen years. Very well. Now that the
matter is decided to my advantage, I am going to do what I like
with your life on the same principle. You shall keep it at my
disposal as long as I choose. Neither more nor less. You are on
your honour."</p>

<p>"I am! But <em>sacrebleu!</em> This is an absurd position for
a general of the empire to be placed in," cried General Feraud,
in the accents of profound and dismayed conviction. "It means
for me to be sitting all the rest of my life with a loaded pistol
in a drawer waiting for your word. It's... it's idiotic. I shall
be an object of... of... derision."</p>

<p>"Absurd?... Idiotic? Do you think so?" queried argumentatively
General D'Hubert with sly gravity. "Perhaps. But I don't see how
that can be helped. However, I am not likely to talk at large
of this adventure. Nobody need ever know anything about it. Just
as no one to this day, I believe, knows the origin of our quarrel....
Not a word more," he added hastily. "I can't really discuss this
question with a man who, as far as I am concerned, does not exist."</p>

<p>When the duellists came out into the open, General Feraud walking
a little behind and rather with the air of walking in a trance,
the two seconds hurried towards them each from his station at
the edge of the wood. General D'Hubert addressed them, speaking
loud and distinctly:</p>

<p>"Messieurs! I make it a point of declaring to you solemnly in
the presence of General Feraud that our difference is at last
settled for good. You may inform all the world of that fact."</p>

<p>"A reconciliation after all!" they exclaimed together.</p>

<p>"Reconciliation? Not that exactly. It is something much more
binding. Is it not so, general?"</p>

<p>General Feraud only lowered his head in sign of assent. The two
veterans looked at each other. Later in the day when they found
themselves alone, out of their moody friend's earshot, the cuirassier
remarked suddenly:</p>

<p>"Generally speaking, I can see with my one eye as far or even
a little farther than most people. But this beats me. He won't
say anything."</p>

<p>"In this affair of honour I understand there has been from first
to last always something that no one in the army could quite make
out," declared the chasseur with the imperfect nose. "In mystery
it began, in mystery it went on, and in mystery it is to end apparently...."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert walked home with long, hasty strides, by no
means uplifted by a sense of triumph. He had conquered, but it
did not seem to him he had gained very much by his conquest. The
night before he had grudged the risk of his life which appeared
to him magnificent, worthy of preservation as an opportunity to
win a girl's love. He had even moments when by a marvellous illusion
this love seemed to him already his and his threatened life a
still more magnificent opportunity of devotion. Now that his life
was safe it had suddenly lost it special magnificence. It wore
instead a specially alarming aspect as a snare for the exposure
of unworthiness. As to the marvellous illusion of conquered love
that had visited him for a moment in the agitated watches of the
night which might have been his last on earth, he comprehended
now its true nature. It had been merely a paroxysm of delirious
conceit. Thus to this man sobered by the victorious issue of a
duel, life appeared robbed of much of its charm simply because
it was no longer menaced.</p>

<p>Approaching the house from the back through the orchard and the
kitchen gardens, he could not notice the agitation which reigned
in front. He never met a single soul. Only upstairs, while walking
softly along the corridor, he became aware that the house was
awake and much more noisy than usual. Names of servants were being
called out down below in a confused noise of coming and going.
He noticed with some concern that the door of his own room stood
ajar, though the shutters had not been opened yet. He had hoped
that his early excursion would have passed unperceived. He expected
to find some servant just gone in; but the sunshine filtering
through the usual cracks enabled him to see lying on the low divan
something bulky which had the appearance of two women clasped
in each other's arms. Tearful and consolatory murmurs issued mysteriously
from that appearance. General D'Hubert pulled open the nearest
pair of shutters violently. One of the women then jumped up. It
was his sister. She stood for a moment with her hair hanging down
and her arms raised straight up above her head, and then flung
herself with a stifled cry into his arms. He returned her embrace,
trying at the same time to disengage himself from it. The other
woman had not risen. She seemed, on the contrary, to cling closer
to the divan, hiding her face in the cushions. Her hair was also
loose; it was admirably fair. General D'Hubert recognised it with
staggering emotion. Mlle. de Valmassigue! Adèle! In distress!</p>

<p>He became greatly alarmed and got rid of his sister's hug definitely.
Madame Léonie then extended her shapely bare arm out of her peignoir,
pointing dramatically at the divan:</p>

<p>"This poor terrified child has rushed here two miles from home
on foot&mdash;running all the way."</p>

<p>"What on earth has happened?" asked General D'Hubert in a low,
agitated voice. But Madame Léonie was speaking loudly.</p>

<p>"She rang the great bell at the gate and roused all the household&mdash;we
were all asleep yet. You may imagine what a terrible shock....
Adèle, my dear child, sit up."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert's expression was not that of a man who imagines
with facility. He did, however, fish out of chaos the notion that
his prospective mother-in-law had died suddenly, but only to dismiss
it at once. He could not conceive the nature of the event, of
the catastrophe which could induce Mlle, de Valmassigue living
in a house full of servants, to bring the news over the fields
herself, two miles, running all the way.</p>

<p>"But why are you in this room?" he whispered, full of awe.</p>

<p>"Of course I ran up to see and this child... I did not notice
it&mdash;she followed me. It's that absurd Chevalier," went on Madame
Léonie, looking towards the divan.... "Her hair's come down. You
may imagine she did not stop to call her maid to dress it before
she started.... Adèle, my dear, sit up.... He blurted it all out
to her at half-past four in the morning. She woke up early, and
opened her shutters, to breathe the fresh air, and saw him sitting
collapsed on a garden bench at the end of the great alley. At
that hour&mdash;you may imagine! And the evening before he had declared
himself indisposed. She just hurried on some clothes and flew
down to him. One would be anxious for less. He loves her, but
not very intelligently. He had been up all night, fully dressed,
the poor old man, perfectly exhausted! He wasn't in a state to
invent a plausible story.... What a confidant you chose there!...
My husband was furious! He said: 'We can't interfere now.' So
we sat down to wait. It was awful. And this poor child running
over here publicly with her hair loose. She has been seen by people
in the fields. She has roused the whole household, too. It's awkward
for her. Luckily you are to be married next week.... Adèle, sit
up. He has come home on his own legs, thank God.... We expected
you to come back on a stretcher perhaps&mdash;what do I know? Go and
see if the carriage is ready. I must take this child to her mother
at once. It isn't proper for her to stay here a minute longer."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert did not move. It was as though he had heard
nothing. Madame Léonie changed her mind.</p>

<p>"I will go and see to it myself," she said. "I want also to get
my cloak... Adèle..." she began, but did not say "sit up." She
went out saying in a loud, cheerful tone: "I leave the door open."</p>

<p>General D'Hubert made a movement towards the divan, but then
Adèle sat up and that checked him dead. He thought, "I haven't
washed this morning. I must look like an old tramp. There's earth
on the back of my coat, and pine needles in my hair." It occurred
to him that the situation required a good deal of circumspection
on his part.</p>

<p>"I am greatly concerned, mademoiselle," he began timidly, and
abandoned that line. She was sitting up on the divan with her
cheeks unusually pink, and her hair brilliantly fair, falling
all over her shoulders&mdash;which was a very novel sight to the general.
He walked away up the room and, looking out of the window for
safety, said: "I fear you must think I behaved like a madman,"
in accents of sincere despair.... Then he spun round and noticed
that she had followed him with her eyes. They were not cast down
on meeting his glance. And the expression of her face was novel
to him also. It was, one might have said, reversed. Her eyes looked
at him with grave thoughtfulness, while the exquisite lines of
her mouth seemed to suggest a restrained smile. This change made
her transcendental beauty much less mysterious, much more accessible
to a man's comprehension. An amazing ease of mind came to the
general&mdash;and even some ease of manner. He walked down the room
with as much pleasurable excitement as he would have found in
walking up to a battery vomiting death, fire, and smoke, then
stood looking down with smiling eyes at the girl whose marriage
with him (next week) had been so carefully arranged by the wise,
the good, the admirable Léonie.</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle," he said in a tone of courtly deference. "If
I could be certain that you did not come here this morning only
from a sense of duty to your mother!"</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, imperturbable but inwardly elated. It
came in a demure murmur, eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect.</p>

<p>"You mustn't be <em>méchant</em> as well as mad."</p>

<p>And then General D'Hubert made an aggressive movement towards
the divan which nothing could check. This piece of furniture was
not exactly in the line of the open door. But Madame Léonie, coming
back wrapped up in a light cloak and carrying a lace shawl on
her arm for Adèle to hide her incriminating hair under, had a
vague impression of her brother getting-up from his knees.</p>

<p>"Come along, my dear child," she cried from the doorway.</p>

<p>The general, now himself again in the fullest sense, showed the
readiness of a resourceful cavalry officer and the peremptoriness
of a leader of men.</p>

<p>"You don't expect her to walk to the carriage," he protested.
"She isn't fit. I will carry her downstairs."</p>

<p>This he did slowly, followed by his awed and respectful sister.
But he rushed back like a whirlwind to wash away all the signs
of the night of anguish and the morning of war, and to put on
the festive garments of a conqueror before hurrying over to the
other house. Had it not been for that, General D'Hubert felt capable
of mounting a horse and pursuing his late adversary in order simply
to embrace him from excess of happiness. "I owe this piece of
luck to that stupid brute," he thought. "This duel has made plain
in one morning what might have taken me years to find out&mdash;for
I am a timid fool. No self-confidence whatever. Perfect coward.
And the Chevalier! Dear old man!" General D'Hubert longed to embrace
him, too.</p>

<p>The Chevalier was in bed. For several days he was much indisposed.
The men of the empire, and the post-revolution young ladies, were
too much for him. He got up the day before the wedding, and being
curious by nature, took his niece aside for a quiet talk. He advised
her to find out from her husband the true story of the affair
of honour, whose claim so imperative and so persistent had led
her to within an ace of tragedy. "It is very proper that his wife
should know. And next month or so will be your time to learn from
him anything you ought to know, my dear child."</p>

<p>Later on when the married couple came on a visit to the mother
of the bride, Madame la Générale D'Hubert made no difficulty in
communicating to her beloved old uncle what she had learned without
any difficulty from her husband. The Chevalier listened with profound
attention to the end, then took a pinch of snuff, shook the grains
of tobacco off the frilled front of his shirt, and said calmly:
"And that's all what it was."</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle," said Madame la Générale, opening her pretty eyes
very wide. "Isn't it funny? <em>C'est insensé</em>&mdash;to think what
men are capable of."</p>

<p>"H'm," commented the old <em>émigré</em>. "It depends what sort
of men. That Bonaparte's soldiers were savages. As a wife, my
dear, it is proper for you to believe implicitly what your husband
says."</p>

<p>But to Léonie's husband the Chevalier confided his true opinion.
"If that's the tale the fellow made up for his wife, and during
the honeymoon, too, you may depend on it no one will ever know
the secret of this affair."</p>

<p>Considerably later still, General D'Hubert judged the time come,
and the opportunity propitious to write a conciliatory letter
to General Feraud. "I have never," protested the General Baron
D'Hubert, "wished for your death during all the time of our deplorable
quarrel. Allow me to give you back in all form your forfeited
life. We two, who have been partners in so much military glory,
should be friendly to each other publicly."</p>

<p>The same letter contained also an item of domestic information.
It was alluding to this last that General Feraud answered from
a little village on the banks of the Garonne:</p>

<p>"If one of your boy's names had been Napoleon, or Joseph, or
even Joachim, I could congratulate you with a better heart. As
you have thought proper to name him Charles Henri Armand I am
confirmed in my conviction that you never loved the emperor. The
thought of that sublime hero chained to a rock in the middle of
a savage ocean makes life of so little value that I would receive
with positive joy your instructions to blow my brains out. From
suicide I consider myself in honour debarred. But I keep a loaded
pistol in my drawer."</p>

<p>Madame la Générale D'Hubert lifted up her hands in horror after
perusing that letter.</p>

<p>"You see? He won't be reconciled," said her husband. "We must
take care that he never, by any chance, learns where the money
he lives on comes from. It would be simply appalling."</p>

<p>"You are a <em>brave homme</em>, Armand," said Madame la Générale
appreciatively.</p>

<p>"My dear, I had the right to blow his brains out&mdash;strictly speaking.
But as I did not we can't let him starve. He has been deprived
of his pension for 'breach of military discipline' when he broke
bounds to fight his last duel with me. He's crippled with rheumatism.
We are bound to take care of him to the end of his days. And,
after all, I am indebted to him for the radiant discovery that
you loved me a little&mdash;you sly person. Ha! Ha! Two miles, running
all the way!... It is extraordinary how all through this affair
that man has managed to engage my deeper feelings."</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
