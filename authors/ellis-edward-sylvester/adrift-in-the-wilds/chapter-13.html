<p>Our friends were prudent enough to cook every available portion
of the mountain sheep, and to preserve what remained for future
contingencies. The climate was so warm that they could not hope
to keep it more than a day or two; and, as it was, they took the
wise course of placing as much of it within their stomachs as
they could conveniently carry. The good-tempered red Newfoundland
seemed to be growing corpulent on this species of living, protracted
hunger alternating with an over supply of food.</p>

<p>They saw no more wild animals during the day, but just as they
were entering the Salinas Valley Elwood discovered something lying
in the path before them which at first he believed to be an Indian,
either asleep or dead; but Terror instantly ran up, and seizing
it in his teeth laid it at his feet, and discovered a beautiful
Indian blanket.</p>

<p>"Strange!" exclaimed the boy, holding it up before him. "This
shows that we are not the first persons who have traversed this
section."</p>

<p>"I wonder that we do not see more savages."</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful?" said Elwood, turning the blanket over and
examining its texture and designs. It was indeed handsome and
very valuable, resembling much the famous blankets made by the
Apache Indians. It was fully a half-inch in thickness, so compactly
knit together as to be water-proof. Its border and the design
of the figures were a miracle of skill in color and combination.
Every hue of the rainbow seemed reproduced in the most pleasing
combinations. The center-piece was a figure of the sun which,
with the rays radiating from it, was of a most intense yellow,
while around the border were pictured all the fruits that any
one has ever heard as being indigenous to California.</p>

<p>"That must be very valuable," said Howard.</p>

<p>"It is so heavy it tires my arms to hold it."</p>

<p>"That same thing would bring yez five hundred dollars, any day,
in San Francisco," added Tim O'Rooney. "It'll pay yez to carry
it there."</p>

<p>"It is just the thing to wrap around us when we lie down to sleep."</p>

<p>"Yis, if ye wraps up in that yez'll wake up and find yersilves
roasted to dith. Yez might as well crawl into an oven and bake
yersilves and be done with it."</p>

<p>"We can then spread it on the ground, and protect ourselves from
the moisture!" said Howard, who was beginning to appreciate the
value of the article.</p>

<p>"I've saan them things before," added Tim O'Rooney. "The Apaches
and Mohaws in New Mexico make 'em. It has tuk a couple of squaws
the bist part of a year to do the same."</p>

<p>"But where is the owner? An Indian could not lose such a thing
without knowing it. Why, it is a load to carry, and I should expect
to lose my coat as soon as to part with this."</p>

<p>Of course there could be no explanation of the cause of the blanket
being found where it was. It was plain that no Indian could have
parted with it unknowingly, and its high value made it still more
puzzling that it should have been left in such a place. It might
be that the owner&mdash;some fragile Indian girl&mdash;had wearied with
carrying it, and had thrown it down for a warrior friend of hers
to pick up and take to its destination for her.</p>

<p>This conjecture, made by Tim O'Rooney himself, raised a serious
question as to whether they had a right to carry the blanket away
when there was good reason to doubt its being lost or abandoned.</p>

<p>"If a year's work has been lavished upon it," said Elwood, "it
cannot be possible that it has no owner."</p>

<p>"I think Tim is right; he or she expects to return or send and
get it."</p>

<p>"But it is singular that if such is the case it should be left
here, when it could have been easily hid in these bushes."</p>

<p>"That only proves that there are no people about&mdash;no white ones
at least. If the owner had any fear of this place being visited
by <em>Christians</em>, he would have taken pains to hide his
property; but as he was sure there were none but savages and heathen,
he was certain his blanket was safe."</p>

<p>Howard Lawrence, jesting though he was, spoke the truth, and
deeply ashamed are we to confess it.</p>

<p>The question received an unexpected and unmistakable solution.
While they were still conversing, they descried a gaudily dressed,
rather handsome-looking squaw tripping lightly behind them. Her
head was bent, and she did not discover them until the growl of
the dog caused her to raise her head. She was then within a dozen
yards of Howard, he being in the rear and holding the blanket
in his hand. She looked at them with an alarmed expression in
her strange dark eyes, and seemed to be too much frightened to
think of fleeing.</p>

<p>Howard signified his friendship by walking quietly toward her
and holding out the blanket as if inviting her to take it. She
readily comprehended the meaning of his advance, and when the
article was within reach she took it.</p>

<p>"Now make a bargain if you can," called out Elwood.</p>

<p>Howard produced the gold watch&mdash;a small hunting-case&mdash;and offered
it to the young woman. She examined it with childish curiosity,
but in a manner that showed that it was not the first time she
had looked upon such an article. She held it a for moments, and
then with a pleased smile passed the blanket to him, bowed gracefully,
wheeled quickly, and slipped away charmingly.</p>

<p>"Hurra!" fairly shouted Elwood, "you are as good as Tim at making
a bargain."</p>

<p>"She must live somewhere about here, and no doubt will tell how
she got the watch, and that may set some of her friends on our
track."</p>

<p>"Let 'em come," said Tim. "I've a gun that I larned how to shoot,
and that blanket we can wrap around us, and I don't believe you
could shoot a bullet through it by raison of its thickness."</p>

<p>The party resumed their journey, quite jubilant over the rifle
and blanket. They still needed but one thing, or rather two things,
guns for the boys. Terror was such a sharp and faithful sentinel
they would have felt almost safe with these additional fire-arms.
Howard and Elwood were quite confident that they could shoot with
remarkable precision, although, neither had ever aimed or discharged
a gun; but in this respect they were not so very different from
other boys.</p>

<p>At noon they made a hearty meal upon a portion of what still
remained of the mountain sheep, and then stretched themselves
out for an hour's rest. Tim O'Rooney was plentifully supplied
with tobacco, and perhaps could not have felt more comfortable
or satisfied with his situation. He lolled on the grass, and wondered
whether Mr. Lawrence was anxious for him to get home or not, finally
reaching the conclusion that he was rather indifferent upon the
subject himself. The greatest distress of Howard and Elwood was
the pain that their parents would feel regarding them; but they
hoped to reach home without great delay, when they would quickly
turn their weeping into joy.</p>

<p>The two could not grow weary of admiring their beautiful blanket.
It was a wonderful affair indeed, and doubtless contained within
it enough material to supply a "shoddy" contractor with the basis
for a thousand army blankets. The boys would have willingly given
both their watches for it and considered themselves greatly the
gainers. They looked upon it as their joint property.</p>

<p>"I do believe it is rifle-proof," said Howard. "The fine threads
of which it is composed are woven so compactly that you can hardly
distinguish them."</p>

<p>"I should be rather fearful of risking a rifle-shot from any
one if that were all that protected me."</p>

<p>"We can easily test it. Let's hung it up and shoot a bullet at
it."</p>

<p>"No, that would be too bad. The ball might go through, and then
it would be spoiled in its looks. Now it seems really perfect&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I say, me boys&#11834;"</p>

<p>Tim's utterance was checked by the discharge of a rifle and the
near whistle of the bullet. He started up and glanced around him.</p>

<p>"Injuns, or me name isn't Tim O'Rooney, from Tipperary, Ireland,
the gem of the say!"</p>
