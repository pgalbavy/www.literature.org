<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Spring came unusually early that year. By the first of the month
a few willows and thorn bushes in the Park had turned green; then,
in a single day, the entire Park became lovely with golden bell-flowers,
and the first mowing machine clinked over the greenswards leaving
a fragrance of clipped verdure in its wake.</p>

<p>Under a characteristic blue sky April unfolded its myriad leaves
beneath which robins ran over shaven lawns and purple grackle
bustled busily about, and the water fowl quacked and whistled
and rushed through the water nipping and chasing one another or,
sidling alongside, began that nodding, bowing, bobbing acquaintance
preliminary to aquatic courtship.</p>

<p>Many of the wild birds had mated; many were mating; amorous caterwauling
on back fences made night an inferno; pigeons cooed and bubbled
and made endless nuisances of themselves all day long.</p>

<p>In lofts, offices, and shops youthful faces, whitened by the
winter's pallour, appeared at open windows gazing into the blue
above, or, with, pretty, inscrutable eyes, studied the passing
throng till the lifted eyes of youth below completed the occult
circuit with a smile.</p>

<p>And the spring sunshine grew hot, and sprinkling carts appeared,
and the metropolis moulted its overcoats, and the derby became
a burden, and the annual spring exhibition of the National Academy
of Design remained uncrowded.</p>

<p>Neville, lunching at the Syrinx Club, carelessly caught the ball
of conversation tossed toward him and contributed his final comment:</p>

<p>"Burleson&mdash;and you, Sam Ogilvy&mdash;and you, Annan, all say that
the exhibition is rotten. You say so every year; so does the majority
of people. And the majority will continue saying the same thing
throughout the coming decades as long as there are any exhibitions
to damn.</p>

<p>"It is the same thing in other countries. For a hundred years
the majority has pronounced every Salon rotten. And it will so
continue.</p>

<p>"But the facts are these: the average does not vary much. A mediocrity,
not disagreeable, always rules; supremity has been, is, and always
will be the stick in the riffle around which the little whirlpool
will always centre. This year it happens to be José Querida who
stems the sparkling mediocrity and sticks up from the bottom gravel
making a fine little swirl. Next year&mdash;or next decade it may be
anybody&mdash;you, Annan, or Sam&mdash;perhaps," he added with a slight
smile, "it might be I. <em>Quand même</em>. The exhibitions are
no rottener than they have ever been; and it's up to us to go
about our business. And I'm going. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He rose from the table, laid aside the remains of his cigar,
nodded good-humouredly to the others, and went out with that quick,
graceful, elastic step which was noticed by everybody and envied
by many.</p>

<p>"Hell," observed John Burleson, hitching his broad shoulders
forward and swallowing a goblet of claret at a single gulp, "it's
all right for Kelly Neville to shed sweetness and light over a
rotten exhibition where half the people are crowded around his
own picture."</p>

<p>"What a success he's having," mused Ogilvy, looking sideways
out of the window at a pretty girl across the street.</p>

<p>Annan nodded: "He works hard enough for it."</p>

<p>"He works all the time," grumbled Burleson, "but, does he work
<em>hard</em>?"</p>

<p>"A cat scrambling in a molasses barrel works hard," observed
Ogilvy&mdash;"if you see any merit in that, John."</p>

<p>Burleson reared his huge frame and his symmetrical features became
more bovine than ever:</p>

<p>"What the devil has a cat in a molasses barrel to do with the
subject?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Annan laughed: "Poor old honest, literal John," he said, lazily.
"Listen; from my back window in the country, yesterday, I observed
one of my hens scratching her ear with her foot. How would you
like to be able to accomplish that, John?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like it at all!" roared Burleson in serious disapproval.</p>

<p>"That's because you're a sculptor and a Unitarian," said Annan,
gravely.</p>

<p>"My God!" shouted Burleson, "what's that got to do with a hen
scratching herself!"</p>

<p>Ogilvy was too weak with laughter to continue the favourite pastime
of "touching up John"; and Burleson who, under provocation, never
exhibited any emotion except impatient wonder at the foolishness
of others, emptied his claret bottle with unruffled confidence
in his own common-sense and the futility of his friends.</p>

<p>"Kelly, they say, is making a stunning lot of stuff for that
Byzantine Theatre," he said in his honest, resonant voice. "I
wish to Heaven I could paint like him."</p>

<p>Annan passed his delicate hand over his pale, handsome face:
"Kelly Neville is, without exception, the most gifted man I ever
knew."</p>

<p>"No, the most skilful," suggested Ogilvy. "I have known more
gifted men who never became skilful."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'What's the matter with it, then?'"]</p>

<p>"What hair is that you're splitting, Sam?" demanded Burleson.
"Don't you like Kelly's work?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it, then?"</p>

<p>There was a silence. One or two men at neighbouring tables turned
partly around to listen. There seemed to be something in the very
simple and honest question of John Burleson that arrested the
attention of every man at the Syrinx Club who had heard it. Because,
for the first time, the question which every man there had silently,
involuntarily asked himself had been uttered aloud at last by
John Burleson&mdash;voiced in utter good faith and with all confidence
that the answer could be only that there was nothing whatever
the matter with Louis Neville's work. And his answer had been
a universal silence.</p>

<p>Clive Gail, lately admitted to the Academy said: "I have never
in my life seen or believed possible such facility as is Louis
Neville's."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," grunted Burleson.</p>

<p>"His personal manner of doing his work&mdash;which the critics and
public term 'tek&mdash;nee&mdash;ee&mdash;eek,'" laughed Annan, "is simply gloriously
bewildering. There is a sweeping splendour to it&mdash;and <em>what</em>
colour!"</p>

<p>There ensued murmured and emphatic approbation; and another silence.</p>

<p>Ogilvy's dark, pleasant face was troubled when he broke the quiet,
and everybody turned toward him:</p>

<p>"Then," he said, slowly, "what <em>is</em> the matter with Neville?"</p>

<p>Somebody said: "He <em>does</em> convince you; it isn't that,
is it?"</p>

<p>A voice replied: "Does he convince himself?"</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;there always has been something lacking in all that
big, glorious, splendid work. It only needs that one thing&mdash;whatever
it is," said Ogilvy, quietly. "Kelly is too sure, too powerfully
perfect, too omniscient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we mortals can't stand that," commented Annan, laughing.
"'Raus mit Neville!' He paints joy and sorrow as though he'd never
known either&mdash;"</p>

<p>And his voice checked itself of its own instinct in the startled
silence.</p>

<p>"That man, Neville, has never known the pain of work," said Gail,
deliberately. "When he has passed through it and it has made his
hand less steady, less omnipotent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's right. We can't love a man who has never endured what
we have," said another. "No genius can hide his own immunity.
That man paints with an unscarred soul. A little hell for his&mdash;and
no living painter could stand beside him."</p>

<p>"Piffle," observed John Burleson.</p>

<p>Ogilvy said: "It is true, I think, that out of human suffering
a quality is distilled which affects everything one does. Those
who have known sorrow can best depict it&mdash;not perhaps most plausibly,
but most convincingly&mdash;and with fewer accessories, more reticence,
and&mdash;better taste."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to paint tragedies?" demanded Burleson.</p>

<p>"One need not paint them, John, but one needs to understand them
to paint anything else&mdash;needs to have lived them, perhaps, to
become a master of pictured happiness, physical or spiritual."</p>

<p>"That's piffle, too!" said Burleson in his rumbling bass&mdash;"like
that damn hen you lugged in&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout of laughter relieved everybody.</p>

<p>"Do you want a fellow to go and poke his head into trouble and
get himself mixed up in a tragedy so that he can paint better?"
insisted Burleson, scornfully.</p>

<p>"There's usually no necessity to hunt trouble," said Annan.</p>

<p>"But you say that Kelly never had any and that he'd paint better
if he had."</p>

<p>"Trouble <em>might</em> be the making of Kelly Neville," mused
Ogilvy, "and it might not. It depends, John, not on the amount
and quality of the hell, but on the man who's frying on the gridiron."</p>

<p>Annan said: "Personally I don't see how Kelly <em>could</em>
paint happiness or sorrow or wonder or fear into any of his creations
any more convincingly than he does. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;sometimes
we love men for their shortcomings&mdash;for the sincerity of their
blunders&mdash;for the fallible humanity in them. That after all is
where love starts. The rest&mdash;what Kelly shows us&mdash;evokes wonder,
delight, awe, enthusiasm.... If he could only make us love him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> love him!" said Burleson.</p>

<p>"We all are inclined to&mdash;if we could get near enough to him,"
said Annan with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Him&mdash;or his work?"</p>

<p>"Both, John. There's a vast amount of nonsense talked about the
necessity of separation between a man and his work&mdash;that the public
has no business with the creator, only with his creations. It
is partly true. Still, no man ever created anything in which he
did not include a sample of himself&mdash;if not what he himself is,
at least what he would like to be and what he likes and dislikes
in others. No creator who shows his work can hope to remain entirely
anonymous. And &mdash;I am not yet certain that the public has
no right to make its comments on the man who did the work as well
as on the work which it is asked to judge."</p>

<p>"The man is nothing; the work everything," quoted Burleson, heavily.</p>

<p>"So I've heard," observed Annan, blandly. "It's rather a precious
thought, isn't it, John?"</p>

<p>"Do you consider that statement to be pure piffle?"</p>

<p>"Partly, dear friend. But I'm one of those nobodies who cherish
a degenerate belief that man comes first, and then his works,
and that the main idea is to get through life as happily as possible
with the minimum of inconvenience to others. Human happiness is
what I venture to consider more important than the gim-cracks
created by those same humans. Man first, then man's work, that's
the order of mundane importance to me. And if you've got to criticise
the work, for God's sake do it with your hand on the man's shoulder."</p>

<p>"Our little socialist," said Ogilvy, patting Annan's blonde head.
"He wants to love everybody and everybody to love him, especially
when they're ornamental and feminine. Yes? No?" he asked, fondly
coddling Annan, who submitted with a bored air and tried to kick
his shins.</p>

<p>Later, standing in a chance group on the sidewalk before scattering
to their several occupations, Burleson said:</p>

<p>"That's a winner of a model&mdash;that Miss West. I used her for the
fountain I'm doing for Cardemon's sunken garden. I never saw a
model put together as she is. And that's going some."</p>

<p>"She's a dream," said Ogilvy&mdash;"<em>un pen sauvage</em>&mdash;no inclination
to socialism there, Annan. I know because I was considering the
advisability of bestowing upon her one of those innocent, inadvertent,
and fascinatingly chaste salutes&mdash;just to break the formality.
She wouldn't have it. I'd taken her to the theatre, too. Girls
are astonishing problems."</p>

<p>"You're a joyous beast, aren't you, Sam?" observed Burleson.</p>

<p>"I may be a trifle joyous. I tried to explain that to her, but
she wouldn't listen. Heaven knows my intentions are child-like.
I liked her because she's the sort of girl you can take anywhere
and not queer yourself if you collide with your fiancée&mdash;visiting
relative from 'Frisco, you know. She's equipped to impersonate
anything from the younger set to the prune and pickle class."</p>

<p>"She certainly is a looker," nodded Annan.</p>

<p>"She can deliver the cultivated goods, too, and make a perfectly
good play at the unsophisticated intellectual," said Ogilvy with
conviction. "And it's a rare combination to find a dream that
looks as real at the Opera as it does in a lobster palace. But
she's no socialist, Harry&mdash;she'll ride in a taxi with you and
sit up half the night with you, but it's nix for getting closer,
and the frozen Fownes for the chaste embrace&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"She's a curious kind of girl," mused Burleson;&mdash;"seems perfectly
willing to go about with you;&mdash;enjoys it like one of those bread-and-butter
objects that the department shops call a 'Miss.'"</p>

<p>Annan said: "The girl is unusual, everyway. You don't know where
to place her. She's a girl without a caste. I like her. I made
some studies from her; Kelly let me."</p>

<p>"Does Kelly own her?" asked Burleson, puffing out his chest.</p>

<p>"He discovered her. He has first call."</p>

<p>Allaire, who had come up, caught the drift of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," he said, in his loud, careless voice, "anybody can
take Valerie West to supper. The town's full of her kind."</p>

<p>"Have you taken her anywhere?" asked Annan, casually.</p>

<p>Allaire flushed up: "I haven't had time." He added something
which changed the fixed smile on his symmetrical, highly coloured
face into an expression not entirely agreeable.</p>

<p>"The girl's all right," said Burleson, reddening. "She's damn
decent to everybody. What are you talking about, Allaire? Kelly
will put a head on you!"</p>

<p>Allaire, careless and assertive, shrugged away the rebuke with
a laugh:</p>

<p>"Neville is one of those professional virgins we read about in
our neatly manicured fiction. He's what is known as the original
mark. Jezebel and Potiphar's wife in combination with Salome and
the daughters of Lot couldn't disturb his confidence in them or
in himself. And&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;he paints that way, too." And
he went away laughing and swinging his athletic shoulders and
twirling his cane, his hat not mathematically straight on his
handsome, curly head.</p>

<p>"There strides a joyous bounder," observed Ogilvy.</p>

<p>"Curious," mused Annan. "His family is oldest New York. You see
'em that way, at times."</p>

<p>Burleson, who came from New England, grunted his scorn for Manhattan,
ancient or recent, and, nodding a brusque adieu, walked away with
ponderous and powerful strides. And the others followed, presently,
each in pursuit of his own vocation, Annan and Ogilvy remaining
together as their common destination was the big new studio building
which they as well as Neville inhabited.</p>

<p>Passing Neville's door they saw it still ajar, and heard laughter
and a piano and gay voices.</p>

<p>"Hi!" exclaimed Ogilvy, softly, "let's assist at the festivities.
Probably we're not wanted, but does that matter, Harry?"</p>

<p>"It merely adds piquancy to our indiscretion," said Annan, gravely,
following him in unannounced&mdash;"Oh, hello, Miss West! Was that
you playing? Hello, Rita"&mdash;greeting a handsome blonde young girl
who stretched out a gloved hand to them both and nodded amiably.
Then she glanced upward where, perched on his ladder, big palette
curving over his left elbow, Neville stood undisturbed by the
noise below, outlining great masses of clouds on a canvas where
a celestial company, sketched in from models, soared, floated,
or hung suspended, cradled in mid air with a vast confusion of
wide wings spreading, fluttering, hovering, beating the vast ethereal
void, all in pursuit of a single exquisite shape darting up into
space.</p>

<p>"What's all that, Kelly? Leda chased by swans?" asked Ogilvy,
with all the disrespect of cordial appreciation.</p>

<p>"It's the classic game of follow my Leda," observed Annan.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" exclaimed Valerie West, laughing; "such a wretched
witticism, Mr. Annan!"</p>

<p>"Your composition is one magnificent vista of legs, Kelly," insisted
Ogilvy. "Put pants on those swans."</p>

<p>Neville merely turned and threw an empty paint tube at him, and
continued his cloud outlining with undisturbed composure.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Rita?" asked Ogilvy, dropping into a chair.
"Nobody sees you any more."</p>

<p>"That's because nobody went to the show, and that's why they
took it off," said Rita Tevis, resentfully. "I had a perfectly
good part which nobody crabbed because nobody wanted it, which
suited me beautifully because I hate to have anything that others
want. Now there's nothing doing in the millinery line and I'm
ready for suggestions."</p>

<p>"Dinner with me," said Ogilvy, fondly. But she turned up her
dainty nose:</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> anything more interesting to offer, Mr. Annan?"</p>

<p>"Only my heart, hand, and Ogilvy's fortune," said Annan, regretfully.
"But I believe Archie Allaire was looking for a model of your
type&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to pose for Mr. Allaire," said the girl, pouting
and twirling the handle of her parasol.</p>

<p>But neither Annan nor Ogilvy could use her then; and Neville
had just finished a solid week of her.</p>

<p>"What I'll do," she said with decision, "will be to telephone
John Burleson. I never knew him to fail a girl in search of an
engagement."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a dear," said Valerie, smiling. "I adore him."</p>

<p>She sat at the piano, running her fingers lightly over the keyboard,
listening to what was being said, watching with happy interest
everything that was going on around her, and casting an occasional
glance over her shoulder and upward to where Neville stood at
work.</p>

<p>"John Burleson," observed Rita, looking fixedly at Ogilvy, "is
easily the nicest man I know."</p>

<p>"Help!" said Ogilvy, feebly.</p>

<p>Valerie glanced across the top of the piano, laughing, while
her hands passed idly here and there over the keys:</p>

<p>"Sam <em>can</em> be very nice, Rita; but you've got to make
him," she said.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know a really interesting man who didn't require
watching?" inquired Annan, mildly.</p>

<p>Rita surveyed him with disdain: "Plenty."</p>

<p>"Don't believe it. No girl has any very enthusiastic use for
a man in whom she has perfect confidence."</p>

<p>"Here's another profound observation," added Ogilvy; "when a
woman loses confidence in a man she finds a brand-new interest
in him. But when a man once really loses confidence in a woman,
he never regains it, and it's the beginning of the end. What do
you think about that, Miss West?"</p>

<p>Valerie, still smiling, struck a light chord or two, considering:</p>

<p>"I don't know how it would be," she said, "to lose confidence
in a man you really care much about. I should think it would break
a girl's heart."</p>

<p>"It doesn't," said Rita, with supreme contempt. "You become accustomed
to it."</p>

<p>Valerie leaned forward against the keyboard, laughing:</p>

<p>"Oh, Rita!" she said, "what a confession!"</p>

<p>"You silly child," retorted Rita, "I'm twenty-two. Do you think
I have the audacity to pretend I've never been in love?"</p>

<p>Ogilvy said with a grin: "How about you, Miss West?"&mdash;hoping
to embarrass her; but she only smiled gaily and continued to play
a light accompaniment to the fugitive air that was running through
her head.</p>

<p>"Don't be selfish with your experiences," urged Ogilvy. "Come
on, Miss West! 'Raus mit 'em!'"</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to say, Sam?"</p>

<p>"That you've been in love several times."</p>

<p>"But I haven't."</p>

<p>"Not once?"</p>

<p>Her lowered face was still smiling, as her pliant fingers drifted
into Grieg's "Spring Song."</p>

<p>"Not one pretty amourette to cheer those twenty-one years of
yours?" insisted Ogilvy.</p>

<p>But his only answer was her lowered head and the faint smile
edging her lips, and the "Spring Song," low, clear, exquisitely
persistent in the hush.</p>

<p>When the last note died out in the stillness Rita emphasised
the finish with the ferrule of her parasol and rose with decision:</p>

<p>"I require several new frocks," she said, "and how am I to acquire
them unless I pose for somebody? Good-bye, Mr. Neville&mdash;bye-bye!
Sam&mdash;good-bye, Mr. Annan&mdash;good-bye, dear,"&mdash;to Valerie&mdash;"if you've
nothing better on hand drop in this evening. I've a duck of a
new hat."</p>

<p>The girl nodded, and, as Rita Tevis walked out, turning up her
nose at Ogilvy who opened the door for her, Valerie glanced up
over her shoulder at Neville:</p>

<p>"I don't believe you are going to need me to-day after all, are
you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," he said, absently. "I've a lot of things to do. You needn't
stay, Miss West."</p>

<p>"Now will you be good!" said Annan, smiling at her with his humourous,
bantering air. And to his surprise and discomfiture he saw the
least trace of annoyance in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"Come up to the studio and have a julep," he said with hasty
cordiality. "And suppose we dine together at Arrowhead&mdash;if you've
nothing else on hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head&mdash;the movement was scarcely perceptible. The
smile had returned to her lips.</p>

<p>"Won't you, Miss West?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it like you to ask me when you heard Rita's invitation?
You're a fraud, Mr. Annan."</p>

<p>"Are you going to sit in that boarding-house parlour and examine
Rita's new bonnet all this glorious evening?"</p>

<p>She laughed: "Is there any man on earth who can prophesy what
any woman on earth is likely to do? If <em>you</em> can, please
begin."</p>

<p>Ogilvy, hands clasped behind him, balancing alternately on heels
and toes, stood regarding Neville's work. Annan looked up, too,
watching Neville where he stood on the scaffolding, busy as always,
with the only recreation he cared anything for&mdash;work.</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven I were infected with the bacillus of industry,"
broke out Ogilvy. "I never come into this place but I see Kelly
busily doing something."</p>

<p>"You're an inhuman sort of brute, Kelly!" added Annan. "What
do you work that way for&mdash;money? If I had my way I'd spend three
quarters of my time shooting and fishing and one quarter painting&mdash;and
I'm as devotedly stuck on art as any healthy man ought to be."</p>

<p>"Art's a bum mistress if she makes you hustle like that!" commented
Ogilvy. "Shake her, Kelly. She's a wampire mit a sarpint's tongue!"</p>

<p>"The worst of Kelly is that he'd <em>rather</em> paint," said
Annan, hopelessly. "It's sufficient to sicken the proverbial cat."</p>

<p>"Get a machine and take us all out to Woodmanston?" suggested
Ogilvy. "It's a bee&mdash;u&mdash;tiful day, dearie!"</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" retorted Neville, painting composedly.</p>

<p>"Your industry saddens us," insisted Annan. "It's only in mediocrity
that you encounter industry. Genius frivols; talent takes numerous
vacations on itself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And at its own expense," added Valerie, demurely. "I knew a
man who couldn't finish his 'Spring Academy' in time: and he had
all winter to finish it. But he didn't. Did you ever hear about
that man, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Me," said Ogilvy, bowing with hand on heart. "And with that
cruel jab from <em>you</em>&mdash;false fair one &mdash;I'll continue
heavenward in the elevator. Come on, Harry."</p>

<p>Annan took an elaborate farewell of Valerie which she met in
the same mock-serious manner; then she waved a gay and dainty
adieu to Ogilvy, and reseated herself after their departure. But
this time she settled down into a great armchair facing Neville
and his canvas, and lay back extending her arms and resting the
back of her head on the cushions.</p>

<p>Whether or not Neville was conscious of her presence below she
could not determine, so preoccupied did he appear to be with the
work in hand. She lay there in the pleasant, mellow light of the
great windows, watching him, at first intently, then, soothed
by the soft spring wind that fitfully stirred the hair at her
temples, she relaxed her attention, idly contented, happy without
any particular reason.</p>

<p>Now and then a pigeon flashed by the windows, sheering away high
above the sunlit city. Once, wind-caught, or wandering into unaccustomed
heights, high in the blue a white butterfly glimmered, still mounting
to infinite altitudes, fluttering, breeze-blown, a silvery speck
adrift.</p>

<p>"Like a poor soul aspiring," she thought listlessly, watching
with dark eyes over which the lids dropped lazily at moments,
only to lift again as her gaze reverted to the man above.</p>

<p>She thought about him, too; she usually did&mdash;about his niceness
to her, his never-to-be-forgotten kindness; her own gratitude
to him for her never-to-be-forgotten initiation.</p>

<p>It seemed scarcely possible that two months had passed since
her novitiate&mdash;that two months ago she still knew nothing of the
people, the friendships, the interest, the surcease from loneliness
and hopeless apathy, that these new conditions had brought to
her.</p>

<p>Had she known Louis Neville only two months? Did all this new
buoyancy date from two short months' experience&mdash;this quickened
interest in life, this happy development of intelligence so long
starved, this unfolding of youth in the atmosphere of youth? She
found it difficult to realise, lying there so contentedly, so
happily, following, with an interest and appreciation always developing,
the progress of the work.</p>

<p>Already, to herself, she could interpret much that she saw in
this new world. Cant phrases, bits of studio lore, artists' patter,
their ways of looking at things, their manners of expression,
their mannerisms, their little vanities, their ideas, ideals,
aspirations, were fast becoming familiar to her. Also she was
beginning to notice and secretly to reflect on their generic characteristics&mdash;their
profoundly serious convictions concerning themselves and their
art modified by surface individualities; their composite lack
of humour&mdash;exceptions like Ogilvy and Annan, and even Neville
only proving the rule; their simplicity, running the entire gamut
from candour to stupidity; their patience which was half courage,
half a capacity for suffering; and, in the latter, more woman-like
than like a man.</p>

<p>Simplicity, courage, lack of humour&mdash;those appeared to be the
fundamentals characterising the ensemble&mdash;supplemented by the
extremes of restless intelligence and grim conservatism.</p>

<p>And the whole fabric seemed to be founded not on industry but
on impulse born of sentiment. In this new, busy, inspiring, delightful
world logic became a synthesis erected upon some inceptive absurdity,
carried solemnly to a picturesque and erroneous conclusion.</p>

<p>She had been aware, in stage folk, of the tendency to sentimental
impulse; and she again discovered it in this new world, in a form
slightly modified by the higher average of reasoning power. In
both professions the heart played the dominant part in creator
and creation. The exceptions to the rule were the few in either
profession who might be called distinguished.</p>

<p>Neville had once said to her: "Nothing that amounts to anything
in art is ever done accidentally or merely because the person
who creates it loves to do it."</p>

<p>She was thinking of this, now, as she lay there watching him.</p>

<p>He had added: "Enthusiasm is excellent while you're dressing
for breakfast; but good pictures are painted in cold blood. Go
out into the back yard and yell your appreciation of the universe
if you want to; but the studio is a silent place; and a blank
canvas a mathematical proposition."</p>

<p>Could this be true? Was all the beauty, all the joyous charm,
all the splendour of shape and colour the result of working out
a mathematical proposition? Was this exquisite surety of touch
and handling, of mass and line composition, all these lovely depths
and vast ethereal spaces superbly peopled, merely the logical
result of solving that problem? Was it all clear, limpid, steady,
nerveless intelligence; and was nothing due to the chance and
hazard of inspiration?</p>

<p>Gladys, the cat, walked in, gently flourishing her tail, hesitated,
looked around with narrowing green-jewelled eyes, and, ignoring
the whispered invitation and the outstretched hand, leaped lightly
to a chair and settled down on a silken cushion, paws and tail
folded under her jet-black body.</p>

<p>Valerie reproached her in a whisper, reminding her of past caresses
and attentions, but the cat only blinked at her pleasantly.</p>

<p>On a low revolving stand at Valerie's elbow lay a large lump
of green modelling wax. This wax Neville sometimes used to fashion,
with his facile hands, little figures sketched from his models.
These he arranged in groups as though to verify the composition
on the canvas before him, and this work and the pliant material
which he employed had for her a particular and never-flagging
interest. And now, without thinking, purely instinctively, she
leaned forward and laid her hand caressingly on the lump of wax.
There was something about the yielding, velvety texture that fascinated
her, as though in her slim fingers some delicate nerves were responding
to the pleasure of contact.</p>

<p>For a while she moulded little cubes and pyramids, pinched out
bread-crumb chickens and pigs and cats.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> do you think of this little wax kitten, Gladys?"
she whispered, holding it up for the cat's inspection. Gladys
regarded it without interest and resumed her pleasant contemplation
of space.</p>

<p>Valerie, elbows on knees, seated at the revolving stool with
all the naïve absorption of a child constructing mud pies, began
to make out of the fascinating green wax an image of Gladys dozing.</p>

<p>Time fled away in the studio; intent, absorbed, she pinched little
morsels of wax from the lump and pushed them into place with a
snowy, pink-tipped thumb, or with the delicate nail of her forefinger
removed superfluous material.</p>

<p>Stepping noiselessly so not to disturb Neville she made frequent
journeys around to the other side of the cat, sometimes passing
sensitive fingers over silky feline contours, which, research
inspired a loud purring.</p>

<p>As she worked sometimes she talked under her breath to herself,
to Gladys, to Neville:</p>

<p>"I am making a perfectly good cat, Valerie," she whispered. "Gladys,
aren't you a little bit flattered? I suppose you think it's honour
enough to belong to that man up there on the scaffolding. I imagine
it is; he is a very wonderful man, Gladys, very high above us
in intellect as he is in body. He doesn't pay very much attention
to you and me down here on the floor; he's just satisfied to own
us and be amiable to us when he thinks about us.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that in any critical or reproachful sense, Gladys.
Don't you dare think I do&mdash;not for one moment! Do you hear me?
Well then! If you are stupid enough to misunderstand me I'll put
a perfectly horrid pair of ears on you!... I've made a very dainty
pair of ears for you, dear; I only said that to frighten you.
You and I like that man up there&mdash;tremendously, don't we? And
we're very grateful to him for&mdash;for a great many happy moments&mdash;and
for his unfailing kindness and consideration.... You don't mind
posing for me; <em>you</em> wear fur. But I didn't wear anything,
dear, when I first sat to him as a novice; and, kitty, I was a
fortunate girl in my choice of the man before whom I was to make
a début. And I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rattle of brushes and the creak of the scaffolding arrested
her: Neville was coming down for a view of his work.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said, pleasantly, noticing for the first time that
she was still in the studio.</p>

<p>"Have I disturbed you, Mr. Neville?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. You never do any more than does Gladys." He glanced
absently at the cat, then, facing his canvas, backed away from
it, palette in hand.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he examined his work, shifting his position from
minute to minute, until the change of positions brought him backed
up beside Valerie, and his thigh brushing her arm made him aware
of her. Glancing down with smiling apology his eye fell on the
wax, and was arrested. Then he bent over the work she had done,
examining it, twirled the top of the stool, and inspected it carefully
from every side.</p>

<p>"Have you ever studied modelling, Miss West?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, blushing, "you must know that I haven't." And
looked up expecting to see laughter in his eyes; and saw only
the curiosity of interest.</p>

<p>"How did you know how to start this?"</p>

<p>"I have often watched you."</p>

<p>"Is that all the instruction you've ever had in modelling?"</p>

<p>She could not quite bring herself to believe in his pleasant
seriousness:</p>

<p>"Y-yes," she admitted, "except when I have watched John Burleson.
But&mdash;this is simply rotten&mdash;childish&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said in a matter of fact tone, "it's interesting."</p>

<p>"Do you really think&mdash;mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked down at her, considering her while the smile that she
knew and liked best and thought best suited to his face, began
to glimmer; that amused, boyish, bantering smile hinting of experience
and wisdom delightfully beyond her.</p>

<p>"I really think that you're a very unusual girl," he said. "I
don't want to spoil you by telling you so every minute."</p>

<p>"You don't spoil me by telling me so. Sometimes I think you may
spoil me by not telling me so."</p>

<p>"Miss West! You're spoiled already! I'm throwing bouquets at
you every minute! You're about the only girl who ever sat for
me with whom I talk unreservedly and incessantly."</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Neville?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;really, Mr. Neville," he repeated, laughing&mdash;"you bad,
spoiled little beauty! You know devilish well that if there's
any intellectual space between you and me it's purely a matter
of circumstance and opportunity."</p>

<p>"Do you think me silly enough to believe that!"</p>

<p>"I think you clever enough to know it without my telling you."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't say that."</p>

<p>She was still smiling but in the depths of her eyes he felt that
the smile was not genuine.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "I don't want you to think that I don't
mean what I say. I do. You're as intelligent a woman as I ever
knew. I've known girls more cultivated in general and in particular,
but, I say again, that is the hazard of circumstance. Is all clear
between us now, Miss West?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He held out his hand; she glanced up, smiled, and laid her own
in it. And they shook hands heartily.</p>

<p>"Good business," he said with satisfaction. "Don't ever let anything
threaten our very charming accord. The moment you don't approve
of anything I say or do come straight to me and complain&mdash;and
don't let me divine it in your eyes, Miss West."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I did. Your lips were smiling but in your eyes was
something that did not corroborate your lips."</p>

<p>"Yes.... But how could you see it?"</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "it's part of my business to notice such
things." He seated himself on the arm of her chair and bent over
the wax model, his shoulder against hers. And the chance contact
meant nothing to either: but what he said about men and things
in the world was inevitably arousing the intelligence in her to
a gratitude, a happiness, at first timid, then stirring subtly,
tremulously, toward passionate response.</p>

<p>No man can do that to a girl and leave the higher side of her
indifferent or unresponsive. What he had aroused&mdash;what he was
awakening every day in her was what he must some day reckon with.
Loyalty is born of the spirit, devotion of the mind; and spiritual
intelligence arouses fiercer passions than the sensuous emotions
born of the flesh.</p>

<p>Leaning there above the table, shoulder to shoulder, his light
finger tips caressing the wax model which she had begun, he told
her clearly, and with the engaging candour which she already had
begun to adore in him, all about what she had achieved in the
interesting trifle before them&mdash;explained to her wherein she had
failed not only to accomplish but to see correctly&mdash;wherein she
had seen clearly and wrought intelligently.</p>

<p>He might have been talking to a brother sculptor&mdash;and therein
lay the fascination of this man&mdash;for her&mdash;that, and the pains
he always took with her&mdash;which courtesy was only part of him&mdash;part
of the wonder of this man; of his unerring goodness in all things
to her.</p>

<p>Listening, absorbed in all that he said she still was conscious
of a parallel thread of thought accompanying&mdash;a tiny filament
of innocent praise in her heart that chance had given her this
man to listen to and to heed and talk to and to think about.</p>

<p>"I won't touch what you've done, Miss West," he said, smilingly;
"but just take a pinch of wax&mdash;<em>that</em> way!&mdash;and accent
that relaxed flank muscle!... Don't be afraid; watch the shape
of the shadows.... That's it! Do you see? Never be afraid of dealing
vigorously with your subject. Every modification of the first
vigorous touch is bound to weaken and sometimes to emasculate....
I don't mean for you to parade crudity and bunches of exaggerated
muscle as an ultimate expression of vigour. Only the devotee of
the obvious is satisfied with that sort of result; and our exhibitions
reek with them. But there is no reason why the satin skin and
smooth contour of a naked child shouldn't express virility and
vigour&mdash;no reason why the flawless delicacy of Venus herself should
not, if necessary, express violence unexaggerated and without
either distortion or lack of finish."</p>

<p>He glanced across at the dozing cat:</p>

<p>"Under that silky black fur there are bones and fibres and muscles.
Don't exaggerate them and call your task finished; merely remember
always that they're there framing and padding the velvet skin.
More is done by skilful inference than by parading every abstract
fact you know and translating the sum-accumulative of your knowledge
into the over-accented concrete. Reticence is a kind of vigour.
It can even approach violence. The mentally garrulous kill their
own inspiration. Inadequacy loves to lump things and gamble with
chance for effective results."</p>

<p>He rose, walked over and examined Gladys, touched her contemplatively
with the button of his mahl-stick, and listened absently to her
responsive purr. Then, palette still in hand, he sat down opposite
Valerie, gazing at her in that detached manner which some mistook
for indifference:</p>

<p>"There are, I think, two reasons for failure in art," he said,
"excess of creative emotion, excess of psychological hair-splitting.
The one produces the normal and lovable failures which, decorate
our art exhibitions; the other results in those curious products
which amuse the public to good-humoured contempt &mdash;I mean
those pictures full of violent colour laid on in streaks, in great
sweeps, in patches, in dots. The painter has turned half theorist,
half scientist; the theories of the juxtaposition of colour, and
the science of complementary colours, engrosses his attention.
He is no longer an artist; he is a chemist and physiologist and
an artisan.</p>

<p>"Every now and then there is a revolt from the accepted order
of things. New groups form, sometimes damning what they call the
artificial lighting of the studio, sometimes exclaiming against
the carnival of harmonious or crude colour generally known as
'plein air.' Impressionists scorn the classic, and <em>vice versa</em>.
But, Miss West, as a matter of fact, all schools are as good as
all religions.</p>

<p>"To speak of studio lighting as artificial and unworthy is silly.
It is pretty hard to find anything really artificial in the world,
indoors, or out, or even in the glare of the footlights. I think
the main idea is that a man should prefer doing what the public
calls his work, to any other form of recreation&mdash;should use enough
reason&mdash;not too much&mdash;enough inspiration&mdash;but watching himself
at every brush stroke; and finally should feel physically unfettered&mdash;that
is, have the <em>a b c</em>, the drudgery, the artisan's part
of the work at his finger tips. Then, if he does what makes him
happy, whether in a spirit of realism or romanticism, he can safely
leave the rest to Fate."</p>

<p>He looked at her, curiously for a moment, then a smile wholly
involuntary broke over his face:</p>

<p>"Lord! What a lecture! And you listened to all that nonsense
like an angel!"</p>

<p>The dreamy absorption died out in her eyes; she clasped her hands
on her knee, looked down, then up at him almost irritably:</p>

<p>"Please go on, Mr. Neville."</p>

<p>"Not much. I've a few stunts to execute aloft there&mdash;"</p>

<p>He contemplated her in amused silence, which became more serious:</p>

<p>"You have talent, Miss West. Artistic talent is not unusual among
Americans, but patience is. That is one reason why talent accomplishes
so little in this country."</p>

<p>"Isn't another reason that patience is too expensive to be indulged
in by talent?"</p>

<p>He laughed: "That is perfectly true. The majority of us have
to make a living before we know how."</p>

<p>"Did you have to do that?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"You were fortunate?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was&mdash;perhaps.... I'm not sure."</p>

<p>She touched the lump of green wax gravely, absently. He remained
looking at her, busy with his own reflections.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have a chance to study?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Study? What?"</p>

<p>"Sculpture&mdash;any old thing! Would you like to try?</p>

<p>"What chance have I for such expensive amusements as study?"
she laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll be responsible for you."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em>?"&mdash;in blank surprise.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to the material part of it, if you like. I'll see
that you can afford the&mdash;patience."</p>

<p>"Mr. Neville, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"What don't you understand?" he asked, lazily humorous.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;that you offer me&mdash;an opportunity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; an opportunity to exercise patience. It's an offer, Miss
West. But I'm perfectly certain you won't take it."</p>

<p>For a long while she sat, her cheek resting on one palm, looking
fixedly into space. Then she stirred, glanced up, blushed vividly,
sprang to her feet and crossed to where he sat.</p>

<p>"I've been considering your offer," she said, striving to speak
without effort.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you won't accept it!"</p>

<p>"You win your wager, Mr. Neville."</p>

<p>"I wonder why?" he said with his bantering smile: "but I think
I know. Talent in America is seldom intellectually ambitious."</p>

<p>To his amazement and vexation tears sprang to her eyes; she said,
biting her lower lip: "My ambition is humble. I care&mdash;more than
anything in the world&mdash;to be of use to&mdash;to your career."</p>

<p>Taken completely by surprise he said, "Nonsense," and rose to
confront her where she stood wholly charming in her nervous, flushed
emotion:</p>

<p>"It isn't nonsense, Mr. Neville; it is my happiness.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you realise what your career means to me. I
would not willingly consider anything that might interrupt my
humble part in it&mdash;in this happy companionship.... After all,
happiness is the essential. You said so once. I am happier here
than I possibly could be in an isolation where I might perhaps
study&mdash;learn&mdash;" Her voice broke deliciously as he met her gaze
in cool, curious disapproval.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "For a long while she sat, her cheek resting on
one palm, looking fixedly into space."]</p>

<p>"You <em>can't</em> understand it!" she said, flushing almost
fiercely. "You can't comprehend what the daily intimacy with a
man of your sort has done&mdash;is doing for me every moment of my
life. How can you understand? You, who have your own place in
the world&mdash;in life&mdash;in this country&mdash;in this city! You, who have
family, friends, clubs, your social life in city and country,
and abroad. Life is very full for you&mdash;has always been. But&mdash;what
I am now learning in contact with you and with the people to whom
you have introduced me&mdash;is utterly new to me&mdash;and&mdash;very&mdash;pleasant....
I have tasted it; I cannot live without it now."</p>

<p>She drew a deep quick breath, then, looking up at him with a
tremulous smile:</p>

<p>"What would you think if I told you that, until Sam took me,
I had never even been inside a theatre except when I was engaged
by Schindler? It is perfectly true. Mother did not approve. Until
I went with John Burleson I had never ever been in a restaurant;
until I was engaged by Schindler I had never seen the city lighted
at night &mdash;I mean where the theatres and cafés and hotels
are.... And, Mr. Neville, until I came here to you, I had never
had an opportunity to talk to a cultivated man of my own age &mdash;I
mean the kind of man you are."</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes, considering, while the smile still played
faintly with the edges of her lips; then:</p>

<p>"Is it very hard for you to realise that what is an ordinary
matter of course to the young of my age is, to me, all a delightful
novelty?&mdash;that I am enjoying to a perfectly heavenly degree what
to you and others may be commonplace and uninteresting? All I
ask is to be permitted to enjoy it while I am still young enough.
I &mdash;I <em>must</em>! I really need it, Mr. Neville. It seems,
at moments, as if I could never have enough&mdash;after the years&mdash;where
I had&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>Neville had begun walking to and fro in front of her with the
quick, decisive step that characterised his movements; but his
restlessness seemed only to emphasise the attention he concentrated
on every word she spoke; and, though he merely glanced at her
from moment to moment, she was conscious that the man now understood,
and was responding more directly to her than ever before in their
brief and superficial acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go away and study," she said. "It is perfectly
dear of you to offer it &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>there is no use in
trying to thank you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>"What!" she said, startled by his use of her given name for the
first time in their acquaintance.</p>

<p>He said, smilingly grave: "You didn't think there was a string
attached to anything I offered?"</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>a string?"</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>She blushed hotly: "No, of course not."</p>

<p>"It's all right then," he nodded; but she began to think of that
new idea in a confused, startled, helpless sort of way.</p>

<p>"How could you think <em>that</em> of me?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;it must have been in your mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wanted to be sure it wasn't in <em>yours</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You ought to have known! Haven't you learned anything at all
about me in two months?"</p>

<p>"Do you think any man can learn anything about anybody in two
months?" he asked, lightly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I've learned a good deal about you&mdash;enough, anyway,
not to attribute anything&mdash;unworthy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You silly child; you've learned nothing about me if that's what
you think you've discovered."</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> discovered it!" she retorted, tremulously; "I've
learned horrid things about other men, too&mdash;and they're not like
you!"</p>

<p>"Valerie! Valerie! I'm precisely like all the rest&mdash;my selfishness
is a little more concentrated than theirs, that's the only difference.
For God's sake don't make a god of me."</p>

<p>She sat down on the head of the sofa, looking straight at him,
pretty head lowered a trifle so that her gaze was accented by
the lovely level of her brows:</p>

<p>"I've long wanted to have a thorough talk with you," she said.
"Have you got time now?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, controlling his secret amusement under an anxious
gravity as he consulted the clock.</p>

<p>"Suppose you give me an hour on those figures up there? The light
will be too poor to work by in another hour. Then we'll have tea
and 'thorough talks.'"</p>

<p>"All right," she said, calmly.</p>

<p>He picked up palette and mahl-stick and mounted to his perch
on the scaffolding; she walked slowly into the farther room, stood
motionless a moment, then raising both arms she began to unhook
the collar of her gown.</p>

<p>When she was ready she stepped into her sandals, threw the white
wool robe over her body, and tossed one end across her bare shoulder.</p>

<p>He descended, aided her aloft to her own eyrie, walked across
the planking to his own, and resumed palette and brushes in excellent
humour with himself, talking gaily while he was working:</p>

<p>"I'm devoured by curiosity to know what that 'thorough talk'
of yours is going to be about. You and I, in our briefly connected
careers, have discussed every subject on earth, gravely or flippantly,
and what in the world this 'thorough talk' is going to resemble
is beyond me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It might have to do with your lack of ceremony&mdash;a few minutes
ago," she said, laughing at him.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Lack of ceremony. You called me Valerie."</p>

<p>"You can easily revenge that presumption, you know."</p>

<p>"I think I will &mdash;Kelly."</p>

<p>He smiled as he painted:</p>

<p>"I don't know why the devil they call me Kelly," he mused. "No
episode that I ever heard of is responsible for that Milesian
misnomer. <em>Quand même</em>! It sounds prettier from you than
it ever did before. I'd rather hear you call me Kelly than Caruso
sing my name as Algernon."</p>

<p>"Shall I really call you Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You're rather celebrated&mdash;to have a girl call
you Kelly."</p>

<p>He puffed out his chest in pretence of pompous satisfaction:</p>

<p>"True, child. Good men are scarce&mdash;but the good and great are
too nearly extinct for such familiarity. Call me <em>Mr.</em>
Kelly."</p>

<p>"I won't. You are only a big boy, anyway &mdash;Louis Neville&mdash;and
sometimes I shall call you Kelly, and sometimes Louis, and very
occasionally Mr. Neville."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, absently&mdash;"only hold that distractingly
ornamental head and those incomparable shoulders a trifle more
steady, please&mdash;rest solidly on the left leg&mdash;let the right hip
fall into its natural position&mdash;<em>that's</em> it. Thank you."</p>

<p>Holding the pose her eyes wandered from him and his canvas to
the evening tinted clouds already edged with deeper gold. Through
the sheet of glass above she saw a shred of white fleece in mid-heaven
turn to a pale pink.</p>

<p>"I wonder why you asked me to tea?" she mused.</p>

<p>"What?" He turned around to look at her.</p>

<p>"You never before asked me to do such a thing," she said, candidly.
"You're an absent-minded man, Mr. Neville."</p>

<p>"It never occurred to me," he retorted, amused. "Tea is weak-minded."</p>

<p>"It occurred to me. That's what part of my 'thorough talk' is
to be about; your carelessness in noticing me except professionally."</p>

<p>He continued working, rapidly now; and it seemed to her as though
something&mdash;a hint of the sombre&mdash;had come into his face&mdash;nothing
definite&mdash;but the smile was no longer there, and the brows were
slightly knitted.</p>

<p>Later he glanced up impatiently at the sky: the summer clouds
wore a deeper rose and gold.</p>

<p>"We'd better have our foolish tea," he said, abruptly, driving
his brushes into a bowl of black soap and laying aside his palette
for his servant to clean later.</p>

<p>For a while, not noticing her, he fussed about his canvas, using
a knife here, a rag there, passing to and fro across the scaffolding,
oblivious of the flight of time, until at length the waning light
began to prophesy dusk, and he came to himself with a guilty start.</p>

<p>Below, in the studio, Valerie sat, fully dressed except for hat
and gloves, head resting in the padded depths of an armchair,
watching him in silence.</p>

<p>"I declare," he said, looking down at her contritely, "I never
meant to keep you all this time. Good Lord! Have I been puttering
up here for an hour and a half! It's nearly eight o'clock! Why
on earth didn't you speak to me, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"It's a braver girl than I am who'll venture to interrupt you
at work, Kelly," she said, laughingly. "I'm a little afraid of
you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I wasn't doing anything. My Heaven!&mdash;<em>can</em>
it be eight o'clock?"</p>

<p>"It is.... You <em>said</em> we were going to have tea."</p>

<p>"Tea! Child, you can't have tea at eight o'clock! I'm terribly
sorry"&mdash;he came down the ladder, vexed with himself, wiping the
paint from his hands with a bunch of cheese cloth&mdash;"I'm humiliated
and ashamed, Miss West. Wait a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>He walked hastily through the next room into his small suite
of apartments, washed his hands, changed his painter's linen blouse
for his street coat, and came back into the dim studio.</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry, Valerie," he said. "It was rotten rude of
me."</p>

<p>"So am I sorry. It's absurd, but I feel like a perfectly unreasonable
kid about it.... You never before asked me&mdash;and <em>I&mdash;</em>wanted
to&mdash;stay&mdash;so much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you remind me, you foolish child!"</p>

<p>"Somehow I couldn't.... I wanted <em>you</em> to think of it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm a chump...." He stood before her in the dim light;
she still reclined in the armchair, not looking at him, one arm
crook'd over her head and the fingers closed tightly over the
rosy palm which was turned outward, resting across her forehead.</p>

<p>For a few moments neither spoke; then:</p>

<p>"I'm horridly lonely to-night," she said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why, Valerie! What a&mdash;an unusual&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you.... I suppose you are too hungry to want
to talk now."</p>

<p>"N-no, I'm not." He began to laugh: "What's the matter, Valerie?
What is on your mind? Have you any serious fidgets, or are you
just a spoiled, pretty girl?"</p>

<p>"Spoiled, Kelly. There's nothing really the matter. I just felt
like&mdash;what you asked me to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>She jumped up suddenly, biting her lips with vexation: "I don't
know what I'm saying&mdash;except that it's rather rude of me&mdash;and
I've got to go home. Good-night &mdash;I think my hat is in the
dressing-room&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood uneasily watching her pin it before the mirror; he could
just see her profile and the slender, busy hands white in the
dusk.</p>

<p>When she returned, slowly drawing on her long gloves, she said
to him with composure:</p>

<p>"Some day ask me again. I really would like it&mdash;if you would."</p>

<p>"Do you really think that you could stand the excitement of taking
a cup of weak tea with me," he said, jestingly&mdash;"after all those
jolly dinners and suppers and theatres and motor parties that
I hear about?"</p>

<p>She nodded and held out her hand with decision:</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>He retained her hand a moment, not meaning to&mdash;not really intending
to ask her what he did ask her. And she raised her velvet eyes
gravely:</p>

<p>"Do you really want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I don't know why I never asked you before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was absurd not to," she said, impulsively; "I'd have gone
anywhere with you the first day I ever knew you! Besides, I dress
well enough for you not to be ashamed of me."</p>

<p>He began to laugh: "Valerie, you funny little thing! You funny,
funny little thing!"</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest," she retorted, sedately. "I'm having a
heavenly time for the first time in my life, and I have so wanted
you to be part of it ... of course you <em>are</em> part of it,"
she added, hastily&mdash;"most of it! I only meant that I &mdash;I'd
like to be a little in your other life&mdash;have you enter mine, a
little&mdash;just so I can remember, in years to come, an evening with
you now and then&mdash;to see things going on around us&mdash;to hear what
you think of things that we see together.... Because, with you,
I feel so divinely free, so unembarrassed, so entirely off my
guard.... I don't mean to say that I don't have a splendid time
with the others even when I have to watch them; I do&mdash;and even
the watching is fun&mdash;"</p>

<p>The child-like audacity and laughing frankness, the confidence
of her attitude toward him were delightfully refreshing. He looked
into her pretty, eager, engaging face, smiling, captivated.</p>

<p>"Valerie," he said, "tell me something&mdash;will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I can."</p>

<p>"I'm more or less of a painting machine. I've made myself so,
deliberately&mdash;to the exclusion of other interests. I wonder"&mdash;he
looked at her musingly&mdash;"whether I'm carrying it too far for my
own good."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;is there anything machine-made about my work? Does it
lack&mdash;does it lack anything?"</p>

<p>"No!" she said, indignantly loyal. "Why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"People&mdash;some people say it does lack&mdash;a certain quality."</p>

<p>She said with supreme contempt: "You must not believe them. I
also hear things&mdash;and I know it is an unworthy jealousy that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have you heard?" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"Absurdities. I don't wish even to think of them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish you to. Please. Such things are sometimes significant."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;is there any significance in what a few envious artists
say&mdash;or a few silly models&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More significance in what they say than in a whole chorus of
professional critics."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?" she asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Without naming anybody or betraying any confidence,
what have you heard in criticism of my work? It's from models
and brother painters that the real truth comes&mdash;usually distorted,
half told, maliciously hinted sometimes&mdash;but usually the germ
of truth is to be found in what they say, however they may choose
to say it."</p>

<p>Valerie leaned back against the door, hands clasped behind her,
eyebrows bent slightly inward in an unwilling effort to remember.</p>

<p>Finally she said impatiently: "They don't know what they're talking
about. They all say, substantially, the same thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that thing?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;oh, it's too silly to repeat&mdash;but they say there is nothing
lovable about your work&mdash;that it's inhumanly and coldly perfect&mdash;too&mdash;too&mdash;"
she flushed and laughed uncertainly&mdash;"'too damn omniscient' is
what one celebrated man said. And I could have boxed his large,
thin, celebrated ears for him!"</p>

<p>"Go on," he nodded; "what else do they say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's all they can find to say&mdash;all they dare say.
You know what they are&mdash;what other men are&mdash;and some of the younger
girls, too. Not that I don't like them&mdash;and they are very sweet
to me&mdash;only they're not like you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're more human. Is that it, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mean that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. You mean that the others take life in a perfectly
human manner&mdash;find enjoyment, amusement in each other, in a hundred
things outside of their work. They act like men and women, not
like a painting machine; if they experience impulses and emotions
they don't entirely stifle 'em. They have time and leisure to
foregather, laugh, be silly, discuss, banter, flirt, make love,
and cut up all the various harmless capers that humanity is heir
to. <em>That's</em> what you mean, but you don't realise it. And
you think, and they think, that my solemn and owlish self-suppression
is drying me up, squeezing out of me the essence of that warm,
lovable humanity in which, they say, my work is deficient. They
say, too, that my inspiration is lacking in that it is not founded
on personal experience; that I have never known any deep emotion,
any suffering, any of the sterner, darker regrets&mdash;anything of
that passion which I sometimes depict. They say that the personal
and convincing element is totally absent because I have not lived"&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;"and loved; that my work lacks the one thing which only
the self-knowledge of great happiness and great pain can lend
to it.... And &mdash;I think they are right, Valerie. What do
you think?"</p>

<p>The girl stood silent, with lowered eyes, reflecting for a moment.
Then she looked up curiously.</p>

<p>"<em>Have</em> you never been very unhappy?"</p>

<p>"I had a toothache once."</p>

<p>She said, unsmiling: "Haven't you ever suffered mentally?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not seriously. Oh, I've regretted little secret meannesses&mdash;bad
temper, jealousy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing else? Have you never experienced deep unhappiness&mdash;through
death, for example?"</p>

<p>"No, thank God. My father and mother and sister are living....
It is rather strange," he added, partly to himself, "that the
usual troubles and sorrows have so far passed me by. I am twenty-seven;
there has never been a death in my family, or among my intimate
friends."</p>

<p>"Have you any intimate friends?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;in the strict sense. I don't confide."</p>

<p>"Have you never cared, very much, for anybody&mdash;any woman?"</p>

<p>"Not sentimentally," he returned, laughing. "Do you think that
a good course of modern flirtation&mdash;a thorough schooling in the
old-fashioned misfortunes of true love would inject into my canvases
that elusively occult quality they're all howling for?"</p>

<p>She remained smilingly silent.</p>

<p>"Perhaps something less strenuous would do," he said, mischievously&mdash;"a
pretty amourette?&mdash;just one of those gay, frivolous, Louis XV
affairs with some daintily receptive girl, not really improper,
but only ultra fashionable. Do you think <em>that</em> would help
some, Valerie?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, still smiling, a little incredulous, very
slightly embarrassed:</p>

<p>"I don't think your painting requires any such sacrifices of
you, Mr. Neville.... Are you going to take me somewhere to dinner?
I'm dreadfully hungry."</p>

<p>"You poor little girl, of course I am. Besides, you must be suffering
under the terrible suppression of that 'thorough talk' which you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't really require a thorough talk," she said; "I'll
tell you now what I had to say. No, don't interrupt, please! I
want to&mdash;please let me&mdash;so that nothing will mar our enjoyment
of each other and of the gay world around us when we are dining....
It is this: Sometimes&mdash;once in a while &mdash;I become absurdly
lonely, which makes me a fool, temporarily. And&mdash;will you let
me telephone you at such times?&mdash;just to talk to you&mdash;perhaps
see you for a minute?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You know my telephone number. Call me up whenever
you like."</p>

<p>"<em>Could</em> I see you at such moments? <em>I&mdash;</em>there's
a&mdash;some&mdash;a kind of sentiment about me&mdash;when I'm <em>very</em>
lonely; and I've been foolish enough to let one or two men see
it&mdash;in fact I've been rather indiscreet&mdash;silly&mdash;with a man&mdash;several
men&mdash;now and then. A lonely girl is easily sympathised with&mdash;and
rather likes it; and is inclined to let herself go a little....
I don't want to.... And at times I've done it.... Sam Ogilvy nearly
kissed me, which really doesn't count&mdash;does it? But I let Harry
Annan do it, once.... If I'm weak enough to drift into such silliness
I'd better find a safeguard. I've been thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;that
it really does originate in a sort of foolish loneliness ...not
in anything worse. So I thought I'd have a thorough talk with
you about it. I'm twenty-one&mdash;with all my experience of life and
of men crowded into a single winter and spring. I have as friends
only the few people I have met through you. I have nobody to see
unless I see them&mdash;nowhere to go unless I go where they ask me....
So I thought I'd ask you to let me depend a little on you, sometimes&mdash;as
a refuge from isolation and morbid thinking now and then. And
from other mischief&mdash;for which I apparently have a capacity&mdash;to
judge by what I've done&mdash;and what I've let men do already."</p>

<p>She laid her hand lightly on his arm in sudden and impulsive
confidence:</p>

<p>"That's my 'thorough talk.' I haven't any one else to tell it
to. And I've told you the worst." She smiled at him adorably:
"And now I am ready to go out with you," she said,&mdash;"go anywhere
in the world with you, Kelly. And I am going to be perfectly happy&mdash;if
you are."</p>
