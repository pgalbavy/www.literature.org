There's no one ever quite so bad<br/>
That somewhere way down deep inside<br/>
A little goodness does not find<br/>
A place wherein to creep and hide.

<p>It is so with Sammy Jay. Yes, Sir, it is so with Sammy Jay. You
may think that because Sammy Jay is vain, a trouble-maker and
a thief, he is all bad. He isn't. There is some good in Sammy
Jay, just as there is some good in everybody. If there wasn't,
Old Mother Nature never, never would allow Sammy Jay to go his
mischievous way through the Green Forest. He dearly loves to get
other people into all kinds of trouble, and this is one reason
why nobody loves him. But if you watch out sharp enough, you will
find that hidden under that beautiful blue and white coat of his
there really is some good. You may have to look a long time for
it, but sooner or later you will find it. Johnny Chuck did.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay had already made a lot of trouble for Johnny Chuck.
You see he had been the first of the little forest and meadow
people to find Johnny Chuck's new house. And then, just to make
trouble for Johnny Chuck, he had told Reddy Fox about it, and
after that he had called Bowser the Hound and Farmer Brown's boy
over to it. Now he had discovered Johnny Chuck's greatest secret&mdash;that
Johnny had a family. What a chance to make trouble now!</p>

<p>Sammy started for the Green Forest as fast as his wings could
take him. He would tell Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk. They were
very fond of young Chucks. It would be great fun to see the fright
of Johnny Chuck and his family when Reddy Fox or Redtail the Hawk
appeared.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay chuckled wickedly as he flew. When he reached the Green
Forest and stopped in his favorite hemlock-tree to rest, he was
still chuckling. But by that time it was a different kind of a
chuckle. Yes, Sir, it was a different kind of a chuckle. It was
a better chuckle to hear. The fact is, Sammy Jay was no longer
chuckling over the thought of the trouble he could make. He was
laughing at the memory of how funny those three little baby Chucks
had looked sitting up on Johnny Chuck's doorstep and trying to
do whatever Johnny Chuck did. The more he thought about it, the
more he tickled and laughed.</p>

<p>Right in the midst of his laughter along came Redtail the Hawk.
Sammy Jay opened his mouth to call to Redtail and tell him about
Johnny Chuck's secret. Then he closed it again with a snap.</p>

<p>"I won't tell him yet," said Sammy to himself, "for he might
catch one of those baby Chucks, and they are such funny little
fellows that that would really be too bad. I guess I'll wait a
while." And with that, off flew Sammy Jay to hunt for some other
mischief. You see, he had had a change of heart. The little goodness
way down deep inside had come out of hiding.</p>

<p>But of course Johnny Chuck didn't know this, and over in his
new house in the far corner of the old orchard, he and Polly Chuck
were worrying and worrying, for they felt sure that now every
one would know their secret, and it wouldn't be safe for the dear
little baby Chucks to so much as put their funny little noses
outside the door.</p>
