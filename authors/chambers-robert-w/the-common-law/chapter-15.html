<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was barely daylight when Valerie awoke. She lay perfectly
still, listening, remembering, her eyes wandering over the dim,
unfamiliar room. Through thin silk curtains a little of the early
light penetrated; she heard the ceaseless chorus of the birds,
cocks crowing near and far away, the whimpering flight of pigeons
around the eaves above her windows, and their low, incessant cooing.</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the foot-bars of her bed she caught sight of
Stephanie lying sound asleep on the couch, and she sat up&mdash;swiftly,
noiselessly, staring at her out of wide eyes from which the last
trace of dreams had fled.</p>

<p>For a long while she remained upright among her pillows, looking
at Stephanie, remembering, considering; then, with decision, she
slipped silently out of bed, and went about her dressing without
a sound.</p>

<p>In the connecting bath-room and dressing-room beyond she found
her clothing gathered in a heap, evidently to be taken away and
freshened early in the morning. She dared not brush it for fear
of awakening Stephanie; her toilet was swift and simple; she clothed
herself rapidly and stepped out into the hall, her rubber-soled
walking shoes making no noise.</p>

<p>Below, the side-lights of the door made unbolting and unchaining
easy; it would be hours yet before even the servants were stirring,
but she moved with infinite caution, stepping out onto the veranda
and closing the door behind her without making the slightest noise.</p>

<p>Dew splashed her shoes as she hastened across the lawn. She knew
the Estwich road even if there had been no finger-posts to point
out her way.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet risen; woods were foggy; the cattle in the
fields stood to their shadowy flanks in the thin mist; and everywhere,
like the cheery rush of a stream, sounded the torrent of bird-music
from bramble patch and alder-swale, from hedge and orchard and
young woodland.</p>

<p>It was not until she had arrived in sight of Estwich Corners
that she met the first farmer afield; and, as she turned into
the drive, the edge of the sun sent a blinding search-light over
a dew-soaked world, and her long-shadow sprang into view, streaming
away behind her across the lawn.</p>

<p>To her surprise the front door was open and a harnessed buck-board
stood at the gate; and suddenly she recollected with a hot blush
that the household must have been amazed and probably alarmed
by her non-appearance the night before.</p>

<p>Hélène's farmer and her maid came out as she entered the front
walk, and, seeing her, stood round-eyed and gaping.</p>

<p>"I got lost and remained over night at Mrs. Collis's," she said,
smiling. "Now, I'd like a bath if you please and some fresh clothing
for travelling, because I am obliged to go to the city, and I
wish to catch the earliest train."</p>

<p>When at last it was plain to them that she was alive and well,
Hélène's maid, still trembling, hastened to draw a bath for her
and pack the small steamer trunk; and the farmer sat down on the
porch and waited, still more or less shaken by the anxiety which
had sent him pottering about the neighbouring woods and fields
with a lantern the night before, and had aroused him to renewed
endeavour before sunrise.</p>

<p>Bathed and freshly clothed, Valerie hastened into the pretty
library, seated herself at the desk, pushed up her veil, and wrote
rapidly:</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR MRS. COLLIS: </em>My gratitude to you, to Mrs. Neville,
and to Miss Swift is none the less real because I am acknowledging
it by letter. Besides, I am very certain that you would prefer
it so.</p>

<p>"You and your family have been kindness itself to me in my awkward
and painful dilemma; you have sheltered me and provided medical
attendance; and I am deeply in your debt.</p>

<p>"Had matters been different I need scarcely say that it would
have been a pleasure for me to personally acknowledge to you and
your family my grateful appreciation.</p>

<p>"But I am very sure that I could show my gratitude in no more
welcome manner than by doing what I have done this morning and
by expressing that obligation to you in writing.</p>

<p>"Before I close may I ask you to believe that I had no intention
of seeking shelter at your house? Until I heard Mr. Neville's
voice I had no idea where I was. I merely made my way toward the
first lighted windows that I saw, never dreaming that I had come
to Ashuelyn.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that my stupid misadventure has caused you and your
family so much trouble and annoyance. I feel it very keenly&mdash;more
keenly because of your kindness in making the best of what must
have been to you and your family a most disagreeable episode.</p>

<p>"May I venture to express to you my thanks to Miss Swift who
so generously remained in my room last night? I am deeply sensible
of her sweetness to an unwelcome stranger&mdash;and of Mrs. Neville's
gentle manner toward one who, I am afraid, has caused her much
anxiety.</p>

<p>"To the very amiable physician who did so much to calm a foolish
and inexcusable nervousness, I am genuinely grateful. If I knew
his name and address I would write and properly acknowledge my
debt.</p>

<p>"There is one thing more before I close: I am sorry that I wrote
you so ungraciously after receiving your last letter. It would
have been perfectly easy to have thanked you courteously, whatever
private opinion I may have entertained concerning a matter about
which there may be more than my own opinion.</p>

<p>"And now, please believe that I will never again voluntarily
cause you and your family the slightest uneasiness or inconvenience;
and believe me, too, if you care to. Very gratefully yours,</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE WEST</em>."</p>

<p>She directed and sealed the letter, then drew toward her another
sheet of paper:</p>

<p>"<em>DEAREST: I </em>could die of shame for having blundered
into your family circle. I dare not even consider what they must
think of me now. <em>You</em> will know how innocently and unsuspiciously
it was done&mdash;how utterly impossible it would have been for me
to have voluntarily committed such an act even in the last extremity.
But what <em>they</em> will think of my appearance at your door
last night, I don't know and I dare not surmise. I have done all
I could; I have rid them of me, and I have written to your sister
to thank her and your family for their very real kindness to the
last woman in the world whom they would have willingly chosen
to receive and entertain.</p>

<p>"Dear, I didn't know I had nerves; but this experience seems
to have developed them. I am perfectly well, but the country here
has become distasteful to me, and I am going to town in a few
minutes. I want to get away &mdash;I want to go back to my work&mdash;earn
my living again&mdash;live in blessed self-respect where, as a worker,
I have the right to live.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I am sorry about not meeting you at the station and
going back to town with you. But I simply cannot endure staying
here after last night. I suppose it is weak and silly of me, but
I feel now as though your family would never be perfectly tranquil
again until I am out of their immediate vicinity. I cannot convey
to you or to them how sorry and how distressed I am that this
thing has occurred.</p>

<p>"But I can, perhaps, make you understand that I love you, dearly&mdash;love
you enough to give myself to you&mdash;love you enough to give you
up forever.</p>

<p>"And it is to consider what is best, what to do, that I am going
away quietly somewhere by myself to think it all out once more&mdash;and
to come to a final decision before the first of June.</p>

<p>"I want to search my heart, and let God search it for any secret
selfishness and unworthiness that might sway me in my choice&mdash;any
overmastering love for you that might blind me. When I know myself,
you shall know me. Until then I shall not write you; but sometime
before the first of June&mdash;or on that day, you shall know and I
shall know how I have decided wherein I may best serve you&mdash;whether
by giving or withholding&mdash;whether by accepting or refusing forever
all that I care for in the world&mdash;you, Louis, and the love you
have given me.</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE WEST</em>."</p>

<p>She sealed and directed this, laid it beside the other, and summoned
the maid:</p>

<p>"Have these sent at once to Ashuelyn," she said; "let Jimmy go
on his bicycle. Are my things ready? Is the buck-board still there?
Then I will leave a note for the Countess."</p>

<p>And she scribbled hastily:</p>

<p>"HÉLÈNE <em>DEAR: I'</em>ve got to go to town in a hurry on matters
of importance, and so I am taking a very unceremonious leave of
you and of your delightful house.</p>

<p>"They'll tell you I got lost in the woods last night, and I did.
It was too stupid of me; but no harm came of it&mdash;only a little
embarrassment in accepting a night's shelter at Ashuelyn among
people who were everything that was hospitable, but who must have
been anything but delighted to entertain me.</p>

<p>"In a few weeks I shall write you again. I have not exactly decided
what to do this summer. I may go abroad for a vacation as I have
saved enough to do so in an economical manner; and I should love
to see the French cathedrals. Perhaps, if I so decide, you might
be persuaded to go with me.</p>

<p>"However, it is too early to plan yet. A matter of utmost importance
is going to keep me busy and secluded for a week or so. After
that I shall come to some definite decision; and then you shall
hear from me.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile &mdash;I have enjoyed Estwich and you immensely.
It was kind and dear of you to ask me. I shall never forget my
visit.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Hélène dear.</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE WEST</em>."</p>

<p>This note she left on Hélène's dresser, then ran downstairs and
sprang into the buck-board.</p>

<p>They had plenty of time to catch the train; and on the train
she had plenty of leisure for reflection. But she could not seem
to think; a confused sensation of excitement invaded her mind
and she sat in her velvet armed chair alternately shivering with
the memory of Cardemon's villainy, and quivering under the recollection
of her night at Ashuelyn.</p>

<p>Rita was not at home when she came into their little apartment.
The parrot greeted her, flapping his brilliant wings and shrieking
from his perch; the goldfish goggled his eyes and swam 'round
and 'round. She stood still in the centre of her room looking
vacantly about her. An immense, overwhelming sense of loneliness
came over her; she turned as the rush of tears blinded her and
flung herself full length among the pillows of her bed.</p>

<p>Her first two or three days in town were busy ones; she had her
accounts to balance, her inventories to take, her mending to do,
her modest summer wardrobe to acquire, letters to write and to
answer, engagements to make, to fulfill, to postpone; friends
to call on and to receive, duties in regard to the New Idea Home
to attend to.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The parrot greeted her, flapping his brilliant
wings and shrieking from his perch."]</p>

<p>Also, the morning after her arrival came a special delivery letter
from Neville:</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to go, dear, because, although you could not
have known it, matters have changed most happily for us. You were
a welcome guest in my sister's house; you would have been asked
to remain after your visit at Estwich was over. My family's sentiments
are changing&mdash;have changed. It requires only you yourself to convince
them. I wish you had remained, although your going so quietly
commanded the respect of everybody. They all are very silent about
it and about you, yet I can see that they have been affected most
favourably by their brief glimpse of you.</p>

<p>"As for your wishing to remain undisturbed for a few days, I
can see no reason for it now, dear, but of course I shall respect
your wishes.</p>

<p>"Only send me a line to say that the month of June will mean
our marriage. Say it, dear, because there is now no reason to
refuse."</p>

<p>To which she answered:</p>

<p>"Dearest among all men, no family's sentiments change over night.
Your people were nice to me and I have thanked them. But, dear,
I am not likely to delude myself in regard to their real sentiments
concerning me. Too deeply ingrained, too basic, too essentially
part of themselves and of their lives are the creeds, codes, and
beliefs which, in spite of themselves, must continue to govern
their real attitude toward such a girl as I am.</p>

<p>"It is dear of you to wish for us what cannot be; it is kind
of them to accept your wish with resignation.</p>

<p>"But I have told you many times, my darling, that I would not
accept a status as your wife at any cost to you or to them&mdash;and
I can read between the lines, even if I did not know, what it
would cost them and you. And so, very gently, and with a heart
full of gratitude and love for you, I must decline this public
honour.</p>

<p>"But, God willing, I shall not decline a lifetime devoted to
you when you are not with them. That is all I can hope for; and
it is so much more than I ever dreamed of having, that, to have
you at all&mdash;even for a part of the time&mdash;even for a part of my
life, is enough. And I say it humbly, reverently, without ignoble
envy or discontent for what might have been had you and I been
born to the same life amid the same surroundings.</p>

<p>"Don't write to me again, dear, until I have determined what
is best for us. Before the first day of summer, or on that day,
you will know. And so will I.</p>

<p>"My life is such a little thing compared to yours&mdash;of such slight
value and worth that sometimes I think I am considering matters
too deeply&mdash;that if I simply fling it in the scales the balance
will scarcely be altered&mdash;the splendid, even tenor of your career
will scarcely swerve a shade.</p>

<p>"Yet my life is already something to you; and besides it is all
I have to give you; and if I am to give it&mdash;if it is adding an
iota to your happiness for me to give it&mdash;then I must truly treat
it with respect, and deeply consider the gift, and the giving,
and if it shall be better for you to possess it, or better that
you never shall.</p>

<p>"And whatever I do with myself, my darling, be certain that it
is of you I am thinking and not of the girl, who loves you.</p>

<p>"V."</p>

<p>By degrees she cleared up her accounts and set her small house
in order.</p>

<p>Rita seemed to divine that something radical was in progress
of evolution, but Valerie offered no confidence, and the girl,
already deeply worried over John Burleson's condition, had not
spirit enough to meddle.</p>

<p>"Sam Ogilvy's brother is a wonder on tubercular cases," she said
to Valerie, "and I'm doing my best to get John to go and see him
at Dartford."</p>

<p>"Won't he?"</p>

<p>"He says he will, but you know how horridly untruthful men are.
And now John is slopping about with his wet clay again as usual&mdash;an
order for a tomb in Greenwood&mdash;poor boy, he had better think how
best to keep away from tombs."</p>

<p>"Why, Rita!" said Valerie, shocked.</p>

<p>"I can't help it; I'm really frightened, dear. And you know well
enough I'm no flighty alarmist. Besides, somehow, I feel certain
that Sam's brother would tell John to go to Arizona"&mdash;she pointed
piteously to her trunk: "It's packed; it has been packed for weeks.
I'm all ready to go with him. Why can't a man mould clay and chip
marble and cast bronze as well in Arizona as in this vile pest-hole?"</p>

<p>Valerie sat with folded hands looking at her.</p>

<p>"How do you think <em>you</em> could stand that desolation?"</p>

<p>"Arizona?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There is another desolation I dread more."</p>

<p>"Do you really love him so?"</p>

<p>Rita slowly turned from the window and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'And they&mdash;the majority of them&mdash;are, after all,
just men.'"]</p>

<p>"Does he know it, Rita?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;if he did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No.... How could it be&mdash;after what has happened to me?"</p>

<p>"You would tell him?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I sometimes wonder whether he has not already heard&mdash;something&mdash;from
that beast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does John know him?"</p>

<p>"He has done two fountains for his place at El Naúar. He had
several other things in view&mdash;" she shrugged&mdash;"but <em>The Mohave</em>
sailed suddenly with its owner for a voyage around the world&mdash;so
John was told;&mdash;and &mdash;Valerie, it's the first clear breath
of relief I've drawn since Penrhyn Cardemon entered John's studio."</p>

<p>"I didn't know he had ever been there."</p>

<p>"Yes; twice."</p>

<p>"Did you see him there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I nearly dropped. At first he did not recognise me &mdash;I
was very young&mdash;when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he speak to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I managed to answer. John was not looking at me, fortunately....
After that he wrote to me&mdash;and I burned the letter.... It was
horrible; he said that José Querida was his guest at El Naúar,
and he asked me to get you because you knew Querida, and be his
guest for a week end.... I cried that night; you heard me."</p>

<p>"Was <em>that</em> it!" asked Valerie, very pale.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was too wretched to tell you,"</p>

<p>Valerie sat silent, her teeth fixed in her lower lip. Then:</p>

<p>"José could not have known what kind of a man the&mdash;other&mdash;is."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"Oh, he <em>couldn't</em> have known! Rita, he wouldn't have
let him ask us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Men seldom deceive one another."</p>

<p>"You <em>don't</em> think José Querida <em>knew</em>?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;think.... Valerie, men are very&mdash;very unlike
women.... Forgive me if I seem to be embittered.... Even you have
had your experience with men&mdash;the men that all the world seems
to like&mdash;kind, jolly, generous, jovial, amusing men&mdash;and clever
men; men of attainment, of distinction. And they&mdash;the majority
of them&mdash;are, after all, just men, Valerie, just men in a world
made for men, a world into which we come like timid intruders;
uncertain through generations of uncertainty&mdash;innocently stupid
through ages of stupid innocence, ready to please though not knowing
exactly how; ready to be pleased, God knows, with pleasures as
innocent as the simple minds that dream of them.</p>

<p>"Valerie, I do not believe any evil first came into this world
of men through any woman."</p>

<p>Valerie looked down at her folded hands&mdash;small, smooth, white
hands, pure of skin and innocent as a child's.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, troubled, "how much more unhappiness
arises through men than through women, if any more ... I like
men. Some are unruly&mdash;like children; some have the sense and the
morals of marauding dogs.</p>

<p>"But, at worst, the unruly and the marauders seem so hopelessly
beneath one, intellectually, that a girl's resentment is really
more of contempt than of anger&mdash;and perhaps more of pity than
of either."</p>

<p>Rita said: "I cannot feel as charitably.... <em>You</em> still
have that right."</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita!" she said softly, "we both have loved men, you with
the ignorance and courage of a child &mdash;I with less ignorance
and with my courage as yet untested. Where is the difference between
us&mdash;if we love sincerely?"</p>

<p>Rita leaned forward and looked at her searchingly:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to do&mdash;what you said you would?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he wants me."</p>

<p>Rita sprang to her feet and began pacing the floor.</p>

<p>"I will not have it so!" she said excitedly, "I will not have
it so! If he is a man&mdash;a real man&mdash;he will not have it so, either.
If he will, he does not love you; mark what I say, Valerie&mdash;he
does not love you enough. No man can love a woman enough to accept
that from her; it would be a paradox, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"He loves me enough," said Valerie, very pale. "He could not
love me as I care for him; it is not in a man to do it, nor in
any human being to love as I love him. You don't understand, Rita.
I <em>must</em> be a part of him&mdash;not very much, because already
there is so much to him&mdash;and I am so&mdash;so unimportant."</p>

<p>"You are more important than he is," said Rita fiercely&mdash;"with
all your fineness and loyalty and divine sympathy and splendid
humility&mdash;with your purity and your loveliness; and in spite of
his very lofty intellect and his rather amazing genius, and his
inherited social respectability&mdash;<em>you</em> are the more important
to the happiness and welfare of this world&mdash;even to the humblest
corner in it!"</p>

<p>"Rita! Rita! What wild, partisan nonsense you are talking!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "His thoughts were mostly centred on Valerie."]</p>

<p>"Oh, Valerie, Valerie, if you only knew! If you only knew!"</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Querida called next day. Rita was at home but flatly refused
to see him.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Querida," she said to the janitor, "that neither I
nor Miss West are at home to him, and that if he is as nimble
at riddles as he is at mischief he can guess this one before his
friend Mr. Cardemon returns from a voyage around the world."</p>

<p>Which reply slightly disturbed Querida.</p>

<p>All during dinner&mdash;and he was dining alone&mdash;he considered it;
and his thoughts were mostly centred on Valerie.</p>

<p>Somehow, some way or other he must come to an understanding with
Valerie West. Somehow, some way, she must be brought to listen
to him. Because, while he lived, married or single, poor or wealthy,
he would never rest, never be satisfied, never wring from life
the last drop that life must pay him, until this woman's love
was his.</p>

<p>He loved her as such a man loves; he had no idea of letting that
love for her interfere with other ambitions.</p>

<p>Long ago, when very poor and very talented and very confident
that the world, which pretended to ignore him, really knew in
its furtive heart that it owed him fame and fortune and social
position, he had determined to begin the final campaign with a
perfectly suitable marriage.</p>

<p>That was all years ago; and he had never swerved in his determination&mdash;not
even when Valerie West surprised his life in all the freshness
of her young beauty.</p>

<p>And, as he sat there leisurely over his claret, he reflected,
easily, that the time had come for the marriage, and that the
woman he had picked out was perfectly suitable, and that the suitable
evening to inform her was the present evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hind-Willet was prepossessing enough to interest him, clever
enough to stop gaps in a dinner table conversation, wealthy enough
to permit him a liberty of rejecting commissions, which he had
never before dared to exercise, and fashionable enough to carry
for him what could not be carried through his own presentable
good looks and manners and fame.</p>

<p>This last winter he had become a frequenter of her house on Sixty-third
Street; and so carelessly assiduous, and so delightfully casual
had become his attentions to that beautifully groomed widow, that
his footing with her was already an intimacy, and his portrait
of her, which he had given her, had been the sensation of the
loan exhibition at the great Interborough Charity Bazaar.</p>

<p>He was neither apprehensive nor excited as he calmly finished
his claret. He was to drop in there after dinner to discuss with
her several candidates as architects for the New Idea Home.</p>

<p>So when he was entirely ready he took his hat and stick and departed
in a taxicab, pleasantly suffused with a gentle glow of anticipation.
He had waited many years for such an evening as this was to be.
He was a patient and unmoral man. He could wait longer for Valerie,&mdash;and
for the first secret blow at the happiness and threatened artistic
success of Louis Neville.</p>

<p>So he rolled away in his taxi very comfortably, savouring his
cigarette, indolently assured of his reception in a house which
it would suit him perfectly to inhabit when he cared to.</p>

<p>Only one thing worried him a little&mdash;the short note he had received
from his friend Penrhyn Cardemon, saying rather brusquely that
he'd made up his mind not to have his portrait painted for five
thousand dollars, and that he was going off on <em>The Mohave</em>
to be gone a year at least.</p>

<p>Which pained Querida, because Cardemon had not only side-stepped
what was almost a commission, but he had, also, apparently forgotten
his invitation to spend the summer on <em>The Mohave</em>&mdash;with
the understanding that Valerie West was also to be invited.</p>

<p>However, everything comes in its season; and this did not appear
to be the season for ripe commissions and yachting enterprises;
but it certainly seemed to be the season for a judicious matrimonial
enterprise.</p>

<p>And when Mrs. Hind-Willet received him in a rose-tinted reception
corner, audaciously intimate and secluded, he truly felt that
he was really missing something of the pleasures of the chase,
and that it was a little too easy to be acutely enjoyable.</p>

<p>However, when at last he had gently retained her hand and had
whispered, "Alma," and had let his big, dark, velvet eyes rest
with respectful passion upon her smaller and clearer and blacker
ones, something somewhere in the machinery seemed to go wrong&mdash;annoyingly
wrong.</p>

<p>Because Mrs. Hind-Willet began to laugh&mdash;and evidently was trying
not to&mdash;trying to remain very serious; but her little black eyes
were glistening with tears of suppressed mirth, and when, amazed
and offended, he would have withdrawn his hand, she retained it
almost convulsively:</p>

<p>"José! I <em>beg</em> your pardon! &mdash;I truly do. It is perfectly
horrid and unspeakable of me to behave this way; but listen, child!
I am forty; I am perfectly contented not to marry again; <em>and</em>
I don't love you. So, my poor José, what on earth am I to do if
I don't laugh a little. I <em>can't</em> weep over it you know."</p>

<p>The scarlet flush faded from his olive skin. "Alma," he began
mournfully, but she only shook her head, vigorously.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," she said. "You like me for a sufficient variety of
reasons. And to tell you the truth I suspect that I am quite as
madly in love with you as you actually are with me. No, no, José.
There are too many&mdash;discrepancies&mdash;of various kinds. I have too
little to gain!&mdash;to be horribly frank&mdash;and you&mdash;alas!&mdash;are a very
cautious, very clever, and admirably sophisticated young man....
There, there! I am not really accusing you&mdash;or blaming you&mdash;very
much.... I'd have tried the same thing in your place&mdash;yes, indeed
I would.... But, José dear, if you'll take the mature advice of
fair, plump, and forty, you'll let the lesser ambition go.</p>

<p>"A clever wealthy woman nearer your age, and on the edge of things&mdash;with
you for a husband, ought to carry you and herself far enough to
suit you. And there'd be more amusement in it, believe me....
And now&mdash;you may kiss my hand&mdash;very good-humoredly and respectfully,
and we'll talk about those architects. Shall we?"</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours Querida remained a profoundly astonished
man. Examine, in retrospective, as he would, the details of the
delicately adjusted machinery which for so many years had slowly
but surely turned the interlocking cog-wheels of destiny for him,
he could not find where the trouble had been&mdash;could discover no
friction caused by neglect of lubricants; no over-oiling, either;
no flaw.</p>

<p>Wherein lay the trouble? Based on what error was his theory that
the average man could marry anybody he chose? Just where had he
miscalculated?</p>

<p>He admitted that times changed very fast; that the world was
spinning at a rate that required nimble wits to keep account of
its revolutions. But his own wits were nimble, almost feminine
in the rapid delicacy of their intuition&mdash;<em>almost</em> feminine,
but not quite. And he felt, vaguely, that there lay his mistake
in engaging a woman with a woman's own weapons; and that the only
chance a man has is to perplex her with his own.</p>

<p>The world was spinning rapidly; times changed very fast, but
not as fast as women were changing in the Western World. For the
self-sufficient woman&mdash;the self-confident, self-sustaining individual,
not only content but actually preferring autonomy of mind and
body, was a fact in which José Querida had never really ever believed.
No sentimentalist does or really can. And all creators of things
artistic are, basically, sentimentalists.</p>

<p>Querida's almond-shaped, velvet eyes had done their share for
him in his time; they were merely part of a complex machinery
which, included many exquisitely adjusted parts which could produce
at will such phenomena as temporary but genuine sympathy and emotion:
a voice controlled and modulated to the finest nuances; a grace
of body and mind that resembled inherent delicacy; a nervous receptiveness
and intelligence almost supersensitive in its recognition of complicated
ethical problems. It was a machinery which could make of him any
manner of man which the opportunism of the particular moment required.
Yet, with all this, in every nerve and bone and fibre he adored
material and intellectual beauty, and physical suffering in others
actually distressed him.</p>

<p>Now, reviewing matters, deeply interested to find the microscopic
obstruction which had so abruptly stopped the machinery of destiny
for him, he was modest enough and sufficiently liberal-minded
to admit to himself that Alma Hind-Willet was the exception that
proved this rule. There <em>were</em> women so constructed that
they had become essentially unresponsive. Alma was one. But, he
concluded that if he lived a thousand years he was not likely
to encounter another.</p>

<p>And the following afternoon he called upon Mrs. Hind-Willet's
understudy, the blue-eyed little Countess d'Enver.</p>

<p>Hélène d'Enver was superintending the definite closing of her
beautiful duplex apartments&mdash;the most beautiful in the great château-like,
limestone building. And José Querida knew perfectly well what
the rents were.</p>

<p>"Such a funny time to come to see me," she had said laughingly
over the telephone; "I'm in a dreadful state with skirts pinned
up and a motor-bonnet over my hair, but I will <em>not</em> permit
my maids to touch the porcelains; and if you really wish to see
me, come ahead."</p>

<p>He really wished to. Besides he adored her Ming porcelains and
her Celedon, and the idea of any maid touching them almost gave
him heart-failure. He himself possessed one piece of Ming and
a broken fragment of Celedon. Women had been married for less.</p>

<p>She was very charming in her pinned-up skirts and her dainty
head-gear, and she welcomed him and intrusted him with specimens
which sent pleasant shivers down his flexible spine.</p>

<p>And, together, they put away many scores of specimens which were
actually priceless, inasmuch as any rumour of a public sale would
have excited amateurs to the verge of lunacy, and almost any psychopathic
might have established a new record for madness at an auction
of this matchless collection.</p>

<p>They breathed easier when the thrilling task was ended; but emotion
still enchained them as they seated themselves at a tea-table&mdash;an
emotion so deep on Hélène's part that she suffered Querida to
retain the tips of her fingers for an appreciable moment when
transferring sugar to his cup. And she listened, with a smile
almost tremulous, to the fascinating music of his voice, charmingly
attuned and modulated to a pitch which, somehow, seemed to harmonise
with the very word, Celedon.</p>

<p>"I am so surprised," she said softly&mdash;but his dark eyes noted
that she was still busy with her tea paraphernalia&mdash;"I scarcely
know what to think, Mr. Querida&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think that I love you&mdash;" breathed Querida, his dark and beautiful
head very near to her blond one.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>am&mdash;thinking of it.... But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hélène," he whispered musically;&mdash;and suddenly stiffened in
his chair as the maid came clattering in over the rugless and
polished parquet to announce Mr. Ogilvy, followed <em>san façon</em>
by that young man, swinging a straw hat and a malacca stick.</p>

<p>"Sam!" said the pretty Countess, changing countenance.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hélène! How-do, Querida! I heard you were temporarily
in town, dear lady&mdash;" He kissed a hand that was as faltering and
guilty as the irresolute eyes she lifted to his.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Querida took his leave. He dismissed the expensive
taxi which had been devouring time outside, and walked thoughtfully
away down the fashionable street.</p>

<p>Because the machinery had chanced to clog twice did not disturb
his theory; but the trouble with him was local; he was intensely
and personally annoyed, nervous, irritated unspeakably. Because,
except for Valerie, these two, Alma Hind-Willet and Hélène d'Enver,
were the only two socially and financially suitable women in whom
he took the slightest physical interest.</p>

<p>There is, in all women, one moment&mdash;sometimes repeated&mdash;in which
a sudden yielding to caprice sometimes overturns the logical plans
laid out and inexorably followed for half a lifetime. And there
was much of the feminine about Querida.</p>

<p>And it chanced to happen on this day&mdash;when no doubt all unsuspected
and unperceived some lurking jettatura had given him the evil
eye&mdash;that he passed by hazard through the block where Valerie
lived, and saw her mounting the steps.</p>

<p>"Why, José!" she exclaimed, a trifle confused in her smiling
cordiality as he sprang up the steps behind her&mdash;for Rita's bitterness,
if it had not aroused in her suspicions, had troubled her in spite
of her declaration of unbelief.</p>

<p>He asked for a cup of tea, and she invited him. Rita was in the
room when they entered; and she stood up coolly, coolly returned
Querida's steady glance and salutation with a glance as calm,
as detached, and as intelligent as a surgeon's.</p>

<p>Neither he nor she referred to his recent call; he was perfectly
self-possessed, entirely amiable with that serene and level good-humour
which sometimes masks a defiance almost contemptuous.</p>

<p>But Rita's engagements required her to leave very shortly after
his advent; and before she went out she deliberately waited to
catch Valerie's eye; and Valerie coloured deeply under her silent
message.</p>

<p>Then Rita went away with a scarcely perceptible nod to Querida;
and when, by the clock, she had been gone twenty minutes, Querida,
without reason, without preparation, and perfectly aware of his
moment's insanity, yielded to a second's flash of caprice&mdash;the
second that comes once in the lives of all women&mdash;and now, in
the ordered symmetry of his life, had come to him.</p>

<p>"Valerie," he said, "I love you. Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>She had been leaning sideways on the back of her chair, one hand
supporting her cheek, gazing almost listlessly out of the open
window.</p>

<p>She did not stir, nor did her face alter, but, very quietly she
turned her head and looked at him.</p>

<p>He spoke, breathlessly, eloquently, persuasively, and well; the
perfect machinery was imitating for him a single-minded, ardent,
honourable young man, intelligent enough to know his own mind,
manly enough to speak it. The facsimile was flawless.</p>

<p>He had finished and was waiting, long fingers gripping the arms
of his chair; and her face had altered only to soften divinely,
and her eyes were very sweet and untroubled.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have spoken this way to me, José. Something has
been said about you&mdash;in connection with Mr. Cardemon&mdash;which disturbed
me and made me very sad and miserable, although I would not permit
myself to believe it.... And now I know it was a mistake&mdash;because
you have asked me to be your wife."</p>

<p>She sat looking at him, the sadness in her eyes emphasised by
the troubled smile curving her lips:</p>

<p>"I couldn't marry you, José, because I am not in love with you.
If I were I would do it.... But I do not care for you that way."</p>

<p>For an instant some inner flare of madness blinded his brain
and vision. There was, in his face, something so terrible that
Valerie unconsciously rose to her feet, bewildered, almost stunned.</p>

<p>"I want you," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"José! What in the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>His dry lips moved, but no articulate sound came from them. Suddenly
he sprang to his feet, and out of his twisted, distorted mouth
poured a torrent of passion, of reproach, of half-crazed pleading&mdash;incoherency
tumbling over incoherency, deafening her, beating in upon her,
till she swayed where she stood, holding her arms up as though
to shield herself.</p>

<p>The next instant she was straining, twisting in his arms, striving
to cry out, to wrench herself free to keep her feet amid the crash
of the overturned table and a falling chair.</p>

<p>"José! Are you insane?" she panted, tearing herself free and
springing toward the door. Suddenly she halted, uttered a cry
as he jumped back to block her way. The low window-ledge caught
him under both knees; he clutched at nothing, reeled backward
and outward and fell into space.</p>

<p>For a second she covered her white face with both hands, then
turned, dragged herself to the open window, forced herself to
look out.</p>

<p>He lay on his back on the grass in the rear yard, and the janitor
was already bending over him. And when she reached the yard Querida
had opened both eyes.</p>

<p>Later the ambulance came, and with its surgeon came a policeman.
Querida, lying with his head on her lap, opened his eyes again:</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;seated&mdash;on the window-ledge," he said with difficulty&mdash;"and
overbalanced myself.... Caught the table&mdash;but it fell over....
That's all."</p>

<p>The eyes in his ghastly face closed wearily, then fluttered:</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, Valerie&mdash;make such a mess&mdash;in your house."</p>

<p>"Oh-h &mdash;José," she sobbed.</p>

<p>After that they took him away to the Presbyterian Hospital; and
nobody seemed to find very much the matter with him except that
he'd been badly shocked.</p>

<p>But the next day all sensation ceased in his body from the neck
downward.</p>

<p>And they told Valerie why.</p>

<p>For ten days he lay there, perfectly conscious, patient, good-humored,
and his almond-shaped and hollow eyes rested on Valerie and Rita
with a fatalistic serenity subtly tinged with irony.</p>

<p>John Burleson came to see him, and cried. After he left, Querida
said to Valerie:</p>

<p>"John and I are destined to remain near neighbours; his grief
is well meant, but a trifle premature."</p>

<p>"You are not going to die, José!" she said gently.</p>

<p>But he only smiled.</p>

<p>Ogilvy came, Annan came, the Countess Hélène, and even Mrs. Hind-Willet.
He inspected them all with his shadowy and mysterious smile, answered
them gently deep in his sunken eyes a sombre amusement seemed
to dwell. But there was in it no bitterness.</p>

<p>Then Neville came. Valerie and Rita were absent that day but
their roses filled the private ward-room with a hint of the coming
summer.</p>

<p>Querida lay looking at Neville, the half smile resting on his
pallid face like a slight shadow that faintly waxed and waned
with every breath he drew.</p>

<p>"Well," he said quietly, "you are the man I wished to see."</p>

<p>"Querida," he said, deeply affected, "this thing isn't going
to be permanent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; not permanent. It won't last, Neville. Nothing does last....
unless you can tell me whether my pictures are going to endure.
Are they? I know that you will be as honest with me as I was&mdash;dishonest
with you. I will believe what you say. Is my work destined to
be permanent?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know it is?"</p>

<p>"I thought so.... But <em>you</em> know. Because, Neville, you
are the man who is coming into what was mine, and what will be
your own;&mdash;and you are coming into more than that, Neville, more
than I ever could have attained. Now answer me; will my work live?"</p>

<p>"Always," said Neville simply.</p>

<p>Querida smiled:</p>

<p>"The rest doesn't matter then.... Even Valerie doesn't matter....
But you may hand me one of her roses.... No, a bud, if you don't
mind&mdash;unopened."</p>

<p>When it was time for Neville to go Querida's smile had faded
and the pink rose-bud lay wilted in his fingers.</p>

<p>"It is just as well, Neville," he said. "I couldn't have endured
your advent. Somebody <em>has</em> to be first; I was&mdash;as long
as I lived.... It is curious how acquiescent a man's mind becomes&mdash;when
he's like this. I never believed it possible that a man really
could die without regret, without some shadow of a desire to live.
Yet it is that way, Neville.... But a man must lie dying before
he can understand it."</p>

<p>A highly tinted uncle from Oporto arrived in New York just in
time to see Querida alive. He brought with him a parrot.</p>

<p>"Send it to Mrs. Hind-Willet," whispered Querida with stiffening
lips; "<em>uno lavanta la caça y otro la nata</em>."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he died, and his highly coloured uncle from
Oporto sent the bird to Mrs. Hind-Willet and made the thriftiest
arrangement possible to transport what was mortal of a great artist
to Oporto&mdash;where a certain kind of parrot comes from.</p>
