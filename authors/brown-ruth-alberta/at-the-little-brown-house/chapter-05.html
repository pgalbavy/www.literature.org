<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Just at dusk one cold, rainy night late in August, a shabby,
weary, wet, old man plodded through the dripping woods, across
the stone bridge, and up the road toward Parker. He had come a
long way through mud and moisture, and was very tired, yet the
first three farmhouses he passed by with scarcely a glance. But
as he neared the fourth one, he eagerly scanned the place as if
familiar with its surroundings, and listened intently for the
sound of voices, seeming disappointed at the result, for apparently
not a creature was stirring indoors or out. Not even old Towzer
came to challenge him as he unlatched the gate and approached
the house, and not a ray of light shone out into the darkness
from window or door, though it was yet early evening. The place
was as silent as a grave. Puzzled, the man made a circuit of the
cottage, but neither saw nor heard anything of the occupants.</p>

<p>"I wonder what has happened," he thought to himself. "Guess I
won't knock, it might scare them if they have gone to bed. Maybe
they are away visiting. I will just slip into the barn and go
to bed in the hay. Lucky I had a big dinner, I am not in the least
hungry now, and if they are at home I can get breakfast here in
the morning &mdash;I guess."</p>

<p>He had tramped many long miles since dawn, trying to reach this
town before nightfall, and was so worn out with his exertions
that he fell asleep almost as soon as he had burrowed a comfortable
bed in the sweet-scented hay, nor did he awake until the new day
was several hours old. The sun was shining&mdash;he could tell that
from the bright light in the barn, but it was not the sunshine
which had awakened him.</p>

<p>The first thing he was conscious of as he opened his eyes to
unfamiliar surroundings was the sound of voices close by, and
the patter of feet on the loose boards overhead. Cautiously he
lifted himself on his elbow and looked about him, but at first
he saw only an untidy confusion of garden tools, boxes, bags and
other truck, piled promiscuously about wherever space would accommodate
them. Then as his eyes became more accustomed to the light, he
discovered a slender, brown-haired girl in a faded, dingy, calico
gown huddled on top of a pile of empty grain sacks in the darkest
corner of the barn. Her face was turned from him, but from her
attitude and the sound of an occasional sniff, he judged that
she had been crying. Her companion on the rafters overhead was
out of range of his vision; but as she scrambled noisily over
the loose board floor, which extended only half way across the
building, he could catch a glimpse of red now and then, and once
a bare, brown foot appeared in view, but that was all. Not daring
to make his presence known for fear of frightening the two sisters,
he drew silently back into his hiding place to await their departure.</p>

<p>Sniff, sniff, sniff! The slender shoulders of the girl in the
corner began to heave, and she buried her face deeper among the
grain sacks. Silence on the rafters for a brief moment; then a
voice said severely, "'F I was you, Faith Greenfield, I'd stop
crying and go into the house and help Gail. She is trying to do
the washing herself so's to save money."</p>

<p>"'F I was you, Peace Greenfield," was the tart reply, "I'd try
to mind my business once in a while, and not be forever poking
my nose into other folks' affairs."</p>

<p>"Guess this is my affair as much as 'tis yours!" answered Peace
sharply, and the listener in the hay below fancied there was the
suggestion of a sob in her voice.</p>

<p>"It's none of your affair if I want to come out here by myself,
but you can't even let me alone here. You are always snooping
around to see what I am doing."</p>

<p>"I am <em>not</em> snooping!" was the indignant denial. "I'm
hunting eggs for breakfast, and I was here first, 'cause I saw
you come in bawling."</p>

<p>"Bawling!" Faith leaped to her feet in wild fury. "You know well
enough why I am crying. You would be crying, too, if you cared
like I do."</p>

<p>"I can cry with my heart without stopping to cry with my eyes,"
Peace answered soberly. "I haven't time to sit down and bawl.
Someone's got to run errands and help Gail. S'posing we all sat
up and cried all the time like you are doing. Who would get breakfast
and dinner and supper, I'd like to know? And who would 'tend to
the work?"</p>

<p>"Who wants any breakfast or dinner or supper? I am sure I don't!
I haven't the heart to eat. I <em>can't</em> eat!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Bainbridge told us we must, and so did Mr. Strong; and he
told us to keep busy, too. It helps you to forget the ache if
you work."</p>

<p>"Forget! You don't care; that's why&mdash;" There was a sudden movement
on the rafters above, and an egg came hurtling through the barn,
smashing on the wall close by Faith's head&mdash;so close that a shower
of little yellow spatters flew over her face and dress. "Peace
Greenfield!"</p>

<p>"You haven't got half what you deserve," said a tense, hard voice
from above. "I ought to have slung the whole batch, even if we'd
had to go without breakfast. I'd like to know how <em>you</em>
can tell whether you care more than the rest of us. You think
you are the only one that knows how to be sorry."</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence&mdash;deep, ominous, it seemed to the man
in the hay, and he ventured to peep out at the combatants, but
all he saw was Faith standing rigid and white-faced in the corner.
When she spoke, her voice was frigid in its intensity.</p>

<p>"Come down from those beams, Peace Greenfield, and take the rest
of those eggs to the house!"</p>

<p>"I am coming down as fast as I can," began Peace's voice, equally
frigid. Then there was a sound of ripping, a dreadful clatter,
a dull thud, and Faith rushed forward with the agonized scream,
"Oh, Peace, Peace, are you hurt? I am sorry I was ugly! You <em>do</em>
care! Open your eyes, Peace! Oh-h-h-h!"</p>

<p>The tramp started up in dismay, to behold Peace huddled in a
heap at the foot of the ladder, with frantic Faith bending over
her. Before he had stepped from the haymow, however, there was
a rush of feet from without, and four frightened girls dashed
into the barn, followed by a tall, young man in clerical garb;
and the shabby figure slunk back into his hiding place without
making his presence known.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"Run for the doctor!" cried the excited voices.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gail, I've killed her, I've killed her!" sobbed Faith.</p>

<p>"Stand back, girls," quietly commanded the minister, pushing
the trembling quartette almost roughly aside. "Let me examine
her. Perhaps she is only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm every bit all right," exclaimed Peace crossly, winking her
brown eyes dazedly. "The fall <em>stunted</em> me, I guess. I
lit on my head. So did the eggs. Mercy me! What a mess!"</p>

<p>"But look at her face!" wailed frightened and penitent Faith.
"She has turned black, and so have her hands!"</p>

<p>She certainly <em>had</em> changed her color.</p>

<p>At Faith's despairing cry, the victim of the fall raised one
of her brown hands and looked at it fixedly; then said briefly,
"That's ashes. It's on my face, too. It will wash off, won't it?"</p>

<p>Without reply, the minister lifted her to her feet and drew her
into the doorway where the sunlight fell upon her. The sisters
looked at the grotesque picture, and exclamations of horror and
dismay burst from their lips.</p>

<p>"Peace, what have you done to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Are you sick?"</p>

<p>"What have you got on?"</p>

<p>She presented a strange appearance, truly, draped in dirty, ragged
burlap, with face, hands and hair covered with ashes, and smeared
from head to foot with broken eggs and bits of eggshell.</p>

<p>The tramp hid his face in the hay to stifle his chuckles, the
minister covered his twitching lips with his hands, but the little
group of sisters gazed at the apparition with only horror in their
eyes.</p>

<p>Then, to everyone's amazement, Peace began to cry. In an instant
Gail had slipped her arms around her, and had drawn the brown
head down on her shoulder, where for a moment the child sobbed
heartbrokenly. Then, with a mighty gulp, she swallowed back her
grief and explained, "I heard Hope reading about the people who
put on ash-cloth and sashes &mdash;I mean sackcloth and ashes
whenever any one of their family died, so's the angels would let
the soul into heaven. No one did that when papa died&mdash;and we don't
know whether he ever got to heaven or not&mdash;but he's a man and
could take care of himself, s'posing he didn't get in. With mother
it's different, though. She's a ninvalid, and I couldn't bear
to think of her outside the gates all alone with none of us to
take care of her&mdash;so I put on potato sacks&mdash;that's sackcloth,
ain't it?&mdash;and ashes. The eggs got there by mistake. They were
whole when I began to climb down that ladder."</p>

<p>The picture was so ludicrous, the explanation so piteous, that
between their wild desire to laugh and the stronger desire to
cry, it was a hysterical group who closed in once more about the
grotesque little figure, while the earnest-hearted, sympathetic
young preacher swept away Peace's fears, and gave her the comfort
and assurance she sought.</p>

<p>"Sackcloth and ashes were merely outward signs of mourning for
nations in ages past," he told her. "It didn't help anyone get
into heaven. It didn't even show how great were their sorrow and
grief; and when people came to realize that, they ceased to follow
the custom. God knows how sorrowful we are, for He can read our
very thoughts. It doesn't need sackcloth and ashes to carry our
loved ones home, dear. They lived good, noble, true lives in His
sight while they were here on earth, and now He has taken them
home&mdash;inside the Gates&mdash;to live with Him always."</p>

<p>"You are sure?" hiccoughed Peace.</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure! The Bible tells us so."</p>

<p>"Where? I want to see for myself."</p>

<p>He drew a worn Testament from his pocket, turned to the Fourteenth
Chapter of St. John, and slowly, impressively read those beautiful
words, "In my Father's house are many mansions," explaining his
understanding of the passage so clearly, so comfortingly that
finally the tears were dried and the aching hearts soothed.</p>

<p>At length the grief-stricken company repaired to the house for
their belated breakfast, while the tramp, touched to the quick
by the pathos of the scene he had just witnessed, made his way
across the fields and through the woods, leaving only a crumpled
ten-dollar bill among the grain sacks to tell of his visit.</p>
