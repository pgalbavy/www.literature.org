<P>
As De Vac drew his sword from the heart of the Lady Maud, he winced, for,
merciless though he was, he had shrunk from this cruel task.  Too far he
had gone, however, to back down now, and, had he left the Lady Maud alive,
the whole of the palace guard and all the city of London would have been on
his heels in ten minutes; there would have been no escape.
<P>
The little Prince was now so terrified that he could but tremble and
whimper in his fright.  So fearful was he of the terrible De Vac that a
threat of death easily stilled his tongue, and so the grim, old man led him
to the boat hidden deep in the dense bushes.
<P>
De Vac did not dare remain in this retreat until dark, as he had first
intended.  Instead, he drew a dingy, ragged dress from the bundle beneath
the thwart and in this disguised himself as an old woman, drawing a cotton
wimple low over his head and forehead to hide his short hair.  Concealing
the child beneath the other articles of clothing, he pushed off from the
bank, and, rowing close to the shore, hastened down the Thames toward the
old dock where, the previous night, he had concealed his skiff.  He reached
his destination unnoticed, and, running in beneath the dock, worked the
boat far into the dark recess of the cave-like retreat.
<P>
Here he determined to hide until darkness had fallen, for he knew that the
search would be on for the little lost Prince at any moment, and that none
might traverse the streets of London without being subject to the closest
scrutiny.
<P>
Taking advantage of the forced wait, De Vac undressed the Prince and
clothed him in other garments, which had been wrapped in the bundle hidden
beneath the thwart; a little red cotton tunic with hose to match, a black
doublet and a tiny leather jerkin and leather cap.
<P>
The discarded clothing of the Prince he wrapped about a huge stone torn
from the disintegrating masonry of the river wall, and consigned the bundle
to the voiceless river.
<P>
The Prince had by now regained some of his former assurance and, finding
that De Vac seemed not to intend harming him, the little fellow commenced
questioning his grim companion, his childish wonder at this strange
adventure getting the better of his former apprehension.
<P>
"What do we here, Sir Jules ?" he asked.  "Take me back to the King's, my
father's palace.  I like not this dark hole nor the strange garments you
have placed upon me."
<P>
"Silence, boy !" commanded the old man.  "Sir Jules be dead, nor are you a
king's son.  Remember these two things well, nor ever again let me hear you
speak the name Sir Jules, or call yourself a prince."
<P>
The boy went silent, again cowed by the fierce tone of his captor.
Presently he began to whimper, for he was tired and hungry and
frightened -- just a poor little baby, helpless and hopeless in the hands
of this cruel enemy -- all his royalty as nothing, all gone with the silken
finery which lay in the thick mud at the bottom of the Thames, and
presently he dropped into a fitful sleep in the bottom of the skiff.
<P>
When darkness had settled, De Vac pushed the skiff outward to the side of
the dock and, gathering the sleeping child in his arms, stood listening,
preparatory to mounting to the alley which led to old Til's place.
<P>
As he stood thus, a faint sound of clanking armor came to his attentive
ears; louder and louder it grew until there could be no doubt but that a
number of men were approaching.
<P>
De Vac resumed his place in the skiff, and again drew it far beneath the
dock.  Scarcely had he done so ere a party of armored knights and
men-at-arms clanked out upon the planks above him from the mouth of the
dark alley.  Here they stopped as though for consultation and plainly could
the listener below hear every word of their conversation.
<P>
"De Montfort," said one, "what thinkest thou of it ?  Can it be that the
Queen is right and that Richard lies dead beneath these black waters ?"
<P>
"No, De Clare," replied a deep voice, which De Vac recognized as that of
the Earl of Leicester.  "The hand that could steal the Prince from out of
the very gardens of his sire without the knowledge of Lady Maud or her
companion, which must evidently have been the case, could more easily and
safely have dispatched him within the gardens had that been the object of
this strange attack.  I think, My Lord, that presently we shall hear from
some bold adventurer who holds the little Prince for ransom.  God give that
such may be the case, for of all the winsome and affectionate little
fellows I have ever seen, not even excepting mine own dear son, the little
Richard was the most to be beloved.  Would that I might get my hands upon
the foul devil who has done this horrid deed."
<P>
Beneath the planks, not four feet from where Leicester stood, lay the
object of his search.  The clanking armor, the heavy spurred feet, and the
voices above him had awakened the little Prince and, with a startled cry,
he sat upright in the bottom of the skiff.  Instantly De Vac's iron band
clapped over the tiny mouth, but not before a single faint wail had reached
the ears of the men above.
<P>
"Hark !  What was that, My Lord ?" cried one of the men-at-arms.
<P>
In tense silence they listened for a repetition of the sound and then De
Montfort cried out:
<P>
"What ho, below there !  Who is it beneath the dock ?  Answer, in the name
of the King !"
<P>
Richard, recognizing the voice of his favorite uncle, struggled to free
himself, but De Vac's ruthless hand crushed out the weak efforts of the
babe, and all was quiet as the tomb, while those above stood listening for
a repetition of the sound.
<P>
"Dock rats," said De Clare, and then as though the devil guided them to
protect his own, two huge rats scurried upward from between the loose
boards, and ran squealing up the dark alley.
<P>
"Right you are," said De Montfort, "but I could have sworn 'twas a child's
feeble wail had I not seen the two filthy rodents with mine own eyes.
Come, let us to the next vile alley.  We have met with no success here,
though that old hag who called herself Til seemed overanxious to bargain
for the future information she seemed hopeful of being able to give us."
<P>
As they moved off, their voices grew fainter in the ears of the listeners
beneath the dock and soon were lost in the distance.
<P>
"A close shave," thought De Vac, as he again took up the child and prepared
to gain the dock.  No further noises occurring to frighten him, he soon
reached the door to Til's house and, inserting the key, crept noiselessly
to the garret room which he had rented from his ill-favored hostess.
<P>
There were no stairs from the upper floor to the garret above, this ascent
being made by means of a wooden ladder which De Vac pulled up after him,
closing and securing the aperture, through which he climbed with his
burden, by means of a heavy trapdoor equipped with thick bars.
<P>
The apartment which they now entered extended across the entire east end of
the building, and had windows upon three sides.  These were heavily
curtained.  The apartment was lighted by a small cresset hanging from a
rafter near the center of the room.
<P>
The walls were unplastered and the rafters unceiled; the whole bearing a
most barnlike and unhospitable appearance.
<P>
In one corner was a huge bed, and across the room a smaller cot; a
cupboard, a table, and two benches completed the furnishings.  These
articles De Vac had purchased for the room against the time when he should
occupy it with his little prisoner.
<P>
On the table were a loaf of black bread, an earthenware jar containing
honey, a pitcher of milk and two drinking horns.  To these, De Vac
immediately gave his attention, commanding the child to partake of what he
wished.
<P>
Hunger for the moment overcame the little Prince's fears, and he set to
with avidity upon the strange, rough fare, made doubly coarse by the rude
utensils and the bare surroundings, so unlike the royal magnificence of his
palace apartments.
<P>
While the child ate, De Vac hastened to the lower floor of the building in
search of Til, whom he now thoroughly mistrusted and feared.  The words of
De Montfort, which he had overheard at the dock, convinced him that here
was one more obstacle to the fulfillment of his revenge which must be
removed as had the Lady Maud; but in this instance there was neither youth
nor beauty to plead the cause of the intended victim, or to cause the grim
executioner a pang of remorse.
<P>
When he found the old hag, she was already dressed to go upon the street,
in fact he intercepted her at the very door of the building.  Still clad as
he was in the mantle and wimple of an old woman, Til did not, at first,
recognize him, and when he spoke, she burst into a nervous, cackling laugh,
as one caught in the perpetration of some questionable act, nor did her
manner escape the shrewd notice of the wily master of fence.
<P>
"Whither, old hag ?" he asked.
<P>
"To visit Mag Tunk at the alley's end, by the river, My Lord," she replied,
with more respect than she had been wont to accord him.
<P>
"Then, I will accompany you part way, my friend, and, perchance, you can
give me a hand with some packages I left behind me in the skiff I have
moored there."
<P>
And so the two walked together through the dark alley to the end of the
rickety, dismantled dock; the one thinking of the vast reward the King
would lavish upon her for the information she felt sure she alone could
give; the other feeling beneath his mantle for the hilt of a long dagger
which nestled there.
<P>
As they reached the water's edge, De Vac was walking with his right
shoulder behind his companion's left, in his hand was gripped the keen
blade and, as the woman halted on the dock, the point that hovered just
below her left shoulder-blade plunged, soundless, into her heart at the
same instant that De Vac's left hand swung up and grasped her throat in a
grip of steel.
<P>
There was no sound, barely a struggle of the convulsively stiffening old
muscles, and then, with a push from De Vac, the body lunged forward into
the Thames, where a dull splash marked the end of the last hope that Prince
Richard might be rescued from the clutches of his Nemesis.
