    Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of
    the country she was going to travel through. `It's something
    very like learning geography,' thought Alice, as she stood on
    tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further.
    `Principal rivers -- there <I>are</I> none. Principal mountains -- I'm
    on the only one, but I don't think it's got any name. Principal
    towns -- why, what <I>are</I> those creatures, making honey down there?
    They can't be bees -- nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know -
    - ' and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that
    was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into
    them, `just as if it was a regular bee,' thought Alice.
    <P>
      However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was
      an elephant -- as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite
      took her breath away at first. `And what enormous flowers they
      must be!' was her next idea. `Something like cottages with the
      roofs taken off, and stalks put to them -- and what quantities of
      honey they must make! I think I'll go down and -- no, I won't
      <I>just</I> yet, ' she went on, checking herself just as she was
      beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
      for turning shy so suddenly. `It'll never do to go down among
      them without a good long branch to brush them away -- and what
      fun it'll be when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say --
      "Oh, I like it well enough -- "' (here came the favourite little
      toss of the head), `"only it was so dusty and hot, and the
      elephants did tease so!"'
    <P>
      `I think I'll go down the other way,' she said after a pause:
      `and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do
      so want to get into the Third Square!'
    <P>
      So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the
      first of the six little brooks.
    <P>
      <hr>
    <P>
      `Tickets, please!' said the Guard, putting his head in at the
      window. In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they
      were about the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill
      the carriage.
    <P>
      `Now then! Show your ticket, child!' the Guard went on,
      looking angrily at Alice. And a great many voices all said
      together (`like the chorus of a song,' thought Alice), `Don't
      keep him waiting, child! Why, his time is worth a thousand
      pounds a minute!'
    <P>
      `I'm afraid I haven't got one,' Alice said in a frightened
      tone: `there wasn't a ticket-office where I came from." And
      again the chorus of voices went on. `There wasn't room for one
      where she came from. The land there is worth a thousand pounds
      an inch!'
    <P>
      `Don't make excuses,' said the Guard: `you should have bought
      one from the engine-driver.' And once more the chorus of voices
      went on with `The man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke
      alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!'
    <P>
      Alice thought to herself, `Then there's no use in speaking."
      The voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to
      her great surprise, they all <I>thought</I> in chorus (I hope you
      understand what <I>thinking in chorus</I> means -- for I must confess
      that <I>I</I> don't), `Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a
      thousand pounds a word!'
    <P>
      `I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I
      shall!' thought Alice.
    <P>
      All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a
      telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-
      glass. At last he said, `You're travelling the wrong way,' and
      shut up the window and went away.
    <P>
      `So young a child,' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her
      (he was dressed in white paper), `ought to know which way she's
      going, even if she doesn't know her own name!'
    <P>
      A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut
      his eyes and said in a loud voice, `She ought to know her way to
      the ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet!'
    <P>
      There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very
      queer carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule
      seemed to be that they should all speak in turn, <I>he</I> went on with
      `She'll have to go back from here as luggage!'
    <P>
      Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a
      hoarse voice spoke next. `Change engines -- ' it said, and was
      obliged to leave off.
    <P>
      `It sounds like a horse,' Alice thought to herself. And an
      extremely small voice, close to her ear, said, `You might make a
      joke on that -- something about "horse" and "hoarse," you know.'
    <P>
      Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, `She must be
      labelled "Lass, with care," you know -- '
    <P>
      And after that other voices went on (What a number of people
      there are in the carriage!' thought Alice), saying, `She must go
      by post, as she's got a head on her -- ' `She must be sent as a
      message by the telegraph -- ' `She must draw the train herself
      the rest of the way -- ' and so on.
    <P>
      But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and
      whispered in her ear, `Never mind what they all say, my dear, but
      take a return-ticket every time the train stops."
    <P>
      `Indeed I shan't!' Alice said rather impatiently. `I don't
      belong to this railway journey at all -- I was in a wood just now
      -- and I wish I could get back there.'
    <P>
      `You might make a joke on <I>that</I>, said the little voice close to
      her ear: `something about "you <I>would</I> if you could," you know.'
    <P>
      `Don't tease so,' said Alice, looking about in vain to see
      where the voice came from; `if you're so anxious to have a joke
      made, why don't you make one yourself?'
    <P>
      The little voice sighed deeply: it was <I>very</I> unhappy,
      evidently, and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort
      it, `If it would only sigh like other people!' she thought. But
      this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn't have
      heard it at all, if it hadn't come <I>quite</I> close to her ear. The
      consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and
      quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor
      little creature.
    <P>
      `I know you are a friend, the little voice went on; `a dear
      friend, and an old friend. And you won't hurt me, though I <I>am</I> an
      insect.'
    <P>
      `What kind of insect?' Alice inquired a little anxiously. What
      she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but
      she thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask.
    <P>
      `What, then you don't -- ' the little voice began, when it was
      drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped
      up in alarm, Alice among the rest.
    <P>
      The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew
      it in and said, `It's only a brook we have to jump over.'
      Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little
      nervous at the idea of trains jumped at all. `However, it'll
      take us into the Fourth Square, that's some comfort!' she said to
      herself. In another moment she felt the carriage rise straight
      up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing
      nearest to her hand. which happened to be the Goat's beard.
    <P>
      <hr>
    <P>
      But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she
      found herself sitting quietly under a tree -- while the Gnat (for
      that was the insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself
      on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with its wings.
    <P>
      It certainly was a <I>very</I> large Gnat: `about the size of a
      chicken,' Alice thought. Still, she couldn't feel nervous with
      it, after they had been talking together so long.
    <P>
      ` -- then you don't like all insects?' the Gnat went on, as
      quietly as if nothing had happened.
    <P>
      `I like them when they can talk,' Alice said. `None of them
      ever talk, where <I>I</I> come from.'
    <P>
      `What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where <I>you</I> come from?'
      the Gnat inquired.
    <P>
      `I don't <I>rejoice</I> in insects at all,' Alice explained, `because
      I'm rather afraid of them -- at least the large kinds. But I can
      tell you the names of some of them."
    <P>
      `Of course they answer to their names?' the Gnat remarked
      carelessly.
    <P>
      `I never knew them do it.'
    <P>
      `What's the use of their having names the Gnat said, `if they
      won't answer to them?'
    <P>
      `No use to <I>them</I>,' said Alice; `but it's useful to the people
      who name them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at
      all?'
    <P>
      `I can't say,' the Gnat replied. `Further on, in the wood
      down there, they've got no names -- however, go on with your list
      of insects: you're wasting time.'
    <P>
      `Well, there's the Horse-fly,' Alice began, counting off the
      names on her fingers.
    <P>
      `All right,' said the Gnat: `half way up that bush, you'll see
      a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It's made entirely of wood,
      and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.'
    <P>
      `What does it live on?' Alice asked, with great curiosity.
    <P>
      `Sap and sawdust,' said the Gnat. `Go on with the list.'
    <P>
      Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest,
      and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it
      looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on.
    <P>
      `And there's the Dragon-fly.'
    <P>
      `Look on the branch above your head,' said the Gnat, `and there
      you'll find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding,
      its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in
      brandy.'
    <P>
      `And what does it live on?'
    <P>
      `Frumenty and mince pie,' the Gnat replied; `and it makes is
      nest in a Christmas box.'
    <P>
      `And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, after she had
      taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had
      thought to herself, `I wonder if that's the reason insects are so
      fond of flying into candles -- because they want to turn into
      Snap-dragon-flies!'
    <P>
      `Crawling at your feet,' said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet
      back in some alarm), `you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its
      wings are thin slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust,
      and its head is a lump of sugar.'
    <P>
      `And what does <I>it</I> live on?'
    <P>
      `Weak tea with cream in it.'
    <P>
      A new difficulty came into Alice's head. `Supposing it
      couldn't find any?' she suggested.
    <P>
      `Then it would die, of course.'
    <P>
      `But that must happen very often,' Alice remarked thoughtfully.
    <P>
      `It always happens,' said the Gnat.
    <P>
      After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering.
      The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her
      head: at last it settled again and remarked, `I suppose you
      don't want to lose your name?'
    <P>
      `No, indeed,' Alice said, a little anxiously.
    <P>
      `And yet I don't know,' the Gnat went on in a careless tone:
      `only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go
      home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call
      you to your lessons, she would call out "come here -- ," and
      there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any
      name for her to all, and of course you wouldn't have to go, you
      know.'
    <P>
      `That would never do, I'm sure,' said Alice: `the governess
      would never think of excusing me lessons for that. If she
      couldn't remember my name, she'd call me "Miss!" as the servants
      do.'
    <P>
      `Well. if she said "Miss," and didn't say anything more,' the
      Gnat remarked, `of course you'd miss your lessons. That's a
      joke. I wish <I>you</I> had made it.'
    <P>
      `Why do you wish <I>I</I> had made it?' Alice asked. `It's a very
      bad one.'
    <P>
      But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came
      rolling down its cheeks.
    <P>
      `You shouldn't make jokes,' Alice said, `if it makes you so
      unhappy.'
    <P>
      Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this
      time the poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for,
      when Alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on
      the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still
      so, long she got up and walked on.
    <P>
      She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other
      side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice
      felt a <I>little</I> timid about going into it. However, on second
      thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: `for I certainly won't
      go <I>back</I>,' she thought to herself, and this was the only way to
      the Eighth Square.
    <P>
      `This must be the wood, she said thoughtfully to herself,
      `where things have no names. I wonder what'll become of <I>my</I> name
      when I go in? I shouldn't like to lose it at all -- because
      they'd have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to
      be an ugly one. But then the fun would be, trying to find the
      creature that had got my old name! That's just like the
      advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs -- "<I>answers to
        the name of `Dash:' had on a brass collar</I>" -- just fancy calling
      everything you met "Alice," till one of them answered! Only they
      wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.'
    <P>
      She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it
      looked very cool and shady. `Well, at any rate it's a great
      comfort,' she said as she stepped under the trees, `after being
      so hot, to get into the -- into <I>what</I>?' she went on, rather
      surprised at not being able to think of the word. `I mean to get
      under the -- under the -- under <I>this</I>, you know!' putting her
      hand on the trunk of the tree. `What <I>does</I> it call itself, I
      wonder? I do believe it's got no name -- why, to be sure it
      hasn't!'
    <P>
      She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly
      began again. `Then it really <I>has</I> happened, after all! And how,
      who am I? I <I>will</I> remember, if I can! I'm determined to do it!'
      But being determined didn't help much, and all she could say,
      after a great deal of puzzling, was,`L, I <I>know</I> it begins with L!'
    <P>
      Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with
      its large gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened. `Here
      then! Here then!' Alice said, as he held out her hand and tried
      to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood
      looking at her again.
    <P>
      `What do you call yourself?' the Fawn said at last. Such a
      soft sweet voice it had!
    <P>
      `I wish I knew!' thought poor Alice. She answered, rather
      sadly, `Nothing, just now.'
    <P>
      `Think again,' it said: `that won't do.'
    <P>
      Alice thought, but nothing came of it. `Please, would you tell
      me what <I>you</I> call yourself?' she said timidly. `I think that
      might help a little.'
    <P>
      `I'll tell you, of you'll move a little further on,' the Fawn
      said. `I can't remember here.'
    <P>
      So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms
      clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came
      out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden
      bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alice's arms.
      `I'm a Fawn!' it cried out in a voice of delight, `and, dear me!
      you're a human child!' A sudden look of alarm came into its
      beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away a
      full speed.
    <P>
      Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation
      at having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly.
      `However, I know my name now.' she said, `that's <I>some</I> comfort.
      Alice -- Alice -- I won't forget it again. And now, which of
      these finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?'
    <P>
      It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was
      only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both
      pointed along it. `I'll settle it,' Alice said to herself, `when
      the road divides and they point different ways.'
    <P>
      But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a
      long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two
      finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked `TO TWEEDLEDUM'S
      HOUSE' and the other `TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.'
    <P>
      `I do believe,' said Alice at last, `that they live in the same
      house! I wonder I never thought of that before -- But I can't
      stay there long. I'll just call and say "how d'you do?" and ask
      them the way out of the wood. If I could only get the Eighth
      Square before it gets dark!' So she wandered on, talking to
      herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came
      upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help
      starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself,
      feeling sure that they must be
