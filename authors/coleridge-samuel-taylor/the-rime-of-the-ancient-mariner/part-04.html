		<p>"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!<br />
			I fear thy skinny hand!<br />
			And thou art long, and lank, and brown,<br />
			As is the ribbed sea-sand.
		</p>
		<p>"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,<br />
			And thy skinny hand, so brown."--<br />
			Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!<br />
			This body dropt not down.
		</p>
		<p>Alone, alone, all, all alone,<br />
			Alone on a wide wide sea!<br />
			And never a saint took pity on<br />
			My soul in agony.
		</p>
		<p>The many men, so beautiful!<br />
			And they all dead did lie:<br />
			And a thousand thousand slimy things<br />
			Lived on; and so did I.
		</p>
		<p>I looked upon the rotting sea,<br />
			And drew my eyes away;<br />
			I looked upon the rotting deck,<br />
			And there the dead men lay.
		</p>
		<p>I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:<br />
			But or ever a prayer had gusht,<br />
			A wicked whisper came, and made<br />
			my heart as dry as dust.
		</p>
		<p>I closed my lids, and kept them close,<br />
			And the balls like pulses beat;<br />
			For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky<br />
			Lay like a load on my weary eye,<br />
			And the dead were at my feet.
		</p>
		<p>The cold sweat melted from their limbs,<br />
			Nor rot nor reek did they:<br />
			The look with which they looked on me<br />
			Had never passed away.
		</p>
		<p>An orphan's curse would drag to Hell<br />
			A spirit from on high;<br />
			But oh! more horrible than that<br />
			Is a curse in a dead man's eye!<br />
			Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,<br />
			And yet I could not die.
		</p>
		<p>The moving Moon went up the sky,<br />
			And no where did abide:<br />
			Softly she was going up,<br />
			And a star or two beside.
		</p>
		<p>Her beams bemocked the sultry main,<br />
			Like April hoar-frost spread;<br />
			But where the ship's huge shadow lay,<br />
			The charmed water burnt alway<br />
			A still and awful red.
		</p>
		<p>Beyond the shadow of the ship,<br />
			I watched the water-snakes:<br />
			They moved in tracks of shining white,<br />
			And when they reared, the elfish light<br />
			Fell off in hoary flakes.
		</p>
		<p>Within the shadow of the ship<br />
			I watched their rich attire:<br />
			Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,<br />
			They coiled and swam; and every track<br />
			Was a flash of golden fire.
		</p>
		<p>O happy living things! no tongue<br />
			Their beauty might declare:<br />
			A spring of love gushed from my heart,<br />
			And I blessed them unaware:<br />
			Sure my kind saint took pity on me,<br />
			And I blessed them unaware.
		</p>
		<p>The self same moment I could pray;<br />
			And from my neck so free<br />
			The Albatross fell off, and sank<br />
			Like lead into the sea.
