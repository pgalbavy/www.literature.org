<p> IT was written that there, in the nursery of our navigating
ancestors, I should learn to walk in the ways of my craft and
grow in the love of the sea, blind as young love often is, but
absorbing and disinterested as all true love must be.  I demanded
nothing from it—not even adventure.  In this I showed, perhaps,
more intuitive wisdom than high self-denial.  No adventure ever
came to one for the asking.  He who starts on a deliberate quest
of adventure goes forth but to gather dead-sea fruit, unless,
indeed, he be beloved of the gods and great amongst heroes, like
that most excellent cavalier Don Quixote de la Mancha.  By us
ordinary mortals of a mediocre animus that is only too anxious
to pass by wicked giants for so many honest windmills, adventures
are entertained like visiting angels.  They come upon our complacency
unawares.  As unbidden guests are apt to do, they often come at
inconvenient times.  And we are glad to let them go unrecognised,
without any acknowledgment of so high a favour. After many years,
on looking back from the middle turn of life’s way at the events
of the past, which, like a friendly crowd, seem to gaze sadly
after us hastening towards the Cimmerian shore, we may see here
and there, in the gray throng, some figure glowing with a faint
radiance, as though it had caught all the light of our already
crepuscular sky.  And by this glow we may recognise the faces
of our true adventures, of the once unbidden guests entertained
unawares in our young days.</p>

<p>If the Mediterranean, the venerable (and sometimes atrociously
ill-tempered) nurse of all navigators, was to rock my youth, the
providing of the cradle necessary for that operation was entrusted
by Fate to the most casual assemblage of irresponsible young men
(all, however, older than myself) that, as if drunk with Provençal
sunshine, frittered life away in joyous levity on the model of
Balzac’s "Histoire des Treize" qualified by a dash of romance
<em>de cape et d’épée</em>.</p>

<p>She who was my cradle in those years had been built on the River
of Savona by a famous builder of boats, was rigged in Corsica
by another good man, and was described on her papers as a ‘tartane’
of sixty tons. In reality, she was a true balancelle, with two
short masts raking forward and two curved yards, each as long
as her hull; a true child of the Latin lake, with a spread of
two enormous sails resembling the pointed wings on a sea-bird’s
slender body, and herself, like a bird indeed, skimming rather
than sailing the seas.</p>

<p>Her name was the <em>Tremolino</em>.  How is this to be translated? 
The <em>Quiverer</em>?  What a name to give the pluckiest little
craft that ever dipped her sides in angry foam!  I had felt her,
it is true, trembling for nights and days together under my feet,
but it was with the high-strung tenseness of her faithful courage. 
In her short, but brilliant, career she has taught me nothing,
but she has given me everything.  I owe to her the awakened love
for the sea that, with the quivering of her swift little body
and the humming of the wind under the foot of her lateen sails,
stole into my heart with a sort of gentle violence, and brought
my imagination under its despotic sway.  The <em>Tremolino</em>! 
To this day I cannot utter or even write that name without a strange
tightening of the breast and the gasp of mingled delight and dread
of one’s first passionate experience.</p>
