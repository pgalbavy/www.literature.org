<p>Betty walked much alone upon the marshes with Roland at her side. At
intervals she heard from Mr. Penzance, but his notes were necessarily
brief, and at other times she could only rely upon report for news
of what was occurring at Mount Dunstan. Lord Mount Dunstan's almost
military supervision of and command over his villagers had certainly
saved them from the horrors of an uncontrollable epidemic; his decision
and energy had filled the alarmed Guardians with respect and this
respect had begun to be shared by many other persons. A man as prompt in
action, and as faithful to such responsibilities as many men might
have found plausible reasons enough for shirking, inevitably assumed a
certain dignity of aspect, when all was said and done. Lord Dunholm was
most clear in his expressions of opinion concerning him. Lady Alanby
of Dole made a practice of speaking of him in public frequently, always
with admiring approval, and in that final manner of hers, to whose
authority her neighbours had so long submitted. It began to be accepted
as a fact that he was a new development of his race--as her ladyship had
put it, “A new order of Mount Dunstan.”
</p><p>The story of his power over the stricken people, and of their passionate
affection and admiration for him, was one likely to spread far, and be
immensely popular. The drama of certain incidents appealed greatly
to the rustic mind, and by cottage firesides he was represented with
rapturous awe, as raising men, women, and children from the dead, by the
mere miracle of touch. Mrs. Welden and old Doby revelled in thrilling,
almost Biblical, versions of current anecdotes, when Betty paid her
visits to them.
</p><p>“It's like the Scripture, wot he done for that young man as the last
breath had gone out of him, an' him lyin' stiffening fast. 'Young man,
arise,' he says. 'The Lord Almighty calls. You've got a young wife an'
three children to take care of. Take up your bed an' walk.' Not as he
wanted him to carry his bed anywheres, but it was a manner of speaking.
An' up the young man got. An' a sensible way,” said old Mrs. Welden
frankly, “for the Lord to look at it--for I must say, miss, if I was
struck down for it, though I s'pose it's only my sinful ignorance--that
there's times when the Lord seems to think no more of sweepin' away a
steady eighteen-shillin' a week, and p'raps seven in family, an' one at
the breast, an' another on the way--than if it was nothin'. But likely
enough, eighteen shillin' a week an' confinements does seem paltry to
the Maker of 'eaven an' earth.”
</p><p>But, to the girl walking over the marshland, the humanness of the things
she heard gave to her the sense of nearness--of being almost within
sight and sound--which Mount Dunstan himself had felt, when each day
was filled with the result of her thought of the needs of the poor souls
thrown by fate into his hands. In these days, after listening to old
Mrs. Welden's anecdotes, through which she gathered the simpler truth
of things, Betty was able to construct for herself a less Scriptural
version of what she had heard. She was glad--glad in his sitting by
a bedside and holding a hand which lay in his hot or cold, but always
trusting to something which his strong body and strong soul gave without
stint. There would be no restraint there. Yes, he was kind--kind--kind
--with the kindness a woman loves, and which she, of all women, loved
most. Sometimes she would sit upon some mound, and, while her eyes
seemed to rest on the yellowing marsh and its birds and pools, they saw
other things, and their colour grew deep and dark as the marsh water
between the rushes.
</p><p>The time was pressing when a change in her life must come. She
frequently asked herself if what she saw in Nigel Anstruthers' face was
the normal thinking of a sane man, which he himself could control. There
had been moments when she had seriously doubted it. He was haggard,
aging and restless. Sometimes he--always as if by chance--followed her
as she went from one room to another, and would seat himself and fix
his miserable eyes upon her for so long a time that it seemed he must
be unconscious of what he was doing. Then he would appear suddenly to
recollect himself and would start up with a muttered exclamation, and
stalk out of the room. He spent long hours riding or driving alone about
the country or wandering wretchedly through the Park and gardens. Once
he went up to town, and, after a few days' absence, came back looking
more haggard than before, and wearing a hunted look in his eyes. He had
gone to see a physician, and, after having seen him, he had tried to
lose himself in a plunge into deep and turbid enough waters; but he
found that he had even lost the taste of high flavours, for which he
had once had an epicurean palate. The effort had ended in his being
overpowered again by his horrors--the horrors in which he found himself
staring at that end of things when no pleasure had spice, no debauchery
the sting of life, and men, such as he, stood upon the shore of time
shuddering and naked souls, watching the great tide, bearing its
treasures, recede forever, and leave them to the cold and hideous dark.
During one day of his stay in town he had seen Teresita, who had at
first stared half frightened by the change she saw in him, and then had
told him truths he could have wrung her neck for putting into words.
</p><p>“You look an old man,” she said, with the foreign accent he had once
found deliciously amusing, but which now seemed to add a sting. “And
somesing is eating you op. You are mad in lofe with some beautiful one
who will not look at you. I haf seen it in mans before. It is she who
eats you op--your evil thinkings of her. It serve you right. Your eyes
look mad.”
</p><p>He himself, at times, suspected that they did, and cursed himself
because he could not keep cool. It was part of his horrors that he knew
his internal furies were worse than folly, and yet he could not restrain
them. The creeping suspicion that this was only the result of the simple
fact that he had never tried to restrain any tendency of his own was
maddening. His nervous system was a wreck. He drank a great deal of
whisky to keep himself “straight” during the day, and he rose many times
during his black waking hours in the night to drink more because he
obstinately refused to give up the hope that, if he drank enough, it
would make him sleep. As through the thoughts of Mount Dunstan, who was
a clean and healthy human being, there ran one thread which would not
disentangle itself, so there ran through his unwholesome thinking a
thread which burned like fire. His secret ravings would not have been
good to hear. His passion was more than half hatred, and a desire for
vengeance, for the chance to re-assert his own power, to prove himself
master, to get the better in one way or another of this arrogant young
outsider and her high-handed pride. The condition of his mind was so far
from normal that he failed to see that the things he said to himself,
the plans he laid, were grotesque in their folly. The old cruel
dominance of the man over the woman thing, which had seemed the mere
natural working of the law among men of his race in centuries past, was
awake in him, amid the limitations of modern days.
</p><p>“My God,” he said to himself more than once, “I would like to have
had her in my hands a few hundred years ago. Women were kept in their
places, then.”
</p><p>He was even frenzied enough to think over what he would have done, if
such a thing had been--of her utter helplessness against that which
raged in him--of the grey thickness of the walls where he might
have held and wrought his will upon her--insult, torment, death. His
alcohol-excited brain ran riot--but, when it did its foolish worst, he
was baffled by one thing.
</p><p>“Damn her!” he found himself crying out. “If I had hung her up and
cut her into strips she would have died staring at me with her big
eyes--without uttering a sound.”
</p><p>There was a long reach between his imaginings and the time he lived
in. America had not been discovered in those decent days, and now a
man could not beat even his own wife, or spend her money, without being
meddled with by fools. He was thinking of a New York young woman of the
nineteenth century who could actually do as she hanged pleased, and who
pleased to be damned high and mighty. For that reason in itself it was
incumbent upon a man to get even with her in one way or another. High
and mightiness was not the hardest thing to reach. It offered a good
aim.
</p><p>His temper when he returned to Stornham was of the order which in past
years had set Rosalie and her child shuddering and had sent the servants
about the house with pale or sullen faces. Betty's presence had the
odd effect of restraining him, and he even told her so with sneering
resentment.
</p><p>“There would be the devil to pay if you were not here,” he said. “You
keep me in order, by Jove! I can't work up steam properly when you watch
me.”
</p><p>He himself knew that it was likely that some change would take place.
She would not stay at Stornham and she would not leave his wife and
child alone with him again. It would be like her to hold her tongue
until she was ready with her infernal plans and could spring them on
him. Her letters to her father had probably prepared him for such action
as such a man would be likely to take. He could guess what it would be.
They were free and easy enough in America in their dealings with the
marriage tie. Their idea would doubtless be a divorce with custody of
the child. He wondered a little that they had remained quiet so long.
There had been American shrewdness in her coming boldly to Stornham to
look over the ground herself and actually set the place in order. It did
not present itself to his mind that what she had done had been no part
of a scheme, but the mere result of her temperament and training. He
told himself that it had been planned beforehand and carried out in
hard-headed commercial American fashion as a matter of business. The
thing which most enraged him was the implied cool, practical realisation
of the fact that he, as inheritor of an entailed estate, was but owner
in charge, and not young enough to be regarded as an insurmountable
obstacle to their plans. He could not undo the greater part of what had
been done, and they were calculating, he argued, that his would not be
likely to be a long life, and if--if anything happened--Stornham would
be Ughtred's and the whole vulgar lot of them would come over and take
possession and swagger about the place as if they had been born on it.
As to divorce or separation--if they took that line, he would at least
give them a good run for their money. They would wish they had let
sleeping dogs lie before the thing was over. The right kind of lawyer
could bully Rosalie into saying anything he chose on the witness-stand.
There was not much limit to the evidence a man could bring if he was
experienced enough to be circumstantial, and knew whom he was dealing
with. The very fact that the little fool could be made to appear to have
been so sly and sanctimonious would stir the gall of any jury of men.
His own condoning the matter for the sake of his sensitive boy, deformed
by his mother's unrestrained and violent hysteria before his birth,
would go a long way. Let them get their divorce, they would have paid
for it, the whole lot of them, the beautiful Miss Vanderpoel and
all. Such a story as the newspapers would revel in would not be
a recommendation to Englishmen of unsmirched reputation. Then his
exultation would suddenly drop as his mental excitement produced its
effect of inevitable physical fatigue. Even if he made them pay for
getting their own way, what would happen to himself afterwards? No
morbid vanity of self-bolstering could make the outlook anything
but unpromising. If he had not had such diabolical luck in his few
investments he could have lived his own life. As it was, old Vanderpoel
would possibly condescend to make him some insufficient allowance
because Rosalie would wish that it might be done, and he would be
expected to drag out to the end the kind of life a man pensioned by his
wife's relatives inevitably does. If he attempted to live in the country
he should blow out his brains. When his depression was at its worst, he
saw himself aging and shabby, rambling about from one cheap Continental
town to another, blackballed by good clubs, cold-shouldered even by the
Teresitas, cut off from society by his limited means and the stories
his wife's friends would spread. He ground his teeth when he thought
of Betty. Her splendid vitality had done something to life for him--had
given it savour. When he had come upon her in the avenue his blood had
stirred, even though it had been maliciously, and there had been spice
in his very resentment of her presence. And she would go away. He would
not be likely to see her again if his wife broke with him; she would be
swept out of his days. It was hideous to think of, and his rage would
overpower him and his nerves go to pieces again.
</p><p>“What are you going to do?” he broke forth suddenly one evening, when
he found himself temporarily alone with her. “You are going to do
something. I see it in your eyes.”
</p><p>He had been for some time watching her from behind his newspaper, while
she, with an unread book upon her lap, had, in fact, been thinking
deeply and putting to herself serious questions.
</p><p>Her answer made him stir rather uncomfortably.
</p><p>“I am going to write to my father to ask him to come to England.”
</p><p>So this was what she had been preparing to spring upon him. He laughed
insolently.
</p><p>“To ask him to come here?”
</p><p>“With your permission.”
</p><p>“With mine? Does an American father-in-law wait for permission?”
</p><p>“Is there any practical reason why you should prefer that he should NOT
come?”
</p><p>He left his seat and walked over to her.
</p><p>“Yes. Your sending for him is a declaration of war.”
</p><p>“It need not be so. Why should it?”
</p><p>“In this case I happen to be aware that it is. The choice is your own, I
suppose,” with ready bravado, “that you and he are prepared to face the
consequences. But is Rosalie, and is your mother?”
</p><p>“My father is a business man and will know what can be done. He will
know what is worth doing,” she answered, without noticing his
question. “But,” she added the words slowly, “I have been making up
my mind--before I write to him--to say something to you--to ask you a
question.”
</p><p>He made a mock sentimental gesture.
</p><p>“To ask me to spare my wife, to 'remember that she is the mother of my
child'?”
</p><p>She passed over that also.
</p><p>“To ask you if there is no possible way in which all this unhappiness
can be ended decently.”
</p><p>“The only decent way of ending it would be that there should be no
further interference. Let Rosalie supply the decency by showing me the
consideration due from a wife to her husband. The place has been put in
order. It was not for my benefit, and I have no money to keep it up. Let
Rosalie be provided with means to do it.”
</p><p>As he spoke the words he realised that he had opened a way for
embarrassing comment. He expected her to remind him that Rosalie had not
come to him without money. But she said nothing about the matter. She
never said the things he expected to hear.
</p><p>“You do not want Rosalie for your wife,” she went on “but you could
treat her courteously without loving her. You could allow her the
privileges other men's wives are allowed. You need not separate her from
her family. You could allow her father and mother to come to her and
leave her free to go to them sometimes. Will you not agree to that? Will
you not let her live peaceably in her own simple way? She is very gentle
and humble and would ask nothing more.”
</p><p>“She is a fool!” he exclaimed furiously. “A fool! She will stay where
she is and do as I tell her.”
</p><p>“You knew what she was when you married her. She was simple and girlish
and pretended to be nothing she was not. You chose to marry her and take
her from the people who loved her. You broke her spirit and her heart.
You would have killed her if I had not come in time to prevent it.”
</p><p>“I will kill her yet if you leave her,” his folly made him say.
</p><p>“You are talking like a feudal lord holding the power of life and death
in his hands,” she said. “Power like that is ancient history. You can
hurt no one who has friends--without being punished.”
</p><p>It was the old story. She filled him with the desire to shake or disturb
her at any cost, and he did his utmost. If she was proposing to make
terms with him, he would show her whether he would accept them or not.
He let her hear all he had said to himself in his worst moments--all
that he had argued concerning what she and her people would do, and
what his own actions would be--all his intention to make them pay the
uttermost farthing in humiliation if he could not frustrate them.
His methods would be definite enough. He had not watched his wife and
Ffolliott for weeks to no end. He had known what he was dealing with. He
had put other people upon the track and they would testify for him. He
poured forth unspeakable statements and intimations, going, as usual,
further than he had known he should go when he began. Under the spur of
excitement his imagination served him well. At last he paused.
</p><p>“Well,” he put it to her, “what have you to say?”
</p><p>“I?” with the remote intent curiosity growing in her eyes. “I have
nothing to say. I am leaving you to say things.”
</p><p>“You will, of course, try to deny----” he insisted.
</p><p>“No, I shall not. Why should I?”
</p><p>“You may assume your air of magnificence, but I am dealing with
uncomfortable factors.” He stopped in spite of himself, and then burst
forth in a new order of rage. “You are trying some confounded experiment
on me. What is it?”
</p><p>She rose from her chair to go out of the room, and stood a moment
holding her book half open in her hand.
</p><p>“Yes. I suppose it might be called an experiment,” was her answer.
“Perhaps it was a mistake. I wanted to make quite sure of something.”
</p><p>“Of what?”
</p><p>“I did not want to leave anything undone. I did not want to believe that
any man could exist who had not one touch of decent feeling to redeem
him. It did not seem human.”
</p><p>White dints showed themselves about his nostrils.
</p><p>“Well, you have found one,” he cried. “You have a lashing tongue, by
God, when you choose to let it go. But I could teach you a good many
things, my girl. And before I have done you will have learned most of
them.”
</p><p>But though he threw himself into a chair and laughed aloud as she left
him, he knew that his arrogance and bullying were proving poor weapons,
though they had done him good service all his life. And he knew, too,
that it was mere simple truth that, as a result of the intellectual,
ethical vagaries he scathingly derided--she had actually been giving him
a sort of chance to retrieve himself, and that if he had been another
sort of man he might have taken it.
