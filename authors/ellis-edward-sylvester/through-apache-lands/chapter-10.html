<p>Lone Wolf spoke English like a native; and, having waited until
the admiration of Ned Chadmund had been given time to expend itself,
he spoke in a deep, guttural voice:</p>

<p>"Does the child of my white brother mourn for those who have
fallen?"</p>

<p>The lad was so surprised at hearing himself addressed in this
manner, that he stared wonderingly at him for a moment without
making reply. Then he rose to his feet, and, looking up in the
painted face, replied:</p>

<p>"I am all alone, and long to go to my father."</p>

<p>"What is the name of your father?" asked the chief, in the same
excellent English.</p>

<p>"Colonel Edward Chadmund."</p>

<p>"Is he at the fort, yonder?" continued Lone Wolf, stretching
out his hand so as to point toward the southwest.</p>

<p>"Yes; he is the commandant there, and has a large number of brave
soldiers, and will send them out to take me to him."</p>

<p>Had Ned been a few years older, he would not have made this reply.
It was not politic to threaten the chief; and he had no suspicion
that the confession of the identity of his father only intensified
the hatred of these redskins before him. But perhaps, after all,
it was as well; for Lone Wolf was sagacious enough to recollect
that he was talking to a child, from whom he was more likely to
hear truth than from an older person.</p>

<p>"He has sent some brave soldiers to take you to him," said the
chief, with a wolf-like grin, displaying his long, yellow teeth.
"But they have left you on the way; they have given you to Lone
Wolf, and they will not go back to the fort, nor to Santa Fe.
If he sends more, they will do the same."</p>

<p>"There were only a dozen of them, while you had hundreds. If
they had had anything like an equal chance, not one of the Apaches
would have been left alive! We would have killed them all!"</p>

<p>This was a brave answer, in a certain sense, but it was not a
very prudent one; for Lone Wolf was known to be the possessor
of a fearful temper, easily excited into a tempest of passion;
and the words of the boy were not calculated to be very soothing
to him. There was too much paint upon the face of the chieftain
for the boy to observe the flush which overspread it at hearing
himself addressed in this manner, but he could understand the
lowering of that gruff voice and the quickening of the utterance.</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf and his brave Apaches care nothing for the soldiers
of the Father at Washington. His agents deceive us; they make
treaties and do not keep them; they lie to us, and then we turn
upon and rend them. Do you see that?"</p>

<p>As he uttered this inquiry in the fiercest kind of language,
he whipped out from beneath his blanket the reeking scalp of one
of the soldiers that had fallen in the gorge a short time before,
and shook it in the face of the terrified lad. The latter could
not fail to see what it was, and drew back in horror and disgust,
realizing what a bloodthirsty monster stood before him. He saw
that it would never do to excite the other's anger, and he endeavored
to turn the conversation into another channel.</p>

<p>"Do you and your brave warriors mean to stay here till morning?"</p>

<p>"It is as Lone Wolf wills," was the instant answer, in a voice
not quite so severe, indicating a subsidence of the troubled waters.</p>

<p>"And what are you going to do with me?" was the next question,
which no one besides a lad of Ned's age would have dared to put,
when placed in a similar position.</p>

<p>"That, too, is as Lone Wolf wills," was the rather non-committal
answer.</p>

<p>"And that is the reason why I asked you. How soon can I return
to my father? When I reach him I will tell him that it was Lone
Wolf that sent me back and he will be friendly toward him."</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf asks not his friendship," said the chieftain, with
something of the old fire gleaming in his eye. "He has killed
our bravest and best warriors. He has followed them to the mountains
and slain them by their camp fires, when they dreamed not that
the white man was near. He has murdered their squaws; and Lone
Wolf shall not die until he tears his scalp from his head."</p>

<p>The poor boy was horrified. He was too young to understand fully
the causes of such deep enmity upon the part of the chieftain,
but he was not too young to understand that his own life had been
spared through no sentiment of mercy. The leader had some other
cause, but Ned did not see much hope of making a favorable impression
upon this intractable chief, and he would have been very much
relieved had he taken himself off and left him alone.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes had passed since the lad had opened his
eyes upon the strange scene by which he was surrounded, and the
preparations which seemed to be going on were completed. The entire
Apache troop suddenly broke out in a series of whoops and yells
that would have appalled a hundred famishing wolves. At the same
instant they began dancing&mdash;not a motion of the feet, such as
we are accustomed to see in civilized regions, but a series of
demoniac gymnastics, risking the dislocation of all the bones
in their bodies. They leaped up and down, swung their arms, threw
out their legs, and circled around each other&mdash;the whole forming
a wild and appalling revelry more like that of wild beasts than
of human beings.</p>

<p>Boy-like, Ned Chadmund forgot everything else for the time but
the scene which was passing directly before his eyes. There was
a weird attraction in watching the flitting, fantastic figures,
whose hands were yet reeking with the blood of innocent men and
whose greatest delight would have been to scalp every man, woman
and child in the territory.</p>

<p>This hullaballoo lasted all of half an hour, when it died out
as suddenly as it began. It was not from exhaustion, for Indians
have been known to keep up such a performance through the entire
night; but it was in obedience to a signal from Lone Wolf, whose
imperious will no one dared defy. He had simply raised his arm,
and, giving utterance to a single whoop that rose above the horrid
din, silence "fell like a blessing." This lasted but a few minutes,
when the bustle began in a lesser degree, and the Apaches fell
to eating the meat which had been abundantly prepared for them
by several of their number. They continued to act like wolves
as they did so, using hands and knives, but more frequently tearing
the meat to shreds without the aid of any implements except such
as nature had furnished them in the shape of teeth.</p>

<p>The terrific strain, mental and physical, which Ned had undergone
during the last few hours, was succeeded by a reaction which made
him feel weak and faint. He was conscious of the need of food,
and was feverish and thirsty.</p>

<p>"I don't see as I'm likely to get anything to eat," he muttered,
as he sat down on the blanket, and looked upon the glittering
scene. "I ain't so very hungry, but I would like a good drink
of water."</p>

<p>The firelight shone upon the small stream which ran through the
middle of the valley; and, as it was so near at hand, he thought
there would be no harm in walking to it, and helping himself to
a refreshing draught. He had walked but a few steps, however,
when he became aware that some one was following him. A careless
glance over his shoulder showed that it was Lone Wolf. The lad
concluded at once that he suspected an attempt at escape, and
he thought he might do himself some good by a faithful return
to his former position after he had helped himself to a drink,
without appearing to notice that he was watched. This was the
more easy of accomplishment, as the Apache moved off to one side,
as if his desire was to conceal his real purpose. Accordingly,
Ned walked quietly forward until he reached the stream, where
he knelt down and took one long, refreshing drink, which seemed
to give him new life and strength. Then, rising to his feet, he
started back to the camp fire. As he did so, he found himself
face to face with Lone Wolf.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the latter, gruffly.</p>

<p>"I was thirsty and went to get a drink. I thought I would not
bother you."</p>

<p>"When you try to run away, then you will die!"</p>

<p>"What's the use of trying to run off, when there isn't any show?"
asked the young prisoner, with a laugh, an assumption of jollity
which was far from genuine.</p>
