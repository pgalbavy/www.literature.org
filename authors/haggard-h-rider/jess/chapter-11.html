<p>For a few weeks after John Niel’s adventure at the shooting-party no
event of any importance occurred at Mooifontein. Day followed day in
charming monotony, for, whatever “gay worldlings” may think, monotony
is as full of charm as a dreamy summer afternoon. “Happy is the country
that has no history,” says the voice of wisdom, and the same remark
maybe made with even more truth of the individual. To get up in the
morning conscious of health and strength, to pursue the common round and
daily task till evening comes, and finally to go to bed pleasantly tired
and sleep the sleep of the just, is the true secret of happiness. Fierce
excitements, excursions, and alarms do not conduce either to mental or
physical well-being, and it is for this reason that we find that those
whose lives have been chiefly concerned with them crave the most after
the quiet round of domestic life. When they get it, often, it is true,
they pant for the ardours of the fray whereof the dim and distant sounds
are echoing through the spaces of their heart, in the same way that the
countries without a history are sometimes anxious to write one in their
own blood. But that is a principle of Nature, who will allow of no
standing still among her subjects, and who has ordained that strife of
one sort or another shall be the absolute condition of existence.
</p><p>On the whole, John found that the life of a South African farmer came
well up to his expectations. He had ample occupation; indeed, what
between ostriches, horses, cattle, sheep, and crops, he was rather over
than under occupied. Nor was he much troubled by the lack of civilised
society, for he was a man who read a great deal, and books could be
ordered from Durban and Cape Town, while the weekly mail brought with it
a sufficient supply of papers. On Sundays he always read the political
articles in the “Saturday Review” aloud to Silas Croft, who, as he grew
older, found that the print tried his eyes, an attention which the
old man greatly appreciated. Silas was a well-informed man, and
notwithstanding his long life spent in a half-civilised country, had
never lost his hold of affairs or his interest in the wide and rushing
life of the world in one of whose side eddies he lived apart. This
task of reading the “Saturday Review” aloud had formerly been a part
of Bessie’s Sunday service, but her uncle was very glad to effect an
exchange. Bessie’s mind was not quite in tune with the profundities of
that learned journal, and her attention was apt to wonder at the most
pointed passages.
</p><p>Thus it came about, what between the “Saturday Review” and other things,
that a very warm and deep attachment sprang up twixt the old man and his
younger partner. John was a taking man, especially to the aged, for whom
he was never tired of performing little services. One of his favourite
sayings was that old people should be “let down easy,” and he acted up
to it. Moreover, there was a quiet jollity and a bluff honesty about him
which was undoubtedly attractive both to men and women. Above all, he
was a well-informed, experienced man, and a gentleman, in a country in
which both were rare. Each week Silas Croft came to rely more and more
on him, and allowed things to pass more and more into his hands.
</p><p>“I’m getting old, Niel,” he said to him one night; “I’m getting very
old; the grasshopper is becoming a burden to me: and I’ll tell you what
it is, my boy,” laying his hand affectionately upon John’s shoulder, “I
have no son of my own, and you must be a son to me, as my dear Bessie
has been a daughter.”
</p><p>John looked up into the kindly, handsome face, crowned with its
fringe of snowy hair, and at the keen eyes set deep in it beneath the
overhanging brows, and thought of his old father who was long since
dead; and somehow he was moved, and his own eyes filled with tears.
</p><p>“Ay, Mr. Croft,” he said, taking the old man’s hand, “that I will to the
best of my ability.”
</p><p>“Thank you, my boy, thank you. I don’t like talking much about these
things, but, as I said, I am getting old, and the Almighty may require
my account any hour, and if He does I rely on you to look after these
two girls. It is a wild country this, and one never knows what will
happen in it from day to day, and they may want help. Sometimes I wish
I were clear of the place. And now I’m going to bed. I am beginning to
feel as though I had done my day’s work in the world. I’m getting feeble
John, this is the fact of it.”
</p><p>After that he always called him John.
</p><p>Of Jess they heard but little. She wrote every week, it is true, and
gave an accurate account of all that was going on at Pretoria and of
her daily doings, but she was one of those people whose letters tell one
absolutely nothing of themselves and of what is passing in their minds.
They ought to have been headed “Our Pretoria Letter,” as Bessie said
disgustedly after reading through three sheets in Jess’s curious,
upright handwriting. “Once you lose sight of Jess,” she went on, “she
might as well be dead for all you learn about her. Not that one learns
very much when she is here,” she added reflectively.
</p><p>“She is a peculiar woman,” said John thoughtfully. At first he had
missed her very much, for, strange as she undoubtedly was, she had
touched a new string in him, of the existence of which he had not till
then been himself aware. And what is more, it had answered strongly
enough for some time; but now it was slowly vibrating itself into
silence again, much as a harp does when the striker takes his fingers
from the strings. Had she stayed on another week or so the effect might
have been more enduring.
</p><p>But although Jess had gone away Bessie had not. On the contrary, she was
always about him, surrounding him with that tender care a woman, however
involuntarily, cannot prevent herself from lavishing on the man she
loves. Her beauty moved about the place like a beam of light about a
garden, for she was indeed a lovely woman, and as pure and good as she
was lovely. Nor could John long remain in ignorance of her liking for
himself. He was not a vain man--very much the reverse, indeed--but
neither was he a fool. And it must be said that, though Bessie never
overstepped the bounds of maidenly reserve, neither did she take
particular pains to hide her preference. Indeed, it was too strong
to permit her so to do. Not that she was animated by the half-divine,
soul-searing breath of passion, such as animated her sister, which is a
very rare thing, and, take it altogether, as undesirable and unsuitable
to the ordinary conditions of this prosaic and work-a-day life as it
is rare. But she was tenderly and truly in love after the usual
young-womanly fashion; indeed, her passion, measured by the everyday
standard, would have proved to be a deep one. However this might be, she
was undoubtedly prepared to make John Niel a faithful and loving wife if
he chose to ask her to marry him.
</p><p>And as the weeks went on--though, of course, he knew nothing of all
this--it became a very serious question to John whether he should not
ask her. It is not good for a man to live alone, especially in the
Transvaal, and it was not possible for him to pass day by day at the
side of so much beauty and so much grace without thinking that it
would be well to draw the bond of union closer. Indeed, had John been
a younger man of less experience, he would have succumbed to the
temptation much sooner than he did. But he was neither very young nor
very inexperienced. Ten years or more ago, in his green and gushing
youth, as has been said, he had burnt his fingers to the bone, and a
lively recollection of this incident in his career heretofore had proved
a very efficient warning. Also, he had reached that period of life when
men think a great many times before they commit themselves wildly to the
deep matrimonial waters. At three-and-twenty, for the sake of a pretty
face, most of us are willing to undertake the serious and in many
cases overwhelming burdens, risks, and cares of family life, and the
responsibility of the parentage of a large and healthy brood, but at
three-and-thirty we take a different view of the matter. The temptation
may be great, but the per contra list is so very alarming, and we
never know even then if we see all the liabilities. Such are the
black thoughts that move in the breasts of selfish men, to the great
disadvantage of the marriage market; and however it may lower John Niel
in the eyes of those who take the trouble to follow this portion of his
life’s history, in the interests of truth it must be confessed that he
was not free from them.
</p><p>In short, sweet and pretty as Bessie might be, he was not violently in
love with her; and at thirty-four a man must be violently in love to
rush into the near risk of matrimony. But, however commendably
cautious that man may be, he is always liable to fall into temptation
sufficiently strong to sweep away his caution and make a mockery of his
plans. However strong the rope, it has its breaking strain; and in the
same way our power of resistance to any given course depends entirely
upon the power of the temptation to draw us into it. Thus it was
destined to be with our friend John Niel.
</p><p>It was about a week after his conversation with old Silas Croft that it
occurred to John that Bessie’s manner had grown rather strange of late.
It seemed to him that she had avoided his society instead of showing a
certain partiality for it, if not of courting it. Also, she had looked
pale and worried, and evinced a tendency to irritation that was quite
foreign to her natural sweetness of character. Now, when a person on
whom one is accustomed to depend for most of that social intercourse
and those pleasant little amenities which members of one sex value from
another, suddenly cuts off the supply without any apparent rhyme or
reason, it is enough to induce a feeling of wonder, not to say of
vexation, in the breast. It never occurred to John that the reason
might be that Bessie was truly fond of him, and perhaps unconsciously
disappointed that he did not show a warmer interest in her. If, however,
we were to examine into the facts of the case we should probably
discover that here was the real explanation of this change. Bessie was
a straightforward young person, whose mind and purposes were as clear
as running water. She was vexed with John--though she would probably not
have owned it even to herself in so many words--and her manner reflected
the condition of her mind.
</p><p>“Bessie,” said John one lovely day, just as the afternoon was merging
into evening, “Bessie”--he always called her Bessie now--“I am going
down to the black wattle plantation by the big mealie patch. I want to
see how those young trees are doing. If you have done your cooking”--for
she had been engaged in making a cake, as young ladies, to their souls’
health, often have to do in the Colonies--“I wish you would put on your
hat and come with me. I don’t believe that you have been out to-day.”
</p><p>“Thank you, Captain Niel, I don’t think that I want to come out.”
</p><p>“Why not?” he said.
</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know--because there is too much to do. If I go out that
stupid girl will burn the cake,” and she pointed to a Kafir <u>intombi</u>
(young girl), who, arrayed in a blue smock, a sweet smile, and a feather
stuck in her wool, was vigorously employed in staring at the flies on
the ceiling and sucking her black fingers. “Really,” she added with a
little stamp, “one needs the patience of an angel to put up with that
idiot’s stupidity. Yesterday she smashed the biggest dinner-dish and
then brought me the pieces with a broad grin on her face and asked me
to ‘make them one’ again. The white people were so clever, she said, it
would be no trouble to me. If they could make the china plate once, and
could cause flowers to grow on it, it would surely be easy to make it
whole again. I did not know whether to laugh or cry or throw the pieces
at her.”
</p><p>“Look here, young woman,” said John, taking the sinning girl by the arm
and leading her solemnly to the oven, which was opened to receive the
cake; “look here, if you let that cake burn while the <u>inkosikaas</u> (lady
chieftain) is away, when I come back I will cram you into the oven to
burn with it. I cooked a girl like that in Natal last year, and when she
came out she was quite white!”
</p><p>Bessie translated this fiendish threat, whereat the girl grinned from
ear to ear and murmured “<u>Koos</u>” (chief) in cheerful acquiescence. A
Kafir maid on a pleasant afternoon is not troubled by the prospect of
being baked at nightfall, which is a long way off, especially when it is
John Niel who threatened the baking. The natives about Mooifontein had
taken the measure of John’s foot by this time with accuracy. His threats
were awful, but his performances were not great. Once, indeed, he was
forced to engage in a stand-up fight with a great fellow who thought
that he could be taken advantage of on this account, but after he had
succeeded in administering a sound hiding to that champion he was never
again troubled in this respect.
</p><p>“Now,” he said, “I think we have provided for the safety of your cake,
so come on.”
</p><p>“Thank you, Captain Niel,” answered Bessie, looking at him in a
bewitching little way she well knew how to assume, “thank you, but I
think I had rather not go out walking.” This was what she said, but her
eyes added, “I am offended with you; I want to have nothing to do with
you.”
</p><p>“Very well,” said John; “then I suppose I must go alone,” and he took up
his hat with the air of a martyr.
</p><p>Bessie looked through the open kitchen door at the lights and shadows
that chased each other across the swelling bosom of the hill behind the
house.
</p><p>“It certainly is very fine,” she said; “are you going far?”
</p><p>“No, only round the plantation.”
</p><p>“There are so many puff-adders down there, and I hate snakes,” suggested
Bessie, by way of finding another excuse for not coming.
</p><p>“Oh, I’ll look after the puff-adders--come along.”
</p><p>“Well,” she said at last, as she slowly unrolled her sleeves, which had
been tucked up during the cake-making, and hid her beautiful white
arms, “I will come, not because I want to come, but because you have
over-persuaded me. I don’t know what is happening to me,” she added,
with a little stamp and a sudden filling of her eyes with tears, “I do
not seem to have any will of my own left. When I want to do one thing
and you want me to do another it is I who have to do what you want; and
I tell you I don’t like it, Captain Niel, and I shall be very cross out
walking;” and sweeping past him, on her way to fetch her hat, in that
peculiarly graceful fashion which angry women can sometimes assume, she
left John to reflect that he never saw a more charming or taking lady in
Europe or out of it.
</p><p>He had half a mind to risk it and ask her to marry him. But then,
perhaps, she might refuse him, and that was a contingency which he did
not quite appreciate. After their first youth few men altogether relish
the idea of putting themselves in a position that gives a capricious
woman an opportunity of first figuratively “jumping” on them, and
then perhaps holding them up to the scorn and obloquy of her friends,
relations, and other admirers. For, unfortunately, until the opposite is
clearly demonstrated, many men are apt to believe that not a few women
are by nature capricious, shallow, and unreliable; and John Niel,
owing, possibly, to that unhappy little experience of his youth, must be
reckoned among their misguided ranks.
