<p>The steamer "Santiago," carrying "passengers, bullion, and coffee," was
headed to pass Porto Rico by midnight, when she would be free of land
until she anchored at the quarantine station of the green hills of
Staten Island.  She had not yet shaken off the contamination of the
earth; a soft inland breeze still tantalized her with odors of tree and
soil, the smell of the fresh coat of paint that had followed her
coaling rose from her sides, and the odor of spilt coffee-grains that
hung around the hatches had yet to be blown away by a jealous ocean
breeze, or washed by a welcoming cross sea.
</p><p>The captain stopped at the open entrance of the Social Hall. "If any of
you ladies want to take your last look at Olancho you've got to come
now," he said.  "We'll lose the Valencia light in the next quarter
hour."
</p><p>Miss Langham and King looked up from their novels and smiled, and Miss
Langham shook her head.  "I've taken three final farewells of Olancho
already," she said: "before we went down to dinner, and when the sun
set, and when the moon rose.  I have no more sentiment left to draw on.
Do you want to go?" she asked.
</p><p>"I'm very comfortable, thank you," King said, and returned to the
consideration of his novel.
</p><p>But Clay and Hope arose at the captain's suggestion with suspicious
alacrity, and stepped out upon the empty deck, and into the
encompassing darkness, with a little sigh of relief.
</p><p>Alice Langham looked after them somewhat wistfully and bit the edges of
her book.  She sat for some time with her brows knitted, glancing
occasionally and critically toward King and up with unseeing eyes at
the swinging lamps of the saloon.  He caught her looking at him once
when he raised his eyes as he turned a page, and smiled back at her,
and she nodded pleasantly and bent her head over her reading.  She
assured herself that after all King understood her and she him, and
that if they never rose to certain heights, they never sank below a
high level of mutual esteem, and that perhaps was the best in the end.
</p><p>King had placed his yacht at the disposal of Madame Alvarez, and she
had sailed to Colon, where she could change to the steamers for Lisbon,
while he accompanied the Langhams and the wedding party to New York.
</p><p>Clay recognized that the time had now arrived in his life when he could
graduate from the position of manager-director and become the
engineering expert, and that his services in Olancho were no longer
needed.
</p><p>With Rojas in power Mr. Langham had nothing further to fear from the
Government, and with Kirkland in charge and young Langham returning
after a few months' absence to resume his work, he felt himself free to
enjoy his holiday.
</p><p>They had taken the first steamer out, and the combined efforts of all
had been necessary to prevail upon MacWilliams to accompany them; and
even now the fact that he was to act as Clay's best man and, as Langham
assured him cheerfully, was to wear a frock coat and see his name in
all the papers, brought on such sudden panics of fear that the
fast-fading coast line filled his soul with regret, and a wilful desire
to jump overboard and swim back.
</p><p>Clay and Hope stopped at the door of the chief engineer's cabin and
said they had come to pay him a visit.  The chief had but just come
from the depths where the contamination of the earth was most evident
in the condition of his stokers; but his chin was now cleanly shaven,
and his pipe was drawing as well as his engine fires, and he had
wrapped himself in an old P. &amp; O. white duck jacket to show what he had
been before he sank to the level of a coasting steamer.  They admired
the clerk-like neatness of the report he had just finished, and in
return he promised them the fastest run on record, and showed them the
portrait of his wife, and of their tiny cottage on the Isle of Wight,
and his jade idols from Corea, and carved cocoanut gourds from Brazil,
and a picture from the "Graphic" of Lord Salisbury, tacked to the
partition and looking delightedly down between two highly colored
lithographs of Miss Ellen Terry and the Princess May.
</p><p>Then they called upon the captain, and Clay asked him why captains
always hung so much lace about their beds when they invariably slept on
a red velvet sofa with their boots on, and the captain ordered his
Chinese steward to mix them a queer drink and offered them the choice
of a six months' accumulation of paper novels, and free admittance to
his bridge at all hours. And then they passed on to the door of the
smoking-room and beckoned MacWilliams to come out and join them.  His
manner as he did so bristled with importance, and he drew them eagerly
to the rail.
</p><p>"I've just been having a chat with Captain Burke," he said, in an
undertone.  "He's been telling Langham and me about a new game that's
better than running railroads.  He says there's a country called
Macedonia that's got a native prince who wants to be free from Turkey,
and the Turks won't let him, and Burke says if we'll each put up a
thousand dollars, he'll guarantee to get the prince free in six months.
He's made an estimate of the cost and submitted it to the Russian
Embassy at Washington, and he says they will help him secretly, and he
knows a man who has just patented a new rifle, and who will supply him
with a thousand of them for the sake of the advertisement.  He says
it's a mountainous country, and all you have to do is to stand on the
passes and roll rocks down on the Turks as they come in.  It sounds
easy, doesn't it?"
</p><p>"Then you're thinking of turning professional filibuster yourself?"
said Clay.
</p><p>"Well, I don't know.  It sounds more interesting than engineering.
Burke says I beat him on his last fight, and he'd like to have me with
him in the next one--sort of young-blood-in-the-firm idea--and he
calculates that we can go about setting people free and upsetting
governments for some time to come.  He says there is always something
to fight about if you look for it. And I must say the condition of
those poor Macedonians does appeal to me.  Think of them all alone down
there bullied by that Sultan of Turkey, and wanting to be free and
independent.  That's not right.  You, as an American citizen, ought to
be the last person in the world to throw cold water on an undertaking
like that.  In the name of Liberty now?"
</p><p>"I don't object; set them free, of course," laughed Clay. "But how long
have you entertained this feeling for the enslaved Macedonians, Mac?"
</p><p>"Well, I never heard of them until a quarter of an hour ago, but they
oughtn't to suffer through my ignorance."
</p><p>"Certainly not.  Let me know when you're going to do it, and Hope and I
will run over and look on.  I should like to see you and Burke and the
Prince of Macedonia rolling rocks down on the Turkish Empire."
</p><p>Hope and Clay passed on up the deck laughing, and MacWilliams looked
after them with a fond and paternal smile.  The lamp in the wheelhouse
threw a broad belt of light across the forward deck as they passed
through it into the darkness of the bow, where the lonely lookout
turned and stared at them suspiciously, and then resumed his stern
watch over the great waters.
</p><p>They leaned upon the rail and breathed the soft air which the rush of
the steamer threw in their faces, and studied in silence the stars that
lay so low upon the horizon line that they looked like the harbor
lights of a great city.
</p><p>"Do you see that long line of lamps off our port bow?" asked Clay.
</p><p>Hope nodded.
</p><p>"Those are the electric lights along the ocean drive at Long Branch and
up the Rumson Road, and those two stars a little higher up are fixed to
the mast-heads of the Scotland Lightship. And that mass of light that
you think is the Milky Way, is the glare of the New York street lamps
thrown up against the sky."
</p><p>"Are we so near as that?" said Hope, smiling.  "And what lies over
there?" she asked, pointing to the east.
</p><p>"Over there is the coast of Africa.  Don't you see the lighthouse on
Cape Bon?  If it wasn't for Gibraltar being in the way, I could show
you the harbor lights of Bizerta, and the terraces of Algiers shining
like a caf√© chantant in the night."
</p><p>"Algiers," sighed Hope, "where you were a soldier of Africa, and rode
across the deserts.  Will you take me there?"
</p><p>"There, of course, but to Gibraltar first, where we will drive along
the Alameda by moonlight.  I drove there once coming home from a mess
dinner with the Colonel.  The drive lies between broad white
balustrades, and the moon shone down on us between the leaves of the
Spanish bayonet.  It was like an Italian garden.  But he did not see
it, and he would talk to me about the Watkins range finder on the lower
ramparts, and he puffed on a huge cigar.  I tried to imagine I was
there on my honeymoon, but the end of his cigar would light up and I
would see his white mustache and the glow on his red jacket, so I vowed
I would go over that drive again with the proper person.  And we won't
talk of range finders, will we?
</p><p>"There to the North is Paris; your Paris, and my Paris, with London
only eight hours away.  If you look very closely, you can see the
thousands of hansom cab lamps flashing across the asphalt, and the open
theatres, and the fairy lamps in the gardens back of the houses in
Mayfair, where they are giving dances in your honor, in honor of the
beautiful American bride, whom every one wants to meet.  And you will
wear the finest tiara we can get on Bond Street, but no one will look
at it; they will only look at you.  And I will feel very miserable and
tease you to come home."
</p><p>Hope put her hand in his, and he held her finger-tips to his lips for
an instant and closed his other hand upon hers.
</p><p>"And after that?" asked Hope.
</p><p>"After that we will go to work again, and take long journeys to Mexico
and Peru or wherever they want me, and I will sit in judgment on the
work other chaps have done.  And when we get back to our car at night,
or to the section house, for it will be very rough sometimes,"--Hope
pressed his hand gently in answer,--"I will tell you privately how very
differently your husband would have done it, and you, knowing all about
it, will say that had it been left to me, I would certainly have
accomplished it in a vastly superior manner."
</p><p>"Well, so you would," said Hope, calmly.
</p><p>"That's what I said you'd say," laughed Clay.  "Dearest," he begged,
"promise me something.  Promise me that you are going to be very happy."
</p><p>Hope raised her eyes and looked up at him in silence, and had the man
in the wheelhouse been watching the stars, as he should have been, no
one but the two foolish young people on the bow of the boat would have
known her answer.
</p><p>The ship's bell sounded eight times, and Hope moved slightly.
</p><p>"So late as that," she sighed.  "Come.  We must be going back."
</p><p>A great wave struck the ship's side a friendly slap, and the wind
caught up the spray and tossed it in their eyes, and blew a strand of
her hair loose so that it fell across Clay's face, and they laughed
happily together as she drew it back and he took her hand again to
steady her progress across the slanting deck.
</p><p>As they passed hand in hand out of the shadow into the light from the
wheelhouse, the lookout in the bow counted the strokes of the bell to
himself, and then turned and shouted back his measured cry to the
bridge above them.  His voice seemed to be a part of the murmuring sea
and the welcoming winds.
</p><p>"Listen," said Clay.
</p><p>"Eight bells," the voice sang from the darkness.  "The for'ard light's
shining bright--and all's well."
