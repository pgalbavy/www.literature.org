<p>"Cherry! Cherry Greenfield!" called Peace, imperatively, flapping
a newspaper vigorously, as if to add emphasis to her summons.</p>

<p>"Here," drawled a lazy voice from the great elm by the road.
"What do you want? I am busy."</p>

<p>"You are reading, that's what!" exclaimed her sister in disgust,
as she came within sight of the slender, brown legs swinging among
the thickly-leaved branches. "Shut up that book and listen to
me. I've got some portentious"&mdash;she meant important&mdash;"news. Cameron's
Shoe Store advertises shoes at forty-nine cents. That means a
pair, doesn't it? They wouldn't sell them separately, would they,&mdash;'cepting
to one-legged people? And the sale lasts the whole week."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked Cherry, impatiently opening her book
once more; but Peace had scrambled up into the leafy retreat by
this time, and she thrust a ragged newspaper page into her sister's
hands, crying, "What of it? Why, Charity Greenfield, you were
saying just this morning that you'd have to have some new shoes
pretty quick or go barefooted on Sundays. How would you like that?
And mine are 'most worn out, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it if we must have shoes. Gail says there
won't be any extra money this month. It took all she had to pay
up Mike, so she could let him go. Besides, this paper says they
are canvas shoes. Those wouldn't last us any time. Faith says
we ought to have cow-hide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that sounds just like her. She is always saying something
cross. She ought to be thankful that we don't wear our shoes out
any faster. S'posing we didn't have any summer so we could go
barefooted, or s'posing we had as many legs as a spider, and had
to buy a dozen pair of shoes each time. I guess <em>that</em>
would take money! Aren't canvas shoes the things Nellie Banker
had? Hers wore an awfully long time and she put them on every
day, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see how that helps us any if we haven't got the
money. Cameron's Shoe Store is in Martindale, too. Where did you
get this paper?"</p>

<p>"I've been helping Mrs. Grinnell shell peas, and she dumped the
pods onto this scrap. When I saw 'shoes forty-nine cents,' I asked
her if it meant sure-enough shoes for that little, and she said
it did, and that any time we wanted to get things in town at a
sale when she was going in, we could drive along with her."</p>

<p>"But the money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't we earn it? I heard Mr. Hardman tell the butcher that
he needed someone to help pick his late strawberries, and he'll
pay five cents a quart. We've often picked strawberries, and it
isn't very hard work&mdash;just hot and mon-mon &mdash;I can't think
of the rest of that word."</p>

<p>"It's just as well," answered Cherry, with unconscious sarcasm.
"'Twas likely wrong anyway. Do you mean to say you would pick
berries for Mr. Hartman, when you hate him so?"</p>

<p>"Why not&mdash;if he will have us? His money is just as good as any
other man's, ain't it? Only he's mighty stingy."</p>

<p>"That's just it! I don't believe you heard him right. He'll never
pay five cents a quart for picking berries, Peace. Now, if it
was Judge Abbott or Mrs. Grinnell &mdash;Why, strawberries are
cheap!"</p>

<p>"Not now, when they are 'most gone. And, besides, he told the
butcher that one of the big hotels in Martindale pays him twenty
cents a quart for all he will bring them. It's a special kind,
you see, splendid big ones, that only rich folks can 'ford to
eat."</p>

<p>Cherry swung her feet thoughtfully as she read the alluring advertisement
once more, and pondered the question of such importance to both
little girls, but she ventured no reply.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Peace, sharply, after some moments of impatient
silence.</p>

<p>"It's awfully hot to pick berries in the sun all day," yawned
Cherry, fingering her book longingly.</p>

<p>Peace snorted in disgust, and seizing the precious paper from
her sister's lap, she swung nimbly to the ground and started off
across the meadow on the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>"Wait, Peace! Where are you going?" cried Cherry, scrambling
off her perch, thoroughly awake now.</p>

<p>"To pick me a pair of shoes in Mr. Hardman's strawberry patch,"
answered Peace, quickening her pace.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't hurry so fast. I'll go, too. But s'posing he won't
let us pick berries for him?"</p>

<p>"I ain't s'posing any such thing. We've picked strawberries before.
Why, Allee knows how. Anyone with sense can do a thing like that!"</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;are you going to take Allee along if he should give us the
job?"</p>

<p>"No, her shoes will last a long time yet. She doesn't need any
new ones."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the long, low, green house on the
farm adjoining theirs, and almost bumped into Mr. Hartman himself,
as they dashed breathlessly around the corner in search of him.</p>

<p>"Highty, tighty!" ejaculated the startled man, leaping aside
to avoid a collision. "What are you young rapscallions doing over
here? You better make tracks for home."</p>

<p>"Ramscallion yourself," Peace burst out hotly, nursing a stubbed
toe and winking rapidly to keep the tears back. "We've come to
pick your strawberries."</p>

<p>"You have, eh? Well now, what if I won't let you?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll go home. Come, Cherry!" Grabbing her sister's hand,
she marched angrily toward the road, but he called after her,
"What will you pick berries for?"</p>

<p>"Five cents a quart," she replied briefly, not looking around
or slackening her gait in the least.</p>

<p>He chuckled. "Huh! Your price is pretty steep."</p>

<p>"'Pends upon how you look at it," she flung back at him. "You
pay that to other folks, and we can pick as good as anyone. Mrs.
Grinnell always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Grinnell's berries are only scrubs."</p>

<p>"Scrubs have to be picked carefully so's not to squash them."</p>

<p>He laughed outright, and Peace marched on with head high and
cheeks aflame with anger.</p>

<p>Before she had reached the road, however, he stopped her by saying,
"What do you want to pick berries for this hot weather?"</p>

<p>"For money. We want some shoes. Cameron's are selling canvas
shoes for forty-nine cents a pair all this week, and Mrs. Grinnell
is going in town Saturday, and we could drive with her&mdash;s'posing
we could earn enough for the shoes."</p>

<p>"Why don't your ma buy some?"</p>

<p>"Mother's sick and Gail hasn't any money."</p>

<p>"You've got a pretty little farm there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can't wear farms on our feet," snapped Peace, moving off
once more, but again he stopped them, for he was really in need
of pickers in order to harvest his big crop of berries before
they spoiled on the vines. "Well, now, I'll tell you, kids, I
will try you at picking, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pay us five cents a box?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are good at the job. Come tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"We'll begin now. This is Thursday, and that sale lasts only
till Saturday. It might rain tomorrow, and 'sides, it <em>might</em>
take us more'n a day."</p>

<p>"Well, suit yourselves," chuckled the man. "But be sure you do
good work and don't eat up the berries."</p>

<p>So the two small sisters were soon busily engaged in picking
the luscious red fruit and packing it in quart boxes, while the
sun poured mercilessly down upon them. But they pluckily stuck
to their post until the day was done, trying to forget the heat
and dust in planning their trip to the big city, which they had
visited so seldom. However, two long, thankful sighs escaped their
dry lips when at length Gail's horn tooted out the summons to
the evening meal, and they hurried homeward as fast as their aching
backs and tired feet would carry them, exultant though perspiring.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" murmured Cherry plaintively, as she bathed her hot
face at the pump, "I never knew before how many berries it took
to make a quart."</p>

<p>"It would take lots more if we were picking wild strawberries.
They ain't bigger'n peas, but these are whoppers."</p>

<p>"And covered thick with spiders&mdash;ugh! I feel them crawling all
over me now. I believe I killed a million just this afternoon."</p>

<p>Peace laughed. They didn't bother her. "Just s'posing those strawberries
were bugs really, and when the hotel people ate them the bugs
would bite. My, wouldn't you like to hear them holler?"</p>

<p>"Why, Peace Greenfield!" cried Cherry in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>"Well, Hope was reading yesterday about some place where snakes
coil up and look just like springs of water, and when thirsty
people bend over to drink, the snakes bite them. There <em>might</em>
be bugs somewhere that looked like strawberries so folks would
try to eat them. Course I wouldn't want them to hurt the people
bad&mdash;just enough to make them jump good."</p>

<p>"I would rather have strawberries look like pennies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather have them <em>be</em> pennies. Just think, if we
could pick money off from strawberry vines! Everyone would start
to raising strawberries, wouldn't they? And how rich we would
be! Never mind, we picked ten boxes of berries this afternoon&mdash;that
means a shoe apiece. We surely ought to get that many more by
noon tomorrow. Let's begin early so's to pick as many as we can
before it gets hot."</p>

<p>So the morrow found them early in the field again, and by noon
the second ten boxes were filled to the brim.</p>

<p>"There!" breathed Cherry in relief, mopping her crimson face
on her sleeve as she surveyed the fruit of their labor. "We are
done. Now we can get our shoes all right tomorrow. Why, what are
you doing, Peace? Are you crazy?" For Peace had snatched up some
empty boxes from another crate and was making her way between
the green rows again.</p>

<p>"Nope," answered the perspiring little maid. "I am just going
to pick some more."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not!" was the emphatic reply, as Cherry started after
the dusty figure plodding down the field. "I am nearly cooked
now, and hungry as a bear. Come on home! We have picked enough
to pay for our shoes, goosie. Or do you want two pair?"</p>

<p>Peace lifted her somber eyes from her self-appointed task and
said briefly, "Yep&mdash;for Allee."</p>

<p>"For Allee?" echoed astonished Cherry. "You told me yourself
that she didn't need any new shoes."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think she did, but last night I 'xamined her
only pair and they look awfully scrubby. There isn't any more
blacking in the house, and the ink I sopped onto them made them
worse than ever. Besides, <em>I&mdash;</em>it would look mean to get
us some shoes and not any for her."</p>

<p>Without another word, Cherry gathered up an armful of empty boxes
and dropped down by a new row of vines, picking silently, ploddingly
until at last the third ten had been filled. Then she spoke, "Is
this all, or are you going to earn shoes for Hope and Faith and
Gail? Because the afternoon is pretty well gone and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three pair of shoes is all I am going to pick," interrupted
Peace somewhat sharply, for she was hot and tired, and Cherry's
tone seemed to imply criticism. "Help me tote these crates up
to the house now and we'll get our pay."</p>

<p>Mr. Hartman met them as they tugged the second crate, only half
filled, up to the berry shed, and the spirit of mischief suddenly
took possession of the usually stern, business-like farmer.</p>

<p>"So you have picked all you want to, have you? Well, I am surprised
to think you would give up so soon. Here, hand me that box! I
want to see what kind of pickers you are." He hoisted the two
crates to the corner of the fence surrounding one of his brooding
pens, and pretended to examine each box critically, while the
girls waited in anxious silence for his word of approval. "Hm!"
he said at last, trying to frown, and succeeding so well that
both little faces paled with misgiving. "Just as I expected! You
don't know how to pick strawberries. You don't deserve a cent
of pay. How much were you to get? Five cents a box?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," whispered Peace, with lips so dry they could hardly
form the words.</p>

<p>"Well, I oughtn't to give you a penny, but I will be generous
and live up to my part of the bargain. Five cents a box, was it?
And there are two boxes and a half of fruit."</p>

<p>His eyes were twinkling, but this Peace failed to notice, and
she cried indignantly, "There are <em>thirty</em> boxes! We picked
ten last night and twenty today."</p>

<p>"Oh, those little boxes! Five cents a big box, I meant. That
would be ten cents and half a nickel over; but I will be good
and give you fifteen cents for your work." He drew three battered
coins from his pocket and dropped them into Peace's damp, dirty
hand.</p>

<p>She drew in her breath sharply, stared at the money for a moment
in dumb amazement, then let it fly with all her might straight
at Mr. Hartman's head, screaming in a frenzy of anger and disappointment,
"You numscullion of a cheat! Do you s'pose you will ever get to
heaven? There are your old berries! You can hire your chickens
to pick them up! I'll never work for you again!" One shove of
the crates, and the beautiful, tempting fruit lay in a scattered
heap inside the chicken yard! And Peace, blinded by the hot tears
of rage, was flying for home with dismayed Cherry close at her
heels.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Hartman's turn to stare, and stare he did, first at
the spoiled fruit and then at the flying girls, too stunned to
understand. The hot blood mounted to his forehead, he shook his
fist in unreasoning anger and yelled, "Drat your pesky hides!
Come back here and I'll tan you good! What do you mean by spoiling
all that high-priced fruit? Oh, if I just had my hands on you
now!"</p>

<p>"You got only what you deserved, Dave Hartman," said a quiet
voice behind him, and he whirled angrily toward his wife, who
had come upon the scene unnoticed.</p>

<p>"All I deserved! Twenty quarts of fruit spoiled! Four dollars'
worth, Myra Ann!"</p>

<p>"You should have been fair to the children and it never would
have happened. They have worked hard and earned their money."</p>

<p>"Fair! I meant to be fair. I was just fooling with them. If she
hadn't been quicker'n greased lightning she would have got all
that was coming to her."</p>

<p>"How was she to know that? You looked so ferocious I don't wonder
she took you at your word. The best thing you can do now is to
rescue that fruit before the chickens have spoiled it entirely,
and let me wash and can it. Then you better go over and pay the
children for their work."</p>

<p>"Pay the children a dollar and a half for spoiling four dollars'
worth of strawberries? Well, I should say not! They will never
get another cent out of me, no matter if they go barefooted all
the rest of their days."</p>
