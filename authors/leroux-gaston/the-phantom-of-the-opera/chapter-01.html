<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was the evening on which <em>MM. </em>Debienne and Poligny,
the managers of the Opera, were giving a last gala performance
to mark their retirement.  Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli,
one of the principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young
ladies of the ballet, who had come up from the stage after "dancing"
Polyeucte.  They rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent
to forced and unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror. 
Sorelli, who wished to be alone for a moment to "run through"
the speech which she was to make to the resigning managers, looked
around angrily at the mad and tumultuous crowd.  It was little
Jammes&mdash;the girl with the tip-tilted nose, the forget-me-not eyes,
the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white neck and shoulders&mdash;who
gave the explanation in a trembling voice:</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!"  And she locked the door.</p>

<p>Sorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace
elegance.  A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard
or two provided the necessary furniture.  On the walls hung a
few engravings, relics of the mother, who had known the glories
of the old Opera in the Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris,
Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini.  But the room seemed a palace to the
brats of the corps de ballet, who were lodged in common dressing-rooms
where they spent their time singing, quarreling, smacking the
dressers and hair-dressers and buying one another glasses of cassis,
beer, or even rhum, until the call-boy's bell rang.</p>

<p>Sorelli was very superstitious.  She shuddered when she heard
little Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a "silly little fool"
and then, as she was the first to believe in ghosts in general,
and the Opera ghost in particular, at once asked for details:</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"As plainly as I see you now!" said little Jammes, whose legs
were giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into
a chair.</p>

<p>Thereupon little Giry&mdash;the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair
black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched
over poor little bones&mdash;little Giry added:</p>

<p>"If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.</p>

<p>And they all began to talk together.  The ghost had appeared
to them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had
suddenly stood before them in the passage, without their knowing
where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the
wall.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head. 
"You see the ghost everywhere!"</p>

<p>And it was true.  For several months, there had been nothing
discussed at the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked
about the building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke
to nobody, to whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon
as he was seen, no one knowing how or where.  As became a real
ghost, he made no noise in walking.  People began by laughing
and making fun of this specter dressed like a man of fashion or
an undertaker; but the ghost legend soon swelled to enormous proportions
among the corps de ballet.  All the girls pretended to have met
this supernatural being more or less often.  And those who laughed
the loudest were not the most at ease. When he did not show himself,
he betrayed his presence or his passing by accident, comic or
serious, for which the general superstition held him responsible. 
Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical joke at the
hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it was
at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.</p>

<p>After all, who had seen him?  You meet so many men in dress-clothes
at the Opera who are not ghosts.  But this dress-suit had a peculiarity
of its own.  It covered a skeleton.  At least, so the ballet-girls
said. And, of course, it had a death's head.</p>

<p>Was all this serious?  The truth is that the idea of the skeleton
came from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet,
the chief scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost.  He had
run up against the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights,
which leads to "the cellars."  He had seen him for a second&mdash;for
the ghost had fled&mdash;and to any one who cared to listen to him
he said:</p>

<p>"He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton
frame.  His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed
pupils. You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull. 
His skin, which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead,
is not white, but a nasty yellow.  His nose is so little worth
talking about that you can't see it side-face; and <em>THE ABSENCE
</em>of that nose is a horrible thing TO <em>LOOK AT.  </em>All
the hair he has is three or four long dark locks on his forehead
and behind his ears."</p>

<p>This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very
slow at imagining things.  His words were received with interest
and amazement; and soon there were other people to say that they
too had met a man in dress-clothes with a death's head on his
shoulders.  Sensible men who had wind of the story began by saying
that Joseph Buquet had been the victim of a joke played by one
of his assistants.  And then, one after the other, there came
a series of incidents so curious and so inexplicable that the
very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow!  He fears nothing,
least of all fire!  Well, the fireman in question, who had gone
to make a round of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems,
had ventured a little farther than usual, suddenly reappeared
on the stage, pale, scared, trembling, with his eyes starting
out of his head, and practically fainted in the arms of the proud
mother of little Jammes.[1]  And why? Because he had seen coming
toward him, AT <em>THE LEVEL OF HIS HEAD, BUT WITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED
TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE!  </em>And, as I said, a fireman is not
afraid of fire.</p>

<p>The fireman's name was Pampin.</p>

<p>The corps de ballet was flung into consternation.  At first sight,
this fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description
of the ghost.  But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves
that the ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he
pleased.  And, of course, they at once imagined that they were
in the greatest danger. Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint,
leaders and front-row and back-row girls alike had plenty of excuses
for the fright that made them quicken their pace when passing
some dark corner or ill-lighted corridor.  Sorelli herself, on
the day after the adventure of the fireman, placed a horseshoe
on the table in front of the stage-door-keeper's box, which every
one who entered the Opera otherwise than as a spectator must touch
before setting foot on the first tread of the staircase.  This
horse-shoe was not invented by me&mdash;any more than any other part
of this story, alas!&mdash;and may still be seen on the table in the
passage outside the stage-door-keeper's box, when you enter the
Opera through the court known as the Cour de l'Administration.</p>

<p>To return to the evening in question.</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!" little Jammes had cried.</p>

<p>An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing
was heard but the hard breathing of the girls.  At last, Jammes,
flinging herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every
mark of real terror on her face, whispered:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door.  There
was no sound of footsteps.  It was like light silk sliding over
the panel. Then it stopped.</p>

<p>Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others.  She went up
to the door and, in a quavering voice, asked:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>But nobody answered.  Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching
her last movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said
very loudly:</p>

<p>"Is there any one behind the door?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!  Of course there is!" cried that little dried
plum of a Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze
skirt. "Whatever you do, don't open the door!  Oh, Lord, don't
open the door!"</p>

<p>But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned
the key and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated
to the inner dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:</p>

<p>"Mother!  Mother!"</p>

<p>Sorelli looked into the passage bravely.  It was empty; a gas-flame,
in its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the
surrounding darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it.  And
the dancer slammed the door again, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "there is no one there."</p>

<p>"Still, we saw him!"  Jammes declared, returning with timid little
steps to her place beside Sorelli.  "He must be somewhere prowling
about.  I shan't go back to dress.  We had better all go down
to the foyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we will
come up again together."</p>

<p>And the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring
which she wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily,
with the tip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew's
cross on the wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her
left hand.  She said to the little ballet-girls:</p>

<p>"Come, children, pull yourselves together!  I dare say no one
has ever seen the ghost."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we saw him&mdash;we saw him just now!" cried the girls. 
"He had his death's head and his dress-coat, just as when he appeared
to Joseph Buquet!"</p>

<p>"And Gabriel saw him too!" said Jammes.  "Only yesterday!  Yesterday
afternoon&mdash;in broad day-light&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Gabriel, the chorus-master?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"And he was wearing his dress-clothes, in broad daylight?"</p>

<p>"Who?  Gabriel?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, the ghost!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!  Gabriel told me so himself.  That's what he knew
him by. Gabriel was in the stage-manager's office.  Suddenly the
door opened and the Persian entered.  You know the Persian has
the evil eye&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered the little ballet-girls in chorus, warding
off ill-luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at
the absent Persian, while their second and third fingers were
bent on the palm and held down by the thumb.</p>

<p>"And you know how superstitious Gabriel is," continued Jammes.
"However, he is always polite.  When he meets the Persian, he
just puts his hand in his pocket and touches his keys.  Well,
the moment the Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one
jump from his chair to the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch
iron!  In doing so, he tore a whole skirt of his overcoat on a
nail.  Hurrying to get out of the room, he banged his forehead
against a hat-peg and gave himself a huge bump; then, suddenly
stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen, near the piano;
he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his hands and
crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a madman,
slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first
flight on his back.  I was just passing with mother.  We picked
him up. He was covered with bruises and his face was all over
blood.  We were frightened out of our lives, but, all at once,
he began to thank Providence that he had got off so cheaply. 
Then he told us what had frightened him.  He had seen the ghost
behind the Persian, <em>THE GHOST WITH THE DEATH'S HEAD </em>just
like Joseph Buquet's description!"</p>

<p>Jammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost
were at her heels, and was quite out of breath at the finish. 
A silence followed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great
excitement.  It was broken by little Giry, who said:</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet would do better to hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"Why should he hold his tongue?" asked somebody.</p>

<p>"That's mother's opinion," replied Meg, lowering her voice and
looking all about her as though fearing lest other ears than those
present might overhear.</p>

<p>"And why is it your mother's opinion?"</p>

<p>"Hush!  Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked about."</p>

<p>"And why does your mother say so?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>This reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies,
who crowded round little Giry, begging her to explain herself. 
They were there, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously
in one movement of entreaty and fear, communicating their terror
to one another, taking a keen pleasure in feeling their blood
freeze in their veins.</p>

<p>"I swore not to tell!" gasped Meg.</p>

<p>But they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret, until
Meg, burning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes fixed on
the door:</p>

<p>"Well, it's because of the private box."</p>

<p>"What private box?"</p>

<p>"The ghost's box!"</p>

<p>"Has the ghost a box?  Oh, do tell us, do tell us!"</p>

<p>"Not so loud!" said Meg.  "It's Box Five, you know, the box on
the grand tier, next to the stage-box, on the left."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it is.  Mother has charge of it.  But you swear you
won't say a word?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the ghost's box.  No one has had it for over a
month, except the ghost, and orders have been given at the box-office
that it must never be sold."</p>

<p>"And does the ghost really come there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then somebody does come?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!  The ghost comes, but there is nobody there."</p>

<p>The little ballet-girls exchanged glances.  If the ghost came
to the box, he must be seen, because he wore a dress-coat and
a death's head. This was what they tried to make Meg understand,
but she replied:</p>

<p>"That's just it!  The ghost is not seen.  And he has no dress-coat
and no head!  All that talk about his death's head and his head
of fire is nonsense!  There's nothing in it.  You only hear him
when he is in the box.  Mother has never seen him, but she has
heard him.  Mother knows, because she gives him his program."</p>

<p>Sorelli interfered.</p>

<p>"Giry, child, you're getting at us!"</p>

<p>Thereupon little Giry began to cry.</p>

<p>"I ought to have held my tongue&mdash;if mother ever came to know! 
But I was quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to talk of
things that don't concern him&mdash;it will bring him bad luck&mdash;mother
was saying so last night&#11834;"</p>

<p>There was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the passage
and a breathless voice cried:</p>

<p>"Cecile!  Cecile!  Are you there?"</p>

<p>"It's mother's voice," said Jammes.  "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>She opened the door.  A respectable lady, built on the lines
of a Pomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing-room and dropped
groaning into a vacant arm-chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her
brick-dust colored face.</p>

<p>"How awful!" she said.  "How awful!"</p>

<p>"What?  What?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet!"</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet is dead!"</p>

<p>The room became filled with exclamations, with astonished outcries,
with scared requests for explanations.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was found hanging in the third-floor cellar!"</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!" little Giry blurted, as though in spite of
herself; but she at once corrected herself, with her hands pressed
to her mouth: "No, no!&mdash;I, didn't say it! &mdash;I didn't say
it!&#11834;"</p>

<p>All around her, her panic-stricken companions repeated under
their breaths:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it must be the ghost!"</p>

<p>Sorelli was very pale.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to recite my speech," she said.</p>

<p>Ma Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of liqueur
that happened to be standing on a table; the ghost must have something
to do with it.</p>

<p>The truth is that no one ever knew how Joseph Buquet met his
death. The verdict at the inquest was "natural suicide."  In his
Memoirs of Manager, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint managers who
succeeded <em>MM. </em>Debienne and Poligny, describes the incident
as follows:</p>

<p>"A grievous accident spoiled the little party which <em>MM. 
</em>Debienne and Poligny gave to celebrate their retirement. 
I was in the manager's office, when Mercier, the acting-manager,
suddenly came darting in.  He seemed half mad and told me that
the body of a scene-shifter had been found hanging in the third
cellar under the stage, between a farm-house and a scene from
the Roi de Lahore.  I shouted:</p>

<p>"'Come and cut him down!'</p>

<p>"By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's
ladder, the man was no longer hanging from his rope!"</p>

<p>So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural.  A man
hangs at the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope
has disappeared. Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation! 
Listen to him:</p>

<p>"It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls
lost no time in taking their precautions against the evil eye."</p>

<p>There you are!  Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the
Jacob's ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves
in less time than it takes to write!  When, on the other hand,
I think of the exact spot where the body was discovered&mdash;the third
cellar underneath the stage!&mdash;imagine that <em>SOMEBODY </em>must
have been interested in seeing that the rope disappeared after
it had effected its purpose; and time will show if I am wrong.</p>

<p>The horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph
Buquet was very popular.  The dressing-rooms emptied and the ballet-girls,
crowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around their shepherdess,
made for the foyer through the ill-lit passages and staircases,
trotting as fast as their little pink legs could carry them.</p>

<p>[1] I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro
Gailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera.</p>
