<P>Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all
alone by themselves, as the Story-books say -- and my
blessing, with yours to back it I hope, on the Story-
books, for saying anything in this workaday world!
-- Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all
alone by themselves, in a little cracked nutshell of a
wooden house, which was, in truth, no better than a
pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and
Tackleton. The premises of Gruff and Tackleton
were the great feature of the street; but you might
have knocked down Caleb Plummer's dwelling with
a hammer or two, and carried off the pieces in a cart.
<P>If any one had done the dwelling-house of Caleb
Plummer the honour to miss it after such an inroad,
it would have been, no doubt, to commend its demoli-
tion as a vast improvement. It stuck to the premises
of Gruff and Tackleton, like a barnacle to a ship's
keel, or a snail to a door, or a little bunch of toad-
stools to the stem of a tree. But, it was the germ
from which the full-grown trunk of Gruff and Tackle-
ton had sprung; and, under its crazy roof, the Gruff
before last, had, in a small way, made toys for a
generation of old boys and girls, who had played
with them, and found them out, and broken them, and
gone to sleep.
<P>I have said that Caleb and his poor Blind Daugh-
ter lived here. I should have said that Caleb lived
here, and his poor Blind Daughter somewhere else --
in an enchanted home of Caleb's furnishing, where
scarcity and shabbiness were not, and trouble never
entered. Caleb was no sorcerer, but in the only magic
art that still remains to us, the magic of devoted,
deathless love, Nature had been the mistress of his
study; and from her teaching, all the wonder came.
<P>The Blind Girl never knew that ceilings were dis-
coloured, walls blotched and bare of plaster here and
there, high crevices unstopped, and widening every
day, beams mouldering and tending downward. The
Blind Girl never knew that iron was rusting, wood
rotting, paper peeling off; the size, and shape, and
true proportion of the dwelling, withering away.
The Blind Girl never knew that ugly shapes of delf
and earthenware were on the board; that sorrow and
faint-heartedness were in the house; that Caleb's
scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey, be-
fore her sightless face. The Blind Girl never knew
they had a master, cold, exacting, and uninterested --
never knew that Tackleton was Tackleton in short;
but lived in the belief of an eccentric humourist who
loved to have his jest with them, and who while he
was the Guardian Angel of their lives, disdained to
hear one word of thankfulness.
<P>And all was Caleb's doing; all the doing of her
simple father! But he too had a Cricket on his
Hearth; and listening sadly to its music when the
motherless Blind Child was very young, that Spirit
had inspired him with the thought that even her great
deprivation might be almost changed into a blessing,
and the girl made happy by these little means. For
all the Cricket tribe are potent Spirits. even though
the people who hold converse with them do not know
it (which is frequently the case); and there are not
in the unseen world, voices more gentle and more true,
that may be so implicitly relied on, or that are so cer-
tain to give none but tenderest counsel, as the Voices
in which the Spirits of the Fireside and the Hearth
address themselves to human kind.
<P>Caleb and his daughter were at work together in
their usual working-room, which served them for
their ordinary living-room as well; and a strange
place it was. There were houses in it, finished and
unfinished, for Dolls of all stations in life. Suburban
tenements for Dolls of moderate means; kitchens and
single apartments for Dolls of the lower classes;
capital town residences for Dolls of high estate.
Some of these establishments were already furnished
according to estimate, with a view to the convenience
of Dolls of limited income; others, could be fitted on
the most expensive scale, at a moment's notice, from
whole shelves of chairs and tables, sofas, bedsteads,
and upholstery. The nobility and gentry, and public
in general, for whose accommodation these tenements
were designed, lay, here and there, in baskets, staring
straight up at the ceiling; but, in denoting their de-
grees in society, and confining them to their respec-
tive stations (which experience shows to be lament-
ably difficult in real life), the makers of these Dolls
had far improved on Nature, who is often froward
and perverse; for, they, not resting on such arbitrary
marks as satin, cotton-print, and bits of rag, had
superadded striking personal differences which allowed
of no mistake. Thus, the Doll-lady of distinction
had wax limbs of perfect symmetry; but, only she
and her compeers. The next grade in the social scale
being made of leather, and the next of coarse linen
stuff. As to the common-people, they had just so
many matches out of tinder-boxes, for their arms and
legs, and there they were -- established in their sphere
at once, beyond the possibility of getting out of it.
<P>There were various other samples of his handicraft,
besides Dolls, in Caleb Plummer's room. There
were Noah's Arks, in which the Birds and Beasts
were an uncommonly tight fit, I assure vou; though
they could be crammed in, anyhow, at the roof, and
rattled and shaken into the smallest compass. By a
bold poetical licence, most of these Noah's Arks had
knockers on the doors; inconsistent appendages, per-
haps, as suggestive of morning callers and a Post-
man, yet a pleasant finish to the outside of the build-
ing. There were scores of melancholy little carts
which, when the wheels went round, performed most
doleful music. Many small fiddles, drums, and other
instruments of torture; no end of cannon, shields,
swords, spears, and guns. There were little tumblers
in red breeches, incessantly swarming up high ob-
stacles of red-tape, and coming down, head first, on
the other side; and there were innumerable old gentle-
men of respectable, not to say venerable, appearance,
insanely flying over horizontal pegs, inserted, for the
purpose, in their own street doors. There were beasts
of all sorts; horses, in particular, of every breed, from
the spotted barrel on four pegs, with a small tippet
for a mane, to the thoroughbred rocker on his highest
mettle. As it would have been hard to count the
dozens upon dozens of grotesque figures that were
ever ready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the
turning of a handle, so it would have been no easy
task to mention any human folly, vice, or weakness,
that had not its type, immediate or remote, in Caleb
Plummer's room. And not in an exaggerated form,
for very little handles will move men and women
to as strange performances, as any Toy was ever
made to undertake.
<P>In the midst of all these objects, Caleb and his
daughter sat at work. The Blind Girl busy as a
Doll's dressmaker; Caleb painting and glazing the
four-pair front of a desirable family mansion.
<P>The care imprinted in the lines of Caleb's face, and
his absorbed and dreamy manner, which would have
sat well on some alchemist or abstruse student, were
at first sight an odd contrast to his occupation, and
the trivialities about him. But, trivial things, in-
vented and pursued for bread, become very serious
matters of fact; and, apart from this consideration,
I am not at all prepared to say, myself, that if Caleb
had been a Lord Chamberlain, or a Member of Parlia-
ment, or a lawyer, or even a great speculator, he
would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical,
while I have a very great doubt whether they would
have been as harmless.
<P>'So you were out in the rain last night, father, in
your beautiful new great-coat,' said Caleb's daughter.
<P>'In my beautiful new great-coat,' answered Caleb,
glancing towards a clothes-line in the room, on which
the sack-cloth garment previously described, was
carefully hung up to dry.
<P>'How glad I am you bought it, father!'
<P>'And of such a tailor, too,' said Caleb. 'Quite a
fashionable tailor. It's too good for me.'
<P>The Blind Girl rested from her work, and laughed
with delight. 'Too good, father! What can be too
good for you?'
<P>'I'm half ashamed to wear it though,' said Caleb,
watching the effect of what he said, upon her bright-
ening face; 'upon my word! When I hear the boys
and people say behind me, "Halloa! Here's a swell!"
I don't know which way to look. And when the
beggar wouldn't go away last night; and when I
said I was a very common man, said "No, your
Honour! Bless your Honour, don't say that!" I
was quite ashamed. I really felt as if I hadn't a right
to wear it.'
<P>Happy Blind Girl! How merry she was, in her
exultation!
<P>'I see you, father,' she said, clasping her hands, 'as
plainly, as if I had the eyes I never want when you
are with me. A blue coat --'
<P>'Bright blue,' said Caleb.
<P>'Yes, yes! Bright blue!' exclaimed the girl, turn-
ing up her radiant face; 'the colour I can just-remem-
ber in the blessed sky! You told me it was blue be-
fore! A bright blue coat --'
<P>'Made loose to the figure,' suggested Caleb.
<P>'Made loose to the figure!' cried the Blind Girl,
laughing heartily; 'and in it, you, dear father, with
your merry eye, your smiling face, your free step,
and your dark hair --looking so young and hand-
some!'
<P>'Halloa! Halloa!' said Caleb. 'I shall be vain,
presently!'
<P>'I think you are, already,' cried the Blind Girl,
pointing at him, in her glee. 'I know you, father!
Ha, ha, ha! I've found you out, you see!'
<P>How different the picture in her mind, from Caleb,
as he sat observing her! She had spoken of his free
step. She was right in that. For years and years,
he had never once crossed that threshold at his own
slow pace, but with a footfall counterfeited for her
ear; and never had he, when his heart was heaviest,
forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so
cheerful and courageous!
<P>Heaven knows! But I think Caleb's vague be-
wilderment of manner may have half originated in
his having confused himself about himself and every-
thing around him, for the love of his Blind Daughter.
How could the little man be otherwise than bewil-
dered, after labouring for so many years to destroy
his own identity, and that of all the objects that had
any bearing on it!
<P>'There we are,' said Caleb, falling back a pace or
two to form the better judgment of his work; 'as
near the real thing as sixpenn'orth of halfpence is to
sixpence. What a pity that the whole front of the
house opens at once! If there was only a staircase
in it, now, and regular doors to the rooms to go in at!
But that's the worst of my calling, I'm always de-
luding myself, and swindling myself.'
<P>'You are speaking quite softly. You are not tired,
father?'
<P>'Tired!' echoed Caleb, with a great burst of anima-
tion, 'what should tire me, Bertha? I was never tired.
What does it mean?'
<P>To give the greater force to his words, he checked
himself in an involuntary imitation of two half-
length stretching and yawning figures on the mantel-
shelf, who were represented as in one eternal state of
weariness from the waist upwards; and hummed a
fragment of a song. It was a Bacchanalian song,
something about a Sparkling Bowl. He sang it with
an assumption of a Devil-may-care voice, that made
his face a thousand times more meagre and more
thoughtful than ever.
<P>'What! You're singing, are you?' said Tackle-
ton, putting his head in at the door. 'Go it! I can't
sing.'
<P>Nobody would have suspected him of it. He
hadn't what is generally termed a singing face, by
any means.
<P>'I can't afford to sing,' said Tackleton. 'I'm glad
you can. I hope you can afford to work too. Hardly
time for both, I should think?'
<P>'If you could only see him, Bertha, how he's wink-
ing at me!' whispered Caleb. 'Such a man to joke!
you'd think, if you didn't know him, he was in ear-
nest -- wouldn't you now?'
<P>The Blind Girl smiled and nodded.
<P>'The bird that can sing and won't sing, must be
made to sing, they say,' grumbled Tackleton. 'What
about the owl that can't sing, and oughtn't to sing,
and will sing; is there anything that he should be
made to do?'
<P>'The extent to which he's winking at this moment!'
whispered Caleb to his daughter. '0, my gracious!'
<P>'Always merry and light-hearted with us!' cried
the smiling Bertha.
<P>'0, you're there, are you?' answered Tackleton.
'Poor Idiot!'
<P>He really did believe she was an Idiot; and he
found the belief, I can't say whether consciously or
not, upon her being fond of him.
<P>'Well! and being there, -- how are you?' said Tack-
leton, in his grudging way.
<P>'Oh! well; quite well. And as happy as even you
can wish me to be. As happy as you would make the
whole world, if you could!'
<P>'Poor Idiot!' muttered Tackleton. 'No gleam of
reason. Not a gleam!'
<P>The Blind Girl took his hand and kissed it; held it
for a moment in her own two hands; and laid her
cheek against it tenderly, before releasing it. There
was such unspeakable affection and such fervent
gratitude in the act, that Tackleton himself was
moved to say, in a milder growl than usual:
<P>'What's the matter now?'
<P>'stood it close beside my pillow when I went to
sleep last night, and remembered it in my dreams.
And when the day broke, and the glorious red sun
the red sun, father?'
<P>'Red in the mornings and the evenings, Bertha,'
said poor Caleb, with a woeful glance at his employer.
<P>'When it rose, and the bright light I almost fear to
strike myself against in walking, came into the room,
I turned the little tree towards it, and blessed Heaven
for making things so precious, and blessed you for
sending them to cheer me!'
<P>'Bedlam broke loose!' said Tackleton under his
breath. 'We shall arrive at the strait-waistcoat and
mufflers soon. We're getting on!'
<P>Caleb, with his hands hooked loosely in each other,
stared vacantly before him while his daughter spoke,
as if he really were uncertain (I believe he was)
whether Tackleton had done anything to deserve her
thanks, or not. If he could have been a perfectly
free agent, at that moment, required, on pain of
death, to kick the Toy-merchant, or fall at his feet,
according to his merits, I believe it would have been
an even chance which course he would have taken.
Yet, Caleb knew that with his own hands he had
brought the little rose-tree home for her, so carefully'
and that with his own lips he had forged the innocent
deception which should help to keep her from suspect-
ing how much, how very much, he every day denied
himself, that she might be the happier.
<P>'Bertha!' said Tackleton, assuming, for the nonce,
a little cordiality. 'Come here.'
<P>'Oh! I can come straight to you! You needn't
guide me!' she rejoined.
<P>'Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?'
<P>'If you will!' she answered, eagerly.
<P> How bright the darkened face! How adorned with
light, the listening head!
<P>'This is the day on which little what's-her-name,
the spoilt child, Peerybingle's wife, pays her regular
visit to you -- makes her fantastic Pic-Nic here; an't
it?' said Tackleton, with a strong expression of dis-
taste for the whole concern.
<P>'Yes,' replied Bertha. 'This is the day.'
<P>'I thought so,' said Tackleton. 'I should like to
join the party.'
<P>'Do you hear that, father!' cried the Blind Girl in
an ecstasy.
<P>'Yes, yes, I hear it,' murmured Caleb, with the fixed
look of a sleep-walker; 'but I don't believe it. It's
one of my lies, I've no doubt.'
<P>'You see I -- I want to bring the Peerybingles a
little more into company with May Fielding,' said
Tackleton. 'I am going to be married to May.'
<P>'Married!' cried the Blind Girl, starting from him.
<P>'She's such a con-founded Idiot,' muttered Tack-
leton, 'that I was afraid she'd never comprehend me.
Ah, Bertha! Married! Church, parson, clerk, beadle,
glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake, favours, mar-
row-bones, cleavers, and all the rest of the tom-
foolery. A wedding, you know; a wedding. Don't
you know what a wedding is?'
<P>'I know,' replied the Blind Girl, in a gentle tone.
'I understand!'
<P>'Do you?' muttered Tackleton. 'It's more than I
expected. Well! On that account I want to join
the party, and to bring May and her mother. I'll
send in a little something or other, before the after-
noon. A cold leg of mutton, or some comfortable
trifle of that sort. You'll expect me?'
<P>'Yes,' she answered.
<P>She had drooped her head, and turned away; and
so stood, with her hands crossed, musing.
<P>'I don't think you will,' muttered Tackleton, look-
ing at her; 'for you seem to have forgotten all about
it already. Caleb!'
<P>'I may venture to say I'm here, I suppose,' thought
Caleb. 'Sir!'
<P>'Take care she don't forget what I've been saying
to her.'
<P>'She never forgets,' returned Caleb. 'It's one of
the few things she an't clever in.'
<P>'Every man thinks his own geese swans,' observed
the Toy-merchant, with a shrug. 'Poor devil!'
<P>Having delivered himself of which remark, with in-
finite contempt, old Gruff and Tackleton withdrew.
<P>Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in med-
itation. The gaiety had vanished from her downcast
face, and it was very sad. Three or four times, she
shook her head, as if bewailing some remembrance
or some loss; but, her sorrowful reflections found no
vent in words.
<P>It was not until Caleb had been occupied, some
time, in yoking a team of horses to a wagon by the
summary process of nailing the harness to the vital
parts of their bodies, that she drew near to his work-
ing-stool, and sitting down beside him, said:
<P>'Father, I am lonely in the dark. I want my eyes,
my patient, willing eyes.'
<P>'Here they are,' said Caleb. 'Always ready. They
are more yours than mine, Bertha, any hour in the
four-and-twenty. What shall your eyes do for you,
dear?'
<P>'Look round the room, father.'
<P>'All right,' said Caleb. 'No sooner said that done
Bertha.'
<P>'Tell me about it.'
<P>'It's much the same as usual,' said Caleb. 'Homely
but very snug. The gay colours on the walls; the
bright flowers on the plates and dishes; the shining
wood, where there are beams or panels; the general
cheerfulness and neatness of the building; make it
very pretty.'
<P>Cheerful and neat it was wherever Bertha's hands
could busy themselves. But nowhere else, were cheer-
fulness and neatness possible, in the old crazy shed
which Caleb's fancy so transformed.
<P>'You have your working dress on, and are not so
gallant as when you wear the handsome coat?' said
Bertha, touching him.
<P>'Not quite so gallant,' answered Caleb. 'Pretty
brisk though.'
<P>'Father,' said the Blind Girl, drawing close to his
side, and stealing one arm round his neck, 'tell me
something about May. She is very fair?'
<P>'She is indeed,' said Caleb. And she was indeed.
It was quite a rare thing to Caleb, not to have to
draw on his invention.
<P>'Her hair is dark,' said Bertha, pensively, 'darker
than mine. Her voice is sweet and musical, I know.
I have often loved to hear it. Her shape --'
<P>'There's not a Doll's in all the room to equal it,'
said Caleb. 'And her eyes!' --
<P>He stopped; for Bertha had drawn closer round
his neck, and, from the arm that clung about him,
came a warning pressure which he understood too
well.
<P>He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment,
and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling
bowl, his infallible resource in all such difficulties.
<P>'Our friend, father, our benefactor. I am never
tired you know of hearing about him. -- Now, was
I ever?' she said, hastily.
<P>'Of course not,' answered Caleb, 'and with reason.'
<P>'Ah! With how much reason!' cried the Blind
Girl. With such fervency, that Caleb, though his
motives were so pure, could not endure to meet her
face; but dropped his eyes, as if she could have read
in them his innocent deceit.
<P>'Then, tell me again about him, dear father,' said
Bertha. 'Many times again! His face is benevolent,
kind, and tender. Honest and true, I am sure it is.
The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a
show of roughness and unwillingness, beats in its
every look and glance.'
<P>'And makes it noble,' added Caleb, in his quiet
desperation
<P>'And makes it noble!' cried the Blind Girl. 'He is
older than May, father.'
<P>'Ye-es,' said Caleb, reluctantly. 'He's a little older
than May. But that don't signify.'
<P>'Oh father, yes! To be his patient companion in
infirmity and age; to be his gentle nurse in sickness,
and his constant friend in suffering and sorrow; to
know no weariness in working for his sake; to watch
him, tend him, sit beside his bed and talk to him
awake, and pray for him asleep; what privileges these
would be! What opportunities for proving all her
truth and devotion to him! Would she do all this,
dear father?'
<P>'No doubt of it,' said Caleb.
<P>'I love her, father; I can love her from my soul!'
exclaimed the Blind Girl. And saying so, she laid
her poor blind face on Caleb's shoulder, and so wept
and wept, that he was almost sorry to have brought
that tearful happiness upon her.
<P>In the meantime, there had been a pretty sharp
commotion at John Peerybingle's, for, little Mrs.
Peerybingle naturally couldn't think of going any-
where without the Baby; and to get the Baby under
weigh, took time. Not that there was much of the
Baby, speaking of it as a thing of weight and meas-
ure, but, there was a vast deal to do about and about
it, and it all had to be done by easy stages. For
instance, when the Baby was got, by hook and by
crook, to a certain point of dressing, and you might
have rationally supposed that another touch or two
would finish him off, and turn him out a tip-top
Baby challenging the world, he was unexpectedly ex-
tinguished in a flannel cap, and hustled off to bed;
where he simmered (so to speak) between two blankets
for the best part of an hour. From this state of
inaction he was then recalled, shining very much and
roaring violently, to partake of -- well? I would rather
say, if you'll permit me to speak generally -- of a
slight repast. After which, he went to sleep again.
Mrs. Peerybingle took advantage of this interval, to
make herself as smart in a small way as ever you
saw anybody in all your life; and, during the same
short truce, Miss Slowboy insinuated herself into
a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious,
that it had no connection with herself, or anything
else in the universe, but was a shrunken, dog's-eared,
independent fact, pursuing its lonely course without
the least regard to anybody. By this time, the Baby,
being all alive again, was invested, by the united
efforts of Mrs. Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy, with
a cream-coloured mantle for its body, and a sort of -
nankeen raised-pie for its head; and so in course of
time they all three got down to the door, where the
old horse had already taken more than the full value
of his day's toll out of the Turnpike Trust, by tear-
ing up the road with his impatient autographs; and
whence Boxer might be dimly seen in the remote
perspective, standing looking back, and tempting him
to come on without orders.
<P>As to a chair, or anything of that kind for helping
Mrs. Peerybingle into the cart, you know very little
of John, if you think that was necessary. Before
you could have seen him lift her from the ground,
there she was in her place, fresh and rosy, saying,
'John! How can you! Think of Tilly!'
<P>If I might be allowed to mention a young lady's
legs, on any terms, I would observe of Miss Slow-
boy's that there was a fatality about them which ren-
dered them singularly liable to be grazed; and that
she never effected the smallest ascent or descent,
without recording the circumstance upon them with a
notch, as Robinson Crusoe marked the days upon
his wooden calendar. But as this might be considered
ungenteel, I'll think of it.
<P>'John? You've got the basket with the Veal and
Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer?' said
Dot. 'If you haven't you must turn round again,
this very minute.'
<P>'You're a nice little article,' returned the Carrier,
'to be talking about turning round, after keeping me
a full quarter of an hour behind my time.'
<P>'I am sorry for it, John,' said Dot in a great bustle,
'but I really could not think of going to Bertha's --
I would not do it, John, on any account -- without the
Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of
Beer. Way!'
<P>This monosyllable was addressed to the horse, who
didn't mind it at all.
<P>'Oh do way, John!' said Mrs. Peerybingle. 'Please!'
<P>'It'll be time enough to do that,' returned John,
'when I begin to leave things behind me. The basket's
here, safe enough.'
<P>'What a hard-hearted monster you must be, John,
not to have said so, at once, and save me such a
turn! I declared I wouldn't go to Bertha's without
the Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of
Beer, for any money. Regularly once a fortnight ever
since we have been married, John, have we made our
little Pic-Nic there. If anything was to go wrong
with it, I should almost think we were never to be
lucky again.'
<P>'It was a kind thought in the first instance,' said
the Carrier: 'and I honour you for it, little woman.'
<P>'My dear John,' replied Dot, turning very red,
'Don't talk about honouring me. Good Gracious!'
<P>'By the bye --' observed the Carrier. 'That old 
gentleman,' --
<P>Again so visibly, and instantly embarrassed!
<P>'He's an odd fish,' said the Carrier, looking straight
along the road before them. 'I can't make him out.
I don't believe there's any harm in him.'
<P>'None at all. I'm -- I'm sure there's none at all.'
<P>'Yes,' said the Carrier, with his eyes attracted to
her face by the great earnestness of her manner. 'I
am glad you feel so certain of it, because it's a con-
firmation to me. It's curious that he should have
taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging
with us; an't it? Things come about so strangely.'
<P>'So very strangely,' she rejoined in a low voice,
scarcely audible.
<P>'However, he's a good-natured old gentleman,'
said John, 'and pays as a gentleman, and I think his
word is to be relied upon, like a gentleman's. I had
quite a long talk with him this morning: he can hear
me better already, he says, as he gets more used to
my voice. He told me a great deal about himself,
and I told him a good deal about myself, and a rare 
lot of questions he asked me. I gave him information
about my having two beats, you know, in my busi-
ness; one day to the right from our house and back
again; another day to the left from our house and
back again (for he's a stranger and don't know the
names of places about here); and he seemed quite
pleased. "Why, then I shall be returning home to-
night your way," he says, "when I thought you'd be
coming in an exactly opposite direction. That's
capital! I may trouble you for another lift perhaps,
but I'll engage not to fall so sound asleep again."
He was sound asleep, sure-ly! -- Dot! what are you
thinking of?'
<P>'Thinking of, John? I -- I was listening to you.'
<P>'O! That's all right!' said the honest Carrier.
'I was afraid, from the look of your face, that I had
gone rambling on so long, as to set you thinking about
something else. I was very near it, I'll be bound.'
<P>Dot making no reply, they jogged on, for some
little time, in silence. But, it was not easy to remain
silent very long in John Peerybingle's cart, for, every-
body on the road had something to say. Though it
might only be 'How are you!' and indeed it was
very often nothing else, still, to give that back again
in the right spirit of cordiality, required, not merely
a nod and a smile, but as wholesome an action of the
lungs withal, as a long-winded Parliamentary speech.
Sometimes, passengers on foot, or horseback, plodded
on a little way beside the cart, for the express pur-
pose of having a chat; and then there was a great
deal to be said, on both sides.
<P>Then, Boxer gave occasion to more good-natured
recognitions of, and by, the Carrier, than half a dozen
Christians could have done! Everybody knew him,
all along the road -- especially the fowls and pigs,
who when they saw him approaching, with his body
all on one side, and his ears pricked up inquisitively,
and that knob of a tail making the most of itself in
the air, immediately withdrew into remote back settle-
ments, without waiting for the honour of a nearer
acquaintance. He had business everywhere; going
down all the turnings, looking into all the wells, bolt-
ing in and out of all the cottages, dashing into the
midst of all the Dame-Schools, fluttering all the
pigeons, magnifying the tails of all the cats, and trot-
ting into the public-houses like a regular customer.
Wherever he went, somebody or other might have
been heard to cry, 'Halloa! Here's Boxer!' and out
came that somebody forthwith, accompanied by at
least two or three other somebodies, to give John
Peerybingle and his pretty wife, Good-Day.
<P>The packages and parcels for the errand cart, were
numerous; and there were many stoppages to take
them in and give them out, which were not by any
means the worst parts of the journey. Some people
were so full of expectation about their parcels, and
other people were so full of wonder about their
parcels, and other people were so full of inexhaustible
directions about their parcels, and John had such a
lively interest in all the parcels, that it was as good
as a play. Likewise, there were articles to carry,
which required to be considered and discussed, and in
reference to the adjustment and disposition of which,
councils had to be holden by the Carrier and the
senders: at which Boxer usually assisted, in short fits
of the closest attention, and long fits of tearing round
and round the assembled sages and barking himself
hoarse. Of all these little incidents, Dot was the
amused and open-eyed spectatress from her chair in
the cart; and as she sat there, looking on -- a charm-
ing little portrait framed to admiration by the tilt --
there was no lack of nudgings and glancings and
whisperings and envyings among the younger men.
And this delighted John the Carrier, beyond measure;
for he was proud to have his little wife admired,
knowing that she didn't mind it -- that, if anything,
she rather liked it perhaps.
<P>The trip was a little foggy, to be sure, in the Jan-
uary weather; and was raw and cold. But who cared
for such trifles? Not Dot, decidedly. Not Tilly
Slowboy, for she deemed sitting in a cart, on any
terms, to be the highest point of human joys; the
crowning circumstance of earthly hopes. Not the
Baby, I'll be sworn; for it's not in Baby nature to be
warmer or more sound asleep, though its capacity is
great in both respects, than that blessed young Peery-
bingle was, all the way.
<P>You couldn't see very far in the fog, of course: but
you could see a great deal! It's astonishing how
much you may see, in a thicker fog than that, if you
will only take the trouble to look for it. Why, even
to sit watching for the Fairy-rings in the fields, and
for the patches of hoar-frost still lingering in the
shade, near hedges and by trees, was a pleasant occu-
pation: to make no mention of the unexpected shapes
in which the trees themselves came starting out of the
mist and glided into it again. The hedges were
tangled and bare, and waved a multitude of blighted
garlands in the wind; but, there was no discourage-
ment in this. It was agreebale to contemplate; for,
it made the fireside warmer in possession, and the
summer greener in expectancy. The river looked
chilly; but it was in motion, and moving at a good
pace -- which was a great point. The canal was rather
slow and torpid; that must be admitted. Never mind.
It would freeze the sooner when the frost set fairly
in, and then there would be skating, and sliding; and
the heavy old barges, frozen up somewhere near a
wharf, would smoke their rusty iron chimney pipes
all day, and have a lazy time of it.
<P>In one place, there was a great mount of weeds or
stubble burning; and they watched the fire, so white
in the day time, flaring through the fog, with only
here and there a dash of red in it, until, in consequence
as she observed of the smoke 'getting up her nose,'
Miss Slowboy choked -- she could do anything of that
sort, on the smallest provocation -- and woke the
Baby, who wouldn't go to sleep again. But, Boxer,
who was in advance some quarter of a mile or so,
had already passed the outposts of the town, and
gained the corner of the street where Caleb and his
daughter lived; and long before they had reached the
door, he and the Blind Girl were on the pavement
waiting to receive them.
<P>Boxer, by the way, made certain delicate distinc-
tions of his own, in his communication with Bertha
which persuade me fully that he knew her to be blind.
He never sought to attract her attention by looking
at her, as he often did with other people, but touched
her invariably. What experience he could ever have
had of blind people or blind dogs, I don't know
He had never lived with a blind master; nor had Mr.
Boxer the elder, nor Mrs. Boxer, nor any of his re-
spectable family on either side, ever been visited with
blindness, that I am aware of. He may have found
it out for himself, perhaps, but he had got hold of it
somehow; and therefore he had hold of Bertha too,
by the skirt, and kept hold, until Mrs. Peerybingle
and the Baby, and Miss Slowboy, and the basket,
were all got safely within doors.
<P>May Fielding was already come; and so was her
mother -- a little querulous chip of an old lady with a
peevish face, who, in right of having preserved a
waist like a bedpost, was supposed to be a most tran-
scendent figure; and who, in consequence of having
once been better of, or of labouring under an impres-
sion that she might have been, if something had hap-
pened which never did happen, and seemed to have
never been particularly likely to come to pass -- but
it's all the same -- was very genteel and patronising
indeed. Gruff and Tackleton was also there, doing
the agreeable, with the evident sensation of being as
perfectly at home, and as unquestionably in his own
element, as a fresh young salmon on the top of the
Great Pyramid.
<P>'May! My dear old friend!' cried Dot, running
up to meet her. 'What a happiness to see you.'
<P>Her old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as
glad as she; and it really was, if you'll believe me,
quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace. Tackle-
ton was a man of taste, beyond all question. May
was very pretty.
<P>You know sometimes, when you are used to a
pretty face, how, when it comes into contact and com-
parison with another pretty face, it seems for the mo-
ment to be homely and faded, and hardly to deserve
the high opinion you have had of it. Now, this was
not at all the case, either with Dot or May; for May's
face set off Dot's, and Dot's face set off May's, so
naturally and agreeably, that, as John Peerybingle
was very near saying when he came into the room,
they ought to have been born sisters -- which was the
only improvement you could have suggested.
<P>Tackleton had brought his leg of mutton, and,
wonderful to relate, a tart beside -- but we don't mind
a little dissipation when our brides are in the case;
we don't get married every day -- and in addition to
these dainties, there were the Veal and Ham-Pie, and
'things,' as Mrs. Peerybingle called them; which were
chiefly nuts and oranges, and cakes, and such small
deer. When the repast was set forth on the board,
flanked by Caleb's contribution, which was a great
wooden bowl of smoking potatoes (he was prohibited,
by solemn compact, from producing any other viands),
Tackleton led his intended mother-in-law to the post
of honour. For the better gracing of this place at
the high festival, the majestic old soul had adorned
herself with a cap, calculated to inspire the thought-
less with sentiments of awe. She also wore her gloves.
But let us be genteel, or die!
<P>Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot and her old school-
fellow were side by side; the good Carrier took care
of the bottom of the table. Miss Slowboy was iso-
lated, for the time being, from every article of fur-
niture but the chair she sat on, that she might have
nothing else to knock the Baby's head against.
<P>As Tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys, they
stared at her and at the company. The venerable old
gentlemen at the street-doors (who were all in full
action) showed especial interest in the party, pausing
occasionally before leaping, as if they were listening
to the conversation, and then plunging wildly over
and over, a great many times, without halting for
breath -- as in a frantic state of delight with the whole
proceedings.
<P>Certainly, if these old gentlemen were inclined to
have a fiendish joy in the contemplation of Tackle-
ton's discomfiture, they had good reason to be satis-
fied. Tackleton couldn't get on at all; and the more
cheerful his intended bride became in Dot's society,
the less he liked it, though he had brought them to-
gether for that purpose. For he was a regular dog
in the manger, was Tackleton; and when they laughed
and he couldn't, he took it into his head, immediately,
that they must be laughing at him.
<P>'Ah May!' said Dot. 'Dear, dear, what changes!
To talk of those merry school-days makes one young
again.'
<P>'Why, you an't particularly old, at any time; are
you?' said Tackleton.
<P>'Look at my sober plodding husband there,' re-
turned Dot. 'He adds twenty years to my age at
least. Don't you, John?'
<P>'Forty,' John replied.
<P>'How many you'll add to May's, I'm sure I don't
know,' said Dot, laughing. 'But she can't be much
less than a hundred years of age on her next birth-
day.'
<P>'Ha ho!' laughed Tackleton. Hollow as a drum,
that laugh though. And he looked as if he could
have twisted Dot's neck, comfortably.
<P>'Dear dear!' said Dot. 'Only to remember how
we used to talk, at school, about the husbands we
would choose. I don't know how young, and how
handsome, and how gay, and how lively, mine was
not to be! And as to May's -- Ah dear! I don't know
whether to laugh or cry, when I think what silly
girls we were.'
<P>May seemed to know which to do; for the colour
flushed into her face, and tears stood in her eyes.
<P>'Even the very persons themselves -- real live young
men -- were fixed on sometimes,' said Dot. 'We little
thought how things would come about. I never fixed
on John I'm sure; I never so much as thought of
him. And if I had told you, you were ever to be
married to Mr. Tackleton, why you'd have slapped
me. Wouldn't you, May?'
<P>Though May didn't say yes, she certainly didn't
say no, or express no, by any means.
<P>Tackleton laughed -- quite shouted, he laughed so
loud. John Peerybingle laughed too, in his ordinary
good-natured and contented manner; but his was a
mere whisper of a laugh, to Tackleton's.
<P>'You couldn't help yourselves for all that. You
couldn't resist us, you see,' said Tackleton. 'Here we
are! Here we are! Where are your gay young bride-
grooms now!'
<P>'Some of them are dead,' said Dot; 'and some of
them forgotten. Some of them, if they could stand
among us at this moment, would not believe we were
the same creatures; would not believe that what they
saw and heard was real, and we could forget them so.
No! they would not believe one word of it!'
<P>'Why, Dot! exclaimed the Carrier. 'Little woman!'
<P>She had spoken with such earnestness and fire, that
she stood in need of some recalling to herself, without
doubt. Her husband's check was very gentle, for he
merely interfered, as he supposed, to shield old Tack-
leton; but it proved effectual, for she stopped, and
said no more. There was an uncommon agitation,
even in her silence, which the wary Tackleton, who
had brought his half-shut eye to bear upon her, noted
closely, and remembered to some purpose too.
<P>May uttered no word, good or bad, but sat quite
still, with her eyes cast down, and made no sign of
interest in what had passed. The good lady her
mother now interposed, observing, in the first in-
stance, that girls were girls, and byegones byegones,
and that so long as young people were young and
thoughtless, they would probably conduct themselves
like young and thoughtless persons: with two or three
other positions of a no less sound and incontrovertible
character. She then remarked, in a devout spirit,
that she thanked Heaven she had always found in
her daughter May, a dutiful and obedient child;
for which she took no credit to herself, though sho
had every reason to believe it was entirely owing
to herself. With regard to Mr. Tackleton she said,
That he was in a moral point of view an undeniable
individual, and That he was in an eligible point of
view a son-in-law to be desired, no one in their senses
could doubt. (She was very emphatic here.) With
regard to the family into which he was so soon about,
after some solicitation, to be admitted, she believed
Mr. Tackleton knew that, although reduced in purse,
it had some pretensions to gentility; and if certain
circumstances, not wholly unconnected, she would go
so far as to say, with the Indigo Trade, but to which
she would not more particularly refer, had happened
differently, it might perhaps have been in possession
of wealth. She then remarked that she would not
allude to the past, and would not mention that her
daughter had for some time rejected the suit of Mr.
Tackleton; and that she would not say a great many
other things which she did say, at great length.
Finally, she delivered it as the general result of her
observation and experience, that those marriages in
which there was least of what was romantically and
sillily called love, were always the happiest; and that
she anticipated the greatest possible amount of bliss --
not rapturous bliss; but the solid, steady-going article
from the approaching nuptials. She concluded by
informing the company that to-morrow was the day
she had lived for, expressly; and that when it was
over, she wuld desire nothing better than to be
packed up and disposed of, in any genteel place of
burial.
<P>As these remarks were quite unanswerable -- which
is the happy property of all remarks that are suffi-
ciently wide of the purpose -- they changed the cur-
rent of the conversation, and diverted the general
attention to the Veal and Ham-Pie, the cold mutton,
the potatoes, and the tart. In order that the bottled
beer might not be slighted, John Peerybingle pro-
posed To-morrow: the Wedding-Day; and called
upon them to drink a bumper to it, before he pro-
ceeded on his journey.
<P>For you ought to know that he only rested there,
and gave the old horse a bait. He had to go some
four or five miles farther on; and when he returned
in the evening, he called for Dot, and took another
rest on his way home. This was the order of the day
on all the Pic-Nic occasions, and had been, ever since
their institution.
<P>There were two persons present, beside the bride
and bridegroom elect, who did but indifferent honour
to the toast. One of these was Dot, too flushed and
discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence
of the moment; the other, Bertha, who rose up hur-
riedly, before the rest, and left the table.
<P>'Good-bye!' said stout John Peerybingle, pulling
on his dreadnought coat. 'I shall be back at the old
time. Good bye all!'
<P>'Good-bye, John,' returned Caleb.
<P>He seemed to say it by rote, and to wave his hand
in the same unconscious manner; for he stood observ-
ing Bertha with an anxious wondering face, that
never altered its expression.
<P>'Good-bye, young shaver!' said the jolly Carrier, 
bending down to kiss the child; which Tilly Slowboy,
now intent upon her knife and fork, had deposited
asleep (and strange to say, without damage) in a
little cot of Bertha's furnishing; 'good-bye! Time
will come, I suppose, when you'll turn out into the
cold, my little friend, and leave your old father to
enjoy his pipe and his rheumatics in the chimney-
corner; eh? Where's Dot?'
<P>'I'm here, John!' she said, starting.
<P>'Come, come!' returned the Carrier, clapping his
sounding hands. 'Where's the pipe?'
<P>'I quite forgot the pipe, John.'
<P>'Forgot the pipe! Was such a wonder ever heard
of! She! Forgot the pipe!'
<P>'I'll -- I'll fill it directly. It's soon done.'
<P>But it was not so soon done, either. It lay in the
usual place -- the Carrier's dreadnought pocket -- with
the little pouch, her own work, from which she was
used to fill it; but her hand shook so, that she en-
tangled it (and yet her hand was small enough to
have come out easily, I am sure), and bungled ter-
ribly. The filling of the pipe and lighting it, those
little offices in which I have commended her discre-
tion, were vilely done, from first to last. During the
whole process, Tackleton stood looking on maliciously
with the half-closed eye; which, whenever it met hers
-- or caught it, for it can hardly be said to have ever
met another eye: rather being a kind of trap to snatch
it up -- augmented her confusion in a most remark-
able degree.
<P>'Why, what a clumsy Dot you are, this afternoon!'
said John. 'I could have done it better myself, I
verily believe!'
<P>With these good-natured words, he strode away,
and presently was heard, in company with Boxer, and
the old horse, and the cart, making lively music down
the road. What time the dreamy Caleb still stood,
watching his blind daughter, with the same expres-
sion on his face.
<P>'Bertha!' said Caleb, softly. 'What has happened?
How changed you are, my darling, in a few hours --
since this morning. You silent and dull all day!
What is it? Tell me!'
<P>'Oh father, father!' cried the Blind Girl, bursting
into tears. 'Oh my hard, hard fate!'
<P>Caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he an-
swered her.
<P>'But think how cheerful and how happy you have
been, Bertha! How good, and how much loved, by
many people.'
<P>'That strikes me to the heart, dear father! Always
so mindful of me! Always so kind to me!'
<P>Caleb was very much perplexed to understand her.
<P>'To be -- to be blind, Bertha, my poor dear,' he
faltered, 'is a great affliction; but --'
<P>'I have never felt it!' cried the Blind Girl. 'I have
never felt it, in its fulness. Never! I have some-
times wished that I could see you, or could see him
-- only once, dear father, only for one little minute --
that I might know what it is I treasure up,' she laid
her hands upon her breast, 'and hold here! That I
might be sure and have it right! And sometimes
(but then I was a child) I have wept in my prayers at
night, to think that when your images ascended from
my heart to Heaven, they might not be the true re-
semblance of yourselves. But I have never had these
feelings long. They have passed away and left me
tranquil and contented.'
<P>'And they will again,' said Caleb.
<P>'But father! Oh my good, gentle father, bear with
me, if I am wicked!' said the Blind Girl. 'This is
not the sorrow that so weighs me down!'
<P>Her father could not choose but let his moist eyes
overflow; she was so earnest and pathetic, but he did
not understand her, yet.
<P>'Bring her to me,' said Bertha. 'I cannot hold it
closed and shut within myself. Bring her to me,
father!'
<P>She knew he hesitated, and said, 'May. Bring
May!'
<P>May heard the mention of her name, and coming
quietly towards her, touched her on the arm. The
Blind Girl turned immediately, and held her by both
hands.
<P>'Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!' said
Bertha. 'Read it with your beautiful eyes, and tell
me if the truth is written on it.'
<P>'Dear Bertha, Yes!'
<P>The Blind Girl still, upturning the blank sightless
face, down which the tears were coursing fast, ad-
dressed her in these words:
<P>'There is not, in my soul, a wish or thought that is
not for your good, bright May! There is not, in my
soul, a grateful recollection stronger than the deep
remembrance which is stored there, of the many many
times when, in the full pride of sight and beauty,
you have had consideration for Blind Bertha, even
when we two were children, or when Bertha was as
much a child as ever blindness can be! Every bless-
ing on your head! Light upon your happy course!
Not the less, my dear May'; and she drew towards
her, in a closer grasp; 'not the less, my bird, because,
to-day, the knowledge that you are to be His wife has
wrung my heart almost to breaking! Father, May,
Mary! oh forgive me that it is so, for the sake of all
he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life:
and for the sake of the belief you have in me, when I
call Haven to witness that I could not wish him
married to a wife more worthy of his goodness!'
<P>While speaking, she had released May Fielding's
hands, and clasped her garments in an attitude of
mingled supplication and love. Sinking lower and
lower down, as she proceeded in her strange confes-
sion, she dropped at last at the feet of her friend, and
hid her blind face in the folds of her dress.
<P>'Great Power!' exclaimed her father, smitten at one
blow with the truth, 'have I deceived her from her
cradle, but to break her heart at last!'
<P>It was well for all of them that Dot, that beaming,
useful, busy little Dot -- for such she was, whatever
faults she had, and however you may learn to hate
her, in good time -- it was well for all of them, I say,
that she was there: or where this would have ended,
it were hard to tell. But Dot, recovering her self-
possession, interposed, before May could reply, or
Caleb say another word.
<P>'Come come, dear Bertha! come away with me!
Give her your arm, May. So! How composed she
is, you see, already; and how good it is of her to
mind us,' said the cheery little woman, kissing her
upon the forehead. 'Come away, dear Bertha. Come!
and here's her good father will come with her; won't
you, Caleb? To -- be -- sure!'
<P>Well, well! she was a noble little Dot in such
things, and it must have been an obdurate nature that
could have withstood her influence. When she had
got poor Caleb and his Bertha away, that they might
comfort and console each other, as she knew they only
could, she presently came bouncing back, -- the saying
is, as fresh as any daisy; I say fresher -- to mount
guard over that bridling little piece of consequence
in the cap and gloves, and prevent the dear old crea-
ture from making discoveries.
<P>'So bring me the precious Baby, Tilly,' said she
drawing a chair to the fire; 'and while I have it in
my lap, here's Mrs. Fielding, Tilly, will tell me all
about the management of Babies, and put me right
in twenty points where I'm as wrong as can be
Won't you, Mrs. Fielding~'
<P>Not even the Welsh Giant, who according to the
popular expression, was so 'slow' as to perform a fatal
surgical operation upon himself, in emulation of a
juggling-trick achieved by his arch-enemy at break-
fast-time; not even he fell half so readily into the
snare prepared for him, as the old lady did into this
artful pitfall. The fact of Tackleton having walked
out; and furthermore, of two or three people having
been talking together at a distance, for two minutes,
leaving her to her own resources; was quite enough to
have put her on her dignity, and the bewailment of
that mysterious convulsion in the Indigo trade, for
four-and-twenty hours. But this becoming deference
to her experience, on the part of the young mother;
was so irresistible, that after a short affectation of
humility, she began to enlighten her with the best
grace in the world; and sitting bolt upright before the
wicked Dot, she did, half an hour, deliver more in-
fallible domestic recipes and precepts, that would (if
acted on) have utterly destroyed and done up that
Young Peerybingle, though he had been an Infant
Samson.
<P>To change the theme, Dot did a little needlework --
she carried the contents of a whole workbox in her
pocket; however she contrived it, I don't know -- then
did a little nursing; then a little more needlework;
then had a little whispering chat with May, while the
old lady dozed; and so in little bits of bustle, which
was quite her manner always, found it a very short
afternoon. Then, as it grew dark, and as it was a
solemn part of this Institution of the Pic-Nic that she
should perform all Bertha's household tasks, she
trimmed the fire, and swept the hearth, and set the
tea-board out, and drew the curtain, and lighted a
candle. Then she played an air or two on a rude
kind of harp, which Caleb had contrived for Bertha,
and played them very well; for Nature had made her
delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it
would have been for jewels, if she had had any to
wear. By this time it was the established hour for
having tea; and Tackleton came back again, to share
the meal, and spend the evening.
<P>Caleb and Bertha had returned some time before,
and Caleb had sat down to his afternoon's work.
But he couldn't settle to it, poor fellow, being anxious
and remorseful for his daughter. It was touching to
see him sitting idle on his working-stool, regarding
her so wistfully, and always saying in his face, 'Have
I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her
Heart!'
<P>When it was night, and tea was done, and Dot had
nothing more to do in washing up the cups and sau-
cers; in a word -- for I must come to it, and there is
no use in putting it off -- when the time drew nigh for
expecting the Carrier's return in every sound of dis-
tant wheels, her manner changed again, her colour
came and went, and she was very restless. Not as
good wives are, when listening for their husbands.
No, no, no. It was another sort of restlessness from
that.
<P>Wheels heard. A horse's feet. The barking of a
dog. The gradual approach of all the sounds. The
scratching paw of Boxer at the door!
<P>'Whose step is that!' cried Bertha, starting up.
<P>'Whose step?' returned the Carrier, standing in the
portal, with his browr face ruddy as a winter berry
from the keen night air. 'Why, mine.'
<P>'The other step,' said Bertha. 'The man's tread
behind you!'
<P>'She is not to be deceived,' observed the Carrier,
laughing. 'Come along, sir. You'll be welcome
never fear!'
<P>He spoke in a loud tone; and as he spoke, the deaf
old gentleman entered.
<P>He's not so much a stranger, that you haven't seen
him once, Caleb,' said the Carrier. 'You give him
house-room till we go?'
<P>'Oh surely, John, and take it as an honour.'
<P>'He's the best company on earth, to talk secrets in,'
said John. 'I have reasonable good lungs, but he
tries 'em, I can tell you. Sit down, sir. All friends
here, and glad to see you!'
<P>When he had imparted this assurance, in a voice
that amply corroborated what he had said about his
lungs, he added in his natural tone, 'A chair in the
chimney-corner, and leave to sit quite silent and look
pleasantly about him, is all he cares for. He's easily
pleased.'
<P>Bertha had been listening intently. She called
Caleb to her side, when he had set the chair, and
asked him, in a low voice, to describe their visitor.
When he had done so (truly now: with scrupulous
fidelity), she moved, for the first time since he had
come in, and sighed, and seemed to have no further
interest concerning him.
<P>The Carrier was in high spirits, good fellow that
he was, and fonder of his little wife than ever.
<P>'A clumsy Dot she was, this afternoon!' he said,
encircling her with his rough arm, as she stood, re-
moved from the rest; 'and yet I like her somehow.
See yonder, Dot!'
<P>He pointed to the old man. She looked down. I
think she trembled.
<P>'He's -- ha ha ha! -- he's full of admiration for you!'
said the Carrier. 'Talked of nothing else, the whole
way here. Why, he's a brave old boy. I like him
for it!'
<P>'I wish he had had a better subject, John,' she
said, with an uneasy glance about the room. At
Tackleton especially.
<P>'A better subject!' cried the jovial John. 'There's
no such thing. Come, off with the great-coat, off
with the thick shawl, off with the heavy wrappers!
and a cosy half-hour by the fire! My humble service,
Mistress. A game at cribbage, you and I? That's
hearty. The cards and board, Dot. And a glass of
beer here, if there's any left, small wife!'
<P>His challenge was addressed to the old lady, who
accepting it with gracious readiness, they were soon
engaged upon the game. At first, the Carrier looked
about him sometimes, with a smile, or now and then
called Dot to peep over his shoulder at his hand,
and advise him on some knotty point. But his ad-
versary being a rigid disciplinarian, and subject to
an occasional weakness in respect of pegging more
than she was entitled to, required such vigilance on
his part, as left him neither eyes nor ears to spare.
Thus, his whole attention gradually became absorbed
upon the cards; and he thought of nothing else, until
a hand upon his shoulder restored him to a conscious-
ness of Tackleton.
<P>'I am sorry to disturb you -- but a word, directly.'
<P>'I'm going to deal,' returned the Carrier. 'It's a
crisis.'
<P>'It is,' said Tackleton. 'Come here, man!'
<P>There was that in his pale face which made the
other rise immediately, and ask him, in a hurry, what
the matter was.
<P>'Hush! John Peerybingle,' said Tackleton. 'I am
sorry for this. I am indeed. I have been afraid of
it. I have suspected it from the first.'
<P>'What is it?' asked the Carrier, with a frightened
aspect.
<P>'Hush! I'll show you, if you'll come with me.'
<P>The Carrier accompanied him, without another
word. They went across a yard, where the stars were
shining, and by a little side-door, into Tackleton's
own counting-house, where there was a glass window
commanding the ware-room, which was closed for
the night. There was no light in the counting-house
itself, but there were lamps in the long narrow ware-
room; and consequently the window was bright.
<P>'A moment! ' said Tackleton. 'Can you bear to
look through that window, do you think?'
<P>'Why not?' returned the Carrier.
<P>'A moment more,' said Tackleton. 'Don't commit
any violence. It's of no use. It's dangerous too.
You're a strong-made man; and you might do mur-
der before you know it.'
<P>The carrier looked him in the face. and recoiled a
step as if he had been struck. In one stride he was
at the window, and he saw --
<P>Oh Shadow on the Hearth! Oh truthful Cricket!
Oh perfidious Wife!
<P>He saw her, with the oId man -- old no longer, but
erect and gallant -- bearing in his hand the false white
hair that had won his way into their desolate and
miserable home. He saw her listening to him, as he
bent his head to whisper in her ear; and suffering
him to clasp her round the waist, as they moved
slowly down the dim wooden gallery towards the door
by which they had entered it. He saw them stop,
and saw her turn -- to have the face, the face he loved
so, so presented to his view! -- and saw her, with her
own hands, adjust the lie upon his head, laughing,
as she did it, at his unsuspicious nature!
<P>He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if
it would have beaten down a lion. But opening it
immediately again, he spread it out before the eyes
of Tackleton (for he was tender of her, even then),
and so, as they passed out, fell down upon a desk,
and was as weak as any infant.
<P>He was wrapped up to the chin, and busy with
his horse and parcels, when she came into the room,
prepared for going home.
<P>'Now John, dear! Good night May! Good night
Bertha!'
<P>Could she kiss them? Could she be blithe and
cheerful in her parting? Could she venture to re-
veal her face to them without a blush? Yes. Tackle-
ton observed her closely, and she did all this.
<P>Tilly was hushing the Baby, and she crossed and
re-crossed Tackleton, a dozen times, repeating
drowsily:
<P>'Did the knowledge that it was to be its wifes, then,
wring its hearts almost to breaking; and did its
fathers deceive it from its cradles but to break its
hearts at last!'
<P>'Now Tilly, give me the Baby! Good-night, Mr.
Tackleton. Where's John, for goodness' sake?'
<P>'He's going to walk, beside the horse's head,' said
Tackleton; who helped her to her seat.
<P>'My dear John. Walk? To-night?'
<P>The muffled figure of her husband made a hasty
sign in the affirmative; and the false stranger and
the little nurse being in their places, the old horse
moved off. Boxer, the unconscious Boxer, running
on before, running back, running round and round
the cart, and barking as triumphantly and merrily
as ever.
<P>When Tackleton had gone off likewise, escorting
May and her mother home, poor Caleb sat down
by the fire beside his daughter; anxious and remorse-
ful at the core; and still saying in his wistful con-
templation of her, 'Have I deceived her from her
cradle, but to break her heart at last!'
<P>The toys that had been set in motion for the Baby,
had all stopped, and run down, long ago. In the
faint light and silence, the imperturbably calm dolls,
the agitated rocking-horses with distended eyes and
nostrils, the old gentlemen at the street-doors, stand-
ing half doubled up upon their failing knees and
ankles, the wry-faced nut-crackers, the very Beasts
upon their way into the Ark, in twos, like a Boarding
School out walking, might have been imagined to
be stricken motionless with fantastic wonder, at Dot
being false, or Tackleton beloved, under any com-
bination of circumstances.
