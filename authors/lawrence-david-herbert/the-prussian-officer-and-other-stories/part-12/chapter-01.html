<p>The small locomotive engine, Number 4, came clanking, stumbling
down from Selston - with seven full waggons.  It appeared round the
corner with loud threats of speed, but the colt that it startled
from among the gorse, which still flickered indistinctly in the raw
afternoon, outdistanced it at a canter.  A woman, walking up the
railway line to Underwood, drew back into the hedge, held her
basket aside, and watched the footplate of the engine advancing.
The trucks thumped heavily past, one by one, with slow inevitable
movement, as she stood insignificantly trapped between the jolting
black waggons and the hedge; then they curved away towards the
coppice where the withered oak leaves dropped noiselessly, while
the birds, pulling at the scarlet hips beside the track, made off
into the dusk that had already crept into the spinney.  In the
open, the smoke from the engine sank and cleaved to the rough
grass.  The fields were dreary and forsaken, and in the marshy
strip that led to the whimsey, a reedy pit-pond, the fowls had
already abandoned their run among the alders, to roost in the
tarred fowl-house.  The pit-bank loomed up beyond the pond, flames
like red sores licking its ashy sides, in the afternoon's stagnant
light.  Just beyond rose the tapering chimneys and the clumsy black
head-stocks of Brinsley Colliery.  The two wheels were spinning
fast up against the sky, and the winding-engine rapped out its
little spasms.  The miners were being turned up.</p>

<p>The engine whistled as it came into the wide bay of railway lines
beside the colliery, where rows of trucks stood in harbour.</p>

<p>Miners, single, trailing and in groups, passed like shadows
diverging home.  At the edge of the ribbed level of sidings squat a
low cottage, three steps down from the cinder track.  A large bony
vine clutched at the house, as if to claw down the tiled roof.
Round the bricked yard grew a few wintry primroses.  Beyond, the
long garden sloped down to a bush-covered brook course.  There were
some twiggy apple trees, winter-crack trees, and ragged cabbages.
Beside the path hung dishevelled pink chrysanthemums, like pink
cloths hung on bushes.  A woman came stooping out of the felt-
covered fowl-house, half-way down the garden.  She closed and
padlocked the door, then drew herself erect, having brushed some
bits from her white apron.</p>

<p>She was a till woman of imperious mien, handsome, with definite
black eyebrows.  Her smooth black hair was parted exactly.  For a
few moments she stood steadily watching the miners as they passed
along the railway: then she turned towards the brook course.  Her
face was calm and set, her mouth was closed with disillusionment.
After a moment she called:</p>

<p>&quot;John!&quot;  There was no answer.  She waited, and then said distinctly:</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here!&quot; replied a child's sulky voice from among the bushes.  The
woman looked piercingly through the dusk.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you at that brook?&quot; she asked sternly.</p>

<p>For answer the child showed himself before the raspberry-canes that
rose like whips.  He was a small, sturdy boy of five.  He stood
quite still, defiantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said the mother, conciliated.  &quot;I thought you were down at
that wet brook - and you remember what I told you - &quot;</p>

<p>The boy did not move or answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come on in,&quot; she said more gently, &quot;it's getting dark.
There's your grandfather's engine coming down the line!&quot;</p>

<p>The lad advanced slowly, with resentful, taciturn movement.  He was
dressed in trousers and waistcoat of cloth that was too thick and
hard for the size of the garments.  They were evidently cut down
from a man's clothes.</p>

<p>As they went slowly towards the house he tore at the ragged wisps
of chrysanthemums and dropped the petals in handfuls along the
path.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't do that - it does look nasty,&quot; said his mother.  He
refrained, and she, suddenly pitiful, broke off a twig with three
or four wan flowers and held them against her face.  When mother
and son reached the yard her hand hesitated, and instead of laying
the flower aside, she pushed it in her apron-band.  The mother and
son stood at the foot of the three steps looking across the bay of
lines at the passing home of the miners.  The trundle of the small
train was imminent.  Suddenly the engine loomed past the house and
came to a stop opposite the gate.</p>

<p>The engine-driver, a short man with round grey beard, leaned out of
the cab high above the woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you got a cup of tea?&quot; he said in a cheery, hearty fashion.</p>

<p>It was her father.  She went in, saying she would mash.  Directly,
she returned.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't come to see you on Sunday,&quot; began the little grey-bearded
man.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't expect you,&quot; said his daughter.</p>

<p>The engine-driver winced; then, reassuming his cheery, airy manner,
he said:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, have you heard then?  Well, and what do you think - ?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it is soon enough,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p>At her brief censure the little man made an impatient gesture, and
said coaxingly, yet with dangerous coldness:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what's a man to do?  It's no sort of life for a man of my
years, to sit at my own hearth like a stranger.  And if I'm going
to marry again it may as well be soon as late - what does it matter
to anybody?&quot;</p>

<p>The woman did not reply, but turned and went into the house.  The
man in the engine-cab stood assertive, till she returned with a cup
of tea and a piece of bread and butter on a plate.  She went up the
steps and stood near the footplate of the hissing engine.</p>

<p>&quot;You needn't 'a' brought me bread an' butter,&quot; said her father.
&quot;But a cup of tea&quot; - he sipped appreciatively - &quot;it's very nice.&quot;  He
sipped for a moment or two, then:  &quot;I hear as Walter's got another
bout on,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;When hasn't he?&quot; said the woman bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;I heered tell of him in the 'Lord Nelson' braggin' as he was going
to spend that b -  -  afore he went: half a sovereign that was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot; asked the woman.</p>

<p>&quot;A' Sat'day night - I know that's true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very likely,&quot; she laughed bitterly.  &quot;He gives me twenty-three
shillings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, it's a nice thing, when a man can do nothing with his money
but make a beast of himself!&quot; said the grey-whiskered man.  The
woman turned her head away.  Her father swallowed the last of his
tea and handed her the cup.</p>

<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; he sighed, wiping his mouth.  &quot;It's a settler, it is - &quot;</p>

<p>He put his hand on the lever.  The little engine strained and
groaned, and the train rumbled towards the crossing.  The woman
again looked across the metals.  Darkness was settling over the
spaces of the railway and trucks: the miners, in grey sombre
groups, were still passing home.  The winding-engine pulsed
hurriedly, with brief pauses.  Elizabeth Bates looked at the dreary
flow of men, then she went indoors.  Her husband did not come.</p>

<p>The kitchen was small and full of firelight; red coals piled
glowing up the chimney mouth.  All the life of the room seemed in
the white, warm hearth and the steel fender reflecting the red
fire.  The cloth was laid for tea; cups glinted in the shadows.  At
the back, where the lowest stairs protruded into the room, the boy
sat struggling with a knife and a piece of whitewood.  He was
almost hidden in the shadow.  It was half-past four.  They had but
to await the father's coming to begin tea.  As the mother watched
her son's sullen little struggle with the wood, she saw herself in
his silence and pertinacity; she saw the father in her child's
indifference to all but himself.  She seemed to be occupied by her
husband.  He had probably gone past his home, slunk past his own
door, to drink before he came in, while his dinner spoiled and
wasted in waiting.  She glanced at the clock, then took the
potatoes to strain them in the yard.  The garden and fields beyond
the brook were closed in uncertain darkness.  When she rose with
the saucepan, leaving the drain steaming into the night behind her,
she saw the yellow lamps were lit along the high road that went up
the hill away beyond the space of the railway lines and the field.</p>

<p>Then again she watched the men trooping home, fewer now and fewer.</p>

<p>Indoors the fire was sinking and the room was dark red.  The woman
put her saucepan on the hob, and set a batter pudding near the
mouth of the oven.  Then she stood unmoving.  Directly, gratefully,
came quick young steps to the door.  Someone hung on the latch a
moment, then a little girl entered and began pulling off her
outdoor things, dragging a mass of curls, just ripening from gold
to brown, over her eyes with her hat.</p>

<p>Her mother chid her for coming late from school, and said she would
have to keep her at home the dark winter days.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, mother, it's hardly a bit dark yet.  The lamp's not lighted,
and my father's not home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he isn't.  But it's a quarter to five!  Did you see anything
of him?&quot;</p>

<p>The child became serious.  She looked at her mother with large,
wistful blue eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;No, mother, I've never seen him.  Why?  Has he come up an' gone
past, to Old Brinsley?  He hasn't, mother, 'cos I never saw him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He'd watch that,&quot; said the mother bitterly, &quot;he'd take care as you
didn't see him.  But you may depend upon it, he's seated in the
'Prince o' Wales'.  He wouldn't be this late.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl looked at her mother piteously.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's have our teas, mother, should we?&quot; said she.</p>

<p>The mother called John to table.  She opened the door once more and
looked out across the darkness of the lines.  All was deserted: she
could not hear the winding-engines.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;he's stopped to get some ripping
done.&quot;</p>

<p>They sat down to tea.  John, at the end of the table near the door,
was almost lost in the darkness.  Their faces were hidden from each
other.  The girl crouched against the fender slowly moving a thick
piece of bread before the fire.  The lad, his face a dusky mark on
the shadow, sat watching her who was transfigured in the red glow.</p>

<p>&quot;I do think it's beautiful to look in the fire,&quot; said the child.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you?&quot; said her mother.  &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's so red, and full of little caves - and it feels so nice, and
you can fair smell it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It'll want mending directly,&quot; replied her mother, &quot;and then if
your father comes he'll carry on and say there never is a fire when
a man comes home sweating from the pit. - A public-house is always
warm enough.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence till the boy said complainingly:  &quot;Make haste,
our Annie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I am doing!  I can't make the fire do it no faster, can I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She keeps wafflin' it about so's to make 'er slow,&quot; grumbled the
boy.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't have such an evil imagination, child,&quot; replied the mother.</p>

<p>Soon the room was busy in the darkness with the crisp sound of
crunching.  The mother ate very little.  She drank her tea
determinedly, and sat thinking.  When she rose her anger was
evident in the stern unbending of her head.  She looked at the
pudding in the fender, and broke out:</p>

<p>&quot;It is a scandalous thing as a man can't even come home to his
dinner!  If it's crozzled up to a cinder I don't see why I should
care.  Past his very door he goes to get to a public-house, and
here I sit with his dinner waiting for him - &quot;</p>

<p>She went out.  As she dropped piece after piece of coal on the red
fire, the shadows fell on the walls, till the room was almost in
total darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;I canna see,&quot; grumbled the invisible John.  In spite of herself,
the mother laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;You know the way to your mouth,&quot; she said.  She set the dustpan
outside the door.  When she came again like a shadow on the hearth,
the lad repeated, complaining sulkily:</p>

<p>&quot;I canna see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried the mother irritably, &quot;you're as bad as your
father if it's a bit dusk!&quot;</p>

<p>Nevertheless she took a paper spill from a sheaf on the mantelpiece
and proceeded to light the lamp that hung from the ceiling in the
middle of the room.  As she reached up, her figure displayed itself
just rounding with maternity.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mother - !&quot; exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; said the woman, suspended in the act of putting the lamp
glass over the flame.  The copper reflector shone handsomely on
her, as she stood with uplifted arm, turning to face her daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got a flower in your apron!&quot; said the child, in a little
rapture at this unusual event.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodness me!&quot; exclaimed the woman, relieved.  &quot;One would think the
house was afire.&quot;  She replaced the glass and waited a moment
before turning up the wick.  A pale shadow was seen floating
vaguely on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me smell!&quot; said the child, still rapturously, coming forward
and putting her face to her mother's waist.</p>

<p>&quot;Go along, silly!&quot; said the mother, turning up the lamp.  The light
revealed their suspense so that the woman felt it almost
unbearable.  Annie was still bending at her waist.  Irritably, the
mother took the flowers out from her apron-band.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mother - don't take them out!&quot; Annie cried, catching her hand
and trying to replace the sprig.</p>

<p>&quot;Such nonsense!&quot; said the mother, turning away.  The child put the
pale chrysanthemums to her lips, murmuring:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't they smell beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p>Her mother gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;not to me.  It was chrysanthemums when I married
him, and chrysanthemums when you were born, and the first time they
ever brought him home drunk, he'd got brown chrysanthemums in his
button-hole.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at the children.  Their eyes and their parted lips were
wondering.  The mother sat rocking in silence for some time.  Then
she looked at the clock.</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty minutes to six!&quot;  In a tone of fine bitter carelessness she
continued:  &quot;Eh, he'll not come now till they bring him.  There
he'll stick!  But he needn't come rolling in here in his pit-dirt,
for <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> won't wash him.  He can lie on the floor - Eh, what a fool
I've been, what a fool!  And this is what I came here for, to this
dirty hole, rats and all, for him to slink past his very door.
Twice last week - he's begun now-&quot;</p>

<p>She silenced herself, and rose to clear the table.</p>

<p>While for an hour or more the children played, subduedly intent,
fertile of imagination, united in fear of the mother's wrath, and
in dread of their father's home-coming, Mrs Bates sat in her
rocking-chair making a 'singlet' of thick cream-coloured flannel,
which gave a dull wounded sound as she tore off the grey edge.  She
worked at her sewing with energy, listening to the children, and
her anger wearied itself, lay down to rest, opening its eyes from
time to time and steadily watching, its ears raised to listen.
Sometimes even her anger quailed and shrank, and the mother
suspended her sewing, tracing the footsteps that thudded along the
sleepers outside; she would lift her head sharply to bid the
children 'hush', but she recovered herself in time, and the
footsteps went past the gate, and the children were not flung out
of their playing world.</p>

<p>But at last Annie sighed, and gave in.  She glanced at her waggon
of slippers, and loathed the game.  She turned plaintively to her
mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother!&quot; - but she was inarticulate.</p>

<p>John crept out like a frog from under the sofa.  His mother glanced
up.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;just look at those shirt-sleeves!&quot;</p>

<p>The boy held them out to survey them, saying nothing.  Then
somebody called in a hoarse voice away down the line, and suspense
bristled in the room, till two people had gone by outside, talking.</p>

<p>&quot;It is time for bed,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;My father hasn't come,&quot; wailed Annie plaintively.  But her mother
was primed with courage.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind.  They'll bring him when he does come - like a log.&quot;
She meant there would be no scene.  &quot;And he may sleep on the floor
till he wakes himself.  I know he'll not go to work tomorrow after
this!&quot;</p>

<p>The children had their hands and faces wiped with a flannel.  They
were very quiet.  When they had put on their nightdresses, they
said their prayers, the boy mumbling.  The mother looked down at
them, at the brown silken bush of intertwining curls in the nape of
the girl's neck, at the little black head of the lad, and her heart
burst with anger at their father who caused all three such
distress.  The children hid their faces in her skirts for comfort.</p>

<p>When Mrs Bates came down, the room was strangely empty, with a
tension of expectancy.  She took up her sewing and stitched for
some time without raising her head.  Meantime her anger was tinged
with fear.</p>
