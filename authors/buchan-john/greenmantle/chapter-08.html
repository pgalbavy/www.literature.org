<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I lay for four days like a log in that garret bed. The storm
died down, the thaw set in, and the snow melted. The children
played about the doors and told stories at night round the fire.
Stumm’s myrmidons no doubt beset every road and troubled the lives
of innocent wayfarers. But no one came near the cottage, and the
fever worked itself out while I lay in peace.</p>

<p>It was a bad bout, but on the fifth day it left me, and I lay,
as weak as a kitten, staring at the rafters and the little skylight.
It was a leaky, draughty old place, but the woman of the cottage
had heaped deerskins and blankets on my bed and kept me warm.
She came in now and then, and once she brought me a brew of some
bitter herbs which greatly refreshed me. A little thin porridge
was all the food I could eat, and some chocolate made from the
slabs in my rucksack.</p>

<p>I lay and dozed through the day, hearing the faint chatter of
children below, and getting stronger hourly. Malaria passes as
quickly as it comes and leaves a man little the worse, though
this was one of the sharpest turns I ever had. As I lay I thought,
and my thoughts followed curious lines. One queer thing was that
Stumm and his doings seemed to have been shot back into a lumber-room
of my brain and the door locked. He didn’t seem to be a creature
of the living present, but a distant memory on which I could look
calmly. I thought a good deal about my battalion and the comedy
of my present position. You see I was getting better, for I called
it comedy now, not tragedy.</p>

<p>But chiefly I thought of my mission. All that wild day in the
snow it had seemed the merest farce. The three words Harry Bullivant
had scribbled had danced through my head in a crazy fandango.
They were present to me now, but coolly and sanely in all their
meagreness.</p>

<p>I remember that I took each one separately and chewed on it for
hours. <em>Kasredin</em>—there was nothing to be got out of that.
<em>Cancer</em>—there were too many meanings, all blind. <em>v.
I.</em>—that was the worst gibberish of all.</p>

<p>Before this I had always taken the I as the letter of the alphabet.
I had thought the v. must stand for von, and I had considered
the German names beginning with I—Ingolstadt, Ingeburg, Ingenohl,
and all the rest of them. I had made a list of about seventy at
the British Museum before I left London.</p>

<p>Now I suddenly found myself taking the I as the numeral One.
Idly, not thinking what I was doing, I put it into German.</p>

<p>Then I nearly fell out of the bed. <em>Von Einem</em>—the name
I had heard at Gaudian’s house, the name Stumm had spoken behind
his hand, the name to which Hilda was probably the prefix. It
was a tremendous discovery—the first real bit of light I had found.
Harry Bullivant knew that some man or woman called von Einem was
at the heart of the mystery. Stumm had spoken of the same personage
with respect and in connection with the work I proposed to do
in raising the Moslem Africans. If I found von Einem I would be
getting very warm. What was the word that Stumm had whispered
to Gaudian and scared that worthy? It had sounded like <em>Ühnmantl</em>.
If I could only get that clear, I would solve the riddle.</p>

<p>I think that discovery completed my cure. At any rate on the
evening of the fifth day—it was Wednesday, the 29th of December—I
was well enough to get up. When the dark had fallen and it was
too late to fear a visitor, I came downstairs and, wrapped in
my green cape, took a seat by the fire.</p>

<p>As we sat there in the firelight, with the three white-headed
children staring at me with saucer eyes, and smiling when I looked
their way, the woman talked. Her man had gone to the wars on the
Eastern front, and the last she had heard from him he was in a
Polish bog and longing for his dry native woodlands. The struggle
meant little to her. It was an act of God, a thunderbolt out of
the sky, which had taken a husband from her, and might soon make
her a widow and her children fatherless. She knew nothing of its
causes and purposes, and thought of the Russians as a gigantic
nation of savages, heathens who had never been converted, and
who would eat up German homes if the good Lord and the brave German
soldiers did not stop them. I tried hard to find out if she had
any notion of affairs in the West, but she hadn’t, beyond the
fact that there was trouble with the French. I doubt if she knew
of England’s share in it. She was a decent soul, with no bitterness
against anybody, not even the Russians if they would spare her
man.</p>

<p>That night I realized the crazy folly of war. When I saw the
splintered shell of Ypres and heard hideous tales of German doings,
I used to want to see the whole land of the Boche given up to
fire and sword. I thought we could never end the war properly
without giving the Huns some of their own medicine. But that woodcutter’s
cottage cured me of such nightmares. I was for punishing the guilty
but letting the innocent go free. It was our business to thank
God and keep our hands clean from the ugly blunders to which Germany’s
madness had driven her. What good would it do Christian folk to
burn poor little huts like this and leave children’s bodies by
the wayside? To be able to laugh and to be merciful are the only
things that make man better than the beasts.</p>

<p>The place, as I have said, was desperately poor. The woman’s
face had the skin stretched tight over the bones and that transparency
which means under-feeding; I fancied she did not have the liberal
allowance that soldiers’ wives get in England. The children looked
better nourished, but it was by their mother’s sacrifice. I did
my best to cheer them up. I told them long yarns about Africa
and lions and tigers, and I got some pieces of wood and whittled
them into toys. I am fairly good with a knife, and I carved very
presentable likenesses of a monkey, a springbok, and a rhinoceros.
The children went to bed hugging the first toys, I expect, they
ever possessed.</p>

<p>It was clear to me that I must leave as soon as possible. I had
to get on with my business, and besides, it was not fair to the
woman. Any moment I might be found here, and she would get into
trouble for harbouring me. I asked her if she knew where the Danube
was, and her answer surprised me. "You will reach it in an hour’s
walk," she said. "The track through the wood runs straight to
the ferry."</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast I took my departure. It was drizzling
weather, and I was feeling very lean. Before going I presented
my hostess and the children with two sovereigns apiece. "It is
English gold," I said, "for I have to travel among our enemies
and use our enemies’ money. But the gold is good, and if you go
to any town they will change it for you. But I advise you to put
it in your stocking-foot and use it only if all else fails. You
must keep your home going, for some day there will be peace and
your man will come back from the wars."</p>

<p>I kissed the children, shook the woman’s hand, and went off down
the clearing. They had cried "Auf wiedersehen," but it wasn’t
likely I would ever see them again.</p>

<p>The snow had all gone, except in patches in the deep hollows.
The ground was like a full sponge, and a cold rain drifted in
my eyes. After half an hour’s steady trudge the trees thinned,
and presently I came out on a knuckle of open ground cloaked in
dwarf junipers. And there before me lay the plain, and a mile
off a broad brimming river.</p>

<p>I sat down and looked dismally at the prospect. The exhilaration
of my discovery the day before had gone. I had stumbled on a worthless
piece of knowledge, for I could not use it. Hilda von Einem, if
such a person existed and possessed the great secret, was probably
living in some big house in Berlin, and I was about as likely
to get anything out of her as to be asked to dine with the Kaiser.
Blenkiron might do something, but where on earth was Blenkiron?
I dared say Sir Walter would value the information, but I could
not get to Sir Walter. I was to go on to Constantinople, running
away from the people who really pulled the ropes. But if I stayed
I could do nothing, and I could not stay. I must go on and I didn’t
see how I could go on. Every course seemed shut to me, and I was
in as pretty a tangle as any man ever stumbled into.</p>

<p>For I was morally certain that Stumm would not let the thing
drop. I knew too much, and besides I had outraged his pride. He
would beat the countryside till he got me, and he undoubtedly
would get me if I waited much longer. But how was I to get over
the border? My passport would be no good, for the number of that
pass would long ere this have been wired to every police-station
in Germany, and to produce it would be to ask for trouble. Without
it I could not cross the borders by any railway. My studies of
the Tourists’ Guide had suggested that once I was in Austria I
might find things slacker and move about easier. I thought of
having a try at the Tyrol and I also thought of Bohemia. But these
places were a long way off, and there were several thousand chances
each day that I would be caught on the road.</p>

<p>This was Thursday, the 30th of December, the second last day
of the year. I was due in Constantinople on the 17th of January.
Constantinople! I had thought myself a long way from it in Berlin,
but now it seemed as distant as the moon.</p>

<p>But that big sullen river in front of me led to it. And as I
looked my attention was caught by a curious sight. On the far
eastern horizon, where the water slipped round a corner of hill,
there was a long trail of smoke. The streamers thinned out, and
seemed to come from some boat well round the corner, but I could
see at least two boats in view. Therefore there must be a long
train of barges, with a tug in tow.</p>

<p>I looked to the west and saw another such procession coming into
sight. First went a big river steamer—it can’t have been much
less than 1,000 tons—and after came a string of barges. I counted
no less than six besides the tug. They were heavily loaded and
their draught must have been considerable, but there was plenty
of depth in the flooded river.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection told me what I was looking at. Once Sandy,
in one of the discussions you have in hospital, had told us just
how the Germans munitioned their Balkan campaign. They were pretty
certain of dishing Serbia at the first go, and it was up to them
to get through guns and shells to the old Turk, who was running
pretty short in his first supply. Sandy said that they wanted
the railway, but they wanted still more the river, and they could
make certain of that in a week. He told us how endless strings
of barges, loaded up at the big factories of Westphalia, were
moving through the canals from the Rhine or the Elbe to the Danube.
Once the first reached Turkey, there would be regular delivery,
you see—as quick as the Turks could handle the stuff. And they
didn’t return empty, Sandy said, but came back full of Turkish
cotton and Bulgarian beef and Rumanian corn. I don’t know where
Sandy got the knowledge, but there was the proof of it before
my eyes.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sight, and I could have gnashed my teeth to
see those loads of munitions going snugly off to the enemy. I
calculated they would give our poor chaps hell in Gallipoli. And
then, as I looked, an idea came into my head and with it an eighth
part of a hope.</p>

<p>There was only one way for me to get out of Germany, and that
was to leave in such good company that I would be asked no questions.
That was plain enough. If I travelled to Turkey, for instance,
in the Kaiser’s suite, I would be as safe as the mail; but if
I went on my own I was done. I had, so to speak, to get my passport
inside Germany, to join some caravan which had free marching powers.
And there was the kind of caravan before me—the Essen barges.</p>

<p>It sounded lunacy, for I guessed that munitions of war would
be as jealously guarded as old Hindenburg’s health. All the safer,
I replied to myself, once I get there. If you are looking for
a deserter you don’t seek him at the favourite regimental public-house.
If you’re after a thief, among the places you’d be apt to leave
unsearched would be Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>It was sound reasoning, but how was I to get on board? Probably
the beastly things did not stop once in a hundred miles, and Stumm
would get me long before I struck a halting-place. And even if
I did get a chance like that, how was I to get permission to travel?</p>

<p>One step was clearly indicated—to get down to the river bank
at once. So I set off at a sharp walk across squelchy fields,
till I struck a road where the ditches had overflowed so as almost
to meet in the middle. The place was so bad that I hoped travellers
might be few. And as I trudged, my thoughts were busy with my
prospects as a stowaway. If I bought food, I might get a chance
to lie snug on one of the barges. They would not break bulk till
they got to their journey’s end.</p>

<p>Suddenly I noticed that the steamer, which was now abreast me,
began to move towards the shore, and as I came over a low rise,
I saw on my left a straggling village with a church, and a small
landing-stage. The houses stood about a quarter of a mile from
the stream, and between them was a straight, poplar-fringed road.</p>

<p>Soon there could be no doubt about it. The procession was coming
to a standstill. The big tug nosed her way in and lay up alongside
the pier, where in that season of flood there was enough depth
of water. She signalled to the barges and they also started to
drop anchors, which showed that there must be at least two men
aboard each. Some of them dragged a bit and it was rather a cock-eyed
train that lay in mid-stream. The tug got out a gangway, and from
where I lay I saw half a dozen men leave it, carrying something
on their shoulders.</p>

<p>It could be only one thing—a dead body. Someone of the crew must
have died, and this halt was to bury him. I watched the procession
move towards the village and I reckoned they would take some time
there, though they might have wired ahead for a grave to be dug.
Anyhow, they would be long enough to give me a chance.</p>

<p>For I had decided upon the brazen course. Blenkiron had said
you couldn’t cheat the Boche, but you could bluff him. I was going
to put up the most monstrous bluff. If the whole countryside was
hunting for Richard Hannay, Richard Hannay would walk through
as a pal of the hunters. For I remembered the pass Stumm had given
me. If that was worth a tinker’s curse it should be good enough
to impress a ship’s captain.</p>

<p>Of course there were a thousand risks. They might have heard
of me in the village and told the ship’s party the story. For
that reason I resolved not to go there but to meet the sailors
when they were returning to the boat. Or the captain might have
been warned and got the number of my pass, in which case Stumm
would have his hands on me pretty soon. Or the captain might be
an ignorant fellow who had never seen a Secret Service pass and
did not know what it meant, and would refuse me transport by the
letter of his instructions. In that case I might wait on another
convoy.</p>

<p>I had shaved and made myself a fairly respectable figure before
I left the cottage. It was my cue to wait for the men when they
left the church, wait on that quarter-mile of straight highway.
I judged the captain must be in the party. The village, I was
glad to observe, seemed very empty. I have my own notions about
the Bavarians as fighting men, but I am bound to say that, judging
by my observations, very few of them stayed at home.</p>

<p>That funeral took hours. They must have had to dig the grave,
for I waited near the road in a clump of cherry-trees, with my
feet in two inches of mud and water, till I felt chilled to the
bone. I prayed to God it would not bring back my fever, for I
was only one day out of bed. I had very little tobacco left in
my pouch, but I stood myself one pipe, and I ate one of the three
cakes of chocolate I still carried.</p>

<p>At last, well after midday, I could see the ship’s party returning.
They marched two by two and I was thankful to see that they had
no villagers with them. I walked to the road, turned up it, and
met the vanguard, carrying my head as high as I knew how.</p>

<p>"Where’s your captain?" I asked, and a man jerked his thumb over
his shoulder. The others wore thick jerseys and knitted caps,
but there was one man at the rear in uniform.</p>

<p>He was a short, broad man with a weather-beaten face and an anxious
eye.</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you, Herr Captain?" I said, with what
I hoped was a judicious blend of authority and conciliation.</p>

<p>He nodded to his companion, who walked on.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked rather impatiently.</p>

<p>I proffered him my pass. Thank Heaven he had seen the kind of
thing before, for his face at once took on that curious look which
one person in authority always wears when he is confronted with
another. He studied it closely and then raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir?" he said. "I observe your credentials. What can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>"I take it you are bound for Constantinople?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The boats go as far as Rustchuk," he replied. "There the stuff
is transferred to the railway."</p>

<p>"And you reach Rustchuk when?"</p>

<p>"In ten days, bar accidents. Let us say twelve to be safe."</p>

<p>"I want to accompany you," I said. "In my profession, Herr Captain,
it is necessary sometimes to make journeys by other than the common
route. That is now my desire. I have the right to call upon some
other branch of our country’s service to help me. Hence my request."</p>

<p>Very plainly he did not like it.</p>

<p>"I must telegraph about it. My instructions are to let no one
aboard, not even a man like you. I am sorry, Sir, but I must get
authority first before I can fall in with your desire. Besides,
my boat is ill-found. You had better wait for the next batch and
ask Dreyser to take you. I lost Walter today. He was ill when
he came aboard—a disease of the heart—but he would not be persuaded.
And last night he died."</p>

<p>"Was that him you have been burying?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Even so. He was a good man and my wife’s cousin, and now I have
no engineer. Only a fool of a boy from Hamburg. I have just come
from wiring to my owners for a fresh man, but even if he comes
by the quickest train he will scarcely overtake us before Vienna
or even Buda."</p>

<p>I saw light at last.</p>

<p>"We will go together," I said, "and cancel that wire. For behold,
Herr Captain, I am an engineer, and will gladly keep an eye on
your boilers till we get to Rustchuk."</p>

<p>He looked at me doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I am speaking truth," I said. "Before the war I was an engineer
in Damaraland. Mining was my branch, but I had a good general
training, and I know enough to run a river-boat. Have no fear.
I promise you I will earn my passage."</p>

<p>His face cleared, and he looked what he was, an honest, good-humoured
North German seaman.</p>

<p>"Come then in God’s name," he cried, "and we will make a bargain.
I will let the telegraph sleep. I require authority from the Government
to take a passenger, but I need none to engage a new engineer."</p>

<p>He sent one of the hands back to the village to cancel his wire.
In ten minutes I found myself on board, and ten minutes later
we were out in mid-stream and our tows were lumbering into line.
Coffee was being made ready in the cabin, and while I waited for
it I picked up the captain’s binoculars and scanned the place
I had left.</p>

<p>I saw some curious things. On the first road I had struck on
leaving the cottage there were men on bicycles moving rapidly.
They seemed to wear uniform. On the next parallel road, the one
that ran through the village, I could see others. I noticed, too,
that several figures appeared to be beating the intervening fields.</p>

<p>Stumm’s cordon had got busy at last, and I thanked my stars that
not one of the villagers had seen me. I had not got away much
too soon, for in another half-hour he would have had me.</p>
