<p>The next day brought a marked coolness in the temperature. In
preparation for the evening’s instructive entertainment, nearly
all the boys spent the time in roaming through the woods, taking
notes and brushing up their knowledge of birds, which were met
with only in moderate numbers.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy told Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes of his singular
experience the night before, and asked their help in solving the
puzzle.</p>

<p>"I wish we could aid you," replied Alvin, "but it is as much
a mystery to us as it is to you. Gordon Calhoun went with us in
the other canoe to the western end of the lake, where we found
so romantic a spot that we ate our lunch there and did not return
until after dark."</p>

<p>"And ye didn’t obsarve anything of thim tramps and their dive
overboord?"</p>

<p>"We must have been deep in the woods when that took place and,
of course, we noticed nothing strange when we paddled back."</p>

<p>"I’ve tried to pump Uncle Elk, but the valves won’t work. I’m
going to kaap at it till I larn the truth or break a trace."</p>

<p>"Count us in to give all the help we can," Alvin assured him.</p>

<p>That evening when the Boy Scouts gathered in the large room of
the bungalow and disposed themselves in their free and easy fashion,
a moderate fire was burning on the hearth and all were on the
tiptoe of expectancy.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Uncle Elk, "I am going to ask your permission
to reverse the order which I laid out last night. Most of us old
persons are apt to forget that the knowledge which interests us
may not be equally interesting to everyone else. Although I cut
short my talk about American trees, it was still dry in some respects.
Now if I should start in concerning birds you would by and by
become weary. Oh, you needn’t shake your heads. I don’t forget
when I was a boy myself. So I have decided to say nothing about
our little brothers of the air until to-morrow night, when we
shall consider nothing else. The time now at my disposal is to
be given to the story I have in mind. If any one has an objection
to make let him do so now or forever after hold his peace."</p>

<p>He looked around in the bright faces as if he really expected
a protest instead of a general series of smiles. Then with the
prefatory remark that the narrative which he was about to give
was true in every respect, he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"The cause of American independence never looked more gloomy
than in the summer and autumn of 1776. Washington with his famishing
army was in the city of New York, preparing for the attack that
he knew would soon be made by the British fleet and land forces.
The American fortifications extended from the ferry station of
Brooklyn and Gowanus Bay to Wallabout Bay (now Brooklyn Navy Yard),
less than a mile and a half in length. Generals Sullivan and Stirling
were in command, with five thousand miserably equipped troops.
Unfortunately that fine officer General Greene was ill with a
violent fever, and the boastful Sullivan assumed charge, but Washington
soon replaced him with General Putnam. By a fatal oversight, one
of the three roads over any of which the enemy could advance if
it was unguarded, was left invitingly open. Through this the British
soldiers rushed and drove the Americans pell-mell out of their
intrenchments.</p>

<p>"Had Howe flung off his natural indolence, he would have captured
the whole patriot army, including Washington and his officers,
but certain of soon doing so, he wished to save the lives of his
men. The Americans had several hundred killed and lost a thousand
prisoners, among the latter being Generals Sullivan and Stirling.
The leading officers were soon exchanged, but the privates suffered
horribly in the hideous Sugar House and rotten hulks at Wallabout.</p>

<p>"A strange providence saved the Continental army. The fleet was
checked by adverse winds, and a dense fog settled over Brooklyn,
but did not touch the other shore. Thus hidden from sight, the
Americans stole back to New York, unseen by the enemy.</p>

<p>"But, as I said, the outlook could not have been more gloomy.
The situation was critical to the last degree. The army was so
demoralized that little discipline remained; whole companies deserted;
the few recruits who came into camp met double their number going
out; those who stayed clamored for their pay, and the money chest
was as empty as an egg shell. Winter was coming on, and more than
once it looked as if the army would dwindle to nothing. The fourteen
thousand troops declared fit for duty were strung the whole length
of Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>"The crisis was imminent and Washington called a council of war
September 7th, to decide whether New York should be abandoned
or defended. The commander, seeing the dread necessity coming,
had asked Congress if he should not burn the city rather than
allow it to serve as the winter quarters of the invaders. He was
ordered to use special care to prevent any damage being done,
because that body was sure the place would soon be recovered.
The first council of war decided to stay and defend New York.</p>

<p>"A few days later, however, another council agreed that the only
course possible was to leave the city and take position on Harlem
Heights. The public stores were to be sent to Dobbs Ferry and
the sick carried across to New Jersey. The main army would march
northward and General Putnam would stay in New York with four
thousand troops. If he found his position untenable, he was to
follow Washington.</p>

<p>"At this council the commander-in-chief said:</p>

<p>"‘I know absolutely nothing of the intentions of the enemy. Two
ships-of-war have gone up the East River and others will follow.
Their troops are active everywhere, but I cannot even guess what
they mean to do. Until I have knowledge on that point, I am helpless.’</p>

<p>"In his distressful dilemma, Washington wrote to General Heath
at Kingsbridge, entreating him and General Clinton to aid in securing
the indispensable information. He told them to spare no expense
or pains, adding that not since the beginning of the war had he
been so uneasy.</p>

<p>"Shortly after, Washington called his officers together again.
He told them he was still without the least knowledge of the plans
of the enemy. Only one recourse remained to him:—that was to send
a spy into the British lines in quest of the information. Such
a man must be clear-headed, cool, tactful, a good draughtsman
and of undaunted courage. He appealed to Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton
(soon to die the death of a patriot) to find him the person. Knowlton
laid the request before a conference of his officers, and asked
whether any one was willing to volunteer.</p>

<p>"A spy is very different from a scout and in the eyes of most
people is the most contemptible of creatures, for the essence
of his duty is treachery. To succeed he must play the hypocrite
and betray confidence at every turn. In such scorn is a spy held
by civilized nations that he is not permitted to die the death
of a soldier, but is hanged like the worst of felons.</p>

<p>"The request of Knowlton was succeeded by an indignant hush.
The bronzed faces flushed as if under the sting of an insult,
and the officers dared not trust themselves to reply. In the midst
of the strained silence, a clear voice spoke:</p>

<p>"‘I will go!’</p>

<p>"Every eye was turned in astonishment on the speaker. He was
a young man of athletic figure and handsome face, whose paleness
was due to a severe illness from which he was hardly yet recovered.
He wore the uniform of a captain, and in the whole army there
was not a braver or more beloved officer than he. His words caused
a painful shock to his comrades, who, believing a disgraceful
death was certain to follow his mad attempt, closed around him
and protested in the most forceful language at their command.
To all their appeals he smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"‘Gentlemen, it is useless. I am touched by your friendship,
but all the arguments you bring forward have already been considered
by me. A spy is looked upon with loathing, but the necessity of
one’s country makes every kind of service honorable. I am not
seeking promotion or pecuniary reward. I go to serve our cause,
for which I am ready at any time to give my life.’</p>

<p>"It was not the words alone, but their emphasis which silenced
his comrades. They saw it was useless to appeal to one whose patriotism
throbbed and burned through his entire being, and inspired every
thought, word and deed.</p>

<p>"And who was the young officer who thus took his life in his
hands that he might serve the cause of liberty?</p>

<p>"He was Captain Nathan Hale, born in Connecticut, in 1755, the
sixth child among twelve, of the strictest Puritan parents. His
mental and athletic gifts were wonderful. None of his playmates
could approach him in running, leaping, swimming, throwing, wrestling
and the feats of strength and agility so much admired by all rugged
American youths. Many a time he would place a row of empty barrels
beside one another and with little effort spring out of one into
the other until he had completed the series. Standing beside a
fence whose top rail touched his chin, he would rest one hand
lightly on it and vault over as easily as a deer. One day, while
a student at Yale, in a contest with his friends, he made so prodigious
a leap that the bounds were carefully marked and preserved for
years, the admiration and despair of all subsequent students.</p>

<p>"But, extraordinary as was Nathan Hale’s athletic skill, his
mental powers were more brilliant, while his social qualities
made him a favorite with all. His simplicity, unfailing good nature
and readiness to help others, no matter whom, justified the remark:
‘Every man, woman and child who knew him were his friends and
among them not one was ever an enemy.’</p>

<p>"He entered Yale College when fifteen years old and was graduated
in due course with the highest honors. This fact attests his scholarship
and ability. He was easily the most popular student, not only
with his classmates, but with the tutors and the faculty of the
college and the best families in New Haven.</p>

<p>"Hale left college in 1773 and engaged in teaching. In 1774,
he was made preceptor in the Union Grammar School at New London.
The building is carefully preserved and is well worth a visit.
The institution was of a high order, and its students were not
only grounded thoroughly in an English education, but were prepared
for college. Hale was its first preceptor, and his success was
pronounced from the beginning. Boys like you have admired and
always will admire physical prowess, and there was never one among
them all who could approach their instructor in that respect.
What a star football player he would have made in these later
days! Added to this ability, his mental and social gifts and his
profound religious nature explain his marked success among the
youth of New London.</p>

<p>"On the 21st of April, 1775, a rider dashed into the little town
upon his foaming horse and shouted the news of Lexington and Concord.
Pausing only long enough to rest his panting steed and to snatch
a bit of food, he thundered away for New York with his momentous
tidings.</p>

<p>"Instantly New London flamed with excitement. The bells were
rung and a ‘town meeting,’ the inalienable recourse of all New
Englanders, was called at the court house for early candle light.
Seemingly the whole town crowded thither. There were burning speeches
and Hale’s was the most impassioned of all.</p>

<p>"The talking being over, he wrote down his name as a volunteer.
Others caught the contagion and elbowed one another in their eagerness
to be among the first to enlist. The next morning, when the boys
came together at the call of the school bell, their teacher offered
up an earnest prayer for the success of the great struggle that
had opened, commended his pupils to the care of their Heavenly
Father, shook the hands of each lad in turn, uttered a few words
of advice, and set out for Cambridge. Some time later, he came
back to New London and resumed his duties in the school.</p>

<p>"The young patriot, however, could not remain idle so long as
his beloved country needed her sons. He enlisted as a lieutenant
in Colonel Charles Webb’s regiment, which had been raised by order
of the General Assembly of Connecticut for home defense and, if
needed, for national protection. In September, the regiment marched
to Cambridge and took part in the siege of Boston. Upon the departure
of the British for Halifax, the American army went to New York.
Some months later, when the team of his company’s enlistment expired,
Hale offered to give the men his month’s pay if they would stay
a little while longer.</p>

<p>"The Continentals had been in New York but a short time when
Hale became the hero of a daring exploit. A British supply vessel
lay in the East River under the protection of a frigate of sixty-four
guns. He obtained permission to attempt the capture of the sloop.
Selecting a few men as brave as himself, they stepped into a whale
boat, rowed silently out late at night and drew up beside the
vessel undetected by the watch. Like so many phantoms, the boarders
climbed over the side, seized the sentinel, fastened the crew
below the hatches, lifted anchor and took the prize into Coenties
Slip, without raising the slightest alarm. Day was breaking when
Hale, holding the helm, was recognized by his friends, who received
him with hurrahs. For once at least his comrades enjoyed a ‘square
meal.’</p>

<p>"In May, 1776, he became captain of a company of Continental
Rangers attached to Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton’s regiment, called
‘Congress’ Own.’ The young officer’s company was the best drilled
and disciplined of all. Little is known of his actions during
those eventful days, but it cannot be doubted that he did his
duty well. Illness kept him in New York at the time the British
invaded Long Island, and still weak and pale, he joined the troops
who retreated toward Harlem Heights early in September.</p>

<p>"This brings me back to the day when Lieutenant-Colonel Knowlton
walked into the quarters of General Washington and introduced
Captain Hale as the officer who had volunteered to serve him as
a spy. The commander looked admiringly into the blue eyes of the
handsome young athlete and took his hand. The great man was moved
and feelingly thanked him for the inestimable service he hoped
he would render his country. He saw without questioning that Hale
was the ideal actor for so perilous a rôle. He gave him minute
instructions, with a written order to the owners of all American
vessels in Long Island Sound to take him to any point on Long
Island where he might wish to go.</p>

<p>"Captain Hale left camp the same evening. He took with him Sergeant
Stephen Hempstead, a member of his company, who was devoted to
the officer, and a servant, Ansel Wright. They had to walk fifty
miles to Norwalk before they found a safe place to cross the Sound,
because of the British cruisers that were ever moving to and fro.
At this place, Hale took off his regimentals and donned a brown
cloth suit and a broad-brimmed hat. He assumed the character of
a Quaker school teacher, who had wearied of the society of the
rebels in New York and had started out to find a situation among
more congenial folk.</p>

<p>"The captain instructed his companions to wait at Norwalk until
the 20th, upon which day he expected to come back. They were to
send a boat for him on that morning. He left with them his uniform,
his commission and all other papers that might betray his identity.
He crossed the Sound in a sloop and went ashore on the point of
Great Neck in Huntingdon Bay, being rowed thither in a yawl. He
landed near a place called ‘The Cedars,’ not far from a tavern
kept by a widow named Chichester. She was a spiteful Tory and
the inn was a lounging place for those of her neighbors who were
of the same mind. In the gray light of early morning Hale walked
past without being noticed. A mile beyond, he stopped at the farm
house of William Johnson, and obtained breakfast and a bed for
several hours’ rest. Thence he went directly into the nearest
British lines, where he was received without suspicion. He was
gone for about two weeks, but what he did, where he went, what
adventures befell him and the various means he used to escape
detection can never be known. It is certain that he visited all
the enemy’s encampments near Brooklyn and twice passed their lines.
He made drawings and notes of what he saw and learned; he went
from Brooklyn, then only a ferry station, to New York City, which
the British captured after his departure, and was equally thorough
in every place. The drawings and memoranda, the latter written
in Latin, were hidden under the loose inner soles of his shoes.</p>

<p>"Having finished his work in New York, Hale recrossed to Brooklyn
and threaded his way through the lines to Huntingdon. By this
time he felt so secure in his disguise that he entered without
hesitation the tavern of Widow Chichester and sat down among a
group of loungers, with whom he talked in his character of a Quaker
school teacher. He was happy over the thought that his dangerous
work was over and the important knowledge he had gained would
soon be in the hands of General Washington.</p>

<p>"Among the strangers in the place was one whose face seemed familiar
to Hale, but he could not recall where he had ever met the man.
He decided that the resemblance was one of those accidental ones
that are occasionally seen, and he gave the matter no further
thought. By and by the fellow, who silently studied the beaming
young Quaker, slipped out of doors and did not return.</p>

<p>"Ah, why did Hale fail to see the sinister meaning of all this?
After escaping so many perils, why did he not continue alert and
suspicious until safe within his own lines? Sad to say, not a
single misgiving entered his thoughts, and after awhile he bade
the company good night and went to his room.</p>

<p>"The next morning at dawn he walked to the bay to meet the boat
that was to come for him. With a thrill of delighted expectancy,
he saw a craft containing several men approaching. He sprang lightly
down the bank and then suddenly stopped in consternation. The
boat was filled with British marines under command of an officer!</p>

<p>"He whirled about to flee. Had he discovered his peril sooner
and gained a few minutes’ start, no pursuer could have overtaken
him. But six muskets were leveled, and he was ordered to surrender
under threat of instant death. He paused, came down the bank again
and stepped into the boat, which was rowed out to the British
ship <em>Halifax</em>. There he was searched and the fatal papers
were found on him.</p>

<p>"The tradition is that the man in the tavern who betrayed Hale
was a distant Tory relative who recognized him as soon as he entered
the place. Upon leaving the inn, he went to a British naval officer
in Huntingdon Bay with the news.</p>

<p>"Captain Hale was taken to New York on the 21st and brought before
Lord Howe, who read the documents that had been captured with
the prisoner. It was useless to try to conceal the truth and Hale
denied nothing. He said he wished no court-martial and was ready
to meet his fate.</p>

<p>"Howe was naturally a kind-hearted man, but just then he was
greatly irritated over a fire which had destroyed several hundred
houses in New York, and which he believed had been started by
the Americans to prevent his use of them. He condemned Hale to
be hanged at daylight the next morning and placed him in the custody
of William Cunningham, Provost Marshal and one of the most brutal
wretches that ever lived. It is some consolation to know that
this miscreant was hanged himself some years later for scores
of confessed murders to which he had been accessory. He thrust
Hale into a prison cell, and would not have unpinioned him except
for the intercession of a British officer. When the prisoner asked
for the presence of a chaplain, it was refused with curses, as
was his request for a Bible. The same friendly officer obtained
permission for Hale to write letters to his mother, sisters and
the girl to whom he was betrothed. The missives were handed to
Cunningham to be forwarded. With a leer he read each and then
tore them up and flung the fragments on the floor. Hale looked
scornfully at him but did not speak.</p>

<p>"The next morning he was led to the gallows, which was the limb
of an apple tree, exactly where is not known. In accordance with
the military custom of those days, a ladder was placed under the
branch. The prisoner climbed two or three rounds, when at a signal
the support was turned and he was left dangling in the air. A
moment before, he had looked down in the faces of the hushed spectators
and uttered his last noble words:</p>

<p>"‘I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country!’</p>

<p>"No one knows where the martyr was buried. On November 25, 1893,
a statue to his memory was unveiled in City Hall Park, in the
presence of a vast assemblage and amid impressive ceremonies." </p>
