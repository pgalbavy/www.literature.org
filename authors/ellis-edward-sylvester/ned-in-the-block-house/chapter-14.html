<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe first pinned the rattlesnake to the earth
with the arrow which he threw with his deft left hand, then he
flung the reptile from his path and resumed his delicate and dangerous
attempt to creep past the three Wyandots who were lying against
the hank of the Licking, watching the block-house, now and then
firing a shot at the solid logs, as if to express their wishes
respecting the occupants of the building.</p>

<p>If the task was almost impossible at first, it soon became utterly
so, as the young Shawanoe was compelled to admit. The contour
of the bank was such that, after getting by the log, he would
be compelled to approach the warriors so close that he could touch
them with his outstretched hand. This would have answered at night,
when they were asleep, but he might as well have attempted to
lift himself through the air as to do it under the circumstances
we have described.</p>

<p>Deerfoot never despaired nor gave up so long as he held space
in which to move. He immediately repeated the retrograde motion
he had used when confronted by the venomous serpent, his wish
now being to return to the spot from which he fired the arrow.</p>

<p>The ventures made satisfied him that he had but one chance in
a thousand of escaping capture and death. He could not move to
the right nor left: it would have been certain destruction to
show himself on the clearing, and equally fatal to attempt to
use the shallow Licking behind him.</p>

<p>There was a remote possibility that the arrowy messenger which
he had sent from his bow had not been noticed by any of the besieging
Wyandots, and that, as considerable time had already passed, none
of them would come over to where he was to inquire into the matter.</p>

<p>If they would keep as far away from him as they were when his
friend Ned Preston started on his desperate run for the block-house,
of course he would be safe. He could wait where he was, lying
flat on the ground, through all the long hours of the day, until
the mantle of night should give him the chance for which he sighed.</p>

<p>Ah, but for one hour of darkness! His flight from the point of
danger would be but pastime.</p>

<p>The single chance in a thousand was that which we have named:
the remote possibility that none of the Wyandots would come any
nearer to where he was hugging the river bank.</p>

<p>For a full hour Deerfoot was in suspense, with a fluttering hope
that it might be his fortune to wait until the sun should climb
to the zenith and sink in the west; for, young as was the Shawanoe,
he had learned the great truth that in the affairs of this world
no push or energy will win, where the virtue of patience is lacking.
Many a time a single move, born of impatience, has brought irretrievable
disaster, where success otherwise was certain.</p>

<p>As the Shawanoe lay against the bank, looking across the clearing
toward the block-house, he recalled that message which, instead
of being spoken, as were all that he knew of, was carried on the
arrow he sent through the window. If he but understood how to
place those words on paper or on a dried leaf even, he would send
another missive to Colonel Preston, saying that, inasmuch as he
was shut in from all hope of escape, he would make the effort
to run across the open space, as did his friends before him.</p>

<p>But the thing was impossible: the door of the block-house was
fastened, and if Deerfoot should start, he would reach it, if
he reached it at all, before the Colonel could draw the first
bolt. Even if the Shawanoe youth should succeed in making the
point, which was extremely doubtful, now that the Wyandots were
fully awake, the inevitable few seconds' halt there must prove
fatal.</p>

<p>The short conversation which he had overheard, convinced him
of the sentiments of Waughtauk and his warriors toward him, and
led the young Shawanoe to determine on an effort to extricate
himself. It is the very daring of such a scheme which sometimes
succeeds, and he put it in execution without delay.</p>

<p>Instead of crouching to the ground, as he had been doing, he
now rose upright and moved down the bank, in the direction of
the three Wyandots who first turned him back. They were in their
old position, and he had gone only a few steps when one of them
turned his head and saw the youthful warrior approaching. He uttered
a surprised "Hooh!" and the others looked around at the figure,
as they might have done had it been an apparition.</p>

<p>The scheme of Deerfoot was to attempt the part of a friend of
the Wyandots and consequently that of an enemy of the white race.
He acted as if without thought of being anything else, and as
though he never dreamed there was a suspicion of his loyalty.</p>

<p>At a leisurely gait he walked toward the three Indians, holding
his head down somewhat, and glancing sideways through the scattered
bushes at the top of the bank, as though afraid of a shot from
the garrison.</p>

<p>"Have any of my brethren of the Wyandots been harmed by the dogs
of the Yenghese?" asked Deerfoot in the high-flown language peculiar
to his people.</p>

<p>"The eyes of Deerfoot must have been closed not to see Oo-oo-mat-ah
lying on the ground before his eyes."</p>

<p>This was an allusion to the warrior who made the mistake of stopping
Ned Preston when on his way to the block-house.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot saw Oo-oo-mat-ah fall, as falls the brave warrior fighting
his foe; the eyes of Deerfoot were wet with tears, when his brave
Wyandot brother fell."</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a microscope would not have detected the first
grain of truth in this grandiloquent declaration, which was accompanied
by a gesture as though the audacious young Shawanoe was on the
point of breaking into sobs again.</p>

<p>The apparent sincerity of Deerfoot's grief seemed to disarm the
Wyandots for the moment, which was precisely what the young Shawanoe
was seeking to do.</p>

<p>Having mastered his sorrow, he started down the river bank on
the same slow gait, glancing sideways at the block-house as though
he feared a shot from that point. But the Indians were not to
be baffled in that fashion: their estimate of the daring Deerfoot
was the same as Waughtauk's.</p>

<p>Without any further dissembling, one of the Wyandots, a lithe
sinewy brave, fully six feet in height, bounded in front of the
Shawanoe, and grasping his knife, said with flashing eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a dog! he is a traitor; he is a serpent that has
two tongues! he shall die!"</p>

<p>The others stood a few feet behind the couple and watched the
singular encounter.</p>

<p>The Wyandot, with the threatening words in his mouth, leaped
toward Deerfoot, striking a vicious blow with his knife. It was
a thrust which would have ended the career of the youthful brave,
had it reached its mark.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot dodged it easily, and, without attempting to return
it, shot under the infuriated arm and sped down the river bank
with all the wonderful speed at his command.</p>

<p>The slight disturbance had brought the other three Wyandots to
the spot, and it would have been an easy thing to shoot the fugitive
as he fled. But among the new arrivals were those who knew it
was the wish of Waughtauk that Deerfoot should be taken prisoner,
that he might be put to the death all traitors deserved.</p>

<p>Instead of firing their guns therefore, the whole six broke into
a run, each exerting himself to the utmost to overtake the fleet-footed
youth, who was no match for any one of them in a hand-to-hand
conflict, or a trial of strength.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, by his sharp strategy, had thrown the whole party behind
him and had gained two or three yards' start: he felt that, if
he could not hold this against the fleetest of the Wyandots, then
he deserved to die the death of a dog.</p>

<p>The bushes, undergrowth and logs which obstructed his path, were
as troublesome to his pursuers as to himself, and he bounded over
them like a mountain chamois, leaping from crag to crag.</p>

<p>There can be no question that, if this contest had been decided
by the relative swiftness of foot on the part of pursuer and pursued,
the latter would have escaped without difficulty, but, as if the
fates were against the brave Shawanoe, his matchless limbs were
no more than fairly going, when two Wyandot warriors appeared
directly in front in such a position that it was impossible to
avoid them.</p>

<p>Deerfoot made a wrenching turn to the right, as if he meant to
flank them, but he stumbled, nearly recovered himself&mdash;then fell
with great violence, turning a complete somersault from his own
momentum, and then rose to his feet, as the Indians in front and
rear closed around him.</p>

<p>He uttered a suppressed exclamation of pain, limped a couple
of steps, and then grasped a tree to sustain himself. He seemed
to have sprained his ankle badly and could bear his weight only
on one foot. No more disastrous termination of the flight could
have followed.</p>

<p>The Wyandots gathered about the poor fugitive with many expressions
of pleasure, for the pursuers had just been forced to believe
the young brave was likely to escape them, and it was a delightful
surprise when the two appeared in front and headed him off.</p>

<p>Besides, a man with a sprained ankle is the last one in the world
to indulge in a foot-race, and they felt secure, therefore, in
holding their prisoner.</p>

<p>"Dog! traitor! serpent with the forked tongue! base son of a
brave chieftain! warrior with the white heart!"</p>

<p>These were a few of the expressions applied to the captive, who
made no answer. In fact, he seemed to be occupied exclusively
with his ankle, for, while they were berating him, he stooped
over and rubbed it with both hands, flinging his long bow aside,
as though it could be of no further use to him.</p>

<p>The epithets were enough to blister the skin of the ordinary
American Indian, and there came a sudden flush to the dusky face
of the youthful brave, when he heard himself called the base son
of a brave chieftain. But he had learned to conquer himself, and
he uttered not a word in response.</p>

<p>One of the Wyandots picked up the bow which the captive had thrown
aside, and examined it with much curiosity. There was no attempt
to disarm him of his knife and tomahawk, for had he not been disabled
by the sprained ankle, he would have been looked upon as an insignificant
prisoner, against whom it was cowardly to take any precautions.
In fact, to remove his weapons that remained would have been giving
dignity to one too contemptible to deserve the treatment of an
ordinary captive.</p>

<p>The aborigines, like all barbarians and many civilized people,
are cruel by nature. The Wyandots, who had secured Deerfoot, refrained
from killing him for no other reason than that it would have been
greater mercy than they were willing to show to one whom they
held in such detestation.</p>

<p>As it was, two of them struck him and repeated the taunting names
uttered when they first laid hands on him. Deerfoot still made
no answer, though his dark eyes flashed with a dangerous light
when he looked in the faces of the couple who inflicted the indignity.</p>

<p>He asked them quietly to help him along, but, with another taunt,
the whole eight refused. The one who had smote him twice and who
held his bow, placed his hand against the shoulder of the youth
and gave him a violent shove. Deerfoot went several paces and
then fell on his knees and hands with a gasp of pain severe enough
to make him faint.</p>

<p>The others laughed, as he painfully labored to his feet. He then
asked that he might have his bow to use as a cane; but even this
was refused. Finding nothing in the way of assistance was to be
obtained, his proud spirit closed his lips, and he limped forward,
scarcely touching the great toe of the injured limb to the ground.</p>

<p>The brief flight and pursuit had led the parties so far down
the Licking that they were out of sight of the block-house, quite
a stretch of forest intervening; but it had also taken them nearer
the headquarters, as they may be called, of Waughtauk, leader
of the Wyandots besieging Fort Bridgman.</p>

<p>This sachem showed, in a lesser way, something of the military
prowess of Pontiac, chief of the Chippewas, King Philip of Pokanoket,
and Tecumseh, who belonged to the same tribe with Deerfoot.</p>

<p>Although his entire force numbered a little more than fifty,
yet he had disposed them with such skill around the block-house
that the most experienced of scouts failed to make his way through
the lines.</p>

<p>Waughtauk was well convinced of the treachery of the Shawanoe,
and there was no living man for whom he would have given a greater
amount of wampum.</p>

<p>The eyes of the chieftain sparkled with pleasure when the youthful
warrior came limping painfully toward him, escorted by the Wyandots,
as though they feared that, despite his disabled condition, he
might dart off with the speed of the wind.</p>

<p>Waughtauk rose from the fallen tree on which he had been seated
among his warriors, and advanced a step or two to meet the party
as it approached.</p>

<p>"Dog! base son of the noble chief Allomaug! youth with the red
face and the white heart! serpent with the forked tongue! the
Great Spirit has given it to Waughtauk that he should inflict
on you the death that is fitting all such."</p>

<p>These were fierce words, but the absolute fury of manner which
marked their utterance showed how burning was the hate of the
Wyandot leader and his warriors. They knew that this youth had
been honored and trusted as no one of his years had ever been
honored and trusted by his tribe, and his treachery was therefore
all the deeper, and deserving of the worst punishment that could
be devised.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, standing on one foot, with his hand grasping a sapling
at his side, looked calmly in the face of the infuriated leader,
and in his low, musical voice, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot was sick almost to death, his white brother took
the place of the father and mother who went to the happy hunting
grounds long ago; Deerfoot would have been a dog, had he not helped
his white brother through the forest, when the bear and the panther
and the Wyandot were in his path."</p>

<p>This defence, instead of soothing the chieftain, seemed to arouse
all the ferocity of his nature. His face fairly shone with flame
through his ochre and paint; and striding toward the prisoner,
he raised his hand with such fierceness that the muscles of the
arm rose in knots and the veins stood out in ridges on temple
and forehead.</p>

<p>As he threw his fist aloft and was on the point of smiting Deerfoot
to the earth, the latter straightened up with his native dignity,
and, still grasping the sapling and still standing on one foot,
looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>It was as if a great lion-tamer, hearing the stealthy approach
of the wild beast, had suddenly turned and confronted him.</p>

<p>Waughtauk paused at the moment, his fist was in the air directly
over the head of Deerfoot, glowering down upon him with an expression
demoniac in its hate. He breathed hard and fast for a few seconds
and then retreated without striking the impending blow.</p>

<p>But it must not be understood that it was the defiant look of
the captive which checked the chief. It produced no such effect,
nor was it intended to do so: it simply meant on the part of Deerfoot
that he expected indignity and torture and death, and he could
bear them as unflinchingly as Waughtauk himself.</p>

<p>As for the chieftain, he reflected that a little counsel and
consultation were needed to fix upon the best method of putting
this tormentor out of the way. If Waughtauk should allow his own
passion to master him, the anticipated enjoyment would be lost.</p>

<p>While Deerfoot, therefore, retained his grasp on the sapling,
that he might be supported from falling, Waughtauk called about
him his cabinet, as it may be termed, and began the consideration
of the best means of punishing the traitor.</p>

<p>The captive could hear all the discussion, and, it need not be
said, he listened with much more interest than he appeared to
feel.</p>

<p>It would be revolting to detail the schemes advocated. If there
is any one direction in which the human mind is marvelous in its
ingenuity, it is in the single one of devising means of making
other beings miserable. Some of the proposals of the Wyandots
were worthy of Nana Sahib, of Bithoor, but they were rejected
one after the other, as falling a little short of the requirements
of the leader.</p>

<p>There was one fact which did not escape the watchful eye and
ear of the prisoner. The Wyandot who struck him twice, and who
had taken charge of his bow, as a trophy belonging specially to
himself, was the foremost in proposing the most cruel schemes.
The look which Deerfoot cast upon him said plainly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would give the world for a chance to settle with <em>you</em>
before I suffer death!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought seemed to seize Waughtauk like an inspiration.
Rising to his feet, he held up his hand for his warriors to listen:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is a swift runner; he has overtaken the fleeing horse
and leaped upon his back; he shall be placed in the Long Clearing;
he shall be given a start, and the swiftest Wyandot warriors shall
be placed in line on the edge of the Long Clearing; they shall
start together, and the scalp of Deerfoot shall belong to him
who first overtakes him."</p>

<p>This scheme, after all, was merciful when compared with many
that were proposed; but the staking of a man's life on his fleetness,
when entirely unable to run, is an idea worthy of an American
Indian.</p>
