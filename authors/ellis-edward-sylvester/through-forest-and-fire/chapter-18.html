<p>As the hound belonged to Sam Harper and showed a disposition
to go with him, he was allowed to do so, the lad moving off to
the right and Nick Ribsam to the left, as was agreed upon.</p>

<p>Nick had not his father's watch with him, but Herbert Watrous
carried a handsome gold hunting-piece, which was now consulted
and showed it was nearly two o'clock.</p>

<p>"The days are getting short," said Sam Harper, with a doubtful
shake of the head; "that doesn't leave us more than three hours
of daylight, and it is hardly worth while to part company."</p>

<p>"What's the odds?" laughed Nick, who was anxious to look for
the deer; "we won't be far apart, as we may be to-morrow."</p>

<p>And, without waiting to discuss the question, he struck to the
left with his strong step, the others following the courses already
mentioned.</p>

<p>No afternoon could have been more charming, with the summer lingering
and mellowing the approaching winter.</p>

<p>The faint, smoky haze of the atmosphere, the clear sky, the warm
sun, the brilliant-hued vegetation in the woods, the faint cawing
of crows in the distance, and the flight of birds overhead, looking
like mathematical figures in India-ink gliding across the blue
heavens, the delicious languor everywhere: all these were at their
best, and he who was wandering through the rainbow-tinted forest,
where the sleepy waters flowed, could well understand why it was
the pioneers, like Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, and others, turned
their backs on civilization, and, plunging into the wilderness,
buried themselves for months from the sight of their fellow-men.</p>

<p>Sam Harper was moving quietly toward the north, when it seemed
to him that a large leaf suddenly blew forward from beneath his
feet and was carried swiftly over the ground, straight ahead and
away from him.</p>

<p>Looking closely, he discovered that it was a plump quail which
he had startled, and which was speeding from him. Although the
bird has short legs it runs very swiftly, and it was gone almost
before Sam identified it.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could only get a shot at you," said the lad, his mouth
fairly watering, "what a splendid supper you would make!"</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when a sudden whirring sound
broke the air, and he caught a glimpse of a second quail flying
like an arrow below the principal limbs.</p>

<p>Sam raised his rifle as quick as a flash, took aim as best he
could, and fired. Even the great Dr. Carver would have missed
under such circumstances, and the lad came nowhere near hitting
the game.</p>

<p>So swift was the flight of the bird, that as soon as the trigger
was pulled and Sam looked for it it had vanished. That man who
handles the rifle must be wonderfully skillful to bring down one
of those birds on the wing.</p>

<p>It is curious how the name of the common quail is disputed and
varied. There are plenty who will insist that I should have called
this bird a partridge, when, in point of fact, there is no true
representative of the partridge in America.</p>

<p>The spruce partridge is the Canada grouse; the partridge of New
England is the ruffed grouse; the partridge of the Middle and
Southern States is the quail, of which several varieties are called
partridges; while in Europe the birds which are called quails
are in reality partridges.</p>

<p>Without tiring my readers by attempting anything like a scientific
discussion of the question, I may say there are a dozen species
of quails found in North and Central America and the West Indies,
and Mr. Baird proposes that, as neither the name quail, partridge,
nor pheasant is properly given to any American bird, the species
to which I refer should be called the Bob White.</p>

<p>If this should be done, the smallest urchin will be able to recognize
the species from its peculiar call.</p>

<p>Sam Harper would have been glad indeed if he could have secured
one of these delicious birds for supper, but there was little
prospect of doing so. The game looks so much like the brown and
mottled leaves among which it searches for food, that a hunter
would almost place his foot upon one without observing it, while
the nest of the quail or partridge is almost as impossible to
find as the remains of an elephant in Ceylon, where it is said
no such remains have ever been discovered.</p>

<p>One of the lessons Sam had learned from his father was to reload
his gun immediately after firing it, so as to be ready for any
emergency. Accordingly, before stirring from his place, he threw
out the shell from his breech-loader and replaced it with a new
cartridge.</p>

<p>Just as he did so, he heard the report of a gun only a short
distance to the left, at a point where Herbert Watrous should
have been.</p>

<p>"He's scared up something," was the natural conclusion of Sam,
who smiled as he added; "I wonder whether he could hit a bear
a dozen feet off with that wonderful Remington of his. It's a
good weapon, and I wish I owned one; but I wouldn't start out
to hunt big game until I learned something about it."</p>

<p>The boy waited a minute, listening for some signal from his companion,
but none was heard and he moved on again.</p>

<p>Sam, like many an amateur hunter, began to appreciate the value
of a trained hunting dog. Bowser was not a pure-blooded hound;
he was fat and he was faultily trained. He had stumbled upon the
trail of the buck by accident and had plunged ahead in pursuit,
until "pumped," when he seemed to lose all interest in the sport.</p>

<p>He now stayed close to Sam, continually looking up in his face
as if to ask him when he was going to stop the nonsense and go
back home.</p>

<p>He scarcely pricked his ears when the quail ran ahead of him,
and paid no attention to the whirring made by the other. He had
had all he wanted of that kind of amusement and showed no disposition
to tire himself any further.</p>
