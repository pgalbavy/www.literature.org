<p>Everybody seemed to be there, either splashing about in the Atlantic
or playing ball on the beach or congregated along the sands observant
of the jolly, riotous scene sparkling under the magnificence of
a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>Hamil nodded to a few people as he sauntered toward the surf;
he stopped and spoke to his aunt and Colonel Vetchen, who informed
him that Virginia and Cuyp were somewhere together chastely embracing
the ocean; he nodded to old Classon who was toddling along the
wet sands in a costume which revealed considerable stomach; he
saw Malcourt, knee-deep, hovering around Shiela, yet missing nothing
of what went on around him, particularly wherever the swing of
a bathing-skirt caught his quick, handsome eyes.</p>

<p>Then Cecile stretched out an inviting hand to him from the water
and he caught it, and together they hurled themselves head first
into the surf, swimming side by side out to the raft.</p>

<p>"It's nice to see you again," said the girl. "Are you going to
be agreeable now and go about with us? There's a luncheon at two&mdash;your
fair friend Virginia Suydam has asked us, much to our surprise&mdash;but
after that I'm quite free if you've anything to propose."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, pink and fresh as a wet rose, balanced
there on the edge of the rocking raft.</p>

<p>"Anything to propose?" he repeated; "I don't know; there's scarcely
anything I wouldn't propose to you. So you're going to Virginia's
luncheon?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> am; Shiela won't." She frowned. "It's just as it
was two years ago when Louis Malcourt tagged after her every second.
It's stupid, but we can't count on them any more."</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;does Malcourt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tag after Shiela? Haven't you seen it? You've been too busy
to notice. I wish you wouldn't work every minute. There was the
jolliest sort of a dance at the O'Haras' last night&mdash;while you
were fast asleep. I know you were because old Jonas told mother
you had fallen asleep in your chair with your head among a pile
of blue-prints. On my way to the dance I wanted to go in and tie
one of Shiela's cunning little lace morning caps under your chin,
but Jessie wouldn't go with me. They're perfectly sweet and madly
fashionable&mdash;these little Louis <em>XVI </em>caps. I'll show you
one some day."</p>

<p>For a few moments the girl rattled on capriciously, swinging
her stockinged legs in the smooth green swells that rose above
her knees along the raft's edge; and he sat silent beside her,
half-listening, half-preoccupied, his eyes instinctively searching
the water's edge beyond.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>hadn't noticed that Louis Malcourt was so devoted
to your sister," he said.</p>

<p>Cecile looked up quickly, but detected only amiable indifference
in the young fellow's face.</p>

<p>"They're-always together; <em>elle s'affiche Ã  la fin</em>!"
she said impatiently. "Shiela was only eighteen before; she's
twenty now, and old enough to know whether she wants to marry
a man like that or not."</p>

<p>Hamil glanced around at her incredulously. "Marry Malcourt?"</p>

<p>But Cecile went on headlong in the wake of her own ideas.</p>

<p>"He's a sort of a relative; we've always known him. He and Gray
used to go camping in Maine and he often spent months in our house.
But for two years now, he's been comparatively busy&mdash;he's Mr.
Portlaw's manager, you know, and we've seen nothing of him&mdash;which
was quite agreeable to me."</p>

<p>Hamil rose, unquiet. "I thought <em>you</em> were rather impressed
by Shiela," continued the girl. "I really did think so, Mr. Hamil."</p>

<p>"Your sister predicted that I'd lose my heart and senses to <em>you</em>"
said Hamil, laughing and reseating himself beside her.</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have. Who could help it?"</p>

<p>The girl considered him smilingly.</p>

<p>"You're the nicest of men," she said. "If you hadn't been so
busy I'm certain we'd have had a desperate affair. But&mdash;as it
is&mdash;and it makes me perfectly furious &mdash;I have only the most
ridiculously commonplace and comfortable affection for you&mdash;the
sort which prompts mother to send you quinine and talcum powder&mdash;"</p>

<p>Balanced there side by side they fell to laughing.</p>

<p>"Sentiment? Yes," she said; "but oh! it's the kind that offers
witch-hazel and hot-water bottles to the best beloved! Mr. Hamil,
why can't we flirt comfortably like sensibly frivolous people!"</p>

<p>"I wish we could, Cecile."</p>

<p>"I wish so, too, Garret. No, that's too formal &mdash;Garry!
There, that ends our chances!"</p>

<p>"You're the jolliest family I ever knew," he said. "You can scarcely
understand how pleasant it has been for me to camp on the edges
of your fireside and feel the home-warmth a little&mdash;now and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you remain so aloof then?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean to. But my heart is in this business of your father's&mdash;the
more deeply in because of his kindness&mdash;and your mother's&mdash;and
for all your sakes. You know I can scarcely realise it &mdash;I've
been with you only a month, and yet you've done so much for me&mdash;received
me so simply, so cordially&mdash;that the friendship seems to be of
years instead of hours."</p>

<p>"That is the trouble," sighed Cecile; "you and I never had a
chance to be frivolous; I'm no more self-conscious with you than
I am with Gray. Tell me, why was Virginia Suydam so horrid to
us at first?"</p>

<p>Hamil reddened. "You mustn't ask me to criticise my own kin,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you couldn't do that.... And Miss Suydam has
been more civil recently. It's a mean, low, and suspicious thing
to say, but I suppose it's because&mdash;but I don't think I'll say
it after all."</p>

<p>"It's nicer not to," said Hamil. They both knew perfectly well
that Virginia's advances were anything but disinterested. For,
alas! even the men of her own entourage were now gravitating toward
the Cardross family; Van Tassel Cuyp was continually wrinkling
his nose and fixing his dead-blue eyes in that direction; little
Colonel Vetchen circled busily round and round that centre of
attraction, even Courtlandt Classon evinced an inclination to
toddle that way. Besides Louis Malcourt had arrived; and Virginia
had never quite forgotten Malcourt who had made one at a house
party in the Adirondacks some years since, although even when
he again encountered her, Malcourt had retained no memory of the
slim, pallid girl who had for a week been his fellow-guest at
Portlaw's huge camp on Luckless Lake.</p>

<p>"Virginia Suydam is rather an isolated girl," said Hamil thoughtfully.
"She lives alone; and it is not very gay for a woman alone in
the world; not the happiest sort of life.... Virginia has always
been very friendly to me&mdash;always. I hope you will find her amusing."</p>

<p>"I'm going to her luncheon," said Cecile calmly. "It's quite
too absurd for her to feel any more doubt about us socially than
we feel about her. That is why I am going. Shall we swim?"</p>

<p>He rose; she clasped his offered hand and sprang to her feet,
ready for the water again. But at that instant Malcourt's dark,
handsome head appeared on the crest of a surge close by, and the
next moment that young gentleman scrambled aboard the raft, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"Hello, Cecile!" he gasped; "Hello, Hamil! Shiela thought it
must be you, but I was sceptical. Whew! That isn't much of a swim;
I must be out of condition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Late hours, cards, and highballs," observed Cecile scornfully.
"You're horridly smooth and fat, Louis."</p>

<p>Malcourt turned to Hamil.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you've emerged from your shell at last. The rumour
is that you're working too hard."</p>

<p>"There's no similar rumour concerning you," observed Cecile,
who had never made any pretence of liking Malcourt. "Please swim
out to sea, if you've nothing more interesting to tell us. I've
just managed to decoy Mr. Hamil here and I'd like to converse
with him in peace."</p>

<p>Malcourt, arms folded, balanced himself easily on the raft's
pitching edge and glanced at her with that amiably bored expression
characteristic of him when rebuffed by a woman. On such occasions
his eyes resembled the half-closed orbs of a teased but patient
cat; and Cecile had once told him so.</p>

<p>"There's a pretty rumour afloat concerning your last night's
performance at the Beach Club," said the girl disdainfully. "A
boy like you, making himself conspicuous by his gambling!"</p>

<p>Malcourt winced, but as the girl had apparently heard nothing
to his discredit except about his gambling, he ventured an intelligent
sidelong glance at Hamil.</p>

<p>The latter looked at him inquiringly; Malcourt laughed.</p>

<p>"You haven't been to the Beach Club yet, have you, Hamil? I'll
get you a card if you like."</p>

<p>Cecile, furious, turned her back and went head first into the
sea.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Hamil briefly, and followed her. Malcourt took
to the water leisurely, going out of his way to jeer at and splash
Portlaw, who was labouring like a grampus inshore; then he circled
within observation distance of several pretty girls, displayed
his qualities as a swimmer for their benefit, and finally struck
out shoreward.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the surf he looked about for Shiela. She
was already half-way to the beach, walking with Cecile and Hamil
toward the pavilion; and, starting across the shallows to overtake
her, he suddenly came face to face with Virginia Suydam.</p>

<p>She was moving hip-deep out through the seething tide, slim,
graceful, a slight flush tinting the usual delicate pallor of
her cheeks. Gussie Vetchen bobbed nimbly about in the vicinity,
very busy trying to look at everybody and keep his balance at
the same time. Miss Palliser was talking to Cuyp.</p>

<p>As Malcourt waded past, he and Miss Suydam exchanged a pleasantly
formal greeting; and, for the second time, something in her casual
gaze&mdash;the steadiness of her pretty green-tinted eyes, perhaps&mdash;perhaps
their singular colour&mdash;interested him.</p>

<p>"You did not ask <em>me</em> to your luncheon," he said gaily,
as he passed her through the foam.</p>

<p>"No, only petticoats, Mr. Malcourt. I am sorry that your&mdash;fiancÃ©e
isn't coming."</p>

<p>He halted, perfectly aware of the deliberate and insolent indiscretion
of her reply. Every line of her supple figure accented the listless,
disdainful intention. As he remained motionless she turned, bent
gracefully and laid her palms flat on the surface of the water,
then looked idly over her shoulder at him.</p>

<p>He waded back close to her, she watching him advance without
apparent interest&mdash;but watching him nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Have you heard that anybody and myself are supposed to be engaged?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied coolly; "have you?"</p>

<p>A dark flush mantled his face and he choked.</p>

<p>For a moment they stood so; her brows were raised a trifle.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked at last. "Have I made you <em>very</em> angry,
Mr. Malcourt?" She waded out a step or two toward the surf, facing
it. The rollers breaking just beyond made her foothold precarious;
twice she nearly lost her balance; the third time he caught her
hand to steady her and held it as they faced the surges, swaying
together.</p>

<p>She did not look again at him. They stood for a while unsteadily,
her hand in his grasp.</p>

<p>"Why on earth did you say such a thing to me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;know," she said simply; "I really don't, Mr. Malcourt."</p>

<p>And it was true; for their slight acquaintance warranted neither
badinage nor effrontery; and she did not understand the sudden
impulse toward provocation, unless it might be her contempt for
Shiela Cardross. And that was the doing of Mrs. Van Dieman.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, looking up at him, and after a moment,
down at their clasped hands. "Are we going to swim out, Mr. Malcourt?&mdash;or
shall we continue to pose as newly married for the benefit of
the East Coast?"</p>

<p>"We'll sit in the sands," he said. "We'll probably find a lot
of things to say to each other." But he dropped her fingers&mdash;gently.</p>

<p>"Unless you care to join your&mdash;care to join Miss Cardross."</p>

<p>Even while she spoke she remained calmly amazed at the commonness
of her own speech, the astonishing surface streak of unsuspected
vulgarity which she was naÃ¯vely exhibiting to this man.</p>

<p>Vetchen came noisily splashing up to join them, but he found
neither of them very attentive to him as they walked slowly to
the beach and up to the dry, hot sand.</p>

<p>Virginia curled up in the sand; Malcourt extended himself full
length at her feet, clasped fingers supporting his head, smooth,
sun-browned legs crossed behind him; and he looked like a handsome
and rather sulky boy lying there, kicking up his heels insouciantly
or stretching luxuriously in the sun.</p>

<p>Vetchen, who had followed, began an interminable story on the
usual theme of his daughter, Mrs. Tom O'Hara, illustrating her
beauty, her importance, and the incidental importance of himself;
and it was with profound surprise and deep offence that he discovered
that neither Malcourt nor Miss Suydam were listening. Indeed,
in brief undertones, they had been carrying on a guarded conversation
of their own all the while; and presently little Vetchen took
his leave with a hauteur quite lost on those who had so unconsciously
affronted him.</p>

<p>"Of course it is very civil of you to say you remember me," Virginia
was saying, "but I am perfectly aware you do not."</p>

<p>Malcourt insisted that he recalled their meeting at Portlaw's
Adirondack camp on Luckless Lake two years before, cudgelling
his brains at the same time to recollect seeing Virginia there
and striving to remember some corroborative incident. But all
he could really recall was a young and unhappily married woman
to whom he had made violent love&mdash;and it was even an effort for
him to remember her name.</p>

<p>"How desperately you try!" observed Virginia, leisurely constructing
a little rampart of sand between them. "Listen to me, Mr. Malcourt"&mdash;she
raised her eyes, and again the hint of provocation in them preoccupied
him&mdash;"I remembered you, and I have sometimes hoped we might meet
again. Is that amends for the very bad taste I displayed in speaking
of your engagement before it has been announced?"</p>

<p>"I am not engaged&mdash;to be married," he said deliberately.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily, and he sustained the strain of the
gaze in his own untroubled fashion.</p>

<p>"You are not engaged?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She straightened up, resting her weight on one bare arm, then
leisurely laid her length on the burning sands and, face framed
between her fingers, considered him in silence.</p>

<p>In her attitude, in her very conversation with this man there
was, for her, a certain sense of abandonment; a mental renouncing
of all that had hitherto characterised her in her relations with
an always formal world; as though that were necessary to meet
him on his own level.</p>

<p>Never before had she encountered the temptation, the opportunity,
or the person where the impulse to discard convention, conviction,
training, had so irresistibly presented itself. Nor could she
understand it now; yet she was aware, instinctively, that she
was on the verge of the temptation and the opportunity; that there
existed a subtle something in this man, in herself, that tempted
to conventional relaxation. In all her repressed, regulated, and
self-suppressed career, all that had ever been in her of latent
daring, of feminine audacity, of caprice, of perverse provocation,
stirred in her now, quickening with the slightest acceleration
of her pulses.</p>

<p>Apparently a man of her own caste, yet she had never been so
obscurely stirred by a man of her own caste&mdash;had never instinctively
divined in other men the streak which this man, from the first
interchange of words, had brought out in her.</p>

<p>Aware of his attraction, hazily convinced that she had no confidence
in him, the curious temptation persisted and grew; and she felt
very young and very guilty like a small child consenting to parley
with another child whose society has been forbidden. And it seemed
to her that somehow she had already demeaned herself by the tentative
toward a common understanding with an intellect and principles
of a grade inferior to her own.</p>

<p>"That was a very pretty woman you were so devoted to in the Adirondacks,"
she said.</p>

<p>He recalled the incident with a pleasant frankness which left
her unconvinced.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came over her that she had had enough of him&mdash;more
than was good for her, and she sat up straight, primly retying
her neckerchief.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" he was saying, too civilly; but on her way to the
pavilion she could not remember what she had replied, or how she
had rid herself of him.</p>

<p>Inside the pavilion she saw Hamil and Shiela Cardross, already
dressed, watching the lively occupants of the swimming-pool; and
she exchanged a handshake with the former and a formal nod with
the latter.</p>

<p>"Garret, your aunt is worrying because somebody told her that
there are snakes in the district where you are at work. Come in
some evening and reassure her." And to Shiela: "So sorry you cannot
come to my luncheon, Miss Cardross. &mdash;You <em>are</em> Miss
Cardross, aren't you? I've been told otherwise."</p>

<p>Hamil looked up, pale and astounded; but Shiela answered, undisturbed:</p>

<p>"My sister Cecile is the younger; yes, I am Miss Cardross."</p>

<p>And Hamil realised there had been two ways of interpreting Virginia's
question, and he reddened, suddenly appalled at his own knowledge
and at his hasty and gross conclusions.</p>

<p>If Shiela noticed the quick changes in his face she did not appear
to, nor the curious glance that Virginia cast at him.</p>

<p>"<em>So</em> sorry," said Miss Suydam again, "for if you are
going to be so much engaged to-day you will no doubt also miss
the tea for that pretty Mrs. Ascott."</p>

<p>"No," said Shiela, "I wouldn't think of missing that." And carelessly
to Hamil: "As you and I have nothing on hand to-day, I'll take
you over to meet Mrs. Ascott if you like."</p>

<p>Which was a notice to Virginia that Miss Cardross had declined
her luncheon from deliberate disinclination.</p>

<p>Hamil, vaguely conscious that all was not as agreeable as the
surface of things indicated, said cordially that he'd be very
glad to go anywhere with Shiela to meet anybody, adding to Virginia
that he'd heard of Mrs. Ascott but could not remember when or
where.</p>

<p>"Probably you've heard of her often enough from Louis Malcourt,"
said Virginia. "He and I were just recalling his frenzied devotion
to her in the Adirondacks; that," she added smilingly to Shiela,
"was before Mrs. Ascott got her divorce from her miserable little
French count and resumed her own name. She was the most engaging
creature when Mr. Malcourt and I met her two years ago."</p>

<p>Shiela, who had been listening with head partly averted and grave
eyes following the antics of the divers in the pool, turned slowly
and encountered Virginia's smile with a straight, cold gaze of
utter distrust.</p>

<p>Nothing was said for a moment; then Virginia spoke smilingly
again to Hamil concerning his aunt's uneasiness, turned toward
Shiela, exchanged formal adieux with her, and walked on toward
her dressing-room and shower. Hamil and Miss Cardross turned the
other way.</p>

<p>When Shiela was seated in her double wheel-chair with Hamil beside
her, she looked up through her veil unsmiling into his serious
face.</p>

<p>"Did you notice anything particularly impertinent in Miss Suydam's
question?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"What question?"</p>

<p>"When she asked me whether I was Miss Cardross."</p>

<p>The slow colour again burned his bronzed skin. He made no reply,
nor did she await any after a silent consideration of his troubled
face.</p>

<p>"Where did you hear about me?" she asked.</p>

<p>She had partly turned in her seat, resting both gloved hands
on the crook of her folded sunshade, and leaning a little toward
him.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," he said; "whatever I heard I heard unwillingly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <em>have</em> heard?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>The remainder of the journey was passed in silence. On the road
they met Mrs. Cardross and Jessie Carrick driving to a luncheon;
later, Gray passed in his motor with his father.</p>

<p>"I have an idea that you and I are to lunch alone," said Hamil
as they reached the house; and so it turned out, for Malcourt
was going off with Portlaw somewhere and Cecile was dressing for
Virginia's luncheon.</p>

<p>"Did you care to go with me to the Ascott-O'Hara function?" asked
Shiela, pausing on the terrace. Her voice was listless, her face
devoid of animation.</p>

<p>"I don't care where I go if I may go with you," he said, with
a new accent of intention in his voice which did not escape her.</p>

<p>She went slowly up the stairs untying her long veil as she mounted.
Cecile in a bewildering hat and gown emerged upon the terrace
before Shiela reappeared, and found Hamil perched upon the coquina
balustrade, poring over a pocketful of blue-prints; and she said
very sweetly: "Good-bye, my elder brother. Will you promise to
take the best of care of our little sister Shiela while I'm away?"</p>

<p>"The very best," he said, sliding feet foremost to the terrace.
"Heavens, Cecile, you certainly are bewitching in those clothes!"</p>

<p>"It is what they were built for, brother," she said serenely.
"Good-bye; we won't shake hands on account of my gloves.... Do
be nice to Shiela. She isn't very gay these days &mdash;I don't
know why. I believe she has rather missed you."</p>

<p>Hamil tucked her into her chair, the darky pedalled off; then
the young man returned to the terrace where presently a table
for two was brought and luncheon announced as Shiela Cardross
appeared.</p>

<p>Hamil displayed the healthy and undiscriminating appetite of
a man who is too busy mentally and physically to notice what he
eats and drinks; Shiela touched nothing except fruit. She lighted
his cigarette for him before the coffee, and took one herself,
turning it thoughtfully over and over between her delicately shaped
fingers; but at a glance of inquiry from him:</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she said; "it burns my tongue. Besides I may some
day require it as a novelty to distract me&mdash;so I'll wait."</p>

<p>She rose a moment later, and stood, distrait, looking out across
the sunlit world. He at her elbow, head bent, idly watched the
smoke curling upward from his cigarette.</p>

<p>Presently, as though moved by a common impulse, they turned together,
slowly traversed the terrace and the long pergola all crimson
and white with bougainvillia and jasmine, and entered the jungle
road beyond the courts where carved seats of coquina glimmered
at intervals along the avenue of oaks and palmettos and where
stone-edged pools reflected the golden green dusk of the semi-tropical
foliage above.</p>

<p>On the edge of one of these basins the girl seated herself; without
her hat and gloves and in a gown which exposed throat and neck
she always looked younger and more slender to him, the delicate
modelling of the neck and its whiteness was accentuated by the
silky growth of the brown hair which close to the nape and brow
was softly blond like a child's.</p>

<p>The frail, amber-tinted little dragon-flies of the South came
hovering over the lotus bloom that edged the basin; long, narrow-shaped
butterflies whose velvet-black wings were barred with brilliant
stripes of canary yellow fluttered across the forest aisle; now
and then a giant papilio sailed high under the arched foliage
on tiger-striped wings of chrome and black, or a superb butterfly
in pearl white and malachite green came flitting about the sparkle-berry
bloom.</p>

<p>The girl nodded toward it. "That is a scarce butterfly here,"
she said. "Gray would be excited. I wish we had his net here."</p>

<p>"It is the <em>Victorina</em>, isn't it?" he asked, watching
the handsome, nervous-winged creature which did not seem inclined
to settle on the white flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes, the <em>Victorina steneles</em>. Are you interested?"</p>

<p>"The generation I grew up with collected," he said. "I remember
my cabinet, and some of the names. But I never saw any fellows
of this sort in the North."</p>

<p>"Your memory is good?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "for what I care about"&mdash;he looked up at her&mdash;"for
those I care about my memory is good, I never forget kindness&mdash;nor
confidence given&mdash;nor a fault forgiven."</p>

<p>She bent forward, elbows on knees, chin propped on both linked
hands.</p>

<p>"Do you understand now," she said, "why I could not afford the
informality of our first meeting? What you have heard about me
explains why I can scarcely afford to discard convention, does
it not, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>She went on, her white fingers now framing her face and softly
indenting the flushed skin:</p>

<p>"I don't know who has talked to you, or what you have heard;
but I knew by your expression&mdash;there at the swimming-pool&mdash;that
you had heard enough to embarrass you and&mdash;and hurt me very, very
keenly."</p>

<p>"Calypso!" he broke out impulsively; but she shook her head.
"Let <em>me</em> tell you if it must be told, Mr. Hamil.... Father
and mother are dreadfully sensitive; I have only known about it
for two years; two years ago they told me&mdash;had to tell me....
Well&mdash;it still seems hazy and incredible.... I was educated in
a French convent&mdash;if you know what that means. All my life I have
been guarded&mdash;sheltered from knowledge of evil; I am still unprepared
to comprehend&mdash;... And I am still very ignorant; I know that....
So you see how it was with me; a girl awakened to such self-knowledge
cannot grasp it entirely&mdash;cannot wholly convince herself except
at moments&mdash;at night. Sometimes&mdash;when a crisis threatens&mdash;and
one has lain awake long in the dark&mdash;"</p>

<p>She gathered her knees in her arms and stared at the patch of
sunlight that lay across the hem of her gown, leaving her feet
shod in gold.</p>

<p>"I don't know how much difference it really makes to the world.
I suppose I shall learn&mdash;if people are to discuss me. How much
difference does it make, Mr. Hamil?"</p>

<p>"It makes none to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The world extends beyond your pleasant comradeship," she said.
"How does the world regard a woman of no origin&mdash;whose very name
is a charity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shiela!"</p>

<p>"W-what?" she said, trying to smile; and then slowly laid her
head in her hands, covering her face.</p>

<p>She had given way, very silently, for as he bent close to her
he felt the tearful aroma of her uneven breath&mdash;the feverish flush
on cheek and hand, the almost imperceptible tremor of her slender
body&mdash;rather close to him now.</p>

<p>When she had regained her composure, and her voice was under
command, she straightened up, face averted.</p>

<p>"You are quite perfect, Mr. Hamil; you have not hurt me with
one misguided and well-intended word. That is exactly as it should
be between us&mdash;must always be."</p>

<p>"Of course," he said slowly.</p>

<p>She nodded, still looking away from him. "Let us each enjoy our
own griefs unmolested. You have yours?"</p>

<p>"No, Shiela, I haven't any griefs."</p>

<p>"Come to me when you have; I shall not humiliate you with words
to shame your intelligence and my own. If you suffer you suffer;
but it is well to be near a friend&mdash;not <em>too</em> near, Mr.
Hamil."</p>

<p>"Not too near," he repeated.</p>

<p>"No; that is unendurable. The counter-irritant to grief is sanity,
not emotion. When a woman is a little frightened the presence
of the unafraid is what steadies her."</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder into the water, reached down, broke
off a blossom of wild hyacinth, and, turning, drew it through
the button-hole of his coat.</p>

<p>"You certainly are very sweet to me," she said quietly. And,
laughing a little: "The entire family adores you with pills&mdash;and
I've now decorated you with the lovely curse of our Southern rivers.
But&mdash;there are no such things as weeds; a weed is only a miracle
in the wrong place.... Well&mdash;shall we walk and moralise or remain
here and make cat-cradle conversation?... You are looking at me
very solemnly."</p>

<p>"I was thinking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That, perhaps, I never before knew a girl as well as I know
you."</p>

<p>"Not even Miss Suydam?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no! I never dreamed of knowing her &mdash;I mean her real
self. You understand, she and I have always taken each other for
granted&mdash;never with any genuine intimacy."</p>

<p>"Oh! And&mdash;this&mdash;ours&mdash;is genuine intimacy?"</p>

<p>"Is it not?"</p>

<p>For a moment her teeth worried the bright velvet of her lip,
then meeting his gaze:</p>

<p>"I mean to be&mdash;honest&mdash;with you," she said with a tremor in her
voice; but her regard wavered under his. "I mean to be," she repeated
so low he scarcely heard her. Then with a sudden animation a little
strained: "When this winter has become a memory let it be a happy
one for you and me. And by the same token you and I had better
think about dressing. You don't mind, do you, if I take you to
meet Mrs. Ascott?&mdash;she was Countess de Caldelis; it's taken her
years to secure her divorce."</p>

<p>Hamil remembered the little dough-faced, shrimp-limbed count
when he first came over with the object of permitting somebody
to support him indefinitely so that later, in France, he could
in turn support his mistresses in the style to which they earnestly
desired to become accustomed.</p>

<p>And now the American girl who had been a countess was back, a
little wiser, a little harder, and more cynical, with some of
the bloom rubbed off, yet much of her superficial beauty remaining.</p>

<p>"Alida Ascott," murmured Shiela. "Jessie was a bridesmaid. Poor
little girl! &mdash;I'm glad she's free. There were no children,"
she said, looking up at Hamil; "in that case a decent girl is
justified! Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he said, smiling; "I'm not one of those who believe
that such separations threaten us with social disintegration."</p>

<p>"Nor I. Almost every normal woman desires to live decently. She
has a right to. All young girls are ignorant. If they begin with
a dreadful but innocent mistake does the safety of society require
of them the horror of lifelong degradation? Then the safety of
such a society is not worth the sacrifice. That is my opinion."</p>

<p>"That settles a long-vexed problem," he said, laughing at her
earnestness.</p>

<p>But she looked at him, unsmiling, while he spoke, hands clasped
in her lap, the fingers twisting and tightening till the rose-tinted
nails whitened.</p>

<p>Men have only a vague idea of women's ignorance; how naturally
they are inclined to respond to a man; how the dominating egotism
of a man and his confident professions and his demands confuse
them; how deeply his appeals for his own happiness stir them to
pity.... They have heard of love&mdash;and they do not know. If they
ever dream of it it is not what they have imagined when a man
suddenly comes crashing through the barriers of friendship and
stuns them with an incoherent recital of his own desires. And
yet, in spite of the shock, it is with them instinctive to be
kind. No woman can endure an appeal unmoved; except for them there
would be no beggars; their charity is not a creed: it is the essence
of them, the beginning of all things for them&mdash;and the end.</p>

<p>The bantering smile had died out in Hamil's face; he sat very
still, interested, disturbed, and then wondering when his eyes
caught the restless manoeuvres of the little hands, constantly
in motion, interlacing, eloquent of the tension of self-suppression.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>He thought: "It is a cowardly thing for an egotist with an egotist's
early and lively knowledge of the world and of himself to come
clamouring to a girl for charity. It <em>is</em> true that almost
any man can make a young girl think she loves him if he is selfish
enough to do it. Is her ignorance a fault? All her training deprecates
any acquisition of worldly knowledge: it is not for her: her value
is in her ignorance. Then when she naturally makes some revolting
mistake and attempts to escape to decency and freedom once more
there is a hue and a cry from good folk and clergy. Divorce? It
is a good thing&mdash;as the last resort. And a woman need feel no
responsibility for the sort of society that would deprive a woman
of the last refuge she has!"</p>

<p>He raised his eyes, curiously, in time to intercept hers.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;you did not know me after all, it seems," she said with
a faint smile. "You never suspected in me a <em>Vierge Rouge</em>,
militant, champion of her downtrodden sex, haranguing whomsoever
would pay her the fee of his attention. Did you?"</p>

<p>And as he made no reply: "Your inference is that I have had some
unhappy love affair&mdash;some perilously close escape from&mdash;unhappy
matrimony." She shrugged. "As though a girl could plead only a
cause which concerned herself.... Tell me what you are thinking?"</p>

<p>She had risen, and he stood up before her, fascinated.</p>

<p>"Tell me!" she insisted; "I shall not let you go until you do!"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about you."</p>

<p>"Please don't!... Are you doing it yet?" closely confronting
him, hands behind her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," he said, unable to keep his eyes from her, all her
beauty and youth and freshness troubling him, closing in upon
him like subtle fragrance in the golden forest dusk.</p>

<p>"Are you still thinking about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The rare sweet laughter edged her lips, for an instant; then
something in his eyes checked her. Colour and laughter died out,
leaving a pale confused smile; and the straight gaze wavered,
grew less direct, yet lost not a shade of his expression which
also had changed.</p>

<p>Neither spoke; and after a moment they turned away, walking not
very near together toward the house.</p>

<p>The sunshine and the open somehow brought relief and the delicate
constraint between them relaxed as they sauntered slowly into
the house where Shiela presently went away to dress for the Ascott
function, and Hamil sat down on the veranda for a while, then
retired to undertake the embellishment of his own person.</p>
