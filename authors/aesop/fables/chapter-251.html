A FOX invited a Crane to supper and provided nothing for his
entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out
into a broad flat stone dish.  The soup fell out of the long bill
of the Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being
able to eat afforded the Fox much amusement.  The Crane, in his
turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon
with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck
and enjoy its contents at his leisure.  The Fox, unable even to
taste it, met with a fitting requital, after the fashion of her
own hospitality.

Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus 
 
ACCORDING to an ancient legend, the first man was made by
Jupiter, the first bull by Neptune, and the first house by
Minerva.  On the completion of their labors, a dispute arose as
to which had made the most perfect work.  They agreed to appoint
Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision.  Momus, however,
being very envious of the handicraft of each, found fault with
all.  He first blamed the work of Neptune because he had not made
the horns of the bull below his eyes, so he might better see
where to strike.  He then condemned the work of Jupiter, because
he had not placed the heart of man on the outside, that everyone
might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions
against the intended mischief.  And, lastly, he inveighed against
Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the
foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily
remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant.  Jupiter, indignant at
such inveterate faultfinding, drove him from his office of judge,
and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus.
