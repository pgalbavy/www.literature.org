<p>"How is it, Nat? Any light yet?"</p>

<p>"Not the least sign of one, and it’s my opinion it will be a
long time before we see another."</p>

<p>"What! you haven’t given up all hopes of reaching the camp? I
hope not, as I don’t relish the idea of camping out to-night."</p>

<p>"Nor I either; but I’m thinking it will come to that sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"Well, there are several hours yet, in which we must plod onward,"
I added, trudging wearily behind my companion.</p>

<p>Before going further, I may as well introduce my friend and myself.
My companion answered to the name of Nathan Todd, and was a native
of Maine. He was a tall, lank individual, with long, attentuated
limbs and an awkward appearance generally. He was very meager
and muscular, and when roused to a heat of passion, as quick and
powerful as the panther. His gait was an ungainly, straddling
one, and he was seemingly capable of anything but speed; but on
one or two occasions since leaving the States, he had shown a
fleetness of foot which was truly wonderful. He was a good, open-hearted
fellow, and one who, when driven to the wall, would be a dangerous
enemy. Once or twice, however, he had shown the white feather,
and his natural timidity would often evince itself. As a consequence,
Nat was not, perhaps, the safest companion in the hour of danger;
but, for all that, there was no one in our party whose presence
I would have preferred upon the night in which I introduce him
to notice. There was no imminent peril threatening us, and Nat
was a capital companion, who could while-away the hours, if he
chose, with his inexhaustible store of anecdote and humor. I knew
he entertained a warm affection for me, and would brave almost
any danger rather than be suspected of his only deficiency. A
single intimation would decide his course in a moment.</p>

<p>Nat wore a singular dress&mdash;half savage and half civilized. The
pants and shoes were such as are fashionable in the enlightened
world; but a capacious hunting-shirt encased his body, secured
around the waist by a heavy band, and much the same as are worn
by the hunters and natives of the Far West at the present day.
The most striking part of his dress, however, was the hat. This
he had brought with him from Maine, and it really seemed indestructible.
It was a gray color, and having lost its band a long time before,
had acquired the shape of a cone. When it rested on his head,
the edge reached the shoulders behind, and the eyebrows in front,
and the pointed peak was far off above the crown.</p>

<p>Nathan Todd’s face was full of shrewdness and good humor. He
had a large, curved nose, broad mouth, and a fine blue eye. The
chin was retreating; but this drawback was modified partly by
a long tuft of yellow hair, the only signs of beard upon his face,
except a shadowy mustache. The hair was long and sandy, and harmonized
well with the rest of his countenance. There was ever a contraction
of the eyebrows&mdash;a sort of unspoken question&mdash;so often seen in
persons from "down east," which indicated a prying, curious disposition.</p>

<p>As for myself, my name is William Relmond, and I hail from one
of the middle States. Shortly after the announcement of the discovery
of gold in California, I was seized with the lunacy that was carrying
its thousands to the Pacific coast. I was well situated in life
at home, but that was not considered. I must go and fish up a
fabulous fortune also. I had one brother and several sisters,
but our parents had been dead for some years, and we were residing
with an uncle, the guardian of each, until maturity. A favorable
opportunity offering I had made some preparation for the legal
profession; but I was never inclined to Coke, and had no intention
of pursuing the practice of the law in after life. At the age
of twenty, then, without a settled purpose in life, I determined
to make a journey to the El Dorado of the New World. I was not
influenced solely by the love of gain, in taking this step, but
the love of adventure urged me irresistibly on. I had heard wonderful
stories of the boundless prairies, of the wandering hordes of
Indians, their millions of buffaloes and horses, and the vast,
billowy ocean of verdure and sunshine, and the Far West seemed
the paradise of the world to me.</p>

<p>I was provided with an ample outfit at home, and departed amid
the tears of my good uncle and affectionate sisters. I proceeded
by the usual route to Independence, Missouri, where I made inquiries
of the trains which were constantly leaving the point for Oregon
and California. In my wanderings, I stumbled upon Nat Todd, my
present companion. He had just arrived from his distant home,
where he had left a widowed mother and a disconsolate sweetheart.
But he said he was going to return, in just two years from the
day he left, with a "rousing heap" of money, and intended to buy
"Squire Hunt’s farm," take Alminy down there, and live the rest
of his life. His frankness and humor impressed me favorably; and,
after a short conversation, we grasped hands, and swore to remain
by each other till our adventures were terminated by death or
a happy <em>dénouement</em>.</p>

<p>We engaged places in a train which left the next day. This company
numbered nigh two hundred persons, and was composed of all kinds
of characters, except females. There were French <em>voyageurs</em>,
Irishmen, and an agent of one of the western fur companies, and
the majority of the rest were those just from the plow or the
workshop. They had secured the services of an experienced guide,
and were well equipped for the perilous journey before them.</p>

<p>The overland route, at this time, was so alive with passing emigrants,
that few depredations were committed by the Indians. The savages
sometimes hung around companies, but as there were almost always
other whites in sight, they rarely ventured upon any greater crime
than pilfering. Nothing worthy of note occurred upon the journey
for a length of time. We experienced the usual mishaps and trials
of emigrants, but nothing more startling. We sometimes lost a
part of our baggage and provisions in crossing the rivers, and
were greatly discomforted by the terrific storms which often rage
in these regions. Then, again, we traveled mile after mile, and
hour after hour upon the dry, monotonous, glistening rolling prairie,
so wearied and tired of the scene that we hardly exchanged a syllable
for hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>At last, the plains of Kansas were reached. On the day in which
I introduce my friend and myself to notice, we had descried a
solitary antelope at a great distance upon the prairie, and set
out to bring it down. We left our horses behind, hoping to reach
the animal by stratagem. I approached it near enough to wound
it, when it made off with the speed of the wind. Expecting to
see it give out each moment, we followed it mile after mile, until
gathering darkness warned us that night was at hand, when we halted
in alarm, and were compelled to allow the antelope to escape,
while we endeavored to retrace our steps. The caravan was nowhere
in sight, and we doubted not that it had disappeared hours before.
We left the train about noon, and had been warned that they would
not halt or wait for us, and should we lose them, they would take
no pains to hunt us up. But we heeded not this, as we expected
to keep them constantly in view, and have the antelope cooked
for our supper.</p>

<p>But I have shown how widely we were mistaken. We were compelled
to see the night shut down around us, without bringing us any
hope of spending it with our friends; and at a late hour we were
still plodding aimlessly over the prairie.</p>

<p>"No light yet, Nat?" I asked, for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think you had asked that question about often
enough, to be suited with my answer."</p>

<p>"I expect to ask it a dozen times more."</p>

<p>"Then I’ll just answer at once for all, so I won’t be troubled
agin with talkin’. <em>No!</em> there’s the answer."</p>

<p>"I don’t know but what you are right, Nat. We must have come
a long distance, utterly unconscious of it, in our eagerness to
get that plaguey antelope, and it is useless to hope to reach
camp again before morning."</p>

<p>"That’s my opinion, exactly. That camp, I opine, is a good dozen
miles off yet."</p>

<p>"Then we may have a chance of reaching it still before morning,
as this bright moon favors us."</p>

<p>The moon, full and clear, had arisen an hour before, and its
light illumined the prairie for a great distance around. Far away,
on every hand, we could discern the blue outline of the horizon,
while the prairie seemed to roll up against it like the dark boundaries
of a mighty ocean. Everything was as silent and motionless as
though we were treading a region of death.</p>

<p>Mile after mile, we trudged on, beguiling the time by conversation.
The ground was dry and hard, and the vegetation scarce and stunted.
The day had been quite warm, and there was a delicious coolness
about the evening air that made it pleasant to walk an hour or
so; but as more than double that time had expired since we commenced,
it had long been exceedingly wearisome to us.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether those fellows will go a foot out of the way
to pick us up," muttered Nat, half to himself.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe they will. They told us they wouldn’t and they
value their time too highly to waste it for a couple who are of
no account to them, especially since we can fall in with other
trains."</p>

<p>"I reckon they’re of some account to us, being they have got
both our horses and considerable of our traveling apparatus."</p>

<p>"That is too true, Nat. In fact, since we have been walking here,
I have persuaded myself that those fellows would, just as likely
as not, turn something out of the way to get rid of us."</p>

<p>"Somehow or other, I’ve felt just the same for a week."</p>

<p>"Then, if we value our property, we mustn’t let them slip."</p>

<p>"No; I’ll be shot, if we must!" exclaimed Nat, half angrily,
striking at once into a more rapid walk. "If they run off with
my mare, I’ll &mdash;I’ll&mdash;" and again he strode faster over the
prairie.</p>

<p>Long&mdash;long, we journeyed in silence. Nat’s apprehensions had
been aroused, and he was willing to walk the whole night to come
up with those in whose honesty he had so little faith. Now and
then he would mutter incoherently to himself and shoot ahead,
keeping me almost on a run to maintain my place beside him. Suddenly
he halted, and turned upon me with an expression I shall never
forget. I could see his eyes expanded to twice their usual size,
and his whole face aglow beneath his monstrous hat, as he asked
in a cold whisper:</p>

<p>"Wonder if there’s Injins about to-night."</p>

<p>I laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Why, Nat, you ain’t afraid, are you?"</p>

<p>"Who said I was afraid? I just asked a question."</p>

<p>"What possessed you to ask such a question?"</p>

<p>"Don’t know; just come into my mind. Do you s’pose there are
any Injins roving round the country to-night?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell, but I think it extremely probable.
Are you fearful that there are some upon our trail?"</p>

<p>"There might be! No; I was thinking if we should come across
any of them, they might be able to tell us whether any of them
chaps think we’re lost, and have run off with my mare."</p>

<p>"Should we meet a lot of those savages, no doubt they would tell
us something else besides that."</p>

<p>"I expect so," and he wheeled around and strode ahead again.
It was now getting near midnight, and I was completely worn out.
It was out of the question to reach the camp that night, and we
might as well submit to our fate at once, so I spoke rather decidedly.</p>

<p>"I’m tired of this."</p>

<p>Nat turned and looked at me a second, and then answered:</p>

<p>"So am I. We’ve to camp out to-night, and there’s no use in waiting
till morning afore we do it. Ain’t it lucky you brought your blanket
with you? It would go hard to do without that to-night."</p>

<p>"I brought it with me by merest chance, not thinking I should
need it. It was indeed fortunate; and now let us prepare to use
it."</p>

<p>There was not much choice on the hard but warm earth. My blanket
was ample and sufficient for us both. After some search, a small
depression was selected, and in this I spread my heavy blanket.
We then stretched ourselves upon it, pulled the ends over us,
being sure to inclose our rifles in its folds, and resigned ourselves
to sleep. In that lone hour, I forgot not that there was one arm
upon which I could rely, and One only who could watch over me
until morning, and to that protection I appealed.</p>

<p>Ere the sun was fairly above the horizon, we were up and upon
our way. Knowing the company would not be in motion for several
hours, we hoped to reach them before they breakfasted, and have
a laugh over our night’s adventure. Nat led the way, and took
long, rapid strides over the ground, seemingly oblivious of the
existence of any one else. I kept beside him, now and then venturing
a remark, but receiving no answer or intimation that I was heard.</p>

<p>Suddenly, my friend came to a dead halt, dropped the butt of
his rifle to the earth with a ringing clamp, and wheeled upon
me with one of those indescribable looks. I had seen these before,
so that I knew something unusual was agitating him.</p>

<p>"What’s the trouble now?"</p>

<p>"It’s no use; we’ll never see that company agin."</p>

<p>"What makes you think thus?"</p>

<p>"I know so. I had a dream last night that my mare was gone for
ever and ever, and I know she is. Don’t you remember that fur
agent told us they’d change the direction they’s traveling some
time yesterday? They hadn’t done it when we left them, and they
done it as soon as we got out of sight, I warrant."</p>

<p>I now remembered hearing our guide remark, as also did the fur
agent with us, that the trail we were following made an abrupt
bend some miles ahead. We were traveling northeast at that time,
and the contemplated change was nearly due southwest. This fact
had entirely escaped our minds, until it now occurred to Nat,
and we had, consequently, been proceeding in a wrong direction.
By referring to the sun, we found we had gone far too much to
the east in order to intercept the train, which was now in all
probability many leagues to the southwest.</p>

<p>This was a discovery which was overwhelming. We had then been
journeying in a direction which had brought us not a foot nearer
the company than if we had remained motionless; and it was certain
that the party was irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>"This is a pleasant discovery, Nat."</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"I see no hope for your mare. She is probably a good day’s journey
distant, and we do not know what direction to take to reach her."</p>

<p>"That’s it," replied Nat, ill-humoredly; "if I knowed sure what
way to tramp to find her, I wouldn’t stop till I’d laid my hands
on her for a certainty; but this trudging along, and just as like
as not going away from her all the time, isn’t the thing."</p>

<p>"I see no course left then, but to proceed south, in the hope
of falling in with some emigrant train, or in striking the Oregon
trail, north, and getting into California ahead of them."</p>

<p>"The Oregon trail will have to be our destination, then. If these
fellows find they’ve got the start of us, they won’t give us a
chance to come up again, and we might as well try to catch the
whirlwind as to follow them. No; we must try the ready for them
when they come. How far is the trail off?"</p>

<p>"It can’t be more than a day’s journey; the trail follows the
Platte through Nebraska, and I’m pretty sure we can reach it by
nightfall, if we proceed pretty steadily and rapidly."</p>

<p>The day was clear and pleasant, and the sky devoid of the least
signs of threatening storm. There were two or three white clouds
straggling off in the western horizon, but the sky was of a deep
clear blue. We were now proceeding in a northward direction, intending
to strike the Platte at the nearest point. South, east, and west
the small waving hills of the prairie stretched, unrelieved by
the slightest object, except in the west the far-off outline of
some mountain-peak was just visible, resembling a slight pointed
cloud against the blue sky. This disappeared at noon, and we were
again like wanderers upon the illimitable sea. A short time after,
Nat’s keen vision detected a number of black, moving specks far
to the westward.</p>

<p>"An emigrant train, perhaps," I suggested.</p>

<p>"They’re Pawnee Injins as sure as the world, and we’d better
give them a wide berth."</p>

<p>"Pawnee Indians! How do you know that? You never have been in
this section before?"</p>

<p>"That’s true, but you don’t s’pose I started out here without
first larning something ’bout the country and folks, do you? If
you do, you’re mighty mistaken. Just let me know in what part
of the country we are, and I’ll let you know what sights you will
see, that is, if we are going to see any at all. But let’s keep
to the east; I don’t want to keep them Pawnees in sight."</p>

<p>"The Pawnee Indians are reported friendly to the whites."</p>

<p>"Exactly; but have they been reported honest? If they should
come upon us and take a fancy to our rifles, what is there to
prevent them from taking them? And," added Nat, with a shrewd
shake of his head. "I’ve not faith enough in their good intentions
to want ’em in sight at this particular time."</p>

<p>There was a great deal of reason in his remarks, and it was not
unwillingly that I turned my face more to the northeast, and soon
saw them disappear from view.</p>

<p>Some time toward the middle of the afternoon we descried a solitary
buffalo ahead. He had apparently left his friends and wandered
about as though entirely lost. After considerable difficulty we
approached nigh enough to bring him down. He was quite poor, and
his flesh was strong and Oregon trail, and get into California
first, and be tough; but we were glad enough to get it, such as
it was. He was thrown on his face, with his knees bent under him,
a keen knife run along the spine with just sufficient force to
penetrate the skin, which was then pulled down each side. This
done, we cut the choice portions out. Nat reserved the buffalo-skin
for his blanket, and the rest was thrown away. We made a hearty
meal, and about the middle of the afternoon again set forward,
hoping to accomplish quite a distance ere nightfall.</p>

<p>Just at dark we reached a stream of considerable size, which
I afterward learned was the Republican Fork of Nebraska. The point
at which we struck it, was about where it leaves the territory
of Kansas and enters Nebraska. Although no considerable stream,
we concluded not to cross it before morning, and we made arrangements
for passing the night upon its banks. There was considerable timber
at different points, and a goodly quantity of driftwood lay scattered
along its banks. As the river was quite low, we gathered several
armfuls, and had a fire soon started. We had brought some meat
of the slain buffalo with us, but concluded not to cook supper,
as our appetites were satiated.</p>

<p>Seated round our fire, half-hidden in a depression in the river
bottom, with the dark, glistening stream flowing silently by,
and smoking our pipes, we naturally fell into an easy conversation.</p>

<p>"We can’t be far from the ‘trail,’ can we?" asked Nat.</p>

<p>"Farther than I suspected," I answered. "The Republican Fork,
which I am convinced is the stream out there, is over fifty miles
from the Platte, which, with several other streams must be crossed
before the trail is reached."</p>

<p>"Fudge! I don’t believe I can head off them fellows after all,
and my old mare and overcoat will go to thunder."</p>

<p>"They will go <em>somewhere</em> where you will never see them
again."</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> I’m bound to lose ’em, and I shan’t think any
more about them."</p>

<p>"That’s the best plan, Nat. They are no great loss."</p>

<p>"I sh’d like to know whether that greaser or fur agent took them
though," interrupted my friend, earnestly.</p>

<p>After this he fell into a fit of musing, and we remained silent
for some time. When the fire had burnt low, I arose and replenished
it. Nat looked anxiously at the roaring blaze, carrying ashes
and cinders high in the air, and reflecting far out upon the dark
river, and he remarked:</p>

<p>"Wonder if some Injins won’t see that."</p>

<p>"I guess not. We are so low down the bank that I think it can
be visible for no considerable distance upon the prairie, and
the bend in the river fortunately saves us from view up or down
the stream. The only point from which it would attract attention
is directly across from us."</p>

<p>"And it looks suspicious enough there," repeated Nat, in a whisper,
removing his pipe and gazing across the river.</p>

<p>It did indeed look gloomy, forbidding, and threatening. Our fire
was nearly on the level with the water, which rolled darkly and
noisily at our very feet; and when its crackling blaze arose higher
than usual, the low face of the opposite shore was struck by the
light. At such times I could not help reflecting what favorable
chances were afforded any foe who might be lurking opposite. I
involuntarily shrunk from the fire, and felt relieved when the
shore blended with the darkness.</p>

<p>It began to grow quite late, the fire had smoldered low, when
Nat, removing his cap, turned upon me with:</p>

<p>"What do you think of our journey to California?"</p>

<p>I was at a loss to comprehend his meaning, and looked at him
for an explanation.</p>

<p>"I mean to ask whether you feel in such a hurry to get to mines
as you did when we were in Independence?"</p>

<p>Now, to confess the truth, the experience of the last week or
two, and especially of the last two days, had done much toward
dampening the ardor which I once thought could never leave me;
and I believe, had I possessed moral courage enough, I should
have seized the first opportunity to return to the comforts of
a home, where I possessed enough to satisfy any sensible person’s
ambition. Still I hesitated to commit myself.</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I am; but what induced you to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I’m sick of this business," interrupted Nat, lengthening his
legs with a spiteful jerk, and looking disgustedly into the fire.</p>

<p>"What has come over you?" I asked, half-amused at his manner.</p>

<p>"Well there’s that mare&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But you promised not to think of her."</p>

<p>"How can I help it, I should like to know? She’s gone sure, and
there’s that overcoat, that cost me four dollars and a half in
Lubec; and Alminy made a big pocket in it on purpose for me to
fill full of gold chunks; and I should like to know how I am going
to do it, when a Greaser has got it."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that that would not be the only difficulty you would
be likely to experience, Nat, in getting it filled."</p>

<p>"And my jack-knife was in the coat-pocket, I declare!" exclaimed
he, suddenly starting up and pinching alternately one pocket and
then another. "Yes, sir, that’s gone, too; that’s worse than all
the rest," he added, despairingly, falling upon his elbow, and
gazing abstractedly into the fire.</p>

<p>"That’s a trifling loss, surely, as you have your hunting-knife."</p>

<p>"I’ve a good notion to get up and go back now," he added, not
heeding my remark. "I’m sick of this business. It’s bad enough
to lose the mare, but when the knife is gone I can’t stand it."</p>

<p>I knew this was but a momentary despondency with my friend, and
for the sake of whiling away the time before sleep, I was inclined
to humor it.</p>

<p>"But what will you do for that gold that you was going to buy
Deacon Hunt’s farm with for your Alminy?"</p>

<p>"Let her go without it," he answered, gruffly, without removing
his gaze from the fire. "She can get along without it. I believe
she only coaxed me to go off to Californy to get me out of the
way, so that mean Bill Hawkins might take my place. If he does
come any such game, he’ll catch it when I get back."</p>

<p>I laughed deeply, but silently, as I witnessed his appearance
at these remarks. It was so earnest and feeling, that it was impossible
to resist its ludicrousness.</p>

<p>"Nat," said I, after a moment’s thought, in which my mind had
taken an altogether different channel, "I am free to own that
I have little faith in our success in California. I left home
in a flush of excitement, without considering the consequences
of such a rash step, and they are now beginning to present themselves.
I propose that we seek our fortune elsewhere. The fact that gold
exists in California is now known all over the world, and we know
there is not the remotest corner of her territory which is not
swarming with hundreds who leave no means untried to amass their
fortunes. I have no desire to wrangle and grope with them, and
would much rather seek wealth elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But where else?"</p>

<p>"If gold exists in one spot on the Pacific coast, it is right
to suppose it exists in many others, and what is to prevent our
finding it?"</p>

<p>"Have you thought of any place?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that in Oregon, among the spurs of the Rocky
Mountains, there must be fabulous quantities of the precious metal."</p>

<p>"But why hasn’t it been found?"</p>

<p>"Oregon is thinly settled, and no suspicion has led them to search
for it."</p>

<p>"Well, let us dream upon it."</p>

<p>A few more fagots were forthwith heaped upon the fire, and then
we lay down for the night’s rest.</p>

<p>My companion had lain but a minute, when he suddenly sprang to
his feet, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Oregon!"</p>

<p>"Be careful," I admonished; "your indiscretion may be fatal.
That wall of darkness across the river looks gloomy and threatening
enough to me."</p>

<p>"It does&mdash;hello! I’m shot&mdash;no, I ain’t, neither."</p>

<p>That instant the report of a rifle burst from the other bank,
and the bullet whizzed within an inch of my companion’s face.</p>

<p>"Heavens! are we attacked!" I ejaculated, starting back from
the fire.</p>

<p>"I believe so," replied Nat, cowering behind me.</p>

<p>We listened silently and fearfully, but heard no more. The fire
smoldered to embers, the river grew darker, and the night, moonless
and cold, settled upon us. But no sleep visited my eyelids that
night. Till the gray dawn of morning I listened, but heard no
more.</p>
