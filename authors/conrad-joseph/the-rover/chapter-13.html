<p>The motive force of a fixed idea is very great. In the case of
Scevola it was great enough to launch him down the slope and to
rob him for the moment of all caution. He bounded amongst the
boulders, using the handle of the stable fork for a staff. He
paid no regard to the nature of the ground, till he got a fall
and found himself sprawling on his face, while the stable fork
went clattering down until it was stopped by a bush. It was this
circumstance which saved Peyrol’s prisoner from being caught unawares.
Since he had got out of the little cabin, simply because after
coming to himself he had perceived it was open, Symons had been
greatly refreshed by long drinks of cold water and by his little
nap in the fresh air. Every moment he was feeling in better command
of his limbs. As to the command of his thoughts, that was coming
to him too, rather quickly. The advantage of having a very thick
skull became evident in the fact that as soon as he had dragged
himself out of that cabin he knew where he was. The next thing
he did was to look at the moon, to judge of the passage of time.
Then he gave way to an immense surprise at the fact of being alone
aboard the tartane. As he sat with his legs dangling into the
open hold he tried to guess how it came about that the cabin had
been left unlocked and unguarded.</p>

<p>He went on thinking about this unexpected situation. What could
have become of that white-headed villain? Was he dodging about
somewhere watching for a chance to give him another tap on the
head? Symons felt suddenly very unsafe sitting there on the after-deck
in the full light of the moon. Instinct rather than reason suggested
to him that he ought to get down into the dark hold. It seemed
a great undertaking at first, but once he started he accomplished
it with the greatest ease, though he could not avoid knocking
down a small spar which was leaning up against the deck. It preceded
him into the hold with a loud crash which gave poor Symons an
attack of palpitation of the heart. He sat on the keelson of the
tartane and gasped, but after a while reflected that all this
did not matter. His head felt very big, his neck was very painful
and one shoulder was certainly very stiff. He could never stand
up against that old ruffian. But what had become of him? Why!
He had gone to fetch the soldiers! After that conclusion Symons
became more composed. He began to try to remember things. When
he had last seen that old fellow it was daylight, and now &mdash;Symons
looked up at the moon again&mdash;it must be near six bells in the
first watch. No doubt the old scoundrel was sitting in a wine
shop drinking with the soldiers. They would be here soon enough!
The idea of being a prisoner of war made his heart sink a little.
His ship appeared to him invested with an extraordinary number
of lovable features which included Captain Vincent and the first
lieutenant. He would have been glad to shake hands even with the
corporal, a surly and malicious marine acting as master-at-arms
of the ship. "I wonder where she is now," he thought dismally,
feeling his distaste for captivity grow with the increase of his
strength.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that he heard the noise of Scevola’s fall.
It was pretty close; but afterwards he heard no voices and footsteps
heralding the approach of a body of men. If this was the old ruffian
coming back, then he was coming back alone. At once Symons started
on all fours for the fore end of the tartane. He had an idea that
ensconced under the foredeck he would be in a better position
to parley with the enemy and that perhaps he could find there
a handspike or some piece of iron to defend himself with. Just
as he had settled himself in his hiding-place Scevola stepped
from the shore on to the after-deck.</p>

<p>At the very first glance Symons perceived that this one was very
unlike the man he expected to see. He felt rather disappointed.
As Scevola stood still in full moonlight Symons congratulated
himself on having taken up a position under the foredeck. That
fellow, who had a beard, was like a sparrow in body compared with
the other; but he was armed dangerously with something that looked
to Symons either like a trident or fishgrains on a staff. "A devil
of a weapon that," he thought, appalled. And what on earth did
that beggar want on board? What could he be after?</p>

<p>The new-comer acted strangely at first. He stood stock still,
craning his neck here and there, peering along the whole length
of the tartane, then crossing the deck he repeated all those performances
on the other side. "He has noticed that the cabin door is open.
He’s trying to see where I’ve got to. He will be coming forward
to look for me," said Symons to himself. "If he corners me here
with that beastly pronged affair I am done for." For a moment
he debated within himself whether it wouldn’t be better to make
a dash for it and scramble ashore; but in the end he mistrusted
his strength. "He would run me down for sure," he concluded. "And
he means no good, that’s certain. No man would go about at night
with a confounded thing like that if he didn’t mean to do for
somebody."</p>

<p>Scevola, after keeping perfectly still, straining his ears for
any sound from below where he supposed Lieutenant Réal to be,
stooped down to the cabin scuttle and called in a low voice: "Are
you there, lieutenant?" Symons saw these motions and could not
imagine their purport. That excellent able seaman of proved courage
in many cutting-out expeditions broke into a slight perspiration.
In the light of the moon the prongs of the fork, polished by much
use, shone like silver, and the whole aspect of the stranger was
weird and dangerous in the extreme. Who could that man be after,
but him, himself.</p>

<p>Scevola, receiving no answer, remained in a stooping position.
He could not detect the slightest sound of breathing down there.
He remained in this position so long that Symons became quite
interested. "He must think I am still down there," he whispered
to himself. The next proceeding was quite astonishing. The man,
taking up a position on one side of the cuddy scuttle and holding
his horrid weapon as one would a boarding pike, uttered a terrific
whoop and went on yelling in French with such volubility that
he quite frightened Symons. Suddenly he left off, moved away from
the scuttle and looked at a loss what to do next. Anybody who
could have then seen Symons’ protruded head with his face turned
aft would have seen on it an expression of horror. "The cunning
beast," he thought. "If I had been down there, with the row he
made, I would have surely rushed on deck and then he would have
had me." Symons experienced the feeling of a very narrow escape;
yet it brought not much relief. It was simply a matter of time.
The fellow’s homicidal purpose was evident. He was bound before
long to come forward. Symons saw him move, and thought, "Now he’s
coming," and prepared himself for a dash. "If I can dodge past
these blamed prongs I might be able to take him by the throat,"
he reflected, without, however, feeling much confidence in himself.</p>

<p>But to his great relief Scevola’s purpose was simply to conceal
the fork in the hold in such a manner that the handle of it just
reached the edge of the after-deck. In that position it was of
course invisible to anybody coming from the shore. Scevola had
made up his mind that the lieutenant was out of the tartane. He
had wandered away along the shore and would probably be back in
a moment. Meantime it had occurred to him to see if he could discover
anything compromising in the cabin. He did not take the fork down
with him because in that confined space it would have been useless
and rather a source of embarrassment than otherwise should the
returning lieutenant find him there. He cast a circular glance
around the basin and then prepared to go down.</p>

<p>Every movement of his was watched by Symons. He guessed Scevola’s
purpose by his movements, and said to himself: "Here’s my only
chance, and not a second to be lost either." Directly Scevola
turned his back on the forepart of the tartane in order to go
down the little cabin ladder, Symons crawled out from his concealment.
He ran along the hold on all fours for fear the other should turn
his head round before disappearing below, but directly he judged
that the man had touched bottom, he stood on his feet and catching
hold of the main rigging swung himself on the after-deck and,
as it were in the same movement, flung himself on the doors of
the cabin, which came together with a crash. How he could secure
them he had not thought, but as a matter of fact he saw the padlock
hanging on a staple on one side; the key was in it, and it was
a matter of a fraction of a second to secure the doors effectually.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the crash of the cabin door there
was a shrill exclamation of surprise down there, and just as Symons
had turned the key the man he had trapped made an effort to break
out. That, however, did not disturb Symons. He knew the strength
of that door. His first action was to get possession of the stable
fork. At once he felt himself a match for any single man, or even
two men, unless they had fire-arms. He had no hope, however, of
being able to resist the soldiers and really had no intention
of doing so. He expected to see them appear at any moment led
by that confounded marinero. As to what the farmer man had come
for on board the tartane he had not the slightest doubt about
it. Not being troubled by too much imagination, it seemed to him
obvious that it was to kill an Englishman and for nothing else.
"Well, I am jiggered," he exclaimed mentally. "The damned savage!
I haven’t done anything to him. They must be a murderous lot hereabouts."
He looked anxiously up the slope. He would have welcomed the arrival
of soldiers. He wanted more than ever to be made a proper prisoner,
but a profound stillness reigned on the shore and a most absolute
silence down below in the cabin. Absolute. No word, no movement.
The silence of the grave. "He’s scared to death," thought Symons,
hitting in his simplicity on the exact truth. "It would serve
him jolly well right if I went down there and ran him through
with that thing. I would do it for a shilling, too." He was getting
angry. It occurred to him also that there was some wine down there
too. He discovered he was very thirsty and he felt rather faint.
He sat down on the little skylight to think the matter over while
awaiting the soldiers. He even gave a friendly thought to Peyrol
himself. He was quite aware that he could have gone ashore and
hidden himself for a time, but that meant in the end being hunted
among the rocks and, certainly, captured; with the additional
risk of getting a musket ball through his body.</p>

<p>The first gun of the <em>Amelia</em> lifted him to his feet as
though he had been snatched up by the hair of his head. He intended
to give a resounding cheer, but produced only a feeble gurgle
in his throat. His ship was talking to him. They hadn’t given
him up. At the second report he scrambled ashore with the agility
of a cat&mdash;in fact, with so much agility that he had a fit of giddiness.
After it passed off he returned deliberately to the tartane to
get hold of the stable fork. Then, trembling with emotion, he
staggered off quietly and resolutely with the only purpose of
getting down to the seashore. He knew that as long as he kept
downhill he would be all right. The ground in this part being
a smooth rocky surface and Symons being barefooted, he passed
at no great distance from Peyrol without being heard. When he
got on rough ground he used the stable fork for a staff. Slowly
as he moved, he was not really strong enough to be sure-footed.
Ten minutes later or so Peyrol, lying ensconced behind a bush,
heard the noise of a rolling stone far away in the direction of
the cove. Instantly the patient Peyrol got on his feet and started
towards the cove himself. Perhaps he would have smiled if the
importance and gravity of the affair in which he was engaged had
not given all his thoughts a serious cast. Pursuing a higher path
than the one followed by Symons, he had presently the satisfaction
of seeing the fugitive, made very noticeable by the white bandages
about his head, engaged in the last part of the steep descent.
No nurse could have watched with more anxiety the adventure of
a little boy than Peyrol the progress of his former prisoner.
He was very glad to perceive that he had had the sense to take
what looked like the tartane’s boathook to help himself with.
As Symons’ figure sank lower and lower in his descent Peyrol moved
on, step by step, till at last he saw him from above sitting down
on the seashore, looking very forlorn and lonely, with his bandaged
head between his hands. Instantly Peyrol sat down too, protected
by a projecting rock. And it is safe to say that with that there
came a complete cessation of all sound and movement on the lonely
head of the peninsula for a full half-hour.</p>

<p>Peyrol was not in doubt as to what was going to happen. He was
as certain that the corvette’s boat or boats were now on the way
to the cove as though he had seen them leave the side of the <em>Amelia</em>.
But he began to get a little impatient. He wanted to see the end
of this episode. Most of the time he was watching Symons. "Sacré
tête dure," he thought. "He has gone to sleep." Indeed Symons’
immobility was so complete that he might have been dead from his
exertions: only Peyrol had a conviction that his once youthful
chum was not the sort of person that dies easily. The part of
the cove he had reached was all right for Peyrol’s purpose. But
it would have been quite easy for a boat or boats to fail to notice
Symons, and the consequence of that would be that the English
would probably land in several parties for a search, discover
the tartane.... Peyrol shuddered.</p>

<p>Suddenly he made out a boat just clear of the eastern point of
the cove. Mr. Bolt had been hugging the coast and progressing
very slowly, according to his instructions, till he had reached
the edge of the point’s shadow where it lay ragged and black on
the moonlit water. Peyrol could see the oars rise and fall. Then
another boat glided into view. Peyrol’s alarm for his tartane
grew intolerable. "Wake up, animal, wake up," he mumbled through
his teeth. Slowly they glided on, and the first cutter was on
the point of passing by the man on the shore when Peyrol was relieved
by the hail of "Boat ahoy!" reaching him faintly where he knelt
leaning forward, an absorbed spectator.</p>

<p>He saw the boat heading for Symons, who was standing up now and
making desperate signs with both arms. Then he saw him dragged
in over the bows, the boat back out, and then both of them tossed
oars and floated side by side on the sparkling water of the cove.</p>

<p>Peyrol got up from his knees. They had their man now. But perhaps
they would persist in landing, since there must have been some
other purpose at first in the mind of the captain of the English
corvette. This suspense did not last long. Peyrol saw the oars
fall in the water, and in a very few minutes the boats, pulling
round, disappeared one after another behind the eastern point
of the cove.</p>

<p>"That’s done," muttered Peyrol to himself. "I will never see
the silly Hard-head again." He had a strange notion that those
English boats had carried off something belonging to him, not
a man but a part of his own life, the sensation of a regained
touch with the far-off days in the Indian Ocean. He walked down
quickly as if to examine the spot from which Testa Dura had left
the soil of France. He was in a hurry now to get back to the farmhouse
and meet Lieutenant Réal, who would be due back from Toulon. The
way by the cove was as short as any other. When he got down he
surveyed the empty shore and wondered at a feeling of emptiness
within himself. While walking up towards the foot of the ravine
he saw an object lying on the ground. It was a stable fork. He
stood over it asking himself, "How on earth did this thing come
here?" as though he had been too surprised to pick it up. Even
after he had done so he remained motionless, meditating on it.
He connected it with some activity of Scevola, since he was the
man to whom it belonged, but that was no sort of explanation of
its presence on that spot, unless ...</p>

<p>"Could he have drowned himself?" thought Peyrol, looking at the
smooth and luminous water of the cove. It could give him no answer.
Then at arm’s length he contemplated his find. At last he shook
his head, shouldered the fork, and with slow steps continued on
his way.</p>
