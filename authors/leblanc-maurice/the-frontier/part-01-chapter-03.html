<p>Jorancé was a heavy and rather unwieldy, pleasant-faced man. Twenty-five
years before, when secretary to the commissary at Noirmont, he had
married a girl of entrancing beauty, who used to teach the piano in a
boarding-school. One evening, after four years of marriage, four years
of torture, during which the unhappy man suffered every sort of
humiliation, Jorancé came home to find the house empty. His wife had
gone without a word of explanation, taking their little girl, Suzanne,
with her.
</p><p>The only thing that kept him from suicide was the hope of recovering the
child and saving her from the life which her mother's example would have
forced upon her in the future.
</p><p>He did not have to look for her long. A month later, his wife sent back
the child, who was no doubt in her way. But the wound had cut deep and
lingered; and neither time nor the love which he bore his daughter could
wipe out the memory of that cruel story.
</p><p>He buckled to his work, accepted the most burdensome tasks so as to
increase his income and give Suzanne a good education, was transferred
to the commissary's office at Lunéville and, somewhat late in life, was
promoted to be special commissary at the frontier. The position involved
the delicate functions of a sentry on outpost duty whose business it is
to see as much as possible of what goes on in the neighbour's country;
and Jorancé filled it so conscientiously, tactfully and skilfully that
the neighbour aforesaid, while dreading his shrewdness and insight,
respected his character and his professional qualities.
</p><p>At Saint-Élophe, he renewed his intimacy with old Morestal, who was his
grand-uncle by marriage and who was very much attached to him.
</p><p>The two men saw each other almost every day. Jorancé and Suzanne used to
dine at the Old Mill on Thursdays and Sundays. Suzanne would also often
come alone and accompany the old man on his daily walk. He took a great
fancy to her; and it was upon his advice and at the urgent request of
Philippe and Marthe Morestal that Jorancé had taken Suzanne to Paris the
previous winter.

                                   *
                                  * *</pre>
<p>His first words on entering the room were to thank Philippe:
</p><p>"You can't think, my dear Philippe, how glad I was to leave her with
you. Suzanne is young. And I approve of a little distraction."
</p><p>He looked at Suzanne with the fervent glance of a father who has brought
up his daughter himself and whose love for her is mingled with a touch
of feminine affection.
</p><p>And he said to Philippe:
</p><p>"Have you heard the news? I am marrying her."
</p><p>"Really?" said Philippe.
</p><p>"Yes, to one of my cousins at Nancy, a man rather well-on in years,
perhaps, but a serious, active and intelligent fellow. Suzanne likes him
very much. You do like him very much, don't you, Suzanne?"
</p><p>The girl seemed not to hear the question and asked:
</p><p>"Is Marthe in her room, Philippe?"
</p><p>"Yes, on the second floor."
</p><p>"I know, the blue room. I was here yesterday, helping Mme. Morestal. I
must run up and give her a kiss."
</p><p>She turned round in the doorway and kissed her hand to the three men,
keeping her eyes fixed on Philippe.
</p><p>"How pretty and charming your daughter is!" said Morestal to Jorancé.
</p><p>But they could see that he was thinking of something else and that he
was eager to change the conversation. He shut the door quickly and,
returning to the special commissary, said:
</p><p>"Did you come by the frontier-road?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"And you haven't been told yet?"
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"The German post ... at the Butte-aux-Loups...."
</p><p>"Knocked down?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Oh, by Jove!"
</p><p>Morestal stopped to enjoy the effect which he had produced and then
continued:
</p><p>"What do you say to it?"
</p><p>"I say ... I say that it's most annoying.... They're in a very bad
temper as it is, on the other side. This means trouble for me."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Well, of course. Haven't you heard that they're beginning to accuse me
of encouraging the German deserters?"
</p><p>"Nonsense!"
</p><p>"I tell you, they are. It seems that there's a secret desertion-office
in these parts. I'm supposed to be at the head of it. And you, you are
the heart and soul of it."
</p><p>"Oh, they can't stand me at any price!"
</p><p>"Nor me either. Weisslicht, the German commissary at Börsweilen, has
sworn a mortal hatred against me. We cut each other now when we meet.
There's not a doubt but that he is responsible for the calumnies."
</p><p>"But what proofs do they put forward?"
</p><p>"Any number ... all equally bad.... Among others, this: pieces of French
gold which are said to have been found on their soldiers. So you see ...
with the post tumbling down once more, the explanations that are certain
to begin all over again, the enquiries that are certain to be
opened...."
</p><p>Philippe went up to him:
</p><p>"Come, come, I don't suppose it's so serious as all that."
</p><p>"You think not, my boy? Then you haven't seen the stop-press telegrams
in this morning's papers?"
</p><p>"No," said Philippe and his father. "What's the news?"
</p><p>"An incident in Asia Minor. A quarrel between the French and German
officials. One of the consuls has been killed."
</p><p>"Oh, oh!" said Morestal. "This time ..."
</p><p>And Jorancé went into details:
</p><p>"Yes, the position is exceedingly strained. The Morocco question has
been opened again. Then there's the espionage business and the story of
the French air-men flying over the fortresses in Alsace and dropping
tricolour flags in the Strasburg streets.... For six months, it has been
one long series of complications and shocks. The newspapers are becoming
aggressive in their language. Both countries are arming, strengthening
their defences. In short, in spite of the good intentions of the two
governments, we are at the mercy of an accident. A spark ... and the
thing's done."
</p><p>A heavy silence weighed upon the three men. Each of them conjured up the
sinister vision according to his own temperament and instincts.
</p><p>Jorancé repeated:
</p><p>"A spark ... and the thing's done."
</p><p>"Well, let it be done!" said Morestal, with an angry gesture.
</p><p>Philippe gave a start:
</p><p>"What are you saying, father?"
</p><p>"Well, what! There must be an end to all this."
</p><p>"But the end need not be in blood."
</p><p>"Nonsense ... nonsense.... There are injuries that can only be wiped out
in blood. And, when a great country like ours has received a slap in the
face like that of 1870, it can wait forty years, fifty years, but a day
comes when it returns the slap in the face ... and with both hands!"
</p><p>"And suppose we are beaten?" said Philippe.
</p><p>"Can't be helped! Honour comes first! Besides, we sha'n't be beaten.
Let every man do his duty and we shall see! In 1870, as a prisoner of
war, I gave my word not to serve in the French army again. I escaped, I
collected the young rapscallions of Saint-Élophe and round about, the
old men, the cripples, the women even.... We took to the woods. Three
rags served as a rallying-signal: a bit of white linen, a strip of red
flannel and a piece out of a blue apron ... the flag of the band! There
it hangs.... It shall see the light of day again, if necessary."
</p><p>Jorancé could not help laughing:
</p><p>"Do you think that will stop the Prussians?"
</p><p>"Don't laugh, my friend.... You know the view I take of my duty and what
I am doing. But it is just as well that Philippe should know, too. Sit
down, my boy."
</p><p>He himself sat down, put aside the pipe which he was smoking and began,
with the obvious satisfaction of a man who is at last able to speak of
what he has most at heart:
</p><p>"You know the frontier, Philippe, or rather the German side of the
frontier?... A craggy cliff, a series of peaks and ravines which make
this part of the Vosges an insuperable rampart...."
</p><p>"Yes, absolutely insuperable," said Philippe.
</p><p>"That's a mistake!" exclaimed Morestal. "A fatal mistake! From the
first moment when I began to think of these matters, I believed that a
day would come when the enemy would attack that rampart."
</p><p>"Impossible!"
</p><p>"That day has come, Philippe. For the last six months, not a week has
passed without my meeting some suspicious figure over there or knocking
up against men walking about in smocks that were hardly enough to
conceal their uniform.... It is a constant, progressive underhand work.
Everybody is helping in it. The electric factory which the Wildermann
firm has run up in that ridiculous fashion on the edge of the precipice
is only a make-believe. The road that leads to it is a military road.
From the factory to the Col du Diable is less than half a mile. One
effort and the frontier's crossed."
</p><p>"By a company," objected Jorancé.
</p><p>"Where a company passes, a regiment can pass and a brigade can
follow.... At Börsweilen, five miles from the Vosges, there are three
thousand German soldiers: on a war-footing, mark you. At Gernach, twelve
miles further, there are twelve thousand; and four thousand horses; and
eight hundred waggons. By the evening of the day on which war is
declared, perhaps even earlier, those fifteen thousand men will have
crossed the Col du Diable. It's not a surprise which they mean to
attempt: that wouldn't be worth their while. It is the absolute
crossing of the frontier, the taking possession of our ridges, the
occupation of Saint-Élophe. When our troops arrive, it will be too late!
They will find Noirmont cut off, Belfort threatened, the south of the
Vosges invaded.... You can picture the moral effect: we shall be done
for! That is what is being prepared in the dark. That is what you have
been unable to see, Jorancé, in spite of all your watchfulness ... and
in spite of my warnings."
</p><p>"I wrote to the prefect last week."
</p><p>"You should have written last year! All this time, the other has been
coming on, the other has been advancing.... He hardly takes the trouble
to conceal himself.... There ... listen to him ... listen to him...."
</p><p>In the far distance, like the sound of an echo, deadened by the mass of
trees, a bugle-call had rung out, somewhere, through the air. It was an
indistinct call, but Morestal was not mistaken and he hissed:
</p><p>"Ah, it's he!... It's he.... I know the voice of Germany.... I know it
when I hear it ... the hoarse, the odious voice!..."
</p><p>Presently, Philippe, who had not taken his eyes off his father, said:
</p><p>"And then, father?"
</p><p>"And then, my son, it was in anticipation of that day that I built my
house on this hill, that I surrounded my gardens with a wall, that,
unknown to anybody, I stocked the out-houses with means of defence:
ammunition, bags of sand, gun-powder ... that, in short, I prepared for
an alarm by setting up this unsuspected little fortress at twenty
minutes from the Col du Diable ... on the very threshold of the
frontier!"
</p><p>He had planted himself with his face to the east, with his face to the
enemy; and, clutching his hips with his clenched hands, in an attitude
of defiance, he seemed to be awaiting the inevitable assault.
</p><p>The special commissary, who still feared that his zeal had been caught
napping in this business, growled:
</p><p>"Your shanty won't hold out for an hour."
</p><p>"And who tells you," shouted Morestal, "who tells you that that hour is
not exactly the one hour which we shall want to gain?... An hour! You
never spoke a truer word: an hour of resistance to the first attack! An
hour of delay!... That's what I wanted, that's what I offer to my
country. Let every one be doing as I am, to the best of his power, let
every one be haunted to fever-point by the obsession of the personal
service which it is his duty to render to the country; and, if war
breaks out, you shall see how a great nation can take its revenge!"
</p><p>"And suppose we are beaten, in spite of all?" Philippe asked again.
</p><p>"What's that?"
</p><p>Old Morestal turned to his son as though he had received a blow; and a
rush of blood inflamed his features. He looked Philippe in the face:
</p><p>"What do you say?"
</p><p>Philippe had an inkling of the conflict that would hurl them one against
the other if he dared to state his objections more minutely. And he
uttered words at random:
</p><p>"Of course, the supposition is not one of those which we can
entertain.... But, all the same ... don't you think we ought to face the
possibility?..."
</p><p>"Face the possibility of defeat?" echoed the old man, who seemed
thunderstruck. "Are you suggesting that the fear of that ought to
influence France in her conduct?"
</p><p>A diversion relieved Philippe of his difficulty. Some one had appeared
from the staircase at the end of the terrace and in so noisy a fashion
that Morestal did not wait for his son to reply:
</p><p>"Is that you, Saboureux? What a row you're making!"
</p><p>It was Farmer Saboureux, whose house could be seen on the Col du Diable.
He was accompanied by an old, ragged tramp.
</p><p>Saboureux had come to complain. Some soldiers taking part in the
manoeuvres had helped themselves to two of his chickens and a duck. He
seemed beside himself, furious at the catastrophe:
</p><p>"Only, I've a witness in old Poussière here. And I want an indemnity,
not to speak of damages and punishment. I call it a calamity, I do:
soldiers of our own country!... I'm a good Frenchman, but, all the same
..."
</p><p>Morestal was too much absorbed in the discussion of his favourite ideas
to take the least interest in the man's troubles; and the farmer's
presence, on the contrary, seemed to him an excellent reason for
returning to the subject in hand. They had other things to talk about
than chickens and ducks! What about the chances of war? And the alarming
rumours that were current?
</p><p>"What do you say, Saboureux?"
</p><p>The farmer presented the typical appearance of those peasants whom we
sometimes find in the eastern provinces and who, with their stern,
clean-shaven faces, like the faces on ancient medals, remind us of our
Roman ancestors rather than of the Gauls or Francs. He had marched to
battle in 1870 with the others, perishing with hunger and wretchedness,
risking his skin. And, on his return, he had found his shanty reduced to
ashes. Some passing Uhlans.... Since that time, he had laboured hard to
repair the harm done.
</p><p>"And you want it all over again?" he said. "More Uhlans burning and
sacking?... Oh, no, I've had enough of that game! You just let me be as
I am!"
</p><p>He was filled with the small land-owner's hatred against all those,
Frenchmen or others, who were likely to tread with a sacrilegious foot
on the sown earth, where the harvest is so slow in coming. He crossed
his arms, with a serious air.
</p><p>"And you, Poussière, what would you say if we went to war?" asked
Morestal, calling to the old tramp, who was sitting on the parapet of
the terrace, breaking a crust.
</p><p>The man was lean and wizened, twisted like a vine-shoot, with long,
dust-coloured hair and a melancholy, impassive face that seemed carved
out of old oak. He put in an appearance at Saint-Élophe once every three
or four months. He knocked at the doors of the houses and then went off
again.
</p><p>"What country do you belong to, to begin with?"
</p><p>He grunted:
</p><p>"Don't know much about it ... it's so long ago...."
</p><p>"Which do you like best? France, eh? The roads on this side?"
</p><p>The old chap swung his legs without answering, perhaps without
understanding. Saboureux grinned:
</p><p>"He doesn't look at the roads, not he! He doesn't as much as know if he
belongs to the country on the right or on the left! His country lies
where the grub lies ... eh, Poussière?"
</p><p>Thereupon, seized with sudden ill-humour, Morestal lost his temper and
let fly at the lukewarm, at the indifferent--working-men, townsmen or
farmers--who think only of their comfort, without caring whether the
country is humiliated or victorious. But what else could one expect,
with the detestable ideas spread by some of the newspapers and carried
to the furthermost ends of the country in the books and pamphlets hawked
about by travelling agents?
</p><p>"Yes," he cried, "the new ideas: those are the evil that is destroying
us. The school-masters are poisoning the minds of the young. The very
army is smitten with the canker. Whole regiments are on the verge of
mutiny...."
</p><p>He turned a questioning glance upon Philippe, who, from time to time,
nodded his head without replying, with a movement which his father might
take for one of approval.
</p><p>"Isn't it so, Philippe? You see the thing close at hand, where you are:
all those poltroons who weaken our energies with their fine dreams of
peace at any price! You hear them, all the wind-bags at the public
meetings, who preach their loathsome crusade against the army and the
country with open doors and are backed up by our rulers.... And that's
only speaking of the capital!... Why, the very provinces haven't escaped
the contagion!... Here, have you read this abomination?"
</p><p>He took a little volume in a violet wrapper from among the papers heaped
up on his table and held it before his son's eyes. And he continued:
</p><p>"_Peace before All!_ No author's name. A book that's all the more
dangerous because it's very well written, not by one of those wind-bags
to whom I was referring just now, but by a scholar, a provincial and,
what's more, a Frenchman from the frontier. He seems even to bear our
name ... some distant cousin, no doubt: the Morestals are a large
family."
</p><p>"Are you sure?" blurted Philippe, who had turned pale at the sight of
the pamphlet. "How do you know?"
</p><p>"Oh, by accident.... A letter which was addressed to me and which said,
'All good wishes for the success of your pamphlet, my dear Morestal.'"
</p><p>Philippe remembered. He was to have gone to the Old Mill last year; and
the letter must have been sent to him by one of his friends.
</p><p>"And haven't you tried to find out?"
</p><p>"What for? Because I have a scoundrel in my family, that's no reason
why I should be in a hurry to make his acquaintance! Besides, he himself
has had the decency not to put his name to his scurrilous nonsense....
No matter: if ever I lay my hands on him!... But don't let's talk of
it...."
</p><p>He continued to talk of it, nevertheless, and at great length, as well
as of all the questions of war and peace, history and politics that came
to his mind. It was not until he had "got his budget off his chest," as
he said, that he exclaimed, suddenly:
</p><p>"Enough of this palavering, my friends! Why, it's four o'clock!
Saboureux, I'm your man.... So they've been making free with your
poultry, have they? Are you coming, Jorancé? We'll see some fine
soldier-chaps making their soup. There's nothing jollier and livelier
than a French camp!"
