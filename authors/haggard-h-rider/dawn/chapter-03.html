<p>Philip was not very fond of taking walks with his father, since he
found that in nine cases out of ten they afforded opportunities for
inculcation of facts of the driest description with reference to
estate management, or to the narration by his parent of little
histories of which his conduct upon some recent occasion would adorn
the moral. On this particular occasion the prospect was particularly
unpleasant, for his father would, he was well aware, overflow with
awful politeness, indeed, after the scene of the morning, it could not
be otherwise. Oh, how much rather would he have spent that lovely
afternoon with Maria Lee! Dear Maria, he would go and see her again
the very next day.
</p>
<p>When he arrived, some ten minutes after time in the antler-hung hall
of the Abbey House, he found his father standing, watch in hand,
exactly under the big clock, as though he was determined to make a
note by double entry of every passing second.
</p><p>"When I asked you to walk with me this afternoon, Philip, I, if my
memory does not deceive me, was careful to say that I had no wish to
interfere with any prior engagement. I was aware how little interest,
compared to your cousin George, you take in the estate, and I had no
wish to impose an uncongenial task. But, as you kindly volunteered to
accompany me, I regret that you did not find it convenient to be
punctual to the time you fixed. I have now waited for you for
seventeen minutes, and let me tell you that at my time of life I
cannot afford to lose seventeen minutes. May I ask what has delayed
you?"
</p><p>This long speech had given Philip the opportunity of recovering the
breath that he had lost in running home. He replied promptly--
</p><p>"I have been lunching with Miss Lee."
</p><p>"Oh, indeed, then I no longer wonder that you kept me waiting, and I
must say that in this particular I commend your taste. Miss Lee is a
young lady of good family, good manners, and good means. If her estate
went with this property it would complete as pretty a five thousand
acres of mixed soil as there is in the county. Those are beautiful old
meadows of hers, beautiful. Perhaps----" but here the old man checked
himself.
</p><p>On leaving the house they had passed together down a walk called the
tunnel walk, on account of the arching boughs of the lime-trees that
interlaced themselves overhead. At the end of this avenue, and on the
borders of the lake, there stood an enormous but still growing oak,
known as Caresfoot's Staff. It was the old squire's favourite tree,
and the best topped piece of timber for many miles round.
</p><p>"I wonder," said Philip, by way of making a little pleasant
conversation, "why that tree was called Caresfoot's Staff."
</p><p>"Your ignorance astonishes me, Philip, but I suppose that there are
some people who can live for years in a place and yet imbibe nothing
of its traditions. Perhaps you know that the monks were driven out of
these ruins by Henry VIII. Well, on the spot where that tree now
stands there grew a still greater oak, a giant tree, its trunk
measured sixteen loads of timber; which had, as tradition said, been
planted by the first prior of the Abbey when England was still Saxon.
The night the monks left a great gale raged over England. It was in
October, when the trees were full of leaf, and its fiercest gust tore
the great oak from its roothold, and flung it into the lake. Look! do
you see that rise in the sand, there, by the edge of the deep pool, in
the eight foot water? That is there it is supposed to lie. Well, the
whole country-side said that it was a sign that the monks had gone for
ever from Bratham Abbey, and the country-side was right. But when your
ancestor, old yeoman Caresfoot, bought this place and came to live
here, in a year when there was a great black frost that set the waters
of the lake like one of the new-fangled roads, he asked his
neighbours, ay, and his labouring folk, to come and dine with him and
drink to the success of his purchase. It was a proud day for him, and
when dinner was done and they were all mellow with strong ale, he bade
them step down to the borders of the lake, as he would have them be
witness to a ceremony. When they reached the spot they saw a curious
sight, for there on a strong dray, and dragged by Farmer Caresfoot's
six best horses, was an oak of fifty years' growth coming across the
ice, earth, roots and all.
</p><p>"On that spot where it now stands there had been a great hole, ten
feet deep by fourteen feet square, dug to receive it, and into that
hole Caresfoot Staff was tilted and levered off the dray. And when it
had been planted, and the frozen earth well trodden in, your
grandfather in the ninth degree brought his guests back to the old
banqueting-hall, and made a speech which, as it was the first and last
he ever made, was long remembered in the country-side. It was, put
into modern English, something like this:
</p><p>"'Neighbours,--Prior's Oak has gone into the water, and folks said
that it was for a sign that the monks would never come back to
Bratham, and that it was the Lord's wind that put it there. And,
neighbours, as ye know, the broad Bratham lands and the fat marshes
down by the brook passed by king's grant to a man that knew not clay
from loam, or layer from pasturage, and from him they passed by the
Lord's will to me, as I have asked you here to-day to celebrate. And
now, neighbours, I have a mind, and though it seem to you but a
childish thing, yet I have a mind, and have set myself to fulfil it.
When I was yet a little lad, and drove the swine out to feed on the
hill yonder, when the acorns had fallen, afore Farmer Gyrton's father
had gracious leave from the feoffees to put up the fence that doth now
so sorely vex us, I found one day a great acorn, as big as a dow's
egg, and of a rich and wondrous brown, and this acorn I bore home and
planted in kind earth in the corner of my dad's garden, thinking that
it would grow, and that one day I would hew its growth and use it for
a staff. Now that was fifty long years ago, lads, and there where grew
Prior's Oak, there, neighbours, I have set my Staff to-day. The monks
have told us how in Israel every man planted his fig and his vine. For
the fig I know not rightly what that is; but for the vine, I will
plant no creeping, clinging vine, but a hearty English oak, that, if
they do but give it good room to breathe in, and save their heirloom
from the axe, shall cast shade and grow acorns, and burst into leaf in
the spring and grow naked in the winter, when ten generations of our
children, and our children's children, shall have mixed their dust
with ours yonder in the graveyard. And now, neighbours, I have talked
too long, though I am better at doing than talking; but ye will even
forgive me, for I will not talk to you again, though on this the great
day of my life I was minded to speak. But I will bid you every man
pledge a health to the Caresfoot's Staff, and ask a prayer that, so
long as it shall push its leaves, so long may the race of my loins be
here to sit beneath its shade, and even mayhap when the corn is ripe
and the moon is up, and their hearts grow soft towards the past, to
talk with kinsman or with sweetheart of the old man who struck it in
this kindly soil.'"
</p><p>The old squire's face grew tender as he told this legend of the
forgotten dead, and Philip's young imagination summoned up the strange
old-world scene of the crowd of rustics gathered in the snow and frost
round this very tree.
</p><p>"Philip," said his father, suddenly, "you will hold the yeoman's Staff
one day; be like it of an oaken English heart, and you will defy wind
and weather as it has done, and as your forbears have done. Come, we
must go on."
</p><p>"By the way, Philip," he continued, after a while, "you will remember
what I said to you this morning--I hope that you will remember it,
though I spoke in anger--never try to deceive me again, or you will
regret it. And now I have something to say to you. I wish you to go to
college and receive an education that will fit you to hold the
position you must in the course of Nature one day fill in the county.
The Oxford term begins in a few days, and you have for some years been
entered at Magdalen College. I do not expect you to be a scholar, but
I do expect you to brush off your rough ways and your local ideas, and
to learn to become such a person both in your conduct and your mind as
a gentleman of your station should be."
</p><p>"Is George to go to college too?"
</p><p>"No; I have spoken to him on the subject, and he does not wish it. He
says very wisely that, with his small prospects, he would rather spend
the time in learning how to earn his living. So he is going to be
articled to the Roxham lawyers, Foster and Son, or rather Foster and
Bellamy, for young Bellamy, who is a lawyer by profession, came here
this morning, not to speak about you, but on a message from the firm
to say that he is now a junior partner, and that they will be very
happy to take George as an articled clerk. He is a hard-working,
shrewd young man, and it will be a great advantage to George to have
his advice and example before him."
</p><p>Philip assented, and went on in silence, reflecting on the curious
change in his immediate prospects that this walk had brought to light.
He was much rejoiced at the prospect of losing sight of George for a
while, and was sufficiently intelligent to appreciate the advantages,
social and mental, that the University would offer him; but it struck
him that there were two things which he did not like about the scheme.
The first of these was, that whilst he was pursuing his academical
studies, George would practically be left on the spot--for Roxham was
only six miles off--to put in motion any schemes he might have
devised; and Philip was sure that he had devised schemes. And the
second, that Oxford was a long way from Maria Lee. However, he kept
his objections to himself. In due course they reached the buildings
they had set out to examine, and the old squire, having settled what
was to be done, and what was to be left undone, with characteristic
promptitude and shrewdness, they turned homewards.
</p><p>In passing through the shrubberies, on their way back to the house,
they suddenly came upon a stolid-looking lad of about fifteen,
emerging from a side-walk with a nest full of young blackbirds in his
hand. Now, if there was one thing in this world more calculated than
another to rouse the most objectionable traits of the old squire's
character into rapid action, it was the discovery of boys, and more
especially bird-nesting boys, in his plantations. In the first place,
he hated trespassers; and in the second, it was one of his simple
pleasures to walk in the early morning and listen to the singing of
the birds that swarmed around. Accordingly, at the obnoxious sight he
stopped suddenly, and, drawing himself up to his full height,
addressed the trembling youth in his sweetest voice.
</p><p>"Your name is, I believe--Brady--Jim Brady--correct me if I am wrong--
and you have come here, you--you--young--villain--to steal my birds."
</p><p>The frightened boy walked slowly backwards, followed by the old man
with his fiery eyes fixed upon his face, till at last concussion
against the trunk of a great tree prevented further retreat. Here he
stood for about thirty seconds, writhing under the glance that seemed
to pierce him through and through, till at last he could stand it no
longer, but flung himself on the ground, roaring:
</p><p>"Oh! don't ee, squire; don't ee now look at me with that 'ere eye.
Take and thrash me, squire, but don't ee fix me so! I hayn't had no
more nor twenty this year, and a nest of spinxes, and Tom Smith he's
had fifty-two and a young owl. Oh! oh!"
</p><p>Enraged beyond measure at this last piece of information, Mr.
Caresfoot took his victim at his word, and, ceasing his ocular
experiments, laid into the less honourable portion of his form with
the gold-headed malacca cane in a way that astonished the prostrate
Jim, though he was afterwards heard to declare that the squire's cane
"warn't not nothing compared with the squire's eye, which wore a hot
coal, it wore, and frizzled your innards as sich."
</p><p>When Jim Brady had departed, never to return again, and the old man
had recovered his usual suavity of manner, he remarked to his son:
</p><p>"There is some curious property in the human eye; a property that is,
I believe, very much developed in my own. Did you observe the effect
of my glance upon that boy? I was trying an experiment on him. I
remember it was always the same with your poor mother. She could never
bear me to look at her."
</p><p>Philip made no reply, but he thought that, if she had been the object
of experiments of that nature, it was not very wonderful.
</p><p>Shortly after their return home he received a note from Miss Lee. It
ran thus:
</p>
<p> "My dear Philip,
</p><p> "What <u>do</u> you think? Just after you had gone away, I got by the
  mid-day post, which Jones (the butcher) brought from Roxham,
  several letters, amongst them one from Grumps and one from Uncle
  Tom. Grumps has shown a cause. Why? 'It' said she was not an
  improper person; but, for all that, she is so angry with Uncle Tom
  that she will not come back, but has accepted an offer to go to
  Canada as companion to a lady; so farewell Grumps.
</p><p> "Now for Uncle Tom. 'It' suggested that I should live with some
  of my relations till I came of age, and pay them four hundred a
  year, which I think a good deal. I am sure it can't cost four
  hundred a year to feed me, though I have such an appetite. I had
  no idea they were all so fond of me before; they all want me to
  come and live with them, except Aunt Chambers, who, you know,
  lives in Jersey. Uncle Tom says in his letter that he shall be
  glad if his daughters can have the advantage of my example, and of
  studying my polished manners (just fancy <u>my</u> polished manners;
  and I know, because little Tom, who is a brick, told me, that only
  last year he heard his father tell Emily--that's the eldest--that
  I was a dowdy, snub-nosed, ill-mannered miss, but that she must
  keep in with me and flatter me up). No, I will not live with Uncle
  Tom, and I will tell 'it' so. If I must leave my home, I will go
  to Aunt Chambers at Jersey. Jersey is a beautiful place for
  flowers, and one learns French there without the trouble of
  learning it; and I like Aunt Chambers, and she has no children,
  and nothing but the memory of a dear departed. But I don't like
  leaving home, and feel very much inclined to cry. <u>Hang</u> the Court
  of Chancery, and Uncle Tom and his interference too!--<u>there</u>. I
  suppose you can't find time to come over to-morrow morning to see
  me off? Good-bye, dear Philip,
</p><pre>
                                     "Your affectionate friend,
                                                     "Maria Lee."</pre>

<p>Philip did manage to find time next morning, and came back looking
very disconsolate.
