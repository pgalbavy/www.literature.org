<p>Never had Unc' Billy Possum played that old trick of his better
than he was playing it now. Farmer Brown's boy knew that Unc'
Billy was only pretending to be dead, yet so well did Unc' Billy
pretend that it was hard work for Farmer Brown's boy to believe
what he knew was the truth&mdash;that Unc' Billy was very much alive
and only waiting for a chance to slip away.</p>

<p>They were half-way from the henyard to the house when Bowser
the Hound came to meet his master. "Now we shall see what we shall
see," said Farmer Brown's boy, as Bowser came trotting up. "If
Unc' Billy can stand this test, I'll take off my hat to him every
time we meet hereafter." He held Unc' Billy out to Bowser, and
Bowser sniffed him all over.</p>

<p>Just imagine that! Just think of being nosed and sniffed at by
one of whom you were terribly afraid and not so much as twitching
an ear! Farmer Brown's boy dropped Unc' Billy on the ground, and
Bowser rolled him over and sniffed at him and then looked up at
his master, as much as to say: "This fellow doesn't interest me.
He's dead. He must be the fellow I saw go under the henhouse last
night. How did you kill him?"</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy laughed and picked Unc' Billy up by the tail
again. "He's fooled you all right, old fellow, and you don't know
it," said he to Bowser, as the latter pranced on ahead to the
house. The mother of Farmer Brown's boy was in the doorway, watching
them approach.</p>

<p>"What have you got there?" she demanded. "I declare if it isn't
a Possum! Where did you kill him? Was he the cause of all that
racket among the chickens?"</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy took Unc' Billy into the kitchen and dropped
him on a chair. Mrs. Brown came over to look at him closer. "Poor
little fellow," said she. "Poor little fellow. It was too bad
he got into mischief and had to be killed. I don't suppose he
knew any better. Somehow it always seems wrong to me to kill these
little creatures just because they get into mischief when all
the time they don't know that they are in mischief." She stroked
Unc' Billy gently.</p>

<p>The eyes of Farmer Brown's boy twinkled. He went over to a corner
and pulled a straw from his mother's broom. Then he returned to
Unc' Billy and began to tickle Unc' Billy's nose. Mrs. Brown looked
puzzled. She was puzzled.</p>

<p>"What are you doing that for?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Just for fun," replied Farmer Brown's boy and kept on tickling
Unc' Billy's nose. Now Unc' Billy could stand having his tail
pinched, and being carried head down, and being dropped on the
ground, but this was too much for him; he wanted to sneeze. He
had <em>got</em> to sneeze. He did sneeze. He couldn't help it,
though it were to cost him his life.</p>

<p>"Land of love!" exclaimed Mrs. Brown, jumping back and clutching
her skirts in both hands as if she expected Unc' Billy would try
to take refuge behind them. "Do you mean to say that that Possum
is alive?"</p>

<p>"Seems that way," replied Farmer Brown's boy as Unc' Billy sneezed
again, for that straw was still tickling his nose. "I should certainly
say it seems that way. The old sinner is no more dead than I am.
He's just pretending. He fooled you all right, Mother, but he
didn't fool me. I haven't hurt a hair of him. You ought to know
me well enough by this time to know that I wouldn't hurt him."</p>

<p>He looked at his mother reproachfully, and she hastened to apologize.
"But what could I think?" she demanded. "If he isn't a dead-looking
creature, I never have seen one. What are you going to do with
him, son?"</p>

<p>"Take him over to the Green Forest after breakfast and let him
go," replied Farmer Brown's boy.</p>

<p>This is just what he did do, and Unc' Billy wasted no time in
getting home. It was a long time before he met Jimmy Skunk again.
When he did, Jimmy was his usual good-natured self, and Unc' Billy
was wise enough not to refer to eggs.</p>
