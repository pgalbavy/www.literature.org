1. THE SCIENTIFIC ATHEIST
<P>
<P>
It is a curious thing that while most organised religions seem to 
drape about and conceal and smother the statement of the true God, 
the honest Atheist, with his passionate impulse to strip the truth 
bare, is constantly and unwittingly reproducing the divine likeness.  
It will be interesting here to call a witness or so to the extreme 
instability of absolute negation.
<P>
Here, for example, is a deliverance from Professor Metchnikoff, who 
was a very typical antagonist of all religion.  He died only the 
other day.  He was a very great physiologist indeed; he was a man 
almost of the rank and quality of Pasteur or Charles Darwin.  A 
decade or more ago he wrote a book called "The Nature of Man," in 
which he set out very plainly a number of illuminating facts about 
life.  They are facts so illuminating that presently, in our 
discussion of sin, they will be referred to again.  But it is not 
Professor Metchnikoff's intention to provide material for a 
religious discussion.  He sets out his facts in order to overthrow 
theology as he conceives it.  The remarkable thing about his book, 
the thing upon which I would now lay stress, is that he betrays no 
inkling of the fact that he has no longer the right to conceive 
theology as he conceives it.  The development of his science has 
destroyed that right.
<P>
He does not realise how profoundly modern biology has affected our 
ideas of individuality and species, and how the import of theology 
is modified through these changes.  When he comes from his own world 
of modern biology to religion and philosophy he goes back in time.  
He attacks religion as he understood it when first he fell out with 
it fifty years or more ago.
<P>
Let us state as compactly as possible the nature of these changes 
that biological science has wrought almost imperceptibly in the 
general scheme and method of our thinking.
<P>
The influence of biology upon thought in general consists 
essentially in diminishing the importance of the individual and 
developing the realisation of the species, as if it were a kind of 
super-individual, a modifying and immortal super-individual, 
maintaining itself against the outer universe by the birth and death 
of its constituent individuals.  Natural History, which began by 
putting individuals into species as if the latter were mere 
classificatory divisions, has come to see that the species has its 
adventures, its history and drama, far exceeding in interest and 
importance the individual adventure.  "The Origin of Species" was 
for countless minds the discovery of a new romance in life.
<P>
The contrast of the individual life and this specific life may be 
stated plainly and compactly as follows.  A little while ago we 
current individuals, we who are alive now, were each of us 
distributed between two parents, then between four grandparents, and 
so on backward, we are temporarily assembled, as it were, out of an 
ancestral diffusion; we stand our trial, and presently our 
individuality is dispersed and mixed again with other 
individualities in an uncertain multitude of descendants.  But the 
species is not like this; it goes on steadily from newness to 
newness, remaining still a unity.  The drama of the individual life 
is a mere episode, beneficial or abandoned, in this continuing 
adventure of the species.  And Metchnikoff finds most of the trouble 
of life and the distresses of life in the fact that the species is 
still very painfully adjusting itself to the fluctuating conditions 
under which it lives.  The conflict of life is a continual pursuit 
of adjustment, and the "ills of life," of the individual life that 
is, are due to its "disharmonies."  Man, acutely aware of himself as 
an individual adventure and unawakened to himself as a species, 
finds life jangling and distressful, finds death frustration.  He 
fails and falls as a person in what may be the success and triumph 
of his kind.  He does not apprehend the struggle or the nature of 
victory, but only his own gravitation to death and personal 
extinction.
<P>
Now Professor Metchnikoff is anti-religious, and he is anti-
religious because to him as to so many Europeans religion is 
confused with priest-craft and dogmas, is associated with 
disagreeable early impressions of irrational repression and 
misguidance.  How completely he misconceives the quality of 
religion, how completely he sees it as an individual's affair, his 
own words may witness:
<P>
<P>
"Religion is still occupied with the problem of death.  The 
solutions which as yet it has offered cannot be regarded as 
satisfactory.  A future life has no single argument to support it, 
and the non-existence of life after death is in consonance with the 
whole range of human knowledge.  On the other hand, resignation as 
preached by Buddha will fail to satisfy humanity, which has a 
longing for life, and is overcome by the thought of the 
inevitability of death."
<P>
<P>
Now here it is clear that by death he means the individual death, 
and by a future life the prolongation of individuality.  But 
Buddhism does not in truth appear ever to have been concerned with 
that, and modern religious developments are certainly not under that 
preoccupation with the narrower self.  Buddhism indeed so far from 
"preaching resignation" to death, seeks as its greater good a death 
so complete as to be absolute release from the individual's burthen 
of KARMA.  Buddhism seeks an ESCAPE FROM INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY.  
The deeper one pursues religious thought the more nearly it 
approximates to a search for escape from the self-centred life and 
over-individuation, and the more it diverges from Professor 
Metchnikoff's assertion of its aims.  Salvation is indeed to lose 
one's self.  But Professor Metchnikoff having roundly denied that 
this is so, is then left free to take the very essentials of the 
religious life as they are here conceived and present them as if 
they were the antithesis of the religious life.  His book, when it 
is analysed, resolves itself into just that research for an escape 
from the painful accidents and chagrins of individuation, which is 
the ultimate of religion.
<P>
At times, indeed, he seems almost wilfully blind to the true 
solution round and about which his writing goes.  He suggests as his 
most hopeful satisfaction for the cravings of the human heart, such 
a scientific prolongation of life that the instinct for self-
preservation will be at last extinct.  If that is not the very 
"resignation" he imputes to the Buddhist I do not know what it is.  
He believes that an individual which has lived fully and completely 
may at last welcome death with the same instinctive readiness as, in 
the days of its strength, it shows for the embraces of its mate.  We 
are to be glutted by living to six score and ten.  We are to rise 
from the table at last as gladly as we sat down.  We shall go to 
death as unresistingly as tired children go to bed.  Men are to have 
a life far beyond the range of what is now considered their prime, 
and their last period (won by scientific self-control) will be a 
period of ripe wisdom (from seventy to eighty to a hundred and 
twenty or thereabouts) and public service!
<P>
(But why, one asks, public service?  Why not book-collecting or the 
simple pleasure of reminiscence so dear to aged egotists?  
Metchnikoff never faces that question.  And again, what of the man 
who is challenged to die for right at the age of thirty?  What does 
the prolongation of life do for him?  And where are the consolations 
for accidental misfortune, for the tormenting disease or the lost 
limb?)
<P>
But in his peroration Professor Metchnikoff lapses into pure 
religiosity.  The prolongation of life gives place to sheer self-
sacrifice as the fundamental "remedy."  And indeed what other remedy 
has ever been conceived for the general evil of life?
<P>
<P>
"On the other hand," he writes, "the knowledge that the goal of 
human life can be attained only by the development of a high degree 
of solidarity amongst men will restrain actual egotism.  The mere 
fact that the enjoyment of life according to the precepts of Solomon 
(Ecelesiastes ix. 7-10)* is opposed to the goal of human life, will 
lessen luxury and the evil that comes from luxury.  Conviction that 
science alone is able to redress the disharmonies of the human 
constitution will lead directly to the improvement of education and 
to the solidarity of mankind.
<P>
* Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a 
merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.  Let thy garments be 
always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.  Live joyfully with 
the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, 
which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity 
for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou 
takest under the sun.  whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with 
thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor 
wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
<P>
"In progress towards the goal, nature will have to be consulted 
continuously.  Already, in the case of the ephemerids, nature has 
produced a complete cycle of normal life ending in natural death.  
In the problem of his own fate, man must not be content with the 
gifts of nature; he must direct them by his own efforts.  Just as he 
has been able to modify the nature of animals and plants, man must 
attempt to modify his own constitution, so as to readjust its 
disharmonies. . . .
<P>
"To modify the human constitution, it will be necessary first, to 
frame the ideal, and thereafter to set to work with all the 
resources of science.
<P>
"If there can be formed an ideal able to unite men in a kind of 
religion of the future, this ideal must be founded on scientific 
principles.  And if it be true, as has been asserted so often, that 
man can live by faith alone, the faith must be in the power of 
science."
<P>
<P>
Now this, after all the flat repudiations that have preceded it of 
"religion" and "philosophy" as remedies for human ills, is nothing 
less than the fundamental proposition of the religious life 
translated into terms of materialistic science, the proposition that 
damnation is really over-individuation and that salvahon is escape 
from self into the larger being of life. . . .
<P>
What can this "religion of the future" be but that devotion to the 
racial adventure under the captaincy of God which we have already 
found, like gold in the bottom of the vessel, when we have washed 
away the confusions and impurities of dogmatic religion?  By an 
inquiry setting out from a purely religious starting-point we have 
already reached conclusions identical with this ultimate refuge of 
an extreme materialist.
<P>
This altar to the Future of his, we can claim as an altar to our 
God--an altar rather indistinctly inscribed.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. SACRIFICE IMPLIES GOD
<P>
<P>
Almost all Agnostic and Atheistical writings that show any fineness 
and generosity of spirit, have this tendency to become as it were 
the statement of an anonymous God.  Everything is said that a 
religious writer would say--except that God is not named.  Religious 
metaphors abound.  It is as if they accepted the living body of 
religion but denied the bones that held it together--as they might 
deny the bones of a friend.  It is true, they would admit, the body 
moves in a way that implies bones in its every movement, but --WE 
HAVE NEVER SEEN THOSE BONES.
<P>
The disputes in theory--I do not say the difference in reality--
between the modern believer and the atheist or agnostic--becomes at 
times almost as impalpable as that subtle discussion dear to 
students of physics, whether the scientific "ether" is real or a 
formula.  Every material phenomenon is consonant with and helps to 
define this ether, which permeates and sustains and is all things, 
which nevertheless is perceptible to no sense, which is reached only 
by an intellectual process.  Most minds are disposed to treat this 
ether as a reality.  But the acutely critical mind insists that what 
is only so attainable by inference is not real; it is no more than 
"a formula that satisfies all phenomena."
<P>
But if it comes to that, am I anything more than the formula that 
satisfies all my forms of consciousness?
<P>
Intellectually there is hardly anything more than a certain will to 
believe, to divide the religious man who knows God to be utterly 
real, from the man who says that God is merely a formula to satisfy 
moral and spiritual phenomena.  The former has encountered him, the 
other has as yet felt only unassigned impulses.  One says God's will 
is so; the other that Right is so.  One says God moves me to do this 
or that; the other the Good Will in me which I share with you and 
all well-disposed men, moves me to do this or that.  But the former 
makes an exterior reference and escapes a risk of self-
righteousness.
<P>
I have recently been reading a book by Mr. Joseph McCabe called "The 
Tyranny of Shams," in which he displays very typically this curious 
tendency to a sort of religion with God "blacked out."  His is an 
extremely interesting case.  He is a writer who was formerly a Roman 
Catholic priest, and in his reaction from Catholicism he displays a 
resolution even sterner than Professor Metchnikoff's, to deny that 
anything religious or divine can exist, that there can be any aim in 
life except happiness, or any guide but "science."  But--and here 
immediately he turns east again--he is careful not to say 
"individual happiness."  And he says "Pleasure is, as Epicureans 
insisted, only a part of a large ideal of happiness."  So he lets 
the happiness of devotion and sacrifice creep in.  So he opens 
indefinite possibilities of getting away from any merely 
materialistic rule of life.  And he writes:
<P>
<P>
"In every civilised nation the mass of the people are inert and 
indifferent.  Some even make a pretence of justifying their 
inertness.  Why, they ask, should we stir at all?  Is there such a 
thing as a duty to improve the earth?  What is the meaning or 
purpose of life?  Or has it a purpose?
<P>
"One generally finds that this kind of reasoning is merely a piece 
of controversial athletics or a thin excuse for idleness.  People 
tell you that the conflict of science and religion--it would be 
better to say, the conflict of modern culture and ancient 
traditions--has robbed life of its plain significance.  The men who, 
like Tolstoi, seriously urge this point fail to appreciate the 
modern outlook on life.  Certainly modern culture--science, history, 
philosophy, and art--finds no purpose in life: that is to say, no 
purpose eternally fixed and to be discovered by man.  A great 
chemist said a few years ago that he could imagine 'a series of 
lucky accidents'--the chance blowing by the wind of certain 
chemicals into pools on the primitive earth--accounting for the 
first appearance of life; and one might not unjustly sum up the 
influences which have lifted those early germs to the level of 
conscious beings as a similar series of lucky accidents.
<P>
"But it is sheer affectation to say that this demoralises us.  If 
there is no purpose impressed on the universe, or prefixed to the 
development of humanity, it follows only that humanity may choose 
its own purpose and set up its own goal; and the most elementary 
sense of order will teach us that this choice must be social, not 
merely individual.  In whatever measure ill-controlled individuals 
may yield to personal impulses or attractions, the aim of the race 
must be a collective aim.  I do not mean an austere demand of self-
sacrifice from the individual, but an adjustment--as genial and 
generous as possible--of individual variations for common good.  
Otherwise life becomes discordant and futile, and the pain and waste 
react on each individual.  So we raise again, in the twentieth 
century, the old question of 'the greatest good,' which men 
discussed in the Stoa Poikile and the suburban groves of Athens, in 
the cool atria of patrician mansions on the Palatine and the 
Pincian, in the Museum at Alexandria, and the schools which Omar 
Khayyam frequented, in the straw-strewn schools of the Middle Ages 
and the opulent chambers of Cosimo dei Medici."
<P>
<P>
And again:
<P>
<P>
"The old dream of a co-operative effort to improve life, to bring 
happiness to as many minds of mortals as we can reach, shines above 
all the mists of the day.  Through the ruins of creeds and 
philosophies, which have for ages disdained it, we are retracing our 
steps toward that height--just as the Athenians did two thousand 
years ago.  It rests on no metaphysic, no sacred legend, no 
disputable tradition--nothing that scepticism can corrode or 
advancing knowledge undermine.  Its foundations are the fundamental 
and unchanging impulses of our nature."
<P>
<P>
And again:
<P>
<P>
"The revolt which burns in so much of the abler literature of our 
time is an unselfish revolt, or non-selfish revolt: it is an outcome 
of that larger spirit which conceives the self to be a part of the 
general social organism, and it is therefore neither egoistic nor 
altruistic.  It finds a sanction in the new intelligence, and an 
inspiration in the finer sentiments of our generation, but the glow 
which chiefly illumines it is the glow of the great vision of a 
happier earth.  It speaks of the claims of truth and justice, and 
assails untruth and injustice, for these are elemental principles of 
social life; but it appeals more confidently to the warmer sympathy 
which is linking the scattered children of the race, and it urges 
all to co-operate in the restriction of suffering and the creation 
of happiness.  The advance guard of the race, the men and women in 
whom mental alertness is associated with fine feeling, cry that they 
have reached Pisgah's slope and in increasing numbers men and women 
are pressing on to see if it be really the Promised Land."
<P>
<P>
"Pisgah--the Promised Land!"  Mr.  McCabe in that passage sounds as 
if he were half-way to "Oh! Beulah Land!" and the tambourine.
<P>
That "larger spirit," we maintain, is God; those "impulses" are the 
power of God, and Mr. McCabe serves a Master he denies.  He has but 
to realise fully that God is not necessarily the Triune God of the 
Catholic Church, and banish his intense suspicion that he may yet be 
lured back to that altar he abandoned, he has but to look up from 
that preoccupation, and immediately he will begin to realise the 
presence of Divinity.
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. GOD IS AN EXTERNAL REALITY
<P>
<P>
It may be argued that if atheists and agnostics when they set 
themselves to express the good will that is in them, do shape out 
God, that if their conception of right living falls in so completely 
with the conception of God's service as to be broadly identical, 
then indeed God, like the ether of scientific speculation, is no 
more than a theory, no more than an imaginative externalisation of 
man's inherent good will.  Why trouble about God then?  Is not the 
declaration of a good disposition a sufficient evidence of 
salvation?  What is the difference between such benevolent 
unbelievers as Professor Metchnikoff or Mr. McCabe and those who 
have found God?
<P>
The difference is this, that the benevolent atheist stands alone 
upon his own good will, without a reference, without a standard, 
trusting to his own impulse to goodness, relying upon his own moral 
strength.  A certain immodesty, a certain self-righteousness, hangs 
like a precipice above him; incalculable temptations open like gulfs 
beneath his feet.  He has not really given himself or got away from 
himself.  He has no one to whom he can give himself.  He is still a 
masterless man.  His exaltation is self-centred, is priggishness, 
his fall is unrestrained by any exterior obligation.  His devotion 
is only the good will in himself, a disposition; it is a mood that 
may change.  At any moment it may change.  He may have pledged 
himself to his own pride and honour, but who will hold him to his 
bargain?  He has no source of strength beyond his own amiable 
sentiments, his conscience speaks with an unsupported voice, and no 
one watches while he sleeps.  He cannot pray; he can but ejaculate.  
He has no real and living link with other men of good will.
<P>
And those whose acquiescence in the idea of God is merely 
intellectual are in no better case than those who deny God 
altogether.  They may have all the forms of truth and not divinity.  
The religion of the atheist with a God-shaped blank at its heart and 
the persuasion of the unconverted theologian, are both like lamps 
unlit.  The lit lamp has no difference in form from the lamp unlit.  
But the lit lamp is alive and the lamp unlit is asleep or dead.
<P>
The difference between the unconverted and the unbeliever and the 
servant of the true God is this; it is that the latter has 
experienced a complete turning away from self.  This only difference 
is all the difference in the world.  It is the realisation that this 
goodness that I thought was within me and of myself and upon which I 
rather prided myself, is without me and above myself, and infinitely 
greater and stronger than I.  It is the immortal and I am mortal.  
It is invincible and steadfast in its purpose, and I am weak and 
insecure.  It is no longer that I, out of my inherent and remarkable 
goodness, out of the excellence of my quality and the benevolence of 
my heart, give a considerable amount of time and attention to the 
happiness and welfare of others--because I choose to do so.  On the 
contrary I have come under a divine imperative, I am obeying an 
irresistible call, I am a humble and willing servant of the 
righteousness of God.  That altruism which Professor Metchnikoff and 
Mr. McCabe would have us regard as the goal and refuge of a broad 
and free intelligence, is really the first simple commandment in the 
religious life.
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. ANOTHER RELIGIOUS MATERIALIST
<P>
<P>
Now here is a passage from a book, "Evolution and the War," by 
Professor Metchnikoff's translator, Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, which 
comes even closer to our conception of God as an immortal being 
arising out of man, and external to the individual man.  He has been 
discussing that well-known passage of Kant's: "Two things fill my 
mind with ever-renewed wonder and awe the more often and deeper I 
dwell on them--the starry vault above me, and the moral law within 
me."
<P>
From that discussion, Dr. Chalmers Mitchell presently comes to this 
most definite and interesting statement:
<P>
<P>
"Writing as a hard-shell Darwinian evolutionist, a lover of the 
scalpel and microscope, and of patient, empirical observation, as 
one who dislikes all forms of supernaturalism, and who does not 
shrink from the implications even of the phrase that thought is a 
secretion of the brain as bile is a secretion of the liver, I assert 
as a biological fact that the moral law is as real and as external 
to man as the starry vault.  It has no secure seat in any single man 
or in any single nation.  It is the work of the blood and tears of 
long generations of men.  It is not in man, inborn or innate, but is 
enshrined in his traditions, in his customs, in his literature and 
his religion.  Its creation and sustenance are the crowning glory of 
man, and his consciousness of it puts him in a high place above the 
animal world.  Men live and die; nations rise and fall, but the 
struggle of individual lives and of individual nations must be 
measured not by their immediate needs, but as they tend to the 
debasement or perfection of man's great achievement."
<P>
<P>
This is the same reality.  This is the same Link and Captain that 
this book asserts.  It seems to me a secondary matter whether we 
call Him "Man's Great Achievement" or "The Son of Man" or the "God 
of Mankind" or "God."  So far as the practical and moral ends of 
life are concerned, it does not matter how we explain or refuse to 
explain His presence in our lives.
<P>
There is but one possible gap left between the position of Dr. 
Chalmers Mitchell and the position of this book.  In this book it is 
asserted that GOD RESPONDS, that he GIVES courage and the power of 
self-suppression to our weakness.
<P>
<P>
<P>
5. A NOTE ON A LECTURE BY PROFESSOR GILBERT MURRAY
<P>
<P>
Let me now quote and discuss a very beautiful passage from a lecture 
upon Stoicism by Professor Gilbert Murray, which also displays the 
same characteristic of an involuntary shaping out of God in the 
forms of denial.  It is a passage remarkable for its conscientious 
and resolute Agnosticism.  And it is remarkable too for its 
blindness to the possibility of separating quite completely the idea 
of the Infinite Being from the idea of God.  It is another striking 
instance of that obsession of modern minds by merely Christian 
theology of which I have already complained.  Professor Murray has 
quoted Mr. Bevan's phrase for God, "the Friend behind phenomena," 
and he does not seem to realise that that phrase carries with it no 
obligation whatever to believe that this Friend is in control of the 
phenomena.  He assumes that he is supposed to be in control as if it 
were a matter of course:
<P>
<P>
"We do seem to find," Professor Murray writes, "not only in all 
religions, but in practically all philosophies, some belief that man 
is not quite alone in the universe, but is met in his endeavours 
towards the good by some external help or sympathy.  We find it 
everywhere in the unsophisticated man.  We find it in the unguarded 
self-revelations of the most severe and conscientious Atheists.  
Now, the Stoics, like many other schools of thought, drew an 
argument from this consensus of all mankind.  It was not an absolute 
proof of the existence of the Gods or Providence, but it was a 
strong indication.  The existence of a common instinctive belief in 
the mind of man gives at least a presumption that there must be a 
good cause for that belief.
<P>
"This is a reasonable position.  There must be some such cause.  But 
it does not follow that the only valid cause is the truth of the 
content of the belief.  I cannot help suspecting that this is 
precisely one of those points on which Stoicism, in company with 
almost all philosophy up to the present time, has gone astray 
through not sufficiently realising its dependence on the human mind 
as a natural biological product.  For it is very important in this 
matter to realise that the so-called belief is not really an 
intellectual judgment so much as a craving of the whole nature.
<P>
"It is only of very late years that psychologists have begun to 
realise the enormous dominion of those forces in man of which he is 
normally unconscious.  We cannot escape as easily as these brave men 
dreamed from the grip of the blind powers beneath the threshold.  
Indeed, as I see philosophy after philosophy falling into this 
unproven belief in the Friend behind phenomena, as I find that I 
myself cannot, except for a moment and by an effort, refrain from 
making the same assumption, it seems to me that perhaps here too we 
are under the spell of a very old ineradicable instinct.  We are 
gregarious animals; our ancestors have been such for countless ages.  
We cannot help looking out on the world as gregarious animals do; we 
see it in terms of humanity and of fellowship.  Students of animals 
under domestication have shown us how the habits of a gregarious 
creature, taken away from his kind, are shaped in a thousand details 
by reference to the lost pack which is no longer there--the pack 
which a dog tries to smell his way back to all the time he is out 
walking, the pack he calls to for help when danger threatens.  It is 
a strange and touching thing, this eternal hunger of the gregarious 
animal for the herd of friends who are not there.  And it may be, it 
may very possibly be, that, in the matter of this Friend behind 
phenomena our own yearning and our own almost ineradicable 
instinctive conviction, since they are certainly not founded on 
either reason or observation, are in origin the groping of a lonely-
souled gregarious animal to find its herd or its herd-leader in the 
great spaces between the stars.
<P>
"At any rate, it is a belief very difficult to get rid of."
<P>
<P>
There the passage and the lecture end.
<P>
I would urge that here again is an inadvertent witness to the 
reality of God.
<P>
Professor Murray writes of gregarious animals as though there 
existed solitary animals that are not gregarious, pure 
individualists, "atheists" so to speak, and as though this appeal to 
a life beyond one's own was not the universal disposition of living 
things.  His classical training disposes him to a realistic 
exaggeration of individual difference.  But nearly every animal, and 
certainly every mentally considerable animal, begins under parental 
care, in a nest or a litter, mates to breed, and is associated for 
much of its life.  Even the great carnivores do not go alone except 
when they are old and have done with the most of life.  Every pack, 
every herd, begins at some point in a couple, it is the equivalent 
of the tiger's litter if that were to remain undispersed.  And it is 
within the memory of men still living that in many districts the 
African lion has with a change of game and conditions lapsed from a 
"solitary" to a gregarious, that is to say a prolonged family habit 
of life.
<P>
Man too, if in his ape-like phase he resembled the other higher 
apes, is an animal becoming more gregarious and not less.  He has 
passed within the historical period from a tribal gregariousness to 
a nearly cosmopolitan tolerance.  And he has his tribe about him.  
He is not, as Professor Murray seems to suggest, a solitary LOST 
gregarious beast.  Why should his desire for God be regarded as the 
overflow of an unsatisfied gregarious instinct, when he has home, 
town, society, companionship, trade union, state, INCREASINGLY at 
hand to glut it?  Why should gregariousness drive a man to God 
rather than to the third-class carriage and the public-house?  Why 
should gregariousness drive men out of crowded Egyptian cities into 
the cells of the Thebaid?  Schopenhauer in a memorable passage 
(about the hedgehogs who assembled for warmth) is flatly opposed to 
Professor Murray, and seems far more plausible when he declares that 
the nature of man is insufficiently gregarious.  The parallel with 
the dog is not a valid one.
<P>
Does not the truth lie rather in the supposition that it is not the 
Friend that is the instinctive delusion but the isolation?  Is not 
the real deception, our belief that we are completely 
individualised, and is it not possible that this that Professor 
Murray calls "instinct" is really not a vestige but a new thing 
arising out of our increasing understanding, an intellectual 
penetration to that greater being of the species, that vine, of 
which we are the branches?  Why should not the soul of the species, 
many faceted indeed, be nevertheless a soul like our own?
<P>
Here, as in the case of Professor Metchnikoff, and in many other 
cases of atheism, it seems to me that nothing but an inadequate 
understanding of individuation bars the way to at least the 
intellectual recognition of the true God.

6. RELIGION AS ETHICS
<P>
<P>
And while I am dealing with rationalists, let me note certain recent 
interesting utterances of Sir Harry Johnston's.  You will note that 
while in this book we use the word "God" to indicate the God of the 
Heart, Sir Harry uses "God" for that idea of God-of-the-Universe, 
which we have spoken of as the Infinite Being.  This use of the word 
"God" is of late theological origin; the original identity of the 
words "good" and "god" and all the stories of the gods are against 
him.  But Sir Harry takes up God only to define him away into 
incomprehensible necessity.  Thus:
<P>
<P>
"We know absolutely nothing concerning the Force we call God; and, 
assuming such an intelligent ruling force to be in existence, 
permeating this universe of millions of stars and (no doubt) tens of 
millions of planets, we do not know under what conditions and 
limitations It works.  We are quite entitled to assume that the end 
of such an influence is intended to be order out of chaos, happiness 
and perfection out of incompleteness and misery; and we are entitled 
to identify the reactionary forces of brute Nature with the 
anthropomorphic Devil of primitive religions, the power of darkness 
resisting the power of light.  But in these conjectures we must 
surely come to the conclusion that the theoretical potency we call 
'God' makes endless experiments, and scrap-heaps the failures.  
Think of the Dinosaurs and the expenditure of creative energy that 
went to their differentiation and their wellnigh incredible physical 
development. . . .
<P>
"To such a Divine Force as we postulate, the whole development and 
perfecting of life on this planet, the whole production of man, may 
seem little more than to any one of us would be the chipping out, 
the cutting, the carving, and the polishing of a gem; and we should 
feel as little remorse or pity for the scattered dust and fragments 
as must the Creative Force of the immeasurably vast universe feel 
for the DISJECTA MEMBRA of perfected life on this planet. . . ."
<P>
<P>
But thence he goes on to a curiously imperfect treatment of the God 
of man as if he consisted in nothing more than some vague sort of 
humanitarianism.  Sir Harry's ideas are much less thoroughly thought 
out than those of any other of these sceptical writers I have 
quoted.  On that account they are perhaps more typical.  He speaks 
as though Christ were simply an eminent but illreported and 
abominably served teacher of ethics--and yet of the only right ideal 
and ethics.  He speaks as though religions were nothing more than 
ethical movements, and as though Christianity were merely someone 
remarking with a bright impulsiveness that everything was simply 
horrid, and so, "Let us instal loving kindness as a cardinal axiom.   
He ignores altogether the fundamental essential of religion, which 
is THE DEVELOPMENT AND SYNTHESIS OF THE DIVERGENT AND CONFLICTING 
MOTIVES OF THE UNCONVERTED LIFE, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL LIFE WITH THE IMMORTAL PURPOSE OF GOD.  He presents a 
conception of religion relieved of its "nonsense" as the cheerful 
self-determination of a number of bright little individuals (much 
stirred but by no means overcome by Cosmic Pity) to the Service of 
Man.  As he seems to present it, it is as outward a thing, it goes 
as little into the intimacy of their lives, as though they had after 
proper consideration agreed to send a subscription to a Red Cross 
Ambulance or take part in a public demonstration against the 
Armenian Massacres, or do any other rather nice-spirited exterior 
thing.  This is what he says:
<P>
<P>
"I hope that the religion of the future will devote itself wholly to 
the Service of Man.  It can do so without departing from the 
Christian ideal and Christian ethics.  It need only drop all that is 
silly and disputable, and 'mattering not neither here nor there,' of 
Christian theology--a theology virtually absent from the direct 
teaching of Christ--and all of Judaistic literature or prescriptions 
not made immortal in their application by unassailable truth and by 
the confirmation of science.  An excellent remedy for the nonsense 
which still clings about religion may be found in two books: Cotter 
Monson's 'Service of Man,' which was published as long ago as 1887, 
and has since been re-issued by the Rationalist Press Association in 
its well-known sixpenny series, and J. Allanson Picton's 'Man and 
the Bible.'  Similarly, those who wish to acquire a sane view of the 
relations between man and God would do well to read Winwood Reade's 
'Martyrdom of Man.'"
<P>
<P>
Sir Harry in fact clears the ground for God very ably, and then 
makes a well-meaning gesture in the vacant space.  There is no help 
nor strength in his gesture unless God is there.  Without God, the 
"Service of Man" is no better than a hobby or a sentimentality or an 
hypocrisy in the undisciplined prison of the mortal life.
