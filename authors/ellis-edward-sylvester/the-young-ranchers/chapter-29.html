<p>Accustomed as are the Sioux to scenes of violence, it is not
probable that any members of the party to whom we have been referring
ever looked upon a sight so remarkable as the prairie duel between
Starcus and the young rancher.</p>

<p>This Indian, who had come among his native people in the hope
of staying the tide of frenzy sweeping through the tribe, was
himself carried away by the craze, and from a peaceable, well-educated
youth became among the most violent of those that arrayed themselves
against the white man.</p>

<p>It was one of the better impulses of his nature that led him
to fire the shot when Tim Brophy was in such danger from the grizzly
bear; but, as he afterward confessed, it was no sooner done than
he reproached himself for not having turned his weapon against
the two youths for whom he had once entertained a strong friendship.</p>

<p>When the headlong Irishman started toward him, Starcus hurried
away, and not only joined a band of prowling hostiles, but told
them of the lads, and joined in a scheme to capture and hold them
as hostages for several turbulent Sioux then in the hands of the
Government authorities. Knowing them as well as he did, he formed
the plan of stealing up behind them, while they were riding across
the snowy prairie, and the partial success of the plan has been
shown.</p>

<p>His comrades watched the opening and progress of the strange
duel with no misgiving as to the results. They saw how a run of
wonderful fortune had helped the young rancher, but now, when
something like equality existed between the combatants, the superiority
of the American over the Caucasian race must manifest itself.</p>

<p>As events progressed the interest of the spectators deepened.
They descended to the edge of the plain, where the view was unobstructed,
leaving but a solitary warrior guarding the prisoner. The solicitude
of the latter for his friend was as intense as it could be, for
he could not be sure of the result until the end. He feared that
Warren Starr was committing the same rashness for which he had
often chided him.</p>

<p>The view from the rocks through the intervening trees was so
imperfect that it grew to be exasperating, but there seemed to
be no help for it.</p>

<p>The warrior in charge of Tim Brophy was expected to give his
full attention to him, but as events progressed there was danger
of his forgetting this duty. He began to look more to the singular
contest than to his captive.</p>

<p>This Indian was standing on his feet, leaning forward, and peering
as best he could between the trees and the obstructing limbs.
Tim was seated on a bowlder at his side, and until this moment
was the target of a pair of eyes that would have detected the
slightest movement on his part.</p>

<p>The Irishman was quick to observe that by the strange trend of
events a golden opportunity had or was about to come to him. The
warrior seemed to forget him entirely, though, like all his people,
he would be recalled with lightning quickness on hearing or seeing
anything amiss.</p>

<p>Surely no such chance could come again. Convinced of this, Tim
seized it with the rush of a hurricane.</p>

<p>Rising quickly and noiselessly to his feet he delivered a blow
as quick as a flash under the ear of the Sioux, which stretched
him like a dead man on his face.</p>

<p>There had been no noise, and in the excitement of the occasion
the Indians at the base of the ridge were not likely to learn
what had taken place until the revival of the senseless warrior,
who was not likely to become of any account for several minutes.</p>

<p>Tim needed no urging to improve his opportunity. Facing the top
of the ridge, he started off with a single desire of getting over
the rough ground as fast as possible.</p>

<p>He had taken but a few steps, however, when he abruptly stopped.</p>

<p>"Begorra!" he muttered, "but what a forgitful spalpeen is Tim
Brophy!"</p>

<p>He had no rifle. That would never do, when pursuit was inevitable
in a short time. Accordingly, he turned about, ran to the prostrate
figure, and took the gun from his grasp. It was not as good as
his own, but inasmuch as that was in the possession of one of
the others it was beyond recovery.</p>

<p>It seemed cruel, but to make matters safe the Irishman gave the
prostrate fellow a second vigorous blow, from which he was certain
not to recover for a considerable while.</p>

<p>"I hate to hit a man whin he is down," he reflected. "If I meets
him ag'in I'll ax his pardon."</p>

<p>It was no time to indulge in sentiment, and he was off once more.</p>

<p>Some strange fate directed his steps, without his noticing the
fact, along the trail made by Warren Starr in his first hurried
flight. Thus it was that he came upon the other warrior that had
been outwitted by the youth whom he was so confident of capturing.</p>

<p>Urgent as was his hurry, the fugitive paused a moment to contemplate
the sight. Then with a sigh he hurried forward, for not a moment
was to be lost.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that, after having captured the young man with
so much difficulty, they should have invited him to escape, as
they virtually did by their action, but the circumstances themselves
were exceptional. The like could not happen again.</p>

<p>It was the same curious turn of events that extended his opportunity.
It is rare, indeed, that, after a captive does make a break for
freedom, he is allowed such a period in which to secure it; but
here again the unparalleled series of incidents favored him.</p>

<p>There had been no outcry on the part of the third victim to Tim
Brophy's good right arm. But for the forgetfulness of the youth
in starting off without his gun, the fellow would have recovered
speedily and made an outcry that must have brought several of
his confederates to the spot.</p>

<p>But events were interesting beyond compare out on the prairie.
All the Sioux but the one named were watching them, and when they
saw the plight of Starcus there was a general rush to his assistance.
The return was slow, being retarded by the efforts of several
to capture their wandering ponies. When they succeeded in doing
this and coming back to the edge of the plains, the better part
of half an hour had passed.</p>

<p>The first startling recollection that came to the party after
this return was the fact that the warrior who had pursued the
young rancher up the side of the ridge had not put in an appearance.
They would have awakened to this fact long before but for the
affair between Warren Starr and Starcus. Now that it was impressed
upon them, and they recalled the report of the gun that reached
them long ago, together with the reappearance of the young rancher
on the back of his pony, they could not fail to see the suspicious
aspect of things.</p>

<p>There was a hasty consultation at the base of the ridge, and
then the man who was really the leader ordered a couple of his
warriors to lose no time in learning the truth. As eager as he
to investigate, they set out without delay, but had not gone far
when one of them uttered a cry which brought the whole party to
the spot.</p>

<p>A striking scene greeted them. The white prisoner was gone, and
the Indian left in charge lay on his face like one dead. His gun
was missing. Strange proceedings had taken place during the absence
of the party.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to learn the truth. It was easy to
see that the interest of the guard in the incidents on the plain
had caused him to forget his duty for the time. The Irishman had
suddenly assailed him with that terrible right arm of his, and
felled him senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>The recipient of this attention was not dead, but he felt as
though he wished he was, when he was helped to a sitting position,
and was compelled not only to suffer the pain of the terrific
blows received, but had to face the jeering looks of his companions,
who could forgive anything sooner than the outwitting of a full-grown
warrior by a trick which ought not to have deceived a child.</p>
