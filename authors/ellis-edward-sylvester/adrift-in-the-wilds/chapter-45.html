<p>When the Pah Utah entered the cave he did not appear to notice
Elwood Brandon. The latter attributed this to the semi-darkness
in which he stood, and was about to go forward and claim his friendship
when something restrained him, and he concluded to wait until
the Indian first recognized him.</p>

<p>Shasta exchanged a few words with his friends, and immediately
several of them went out in the darkness. When they returned,
which was very speedily, they each bore a goodly bundle of sticks
and kindlings. In what part of the wide creation they obtained
them, directly after such a deluge of rain, it is impossible to
tell, but American Indians have a peculiar faculty of doing such
odd things.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a blaze sprung out from the center of the
bundle placed in the middle of the cave, and when Elwood looked
downward toward it, he saw that Shasta was kneeling before the
pile engaged in igniting it. As the flame flared out and illuminated
the cave, the Pah Utah looked up and met the eyes of Elwood. For
an instant, his black eyes were fixed upon him, and then he placed
his finger to his lips and looked down again. The boy understood
it all. <em>He didn't know anything of the Pah Utah.</em></p>

<p>The fire burned vigorously and soon diffused a genial warmth
throughout the cave. It was most grateful indeed to Elwood, who
approached and subjected himself to a toasting process. The savages
offered no objection, and he soon managed to secure a pleasant
warmth, and partially to dry his damp clothes.</p>

<p>He could not prevent himself from continually glancing at Shasta,
but he never once caught his eye, and understanding the Indian's
wishes, he compensated for this impertinence by staring twice
as long at the other hideous visages.</p>

<p>After all the great want of Elwood was food. He had fasted for
thirty hours, and was faint and feeble. A month before such severe
abstinence would have left him unable to stand; but the severe
deprivation and hardship of the last week, united with its firm,
buoyant constitution, and his freedom from the degrading use of
tobacco, had developed a strength and endurance remarkable in
one so young. He felt that he could wait until the next day without
a mouthful, and still be able to travel; but the fainting, craving,
hollow feeling rendered him uncomfortable and caused more than
one longing look around the cavern and in the faces of his dusky-hued
friends; but if the Indians understood his suffering they certainly
did not care enough about them to give them heed.</p>

<p>His hope was in the Pah Utah, but his situation was such as to
deprive him of the expression of this hope. Shasta had given him
to understand in an unmistakable manner that for the present they
were to remain strangers; and no matter what his distress might
be, he dare not disregard this command.</p>

<p>Yet Elwood Brandon believed, if the Indian understood his case,
he would find some means to relieve him, slight though it was.
Finally he decided upon his course of action.</p>

<p>Walking up to the tall Indian, who had received his previous
request in such a threatening manner, and halting when at a safe
distance, he motioned to him for something to place in his mouth.
The unfeeling fellow scrutinized the boy a moment, and then coolly
turned his back upon him, and acted as though the supplication
had not been made.</p>

<p>He was equally unsuccessful with the others, and the refusal
of Shasta was made in a most emphatic manner. Glaring at the boy
like an enraged tiger, he brandished his knife and sprung toward
him with such a curdling yell that the youngster sprung trembling
back to the furtherest verge of the cavern, and the eyes of the
other Indians were all turned toward the expected tragedy. But
Elwood wasn't frightened&mdash;not a bit; he understood what it all
meant.</p>

<p>The performance was followed by a conversation between Shasta
and the tall Indian, who doubtless belonged to the Pah Utah nation
or some tribe friendly with them. It's precise import Elwood found
impossible to determine, but he could not avoid a feeling of uneasiness
when he saw by unmistakable signs that it referred to himself.</p>

<p>It looked very much as though Shasta was urging immediate disposal
of the prisoner, and his friend was strenuously maintaining a
different action. The Pah Utah showed great excitement, very often
turning and gesticulating toward Elwood, and once or twice he
look a step or two in that direction, as if he had resolved on
a certain and speedy death for him.</p>

<p>Finally, he appeared to yield the point, and turned his back
upon his disputant and walked to the fire. As he did so his face
was revealed alone to Elwood Brandon, and looking toward him,
the boy again saw him place his finger to his lips and give that
warning expression, which said as plainly as words, "Don't be
frightened; all things are working right!"</p>

<p>This was certainly gratifying, but our young friend was already
satisfied upon this point, and would have much preferred a more
substantial mark of friendship in the shape of something to supply
the craving within. But on the very eve of despair he was delighted
to see a couple of Indians&mdash;whose absence he had noted for the
last half-hour&mdash;return heavily laden with fish. These were immediately
taken in charge, by Shasta, and the savor of them as they were
cooking drove the famishing boy almost frantic.</p>

<p>While he sat with longing eyes, watching the motions of the cook,
one of the fat roasted fellows suddenly shot from his hand and
fell into the lap of the boy. The Pah Utah did not raise his head,
and the act looked as if it were a voluntary one upon the part
of the fish to escape the hands of its tormentors&mdash;so dexterously
was the whole thing done.</p>

<p>Elwood did not stop to thank his considerate friend, but devoured
the food precisely in the fashion that a boy attacks a pile of
gingerbread which he has been expecting and longing for during
a half-day. When he had finished the fish, another in just as
prime condition dropped into his lap, apparently from the top
of the cave above.</p>

<p>This satisfied his hunger, and he arose to his feet, casting
his eyes toward Shasta, and testifying by his looks the gratitude
which he dare not express audibly. He remained in the rear of
the cavern, patiently waiting the pleasure of the Pah Utah regarding
himself.</p>

<p>The Indians completed their meal, and then exchanged a few words,
when they prepared to leave. Elwood watched them with interest,
and when the tall fellow motioned for him to come forward, he
did so with alacrity, and took him place in the rear of the line
which was formed. Glancing back as they were about to start, he
saw by the light of the fire that the one immediately behind him
was Shasta.</p>

<p>The night was utterly dark&mdash;above, below and all around. The
hand of the Pah Utah was placed upon his shoulder, as if to guide
him aright, and the march began.</p>

<p>Of course it was impossible for Elwood to tell where he was going,
but he followed blindly the direction of him behind for a hundred
yards, when he knew by the brushing of his hands against the sides
that they were passing through a narrow passage. All at once he
felt himself seized by an iron grip from behind, lifted from his
feet and tossed into the air. He did not fall back in the path
they were traversing, but lit lightly upon a ledge, where he concluded
to remain until he heard further from the gentleman who had elevated
him to that position.</p>
