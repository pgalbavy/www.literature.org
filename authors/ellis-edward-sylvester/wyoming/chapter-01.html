<p>On the sultry third of July, 1778, Fred Godfrey, a sturdy youth
of eighteen years, was riding at a breakneck speed down the Wyoming
Valley, in the direction of the settlement, from which he saw
columns of smoke rolling upward, and whence, during the few pauses
of his steed, he heard the rattling discharge of firearms and
the shouts of combatants.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether I am too late," he asked himself more than
once, and he urged his splendid horse to a greater pace; "the
road never seemed so long."</p>

<p>Ah, there was good cause for the anxiety of the lad, for in that
lovely Wyoming Valley lived those who were dearer to him than
all the world beside, and whatever fate overtook the settlers
must be shared by him as well. He had ridden his horse hard, and
his flanks glistened with wet and foam, but though every foot
of the winding road was familiar to him, it appeared in his torturing
impatience to be double its usual length.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey had received the promise of his father, on the breaking
out of the Revolution, that he might enlist in the patriot army
so soon as he reached the age of seventeen. On the very day that
he attained that age he donned the Continental uniform, made for
him by loving hands, bade his friends good-bye, and hastened away
to where Washington was longing for just such lusty youths as
he who appeared to be several years younger than he really was.</p>

<p>Fred was a handsome, athletic youngster, and he sat his horse
with the grace of a crusader. Although the day was warm, and his
face glowed with perspiration, he wore his cocked hat, blue coat
with its white facings, the belt around the waist and another
which passed over one shoulder ere it joined the one around the
middle of his body, knee-breeches, and strong stockings and shoes.
His rifle was slung across his back, and a couple of loaded single-barreled
pistols were thrust in his belt, where they could be drawn the
instant needed.</p>

<p>During his year's service in the patriot army Fred had proven
himself an excellent soldier, and the dash and nerve which he
showed in more than one instance caught the eye of Washington
himself, and won the youth a lieutenancy, at the time when he
was the youngest member of his company.</p>

<p>The ardent patriot was full of ambition, and was sure, should
no accident befall him, of gaining higher honors. When he tramped
with several other recruits from Wyoming to the camp of the Continentals,
hundreds of miles away, one of his greatest comforts was the belief
that, no matter how the current of war drifted back and forth,
there was no danger of its reaching Wyoming. That lovely and secluded
valley was so far removed from the tread of the fierce hosts that
they might feel secure.</p>

<p>But behold! News came to Washington that the Tories and Indians
were about to march into the valley with torch and tomahawk, and
he was begged to send re-enforcements without delay. The Father
of his Country was then on his campaign through the Jerseys. The
British army had withdrawn from Philadelphia, where it spent the
winter, and Clinton with a part of the force was marching overland
to New York, with the Continentals in pursuit.</p>

<p>The campaign was so important that the commander-in-chief could
ill afford to spare a man. He knew that Wyoming was not entirely
defenseless. Colonel Zebulon Butler of the Continental army was
marshaling the old men and boys, and there was the strong defense
known as Forty Fort, built by the original settlers from Connecticut,
not to mention Wilkesbarre near at hand, so that it would seem
the settlers ought to be able to protect themselves against any
force likely to be brought against them.</p>

<p>However, Washington told several of his recruits from Wyoming
of the appeal that had been made to him, and gave them permission
to go to the help of their friends, though he added that he did
not think it possible for them to reach the ground in time to
be of service.</p>

<p>But a half dozen started on foot toward the threatened point.
Within a day's tramp of their destination they fell somewhat apart,
as each, in his familiarity of the country, believed that he knew
a shorter and quicker way home than the others.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey was almost in sight of his home, when he was both
pleased and alarmed by coming upon an estray horse. He was saddled
and bridled, and though contentedly cropping the grass at the
roadside, the perspiration and jaded look showed that he had come
from the battle-ground. It was startling to know that such was
the fact, and supplemented as it was by the reports of guns, shouts,
and the black volumes of smoke pouring upward, Fred was filled
with an anguish of misgiving.</p>

<p>Without stopping to make inquiries or to guess who could have
owned the estray steed, the young patriot slipped forward, caught
the bridle before the animal had time to scent danger, and vaulting
lightly into the saddle, turned the head of the horse toward Wyoming,
and striking his heels against his ribs, quickly urged him to
a dead run.</p>

<p>"I am needed there," said Fred, urging his spirited animal still
more, and peering down the highway; "you're the best horse I ever
rode, but I can't afford to spare you now."</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey not only was close to the stirring scenes that marked
that memorable massacre, but he was among them sooner even than
he anticipated.</p>
