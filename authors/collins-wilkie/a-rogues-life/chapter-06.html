<P>
ON the next day, I was introduced to the Jew's workshop, and to
the eminent gentlemen occupying it. My model Rembrandt was put
before me; the simple elementary rules were explained; and my
materials were all placed under my hands.
<P>
Regard for the lovers of the Old Masters, and for the moral
well-being of society, forbids me to be particular about the
nature of my labors, or to go into dangerous detail on the
subject of my first failures and my subsequent success. I may,
however, harmlessly admit that my Rembrandt was to be of the
small or cabinet size, and that, as there was a run on
Burgomasters just then, my subject was naturally to be of the
Burgomaster sort. Three parts of my picture consisted entirely of
different shades of dirty brown and black; the fourth being
composed of a ray of yellow light falling upon the wrinkled face
of a treacle-colored old man. A dim glimpse of a hand, and a
faint suggestion of something like a brass washhand
 basin, completed the job, which gave great satisfaction to Mr.
Pickup, and which was described in the catalogue as--
<P>
<P>
<P>
"A Burgomaster at Breakfast. Originally in the collection of
Mynheer Van Grubb. Amsterdam. A rare example of the master. Not
engraved. The chiar'oscuro in this extraordinary work is of a
truly sublime character. Price, Two Hundred Guineas."
<P>
<P>
<P>
I got five pounds for it. I suppose Mr. Pickup got
one-ninety-five.
<P>
This was perhaps not very encouraging as a beginning, in a
pecuniary point of view. But I was to get five pounds more, if my
Rembrandt sold within a given time. It sold a week after it was
in a fit state to be trusted in the showroom. I got my money, and
began enthusiastically on another Rembrandt--"A Burgomaster's
Wife Poking the Fire." Last time, the chiar'oscuro of the master
had been yellow and black, this time it was to be red and black.
I was just on the point of forcing my way into Mr. Pickup's
confidence, as I had resolved, when a catastrophe happened, which
shut up the shop and abruptly terminated my experience as a maker
of Old Masters.
<P>
"The Burgomaster's Breakfast" had been sold to a new customer, a
venerable connoisseur, blessed with a great fortune and a large
picture-gallery. The old gentleman was in raptures with the
picture--with its tone, with its breadth, with its grand feeling
for effect, with its simple treatment of detail. It wanted
nothing, in his opinion, but a little cleaning. Mr. Pickup knew
the raw and ticklish state of the surface, however, far too well,
to allow of even an attempt at performing this process, and
solemnly asserted, that he was acquainted with no cleansing
preparation which could be used on the Rembrandt without danger
of "flaying off the last exquisite glazings of the immortal
master's brush." The old gentleman was quite satisfied with this
reason for not cleaning the Burgomaster, and took away his
purchase in his own carriage on the spot.
<P>
For three weeks we heard nothing more of him. At the end of that
time, a Hebrew friend of Mr. Pickup, employed in a lawyer's
office, terrified us all by the information that a gentleman
related to our venerable connoisseur had seen the Rembrandt, had
pronounced it to be an impudent counterfeit, and had engaged on
his own account to have the picture tested in a court of law, and
to charge the seller and maker thereof with conspiring to obtain
money under false pretenses. Mr. Pickup and I looked at each
other with very blank faces on receiving this agreeable piece of
news. What was to be done? I recovered the full use of my
faculties first; and I was the man who solved that important and
difficult question, while the rest were still utterly bewildered
by it. "Will you promise me five and twenty pounds in the
presence of these gentlemen if I get you out of this scrape?"
said I to my terrified employer. Ishmael Pickup wrung his dirty
hands and answered, "Yesh, my dear!"
<P>
Our informant in this awkward matter was employed at the office
of the lawyers who were to have the conducting of the case
against us; and he was able to tell me some of the things I most
wanted to know in relation to the picture.
<P>
I found out from him that the Rembrandt was still in our
customer's possession. The old gentleman had consented to the
question of its genuineness being tried, but had far too high an
idea of his own knowledge as a connoisseur to incline to the
opinion that he had been taken in. His suspicious relative was
not staying in the house, but was in the habit of visiting him,
every day, in the forenoon. That was as much as I wanted to know
from others. The rest depended on myself, on luck, time, human
credulity, and a smattering of chemical knowledge which I had
acquired in the days of my medical studies. I left the conclave
at the picture-dealer's forthwith, and purchased at the nearest
druggist's a bottle containing a certain powerful liquid, which I
decline to particularize on high moral grounds. I labeled the
bottle "The Amsterdam Cleansing Compound"; and I wrapped round it
the following note:
<P>
<P>
<P>
"Mr. Pickup's respectful compliments to Mr.--(let us say, Green).
Is rejoiced to state that he finds himself unexpectedly able to
forward Mr. Green's views relative to the cleaning of 'The
Burgomaster's Breakfast.' The inclosed compound has just reached
him from Amsterdam. It is made from a recipe found among the
papers of Rembrandt himself--has been used with the most
astonishing results on the Master's pictures in every gallery of
Holland, and is now being applied to the surface of the largest
Rembrandt in Mr. P.'s own collection. Directions for use: Lay the
picture flat, pour the whole contents of the bottle over it
gently, so as to flood the entire surface; leave the liquid on
the surface for six hours, then wipe it off briskly with a soft
cloth of as large a size as can be conveniently used. The effect
will be the most wonderful removal of all dirt, and a complete
and brilliant metamorphosis of the present dingy surface of the
picture."
<P>
<P>
<P>
I left this note and the bottle myself at two o'clock that day;
then went home, and confidently awaited the result.
<P>
The next morning our friend from the office called, announcing
himself by a burst of laughter outside the door. Mr. Green had
implicitly followed the directions in the letter the moment he
received it--had allowed the "Amsterdam Cleansing Compound" to
remain on the Rembrandt until eight o'clock in the evening--had
called for the softest linen cloth in the whole house--and had
then, with his own venerable hands, carefully wiped off the
compound, and with it the whole surface of the picture! The
brown, the black, the Burgomaster, the breakfast, and the ray of
yellow light, all came clean off together in considerably less
than a minute of time. If the picture, was brought into court
now, the evidence it could give against us was limited to a bit
of plain panel, and a mass of black pulp rolled up in a duster.
<P>
Our line of defense was, of course, that the compound had been
improperly used. For the rest, we relied with well-placed
confidence on the want of evidence against us. Mr. Pickup wisely
closed his shop for a while, and went off to the Continent to
ransack the foreign galleries. I received my five and twenty
pounds, rubbed out the beginning of my second Rembrandt, closed
the back door of the workshop behind me, and there was another
scene of my life at an end. I had but one circumstance to
regret--and I did regret it bitterly. I was still as ignorant as
ever of the young lady's name and address.
<P>
My first visit was to the studio of my excellent artist-friend,
whom I have already presented to the reader under the sympathetic
name of "Dick." He greeted me with a letter in his hand. It was
addressed to me--it had been left at the studio a few days since;
and (marvel of all marvels!) the handwriting was Mr.
Batterbury's. Had this philanthropic man not done befriending me
even yet? Were there any present or prospective advantages to be
got out of him still? Read his letter, and judge.
<P>
<P>
<P>
"SIR--Although you have forfeited by your ungentlemanly conduct
toward myself, and your heartlessly mischievous reception of my
dear wife, all claim upon the forbearance of the most forbearing
of your relatives, I am disposed, from motives of regard for the
tranquillity of Mrs. Batterbury's family, and of sheer
good-nature so far as I am myself concerned, to afford you one
more chance of retrieving your position by leading a respectable
life. The situation I am enabled to offer you is that of
secretary to a new Literary and Scientific Institution, about to
be opened in the town of Duskydale, near which neighborhood I
possess, as you must be aware, some landed property. The office
has been placed at my disposal, as vice-president of the new
Institution. The salary is fifty pounds a year, with apartments
on the attic-floor of the building. The duties are various, and
will be explained to you by the local committee, if you choose to
present yourself to them with the inclosed letter of
introduction. After the unscrupulous manner in which you have
imposed on my liberality by deceiving me into giving you fifty
pounds for a n audacious caricature of myself, which it is
impossible to hang up in any room of the house, I think this
instance of my forgiving disposition still to befriend you, after
all that has happened, ought to appeal to any better feelings
that you may still have left, and revive the long dormant
emotions of repentance and self-reproach, when you think on your
obedient servant,
<P>
<P>
"DANIEL BATTERBURY."
<P>
Bless me! What A long-winded style, and what a fuss about fifty
pounds a year, and a bed in an attic! These were naturally the
first emotions which Mr. Batterbury's letter produced in me. What
was his real motive for writing it? I hope nobody will do me so
great an injustice as to suppose that I hesitated for one instant
about the way of finding <i>that</i> out. Of course I started off
directly to inquire if Lady Malkinshaw had had another narrow
escape of dying before me.
<P>
"Much better, sir," answered my grandmother's venerable butler,
wiping his lips carefully before he spoke; "her ladyship's health
has been much improved since her accident."
<P>
"Accident!" I exclaimed. "What, another? Lately? Stairs again?"
<P>
"No, sir; the drawing-room window this time," answered the
butler, with semi-tipsy gravity. "Her ladyship's sight having
been defective of late years, occasions her some difficulty in
calculating distances. Three days ago, her ladyship went to look
out of the window, and, miscalculating the distance--" Here the
butler, with a fine dramatic feeling for telling a story, stopped
just before the climax of the narrative, and looked me in the
face with an expression of the deepest sympathy.
<P>
"And miscalculating the distance?" I repeated impatiently.
<P>
"Put her head through a pane of glass," said the butler, in a
soft voice suited to the pathetic nature of the communication.
"By great good fortune her ladyship had been dressed for the day,
and had got her turban on. This saved her ladyship's head. But
her ladyship's neck, sir, had a very narrow escape. A bit of the
broken glass wounded it within half a quarter of an inch of the
carotty artery" (meaning, probably, carotid); "I heard the
medical gentleman say, and shall never forget it to my dying day,
that her ladyship's life had been saved by a hair-breadth. As it
was, the blood lost (the medical gentleman said that, too, sir)
was accidentally of the greatest possible benefit, being
apoplectic, in the way of clearing out the system. Her ladyship's
appetite has been improved ever since--the carriage is out airing
of her at this very moment--likewise, she takes the footman's arm
and the maid's up and downstairs now, which she never would hear
of before this last accident. 'I feel ten years younger' (those
were her ladyship's own words to me, this very day), 'I feel ten
years younger, Vokins, since I broke the drawing-room window.'
And her ladyship looks it!"
<P>
No doubt. Here was the key to Mr. Batterbury's letter of
forgiveness. His chance of receiving the legacy looked now
further off than ever; he could not feel the same confidence as
his wife in my power of living down any amount of starvation and
adversity; and he was, therefore, quite ready to take the first
opportunity of promoting my precious personal welfare and
security, of which he could avail himself, without spending a
farthing of money. I saw it all clearly, and admired the
hereditary toughness of the Malkinshaw family more gratefully
than ever. What should I do? Go to Duskydale? Why not? It didn't
matter to me where I went, now that I had no hope of ever seeing
those lovely brown eyes again.
<P>
I got to my new destination the next day, presented my
credentials, gave myself the full advantage of my high
connections, and was received with enthusiasm and distinction.
<P>
I found the new Institution torn by internal schisms even before
it was opened to the public. Two factious governed it--a grave
faction and a gay faction. Two questions agitated it: the first
referring to the propriety of celebrating the opening season by a
public ball, and the second to the expediency of admitting novels
into the library. The grim Puritan interest of the whole
neighborhood was, of course, on the grave side--against both
dancing and novels, as proposed by local loose thinkers and
latitudinarians of every degree. I was officially introduced to
the debate at the height of the squabble; and found myself one of
a large party in a small room, sitting round a long table, each
man of us with a new pewter inkstand, a new quill pen, and a
clean sheet of foolscap paper before him. Seeing that everybody
spoke, I got on my legs along with the rest, and made a slashing
speech on the loose-thinking side. I was followed by the leader
of the grim faction--an unlicked curate of the largest
dimensions.
<P>
"If there were, so to speak, no other reason against dancing,"
said my reverend opponent, "there is one unanswerable objection
to it. Gentlemen! John the Baptist lost his head through
dancing!"'
<P>
Every man of the grim faction hammered delightedly on the table,
as that formidable argument was produced; and the curate sat down
in triumph. I jumped up to reply, amid the counter-cheering of
the loose-thinkers; but before I could say a word the President
of the Institution and the rector of the parish came into the
room.
<P>
They were both men of authority, men of sense, and fathers of
charming daughters, and they turned the scale on the right side
in no time. The question relating to the admission of novels was
postponed, and the question of dancing or no dancing was put to
the vote on the spot. The President, the rector and myself, the
three handsomest and highest-bred men in the assembly, led the
way on the liberal side, waggishly warning all gallant gentlemen
present to beware of disappointing the young ladies. This decided
the waverers, and the waverers decided the majority. My first
business, as Secretary, was the drawing out of a model card of
admission to the ball.
<P>
My next occupation was to look at the rooms provided for me.
<P>
The Duskydale Institution occupied a badly-repaired ten-roomed
house, with a great flimsy saloon built at one side of it,
smelling of paint and damp plaster, and called the Lecture
Theater. It was the chilliest, ugliest, emptiest, gloomiest place
I ever entered in my life; the idea of doing anything but sitting
down and crying in it seemed to me quite preposterous; but the
committee took a different view of the matter, and praised the
Lecture Theater as a perfect ballroom. The Secretary's apartments
were two garrets, asserting themselves in the most barefaced
manner, without an attempt at disguise. If I had intended to do
more than earn my first quarter's salary, I should have
complained. But as I had not the slightest intention of remaining
at Duskydale, I could afford to establish a reputation for
amiability by saying nothing.
<P>
"Have you seen Mr. Softly, the new Secretary? A most
distinguished person, and quite an acquisition to the
neighborhood." Such was the popular opinion of me among the young
ladies and the liberal inhabitants. "Have you seen Mr. Softly,
the new Secretary? A worldly, vainglorious young man. The last
person in England to promote the interests of our new
Institution." Such was the counter-estimate of me among the
Puritan population. I report both opinions quite disinterestedly.
There is generally something to be said on either side of every
question; and, as for me, I can always hold up the scales
impartially, even when my own character is the substance weighing
in them. Readers of ancient history need not be reminded, at this
time of day, that there may be Roman virtue even in a Rogue.
<P>
The objects, interests, and general business of the Duskydale
Institution were matters with which I never thought of troubling
myself on assuming the duties of Secretary. All my energies were
given to the arrangements connected with the opening ball.
<P>
I was elected by acclamation to the office of general manager of
the entertainments; and I did my best to deserve the confidence
reposed in me; leaving literature and science, so far as I was
concerned, perfectly at liberty to advance themselves or not ,
just as they liked. Whatever my colleagues may have done, after I
left them, nobody at Duskydale can accuse me of having ever been
accessory to the disturbing of quiet people with useful
knowledge. I took the arduous and universally neglected duty of
teaching the English people how to be amused entirely on my own
shoulders, and left the easy and customary business of making
them miserable to others.
<P>
My unhappy countrymen! (and thrice unhappy they of the poorer
sort)--any man can preach to them, lecture to them, and form them
into classes--but where is the man who can get them to amuse
themselves? Anybody may cram their poor heads; but who will
brighten their grave faces? Don't read story-books, don't go to
plays, don't dance! Finish your long day's work and then
intoxicate your minds with solid history, revel in the
too-attractive luxury of the lecture-room, sink under the soft
temptation of classes for mutual instruction! How many potent,
grave and reverent tongues discourse to the popular ear in these
siren strains, and how obediently and resignedly this same weary
popular ear listens! What if a bold man spring up one day, crying
aloud in our social wilderness, "Play, for Heaven's sake, or you
will work yourselves into a nation of automatons! Shake a loose
leg to a lively fiddle! Women of England! drag the lecturer off
the rostrum, and the male mutual instructor out of the class, and
ease their poor addled heads of evenings by making them dance and
sing with you. Accept no offer from any man who cannot be proved,
for a year past, to have systematically lost his dignity at least
three times a week, after office hours. You, daughters of Eve,
who have that wholesome love of pleasure which is one of the
greatest adornments of the female character, set up a society for
the promotion of universal amusement, and save the British nation
from the lamentable social consequences of its own gravity!"
Imagine a voice crying lustily after this fashion--what sort of
echoes would it find?--Groans?
<P>
I know what sort of echoes my voice found. They were so
discouraging to me, and to the frivolous minority of
pleasure-seekers, that I recommended lowering the price of
admission so as to suit the means of any decent people who were
willing to leave off money-grubbing and tear themselves from the
charms of mutual instruction for one evening at least. The
proposition was indignantly negatived by the managers of the
Institution. I am so singularly obstinate a man that I was not to
be depressed even by this.
<P>
My next efforts to fill the ballroom could not be blamed. I
procured a local directory, put fifty tickets in my pocket,
dressed myself in nankeen pantaloons and a sky-blue coat (then
the height of fashion), and set forth to tout for dancers among
all the members of the genteel population, who, not being
notorious Puritans, had also not been so obliging as to take
tickets for the ball. There never was any pride or bashfulness
about me. Excepting certain periods of suspense and anxiety, I am
as even-tempered a Rogue as you have met with anywhere since the
days of Gil Blas.
<P>
My temperament being opposed to doing anything with regularity, I
opened the directory at hazard, and determined to make my first
call at the first house that caught my eye. Vallombrosa Vale
Cottages. No. 1. Doctor and Miss Dulcifer. Very good. I have no
preferences. Let me sell the first two tickets there. I found the
place; I opened the garden gate; I advanced to the door,
innocently wondering what sort of people I should find inside.
<P>
If I am asked what was the true reason for this extraordinary
activity on my part, in serving the interests of a set of people
for whom I cared nothing, I must honestly own that the loss of my
young lady was at the bottom of it. Any occupation was welcome
which kept my mind, in some degree at least, from dwelling on the
bitter disappointment that had befallen me. When I rang the bell
at No. 1, did I feel no presentiment of the exquisite surprise in
store for me? I felt nothing of the sort. The fact is, my
digestion is excellent. Presentiments are more closely connected
than is generally supposed with a weak state of stomach.
<P>
I asked for Miss Dulcifer, and was shown into the sitting-room.
<P>
Don't expect me to describe my sensations: hundreds of sensations
flew all over me. There she was, sitting alone, near the window!
There she was, with nimble white fingers, working a silk purse!
<P>
The melancholy in her face and manner, when I had last seen her,
appeared no more. She was prettily dressed in maize color, and
the room was well furnished. Her father had evidently got over
his difficulties. I had been inclined to laugh at his odd name,
when I found it in the directory! Now I began to dislike it,
because it was her name, too. It was a consolation to remember
that she could change it. Would she change it for mine?
<P>
I was the first to recover; I boldly drew a chair near her and
took her hand.
<P>
"You see," I said, "it is of no use to try to avoid me. This is
the third time we have met. Will you receive me as a visitor,
under these extraordinary circumstances? Will you give me a
little happiness to compensate for what I have suffered since you
left me?"
<P>
She smiled and blushed.
<P>
"I am so surprised," she answered, "I don't know what to say."
<P>
"Disagreeably surprised?" I asked.
<P>
She first went on with her work, and then replied (a little
sadly, as I thought):
<P>
"No!"
<P>
I was ready enough to take advantage of my opportunities this
time; but she contrived with perfect politeness to stop me. She
seemed to remember with shame, poor soul, the circumstances under
which I had last seen her.
<P>
"How do you come to be at Duskydale?" she inquired, abruptly
changing the subject. "And how did you find us out here?"
<P>
While I was giving her the necessary explanations her father came
in. I looked at him with considerable curiosity.
<P>
A tall stout gentleman with impressive respectability oozing out
of him at every pore--with a swelling outline of
black-waistcoated stomach, with a lofty forehead, with a smooth
double chin resting pulpily on a white cravat. Everything in
harmony about him except his eyes, and these were so sharp,
bright and resolute that they seemed to contradict the bland
conventionality which overspread all the rest of the man. Eyes
with wonderful intelligence and self-dependence in them; perhaps,
also, with something a little false in them, which I might have
discovered immediately under ordinary circumstances: but I looked
at the doctor through the medium of his daughter, and saw nothing
of him at the first glance but his merits.
<P>
"We are both very much indebted to you, sir, for your politeness
in calling," he said, with excessive civility of manner. "But our
stay at this place has drawn to an end. I only came here for the
re-establishment of my daughter's health. She has benefited
greatly by the change of air, and we have arranged to return home
to-morrow. Otherwise, we should have gladly profited by your kind
offer of tickets for the ball."
<P>
Of course I had one eye on the young lady while he was speaking.
She was looking at her father, and a sudden sadness was stealing
over her face. What did it mean? Disappointment at missing the
ball? No, it was a much deeper feeling than that. My interest was
excited. I addressed a complimentary entreaty to the doctor not
to take his daughter away from us. I asked him to reflect on the
irreparable eclipse that he would be casting over the Duskydale
ballroom. To my amazement, she only looked down gloomily on her
work while I spoke; her father laughed contemptuously.
<P>
"We are too completely strangers here," he said, "for our loss to
be felt by any one. From all that I can gather, society in
Duskydale will be glad to hear of our departure. I beg your
pardon, Alicia--I ought to have said <i>my</i> departure."
<P>
Her name was Alicia! I declare it was a luxury to me to hear
it--the name was so appropriate, so suggestive of the grace and
dignity of her beauty.
<P>
I turned toward her when the doctor had done. She looked more
gloomily than before. I protested against the doctor's account of
himself. He laughed again, with a quick distrustful lo ok, this
time, at his daughter.
<P>
"If you were to mention my name among your respectable
inhabitants," he went on, with a strong, sneering emphasis on the
word respectable, "they would most likely purse up their lips and
look grave at it. Since I gave up practice as a physician, I have
engaged in chemical investigations on a large scale, destined I
hope, to lead to some important public results. Until I arrive at
these, I am necessarily obliged, in my own interests, to keep my
experiments secret, and to impose similar discretion on the
workmen whom I employ. This unavoidable appearance of mystery,
and the strictly retired life which my studies compel me to lead,
offend the narrow-minded people in my part of the county, close
to Barkingham; and the unpopularity of my pursuits has followed
me here. The general opinion, I believe, is, that I am seeking by
unholy arts for the philosopher's stone. Plain man, as you see
me, I find myself getting quite the reputation of a Doctor
Faustus in the popular mind. Even educated people in this very
place shake their heads and pity my daughter there for living
with an alchemical parent, within easy smelling-distance of an
explosive laboratory. Excessively absurd, is it not?"
<P>
It might have been excessively absurd, but the lovely Alicia sat
with her eyes on her work, looking as if it were excessively sad,
and not giving her father the faintest answering smile when he
glanced toward her and laughed, as he said his last words. I
could not at all tell what to make of it. The doctor talked of
the social consequences of his chemical inquiries as if he were
living in the middle ages. However, I was far too anxious to see
the charming brown eyes again to ask questions which would be
sure to keep them cast down. So I changed the topic to chemistry
in general; and, to the doctor's evident astonishment and
pleasure, told him of my own early studies in the science.
<P>
This led to the mention of my father, whose reputation had
reached the ears of Doctor Dulcifer. As he told me that, his
daughter looked up--the sun of beauty shone on me again! I
touched next on my high connections, and on Lady Malkinshaw; I
described myself as temporarily banished from home for humorous
caricaturing, and amiable youthful wildness. She was interested;
she smiled--and the sun of beauty shone warmer than ever! I
diverged to general topics, and got brilliant and amusing. She
laughed--the nightingale notes of her merriment bubbled into my
ears caressingly--why could I not shut my eyes and listen to
them? Her color rose; her face grew animated. Poor soul! A little
lively company was but too evidently a rare treat to her. Under
such circumstances, who would not be amusing? If she had said to
me, "Mr. Softly, I like tumbling," I should have made a clown of
myself on the spot. I should have stood on my head (if I could),
and been amply rewarded for the graceful exertion, if the eyes of
Alicia had looked kindly on my elevated heels!
<P>
How long I stayed is more than I can tell. Lunch came up. I eat
and drank, and grew more amusing than ever. When I at last rose
to go, the brown eyes looked on me very kindly, and the doctor
gave me his card.
<P>
"If you don't mind trusting yourself in the clutches of Doctor
Faustus," he said, with a gay smile, "I shall be delighted to see
you if you are ever in the neighborhood of Barkingham."
<P>
I wrung his hand, mentally relinquishing my secretaryship while I
thanked him for the invitation. I put out my hand next to his
daughter, and the dear friendly girl met the advance with the
most charming readiness. She gave me a good, hearty, vigorous,
uncompromising shake. O precious right hand! never did I properly
appreciate your value until that moment.
<P>
Going out with my head in the air, and my senses in the seventh
heaven, I jostled an elderly gentleman passing before the garden
gate. I turned round to apologize; it was my brother in office,
the estimable Treasurer of the Duskydale Institute.
<P>
"I have been half over the town looking after you," he said. "The
Managing Committee, on reflection, consider your plan of
personally soliciting public attendance at the hall to be
compromising the dignity of the Institution, and beg you,
therefore, to abandon it."
<P>
"Very well," said I, "there is no harm done. Thus far, I have
only solicited two persons, Doctor and Miss Dulcifer, in that
delightful little cottage there."
<P>
"You don't mean to say you have asked <i>them</i> to come to the
ball!"
<P>
"To be sure I have. And I am sorry to say they can't accept the
invitation. Why should they not be asked?"
<P>
"Because nobody visits them."
<P>
"And why should nobody visit them?"
<P>
The Treasurer put his arm confidentially through mine, and walked
me on a few steps.
<P>
"In the first place," he said, "Doctor Dulcifer's name is not
down in the Medical List."
<P>
"Some mistake," I suggested, in my off-hand way. "Or some foreign
doctor's degree not recognized by the prejudiced people in
England."
<P>
"In the second place," continued the Treasurer, "we have found
out that he is not visited at Barkingham. Consequently, it would
be the height of imprudence to visit him here."
<P>
"Pooh! pooh! All the nonsense of narrow-minded people, because he
lives a retired life, and is engaged in finding out chemical
secrets which the ignorant public don't know how to appreciate."
<P>
"The shutters are always up in the front top windows of his house
at Barkingham," said the Treasurer, lowering his voice
mysteriously. "I know it from a friend resident near him. The
windows themselves are barred. It is currently reported that the
top of the house, inside, is shut off by iron doors from the
bottom. Workmen are employed there who don't belong to the
neighborhood, who don't drink at the public houses, who only
associate with each other. Unfamiliar smells and noises find
their way outside sometimes. Nobody in the house can be got to
talk. The doctor, as he calls himself, does not even make an
attempt to get into society, does not even try to see company for
the sake of his poor unfortunate daughter. What do you think of
all that?"
<P>
"Think!" I repeated contemptuously; "I think the inhabitants of
Barkingham are the best finders of mares' nests in all England.
The doctor is making important chemical discoveries (the possible
value of which I can appreciate, being chemical myself), and he
is not quite fool enough to expose valuable secrets to the view
of all the world. His laboratory is at the top of the house, and
he wisely shuts it off from the bottom to prevent accidents. He
is one of the best fellows I ever met with, and his daughter is
the loveliest girl in the world. What do you all mean by making
mysteries about nothing? He has given me an invitation to go and
see him. I suppose the next thing you will find out is, that
there is something underhand even in that?"
<P>
"You won't accept the invitation?"
<P>
"I shall, at the very first opportunity; and if you had seen Miss
Alicia, so would you."
<P>
"Don't go. Take my advice and don't go," said the Treasurer,
gravely. "You are a young man. Reputable friends are of
importance to you at the outset of life. I say nothing against
Doctor Dulcifer--he came here as a stranger, and he goes away
again as a stranger--but you can't be sure that his purpose in
asking you so readily to his house is a harmless one. Making a
new acquaintance is always a doubtful speculation; but when a man
is not visited by his respectable neighbors--"
<P>
"Because he doesn't open his shutters," I interposed
sarcastically.
<P>
"Because there are doubts about him and his house which he will
not clear up," retorted the Treasurer. "You can take your own
way. You may turn out right, and we may all be wrong; I can only
say again, it is rash to make doubtful acquaintances. Sooner or
later you are always sure to repent it. In your place I should
certainly not accept the invitation."
<P>
"In my place, my dear sir," I answered, "you would do exactly
what I mean to do."
<P>
The Treasurer took his arm out of mine, and without saying
another word, wished me good-morning.
