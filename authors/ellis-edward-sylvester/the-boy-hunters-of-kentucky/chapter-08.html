<p>All of Jack Gedney’s doubts and misgivings left him for the time
when he caught sight of the cabin of Mr. Burton.  The moment he
stepped into the clearing, where he could be seen, he was greeted
by shouts from Will and George.</p>

<p>"We’ve been waiting more than a half-hour for you," called out
the elder; "what kept you?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t start quite as early as I wanted to, and I was stopped
on the way by a couple of Indians."</p>

<p>Mr. Burton and his wife and daughter, who were within the cabin,
came to the door when they heard this remark, for it was one in
which it was natural that all should feel interest.</p>

<p>Jack followed the other boys into the house, where all sat down,
and the visitor gave an account of his wrestling bout with the
young Wyandot. When he came to relate how he sent the youth flying
over his head, with his legs outspread like those of a frog, and
of the trouncing the parent added to his defeat, every one of
the listeners, including Mrs. Burton, laughed right merrily.</p>

<p>"It was bad enough to be tossed about in that fashion," said
Mr. Burton, "but it was rough on the poor fellow to receive a
whipping on that account."</p>

<p>"I would have given a good deal to see it," said Will who had
been thrown more than once by the doughty Jack.  "I can imagine
how he felt when he went flying over your head, for I’ve been
there myself."</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said Jack, more seriously, "that it might be
that the chief and his boy are not alone in the woods.  You know
that a chief is pretty apt to have his warriors near him."</p>

<p>"More than likely you are right: what of it?" asked Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>The lightness with which this question was asked lessened the
fears of Jack, and even made him ashamed that he was on the point
of expressing them.</p>

<p>Then, too, Mrs. Burton, who was sometimes nervous about her children,
showed no more signs of alarm than did little Ruth, standing by
her side. Jack fairly blushed to recall how much he had been disturbed
by his misgivings.  He looked around at the boys, and asked abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, are you ready, fellows?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and have been for nearly an hour."</p>

<p>"Then let’s be off."</p>

<p>"How long do you think you will be away?" asked Mrs. Burton,
putting her arms around each of her sons, and kissing them "good-bye."</p>

<p>"That depends on many things that can’t be known now," said her
husband, answering for the three.  "I have no doubt they will
spend one night in the woods, and perhaps two.  I prefer that
they should not be away any longer."</p>

<p>"We will not," said his elder boy, "unless something happens
that we can’t think of, and that won’t let us get back."</p>

<p>"I don’t think <em>that</em> is likely; but if you are not here
by the close of the third day from this I shall start to hunt
you up.  Then, if your explanation is not satisfactory, I know
two boys who will be made to dance a war-dance to which that of
the young Wyandot cannot be compared."</p>

<p>All laughed at this remark of the father, and he himself spoke
with a smile; but the young gentlemen concerned knew, all the
same, that it was no laughing matter.  Their parent would carry
out his threat in spirit and letter.</p>

<p>Young George Burton, who was short and stout, carried a blanket
done up in a compact bundle, and strapped to his back, that being
about the only burden of which he was given charge, the other
extras being at the command of his big brother.</p>

<p>You will observe that not one of the boys had a dog with him. 
Jack Gedney had been the owner of a fine hunter, but that had
been killed in a fight with two bears only a month before.  Mr.
Burton had a good animal, but he preferred to keep him at home,
where his intelligence was valuable.  He gave notice of the approach
of strangers in ample time to take all precaution against surprise. 
He was especially useful at night, when the most cautious Indian
would have found it hard to steal up to the cabin without detection.</p>

<p>Besides, the young hunters were in less need of such an animal
than you would think.  During these later days, when the instinct
of the brutes seem to be necessary to the most skilled sportsman,
that man would be foolish who expected much success without one
to help him.  But a hundred years ago game was so plentiful along
the river Ohio that the hunter could do very well without the
aid of a dog.  In the broad stretches of clearing or prairie roamed
droves, numbering many hundreds, of American bison, or buffalo,
as they are wrongly called; while the bears who at that season
of the year were hunting for food, and the deer, wolves, and other
animals, were so numerous that there was no excuse for any one
failing to find them.</p>

<p>Such a buoyant party of young hunters are not likely to linger
long over their farewells.  Within the three minutes following
the warning of Mr. Burton of what would follow if they overstayed
their time all three were out of sight of the cabin.</p>

<p>The direction taken was almost due south where there were many
miles of forest in which some at least of the wild animals had
not yet seen a white man; more than likely many of them had not
met a redskin for if they had done so they would not have been
allowed to live to remember it.</p>

<p>Since there was no path to follow, the boys walked beside each
other. This was because they could talk better than in Indian
file, and three such lads as those I am telling you about could
not have been persuaded to keep still by the offer of several
fortunes in gold.</p>

<p>It surely is unsportsman-like to go hunting in that fashion. 
Not only were they without dogs (for which I have given you a
reason), but they kept together, and talked a great deal, whereas
professional hunters would have separated whenever in the neighbourhood
of game, and taken all pains to steal upon the animals before
the latter could find out their danger.</p>

<p>The boys, however, stepped so softly upon the dry leaves that
the rustling could be heard but a short distance, and they talked
in such low voices that they might have passed close to a camp
of Indians without discovery.</p>

<p>And then, too, no matter how great their interest in what they
said, they were always on the alert. They glanced from side to
side, just as Jack Gedney did when walking along the path between
his home and that of his friends.</p>

<p>For a time the wood was quite open, so that they were able to
travel with little trouble.  Now and then came breaks in their
conversation, caused by the big tree trunks around which they
had to pass.  Then, too, the undergrowth was so dense that they
sometimes involuntarily dropped into Indian file, and advanced
in silence.  In other parts of Kentucky there were long stretches
of cane-brake so close that an Indian has passed within four feet
of the fugitive for whom he was hunting without seeing him.</p>

<p>Young George Burton suffered more than the others from the running
vines, which were not always seen.  Some of these wound along
the ground, like fine wire, and, catching in front of his ankle,
did not break, but threw him forward on his hands and knees. He
had so slight a distance to fall that it did not hurt him, and
he joined the others in laughing over his slips.  But all the
same, it was anything but pleasant.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, here is a path!" called out Will, who was several steps
in advance of the rest.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it means?" said Jack, as he and George hurried
up beside him.</p>

<p>All three, however, quickly saw the explanation. It was a track
made by animals in going to and from one of the "salt licks,"
as they are called, which are quite common in many parts of that
section.</p>

<p>You know how fond animals are of salt.  Well, there are spots
in the country which I am telling you about where the water which
oozes upward through the ground is so salt that, if left alone,
it makes quite a deposit of that mineral.  The wild beasts soon
find it out, and lick the ground, so as to get the salt.  The
spaces sometimes cover hundreds of square feet, where the earth
has been made as smooth as a planed board by the tongues of the
different creatures in their quest for salt.</p>

<p>In some places the salt is so plentiful that the settlers used
to gather there and spend days in getting it ready for domestic
use.  Daniel Boone was once engaged in doing this when he was
captured by Indians, and kept a prisoner for a long time.</p>

<p>From some of the salt licks you might have seen the paths of
wild beasts radiating outward, until, as the animals fell away
from the trails, they were gradually lost in the wilderness.</p>

<p>"We shall be likely to find some game there," was the remark
of Jack, after the three had stood several minutes looking down
at the ground, where the imprints of hoofs and feet were so numerous
that none of them could be identified.</p>

<p>"That’s what we have come into the woods for," replied Will,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, though you know that in Kentucky we are apt to find spots
where there are more wild beasts than we can get along with comfortably." </p>
