<p>There was not a particle of lameness in the movements of Gravity
Gimp as he went through this programme, but his actions were like
those of an athlete.</p>

<p>Catching up the gun of the prostrate Indian, he was off like
a shot, running with the speed of a deer among the trees, and
with great risk, for the darkness was too dense to permit him
to see where he was going.</p>

<p>"Dat ere pertendin' dat I was lame was a stroke ob gen'us," he
muttered, with a huge grin, as he slackened his gait somewhat,
"and, if it hadn't been for dat lameness, I'd been 'sassinated.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if dey did scoop in all de folks," he added,
with a pang of fear, "and if dey does, why Aunt Peggy must go
to buttin' de Injuns ober de same as I done. <em>Sh!</em>"</p>

<p>He listened for sounds of pursuit, but there was none, and he
drew a sigh of relief, hoping that his friends were in as safe
a situation as he.</p>

<p>Gray Panther, chief of the Senecas, conducted his portion of
the programme, as we have already seen, with cunning and skill.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey, Richard Brainerd, Maggie and Eva, Aunt Peggy, and
Habakkuk McEwen were his prisoners, and within five minutes after
they became such they were started, under the charge of the warriors,
for the camp, where Jake Golcher was expecting them.</p>

<p>The hands of the males were tied behind them so securely that
they felt there was no possibility of freeing themselves. Their
weapons were removed, as a matter of course, but no one of the
three females was offered any indignity by the Indians, who were
carrying out the instructions of Jake Golcher himself.</p>

<p>Since the captors did not seem to feel any objection, several
of the whites ventured on a few words. Habakkuk, however, as he
stumbled along over the obstructions at the rear, felt in anything
but a conversational mood, and for a time held his peace.</p>

<p>"These are the most scand'lous purceedings that I ever heard
tell of," ventured Aunt Peggy, in her snappish way.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Fred Godfrey; "it is the most terrible
reverse I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that."</p>

<p>"What do you refer to?"</p>

<p>"That Injin actually tried to kiss me&mdash;didn't you see him?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't aware of it."</p>

<p>"I gave him one slap that he'll remember, I reckon!"</p>

<p>The situation was too solemn for Fred to utter the remark that
would have come to his lip at any other time. He therefore directed
his next words to Maggie, who was close to her father, and holding
the hand of Eva.</p>

<p>"This looks pretty bad, Maggie," said he, in a low voice, "and
it is hard to find we were mistaken, when I was so hopeful that
we had passed all danger."</p>

<p>"So it is, but how many of our friends and neighbors have fared
still more ill!"</p>

<p>"They are to be envied," said Mr. Brainerd, speaking for the
first time, "for their woe is ended, and ours is to come."</p>

<p>"There may be hope," remarked the daughter, though it must be
confessed she saw none; "we must not despair."</p>

<p>"It is well enough to talk about hoping on forever," said her
father, who seemed more dejected than the others, "but every man
that is born must sooner or later reach the hour when hope is
ended: we struck the hour and minute just now."</p>

<p>"I'm disposed to hold out as long as any of you," said Fred Godfrey,
"but I must own that I feel about as you do."</p>

<p>"And so does every one," added Mr. Brainerd, "for the days of
miracles passed long ago; some of our escapes to-day came about
as close to the miraculous as they could well do, and that may
have led us to expect unreasonable things."</p>

<p>At this juncture Gray Panther seemed to think there was too much
conversation going on, and in broken English he ordered all to
keep their tongues still.</p>

<p>No one of the prisoners regretted the command, for it was a dismal
thing to talk when their hearts were so oppressed.</p>

<p>The route they followed was through the wood, that was stony
and rocky, and in the deep shadows it was anything but pleasing
work. The captors kept close to the captives, so as to prevent
any break for freedom on their part.</p>

<p>The distance was not far, but it was not yet passed, when something
took place which caused some alarm, though none of the prisoners
could tell what it was.</p>

<p>One of the Indians in front uttered a peculiar signal, which
caused a halt on the part of every Seneca. Gray Panther hastened
forward.</p>

<p>It was idle for Godfrey to look for any interference in their
behalf, but he did feel, for a few brief seconds, something akin
to such hope.</p>

<p>But Gray Panther speedily returned, and the march was resumed,
with the same stillness and care as before.</p>

<p>What the cause of the interruption was, became known to none
but the Senecas themselves.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the glimmer of a light was seen among the
trees, and as the faces of the party were turned in that direction,
they knew it was the camp-fire that was their destination.</p>

<p>Only a few steps more were passed when the entire party, with
the exception of the African servant, stood in the presence of
Jake Golcher, the Tory.</p>
