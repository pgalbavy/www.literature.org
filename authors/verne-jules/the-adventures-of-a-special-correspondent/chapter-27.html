<P>If ever the expression, &quot;sinking in sight of port,&quot; could be used in its
precise meaning, it evidently can in this case. And I must beg you to excuse me.
But although a ship may sink by the side of the jetty, we must not conclude that
she is lost. That Kinko&apos;s liberty is in danger, providing the intervention of
myself and fellow passengers is of no avail, agreed. But he is alive, and that
is the essential point.</P>
<P>But we must not waste an hour, for if the police is not perfect in China, it
is at least prompt and expeditious. Soon caught, soon hanged&mdash;and it will not do
for them to hang Kinko, even metaphorically.</P>
<P>I offer my arm to Mademoiselle Zinca, and I lead her to my carriage, and we
return rapidly towards the <I>Hotel of the Ten Thousand Dreams</I>.</P>
<P>There I find Major Noltitz and the Caternas, and by a lucky chance young
Pan-Chao, without Dr. Tio-King. Pan-Chao would like nothing better than to be
our interpreter before the Chinese authorities.</P>
<P>And then, before the weeping Zinca, I told my companions all about Kinko, how
he had traveled, how I had made his acquaintance on the journey. I told them
that if he had defrauded the Transasiatic Company it was thanks to this fraud
that he was able to get on to the train at Uzun Ada. And if he had not been in
the train we should all have been engulfed in the abyss of the Tjon valley.</P>
<P>And I enlarged on the facts which I alone knew. I had surprised Faruskiar at
the very moment he was about to accomplish his crime, but it was Kinko who, at
the peril of his life, with coolness and courage superhuman, had thrown on the
coals, hung on to the lever of the safety valves, and stopped the train by
blowing up the engine.</P>
<P>What an explosion there was of exclamatory ohs and ahs when I had finished my
recital, and in a burst of gratitude, somewhat of the theatrical sort, our actor
shouted:</P>
<P>&quot;Hurrah for Kinko! He ought to have a medal!&quot;</P>
<P>Until the Son of Heaven accorded this hero a green dragon of some sort,
Madame Caterna took Zinca&apos;s hand, drew her to her heart and embraced
her&mdash;embraced her without being able to restrain her tears. Just think of a love
story interrupted at the last chapter!</P>
<P>But we must hasten, and as Caterna says, &quot;all on the scene for the fifth&quot;&mdash;the
fifth act, in which dramas generally clear themselves up.</P>
<P>&quot;We must not let this brave fellow suffer!&quot; said Major Noltitz; &quot;we must see
the Grand Transasiatic people, and when they learn the facts they will be the
first to stop the prosecution.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Doubtless,&quot; I said, &quot;for it cannot be denied that Kinko saved the train and
its passengers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To say nothing of the imperial treasure,&quot; added Caterna, &quot;the millions of
his majesty!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing could be truer,&quot; said Pan-Chao. &quot;Unfortunately Kinko has fallen into
the hands of the police, and they have taken him to prison, and it is not easy
to get out of a Chinese prison.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us be off,&quot; I replied, &quot;and see the company.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;See here,&quot; said Madame Caterna, &quot;is there any need of a subscription to
defray the cost of the affair?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The proposal does you honor, Caroline,&quot; said the actor, putting his hand in
his pocket.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said pretty Zinca Klork, her eyes bathed in tears, &quot;do save him
before he is sentenced&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my darling,&quot; said Madame Caterna, &quot;yes, my heart, we will save your
sweetheart for you, and if a benefit performance&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bravo, Caroline, bravo!&quot; exclaimed Caterna, applauding with the vigor of the
sub-chief of the claque.</P>
<P>We left the young Roumanian to the caresses, as exaggerated as they were
sincere, of the worthy actress. Madame Caterna would not leave her, declaring
that she looked upon her as her daughter, that she would protect her like a
mother. Then Pan-Chao, Major Noltitz, Caterna, and I went off to the company&apos;s
offices at the station.</P>
<P>The manager was in his office, and we were admitted.</P>
<P>He was a Chinese in every acceptation of the word, and capable of every
administrative Chinesery&mdash;a functionary who functioned in a way that would have
moved his colleagues in old Europe to envy.</P>
<P>Pan-Chao told the story, and, as he understood Russian, the major and I took
part in the discussion.</P>
<P>Yes! There was a discussion. This unmistakable Chinaman did not hesitate to
contend that Kinko&apos;s case was a most serious one. A fraud undertaken on such
conditions, a fraud extending over six thousand kilometres, a fraud of a
thousand francs on the Grand Transasiatic Company and its agents.</P>
<P>We replied to this Chinesing Chinee that it was all very true, but that the
damage had been inconsiderable, that if the defrauder had not been in the train
he could not have saved it at the risk of his life, and at the same time he
could not have saved the lives of the passengers.</P>
<P>Well, would you believe it? This living China figure gave us to understand
that from a certain point of view it would have been better to regret the deaths
of a hundred victims&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes! We knew that! Perish the colonies and all the passengers rather than a
principle!</P>
<P>In short, we got nothing. Justice must take its course against the fraudulent
Kinko.</P>
<P>We retired while Caterna poured out all the locutions in his marine and
theatrical vocabulary.</P>
<P>What was to be done?</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Pan-Chao, &quot;I know how things are managed in Pekin and the
Celestial Empire. Two hours will not elapse from the time Kinko is arrested to
the time he is brought before the judge charged with this sort of crime. He will
not only be sent to prison, but the bastinado&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The bastinado&mdash;like that idiot Zizel in <I>Si j&apos;etais Roi?&quot;</I> asked the
actor.</P>
<P>&quot;Precisely,&quot; replied Pan-Chao.</P>
<P>&quot;We must stop that abomination,&quot; said Major Noltitz.</P>
<P>&quot;We can try at the least,&quot; said Pan-Chao. &quot;I propose we go before the court
when I will try and defend the sweetheart of this charming Roumanian, and may I
lose my face if I do not get him off.&quot;</P>
<P>That was the best, the only thing to do. We left the station, invaded a
vehicle, and arrived in twenty minutes before a shabby-looking shanty, where the
court was held.</P>
<P>There was a crowd. The affair had got abroad. It was known that a swindler
had come in a box in a Grand Transasiatic van free, gratis, and for nothing from
Tiflis to Pekin. Every one wished to see him; every one wanted to recognize the
features of this genius&mdash;it was not yet known that he was a hero.</P>
<P>There he is, our brave companion, between two rascally looking policemen,
yellow as quinces. These fellows are ready to walk him off to prison at the
judge&apos;s order, and to give him a few dozen strokes on the soles of his feet if
he is condemned to that punishment.</P>
<P>Kinko is thoroughly disheartened, which astonishes me on the part of one I
know to be so energetic. But as soon as he sees us his face betrays a ray of
hope.</P>
<P>At this moment the carter, brought forward by the police, relates the affair
to a good sort of fellow in spectacles, who shakes his head in anything but a
hopeful way for the prisoner, who, even if he were as innocent as a new-born
child, could not defend himself, inasmuch as he did not know Chinese.</P>
<P>Then it is that Pan-Chao presents himself. The judge recognized him and
smiled. In fact, our companion was the son of a rich merchant in Pekin, a tea
merchant in the Toung-Tien and Soung-Fong-Cao trade. And these nods of the
judge&apos;s head became more sympathetically significant.</P>
<P>Our young advocate was really pathetic and amusing. He interested the judge,
he excited the audience with the story of the journey, he told them all about
it, and finally he offered to pay the company what was due to them.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the judge could not consent. There had been material damages,
moral damages, etc., etc.</P>
<P>Thereupon Pan-Chao became animated, and although we understood nothing he
said, we guessed that he was speaking of the courage of Kinko, of the sacrifice
he had made for the safety of the travelers, and finally, as a supreme argument,
he pleaded that his client had saved the imperial treasure.</P>
<P>Useless eloquence? Arguments were of no avail with this pitiless magistrate,
who had not acquitted ten prisoners in is life. He spared the delinquent the
bastinado; but he gave him six months in prison, and condemned him in damages
against the Grand Transasiatic Company. And then at a sign from this condemning
machine poor Kinko was taken away.</P>
<P>Let not my readers pity Kinko&apos;s fate. I may as well say at once that
everything was arranged satisfactorily.</P>
<P>Next morning Kinko made a triumphal entry into the house in the Avenue
Cha-Coua, where we were assembled, while Madame Caterna was showering her
maternal consolations on the unhappy Zinca Klork.</P>
<P>The newspapers had got wind of the affair. The <I>Chi Bao</I> of Pekin and
the <I>Chinese Times</I> of Tien-Tsin had demanded mercy for the young
Roumanian. These cries for mercy had reached the feet of the Son of Heaven&mdash;the
very spot where the imperial ears are placed. Besides, Pan-Chao had sent to his
majesty a petition relating the incidents of the journey, and insisting on the
point that had it not been for Kinko&apos;s devotion, the gold and precious stones
would be in the hands of Faruskiar and his bandits. And, by Buddha! that was
worth something else than six months in prison.</P>
<P>Yes! It was worth 15,000 taels, that is to say, more than 100,000 francs, and
in a fit of generosity the Son of Heaven remitted these to Kinko with the
remittal of his sentence.</P>
<P>I decline to depict the joy, the happiness, the intoxication which this news
brought by Kinko in person, gave to all his friends, and particularly to the
fair Zinca Klork. These things are expressible in no language&mdash;not even in
Chinese, which lends itself so generously to the metaphorical.</P>
<P>And now my readers must permit me to finish with my traveling companions
whose numbers have figured in my note-book.</P>
<P>Nos. 1 and 2, Fulk Ephrinell and Miss Horatia Bluett: not being able to agree
regarding the various items stipulated in their matrimonial contract, they were
divorced three days after their arrival in Pekin. Things were as though the
marriage had never been celebrated on the Grand Transasiatic, and Miss Horatia
Bluett remained Miss Horatia Bluett. May she gather cargoes of heads of hair
from Chinese polls; and may he furnish with artificial teeth every jaw in the
Celestial Empire!</P>
<P>No. 3, Major Noltitz: he is busy at the hospital he has come to establish at
Pekin on behalf of the Russian government, and when the hour for separation
strikes, I feel that I shall leave a true friend behind me in these distant
lands.</P>
<P>Nos. 4 and 5, the Caternas: after a stay of three weeks in the capital of the
Celestial Empire, the charming actor and actress set out for Shanghai, where
they are now the great attraction at the French Residency.</P>
<P>No. 6, Baron Weissschnitzerdörfer, whose incommensurable name I write for the
last time: well, not only did the globe-trotter miss the steamer at Tien-Tsin,
but a month later he missed it at Yokohama; six weeks after that he was
shipwrecked on the coast of British Columbia, and then, after being thrown off
the line between San Francisco and New York, he managed to complete his round of
the world in a hundred and eighty-seven days instead of thirty-nine.</P>
<P>Nos. 9 and 10, Pan-Chao and Dr. Tio-King: what can I say except that Pan-Chao
is always the Parisian you know, and that if he comes to France we shall meet at
dinner at Durand&apos;s or Marguery&apos;s. As to the doctor, he has got down to eating
only the yolk of an egg a day, like his master, Cornaro, and he hopes to live to
a hundred and two as did the noble Venetian.</P>
<P>No. 8, Sir Francis Trevellyan, and No. 12, Seigneur Faruskiar: I have never
heard of the one who owes me an apology and a cigar, nor have I heard that the
other has been hanged. Doubtless, the illustrious bandit, having sent in his
resignation of the general managership of the Grand Transasiatic, continues his
lucrative career in the depths of the Mongol provinces.</P>
<P>Now for Kinko, my No. 11: I need hardly say that my No. 11 was married to
Zinca Klork with great ceremony. We were all at the wedding, and if the Son of
Heaven had richly endowed the young Roumanian, his wife received a magnificent
present in the name of the passengers of the train he had saved.</P>
<P>That is the faithful story of this journey. I have done my best to do my duty
as special correspondent all down the line, and perhaps my editors may be
satisfied, notwithstanding the slip or two you have heard about.</P>
<P>As to me, after spending three weeks in Pekin, I returned to France by
sea.</P>
<P>And now I have to make a confession, which is very painful to my self-esteem.
The morning after I arrived in the Chinese capital I received a telegram thus
worded, in reply to the one I had sent from Lan-Tcheou:</P>
<P
align=center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Claudius
Bombarnac,<BR></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pekin,
China.</I></P>
<P><I>Twentieth Century requests its correspondent, Claudius Bombarnac, to
present its compliments and respects to the heroic Seigneur Faruskiar</I>.</P>
<P>But I always say that this telegram never reached him, so that he has been
spared the unpleasantness of having to reply to it.</P>
