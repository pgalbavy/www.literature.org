<P>The blow had been the more painful on account of its being
unexpected. It was some time before the marquise recovered
herself; but once recovered, she began to reflect upon the
events so heartlessly announced to her. She therefore
returned, at the risk even of losing her life in the way, to
that train of ideas which her relentless friend had forced
her to pursue. Treason, then  -  deep menaces, concealed
under the semblance of public interest  -  such were
Colbert's maneuvers. A detestable delight at an approaching
downfall, untiring efforts to attain this object, means of
seduction no less wicked than the crime itself  -  such were
the weapons Marguerite employed. The crooked atoms of
Descartes triumphed; to the man without compassion was
united a woman without heart. The marquise perceived, with
sorrow rather than indignation, that the king was an
accomplice in the plot which betrayed the duplicity of Louis
XIII. in his advanced age, and the avarice of Mazarin at a
period of life when he had not had the opportunity of
gorging himself with French gold. The spirit of thus
courageous woman soon resumed its energy, no longer
overwhelmed by indulgence in compassionate lamentations. The
marquise was not one to weep when action was necessary, nor
to waste time in bewailing a misfortune as long as means
still existed of relieving it. For some minutes she buried
her face in her cold fingers, and then, raising her head,
rang for her attendants with a steady hand, and with a
gesture betraying a fixed determination of purpose. Her
resolution was taken.</P>
<P>&quot;Is everything prepared for my departure?&quot; she inquired of
one of her female attendants who entered.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame; but it was not expected that your ladyship
would leave for Belliere for the next few days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All my jewels and articles of value, then, are packed up?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame; but hitherto we have been in the habit of
leaving them in Paris. Your ladyship does not generally take
your jewels with you into the country.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But they are all in order, you say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, in your ladyship's own room.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The gold plate?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the chest.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And the silver plate?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In the great oak closet.&quot;</P>
<P>The marquise remained silent for a few moments, and then
said calmly, &quot;Let my goldsmith be sent for.&quot;</P>
<P>Her attendants quitted the room to execute the order. The
marquise, however, had entered her own room, and was
inspecting her casket of jewels with the greatest attention.
Never, until now, had she bestowed such close attention upon
riches in which women take so much pride; never, until now,
had she looked at her jewels except for the purpose of
making a selection, according to their settings or their
colors. On this occasion, however, she admired the size of
the rubies and the brilliancy of the diamonds; she grieved
over every blemish and every defect; she thought the gold
light, and the stones wretched. The goldsmith, as he
entered, found her thus occupied. &quot;M. Faucheux &quot; she said,
&quot;I believe you supplied me with my gold service?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I did, your ladyship.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not now remember the amount of the account.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of the new service, madame, or of that which M. de Belliere
presented to you on your marriage? for I have furnished
both.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;First of all, the new one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The covers, the goblets, and the dishes, with their covers,
the eau-epergne, the ice-pails, the dishes for the
preserves, and the tea and coffee urns, cost your ladyship
sixty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No more?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your ladyship thought the account very high.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes; I remember, in fact, that it was dear; but it was
the workmanship, I suppose?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame; the designs, the chasings  -  all new
patterns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What proportion of the cost does the workmanship form? Do
not hesitate to tell me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A third of its value, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is the other service, the old one, that which
belonged to my husband?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame; there is less workmanship in that than in the
other. Its intrinsic value does not exceed thirty thousand
francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thirty thousand,&quot; murmured the marquise. &quot;But, M. Faucheux,
there is also the service which belonged to my mother; all
that massive plate which I did not wish to part with, on
account of the associations connected with it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! madame, that would indeed be an excellent resource for
those who, unlike your ladyship, might not be in a position
to keep their plate. In chasing that they worked in solid
metal. But that service is no longer in fashion. Its weight
is its only advantage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is all I care about. How much does it weigh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fifty thousand livres at the very least. I do not allude to
the enormous vases for the buffet, which alone weigh five
thousand livres, or ten thousand the pair.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One hundred and thirty,&quot; murmured the marquise. &quot;You are
quite sure of your figures, M. Faucheux?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Positive, madame. Besides, there is no difficulty in
weighing them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The amount is entered in my books.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your ladyship is extremely methodical, I am aware.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us now turn to another subject,&quot; said Madame de,
Belliere; and she opened one of her jewel-boxes.</P>
<P>&quot;I recognize these emeralds,&quot; said M. Faucheux; &quot;for it was
I who had the setting of them. They are the most beautiful
in the whole court. No, I am mistaken; Madame de Chatillon
has the most beautiful set; she had them from Messieurs de
Guise; but your set madame, comes next.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What are they worth?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mounted?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No; supposing I wished to sell them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know very well who would buy them,&quot; exclaimed M.
Faucheux.</P>
<P>&quot;That is the very thing I ask. They could be sold, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All your jewels could be sold, madame. It is well known
that you possess the most beautiful jewels in Paris. You are
not changeable in your tastes; when you make a purchase it
is of the very best; and what you purchase you do not part
with.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What could these emeralds be sold for, then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A hundred and thirty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>The marquise wrote down upon her tablets the amount which
the jeweler mentioned. &quot;The ruby necklace?&quot; she said.</P>
<P>&quot;Are they balas-rubies, madame?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Here they are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They are beautiful  -  magnificent. I did not know that your
ladyship had these stones.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is their value?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Two hundred thousand francs. The center one is alone worth
a hundred thousand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought so,&quot; said the marquise. &quot;As for diamonds, I have
them in numbers; rings, necklaces, sprigs, earrings, clasps.
Tell me their value, M. Faucheux.&quot;</P>
<P>The jeweler took his magnifying-glass and scales, weighed
and inspected them, and silently made his calculations.
&quot;These stones,&quot; he said, &quot;must have cost your ladyship an
income of forty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You value them at eight hundred thousand francs?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nearly so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is about what I imagined  - -but the settings are not
included?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, madame; but if I were called upon to sell or to buy, I
should be satisfied with the gold of the settings alone as
my profit upon the transaction. I should make a good
twenty-five thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;An agreeable sum.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very much so, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will you accept that profit, then, on condition of
converting the jewels into money?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But you do not intend to sell your diamonds, I suppose,
madame?&quot; exclaimed the bewildered jeweler.</P>
<P>&quot;Silence, M. Faucheux, do not disturb yourself about that;
give me an answer simply. You are an honorable man, with
whom my family has dealt for thirty years; you knew my
father and mother, whom your own father and mother served. I
address you as a friend; will you accept the gold of the
settings in return for a sum of ready money to be placed in
my hands?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Eight hundred thousand francs! it is enormous.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impossible to find.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But reflect, madame, upon the effect which will be produced
by the sale of your jewels.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No one need know it. You can get sets of false jewels made
for me, similar to the real. Do not answer a word; I insist
upon it. Sell them separately, sell the stones only.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In that way it is easy. Monsieur is looking out for some
sets of jewels as well as single stones for Madame's
toilette. There will be a competition for them. I can easily
dispose of six hundred thousand francs' worth to Monsieur. I
am certain yours are the most beautiful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When can you do so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In less than three days' time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, the remainder you will dispose of among private
individuals. For the present, make me out a contract of
sale, payment to be made in four days.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I entreat you to reflect, madame; for if you force the
sale, you will lose a hundred thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If necessary, I will lose two hundred; I wish everything to
be settled this evening. Do you accept?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do, your ladyship. I will not conceal from you that I
shall make fifty thousand francs by the transaction.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the better for you. In what way shall I have the
money?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Either in gold, or in bills of the bank of Lyons, payable
at M. Colbert's.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I agree,&quot; said the marquise, eagerly; &quot;return home and
bring the sum in question in notes, as soon as possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame, but for Heaven's sake  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not a word, M. Faucheux. By the by, I was forgetting the
silver plate. What is the value of that which I have?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fifty thousand francs, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That makes a million,&quot; said the marquise to herself. &quot;M.
Faucheux, you will take away with you both the gold and
silver plate. I can assign, as a pretext, that I wish it
remodelled on patterns more in accordance with my own taste.
Melt it down, and return me its value in money, at once.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It shall be done, your ladyship.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will be good enough to place the money in a chest, and
direct one of your clerks to accompany the chest, and
without my servants seeing him; and order him to wait for me
in a carriage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In Madame de Faucheux's carriage?&quot; said the jeweler.</P>
<P>&quot;If you will allow it, and I will call for it at your
house.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, your ladyship.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will direct some of my servants to convey the plate to
your house.&quot; The marquise rung. &quot;Let the small van be placed
at M. Faucheux's disposal,&quot; she said. The jeweler bowed and
left the house, directing that the van should follow him
closely, saying aloud that the marquise was about to have
her plate melted down in order to have other plate
manufactured of a more modern style. Three hours afterwards
she went to M. Faucheux's house and received from him eight
hundred thousand francs in gold inclosed in a chest, which
one of the clerks could hardly carry towards Madame
Faucheux's carriage  -  for Madame Faucheux kept her
carriage. As the daughter of a president of accounts, she
had brought a marriage portion of thirty thousand crowns to
her husband, who was syndic of the goldsmiths. These thirty
thousand crowns had become very fruitful during twenty
years. The jeweler, though a millionaire, was a modest man.
He had purchased a substantial carriage, built in 1648, ten
years after the king's birth. This carriage, or rather house
upon wheels, excited the admiration of the whole quarter in
which he resided  -  it was covered with allegorical
paintings, and clouds scattered over with stars. The
marquise entered this somewhat extraordinary vehicle,
sitting opposite the clerk, who endeavored to put his knees
out of the way, afraid even of touching the marquise's
dress. It was the clerk, too, who told the coachman, who was
very proud of having a marquise to drive, to take the road
to Saint-Mande.</P></div>
