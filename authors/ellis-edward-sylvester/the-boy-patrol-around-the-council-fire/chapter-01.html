<p>You will recall that one day in a recent August, Jack Crandall,
a member of the Stag Patrol of Boy Scouts, who with the Blazing
Arrow and Eagle Patrols was spending the summer vacation on the
shore of Gosling Lake, in Southern Maine, met with a serious accident.
In climbing a tall pine to inspect a bird’s nest, he fell to the
ground and broke his leg. His companions, Gerald Hume and Arthur
Mitchell, belonging to the same Patrol, made a litter upon which
he was carried to the clubhouse. Dr. Spellman, staying with his
wife and little daughter Ruth, christened "Sunbeam" by Mike Murphy,
in answer to a signal, paddled across the lake in his canoe, set
the fractured limb and did all that was necessary.</p>

<p>Jack was an athlete, in rugged health and with no bad habits.
He, therefore, recovered rapidly. After spending a few days on
his couch, he was carried to the front porch, where in the cool
shade and reposing upon an invalid chair, especially fashioned
for the occasion, he feasted his eyes upon the delightful scenery
and enjoyed the pleasures of his friends although he could not
take part. He insisted that they should pay no special attention
to him, though there was not a boy who would not have gladly kept
him company all the time. A reunion of the troop took place in
the evening, when he was carried inside, listened to the reports
and took part in the conversation which you may be sure was of
a lively nature.</p>

<p>Thus the days passed until the arrival of the silver mounted
maple wood crutches, a gift from the other Scouts, and Jack swung
carefully out on the porch and walked the length of it several
times before sinking down in the waiting chair. This, of course,
did not take place until the month was well by and the time for
going home near. I thought it best to close my previous story
with this glimpse of things, but it now becomes my duty to turn
back and relate some incidents that occurred during the first
days of the patient’s convalescence, since they have to do with
what follows.</p>

<p>Dr. Spellman and his wife returned to the bungalow on the day
succeeding Jack’s mishap.</p>

<p>Scout Master Hall and several of the lads expressed their surprise
that no call had been made by Uncle Elk, the Hermit of the Woods,
who showed so much fondness for the Boy Scouts that they expected
to see him every day, provided the weather was favorable.</p>

<p>"I am sure he would have been here last night or this morning,
had he known of Jack’s misfortune," said Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>"If ye have no ’bjection I’ll drop in on him and let him know,"
replied Mike Murphy, whose heart was as sympathetic as that of
a young child.</p>

<p>"Please do so."</p>

<p>Mike glanced around for his chums, Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes,
but they were not in sight. It did not matter and he decided to
make the trip alone, using one of the canoes to take him to the
end of the lake, where he would follow the path that led to the
cabin through the woods.</p>

<p>"On me way back," remarked Mike to the Scout Master, who walked
with him to the water’s edge, "I’ll drop in to larn how Sunbeam
is getting on."</p>

<p>The Scout Master smiled.</p>

<p>"That will take you considerably out of your way."</p>

<p>"It’s not worth the mintion, as Ball O’Flaherty said whin he
fell off the church steeple and broke his neck. Then ye know it’s
a long time since I saw Sunbeam."</p>

<p>"Yes,—less than a day."</p>

<p>So the Irish youth seated himself in the stern of the graceful
craft, and swung the paddle with creditable skill. No task could
have been easier, and he grinned with satisfaction, as keeping
close to shore, he watched the trees with their exuberant foliage
glide silently backward.</p>

<p>"A canoe is a blissed boon to byes that can’t walk; we might
set Jack in one of ’em, and he could paddle wherever he wished.
I’m going to suggist to me friends that whin they go back home,
each of ’em has a canoe mounted on wheels, so he can roam round
the country, the same as if he’s skimming over the water as I’m
doing this minute. I’d try it mesilf whin I get back, but dad
would objict and there’s so much water there I don’t naad anything
of the kind."</p>

<p>Far over to the left, he saw the other canoe handled by several
of the Scouts, while somewhat nearer and a little way back from
the water, a thin, feathery finger of smoke filtering through
the tree tops showed where Dr. Spellman’s house stood.</p>

<p>"Sunbeam has been gone so long that I’m worrit less something
may have happened to her; I won’t tarry at Uncle Elk’s, but make
haste to relave me mind as regards the Quaan."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk’s canoe was drawn up the bank and turned over. Landing
near it, Mike followed the winding path to the door from which
the latch string hung, pulled it and stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Uncle Elk," was his greeting as he closed the
door behind him.</p>

<p>The hermit was sitting in his rocking chair, reading "The Truth
of Religion," by Rudolf Eucken, Professor of Philosophy in the
University of Jena and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1908. The old man laid aside the heavy volume, still open,
face downward.</p>

<p>"Michael, I’m glad to see you."</p>

<p>He leaned forward, shook hands and motioned the youth to the
chair opposite. Mike obeyed with the remark:</p>

<p>"We have been expecting a call from ye, Uncle Elk."</p>

<p>"You don’t wish me to bore you with too much of my presence,"
said the hermit, with a twinkle of his bright eyes.</p>

<p>"That’s something that can’t be done, if ye tried it till ye
were an old man," replied Mike warmly. And then told of the mishap
that had befallen Jack Crandall. Uncle Elk listened sympathetically.</p>

<p>"That’s bad, but it might have been much worse."</p>

<p>"Which Jack himself has obsarved,—for instance, ’spose it had
been <em>mesilf</em>."</p>

<p>"That surely would have been worse for <em>you</em>, but better
for him. You say that Dr. Spellman set his injured leg?"</p>

<p>"That he did, and I couldn’t have done it better mesilf. He called
this morning and said the spalpeen was doing splendid."</p>

<p>"When will the doctor call again?"</p>

<p>"I’m not sartin,—but likely tomorrer."</p>

<p>"Forenoon or afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I couldn’t say."</p>

<p>Uncle Elk withdrew his gaze from the face of the lad and looked
into the fireplace, where only a few dying embers showed. He was
silent for a few moments and then addressed his caller.</p>

<p>"Michael," he said in low tones, "I shall call upon Jack at the
earliest opportunity, but my call must be timed so there will
be no possibility of meeting Dr. Spellman."</p>

<p>Mike was amazed by the words and at a loss what to say. Therefore
he said what after all was perhaps the best thing.</p>

<p>"I’ll see that the doctor doesn’t try any expirimints on ye."</p>

<p>The old man actually laughed, but only for an instant. With a
shake of his head he said:</p>

<p>"It isn’t that, Michael, but he and I must never meet."</p>

<p>The youth was astounded, but his sense of propriety forbade any
questioning. If Uncle Elk did not choose to make known the cause
of his strange enmity, Mike had no right to object.</p>

<p>A strained silence followed for a minute or two, when the hermit
again looked meditatively into the smouldering embers.</p>

<p>"It can be easily arranged: let Dr. Spellman make his calls at
such times as suit his convenience and I will adjust mine accordingly."</p>

<p>"That should be aisy. I hev it!"</p>

<p>"Let me hear your plan."</p>

<p>"’Spose the doctor makes it a rule to call ivery other day and
ye can fit yer visits in betwaan, though we should like it to
be oftener."</p>

<p>"That would hardly answer, for he might be needed every day.
A better plan will be that he should never call at the bungalow
during the evening. If he agrees to that, everything will be right."</p>

<p>"That’ll doot! He wouldn’t come anyway unless we signalled him,
and if ye happen to be at the clubhouse, ye’ll have plinty of
time to run."</p>

<p>"How am I to know that he consents to it?"</p>

<p>"If he objicts, I’ll come back and tell ye; if he agraas, I won’t
show up here agin till after ye have visited us."</p>

<p>"That settles the matter. I suppose, Michael, you are wondering
why I make such a strange request?"</p>

<p>"I am, but I’m not asking any quistions, as ye’ll obsarve."</p>

<p>"Well, you will never learn from me."</p>

<p>Mike was slightly nettled.</p>

<p>"Why thin did ye think it worth while to raise me hopes, whin
I hadn’t made any inquiries?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Michael; I shouldn’t have done it. Let neither
of us refer to it again."</p>

<p>"Do ye wish me to till Docther Spellman what ye said?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Then consider that I’ve told him."</p>

<p>"It would be hard for him to understand my request unless he
knew my feelings. You may as well stay to supper and over night
with me."</p>

<p>"I thank ye, Uncle Elk, but I much fear that if I don’t return
to the byes they’ll think I’ve tumbled out of a tree the same
as Jack, and have broke me neck. I’ll bid ye good afternoon and
make me way to Docther Spelhnan. Onless ye hear from me to the
contrary, ye’ll understand that he’ll not visit the bungalow on
any avening onless he is sent fur, so the way will be open to
yersilf."</p>

<p>The hermit rose from his chair and stood in the door as Mike
walked down the path to the side of the lake. He looked round
just before passing out of sight and waved his hand to the old
man, who nodded.</p>

<p>"It’s mighty qu’ar," mused the lad, as he shoved off in his canoe;
"the docther has niver said a word as far as I’ve heerd about
any throuble between ’em, and I couldn’t guess what it is to save
me life."</p>

<p>The bright, sunshiny afternoon was well advanced when Mike paddled
a little way from shore and turned in the direction of the thin
wisp of smoke which revealed the location of the physician’s summer
home. Almost beyond sight could be made out the second canoe,
which some of the Scouts had used in making an excursion over
the sheet of water. The craft was close in shore and seemed to
be motionless, as if the boys were fishing. The distance was too
far for him to tell the number of occupants, but he judged they
were three or four.</p>

<p>"And I belave Alvin and Chester are among ’em," he added, after
a scrutiny of the boat; "I mind me now that they said something
about going off to-day on a cruise. Hello!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by an unexpected discovery. Between
him and the home of the physician he saw a second spiral of vapor
climbing up among the treetops. Like that of the former, it was
so far back from the water that nothing could be seen of the party
that had kindled it.</p>

<p>Mike held his paddle motionless while he looked and thought.</p>

<p>"They must be strangers to the rist of us. If this thing kaaps
up, bime by we sha’n’t have elbow room and will have to camp farther
inland. I wonder now if they could be some other Boy Patrols that
have strayed in here. They may have heerd of us and desire to
make me acquaintance, as do most people."</p>

<p>Mike had his natural share of curiosity, and decided to learn
who the strangers were. He had enough time at command to permit
a diversion of this nature, and he headed his craft toward the
bank at a point opposite the dim wavering column of vapor which
showed that a fire kindled beneath was the cause. </p>
