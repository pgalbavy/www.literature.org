<p>She halted at the portal of an old-fashioned house which had
been turned into an apartment hotel&mdash;a great brownstone mansion
set back from the street. A severely respectable porter in livery
appeared and bowed to her, but when his apoplectic eyes encountered
Seabury's his shaven jaw dropped and a curious spasm appeared
to affect his knees.</p>

<p>She did not notice it; she turned to Seabury and, looking him
straight in the face, held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said. "Be chivalrous enough to find out who
I am&mdash;without sacrificing me.... You&mdash;you have not displeased
me."</p>

<p>He took her hand, held it a moment, then released it.</p>

<p>"I live here," he said calmly.</p>

<p>A trifle disconcerted, she searched his face. "That is curious,"
she said uneasily.</p>

<p>"Oh, not very. I have bachelor apartments here; I've been away
from town for three months. Here is my pass-key," he added, laughing,
and to the strangely paralyzed porter he tossed his luggage with
a nod and a pleasant: "You didn't expect me for another month,
William, did you?"</p>

<p>"That explains it," she said smiling, a tint of excitement in
her pretty cheeks. "I've been here only for a day or two."</p>

<p>They were entering now, side by side; he followed her into the
elevator. The little red-haired boy, all over freckles and gilt
buttons, who presided within the cage, gaped in a sort of stupor
when he saw Seabury.</p>

<p>"Well, Tommy," inquired that young gentleman, "what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"What floor?" stammered Tommy, gazing wildly from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"The usual one, in my case," said Seabury, surprised.</p>

<p>"The usual one, in my case," said the girl, looking curiously
at the agitated lad. The cage shot up to the third floor; they
both rose, and he handed her out. Before either could turn the
elevator hurriedly dropped, leaving them standing there together.
Then, to the consternation of Seabury, the girl quietly rang at
one of the only two apartments on the floor, and the next instant
a rather smart-looking English maid opened the door.</p>

<p>Seabury stared; he turned and examined the corridor; he saw the
number on the door of the elevator shaft; he saw the number over
the door.</p>

<p>"There seems to be," he began slowly, "something alarming the
matter with me to-night. I suppose &mdash;I suppose it's approaching
dementia, but do you know that I have a delusion that this apartment
is mine?"</p>

<p>"Yours!" faltered the girl, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it was once&mdash;before I left town. Either that or incipient
lunacy explains my hallucination."</p>

<p>The maid stood at the door gazing at him in undisguised astonishment.
Her pretty mistress looked at her, looked at Seabury, turned and
cast an agitated glance along the corridor&mdash;just in time to catch
a glimpse of the curly black whiskers and the white and ghastly
face of the proprietor peering at them around the corner. Whiskers
and pallor instantly vanished. She looked at Seabury.</p>

<p>"Please come in a moment, Mr. Seabury," she said calmly. He followed
her into the familiar room decorated with his own furniture, and
lined with his own books, hung with his own pictures. At a gesture
from her he seated himself in his own armchair; she sat limply
in a chair facing him.</p>

<p>"Are these your rooms?" she asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I thought so, once. Probably there's something the matter with
me."</p>

<p>"You did not desire to rent them furnished during your absence?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"And you have returned a month before they expected you, and
<em>I&mdash;</em>oh, this is infamous!" she cried, clenching her white
hands. "How dared that wretched man rent this place to me? How
dared he!"</p>

<p>A long and stunning silence fell upon them&mdash;participated in by
the British maid.</p>

<p>Then Seabury began to laugh. He looked at the maid, he looked
at her angry and very lovely young mistress, looked at the tables
littered with typewriters and stationery, he caught sight of his
own dining-room with the little table laid for two. His gayety
disconcerted her&mdash;he rose, paced the room and returned.</p>

<p>"It seems my landlord has tried to turn a thrifty penny by leasing
you my rooms!" he said, soberly. "Is that it?"</p>

<p>She was close to tears, controlling her voice and keeping her
self-possession with a visible effort. "I &mdash;I am treasurer
and secretary for the new wing to&mdash;to St. Berold's Hospital,"
she managed to say. "We&mdash;the women interested, needed an office&mdash;we
employ several typewriters, and&mdash;oh, goodness! What on earth will
your sister think!"</p>

<p>"My sister? Why, she's at Seal Harbor&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Your sister was there visiting my mother. I came on to town
to see our architects; I wired her to come. She&mdash;she was to dine
with me here to-night! Sherry was notified!"</p>

<p>"My sister?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. What on earth did she think when she found me installed
in your rooms? And that's bad enough, but I invited her to dine
and go over the hospital matters&mdash;she's one of the vice presidents&mdash;and
then&mdash;then you tied our feet together and it's&mdash;what time is it?"
she demanded of her maid.</p>

<p>"It is midnight, mem," replied the maid in sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>"Is that man from Sherry's still there?"</p>

<p>"He is, mem."</p>

<p>Her mistress laid her charming head in her hands and covered
her agreeable features with a handkerchief of delicate and rather
valuable lace.</p>

<p>The silence at last was broken by Seabury addressing the maid:
"Is that dinner spoiled?"</p>

<p>"Quite, sir."</p>

<p>Her mistress looked up hastily: "Mr. Seabury, you are not going
to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am; this is the time and the place!" And he rose with
decision and walked straight to the kitchen, where a stony-faced
individual sat amid the culinary ruins, a statue of despair.</p>

<p>"What I want you to do," said Seabury, "is to fix up a salad
and some of the cold duck, and attend to the champagne. Meanwhile
I think I'll go downstairs; I have an engagement to kill a man."</p>

<p>However, a moment later he thought better of it; <em>she</em>
was standing by the mirror&mdash;his own mirror&mdash;touching her eyes
with her lace handkerchief and patting her hair with the prettiest,
whitest hands.</p>

<p>"Kill him? Never: I'll canonize him!" muttered Seabury, enchanted.
Behind him he heard the clink of glass and china, the pleasant
sound of ice. She heard it, too, and turned.</p>

<p>"Of all the audacity!" she said in a low voice, looking at him
under her level brows. But there was something in her eyes that
gave him courage&mdash;and in his that gave her courage.... Besides,
they were dreadfully hungry.</p>

<p>"You refuse to tell me?"</p>

<p>"I do," she said. "If you have not wit enough to find out my
name without betraying me to your sister you do not deserve to
know my name&mdash;or me."</p>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock, they had risen, and the gay little
flowery table remained between them; the salad and duck were all
gone. But the froth purred in their frail glasses, breaking musically
in the candle-lit silence.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your name before I go?"</p>

<p>"I will not." Her bright eyes and fair young face defied him.</p>

<p>"Very well; as soon as I learn it I shall be more generous&mdash;for
I have something to tell you; and I'll do it, too!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you will?" she asked, flushing up.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I may not care to hear what you have to say, Mr. Seabury."</p>

<p>They regarded one another intently, curiously. Presently her
slender hand fell as by accident on the stem of her wine-glass;
he lifted his glass: very, very slowly. She raised hers, looking
at him over it.</p>

<p>"To&mdash;what I shall tell you&mdash;when I learn your name!" he said,
deliberately.</p>

<p>Faint fire burned in her cheeks; her eyes fell, then were slowly
raised to his; in silence, still looking at one another, they
drank the toast.</p>

<p>"Dammit!" I said, impatiently, "is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "that will be about all. I'm going home to bed."</p>
