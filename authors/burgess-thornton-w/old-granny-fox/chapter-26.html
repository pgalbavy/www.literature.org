The trouble is that troubles are,<br/>
More frequently than not,<br/>
Brought on by naught but carelessness;<br/>
By some one who forgot.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>Granny Fox had hoped that those two hens she and Reddy had stolen
from Farmer Brown's henhouse would not be missed, but they were.
They were missed the very first thing the next morning when Farmer
Brown's boy went to feed the biddies. He discovered right away
that the little sliding door which should have closed the opening
through which the hens went in and out of the house was open,
and then he remembered that he had left the henyard gate open
the night before. Carefully Farmer Brown's boy examined the hole
with the sliding door.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said he presently, and held up two red hairs which he had
found on the edge of the door. "Ha! I thought as much. I was careless
last night and didn't fasten this door, and I left the gate open.
Reddy Fox has been here, and now I know what has become of those
two hens. I suppose it serves me right for my carelessness, and
I suppose if the truth were known, those hens were of more real
good to him than they ever could have been to me, because the
poor fellow must be having pretty hard work to get a living these
hard winter days. Still, I can't have him stealing any more. That
would never do at all. If I shut them up every night and am not
careless, he can't get them. But accidents will happen, and I
might do just as I did last night&mdash;think I had locked up when
I hadn't. I don't like to set a trap for Reddy, but I must teach
the rascal a lesson. If I don't, he will get so bold that those
chickens won't be safe even in broad daylight."</p>

<p>Now at just that very time over in their home, Granny and Reddy
Fox were talking over plans for the future, and shrewd old Granny
was pointing out to Reddy how necessary it was that they should
keep away from that henyard for some time. "We've had a good dinner,
a splendid dinner, and if we are smart enough we may be able to
get more good dinners where this one came from," said she. "But
we certainly won't if we are too greedy."</p>

<p>"But I don't believe Farmer Brown's boy has missed those two
chickens, and I don't see any reason at all why we shouldn't go
back there to-night and get two more if he is stupid enough to
leave that gate and little door open," whined Reddy.</p>

<p>"Maybe he hasn't missed those two, but if we should take two
more he certainly would miss them, and he would guess what had
become of them, and that might get us into no end of trouble,"
snapped Granny. "We are not starving now, and the best thing for
us to do is to keep away from that henhouse until we can't get
anything to eat anywhere else, Now you mind what I tell you, Reddy,
and don't you dare go near there."</p>

<p>Reddy promised, and so it came about that Farmer Brown's boy
hunted up a trap all for nothing so far as Reddy and Granny were
concerned. Very carefully he bound strips of cloth around the
jaws of the trap, for he couldn't bear to think of those cruel
jaws cutting into the leg of Reddy, should he happen to get caught.
You see, Farmer Brown's boy didn't intend to kill Reddy if he
should catch him, but to make him a prisoner for a while and so
keep him out of mischief. That night he hid the trap very cunningly
just inside the henhouse where any one creeping through that little
hole made for the hens to go in and out would be sure to step
in it. Then he purposely left the little sliding door open part
way as if it had been forgotten, and he also left the henyard
gate open just as he had done the night before.</p>

<p>"There now, Master Reddy," said he, talking to himself, "I rather
think that you are going to get into trouble before morning."</p>

<p>And doubtless Reddy would have done just that thing but for the
wisdom of sly old Granny.</p>
