<p>Leila Vance, lunching with Elorn Sharrow at the Ritz, spoke of
Estridge:</p>

<p>"There seem to be so many of these well-born men who marry women
we never heard of."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we ought to have heard of them," suggested Elorn, smilingly.
"The trouble may lie with us."</p>

<p>"It does, dear. But it's something we can't help, unless we change
radically. Because we don't stand the chance we once did. We never
have been as attractive to men as the other sort. But once men
thought they couldn't marry the other sort. Now they think they
can. And they do if they have to."</p>

<p>"What other sort?" asked Elorn, not entirely understanding.</p>

<p>"The sort of girl who ignores the customs which make us what
we are. We don't stand a chance with professional women any more.
We don't compare in interest to girls who are arbiters of their
own destinies.</p>

<p>"Take the stage as an illustration. Once the popularity of women
who made it their profession was due partly to glamour, partly
because that art drew to it and concentrated the very best-looking
among us. But it's something else now that attracts men; it's
the attraction of women who are doing something&mdash;clever, experienced,
interesting, girls who know how to take care of themselves and
who are not afraid to give to men a frank and gay companionship
outside those conventional limits which circumscribe us."</p>

<p>Elorn nodded.</p>

<p>"It's quite true," said Leila. "The independent professional
girl to-day, whatever art or business engages her, is the paramount
attraction to men.</p>

<p>"A few do sneak back to us after a jolly caper in the open&mdash;a
few timid ones, or snobs of sorts&mdash;thrifty, perhaps, or otherwise
material, or cautious. But that's about all we get as husbands
in these devilish days of general feminine <em>bouleversement</em>.
And it's a sad and instructive fact, Elorn. But there seems to
be nothing to do about it."</p>

<p>Elorn said musingly: "The main thing seems to be that men admire
a girl's effort to get somewhere&mdash;when she happens to be good-looking."</p>

<p>"It's a cynical fact, dear; they certainly do. And now that they
realise they have to marry these girls if they want them&mdash;why,
they do."</p>

<p>Elorn dissected her ice. "You know Stanley Wardner," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Mortimer Wardner's son?"</p>

<p>Elorn nodded. "He became a queer kind of sculptor. I think it
is called a Concentrationist. Well, he's concentrated for life,
now."</p>

<p>"Whom did he marry?" asked Leila, laughing.</p>

<p>"A girl named Questa Terrett. You never heard of her, did you?"</p>

<p>"No. And I can imagine the moans and groans of the Mortimer Wardners."</p>

<p>"I have heard so. She lives&mdash;<em>they</em> live now, together,
in Abdingdon Square, where she possesses a studio and nearly a
dozen West Highland terriers."</p>

<p>"What else does she do?" inquired Leila, still laughing.</p>

<p>"She writes cleverly when she needs an income; otherwise, she
produces obscure poems with malice aforethought, and laughs in
her sleeve, they say, when the precious-minded rave."</p>

<p>Leila reverted to Estridge:</p>

<p>"I had no idea he was married," she said. "Palla Dumont introduced
his widow to me the other day&mdash;a most superb and beautiful creature.
But, oh dear <em>I&mdash;</em>can you fancy her having once served
as a girl-soldier in the Russian Battalion of Death!"</p>

<p>The slightest shadow crossed Elorn's face.</p>

<p>"By the way," added Leila, following quite innocently her trend
of thought, "Helen Shotwell tells me that her son is going back
to the army if he can secure a commission."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so," said Elorn serenely.</p>

<p>Leila went on: "I fancy there'll be a lot of them. A taste of
service seems to spoil most young men for a piping career of peace."</p>

<p>"He cares nothing for his business."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Real estate. He is with my father, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course. I remember&mdash;" She suddenly seemed to recollect something
else, also&mdash;not, perhaps, quite certain of it, but instinctively
playing safe. So she refrained from saying anything about this
young man's recent devotion to her friend, Palla Dumont, although
that was the subject which she had intended to introduce.</p>

<p>And, smiling to herself, she thought it a close call, because
she had meant to ask Elorn whether she knew why the Shotwell boy
had so entirely deserted her little friend Palla.</p>

<p>The Shotwell boy himself happened to be involved at that very
moment, in matters concerning a friend of Mrs. Vance's little
friend Palla&mdash;in fact, he had been trying, for the last half hour,
to find this friend of Palla's on the telephone. The friend in
question was Alonzo D. Pawling. And he was being vigorously paged
at the Hotel Rajah.</p>

<p>As for Jim, he remained seated in the private office of Angelo
Puma, whither he had been summoned in professional capacity by
one Skidder, the same being Elmer, and partner of the Puma aforesaid.</p>

<p>The door was locked; the room in disorder. Safe, letter-files,
cupboards, desks had been torn open and their contents littered
the place.</p>

<p>Skidder, in an agony of perspiring fright, kept running about
the room like a distracted squirrel. Jim watched him, darkly preoccupied
with other things, including the whereabouts of Mr. Pawling.</p>

<p>"You say," he said to Skidder, "that Mr. Pawling will confirm
what you have told me?"</p>

<p>"John D. Pawling knows damn well I own this plant!"</p>

<p>Jim shook his head: "I'm sorry, but that isn't sufficient. I
can only repeat to you that there is no point in calling me in
at present. You have no legal right to offer this property for
sale. It belongs, apparently, to the creditors of your firm. What
you require first of all is a lawyer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't want a lawyer and I don't want publicity before I get
something out of this dirty mess that scoundrel left behind!"
cried Skidder, snapping his eyes like mad and swinging his arms.
"I got to get something, haven't I? Isn't this property mine?
Can't I sell it?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not, under the terms of your agreement with Puma,"
replied Jim, wearily. "However, I'm willing to hear what Mr. Pawling
has to say."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me, Puma fixed it so I'm stuck with all his
debts? You mean to say my own personal property is subject to
seizure to satisfy&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I certainly do mean just that, Mr. Skidder. But I'm not a lawyer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I want to get something for myself before I let loose
any lawyers on the premises! I'll make it all right with you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's out of the question. We wouldn't touch the property&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'll take a quarter of its value in spot cash! I'll give you
ten thousand to put it through to-day!"</p>

<p>"Why can't you understand that what you suggest would amount
to collusion?"</p>

<p>"What I propose is to get a slice of what's mine!" yelled Skidder,
fairly dancing with fury. "D'yeh think I'm going to let that crooked
wop, Puma, do this to me just like that! D'yeh think he's going
to get away with all my money and all Pawling's money and leave
me planted on my neck while about a million other guys come and
sell me out and fill their pants pockets with what's mine?"</p>

<p>Jim said: "If Mr. Pawling is the very rich man you say he is,
he's not going to let the defalcation of this fellow, Puma, destroy
such a paying property."</p>

<p>"Damn it, I don't want him to buy it in for himself and freeze
me out! I can't stop him, either; Puma's got all my money except
what's in this parcel. And you betcha life I hang onto this, creditors
or no creditors, and Pawling to the contrary! He knows damn well
it belongs to me. Try him again at the Rajah&#11834;"</p>

<p>"They're paging him. I left the number. But I tell you the proper
thing for you to do is to go to a lawyer, and then to the police,"
repeated Jim. "There's nothing else to do. This fellow, Puma,
may have run for the Mexican border, or he may still be in the
United States. Without a passport he couldn't very easily get
on any trans-Atlantic boat or any South American boat either.
The proper procedure is to notify the police&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Nix on the police!" shouted Skidder. "That'll start the land-slide,
and the whole shooting-match will go. I want <em>this</em> property.
If the papers show it's subject to the firm's liabilities, then
that dirty skunk altered the thing. It's forgery.</p>

<p>"I never was fool enough to lump this parcel in with our assets.
Not me. It's forgery; that's what it is, and this parcel belongs
to me, privately&#11834;"</p>

<p>"See an attorney," repeated Jim patiently. "You can't keep a
thing like this out of the papers, Mr. Skidder. Why, here's a
man, Angelo Puma, who pounces on every convertible asset of his
firm, stuffs a valise full of real money, and beats it for parts
unknown.</p>

<p>"That's a matter for the police. You can't hope to hide it for
more than a day or two longer. Your firm is bankrupt through the
rascality of a partner. He's gone with all the money he could
scrape together. He converted everything into cash; he lied, swindled,
stole, and skipped. And what he didn't take must remain to satisfy
the firm's creditors. You can't conceal conditions, slyly pocket
what Puma has left and then call in an attorney. That's criminal.
You have your contracts to fulfil; you have a studio full of people
whose salaries are nearly due; you have running expenses; you
have notes to meet; you have obligations to face when a dozen
or so contractors for your new theatre come to you on Saturday&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean that's all up to me?" shrieked Skidder, squinting horribly
at a framed photograph of Puma. And suddenly he ran at it and
hurled it to the floor and began to kick it about with strange,
provincial maledictions:</p>

<p>"Dern yeh, yeh poor blimgasted thing! I'll skin yeh, yeh dumb-faced,
ring-boned, two-edged son-of-a-skunk!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The telephone's clamour silenced him. Jim answered:</p>

<p>"Who? Oh, long-distance. All right." And he waited. Then, again:
"Who wants him?... Yes, he's here in the office, now.... Yes,
he'll come to the 'phone."</p>

<p>And to Skidder: "Shadow Hill wants to speak to you."</p>

<p>"I won't go. By God, if this thing is out! &mdash;Who the hell
is it wants to speak to me? Wait! Maybe it's Alonzo D. Pawling!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Shall I inquire?" And he asked for further information over
the wire. Then, presently, and turning again to Skidder:</p>

<p>"You'd better come to the wire. It seems to be the Chief of Police
who wants you."</p>

<p>Skidder's unhealthy skin became ghastly. He came over and took
the instrument:</p>

<p>"What d'ye want, Chief? Sure it's me, Elmer.... Hey? Who? Alonzo
D. Pawling? My God, is he dead? Took <em>pizen</em>! W-what for!
He's a rich man, ain't he?... Speculated?... You say he took the
bank's funds? Trust funds? What!" he screeched&mdash;"put 'em into
<em>my</em> company! He's a liar! ... I don't care what letters
he left!... Well, all right then. Sure, I'll get a lawyer&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tell him to hold that wire!" cut in Jim; and took the receiver
from Skidder's shaking fingers.</p>

<p>"Is the Shadow Hill Trust Company insolvent?" he asked. "You
say that the bank closed its doors this morning? Have you any
idea of its condition? Looted? Is it entirely cleaned out? Is
there no chance for depositors? I wish to inquire about the trust
funds, bonds and other investments belonging to a friend of mine,
Miss Dumont.... Yes, I'll wait."</p>

<p>He turned a troubled and sombre gaze toward Skidder, who sat
there pasty-faced, with sagging jaw, staring back at him. And
presently:</p>

<p>"Yes.... Yes, this is Mr. Shotwell, a friend of Miss Dumont....
Yes.... Yes.... Yes.... I see.... Yes, I shall try to communicate
with her immediately.... Yes, I suppose the news will be published
in the evening papers.... Certainly.... Yes, I have no doubt that
she will go at once to Shadow Hill.... Thank you.... Yes, it does
seem rather hopeless.... I'll try to find her and break it to
her.... Thank you. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver, took his hat and coat, his eyes fixed
absently on Skidder.</p>

<p>"You'd better beat it to your attorney," he remarked, and went
out.</p>

<p>He could not find Palla. She was not at the Red Cross, not at
the canteen, not at the new Hostess House.</p>

<p>He telephoned Ilse for information, but she was not at home.</p>

<p>Twice he called at Palla's house, leaving a message the last
time that she should telephone him at the club on her arrival.</p>

<p>He went to the club and waited there, trying to read. At a quarter
to six o'clock no message from her had come.</p>

<p>Again he telephoned Ilse; she had not returned. He even telephoned
to Marya, loath to disturb her; but she, also, was not at home.</p>

<p>The chances that he could break the news to Palla before she
read it in the evening paper were becoming negligible. He had
done his best to forestall them. But at six the evening papers
arrived at the club. And in every one of them was an account of
the defalcation and suicide of the Honorable Alonzo D. Pawling,
president of the Shadow Hill Trust Company. But nothing yet concerning
the defalcation and disappearance of Angelo Puma.</p>

<p>Jim had no inclination to eat, but he tried to at seven-thirty,
still waiting and hoping for a message from Palla.</p>

<p>He tried her house again about half past eight. This time the
maid answered that Miss Dumont had telephoned from down town that
she would dine out and go afterward to the Combat Club. And that
if Mr. Shotwell desired to see her he should call at her house
after ten o'clock.</p>

<p>So Jim hastened to the cloak-room, got his hat and coat, found
the starter, secured a taxi, bought an evening paper and stuffed
it into his pocket, and started out to find Palla at the Combat
Club. For it seemed evident to him that she had not yet read the
evening paper; and he hoped he might yet encounter her in time
to prepare her for news which, according to the newspapers, appeared
even blacker than he had supposed it might be.</p>
