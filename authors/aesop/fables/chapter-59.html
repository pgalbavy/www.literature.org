A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and
to bite them without notice.  His master suspended a bell about
his neck so that the Dog might give notice of his presence
wherever he went.  Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog
grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the
marketplace.  One day an old hound said to him:  Why do you make
such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not,
believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of
disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill
mannered dog."  
 
Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
