<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>IT was a mild September night in 179-. The day had been one of
those warm, hazy ones that sometimes appear at that season of
the year, and the night had set in with delicious coolness. There
was a faint moon in the heavens, and several flaky clouds were
drifting past it, causing their fantastic shadows to glide like
phantoms over the settlement, sometimes, for a moment, throwing
it into shadow, and then permitting the moonlight again to stream
down upon it.</p>

<p>Most of the settlers had withdrawn within their cabins, and as
the hour had grown quite late, there were few, if any, stirring
through the village. A few pencils of light issued from the upper
port-holes of the block-house, showing that those inside were
still up; and a hearty laugh, ringing out now and then, told as
plainly that they were engaged in their usual habit of story-telling
and joking. Peterson was inside relating one of his earlier experiences,
which infinitely amused them all, the commander not hesitating
to join in the merriment.</p>

<p>On the outside, the slow-measured tread of the sentinel was heard,
and his form could be seen against the wall of the block-house,
as he walked to and fro upon the platform. His keen eye never
failed to take in at every turn, every noticeable object before
him. At one end of the projection, he had a view of the river,
now glistening in the sheen of the moonlight like liquid silver;
and, during the remainder of his walk, his vision rested upon
the broad, gloomy, murmuring forest, stretching mile after mile
before him, until, at last, it joined the sky away in the faint
horizon. It was Dick Dingle, whose watch extended until midnight.</p>

<p>While in the act of turning on his heel, at the end of the platform,
he suddenly stopped as something suspicious caught his eye. Far
up the Ohio, at such a distance that it would have been invisible
to ordinary eyes, he saw a small, dark body in the water. At first,
it had the appearance of a large bird swimming over the surface,
but the hunter well knew that it was a canoe, approaching from
the Ohio side. A slight protuberance near the middle, convinced
him that there was but one person in it.</p>

<p>When about three-fourths of the way across, the sparkle of the
ashen oars could be seen, as they dipped in the water. A moment
after, it entered the line of shadows upon the Kentucky shore
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Dingle's suspicion was aroused. The long silence and inactivity
of the savages had led him to the belief that they were preparing
to strike a great blow upon the settlements. Neither he nor Peterson
had been scouting lately, and he had no means of discovering their
intentions.</p>

<p>"Leastways, Dick Dingle," he muttered, as he resumed his walk,
"it won't do fur you to wink both eyes at the same time. Look
out fur sign."</p>

<p>He continued walking with the same measured, deliberate tread
backward and forward, apparently watching nothing, and yet maintaining
a more than usual scrutiny upon the river and forest. A half-hour
passed away, and finally an hour had elapsed, without bringing
any new suspicion to him; but he was well aware that this delay
was as good reason for apprehension, as could have been the noise
of approach.</p>

<p>"You don't cotch Dingle asleep in the night-time, or when there's
reds about. It would do to let on that. Now let's see, Dingle,
you old fool, what do you s'pose the imps are up to now? Jest
go to meditatin' will you and cipher it out. In the first place,
and afore anything else, they're up to <em>sunkthin'</em>; and
that ar' sunkthin' is the <em>devil</em>. Consequently, it's a
pinted fact, that they're up to the devil, and therefore, Dingle,
there's sunkthin' in the wind; so mind your eye and look out for
squalls. Wish they'd hurry up 'cause it's gettin' well on to that
green feller's watch, and I'd like to have an idee given me of
their intentions ef they're no partickler objections."</p>

<p>The eccentric ranger continued his walk, occasionally interspersing
it with characteristic observations similar to those above; and,
all the time, wondering why it was that something else "didn't
turn up" to give him an "idee"; but another hour wore away without
bringing the desired knowledge to him.</p>

<p>By this time, it was near midnight, and shortly after, a man
appeared beside him to relieve him of his watch. This new-comer
was known as Jenkins, and was what the rangers termed a "green
hand:" that is, he had seen little or nothing of Indian service,
and was not one who could be relied upon in an emergency. Several
practical jokes had been played upon him, such as getting him
into the wood and raising an alarm of Indians, or firing very
closely to him from concealment; and the result of these same
tricks had given one or two a suspicion that he was somewhat lacking
in courage, and would show the white feather if pressed to the
wall.</p>

<p>"Careful and not get a snoozin' to-night," remarked Dingle.</p>

<p>"Why? you don't s'pose I would, do you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know but what you might; thought I'd tell you anyway,
'cause it <em>won't do to shut your eyes to-night</em>."</p>

<p>"Why? what's the matter? What's up, eh?" queried Jenkins eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' in partickler; only I've seen Injins to-night."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! don't say so? You're joking, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Ef you think so, jest think on, but ef you don't see sights
afore mornin', it'll be 'cause you can't see: that's all," and
Dingle with a warning shake of his head turned to enter the block-house.</p>

<p>"Oh say, Dick, that ain't fair!" said Jenkins, laying his hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Ain't scart, be you?" demanded the ranger,
confronting him with an angry countenance.</p>

<p>"Oh! no-no-no, I ain't scart at all&mdash;not at all; I only want
you to tell a feller all about it. You might do that, I think."</p>

<p>"Wal, see hyer then. I seed four or five Shawnees skulking out
yonder near the wood, tryin' to draw bead on me, and I had to
do some tall dodging to hender them. You'll have to hop around
rather agile, but I guess you can steer clear. Ef you git hit,
holler and I'll haul you in and let you die inside."</p>

<p>"Oh, thunder! hold on. Dingle, don't go and leave a feller this
way. I don't think it's the fair shake at all."</p>

<p>"What in blazes do you want?" demanded the ranger, again indignantly
facing him.</p>

<p>"Why, I was a-going to say&mdash;just to kind of make the observation,
you know&mdash;that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I would think&mdash;that is &mdash;I would
like to know if you wouldn't just as lief stay out here a while?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just for company. I'll do the same favor for you some of
these times."</p>

<p>"I never want anybody out hyer when I'm standin' watch."</p>

<p>"Won't you stay. Dingle?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>And the scout turned and entered the block-house. But it was
by no means his intention to intrust the safety of the settlement
to such hands as Jenkins'; he only wished to test his courage,
and create a little diversion for his own individual benefit.
He shut the door and listened.</p>

<p>He could hear Jenkins walking along the platform, stamping his
feet bravely upon it, and whistling as loudly as his lips would
possibly permit him. Dingle ventured to open the door very slightly
and peep out at him. He saw him with his hands thrust deep down
into his pockets, his rifle leaning against the block-house, and
shooting his feet far out in advance, and slapping them down on
the planks with such effect as to set the men within growling
and snarling at each other, as they half awoke from their slumbers.
His hat was jammed down upon the back of his head, his hair dashed
away from his forehead, the white of his eyes only being visible,
as the pupils were constantly turned toward the dreaded wood.
His mouth resembled the letter O, fringed around the edges, as
he resolutely maintained its position. "Old Hundred" came out
loudly, the fall of each foot being emphasized by a desperate
burst of wind and music, and a spasmodic jerk of the head now
and then. When the whistle, at times, became more windy than musical,
he rested his lips by communings with himself.</p>

<p>"Darn the Injins! I wish they were all dead! I can't see what
they want poking round here when I'm standing watch. If I catch
sight of one, I'll bet he will wish he never heard of Pete Jenkins!
They're mean to be watching us all the time. If I was the Injins,
I would keep hunting the deers and bears and I never would come
around here when I was standing watch, but I'd shoot that Dingle,
because he's so everlastingly mean. Let me see: I was turning
'Old Hundred,' I believe." The tune was now resumed, and continued
a short time, when he again broke forth. "If them Injins will
only stay away till morning I won't care, though it would be all
the same to me, and perhaps just as well if they didn't come then
either. I was just thinking&mdash;hello! Jerusalem! I seen something
move then as sure as the world!"</p>

<p>Dingle, who had been listening all the while, now judged that
it was time to venture forth, and, closing the door behind him,
stood upon the platform. Jenkins, whose eyes were turned toward
the wood, saw nothing of him, until he tumbled over his bent form.</p>

<p>"Thunderation! that you. Dingle? what you doing here?" he exclaimed,
scrambling to his feet again.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd come out and keep you company a while."</p>

<p>"Good! I am glad of it, for I feel dreadful lonely."</p>

<p>"Seen anything?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did, out yonder near the edge of the wood."</p>

<p>Dingle looked intently toward the point indicated a few moments,
and then became satisfied that Jenkins was right&mdash;there was a
person there. While gazing in this direction, he purposely kept
his body concealed by the guard around the platform. He continued
his watch upon the suspicious object, and at last satisfied himself
of the <em>identity</em> of the person who had thus alarmed his
friend.</p>

<p>"All right!" he muttered to himself. "It's the Frontier Angel,
and there's no danger of her hurting any one. She's got sunkthin'
to tell, and she's waitin' to see ef I'm about. Howsumever, I'll
keep shady a while, just to see how this long-legged feller hyer
will jump when she gives notice she's around."</p>

<p>"Anything there?" asked Jenkins, for the third or fourth time.</p>

<p>"Yas, there is; don't make too much noise."</p>

<p>"What makes you stoop down, Dick?" he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>"I can see better this way."</p>

<p>"Shan't I stoop down, too?"</p>

<p>"Ef you're <em>afraid</em>."</p>

<p>"I ain't afraid at all, only &mdash;O Lord, I'm shot!" suddenly
exclaimed Jenkins, falling down and moaning as if in his death
struggle. Dingle was not surprised; he had heard the twang of
a bow, the whizz of the arrow, and now saw it sticking several
feet above him in the wood of the block-house. He had expected
this, for it was the manner in which that mysterious being, known
along the border as the "Frontier Angel," gave notice of her presence.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "'O Lord, I'm shot,' suddenly exclaimed Jenkins."]</p>

<p>"Get up, you fool," he commanded, giving his moaning companion
a kick, and now thoroughly provoked at the cowardice he had shown.
"Get up, I tell you; you ain't hit, but it's a pity you wasn't.
Nobody has fired at you, or tried to hit you."</p>

<p>"Didn't they? Come to think, I believe they didn't; but the fact
is, Dingle, I've been subject to fits ever since I was a boy&mdash;darnation!
do you mean to say I fell on purpose?" demanded Jenkins, suddenly
regaining his upright position and his courage at the same time,
at finding that he was unharmed.</p>

<p>"No; but it's kinder queerish the way you fell."</p>

<p>"Yes, them plaguy falling fits take me any time&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the fits, or I'll give you some more. You stay
hyer and keep watch while I go down to the gate."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what you going to do there?"</p>

<p>"There's somebody as wants to see me."</p>

<p>"You won't be gone long, will you? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"The one that fired that arrow up there at you."</p>

<p>"O Jerusalem! and so they shot at me after all. I knowed so."</p>

<p>"Wal, keep that jaw of your'n still, or you'll git shot at agin;
and, if you do, you won't be missed either. I'll be back pretty
soon."</p>

<p>With these words Dingle descended and made his way to the gate
at the palisades, to receive the message of the Frontier Angel.</p>
