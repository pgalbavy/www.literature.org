<p>Poor Tommy Fox! How he wished that he had obeyed his mother, and kept
away from Farmer Green's hen-house! Now Farmer Green's dog Spot was
chasing him. Tommy could hear him baying joyfully as he followed. But
you may be sure that Tommy was not joyful. He was terribly frightened.
He could think of nothing to do except to run, run, run! as fast as he
could go. He was headed straight for home, and he only hoped that he
would get there before the dog Spot caught him.
</p>
<p>Now, Tommy was doing just about the worst thing he could do. He never
once jumped sideways, or ran around in a circle. And though he might
have waded a little way in the shallow brook in the meadow, where Spot
would have lost his trail, Tommy used the bridge to get across the
stream; so the dog Spot had no trouble at all in following him. And
Spot kept drawing nearer and nearer.
</p><p>It happened that Mrs. Fox heard the baying of the dog. And she knew
what Spot was saying. He was crying--"I've almost got him! I've almost
got him!"
</p><p>A shiver passed over Mrs. Fox; for she thought at once of Tommy. He
was not at home, and she wondered if by any chance he was in trouble.
She hurried through the field to see who it was that Spot was chasing.
And sure enough! pretty soon Mrs. Fox saw Tommy come tearing through
the field, panting hard, with his tongue hanging out, and a most
frightened look upon his face.
</p><p>[Illustration: Tommy Dashed for the Little Door]
</p><p>Mrs. Fox hastened to meet him. The dog Spot was then on the other side
of a low hill, and running along with his nose to the ground.
</p><p>"Jump!" Mrs. Fox said to Tommy, as soon as he joined her.
</p><p>Tommy remembered, then, what his mother had always told him. So he
gave a long leap to one side.
</p><p>"Now make a big circle, and jump again. Then go home!" That was all
Mrs. Fox had time to say. She stopped just long enough to see Tommy
dash off; and then she started right in the opposite direction.
</p><p>The dog Spot saw her and gave a yelp of delight. He did not know what
had been happening. He only thought that now he was going to catch the
fox, which was the stupidest fox he had ever chased, running as it
did, straight away, with never a leap or a circle, or any other sort
of trick to fool him. Little did Spot guess that old Mrs. Fox had not
the slightest idea of being caught. She had been followed by Spot
himself many times; and she knew exactly how to escape him. She just
lingered for a few moments, to make sure that Tommy was safe, and that
Spot was chasing <u>her</u>. And then how she did run! In no time at all
she left Spot far behind.
</p><p>Now, Mrs. Fox knew that there was a ploughed field nearby, and that
was just what she wanted. She scampered towards it at great speed and
went straight across it. And when she had reached the other side of
the ploughed ground she sat down for a short breathing spell.
</p><p>You see, Mrs. Fox was very wise indeed. She knew that in dry weather,
such as there was then, a ploughed field takes no scent at all. She
knew that when Spot reached that loose dirt Spot could not smell her
footsteps. And so she just sat there on her haunches, and caught her
breath again.
</p><p>A grim smile crossed Mrs. Fox's face as she heard Spot barking away in
the distance. It was a very different bark from what she had heard
when he was chasing Tommy. This time Spot was saying, "Oh, dear! oh,
dear! I've lost him!" over and over again.
</p><p>When Mrs. Fox reached home she found Tommy safe inside their house. He
was crying, because he was afraid he would never see his mother again.
And after his mother found out how Spot had happened to chase him,
Tommy cried some more--but for an entirely different reason.
</p><p>Who can guess what the reason was?
