When amatory poets sing their loves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In liquid lines mellifluously bland,<br/>
And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They little think what mischief is in hand;<br/>
The greater their success the worse it proves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ovid's verse may give to understand;<br/>
Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,<br/>
Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.

</p>
<p>
I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in such a way as not to attract;<br/>
Plain&mdash;simple&mdash;short, and by no means inviting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a moral to each error tack'd,<br/>
Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with all passions in their turn attack'd;<br/>
Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,<br/>
This poem will become a moral model.

</p>
<p>
The European with the Asian shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream<br/>
Here and there studded with a seventy-four;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;<br/>
The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,<br/>
Far less describe, present the very view<br/>
Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.

</p>
<p>
I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For once it was a magic sound to me;<br/>
And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I beheld what never was to be;<br/>
All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:<br/>
But I grow sad&mdash;and let a tale grow cold,<br/>
Which must not be pathetically told.

</p>
<p>
The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;<br/>
'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the progress of those rolling seas<br/>
Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;<br/>
There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,<br/>
Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.

</p>
<p>
'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When nights are equal, but not so the days;<br/>
The Parcae then cut short the further spinning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise<br/>
The waters, and repentance for past sinning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:<br/>
They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;<br/>
Because if drown'd, they can't&mdash;if spared, they won't.

</p>
<p>
A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;<br/>
Each bevy with the merchant in his station:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.<br/>
All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;<br/>
The negroes more philosophy display'd,&mdash;<br/>
Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.

</p>
<p>
Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As most at his age are, of hope and health;<br/>
Yet I must own he looked a little dull,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;<br/>
Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,<br/>
A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,<br/>
To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,

</p>
<p>
Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the whole his carriage was serene:<br/>
His figure, and the splendour of his dress,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,<br/>
Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was above the vulgar by his mien;<br/>
And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;<br/>
And then&mdash;they calculated on his ransom.

</p>
<p>
Like a backgammon board the place was dotted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,<br/>
Though rather more irregularly spotted:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.<br/>
It chanced amongst the other people lotted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of thirty rather stout and hale,<br/>
With resolution in his dark grey eye,<br/>
Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.

</p>
<p>
He had an English look; that is, was square<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,<br/>
Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, it might be from thought or toil or study,<br/>
An open brow a little mark'd with care:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;<br/>
And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater<br/>
Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.

</p>
<p>
But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a high spirit evidently, though<br/>
At present weigh'd down by a doom which had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show<br/>
A kind of blunt compassion for the sad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot of so young a partner in the woe,<br/>
Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse<br/>
Than any other scrape, a thing of course.

</p>
<p>
'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,<br/>
All ragamuffins differing but in hue,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,<br/>
The only gentlemen seem I and you;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us be acquainted, as we ought:<br/>
If I could yield you any consolation,<br/>
'T would give me pleasure.<br/>
&mdash;Pray, what is your nation?'

</p>
<p>
When Juan answer'd&mdash;'Spanish!' he replied,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;<br/>
Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,<br/>
But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never mind,&mdash;she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;<br/>
She has served me also much the same as you,<br/>
Except that I have found it nothing new.'

</p>
<p>
'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What brought you here?'&mdash;'Oh! nothing very rare&mdash;<br/>
Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'&mdash;'To this doom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what conducted, if the question's fair,<br/>
Is that which I would learn.'&mdash;'I served for some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Months with the Russian army here and there,<br/>
And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,<br/>
A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'

</p>
<p>
'Have you no friends?'&mdash;'I had&mdash;but, by God's blessing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have not been troubled with them lately. Now<br/>
I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you an equal courtesy should show.'<br/>
'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long besides.'&mdash;'Oh! if 't is really so,<br/>
You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;<br/>
A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.

</p>
<p>
'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a female moderately fickle,<br/>
Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For any length of days in such a pickle.<br/>
To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:<br/>
Men are the sport of circumstances, when<br/>
The circumstances seem the sport of men.'

</p>
<p>
''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I mourn, but for the past;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I loved a maid:'-<br/>
He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A single tear upon his eyelash staid<br/>
A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is not my present lot, as I have said,<br/>
Which I deplore so much; for I have borne<br/>
Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,

</p>
<p>
'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.<br/>
'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That there had been a lady in the case;<br/>
And these are things which ask a tender tear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:<br/>
I cried upon my first wife's dying day,<br/>
And also when my second ran away:

</p>
<p>
'My third-'&mdash;'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'<br/>
'No&mdash;only two at present above ground:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see<br/>
One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?<br/>
She did not run away, too,&mdash;did she, sir?'<br/>
'No, faith.'&mdash;'What then?'&mdash;'I ran away from her.'

</p>
<p>
'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Replied the other, 'what can a man do?<br/>
There still are many rainbows in your sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,<br/>
Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But time strips our illusions of their hue,<br/>
And one by one in turn, some grand mistake<br/>
Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.

</p>
<p>
''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,<br/>
This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sometimes only wear a week or two;&mdash;<br/>
Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue<br/>
The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,<br/>
Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'

</p>
<p>
'All this is very fine, and may be true,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how<br/>
It betters present times with me or you.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow<br/>
By setting things in their right point of view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,<br/>
We know what slavery is, and our disasters<br/>
May teach us better to behave when masters.'

</p>
<p>
'Would we were masters now, if but to try<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'<br/>
Said Juan,&mdash;swallowing a heart-burning sigh:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'<br/>
'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;<br/>
Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)

</p>
<p>
'But after all, what is our present state?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is bad, and may be better&mdash;all men's lot:<br/>
Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their own whims and passions, and what not;<br/>
Society itself, which should create<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindness, destroys what little we had got:<br/>
To feel for none is the true social art<br/>
Of the world's stoics&mdash;men without a heart.'

</p>
<p>
Just now a black old neutral personage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the third sex stept up, and peering over<br/>
The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And capabilities, as to discover<br/>
If they were fitted for the purposed cage:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,<br/>
Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,<br/>
Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,

</p>
<p>
As is a slave by his intended bidder.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;<br/>
And all are to be sold, if you consider<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features<br/>
Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some by a place&mdash;as tend their years or natures;<br/>
The most by ready cash&mdash;but all have prices,<br/>
From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.

</p>
<p>
The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid<br/>
First but for one, and after for the pair;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They haggled, wrangled, swore, too&mdash;so they did!<br/>
As though they were in a mere Christian fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;<br/>
So that their bargain sounded like a battle<br/>
For this superior yoke of human cattle.

</p>
<p>
At last they settled into simple grumbling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pulling out reluctant purses, and<br/>
Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some down, and weighing others in their hand,<br/>
And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the sum was accurately scann'd,<br/>
And then the merchant giving change, and signing<br/>
Receipts in full, began to think of dining.

</p>
<p>
I wonder if his appetite was good?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if it were, if also his digestion?<br/>
Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And conscience ask a curious sort of question,<br/>
About the right divine how far we should<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,<br/>
I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour<br/>
Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.

</p>
<p>
Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found life most tolerable after meals;<br/>
He 's wrong&mdash;unless man were a pig, indeed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repletion rather adds to what he feels,<br/>
Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From his own brain's oppression while it reels.<br/>
Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather<br/>
Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);

</p>
<p>
I think with Alexander, that the act<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of eating, with another act or two,<br/>
Makes us feel our mortality in fact<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,<br/>
And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can give us either pain or pleasure, who<br/>
Would pique himself on intellects, whose use<br/>
Depends so much upon the gastric juice?

</p>
<p>
The other evening ('t was on Friday last)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fact and no poetic fable&mdash;<br/>
Just as my great coat was about me cast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My hat and gloves still lying on the table,<br/>
I heard a shot&mdash;'t was eight o'clock scarce past&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, running out as fast as I was able,<br/>
I found the military commandant<br/>
Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.

</p>
<p>
Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there<br/>
To perish on the pavement: so I had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him borne into the house and up the stair,<br/>
And stripp'd and look'd to<br/>
&mdash;But why should I ad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More circumstances? vain was every care;<br/>
The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel<br/>
Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.

</p>
<p>
I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though I have seen many corpses, never<br/>
Saw one, whom such an accident befell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,<br/>
He seem'd to sleep,&mdash;for you could scarcely tell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(As he bled inwardly, no hideous river<br/>
Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:<br/>
So as I gazed on him, I thought or said&mdash;

</p>
<p>
'Can this be death? then what is life or death?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:&mdash;<br/>
'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand warriors by his word were kept<br/>
In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.<br/>
The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb&mdash;<br/>
And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'

</p>
<p>
And they who waited once and worshipp'd&mdash;they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With their rough faces throng'd about the bed<br/>
To gaze once more on the commanding clay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:<br/>
And such an end! that he who many a day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,&mdash;<br/>
The foremost in the charge or in the sally,<br/>
Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.

</p>
<p>
The scars of his old wounds were near his new,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those honourable scars which brought him fame;<br/>
And horrid was the contrast to the view&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me quit the theme; as such things claim<br/>
Perhaps even more attention than is due<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)<br/>
To try if I could wrench aught out of death<br/>
Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;

</p>
<p>
But it was all a mystery. Here we are,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there we go:&mdash;but where? five bits of lead,<br/>
Or three, or two, or one, send very far!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?<br/>
Can every element our elements mar?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And air&mdash;earth&mdash;water&mdash;fire live&mdash;and we dead?<br/>
We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;<br/>
But let us to the story as before.

</p>
<p>
The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,<br/>
Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast as oars could pull and water float;<br/>
They look'd like persons being led to sentence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering what next, till the caique was brought<br/>
Up in a little creek below a wall<br/>
O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.

</p>
<p>
Here their conductor tapping at the wicket<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and<br/>
He led them onward, first through a low thicket<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:<br/>
They almost lost their way, and had to pick it&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For night was dosing ere they came to land.<br/>
The eunuch made a sign to those on board,<br/>
Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.

</p>
<p>
As they were plodding on their winding way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth<br/>
(Of which I might have a good deal to say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no such profusion in the North<br/>
Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that of late your scribblers think it worth<br/>
Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works<br/>
Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
As they were threading on their way, there came<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he<br/>
Whisper'd to his companion:&mdash;'t was the same<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.<br/>
'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we should strike a stroke to set us free;<br/>
Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,<br/>
And march away&mdash;'t were easier done than said.'

</p>
<p>
'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How get out? how the devil got we in?<br/>
And when we once were fairly out, and when<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,<br/>
To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And worse off than we hitherto have been;<br/>
Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,<br/>
Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.

</p>
<p>
'We must be near some place of man's abode;&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the old negro's confidence in creeping,<br/>
With his two captives, by so queer a road,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;<br/>
A single cry would bring them all abroad:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is therefore better looking before leaping&mdash;<br/>
And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,<br/>
By Jove, a noble palace!&mdash;lighted too.'

</p>
<p>
It was indeed a wide extensive building<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front<br/>
There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,&mdash;<br/>
A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts of which these lands were once the font:<br/>
Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen<br/>
New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.

</p>
<p>
And nearer as they came, a genial savour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,<br/>
Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,<br/>
And put himself upon his good behaviour:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,<br/>
Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,<br/>
And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'

</p>
<p>
Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;<br/>
The last of these was never much the fashion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.<br/>
Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But more or less continue still to tease on,<br/>
With arguments according to their 'forte;'<br/>
But no one dreams of ever being short.-

</p>
<p>
But I digress: of all appeals,&mdash;although<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,<br/>
Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,&mdash;no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Method 's more sure at moments to take hold<br/>
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More tender, as we every day behold,<br/>
Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,<br/>
The tocsin of the soul&mdash;the dinner-bell.

</p>
<p>
Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard<br/>
No Christian knoll to table, saw no line<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,<br/>
Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,<br/>
And gazed around them to the left and right<br/>
With the prophetic eye of appetite.

</p>
<p>
And giving up all notions of resistance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They follow'd close behind their sable guide,<br/>
Who little thought that his own crack'd existence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on the point of being set aside:<br/>
He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,<br/>
And a magnificent large hall display'd<br/>
The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.

</p>
<p>
I won't describe; description is my forte,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But every fool describes in these bright days<br/>
His wondrous journey to some foreign court,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise&mdash;<br/>
Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,<br/>
Resigns herself with exemplary patience<br/>
To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.

</p>
<p>
Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;<br/>
Others in monosyllable talk chatted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.<br/>
And divers smoked superb pipes decorated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With amber mouths of greater price or less;<br/>
And several strutted, others slept, and some<br/>
Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.

</p>
<p>
As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes<br/>
A moment without slackening from their pace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:<br/>
One or two stared the captives in the face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as one views a horse to guess his price;<br/>
Some nodded to the negro from their station,<br/>
But no one troubled him with conversation.

</p>
<p>
He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On through a farther range of goodly rooms,<br/>
Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A marble fountain echoes through the glooms<br/>
Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some female head most curiously presumes<br/>
To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,<br/>
As wondering what the devil a noise that is.

</p>
<p>
Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave light enough to hint their farther way,<br/>
But not enough to show the imperial halls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the flashing of their full array;<br/>
Perhaps there 's nothing<br/>
&mdash;I 'll not say appals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But saddens more by night as well as day,<br/>
Than an enormous room without a soul<br/>
To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.

</p>
<p>
Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,<br/>
There solitude, we know, has her full growth in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spots which were her realms for evermore;<br/>
But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More modern buildings and those built of yore,<br/>
A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,<br/>
Seeing what 's meant for many with but one.

</p>
<p>
A neat, snug study on a winter's night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A book, friend, single lady, or a glass<br/>
Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things which make an English evening pass;<br/>
Though certes by no means so grand a sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As is a theatre lit up by gas.<br/>
I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,<br/>
And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.

</p>
<p>
Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I grant you in a church 't is very well:<br/>
What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell<br/>
Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And huge tombs worse&mdash;mankind, since Adam fell:<br/>
Methinks the story of the tower of Babel<br/>
Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.

</p>
<p>
Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,<br/>
Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,<br/>
And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The people's awe and admiration raising;<br/>
'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,<br/>
And the calumniated queen Semiramis.

</p>
<p>
That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)<br/>
Of an improper friendship for her horse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):<br/>
This monstrous tale had probably its source<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For such exaggerations here and there I see)<br/>
In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'<br/>
I wish the case could come before a jury here.

</p>
<p>
But to resume,&mdash;should there be (what may not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,<br/>
Because they can't find out the very spot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that same Babel, or because they won't<br/>
(Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And written lately two memoirs upon't),<br/>
Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who<br/>
Must be believed, though they believe not you,

</p>
<p>
Yet let them think that Horace has exprest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly<br/>
Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who give themselves to architecture wholly;<br/>
We know where things and men must end at best:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moral (like all morals) melancholy,<br/>
And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'<br/>
Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.

</p>
<p>
At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;<br/>
Though full of all things which could be desired,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One wonder'd what to do with such a number<br/>
Of articles which nobody required;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber<br/>
With furniture an exquisite apartment,<br/>
Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.

</p>
<p>
It seem'd, however, but to open on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A range or suite of further chambers, which<br/>
Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The movables were prodigally rich:<br/>
Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So costly were they; carpets every stitch<br/>
Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish<br/>
You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.

</p>
<p>
The black, however, without hardly deigning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,<br/>
Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the milky way their feet was under<br/>
With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder&mdash;<br/>
In that remote recess which you may see&mdash;<br/>
Or if you don't the fault is not in me,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth<br/>
A quantity of clothes fit for the back<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;<br/>
And of variety there was no lack&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,<br/>
He chose himself to point out what he thought<br/>
Most proper for the Christians he had bought.

</p>
<p>
The suit he thought most suitable to each<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was, for the elder and the stouter, first<br/>
A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And trousers not so tight that they would burst,<br/>
But such as fit an Asiatic breech;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,<br/>
Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;<br/>
In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.

</p>
<p>
While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hinted the vast advantages which they<br/>
Might probably attain both in the end,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If they would but pursue the proper way<br/>
Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he added, that he needs must say,<br/>
''T would greatly tend to better their condition,<br/>
If they would condescend to circumcision.

</p>
<p>
'For his own part, he really should rejoice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see them true believers, but no less<br/>
Would leave his proposition to their choice.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The other, thanking him for this excess<br/>
Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a trifle, scarcely could express<br/>
'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation<br/>
Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.

</p>
<p>
'For his own share&mdash;he saw but small objection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To so respectable an ancient rite;<br/>
And, after swallowing down a slight refection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he own'd a present appetite,<br/>
He doubted not a few hours of reflection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would reconcile him to the business quite.'<br/>
'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,<br/>
But they as soon shall circumcise my head!

</p>
<p>
'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'&mdash;'Now, pray,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:<br/>
You put me out in what I had to say.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir!&mdash;as I said, as soon as I have supt,<br/>
I shall perpend if your proposal may<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be such as I can properly accept;<br/>
Provided always your great goodness still<br/>
Remits the matter to our own free-will.'

</p>
<p>
Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit<br/>
In which a Princess with great pleasure would<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,<br/>
As not being in a masquerading mood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;<br/>
And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'<br/>
Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'

</p>
<p>
'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:<br/>
I have no more time nor many words to spare.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire<br/>
The cause of this odd travesty?'&mdash;'Forbear,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,<br/>
No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:<br/>
I have no authority to tell the reason.'

</p>
<p>
'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'&mdash;'Hold!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;<br/>
This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will find us not top fond of joking.'<br/>
'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking<br/>
The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call<br/>
Those who will leave you of no sex at all.

</p>
<p>
'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's, true; but then there is a cause<br/>
Why you should wear them.'&mdash;'What, though my soul loathes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The effeminate garb?'&mdash;thus, after a short pause,<br/>
Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'<br/>
Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace<br/>
Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.

</p>
<p>
And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;<br/>
Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;<br/>
But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which&mdash;as we say&mdash;or, as the Scotch say, whilk<br/>
(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes<br/>
Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:<br/>
And yet at last he managed to get through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:<br/>
The negro Baba help'd a little too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;<br/>
And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,<br/>
He paused, and took a survey up and down.

</p>
<p>
One difficulty still remain'd&mdash;his hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hardly long enough; but Baba found<br/>
So many false long tresses all to spare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That soon his head was most completely crown'd,<br/>
After the manner then in fashion there;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this addition with such gems was bound<br/>
As suited the ensemble of his toilet,<br/>
While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.

</p>
<p>
And now being femininely all array'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,<br/>
He look'd in almost all respects a maid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,<br/>
A perfect transformation here display'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,<br/>
That is&mdash;the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,<br/>
Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.

</p>
<p>
'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Will please to accompany those gentlemen<br/>
To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when<br/>
I say a thing, it must at once be done.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What fear you? think you this a lion's den?<br/>
Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise<br/>
Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.

</p>
<p>
'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;<br/>
Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is not quite so light as you may deem.<br/>
I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If any take me for that which I seem:<br/>
So that I trust for everybody's sake,<br/>
That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'

</p>
<p>
'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who<br/>
Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the metamorphosis in view,&mdash;<br/>
'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;<br/>
One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,<br/>
By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'

</p>
<p>
'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you a good appetite.'&mdash;'Farewell!'<br/>
Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:<br/>
We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'<br/>
'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,<br/>
Unless his highness promises to marry me.

</p>
<p>
And thus they parted, each by separate doors;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba led Juan onward room by room<br/>
Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,<br/>
Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wafted far arose a rich perfume:<br/>
It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,<br/>
For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.

</p>
<p>
The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;<br/>
Warriors thereon were battling furiously;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;<br/>
There captives led in triumph droop the eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in perspective many a squadron flies:<br/>
It seems the work of times before the line<br/>
Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.

</p>
<p>
This massy portal stood at the wide close<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a huge hall, and on its either side<br/>
Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied<br/>
In mockery to the enormous gate which rose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:<br/>
The gate so splendid was in all its features,<br/>
You never thought about those little creatures,

</p>
<p>
Until you nearly trod on them, and then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You started back in horror to survey<br/>
The wondrous hideousness of those small men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,<br/>
But an extraneous mixture, which no pen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;<br/>
They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb&mdash;<br/>
Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.

</p>
<p>
Their duty was&mdash;for they were strong, and though<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They look'd so little, did strong things at times&mdash;<br/>
To ope this door, which they could really do,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;<br/>
And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the custom of those Eastern climes,<br/>
To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;<br/>
For mutes are generally used for that.

</p>
<p>
They spoke by signs&mdash;that is, not spoke at all;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking like two incubi, they glared<br/>
As Baba with his fingers made them fall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaving back the portal folds: it scared<br/>
Juan a moment, as this pair so small<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;<br/>
It was as if their little looks could poison<br/>
Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.

</p>
<p>
Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:<br/>
'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That somewhat manly majesty of stride,<br/>
'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To swing a little less from side to side,<br/>
Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;&mdash;<br/>
And also could you look a little modest,

</p>
<p>
''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;<br/>
And if they should discover your disguise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;<br/>
And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To find our way to Marmora without boats,<br/>
Stitch'd up in sacks&mdash;a mode of navigation<br/>
A good deal practised here upon occasion.'

</p>
<p>
With this encouragement, he led the way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a room still nobler than the last;<br/>
A rich confusion form'd a disarray<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such sort, that the eye along it cast<br/>
Could hardly carry anything away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;<br/>
A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,<br/>
Magnificently mingled in a litter.

</p>
<p>
Wealth had done wonders&mdash;taste not much; such things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Occur in Orient palaces, and even<br/>
In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Of which I have also seen some six or seven),<br/>
Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;<br/>
Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,<br/>
On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.

</p>
<p>
In this imperial hall, at distance lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a canopy, and there reclined<br/>
Quite in a confidential queenly way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd<br/>
To Juan, who though not much used to pray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,<br/>
What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended<br/>
His head, until the ceremony ended.

</p>
<p>
The lady rising up with such an air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Venus rose with from the wave, on them<br/>
Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;<br/>
And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem<br/>
Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,<br/>
Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.

</p>
<p>
Her presence was as lofty as her state;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her beauty of that overpowering kind,<br/>
Whose force description only would abate:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,<br/>
Than lessen it by what I could relate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of forms and features; it would strike you blind<br/>
Could I do justice to the full detail;<br/>
So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.

</p>
<p>
Thus much however I may add,&mdash;her years<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;<br/>
But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,<br/>
Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true&mdash;tears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings<br/>
Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow<br/>
Ugly; for instance<br/>
&mdash;Ninon de l'Enclos.

</p>
<p>
She spake some words to her attendants, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,<br/>
And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;<br/>
They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'<br/>
As far as outward show may correspond;<br/>
I won't be bail for anything beyond.

</p>
<p>
They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not by the same door through which came in<br/>
Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At some small distance, all he saw within<br/>
This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;<br/>
And I must say, I ne'er could see the very<br/>
Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'

</p>
<p>
'Not to admire is all the art I know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)<br/>
To make men happy, or to keep them so'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(So take it in the very words of Creech)&mdash;<br/>
Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach<br/>
From his translation; but had none admired,<br/>
Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?

</p>
<p>
Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then<br/>
A second time desired him to kneel down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when<br/>
He heard repeated, Juan with a frown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew himself up to his full height again,<br/>
And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop<br/>
To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'

</p>
<p>
Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat<br/>
He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About a bow-string&mdash;quite in vain; not yet<br/>
Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's nothing in the world like etiquette<br/>
In kingly chambers or imperial halls,<br/>
As also at the race and county balls.

</p>
<p>
He stood like Atlas, with a world of words<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About his ears, and nathless would not bend:<br/>
The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend<br/>
To stain his pedigree a thousand swords<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times of him had made an end;<br/>
At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,<br/>
Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.

</p>
<p>
Here was an honourable compromise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-way house of diplomatic rest,<br/>
Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan now his willingness exprest<br/>
To use all fit and proper courtesies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding, that this was commonest and best,<br/>
For through the South the custom still commands<br/>
The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.

</p>
<p>
And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers<br/>
No lips e'er left their transitory trace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,<br/>
And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers<br/>
In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's<br/>
An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.

</p>
<p>
The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,<br/>
As if well used to the retreating trade;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And taking hints in good part all the while,<br/>
He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking on him with a sort of smile,<br/>
Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction<br/>
As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.

</p>
<p>
When he was gone, there was a sudden change:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not what might be the lady's thought,<br/>
But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,<br/>
Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,<br/>
A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,<br/>
Of half voluptuousness and half command.

</p>
<p>
Her form had all the softness of her sex,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her features all the sweetness of the devil,<br/>
When he put on the cherub to perplex<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;<br/>
The sun himself was scarce more free from specks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;<br/>
Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,<br/>
As if she rather order'd than was granting.

</p>
<p>
Something imperial, or imperious, threw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain<br/>
Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rapture's self will seem almost a pain<br/>
With aught which looks like despotism in view:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain<br/>
We would against them make the flesh obey&mdash;<br/>
The spirit in the end will have its way.

</p>
<p>
Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her very nod was not an inclination;<br/>
There was a self-will even in her small feet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though they were quite conscious of her station&mdash;<br/>
They trod as upon necks; and to complete<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her state (it is the custom of her nation),<br/>
A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign<br/>
She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).

</p>
<p>
'To hear and to obey' had been from birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of all around her; to fulfill<br/>
All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;<br/>
Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;<br/>
Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion<br/>
We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'

</p>
<p>
Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed<br/>
It might be seen, with diligence was sought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;<br/>
There was no end unto the things she bought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;<br/>
Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,<br/>
The women pardon'd all except her face.

</p>
<p>
Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eye in passing on his way to sale;<br/>
She order'd him directly to be bought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail<br/>
In any kind of mischief to be wrought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At all such auctions knew how to prevail:<br/>
She had no prudence, but he had; and this<br/>
Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.

</p>
<p>
His youth and features favour'd the disguise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,<br/>
Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This I must leave sultanas to decide:<br/>
Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kings and consorts oft are mystified,<br/>
As we may ascertain with due precision,<br/>
Some by experience, others by tradition.

</p>
<p>
But to the main point, where we have been tending:&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She now conceived all difficulties past,<br/>
And deem'd herself extremely condescending<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When, being made her property at last,<br/>
Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,<br/>
And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'<br/>
Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move

</p>
<p>
And so it was, in proper time and place;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing<br/>
With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,<br/>
Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;<br/>
These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,<br/>
So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.

</p>
<p>
She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For women shed and use them at their liking;<br/>
But there is something when man's eye appears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;<br/>
A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in<br/>
His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)<br/>
To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.

</p>
<p>
And she would have consoled, but knew not how:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no equals, nothing which had e'er<br/>
Infected her with sympathy till now,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never having dreamt what 't was to bear<br/>
Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There might arise some pouting petty care<br/>
To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near<br/>
Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.

</p>
<p>
But nature teaches more than power can spoil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when a strong although a strange sensation<br/>
Moves&mdash;female hearts are such a genial soil<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,<br/>
They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Samaritans in every situation;<br/>
And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,<br/>
Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.

</p>
<p>
But tears must stop like all things else; and soon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan, who for an instant had been moved<br/>
To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'<br/>
Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with the very weakness he reproved;<br/>
And although sensitive to beauty, he<br/>
Felt most indignant still at not being free.

</p>
<p>
Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was much embarrass'd, never having met<br/>
In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she also risk'd her life to get<br/>
Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,<br/>
To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,<br/>
And they had wasted now almost a quarter.

</p>
<p>
I also would suggest the fitting time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To gentlemen in any such like case,<br/>
That is to say in a meridian clime&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With us there is more law given to the chase,<br/>
But here a small delay forms a great crime:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So recollect that the extremest grace<br/>
Is just two minutes for your declaration&mdash;<br/>
A moment more would hurt your reputation.

</p>
<p>
Juan's was good; and might have been still better,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had got Haidee into his head:<br/>
However strange, he could not yet forget her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.<br/>
Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For having had him to her palace led,<br/>
Began to blush up to the eyes, and then<br/>
Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.

</p>
<p>
At length, in an imperial way, she laid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes<br/>
Which needed not an empire to persuade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look'd into his for love, where none replies:<br/>
Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the last thing a proud woman tries;<br/>
She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw<br/>
Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.

</p>
<p>
This was an awkward test, as Juan found,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:<br/>
With gentle force her white arms he unwound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seated her all drooping by his side,<br/>
Then rising haughtily he glanced around,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking coldly in her face, he cried,<br/>
'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor<br/>
Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.

</p>
<p>
'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How much I have loved&mdash;that I love not thee!<br/>
In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!<br/>
I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;<br/>
Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,<br/>
And hands obey&mdash;our hearts are still our own.'

</p>
<p>
This was a truth to us extremely trite;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:<br/>
She deem'd her least command must yield delight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth being only made for queens and kings.<br/>
If hearts lay on the left side or the right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She hardly knew, to such perfection brings<br/>
Legitimacy its born votaries, when<br/>
Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.

</p>
<p>
Besides, as has been said, she was so fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As even in a much humbler lot had made<br/>
A kingdom or confusion anywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And also, as may be presumed, she laid<br/>
Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By their possessors thrown into the shade:<br/>
She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'<br/>
And half of that opinion 's also mine.

</p>
<p>
Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,<br/>
While some more desperate dowager has been waging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung<br/>
By your refusal, recollect her raging!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or recollect all that was said or sung<br/>
On such a subject; then suppose the face<br/>
Of a young downright beauty in this case.

</p>
<p>
Suppose,&mdash;but you already have supposed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,<br/>
Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of good examples; pity that so few by<br/>
Poets and private tutors are exposed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To educate&mdash;ye youth of Europe&mdash;you by!<br/>
But when you have supposed the few we know,<br/>
You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.

</p>
<p>
A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any interesting beast of prey,<br/>
Are similes at hand for the distress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ladies who can not have their own way;<br/>
But though my turn will not be served with less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These don't express one half what I should say:<br/>
For what is stealing young ones, few or many,<br/>
To cutting short their hopes of having any?

</p>
<p>
The love of offspring 's nature's general law,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;<br/>
There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;<br/>
And all who have seen a human nursery, saw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;<br/>
This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer<br/>
Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.

</p>
<p>
If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T were nothing&mdash;for her eyes flash'd always fire;<br/>
Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,<br/>
So supernatural was her passion's rise;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:<br/>
Even ye who know what a check'd woman is<br/>
(Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.

</p>
<p>
Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment's more had slain her; but the while<br/>
It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,<br/>
Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;<br/>
And the deep passions flashing through her form<br/>
Made her a beautiful embodied storm.

</p>
<p>
A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To match a common fury with her rage,<br/>
And yet she did not want to reach the moon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;<br/>
Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age&mdash;<br/>
Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,<br/>
And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.

</p>
<p>
A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass'd without words&mdash;in fact she could not speak;<br/>
And then her sex's shame broke in at last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sentiment till then in her but weak,<br/>
But now it flow'd in natural and fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As water through an unexpected leak;<br/>
For she felt humbled&mdash;and humiliation<br/>
Is sometimes good for people in her station

</p>
<p>
It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It also gently hints to them that others,<br/>
Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,<br/>
And works of the same pottery, bad or good,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:<br/>
It teaches<br/>
&mdash;Heaven knows only what it teaches,<br/>
But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.

</p>
<p>
Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her second, to cut only his&mdash;acquaintance;<br/>
Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;<br/>
Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence<br/>
The lash to Baba:&mdash;but her grand resource<br/>
Was to sit down again, and cry of course.

</p>
<p>
She thought to stab herself, but then she had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;<br/>
For Eastern stays are little made to pad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:<br/>
She thought of killing Juan&mdash;but, poor lad!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he deserved it well for being so backward,<br/>
The cutting off his head was not the art<br/>
Most likely to attain her aim&mdash;his heart.

</p>
<p>
Juan was moved; he had made up his mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish<br/>
For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,<br/>
And thus heroically stood resign'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than sin&mdash;except to his own wish:<br/>
But all his great preparatives for dying<br/>
Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.

</p>
<p>
As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;<br/>
And first he wonder'd why he had refused;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, if matters could be made up now;<br/>
And next his savage virtue he accused,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a friar may accuse his vow,<br/>
Or as a dame repents her of her oath,<br/>
Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.

</p>
<p>
So he began to stammer some excuses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But words are not enough in such a matter,<br/>
Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,<br/>
Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a languid smile began to flatter<br/>
His peace was making, but before he ventured<br/>
Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.

</p>
<p>
'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!<br/>
Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,<br/>
Your slave brings tidings&mdash;he hopes not too soon&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which your sublime attention may be worth:<br/>
The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,<br/>
To hint that he is coming up this way.'

</p>
<p>
'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!<br/>
But bid my women form the milky way.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning&mdash;<br/>
And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'<br/>
Here they were interrupted by a humming<br/>
Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'

</p>
<p>
First came her damsels, a decorous file,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;<br/>
The train might reach a quarter of a mile:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty was always so polite<br/>
As to announce his visits a long while<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he came, especially at night;<br/>
For being the last wife of the Emperour,<br/>
She was of course the favorite of the four.

</p>
<p>
His Highness was a man of solemn port,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,<br/>
Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;<br/>
He was as good a sovereign of the sort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As any mention'd in the histories<br/>
Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine<br/>
Save Solyman, the glory of their line.

</p>
<p>
He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'<br/>
He left to his vizier all state affairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And show'd but little royal curiosity:<br/>
I know not if he had domestic cares&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No process proved connubial animosity;<br/>
Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,<br/>
Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.

</p>
<p>
If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little was heard of criminal or crime;<br/>
The story scarcely pass'd a single lip&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sack and sea had settled all in time,<br/>
From which the secret nobody could rip:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;<br/>
No scandals made the daily press a curse&mdash;<br/>
Morals were better, and the fish no worse.

</p>
<p>
He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was also certain that the earth was square,<br/>
Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No sign that it was circular anywhere;<br/>
His empire also was without a bound:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is true, a little troubled here and there,<br/>
By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,<br/>
But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'

</p>
<p>
Except in shape of envoys, who were sent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lodge there when a war broke out, according<br/>
To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in<br/>
Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording<br/>
Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or<br/>
The singeing of a single inky whisker.

</p>
<p>
He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,<br/>
The former in a palace, where like nuns<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,<br/>
When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes at six years old&mdash;though it seems odd,<br/>
'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw<br/>
Must make a present to his sire in law.

</p>
<p>
His sons were kept in prison, till they grew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,<br/>
One or the other, but which of the two<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could yet be known unto the fates alone;<br/>
Meantime the education they went through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:<br/>
So that the heir apparent still was found<br/>
No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.

</p>
<p>
His majesty saluted his fourth spouse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the ceremonies of his rank,<br/>
Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;<br/>
These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To save the credit of their breaking bank:<br/>
To no men are such cordial greetings given<br/>
As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.

</p>
<p>
His Highness cast around his great black eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking, as he always look'd, perceived<br/>
Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,<br/>
But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,<br/>
'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity<br/>
That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'

</p>
<p>
This compliment, which drew all eyes upon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.<br/>
Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take<br/>
Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of them his lips imperial ever spake!<br/>
There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,<br/>
But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.

</p>
<p>
The Turks do well to shut&mdash;at least, sometimes&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The women up, because, in sad reality,<br/>
Their chastity in these unhappy climes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not a thing of that astringent quality<br/>
Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes our snow less pure than our morality;<br/>
The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,<br/>
Has quite the contrary effect on vice.

</p>
<p>
Thus in the East they are extremely strict,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;<br/>
Excepting only when the former 's pick'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;<br/>
Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;<br/>
Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life<br/>
Into that moral centaur, man and wife?

</p>
<p>
Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not for want of matter; but 't is time<br/>
According to the ancient epic laws,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.<br/>
Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;<br/>
Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps<br/>
You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.
