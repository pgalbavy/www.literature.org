<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a sorry party that looked at each other in the first light
of dawn.</p>

<p>Our eyes were hollow with suspense, and all but Shalah had the
hunted look of men caught in a trap. Not till the sun had got
above the tree-tops did we venture to leave our posts and think
of food. It was now that Elspeth's spirit showed supreme. The
courage of that pale girl put us all to the blush. She alone carried
her head high and forced an air of cheerfulness. She lit the fire
with Donaldson's help, and broiled some deer's flesh for our breakfast,
and whistled gently as she wrought, bringing into our wild business
a breath of the orderly comfort of home. I had seen her in silk
and lace, a queen among the gallants, but she never looked so
fair as on that misty morning, her hair straying over her brow,
her plain kirtle soiled and sodden, but her eyes bright with her
young courage.</p>

<p>During the last hours of that dark vigil my mind had been torn
with cares. If we escaped the perils of the night, I asked myself,
what then? Here were the seven of us, pinned in a hill-fort, with
no help within fifty miles, and one of the seven was a woman!
I judged that the Indian force was large, and there was always
the mighty army waiting farther south in that shelf of the hills.
If they sought to take us, it must be a matter of a day or two
at the most till they succeeded. If they only played with us&mdash;which
is the cruel Indian way&mdash;we might resist a little, but starvation
would beat us down. Where were we to get food, with the forests
full of our subtle enemies? To sit still would mean to wait upon
death, and the waiting would not be long.</p>

<p>There was the chance, to be sure, that the Indians would be drawn
off in the advance towards the east. But here came in a worse
anxiety. I had come to get news to warn the Tidewater. That news
I had got. The mighty gathering which Shalah's eyes and mine had
beheld in that upland glen was the peril we had foreseen. What
good were easy victories over raiding Cherokees when this deadly
host waited on the leash? I had no doubt that the Cherokees were
now broken. Stafford county would be full of Nicholson's militia,
and Lawrence's strong hand lay on the line of the Borders. But
what availed it? While Virginia was flattering herself that she
had repelled the savages, and the Rappahannock men were notching
their muskets with the tale of the dead, a wave was gathering
to sweep down the Pamunkey or the James, and break on the walls
of James Town. I did not think that Nicholson, forewarned and
prepared, could stem the torrent; and if it caught him unawares
the proud Tidewater would break like a rotten reed.</p>

<p>I had been sent to scout. Was I to be false to the word I had
given, and let any risk to myself or others deter me from taking
back the news? The Indian army tarried; why, I did not know&mdash;perhaps
some mad whim of their soothsayers, perhaps the device of a wise
general; but at any rate they tarried. If a war party could spend
a night in baiting us and slaying our horses, there could be no
very instant orders for the road. If this were so, a bold man
might yet reach the Border line. At that moment it seemed to me
a madman's errand. Even if I slipped past the watchers in the
woods and the glens, the land between would be strewn with fragments
of the Cherokee host, and I had not the Indian craft. But it was
very seriously borne in upon me that 'twas my duty to try. God
might prosper a bold stroke, and in any case I should be true
to my trust.</p>

<p>But what of Elspeth? The thought of leaving her was pure torment.
In our hideous peril 'twas scarcely to be endured that one should
go. I told myself that if I reached the Border I could get help,
but my heart warned me that I lied. My news would leave no time
there for riding hillward to rescue a rash adventure. We were
beyond the pale, and must face the consequences. That we all had
known, and reckoned with, but we had not counted that our risk
would be shared by a woman. Ah I that luckless ride of Elspeth's!
But for that foolish whim she would be safe now in the cool house
at Middle Plantation, with a ship to take her to safety if the
worst befell. And now of all the King's subjects in that hour
we were the most ill-fated, islanded on a sand heap with the tide
of savage war hourly eating into our crazy shelter.</p>

<p>Before the daylight came, as I stood with my cheek to my musket,
I had come to a resolution. In a tangle of duties a man must seize
the solitary clear one, and there could be no doubt of what mine
was, I must try for the Tidewater, and I must try alone, Shalah
had the best chance to get through, but without Shalah the stockade
was no sort of refuge. Ringan was wiser and stronger than I, but
I thought I had more hill-craft, and, besides, the duty was mine,
not his. Grey had no knowledge of the wilds, and Donaldson and
Bertrand could not handle the news as it should be handled, in
the unlikely event of their getting through alive. No, there were
no two ways of it. I must make the effort, though in that leaden
hour of weariness and cold it seemed as if my death-knell were
ringing.</p>

<p>Morn showed a grey world, strewn with the havoc of the storm.
The eagles were already busy among the dead horses, and our first
job was to bury the poor beasts. Just outside the stockade we
dug as best we could a shallow trench, while the muskets of the
others kept watch over us. There we laid also the body of the
man I had shot in the night. He was a young savage, naked to the
waist, and curiously tattooed on the forehead with the device
of what seemed to be a rising or setting sun. I observed that
Shalah looked closely at this, and that his face wore an unusual
excitement. He said something in his own tongue, and, when the
trench was dug, laid the dead man in it so that his head pointed
westwards.</p>

<p>We wrought in a dogged silence, and Elspeth's cheery whistling
was the only sound in that sullen morning. It fairly broke my
heart. She was whistling the old tune of "Leezie Lindsay," a merry
lilt with the hill wind and the heather in it. The bravery of
the poor child was the hardest thing of all to bear when I knew
that in a few hours' time the end might come. The others were
only weary and dishevelled and ill at ease, but on me seemed to
have fallen the burden of the cares of the whole earth.</p>

<p>Shalah had disappeared for a little, and came back with the word
that the near forests were empty. So I summoned a council, and
talked as we breakfasted. I had looked into the matter of the
food, and found that we had sufficient for three days. We had
boucanned a quantity of deer's flesh two days before, and this,
with the fruit of yesterday's trapping, made a fair stock in our
larder.</p>

<p>Then I announced my plan. "I am going to try to reach Lawrence,"
I said.</p>

<p>No one spoke. Shalah lifted his head, and looked at me gravely.</p>

<p>"Does any man object?" I asked sharply, for my temper was all
of an edge.</p>

<p>"Your throat will be cut in the first mile," said Donaldson gruffly.</p>

<p>"Maybe it will, but maybe not. At any rate, I can try. You have
not heard what Shalah and I found in the hills yesterday. Twelve
miles south there is a glen with a plateau at its head, and that
plateau is as full of Indians as a beehive. Ay, Ringan, you and
Lawrence were right. The Cherokees are the least of the trouble.
There's a great army come out of the West, men that you and I
never saw the like of before, and they are waiting till the Cherokees
have drawn the fire of the Borderers, and then they will bring
hell to the Tidewater. You and I know that there's some sort of
madman in command, a man that quotes the Bible and speaks English;
but madman or not, he's a great general, and woe betide Virginia
if he gets among the manors. I was sent to the hills to get news,
and I've got it. Would it not be the part of a coward to bide
here and make no effort to warn our friends?"</p>

<p>"What good would a warning do?" said Ringan. "Even if you got
through to Lawrence&mdash;which is not very likely&mdash;d'you think a wheen
Borderers in a fort will stay such an army? It would only mean
that you lost your life on the South Fork instead of in the hills,
and there's little comfort in that."</p>

<p>"It's not like you to give such counsel," I said sadly. "A man
cannot think whether his duty will succeed as long as it's there
for him to do it. Maybe my news would make all the differ. Maybe
there would be time to get Nicholson's militia to the point of
danger. God has queer ways of working, if we trust Him with honest
hearts. Besides, a word on the Border would save the Tidewater
folk, for there are ships on the James and the York to flee to
if they hear in time. Let Virginia go down and be delivered over
to painted savages, and some day soon we will win it back; but
we cannot bring life to the dead. I want to save the lowland manors
from what befell the D'Aubignys on the Rapidan, and if I can only
do that much I will be content. Will you counsel me, Ringan, to
neglect my plain duty?"</p>

<p>"I gave no counsel," said Ringan hurriedly. "I was only putting
the common sense of it. It's for you to choose."</p>

<p>Here Grey broke in. "I protest against this craziness. Your first
duty is to your comrades and to this lady. If you desert us we
lose our best musket, and you have as little chance of reaching
the Tidewater as the moon. Arc you so madly enamoured of death,
Mr. Garvald?" He spoke in the old stiff tones of the man I had
quarrelled with.</p>

<p>I turned to Shalah. "Is there any hope of getting to the South
Fork?"</p>

<p>He looked me very full in the face. "As much hope as a dove has
who falls broken-winged into an eyrie of falcons! As much hope
as the deer when the hunter's knife is at its throat! Yet the
dove may escape, and the deer may yet tread the forest. While
a man draws breath there is hope, brother."</p>

<p>"Which I take to mean that the odds are a thousand against one,"
said Grey.</p>

<p>"Then it's my business to stake all on the one," I cried. "Man,
don't you see my quandary? I hold a solemn trust, which I have
the means of fulfilling, and I'm bound to try. It's torture to
me to leave you, but you will lose nothing. Three men could hold
this place as well as six, if the Indians are not in earnest,
and, if they are, a hundred would be too few. Your danger will
be starvation, and I will be a mouth less to feed. If I get to
the Border I will find help, for we cannot stay here for ever,
and how d'you think we are to get Miss Blair by ourselves to the
Rappahannock with every mile littered with fighting clans? I must
go, or I will never have another moment's peace in life."  Grey
was not convinced. "Send the Indian," he said.</p>

<p>"And leave the stockade defenceless," I cried. "It's because
he stays behind that I dare to go. Without him we are all bairns
in the dark."</p>

<p>"That's true, anyway," said Ringan, and fell to whittling a stick.</p>

<p>"For three days," I continued, "you have food enough, and if
by the end of it you are not attacked you may safely go hunting
for more. If nothing happens in a week's time you will know that
I have failed, and you can send another messenger. Ringan would
be the best."</p>

<p>"That can hardly be," he said, "because I'm coming with you now."</p>

<p>I could only stare blankly.</p>

<p>"Two's better than one for this kind of business, and I am no
use here&mdash;only <em>fruges consumere natus</em>, as I learned from
the Inveraray dominie. It's my concern as much as yours, for I
brought you here, and I'm trysted with Lawrence to take back word.
I'm loath to leave my friends, but my place is at your side, Andrew.
So say no more about it."</p>

<p>I knew it was idle to protest. Ringan was as obstinate as a Spanish
mule when he chose, and, besides, there was reason in what he
said. Two were better than one both for speed in travel and for
fighting if the need came, and though I had more woodcraft than
he, he had ten times my wisdom. There was something about his
matter-of-fact tone which took the enterprise out of the land
of impossibilities into a more sober realm. I even began to dream
of success.</p>

<p>But when. I looked at Elspeth her eyes were so full of grief
and care that my spirits sank again.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I cried, "that you think I am doing right, God knows
it is hard to leave you, and I carry the sorest heart in Virginia.
But you would not have me stay idle when my plain duty commands.
Say that you bid me go, Elspeth."</p>

<p>"I bid you go," she said bravely, "and I will pray God to keep
you safe." But her eyes belied her voice, for they were swimming
with tears. At that moment I got the conviction that I was more
to her than a mere companion, that by some miracle I had won a
place in that proud and loyal heart. It seemed a cruel stroke
of fate that I should get this hope at the very moment when I
was to leave her and go into the shadow of death.</p>

<p>But that was no hour to think of love, I took every man apart
and swore him, though there was little need, to stand by the girl
at all costs.</p>

<p>To Grey I opened my inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>"You and I serve one mistress," I said, "and now I confide her
to your care. All that I would have done I am assured you will
do. My heart is easier when I know that you are by her side. Once
we were foes, and since then we have been friends, and now you
are the dearest friend on earth, for I leave you with all I cherish."</p>

<p>He flushed deeply and gave me his hand.</p>

<p>"Go in peace, sir," he said. "If God wills that we perish, my
last act will be to assure an easy passage to heaven for her we
worship. If we meet again, we meet as honourable rivals, and may
that day come soon."</p>

<p>So with pistols in belt, and a supply of cartouches and some
little food in our pockets, Ringan and I were enfolded in the
silence of the woods.</p>
