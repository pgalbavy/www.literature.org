<p>Denis had been called, but in spite of the parted curtains he
had dropped off again into that drowsy, dozy state when sleep
becomes a sensual pleasure almost consciously savoured. In this
condition he might have remained for another hour if he had not
been disturbed by a violent rapping at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," he mumbled, without opening his eyes. The latch clicked,
a hand seized him by the shoulder and he was rudely shaken.</p>

<p>"Get up, get up!"</p>

<p>His eyelids blinked painfully apart, and he saw Mary standing
over him, bright-faced and earnest.</p>

<p>"Get up!" she repeated. "You must go and send the telegram. Don’t
you remember?"</p>

<p>"O Lord!" He threw off the bed-clothes; his tormentor retired.</p>

<p>Denis dressed as quickly as he could and ran up the road to the
village post office. Satisfaction glowed within him as he returned.
He had sent a long telegram, which would in a few hours evoke
an answer ordering him back to town at once&mdash;on urgent business.
It was an act performed, a decisive step taken&mdash;and he so rarely
took decisive steps; he felt pleased with himself. It was with
a whetted appetite that he came in to breakfast.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Mr. Scogan. "I hope you’re better."</p>

<p>"Better?"</p>

<p>"You were rather worried about the cosmos last night."</p>

<p>Denis tried to laugh away the impeachment. "Was I?" he lightly
asked.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mr. Scogan, "that I had nothing worse to prey
on my mind. I should be a happy man."</p>

<p>"One is only happy in action," Denis enunciated, thinking of
the telegram.</p>

<p>He looked out of the window. Great florid baroque clouds floated
high in the blue heaven. A wind stirred among the trees, and their
shaken foliage twinkled and glittered like metal in the sun. Everything
seemed marvellously beautiful. At the thought that he would soon
be leaving all this beauty he felt a momentary pang; but he comforted
himself by recollecting how decisively he was acting.</p>

<p>"Action," he repeated aloud, and going over to the sideboard
he helped himself to an agreeable mixture of bacon and fish.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Denis repaired to the terrace, and, sitting there,
raised the enormous bulwark of the "Times" against the possible
assaults of Mr. Scogan, who showed an unappeased desire to go
on talking about the Universe. Secure behind the crackling pages,
he meditated. In the light of this brilliant morning the emotions
of last night seemed somehow rather remote. And what if he had
seen them embracing in the moonlight? Perhaps it didn’t mean much
after all. And even if it did, why shouldn’t he stay? He felt
strong enough to stay, strong enough to be aloof, disinterested,
a mere friendly acquaintance. And even if he weren’t strong enough...</p>

<p>"What time do you think the telegram will arrive?" asked Mary
suddenly, thrusting in upon him over the top of the paper.</p>

<p>Denis started guiltily. "I don’t know at all," he said.</p>

<p>"I was only wondering," said Mary, "because there’s a very good
train at 3.27, and it would be nice if you could catch it, wouldn’t
it?"</p>

<p>"Awfully nice," he agreed weakly. He felt as though he were making
arrangements for his own funeral. Train leaves Waterloo 3.27.
No flowers...Mary was gone. No, he was blowed if he’d let himself
be hurried down to the Necropolis like this. He was blowed. The
sight of Mr. Scogan looking out, with a hungry expression, from
the drawing-room window made him precipitately hoist the "Times"
once more. For a long while he kept it hoisted. Lowering it at
last to take another cautious peep at his surroundings, he found
himself, with what astonishment! confronted by Anne’s faint, amused,
malicious smile. She was standing before him,&mdash;the woman who was
a tree,&mdash;the swaying grace of her movement arrested in a pose
that seemed itself a movement.</p>

<p>"How long have you been standing there?" he asked, when he had
done gaping at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, about half an hour, I suppose," she said airily. "You were
so very deep in your paper&mdash;head over ears &mdash;I didn’t like
to disturb you."</p>

<p>"You look lovely this morning," Denis exclaimed. It was the first
time he had ever had the courage to utter a personal remark of
the kind.</p>

<p>Anne held up her hand as though to ward off a blow. "Don’t bludgeon
me, please." She sat down on the bench beside him. He was a nice
boy, she thought, quite charming; and Gombauld’s violent insistences
were really becoming rather tiresome. "Why don’t you wear white
trousers?" she asked. "I like you so much in white trousers."</p>

<p>"They’re at the wash," Denis replied rather curtly. This white-trouser
business was all in the wrong spirit. He was just preparing a
scheme to manoeuvre the conversation back to the proper path,
when Mr. Scogan suddenly darted out of the house, crossed the
terrace with clockwork rapidity, and came to a halt in front of
the bench on which they were seated.</p>

<p>"To go on with our interesting conversation about the cosmos,"
he began, "I become more and more convinced that the various parts
of the concern are fundamentally discrete...But would you mind,
Denis, moving a shade to your right?" He wedged himself between
them on the bench. "And if you would shift a few inches to the
left, my dear Anne...Thank you. Discrete, I think, was what I
was saying."</p>

<p>"You were," said Anne. Denis was speechless.</p>

<p>They were taking their after luncheon coffee in the library when
the telegram arrived. Denis blushed guiltily as he took the orange
envelope from the salver and tore it open. "Return at once. Urgent
family business." It was too ridiculous. As if he had any family
business! Wouldn’t it be best just to crumple the thing up and
put it in his pocket without saying anything about it? He looked
up; Mary’s large blue china eyes were fixed upon him, seriously,
penetratingly. He blushed more deeply than ever, hesitated in
a horrible uncertainty.</p>

<p>"What’s your telegram about?" Mary asked significantly.</p>

<p>He lost his head, "I’m afraid," he mumbled, "I’m afraid this
means I shall have to go back to town at once." He frowned at
the telegram ferociously.</p>

<p>"But that’s absurd, impossible," cried Anne. She had been standing
by the window talking to Gombauld; but at Denis’s words she came
swaying across the room towards him.</p>

<p>"It’s urgent," he repeated desperately.</p>

<p>"But you’ve only been here such a short time," Anne protested.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, utterly miserable. Oh, if only she could understand!
Women were supposed to have intuition.</p>

<p>"If he must go, he must," put in Mary firmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must." He looked at the telegram again for inspiration.
"You see, it’s urgent family business," he explained.</p>

<p>Priscilla got up from her chair in some excitement. "I had a
distinct presentiment of this last night," she said. "A distinct
presentiment."</p>

<p>"A mere coincidence, no doubt," said Mary, brushing Mrs. Wimbush
out of the conversation. "There’s a very good train at 3.27."
She looked at the clock on the mantelpiece. "You’ll have nice
time to pack."</p>

<p>"I’ll order the motor at once." Henry Wimbush rang the bell.
The funeral was well under way. It was awful, awful.</p>

<p>"I am wretched you should be going," said Anne.</p>

<p>Denis turned towards her; she really did look wretched. He abandoned
himself hopelessly, fatalistically to his destiny. This was what
came of action, of doing something decisive. If only he’d just
let things drift! If only...</p>

<p>"I shall miss your conversation," said Mr. Scogan.</p>

<p>Mary looked at the clock again. "I think perhaps you ought to
go and pack," she said.</p>

<p>Obediently Denis left the room. Never again, he said to himself,
never again would he do anything decisive. Camlet, West Bowlby,
Knipswich for Timpany, Spavin Delawarr; and then all the other
stations; and then, finally, London. The thought of the journey
appalled him. And what on earth was he going to do in London when
he got there? He climbed wearily up the stairs. It was time for
him to lay himself in his coffin.</p>

<p>The car was at the door&mdash;the hearse. The whole party had assembled
to see him go. Good-bye, good-bye. Mechanically he tapped the
barometer that hung in the porch; the needle stirred perceptibly
to the left. A sudden smile lighted up his lugubrious face.</p>

<p>"‘It sinks and I am ready to depart,’" he said, quoting Landor
with an exquisite aptness. He looked quickly round from face to
face. Nobody had noticed. He climbed into the hearse.</p>
