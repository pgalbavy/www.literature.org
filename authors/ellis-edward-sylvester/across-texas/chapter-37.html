<p>AT <em>THE </em>earliest streaking of gray in the eastern horizon
the three men and Herbert Watrous, all of whom had been sleeping
fitfully by turns through the long dismal hours, silently rose
to their feet and walked to where the ponies, a short distance
off, had resumed their cropping of the grass. They were thirsty,
like their masters, but no water was within reach, and they were
doing their best to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p>The outlines of the old adobe mission building showed faintly
through the obscurity as the little party headed westward, and
advanced at a moderate walk, on the alert for the Apaches, of
whom they had detected signs now and then during their wearisome
watching.</p>

<p>The action of the red men had puzzled the trapper as well as
Strubell and Lattin. It was hard to understand why they had not
stumbled on the truth, but there was good reason for believing
they were still ignorant of the presence of the white men so near
them. It was upon this theory that the success of the daring enterprise
was based.</p>

<p>Eph Bozeman placed himself at the head, Herbert coming next,
with one of the Texans on either side. The veteran was the best
qualified to lead, while the disposition of all was with a view
of protecting the younger and less experienced member of the party.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of their enemies until half the distance was
passed, when Lattin, who was on Herbert’s right, exclaimed in
an undertone:</p>

<p>"Yonder are the varmints!"</p>

<p>The horses were in excellent condition because of their long
rest, and up to this moment moved at a moderate trot. As the Texan
spoke, the trapper, who had detected the danger, struck his animal
into a brisk gallop, the others doing the same without any urging
of their riders.</p>

<p>The Apaches must have relaxed their vigilance toward the latter
part of the night, for most, if not all the group, were observed
to the south of the structure instead of being near it. They were
closer to it, however, than the whites, and showed their daring
by immediately riding forward to meet them.</p>

<p>The trapper turned his head and said: "Let ‘em have it the minute
they’re near enough to hit."</p>

<p>These were words which had meaning, and Herbert, like his companions,
looked at his Winchester to make sure it was ready for instant
service.</p>

<p>"I think they’re all there," added Lattin.</p>

<p>"I don’t believe it," remarked Strubell, "for there isn’t more
than six or eight."</p>

<p>"And Nick isn’t with them," Herbert could not help exclaiming,
with a thrill of pleasure.</p>

<p>No reply followed this, which might signify nothing, for all
were too intent on what was before them.</p>

<p>The interest deepened each moment. The Apaches, numbering exactly
eight, were advancing at a speed fully as great as that of the
whites, riding close together and apparently all eagerness for
the conflict. They indulged in no shouts, whoops, or gestures,
but came on like the grim demons they were.</p>

<p>Each carried his gun, and he was not afraid to use it whenever
the chance offered. Nothing could have looked more frightful than
they, their chests naked, their irregular features daubed with
different colored paint, their long black hair dangling about
their shoulders, while each rode like a centaur.</p>

<p>A distance of two hundred yards separated the parties, neither
of which had made the slightest variation in its course. Our friends
were heading directly toward the building and did not swerve to
the right or left. To have done so would have shown fear, and
brought the redskins down upon them like a cyclone.</p>

<p>One of two things was inevitable, and that within the space of
a few seconds: the Apaches or white men must turn to one side,
or there would be a fierce fight. Eph Bozeman and his comrades
were resolved to keep on until the noses of their ponies should
touch. What was the purpose of the red men must appear immediately.</p>

<p>The break came from an unexpected source. Belden Rickard and
Harman Slidham had not forgotten the parting words of the trapper,
and were on the watch at the upper front windows. The rapidly
increasing light showed the four horsemen coming down the slope,
and they saw the Apaches set out to meet them. Matters were on
the eve of explosion when Rickard took deliberate sight from his
window and fired at the warriors. The shot was a long one, but
so accurately aimed that a dusky horseman, with a rasping screech,
rolled off his pony, the animal breaking into a gallop, circling
away from the others, and, facing toward the building, whinneying
with fright and dashing aimlessly hither and thither in a panic.</p>

<p>The other Apaches acted as if the report of the gun was the signal
for them to break apart, for they did so with a suddenness that
could not have been surpassed had a bombshell burst beneath them.</p>

<p>Several turned to the right and others to the left, while one,
as if he absolutely feared nothing, headed his black pony directly
at Bozeman and thundered forward on a dead run.</p>

<p>The miscreant was actually charging the whole party.</p>

<p>He emitted a terrifying whoop, leaning almost on his horse’s
ears, as he brought his rifle round in front to fire, but a master
hand at that business had not taken his eye from him since he
started on his daring ride. The raising of the gun and the aiming
and firing seemed to take place all together, and in the twinkling
of an eye.</p>

<p>"Thar’s one fool less," was the quiet remark of Eph as he lowered
his piece; "now, boys, grab ground."</p>

<p>His pony was stretching away at headlong speed for the building,
the others imitating him so quickly that the four continued in
a bunch. "Keep it up," he added, firing again at their assailants.</p>

<p>Strubell and Lattin discharged their pieces as often as they
could take any sort of aim, but the conditions were against accuracy,
and there was no evidence that they did any execution.</p>

<p>The Apaches had branched off to the right and left, and kept
popping away, with no more success than the white men. They held
the marksmanship of the others in such fear that they gave much
effort to screening their bodies, by flinging themselves over
the sides of their animals and firing from under the neck or directly
over it, where little could be seen of the riders except their
glaring eyes and their hair, looking as if they were a part of
the mane of their ponies, or the black eyes flashed for a moment
in front of the breast of the galloping steeds.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Herbert Watrous felt pleasant when he
heard the bullets singing about his ears, and knew that more than
one was aimed at him. He did not attempt to reply, but gave his
whole attention to urging Jill to his utmost. The building was
only a short way off, and the briefest kind of a respite insured
safety.</p>

<p>Fortunately his steed was fully the equal of the others in fleetness
and did not fall behind. Had it done so he would not have been
left by his friends, for all were governed by that devotion which
belongs to the highest form of chivalry. There was not one who
would not have protected the youth with his life.</p>

<p>Suddenly the broad door at the front of the adobe building was
drawn inward. Rickard and Slidham had hurried down to make sure
no delay took place at this critical moment.</p>

<p>Herbert Watrous was leaning forward, with his eyes fixed on the
avenue to safety, when he felt Jill shudder under the saddle,
as if with a sudden chill. He veered to one side, throwing his
nose against the shoulder of the trapper’s pony, and staggered
uncertainly in the hopeless effort to recover himself, but, unable
to do so, plunged forward on his knees and rolled over on his
side, gasping his last breath.</p>
