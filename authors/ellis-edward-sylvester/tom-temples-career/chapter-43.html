<p>"<em>NATHAN," </em>asked Mrs. Middleton, "have you ever heard
anything of our old boarder, Tom Temple?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, except that he went to California in the steerage,
I believe. I suspect he was very destitute."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," said Mrs. Middleton emphatically. "It does
me good to see pride have a fall, and that boy was the proudest
upstart I ever met."</p>

<p>"He certainly had a great appetite, my dear, and was very particular
about his accommodations."</p>

<p>"To think of his insisting on a mattress! Really, Nathan, we
were fools to give up to him."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, we got very high board for him."</p>

<p>"Very true; I wouldn’t have stood his impudence otherwise. Squire
Davenport’s family got disgusted with him. He put on his airs
even with them. So he went in the steerage, did he?"</p>

<p>"So I heard."</p>

<p>"I warrant he would have been glad to get back to our home, much
as he turned up his nose at it."</p>

<p>Here there was a knock at the door, and a minute later the servant
entered, ushering in our hero.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated Mr. Middleton. "Is it you, Thomas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Tom; "here I am, alive and kicking. I didn’t
think you’d remember me. How do you do, Mrs. Middleton?"</p>

<p>"I am well," said the lady stiffly.</p>

<p>"I thought you were in California, Thomas," said Mr. Middleton.</p>

<p>"So I was."</p>

<p>"We heard that you were reduced to going by steerage," remarked
Mrs. Middleton with spiteful triumph.</p>

<p>"You were misinformed," said Tom coolly, "I went first-class,
and returned in the same way."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed. I heard that you had a few hundred dollars left.
You must have spent it all by this time."</p>

<p>"You will doubtless be glad to learn that I have got my fortune
all back," said Tom, glancing mischievously at the faces of his
friends, in which surprise contended with mortification.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" ejaculated Mr. Middleton.</p>

<p>"Quite so. The ship supposed to be lost has returned; Mr. Armstrong
has recovered sufficiently to pay me back my ten thousand dollars,
and the mining stock turns out to be good. Besides that I have
been adopted by a rich man, who has made me his heir."</p>

<p>"My dear Tom," exclaimed Mr. Middleton, whose opinion of our
hero had risen about a hundred degrees, "permit me to congratulate
you. I always felt a deep, a paternal interest in the welfare
of my dear friend’s son. I am truly glad to hear that your fortune
is recovered. If you would be content again to share our humble
home, we would gladly receive you back on the same terms as before."
And he pressed Tom’s hand very cordially.</p>

<p>"Mr. Temple," said Mrs. Middleton, her face wreathed in smiles,
"won’t you stay to dinner at least? I shall be truly glad to have
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom. "Since you are so pressing I will; but
I am afraid I can’t come back to board, as my uncle wishes me
to reside with him."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Middleton could express his disappointment, Squire
Davenport was ushered into the room. He stopped short at the sight
of Tom, and frowned slightly, looking to Mr. Middleton for an
explanation.</p>

<p>"Squire Davenport," said Nathan, "you will be glad to hear that
our young friend has recovered his fortune. Indeed he tells me
that he is richer than ever. Isn’t it so, Thomas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I believe so."</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said the squire, pausing long enough to change his voice
and expression. "I am very glad to hear it. Master Temple, you
were once intimate at my house. Won’t you come to tea this evening?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom demurely, "if you think it will be agreeable
to your family."</p>

<p>"They will all be delighted to see you," said the squire hastily.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I’ll come," said Tom.</p>

<p>To judge by Tom’s reception, all the Davenports were very fond
of him. And yet the day before they would have vied with one another
in speaking contemptuously of him. But <em>then</em> he was supposed
to be poor. Now he was master of one fortune, and heir to another.
It is only the way of the world.</p>

<p>There was one of the family whom Tom was really glad to meet,
and that was Mary Somers, to whom he paid much more attention
than to Imogene, greatly to the latter’s disgust. Poor Mary had
to submit to more than one covert sneer, but Tom paid his chief
attention to her for all that.</p>

<p>Ten years have passed by. Tom is a young merchant, bold, enterprising
and successful. Mary Somers is his wife, and Mr. Stoddard, happy
in their love and respect, lives with them. The Davenports are
proud of their connection with their once despised poor relation,
and thankfully accept her invitations. Imogene is unmarried and
is likely to become a sour old maid. James Davenport is a clerk
in the employ of Tom, through poverty being forced to work, very
much to his disgust. Mr. and Mrs. Middleton still live. They have
become more penurious than ever, but their opinion of Tom has
changed. "My dear young friend, Tom Temple, once an inmate of
my family," says Nathan, and his wife echoes it. How gold reveals
the virtues of those about us! As for Tom, he has greatly improved.
The bold, aggressive qualities which once made him a bully have
been diverted to business, and have made him energetic and enterprising.
So we leave him better than we found him, and with every prospect
of a happy and prosperous career.</p>
