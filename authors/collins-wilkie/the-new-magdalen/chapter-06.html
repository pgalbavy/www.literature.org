<P>
IT is a glorious winter's day. The sky is clear, the frost is
hard, the ice bears for skating.
<P>
The dining-room of the ancient mansion called Mablethorpe House,
situated in the London suburb of Kensington, is famous among
artists and other persons of taste for the carved wood-work, of
Italian origin, which covers the walls on three sides. On the
fourth side the march of modern improvement has broken in, and
has va ried and brightened the scene by means of a conservatory,
forming an entrance to the room through a winter-garden of rare
plants and flowers. On your right hand, as you stand fronting the
conservatory, the monotony of the paneled wall is relieved by a
quaintly patterned door of old inlaid wood, leading into the
library, and thence, across the great hall, to the other
reception-rooms of the house. A corresponding door on the left
hand gives access to the billiard-room, to the smoking-room next
to it, and to a smaller hall commanding one of the secondary
entrances to the building. On the left side also is the ample
fireplace, surmounted by its marble mantelpiece, carved in the
profusely and confusedly ornate style of eighty years since. To
the educated eye the dining-room, with its modern furniture and
conservatory, its ancient walls and doors, and its lofty
mantelpiece (neither very old nor very new), presents a
startling, almost a revolutionary, mixture of the decorative
workmanship of widely differing schools. To the ignorant eye the
one result produced is an impression of perfect luxury and
comfort, united in the friendliest combination, and developed on
the largest scale.
<P>
The clock has just struck two. The table is spread for luncheon.
<P>
The persons seated at the table are three in number. First, Lady
Janet Roy. Second, a young lady who is her reader and companion.
Third, a guest staying in the house, who has already appeared in
these pages under the name of Horace Holmcroft--attached to the
German army as war correspondent of an English newspaper.
<P>
Lady Janet Roy needs but little introduction. Everybody with the
slightest pretension to experience in London society knows Lady
Janet Roy.
<P>
Who has not heard of her old lace and her priceless rubies? Who
has not admired her commanding figure, her beautifully dressed
white hair, her wonderful black eyes, which still preserve their
youthful brightness, after first opening on the world seventy
years since? Who has not felt the charm of her frank, easily
flowing talk, her inexhaustible spirits, her good-humored,
gracious sociability of manner? Where is the modern hermit who is
not familiarly acquainted, by hearsay at least, with the
fantastic novelty and humor of her opinions; with her generous
encouragement of rising merit of any sort, in all ranks, high or
low; with her charities, which know no distinction between abroad
and at home; with her large indulgence, which no ingratitude can
discourage, and no servility pervert? Everybody has heard of the
popular old lady--the childless widow of a long-forgotten lord.
Everybody knows Lady Janet Roy.
<P>
But who knows the handsome young woman sitting on her right hand,
playing with her luncheon instead of eating it? Nobody really
knows her.
<P>
She is prettily dressed in gray poplin, trimmed with gray velvet,
and set off by a ribbon of deep red tied in a bow at the throat.
She is nearly as tall as Lady Janet herself, and possesses a
grace and beauty of figure not always seen in women who rise
above the medium height. Judging by a certain innate grandeur in
the carriage of her head and in the expression of her large
melancholy gray eyes, believers in blood and breeding will be apt
to guess that this is another noble lady. Alas! she is nothing
but Lady Janet's companion and reader. Her head, crowned with its
lovely light brown hair, bends with a gentle respect when Lady
Janet speaks. Her fine firm hand is easily and incessantly
watchful to supply Lady Janet's slightest wants. The old
lady--affectionately familiar with her--speaks to her as she
might speak to an adopted child. But the gratitude of the
beautiful companion has always the same restraint in its
acknowledgment of kindness; the smile of the beautiful companion
has always the same underlying sadness when it responds to Lady
Janet's hearty laugh. Is there something wrong here, under the
surface? Is she suffering in mind, or suffering in body? What is
the matter with her?
<P>
The matter with her is secret remorse. This delicate and
beautiful creature pines under the slow torment of constant
self-reproach.
<P>
To the mistress of the house, and to all who inhabit it or enter
it, she is known as Grace Roseberry, the orphan relative by
marriage of Lady Janet Roy. To herself alone she is known as the
outcast of the London streets; the inmate of the London Refuge;
the lost woman who has stolen her way back--after vainly trying
to fight her way back--to Home and Name. There she sits in the
grim shadow of her own terrible secret, disguised in another
person's identity, and established in another person's place.
Mercy Merrick had only to dare, and to become Grace Roseberry if
she pleased. She has dared, and she has been Grace Roseberry for
nearly four months past.
<P>
At this moment, while Lady Janet is talking to Horace Holmcroft,
something that has passed between them has set her thinking of
the day when she took the first fatal step which committed her to
the fraud.
<P>
How marvelously easy of accomplishment the act of personation had
been! At first sight Lady Janet had yielded to the fascination of
the noble and interesting face. No need to present the stolen
letter; no need to repeat the ready-made story. The old lady had
put the letter aside unopened, and had stopped the story at the
first words. "Your face is your introduction, my dear; your
father can say nothing for you which you have not already said
for yourself." There was the welcome which established her firmly
in her false identity at the outset. Thanks to her own
experience, and thanks to the "Journal" of events at Rome,
questions about her life in Canada and questions about Colonel
Roseberry's illness found her ready with answers which (even if
suspicion had existed) would have disarmed suspicion on the spot.
While the true Grace was slowly and painfully winning her way
back to life on her bed in a German hospital, the false Grace was
presented to Lady Janet's friends as the relative by marriage of
the Mistress of Mablethorpe House. From that time forward nothing
had happened to rouse in her the faintest suspicion that Grace
Roseberry was other than a dead-and-buried woman. So far as she
now knew--so far as any one now knew--she might live out her life
in perfect security (if her conscience would let her), respected,
distinguished, and beloved, in the position which she had
usurped.
<P>
<P>
<P>
She rose abruptly from the table. The effort of her life was to
shake herself free of the remembrances which haunted her
perpetually as they were haunting her now. Her memory was her
worst enemy; her one refuge from it was in change of occupation
and change of scene.
<P>
"May I go into the conservatory, Lady Janet?" she asked.
<P>
"Certainly, my dear."
<P>
She bent her head to her protectress, looked for a moment with a
steady, compassionate attention at Horace Holmcroft, and, slowly
crossing the room, entered the winter-garden. The eyes of Horace
followed her, as long as she was in view, with a curious
contradictory expression of admiration and disapproval. When she
had passed out of sight the admiration vanished, but the
disapproval remained. The face of the young man contracted into a
frown: he sat silent, with his fork in his hand, playing absently
with the fragments on his plate.
<P>
"Take some French pie, Horace," said Lady Janet.
<P>
"No, thank you."
<P>
"Some more chicken, then?"
<P>
"No more chicken."
<P>
"Will nothing tempt you?"
<P>
"I will take some more wine, if you will allow me."
<P>
He filled his glass (for the fifth or sixth time) with claret,
and emptied it sullenly at a draught. Lady Janet's bright eyes
watched him with sardonic attention; Lady Janet's ready tongue
spoke out as freely as usual what was passing in her mind at the
time.
<P>
"The air of Kensington doesn't seem to suit you, my young
friend," she said. "The longer you have been my guest, the
oftener you fill your glass and empty your cigar-case. Those are
bad signs in a young man. When you first came here you arrived
invalided by a wound. In your place, I should not have exposed
myself to be shot, with no other object in view than describing a
battle in a newspaper. I suppose tastes differ. Are you ill? Does
your wound sti ll plague you?"
<P>
"Not in the least."
<P>
"Are you out of spirits?"
<P>
Horace Holmcroft dropped his fork, rested his elbows on the
table, and answered:
<P>
"Awfully."
<P>
Even Lady Janet's large toleration had its limits. It embraced
every human offense except a breach of good manners. She snatched
up the nearest weapon of correction at hand--a tablespoon--and
rapped her young friend smartly with it on the arm that was
nearest to her.
<P>
"My table is not the club table," said the old lady. "Hold up
your head. Don't look at your fork--look at me. I allow nobody to
be out of spirits in My house. I consider it to be a reflection
on Me. If our quiet life here doesn't suit you, say so plainly,
and find something else to do. There is employment to be had, I
suppose--if you choose to apply for it? You needn't smile. I
don't want to see your teeth--I want an answer."
<P>
Horace admitted, with all needful gravity, that there was
employment to be had. The war between France and Germany, he
remarked, was still going on: the newspaper had offered to employ
him again in the capacity of correspondent.
<P>
"Don't speak of the newspapers and the war!" cried Lady Janet,
with a sudden explosion of anger, which was genuine anger this
time. "I detest the newspapers! I won't allow the newspapers to
enter this house. I lay the whole blame of the blood shed between
France and Germany at their door."
<P>
Horace's eyes opened wide in amazement. The old lady was
evidently in earnest. "What can you possibly mean?" he asked.
"Are the newspapers responsible for the war?"
<P>
"Entirely responsible, "answered Lady Janet. "Why, you don't
understand the age you live in! Does anybody do anything nowadays
(fighting included) without wishing to see it in the newspapers?
_I_ subscribe to a charity; _thou_ art presented with a
testimonial; _he_ preaches a sermon; _we_ suffer a grievance;
_you_ make a discovery; _they_ go to church and get married. And
I, thou, he; we, you, they, all want one and the same thing--we
want to see it in the papers. Are kings, soldiers, and
diplomatists exceptions to the general rule of humanity? Not
they! I tell you seriously, if the newspapers of Europe had one
and all decided not to take the smallest notice in print of the
war between France and Germany, it is my firm conviction the war
would have come to an end for want of encouragement long since.
Let the pen cease to advertise the sword, and I, for one, can see
the result. No report--no fighting."
<P>
"Your views have the merit of perfect novelty, ma'am," said
Horace. "Would you object to see them in the newspapers?"
<P>
Lady Janet worsted her young friend with his own weapons.
<P>
"Don't I live in the latter part of the nineteenth century?" she
asked. "In the newspapers, did you say? In large type, Horace, if
you love me!"
<P>
Horace changed the subject.
<P>
"You blame me for being out of spirits," he said; "and you seem
to think it is because I am tired of my pleasant life at
Mablethorpe House. I am not in the least tired, Lady Janet." He
looked toward the conservatory: the frown showed itself on his
face once more. "The truth is," he resumed, "I am not satisfied
with Grace Roseberry."
<P>
"What has Grace done?"
<P>
"She persists in prolonging our engagement. Nothing will persuade
her to fix the day for our marriage."
<P>
It was true! Mercy had been mad enough to listen to him, and to
love him. But Mercy was not vile enough to marry him under her
false character, and in her false name. Between three and four
months had elapsed since Horace had been sent home from the war,
wounded, and had found the beautiful Englishwoman whom he had
befriended in France established at Mablethorpe House. Invited to
become Lady Janet's guest (he had passed his holidays as a
school-boy under Lady Janet's roof)--free to spend the idle time
of his convalescence from morning to night in Mercy's
society--the impression originally produced on him in a French
cottage soon strengthened into love. Before the month was out
Horace had declared himself, and had discovered that he spoke to
willing ears. From that moment it was only a question of
persisting long enough in the resolution to gain his point. The
marriage engagement was ratified--most reluctantly on the lady's
side--and there the further progress of Horace Holmcroft's suit
came to an end. Try as he might, he failed to persuade his
betrothed wife to fix the day for the marriage. There were no
obstacles in her way. She had no near relations of her own to
consult. As a connection of Lady Janet's by marriage, Horace's
mother and sisters were ready to receive her with all the honors
due to a new member of the family. No pecuniary considerations
made it necessary, in this case, to wait for a favorable time.
Horace was an only son; and he had succeeded to his father's
estate with an ample income to support it. On both sides alike
there was absolutely nothing to prevent the two young people from
being married as soon as the settlements could be drawn. And yet,
to all appearance, here was a long engagement in prospect, with
no better reason than the lady's incomprehensible perversity to
explain the delay. "Can you account for Grace's conduct?" asked
Lady Janet. Her manner changed as she put the question. She
looked and spoke like a person who was perplexed and annoyed
<P>
"I hardly like to own it," Horace answered, "but I am afraid she
has some motive for deferring our marriage which she cannot
confide either to you or to me."
<P>
Lady Janet started.
<P>
"What makes you think that?" she asked.
<P>
"I have once or twice caught her in tears. Every now and
then--sometimes when she is talking quite gayly--she suddenly
changes color and becomes silent and depressed. Just now, when
she left the table (didn't you notice it?), she looked at me in
the strangest way--almost as if she was sorry for me. What do
these things mean?"
<P>
Horace's reply, instead of increasing Lady Janet's anxiety,
seemed to relieve it. He had observed nothing which she had not
noticed herself. "You foolish boy!" she said, "the meaning is
plain enough. Grace has been out of health for some time past.
The doctor recommends change of air. I shall take her away with
me."
<P>
"It would be more to the purpose," Horace rejoined, "if I took
her away with me. She might consent, if you would only use your
influence. Is it asking too much to ask you to persuade her? My
mother and my sisters have written to her, and have produced no
effect. Do me the greatest of all kindnesses--speak to her
to-day!" He paused, and possessing himself of Lady Janet's hand,
pressed it entreatingly. "You have always been so good to me," he
said, softly, and pressed it again.
<P>
The old lady looked at him. It was impossible to dispute that
there were attractions in Horace Holmcroft's face which made it
well worth looking at. Many a woman might have envied him his
clear complexion, his bright blue eyes, and the warm amber tint
in his light Saxon hair. Men--especially men skilled in observing
physiognomy--might have noticed in the shape of his forehead and
in the line of his upper lip the signs indicative of a moral
nature deficient in largeness and breadth--of a mind easily
accessible to strong prejudices, and obstinate in maintaining
those prejudices in the face of conviction itself.
<P>
To the observation of women these remote defects were too far
below the surface to be visible. He charmed the sex in general by
his rare personal advantages, and by the graceful deference of
his manner. To Lady Janet he was endeared, not by his own merits
only, but by old associations that were connected with him. His
father had been one of her many admirers in her young days.
Circumstances had parted them. Her marriage to another man had
been a childless marriage. In past times, when the boy Horace had
come to her from school, she had cherished a secret fancy (too
absurd to be communicated to any living creature) that he ought
to have been _her_ son, and might have been her son, if she had
married his father! She smiled charmingly, old as she was--she
yielded as his mother might have yielded--when the young man took
her hand and entreated her to interest herself in his marriage.
"Must I really speak to Grace?" she asked , with a gentleness of
tone and manner far from characteristic, on ordinary occasions,
of the lady of Mablethorpe House. Horace saw that he had gained
his point. He sprang to his feet; his eyes turned eagerly in the
direction of the conservatory; his handsome face was radiant with
hope. Lady Janet (with her mind full of his father) stole a last
look at him, sighed as she thought of the vanished days, and
recovered herself.
<P>
"Go to the smoking-room," she said, giving him a push toward the
door. "Away with you, and cultivate the favorite vice of the
nineteenth century." Horace attempted to express his gratitude.
"Go and smoke!" was all she said, pushing him out. "Go and
smoke!"
<P>
Left by herself, Lady Janet took a turn in the room, and
considered a little.
<P>
Horace's discontent was not unreasonable. There was really no
excuse for the delay of which he complained. Whether the young
lady had a special motive for hanging back, or whether she was
merely fretting because she did not know her own mind, it was, in
either case, necessary to come to a distinct understanding,
sooner or later, on the serious question of the marriage. The
difficulty was, how to approach the subject without giving
offense. "I don't understand the young women of the present
generation," thought Lady Janet. "In my time, when we were fond
of a man, we were ready to marry him at a moment's notice. And
this is an age of progress! They ought to be readier still."
<P>
Arriving, by her own process of induction, at this inevitable
conclusion, she decided to try what her influence could
accomplish, and to trust to the inspiration of the moment for
exerting it in the right way. "Grace!" she called out,
approaching the conservatory door. The tall, lithe figure in its
gray dress glided into view, and stood relieved against the green
background of the winter-garden.
<P>
"Did your ladyship call me?"
<P>
"Yes; I want to speak to you. Come and sit down by me."
<P>
With those words Lady Janet led the way to a sofa, and placed her
companion by her side.
