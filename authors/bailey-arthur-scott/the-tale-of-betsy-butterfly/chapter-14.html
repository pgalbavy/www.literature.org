<p>AS time passed, Betsy continued to see a great deal of Joseph Bumble.
And she noticed one peculiar thing: Although he talked continually of
his cousin Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's son, no one had ever seen the
two together.
</p>
<p>"How does it happen," she asked Joseph at last, "that I never find you
with your cousin? Aren't you friends?"
</p><p>"We're certainly not <u>enemies</u>," said Joseph Bumble, "though I must
admit that we're not quite so intimate as we might be. You see, Buster
and I have different tastes. And now that the red clover is in blossom
he spends all his time in the clover field. But as you know, like you I
am very fond of flowers. And I'd far rather be here in the meadow--or
the flower garden--with you, than in the clover patch with Buster
Bumblebee."
</p><p>Naturally such an answer was bound to please Betsy Butterfly. And after
that she bothered her head no more about the friendship between the two
cousins. Certainly Joseph Bumble's explanation sounded reasonable. And
she had no cause to doubt his statement.
</p><p>Meanwhile there were others among Betsy Butterfly's admirers who became
very peevish on observing how much time Betsy and the newcomer in the
neighborhood, Joseph Bumble, were spending in each other's society. And
they agreed among themselves that something ought to be done to put an
end to the upstart Bumble's boasting.
</p><p>"Betsy Butterfly thinks the fellow is a cousin of Buster Bumblebee's,"
said Chirpy Cricket. "But I've noticed that he and Buster are never
together. Let's ask Buster to come over to the meadow so that he may
meet this cousin of his! And then perhaps we'll learn something more
about Joseph Bumble than we know now."
</p><p>Everybody said that that was a good plan. And Betsy's admirers chose
Daddy Longlegs to call on Buster Bumblebee and invite him to a party to
be given in the meadow the following day.
</p><p>Daddy Longlegs agreed to do the errand, in spite of the fact that for
him it was half a day's journey to the Bumblebee's home from the stone
wall where he lived. But he thought that by hurrying he ought to be able
to get back in time to put on his best coat and go to the party, though
he might arrive somewhat late.
</p><p>"Don't forget to ask Betsy Butterfly to the party!" Daddy called, as he
started off on his long trip.
</p><p>"Don't worry! I'll attend to that myself," Chirpy Cricket promised.
</p><p>"And don't forget to invite Joseph Bumble!" Daddy cautioned him.
</p><p>"Oh! we don't need to ask him," said Chirpy Cricket. "<u>He'll</u> come
without being invited, unless I'm greatly mistaken."
</p><hr/>
<p>Luckily for Daddy Longlegs there was not a breath of wind either that
day or the following one. So he made excellent time to the Bumblebee
home, where he found Buster Bumblebee and gave him his invitation. Then
Daddy turned around and started back towards his stone wall. Buster
Bumblebee had promised to come to the party. And Daddy wanted to be
present when the two cousins, Buster Bumblebee and Joseph Bumble,
met--with Betsy Butterfly right there to watch them.
