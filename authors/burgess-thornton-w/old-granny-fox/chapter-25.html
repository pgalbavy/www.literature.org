Dark deeds are done in the stilly night,<br/>
And who shall say if they're wrong or right?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>It all depends on how you look at things. Of course, Granny and
Reddy Fox had no business to be in Farmer Brown's henhouse in
the middle of the night, or at any other time, for that matter.
That is, they had no business to be there, as Farmer Brown would
look at the matter. He would have called them two red thieves.
Perhaps that is just what they were. But looking at the matter
as they did, I am not so sure about it. To Granny and Reddy Fox
those hens were simply big, rather stupid birds, splendid eating
if they could be caught, and bound to be eaten by somebody. The
fact that they were in Farmer Brown's henhouse didn't make them
his any more than the fact that Mrs. Grouse was in a part of the
Green Forest owned by Farmer Brown made her his.</p>

<p>You see, among the little meadow and forest people there is no
such thing as property rights, excepting in the matter of storehouses,
and because these hens were alive, it didn't occur to Granny and
Reddy that the henhouse was a sort of storehouse. It would have
made no difference if it had. Among the little people it is considered
quite right to help yourself from another's storehouse if you
are smart enough to find it and really need the food.</p>

<p>Besides, Reddy and Granny knew that Fanner Brown and his boy
would eat some of those hens themselves, and they didn't begin
to need them as Reddy and Granny did. So as they looked at the
matter, there was nothing wrong in being in that henhouse in the
middle of the night. They were there simply because they needed
food very, very much, and food was there.</p>

<p>They stared up at the roosts where the biddies were huddled together,
fast asleep. They were too high up to be reached from the floor
even when Reddy and Granny stood on their hind legs and stretched
as far as they could.</p>

<p>"We've got to wake them up and scare them so that some of the
silly things will fly down where we can catch them," said Reddy,
licking his lips hungrily.</p>

<p>"That won't do at all!" snapped Granny. "They would make a great
racket and waken Bowser the Hound, and he would waken his master,
and that is just what we mustn't do if we hope to ever get in
here again. I thought you had more sense, Reddy."</p>

<p>Reddy looked a little shamefaced. "Well, if we don't do that,
how are we going to get them? We can't fly," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"You stay right here where you are," snapped Granny, "and take
care that you don't make a sound."</p>

<p>Then Granny jumped lightly to a little shelf that ran along in
front of the nesting boxes. From this she could reach the lower
roost on which four fat hens were asleep. Very gently she pushed
her head in between two of these and crowded them apart. Sleepily
they protested and moved along a little. Granny continued to crowd
them. At last one of them stretched out her head to see who was
crowding so. Like a flash Granny seized that head, and biddy never
knew what had wakened her, nor did she have a chance to waken
the others.</p>

<p>Dropping this hen at Reddy's feet, Granny crowded another until
she did the same thing, and just the same thing happened once
more. Then Granny jumped lightly down, picked up one of the hens
by the neck, slung the body over her shoulder, and told Reddy
to do the same with the other and start for home.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to get any more while we have the chance?"
grumbled Reddy.</p>

<p>"Enough is enough," retorted Granny. "We've got a dinner for
two, and so far no one is any the wiser. Perhaps these two won't
be missed, and we'll have a chance to get some more another night.
Now come on."</p>

<p>This was plain common sense, and Reddy knew it, so without another
word he followed old Granny Fox out by the way they had entered,
and then home to the best dinner he had had for a long long time.</p>
