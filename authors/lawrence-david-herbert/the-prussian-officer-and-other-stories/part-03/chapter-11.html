<p>He went up the road in an agony, not knowing what it was all about,
but feeling as if a red-hot iron were gripped round his chest.
Without thinking, he shook two or three tears on to the snow.  Yet
in his mind he did not believe his mother would die.  He was in the
grip of some greater consciousness.  As he sat in the hall of the
vicarage, waiting whilst Mary put things for Louisa into a bag, he
wondered why he had been so upset.  He felt abashed and humbled by
the big house, he felt again as if he were one of the rank and
file.  When Miss Mary spoke to him, he almost saluted.</p>

<p>&quot;An honest man,&quot; thought Mary.  And the patronage was applied as
salve to her own sickness.  She had station, so she could
patronize: it was almost all that was left to her.  But she could
not have lived without having a certain position.  She could never
have trusted herself outside a definite place, nor respected
herself except as a woman of superior class.</p>

<p>As Alfred came to the latch-gate, he felt the grief at his heart
again, and saw the new heavens.  He stood a moment looking
northward to the Plough climbing up the night, and at the far
glimmer of snow in distant fields.  Then his grief came on like
physical pain.  He held tight to the gate, biting his mouth,
whispering &quot;Mother!&quot;  It was a fierce, cutting, physical pain of
grief, that came on in bouts, as his mother's pain came on in
bouts, and was so acute he could scarcely keep erect.  He did not
know where it came from, the pain, nor why.  It had nothing to do
with his thoughts.  Almost it had nothing to do with him.  Only it
gripped him and he must submit.  The whole tide of his soul,
gathering in its unknown towards this expansion into death, carried
him with it helplessly, all the fritter of his thought and
consciousness caught up as nothing, the heave passing on towards
its breaking, taking him further than he had ever been.  When the
young man had regained himself, he went indoors, and there he was
almost gay.  It seemed to excite him.  He felt in high spirits: he
made whimsical fun of things.  He sat on one side of his mother's
bed, Louisa on the other, and a certain gaiety seized them all.
But the night and the dread was coming on.</p>

<p>Alfred kissed his mother and went to bed.  When he was half
undressed the knowledge of his mother came upon him, and the
suffering seized him in its grip like two hands, in agony.  He lay
on the bed screwed up tight.  It lasted so long, and exhausted him
so much, that he fell asleep, without having the energy to get up
and finish undressing.  He awoke after midnight to find himself
stone cold.  He undressed and got into bed, and was soon asleep
again.</p>

<p>At a quarter to six he woke, and instantly remembered.  Having
pulled on his trousers and lighted a candle, he went into his
mother's room.  He put his hand before the candle flame so that no
light fell on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother!&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p>There was a hesitation.</p>

<p>&quot;Should I go to work?&quot;</p>

<p>He waited, his heart was beating heavily.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'd go, my lad.&quot;</p>

<p>His heart went down in a kind of despair.</p>

<p>&quot;You want me to?&quot;</p>

<p>He let his hand down from the candle flame.  The light fell on the
bed.  There he saw Louisa lying looking up at him.  Her eyes were
upon him.  She quickly shut her eyes and half buried her face in
the pillow, her back turned to him.  He saw the rough hair like
bright vapour about her round head, and the two plaits flung coiled
among the bedclothes.  It gave him a shock.  He stood almost
himself, determined.  Louisa cowered down.  He looked, and met his
mother's eyes.  Then he gave way again, and ceased to be sure,
ceased to be himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, go to work, my boy,&quot; said the mother.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied he, kissing her.  His heart was down at
despair, and bitter.  He went away.</p>

<p>&quot;Alfred!&quot; cried his mother faintly.</p>

<p>He came back with beating heart.</p>

<p>&quot;What, mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll always do what's right, Alfred?&quot; the mother asked, beside
herself in terror now he was leaving her.  He was too terrified and
bewildered to know what she meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>She turned her cheek to him.  He kissed her, then went away, in
bitter despair.  He went to work.</p>
