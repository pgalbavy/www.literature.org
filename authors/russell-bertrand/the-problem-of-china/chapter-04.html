<p>The position of China among the nations of the world is quite
peculiar, because in population and potential strength China is
the greatest nation in the world, while in actual strength at
the moment it is one of the least. The international problems
raised by this situation have been brought into the forefront
of world-politics by the Washington Conference. What settlement,
if any, will ultimately be arrived at, it is as yet impossible
to foresee. There are, however, certain broad facts and principles
which no wise solution can ignore, for which I shall try to give
the evidence in the course of the following chapters, but which
it may be as well to state briefly at the outset. First, the Chinese,
though as yet incompetent in politics and backward in economic
development, have, in other respects, a civilization at least
as good as our own, containing elements which the world greatly
needs, and which we shall destroy at our peril. Secondly, the
Powers have inflicted upon China a multitude of humiliations and
disabilities, for which excuses have been found in China's misdeeds,
but for which the sole real reason has been China's military and
naval weakness. Thirdly, the best of the Great Powers at present,
in relation to China, is America, and the worst is Japan; in the
interests of China, as well as in our own larger interests, it
is an immense advance that we have ceased to support Japan and
have ranged ourselves on the side of America, in so far as America
stands for Chinese freedom, but not when Japanese freedom is threatened.
Fourthly, in the long run, the Chinese cannot escape economic
domination by foreign Powers unless China becomes military or
the foreign Powers become Socialistic, because the capitalist
system involves in its very essence a predatory relation of the
strong towards the weak, internationally as well as nationally.
A strong military China would be a disaster; therefore Socialism
in Europe and America affords the only ultimate solution.</p>

<p>After these preliminary remarks, I come to the theme of this
chapter, namely, the present internal condition of China.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, China, after having an Emperor for forty centuries,
decided, eleven years ago, to become a modern democratic republic.
Many causes led up to this result. Passing over the first 3,700
years of Chinese history, we arrive at the Manchu conquest in
1644, when a warlike invader from the north succeeded in establishing
himself upon the Dragon Throne. He set to work to induce Chinese
men to wear pigtails and Chinese women to have big feet. After
a time a statesmanlike compromise was arranged: pigtails were
adopted but big feet were rejected; the new absurdity was accepted
and the old one retained. This characteristic compromise shows
how much England and China have in common.</p>

<p>The Manchu Emperors soon became almost completely Chinese, but
differences of dress and manners kept the Manchus distinct from
the more civilized people whom they had conquered, and the Chinese
remained inwardly hostile to them. From 1840 to 1900, a series
of disastrous foreign wars, culminating in the humiliation of
the Boxer time, destroyed the prestige of the Imperial Family
and showed all thoughtful people the need of learning from Europeans.
The Taiping rebellion, which lasted for 15 years (1849-64), is
thought by Putnam Weale to have diminished the population by 150
millions,[31] and was almost as terrible a business as the Great
War. For a long time it seemed doubtful whether the Manchus could
suppress it, and when at last they succeeded (by the help of Gordon)
their energy was exhausted. The defeat of China by Japan (1894-5)
and the vengeance of the Powers after the Boxer rising (1900)
finally opened the eyes of all thoughtful Chinese to the need
for a better and more modern government than that of the Imperial
Family. But things move slowly in China, and it was not till eleven
years after the Boxer movement that the revolution broke out.</p>

<p>The revolution of 1911, in China, was a moderate one, similar
in spirit to ours of 1688. Its chief promoter, Sun Yat Sen, now
at the head of the Canton Government, was supported by the Republicans,
and was elected provisional President. But the Nothern Army remained
faithful to the dynasty, and could probably have defeated the
revolutionaries. Its Commander-in-Chief, Yuan Shih-k'ai, however,
hit upon a better scheme. He made peace with the revolutionaries
and acknowledged the Republic, on condition that he should be
the first President instead of Sun Yat Sen. Yuan Shih-k'ai was,
of course, supported by the Legations, being what is called a
"strong man," <em>i.e.</em> a believer in blood and iron, not
likely to be led astray by talk about democracy or freedom. In
China, the North has always been more military and less liberal
than the South, and Yuan Shih-k'ai had created out of Northern
troops whatever China possessed in the way of a modern army. As
he was also ambitious and treacherous, he had every quality needed
for inspiring confidence in the diplomatic corps. In view of the
chaos which has existed since his death, it must be admitted,
however, that there was something to be said in favour of his
policy and methods.</p>

<p>A Constituent Assembly, after enacting a provisional constitution,
gave place to a duly elected Parliament, which met in April 1913
to determine the permanent constitution. Yuan soon began to quarrel
with the Parliament as to the powers of the President, which the
Parliament wished to restrict. The majority in Parliament was
opposed to Yuan, but he had the preponderance in military strength.
Under these circumstances, as was to be expected, constitutionalism
was soon overthrown. Yuan made himself financially independent
of Parliament (which had been duly endowed with the power of the
purse) by unconstitutionally concluding a loan with the foreign
banks. This led to a revolt of the South, which, however, Yuan
quickly suppressed. After this, by various stages, he made himself
virtually absolute ruler of China. He appointed his army lieutenants
military governors of provinces, and sent Northern troops into
the South. His régime might have lasted but for the fact that,
in 1915, he tried to become Emperor, and was met by a successful
revolt. He died in 1916&mdash;of a broken heart, it was said.</p>

<p>Since then there has been nothing but confusion in China. The
military governors appointed by Yuan refused to submit to the
Central Government when his strong hand was removed, and their
troops terrorized the populations upon whom they were quartered.
Ever since there has been civil war, not, as a rule, for any definite
principle, but simply to determine which of various rival generals
should govern various groups of provinces. There still remains
the issue of North versus South, but this has lost most of its
constitutional significance.</p>

<p>The military governors of provinces or groups of provinces, who
are called Tuchuns, govern despotically in defiance of Peking,
and commit depredations on the inhabitants of the districts over
which they rule. They intercept the revenue, except the portions
collected and administered by foreigners, such as the salt tax.
They are nominally appointed by Peking, but in practice depend
only upon the favour of the soldiers in their provinces. The Central
Government is nearly bankrupt, and is usually unable to pay the
soldiers, who live by loot and by such portions of the Tuchun's
illgotten wealth as he finds it prudent to surrender to them.
When any faction seemed near to complete victory, the Japanese
supported its opponents, in order that civil discord might be
prolonged. While I was in Peking, the three most important Tuchuns
met there for a conference on the division of the spoils. They
were barely civil to the President and the Prime Minister, who
still officially represent China in the eyes of foreign Powers.
The unfortunate nominal Government was obliged to pay to these
three worthies, out of a bankrupt treasury, a sum which the newspapers
stated to be nine million dollars, to secure their departure from
the capital. The largest share went to Chang-tso-lin, the Viceroy
of Manchuria and commonly said to be a tool of Japan. His share
was paid to cover the expenses of an expedition to Mongolia, which
had revolted; but no one for a moment supposed that he would undertake
such an expedition, and in fact he has remained at Mukden ever
since.[32]</p>

<p>In the extreme south, however, there has been established a Government
of a different sort, for which it is possible to have some respect.
Canton, which has always been the centre of Chinese radicalism,
succeeded, in the autumn of 1920, in throwing off the tyranny
of its Northern garrison and establishing a progressive efficient
Government under the Presidency of Sun Yat Sen. This Government
now embraces two provinces, Kwangtung (of which Canton is the
capital) and Kwangsi. For a moment it seemed likely to conquer
the whole of the South, but it has been checked by the victories
of the Northern General Wu-Pei-Fu in the neighbouring province
of Hunan. Its enemies allege that it cherishes designs of conquest,
and wishes to unite all China under its sway.[33] In all ascertainable
respects it is a Government which deserves the support of all
progressive people. Professor Dewey, in articles in the <em>New
Republic</em>, has set forth its merits, as well as the bitter
enmity which it has encountered from Hong-Kong and the British
generally. This opposition is partly on general principles, because
we dislike radical reform, partly because of the Cassel agreement.
This agreement&mdash;of a common type in China&mdash;would have given us
a virtual monopoly of the railways and mines in the province of
Kwangtung. It had been concluded with the former Government, and
only awaited ratification, but the change of Government has made
ratification impossible. The new Government, very properly, is
befriended by the Americans, and one of them, Mr. Shank, concluded
an agreement with the new Government more or less similar to that
which we had concluded with the old one. The American Government,
however, did not support Mr. Shank, whereas the British Government
did support the Cassel agreement. Meanwhile we have lost a very
valuable though very iniquitous concession, merely because we,
but not the Americans, prefer what is old and corrupt to what
is vigorous and honest. I understand, moreover, that the Shank
agreement lapsed because Mr. Shank could not raise the necessary
capital.</p>

<p>The anarchy in China is, of course, very regrettable, and every
friend of China must hope that it will be brought to an end. But
it would be a mistake to exaggerate the evil, or to suppose that
it is comparable in magnitude to the evils endured in Europe.
China must not be compared to a single European country, but to
Europe as a whole. In <em>The Times</em> of November 11, 1921,
I notice a pessimistic article headed: "The Peril of China. A
dozen rival Governments." But in Europe there are much more than
a dozen Governments, and their enmities are much fiercer than
those of China. The number of troops in Europe is enormously greater
than in China, and they are infinitely better provided with weapons
of destruction. The amount of fighting in Europe since the Armistice
has been incomparably more than the amount in China during the
same period. You may travel through China from end to end, and
it is ten to one that you will see no signs of war. Chinese battles
are seldom bloody, being fought by mercenary soldiers who take
no interest in the cause for which they are supposed to be fighting.
I am inclined to think that the inhabitants of China, at the present
moment, are happier, on the average, than the inhabitants of Europe
taken as a whole.</p>

<p>It is clear, I think, that political reform in China, when it
becomes possible, will have to take the form of a federal constitution,
allowing a very large measure of autonomy to the provinces. The
division into provinces is very ancient, and provincial feeling
is strong. After the revolution, a constitution more or less resembling
our own was attempted, only with a President instead of a King.
But the successful working of a non-federal constitution requires
a homogeneous population without much local feeling, as may be
seen from our own experience in Ireland. Most progressive Chinese,
as far as I was able to judge, now favour a federal constitution,
leaving to the Central Government not much except armaments, foreign
affairs, and customs. But the difficulty of getting rid of the
existing military anarchy is very great. The Central Government
cannot disband the troops, because it cannot find the money to
pay them. It would be necessary to borrow from abroad enough money
to pay off the troops and establish them in new jobs. But it is
doubtful whether any Power or Powers would make such a loan without
exacting the sacrifice of the last remnants of Chinese independence.
One must therefore hope that somehow the Chinese will find a way
of escaping from their troubles without too much foreign assistance.</p>

<p>It is by no means impossible that one of the Tuchuns may become
supreme, and may then make friends with the constitutionalists
as the best way of consolidating his influence. China is a country
where public opinion has great weight, and where the desire to
be thought well of may quite possibly lead a successful militarist
into patriotic courses. There are, at the moment, two Tuchuns
who are more important than any of the others. These are Chang-tso-lin
and Wu-Pei-Fu, both of whom have been already mentioned. Chang-tso-lin
is supreme in Manchuria, and strong in Japanese support; he represents
all that is most reactionary in China. Wu-Pei-Fu, on the other
hand, is credited with liberal tendencies. He is an able general;
not long ago, nominally at the bidding of Peking, he established
his authority on the Yangtze and in Hunan, thereby dealing a blow
to the hopes of Canton. It is not easy to see how he could come
to terms with the Canton Government, especially since it has allied
itself with Chang-tso-lin, but in the rest of China he might establish
his authority and seek to make it permanent by being constitutional
(see Appendix). If so, China might have a breathing-space, and
a breathing-space is all that is needed.</p>

<p>The economic life of China, except in the Treaty Ports and in
a few regions where there are mines, is still wholly pre-industrial.
Peking has nearly a million inhabitants, and covers an enormous
area, owing to the fact that all the houses have only a ground
floor and are built round a courtyard. Yet it has no trams or
buses or local trains. So far as I could see, there are not more
than two or three factory chimneys in the whole town. Apart from
begging, trading, thieving and Government employment, people live
by handicrafts. The products are exquisite and the work less monotonous
than machine-minding, but the hours are long and the pay infinitesimal.</p>

<p>Seventy or eighty per cent. of the population of China are engaged
in agriculture. Rice and tea are the chief products of the south,
while wheat and other kinds of grain form the staple crops in
the north.[34] The rainfall is very great in the south, but in
the north it is only just sufficient to prevent the land from
being a desert. When I arrived in China, in the autumn of 1920,
a large area in the north, owing to drought, was afflicted with
a terrible famine, nearly as bad, probably, as the famine in Russia
in 1921. As the Bolsheviks were not concerned, foreigners had
no hesitation in trying to bring relief. As for the Chinese, they
regarded it passively as a stroke of fate, and even those who
died of it shared this view.</p>

<p>Most of the land is in the hands of peasant proprietors, who
divide their holdings among their sons, so that each man's share
becomes barely sufficient to support himself and his family. Consequently,
when the rainfall is less than usual, immense numbers perish of
starvation. It would of course be possible, for a time, to prevent
famines by more scientific methods of agriculture, and to prevent
droughts and floods by afforestation. More railways and better
roads would give a vastly improved market, and might greatly enrich
the peasants for a generation. But in the long run, if the birth-rate
is as great as is usually supposed, no permanent cure for their
poverty is possible while their families continue to be so large.
In China, Malthus's theory of population, according to many writers,
finds full scope.[35] If so, the good done by any improvement
of methods will lead to the survival of more children, involving
a greater subdivision of the land, and in the end, a return to
the same degree of poverty. Only education and a higher standard
of life can remove the fundamental cause of these evils. And popular
education, on a large scale, is of course impossible until there
is a better Government and an adequate revenue. Apart even from
these difficulties, there does not exist, as yet, a sufficient
supply of competent Chinese teachers for a system of universal
elementary education.</p>

<p>Apart from war, the impact of European civilization upon the
traditional life of China takes two forms, one commercial, the
other intellectual. Both depend upon the prestige of armaments;
the Chinese would never have opened either their ports to our
trade or their minds to our ideas if we had not defeated them
in war. But the military beginning of our intercourse with the
Middle Kingdom has now receded into the background; one is not
conscious, in any class, of a strong hostility to foreigners as
such. It would not be difficult to make out a case for the view
that intercourse with the white races is proving a misfortune
to China, but apparently this view is not taken by anyone in China
except where unreasoning conservative prejudice outweighs all
other considerations. The Chinese have a very strong instinct
for trade, and a considerable intellectual curiosity, to both
of which we appeal. Only a bare minimum of common decency is required
to secure their friendship, whether privately or politically.
And I think their thought is as capable of enriching our culture
as their commerce of enriching our pockets.</p>

<p>In the Treaty Ports, Europeans and Americans live in their own
quarters, with streets well paved and lighted, houses in European
style, and shops full of American and English goods. There is
generally also a Chinese part of the town, with narrow streets,
gaily decorated shops, and the rich mixture of smells characteristic
of China. Often one passes through a gate, suddenly, from one
to the other; after the cheerful disordered beauty of the old
town, Europe's ugly cleanliness and Sunday-go-to-meeting decency
make a strange complex impression, half-love and half-hate. In
the European town one finds safety, spaciousness and hygiene;
in the Chinese town, romance, overcrowding and disease. In spite
of my affection for China, these transitions always made me realize
that I am a European; for me, the Chinese manner of life would
not mean happiness. But after making all necessary deductions
for the poverty and the disease, I am inclined to think that Chinese
life brings more happiness to the Chinese than English life does
to us. At any rate this seemed to me to be true for the men; for
the women I do not think it would be true.</p>

<p>Shanghai and Tientsin are white men's cities; the first sight
of Shanghai makes one wonder what is the use of travelling, because
there is so little change from what one is used to. Treaty Ports,
each of which is a centre of European influence, exist practically
all over China, not only on the sea coast. Hankow, a very important
Treaty Port, is almost exactly in the centre of China. North and
South China are divided by the Yangtze; East and West China are
divided by the route from Peking to Canton. These two dividing
lines meet at Hankow, which has long been an important strategical
point in Chinese history. From Peking to Hankow there is a railway,
formerly Franco-Belgian, now owned by the Chinese Government.
From Wuchang, opposite Hankow on the southern bank of the river,
there is to be a railway to Canton, but at present it only runs
half-way, to Changsha, also a Treaty Port. The completion of the
railway, together with improved docks, will greatly increase the
importance of Canton and diminish that of Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>In the Treaty Ports commerce is the principal business; but in
the lower Yangtze and in certain mining districts there are beginnings
of industrialism. China produces large amounts of raw cotton,
which are mostly manipulated by primitive methods; but there are
a certain number of cotton-mills on modern lines. If low wages
meant cheap labour for the employer, there would be little hope
for Lancashire, because in Southern China the cotton is grown
on the spot, the climate is damp, and there is an inexhaustible
supply of industrious coolies ready to work very long hours for
wages upon which an English working-man would find it literally
impossible to keep body and soul together. Nevertheless, it is
not the underpaid Chinese coolie whom Lancashire has to fear,
and China will not become a formidable competitor until improvement
in methods and education enables the Chinese workers to earn good
wages. Meanwhile, in China, as in every other country, the beginnings
of industry are sordid and cruel. The intellectuals wish to be
told of some less horrible method by which their country may be
industrialized, but so far none is in sight.</p>

<p>The intelligentsia in China has a very peculiar position, unlike
that which it has in any other country. Hereditary aristocracy
has been practically extinct in China for about 2,000 years, and
for many centuries the country has been governed by the successful
candidates in competitive examinations. This has given to the
educated the kind of prestige elsewhere belonging to a governing
aristocracy. Although the old traditional education is fast dying
out, and higher education now teaches modern subjects, the prestige
of education has survived, and public opinion is still ready to
be influenced by those who have intellectual qualifications. The
Tuchuns, many of whom, including Chang-tso-lin, have begun by
being brigands,[36] are, of course, mostly too stupid and ignorant
to share this attitude, but that in itself makes their régime
weak and unstable. The influence of Young China&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>
of those who have been educated either abroad or in modern colleges
at home&mdash;is far greater than it would be in a country with less
respect for learning. This is, perhaps, the most hopeful feature
in the situation, because the number of modern students is rapidly
increasing, and their outlook and aims are admirable. In another
ten years or so they will probably be strong enough to regenerate
China&mdash;if only the Powers will allow ten years to elapse without
taking any drastic action.</p>

<p>It is important to try to understand the outlook and potentialities
of Young China. Most of my time was spent among those Chinese
who had had a modern education, and I should like to give some
idea of their mentality. It seemed to me that one could already
distinguish two generations: the older men, who had fought their
way with great difficulty and almost in solitude out of the traditional
Confucian prejudices; and the younger men, who had found modern
schools and colleges waiting for them, containing a whole world
of modern-minded people ready to give sympathy and encouragement
in the inevitable fight against the family. The older men&mdash;men
varying in age from 30 to 50&mdash;have gone through an inward and
outward struggle resembling that of the rationalists of Darwin's
and Mill's generation. They have had, painfully and with infinite
difficulty, to free their minds from the beliefs instilled in
youth, and to turn their thoughts to a new science and a new ethic.
Imagine (say) Plotinus recalled from the shades and miraculously
compelled to respect Mr. Henry Ford; this will give you some idea
of the centuries across which these men have had to travel in
becoming European. Some of them are a little weary with the effort,
their forces somewhat spent and their originality no longer creative.
But this can astonish no one who realizes the internal revolution
they have achieved in their own minds.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that an able Chinaman, when he masters
our culture, becomes purely imitative. This may happen among the
second-rate Chinese, especially when they turn Christians, but
it does not happen among the best. They remain Chinese, critical
of European civilization even when they have assimilated it. They
retain a certain crystal candour and a touching belief in the
efficacy of moral forces; the industrial revolution has not yet
affected their mental processes. When they become persuaded of
the importance of some opinion, they try to spread it by setting
forth the reasons in its favour; they do not hire the front pages
of newspapers for advertising, or put up on hoardings along the
railways "So-and-so's opinion is the best." In all this they differ
greatly from more advanced nations, and particularly from America;
it never occurs to them to treat opinions as if they were soaps.
And they have no admiration for ruthlessness, or love of bustling
activity without regard to its purpose. Having thrown over the
prejudices in which they were brought up, they have not taken
on a new set, but have remained genuinely free in their thoughts,
able to consider any proposition honestly on its merits.</p>

<p>The younger men, however, have something more than the first
generation of modern intellectuals. Having had less of a struggle,
they have retained more energy and self-confidence. The candour
and honesty of the pioneers survive, with more determination to
be socially effective. This may be merely the natural character
of youth, but I think it is more than that. Young men under thirty
have often come in contact with Western ideas at a sufficiently
early age to have assimilated them without a great struggle, so
that they can acquire knowledge without being torn by spiritual
conflicts. And they have been able to learn Western knowledge
from Chinese teachers to begin with, which has made the process
less difficult. Even the youngest students, of course, still have
reactionary families, but they find less difficulty than their
predecessors in resisting the claims of the family, and in realizing
practically, not only theoretically, that the traditional Chinese
reverence for the old may well be carried too far. In these young
men I see the hope of China. When a little experience has taught
them practical wisdom, I believe they will be able to lead Chinese
opinion in the directions in which it ought to move.</p>

<p>There is one traditional Chinese belief which dies very hard,
and that is the belief that correct ethical sentiments are more
important then detailed scientific knowledge. This view is, of
course, derived from the Confucian tradition, and is more or less
true in a pre-industrial society. It would have been upheld by
Rousseau or Dr. Johnson, and broadly speaking by everybody before
the Benthamites. We, in the West, have now swung to the opposite
extreme: we tend to think that technical efficiency is everything
and moral purpose nothing. A battleship may be taken as the concrete
embodiment of this view. When we read, say, of some new poison-gas
by means of which one bomb from an aeroplane can exterminate a
whole town, we have a thrill of what we fondly believe to be horror,
but it is really delight in scientific skill. Science is our god;
we say to it, "Though thou slay me, yet will I trust in thee."
And so it slays us. The Chinese have not this defect, but they
have the opposite one, of believing that good intentions are the
only thing really necessary. I will give an illustration. Forsythe
Sherfesee, Forestry Adviser to the Chinese Government, gave an
address at the British Legation in January 1919 on "Some National
Aspects of Forestry in China."[37] In this address he proves (so
far as a person ignorant of forestry can judge) that large parts
of China which now lie waste are suitable for forestry, that the
importation of timber (<em>e.g</em>. for railway sleepers) which
now takes place is wholly unnecessary, and that the floods which
often sweep away whole districts would be largely prevented if
the slopes of the mountains from which the rivers come were reafforested.
Yet it is often difficult to interest even the most reforming
Chinese in afforestation, because it is not an easy subject for
ethical enthusiasm. Trees are planted round graves, because Confucius
said they should be; if Confucianism dies out, even these will
be cut down. But public-spirited Chinese students learn political
theory as it is taught in our universities, and despise such humble
questions as the utility of trees. After learning all about (say)
the proper relations of the two Houses of Parliament, they go
home to find that some Tuchun has dismissed both Houses, and is
governing in a fashion not considered in our text-books. Our theories
of politics are only true in the West (if there); our theories
of forestry are equally true everywhere. Yet it is our theories
of politics that Chinese students are most eager to learn. Similarly
the practical study of industrial processes might be very useful,
but the Chinese prefer the study of our theoretical economics,
which is hardly applicable except where industry is already developed.
In all these respects, however, there is beginning to be a marked
improvement.</p>

<p>It is science that makes the difference between our intellectual
outlook and that of the Chinese intelligentsia. The Chinese, even
the most modern, look to the white nations, especially America,
for moral maxims to replace those of Confucius. They have not
yet grasped that men's morals in the mass are the same everywhere:
they do as much harm as they dare, and as much good as they must.
In so far as there is a difference of morals between us and the
Chinese, we differ for the worse, because we are more energetic,
and can therefore commit more crimes <em>per diem</em>. What we
have to teach the Chinese is not morals, or ethical maxims about
government, but science and technical skill. The real problem
for the Chinese intellectuals is to acquire Western knowledge
without acquiring the mechanistic outlook.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not clear what I mean by "the mechanistic outlook."
I mean something which exists equally in Imperialism, Bolshevism
and the <em>Y.M.C.A.; </em>something which distinguishes all these
from the Chinese outlook, and which I, for my part, consider very
evil. What I mean is the habit of regarding mankind as raw material,
to be moulded by our scientific manipulation into whatever form
may happen to suit our fancy. The essence of the matter, from
the point of view of the individual who has this point of view,
is the cultivation of will at the expense of perception, the fervent
moral belief that it is our duty to force other people to realize
our conception of the world. The Chinese intellectual is not much
troubled by Imperialism as a creed, but is vigorously assailed
by Bolshevism and the <em>Y.M.C.A., </em>to one or other of which
he is too apt to fall a victim, learning a belief from the one
in the class-war and the dictatorship of the communists, from
the other in the mystic efficacy of cold baths and dumb-bells.
Both these creeds, in their Western adepts, involve a contempt
for the rest of mankind except as potential converts, and the
belief that progress consists in the spread of a doctrine. They
both involve a belief in government and a life against Nature.
This view, though I have called it mechanistic, is as old as religion,
though mechanism has given it new and more virulent forms. The
first of Chinese philosophers, Lao-Tze, wrote his book to protest
against it, and his disciple Chuang-Tze put his criticism into
a fable[38]:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Horses have hoofs to carry them over frost and snow; hair, to<br/>
protect them from wind and cold. They eat grass and drink water,<br/>
and fling up their heels over the champaign. Such is the real<br/>
nature of horses. Palatial dwellings are of no use to them.

</p>
<p>
One day Po Lo appeared, saying: "I understand the management of<br/>
horses."

</p>
<p>
So he branded them, and clipped them, and pared their hoofs, and<br/>
put halters on them, tying them up by the head and shackling them<br/>
by the feet, and disposing them in stables, with the result that<br/>
two or three in every ten died. Then he kept them hungry and<br/>
thirsty, trotting them and galloping them, and grooming, and<br/>
trimming, with the misery of the tasselled bridle before and the<br/>
fear of the knotted whip behind, until more than half of them<br/>
were dead.

</p>
<p>
The potter says: "I can do what I will with clay. If I want it<br/>
round, I use compasses; if rectangular, a square."

</p>
<p>
The carpenter says: "I can do what I will with wood. If I want it<br/>
curved, I use an arc; if straight, a line."

</p>
<p>
But on what grounds can we think that the natures of clay and<br/>
wood desire this application of compasses and square, of arc and<br/>
line? Nevertheless, every age extols Po Lo for his skill in<br/>
managing horses, and potters and carpenters for their skill with<br/>
clay and wood. Those who <em>govern</em> the Empire make the same<br/>
mistake.

<p>Although Taoism, of which Lao-Tze was the founder and Chuang-Tze
the chief apostle, was displaced by Confucianism, yet the spirit
of this fable has penetrated deeply into Chinese life, making
it more urbane and tolerant, more contemplative and observant,
than the fiercer life of the West. The Chinese watch foreigners
as we watch animals in the Zoo, to see whether they "drink water
and fling up their heels over the champaign," and generally to
derive amusement from their curious habits. Unlike the <em>Y.M.C.A.,
</em>they have no wish to alter the habits of the foreigners,
any more than we wish to put the monkeys at the Zoo into trousers
and stiff shirts. And their attitude towards each other is, as
a rule, equally tolerant. When they became a Republic, instead
of cutting off the Emperor's head, as other nations do, they left
him his title, his palace, and four million dollars a year (about
£600,000), and he remains to this moment with his officials, his
eunuchs and his etiquette, but without one shred of power or influence.
In talking with a Chinese, you feel that he is trying to understand
you, not to alter you or interfere with you. The result of his
attempt may be a caricature or a panegyric, but in either case
it will be full of delicate perception and subtle humour. A friend
in Peking showed me a number of pictures, among which I specially
remember various birds: a hawk swooping on a sparrow, an eagle
clasping a big bough of a tree in his claws, water-fowl standing
on one leg disconsolate in the snow. All these pictures showed
that kind of sympathetic understanding which one feels also in
their dealings with human beings&mdash;something which I can perhaps
best describe as the antithesis of Nietzsche. This quality, unfortunately,
is useless in warfare, and foreign nations are doing their best
to stamp it out. But it is an infinitely valuable quality, of
which our Western world has far too little. Together with their
exquisite sense of beauty, it makes the Chinese nation quite extraordinarily
lovable. The injury that we are doing to China is wanton and cruel,
the destruction of something delicate and lovely for the sake
of the gross pleasures of barbarous millionaires. One of the poems
translated from the Chinese by Mr. Waley[39] is called <em>Business
Men</em>, and it expresses, perhaps more accurately than I could
do, the respects in which the Chinese are our superiors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
Business men boast of their skill and cunning<br/>
But in philosophy they are like little children.<br/>
Bragging to each other of successful depredations<br/>
They neglect to consider the ultimate fate of the body.<br/>
What should they know of the Master of Dark Truth<br/>
Who saw the wide world in a jade cup,<br/>
By illumined conception got clear of heaven and earth:<br/>
On the chariot of Mutation entered the Gate of Immutability?

</p>
</div>
<p>I wish I could hope that some respect for "the Master of Dark
Truth" would enter into the hearts of our apostles of Western
culture. But as that is out of the question, it is necessary to
seek other ways of solving the Far Eastern question.</p>

<p>[Footnote 31: <em>The Truth about China and Japan</em>, Allen
&amp; Unwin, 1921, p. 14. On the other hand Sih-Gung Cheng (<em>Modern
China</em>, p. 13) says that it "killed twenty million people,"
which is the more usual estimate, cf. <em>China of the Chinese</em>
by <em>E.T.C. </em>Werner, p. 24. The extent to which the population
was diminished is not accurately known, but I have no doubt that
20 millions is nearer the truth than 150 millions.]</p>

a more subservient Government, the dismissal of which has been
ordered by Wu-Pei-Fu. A clash is imminent. See Appendix.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 33: The blame for this is put upon Sun Yat Sen, who
is said to have made an alliance with Chang-tso-lin. The best
element in the Canton Government was said to be represented by
Sun's colleague General Cheng Chiung Ming, who is now reported
to have been dismissed (<em>The Times</em>, April 24, 1922). These
statements are apparently unfounded. See Appendix.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 35: There are, however, no accurate statistics as to
the birth-rate or the death-rate in China, and some writers question
whether the birth-rate is really very large. From a privately
printed pamphlet by my friend Mr. <em>V.K. </em>Ting, I learn
that Dr. Lennox, of the Peking Union Medical College, from a careful
study of 4,000 families, found that the average number of children
(dead and living) per family was 2.1, while the infant mortality
was 184.1. Other investigations are quoted to show that the birth-rate
near Peking is between 30 and 50. In the absence of statistics,
generalizations about the population question in China must be
received with extreme caution.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 36: I repeat what everybody, Chinese or foreign, told
me. Mr. Bland, <em>per contra</em>, describes Chang-tso-lin as
a polished Confucian. Contrast p. 104 of his <em>China, Japan
and Korea</em> with pp. 143, 146 of Coleman's <em>The Far East
Unveiled</em>, which gives the view of everybody except Mr. Bland.
Lord Northcliffe had an interview with Chang-tso-lin reported
in <em>The Times</em> recently, but he was, of course, unable
to estimate Chang-tso-lin's claims to literary culture.]</p>
