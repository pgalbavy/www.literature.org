<P>
Mr. Sabin, although he had registered at the hotel under his
accustomed pseudonym, had taken no pains to conceal his identity,
and was well known to the people in authority about the place.  He
was received with all the respect due to his rank.
<P>
"Your Grace will, I trust, accept my most sincere apologies for
disturbing you," Mr. Hertz, the manager, said, rising and bowing at
his entrance.  "We have here, however, an emissary connected with
the police come to inquire into the sad incident of this afternoon.
He expressed a wish to ask your Grace a question or two with a view
to rendering your Grace's attendance at the inquest unnecessary."
<P>
Mr. Sabin nodded.
<P>
"I am perfectly willing," he said, "to answer any questions you may
choose to put to me."
<P>
A plain, hard-featured little man, in a long black overcoat, and
holding a howler hat in his hand, bowed respectfully to Mr. Sabin.
<P>
"I am much obliged to you, sir," he said.  "My name is John Passmore.
We do not of course appear in this matter unless the post-mortem
should indicate anything unusual in the circumstances of Duson's
death, but it is always well to be prepared, and I ventured to ask
Mr. Hertz here to procure for me your opinion as regards the death
of your servant."
<P>
"You have asked me," Mr. Sabin said gravely, "a very difficult
question."
<P>
The eyes of the little detective flashed keenly.
<P>
"You do not believe then, sir, that he died a natural death?"
<P>
"I do not," Mr. Sabin answered.
<P>
Mr. Hertz was startled.  The detective controlled his features
admirably.
<P>
"May I ask your reasons, sir?"
<P>
Mr. Sabin lightly shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"I have never known the man to have a day's illness in his life,"
he said.  "Further, since his arrival in England he has been
acting in a strange and furtive manner, and I gathered that he had
some cause for fear which he was indisposed to talk about."
<P>
"This," the detective said, "is very interesting."
<P>
"Doubtless," Mr. Sabin answered.  "But before I say anything more
I must clearly understand my position.  I am giving you personally
a few friendly hints, in the interests of justice perhaps, but still
quite informally.  I am not in possession of any definite facts
concerning Duson, and what I say to you here I am not prepared to
say at the inquest, before which I presume I may have to appear as
a witness.  There, I shall do nothing more save identify Duson and
state the circumstances under which I found him."
<P>
"I understand that perfectly, sir," the man answered.  "The less
said at the inquest the better in the interests of justice."
<P>
Mr. Sabin nodded.
<P>
"I am glad," he said, "that you appreciate that.  I do not mind going
so far then as to tell you that I believe Duson died of poison."
<P>
"Can you give me any idea," the detective asked, "as to the source?"
<P>
"None," Mr. Sabin answered.  "That you must discover for yourselves.
Duson was a man of silent and secretive habits, and it has occurred
to me more than once that he might possibly be a member of one of
those foreign societies who have their headquarters in Soho, and
concerning which you probably know more than I do."
<P>
The detective smiled.  It was a very slight flicker of the lips,
but it attracted Mr. Sabin's keen attention.
<P>
"Your suggestions," the detective said, "are making this case a very interesting one.  I have
always understood, however, that reprisals
of this extreme nature are seldom resorted to in this country.
Besides, the man's position seems scarcely to indicate sufficient
importance - perhaps - "
<P>
"Well?" Mr. Sabin interjected.
<P>
"I notice that Duson was found in your sitting-room.  It occurs to
me as a possibility that he may have met with a fate intended for
some one else - for yourself, for instance, sir!"
<P>
"But I," Mr. Sabin said smoothly, "am a member of no secret society,
nor am I conscious of having enemies sufficiently venomous to desire
my life."
<P>
The detective sat for a moment with immovable face.
<P>
"We, all of us, know our friends, sir," he said.  "There are few of
us properly acquainted with our enemies."
<P>
Mr. Sabin lit a cigarette.  His fingers were quite steady, but this
man was making him think.
<P>
"You do not seriously believe," he asked, "that Duson met with a
death which was intended for me?"
<P>
"I am afraid," the detective said thoughtfully, "that I know no
more about it than you do."
<P>
"I see," Mr. Sabin said, "that I am no stranger to you."
<P>
"You are very far from being that, sir," the man answered.  "A
few years ago I was working for the Government - and you were not
often out of my sight."
<P>
Mr. Sabin smiled.
<P>
"It was perhaps judicious," he remarked, "though I am afraid it
proved of very little profit to you.  And what about the present
time?"
<P>
"I see no harm in telling you, sir, that a general watch is kept
upon your movements.  Duson was useful to us ... but now Duson
is dead."
<P>
"It is a fact," Mr. Sabin said impressively, "that Duson was a
genius.  My admiration for him continually increases."
<P>
"Duson made harmless reports to us as we desired them," the
detective said.  "I have an idea, however, that if this course had
at any time been inimical to your interests that Duson would have
deceived us."
<P>
"I am convinced of it," Mr. Sabin declared.
<P>
"And Duson is dead!"
<P>
Mr. Sabin nodded gravely.
<P>
The little hard-visaged man looked steadily for a moment upon the
carpet.
<P>
"Duson died virtually whilst accepting pay from if not actually
in the employ of our Secret Service Department.  You will
understand, therefore, that we, knowing of this complication in
his life, naturally incline towards the theory of murder.  Shall
I be taking a liberty, sir, if I give you an unprofessional word
of warning?"
<P>
Mr. Sabin raised his eyebrows.
<P>
"By no means," he answered.  "But surely you cannot - "
<P>
The man smiled.
<P>
"No, sir," he said drily.  "I do not for one moment suspect you.
The man was our spy upon your movements, but I am perfectly aware
that there has been nothing worth reporting, and I also know that
you would never run such a risk for the removal of so insignificant
a person.  No, my warning comes to you from a different point of
view.  It is, if you will pardon my saying so, none the less
personal, but wholly friendly.  The case of Duson will be sifted to
the dregs, but unless I am greatly mistaken, and I do not see room
for the possibility of a mistake, I know the truth already."
<P>
"You will share your knowledge?" Mr. Sabin asked quietly.
<P>
The detective shook his head.
<P>
"You shall know," he said, "before the last moment.  But I want to
warn you that when you do now it - it will be a shock to you."
<P>
Mr. Sabin stood perfectly still for several moments.  This little
man believed what he was saying.  He was certainly deceived.  Yet
none the less Mr. Sabin was thoughtful.
<P>
"You do not feel inclined," he said slowly, "to give me your entire
confidence."
<P>
"Not at present, sir," the man answered.  "You would certainly
intervene, and my case would be spoilt."
<P>
Mr. Sabin glanced at the clock.
<P>
"If you care to call on me to-morrow," he said, "I could perhaps
show you something which might change your opinion."
<P>
The detective bowed.
<P>
"I am always open, sir," he said, "to conviction.  I will come
about twelve o'clock."
<P>
Mr. Sabin went back to the palm lounge.  Lucille and Reginald
Brott were sitting together at a small table, talking earnestly
to one another.  The Prince and Lady Carey had joined another
party who were all talking together near the entrance.  The latter,
directly she saw them coming, detached herself from them and came
to him.
<P>
"Your coffee is almost cold," she said, "but the Prince has found
some brandy of wonderful age, somewhere in the last century, I
believe."
<P>
Mr. Sabin glanced towards Lucille.  She appeared engrossed in her
conversation, and had not noticed his approach.  Lady Carey shrugged.
<P>
"You have only a few minutes," she said, "before that dreadful
person comes and frowns us all out.  I have kept you a chair."
<P>
Mr. Sabin sat down.  Lady Carey interposed herself between him and
the small table at which Lucille was sitting.
<P>
"Have they discovered anything?" she asked.
<P>
"Nothing!" Mr. Sabin answered.
<P>
She played with her fan for a moment.  Then she looked him steadily
in the face.
<P>
"My friend?"
<P>
He glanced towards her.
<P>
"Lady Carey!"
<P>
"Why are you so obstinate?" she exclaimed in a low, passionate
whisper.  "I want to be your friend, and I could be very useful to
you.  Yet you keep me always at arm's length.  You are making a
mistake.  Indeed you are.  I suppose you do not trust me.  Yet
reflect Have I ever told you anything that was not true?  Have I
ever tried to deceive you?  I don't pretend to be a paragon of the
virtues.  I live my life to please myself.  I admit it.  Why not?
It is simply applying the same sort of philosophy to my life as
you have applied to yours.  My enemies can find plenty to say about
me - but never that I have been false to a friend.  Why do you keep
me always at arm's length, as though I were one of those who wished
you evil?"
<P>
"Lady Carey," Mr. Sabin said, "I will not affect to misunderstand
you, and I am flattered that you should consider my good will of
any importance.  But you are the friend of the Prince of Saxe
Leinitzer.  You are one of those even now who are working actively
against me.  I am not blaming you, but we are on opposite sides."
<P>
Lady Carey looked for a moment across at the Prince, and her eyes
were full of venom.
<P>
"If you knew," she murmured, "how I loathe that man.  Friends!  That
is all long since past.  Nothing would give me so much pleasure as
never to see his face again."
<P>
"Nevertheless," Mr. Sabin reminded her, "whatever your private
feelings may be, he has claims upon you which you cannot resist."
<P>
"There is one thing in the world," she said in a low tone, "for
which I would risk even the abnegation of those claims."
<P>
"You would perjure your honour?"
<P>
"Yes - if it came to that."
<P>
Mr. Sabin moved uneasily in his chair.  The woman was in earnest.
She offered him an invaluable alliance; she could show him the way
to hold his own against even the inimical combination by which he
was surrounded.  If only he could compromise.  But her eyes were
seeking his eagerly, even fiercely.
<P>
"You doubt me still," she whispered.  "And I thought that you had
genius.  Listen, I will prove myself.  The Prince has one of his
foolish passions for Lucille.  You know that.  So far she has shown
herself able to resist his fascinations.  He is trying other means.
Lucille is in danger!  Duson !  - but after all, I was never really
in danger, except the time when I carried the despatches for the
colonel and rode straight into a Boer ambush."
<P>
Mr. Sabin saw nothing, hut he did not move a muscle of his face.  A
moment later they heard the Prince's voice from behind them.
<P>
"I am very sorry," he said, "to interrupt these interesting
reminiscences, but you see that every one is going.  Lucille is
already in the cloak-room."
<P>
Lady Carey rose at once, but the glance she threw at the Prince was
a singularly malicious one.  They walked down the carpeted way
together, and Lady Carey left them without a word.  In the vestibule
Mr. Sabin and Reginald Brott came face to face.
