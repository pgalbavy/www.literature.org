<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When Sir William left me in the school-room, he left a lad of
sixteen puffed up in a glow of pride. To be treated no longer
as a fractious child&mdash;to be received at last as a man among men!</p>

<p>And what would Esk say? And Silver Heels, poor little mouse harnessed
in the stocks below?</p>

<p>I had entered the school-room that morning a lazy, sullen, defiant
lad, heavy-hearted, with chronic resentment against the discipline
of those who had sent me into a hateful trap from the windows
of which I could see the young, thirsty year quaffing spring sunshine.
Now I was free to leave the accursed trap forever, a man of discretion,
responsible before men, exacting from other men the same courtesies,
attentions, and considerations which I might render them.</p>

<p>What a change had come to me, all in one brief May morning! As
I stood there, resting my bandaged hand in the palm of the other,
looking about me to realize the fortune which set my veins tingling,
a great tide of benevolent condescension for the others swept
over me, a ripple of pity and good-will for the hapless children
whose benches lay in a row before me.</p>

<p>I no longer detested Silver Heels. I walked on tiptoe to her
bench. There lay her slate and slate-pen; upon it I read a portion
of the longer catechism. There, too, lay her quill and inky horn
and a foolscap book sewed neatly and marked:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>FELICITY WARREN<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1774<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HER BOOKE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Poor child, doomed for years still to steep her little fingers
in ink-powder while, with the powder I should require hereafter,
I expected to write fiercer tales on living hides with plummets
cast in bullet-moulds!</p>

<p>Cramped with importance, I cast a contemptuous eye upon my poem
which embellished the great slate, and scoured it partly out with
the buckskin.</p>

<p>"My books," said I, to myself, "I will bestow upon Silver Heels
and Esk;" and I carried out my philanthropic impulse, piling speller,
reader, and arithmetic on Esk's bench; my Cæsar, my pair of globes,
my compass, and my algebra I laid with Silver Heels's copy-book,
first writing in the books, with some malice:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>SILVER HEELS HER GIFT BOOKE FROM<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MICHAEL CARDIGAN<br/>
&nbsp;BE DILIGENT AND OF GOOD THRIFT<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>For fat Peter, because I allowed Vix to bite his tight breeches,
I left a pile of jacks beside his horn-book, namely, a slate-pen,
three mended quills, a birchen box of ink-powder, a screw to trade
with, two tops and an alley, pumice, a rule, and some wax.</p>

<p>Peter, though duck-limbed and half Mohawk, wrote very well in
the Boston style, and could even copy in the Lettre Frisée&mdash;a
poor art in some repute, but smelling to my nose of French flummery
and deceit.</p>

<p>Having bestowed these gifts with a light heart, I walked slowly
around the room, and I fear my walk was somewhat a strut.</p>

<p>I knew my small head was all swelled with vain imaginings; I
saw myself in a flapped coat and lace, fingering the hilt of a
sword at my hip, saluted by the sentries and the militia; I saw
myself riding with Sir William as his deputy; I heard him say,
"Mr. Cardigan, the enemy are upon us! We must fly!"&mdash;and I: "Sir
William, fear nothing. The day is our own!" And I saw a lad of
sixteen, with sword pointing upward and one hand twisted into
Pontiac's scalp-lock, smile benignly upon Sir William, who had
cast himself upon my breast, protesting that I had saved the army,
and that the King should hear of it.</p>

<p>Then, unbidden, the apparition of Mr. Butler rose into my vain
dreaming, and, though I am no prophet, nor can I claim the gift
of seeing behind the veil, yet I swear that Walter Butler appeared
to me all aflame and bloody with scalps bunched at his girdle&mdash;<em>and
the scalps were not of the red men!</em></p>

<p>Now my imagination smoking into fire, I saw myself dogging Mr.
Butler with firelock a-trail and knife loosened, on! on! through
fathomless depths of forest and by the still deeps of shadowy
lakes, fording the roaring tumble of rivers, swimming silent pools
as otters swim, but tracking him, ever tracking Captain Butler
by the scent of his reeking scalps.</p>

<p>There was a dew on my eyebrows as I waked into sense. Yet again
I fell straightway to imagining the glories of my young future.
Truly I painted life in cloying colours; and always, when I accomplished
gallant deeds, there stood Silver Heels to observe me, and to
marvel, and to stamp her little moccasins in vexation that I,
the pride and envy of all men, applauded, courted, nay, worshipped
&mdash;I, the playmate she had in her silly ignorance flouted,
now stood so far beyond her that she dared not twitch the skirt
of my coat nor whisper, "Sir Michael, pray condescend to notice
one who passes her entire life in admiring your careless exploits."</p>

<p>Perhaps I would smile at her&mdash;yes, I certainly should speak to
her&mdash;not with familiarity. But I would be magnanimous; she should
receive gifts, spoils from wars, and I would select a suitable
husband for her from the officers of my household who adored me!
No, I would not be hasty concerning a husband. That would be foolish,
for Silver Heels must remain heart-whole and fancy-free to concentrate
her envious admiration upon me.</p>

<p>In a sort of ecstasy I paraded the school-room, the splendour
of my visions dulling eyes and ears, and it was not until he had
called me thrice that I observed Mr. Butler standing within the
doorway.</p>

<p>The unwelcome sight cleared my brains like a dash of spring-water
in the face.</p>

<p>"It is one o'clock," said Mr. Butler, "and time for your carving
lesson. Did you not hear the bugles from the forts?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing, sir," said I, giving him a surly look, which
he returned with that blank stare of the eyes, noticeable in hawks
and kites and foul night birds surprised by light.</p>

<p>"Sir William dines early," he said, as I followed him through
the dim hallway, past the nursery, and down stairs. "If he has
to wait your pleasure for his slice of roast, you will await his
pleasure for the remainder of the day in the school-room."</p>

<p>"It is not true!" I said, stopping short in the lower hallway.
"I am free of that ratty pit forever! And of the old ferret, too,"
I added, insolently.</p>

<p>"By your favour," said Mr. Butler, "may I ask whether your erudition
is impairing your bodily health, that you leave school so early
in life, Master Cardigan?"</p>

<p>"If you were a real schoolmaster," said I, hotly, "I would answer
you with a kennel lash, but you are an officer and a gentleman."
And in a low voice I bade him go to the devil at his convenience.</p>

<p>"One year more and I could call you out for this," he said, staring
at me.</p>

<p>"You can do it now!" I retorted, angrily, raising myself a little
on my toes.</p>

<p>Suddenly all the hatred and contempt I had so long choked back
burst out in language I now blush for. I called him a coward,
a Huron, a gentleman with the instincts of a pedagogue. I heaped
abuse upon him; I dared him to meet me; nay, I challenged him
to face me with rifle or sword, when and where he chose. And all
the time he stood staring at me with that deathly laugh which
never reached his eyes.</p>

<p>"Measure me!" I said, venomously; "I am as tall as you, lacking
an inch. I am a man! This day Sir William freed me from that spider-web
you tenant, and now in Heaven's name let us settle that score
which every hour has added to since I first beheld you!"</p>

<p>"And my honour?" he asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"What?" I stammered. "I ask you to maintain it with rifle or
rapier! Blood scours tarnished names!"</p>

<p>"Not your blood," he said, with a stealthy glance at the dining-room
door; "not the blood of a boy. That would rust my honour. Wait,
Master Cardigan, wait a bit. A year runs like a spotted fawn in
cherry-time!"</p>

<p>"You will not meet me?" I blurted out, mortified.</p>

<p>"In a year, perhaps," he said, absently, scarcely looking at
me as he spoke.</p>

<p>Then from within the dining-hall came Sir William's roar: "Body
o' me! Am I to be kept here at twiddle-thumbs for lack of a carver!"</p>

<p>I stepped back in an instant, bowing to Mr. Butler.</p>

<p>"I will be patient for a year, sir," I said. And so opened the
door while he passed me, and into the dining-hall.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir," said I, but Sir William cut me short with:</p>

<p>"Damnation, sir! I am asking a blessing!"</p>

<p>So I buried my nose in my hollowed hand and stood up, very still.</p>

<p>Having given thanks in a temper, Sir William's frown relaxed
and he sat down and tucked his finger-cloth under his neck with
an injured glance at me.</p>

<p>"Zounds!" he said, mildly; "hell hath no fury like a fisherman
kept waiting. Captain Butler, bear me out."</p>

<p>"I am no angler," said Mr. Butler, in his deadened voice.</p>

<p>"That is true," observed Sir William, as though condoling with
Mr. Butler for a misfortune not his fault. "Perhaps some day the
fever may scorch you&mdash;like our young kinsman Micky&mdash;eh, lad?"</p>

<p>I said, "Perhaps, sir," with eyes on the smoking joint before
me. It was Sir William's pleasure that I learn to carve; and,
in truth, I found it easy, save for the carving of a goose or
of those wild-ducks we shot on the great Vlaie.</p>

<p>We were but four to dine that day: Sir William, Mr. Butler, Silver
Heels, and myself. Mistress Molly remained in the nursery, where
were also Peter and Esk, inasmuch as they slobbered and fouled
the cloth, and so fed in the play-room.</p>

<p>Colonel Guy Johnson remained at Detroit, Captain John Johnson
was on a mission to Albany, Thayendanegea in Quebec, and Colonel
Claus, with his lady, had gone to Castle Cumberland. There were
no visiting officers or Indians at Johnson Hall that week, and
our small company seemed lost in the great dining-hall.</p>

<p>Having carved the juicy joint, the gilly served Sir William,
then Mr. Butler, then Silver Heels, whom I had scarcely noticed,
so full was I of my quarrel with Mr. Butler. Now, as Saunders
laid her plate, I gave her a look which meant, "I did not tell
Sir William," whereupon she smiled at her plate and clipped a
spoonful from a dish of potatoes.</p>

<p>"Good appetite and good health, sir," said I, raising my wine-glass
to Sir William.</p>

<p>"Good health, my lad!" said Sir William, heartily.</p>

<p>Glasses were raised again and compliments said, though my face
was sufficient to sour the Madeira in Mr. Butler's glass.</p>

<p>"Your good health, Michael," said Silver Heels, sweetly.</p>

<p>I pledged her with a patronizing amiability which made her hazel-gray
eyes open wide.</p>

<p>Now, coxcomb that I was, I sat there, dizzied by my new dignity,
yet carefully watching Sir William to imitate him, thinking that,
as I was now a man, I must observe the carriage, deportment, and
tastes of men.</p>

<p>When Sir William declined a dish of jelly, I also waved it away,
though God knew I loved jellies.</p>

<p>When Sir William drank the last of the winter's ale, I shoved
aside my small-beer and sent for a mug.</p>

<p>"It will make a humming-top of your head," said Sir William.
"Stick to small-beer, Micky."</p>

<p>Mortified, I tossed off my portion, and was very careful not
to look at Silver Heels, being hot in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. Butler and Sir William spoke gravely of the discontent now
rampant in the town of Boston, and of Captain John Johnson's mission
to Albany. I listened greedily, sniffing for news of war, but
understood little of their discourse save what pertained to the
Indians.</p>

<p>Some mention, indeed, was made of rangers, but, having always
associated militia and rangers with war on the Indians, I thought
little of what they discussed. I even forgot my new dignity, and
secretly pinched a bread crumb into the shape of a little pig
which I showed to Silver Heels. She thereupon pinched out a dog
with hound's ears for me to admire.</p>

<p>I was roused by Sir William's voice in solemn tones to Mr. Butler:
"Now, God forbid I should live to see that, Captain Butler!" and
I pricked up my ears once more, but made nothing of what followed,
save that there were certain disloyal men in Massachusetts and
New York who might rise against our King and that our Governor
Tryon meant to take some measures concerning tea.</p>

<p>"Well, well," burst out Sir William at length; "in evil days
let us thank God that the fish still swim! Eh, Micky? I wish the
ice were out."</p>

<p>"The anchor-ice is afloat, and the Kennyetto is free, sir," I
said, quickly.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Sir William, laughing.</p>

<p>I had, the day previous, run across to the Kennyetto to see,
and I told him so.</p>

<p>He was pleased to praise my zeal and to say I ran like a Mohawk,
which praise sounded sweet until I saw Silver Heels's sly smile,
and I remembered the foot-race and the jack-knife.</p>

<p>But I was above foot-races now. Others might run to amuse me;
I would look on&mdash;perhaps distribute prizes.</p>

<p>"Some day, Sir William, will you not make me one of your deputies?"
I asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Hear the lad!" cried Sir William, pushing back his chair. "On
my soul, Captain Butler, it is time for old weather-worn Indian
commissioners like me to resign and make way for younger blood!
And his Majesty might be worse served than by Micky here; eh,
Captain Butler?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mr. Butler, in his dead voice.</p>

<p>Sir William rose and we all stood up. The Baronet, brushing Silver
Heels on his way to the door, passed his arm around her and tilted
her chin up.</p>

<p>"Now do you go to Mistress Mary and beg her to place you in the
stocks for an hour; and stay there in patience for your body's
grace. Will you promise me, Felicity?"</p>

<p>Silver Heels began to pout and tease, hooking her fingers in
Sir William's belt, but the Baronet packed her off with his message
to Mistress Molly, and went out to the portico where one of his
damned Scotch gillies attended with gaff, spear, and net-sack.</p>

<p>"Oho," thought I, "so it's salmon in the Sacondaga!" And I fell
to teasing that he might take me, too.</p>

<p>"No, Micky," he said, soberly; "it's less for sport than for
quiet reflection that I go. Don't sulk, lad. To-morrow, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Is it a promise, sir?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he laughed, "if the cards turn up right."</p>

<p>That meant he had some Indian affair on hand, and I fell back,
satisfied that his rod was a ruse, and that he was really bound
for one of the council fires at the upper castle.</p>

<p>So he went away, the sentry at the south block-house presenting
his firelock, and I back into the hall, whistling, enchanted with
my new liberty, yet somewhat concerned as to the disposal of so
vast an amount of time, now all my own.</p>

<p>I had now been enfranchised nearly three hours, and had already
used these first moments of liberty in picking a mortal quarrel
with Mr. Butler. I had begun rashly; I admitted that; yet I could
not regret the defiance. Soon or late I felt that Mr. Butler and
I would meet; I had believed it for years. Now that at last our
tryst was in sight, it neither surprised nor disturbed me, nor,
now that he was out of my sight, did I feel impatient to settle
it, so accustomed had I become to waiting for the inevitable hour.</p>

<p>I strolled through the hallway, hands in pockets, whistling "Amaryllis,"
a tune that smacked on my lips; and so came to the south casement.
Pressing my nose to the pane, I looked into the young orchard
where the robins ran in the new grass; and I found it delicious
to linger in-doors, knowing I was free to go out when I chose,
and none to cry, "Come back!"</p>

<p>In the first flush of surprise and pleasure, I have noticed that
the liberated seldom venture instantly into that freedom so dearly
desired. Open the cage of a thrush that has sung all winter of
freedom, and lo! the little thing, creeping out under the sky,
runs back to the cage, fearing the sweet freedom of its heart's
desire.</p>

<p>So I; and mounted the stairway, seeking my own little chamber.
Here I found Esk and Peter at play, letting down a string from
the open window, baited with corn, and the pullets jumping for
it with great outcry and flapping of wings.</p>

<p>So I played with them for a while, then put them out, and bolted
the door despite their cries and kicks.</p>

<p>Sitting there on my cot I surveyed my domain serenely, proud
as though it had been a mansion and all mine.</p>

<p>There were my books, not much thumbed save <em>Roderick Random</em>
and the prints of Le Brun's <em>Battles of Alexander</em>. Still
I cherished the others because gifts of Sir William or relics
of my honoured father&mdash;the two volumes called <em>An Introduction
to Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy</em>; two volumes of <em>Chambers's
Dictionary</em>; all the volumes of <em>The Gentleman's Magazine</em>
from 1748; Titan's <em>Loves of the Gods</em>&mdash;an immodest print
which I hated; my beloved "Amaryllis," called <em>A New Musical
Design</em>, and well bound; and last a manuscript much faded
and eaten by mice, yet readable, and it was a most lovely song
composed long since by a Mr. Pepys, the name of which was "Gaze
not on Swans!"</p>

<p>My chamber was small, yet pleasing. Upon the walls I had placed,
by favour of Sir William, pictures of the best running-horses
at Newmarket, also four prints of a camp by Watteau, well executed,
though French. Also, there hung above the door a fox's mask, my
whip, my hunting-horn, my spurs, and two fish-rods made for me
by Joseph Brant, who is called Thayendanegea, chief of the Mohawk
and of the Six Nations, and brother to Aunt Molly, who is no kin
of mine, though her children are Sir William's, and he is my kinsman.</p>

<p>In this room also I kept my black lead-pencil made by Faber,
a ream of paper from England, and a lump of red sealing-wax.</p>

<p>I had written, in my life, but two letters: one three years since
I wrote to Sir Peter Warren to thank him for a sum of money sent
for my use; the other to a little girl named Marie Livingston,
whom I knew in Albany when Sir William took me for the probating
of papers which I do not yet understand.</p>

<p>She wrote me a letter, which was delivered by chance, the express
having been scalped below Fonda's Bush, and signed "your cozzen
Marie," Mr. Livingston being kin to Sir William. I had not yet
written again to her, though I had meant to do so these twelve
months past. She had yellow hair which was pleasing, and she did
not resemble Silver Heels in complexion or manner, having never
flouted me. Her father gave me two peaches, some Salem sweets
called Black Jacks, and a Delaware basket to take home with me,
heaped with macaroons, crisp almonds, rock-candy, caraways, and
suckets. These I prudently finished before coming again to Johnson
Hall, and I remember I forgot to save a sucket for Silver Heels;
and her anger when I gave her the Delaware basket all sticky inside;
and how Peter licked it and blubbered while still a-licking.</p>

<p>Thus, as I sat there on my cot, scenes of my life came jostling
me like long-absent comrades, softening my mood until I fell to
thinking of those honoured parents I had never seen save in the
gray dreams which mazed my sleep. For the day that brought life
to me had robbed my honoured mother of her life; and my father,
Captain Cardigan, lying with Wolfe before Quebec, sent a runner
to Sir William enjoining him to care for me should the chance
of battle leave me orphaned.</p>

<p>So my father, with Wolfe's own song on his lips:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Why, soldiers, why<br/>
Should we be melancholy boys?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, soldiers, why?<br/>
Whose business 'tis to die&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>fell into Colonel Burton's arms at the head of Webb's regiment,
and his dying eyes saw the grenadiers wipe out the disgrace of
Montmorency with dripping bayonets. So he died, with a smile,
bidding Webb's regiment God-speed, and sending word to the dying
Wolfe that he would meet him a minute hence at Peter's gate in
heaven.</p>

<p>Thus came I naturally by my hatred for the French, nor was there
in all France sufficient wampum to wipe away the feud or cover
the dear phantom that stood in my path as I passed through life
my way.</p>

<p>Now, as I sat a-thinking by the window, below me the robins in
all the trees had begun their wild-wood vespers&mdash;hymns of the
true thrush, though not rounded with a thrush's elegance.</p>

<p>The tree-shadows, too, had grown in length, and the afternoon
sun wore a deeper blazonry through the hill haze in the west.</p>

<p>Fain to taste of the freedom which was now mine, I went out and
down the stairs, passing my lady Silver Heels strapped to a back-board
and in a temper with her sampler.</p>

<p>"Oh, Micky," she said, "my bones ache, and Mistress Molly is
with the baby, and the key is there on that brass nail."</p>

<p>"It would be wrong if I released you," said I, piously, meaning
to do it, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Oh, Micky," she said, with a kind of pitiful sweetness which
at times she used to obtain advantages from me.</p>

<p>So I took the key and unlocked the stocks, giving her feet a
pinch to let her know I was not truly as soft-hearted as she might
deem me, nor too easily won by woman's beseeching.</p>

<p>And now, mark! No sooner was she free than she gave me a slap
for the pinch and away she flew like a tree-lynx with the pack
in cry.</p>

<p>"This," thought I, "is a woman's gratitude," and I locked the
stocks again, wishing Silver Heels's feet were in them.</p>

<p>"Best have it out at once with Mistress Molly," thought I, and
went to the nursery. But before I could knock on the door, Mistress
Molly heard me with her ears of a Mohawk, and came to the door
with one finger on her lips.</p>

<p>Truly the sister of Thayendanegea was a stately and comely lady,
and a beauty, too, being little darker than some French ladies
I have seen, and of gracious and noble presence.</p>

<p>Bearing and mien were proud, yet winning; and, clothed always
as befitted the lady of Sir William Johnson, none who came into
her presence could think less of her because of her Mohawk blood
or the relation she bore to Sir William&mdash;an honest one as she
understood it.</p>

<p>She ruled the Hall with dignity and with an authority that none
dreamed of opposing. At table she was silent, yet gracious; in
the nursery she reigned a beloved and devoted mother; and if ever
a man's wife remained his sweetheart to the end, Molly Brant was
Sir William's true-love while his life endured.</p>

<p>"Why did you release Felicity from the stocks, Michael?" said
she, in a whisper.</p>

<p>So her quick Indian ear had heard the click of that lock!</p>

<p>"I had come to tell you of it, Aunt Mary," said I.</p>

<p>She looked at me keenly, then smiled.</p>

<p>"A sin confessed is half redressed. I had meant to release Felicity
some time since, but the baby had fretted herself to sleep in
my arms and I feared to put her down. But, Michael, remember in
future to ask permission when you desire to play with Felicity."</p>

<p>"Play with Felicity!" I said, scornfully. "I am past the playing
age, Aunt Molly, and I only released her because I thought her
back ached."</p>

<p>Mistress Molly looked at me again, long and keenly.</p>

<p>"Little savage," she said, gently, "mock at my people no more.
I should chide you for misusing Peter, but &mdash;I will say nothing.
You make my heart heavy sometimes."</p>

<p>"I do honour and love you, Aunt Molly!" I said; "it was not that
I mocked at Peter, but his breeches were so tight that I wondered
if Vix could bite him. I shall now go to the garden and allow
Peter to kick my shins. Anyway, I gave him all my quills and a
plummet and a screw."</p>

<p>She laughed silently, bidding me renounce my intention regarding
Peter, and so dismissed me, with her finger on her lips conjuring
silence.</p>

<p>So I pursued my interrupted way to the garden where the robins
carolled in every young fruit-tree, and the blue shadows wove
patterns on the grass.</p>

<p>Peter and Esk were on the ground playing at marbles, with Silver
Heels to judge between them.</p>

<p>Esk, perceiving me, cried out: "Knuckle down at taws, Micky!
Come on! Alleys up and fen dubs!"</p>

<p>"Fen dubs your granny!" I replied, scornfully, clean forgetting
my new dignity. "Dubs all, and bull's-eyes up is what I play,
unless you want to put in agates?" I added, covetously.</p>

<p>Esk shook his head in alarm, muttering that his agates were for
shooters; but fat Peter, sprawling belly down at the ring, offered
to put up an agate against four bull's-eyes, two agates, and twelve
miggs, and play dubs and span in a round fat.</p>

<p>The proposition was impudent, unfair, and thoroughly Indian.
I was about to spurn it when Silver Heels chirped up, "Micky doesn't
dare."</p>

<p>"Put up your agate, Peter," said I, coolly, ignoring Silver Heels;
and I fished the required marbles from my pocket and placed them
in the ring.</p>

<p>"My shot," announced Peter, hurriedly, crowding down on the line,
another outrage which, considering the presence of Silver Heels,
I passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>Peter shot and clipped a migg out of the ring. He shot again
and grazed an agate, shouting "Dubs!" to the derision of us all.</p>

<p>Then I squatted down and sent two bull's-eyes flying, but, forestalled
by Peter's hysterical "Fen dubs!" was obliged to replace one.
However, I shot again and it was dubs all, and I pocketed both
of my agates and Peter's also.</p>

<p>This brought on a wrangle, which Silver Heels settled in my favour.
Then I sat down and, with deadly accuracy, "spun," from which
comfortable position, and without spanning, I skinned the ring,
leaving Peter grief-stricken, with one migg in his grimy fist.</p>

<p>"You may have them," said I, condescendingly, dropping my spoils
into Silver Heels's lap.</p>

<p>She coloured with surprise and pleasure, scarcely finding tongue
to say, "Thank you, Micky."</p>

<p>Peter, being half Indian, demanded more play. But I was satiated
and, already remembering my dignity, regretted the lapse into
children's pastimes. I quieted Peter by giving him the remainder
of my marbles, explaining that I had renounced such games for
manlier sport, which statement, coupled with my lavish generosity,
impressed Peter and Esk, if it had not effect upon Silver Heels.</p>

<p>I sat down on the stone bench near the bee-hives and drew from
my pocket the jack-knife given me by Silver Heels as a bribe to
silence.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Silver Heels," I said, with patronizing kindness.</p>

<p>"What for?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't come then," I retorted, whereat she rose from the
grass with her skirt full of marbles and came over to the stone
bench.</p>

<p>After a moment she seated herself, eying the knife askance. I
had opened the blade. Lord, how I hated to give it back!</p>

<p>"Take it," said I, closing the blade, but not offering it to
her.</p>

<p>"Truly?" she stammered, not reaching out her hand, for fear I
should draw it away again to plague her.</p>

<p>I dropped the knife into her lap among the marbles, thrilling
at the spectacle of my own generosity.</p>

<p>She seized it, repeating:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>

"King, King, double King!<br/>
Can't take back a given thing!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"You needn't say 'King, King, double King,'" said I, offended;
"for I was not going to take it back, silly!"</p>

<p>"Truly, Michael?" she asked, looking up at me. Then she added,
sweetly, "I am sorry I bit you."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said I, "do you think you hurt me?"</p>

<p>She said nothing, playing with the marbles in her lap.</p>

<p>I sat and watched the bees fly to and fro like bullets; in the
quiet even the hills, cloaked in purple mantles, smoked with the
steam of hidden snow-drifts still lingering in ravines where arbutus
scents the forest twilight.</p>

<p>The robins had already begun their rippling curfew call; crickets
creaked from the planked walk. Behind me the voices of Peter and
Esk rose in childish dispute or excited warning to "Knuckle down
hard!" Already the delicate spring twilight stained the east with
primrose and tints of green. A calm star rose in the south.</p>

<p>Presently Silver Heels pinched me, and I felt around to pinch
back.</p>

<p>"Hush," she whispered, jogging my elbow a little, "there is a
strange Indian between us and the block-house. He has a gun, but
no blanket!"</p>

<p>For a moment a cold, tight feeling stopped my breath, not because
a strange Indian stood between me and the block-house, but because
of that instinct which stirs the fur on wild things when taken
unawares, even by friends.</p>

<p>My roughened skin had not smoothed again before I was on my feet
and advancing.</p>

<p>Instantly, too, I perceived that the Indian was a stranger to
our country. Although an Iroquois, and possibly of the Cayuga
tribe, yet he differed from our own Cayugas. He was stark naked
save for the breech-clout. But his moccasins were foreign, so
also was the pouch which swung like a Highlander's sporran from
his braided clout-string, for it was made of the scarlet feathers
of a bird which never flew in our country, and no osprey ever
furnished the fine snow-white fringe which hung from it, falling
half-way between knee and ankle.</p>

<p>Observing him at closer range, I saw he was in a plight: his
flesh dusty and striped with dry blood where thorns had brushed
him; his eyes burning with privation, and sunk deep behind the
cheek-bones.</p>

<p>As I halted, he dropped the rifle into the hollow of his left
arm and raised his right hand, palm towards me.</p>

<p>I raised my right hand, but remained motionless, bidding him
lay his rifle at his feet.</p>

<p>He replied in the Cayuga language, yet with a foreign intonation,
that the dew was heavy and would dampen the priming of his rifle;
that he had no blanket on which to lay his arms, and further,
that the sentinels at the block-houses were watching him with
loaded muskets.</p>

<p>This was true. However, I permitted him to advance no closer
until I hailed a soldier, who came clumping out of the stables,
and who instantly cocked and primed his musket.</p>

<p>Then I asked the strange Cayuga what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Peace," he said, again raising his hand, palm out; and again
I raised my hand, saying, "Peace!"</p>

<p>From the scarlet pouch he drew a little stick, six inches long,
and painted red.</p>

<p>"Look out," said I to the soldier, "that is a war-stick! If he
shifts his rifle, aim at his heart."</p>

<p>But the runner had now brought to light from his pouch other
sticks, some blood-red, some black ringed with white. These he
gravely sorted, dropping the red ones back into his pouch, and
naïvely displaying the black and white rods in a bunch.</p>

<p>"War-ragh-i-ya-gey!" he said, gently, adding, "I bear belts!"</p>

<p>It was the title given by our Mohawks to Sir William, and signified,
"One who unites two peoples together."</p>

<p>"You wish to see Chief Warragh," I repeated, "and you come with
your pouch full of little red sticks?"</p>

<p>He darted a keen glance at me, then, with a dignified gesture,
laid his rifle down in the dew.</p>

<p>A little ashamed, I turned and dismissed the soldier, then advanced
and gave the silent runner my hand, telling him that although
his moccasins and pouch were strange, nevertheless the kin of
the Cayugas were welcome to Johnson Hall. I pointed at his rifle,
bidding him resume it. He raised it in silence.</p>

<p>"He is a belt-bearer," I thought to myself; "but his message
is not of peace."</p>

<p>I said, pleasantly:</p>

<p>"By the belts you bear, follow me!"</p>

<p>The dull fire that fever kindles flickered behind his shadowy
eyes. I spoke to him kindly and conducted him to the north block-house.</p>

<p>"Bearer of belts," said I, passing the sentry, and so through
the guard-room, with the soldiers all rising at attention, and
into Sir William's Indian guest-room.</p>

<p>My Cayuga must have seen that he was fast in a trap, yet neither
by word nor glance did he appear to observe it.</p>

<p>The sun had set. A chill from the west sent the shivers creeping
up my legs as I called a soldier and bade him kindle a fire for
us. Then on my own responsibility I went into the store-room and
rummaged about until I discovered a thick red blanket. I knew
I was taking what was not mine; I knew also I was transgressing
Sir William's orders. Yet some instinct told me to act on my own
discretion, and that Sir William would have done the same had
he been here.</p>

<p>A noise at the guard door brought me running out of the store-room
to find my Cayuga making to force his way out, and the soldiers
shoving him into the guest-room again.</p>

<p>"Fall back!" I cried, my wits working like shuttles; and quickly
added in the Cayuga tongue: "Cayugas are free people; free to
stay, free to go. Open the door for my brother who fears his brother's
fireside!"</p>

<p>There was a silence; the soldiers stood back respectfully; a
sergeant opened the outer door. But the Indian, turning his hot
eyes on me, swung on his heel and re-entered the guest-room, drawing
the flint from his rifle as he walked.</p>

<p>I followed and laid the thick red blanket on his dusty shoulders.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," I called, "send McCloud for meat and drink, and notify
Sir William as soon as he arrives that his brothers of the Cayuga
would speak to him with belts!"</p>

<p>I was not sure of the etiquette required of me after this, not
knowing whether to leave the Cayuga alone or bear him company.
Tribes differ, so do nations in their observance of these forms.
One thing more puzzled me: here was a belt-bearer with messages
from some distant and strange branch of the Cayuga tribe, yet
the etiquette of their allies, our Mohawks, decreed that belts
should be delivered by sachems or chiefs, well escorted, and through
the smoke of council fires never theoretically extinguished between
allies and kindred people.</p>

<p>One thing I of course knew: that a guest, once admitted, should
never be questioned until he had eaten and slept.</p>

<p>But whether or not I was committing a breach of etiquette by
squatting there by the fire with my Cayuga, I did not know.</p>

<p>However, considering the circumstances, I called out for a soldier
to bring two pipes and tobacco; and when they were fetched to
me, I filled one and passed it to the Cayuga, then filled the
other, picked a splinter from the fire, lighted mine, and passed
the blazing splinter to my guest.</p>

<p>If his ideas on etiquette were disturbed, he did not show it.
He puffed at his pipe and drew his blanket close about his naked
body, staring into the fire with the grave, absent air of a cat
on a wintry night.</p>

<p>Now, stealing a glance at his scalp-lock, I saw by the fire-light
the stumps of two quills, with a few feather-fronds still clinging
to them, fastened in the knot on his crown. The next covert glance
told me that they were the ragged stubs of the white-headed eagle's
feathers, and that my guest was a chief. This set me in a quandary.
What was a strange Cayuga chief doing here without escort, without
blanket, yet bearing belts? Etiquette absolutely forbade a single
question. Was I, in my inexperience, treating him properly? Would
my ignorance of what was due him bring trouble and difficulty
to Sir William when he returned?</p>

<p>Suddenly resolved to clear Sir William of any suspicion of awkwardness,
and at the risk of my being considered garrulous, I rose and said:</p>

<p>"My brother is a man and a chief; he will understand that in
the absence of my honoured kinsman, Sir William Johnson, and in
the absence of officers in authority, the hospitality of Johnson
Hall falls upon me.</p>

<p>"Ignorant of my brother's customs, I bid him welcome, because
he is naked, tired, and hungry. I kindle his fire; I bring him
pipe and food; and now I bid him sleep in peace behind doors that
open at his will."</p>

<p>Then the Cayuga rose to his full noble height, bending his burning
eyes on mine. There was a silence; and so, angry or grateful,
I knew not which, he resumed his seat by the fire, and I went
out through the guard-room into the still, starry night.</p>

<p>But I did not tarry to sniff at the stars nor search the dewy
herbage for those pale blossoms which open only on such a night,
hiding elf-pearls in their fairy petals. Straightway I sought
Mistress Molly in the nursery, and told her what I had done. She
listened gravely and without comment or word of blame or praise,
which was like all Indians. But she questioned me, and I described
the strange belt-bearer from his scalp-lock to the sole of his
moccasin.</p>

<p>"Cayuga," she said, softly; "what make was his rifle?"</p>

<p>"Not English, not French," I said. "The barrel near the breech
bore figures like those on Sir William's duelling pistols."</p>

<p>"Spanish," she said, dreamily. "In his language did he pronounce
<em>agh</em> like <em>ahh</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Molly."</p>

<p>She remained silent a moment, thoughtful eyes on mine. Then she
smiled and dismissed me, but I begged her to tell me from whence
my Cayuga came.</p>

<p>"I will tell you this," she said. "He comes from very, very far
away, and he follows some customs of the Tuscaroras, which they
in turn borrow from a tribe which lives so far away that I should
go to sleep in counting the miles for you."</p>

<p>With that she shut the nursery door, and I, no wiser than before,
and understanding that Mistress Molly did not mean I should be
wiser, sat down on the stairs to think and to wait for Sir William.</p>

<p>A moment later a man on horseback rode out of our stables at
a gallop and clattered away down the hill. I listened for a moment,
then thought of other things.</p>
