<p><em>THE STAGE </em>stopped in front of the Plympton Hotel two
days afterward. There were several inside passengers, but with
these we have nothing to do. Beside the driver sat a stout boy,
with a keen, expressive face, who looked full of life and activity.</p>

<p>"Here you are," said the driver, with a final flourish of the
whip.</p>

<p>"I see that, old chap," said the boy; "but I don’t stop here."</p>

<p>"Where are you goin’ to put up?"</p>

<p>"The man’s name is Middleton. He is to have the honor of feeding
and lodging me for the present."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean Nathan Middleton. I don’t envy you. He keeps
the meanest table in town."</p>

<p>"Does he? Then I shall take the liberty to reform his table."</p>

<p>"I don’t believe you can do it. There’s only one person in town
meaner than old Middleton, and that’s his wife. What makes you
board with them?"</p>

<p>"Can’t help it. He went to school with my father, and he left
orders in his will that I should be taken care of by Middleton.
You’ll take me up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you’ll have to wait till I land the mail and discharge
cargo."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tom Temple was deposited at the gate of his
future guardian. Nathan Middleton hastened to welcome him with
the consideration due to so wealthy a boarder.</p>

<p>"My dear young friend," he begun expansively, "I am indeed glad
to welcome the son of my old friend to my humble home."</p>

<p>If Mr. Middleton expected Tom to reply in a similar manner, he
soon realized his mistake. Our hero was not one of the gushing
kind.</p>

<p>"All right," he answered coolly. "Will you help me in with my
trunk?"</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton mechanically obeyed, not seeing his way clear to
any more sentiment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Middleton appeared in the front entry as the trunk was set
down.</p>

<p>"Corinthia, my dear, this is the son of my deceased friend, Stephen
Temple."</p>

<p>Mrs. Middleton’s thin figure was clad in a thin, slazy silk of
very scant pattern, and her pinched features wore an artificial
smile.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Temple?" she said.</p>

<p>"I’m well, but hungry," responded Tom readily.</p>

<p>"Is tea nearly ready, Corinthia?" asked her husband.</p>

<p>"It will be ready in fifteen minutes. If you will show Mr. Temple
to his room, he won’t have long to wait."</p>

<p>The two together carried up Tom’s trunk, and deposited it in
a scantily furnished chamber, which it was announced he was to
occupy.</p>

<p>"I hope, my young friend, you will like your apartment," said
Nathan.</p>

<p>Tom looked about him critically.</p>

<p>"I don’t see any rocking-chair," he said.</p>

<p>"I was not aware that rocking-chairs were considered necessary
in a sleeping apartment," said Nathan, who did not fancy buying
any extra furniture.</p>

<p>"I study in my room," said Tom, "and I need a rocking-chair to
support my spine."</p>

<p>"I hope your spine is not affected," said Mr. Middleton, rather
astonished.</p>

<p>"It’s very weak," said Tom gravely.</p>

<p>"You don’t look it," said Nathan, surveying the strong form of
his young friend.</p>

<p>"Appearances are deceitful," said Tom sententiously.</p>

<p>"I will procure you a rocking-chair," said Mr. Middleton, sighing
at the thought of the extra expense. "I will now leave you to
any little preparations you may desire to make. I will call you
when supper is ready."</p>

<p>So Tom was left alone.</p>

<p>Our hero sat down on the bed and reflected.</p>

<p>"I don’t fancy the old man’s looks," he thought. "He looks mean,
and so does his wife. I have an idea they’ll try to starve me,
but if they do I’ll make it lively for them, or my name isn’t
Tom Temple. I know, from what Sharp told me, that they are going
to get a steep price for my board, and I don’t want them to make
too much out of me. This bed is as hard as a brick. No wonder—it’s
filled with straw. I suppose mattresses come too high. I see I
shall have to give some lessons to my worthy friends on the subject
of keeping house. I’ve got plenty of money, and I don’t see why
I shouldn’t go in for comfort. I could stand hard fare if there
was any need of it, but there isn’t."</p>

<p>Soon the feet of Mr. Middleton were heard on the stairs.</p>

<p>"My young friend," he said, as Tom opened the door at his gentle
tap, "supper is ready."</p>

<p>"My old friend," said Tom promptly, "I am ready, too."</p>

<p>"What a very extraordinary boy!" thought Mr. Middleton. "Why
should he call me old? I am older than he, to be sure, but I am
not aged."</p>

<p>He led the way into the dining-room. Mrs. Middleton was already
seated at the table. It did not look particularly inviting. There
was a plate of bread, cut in thin slices, a very small plate of
butter, a plate of consumptive looking gingerbread and half a
dozen slices of meat about the thickness of a wafer.</p>

<p>"Not much chance of overeating myself here," thought Tom. "This
won’t do at all."</p>

<p>"Will you be seated, Mr. Temple," said the lady. "Shall I give
you some tea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma’am."</p>

<p>Corinthia poured out a cup of colored liquid, into which she
poured about half a teaspoonful of milk and an extremely small
portion of sugar.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, ma’am," said Tom, "but I am not afraid of milk or
sugar."</p>

<p>"Really!" said the lady, not quite comprehending.</p>

<p>"I’ll put in the sugar and milk myself," said Tom, and he deliberately
poured out a part of his tea into the saucer, filling up with
milk, and deposited two full spoonfuls of sugar in the same.</p>

<p>This was wasteful extravagance in the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Middleton.</p>

<p>"I never knew any one use so much sugar and milk, Mr. Temple,"
she said with asperity.</p>

<p>"You haven’t any objection, have you?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not," she answered bridling; "but it seems so
singular."</p>

<p>"Does it? That’s just what I thought of your way."</p>

<p>"Shall I help you to a slice of meat, Mr. Temple?" asked Nathan.</p>

<p>"You’d better give me two or three; they seem to be very small,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Middleton looked far from amiable as she heard this remark.
Her husband contented himself with putting two of the wafers on
his young friend’s plate.</p>

<p>"We don’t always have meat at supper," said his wife, fearing
that Tom would expect it as a general thing, "but we supposed
your journey might make you hungry."</p>

<p>"So it has. Mr. Middleton will you help me to more meat?" said
Tom, who had already disposed of the two wafers.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Middleton exchanged glances of dismay.</p>

<p>"I think you’ll have to send for more," said Tom coolly. "I’m
delicate, and the doctor says I must eat plenty of meat."</p>

<p>"<em>My</em> doctor tells me meat is injurious at supper," said
Mrs. Middleton, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Tell him he doesn’t know much. Another piece of butter, Mr.
Middleton, if you please? It would kill me to go without meat."</p>

<p>"You don’t look delicate."</p>

<p>"I am, though. I tried doing without meat at supper for a week,
and what do you think happened?"</p>

<p>Mr. Middleton looked curious.</p>

<p>"I got up in the night—fast asleep, you know—and set the bed-clothes
on fire. Came near burning up the house. All on account of not
eating meat."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" exclaimed Mrs. Middleton alarmed. "Do you walk
in your sleep, Mr. Temple?"</p>

<p>"Not when I’ve had a hearty supper, ma’am."</p>

<p>"I think, Corinthia, you’d better get some meat," said her husband,
who looked anxious.</p>

<p>"Warm meat—beefsteak, for instance—is better than cold to make
me sleep," said Tom. "By the way, Mrs. Middleton, the butter is
out, and so is the bread."</p>

<p>"I never saw so voracious a boy," said the lady to herself. "He
really has an ungovernable appetite."</p>

<p>But she got the bread and the butter. Tom generally managed to
have his way.</p>

<p>In justice to him I must say that he had no more appetite than
is usual to a hearty, growing boy, but Mr. and Mrs. Middleton
stinted themselves out of regard to economy, and to them he seemed
to eat enough for six.</p>
