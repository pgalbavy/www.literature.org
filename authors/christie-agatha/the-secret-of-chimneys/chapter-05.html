<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>There is often a flaw in the best-laid plans. George Lomax had
made one mistake—there was a weak spot in his preparations. The
weak spot was Bill.</p>

<p>Bill Eversleigh was an extremely nice lad. He was a good cricketer
and a scratch golfer, he had pleasant manners, and an amiable
disposition, but his position in the Foreign Office had been gained,
not by brains, but by good connections. For the work he had to
do he was quite suitable. He was more or less George’s dog. He
did no responsible or brainy work. His part was to be constantly
at George’s elbow, to interview unimportant people whom George
didn’t want to see, to run errands, and generally to make himself
useful. All this Bill carried out faithfully enough. When George
was absent, Bill stretched himself out in the biggest chair and
read the sporting news, and in so doing he was merely carrying
out a time-honoured tradition.</p>

<p>Being accustomed to send Bill on errands, George had dispatched
him to the Union Castle offices to find out when the <em>Granarth
Castle</em> was due in. Now, in common with most well-educated
young Englishmen, Bill had a pleasant, but quite inaudible voice.
Any elocution master would have found fault with his pronunciation
of the word Granarth. It might have been anything. The Clerk took
it to be Carnfrae. The <em>Carnfrae Castle</em> was due in on
the following Thursday. He said so. Bill thanked him and went
out. George Lomax accepted the information and laid his plans
accordingly. He knew nothing about Union Castle liners, and took
it for granted that James McGrath would duly arrive on Thursday.</p>

<p>Therefore, at the moment he was buttonholing Lord Caterham on
the steps of the club on Wednesday morning, he would have been
greatly surprised to learn that the <em>Granarth Castle</em> had
docked at Southampton the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>At two o’clock that afternoon Anthony Cade, travelling under
the name of Jimmy McGrath, stepped out of the boat train at Waterloo,
hailed a taxi, and after a moment’s hesitation ordered the driver
to proceed to the Blitz Hotel.</p>

<p>"One might as well be comfortable," said Anthony to himself,
as he looked with some interest out of the taxi windows.</p>

<p>It was exactly fourteen years since he had been in London.</p>

<p>He arrived at the hotel, booked a room, and then went for a short
stroll along the Embankment. It was rather pleasant to be back
in London again. Everything was changed of course. There had been
a little restaurant there—just past Blackfriars Bridge—where he
had dined fairly often, in company with other earnest lads. He
had been a Socialist then, and worn a flowing red tie. Young—very
young.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps back to the Blitz. Just as he was crossing
the road, a man jostled against him, nearly making him lose his
balance. They both recovered themselves, and the man muttered
an apology, his eyes scanning Anthony’s face narrowly. He was
a short, thickset man of the working classes, with something foreign
in his appearance.</p>

<p>Anthony went on into the hotel, wondering, as he did so, what
had inspired that searching glance. Nothing in it probably. The
deep tan of his face was somewhat unusual looking amongst these
pallid Londoners and it had attracted the fellow’s attention.
He went up to his room and, led by a sudden impulse, crossed to
the looking-glass and stood studying his face in it. Of the few
friends of the old days—just a chosen few—was it likely that any
of them would recognize him now if they were to meet him face
to face? He shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>When he had left London he had been just eighteen—a fair, slightly
chubby boy, with a misleading seraphic expression. Small chance
that the boy would be recognized in the lean, brown-faced man
with the quizzical expression.</p>

<p>The telephone beside the bed rang, and Anthony crossed to the
receiver.</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>The voice of the desk clerk answered him.</p>

<p>"Mr. James McGrath?"</p>

<p>"Speaking."</p>

<p>"A gentleman has called to see you."</p>

<p>Anthony was rather astonished.</p>

<p>"To see <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a foreign gentleman."</p>

<p>"What’s his name?"</p>

<p>There was a slight pause, and then the clerk said:</p>

<p>"I will send up a page boy with his card."</p>

<p>Anthony replaced the receiver and waited. In a few minutes there
was a knock on the door and a small page appeared bearing a card
upon a salver.</p>

<p>Anthony took it. The following was the name engraved upon it:</p>

<p>  <em>BARON LOLOPRETJZYL</em>.</p>

<p>He now fully appreciated the desk clerk’s pause.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he stood studying the card, and then made
up his mind.</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman up."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Baron <em>Lolopretjzyl</em> was ushered
into the room, a big man with an immense fan-like black beard
and a high, bald forehead.</p>

<p>He brought his heels together with a click, and bowed.</p>

<p>"Mr. McGrath," he said.</p>

<p>Anthony imitated his movements as nearly as possible.</p>

<p>"Baron," he said. Then, drawing forward a chair. "Pray sit down.
I have not, I think, had the pleasure of meeting you before?"</p>

<p>"That is so," agreed the Baron, seating himself. "It is my misfortune,"
he added politely.</p>

<p>"And mine also," responded Anthony, on the same note.</p>

<p>"Let us now to business come," said the Baron. "I represent in
London the Loyalist party of Herzoslovakia."</p>

<p>"And represent it admirably, I am sure," murmured Anthony.</p>

<p>The Baron bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment.</p>

<p>"You are too kind," he said stiffly. "Mr. McGrath, I will not
from you conceal anything. The moment has come for the Restoration
of the Monarchy, in abeyance since the martyrdom of His Most Gracious
Majesty King Nicolas IV of blessed memory."</p>

<p>"Amen," murmured Anthony. "I mean Hear, Hear."</p>

<p>"On the throne will be placed His Highness Prince Michael who
the support of the British Government has."</p>

<p>"Splendid," said Anthony. "It’s very kind of you to tell me all
this."</p>

<p>"Everything arranged is—when you come here to trouble make."</p>

<p>The Baron fixed him with a stern eye.</p>

<p>"My dear Baron," protested Anthony.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know what I am talking about. You have with you
the Memoirs of the late Count Stylptitch."</p>

<p>He fixed Anthony with an accusing eye.</p>

<p>"And if I have? What have the Memoirs of Count Stylptitch to
do with Prince Michael?"</p>

<p>"They will cause scandals."</p>

<p>"Most memoirs do that," said Anthony soothingly.</p>

<p>"Of many secrets he the knowledge had. Should he reveal but the
quarter of them, Europe into war plunged may be."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Anthony. "It can’t be as bad as all that."</p>

<p>"An unfavourable opinion of the Obolovitch will abroad be spread.
So democratic is the English spirit."</p>

<p>"I can quite believe," said Anthony, "that the Obolovitch may
have been a trifle high-handed now and again. It runs in the blood.
But people in England expect that sort of thing from the Balkans.
I don’t know why they should, but they do."</p>

<p>"You do not understand," said the Baron. "You do not understand
at all. And my lips sealed are." He sighed.</p>

<p>"What exactly are you afraid of?" asked Anthony.</p>

<p>"Until I have read the Memoirs I do not know," explained the
Baron simply. "But there is sure to be something. These great
diplomats are always indiscreet. The apple cart upset will be,
as the saying goes."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Anthony kindly. "I’m sure you’re taking altogether
too pessimistic a view of the thing. I know all about publishers—they
sit on manuscripts and hatch ’em like eggs. It will be at least
a year before the thing is published."</p>

<p>"Either a very deceitful or a very simple young man you are.
All is arranged for the Memoirs in a Sunday newspaper to come
out immediately."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Anthony was somewhat taken aback. "But you can always deny
everything," he said hopefully.</p>

<p>The Baron shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"No, no, through the hat you talk. Let us to business come. One
thousand pounds you are to have, is it not so? You see, I have
the good information got."</p>

<p>"I certainly congratulate the Intelligence Department of the
Loyalists."</p>

<p>"Then I to you offer fifteen hundred."</p>

<p>Anthony stared at him in amazement, then shook his head ruefully.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid it can’t be done," he said, with regret.</p>

<p>"Good. I to you offer two thousand."</p>

<p>"You tempt me, Baron, you tempt me. But I still say it can’t
be done."</p>

<p>"Your own price name, then."</p>

<p>"I’m afraid you don’t understand the position. I’m perfectly
willing to believe that you are on the side of the angels, and
that these Memoirs may damage your cause. Nevertheless, I’ve undertaken
the job, and I’ve got to carry it through. See? I can’t allow
myself to be bought off by the other side. That kind of thing
isn’t done."</p>

<p>The Baron listened very attentively. At the end of Anthony’s
speech he nodded his head several times.</p>

<p>"I see. Your honour as an English gentleman it is?"</p>

<p>"Well, we don’t put it that way ourselves," said Anthony. "But
I dare say, allowing for a difference in vocabulary, that we both
mean much the same thing."</p>

<p>The Baron rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"For the English honour I much respect have," he announced. "We
must another way try. I wish you good morning."</p>

<p>He drew his heels together, clicked, bowed and marched out of
the room, holding himself stiffly erect.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder what he meant by that," mused Anthony. "Was it
a threat? Not that I’m in the least afraid of old Lollipop. Rather
a good name for him, that, by the way. I shall call him Baron
Lollipop."</p>

<p>He took a turn or two up and down the room, undecided on his
next course of action. The date stipulated upon for delivering
the manuscript was a little over a week ahead. To-day was the
5th of October. Anthony had no intention of handing it over before
the last moment. Truth to tell, he was by now feverishly anxious
to read these Memoirs. He had meant to do so on the boat coming
over, but had been laid low with a touch of fever, and not at
all in the mood for deciphering crabbed and illegible handwriting,
for none of the manuscript was typed. He was now more than ever
determined to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>There was the other job too.</p>

<p>On an impulse, he picked up the telephone book and looked up
the name of Revel. There were six Revels in the book: Edward Henry
Revel, surgeon, of Harley Street; James Revel &amp; Co., saddlers;
Lennox Revel of Abbotbury Mansions, Hampstead; Miss Mary Revel
with an address in Ealing; Hon. Mrs. Timothy Revel of 487, Pont
Street; and Mrs. Willis Revel of 42, Cadogan Square. Eliminating
the saddlers and Miss Mary Revel, that gave him four names to
investigate—and there was no reason to suppose that the lady lived
in London at all! He shut up the book with a short shake of the
head.</p>

<p>"For the moment I’ll leave it to chance," he said. "Something
usually turns up."</p>

<p>The luck of the Anthony Cades of this world is perhaps in some
measure due to their own belief in it. Anthony found what he was
after not half an hour later, when he was turning over the pages
of an illustrated paper. It was a representation of some tableau
organized by the Duchess of Perth. Below the central figure, a
woman in Eastern dress, was the inscription:</p>

<p>"The Hon. Mrs. Timothy Revel as Cleopatra. Before her marriage,
Mrs. Revel was the Hon. Virginia Cawthron, a daughter of Lord
Edgbaston."</p>

<p>Anthony looked at the picture some time, slowly pursing up his
lips, as though to whistle. Then he tore out the whole page, folded
it up and put it in his pocket. He went upstairs again, unlocked
his suit-case and took out the packet of letters. He took out
the folded page from his pocket and slipped it under the string
that held them together.</p>

<p>Then, at a sudden sound behind him, he wheeled round sharply.
A man was standing in the doorway, the kind of man whom Anthony
had fondly imagined existed only in the chorus of a Comic Opera.
A sinister-looking figure, with a squat brutal head and lips drawn
back in an evil grin.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing here?" asked Anthony. "And who
let you come up?"</p>

<p>"I pass where I please," said the stranger. His voice was guttural
and foreign, though his English was idiomatic enough.</p>

<p>"Another Dago," thought Anthony.</p>

<p>"Well, get out, do you hear?" he went on aloud.</p>

<p>The man’s eyes were fixed on the packet of letters which Anthony
had caught up.</p>

<p>"I will get out when you have given me what I have come for."</p>

<p>"And what’s that, may I ask?"</p>

<p>The man took a step nearer.</p>

<p>"The Memoirs of Count Stylptitch," he hissed.</p>

<p>"It’s impossible to take you seriously," said Anthony. "You’re
so completely the stage villain. I like your get up very much.
Who sent you here? Baron Lollipop?"</p>

<p>"Baron——?" The man jerked out a string of harsh-sounding consonants.</p>

<p>"So that’s how you pronounce it, is it? A cross between gargling
and barking like a dog. I don’t think I could say it myself—my
throat’s not made that way. I shall have to go on calling him
Lollipop. So he sent you, did he?"</p>

<p>But he received a vehement negative. His visitor went so far
as to spit upon the suggestion in a very realistic manner. Then
he drew from his pocket a sheet of paper which he threw upon the
table.</p>

<p>"Look," he said. "Look and tremble, accursed Englishman."</p>

<p>Anthony looked with some interest, not troubling to fulfil the
latter part of the command. On the paper was traced the crude
design of a human hand in red.</p>

<p>"It looks like a hand," he remarked. "But, if you say so, I’m
quite prepared to admit that it’s a cubist picture of Sunset at
the North Pole."</p>

<p>"It is the sign of the Comrades of the Red Hand. I am a Comrade
of the Red Hand."</p>

<p>"You don’t say so," said Anthony, looking at him with much interest.
"Are the others all like you? I don’t know what the Eugenic Society
would have to say about it."</p>

<p>The man snarled angrily.</p>

<p>"Dog," he said. "Worse than dog. Paid slave of an effete monarchy.
Give me the Memoirs, and you shall go unscathed. Such is the clemency
of the Brotherhood."</p>

<p>"It’s very kind of them, I’m sure," said Anthony, "but I’m afraid
that both they and you are labouring under a misapprehension.
My instructions are to deliver the manuscript—not to your amiable
Society, but to a certain firm of publishers."</p>

<p>"Pah!" laughed the other. "Do you think you will ever be permitted
to reach that office alive? Enough of this fool’s talk. Hand over
the papers, or I shoot."</p>

<p>He drew a revolver from his pocket and brandished it in the air.</p>

<p>But there he misjudged his Anthony Cade. He was not used to men
who could act as quickly—or quicker than they could think. Anthony
did not wait to be covered by the revolver. Almost as soon as
the other got it out of his pocket, Anthony had sprung forward
and knocked it out of his hand. The force of the blow sent the
man swinging round, so that he presented his back to his assailant.</p>

<p>The chance was too good to be missed. With one mighty, well-directed
kick, Anthony sent the man flying through the doorway into the
corridor, where he collapsed in a heap.</p>

<p>Anthony stepped out after him, but the doughty Comrade of the
Red Hand had had enough. He got nimbly to his feet and fled down
the passage. Anthony did not pursue him, but went back into his
own room.</p>

<p>"So much for the Comrades of the Red Hand," he remarked. "Picturesque
appearance, but easily routed by direct action. How the hell did
that fellow get in, I wonder? There’s one thing that stands out
pretty clearly—this isn’t going to be quite such a soft job as
I thought. I’ve already fallen foul of both the Loyalist and the
Revolutionary parties. Soon, I suppose, the Nationalists and the
Independent Liberals will be sending up a delegation. One thing’s
fixed. I start on that manuscript to-night."</p>

<p>Looking at his watch, Anthony discovered that it was nearly nine
o’clock, and he decided to dine where he was. He did not anticipate
any more surprise visits, but he felt that it was up to him to
be on his guard. He had no intention of allowing his suit-case
to be rifled whilst he was downstairs in the Grill Room. He rang
the bell and asked for the Menu, selected a couple of dishes and
ordered a bottle of Bordeaux. The waiter took the order and withdrew.</p>

<p>Whilst he was waiting for the meal to arrive, he got out the
package of manuscript and put it on the table with the letters.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and the waiter entered with a
small table and the accessories of the meal. Anthony had strolled
over to the mantelpiece. Standing there with his back to the room,
he was directly facing the mirror, and idly glancing in it he
noticed a curious thing.</p>

<p>The waiter’s eyes were glued on the parcel of manuscript. Shooting
little glances sideways at Anthony’s immovable back, he moved
softly round the table. His hands were twitching, and he kept
passing his tongue over his dry lips. Anthony observed him more
closely. He was a tall man, supple like all waiters, with a clean-shaven,
mobile face. An Italian, Anthony thought, not a Frenchman.</p>

<p>At the critical moment Anthony wheeled round abruptly. The waiter
started slightly, but pretended to be doing something with the
salt cellar.</p>

<p>"What’s your name?" asked Anthony abruptly.</p>

<p>"Giuseppe, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Italian, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Anthony spoke to him in that language, and the man answered fluently
enough. Finally Anthony dismissed him with a nod, but all the
while he was eating the excellent meal which Giuseppe served to
him, he was thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>Had he been mistaken? Was Giuseppe’s interest in the parcel just
ordinary curiosity? It might be so, but remembering the feverish
intensity of the man’s excitement, Anthony decided against that
theory. All the same, he was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Dash it all," said Anthony to himself, "every one can’t be after
the blasted manuscript. Perhaps I’m fancying things."</p>

<p>Dinner concluded and cleared away, he applied himself to the
perusal of the Memoirs. Owing to the illegibility of the late
Count’s handwriting, the business was a slow one. Anthony’s yawns
succeeded one another with suspicious rapidity. At the end of
the fourth chapter, he gave it up.</p>

<p>So far, he had found the Memoirs insufferably dull, with no hint
of scandal of any kind.</p>

<p>He gathered up the letters and the wrapping of the manuscript
which were lying in a heap together on the table and locked them
up in the suit-case. Then he locked the door, and as an additional
precaution put a chair against it. On the chair he placed the
water-bottle from the bathroom.</p>

<p>Surveying these preparations with some pride, he undressed and
got into bed. He had one more shot at the Count’s Memoirs, but
felt his eyelids drooping, and stuffing the manuscript under his
pillow, he switched out the light and fell asleep almost immediately.</p>

<p>It must have been some four hours later that he awoke with a
start. What had awakened him he did not know—perhaps a sound,
perhaps only the consciousness of danger which in men who have
led an adventurous life is very fully developed.</p>

<p>For a moment he lay quite still, trying to focus his impressions.
He could hear a very stealthy rustle, and then he became aware
of a denser blackness somewhere between him and the window—on
the floor by the suit-case.</p>

<p>With a sudden spring, Anthony jumped out of bed, switching the
light on as he did so. A figure sprang up from where it had been
kneeling by the suit-case.</p>

<p>It was the waiter, Giuseppe. In his right hand gleamed a long
thin knife. He hurled himself straight upon Anthony, who was by
now fully conscious of his own danger. He was unarmed and Giuseppe
was evidently thoroughly at home with his own weapon.</p>

<p>Anthony sprang to one side, and Giuseppe missed him with the
knife. The next minute the two men were rolling on the floor together,
locked in a close embrace. The whole of Anthony’s faculties were
centred on keeping a close grip of Giuseppe’s right arm so that
he would be unable to use the knife. He bent it slowly back. At
the same time he felt the Italian’s other hand clutching at his
windpipe, stifling him, choking. And still, desperately, he bent
the right arm back.</p>

<p>There was a sharp tinkle as the knife fell on the floor. At the
same time, the Italian extricated himself with a swift twist from
Anthony’s grasp. Anthony sprang up too, but made the mistake of
moving towards the door to cut off the other’s retreat. He saw,
too late, that the chair and the water-bottle were just as he
had arranged them.</p>

<p>Giuseppe had entered by the window, and it was the window he
made for now. In the instant’s respite given him by Anthony’s
move toward the door, he had sprung out on the balcony, leaped
over to the adjoining balcony and had disappeared through the
adjoining window.</p>

<p>Anthony knew well enough that it was of no use to pursue him.
His way of retreat was doubtless fully assured. Anthony would
merely get himself into trouble.</p>

<p>He walked over to the bed, thrusting his hand beneath the pillow
and drawing out the Memoirs. Lucky that they had been there and
not in the suit-case. He crossed over to the suit-case and looked
inside, meaning to take out the letters.</p>

<p>Then he swore softly under his breath.</p>

<p><em>The letters were gone.</em></p>
