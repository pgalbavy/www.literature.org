<p>The journey to Fortuna is a scant fifty miles by measure, but within
those eighty kilometers there is a lapse of centuries in standards.
As Bud and De Lancey rode out of battle-scarred Agua Negra they
traveled a good road, well worn by the Mexican wood-wagons that hauled
in mesquit from the hills. Then, as they left the town and the wood
roads scattered, the highway changed by degrees to a broad trail, dug
deep by the feet of pack-animals and marked but lightly with wheels.
It followed along the railroad, cutting over hills and down through
gulches, and by evening they were in the heart of Old Mexico.
</p><p>Here were men in sandals and women barefooted; chickens tied up by the
legs outside of brush <u>jacales</u>; long-nosed hogs, grunting fiercely
as they skirmished for food; and half-naked children, staring like
startled rabbits at the strangers.
</p><p>The smell of garlic and fresh-roasting coffee was in the air as they
drew into town for the night, and their room was an adobe chamber with
tile floor and iron bars across the windows. Riding south the next
day they met <u>vaqueros</u>, mounted on wiry mustangs, who saluted them
gravely, taking no shame for their primitive wooden saddle-trees and
pommels as broad as soup-plates.
</p><p>As they left the broad plain and clambered up over the back of a
mountain they passed Indian houses, brush-built and thatched with
long, coarse grasses, and by the fires the women ground corn on stone
<u>metates</u> as their ancestors had done before the fall. For in Mexico
there are two peoples, the Spaniards and the natives, and the Indians
still remember the days when they were free.
</p><p>It was through such a land that Phil and Hooker rode on their gallant
ponies, leading a pack-animal well loaded with supplies from the north,
and as the people gazed from their miserable hovels and saw their
outfit they wondered at their wealth.
</p><p>But if they were moved to envy, the bulk of a heavy pistol, showing
through the swell of each coat, discouraged them from going further;
and the cold, searching look of the tall cowboy as he ambled past
stayed in their memory long after the pleasant "_Adios!_" of De Lancey
had been forgotten.
</p><p>Americans were scarce in those days, and what few came by were riding
to the north. How bold, then, must this big man be who rode in
front--and certainly he had some great reward before him to risk such a
horse among the <u>revoltosos</u>! So reasoned the simple-minded natives of
the mountains, gazing in admiration at Copper Bottom, and for that look
in their eyes Bud returned his forbidding stare.
</p><p>There is something about a good horse that fascinates the average
Mexican--perhaps because they breed the finest themselves and are in a
position to judge--but Hooker had developed a romantic attachment for
his trim little chestnut mount and he resented their wide-eyed gapings
as a lover resents glances at his lady. This, and a frontier education,
rendered him short-spoken and gruff with the <u>paisanos</u> and it was left
to the cavalier De Lancey to do the courtesies of the road.
</p><p>As the second day wore on they dipped down into a rocky cañon, with
huge cliffs of red and yellow sandstone glowing in the slanting
sun, and soon they broke out into a narrow valley, well wooded with
sycamores and mesquits and giant hackberry-trees.
</p><p>The shrill toots of a dummy engine came suddenly from down below and
a mantle of black smoke rose majestically against the sky--then, at a
turn of the trail, they topped the last hill and Fortuna lay before
them.
</p><p>In that one moment they were set back again fifty miles--clear back
across the line--for Fortuna was American, from the power-house on the
creek-bank to the mammoth concentrator on the hill.
</p><p>All the buildings were of stone, square and uniform. First a central
plaza, flanked with offices and warehouses; then behind them barracks
and lodging-houses and trim cottages in orderly rows; and over across
the cañon loomed the huge bulk of the mill and the concentrator with
its aërial tramway and endless row of gliding buckets.
</p><p>Only on the lower hills, where the rough country rock cropped up and
nature was at its worst, only there did the real Mexico creep in and
assert itself in a crude huddle of half-Indian huts; the dwellings of
the care-free natives.
</p><p>"Well, by Jove!" exclaimed De Lancey, surveying the scene with an
appraising eye, "this doesn't look very much like Mexico--or a
revolution, either!"
</p><p>"No, it don't," admitted Bud; "everything running full blast, too. Look
at that ore-train coming around the hill!"
</p><p>"Gee, what a burg!" raved Phil. "Say, there's some class to this--what?
If I mistake not, we'll be able to find a few congenial spirits here to
help us spend our money. Talk about a company town! I'll bet you their
barroom is full of Americans. There's the corral down below--let's ride
by and leave our horses and see what's the price of drinks. They can't
faze me, whatever it is--we doubled our money at the line."
</p><p>Financially considered, they had done just that--for, for every
American dollar in their pockets they could get two that were just as
good, except for the picture on the side. This in itself was a great
inducement for a ready spender and, finding good company at the Fortuna
hotel bar, Phil bought five dollars' worth of drinks, threw down a
five-dollar bill, and got back five dollars--Mex.
</p><p>The proprietor, a large and jovial boniface, pulled off this fiscal
miracle with the greatest good humor and then, having invited them
to partake of a very exquisite mixture of his own invention, propped
himself upon his elbows across the bar and inquired with an ingenuous
smile:
</p><p>"Well, which away are you boys traveling, if I may ask?"
</p><p>"Oh, down below a ways," answered De Lancey, who always constituted
himself the board of strategy. "Just rambling around a little--how's
the country around here now?"
</p><p>"Oh, quiet, quiet!" assured their host. "These Mexicans don't like the
cold weather much--they would freeze, you know, if it was not for that
<u>zarape</u> which they wind about them so!"
</p><p>He made a motion as of a native wrapping his entire wardrobe about his
neck and smiled, and De Lancey knew that he was no Mexican. And yet
that soft "which away" of his betrayed a Spanish tongue.
</p><p>"Ah, excuse me," he said, taking quick advantage of his guess, "but
from the way you pronounce that word '<u>zarape</u>' I take it that you
speak Spanish."
</p><p>"No one better," replied the host, smiling pleasurably at being taken
at his true worth, "since I was born in the city of Burgos, where they
speak the true Castilian. It is a different language, believe me,
from this bastard Mexican tongue. And do you speak Spanish also?" he
inquired, falling back into the staccato of Castile.
</p><p>"No, indeed!" protested De Lancey in a very creditable imitation;
"nothing but a little Mexican, to get along with the natives. My friend
and I are mining men, passing through the country, and we speak the
best we can. How is this district here for work along our line?"
</p><p>"None better!" cried the Spaniard, shaking his finger emphatically. "It
is of the best, and, believe me, my friend, we should be glad to have
you stop with us. The country down below is a little dangerous--not
now, perhaps, but later, when the warm weather comes on.
</p><p>"But in Fortuna--no! Here we are on the railroad; the camp is
controlled by Americans; and because so many have left the country the
Mexicans will sell their prospects cheap.
</p><p>"Then again, if you develop a mine near-by, it will be very easy to
sell it--and if you wish to work it, that is easy, too. I am only the
proprietor of the hotel, but if you can use my poor services in any way
I shall be very happy to please you. A room? One of the best! And if
you stay a week or more I will give you the lowest rate."
</p><p>They passed up the winding stairs and down a long corridor, at the end
of which the proprietor showed them into a room, throwing open the
outer doors and shutters to let them see the view from the window.
</p><p>"Here is a little balcony," he said, stepping outside, "where you can
sit and look down on the plaza. We have the band and music when the
weather is fine, and you can watch the pretty girls from here. But you
have been in Mexico--you know all that!" And he gave Phil a roguish dig.
</p><p>"<u>Bien</u> my frien', I am glad to meet you--" He held out his hand in
welcome and De Lancey gave his in return. "My name," he continued, "is
Juan de Dios Brachamonte y Escalon; but with these Americans that does
not go, as you say, so in general they call me Don Juan.
</p><p>"There is something about that name--I do not know--that makes the
college boys laugh. Perhaps it is that poet, Byron, who wrote so
scandalously about us Spaniards, but certainly he knew nothing of our
language, for he rimes Don Juan with 'new one' and 'true one'! Still,
I read part of that poem and it is, in places, very interesting--yes,
<u>very</u> interesting--but 'Don Joo-an'! Hah!"
</p><p>He threw up his hand in despair and De Lancey broke into a jollying
laugh.
</p><p>"Well, Don Juan," he cried, "I'm glad to meet you. My name is Philip De
Lancey, and my pardner here is Mr. Hooker. Shake hands with him, Don
Juan de Dios! But certainly a man so devoutly named could never descend
to reading <u>much</u> of Don Joo-an!"
</p><p>"Ah, no," protested Don Juan, rolling his dark eyes and smiling
rakishly, "not moch--only the most in-teresting passages!"
</p><p>He saluted and disappeared in a roar of laughter, and De Lancey turned
triumphantly on his companion, a self-satisfied smile upon his lips.
</p><p>"Aha!" he said; "you see? That's what five dollars' worth of booze will
do in opening up the way. Here's our old friend Don Juan willing, nay,
anxious, to help us all he can--he sees I'm a live wire and wants to
keep me around. Pretty soon we'll get him feeling good and he'll tell
us all he knows. Don't you never try to make me sign the pledge again,
brother--a few shots just gets my intellect to working right and I'm
crafty as a fox.
</p><p>"Did you notice that <u>coup</u> I made--asking him if he was a Spaniard?
There's nothing in the world makes a Spaniard so mad as to take him for
a Mexican--on the other hand, nothing makes him your friend for life
like recognizing him for a blue-blooded Castilian. Now maybe our old
friend Don Juan has got a few drops of Moorish blood in his veins--to
put it politely, but--" he raised his tenor voice and improvised--
</p><p>  "Jest because my hair is curly<br/>
  Dat's no reason to call me 'Shine'!"
</p><p>"No," agreed Bud, feeling cautiously of the walls, "and jest because
you're happy is no reason for singing so loud, neither. These here
partitions are made of inch boards, covered with paper--do you get
that? Well, then, considering who's probably listening, it strikes me
that Mr. Brachamonte is the real thing in Spanish gentlemen; and I've
heard that all genuwine Spaniards have their hair curly, jest like
a--huh?"
</p><p>But De Lancey, made suddenly aware of his indiscretion, was making all
kinds of exaggerated signs for silence, and Bud stopped with a slow,
good-natured smile.
</p><p>"S-s-st!" hissed De Lancey, touching his finger to his lips. "Don't say
it--somebody might hear you!"
</p><p>"All right," agreed Bud; "and don't you say it, either. I hate to
knock, Phil," he added, "but sometimes I think the old man was right
when he said you talk too much."
</p><p>"Psst!" chided De Lancey, shaking his finger like a Mexican. Tiptoeing
softly over to Bud, he whispered in his ear: "S-s-st, I can hear the
feller in the next room--shaving himself!"
</p><p>Laughing heartily at this joke, they went downstairs for supper.
