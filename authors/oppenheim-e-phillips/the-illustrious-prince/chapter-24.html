<P>
Inspector Jacks was in luck at last. Eleven times he had called
at St. Thomas's Hospital and received the same reply. Today he
was asked to wait. The patient was better--would be able to see
him. Soon a nurse in neat uniform came quietly down the corridor
and took charge of him.
<P>
"Ten minutes, no more," she insisted good-humoredly.
<P>
The Inspector nodded.
<P>
"One question, if you please, nurse," he asked. "Is the man going
to live?"
<P>
"Not a doubt about it," she declared. "Why?"
<P>
" A matter of depositions," the Inspector exclaimed. "I'd rather
let it go, though, if he's sure to recover."
<P>
"It's a simple case," she answered, "and his constitution is
excellent. There isn't the least need for your to think about
depositions. Here he is. Don't talk too long."
<P>
The Inspector sat down by the bedside. The patient, a young man,
welcomed him a little shyly.
<P>
"You have come to ask me about what I saw in Pall Mall and
opposite the Hyde Park Hotel?" he said, speaking slowly and in a
voice scarcely raised above a whisper. "I told them all before
the operation, but they couldn't send for you then. There wasn't
time."
<P>
The Inspector nodded.
<P>
"Tell me your own way," he said. "Don't hurry. We can get the
particulars later on. Glad you're going to be mended."
<P>
"It was touch and go," the young man declared with a note of awe
in his tone. "If the omnibus wheel had turned a foot more, I
should have lost both my legs. It was all through watching that
chap hop out of the taxicab, too."
<P>
The Inspector inclined his head gravely.
<P>
"You saw him get in, didn't you?" he asked.
<P>
"That's so," the patient admitted. "I was on my way--Charing
Cross to the Kensington Palace Hotel, on a bicycle. There was a
block--corner of Pall Mall and Haymarket. I caught hold--taxi in
front--to steady me."
<P>
The nurse bent over him with a glass in her hand. She raised him
a little with the other arm.
<P>
"Not too much of this, you know, young man," she said with a
pleasant smile. "Here's something to make you strong."
<P>
"Right you are!"
<P>
He drained the contents of the glass and smacked his lips.
<P>
"Jolly good stuff," he declared. "Where was I, Mr. Inspector?"
<P>
"Holding the back of a taxicab, corner of Regent Street and
Haymarket," Inspector Jacks reminded him.
<P>
The patient nodded.
<P>
"There was an electric brougham," he continued, drawn up
alongside the taxi. While we were there, waiting, I saw a chap
get out, speak to some one through the window of the taxi, open
the door, and step in. When we moved on, he stayed in the taxi.
Dark, slim chap he was," the patient continued, "a regular
howling swell,--silk hat, white muffler, white kid gloves,--all
the rest of it."
<P>
"And afterwards?" the Inspector asked.
<P>
"I kept behind the taxi," the youth continued. "We got blocked
again at Hyde Park Corner. I saw him step out of the taxi and
disappear amongst the vehicles. "A moment or two later, I passed
the taxi and looked in--saw something had happened--the fellow
was lying side-ways. It gave me a bit of a start. I skidded, and
over I went. Sort of had an idea that every one in the world had
started shouting to me, and felt that I was half underneath an
omnibus. Woke up to find myself here."
<P>
"Should you know the man again?" the Inspector asked. "I mean the
man whom you saw enter and leave the taxi?"
<P>
"I think so--pretty sure!"
<P>
The nurse came up, shaking her head. Inspector Jacks rose from
his seat.
<P>
"Right, nurse," he said. "I'm off. Take care of our young friend.
He is going to be very useful to us as soon as he can use his
feet and get about. I'll come and sit with you for half an hour
next visiting day, if I may?" he added, turning to the patient.
<P>
"Glad to see you," the youth answered. "My people live down in
the country, and I haven't many pals."
<P>
Inspector Jacks left the hospital thoughtfully. The smell of
anaesthetics somehow reminded him of the library in the house at
the corner of St. James' Square. It was not altogether by chance,
perhaps, that he found himself walking in that direction. He was
in Pall Mall, in fact, before he realized where he was, and at
the corner of St. James' Square and Pall Mall he came face to
face with Prince Maiyo, walking slowly westwards.
<P>
The meeting between the two men was a characteristic one. The
Inspector suffered no signs of surprise or even interest to creep
into his expressionless face. The Prince, on the other hand, did
not attempt to conceal his pleasure at this unexpected encounter.
His lips parted in a delightful smile. He ignored the Inspector's
somewhat stiff salute, and insisted upon shaking him cordially by
the hand.
<P>
"Mr. Inspector Jacks," he said, "you are the one person whom I
desired to see. You are not busy, I hope? You can talk with me
for five minutes?"
<P>
The Inspector hesitated for a moment. He was versed in every form
of duplicity, and yet he felt that in the presence of this young
aristocrat, who was smiling upon him so delightfully, he was
little more than a babe in wisdom, an amateur pure and simple. He
was conscious, too, of a sentiment which rarely intruded itself
into his affairs. He was conscious of a strong liking for this
debonair, pleasant-faced young man, who treated him not only as
an equal, but as an equal in whose society he found an especial
pleasure.
<P>
"I have the time to spare, sir, certainly," he admitted.
<P>
The Prince smiled gayly.
<P>
"Inspector Jacks," he said, "you are a wonderful man. Even now
you are asking yourself, What does he want to say to me--Prince
Maiyo? Is he going to ask me questions, or will he tell me things
which I should like to hear?' You know, Mr. Inspector Jacks,
between ourselves, you are just a little interested in me, is it
not so?"
<P>
The detective was dumb. He stood there patiently waiting. He had
the air of a man who declines to commit himself.
<P>
"Just a little interested in me, I think," the Prince murmured,
smiling at his companion. "Ah, well, many of the things I do over
here, perhaps, must seem very strange. And that reminds me. Only
a short time ago you were asking questions about the man who
travelled from Liverpool to London and reached his destination
with a dagger through his heart. Tell me, Mr. Inspector Jacks,
have you discovered the murderer yet?"
<P>
"Not yet," the detective answered.
<P>
"I have heard you speak of this affair," the Prince continued,
"and before now I expected to read in the papers that you had put
your hand upon the guilty one. If you have not done so, I am very
sure that there is some explanation."
<P>
"It is better sometimes to wait," the detective said quietly.
<P>
"The Prince bowed as one who understands.
<P>
"I think so," he assented, "I think I follow you. On the very
next day there was another tragedy which seemed to me even more
terrible. I mean the murder of that young fellow Vanderpole, of
the American Embassy. Mr. Inspector Jacks, has it ever occurred
to you, I wonder, that it might be as well to let the solution of
one await the solution of the other?"
<P>
Inspector Jacks shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"Occasionally," he admitted reluctantly, "when one is following
up a clue, one discovers things."
<P>
"You are wonderful!" the Prince declared. "You are, indeed! I
know what is in your mind. You have said to yourself, Between
these two murders there is some connection. They were both done
by the hand of a master criminal. The victims in both cases were
Americans.' You said to yourself, First of all, I will discover
the motive; then, perhaps, a clue which seems to belong to the
one will lead me to the other, or both?' You are not sure which
way to turn. There is nothing there upon which you can lay your
hand. You say to yourself, I will make a bluff.' That is the
word, is it not? You come to me. You tell me gravely that you
have reason to suspect some one in my household. That is because
you believe that the crimes were perpetrated by some one of my
country. You do not ask for information. You think, perhaps, that
I would not give it. You confront me with a statement. It was
very clever of you, Mr. Inspector Jacks."
<P>
"I had reason for what I did, sir," the detective said.
<P>
"No doubt," the Prince agreed. "And now, tell me, when are you
going to electrify us all? When is the great arrest to take
place?"
<P>
The detective coughed discreetly.
<P>
"I am not yet in a position, sir," he said, "to make any definite
announcement."
<P>
"Cautious, Mr. Jacks, cautious!" the Prince remarked smilingly.
"It is a great quality,--a quality which I, too, have learned how
to appreciate. And now for our five minutes' talk. If I say to
you,  Return home with me,' I think you will remember that
unpleasant room of mine, and you will recollect an important
engagement at Scotland Yard. In the clubs one is always
overheard. Walk with me a little way, Mr. Jacks, in St. James'
Park. We can speak there without fear of interruption. Come!"
<P>
He thrust his arm through the detective's and led him across the
street. Mr. Inspector Jacks was only human, and he yielded
without protest. They passed St. James' Palace and on to the
broad promenade, where there were few passers-by and no
listeners.
<P>
"You see, my dear Inspector," the Prince said, "I am really a
sojourner in your marvellous city not altogether for pleasure. My
stay over here is more in the light of a mission. I have certain
arrangements which I wish to effect for the good of my country.
Amongst them is one concerning which I should like to speak to
you."
<P>
"To me, sir?" Inspector Jacks repeated.
<P>
The Prince twirled his cane and nodded his head.
<P>
"It is a very important matter, Mr. Jacks," he said. "It is
nothing less than a desire on the part of the city government of
Tokio to perfect thoroughly their police system on the model of
yours over here. We are a progressive nation, you know, Mr.
Jacks, but we are also a young nation, and though I think that we
advance all the time, we are still in many respects a long way
behind you. We have no Scotland Yard in Tokio. To be frank with
you, the necessity for such an institution has become a real
thing with us only during the last few years. Do you read
history, Mr. Jacks?"
<P>
The Inspector was doubtful.
<P>
"I can't say, sir," he admitted, "that I have done much reading
since I left school, and that was many years ago."
<P>
"Well," the Prince said, "It is one of the axioms of history, Mr.
Jacks, that as a country becomes civilized and consequently more
prosperous, there is a corresponding growth in her criminal
classes, a corresponding need for a different state of laws by
which to judge them, a different machinery for checking their
growth. We have arrived at that position in Japan, and in my
latest despatches from home comes to me a request that I send
them out a man who shall reorganize our entire police system. I
am a judge of character, Mr. Jacks, and if I can get the man I
want, I do not need to ask my friends at Downing Street to help
me. I should like you to accept that post."
<P>
The Inspector was scarcely prepared for this. He allowed himself
to show some surprise.
<P>
"I am very much obliged to you, Prince, for the offer," he said.
"I am afraid, however, that I should not be competent."
<P>
"That," the Prince reminded him, "is a risk which we are willing
to take."
<P>
"I do not think, either," the detective continued, "that at my
time of life I should care to go so far from home to settle down
in an altogether strange country,."
<P>
"It must be as you will, of course," the Prince declared. "Only
remember, Mr. Jacks, that a great nation like mine which wants a
particular man for a particular purpose is not afraid to pay for
him. Your work out there would certainly take you no more than
three years. For that three years' work you would receive the sum
of thirty thousand pounds."
<P>
The detective gasped.
<P>
"It is a great sum," he said.
<P>
The Prince shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"You could hardly call it that," he said. "Still, it would enable
you to live in comfort for the rest of your life."
<P>
"And when should I be required to start, sir?" the Inspector
asked.
<P>
"That, perhaps," the Prince replied, "would seem the hardest part
of all. You would be required to start tomorrow afternoon from
Southampton at four o'clock."
<P>
The Inspector started. Then a new light dawned suddenly in his
face.
<P>
"Tomorrow afternoon," he murmured.
<P>
The Prince assented.
<P>
"So far as regards your position at Scotland Yard," he said, "I
have influential friends in your Government who will put that
right for you. You need not be afraid of any unpleasantness in
that direction. Remember, Mr. Inspector, thirty thousand pounds,
and a free hand while you are in my country. You are a man, I
should judge, of fifty-two or fifty-three years of age. You can
spend your fifty-sixth birthday in England, then, and be a man of
means for the remainder of your days."
<P>
"And this sum of money," the detective said, "is for my services
in building up the police force of Tokio?"
<P>
"Broadly speaking, yes!" the Prince answered.
<P>
"And incidentally," the detective continued, glancing cautiously
at his companion, "it is the price of my leaving unsuspected the
murderer of two innocent men!"
<P>
The Prince walked on in silence. Every line in his face seemed
slowly to have hardened. His brows had contracted. He was looking
steadfastly forward at the great front of Buckingham Palace.
<P>
"I am disappointed in you, Mr. Jacks," he said a little stiffly.
"I do not understand your allusion. The money I have mentioned is
to be paid to you for certain well-defined services. The other
matter you speak of does not interest me. It is no concern of
mine whether this man of whom you are in search is brought to
justice or not. All that I wish to hear from you is whether or
not you accept my offer."
<P>
The Inspector shook his head.
<P>
"Prince," he said, "there can be no question about that. I thank
you very much for it, but I must decline."
<P>
"Your mind is quite made up?" the Prince asked regretfully.
<P>
"Quite," the Inspector said firmly.
<P>
"Japan," the Prince said thoughtfully, "is a pleasant country."
<P>
"London suits me moderately well," Inspector Jacks declared.
<P>
"Under certain conditions," the Prince continued, "I should have
imagined that the climate here might prove most unhealthy for
you. You must remember that I was a witness of your slight
indisposition the other day."
<P>
"In my profession, sir," the detective said, "we must take our
risks."
<P>
The Prince came to a standstill. They were at the parting of the
ways.
<P>
"I am very sorry," he said simply. "It was a great post, and it
was one which you would have filled well. It is not for me,
however, to press the matter."
<P>
"It would make no difference, sir," the detective answered.
<P>
The Prince was on the point of moving away.
<P>
"I shall not seek in any case to persuade you," he said. "My
offer remains open if you should change your mind. Think, too,
over what I have said about our climate. At your time of life,
Mr. Inspector Jacks, and particularly at this season of the year,
one should be careful. A sea voyage now would, I am convinced, be
the very thing for you. Good day, Mr. Jacks!"
<P>
The Prince turned towards Buckingham Palace, and the Inspector
slowly retraced his steps.
<P>
"It is a bribe!" he muttered to himself slowly,--"a cleverly
offered bribe! Thirty thousand pounds to forget the little I have
learned! Thirty thousand pounds for silence!"
