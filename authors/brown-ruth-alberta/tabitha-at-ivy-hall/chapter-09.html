<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Miss Brooks was going away. This was her last week of school
and next September when the children gathered again in the familiar
old building, there would be a new teacher in her stead. The children
were disconsolate, for in the three years that she had instructed
them in the mysterious ways of knowledge, they had come to love
her very dearly and to consider her one of their possessions.
So it was a great shock to learn of her intentions, and particularly
was this true with Tabitha whose grief at the impending loss was
too deep for words. She could only stare and stare at the beloved
face as the days slipped by lessening the teacher's stay with
them, until Miss Brooks was so haunted by those pathetically appealing
black eyes that she could scarcely sleep and began to wonder why
it was that she should feel so much like a criminal every time
she looked at the child.</p>

<p>At last a happy thought occurred to her. She interviewed Mr.
Carson, Dr. Vane and other prominent men of the town, with the
result that the last Monday of the term she faced the scholars
with a happy smile on her lips and hope in her heart, as she announced,
"Children, I have some good news to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not going away after all!" breathed Tabitha ecstatically,
but the next instant her face fell, for the teacher gently shook
her head to signify that this guess was wrong.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that, for I really cannot come back here next fall,
children, or I would. But as long as I am going away, I thought
we would celebrate it by having a farewell picnic. In the city
where I live if any of our friends go away to live somewhere else,
we always give them a little party as a sort of good-by to them,
and we have a jolly time which they can remember always. Instead
of having a party here, I thought it would be nice if we could
go down to the river for a picnic, so I asked some of the gentlemen
here in town about it and they told me that we can get wagons
enough to take us all down there a week from tomorrow. It is such
a long, long way we couldn't walk. It is a pretty place, too,
and many of you haven't been there before. We will take our lunch
and stay all day, coming home before it gets dark. Some of the
parents are willing to accompany us, and we will have a fine time.
How many of you would like to go?"</p>

<p>Up went every hand in the room and the faces of the children
beamed in happy anticipation, for picnics were almost unknown
here on the barren desert, and any novelty was gladly welcomed.
So the scholars began happy plans for this unusual gala day, and
all that long week little else was thought of. This was just what
Miss Brooks had hoped for, because in their looking forward to
this extraordinary pleasure in their humdrum lives, they ceased
to harass their teacher with mournful laments and direful prophecies,
and even Tabitha's face lost some of its reproachful look.</p>

<p>The picnic day dawned at last, clear, cloudless and warm but
not too hot, for the desert summer was not fairly upon them yet;
and with lunch-baskets and buckets on their arms, and faces wreathed
with expectant smiles, the thirty children gathered around the
low schoolhouse impatiently waiting for the teams.</p>

<p>Both of Carrie's parents, Susie's mother, Dr. Vane and Herman's
aunt were to help Miss Brooks take care of her restless charges
and make the day a success; so no wonder everyone was happy in
their anticipation of a good time. Then, too, some of the miners
who had heard the great event talked up, got together in the dead
of night and decorated the several rigs with gay bunting, fastening
two small flags to the front of each wagon and even trimming up
the horses' harnesses until the results were quite dazzling to
childish eyes. What did it matter to them that some of the bunting
had been watersoaked and that the flags were faded almost white?
The effect was gay and festive and the whole town's population
turned out to see the procession start up the mountain road lustily
singing <em>My Country</em>, while they waved their handkerchiefs
and caps in the early morning sunshine in proud acknowledgment
of the cheers which greeted them on every side. Oh, it was a happy
day for Tabitha, and under cover of the music she confidingly
whispered to Carrie that this was the first picnic she had ever
been allowed to attend, which fact surprised that little miss
exceedingly.</p>

<p>It was a long drive to the river, up hill and down, over rocky
roads, through sandy soil, among the ugly Spanish bayonets and
cacti resplendent with scarlet blossoms, and over the desert,
now a mass of gorgeous colors, for the summer suns had not yet
burned out the little life which the winter rains had coaxed into
blooming. How beautiful the gold and crimson flowers looked dotted
over the hills and the flat like a brilliant carpet with its sage-green
background and occasional dash of deeper green where patches of
"filaree" covered the sandy soil!</p>

<p>How glorious it was to watch the gayly plumed birds as they swung
from bush to bush among the yuccas and greasewood, pouring out
their very souls in their joyous morning lay, seemingly with no
fear of the noisy, happy picnickers rumbling along the roadway!
Cottontails and jackrabbits darted across the path and into hiding,
an occasional harmless snake lifted its head to survey them and
then glided away among the rocks, and twice a startled covey of
quail rose from the underbrush and vanished in the blue mountain
air. Oh, it was grand! How could she ever have thought the desert
lonely and barren and hideous!</p>

<p>Then the river came into view and she held her breath in delight,
for the purple haze of the mountains beyond hung low in the valley,
and lent an indescribable charm to the whole surrounding country,
as if it were not a reality, but some great, grand picture hung
before them which they could gaze upon but never reach, for, as
they approached the enchanted spot, the beautiful mountains as
slowly receded, still clad in their purple veil and still mysteriously
alluring.</p>

<p>Under a clump of low, glistening cottonwoods among the tall,
rank swale-grass and rough-leaved yellow-weed, the picnic party
came to a halt and the merry children swarmed down over the wagon
wheels, eager to begin their day's frolic beside the sluggish
river.</p>

<p>"Now, if someone will just take care of the baby," suggested
Susie's mother as they unloaded the lunch baskets, "I'll help
the other ladies get dinner ready and you can have lunch just
that much sooner."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me, Mrs. McKittrick," cried Tabitha, who had wished
all the morning that she had been in the rig with the McKittrick
family so she might hold the little dimpled, laughing mite, who
made friends with everyone and was worshipped by all the children,
but remained unspoiled in spite of the attentions showered upon
him by this admiring court.</p>

<p>"Well, all right, Tabitha. Watch him and see that he doesn't
roll down the bank or put anything in his mouth. He's into everything."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't any yet. We can't find one pretty enough for him."</p>

<p>"And he is 'most a year old!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he will be a year next month, but he is the first boy in
a family of four girls, and we can't decide what to call him,
so he has no name yet. You might think up some pretty ones to
suggest. We've exhausted everyone else's lists."</p>

<p>She laughed as she spoke, but Tabitha thought she was thoroughly
in earnest, and seizing the baby, she ran away to ponder over
the vital question of pretty names, confident of finding one that
would suit the over-particular parents.</p>

<p>"I'd like to call him Dionysius if he was mine," she confided
to Carrie, who soon joined her in her self-appointed task of nursemaid,
for the two girls were seldom apart; "but&mdash;after&mdash;that time&mdash;well,
he might not like it when he grew up. I am afraid it might be
unlucky."</p>

<p>"Frederick is a pretty name," ventured Carrie. "That's papa's."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's not bad, but I reckon Mrs. McKittrick has heard
of it already, for I know lots of people called that. She wants
something real pretty. I know how it is, for my name is so perfectly
horrid that sometimes it seems as if I can't endure it. I wouldn't
want to pick out a name that this darling baby would hate when
he grew up. It must be something <em>awfully</em> nice. How do
you think she would like Rosslyn? I have liked that name ever
since I heard it and was always sorry I could not stay in Ferndale
and get acquainted with the boy it belonged to, and his cousin
Rosalie."</p>

<p>"If you had stayed there I never would have known you, Pussy,"
suggested Carrie, for Tabitha was her idol and she shuddered when
she thought how lonely it would be if Tabitha should move away
now and leave her there.</p>

<p>"That's so; I forgot it just for a minute. I'm sure Rosalie could
never have been any nicer than you are, and I don't believe Rosslyn
was nicer than Jerome, though Jerome does tease me dreadfully
sometimes. He doesn't mean to, and he always tells me he is sorry.
I like the name Jerome, but Mrs. McKittrick says she hates it,
so it would never do to suggest that."</p>

<p>"Don't they use last names sometimes for first names? Mrs. McKittrick
thinks Dr. Vane is splendid. I heard her tell mamma so. He saved
the baby when it was so terribly sick and the other doctor said
it could not get well."</p>

<p>"Maybe it would do for part of the name, though I wouldn't want
to call him Vane every day. That would sound as if he was a peacock.
See him pull that flower to pieces just as if he was trying to
study how it is put together. Maybe he will grow up to be a big
botany man. I would like to be one myself if I didn't intend to
keep house for Tom. Oh, the baby has started for the river!"</p>

<p>Both girls sprang up and gave chase and Carrie straightway forgot
all about the name problem, but Tabitha's busy brain puzzled over
it all that happy day, even while she romped and played with her
mates in lively games of "Farmer in the Dell," "Old Mother Witch,"
"Drop the Handkerchief," and all the other childhood favorites.
Once she almost forgot it. They were playing "Blind Man's Buff,"
when Jerome, who was "it," succeeded in catching her by her hair
after an animated scrimmage. Her braid promptly gave away her
identity, for no other girl in school possessed such long tresses;
and Jerome was elated at having so readily discovered who his
prisoner was, all the more so because this was the first time
Tabitha had been caught; so he teasingly cried, "Aha, this is
Miss Me-a-ow!"</p>

<p>How the children shouted, and for a moment Tabitha's face was
crimson with passion and she lifted a doubled-up fist threateningly;
but before the expected blow fell, Tabitha's lips curved suddenly
into a smile, her arm dropped to her side, and she gayly answered,
"Yes, Mr. Ki-yip-ki-yi-yi, put on my blinders."</p>

<p>Only Miss Brooks of the grown people had witnessed the child's
struggle, and as they were sitting down to the generous lunch
spread under the cottonwoods, she drew the flushed face down beside
her and said very softly, "That was well done, dear. I am proud
of you."</p>

<p>"You needn't be," was the candid reply. "I was all ready to scratch
for all I was worth when I saw the baby and I knew I wasn't a
fit person to name such a little darling if I couldn't stand a
little teasing. Jerome didn't mean anything by it and was sorry
as soon as he had said it. He came to me afterwards and told me
so, and then I was doubly glad I had kept still. But it was really
the baby who made me. I even forgot Mrs. Vane's rule of counting
ten."</p>

<p>"It will be easier to remember the next time," Miss Brooks told
her, feeling devoutly thankful that the day had not been marred
by a display of that fierce, uncontrollable temper, and in her
gratitude she heaped Tabitha's plate with sandwiches and all the
other good things.</p>

<p>"Now the baby must have his nap," said Mrs. McKittrick when the
last crumb of cake had disappeared and the last drop of lemonade
vanished. "I'm going to lay him under the wagons where it is coolest,
and you children play down there by that other clump of trees,
or else he won't sleep a wink."</p>

<p>"We're going to tell stories and listen to Mr. Carson's talking
machine for awhile," volunteered Susie, "so we won't make much
noise. Come on, ma, baby will be all right there."</p>

<p>The mother made the tiny boy comfortable in a shady nook and
then joined the group of children gathered under the cottonwoods
a little further down the river, laughing over the queer songs
the machine was grinding out; and in this exciting sport all thought
of the baby was swallowed up, except by Tabitha, who was still
busily engaged in fitting together all the possible and impossible
names she had ever heard, in the hope of finding some combination
which would suit the beautiful boy and please his adoring family.</p>

<p>"Rosslyn Lyle&mdash;no, that won't do; it is too hard to pronounce.
Rosslyn Leander&mdash;that is almost as bad. Rosslyn simply won't go
with any name beginning with 'L.' Rosslyn Thomas so he will be
named after Tom; but then probably Mrs. McKittrick doesn't like
Thomas for a name. Few people do, though I think it is rather
pretty when it belongs to someone else but a Catt. Rosslyn Brooks
after teacher. Why didn't I think of that before! Mrs. McKittrick
thinks Miss Brooks is the loveliest teacher she ever knew; I'm
sure she would like the Brooks part of it, and I don't see how
anyone can help liking the name of Rosslyn. It isn't as grand
sounding as Dionysius, but it is prettier for a baby. Two names
are so short, though; and anyway Carrie thinks Mrs. McKittrick
would like part of it to be Vane after the doctor. Mr. McKittrick
works in the Silver Legion Mines, so I suppose he wouldn't mind
if part of the name was Mr. Carson's. I don't like Frederick very
well, so it would have to be Carson. Well, Rosslyn Brooks Carson
Vane sounds quite pretty&mdash;very pretty &mdash;I like it ever so
much. I wonder what Mrs. McKittrick will think of it."</p>

<p>She looked around to see what had become of the mother, and beheld
a sight that froze the blood in her veins. Close beside the wagon
under which the sleeping baby lay was a huge snake coiled as if
ready to spring, and her heart stood still with terror as she
realized that one move of those little unconscious hands might
mean death for the precious darling. She tried to scream, but
her voice stuck in her throat. She looked wildly about her for
help, but the children were wandering on the river bank gathering
flowers and Mr. Carson was busy with the talking machine which
was evidently out of order. Dr. Vane was nowhere in sight nor
were any of the women within call.</p>

<p>She must rescue the baby herself. She had often seen Tom kill
snakes since they had come to live on the desert, and once he
had dispatched a large rattler not far from their cottage, though
poisonous reptiles were not often found so close to town. Oh,
if Tom were only there!</p>

<p>Then her glance fell upon a smooth rock at her feet. She was
a good shot, but could she risk it with that little life hanging
in the balance? There was another stone, and another. She clutched
them with trembling hands, crept cautiously forward and, taking
careful aim, hurled the rock at the head of the coiled serpent.
She missed, the snake coiled, more tightly, sounded its warning
and sprung straight towards her. This was what she had hoped for;
and leaping nimbly aside, before he could coil for another spring,
she struck him squarely on the head, following that blow up with
a perfect rain of rocks, carefully keeping out of range lest he
should coil again, and hurling each missile with all her fierce
strength, losing her fear of her opponent as her anger grew.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot rang sharply through the air, there was a sound
of excited voices, the children came running toward her with the
baby's white-faced mother in advance; and Tabitha, dropping weakly
to the ground, burst into wild, hysterical sobs. With his smoking
pistol still covering the shattered reptile, Dr. Vane, almost
as white as the frantic mother, gathered the trembling girl in
his arms and tried to soothe her fright, saying, "There, there,
my little Puss; it is all over! The snake is dead and the baby
isn't harmed at all. Don't cry like that! You did a very brave
thing. Look up and see the old fellow."</p>

<p>Mr. Carson and the boys had clustered around the snake, examining
it curiously, and now the man lifted his head and looked down
at the doctor, still bending over the girl.</p>

<p>"I believe she had killed it, Vane, without your bullet. What
splendid nerve! The fellow's got eight rattles. Do you want them
for a souvenir, Tabitha?" But she shook her head and clung to
the doctor, quivering with nervous dread.</p>

<p>After a long time the children were quieted, and as the day drew
to a close, they clambered back into the wagons, and set out on
their homeward drive, rather subdued, but happy that everyone
was safe, and proud of their mate whose prompt action had perhaps
saved a life so dear to them all. Tabitha was a heroine! Poor
Tabitha, such an unexpected honor was almost as hard to bear as
the teasing she so bitterly resented, and she hid her head in
embarrassment and confusion, refusing at first to look up or say
a word, except to the baby, who cooed and crowed in delight in
her arms.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said the mother, whose face was still white and
drawn from her fright, "I am going to let you name the baby. It
is a very little thing to do for a girl who has saved his life,
but I'm not rich and can't pay a big reward like rich folks do."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. McKittrick, can I really name him? I don't want any
reward for trying to save him. Even if you had lots of money I
wouldn't take it. He is worth more than money and the happiest
thing you could do for me is to let me name him. I've got a splendid
one already picked out for him. I was just going to ask you what
you thought of it when I saw the snake. It is Rosslyn Brooks Carson
Vane. Isn't that splendid?"</p>

<p>So the McKittrick baby was named at last.</p>
