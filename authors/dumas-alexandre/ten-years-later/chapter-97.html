<P>Fouquet was present, as D'Artagnan had said, at the king's
card-table. It seemed as if Buckingham's departure had shed
a balm on the lacerated hearts of the previous evening.
Monsieur, radiant with delight, made a thousand affectionate
signs to his mother. The Count de Guiche could not separate
himself from Buckingham and while playing, conversed with
him upon the circumstance of his projected voyage.
Buckingham, thoughtful, and kind in his manner, like a man
who has adopted a resolution, listened to the count, and
from time to time cast a look full of regret and hopeless
affection at Madame. The princess, in the midst of her
elation of spirits, divided her attention between the king,
who was playing with her, Monsieur, who quietly joked her
about her enormous winnings, and De Guiche, who exhibited an
extravagant delight. Of Buckingham she took but little
notice; for her, this fugitive, this exile, was now simply a
remembrance, no longer a man. Light hearts are thus
constituted; while they themselves continue untouched, they
roughly break off with every one who may possibly interfere
with their little calculations of selfish comfort. Madame
had received Buckingham's smiles and attentions and sighs
while he was present; but what was the good of sighing,
smiling and kneeling at a distance? Can one tell in what
direction the winds in the Channel, which toss mighty
vessels to and fro, carry such sighs as these. The duke
could not fail to mark this change, and his heart was
cruelly hurt. Of a sensitive character, proud and
susceptible of deep attachment, he cursed the day on which
such a passion had entered his heart. The looks he cast,
from time to time at Madame, became colder by degrees at the
chilling complexion of his thoughts. He could hardly yet
despair, but he was strong enough to impose silence upon the
tumultuous outcries of his heart. In exact proportion,
however, as Madame suspected this change of feeling, she
redoubled her activity to regain the ray of light she was
about to lose; her timid and indecisive mind was displayed
in brilliant flashes of wit and humor. At any cost she felt
that she must be remarked above everything and every one,
even above the king himself. And she was so, for the queens,
notwithstanding their dignity, and the king, despite the
respect which etiquette required, were all eclipsed by her.
The queens, stately and ceremonious, were softened and could
not restrain their laughter. Madame Henrietta, the
queen-mother, was dazzled by the brilliancy which cast
distinction upon her family, thanks to the wit of the
grand-daughter of Henry IV. The king, jealous, as a young
man and as a monarch, of the superiority of those who
surrounded him, could not resist admitting himself
vanquished by a petulance so thoroughly French in its
nature, whose energy was more than ever increased by English
humor. Like a child, he was captivated by her radiant
beauty, which her wit made still more dazzling. Madame's
eyes flashed like lightning. Wit and humor escaped from her
scarlet lips, like persuasion from the lips of Nestor of
old. The whole court, subdued by her enchanting grace,
noticed for the first time that laughter could be indulged
in before the greatest monarch in the world, like people who
merited their appellation of the wittiest and most polished
people in Europe.</P>
<P>Madame, from that evening, achieved and enjoyed a success
capable of bewildering all not born to those altitudes
termed thrones; which, in spite of their elevation, are
sheltered from such giddiness. From that very moment Louis
XIV. acknowledged Madame as a person to be recognized.
Buckingham regarded her as a coquette deserving the cruelest
tortures, and De Guiche looked upon her as a divinity; the
courtiers as a star whose light might some day become the
focus of all favor and power. And yet Louis XIV., a few
years previously, had not even condescended to offer his
hand to that &quot;ugly girl&quot; for a ballet; and Buckingham had
worshipped this coquette &quot;on both knees.&quot; De Guiche had once
looked upon this divinity as a mere woman; and the courtiers
had not dared to extol this star in her upward progress,
fearful to disgust the monarch whom such a dull star had
formerly displeased.</P>
<P>Let us see what was taking place during this memorable
evening at the king's card-table. The young queen, although
Spanish by birth, and the niece of Anne of Austria, loved
the king, and could not conceal her affection. Anne of
Austria, a keen observer, like all women, and imperious,
like every queen, was sensible of Madame's power, and
acquiesced in it immediately, a circumstance which induced
the young queen to raise the siege and retire to her
apartments. The king hardly paid any attention to her
departure, notwithstanding the pretended symptoms of
indisposition by which it was accompanied. Encouraged by the
rules of etiquette, which he had begun to introduce at the
court as an element of every relation of life, Louis XIV.
did not disturb himself; he offered his hand to Madame
without looking at Monsieur his brother, and led the young
princess to the door of her apartments. It was remarked that
at the threshold of the door, his majesty, freed from every
restraint, or not equal to the situation, sighed very
deeply. The ladies present  -  for nothing escapes a woman's
glance  -  Mademoiselle Montalais, for instance  -  did not
fail to say to each other, &quot;the king sighed,&quot; and &quot;Madame
sighed too.&quot; This had been indeed the case. Madame had
sighed very noiselessly, but with an accompaniment very far
more dangerous for the king's repose. Madame had sighed,
first closing her beautiful black eyes, next opening them,
and then, laden, as they were, with an indescribable
mournfulness of expression, she had raised them towards the
king, whose face at that moment visibly heightened in color.
The consequence of these blushes, of these interchanged
sighs, and of this royal agitation, was, that Montalais had
committed an indiscretion which had certainly affected her
companion, for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, less clear
sighted, perhaps, turned pale when the king blushed; and her
attendance being required upon Madame, she tremblingly
followed the princess without thinking of taking the gloves,
which court etiquette required her to do. True it is that
this young country girl might allege as her excuse the
agitation into which the king seemed to be thrown, for
Mademoiselle de la Valliere, busily engaged in closing the
door, had involuntarily fixed her eyes upon the king, who,
as he retired backwards, had his face towards it. The king
returned to the room where the card-tables were set out. He
wished to speak to the different persons there, but it was
easy to see that his mind was absent. He jumbled different
accounts together, which was taken advantage of by some of
the noblemen who had retained those habits since the time of
Monsieur Mazarin  -  who had a poor memory, but was a good
calculator. In this way Monsieur Manicamp, with a
thoughtless and absent air  -  for M. Manicamp was the
honestest man in the world appropriated twenty thousand
francs, which were littering the table, and which did not
seem to belong to any person in particular. In the same way,
Monsieur de Wardes, whose head was doubtless a little
bewildered by the occurrences of the evening, somehow forgot
to leave behind him the sixty double louis which he had won
for the Duke of Buckingham, and which the duke, incapable,
like his father, of soiling his hands with coin of any sort,
had left lying on the table before him. The king only
recovered his attention in some degree at the moment that
Monsieur Colbert, who had been narrowly observant for some
minutes, approached, and, doubtless, with great respect, yet
with much perseverance, whispered a counsel of some sort
into the still tingling ears of the king. The king, at the
suggestion, listened with renewed attention and immediately
looking around him, said, &quot;Is Monsieur Fouquet no longer
here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sire, I am here,&quot; replied the superintendent, till
then engaged with Buckingham, and approached the king, who
advanced a step towards him with a smiling yet negligent
air. &quot;Forgive me,&quot; said Louis, &quot;if I interrupt your
conversation; but I claim your attention wherever I may
require your services.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am always at the king's service,&quot; replied Fouquet.</P>
<P>&quot;And your cash-box too,&quot; said the king, laughing with a
false smile.</P>
<P>&quot;My cash-box more than anything else,&quot; said Fouquet, coldly.</P>
<P>&quot;The fact is, I wish to give a fete at Fontainebleau  -  to
keep open house for fifteen days, and I shall require  -  -  &quot;
and he stopped glancing at Colbert. Fouquet waited without
showing discomposure; and the king resumed, answering
Colbert's icy smile, &quot;four million francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Four million,&quot; repeated Fouquet, bowing profoundly. And his
nails, buried in his bosom, were thrust into his flesh, but
the tranquil expression of his face remained unaltered.
&quot;When will they be required, sire?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take your time,  -  I mean  -  no, no, as soon as possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A certain time will be necessary, sire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Time!&quot; exclaimed Colbert, triumphantly.</P>
<P>&quot;The time, monsieur,&quot; said the superintendent, with the
haughtiest disdain, &quot;simply to count the money: a million
can only be drawn and weighed in a day.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Four days then,&quot; said Colbert.</P>
<P>&quot;My clerks,&quot; replied Fouquet, addressing himself to the
king, &quot;will perform wonders on his majesty's service, and
the sum shall be ready in three days.&quot;</P>
<P>It was for Colbert now to turn pale. Louis looked at him
astonished. Fouquet withdrew without any parade or weakness,
smiling at his numerous friends, in whose countenances alone
he read the sincerity of their friendship  -  an interest
partaking of compassion. Fouquet, however, should not be
judged by his smile, for, in reality he felt as if he had
been stricken by death. Drops of blood beneath his coat
stained the fine linen that clothed his chest. His dress
concealed the blood, and his smile the rage which devoured
him. His domestics perceived, by the manner in which he
approached his carriage, that their master was not in the
best of humors: the result of their discernment was, that
his orders were executed with that exactitude of maneuver
which is found on board a man-of-war, commanded during a
storm by an ill-tempered captain. The carriage, therefore,
did not simply roll along  -  it flew. Fouquet had hardly
time to recover himself during the drive; on his arrival he
went at once to Aramis, who had not yet retired for the
night. As for Porthos, he had supped very agreeably off a
roast leg of mutton, two pheasants, and a perfect heap of
cray-fish; he then directed his body to be anointed with
perfumed oils, in the manner of the wrestlers of old; and
when this anointment was completed, he had himself wrapped
in flannels and placed in a warm bed. Aramis, as we have
already said, had not retired. Seated at his ease in a
velvet dressing-gown, he wrote letter after letter in that
fine and hurried handwriting, a page of which contained a
quarter of a volume. The door was thrown hurriedly open, and
the superintendent appeared, pale, agitated, anxious. Aramis
looked up: &quot;Good-evening,&quot; said he, and his searching look
detected his host's sadness and disordered state of mind.
&quot;Was your play as good as his majesty's?&quot; asked Aramis, by
way of beginning the conversation.</P>
<P>Fouquet threw himself upon a couch, and then pointed to the
door to the servant who had followed him; when the servant
had left he said, &quot;Excellent.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis, who had followed every movement with his eyes,
noticed that he stretched himself upon the cushions with a
sort of feverish impatience. &quot;You have lost as usual?&quot;
inquired Aramis, his pen still in his hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Even more than usual,&quot; replied Fouquet.</P>
<P>&quot;You know how to support losses?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sometimes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What, Monsieur Fouquet a bad player!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is play and play, Monsieur d'Herblay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How much have you lost?&quot; inquired Aramis, with a slight
uneasiness.</P>
<P>Fouquet collected himself a moment, and then, without the
slightest emotion, said, &quot;The evening has cost me four
millions,&quot; and a bitter laugh drowned the last vibration of
these words.</P>
<P>Aramis, who did not expect such an amount, dropped his pen.
&quot;Four millions,&quot; he said; &quot;you have lost four millions,  - 
impossible!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Colbert held my cards for me,&quot; replied the
superintendent, with a similar bitter laugh.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, now I understand; so, so, a new application for funds?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and from the king's own lips. It was impossible to
ruin a man with a more charming smile. What do you think of
it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is clear that your destruction is the object in view.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is your opinion?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Still. Besides, there is nothing in it which should
astonish you, for we have foreseen it all along&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes; but I did not expect four millions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No doubt the amount is serious, but, after all, four
millions are not quite the death of a man, especially when
the man in question is Monsieur Fouquet.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear D'Herblay, if you knew the contents of my coffers,
you would be less easy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you promised?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What could I do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's true.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The very day I refuse, Colbert will procure the money;
whence I know not, but he will procure it: and I shall be
lost.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no doubt of that. In how many days did you promise
these four millions?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In three days. The king seemed exceedingly pressed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;In three days?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When I think,&quot; resumed Fouquet, &quot;that just now as I passed
along the streets, the people cried out, `There is the rich
Monsieur Fouquet,' it is enough to turn my brain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stay, monsieur, the matter is not worth so much trouble,&quot;
said Aramis, calmly, sprinkling some sand over the letter he
had just written.</P>
<P>&quot;Suggest a remedy, then, for this evil without a remedy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is only one remedy for you,  -  pay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But it is very uncertain whether I have the money.
Everything must be exhausted; Belle-Isle is paid for; the
pension has been paid; and money, since the investigation of
the accounts of those who farm the revenue, is scarce.
Besides, admitting that I pay this time, how can I do so on
another occasion? When kings have tasted money, they are
like tigers who have tasted flesh, they devour everything.
The day will arrive  -  must arrive  -  when I shall have to
say, `Impossible, sire,' and on that very day I am a lost
man.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis raised his shoulders slightly, saying:</P>
<P>&quot;A man in your position, my lord, is only lost when he
wishes to be so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A man, whatever his position may be, cannot hope to
struggle against a king.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nonsense; when I was young I wrestled successfully with the
Cardinal Richelieu, who was king of France,  -  nay more  - 
cardinal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures? I have not
even Belle-Isle.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Bah! necessity is the mother of invention, and when you
think all is lost, something will be discovered which will
retrieve everything.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who will discover this wonderful something?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I! I resign my office of inventor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then I will.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be it so. But set to work without delay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! we have time enough!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You kill me, D'Herblay, with your calmness,&quot; said the
superintendent, passing his handkerchief over his face.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you not remember that I one day told you not to make
yourself uneasy, if you possessed courage? Have you any?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Then don't make yourself uneasy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is decided, then, that, at the last moment, you will
come to my assistance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It will only be the repayment of a debt I owe you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is the vocation of financiers to anticipate the wants of
men such as yourself, D'Herblay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If obligingness is the vocation of financiers, charity is
the virtue of the clergy. Only, on this occasion, do you
act, monsieur. You are not yet sufficiently reduced, and at
the last moment we will see what is to be done.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We shall see, then, in a very short time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very well. However, permit me to tell you that, personally,
I regret exceedingly that you are at present so short of
money, because I was myself about to ask you for some.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For yourself?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For myself, or some of my people, for mine or for ours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How much do you want?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be easy on that score; a roundish sum, it is true, but not
too exorbitant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me the amount.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fifty thousand francs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! a mere nothing. Of course one has always fifty thousand
francs. Why the deuce cannot that knave Colbert be as easily
satisfied as you are  -  and I should give myself far less
trouble than I do. When do you need this sum?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow morning; but you wish to know its destination.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nay, nay, chevalier, I need no explanation.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow is the first of June.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One of our bonds becomes due.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I did not know we had any bond.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, to-morrow we pay our last third instalment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What third?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of the one hundred and fifty thousand francs to
Baisemeaux.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Baisemeaux? Who is he?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The governor of the Bastile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I remember. On what grounds am I to pay one hundred
and fifty thousand francs for that man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On account of the appointment which he, or rather we,
purchased from Louviere and Tremblay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have a very vague recollection of the matter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is likely enough, for you have so many affairs to
attend to. However, I do not believe you have any affair in
the world of greater importance than this one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me, then, why we purchased this appointment.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, in order to render him a service in the first place,
and afterwards ourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ourselves? You are joking.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monseigneur, the time may come when the governor of the
Bastile may prove a very excellent acquaintance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have not the good fortune to understand you, D'Herblay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monseigneur, we had our own poets, our own engineer, our
own architect, our own musicians, our own printer, and our
own painters; we needed our own governor of the Bastile.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us not deceive ourselves, monseigneur; we are very much
opposed to paying the Bastile a visit,&quot; added the prelate,
displaying, beneath his pale lips, teeth which were still
the same beautiful teeth so much admired thirty years
previously by Marie Michon.</P>
<P>&quot;And you think it is not too much to pay one hundred and
fifty thousand francs for that? I thought you generally put
out money at better interest than that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The day will come when you will admit your mistake.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My dear D'Herblay, the very day on which a man enters the
Bastile, he is no longer protected by his past.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, he is, if the bonds are perfectly regular; besides,
that good fellow Baisemeaux has not a courtier's heart. I am
certain, my lord, that he will not remain ungrateful for
that money, without taking into account, I repeat, that I
retain the acknowledgments.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is a strange affair! usury in a matter of benevolence.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do not mix yourself up with it, monseigneur; if there be
usury, it is I who practice it, and both of us reap the
advantage from it  -  that is all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Some intrigue, D'Herblay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I do not deny it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And Baisemeaux an accomplice in it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?  -  there are worse accomplices than he. May I
depend, then, upon the five thousand pistoles to-morrow?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you want them this evening?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It would be better, for I wish to start early; poor
Baisemeaux will not be able to imagine what has become of
me, and must be upon thorns.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You shall have the amount in an hour. Ah, D'Herblay, the
interest of your one hundred and fifty thousand francs will
never pay my four millions for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not, monseigneur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good-night, I have business to transact with my clerks
before I retire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A good night's rest, monseigneur.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;D'Herblay, you wish things that are impossible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Shall I have my fifty thousand francs this evening?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go to sleep, then, in perfect safety  -  it is I who tell
you to do so.&quot;</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this assurance, and the tone in which it was
given, Fouquet left the room shaking his head, and heaving a
sigh.</P></div>
