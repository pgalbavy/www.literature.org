<p>The instant the light was detected, the attention of all the
fugitives became centered upon it, for it was plain they were
journeying in a direct line toward it, and unless a speedy turn
to the right or left was made, the camp fire, as it appeared to
be, would soon be reached. Viewed as they neared it, it seemed
to be simply a fire, and nothing more, there being so many intervening
trees and undergrowth, that nothing except the light itself was
noticeable. But, as a rule, wherever there was a camp fire there
were those who kindled it, and it struck Rosa that the Mohawk
was reckless in advancing upon it; but she held her peace, certain
he would commit no blunder.</p>

<p>The little party continued advancing steadily until within less
than a hundred yards, when, as if by a common instinct, they halted,
with their eyes bent inquiringly upon the fire. It was more plainly
visible than before, and was seen to be burning brightly, showing
that if no persons were near it, they had been absent but a short
time.</p>

<p>"Stay here &mdash;I go look&mdash;make no noise."</p>

<p>With these words, Lena-Wingo moved toward the blaze, and his
tall, dark figure was seen more than once as in its stealthy advance
it came between them and the flames. But, as it neared them, he
made a turn which shut him from sight until a short distance away
on his return. The Mohawk had been absent but a brief time, and
when he rejoined them he said:</p>

<p>"Come 'long&mdash;walk fast&mdash;talk if want to."</p>

<p>This seemed curious advice, but it was accepted, and the fugitives
kept up a constant talk in low tones, until they had halted before
the fire itself. The expectation of Ned and Rosa was to meet some
one, most probably a party of the settlers, who were taking refuge
in the woods until the Indians and Tories should leave the valley;
but in this they were disappointed. Halting directly before the
blaze, they looked around, but saw no one besides themselves.</p>

<p>"Rosa," said Jo, with a meaning grin, "do you feel as though
you can do justice to a lunch?"</p>

<p>Then the truth flashed upon her. Lena-Wingo had brought them
thither for the purpose of furnishing them with supper. A protest
rose to her lips, but she checked it, feeling that she had perhaps
said too much already. Certainly if any one in the world ought
to have faith in the skill and devotion of the Mohawk scout, she
was that one, and she resolved at the instant she drove back the
complaining words that they should remain unsaid, not for then
only, but for all time.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, Jo; I <em>am</em> hungry, and if you have anything
in the way of supper, I am sure it will be welcomed by all."</p>

<p>"How is it, Ned? Do you feel any hankering for eatables?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have that yearning satisfied; when Jack and
I went off, it was in search of food, for we need it, every one
of us. Rosa seems to think we are loitering away our time, but
Jack knows what he is doing. It is an easy matter to get across
the river, but when on the other side our real trouble will begin.
Colonel Butler expects us to cross the stream, and he won't make
much effort to prevent us, but what he means to do is to keep
us from reaching Wilkesbarre, and we aren't going to get there
in a hurry, either. Well, don't you see that we are likely to
be in the woods a good while, and we may have to take a long circuitous
route to get out? I shouldn't be surprised if we were two or three
days longer on the way, for when Jack undertakes a job of this
sort, he does it thoroughly, and he isn't the one to spoil it
by hurry, no matter what his companions want him to do. All this
being so, it isn't necessary to tell you that we must have our
meals as regular as we can get them. If we eat a good supper now,
we shall be able to pass to-morrow without any food, but it will
go hard without anything in that line."</p>

<p>"If you will bring out your supper, Jo, and stop your chatter,
I will agree to do the same, but I shan't believe you have anything
in the way of food till I see it."</p>

<p>The brother kept up a stream of talk, in the way of badinage,
asking his friends to name whatever article of diet they wished,
as he could furnish one almost as well as another. Finally, when
the thing had continued long enough, he produced the supper, and
it was a surprise to Ned and Rosa indeed. While Lena-Wingo was
engaged in stirring and throwing more wood on the fire, Jo removed
some fresh green leaves from a package that had been lying unnoticed
near at hand, and within was found a large piece of roast pig!
Furthermore, it was young, tender, well cooked, juicy and clean.</p>

<p>The appetites of all were keen, and as they took seats on the
ground and ate as well as they could, with the help of the keen
hunting knives of the party, it would have been impossible to
enjoy it more. Nobody but the Mohawk knew how long it was since
he had partaken of food, but had the period been a week, he could
not have shown a keener relish for the nourishing meat. While
employed in this pleasant manner, it was explained how it came
about that they were furnished with this supper. As Jo had already
told his sister, he and the Mohawk started off in quest of food,
when they affected such a mystery in their movements.</p>

<p>It was no time nor neighborhood in which to look for game, and
their purpose was to hunt some farm-house, where they hoped to
find enough of the stock left to furnish them with one meal at
least. While on their way through the woods, they came in sight
of this same camp fire, which they approached and reconnoitered.
The first figure they recognized was that of Colonel Butler, and
next to him was Captain Bagley, his well-chosen assistant, besides
which there were four Iroquois Indians, whose principal business
seemed to be that of roasting a plump pig, which they had stolen
from some settler in the valley.</p>

<p>Colonel Butler was very loquacious, and talked so freely with
the captain that his purpose of crossing the river speedily became
known to the listening scouts. Some of his references to Rosa
Minturn were such that Jo would have shot him as he sat eating
by his own camp fire, had not the Mohawk interfered and quieted
him with the philosophical observation:</p>

<p>"Hain't got gal yet&mdash;won't get her&mdash;talk won't hurt her."</p>

<p>Although it was certain that the party meant to cross the Susquehanna
that night, probably as soon as the supper was finished, yet it
did not occur to the Mohawk that they intended to use the canoe
which was awaiting the whites. When the Tories and Iroquois completed
their meal, they started for the stream, and Lena-Wingo and Jo
followed, keeping them under scrutiny until they left the shore
for the other side. The party went off leaving their camp fire
burning brightly, and as there was no reason to believe that any
of their allies were near little was feared in returning to the
scene and appropriating what was left as fragments of their feast.</p>

<p>The friends, therefore, ate with that enjoyment which comes of
a sharp appetite, good food, and the consciousness that they need
be in no hurry to finish. It was the purpose of the Mohawk to
place his companions on the other side of the stream before daylight,
but he convinced them that there was nothing to be gained by hurrying
in the business.</p>

<p>As the weak force at the station of Wilkesbarre would be on guard
against the approach of all enemies, especially during the darkness
of the night, it would be a matter of difficulty, as well as one
of extreme danger, to secure admission at that time. For this
reason he preferred to do that part of his work in the daytime,
when he could have an opportunity to use all his senses, and not
be taken at a disadvantage.</p>
