1. GOD IS COURAGE
<P>
Now having set down what those who profess the new religion regard 
as the chief misconceptions of God, having put these systems of 
ideas aside from our explanations, the path is cleared for the 
statement of what God is.  Since language springs entirely from 
material, spatial things, there is always an element of metaphor in 
theological statement.  So that I have not called this chapter the 
Nature of God, but the Likeness of God.
<P>
And firstly, GOD IS COURAGE.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. GOD IS A PERSON
<P>
<P>
And next GOD IS A PERSON.
<P>
Upon this point those who are beginning to profess modern religion 
are very insistent.  It is, they declare, the central article, the 
axis, of their religion.  God is a person who can be known as one 
knows a friend, who can be served and who receives service, who 
partakes of our nature; who is, like us, a being in conflict with 
the unknown and the limitless and the forces of death; who values 
much that we value and is against much that we are pitted against.  
He is our king to whom we must be loyal; he is our captain, and to 
know him is to have a direction in our lives.  He feels us and knows 
us; he is helped and gladdened by us.  He hopes and attempts. . . .  
God is no abstraction nor trick of words, no Infinite.  He is as 
real as a bayonet thrust or an embrace.
<P>
Now this is where those who have left the old creeds and come asking 
about the new realisations find their chief difficulty.  They say, 
Show us this person; let us hear him.  (If they listen to the 
silences within, presently they will hear him.)  But when one 
argues, one finds oneself suddenly in the net of those ancient 
controversies between species and individual, between the one and 
the many, which arise out of the necessarily imperfect methods of 
the human mind.  Upon these matters there has been much pregnant 
writing during the last half century.  Such ideas as this writer has 
to offer are to be found in a previous little book of his, "First 
and Last Things," in which, writing as one without authority or 
specialisation in logic and philosophy, as an ordinary man vividly 
interested, for others in a like case, he was at some pains to 
elucidate the imperfections of this instrument of ours, this mind, 
by which we must seek and explain and reach up to God.  Suffice it 
here to say that theological discussion may very easily become like 
the vision of a man with cataract, a mere projection of inherent 
imperfections.  If we do not use our phraseology with a certain 
courage, and take that of those who are trying to convey their ideas 
to us with a certain politeness and charity, there is no end 
possible to any discussion in so subtle and intimate a matter as 
theology but assertions, denials, and wranglings.  And about this 
word "person" it is necessary to be as clear and explicit as 
possible, though perfect clearness, a definition of mathematical 
sharpness, is by the very nature of the case impossible.
<P>
Now when we speak of a person or an individual we think typically of 
a man, and we forget that he was once an embryo and will presently 
decay; we forget that he came of two people and may beget many, that 
he has forgotten much and will forget more, that he can be confused, 
divided against himself, delirious, drunken, drugged, or asleep.  On 
the contrary we are, in our hasty way of thinking of him, apt to 
suppose him continuous, definite, acting consistently and never 
forgetting.  But only abstract and theoretical persons are like 
that.  We couple with him the idea of a body.  Indeed, in the common 
use of the word "person" there is more thought of body than of mind.  
We speak of a lover possessing the person of his mistress.  We speak 
of offences against the person as opposed to insults, libels, or 
offences against property.  And the gods of primitive men and the 
earlier civilisations were quite of that quality of person.  They 
were thought of as living in very splendid bodies and as acting 
consistently.  If they were invisible in the ordinary world it was 
because they were aloof or because their "persons" were too splendid 
for weak human eyes.  Moses was permitted a mitigated view of the 
person of the Hebrew God on Mount Horeb; and Semele, who insisted 
upon seeing Zeus in the glories that were sacred to Juno, was 
utterly consumed.  The early Islamic conception of God, like the 
conception of most honest, simple Christians to-day, was clearly, in 
spite of the theologians, of a very exalted anthropomorphic 
personality away somewhere in Heaven.  The personal appearance of 
the Christian God is described in The Revelation, and however much 
that description may be explained away by commentators as 
symbolical, it is certainly taken by most straightforward believers 
as a statement of concrete reality.  Now if we are going to insist 
upon this primary meaning of person and individual, then certainly 
God as he is now conceived is not a person and not an individual.  
The true God will never promenade an Eden or a Heaven, nor sit upon 
a throne.
<P>
But current Christianity, modern developments of Islam, much Indian 
theological thought--that, for instance, which has found such 
delicate and attractive expression in the devotional poetry of 
Rabindranath Tagore--has long since abandoned this anthropomorphic 
insistence upon a body.  From the earliest ages man's mind has found 
little or no difficulty in the idea of something essential to the 
personality, a soul or a spirit or both, existing apart from the 
body and continuing after the destruction of the body, and being 
still a person and an individual.  From this it is a small step to 
the thought of a person existing independently of any existing or 
pre-existing body.  That is the idea of theological Christianity, as 
distinguished from the Christianity of simple faith.  The Triune 
Persons--omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent--exist for all 
time, superior to and independent of matter.  They are supremely 
disembodied.  One became incarnate--as a wind eddy might take up a 
whirl of dust. . . .  Those who profess modern religion conceive 
that this is an excessive abstraction of the idea of spirituality, a 
disembodiment of the idea of personality beyond the limits of the 
conceivable; nevertheless they accept the conception that a person, 
a spiritual individual, may be without an ordinary mortal body. . . .  
They declare that God is without any specific body, that he is 
immaterial, that he can affect the material universe--and that means 
that he can only reach our sight, our hearing, our touch--through 
the bodies of those who believe in him and serve him.
<P>
His nature is of the nature of thought and will.  Not only has he, 
in his essence, nothing to do with matter, but nothing to do with 
space.  He is not of matter nor of space.  He comes into them.  
Since the period when all the great theologies that prevail to-day 
were developed, there have been great changes in the ideas of men 
towards the dimensions of time and space.  We owe to Kant the 
release from the rule of these ideas as essential ideas.  Our modern 
psychology is alive to the possibility of Being that has no 
extension in space at all, even as our speculative geometry can 
entertain the possibility of dimensions--fourth, fifth, Nth 
dimensions--outside the three-dimensional universe of our 
experience.  And God being non-spatial is not thereby banished to an 
infinite remoteness, but brought nearer to us; he is everywhere 
immediately at hand, even as a fourth dimension would be everywhere 
immediately at hand.  He is a Being of the minds and in the minds of 
men.  He is in immediate contact with all who apprehend him. . . .
<P>
But modern religion declares that though he does not exist in matter 
or space, he exists in time just as a current of thought may do; 
that he changes and becomes more even as a man's purpose gathers 
itself together; that somewhere in the dawning of mankind he had a 
beginning, an awakening, and that as mankind grows he grows.  With 
our eyes he looks out upon the universe he invades; with our hands, 
he lays hands upon it.  All our truth, all our intentions and 
achievements, he gathers to himself.  He is the undying human 
memory, the increasing human will.
<P>
But this, you may object, is no more than saying that God is the 
collective mind and purpose of the human race.  You may declare that 
this is no God, but merely the sum of mankind.  But those who 
believe in the new ideas very steadfastly deny that.  God is, they 
say, not an aggregate but a synthesis.  He is not merely the best of 
all of us, but a Being in himself, composed of that but more than 
that, as a temple is more than a gathering of stones, or a regiment 
is more than an accumulation of men.  They point out that a man is 
made up of a great multitude of cells, each equivalent to a 
unicellular organism.  Not one of those cells is he, nor is he 
simply just the addition of all of them.  He is more than all of 
them.  You can take away these and these and these, and he still 
remains.  And he can detach part of himself and treat it as if it 
were not himself, just as a man may beat his breast or, as Cranmer 
the martyr did, thrust his hand into the flames.  A man is none the 
less himself because his hair is cut or his appendix removed or his 
leg amputated.
<P>
And take another image. . . .  Who bears affection for this or that 
spadeful of mud in my garden?  Who cares a throb of the heart for 
all the tons of chalk in Kent or all the lumps of limestone in 
Yorkshire?  But men love England, which is made up of such things.
<P>
And so we think of God as a synthetic reality, though he has neither 
body nor material parts.  And so too we may obey him and listen to 
him, though we think but lightly of the men whose hands or voices he 
sometimes uses.  And we may think of him as having moods and 
aspects--as a man has--and a consistency we call his character.
<P>
These are theorisings about God.  These are statements to convey 
this modern idea of God.  This, we say, is the nature of the person 
whose will and thoughts we serve.  No one, however, who understands 
the religious life seeks conversion by argument.  First one must 
feel the need of God, then one must form or receive an acceptable 
idea of God.  That much is no more than turning one's face to the 
east to see the coming of the sun.  One may still doubt if that 
direction is the east or whether the sun will rise.  The real coming 
of God is not that.  It is a change, an irradiation of the mind.  
Everything is there as it was before, only now it is aflame.  
Suddenly the light fills one's eyes, and one knows that God has 
risen and that doubt has fled for ever.
<P>
<P>
3. GOD IS YOUTH
<P>
<P>
The third thing to be told of the true God is that GOD IS YOUTH.
<P>
God, we hold, began and is always beginning.  He looks forever into 
the future.
<P>
Most of the old religions derive from a patriarchal phase.  God is 
in those systems the Ancient of Days.  I know of no Christian 
attempt to represent or symbolise God the Father which is not a 
bearded, aged man.  White hair, beard, bearing, wrinkles, a hundred 
such symptoms of senile decay are there.  These marks of senility do 
not astonish our modern minds in the picture of God, only because 
tradition and usage have blinded our eyes to the absurdity of a 
time-worn immortal.  Jove too and Wotan are figures far past the 
prime of their vigour.  These are gods after the ancient habit of 
the human mind, that turned perpetually backward for causes and 
reasons and saw all things to come as no more than the working out 
of Fate,--
<P>
     "Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit
      Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
      Brought death into the world and all our woe."
<P>
But the God of this new age, we repeat, looks not to our past but 
our future, and if a figure may represent him it must be the figure 
of a beautiful youth, already brave and wise, but hardly come to his 
strength.  He should stand lightly on his feet in the morning time, 
eager to go forward, as though he had but newly arisen to a day that 
was still but a promise; he should bear a sword, that clean, 
discriminating weapon, his eyes should be as bright as swords; his 
lips should fall apart with eagerness for the great adventure before 
him, and he should be in very fresh and golden harness, reflecting 
the rising sun.  Death should still hang like mists and cloud banks 
and shadows in the valleys of the wide landscape about him.  There 
should be dew upon the threads of gossamer and little leaves and 
blades of the turf at his feet. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. WHEN WE SAY GOD IS LOVE
<P>
<P>
One of the sayings about God that have grown at the same time most 
trite and most sacred, is that God is Love.  This is a saying that 
deserves careful examination.  Love is a word very loosely used; 
there are people who will say they love new potatoes; there are a 
multitude of loves of different colours and values.  There is the 
love of a mother for her child, there is the love of brothers, there 
is the love of youth and maiden, and the love of husband and wife, 
there is illicit love and the love one bears one's home or one's 
country, there are dog-lovers and the loves of the Olympians, and 
love which is a passion of jealousy.  Love is frequently a mere 
blend of appetite and preference; it may be almost pure greed; it 
may have scarcely any devotion nor be a whit self-forgetful nor 
generous.  It is possible so to phrase things that the furtive 
craving of a man for another man's wife may be made out to be a 
light from God.  Yet about all the better sorts of love, the sorts 
of love that people will call "true love," there is something of 
that same exaltation out of the narrow self that is the essential 
quality of the knowledge of God.
<P>
Only while the exaltation of the love passion comes and goes, the 
exaltation of religious passion comes to remain.  Lovers are the 
windows by which we may look out of the prison of self, but God is 
the open door by which we freely go.  And God never dies, nor 
disappoints, nor betrays.
<P>
The love of a woman and a man has usually, and particularly in its 
earlier phases of excitement, far too much desire, far too much 
possessiveness and exclusiveness, far too much distrust or forced 
trust, and far too great a kindred with jealousy to be like the love 
of God.  The former is a dramatic relationship that drifts to a 
climax, and then again seeks presently a climax, and that may be 
satiated or fatigued.  But the latter is far more like the love of 
comrades, or like the love of a man and a woman who have loved and 
been through much trouble together, who have hurt one another and 
forgiven, and come to a complete and generous fellowship.  There is 
a strange and beautiful love that men tell of that will spring up on 
battlefields between sorely wounded men, and often they are men who 
have fought together, so that they will do almost incredibly brave 
and tender things for one another, though but recently they have 
been trying to kill each other.  There is often a pure exaltation of 
feeling between those who stand side by side manfully in any great 
stress.  These are the forms of love that perhaps come nearest to 
what we mean when we speak of the love of God.
<P>
That is man's love of God, but there is also something else; there 
is the love God bears for man in the individual believer.  Now this 
is not an indulgent, instinctive, and sacrificing love like the love 
of a woman for her baby.  It is the love of the captain for his men; 
God must love his followers as a great captain loves his men, who 
are so foolish, so helpless in themselves, so confiding, and yet 
whose faith alone makes him possible.  It is an austere love.  The 
spirit of God will not hesitate to send us to torment and bodily 
death. . . .
<P>
And God waits for us, for all of us who have the quality to reach 
him.  He has need of us as we of him.  He desires us and desires to 
make himself known to us.  When at last the individual breaks 
through the limiting darknesses to him, the irradiation of that 
moment, the smile and soul clasp, is in God as well as in man.  He 
has won us from his enemy.  We come staggering through into the 
golden light of his kingdom, to fight for his kingdom henceforth, 
until at last we are altogether taken up into his being.
