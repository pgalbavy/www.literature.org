<p> Some commanders of ships take their Departure from the home
coast sadly, in a spirit of grief and discontent.  They have a
wife, children perhaps, some affection at any rate, or perhaps
only some pet vice, that must be left behind for a year or more. 
I remember only one man who walked his deck with a springy step,
and gave the first course of the passage in an elated voice. 
But he, as I learned afterwards, was leaving nothing behind him,
except a welter of debts and threats of legal proceedings.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have known many captains who, directly their
ship had left the narrow waters of the Channel, would disappear
from the sight of their ship’s company altogether for some three
days or more.  They would take a long dive, as it were, into their
state-room, only to emerge a few days afterwards with a more or
less serene brow.  Those were the men easy to get on with.  Besides,
such a complete retirement seemed to imply a satisfactory amount
of trust in their officers, and to be trusted displeases no seaman
worthy of the name.</p>

<p>On my first voyage as chief mate with good Captain MacW— I remember
that I felt quite flattered, and went blithely about my duties,
myself a commander for all practical purposes.  Still, whatever
the greatness of my illusion, the fact remained that the real
commander was there, backing up my self-confidence, though invisible
to my eyes behind a maple-wood veneered cabin-door with a white
china handle.</p>

<p>That is the time, after your Departure is taken, when the spirit
of your commander communes with you in a muffled voice, as if
from the sanctum sanctorum of a temple; because, call her a temple
or a "hell afloat"—as some ships have been called—the captain’s
state-room is surely the august place in every vessel.</p>

<p>The good MacW— would not even come out to his meals, and fed
solitarily in his holy of holies from a tray covered with a white
napkin.  Our steward used to bend an ironic glance at the perfectly
empty plates he was bringing out from there.  This grief for his
home, which overcomes so many married seamen, did not deprive
Captain MacW— of his legitimate appetite.  In fact, the steward
would almost invariably come up to me, sitting in the captain’s
chair at the head of the table, to say in a grave murmur, "The
captain asks for one more slice of meat and two potatoes."  We,
his officers, could hear him moving about in his berth, or lightly
snoring, or fetching deep sighs, or splashing and blowing in his
bath-room; and we made our reports to him through the keyhole,
as it were.  It was the crowning achievement of his amiable character
that the answers we got were given in a quite mild and friendly
tone.  Some commanders in their periods of seclusion are constantly
grumpy, and seem to resent the mere sound of your voice as an
injury and an insult.</p>

<p>But a grumpy recluse cannot worry his subordinates: whereas the
man in whom the sense of duty is strong (or, perhaps, only the
sense of self-importance), and who persists in airing on deck
his moroseness all day—and perhaps half the night—becomes a grievous
infliction.  He walks the poop darting gloomy glances, as though
he wished to poison the sea, and snaps your head off savagely
whenever you happen to blunder within earshot.  And these vagaries
are the harder to bear patiently, as becomes a man and an officer,
because no sailor is really good-tempered during the first few
days of a voyage.  There are regrets, memories, the instinctive
longing for the departed idleness, the instinctive hate of all
work.  Besides, things have a knack of going wrong at the start,
especially in the matter of irritating trifles.  And there is
the abiding thought of a whole year of more or less hard life
before one, because there was hardly a southern-going voyage in
the yesterday of the sea which meant anything less than a twelvemonth. 
Yes; it needed a few days after the taking of your departure for
a ship’s company to shake down into their places, and for the
soothing deep-water ship routine to establish its beneficent sway.</p>

<p>It is a great doctor for sore hearts and sore heads, too, your
ship’s routine, which I have seen soothe—at least for a time—the
most turbulent of spirits.  There is health in it, and peace,
and satisfaction of the accomplished round; for each day of the
ship’s life seems to close a circle within the wide ring of the
sea horizon.  It borrows a certain dignity of sameness from the
majestic monotony of the sea.  He who loves the sea loves also
the ship’s routine.</p>

<p>Nowhere else than upon the sea do the days, weeks and months
fall away quicker into the past.  They seem to be left astern
as easily as the light air-bubbles in the swirls of the ship’s
wake, and vanish into a great silence in which your ship moves
on with a sort of magical effect. They pass away, the days, the
weeks, the months.  Nothing but a gale can disturb the orderly
life of the ship; and the spell of unshaken monotony that seems
to have fallen upon the very voices of her men is broken only
by the near prospect of a Landfall.</p>

<p>Then is the spirit of the ship’s commander stirred strongly again. 
But it is not moved to seek seclusion, and to remain, hidden and
inert, shut up in a small cabin with the solace of a good bodily
appetite.  When about to make the land, the spirit of the ship’s
commander is tormented by an unconquerable restlessness.  It seems
unable to abide for many seconds together in the holy of holies
of the captain’s state-room; it will out on deck and gaze ahead,
through straining eyes, as the appointed moment comes nearer. 
It is kept vigorously upon the stretch of excessive vigilance. 
Meantime the body of the ship’s commander is being enfeebled by
want of appetite; at least, such is my experience, though "enfeebled"
is perhaps not exactly the word.  I might say, rather, that it
is spiritualized by a disregard for food, sleep, and all the ordinary
comforts, such as they are, of sea life.  In one or two cases
I have known that detachment from the grosser needs of existence
remain regrettably incomplete in the matter of drink.</p>

<p>But these two cases were, properly speaking, pathological cases,
and the only two in all my sea experience.  In one of these two
instances of a craving for stimulants, developed from sheer anxiety,
I cannot assert that the man’s seamanlike qualities were impaired
in the least.  It was a very anxious case, too, the land being
made suddenly, close-to, on a wrong bearing, in thick weather,
and during a fresh onshore gale.  Going below to speak to him
soon after, I was unlucky enough to catch my captain in the very
act of hasty cork-drawing.  The sight, I may say, gave me an awful
scare.  I was well aware of the morbidly sensitive nature of the
man.  Fortunately, I managed to draw back unseen, and, taking
care to stamp heavily with my sea-boots at the foot of the cabin
stairs, I made my second entry.  But for this unexpected glimpse,
no act of his during the next twenty-four hours could have given
me the slightest suspicion that all was not well with his nerve.</p>
