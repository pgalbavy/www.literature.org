<p>In the meantime Jo Stinger, the veteran frontiersman, had not
found the "plain sailing" which he anticipated.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that he passed out upon the clearing in
front of the block-house, because he feared that, if he entered
the yard inclosed by the stockade, he would find himself among
the Wyandots, who would be quick to detect his identity.</p>

<p>His presence immediately in front of the structure would also
draw attention to himself, and he therefore glided away until
he was fully a hundred feet distant, when he paused close to the
western pickets.</p>

<p>Looking behind him, he could not see the outlines of the building
which he had just left. For the sake of safety Colonel Preston
allowed no light burning within the block-house, which itself
was like a solid bank of darkness.</p>

<p>"It would be easy enough now for me to make my way to Wild Oaks,"
reflected Stinger; "for, when the night is like this, three hundred
Indians could not surround the old place close enough to catch
any one crawling through. But it is no use for me to strike out
for the Ohio now, for the boys could not get here soon enough
to affect the result one way or the other. Long before that the
varmints will wind up this bus'ness, either by going away, or
by cleaning out the whole concern."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger unquestionably was right in this conclusion, but he
possessed a strong faith that Colonel Preston and the rest of
them in the block-house would be able to pull through, if they
displayed the vigilance and care which it was easy to display:
this faith explains how it was the frontiersman had ventured upon
what was, beyond all doubt, a most perilous enterprise.</p>

<p>Jo, from some cause or other which he could not explain, suspected
the Wyandots were collecting near the well, and he began working
his way in that direction.</p>

<p>It was unnecessary to scale the stockade, and he therefore moved
along the western side, until he reached the angle, when he turned
to the right and felt his way parallel with the northern line
of pickets.</p>

<p>Up to this time he had not caught sight or sound to show that
an Indian was within a mile of him. The fine particles of snow
made themselves manifest only by the icy, needle-like points which
touched his face and hands, as he groped along. He carried his
faithful rifle in his left hand, and his right rested on the haft
of his long hunting-knife at his waist. His head was thrust forward,
while he peered to the right and left, advancing with as much
care as if he were entering a hostile camp on a moonlight night,
when the overturning of a leaf is enough to awaken a score of
sleeping red men.</p>

<p>A moment after passing the corner of the stockade something touched
his elbow. He knew on the instant that it was one of the Wyandots.
In the darkness they had come thus close without either suspecting
the presence of the other.</p>

<p>"Hooh! my brother is like Deerfoot, the dog of a Shawanoe."</p>

<p>This was uttered in the Wyandot tongue, and the scout understood
the words, but he did not dare reply. He could not speak well
enough to deceive the warrior, who evidently supposed he was one
of his own people.</p>

<p>But there was the single exclamation which he could imitate to
perfection, and he did so as he drew his knife.</p>

<p>"Hooh!" he responded, moving on without the slightest halt. The
response seemed satisfactory to the Wyandot, but could Jo have
seen the actions of the Indian immediately after, he would have
felt anything but secure on that point.</p>

<p>The brave stood a minute or so, looking in the direction taken
by the other, and then, as if suspicious that all was not what
it seemed, he followed after the figure which had vanished so
quickly.</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal if I but knowed what he meant by speaking
of Deerfoot as he did," said Jo to himself, "but I didn't dare
ask him to give the partic'lars. I make no doubt they've catched
the Shawanoe and scalped him long ago."</p>

<p>Remembering the openings which he had seen in the stockade before
the darkness became so intense, Jo reached out his right hand
and run it along the pickets, so as not to miss them.</p>

<p>He had gone only a little way, when his touch revealed the spot
where a couple had been removed, and there was room for him to
force his body through.</p>

<p>Jo was of a spare figure, and, with little difficulty, he entered
the space inclosed by the stockade. He now knew his surroundings
and bearings, as well as though it were high noon, and began making
his way with great stealth in the direction of the well standing
near the middle of the yard.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, the Wyandot with whom he had exchanged
salutations was stealing after him: it was the old case of the
hunter going to hunt the tiger, and soon finding the tiger was
hunting him.</p>

<p>The task of the Wyandot, however, for the time, was a more delicate
one than was the white man's, for the dusky pursuer had lost sight
of his foe (if indeed it can be said he had ever caught a view
of him), instantly after the brief salutation between them.</p>

<p>The warrior, when he reached the first opening in the stockade,
had no means of knowing that the pale-face had passed through.
Had there been any daylight to aid his vision, he could have learned
the truth at once; but if there had been daylight, there could
have been no such necessity, inasmuch as Jo Stinger would have
stayed in the block-house.</p>

<p>The fact that he could not trace the daring scout with any certainty,
did not deprive the Wyandot of the ability to do something for
himself and companions.</p>

<p>When Jo Stinger passed within the stockade, he fixed the direction
in which lay the well, and then began advancing toward it. The
result of this venture proved again, how often the most careful
preparation is defeated by some simple obstruction against which
a child ought to have guarded.</p>

<p>"I must be pretty near the spot," thought Jo, when he had groped
vaguely for some distance; "I can't imagine what the varmints
can be doin' here, but they've got some plan on foot which I'm
bound&#11834;"</p>

<p>At this instant, with a shock which made his hair fairly rise
on end, he stepped directly into the well and went down!</p>

<p>The rickety inclosure of slabs, with the crank and windlass,
had been removed by the Wyandots, so that in case any of the garrison
ventured out, under cover of darkness, to get water, they would
be unable to do so.</p>

<p>The theft of the curb, bucket, and appliances, shut off the supply
from that source as utterly as though it had never existed. And
yet, not a single member of the garrison, knowing as they did
that the Wyandots were carrying out some design, suspected what
their real purpose was.</p>

<p>Providence alone saved Jo Stinger from an ignominious end, for
had he gone to the bottom of the well, the Indians could not have
failed to discover it, and they would have carried out their own
will concerning him.</p>

<p>But the life of peril which Jo had led so many years, greatly
developed a certain readiness and presence of mind natural to
him; but it was probably the instinctive desire to catch himself,
which led him on the instant to place the gun in his left hand
in a horizontal position. The diameter of the well was much less
than the length of the old-fashioned flint-lock rifle; and thus
it came about that muzzle and stock caught firmly, and Jo was
suspended in the middle of the opening by one hand. Hastily shoving
his knife back in his girdle, he seized the barrel with both hands
and easily drew himself from his dangerous position. Then he took
out his knife again and indulged in an expression of opinion concerning
his performances of the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>This opinion it is not necessary to place on record: the reader
need not be told that it was the reverse of complimentary, and
that it would have hardly been safe for any one else to repeat
the same vigorous comments in the presence of Jo himself.</p>

<p>He was not without gratitude for his delivery from the consequences
of his own carelessness, but he was exasperated beyond expression
by the stupidity which had seemed to brood over the counsels of
the garrison from the first and to direct everything done.</p>

<p>While a prey to this gnawing chagrin, he suddenly became aware
that one of the Wyandots was at his elbow again.</p>

<p>"My brother treads like the shadows of the clouds which sweep
over the forest: there is no sound, and he glides&#11834;"</p>

<p>"This is his style of gliding," interrupted Jo Stinger, who was
in a most dangerous mood, as he bounded like a panther toward
him.</p>

<p>The grapple was short and terrific: there was one wild piercing
shriek from the dusky foeman, and then it was all over. Jo hurried
from the spot, for he knew others would be there in a few seconds,
and they would be quick to detect or at least to surmise the truth.</p>

<p>He hastened back over the path by which he had approached the
well, passing through the same opening that had admitted him.
Then, with a view of avoiding any one who might be using the same
route, he moved a rod or two away from the stockade, turning the
corner nearly as before and starting on his return to the block-house.</p>

<p>Jo's belief was that he could accomplish nothing more by staying
outside the building. He had learned that about the well which
he ought to have known long before, and the Wyandots had already
ascertained that one of the garrison, or possibly some friend
from another point, was on the outside. They would take precaution
against his entering the block-house, and doubtless would exert
themselves to detect and slay him.</p>

<p>He felt therefore that it would not do to delay his return. He
did not do so, and yet, quick as he was, he made the discovery
after all that he was just too late. Approaching the door of the
building with extreme caution, it did not take him long to learn
that the Wyandots were there before him.</p>

<p>He withdrew with the same care, and continued stealing some distance
further in a southern direction, finally halting close to the
cabin from which the Wyandots had issued when they interfered
with the flight of Blossom Brown and Ned Preston across the clearing.</p>

<p>Jo felt the situation was becoming serious. He had not thought
of anything like this, and he had made no arrangement for a system
of signals to meet the difficulty. Colonel Preston would detect
his low, tremulous whistle, by which the scout was accustomed
to make known his presence on the outside and his desire to enter;
but there was no means of apprising the Colonel of the alarming
fact that a number of Indians were waiting in the darkness to
take his place.</p>

<p>Had Jo thought of all this beforehand, there would have been
no such startling occurrence at the door, as has been described.</p>

<p>He did not believe it probable the Wyandots would emit any signals
which would deceive Colonel Preston into the belief that it was
a friend and not an enemy who was asking admission into the station.</p>

<p>While the pioneer stood aloof in the darkness, debating and asking
himself what was best to do, his keen vision was able to mark
the shape of something which puzzled him only for the moment.
It was a parallelogram of a faint yellow glow only a short distance
in front of him.</p>

<p>"That comes from a light in the cabin, where them varmints have
been loafing ever since the rumpus yesterday morning."</p>

<p>Jo was right in this supposition: he had approached the dwelling,
wherein were several Wyandots who had a fire burning on the hearth.
The yellow reflection showing through one of the side-windows
led Jo to detect its meaning with scarce a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>As yet he had succeeded in learning nothing of importance, for
no one would attempt to draw any water from the well during the
night, and if the block-house should remain on its foundations
until morning, every one of the garrison could see for himself
that the supply was no longer available.</p>

<p>What secret might not the old cabin give up to him? Was it not
there that he should seek the key to the problem which had baffled
him thus far?</p>

<p>These and similar questions Jo Stinger put to himself, as he
advanced toward the structure wherein he was certain to find more
than one Wyandot.</p>

<p>As his approach was from the side instead of the front, as it
may be called (by which is meant that part of the cabin which
faced the block-house itself), the red men within had taken no
precautions against observation from that direction.</p>

<p>While Jo was yet ten feet from the window, he gained a view of
the interior that showed everything in the room, with whose contour
he was familiar. The sight which met his gaze was a most interesting
one indeed.</p>

<p>There were three Indians seated, cross-legged like Turks, on
the floor, smoking their pipes, while they talked earnestly together.
One of these, from his dress and manner, Jo knew was the chief
or leader of the war party. It was, in fact, Waughtauk who was
holding a consultation with his two lieutenants, if they may be
termed such, on the "conduct of the war."</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had no doubt that such was their occupation, and he
was certain that, if he could overhear their words, he was likely
to gather the very information he was seeking.</p>

<p>As we have already intimated, he understood the Wyandot tongue,
and he was eager to catch the expressions, especially those which
fell from the lips of the chief himself.</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will come from the Ohio," were the first words
which Stinger was able to hear, and they were uttered by Waughtauk
himself; "if we wait until to-morrow, they will be here before
nightfall."</p>

<p>This implied rather rapid traveling on the part of the party
of rescue from Wild Oaks, and it was more than likely that the
chief, with a view of adding force to his remarks, exaggerated
matters to a certain extent.</p>

<p>"One of the Yenghese is abroad to-night," said the warrior next
the chief. As he spoke, he took his pipe from his mouth and used
it in gesticulating; "he has slain one of our braves."</p>

<p>"He shall die for his offence, as all the Yenghese shall die,"
replied the chieftain, in a voice so loud that the listener could
have caught his meaning had he been a rod further away. "None
of them shall see the sun rise again. They shall be burned in
the block-house, which has encumbered our hunting-grounds too
long."</p>

<p>This threat was only what might have been expected, but Waughtauk
the next minute imparted the very tidings which Jo Stinger sought,
and for the sake of which he had risked so much.</p>

<p>"The wind blows strong; the Great Spirit will soon fan the fire
into a blaze, and will carry it from this cabin to the block-house."</p>

<p>There it was!</p>

<p>The whole scheme was laid bare to the scout in the last sentence
spoken by the Wyandot chieftain. The wind was setting in strongly
from the south, that is, from the building in which the three
warriors gathered, directly toward the block-house.</p>

<p>Should the former be fired, the probability was the gale would
carry the sparks to the other and set that in a blaze, in which
event there would be scarcely an earthly hope left for a single
one of the inmates.</p>

<p>Jo had heard enough, and his wish now was to get back to his
friends with the least possible delay, that they might make preparation
against the assault that could not be postponed much longer.</p>

<p>Knowing the superstition of the American Indian, the scout now
resorted to an artifice as daring as it was startling. Although
a man trained in border-warfare, accustomed to the frightful cruelties
of the aborigines, and knowing the fierce purposes of the Wyandots
surrounding Fort Bridgman, he could not bring himself to the point
of deliberately shooting down one or more of the conspirators,
who, in point of fact, were at his mercy.</p>

<p>Many a brave hunter or pioneer, placed in his situation, would
have seized the opportunity to shoot the chieftain himself while
sitting in the cabin, unsuspicious of his danger; but Jo Stinger
was not of such a disposition.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: <em>JOE STINGER PUTS IN AN APPEARANCE</em>.]</p>

<p>Raising his long rifle to his shoulder, he pointed it straight
at Waughtauk, and then advanced until the muzzle was thrust through
the window, while he himself stood no more than a foot outside.</p>

<p>At that instant one of the warriors reached down and stirred
the blazing sticks of wood burning on the hearth. The flames leaped
higher, filling the room with a warm ruddy glow. A slight noise
caused the three Wyandots to turn their heads toward the open
window, when they saw a sight which held them spell-bound.</p>

<p>A tall spare man, in the garb of a hunter, stood with his deadly
rifle pointed straight at them, and the muzzle was not twelve
feet distant from the head of Waughtauk the chief.</p>

<p>Looking along the barrel, pointing like the finger of fate at
the Wyandot leader, the bony fingers of the left hand were seen
grasping the dark iron, while the right hand, crooked at the elbow,
encompassed the trigger-guard, and the forefinger was gently pressing
the trigger. The hammer clutching the yellow flint was drawn far
back, like the jaw of a rattlesnake when about to bury its fangs
in its victim, and just behind that the single open eye of the
hunter himself seemed to be agleam with a fire that was likely
to ignite the powder in the pan, without the flash of the quartz.</p>

<p>The coonskin cap, the grizzly whiskers, the rough garments were
frosted with tiny snowflakes which glistened and glinted in the
fire-light like points of burnished silver. The figure was as
motionless as were the three Wyandots, who could only stare at
what must have seemed an apparition from the other world. As they
gazed, the figure spoke in a slow sepulchral voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the Wyandot chieftain and his warriors go back to their
squaws and pappooses, for the pale-face is hurrying through the
forest to burn his lodges and to make captive his children! The
Great Spirit commands that the Wyandots shall go."</p>

<p>Having uttered these extraordinary words, Jo Stinger took several
steps backward, without moving a muscle of the upper portion of
his body, so silently and imperceptibly that he seemed to dissolve
in the surrounding darkness.</p>

<p>The moment after, Waughtauk uttered a cry of such distress that
the Wyandots in the immediate neighborhood heard it and hurried
to him. Stinger was quick to perceive his chance, and hurrying
to the door of the block-house, he rapped so sharply on it that
the listening Colonel Preston hurried down the ladder and approached
the entrance.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked the commandant, in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"Me &mdash;Jo; it's all right; quick, let me in afore the varmints
get back!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the voice, and Colonel Preston removed
the fastenings with a nervous haste, which did not leave him until
his friend was inside, and the bars were replaced in their sockets.</p>

<p>He then grasped the hand of Jo and shook it warmly, for the relief
of all over the return of the invaluable scout was beyond expression.
They hurriedly went up the ladder, where all, including Mrs. Preston,
who declared she could sleep no more that night, listened to the
stirring story which Jo had to tell. His auditors fairly held
their breath when he drew the picture of himself standing at the
window of the cabin, with his rifle pointed at the Wyandot chief,
and commanding him in the name of the Great Spirit to hasten to
protect his own lodges from the invading white man.</p>

<p>"You gave him such a fright that he may strike his tents and
leave," suggested Colonel Preston.</p>

<p>"No," said Jo; "such things have been done, and Simon Kenton
once played the trick so well that he kept a party of Delawares
from massacreing a white family going down the Ohio, but Kenton
had a much better show than me."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Jo, you had everything in your favor," said
Megill, who, like all the others, was deeply interested in the
narrative of the hunter.</p>

<p>"There's just the trouble; the chief and his men were scared
out of their moccasins for a minute or so, and if it had happened
that I hadn't showed myself afore, and the Wyandots didn't know
I was outside, the scare might have amounted to something; but
when the other warriors come around the chief, and he learns what
has took place&mdash;if he didn't know it all before&mdash;he'll see that
the whole thing was a trick, and he will be madder than ever.
I think he'll open the music agin very soon."</p>

<p>"If he fires the cabin," said Colonel Preston, "it will be apt
to make it pretty warm in here, for the wind does come from that
direction, and I wish the thing didn't stand quite so near us
as it does. But the sides of the block-house are not so dry as
the roof, and I hope we can stand more heat from <em>that</em>
source than the Wyandots think."</p>

<p>"We have considerable water left," said Jo, "and we must take
mighty good care that none of it is wasted."</p>

<p>"Did you find the tomahawk in the door?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I felt for it, but it was gone."</p>

<p>The prospects were discussed in low, earnest tones, while every
one was in a fever of expectancy. There was constant peeping through
the loopholes, and the occasional whistling and whooping were
accepted as signals to open the last decisive attack.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger was moving about in this manner, doing what he could
to cheer his friends, when some one caught his elbow.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked, stopping short.</p>

<p>"It is I, Ned Preston," replied the boy; "I want to ask you a
question."</p>

<p>"Well, younker, what is it?" said the hunter in a kindly manner,
and lowering his voice, so that the others could not overhear
them.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you whether you learned anything about Deerfoot,
when you were out."</p>

<p>"Nothing partic'lar; I heard his name mentioned by that varmint
that run against me, after I didn't fall into the well."</p>

<p>"How was it?"</p>

<p>Jo related the incident in which he was compared to the young
Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Jo?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course none of us knows anything for sartin,&mdash;but it's
my opinion&mdash;since you ax it&mdash;that Deerfoot has slid under for
good."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," said Ned Preston faintly. "Poor Deerfoot!"</p>
