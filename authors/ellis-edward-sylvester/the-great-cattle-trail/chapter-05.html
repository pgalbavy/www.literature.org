<p>Profound stillness followed the despairing exclamation of Mrs.
Shirril, who believed that her nephew had gone to his death while
trying to steal away from the cabin in which his friends were
held at bay by the Comanches.</p>

<p>The quiet on the outside was as deep and oppressive as within.
There was the sharp, resounding report of the rifle, followed
on the instant by the wild cry of mortal pain, and then all became
like the tomb itself.</p>

<p>It was singular that the first spark of hope was kindled by the
words of the colored servant, Dinah.</p>

<p>"What makes you tink de boy am dead?" she asked, a moment after
the woful words of her mistress.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear him cry out just now?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't hear him nor did you either; dat warn't de voice
ob Avon."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?" asked Mrs. Shirril, beginning to feel
anew hope within her.</p>

<p>"Lor' o' massy! habent I heerd de voice ob dat younker offen
'nough to know it 'mong ten fousand? Habent I heerd him yell,
too? he neber does it in <em>dat</em> style; dat war an Injin,
and de reason dat he screeched out in dat onmarciful way war 'cause
he got in de path ob Avon and de boy plugged him."</p>

<p>"By gracious, Dinah! I believe you're right!" was the exclamation
of Captain Shirril, so joyous over the rebound from despair that
he was ready to dance a breakdown in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>"Course I is right, 'cause I <em>allers</em> is right."</p>

<p>"I suppose there is some reason in that, but please keep quiet&mdash;both
of you, for a few minutes, while I listen further."</p>

<p>The women were standing near the captain, who once more inclined
his head, with his ear at the small orifice in the door.</p>

<p>The seconds seemed minutes in length, but as they wore away,
nothing definite was heard. Once or twice the tramp of horses'
feet was noticed, and other sounds left no doubt that most of
the Comanches were still near the dwelling.</p>

<p>This listening would have lasted longer, but for an unpleasant
though not dangerous interruption. Dinah, who seemed to be meeting
with some trouble in her respiration, suddenly emitted a sneeze
of such prodigious force that her friends were startled.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for them to enquire as to the cause. The
blanket that had been thrown upon the flames, and which brought
instant night, did its work well, but it was beginning to suffer
therefrom. The fire was almost smothered, but enough air reached
it around the edges of the thick cloth to cause it to burn with
considerable vigor, and give out a slight illumination, but, worst
of all, it filled the room with dense, overpowering smoke. Breathing
was difficult and the odor dreadful.</p>

<p>"This will never do," said the captain, glancing at the fireplace,
where the glowing edges of the blanket were growing fast; "we
won't be able to breathe."</p>

<p>His first thought was to fling another blanket upon the embers,
thereby extinguishing them altogether, but his wife anticipated
him by scattering the contents of the water pail with such judgment
over the young conflagration that it was extinguished utterly.
Darkness reigned again, but the vapor, increased by the dousing
of the liquid, rendered the room almost unbearable.</p>

<p>"You and Dinah had better go upstairs," said the captain to his
wife; "close the door after you, and, by and by, the lower floor
will clear; I can get enough fresh air at the little opening in
the door and by the windows to answer for me; if there is any
need of you, I can call, but perhaps you may find something to
do up there yourselves."</p>

<p>The wife and servant obeyed, each taking her gun with her, together
with enough ammunition to provide for fully a score of shots.</p>

<p>The cabin which Captain Dohm Shirril had erected on his ranch
in upper Texas was long and low, as we have already intimated.
There was but the single apartment on the first floor, which served
as a kitchen, dining and sitting room, and parlor. When crowded
his guests, to the number of a dozen, more or less, could spread
their blankets on the floor, and sleep the sleep that waits on
rugged health and bounding spirits.</p>

<p>The upper story was divided into three apartments. The one at
the end served for the bedroom of the captain and his wife; the
next belonged to Dinah, while the one beyond, as large as the
other two, was appropriated by Avon and such of the cattlemen
as found it convenient to sleep under a roof, which is often less
desirable to the Texan than the canopy of heaven.</p>

<p>Few of these dwellings are provided with cellars, and there was
nothing of the kind attached to the residence of Captain Shirril.
The house was made of logs and heavy timbers, the slightly sloping
roof being of heavy roughly hewn planking. Stone was scarce in
that section, but enough had been gathered to form a serviceable
fireplace, the wooden flue of which ascended to the roof from
within the building.</p>

<p>This brief description will give the reader an idea of the character
of the structure, in which one man and two women found themselves
besieged by a war party of fierce Comanches.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the lower floor was so low that, had the captain
stood erect with an ordinary silk hat on his head, it would have
touched it. The stairs consisted of a short, sloping ladder, over
which a trap-door could be shut, so as to prevent anyone entering
from below.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as smoke generally climbs upward, the second story would
have proven a poor refuge had the women waited any time before
resorting to it. As it was, considerable vapor accompanied them
up the rounds of the ladder, but, when the trap-door was closed
after them, the greater purity of the air afforded both relief.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that the lower story was furnished with two
windows at the front, of such strait form that no man could force
his way through them. The upper floor was more liberally provided
in this respect, each apartment having a window at the front and
rear, though the foresight of Captain Shirril made these as narrow
as those below. Indeed they were so near the ground that otherwise
they would have formed a continual invitation to hostile parties
to enter through them.</p>

<p>So long as an attacking force kept off, three defenders like
those now within the house might defy double the number of assailants
that threatened them. No implement of warfare at the command of
the red men was sufficient to batter down the walls, or drive
the massive door from its hinges.</p>

<p>But the real source of danger has been indicated. The cabin was
located so far toward Western Texas, that it was exposed to raids
from the Comanches and Kioways, while occasionally a band of Apaches
penetrated the section from their regular hunting grounds in Arizona
or New Mexico.</p>

<p>Although the red men might find it impossible to force an entrance,
yet the darkness allowed them to manoeuvre outside, and lay their
plans with little danger of molestation. The roof of the building
had been seasoned by its long exposure to the weather, until it
was as dry as tinder. This was increased, if possible, by the
drought that had now lasted for months in that portion of Texas.
A slight fire would speedily fan itself into a flame that would
reduce the building to ashes.</p>

<p>"And it only needs to be started," thought Captain Shirril, when
he found himself alone below stairs, "and it will do the work;
it was very thoughtful in Edna to dash that pailful of water on
the smouldering blanket, and it quenched the embers, but, all
the same, it required the last drop in the house."</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be feared in the nature of thirst.
The defenders could go without drink easily enough for twenty-four
hours, and the issue of this serious matter would be settled one
way or other long before that period passed. The cowboys would
not wait long after sunrise for their leader, before setting out
to learn the cause of his delay.</p>

<p>The question of life and death must be answered before the rising
of the morrow's sun.</p>
