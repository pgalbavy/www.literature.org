<p>There was no excuse for not hearing this warning, for it was
uttered in a voice loud enough to reach over the whole extent
of the atoll.</p>

<p>Both Redvignez and Brazzier were enraged at the interference,
and there was an instant of time when the two were on the point
of attacking him. But he was a terrible foe for any one to assail,
and he would have made warm work, as they well knew, for he was
not afraid of the two together.</p>

<p>Brazzier was quick to comprehend the situation, and he refrained.</p>

<p>"Take away the girl, then," he commanded, "so I can get at him."</p>

<p>"I will not leave him," declared Inez, throwing her arms about
the neck of the captain, who was rising to his feet. "You mean
to hurt him, and you shan't hurt him without hurting me. He has
been kind, and he's a good man."</p>

<p>"Take her away," commanded Brazzier, with difficulty repressing
his anger at the repeated delay.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pomp! You won't let him hurt the captain?" pleaded Inez,
turning toward him, and ready to throw her arms about his dusky
neck, were it not that she was afraid to leave the captain for
the moment&mdash;he having risen to his feet, while he held her hand
and looked at his enemies, panting from his own great exertion,
though he did not speak a word.</p>

<p>Even in the dreadful peril which enveloped him, he was too proud
to ask for mercy from such wretches.</p>

<p>But the appeal of Inez to Pomp had produced its effect. When
she turned her misty eyes upon him, and pleaded in such piteous
tones for mercy, the mouth of the huge African twitched, and any
one could see that a hard struggle was going on within.</p>

<p>"If you don't keep those bad men from hurting Captain Bergen,"
she added, in the same impassioned manner, "I'll never speak to
you&mdash;never, never, never&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>This was accompanied by a stamp of her tiny foot, and then she
burst into weeping&mdash;sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>Hyde Brazzier stood irresolute, and seemed on the point of leaping,
knife in hand, upon the captain. But the prayer of the innocent
child had settled the question, and the sable Hercules sprang
in front of the endangered man.</p>

<p>"Dis 'ere thing hab gone fur 'nough; let de cap'in alone. If
dere's any killin' to be done, why I'm de one dat's gwine to do
it."</p>

<p>The two mutineers were wild with fury, for this unexpected show
of mercy promised to upset the whole scheme they had been hatching
for weeks. Both Redvignez and Brazzier protested vehemently, seeking
to show that it was imperatively necessary that both the officers
should be put out of the way, and that since the mate was gone,
it was the sheerest folly to allow the captain to remain.</p>

<p>But the words were thrown away.</p>

<p>The prayer of little Inez Hawthorne had reached the heart of
the gigantic African, and the sight of the child standing there
weeping was more than he could bear, although it but served to
add to the exasperation of the other two savages.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen did not stand mute and motionless during all this
rush of events, which really occupied but a few seconds. As soon
as he saw the way open, he took the hand of little Inez and began
moving in the direction of the schooner, his purpose being to
secure refuge upon that if possible. As he moved away he saw Pomp
and the two mutineers in conference, for Brazzier and Redvignez
at that moment would have given a large share of their prospective
wealth for the purpose of disposing finally and forever of the
captain.</p>

<p>"We have been in mutinies before, Pomp, and the only safe course&mdash;and
that ain't safe by any means&mdash;is to follow the rule that dead
men tell no tales."</p>

<p>"Dat may be de rule, but it ain't gwine to work in dis case;
an' de reason am 'cause de little gal dere don't want it done.
You can talk an' argufy fo' fourteen years, but it won't do no
good. De only way you can finish up de job am by killin' me fust."</p>

<p>The foregoing is the substance of the protests and replies of
the two parties to the angry discussion. It so happened, as we
have shown, that the African held the balance of power. He was
strong and courageous, and he was armed and ready to fight, and
they knew it. They did not dare to attack him openly, where the
result was so likely to be disastrous to both, and they were compelled
to fall in with his scheme of saving the captain, though it can
well be understood that it was the most distasteful thing to which
they could consent.</p>

<p>This discussion lasted but a few minutes; but, as we have said,
it was improved by Captain Bergen, who saw that the wisest course
for him to pursue was to remove the cause as far as practical.
He walked backward a few steps until he was some way off, when
he turned about, still holding the hand of Inez in his, and they
continued until a number of palm-trees intervened, when he sped
so rapidly that the child was kept on a run to maintain her place
at his side. She had ceased her crying, but her face and eyes
were red, and she was in an apprehensive, nervous and almost hysterical
condition from the terrible scene she had witnessed&mdash;a scene such
as should never be looked upon by one of her tender years.</p>

<p>A minute later Captain Bergen caught sight of the trimly-built
schooner lying at rest in the lagoon, close to the shore, and
his heart gave a throb of hope, that, if he could once secure
position on her deck, he would be able to hold his own against
the mutineers.</p>

<p>During the next few hurried minutes occupied in the passage to
the schooner, the conviction had grown upon him that this mercy
which had spared his life for a brief while would not be continued.
Pomp Cooper would not continue to be his friend after his spasm
of affection for Inez should spend itself, and devoid as the African
was of intellect, he was likely to understand that the true course
of the party who had entered upon the villainy was to make thorough
work of it.</p>

<p>The captain saw the three men still talking and gesticulating
angrily when he reached the schooner.</p>

<p>In a twinkling he had lifted Inez upon the deck, and then he
sprang after her. He ran into the cabin, reappearing in an instant
with the three loaded rifles.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, with a sigh of relief, "let them come! I am ready."</p>
