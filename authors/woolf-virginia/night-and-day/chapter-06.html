<p>Of all the hours of an ordinary working week-day, which are the
pleasantest to look forward to and to look back upon? If a single
instance is of use in framing a theory, it may be said that the
minutes between nine-twenty-five and nine-thirty in the morning
had a singular charm for Mary Datchet. She spent them in a very
enviable frame of mind; her contentment was almost unalloyed.
High in the air as her flat was, some beams from the morning sun
reached her even in November, striking straight at curtain, chair,
and carpet, and painting there three bright, true spaces of green,
blue, and purple, upon which the eye rested with a pleasure which
gave physical warmth to the body.</p>

<p>There were few mornings when Mary did not look up, as she bent
to lace her boots, and as she followed the yellow rod from curtain
to breakfast-table she usually breathed some sigh of thankfulness
that her life provided her with such moments of pure enjoyment.
She was robbing no one of anything, and yet, to get so much pleasure
from simple things, such as eating one’s breakfast alone in a
room which had nice colors in it, clean from the skirting of the
boards to the corners of the ceiling, seemed to suit her so thoroughly
that she used at first to hunt about for some one to apologize
to, or for some flaw in the situation. She had now been six months
in London, and she could find no flaw, but that, as she invariably
concluded by the time her boots were laced, was solely and entirely
due to the fact that she had her work. Every day, as she stood
with her dispatch-box in her hand at the door of her flat, and
gave one look back into the room to see that everything was straight
before she left, she said to herself that she was very glad that
she was going to leave it all, that to have sat there all day
long, in the enjoyment of leisure, would have been intolerable.</p>

<p>Out in the street she liked to think herself one of the workers
who, at this hour, take their way in rapid single file along all
the broad pavements of the city, with their heads slightly lowered,
as if all their effort were to follow each other as closely as
might be; so that Mary used to figure to herself a straight rabbit-run
worn by their unswerving feet upon the pavement. But she liked
to pretend that she was indistinguishable from the rest, and that
when a wet day drove her to the Underground or omnibus, she gave
and took her share of crowd and wet with clerks and typists and
commercial men, and shared with them the serious business of winding-up
the world to tick for another four-and-twenty hours.</p>

<p>Thus thinking, on the particular morning in question, she made
her away across Lincoln’s Inn Fields and up Kingsway, and so through
Southampton Row until she reached her office in Russell Square.
Now and then she would pause and look into the window of some
bookseller or flower shop, where, at this early hour, the goods
were being arranged, and empty gaps behind the plate glass revealed
a state of undress. Mary felt kindly disposed towards the shopkeepers,
and hoped that they would trick the midday public into purchasing,
for at this hour of the morning she ranged herself entirely on
the side of the shopkeepers and bank clerks, and regarded all
who slept late and had money to spend as her enemy and natural
prey. And directly she had crossed the road at Holborn, her thoughts
all came naturally and regularly to roost upon her work, and she
forgot that she was, properly speaking, an amateur worker, whose
services were unpaid, and could hardly be said to wind the world
up for its daily task, since the world, so far, had shown very
little desire to take the boons which Mary’s society for woman’s
suffrage had offered it.</p>

<p>She was thinking all the way up Southampton Row of notepaper
and foolscap, and how an economy in the use of paper might be
effected (without, of course, hurting Mrs. Seal’s feelings), for
she was certain that the great organizers always pounce, to begin
with, upon trifles like these, and build up their triumphant reforms
upon a basis of absolute solidity; and, without acknowledging
it for a moment, Mary Datchet was determined to be a great organizer,
and had already doomed her society to reconstruction of the most
radical kind. Once or twice lately, it is true, she had started,
broad awake, before turning into Russell Square, and denounced
herself rather sharply for being already in a groove, capable,
that is, of thinking the same thoughts every morning at the same
hour, so that the chestnut-colored brick of the Russell Square
houses had some curious connection with her thoughts about office
economy, and served also as a sign that she should get into trim
for meeting Mr. Clacton, or Mrs. Seal, or whoever might be beforehand
with her at the office. Having no religious belief, she was the
more conscientious about her life, examining her position from
time to time very seriously, and nothing annoyed her more than
to find one of these bad habits nibbling away unheeded at the
precious substance. What was the good, after all, of being a woman
if one didn’t keep fresh, and cram one’s life with all sorts of
views and experiments? Thus she always gave herself a little shake,
as she turned the corner, and, as often as not, reached her own
door whistling a snatch of a Somersetshire ballad.</p>

<p>The suffrage office was at the top of one of the large Russell
Square houses, which had once been lived in by a great city merchant
and his family, and was now let out in slices to a number of societies
which displayed assorted initials upon doors of ground glass,
and kept, each of them, a typewriter which clicked busily all
day long. The old house, with its great stone staircase, echoed
hollowly to the sound of typewriters and of errand-boys from ten
to six. The noise of different typewriters already at work, disseminating
their views upon the protection of native races, or the value
of cereals as foodstuffs, quickened Mary’s steps, and she always
ran up the last flight of steps which led to her own landing,
at whatever hour she came, so as to get her typewriter to take
its place in competition with the rest.</p>

<p>She sat herself down to her letters, and very soon all these
speculations were forgotten, and the two lines drew themselves
between her eyebrows, as the contents of the letters, the office
furniture, and the sounds of activity in the next room gradually
asserted their sway upon her. By eleven o’clock the atmosphere
of concentration was running so strongly in one direction that
any thought of a different order could hardly have survived its
birth more than a moment or so. The task which lay before her
was to organize a series of entertainments, the profits of which
were to benefit the society, which drooped for want of funds.
It was her first attempt at organization on a large scale, and
she meant to achieve something remarkable. She meant to use the
cumbrous machine to pick out this, that, and the other interesting
person from the muddle of the world, and to set them for a week
in a pattern which must catch the eyes of Cabinet Ministers, and
the eyes once caught, the old arguments were to be delivered with
unexampled originality. Such was the scheme as a whole; and in
contemplation of it she would become quite flushed and excited,
and have to remind herself of all the details that intervened
between her and success.</p>

<p>The door would open, and Mr. Clacton would come in to search
for a certain leaflet buried beneath a pyramid of leaflets. He
was a thin, sandy-haired man of about thirty-five, spoke with
a Cockney accent, and had about him a frugal look, as if nature
had not dealt generously with him in any way, which, naturally,
prevented him from dealing generously with other people. When
he had found his leaflet, and offered a few jocular hints upon
keeping papers in order, the typewriting would stop abruptly,
and Mrs. Seal would burst into the room with a letter which needed
explanation in her hand. This was a more serious interruption
than the other, because she never knew exactly what she wanted,
and half a dozen requests would bolt from her, no one of which
was clearly stated. Dressed in plum-colored velveteen, with short,
gray hair, and a face that seemed permanently flushed with philanthropic
enthusiasm, she was always in a hurry, and always in some disorder.
She wore two crucifixes, which got themselves entangled in a heavy
gold chain upon her breast, and seemed to Mary expressive of her
mental ambiguity. Only her vast enthusiasm and her worship of
Miss Markham, one of the pioneers of the society, kept her in
her place, for which she had no sound qualification.</p>

<p>So the morning wore on, and the pile of letters grew, and Mary
felt, at last, that she was the center ganglion of a very fine
network of nerves which fell over England, and one of these days,
when she touched the heart of the system, would begin feeling
and rushing together and emitting their splendid blaze of revolutionary
fireworks&mdash;for some such metaphor represents what she felt about
her work, when her brain had been heated by three hours of application.</p>

<p>Shortly before one o’clock Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal desisted
from their labors, and the old joke about luncheon, which came
out regularly at this hour, was repeated with scarcely any variation
of words. Mr. Clacton patronized a vegetarian restaurant; Mrs.
Seal brought sandwiches, which she ate beneath the plane-trees
in Russell Square; while Mary generally went to a gaudy establishment,
upholstered in red plush, near by, where, much to the vegetarian’s
disapproval, you could buy steak, two inches thick, or a roast
section of fowl, swimming in a pewter dish.</p>

<p>"The bare branches against the sky do one so much <em>GOOD,"
</em>Mrs. Seal asserted, looking out into the Square.</p>

<p>"But one can’t lunch off trees, Sally," said Mary.</p>

<p>"I confess I don’t know how you manage it, Miss Datchet," Mr.
Clacton remarked. "I should sleep all the afternoon, I know, if
I took a heavy meal in the middle of the day."</p>

<p>"What’s the very latest thing in literature?" Mary asked, good-humoredly
pointing to the yellow-covered volume beneath Mr. Clacton’s arm,
for he invariably read some new French author at lunch-time, or
squeezed in a visit to a picture gallery, balancing his social
work with an ardent culture of which he was secretly proud, as
Mary had very soon divined.</p>

<p>So they parted and Mary walked away, wondering if they guessed
that she really wanted to get away from them, and supposing that
they had not quite reached that degree of subtlety. She bought
herself an evening paper, which she read as she ate, looking over
the top of it again and again at the queer people who were buying
cakes or imparting their secrets, until some young woman whom
she knew came in, and she called out, "Eleanor, come and sit by
me," and they finished their lunch together, parting on the strip
of pavement among the different lines of traffic with a pleasant
feeling that they were stepping once more into their separate
places in the great and eternally moving pattern of human life.</p>

<p>But, instead of going straight back to the office to-day, Mary
turned into the British Museum, and strolled down the gallery
with the shapes of stone until she found an empty seat directly
beneath the gaze of the Elgin marbles. She looked at them, and
seemed, as usual, borne up on some wave of exaltation and emotion,
by which her life at once became solemn and beautiful&mdash;an impression
which was due as much, perhaps, to the solitude and chill and
silence of the gallery as to the actual beauty of the statues.
One must suppose, at least, that her emotions were not purely
esthetic, because, after she had gazed at the Ulysses for a minute
or two, she began to think about Ralph Denham. So secure did she
feel with these silent shapes that she almost yielded to an impulse
to say "I am in love with you" aloud. The presence of this immense
and enduring beauty made her almost alarmingly conscious of her
desire, and at the same time proud of a feeling which did not
display anything like the same proportions when she was going
about her daily work.</p>

<p>She repressed her impulse to speak aloud, and rose and wandered
about rather aimlessly among the statues until she found herself
in another gallery devoted to engraved obelisks and winged Assyrian
bulls, and her emotion took another turn. She began to picture
herself traveling with Ralph in a land where these monsters were
couchant in the sand. "For,"  she thought to herself, as she gazed
fixedly at some information printed behind a piece of glass, "the
wonderful thing about you is that you’re ready for anything; you’re
not in the least conventional, like most clever men."</p>

<p>And she conjured up a scene of herself on a camel’s back, in
the desert, while Ralph commanded a whole tribe of natives.</p>

<p>"That is what you can do," she went on, moving on to the next
statue. "You always make people do what you want."</p>

<p>A glow spread over her spirit, and filled her eyes with brightness.
Nevertheless, before she left the Museum she was very far from
saying, even in the privacy of her own mind, "I am in love with
you," and that sentence might very well never have framed itself.
She was, indeed, rather annoyed with herself for having allowed
such an ill-considered breach of her reserve, weakening her powers
of resistance, she felt, should this impulse return again. For,
as she walked along the street to her office, the force of all
her customary objections to being in love with any one overcame
her. She did not want to marry at all. It seemed to her that there
was something amateurish in bringing love into touch with a perfectly
straightforward friendship, such as hers was with Ralph, which,
for two years now, had based itself upon common interests in impersonal
topics, such as the housing of the poor, or the taxation of land
values.</p>

<p>But the afternoon spirit differed intrinsically from the morning
spirit. Mary found herself watching the flight of a bird, or making
drawings of the branches of the plane-trees upon her blotting-paper.
People came in to see Mr. Clacton on business, and a seductive
smell of cigarette smoke issued from his room. Mrs. Seal wandered
about with newspaper cuttings, which seemed to her either "quite
splendid" or "really too bad for words." She used to paste these
into books, or send them to her friends, having first drawn a
broad bar in blue pencil down the margin, a proceeding which signified
equally and indistinguishably the depths of her reprobation or
the heights of her approval.</p>

<p>About four o’clock on that same afternoon Katharine Hilbery was
walking up Kingsway. The question of tea presented itself. The
street lamps were being lit already, and as she stood still for
a moment beneath one of them, she tried to think of some neighboring
drawing-room where there would be firelight and talk congenial
to her mood. That mood, owing to the spinning traffic and the
evening veil of unreality, was ill-adapted to her home surroundings.
Perhaps, on the whole, a shop was the best place in which to preserve
this queer sense of heightened existence. At the same time she
wished to talk. Remembering Mary Datchet and her repeated invitations,
she crossed the road, turned into Russell Square, and peered about,
seeking for numbers with a sense of adventure that was out of
all proportion to the deed itself. She found herself in a dimly
lighted hall, unguarded by a porter, and pushed open the first
swing door. But the office-boy had never heard of Miss Datchet.
Did she belong to the <em>S.R.F.R.? </em>Katharine shook her head
with a smile of dismay. A voice from within shouted, "No. The
<em>S.G.S.&mdash;</em>top floor."</p>

<p>Katharine mounted past innumerable glass doors, with initials
on them, and became steadily more and more doubtful of the wisdom
of her venture. At the top she paused for a moment to breathe
and collect herself. She heard the typewriter and formal professional
voices inside, not belonging, she thought, to any one she had
ever spoken to. She touched the bell, and the door was opened
almost immediately by Mary herself. Her face had to change its
expression entirely when she saw Katharine.</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed. "We thought you were the printer." Still
holding the door open, she called back, "No, Mr. Clacton, it’s
not Penningtons. I should ring them up again&mdash;double three double
eight, Central. Well, this is a surprise. Come in," she added.
"You’re just in time for tea."</p>

<p>The light of relief shone in Mary’s eyes. The boredom of the
afternoon was dissipated at once, and she was glad that Katharine
had found them in a momentary press of activity, owing to the
failure of the printer to send back certain proofs.</p>

<p>The unshaded electric light shining upon the table covered with
papers dazed Katharine for a moment. After the confusion of her
twilight walk, and her random thoughts, life in this small room
appeared extremely concentrated and bright. She turned instinctively
to look out of the window, which was uncurtained, but Mary immediately
recalled her.</p>

<p>"It was very clever of you to find your way," she said, and Katharine
wondered, as she stood there, feeling, for the moment, entirely
detached and unabsorbed, why she had come. She looked, indeed,
to Mary’s eyes strangely out of place in the office. Her figure
in the long cloak, which took deep folds, and her face, which
was composed into a mask of sensitive apprehension, disturbed
Mary for a moment with a sense of the presence of some one who
was of another world, and, therefore, subversive of her world.
She became immediately anxious that Katharine should be impressed
by the importance of her world, and hoped that neither Mrs. Seal
nor Mr. Clacton would appear until the impression of importance
had been received. But in this she was disappointed. Mrs. Seal
burst into the room holding a kettle in her hand, which she set
upon the stove, and then, with inefficient haste, she set light
to the gas, which flared up, exploded, and went out.</p>

<p>"Always the way, always the way," she muttered. "Kit Markham
is the only person who knows how to deal with the thing."</p>

<p>Mary had to go to her help, and together they spread the table,
and apologized for the disparity between the cups and the plainness
of the food.</p>

<p>"If we had known Miss Hilbery was coming, we should have bought
a cake,"  said Mary, upon which Mrs. Seal looked at Katharine
for the first time, suspiciously, because she was a person who
needed cake.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Clacton opened the door, and came in, holding a typewritten
letter in his hand, which he was reading aloud.</p>

<p>"Salford’s affiliated," he said.</p>

<p>"Well done, Salford!" Mrs. Seal exclaimed enthusiastically, thumping
the teapot which she held upon the table, in token of applause.</p>

<p>"Yes, these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at
last,"  said Mr. Clacton, and then Mary introduced him to Miss
Hilbery, and he asked her, in a very formal manner, if she were
interested "in our work."</p>

<p>"And the proofs still not come?" said Mrs. Seal, putting both
her elbows on the table, and propping her chin on her hands, as
Mary began to pour out tea. "It’s too bad&mdash;too bad. At this rate
we shall miss the country post. Which reminds me, Mr. Clacton,
don’t you think we should circularize the provinces with Partridge’s
last speech? What? You’ve not read it? Oh, it’s the best thing
they’ve had in the House this Session. Even the Prime Minister&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mary cut her short.</p>

<p>"We don’t allow shop at tea, Sally," she said firmly. "We fine
her a penny each time she forgets, and the fines go to buying
a plum cake,"  she explained, seeking to draw Katharine into the
community. She had given up all hope of impressing her.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry, I’m sorry," Mrs. Seal apologized. "It’s my misfortune
to be an enthusiast," she said, turning to Katharine. "My father’s
daughter could hardly be anything else. I think I’ve been on as
many committees as most people. Waifs and Strays, Rescue Work,
Church Work, C. O. <em>S.&mdash;</em>local branch&mdash;besides the usual
civic duties which fall to one as a householder. But I’ve given
them all up for our work here, and I don’t regret it for a second,"
she added. "This is the root question, I feel; until women have
votes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It’ll be sixpence, at least, Sally," said Mary, bringing her
fist down on the table. "And we’re all sick to death of women
and their votes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Seal looked for a moment as though she could hardly believe
her ears, and made a deprecating "tut-tut-tut" in her throat,
looking alternately at Katharine and Mary, and shaking her head
as she did so. Then she remarked, rather confidentially to Katharine,
with a little nod in Mary’s direction:</p>

<p>"She’s doing more for the cause than any of us. She’s giving
her youth&mdash;for, alas! when I was young there were domestic circumstances&mdash;" 
she sighed, and stopped short.</p>

<p>Mr. Clacton hastily reverted to the joke about luncheon, and
explained how Mrs. Seal fed on a bag of biscuits under the trees,
whatever the weather might be, rather, Katharine thought, as though
Mrs. Seal were a pet dog who had convenient tricks.</p>

<p>"Yes, I took my little bag into the square," said Mrs. Seal,
with the self-conscious guilt of a child owning some fault to
its elders. "It was really very sustaining, and the bare boughs
against the sky do one so much <em>GOOD. </em>But I shall have
to give up going into the square," she proceeded, wrinkling her
forehead. "The injustice of it! Why should I have a beautiful
square all to myself, when poor women who need rest have nowhere
at all to sit?" She looked fiercely at Katharine, giving her short
locks a little shake. "It’s dreadful what a tyrant one still is,
in spite of all one’s efforts. One tries to lead a decent life,
but one can’t. Of course, directly one thinks of it, one sees
that <em>ALL </em>squares should be open to <em>EVERY ONE. </em>Is
there any society with that object, Mr. Clacton? If not, there
should be, surely."</p>

<p>"A most excellent object," said Mr. Clacton in his professional
manner. "At the same time, one must deplore the ramification of
organizations, Mrs. Seal. So much excellent effort thrown away,
not to speak of pounds, shillings, and pence. Now how many organizations
of a philanthropic nature do you suppose there are in the City
of London itself, Miss Hilbery?" he added, screwing his mouth
into a queer little smile, as if to show that the question had
its frivolous side.</p>

<p>Katharine smiled, too. Her unlikeness to the rest of them had,
by this time, penetrated to Mr. Clacton, who was not naturally
observant, and he was wondering who she was; this same unlikeness
had subtly stimulated Mrs. Seal to try and make a convert of her.
Mary, too, looked at her almost as if she begged her to make things
easy. For Katharine had shown no disposition to make things easy.
She had scarcely spoken, and her silence, though grave and even
thoughtful, seemed to Mary the silence of one who criticizes.</p>

<p>"Well, there are more in this house than I’d any notion of,"
she said. "On the ground floor you protect natives, on the next
you emigrate women and tell people to eat nuts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that ‘we’ do these things?" Mary interposed,
rather sharply. "We’re not responsible for all the cranks who
choose to lodge in the same house with us."</p>

<p>Mr. Clacton cleared his throat and looked at each of the young
ladies in turn. He was a good deal struck by the appearance and
manner of Miss Hilbery, which seemed to him to place her among
those cultivated and luxurious people of whom he used to dream.
Mary, on the other hand, was more of his own sort, and a little
too much inclined to order him about. He picked up crumbs of dry
biscuit and put them into his mouth with incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>"You don’t belong to our society, then?" said Mrs. Seal.</p>

<p>"No, I’m afraid I don’t," said Katharine, with such ready candor
that Mrs. Seal was nonplussed, and stared at her with a puzzled
expression, as if she could not classify her among the varieties
of human beings known to her.</p>

<p>"But surely," she began.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters," said Mr. Clacton,
almost apologetically. "We have to remind her sometimes that others
have a right to their views even if they differ from our own....
"Punch" has a very funny picture this week, about a Suffragist
and an agricultural laborer. Have you seen this week’s "Punch,"
Miss Datchet?"</p>

<p>Mary laughed, and said "No."</p>

<p>Mr. Clacton then told them the substance of the joke, which,
however, depended a good deal for its success upon the expression
which the artist had put into the people’s faces. Mrs. Seal sat
all the time perfectly grave. Directly he had done speaking she
burst out:</p>

<p>"But surely, if you care about the welfare of your sex at all,
you must wish them to have the vote?"</p>

<p>"I never said I didn’t wish them to have the vote," Katharine
protested.</p>

<p>"Then why aren’t you a member of our society?" Mrs. Seal demanded.</p>

<p>Katharine stirred her spoon round and round, stared into the
swirl of the tea, and remained silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile,
framed a question which, after a moment’s hesitation, he put to
Katharine.</p>

<p>"Are you in any way related, I wonder, to the poet Alardyce?
His daughter, I believe, married a Mr. Hilbery."</p>

<p>"Yes; I’m the poet’s granddaughter," said Katharine, with a little
sigh, after a pause; and for a moment they were all silent.</p>

<p>"The poet’s granddaughter!" Mrs. Seal repeated, half to herself,
with a shake of her head, as if that explained what was otherwise
inexplicable.</p>

<p>The light kindled in Mr. Clacton’s eye.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed. That interests me very much," he said. "I owe a
great debt to your grandfather, Miss Hilbery. At one time I could
have repeated the greater part of him by heart. But one gets out
of the way of reading poetry, unfortunately. You don’t remember
him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>A sharp rap at the door made Katharine’s answer inaudible. Mrs.
Seal looked up with renewed hope in her eyes, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>"The proofs at last!" ran to open the door. "Oh, it’s only Mr.
Denham!"  she cried, without any attempt to conceal her disappointment.
Ralph, Katharine supposed, was a frequent visitor, for the only
person he thought it necessary to greet was herself, and Mary
at once explained the strange fact of her being there by saying:</p>

<p>"Katharine has come to see how one runs an office."</p>

<p>Ralph felt himself stiffen uncomfortably, as he said:</p>

<p>"I hope Mary hasn’t persuaded you that she knows how to run an
office?"</p>

<p>"What, doesn’t she?" said Katharine, looking from one to the
other.</p>

<p>At these remarks Mrs. Seal began to exhibit signs of discomposure,
which displayed themselves by a tossing movement of her head,
and, as Ralph took a letter from his pocket, and placed his finger
upon a certain sentence, she forestalled him by exclaiming in
confusion:</p>

<p>"Now, I know what you’re going to say, Mr. Denham! But it was
the day Kit Markham was here, and she upsets one so&mdash;with her
wonderful vitality, always thinking of something new that we ought
to be doing and aren’t&mdash;and I was conscious at the time that my
dates were mixed. It had nothing to do with Mary at all, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"My dear Sally, don’t apologize," said Mary, laughing. "Men are
such pedants&mdash;they don’t know what things matter, and what things
don’t."</p>

<p>"Now, Denham, speak up for our sex," said Mr. Clacton in a jocular
manner, indeed, but like most insignificant men he was very quick
to resent being found fault with by a woman, in argument with
whom he was fond of calling himself "a mere man." He wished, however,
to enter into a literary conservation with Miss Hilbery, and thus
let the matter drop.</p>

<p>"Doesn’t it seem strange to you, Miss Hilbery," he said, "that
the French, with all their wealth of illustrious names, have no
poet who can compare with your grandfather? Let me see. There’s
Chenier and Hugo and Alfred de Musset&mdash;wonderful men, but, at
the same time, there’s a richness, a freshness about Alardyce&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the telephone bell rang, and he had to absent himself with
a smile and a bow which signified that, although literature is
delightful, it is not work. Mrs. Seal rose at the same time, but
remained hovering over the table, delivering herself of a tirade
against party government. "For if I were to tell you what I know
of back-stairs intrigue, and what can be done by the power of
the purse, you wouldn’t credit me, Mr. Denham, you wouldn’t, indeed.
Which is why I feel that the only work for my father’s daughter&mdash;for
he was one of the pioneers, Mr. Denham, and on his tombstone I
had that verse from the Psalms put, about the sowers and the seed....
And what wouldn’t I give that he should be alive now, seeing what
we’re going to see&mdash;" but reflecting that the glories of the future
depended in part upon the activity of her typewriter, she bobbed
her head, and hurried back to the seclusion of her little room,
from which immediately issued sounds of enthusiastic, but obviously
erratic, composition.</p>

<p>Mary made it clear at once, by starting a fresh topic of general
interest, that though she saw the humor of her colleague, she
did not intend to have her laughed at.</p>

<p>"The standard of morality seems to me frightfully low," she observed
reflectively, pouring out a second cup of tea, "especially among
women who aren’t well educated. They don’t see that small things
matter, and that’s where the leakage begins, and then we find
ourselves in difficulties &mdash;I very nearly lost my temper
yesterday," she went on, looking at Ralph with a little smile,
as though he knew what happened when she lost her temper. "It
makes me very angry when people tell me lies&mdash;doesn’t it make
you angry?" she asked Katharine.</p>

<p>"But considering that every one tells lies," Katharine remarked,
looking about the room to see where she had put down her umbrella
and her parcel, for there was an intimacy in the way in which
Mary and Ralph addressed each other which made her wish to leave
them. Mary, on the other hand, was anxious, superficially at least,
that Katharine should stay and so fortify her in her determination
not to be in love with Ralph.</p>

<p>Ralph, while lifting his cup from his lips to the table, had
made up his mind that if Miss Hilbery left, he would go with her.</p>

<p>"I don’t think that I tell lies, and I don’t think that Ralph
tells lies, do you, Ralph?" Mary continued.</p>

<p>Katharine laughed, with more gayety, as it seemed to Mary, than
she could properly account for. What was she laughing at? At them,
presumably. Katharine had risen, and was glancing hither and thither,
at the presses and the cupboards, and all the machinery of the
office, as if she included them all in her rather malicious amusement,
which caused Mary to keep her eyes on her straightly and rather
fiercely, as if she were a gay-plumed, mischievous bird, who might
light on the topmost bough and pick off the ruddiest cherry, without
any warning. Two women less like each other could scarcely be
imagined, Ralph thought, looking from one to the other. Next moment,
he too, rose, and nodding to Mary, as Katharine said good-bye,
opened the door for her, and followed her out.</p>

<p>Mary sat still and made no attempt to prevent them from going.
For a second or two after the door had shut on them her eyes rested
on the door with a straightforward fierceness in which, for a
moment, a certain degree of bewilderment seemed to enter; but,
after a brief hesitation, she put down her cup and proceeded to
clear away the tea-things.</p>

<p>The impulse which had driven Ralph to take this action was the
result of a very swift little piece of reasoning, and thus, perhaps,
was not quite so much of an impulse as it seemed. It passed through
his mind that if he missed this chance of talking to Katharine,
he would have to face an enraged ghost, when he was alone in his
room again, demanding an explanation of his cowardly indecision.
It was better, on the whole, to risk present discomfiture than
to waste an evening bandying excuses and constructing impossible
scenes with this uncompromising section of himself. For ever since
he had visited the Hilberys he had been much at the mercy of a
phantom Katharine, who came to him when he sat alone, and answered
him as he would have her answer, and was always beside him to
crown those varying triumphs which were transacted almost every
night, in imaginary scenes, as he walked through the lamplit streets
home from the office. To walk with Katharine in the flesh would
either feed that phantom with fresh food, which, as all who nourish
dreams are aware, is a process that becomes necessary from time
to time, or refine it to such a degree of thinness that it was
scarcely serviceable any longer; and that, too, is sometimes a
welcome change to a dreamer. And all the time Ralph was well aware
that the bulk of Katharine was not represented in his dreams at
all, so that when he met her he was bewildered by the fact that
she had nothing to do with his dream of her.</p>

<p>When, on reaching the street, Katharine found that Mr. Denham
proceeded to keep pace by her side, she was surprised and, perhaps,
a little annoyed. She, too, had her margin of imagination, and
to-night her activity in this obscure region of the mind required
solitude. If she had had her way, she would have walked very fast
down the Tottenham Court Road, and then sprung into a cab and
raced swiftly home. The view she had had of the inside of an office
was of the nature of a dream to her. Shut off up there, she compared
Mrs. Seal, and Mary Datchet, and Mr. Clacton to enchanted people
in a bewitched tower, with the spiders’ webs looping across the
corners of the room, and all the tools of the necromancer’s craft
at hand; for so aloof and unreal and apart from the normal world
did they seem to her, in the house of innumerable typewriters,
murmuring their incantations and concocting their drugs, and flinging
their frail spiders’ webs over the torrent of life which rushed
down the streets outside.</p>

<p>She may have been conscious that there was some exaggeration
in this fancy of hers, for she certainly did not wish to share
it with Ralph. To him, she supposed, Mary Datchet, composing leaflets
for Cabinet Ministers among her typewriters, represented all that
was interesting and genuine; and, accordingly, she shut them both
out from all share in the crowded street, with its pendant necklace
of lamps, its lighted windows, and its throng of men and women,
which exhilarated her to such an extent that she very nearly forgot
her companion. She walked very fast, and the effect of people
passing in the opposite direction was to produce a queer dizziness
both in her head and in Ralph’s, which set their bodies far apart.
But she did her duty by her companion almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Mary Datchet does that sort of work very well.... She’s responsible
for it, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The others don’t help at all.... Has she made a convert
of you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. That is, I’m a convert already."</p>

<p>"But she hasn’t persuaded you to work for them?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear no&mdash;that wouldn’t do at all."</p>

<p>So they walked on down the Tottenham Court Road, parting and
coming together again, and Ralph felt much as though he were addressing
the summit of a poplar in a high gale of wind.</p>

<p>"Suppose we get on to that omnibus?" he suggested.</p>

<p>Katharine acquiesced, and they climbed up, and found themselves
alone on top of it.</p>

<p>"But which way are you going?" Katharine asked, waking a little
from the trance into which movement among moving things had thrown
her.</p>

<p>"I’m going to the Temple," Ralph replied, inventing a destination
on the spur of the moment. He felt the change come over her as
they sat down and the omnibus began to move forward. He imagined
her contemplating the avenue in front of them with those honest
sad eyes which seemed to set him at such a distance from them.
But the breeze was blowing in their faces; it lifted her hat for
a second, and she drew out a pin and stuck it in again,&mdash;a little
action which seemed, for some reason, to make her rather more
fallible. Ah, if only her hat would blow off, and leave her altogether
disheveled, accepting it from his hands!</p>

<p>"This is like Venice," she observed, raising her hand. "The motor-cars,
I mean, shooting about so quickly, with their lights."</p>

<p>"I’ve never seen Venice," he replied. "I keep that and some other
things for my old age."</p>

<p>"What are the other things?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There’s Venice and India and, I think, Dante, too."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Think of providing for one’s old age! And would you refuse to
see Venice if you had the chance?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering her, he wondered whether he should tell
her something that was quite true about himself; and as he wondered,
he told her.</p>

<p>"I’ve planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child,
to make it last longer. You see, I’m always afraid that I’m missing
something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so am I!" Katharine exclaimed. "But, after all," she added,
"why should you miss anything?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I’m poor, for one thing," Ralph rejoined. "You,
I suppose, can have Venice and India and Dante every day of your
life."</p>

<p>She said nothing for a moment, but rested one hand, which was
bare of glove, upon the rail in front of her, meditating upon
a variety of things, of which one was that this strange young
man pronounced Dante as she was used to hearing it pronounced,
and another, that he had, most unexpectedly, a feeling about life
that was familiar to her. Perhaps, then, he was the sort of person
she might take an interest in, if she came to know him better,
and as she had placed him among those whom she would never want
to know better, this was enough to make her silent. She hastily
recalled her first view of him, in the little room where the relics
were kept, and ran a bar through half her impressions, as one
cancels a badly written sentence, having found the right one.</p>

<p>"But to know that one might have things doesn’t alter the fact
that one hasn’t got them," she said, in some confusion. "How could
I go to India, for example? Besides," she began impulsively, and
stopped herself. Here the conductor came round, and interrupted
them. Ralph waited for her to resume her sentence, but she said
no more.</p>

<p>"I have a message to give your father," he remarked. "Perhaps
you would give it him, or I could come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, do come," Katharine replied.</p>

<p>"Still, I don’t see why you shouldn’t go to India," Ralph began,
in order to keep her from rising, as she threatened to do.</p>

<p>But she got up in spite of him, and said good-bye with her usual
air of decision, and left him with a quickness which Ralph connected
now with all her movements. He looked down and saw her standing
on the pavement edge, an alert, commanding figure, which waited
its season to cross, and then walked boldly and swiftly to the
other side. That gesture and action would be added to the picture
he had of her, but at present the real woman completely routed
the phantom one.</p>
