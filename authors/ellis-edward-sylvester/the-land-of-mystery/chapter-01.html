<p>The blood-red sun was sinking beyond the distant Geral Mountains,
when a canoe, containing four white men and three natives, came
to a halt a thousand miles from the mighty Amazon, in the upper
waters of the Xingu River, near the great table-land of Matto
Grosso.</p>

<p>It was hard work, forcing the long shallow boat against the rapid
current of the stream, whose unknown source is somewhere among
the famous diamond regions of Brazil.  It was plain sailing for
three hundred leagues from the Amazon, from whose majestic volume
the little party of explorers had turned southward more than a
month before.  The broad sail, which was erected in the centre
of the craft, swept it smoothly along over the narrowing bosom
of the Xingu, between luxuriant forests and past tribes of strange-looking
Indians, who stood on the banks staring wonderingly at the extraordinary
beings, the like of which many of them had never seen before.</p>

<p>Occasionally the explorers put ashore, and, using only the language
of signs, exchanged some of the beads and gaudy trinkets for the
curious articles of the savages.  Endless varieties of fruit were
so abundant that it was to be had for the simple trouble of plucking;
while the timid natives stood in such awe of their visitors, that
the thought of harming them never entered their minds.</p>

<p>But ominous changes were gradually noted by our friends, as they
steadily ascended the mysterious stream.  At first the natives
fled at their approach, and failed to understand the signs of
comity, or were so distrustful of the strangers that they refused
to meet their advances.  Fleeing into the woods or high hills,
they peeped out from their coverts, uttering strange cries and
indulging in grotesque gestures, the meaning of which could hardly
be mistaken.  Had there been any misapprehension on the part of
the visitors, there was none after several scores launched their
arrows at the boat, as it glided away from the shore and up stream. 
The aim was wild and no one was struck, but when Professor Ernest
Grimcke, the sturdy, blue-eyed scientist of the party, picked
up one of the missiles and carefully examined it, he made the
disturbing announcement that it was tipped with one of the deadliest
of known poisons.</p>

<p>The other members of this exploring party were Fred Ashman, a
bright, intelligent American, four-and-twenty years of age; Jared
Long, an attenuated, muscular New Englander in middle life, and
Aaron Johnston, a grim, reserved but powerful sailor from New
Bedford, who had spent most of his life on whaling voyages.  Professor
Grimcke and Ashman were joint partners in the exploring enterprise,
Long and Johnston being their assistants.</p>

<p>In addition, there were three native servants, or helpers, known
as Bippo, Pedros and Quincal.  They had been engaged at Macapa,
near the mouth of the Amazon.  They were rather small of size,
the first-named being the most intelligent, and in that warm,
tropical climate wore no clothing except a strip of native cloth
around the loins.  Ashman had striven to teach them the use of
firearms, but they could never overcome the terror caused by the
jet of fire and the thunderous explosion when the things were
discharged.  They, therefore, clung to their spears, which, having
honest points, cannot be said to have been very formidable weapons
in their hands, even though each native was able to throw them
with remarkable deftness and accuracy.</p>

<p>The sail that had served the explorers so well, where the Xingu
was broader and with a slower current, became useless, or at least
proved unequal to the task of overcoming the force of the stream.
Consequently they had recourse to the broad-bladed oars, with
which they drove the canoe swiftly against the resisting river,
cheered by the oft-repeated declaration of the Professor, whose
spirits never flagged, that the harder it proved going up stream,
the easier must it be in descending, and that the arrangement
was much better than if the condition of affairs were reversed.</p>

<p>The most tiresome work came when they reached some place, where
the falls or rapids compelled them to land, and, lifting the boat
and its contents from the ground, carry it round the obstruction
to the more favorable current above.  These portages varied in
length from a few rods to a fourth of a mile, and the further
the party advanced, the more frequent did they become.</p>

<p>"We have gone far enough for to-night," said the Professor, as
the prow of the boat was turned toward the left bank; "we will
go into camp and make ready for to-morrow."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the bow of the canoe gently touched the
dark sand of the shore.  Bippo, Pedros and Quincal understood
their duty so well that, without suggestion from the others, they
leaped into the shallow waters, ran a few steps, and, grasping
the front of the craft, drew it so far upon the land that the
others stepped out without so much as wetting the soles of their
shoes.</p>

<p>This task was no more than finished, when the natives scattered
in the forest, which came almost to the edge of the water, in
quest of fuel. This of course was so abundant that the work was
slight, but since Professor Grimcke and Fred Ashman paid them
well for their services they were left to attend to that duty
unassisted.</p>

<p>As the surroundings of the party were entirely new and strange,
Grimcke proposed that while the evening meal was being prepared,
they should find out, if it could be done, whether any unwelcome
neighbors were likely to disturb them before morning.  After a
brief consultation, it was decided that the Professor and Jared
Long should make their way up the river, keeping close to shore,
with the purpose of learning the extent of the rapids, while Ashman
and the sailor, Johnston, should follow the clearly marked trail
which led directly away from the stream and into the forest. 
It was more than probable that one of the couples would come upon
something worth knowing, and it was not unlikely that both would
return with important information.</p>

<p>Twilight is of short duration in the low latitudes, and the wish
of the four white men was to be back in camp at the end of an
hour, by which time night would be fairly upon them.  But the
moon was at its full and would serve them better than the twilight
itself.</p>

<p>The German and New Englander, therefore, moved away from camp,
following the course of the Xingu, while their two friends quickly
vanished in the forest.  Each carried his repeating Winchester
and his Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>

<p>Ashman felt some misgiving because of the trail leading into
the woods from a point so near the camp.  It seemed likely to
have been worn by the inhabitants of some village near at hand,
though it was possible that the innumerable feet of wild animals
on their way to and from the river may have been the cause.  The
upper waters of the Xingu are remarkably clear and pure, a fact
which rendered the first theory most probable.</p>

<p>The explorers had landed in a dangerous region, as they were
destined to learn very soon, and the experience of the couples
who took routes at right angles to each other was of the most
thrilling character.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the progress of the canoe had been checked,
as was often the case before, by the rapids of the Xingu, which
could be passed only by carrying the canoe and luggage to the
smoother waters above.  It was apparent that the river frequently
overflowed its banks, for immense quantities of driftwood lined
both shores, while the vegetation had been swept away to that
extent that a space of a dozen feet from the margin of the stream
was comparatively free from it. Thus both parties found the travelling
easy.</p>

<p>The rapids were a hundred yards wide, more or less, and, with
such a steep incline, that the foamy waves dashed hither and thither
and against each other with the utmost fury, sending the spray
high in air and sweeping forward with such impetuosity that it
seemed impossible for the strongest craft under the most skilful
guidance to shoot them. The explorers studied them with great
interest as they ascended the left bank.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that in a country with such excessive vegetable
growth, every part of the Xingu should show much floating timber. 
The logs which plunged through the rapids played all manner of
antics. Sometimes they leaped high out of the waters, like immense
sea monsters, the out-spreading limbs showing a startling resemblance
to the arms of a drowning person mutely appealing for help.  Then
a heavy trunk would strike a rock just below the surface, and
the branches, dripping with spray, swept over in a huge semi-circle. 
The roar and swirl suggested the whirlpool below the falls of
Niagara, one of the most appalling sights in all nature.</p>
