<P>It was about midnight when poor Van Baerle was locked up in 
the prison of the Buytenhof.</P>
<P>What Rosa foresaw had come to pass. On finding the cell of 
Cornelius de Witt empty, the wrath of the people ran very 
high, and had Gryphus fallen into the hands of those madmen 
he would certainly have had to pay with his life for the 
prisoner.</P>
<P>But this fury had vented itself most fully on the two 
brothers when they were overtaken by the murderers, thanks 
to the precaution which William  -  the man of precautions  -  
had taken in having the gates of the city closed.</P>
<P>A momentary lull had therefore set in whilst the prison was 
empty, and Rosa availed herself of this favourable moment to 
come forth from her hiding place, which she also induced her 
father to leave.</P>
<P>The prison was therefore completely deserted. Why should 
people remain in the jail whilst murder was going on at the 
Tol-Hek?</P>
<P>Gryphus came forth trembling behind the courageous Rosa. 
They went to close the great gate, at least as well as it 
would close, considering that it was half demolished. It was 
easy to see that a hurricane of mighty fury had vented 
itself upon it.</P>
<P>About four o'clock a return of the noise was heard, but of 
no threatening character to Gryphus and his daughter. The 
people were only dragging in the two corpses, which they 
came back to gibbet at the usual place of execution.</P>
<P>Rosa hid herself this time also, but only that she might not 
see the ghastly spectacle.</P>
<P>At midnight, people again knocked at the gate of the jail, 
or rather at the barricade which served in its stead: it was 
Cornelius van Baerle whom they were bringing.</P>
<P>When the jailer received this new inmate, and saw from the 
warrant the name and station of his prisoner, he muttered 
with his turnkey smile,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Godson of Cornelius de Witt! Well, young man, we have the 
family cell here, and we will give it to you.&quot;</P>
<P>And quite enchanted with his joke, the ferocious Orangeman 
took his cresset and his keys to conduct Cornelius to the 
cell, which on that very morning Cornelius de Witt had left 
to go into exile, or what in revolutionary times is meant 
instead by those sublime philosophers who lay it down as an 
axiom of high policy, &quot;It is the dead only who do not 
return.&quot;</P>
<P>On the way which the despairing florist had to traverse to 
reach that cell he heard nothing but the barking of a dog, 
and saw nothing but the face of a young girl.</P>
<P>The dog rushed forth from a niche in the wall, shaking his 
heavy chain, and sniffing all round Cornelius in order so 
much the better to recognise him in case he should be 
ordered to pounce upon him.</P>
<P>The young girl, whilst the prisoner was mounting the 
staircase, appeared at the narrow door of her chamber, which 
opened on that very flight of steps; and, holding the lamp 
in her right hand, she at the same time lit up her pretty 
blooming face, surrounded by a profusion of rich wavy golden 
locks, whilst with her left she held her white night-dress 
closely over her breast, having been roused from her first 
slumber by the unexpected arrival of Van Baerle.</P>
<P>It would have made a fine picture, worthy of Rembrandt, the 
gloomy winding stairs illuminated by the reddish glare of 
the cresset of Gryphus, with his scowling jailer's 
countenance at the top, the melancholy figure of Cornelius 
bending over the banister to look down upon the sweet face 
of Rosa, standing, as it were, in the bright frame of the 
door of her chamber, with embarrassed mien at being thus 
seen by a stranger.</P>
<P>And at the bottom, quite in the shade, where the details are 
absorbed in the obscurity, the mastiff, with his eyes 
glistening like carbuncles, and shaking his chain, on which 
the double light from the lamp of Rosa and the lantern of 
Gryphus threw a brilliant glitter.</P>
<P>The sublime master would, however, have been altogether 
unable to render the sorrow expressed in the face of Rosa, 
when she saw this pale, handsome young man slowly climbing 
the stairs, and thought of the full import of the words, 
which her father had just spoken, &quot;You will have the family 
cell.&quot;</P>
<P>This vision lasted but a moment,  -  much less time than we 
have taken to describe it. Gryphus then proceeded on his 
way, Cornelius was forced to follow him, and five minutes 
afterwards he entered his prison, of which it is unnecessary 
to say more, as the reader is already acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Gryphus pointed with his finger to the bed on which the 
martyr had suffered so much, who on that day had rendered 
his soul to God. Then, taking up his cresset, he quitted the 
cell.</P>
<P>Thus left alone, Cornelius threw himself on his bed, but he 
slept not, he kept his eye fixed on the narrow window, 
barred with iron, which looked on the Buytenhof; and in this 
way saw from behind the trees that first pale beam of light 
which morning sheds on the earth as a white mantle.</P>
<P>Now and then during the night horses had galloped at a smart 
pace over the Buytenhof, the heavy tramp of the patrols had 
resounded from the pavement, and the slow matches of the 
arquebuses, flaring in the east wind, had thrown up at 
intervals a sudden glare as far as to the panes of his 
window.</P>
<P>But when the rising sun began to gild the coping stones at 
the gable ends of the houses, Cornelius, eager to know 
whether there was any living creature about him, approached 
the window, and cast a sad look round the circular yard 
before him</P>
<P>At the end of the yard a dark mass, tinted with a dingy blue 
by the morning dawn, rose before him, its dark outlines 
standing out in contrast to the houses already illuminated 
by the pale light of early morning.</P>
<P>Cornelius recognised the gibbet.</P>
<P>On it were suspended two shapeless trunks, which indeed were 
no more than bleeding skeletons.</P>
<P>The good people of the Hague had chopped off the flesh of 
its victims, but faithfully carried the remainder to the 
gibbet, to have a pretext for a double inscription written 
on a huge placard, on which Cornelius; with the keen sight 
of a young man of twenty-eight, was able to read the 
following lines, daubed by the coarse brush of a 
sign-painter:  - </P>
<P>&quot;Here are hanging the great rogue of the name of John de 
Witt, and the little rogue Cornelius de Witt, his brother, 
two enemies of the people, but great friends of the king of 
France.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius uttered a cry of horror, and in the agony of his 
frantic terror knocked with his hands and feet at the door 
so violently and continuously, that Gryphus, with his huge 
bunch of keys in his hand, ran furiously up.</P>
<P>The jailer opened the door, with terrible imprecations 
against the prisoner who disturbed him at an hour which 
Master Gryphus was not accustomed to be aroused.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, now, by my soul, he is mad, this new De Witt,&quot; he 
cried, &quot;but all those De Witts have the devil in them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Master, master,&quot; cried Cornelius, seizing the jailer by the 
arm and dragging him towards the window,  -  &quot;master, what 
have I read down there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where down there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On that placard.&quot;</P>
<P>And, trembling, pale, and gasping for breath, he pointed to 
the gibbet at the other side of the yard, with the cynical 
inscription surmounting it.</P>
<P>Gryphus broke out into a laugh.</P>
<P>&quot;Eh! eh!&quot; he answered, &quot;so, you have read it. Well, my good 
sir, that's what people will get for corresponding with the 
enemies of his Highness the Prince of Orange.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The brothers De Witt are murdered!&quot; Cornelius muttered, 
with the cold sweat on his brow, and sank on his bed, his 
arms hanging by his side, and his eyes closed.</P>
<P>&quot;The brothers De Witt have been judged by the people,&quot; said 
Gryphus; &quot;you call that murdered, do you? well, I call it 
executed.&quot;</P>
<P>And seeing that the prisoner was not only quiet, but 
entirely prostrate and senseless, he rushed from the cell, 
violently slamming the door, and noisily drawing the bolts.</P>
<P>Recovering his consciousness, Cornelius found himself alone, 
and recognised the room where he was,  -  &quot;the family cell,&quot; 
as Gryphus had called it,  -  as the fatal passage leading to 
ignominious death.</P>
<P>And as he was a philosopher, and, more than that, as he was 
a Christian, he began to pray for the soul of his godfather, 
then for that of the Grand Pensionary, and at last submitted 
with resignation to all the sufferings which God might 
ordain for him.</P>
<P>Then turning again to the concerns of earth, and having 
satisfied himself that he was alone in his dungeon, he drew 
from his breast the three bulbs of the black tulip, and 
concealed them behind a block of stone, on which the 
traditional water-jug of the prison was standing, in the 
darkest corner of his cell.</P>
<P>Useless labour of so many years! such sweet hopes crushed; 
his discovery was, after all, to lead to naught, just as his 
own career was to be cut short. Here, in his prison, there 
was not a trace of vegetation, not an atom of soil, not a 
ray of sunshine.</P>
<P>At this thought Cornelius fell into a gloomy despair, from 
which he was only aroused by an extraordinary circumstance.</P>
<P>What was this circumstance?</P>
<P>We shall inform the reader in our next chapter. </P></article>
