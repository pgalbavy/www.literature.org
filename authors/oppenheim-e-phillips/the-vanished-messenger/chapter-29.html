<P>
A cold twilight had fallen upon the land when Hamel left the Tower
that evening and walked briskly along the foot-way to the Hall.
Little patches of mist hung over the creeks, the sky was almost
frosty.  The lights from St. David's Hall shone like cheerful
beacons before him.  He hastened up the stone steps, crossed the
terrace, and passed into the hall.  A servant conducted him at once
to the drawing-room.  Mrs. Fentolin, in a pink evening dress, with
a pink ornament in her hair, held out both her hands.  In the
background, Mr. Fentolin, in his queerly-cut evening clothes, sat
with folded arms, leaning back in his carriage.  He listened grimly
to his sister-in-law as she stood with Hamel's hands in hers.
<P>
"My dear Mr. Hamel!" she exclaimed.  "How perfectly charming of you
to come up and relieve a little our sad loneliness!  Delightful, I
call it, of you.  I was just saying so to Miles."
<P>
Hamel looked around the room.  Already his heart was beginning to
sink.
<P>
"Miss Fentolin is well, I hope?" he asked.
<P>
"Well, but a very naughty girl," her mother declared.  "I let her
go to Lady Saxthorpe's to lunch, and now we have had simply the
firmest letter from Lady Saxthorpe.  They insist upon keeping Esther
to dine and sleep.  I have had to send her evening clothes, but you
can't tell, Mr. Hamel, how I miss her."
<P>
<P>
Hamel's disappointment was a little too obvious to pass unnoticed.
There was a shade of annoyance, too, in his face.  Mr. Fentolin
smoothly intervened.
<P>
"Let us be quite candid with Mr. Hamel, dear Florence," he begged.
"I have spoken to my sister-in-law and told her the substance of
our conversation this morning," he proceeded, wheeling his chair
nearer to Hamel.  "She is thunderstruck.  She wishes to reflect, to
consider.  Esther chanced to be away.  We have encouraged her
absence for a few more hours."
<P>
"I hope, Mrs, Fentolin," Hamel said simply, " that you will give
her to me.  I am not a rich man, but I am fairly well off.  I should
be willing to live exactly where Esther wishes, and I would do my
best to make her happy."
<P>
Mrs, Fentolin opened her lips once and closed them again.  She
laughed a little - a high-pitched, semi-hysterical laugh.  The hand
which gripped her fan was straining so that the blue veins stood out
almost like whipcord.
<P>
"Esther is very young, Mr. Hamel.  We must talk this over.  You have
known her for such a very short time."
<P>
A servant announced dinner, and Hamel offered his arm to his hostess.
<P>
"Is Gerald away, too?" he asked.
<P>
"We do indeed owe you our apologies," Mr.  Fentolin declared.
"Gerald is spending a couple of days at the Dormy House at
Brancaster - a golf arrangement made some time back."
<P>
"He promised to play with me to-morrow," Hamel remarked thoughtfully.
"He said nothing about going away."
<P>
"I fear that like most young men of his age he has little memory,"
Mr. Fentolin sighed.  "However, he will be back to-morrow or the
next day.  I owe you my apologies, Mr. Hamel, for our lack of young
people.  We must do our best to entertain our guest, Florence.  You
must be at your best, dear.  You must tell him some of those capital
stories of yours."
<P>
Mrs, Fentolin shivered for a moment.  Hamel, as he handed her to her
place, was struck by a strange look which she threw upon him, half
furtive, full of pain.  Her hand almost clung to his.  She slipped a
little, and he held her tightly.  Then he was suchdenly conscious
that something hard was being pressed into his palm.  He drew his
hand away at once.
<P>
"You seem a little unsteady this evening, my dear Florence," Mr.
Fentolin remarked, peering across the round table.
<P>
She eyed him nonchalantly enough.
<P>
"The floor is slippery," she said.  "I was glad, for a moment, of
Mr. Hamel's strong hand.  Where are those dear puppies?  Chow-Chow,"
she went on, "come and sit by your mistress at once."
<P>
Hamel's fingers inside his waistcoat pocket were smoothing out the
crumpled piece of paper which she had passed to him.  Soon he had
it quite flat.  Mrs, Fentolin, as though freed from some anxiety,
chattered away gaily.
<P>
"I don't know that I shall apologise to Mr. Hamel at all for the
young people being away," she declared.  "Just fancy what we have
saved him from - a solitary meal served by Hannah Cox!  Do you know
that they say she is half-witted, Mr. Hamel?"
<P>
"So far, she has looked after me very well," Hamel observed.
<P>
"Her intellect is defective," Mr. Fentolin remarked, "on one point
only.  The good woman is obsessed by the idea that her husband and
sons are still calling to her from the Dagger Rocks.  It is almost
pitiful to meet her wandering about there on a stormy night.  The
seacoasts are full of these little village tragedies - real
tragedies, too, however insignificant they may seem to us."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin's tone was gently sympathetic.  He changed the subject
a moment or two later, however.
<P>
"Nero fiddles to-night," he said, "while Rome burns.  There are
hundreds in our position, yet it certainly seems queer that we
should be sitting here so quietly when the whole country is in such
a state of excitement.  I see the press this morning is preaching
an immediate declaration of war."
<P>
"Against whom?" Mrs, Fentolin asked.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin smiled.
<P>
"That does seem to be rather the trouble," he admitted.  "Russia,
Austria, Germany, Italy, and France are all assisting at a
Conference to which no English representative has been bidden.  In
a sense, of course, that is equivalent to an act of hostility from
all these countries towards England.  The question is whether we
have or have not a secret understanding with France, and if so, how
far she will be bound by it.  There is a rumour that when Monsieur
Deschelles was asked formally whom he represented, that he replied
- 'France and Great Britain.'  There may be something in it.  It is
hard to see how any English statesman could have left unguarded the
Mediterranean, with all that it means, trusting simply to the faith
of a country with whom we have no binding agreement.  On the other
hand, there is the mobilisation of the fleet.  If France is really
faithful, one wonders if there was need for such an extreme step."
<P>
"I am out of touch with political affairs," Hamel declared.  "I have
been away from England for so long."
<P>
"I, on the other hand," Mr. Fentolin continued, his eyes glittering
a little, "have made the study of the political situation in Europe
my hobby for years.  I have sent to me the leading newspapers of
Berlin, Rome, Paris, St.  Petersburg, and Vienna.  For two hours
every day I read them, side by side.  It is curious sometimes to
note the common understanding which seems to exist between the
Powers not bound by any formal alliance.  For years war seemed a
very unlikely thing, and now," he added, leaning forward in his
chair, "I pronounce it almost a certainty."
<P>
Hamel looked at his host a little curiously.  Mr. Fentolin's
gentleness of expression seemed to have departed.  His face was
hard, his eyes agleam.  He bad almost the look of a bird of prey.
For some reason, the thought of war seemed to be a joy to him.
Perhaps he read something of Hamel's wonder in his expression, for
with a shrug of the shoulders he dismissed the subject.
<P>
"Well," he concluded, "all these things lie on the knees of the gods.
I dare say you wonder, Mr. Hamel, why a poor useless creature like
myself should take the slightest interest in passing events?  It is
just the fascination of the looker-on.  I want your opinion about
that champagne.  Florence dear, you must join us.  We will drink to
Mr. Hamel's health.  We will perhaps couple that toast in our minds
with the sentiment which I am sure is not very far from your
thoughts, Florence."
<P>
Hamel raised his glass and bowed to his host and hostess.  He was
not wholly at his ease.  It seemed to him that he was being watched
with a queer persistence by both of them.  Mrs, Fentolin continued
to talk and laugh with a gaiety which was too obviously forced.  Mr.
Fentolin posed for a while as the benevolent listener.  He mildly
applauded his sister-in-law's stories, and encouraged Hamel in the
recital of some of his reminiscences.  Suddenly the door was opened.
Miss Price appeared.  She walked smoothly across the room and stood
by Mr. Fentolin's side.  Stooping down, she whispered in his ear.  He
pushed his chair back a little from the table.  His face was dark
with anger.
<P>
"I said not before ten to-night," he muttered.
<P>
Again she spoke in his ear, so softly that the sound of her voice
itself scarcely travelled even as far as where Hamel was sitting.
Mr. Fentolin looked steadfastly for a moment at his sister-in-law
and from her to Hamel.  Then he backed his chair away front the
table.
<P>
"I shall have to ask to be excused for three minutes," he said.
"I must speak upon the telephone.  It is a call from some one who
declares that they have important news."
<P>
He turned the steering-wheel of his chair, and with Miss Price
by his side passed across the dining-room, out of the Oasis of
rose-shaded lights into the shadows, and through the open door.
&gt;From there he turned his head before he disappeared, as though to
watch his guest.  Mrs, Fentolin was busy fondling one of her dogs,
which she had raised to her lap, and Hamel was watching her with a
tolerant smile.
<P>
"Koto, you little idiot, why can't you sit up like your sister?
Was its tail in the way, then!  Mr. Hamel," she whispered under her
breath, so softly that he barely caught the words, although he was
only a few feet away, "don't look at me.  I feel as though we were
being watched all the time.  You can destroy that piece of paper in
your pocket.  All that it says is 'Leave here immediately after
dinner&gt;'"
<P>
Hamel sipped his wine in a nonchalant fashion.  His fingers had
strayed over the silky coat of the little dog, which she had held
out as though for his inspection.
<P>
"How can I?" he asked.  "What excuse can I make?"
<P>
"Invent one," she insisted swiftly.  "Leave here before ten o'clock.
Don't let anything keep you.  And destroy that piece of paper in
your pocket, if you can - now."
<P>
"But, Mrs, Fentolin -" he began.
<P>
She caught up one of her absurd little pets and held it to her mouth.
<P>
"Meekins is in the doorway," she whispered
<P>
Don't argue with me, please.  You are in danger you know nothing
about.  Pass me the cigarettes."
<P>
She leaned back in her chair, smoking quickly.  She held one of the
dogs on her knee and talked rubbish to it.  Hamel watched her,
leaning back in his carved oak chair, and he found it hard to keep
the pity from his eyes.  The woman was playing a part, playing it
with desperate and pitiful earnestness, a part which seemed the more
tragical because of the soft splendour of their surroundings.  From
the shadowy walls, huge, dimly-seen pictures hung about them, a
strange and yet impressive background.  Their small round
dining-table, with its rare cut glass, its perfect appointments, its
bowls of pink roses, was like a spot of wonderful colour in the great
room.  Two men servants stood at the sideboard a few yards away, a
triumph of negativeness.  The butler, who had been absent for a
moment, stood now silently waiting behind his master's place.  Hamel
was oppressed, during those few minutes of waiting, by a curious
sense of unreality, as though he were taking part in some strange
tableau.  There was something unreal about his surroundings and his
own presence there; something unreal in the atmosphere, charged as
it seemed to be with some omen of impending happenings; something
unreal in that whispered warning, those few hoarsely uttered words
which had stolen to his hearing across the clusters of drooping
roses; the absurd babble of the woman, who sat there with tragic
things under the powder with which her face was daubed.
<P>
"Koto must learn to sit upon his tail - like that.  No, not another
grape till he sits up.  There, then!"
<P>
She was leaning forward with a grape between her teeth, towards the
tiny animal who was trying in vain to balance his absurdly shaped
little body upon the tablecloth.  Hamel, without looking around,
knew quite well what was happening.  Soon he heard the click of the
chair.  Mr. Fentolin was back in his place.  His skin seemed paler
and more parchment-like than ever.  His eyes glittered.
<P>
"It seems," he announced quietly, as he raised his wine-glass to his
lips with the air of one needing support, "that we entertained an
angel unawares here.  This Mr. Dunster is lost for the second time.
A very important personage he turns out to be."
<P>
"You mean the American whom Gerald brought home after the accident?"
Mrs, Fentolin asked carelessly.
<P>
 Mr. Fentolin replied.  "He insisted upon continuing his journey
before he was strong enough.  I warned him of what might happen.
He has evidently been take ill somewhere.  It seems that he was
on his way to The Hague."
<P>
"Do you mean that he has disappeared altogether this time?" Hamel
asked.
<P>
Mr. Fentolin shook his head.
<P>
"No, he has found his way to The Hague safely enough.  He is lying
there at a hotel in the city, but he is unconscious.  There is some
talk about his having been robbed on the way.  At any rate, they
are tracing his movements backwards.  We are to be honoured with a
visit from one of Scotland Yard's detect,ives, to reconstruct his
journey from here.  Our quiet little corner of the world is becoming
quite notorious.  Florence dear, you are tired.  I can see it in
your eyes.  Your headache continues, I am sure.  We will not be
selfish.  Mr. Hamel and I are going to have a long evening in the
library.  Let me recommend a phenacetin and bed."
<P>
She rose at once to her feet, with a dog under either arm.
<P>
"I'll take the phenacetin," she promised, "but I hate going to bed
early.  Shall I see you again, I wonder, Mr. Hamel?"
<P>
"Not this evening, I fear," he answered.  "I am going to ask Mr.
Fentolin to excuse me early."
<P>
She passed out of the room.  Hamel escorted her as far as the door
and then returned.  Mr. Fentolin was sitting quite still in his
chair.  His eyes were fixed upon the tablecloth.  He looked up
quickly as Hamel resumed his seat.
<P>
"You are not in earnest, I hope, Mr. Hamel," he said, "when you tell
me that you must leave early?  I have been anticipating a long
evening.  My library is filled with books on South America which I
want to discuss with you."
<P>
"Another evening, if you don't mind," Hamel begged.  "To-night I
must ask you to excuse my hurrying away."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin looked up from underneath his eyelids.  His glance was
quick and penetrating.
<P>
"Why this haste?"
<P>
Hamel shrugged his shoulders.
<P>
"To tell you the truth," he admitted, "I had an idea while I was
reading an article on cantilever bridges this morning.  I want to
work it out."
<P>
Mr. Fentolin glanced behind him.  The door of the dining-room was
closed.  The servants had disappeared.  Meekins alone, looking more
like a prize fighter than ever in his somber evening clothes, had
taken the place of the butler behind his master's chair.
<P>
     "We shall see," Mr. Fentolin said quietly.
<P>
