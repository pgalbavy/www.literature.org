<P>
WHAT I have now to tell you of Mary is derived from information
obtained at a date in my life later by many years than any date
of which I have written yet. Be pleased to remember this.
<P>
<P>
Dermody, the bailiff, possessed relatives in London, of whom he
occasionally spoke, and relatives in Scotland, whom he never
mentioned. My father had a strong prejudice against the Scotch
nation. Dermody knew his master well enough to be aware that the
prejudice might extend to _him_, if he spoke of his Scotch
kindred. He was a discreet man, and he never mentioned them.
<P>
On leaving my father's service, he had made his way, partly by
land and partly by sea, to Glasgow--in which city his friends
resided. With his character and his experience, Dermody was a man
in a
 thousand to any master who was lucky enough to discover him. His
friends bestirred themselves. In six weeks' time he was placed in
charge of a gentleman's estate on the eastern coast of Scotland,
and was comfortably established with his mother and his daughter
in a new home.
<P>
The insulting language which my father had addressed to him had
sunk deep in Dermody's mind. He wrote privately to his relatives
in London, telling them that he had found a new situation which
suited him, and that he had his reasons for not at present
mentioning his address. In this way he baffled the inquiries
which my mother's lawyers (failing to discover a trace of him in
other directions) addressed to his London friends. Stung by his
old master's reproaches, he sacrificed his daughter and he
sacrificed me--partly to his own sense of self-respect, partly to
his conviction that the difference between us in rank made it his
duty to check all further intercourse before it was too late.
<P>
Buried in their retirement in a remote part of Scotland, the
little household lived, lost to me, and lost to the world.
<P>
In dreams, I had seen and heard Mary. In dreams, Mary saw and
heard me. The innocent longings and wishes which filled my heart
while I was still a boy were revealed to her in the mystery of
sleep. Her grandmother, holding firmly to her faith in the
predestined union between us, sustained the girl's courage and
cheered her heart. She could hear her father say (as my father
had said) that we were parted to meet no more, and could
privately think of her happy dreams as the sufficient promise of
another future than the future which Dermody contemplated. So she
still lived with me in the spirit--and lived in hope.
<P>
The first affliction that befell the little household was the
death of the grandmother, by the exhaustion of extreme old age.
In her last conscious moments, she said to Mary, "Never forget
that you and George are spirits consecrated to each other.
Wait--in the certain knowledge that no human power can hinder
your union in the time to come."
<P>
While those words were still vividly present to Mary's mind, our
visionary union by dreams was abruptly broken on her side, as it
had been abruptly broken on mine. In the first days of my
self-degradation, I had ceased to see Mary. Exactly at the same
period Mary ceased to see me.
<P>
The girl's sensitive nature sunk under the shock. She had now no
elder woman to comfort and advise her; she lived alone with her
father, who invariably changed the subject whenever she spoke of
the old times. The secret sorrow that preys on body and mind
alike preyed on _her_. A cold, caught at the inclement season,
turned to fever. For weeks she was in danger of death. When she
recovered, her head had been stripped of its beautiful hair by
the doctor's order. The sacrifice had been necessary to save her
life. It proved to be, in one respect, a cruel sacrifice--her
hair never grew plentifully again. When it did reappear, it had
completely lost its charming mingled hues of deep red and brown;
it was now of one monotonous light-brown color throughout. At
first sight, Mary's Scotch friends hardly knew her again.
<P>
But Nature made amends for what the head had lost by what the
face and the figure gained.
<P>
In a year from the date of her illness, the frail little child of
the old days at Greenwater Broad had ripened, in the bracing
Scotch air and the healthy mode of life, into a comely young
woman. Her features were still, as in her early years, not
regularly beautiful; but the change in her was not the less
marked on that account. The wan face had filled out, and the pale
complexion had found its color. As to her figure, its remarkable
development was perceived even by the rough people about her.
Promising nothing when she was a child, it had now sprung into
womanly fullness, symmetry, and grace. It was a strikingly
beautiful figure, in the strictest sense of the word.
<P>
Morally as well as physically, there were moments, at this period
of their lives, when even her own father hardly recognized his
daughter of former days. She had lost her childish vivacity--her
sweet, equable flow of good humor. Silent and self-absorbed, she
went through the daily routine of her duties enduringly. The hope
of meeting me again had sunk to a dead hope in her by this time.
She made no complaint. The bodily strength that she had gained in
these later days had its sympathetic influence in steadying her
mind. When her father once or twice ventured to ask if she was
still thinking of me, she answered quietly that she had brought
herself to share his opinions. She could not doubt that I had
long since ceased to think of her. Even if I had remained
faithful to her, she was old enough now to know that the
difference between us in rank made our union by marriage an
impossibility. It would be best (she thought) not to refer any
more to the past, best to forget me, as I had forgotten her. So
she spoke now. So, tried by the test of appearances, Dame
Dermody's confident forecast of our destinies had failed to
justify itself, and had taken its place among the predictions
that are never fulfilled.
<P>
The next notable event in the family annals which followed Mary's
illness happened when she had attained the age of nineteen years.
Even at this distance of time my heart sinks, my courage fails
me, at the critical stage in my narrative which I have now
reached.
<P>
A storm of unusual severity burst over the eastern coast of
Scotland. Among the ships that were lost in the tempest was a
vessel bound from Holland, which was wrecked on the rocky shore
near Dermody's place of abode. Leading the way in all good
actions, the bailiff led the way in rescuing the passengers and
crew of the lost ship. He had brought one man alive to land, and
was on his way back to the vessel, when two heavy seas, following
in close succession, dashed him against the rocks. He was
rescued, at the risk of their own lives, by his neighbors. The
medical examination disclosed a broken bone and severe bruises
and lacerations. So far, Dermody's sufferings were easy of
relief. But, after a lapse of time, symptoms appeared in the
patient which revealed to his medical attendant the presence of
serious internal injury. In the doctor's opinion, he could never
hope to resume the active habits of his life. He would be an
invalid and a crippled man for the rest of his days.
<P>
Under these melancholy circumstances, the bailiff's employer did
all that could be strictly expected of him, He hired an assistant
to undertake the supervision of the farm work, and he permitted
Dermody to occupy his cottage for the next three months. This
concession gave the poor man time to recover such relics of
strength as were still left to him, and to consult his friends in
Glasgow on the doubtful question of his life to come.
<P>
The prospect was a serious one. Dermody was quite unfit for any
sedentary employment; and the little money that he had saved was
not enough to support his daughter and himself. The Scotch
friends were willing and kind; but they had domestic claims on
them, and they had no money to spare.
<P>
In this emergency, the passenger in the wrecked vessel (whose
life Dermody had saved) came forward with a proposal which took
father and daughter alike by surprise. He made Mary an offer of
marriage; on the express understanding (if she accepted him) that
her home was to be her father's home also to the end of his life.
<P>
The person who thus associated himself with the Dermodys in the
time of their trouble was a Dutch gentleman, named Ernest Van
Brandt. He possessed a share in a fishing establishment on the
shores of the Zuyder Zee; and he was on his way to establish a
correspondence with the fisheries in the North of Scotland when
the vessel was wrecked. Mary had produced a strong impression on
him when they first met. He had lingered in the neighborhood, in
the hope of gaining her favorable regard, with time to help him.
Personally he was a handsome man, in the prime of life; and he
was possessed of a sufficient income to marry on. In making his
proposal, he produced references to persons of high social
position in Holland, who could answer for hi m, so far as the
questions of character and position were concerned.
<P>
Mary was long in considering which course it would be best for
her helpless father, and best for herself, to adopt.
<P>
The hope of a marriage with me had been a hope abandoned by her
years since. No woman looks forward willingly to a life of
cheerless celibacy. In thinking of her future, Mary naturally
thought of herself in the character of a wife. Could she fairly
expect in the time to come to receive any more attractive
proposal than the proposal now addressed to her? Mr. Van Brandt
had every personal advantage that a woman could desire; he was
devotedly in love with her; and he felt a grateful affection for
her father as the man to whom he owed his life. With no other
hope in her heart--with no other prospect in view--what could she
do better than marry Mr. Van Brandt?
<P>
Influenced by these considerations, she decided on speaking the
fatal word. She said, "Yes."
<P>
At the same time, she spoke plainly to Mr. Van Brandt,
unreservedly acknowledging that she had contemplated another
future than the future now set before her. She did not conceal
that there had once been an old love in her heart, and that a new
love was more than she could command. Esteem, gratitude, and
regard she could honestly offer; and, with time, love might come.
For the rest, she had long since disassociated herself from the
past, and had definitely given up all the hopes and wishes once
connected with it. Repose for her father, and tranquil happiness
for herself, were the only favors that she asked of fortune now.
These she might find under the roof of an honorable man who loved
and respected her. She could promise, on her side, to make him a
good and faithful wife, if she could promise no more. It rested
with Mr. Van Brandt to say whether he really believed that he
would be consulting his own happiness in marrying her on these
terms.
<P>
Mr. Van Brandt accepted the terms without a moment's hesitation.
<P>
They would have been married immediately but for an alarming
change for the worse in the condition of Dermody's health.
Symptoms showed themselves, which the doctor confessed that he
had not anticipated when he had given his opinion on the case. He
warned Mary that the end might be near. A physician was summoned
from Edinburgh, at Mr. Van Brandt's expense. He confirmed the
opinion entertained by the country doctor. For some days longer
the good bailiff lingered. On the last morning, he put his
daughter's hand in Van Brandt's hand. "Make her happy, sir," he
said, in his simple way, "and you will be even with me for saving
your life." The same day he died quietly in his daughter's arms.
<P>
Mary's future was now entirely in her lover's hands. The
relatives in Glasgow had daughters of their own to provide for.
The relatives in London resented Dermody's neglect of them. Van
Brandt waited, delicately and considerately, until the first
violence of the girl's grief had worn itself out, and then he
pleaded irresistibly for a husband's claim to console her.
<P>
The time at which they were married in Scotland was also the time
at which I was on my way home from India. Mary had then reached
the age of twenty years.
<P>
<P>
The story of our ten years' separation is now told; the narrative
leaves us at the outset of our new lives.
<P>
I am with my mother, beginning my career as a country gentleman
on the estate in Perthshire which I have inherited from Mr.
Germaine. Mary is with her husband, enjoying her new privileges,
learning her new duties, as a wife. She, too, is living in
Scotland--living, by a strange fatality, not very far distant
from my country-house. I have no suspicion that she is so near to
me: the name of Mrs. Van Brandt (even if I had heard it) appeals
to no familiar association in my mind. Still the kindred spirits
are parted. Still there is no idea on her side, and no idea on
mine, that we shall ever meet again.
