<p>I knew afterwards&mdash;long, long afterwards&mdash;that I had been stabbed
repeatedly; how many times is now of little consequence, although
I have sometimes counted the white cicatrices on my body, tracing
each with wonder that I had not long ago done with this life.</p>

<p>For that matter, I was regarded as already ended when they tore
my assailant from my body and shattered him to death with their
hatchets and knives, pistoling him again and again while he still
quivered in the long grass.</p>

<p>As for me, I appeared to be quite dead, and whether to bury me
there or in some kinder spot, none could determine, while the
dear maid I loved lay senseless in Black Betty's arms.</p>

<p>As it was afterwards told to me in the saddest days of my life,
so I tell what now befell the rescued, the rescuers, and that
scarcely palpitating body o' mine, the soul of which floated on
the dark borderland of Death. For it came to happen that dawn,
lurking behind the eastern hills, set dull signals of fire on
every western peak, warning Mount and Renard that day was on their
trail to bare it for all who chose to follow.</p>

<p>My senseless sweetheart they bore to the waiting chaise, and,
my body still retaining some warmth, they bore that, too, because
they dared not bury me before she had seen me dead with her own
eyes.</p>

<p>All that day they rode west by north, climbing the vast divide,
halting to lie perdu when their keen ears heard movements all
unseen, pushing on to tear the path free while their axes rang
out among the windfalls. Then, when the western sun sank beyond
the Ohio into the sea of trees, the winds of the east filled their
nostrils and the long divide had been passed at last.</p>

<p>That night my dear love opened her eyes, and the darkness that
enchained her fell, so that she crept to my feet as I lay in a
corner of the chaise and laid her head on my knees.</p>

<p>Whether she thought me alive or dead none knew. Betty had bared
my body to the waist and washed it. For a corpse they do as much.
Later, without hope, Mount brought a pannikinful of blue-balsam
gum, pricked from the globules on the trunk, and when Betty had
once more washed me, they filled the long gashes with the balsam
and closed them decently, strip on strip, with the fine cambric
shift which my sweetheart tore from her own body.</p>

<p>Later, when the moon was coming up, they carried me lying in
a blanket, my sweetheart walking beside me, and her silken shoon
in tatters till her feet bled at every step, but refused to go
back to the chaise. That night they thought me surely dead and
watched without sleep lest the rigidity of dissolution surprise
me ere my limbs had been laid straight. But the morning found
me as I was, and the first shadow of night revealed no change,
nor was I dead on the next morning, nor on the next, nor yet the
next.</p>

<p>A still Sabbath in the forest, passed amid the sad twilight of
the trees, gave them hope; for I had opened my eyes, though I
saw nothing. But that night Death sat at my right hand, and the
next night Death cradled my head; and my dear love lay at my feet
and looked Death steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>The fever which loosened every muscle burned fiercely all night
long, and my voice broke out from my body like a demon mocking
within me. A few of the Lenape, roaming near, followed and shot
at us towards dawn, driving us north into the forest, where the
chaise was abandoned, the traces cut, and the horses loaded with
corn.</p>

<p>North and south the runways of the Long House pierced the wilderness,
and these were the trails they followed, the men on foot, bearing
me on their litter of blankets and balsam-boughs, the women crouching
on the sack-laden horses.</p>

<p>As for me, I lived on through cold and heat, storm and stress,
seeing nothing, hearing nothing, dumb, save when the demon hidden
in my body mocked and laughed between my blackened lips. That
demon was always watching things which I could not see, peeping
out through my eyes into hell. Hours came when there was no water,
and the demon knew it and mouthed and cursed between my shrinking
lips. Then he would turn on me and tear at my throat and gnaw
me and thrust his claws into my brain. Sometimes I heard his low
laughter, for though I could neither see nor hear aught in the
world, I could hear the demon sometimes, and feel him in my body,
setting fire to the blood till it boiled like the water he craved.</p>

<p>At night he often stole my body and carried it where the darkness
burnt and charred. There he would take out my bones, one by one,
and break them for the marrow to dry hard.</p>

<p>These things no one has told me. I remember them in sleep sometimes,
sometimes waking.</p>

<p>What I have heard from others is vague, and to me unreal as a
painted scene in a picture where a film has settled under cobwebs.
I hear that I breathed through days which I never saw, that I
opened my eyes on lands which are strange to me, that my babble
broke primeval silences which God himself had sealed. Nay, not
I, but the demon mocked through those voiceless voids and lost
ravines, through the still twilight of the noonday forest, through
midnight summits muffled in the clouds. But only I know that,
or dream it sometimes when I ponder on my end and on that fair
salvation which my father finds lately in Christ.</p>

<p>Now, my dark soul, to hidden realms addressed, returned to me
one night, and, listening, heard the demon scratching at my bones.
Then, weary and perplexed, inside my body crept my soul and drew
the lids of both eyes down, so that we might sleep together before
the busy demon knew.</p>

<p>Yet I, having my soul again, opened my eyes to find a star was
watching me; then, content, lay closer to my soul and slept. And
thus the demon found us, and so fled back to the sleepless hell
from whence he came.</p>

<p>Sleeping, I smelled lavender in the forest, and I thought the
wood had windows where a sweet wind blew. Truly, there was a window
somewhere near me, for I found my eyes had opened and could see
it where the curtains swayed in the sun.</p>

<p>Hours later I looked again; the window was still there, and the
moon beyond, low among pines whose shapes I knew.</p>

<p>Hours came and faded into sunshine; days brought bright spots
on the curtains; night brought the moon and the tall pines. Sweet-fern,
too, I smelled sometimes, and I heard a soothing monotone of familiar
sound below me.</p>

<p>One day a cock crew and I fell a-trembling all alone, I knew
not why. That night a new sound woke me, and I felt the presence
of another person. Moonlight silvered the window of a room which
I knew; but I was very quiet and waited for the sun, lest the
phantoms I divined should trick me.</p>

<p>Then came a morning&mdash;perhaps the next, but I am not sure&mdash;when
I knew I was in a bed and very tired, too tired to see aught but
the sheets and the sunlit curtains beyond. That night, however,
I heard rain falling on a roof and fell asleep, watching the window
for the hidden moon.</p>

<p>When I first recognized the room, my memory served me a trick,
and I thought of the school-room below where the others were imprisoned 
&mdash;Silver Heels, Peter, and Esk. Slyly content to doze abed
here in Sir William's room, I understood that I must have been
lying sick a long, long time, but could not remember when I had
fallen ill. One thing sure: I did not mean they should know that
I was better; I closed my eyes when I felt a presence near, lying
still as a mouse until alone again.</p>

<p>Sometimes my thoughts wandered to the others in the school-room
with Mr. Yost, for I did not remember he had been scalped by the
Lenape, and I pitied Silver Heels and Esk and fat Peter a-thumbing
their copy-books and breathing chalk-dust. Faith, I was well off
in the great white bed, here in Sir William's room.</p>

<p>I could see his fish-rods on the wall, looped with silk lines
and scarlet feather-flies; his hunting-horn, too, and his whip
and spurs hanging from hooks beneath a fox's-mask and brush. There
hung his fowling-pieces above the mantel, pouch and horn dangling
from crossed ramrods; there rose his book-case with the eared-owl
atop and the Chinese jar full o' pipes, long as my arm and twice
as strong&mdash;a conceit which sent a weak wave of mirth through my
body I could not move.</p>

<p>Soft! They are coming to watch me now. So I slyly close my eyes
till they go away or give me the drinks they brew to make me sleep.
I know them; were I minded I might gather strength to spit out
their sense-stealing stuffs. But I swallow and dream and wake
to a new sun or to mark the waxing moon, now near its full.</p>

<p>Our Doctor Pierson was here to-day and caught me watching him.
They'll soon have me in the school-room now, though I do still
play possum all I can, eating my gruel, which a strange servant
brings, and pretending not to see her. Yet I am wondering why
the maid is so silent and that her gown is so dark and stiff.</p>

<p>Later that day I saw Colonel Guy Johnson come into the room and
look at me, but I did not mean he should think me awake, and so
closed my eyes and lay quiet. When Sir William should come, however,
I would open my eyes, for I had been desiring to see him since
I saw his rods and guns. It fretted me at times that he neglected
me, knowing my love for him.</p>

<p>Once, as I lay dozing, Peter crept into the room and stared at
me. He had grown tall and gross and heavy-eyed, so that I scarce
knew him, nor had he a trace of Sir William in his slinking carriage,
which was all Mohawk, and the worst Mohawk at that. I was glad
when he ceased thumbing the bedposts and left me.</p>

<p>The next day I saw Doctor Pierson beside me and asked for Sir
William. He said that Sir William was away and that I was doing
well. We often spoke after that, and he was ever busy with my
head, which no longer ached save when he fingered it.</p>

<p>Then one night I awoke with a cry of terror and found myself
sitting upright, bathed in chilly sweat, shouting that the Cayugas
were abroad and that I must hold them back by the throat till
Sir William could arrive and restrain them.</p>

<p>Lights soon moved into the room; I saw Doctor Pierson and Guy
Johnson, but the dammed-up floods of memory had broken loose like
an old wound, and the past came crowding upon me till I fell back
on the pillows, convulsed and gasping, while the strong hands
of the doctor began their silent work, tapping head and body,
till somebody gave me a draught and I drowsed perdu.</p>

<p>Day broke&mdash;the bitterest day of life I was to know. I felt it,
listening to the rain; I felt it, in the footsteps that passed
my door&mdash;footsteps I did not know. Why was the house so silent?
Why did all go about so quietly, dressed in black? Was there some
one dead in the house below? Where was Silver Heels? Why had she
never come to me? How came I here? Where was Jack Mount and Cade
Renard? And Sir William, where was he that he came not near me&mdash;me
who had lain sick unto death in his service and for his sake?</p>

<p>Dread numbed me; I strove to call, but my dumb lips froze; I
strove to rise, and found my body wrecked in bed without power,
without sense, a helpless, inert thing between two sheets.</p>

<p>Why was I here? Why was I alive if aught had harmed Silver Heels?
God! And I safe here in bed? Where was she? <em>Where was she?</em>
Dead? Why do they not tell me? Why do they not kill me as I lie
here if I have returned without her?</p>

<p>I must have cried aloud in my agony, for the doctor came running
and leaned over me.</p>

<p>"Tell me! Tell me!" I stammered. "Why don't you tell me?" and
strove to strike him, but could not use my arms.</p>

<p>"Quiet, quiet," he said, watching me; "I will tell you what you
wish to know. What is it then, my poor boy?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>want &mdash;Felicity," I blurted out.</p>

<p>"Felicity?" he repeated, blankly. "Oh&mdash;Miss&mdash;ahem! &mdash;Miss
Warren?"</p>

<p>I glared at him.</p>

<p>"Miss Warren has gone with Sir John Johnson to Boston," he said,
dryly.</p>

<p>My eyes never left him.</p>

<p>"Is that why you cried out?" he asked, curiously. "Miss Warren
left us a week ago. Had you only known her she would have been
happy, for she has slept for weeks on the couch yonder."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why did she go?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you the reasons," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>"When will she return?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>With a strength that came from God knows where, I dragged myself
upright and caught him by the hand.</p>

<p>"She is dead!" I whispered. "She is dead, and all in this house
know it save I who love her!"</p>

<p>A strange light passed over the doctor's face; he took both my
hands and looked at me carefully. Then he smiled and gently forced
me back to the pillows.</p>

<p>"She is alive and well," he said. "On my honour as a man, lad,
I set your heart at rest. She is in Boston, and I do know why,
but I may not meddle with what concerns this family, save in sickness&mdash;or
death."</p>

<p>I watched his lips. They were solemn as the solemn word he uttered.
I knew death had been in the house; I had felt that for days.
I waited, watching him.</p>

<p>"Poor lad," he said, holding my hands.</p>

<p>My eyes never left his.</p>

<p>"Ay," he said, softly, "his last word was your name. He loved
you dearly, lad."</p>

<p>And so I knew that Sir William was dead.</p>
