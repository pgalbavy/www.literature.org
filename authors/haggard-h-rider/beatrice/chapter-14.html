<p>On the day following their religious discussion an accident happened
which resulted in Geoffrey and Beatrice being more than ever thrown
in the company of each other. During the previous week two cases of
scarlatina had been reported among the school children, and now it was
found that the complaint had spread so much that it was necessary to
close the school. This meant, of course, that Beatrice had all her time
upon her hands. And so had Geoffrey. It was his custom to bathe before
breakfast, after which he had nothing to do for the rest of the day.
Beatrice with little Effie also bathed before breakfast from the ladies’
bathing-place, a quarter of a mile off, and sometimes he would meet her
as she returned, glowing with health and beauty like Venus new risen
from the Cyprian sea, her half-dried hair hanging in heavy masses down
her back. Then after breakfast they would take Effie down to the beach,
and her “auntie,” as the child learned to call Beatrice, would teach her
lessons and poetry till she was tired, and ran away to paddle in the sea
or look for prawns among the rocks.
</p><p>Meanwhile the child’s father and Beatrice would talk--not about
religion, they spoke no more on that subject, nor about Owen Davies,
but of everything else on earth. Beatrice was a merry woman when she was
happy, and they never lacked subjects of conversation, for their minds
were very much in tune. In book-learning Beatrice had the advantage of
Geoffrey, for she had not only read enormously, she also remembered what
she read and could apply it. Her critical faculty, too, was very keen.
He, on the other hand, had more knowledge of the world, and in his rich
days had travelled a good deal, and so it came to pass that each could
always find something to tell the other. Never for one second were they
dull, not even when they sat for an hour or so in silence, for it was
the silence of complete companionship.
</p><p>So the long morning would wear away all too quickly, and they would go
in to dinner, to be greeted with a cold smile by Elizabeth and heartily
enough by the old gentleman, who never thought of anything out of his
own circle of affairs. After dinner it was the same story. Either they
went walking to look for ferns and flowers, or perhaps Geoffrey took his
gun and hid behind the rocks for curlew, sending Beatrice, who knew the
coast by heart, a mile round or more to some headland in order to put
them on the wing. Then she would come back, springing towards him from
rock to rock, and crouch down beneath a neighbouring seaweed-covered
boulder, and they would talk together in whispers, or perhaps they would
not talk at all, for fear lest they should frighten the flighting birds.
And Geoffrey would first search the heavens for curlew or duck, and,
seeing none, would let his eyes fall upon the pure beauty of Beatrice’s
face, showing so clearly against the tender sky, and wonder what she was
thinking about; till, suddenly feeling his gaze, she would turn with a
smile as sweet as the first rosy blush of dawn upon the waters, and ask
him what <u>he</u> was thinking about. And he would laugh and answer “You,”
 whereon she would smile again and perhaps blush a little, feeling glad
at heart, she knew not why.
</p><p>Then came tea-time and the quiet, when they sat at the open window,
and Geoffrey smoked and listened to the soft surging of the sea and
the harmonious whisper of the night air in the pines. In the corner Mr.
Granger slept in his armchair, or perhaps he had gone to bed altogether,
for he liked to go to bed at half-past eight, as the old Herefordshire
farmer, his father, had done before him; and at the far end of the room
sat Elizabeth, doing her accounts by the light of a solitary candle,
or, if they failed her, reading some book of a devotional and inspired
character. But over the edge of the book, or from the page of crabbed
accounts, her eyes would glance continually towards the handsome pair in
the window-place, and she would smile as she saw that it went well. Only
they never saw the glances or noted the smile. When Geoffrey looked that
way, which was not often, for Elizabeth--old Elizabeth, as he always
called her to himself--did not attract him, all he saw was her sharp but
capable-looking form bending over her work, and the light of the candle
gleaming on her straw-coloured hair and falling in gleaming white
patches on her hard knuckles.
</p><p>And so the happy day would pass and bed-time come, and with it unbidden
dreams.
</p><p>Geoffrey thought no ill of all this, as of course he ought to have
thought. He was not the ravening lion of fiction--so rarely, if ever, to
be met with in real life--going about seeking whom he might devour. He
had absolutely no designs on Beatrice’s affections, any more than she
had on his, and he had forgotten that first fell prescience of evil to
come. Once or twice, it is true, qualms of doubt did cross his mind in
the earlier days of their intimacy. But he put them by as absurd. He
was no believer in the tender helplessness of full-grown women, his
experience having been that they are amply capable--and, for the most
part, more than capable--of looking after themselves. It seemed to him
a thing ridiculous that such a person as Beatrice, who was competent to
form opinions and a judgment upon all the important questions of life,
should be treated as a child, and that he should remove himself from
Bryngelly lest her young affections should become entangled. He felt
sure that they would never be entrapped in any direction whatsoever
without her full consent.
</p><p>Then he ceased to think about the matter at all. Indeed, the mere
idea of such a thing involved a supposition that would only have been
acceptable to a conceited man--namely, that there was a possibility of
this young lady’s falling in love with him. What right had he to suppose
anything of the sort? It was an impertinence. That there was another
sort of possibility--namely, of his becoming more attached to her than
was altogether desirable--did, however, occur to him once or twice. But
he shrugged his shoulders and put it by. After all, it was his look out,
and he did not much care. It would do her no harm at the worst. But very
soon all these shadowy forebodings of dawning trouble vanished quite.
They were lost in the broad, sweet lights of friendship. By-and-by, when
friendship’s day was done, they might arise again, called by other names
and wearing a sterner face.
</p><p>It was ridiculous--of course it was ridiculous; he was not going to fall
in love like a boy at his time of life; all he felt was gratitude
and interest--all she felt was amusement in his society. As for the
intimacy--felt rather than expressed--the intimacy that could already
almost enable the one to divine the other’s thought, that could shape
her mood to his and his to hers, that could cause the same thing of
beauty to be a common joy, and discover unity of mind in opinions the
most opposite--why, it was only natural between people who had together
passed a peril terrible to think of. So they took the goods the gods
provided, and drifted softly on--whither they did not stop to inquire.
</p><p>One day, however, a little incident happened that ought to have opened
the eyes of both. They had arranged, or rather there was a tacit
understanding, that they should go out together in the afternoon.
Geoffrey was to take his gun and Beatrice a book, but it chanced that,
just before dinner, as she walked back from the village, where she had
gone to buy some thread to mend Effie’s clothes, Beatrice came face to
face with Mr. Davies. It was their first meeting without witnesses since
the Sunday of which the events have been described, and, naturally,
therefore, rather an awkward one. Owen stopped short so that she could
not pass him with a bow, and then turned and walked beside her. After a
remark or two about the weather, the springs of conversation ran dry.
</p><p>“You remember that you are coming up to the Castle this afternoon?” he
said, at length.
</p><p>“To the Castle!” she answered. “No, I have heard nothing of it.”
</p><p>“Did not your sister tell you she made an engagement for herself and you
a week or more ago? You are to bring the little girl; she wants to see
the view from the top of the tower.”
</p><p>Then Beatrice remembered. Elizabeth had told her, and she had thought it
best to accept the situation. The whole thing had gone out of her mind.
</p><p>“Oh, I beg your pardon! I do remember now, but I have made another
plan--how stupid of me!”
</p><p>“You had forgotten,” he said in his heavy voice; “it is easy for you
to forget what I have been looking forward to for a whole week. What is
your plan--to go out walking with Mr. Bingham, I suppose?”
</p><p>“Yes,” answered Beatrice, “to go out with Mr. Bingham.”
</p><p>“Ah! you go out with Mr. Bingham every day now.”
</p><p>“And what if I do?” said Beatrice quickly; “surely, Mr. Davies, I have a
right to go out with whom I like?”
</p><p>“Yes, of course; but the engagement to come to the Castle was made
first; are you not going to keep it?”
</p><p>“Of course I am going to keep it; I always keep my engagements when I
have any.”
</p><p>“Very well, then; I shall expect you at three o’clock.”
</p><p>Beatrice went on home in a curiously irritated condition of mind. She
did not, naturally, want to go to the Castle, and she did want to go out
with Geoffrey. However, there was no help for it.
</p><p>When she came in to dinner she found that Geoffrey was not there. He
had, it seemed, gone to lunch with Dr. Chambers, whom he had met on the
beach. Before he returned they were all three starting for the Castle,
Beatrice leaving a message to this effect with Betty.
</p><p>About a quarter of an hour afterwards, Geoffrey came back to fetch his
gun and Beatrice, but Beatrice was gone, and all that he could extract
from Betty was that she had gone to see Mr. Davies.
</p><p>He was perfectly furious, though all the while he knew how unreasonable
was his anger. He had been looking forward to the expedition, and this
sudden change of plan was too much for his temper. Off he started,
however, to pass a thoroughly miserable afternoon. He seemed to miss
Beatrice more each step and gradually to grow more and more angry at
what he called her “rudeness.” Of course it never occurred to him that
what he was really angry at was her going to see Mr. Davies, or that, in
truth, her society had become so delightful to him that to be deprived
of it even for an afternoon was to be wretched. To top everything, he
only got three good shots that afternoon, and he missed them all, which
made him crosser than ever.
</p><p>As for Beatrice, she enjoyed herself just as little at the Castle as
Geoffrey did on the beach. Owen Davies took them through the great
unused rooms and showed them the pictures, but she had seen them before,
and though some of them were very fine, did not care to look at them
again--at any rate, not that afternoon. But Elizabeth gazed at them with
eager eyes and mentally appraised their value, wondering if they would
ever be hers.
</p><p>“What is this picture?” she asked, pointing to a beautiful portrait of a
Dutch Burgomaster by Rembrandt.
</p><p>“That,” answered Davies heavily, for he knew nothing of painting and
cared less, “that is a Velasquez, valued for probate at £3,000--no,”
 referring to the catalogue and reading, “I beg your pardon, the next is
the Velasquez; that is a Rembrandt in the master’s best style, showing
all his wonderful mastery over light and shade. It was valued for
probate at £4,000 guineas.”
</p><p>“Four thousand guineas!” said Elizabeth, “fancy having a thing worth
four thousand guineas hanging on a wall!”
</p><p>And so they went on, Elizabeth asking questions and Owen answering them
by the help of the catalogue, till, to Beatrice’s relief, they came at
length to the end of the pictures. Then they took some tea in the little
sitting room of the master of all this magnificence. Owen, to her great
annoyance, sat opposite to Beatrice, staring at her with all his eyes
while she drank her tea, with Effie sitting in her lap, and Elizabeth,
observing it, bit her lip in jealousy. She had thought it well to bring
her sister here; it would not do to let Mr. Davies think she was keeping
Beatrice out of his way, but his mute idol worship was trying to
her feelings. After tea they went to the top of the tower, and Effie
rejoiced exceedingly in the view, which was very beautiful. Here Owen
got a word with Elizabeth.
</p><p>“Your sister seems to be put out about something,” he said.
</p><p>“I daresay,” she answered carelessly; “Beatrice has an uncertain temper.
I think she wanted to go out shooting with Mr. Bingham this afternoon.”
</p><p>Had Owen been a less religious person he might have sworn; as it was, he
only said, “Mr. Bingham--it is always Mr. Bingham from morning to night!
When is he going away?”
</p><p>“In another week, I believe. Beatrice will be sorry, I think; she makes
a great companion of him. And now I think that we must be getting home,”
 and she went, leaving this poisoned shaft to rankle in his breast.
</p><p>After they had returned to the vicarage and Beatrice had heard Effie her
prayers and tucked her up in her small white bed, she went down to the
gate to be quiet for a little while before supper. Geoffrey had not yet
come in.
</p><p>It was a lovely autumn evening; the sea seemed to sleep, and the little
clouds, from which the sunset fires had paled, lay like wreaths of
smoke upon the infinite blue sky. Why had not Mr. Bingham come back,
she wondered; he would scarcely have time to dress. Supposing that an
accident had happened to him. Nonsense! what accident could happen? He
was so big and strong he seemed to defy accidents; and yet had it not
been for her there would be little enough left of his strength to-day.
Ah! she was glad that she had lived to be able to save him from death.
There he came, looming like a giant in the evening mist.
</p><p>There was a small hand-gate beside the large one on which she leant.
Geoffrey stalked straight up to it as though he did not see her; he saw
her well enough, but he was cross with her.
</p><p>She allowed him to pass through the gate, which he shut slowly, perhaps
to give her an opportunity of speaking, if she wished to do so; then
thinking that he did not see her she spoke in her soft, musical voice.
</p><p>“Did you have good sport, Mr. Bingham?”
</p><p>“No,” he answered shortly; “I saw very little, and I missed all I saw.”
</p><p>“I am so sorry, except for the birds. I hate the birds to be killed. Did
you not see me in this white dress? I saw you fifty yards away.”
</p><p>“Yes, Miss Granger,” he answered, “I saw you.”
</p><p>“And you were going by without speaking to me; it was very rude of
you--what is the matter?”
</p><p>“Not so rude as it was of you to arrange to walk out with me and then to
go and see Mr. Davies instead.”
</p><p>“I could not help it, Mr. Bingham; it was an old engagement, which I had
forgotten.”
</p><p>“Quite so, ladies generally have an excuse for doing what they want to
do.”
</p><p>“It is not an excuse, Mr. Bingham,” Beatrice answered, with dignity;
“there is no need for me to make excuses to you about my movements.”
</p><p>“Of course not, Miss Granger; but it would be more polite to tell me
when you change your mind--next time, you know. However, I have no doubt
that the Castle has attractions for you.”
</p><p>She flashed one look at him and turned to go, and as she did so his
heart relented; he grew ashamed.
</p><p>“Miss Granger, don’t go; forgive me. I do not know what has become of my
manners, I spoke as I should not. The fact is, I was put out at your not
coming. To tell you the honest truth, I missed you dreadfully.”
</p><p>“You missed me. That is very nice of you; one likes to be missed. But,
if you missed me for one afternoon, how will you get on a week hence
when you go away and miss me altogether?”
</p><p>Beatrice spoke in a bantering tone, and laughed as she spoke, but the
laugh ended in something like a sigh. He looked at her for a moment,
looked till she dropped her eyes.
</p><p>“Heaven only knows!” he answered sadly.
</p><p>“Let us go in,” said Beatrice, in a constrained voice; “how chill the
air has turned.”
