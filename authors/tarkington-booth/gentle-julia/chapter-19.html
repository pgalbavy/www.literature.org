<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The next afternoon, about four o'clock, Herbert stood gloomily
at the main entrance of Atwater &amp; Rooter's Newspaper Building
awaiting his partner. The other entrances were not only nailed
fast but massively barricaded; and this one (consisting of the
ancient carriage-house doors, opening upon a driveway through
the yard) had recently been made effective for exclusion. A long
and heavy plank leaned against the wall, near by, ready to be
set in hook-shaped iron supports fastened to the inner sides of
the doors; and when the doors were closed, with this great plank
in place, a person inside the building might seem entitled to
count upon the enjoyment of privacy, except in case of earthquake,
tornado, or fire. In fact, the size of the plank and the substantial
quality of the iron fastenings could be looked upon, from a certain
viewpoint, as a real compliment to the energy and persistence
of Florence Atwater.</p>

<p>Herbert had been in no complimentary frame of mind, however,
when he devised the obstructions, nor was he now in such a frame
of mind. He was pessimistic in regard to his future, and also
embarrassed in anticipation of some explanations it would be necessary
to make to his partner. He strongly hoped that Henry's regular
after-school appearance at the Newspaper Building would precede
Florence's, because these explanations required both deliberation
and tact, and he was convinced that it would be almost impossible
to make them at all if Florence got there first.</p>

<p>He understood that he was unfortunately within her power; and
he saw that it would be dangerous to place in operation for her
exclusion from the Building this new mechanism contrived with
such hopeful care, and at a cost of two dollars and twenty-five
cents taken from the <em>Oriole's</em> treasury. What he wished
Henry to believe was that for some good reason, which Herbert
had not yet been able to invent, it would be better to show Florence
a little politeness. He had a desperate hope that he might find
some diplomatic way to prevail on Henry to be as subservient to
Florence as she had seemed to demand, and he was determined to
touch any extremity of unveracity, rather than permit the details
of his answer in "Truth" to come to his partner's knowledge. Henry
Rooter was not Wallie Torbin; but in possession of material such
as this he could easily make himself intolerable.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was in a flurried state of mind that Herbert waited;
and when his friend appeared, over the fence, his perturbation
was not decreased. He even failed to notice the unusual gravity
of Henry's manner.</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry! I thought I wouldn't start in working till you
got here. I didn't want to haf to come all the way downstairs
again to open the door and hi'st our good ole plank up again."</p>

<p>"I see," said Henry, glancing nervously at their good ole plank.
"Well, I guess Florence'll never get in <em>this</em> good ole
door&mdash;that is, she won't if we don't let her, or something."</p>

<p>This final clause would have astonished Herbert if he had been
less preoccupied with his troubles. "You bet she won't!" he said
mechanically. "She couldn't ever get in here again&mdash;if the <em>family</em>
didn't go intafering around and give me the dickens and everything,
because they think&mdash;they <em>say</em> they do, anyhow&mdash;they say
they think&mdash;they think&#11834;"</p>

<p>He paused, disguising a little choke as a cough of scorn for
the family's thinking.</p>

<p>"What did you say your family think?" Henry asked absently.</p>

<p>"Well, they say we ought to let her have a share in our newspaper."
Again he paused, afraid to continue lest his hypocrisy appear
so bare-faced as to invite suspicion. "Well, maybe we <em>ought</em>,"
he said finally, his eyes guiltily upon his toe, which slowly
scuffed the ground. "I don't say we ought, and I don't say we
oughtn't."</p>

<p>He expected at the least a sharp protest from his partner, who,
on the contrary, surprised him. "Well, that's the way <em>I</em>
look at it," Henry said. "I don't say we ought and I don't say
we oughtn't."</p>

<p>And he, likewise, stared at the toe of a shoe that scuffed the
ground. Herbert felt a little better; this particular subdivision
of his difficulties seemed to be working out with unexpected ease.</p>

<p>"I don't say we will and I don't say we won't," Henry added.
"That's the way I look at it. My father and mother are always
talkin' to me: how I got to be polite and everything, and I guess
maybe it's time I began to pay some 'tention to what they say.
You don't have your father and mother for always, you know, Herbert."</p>

<p>Herbert's mood at once chimed with this unprecedented filial
melancholy. "No, you don't, Henry. That's what I often think about,
myself. No, sir, a fellow doesn't have his father and mother to
advise him our whole life, and you ought to do a good deal what
they say while they're still alive."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," Henry agreed gloomily; and then, without
any alteration of his tone, or of the dejected thoughtfulness
of his attitude, he changed the subject in a way that painfully
startled his companion. "Have you seen Wallie Torbin to-day, Herbert?"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Wallie Torbin to-day?"</p>

<p>Herbert swallowed. "Why, what makes&mdash;what makes you ask me that,
Henry?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'." Henry still kept his eyes upon his gloomily scuffing
toe. "I just wondered, because I didn't happen to see him in school
this afternoon when I happened to look in the door of the Eight-A
when it was open. I didn't want to know on account of anything
particular. I just happened to say that about him because I didn't
have anything else to think about just then, so I just happened
to think about him, the way you do when you haven't got anything
much on your mind and might get to thinkin' about you can't tell
what. That's all the way it was; I just happened to kind of wonder
if he was around anywhere maybe."</p>

<p>Henry's tone was obviously, even elaborately, sincere; and Herbert
was reassured. "Well, I didn't see him," he responded. "Maybe
he's sick."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," his friend said. "Florence said she saw him chasin'
his dog down the street about noon."</p>

<p>At this Herbert's uneasiness was uncomfortably renewed. "<em>Florence</em>
did? Where'd you see Florence?"</p>

<p>Mr. Rooter swallowed. "A little while ago," he said, and again
swallowed. "On the way home from school."</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look here!" Herbert was flurried to the point of panic.
"Henry&mdash;did Florence&mdash;did she go and tell you&mdash;did she tell you&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> didn't hardly notice what she was talkin' about,"
Henry said doggedly. "She didn't have anything to say that <em>I'd</em>
ever care two cents about. She came up behind me and walked along
with me a ways, but I got too many things on my mind to hardly
pay the least attention to anything <em>she</em> ever talks about.
She's a girl what I think about her the less people pay any 'tention
to what she says the better off they are."</p>

<p>"That's the way with me, Henry," his partner assured him earnestly.
"I never pay any notice to what <em>she</em> says. The way I figure
it out about <em>her</em>, Henry, everybody'd be a good deal better
off if nobody ever paid the least notice to anything she says.
I never even notice what she says, myself."</p>

<p>"I don't either," said Henry. "All <em>I</em> think about is
what my father and mother say, because I'm not goin' to have their
advice all the rest o' my life, after they're dead. If they want
me to be polite, why, I'll do it and that's all there is about
it."</p>

<p>"It's the same way with me, Henry. If she comes flappin' around
here blattin' and blubbin' how she's goin' to have somep'n to
do with our newspaper, why, the only reason <em>I'd</em> ever
let her would be because my <em>family</em> say I ought to show
more politeness to her than up to now. I wouldn't do it on any
other account, Henry."</p>

<p>"Neither would I. That's just the same way <em>I</em> look at
it, Herbert. If I ever begin to treat her any better, she's got
my father and mother to thank, not me. That's the only reason
<em>I'd</em> be willing to say we better leave the plank down
and let her in, if she comes around here like she's liable to."</p>

<p>"Well," said Herbert. "<em>I'm</em> willing. I don't want to
get in trouble with the family."</p>

<p>And they mounted the stairs to their editorial, reportorial,
and printing rooms; and began to work in a manner not only preoccupied
but apprehensive. At intervals they would give each other a furtive
glance, and then seem to reflect upon their fathers' and mothers'
wishes and the troublous state of the times. Florence did not
keep them waiting long, however.</p>

<p>She might have been easier to bear had her manner of arrival
been less assured. She romped up the stairs, came skipping across
the old floor, swinging her hat by a ribbon, flung open the gate
in the sacred railing, and, flouncing into the principal chair,
immodestly placed her feet on the table in front of that chair.
Additionally, such was her lively humour, she affected to light
and smoke the stub of a lead pencil. "Well, men," she said heartily,
"I don't want to see any loafin' around here, men. I expect I'll
have a pretty good newspaper this week; yes, sir, a pretty good
newspaper, and I guess you men got to jump around a good deal
to do everything I think of, or else maybe I guess I'll have to
turn you off. I don't want to haf to do that, men."</p>

<p>The blackmailed partners made no reply, on account of an inability
that was perfect for the moment. They stared at her helplessly,
though not kindly; for in their expressions the conflict between
desire and policy was almost staringly vivid. And such was their
preoccupation, each with the bitterness of his own case, that
neither wondered at the other's strange complaisance.</p>

<p>Florence made it clear to them that henceforth she was the editor
of <em>The North End Daily Oriole</em>. (She said she had decided
not to change the name.) She informed them that they were to be
her printers; she did not care to get all inky and nasty herself,
she said. She would, however, do all the writing for her newspaper,
and had with her a new poem. Also, she would furnish all the news
and it would be printed just as she wrote it, and printed <em>nicely</em>,
too, or else-&mdash;She left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>Thus did this cool hand take possession of an established industry,
and in much the same fashion did she continue to manage it. There
were unsuppressible protests; there was covert anguish; there
was even a strike&mdash;but it was a short one. When the printers remained
away from their late Newspaper Building, on Wednesday afternoon,
Florence had an interview with Herbert after dinner at his own
door. He explained coldly that Henry and he had grown tired of
the printing-press and had decided to put in all their spare time
building a theatre in Henry's attic; but Florence gave him to
understand that the theatre could not be; she preferred the <em>Oriole</em>.</p>

<p>Henry and Herbert had both stopped "speaking" to Patty Fairchild,
for each believed her treacherous to himself; but Florence now
informed Herbert that far from depending on mere hearsay, she
had in her own possession the confession of his knowledge that
he had ocular beauty; that she had discovered the paper where
Patty had lost it; and that it was now in a secure place, and
in an envelope, upon the outside of which was already written,
"For Wallie Torbin. Kindness of Florence A."</p>

<p>Herbert surrendered.</p>

<p>So did Henry Rooter, a little later that evening, after a telephoned
conversation with the slave-driver.</p>

<p>Therefore, the two miserable printers were back in their places
the next afternoon. They told each other that the theatre they
had planned wasn't so much after all; and anyhow your father and
mother didn't last all your life, and it was better to do what
they wanted, and be polite while they were alive.</p>

<p>And on Saturday the new <em>Oriole</em>, now in every jot and
item the inspired organ of feminism, made its undeniably sensational
appearance.</p>

<p>A copy, neatly folded, was placed in the hand of Noble Dill,
as he set forth for his place of business, after lunching at home
with his mother. Florence was the person who placed it there;
she came hurriedly from somewhere in the neighbourhood, out of
what yard or alley he did not notice, and slipped the little oblong
sheet into his lax fingers.</p>

<p>"There!" she said breathlessly. "There's a good deal about you
in it this week, Mr. Dill, and I guess &mdash;I guess&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What, Florence?"</p>

<p>"I guess maybe you'll&#11834;" She looked up at him shyly; then,
with no more to say, turned and ran back in the direction whence
she had come. Noble walked on, not at once examining her little
gift, but carrying it absently in fingers still lax at the end
of a dangling arm. There was no life in him for anything. Julia
was away.</p>

<p>Away! And yet the dazzling creature looked at him from sky, from
earth, from air; looked at him with the most poignant kindness,
yet always shook her head! She had answered his first letter by
a kind little note, his second by a kinder and littler one, and
his third, fourth, fifth, and sixth by no note at all; but by
the kindest message (through one of her aunts) that she was thinking
about him a great deal. And even this was three weeks ago. Since
then from Julia&mdash;nothing at all!</p>

<p>But yesterday something a little stimulating had happened. On
the street, downtown, he had come face to face, momentarily, with
Julia's father; and for the first time in Noble's life Mr. Atwater
nodded to him pleasantly. Noble went on his way, elated. Was there
not something almost fatherly in this strange greeting?</p>

<p>An event so singular might be interpreted in the happiest way:
What had Julia written her father, to change him so toward Noble?
And Noble was still dreamily interpreting as he walked down the
street with <em>The North End Daily Oriole</em> idle in an idle
hand.</p>

<p>He found a use for that hand presently, and, having sighed, lifted
it to press it upon his brow, but did not complete the gesture.
As his hand came within the scope of his gaze, levelled on the
unfathomable distance, he observed that the fingers held a sheet
of printed paper; and he remembered Florence. Instead of pressing
his brow he unfolded the journal she had thrust upon him. As he
began to read, his eye was lustreless, his gait slack and dreary;
but soon his whole demeanour changed, it cannot be said for the
better.</p>

My Soul by Florence Atwater

</p>
<p>
When my heart is dreary<br/>
Then my soul is weary<br/>
As a bird with a broken wing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who never again will sing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sound of a vast amen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes from a church of men.

</p>
<p>
When my soul is dreary<br/>
It could never be cheery<br/>
But I think of myideal<br/>
And everything seems real<br/>
Like the sound of the bright church bells peal.
