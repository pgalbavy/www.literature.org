<p>On every highway, across every wood trail, footpath, and meadow
streamed the wreckage of seven battle-fields.  Through mud and
rain crowded heavy artillery, waggons, herds of bellowing cattle,
infantry, light batteries, exhausted men, wounded men, dead men
on stretchers, men in straw-filled carts, some alive, some dying.
Cannoneers cut traces and urged their jaded horses through the
crush, cursed and screamed at by those on foot, menaced by bayonets
and sabres.  The infantry, drenched, starving, plastered with
mud to the waists, toiled doggedly on through the darkness; batteries
in deplorable condition struggled from mud hole to mud hole; the
reserve cavalry division, cut out and forced east, limped wearily
ahead, its rear-guard firing at every step.</p>

<p>To the north, immense quantities of stores&mdash;clothing, provisions,
material of every description were on fire, darkening the sky
with rolling, inky clouds; an entire army corps with heavy artillery
and baggage crossed the river enveloped in the pitchy, cinder-laden
smoke from two bridges on fire.  The forests, which had been felled
from the Golden Farm to Fair Oaks to form an army's vast abattis,
were burning in sections, sending roaring tornadoes of flame into
rifle pits, redoubts, and abandoned fortifications.  Cannon thundered
at Ellison's Mills; shells rained hard on Gaines's Farm; a thousand
simultaneous volleys of musketry mingled with the awful uproar
of the cannon; uninterrupted sheets of light from the shells brightened
the smoke pall like the continuous flare of electricity against
a thundercloud.  The Confederacy, victorious, was advancing wrapped
in flame and smoke.</p>

<p>At Savage's Station the long railroad bridge was now on fire;
trains and locomotives burned fiercely; millions of boxes of hard
bread, barrels of flour, rice, sugar, coffee, salt pork, cases
of shoes, underclothing, shirts, uniforms, tin-ware, blankets,
ponchos, harness, medical stores, were in flames; magazines of
ammunition, flat cars and box cars loaded with powder, shells,
and cartridges blazed and exploded, hurling jets and spouting
fountains of fire to the very zenith.</p>

<p>And through the White Oak Swamp rode the Commander-in-chief of
an army in full retreat, followed by his enormous staff and escort,
abandoning the siege of Richmond, and leaving to their fate the
wretched mass of sick and wounded in the dreadful hospitals at
Liberty Hall.  And the red battle flags of the Southland fluttered
on every hill.</p>

<p>Claymore's mixed brigade, still holding together, closed the
rear of Porter's powder-scorched <em>corps d'armee</em>.</p>

<p>The Zouaves of the 3rd Regiment&mdash;what was left of them&mdash;marched
as flankers; McDunn's battery, still intact, was forced to unlimber
every few rods; and the pouring rain turned to a driving golden
fire in the red glare of the guns, which lighted up the halted
squadrons of the Lancers ranged always in support.</p>

<p>Every rod in retreat was a running combat.  In the darkness the
discharge of the Zouaves' rifles ran from the guns' muzzles like
streams of molten metal spilling out on the grass.  McDunn's guns
spirted great lumps of incandescence; the fuses of the shells
in the sky showered the darkness with swarming sparks.</p>

<p>Toward ten o'clock the harried column halted on a hill and bivouacked
without fires, food, or shelter.  The Zouaves slept on their arms
in the drenched herbage; the Lancers, not daring to unsaddle,
lay down on the grass under their patient horses, bridle tied
to wrist.  An awful anxiety clutched officers and men.  Few slept;
the ceaseless and agonised shrieking from an emergency hospital
somewhere near them in the darkness almost unnerved them.</p>

<p>At dawn shells began to plunge downward among the Dragoons. McDunn's
battery roused itself to reply, but muddy staff-officers arrived
at full speed with orders for Claymore to make haste; and the
starving command staggered off stiffly through the mud, their
ears sickened by the piteous appeals of the wounded begging not
to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Berkley, his face a mass of bloody rags, gazed from his wet saddle
with feverish eyes at the brave contract surgeons standing silent
amid their wounded under the cedar trees.</p>

<p>Cripples hobbled along the lines, beseeching, imploring, catching
at stirrups, plucking feebly, blindly at the horses' manes for
support.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" sobbed a wounded artilleryman, lifting himself
from the blood-stained grass, "is this what I enlisted for?  Are
you boys going to leave us behind to rot in rebel prisons?"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" shrieked another, "you ain't licked!  What'n hell
are you runnin' away for?  Gimme a gun an' a hoss an' I'll go
back with you to the river!"</p>

<p>And another pointed a mangled and shaking hand at the passing
horsemen.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" he sneered, "we don't expect anything of the cavalry,
but why are them Zouaves skedaddlin'?  They fit like wild cats
at the river.  Halt! you red-legged devils.  You're goin' the
wrong way!"</p>

<p>A Sister of Charity, her snowy, wide-winged headdress limp in
the rain, came out of a shed and stood at the roadside, slender
hands joined imploringly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't leave your own wounded," she kept repeating.  "You
wouldn't do that, gentlemen, would you?  They've behaved so well;
they've done all that they could.  Won't somebody tell General
McClellan how brave they were?  If he knew, he would never leave
them here."</p>

<p>The Lancers looked down at her miserably as they rode; Colonel
Arran passed her, saluting, but with heavy, flushed face averted;
Berkley, burning with fever, leaned from his saddle, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"We can't help it, Sister.  The same thing may happen to us in
an hour.  But we'll surely come back; you never must doubt that!"</p>

<p>Farther on they came on a broken-down ambulance, the mules gone,
several dead men half buried in the wet straw, and two Sisters
of Charity standing near by in pallid despair.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran offered them lead-horses, but they were timid and
frightened; and Burgess gave his horse to the older one, and Berkley
took the other up behind him, where she sat sideways clutching
his belt, white coiffe aflutter, feet dangling.</p>

<p>At noon the regiment halted for forage and rations procured from
a waggon train which had attempted to cross their line of march. 
The rain ceased: a hot sun set their drenched clothing and their
horses' flanks steaming.  At two o'clock they resumed their route;
the ragged, rain-blackened pennons on the lance heads dried out
scarlet; a hot breeze set in, carrying with it the distant noise
of battle.</p>

<p>All that afternoon the heavy sound of the cannonade jarred their
ears.  And at sunset it had not ceased.</p>

<p>Berkley's Sister of Charity clung to his belt in silence for
a while.  After a mile or two she began to free her mind in regard
to the distressing situation of her companion and herself.  She
informed Berkley that the negro drivers had become frightened
and had cut the traces and galloped off; that she and the other
Sister were on their way to the new base at Azalea Court House,
where thousands of badly wounded were being gathered from the
battles of the last week, and where conditions were said to be
deplorable, although the hospital boats had been taking the sick
to Alexandria as fast as they could be loaded.</p>

<p>She was a gentle little thing, with ideas of her own concerning
the disaster to the army which was abandoning thousands of its
wounded to the charity and the prisons of an enemy already too
poor to feed and clothe its own.</p>

<p>"Some of our Sisters stayed behind, and many of the medical staff
and even the contract surgeons remained.  I hope the rebels will
be gentle with them.  I expected to stay, but Sister Aurelienne
and I were ordered to Azalea last night.  I almost cried my eyes
out when I left our wounded.  The shells were coming into the
hospital yesterday, and one of them killed two of our wounded
in the straw. Oh, it was sad and terrible.  I am sure the rebels
didn't fire on us on purpose.  Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't.  Were you frightened, Sister."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said naively, "and I wished I could run into the
woods and hide."</p>

<p>"But you didn't?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I couldn't," she said, surprised.</p>

<p>The fever in his wound was making him light-headed.  At intervals
he imagined that it was Ailsa seated behind him, her arms around
his waist, her breath cool and fragrant on his neck; and still
he knew she was a phantom born of fever, and dared not speak&mdash;became
sly, pretending he did not know her lest the spell break and she
vanish into thin air again.</p>

<p>What the little sister said was becoming to him only a pretty
confusion of soft sounds; at moments he was too deaf to hear her
voice at all; then he heard it and still believed it to be Ailsa
who was speaking; then, for a, few seconds, reality cleared his
clouded senses; he heard the steady thunder of the cannonade,
the steady clattering splash of his squadron; felt the hot, dry
wind scorching his stiffened cheek and scalp where the wound burned
and throbbed under a clotted bandage.</p>

<p>When the regiment halted to fill canteens the little sister washed
and re-bandaged his face and head.</p>

<p>It was a ragged slash running from the left ear across the cheek-bone
and eyebrow into the hair above the temple&mdash;a deep, swollen, angry
wound.</p>

<p>"What <em>were</em> you doing when you got this?" she asked in
soft consternation, making him as comfortable as possible with
the scanty resources of her medical satchel.  Later, when the
bugles sounded, she came back from somewhere down the line, suffered
him to lift her up behind him, settled herself, slipped both arms
confidently around his waist, and said:</p>

<p>"So you are the soldier who took the Confederate battle flag? 
Why didn't you tell me?  Ah &mdash;I know.  The bravest never
tell."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell," he replied.   "They captured a guidon
from us.  It evens the affair."</p>

<p>She said, after a moment's thought; "It speaks well for a man
to have his comrades praise him as yours praise you."</p>

<p>"You mean the trooper Burgess," he said wearily.  "He's always
chattering."</p>

<p>"All who spoke to me praised you," she observed.  "Your colonel
said: 'He does not understand what fear is.  He is absolutely
fearless.'"</p>

<p>"My colonel has been misinformed, Sister.  I am intelligent enough
to be afraid&mdash;philosopher enough to realise that it doesn't help
me.  So nowadays I just go ahead."</p>

<p>"Trusting in God," she murmured.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Is it not true, soldier?"</p>

<p>But the fever was again transfiguring her into the shape of Ailsa
Paige, and he remained shyly silent, fearing to disturb the vision&mdash;yet
knowing vaguely that it was one.</p>

<p>She sighed; later, in silence, she repeated some Credos and Hail
Marys, her eyes fixed on space, the heavy cannonade dinning in
her ears.  All around her rode the Lancers, tall pennoned weapons
swinging from stirrup and loop, bridles loose under their clasped
hands.  The men seemed stupefied with fatigue; yet every now and
then they roused themselves to inquire after her comfort or to
offer her a place behind them.  She timidly asked Berkley if she
tired him, but he begged her to stay, alarmed lest the vision
of Ailsa depart with her; and she remained, feeling contented
and secure in her drowsy fatigue.  Colonel Arran dropped back
from the head of the column once to ride beside her.  He questioned
her kindly; spoke to Berkley, also, asking with grave concern
about his wound.  And Berkley answered in his expressionless way
that he did not suffer.</p>

<p>But the little Sister of Charity behind his back laid one finger
across her lips and looked significantly at Colonel Arran; and
when the colonel again rode to the head of the weary column his
face seemed even graver and more careworn.</p>

<p>By late afternoon they were beyond sound of the cannonade, riding
through a golden light between fields of stacked wheat.  Far behind
in the valley they could see the bayonets of the Zouaves glistening;
farther still the declining sun glimmered on the guns of the 10th
battery.  Along a parallel road endless lines of waggons stretched
from north to south, escorted by Egerton's Dragoons.</p>

<p>To Berkley the sunset world had become only an infernal pit of
scarlet strung with raw nerves.  The terrible pain in his face
and head almost made him lose consciousnesss.  Later he seemed
to be drifting into a lurid sea of darkness, where he no longer
felt his saddle or the movement of his horse; he scarcely saw
the lanterns clustering, scarcely heard the increasing murmur
around him, the racket of picket firing, the noise of many bewildered
men, the cries of staff-officers directing divisions and brigades
to their camping ground, the confused tumult which grew nearer,
nearer, mounting like the ominous clamour of the sea as the regiment
rode through Azalea under the July stars.</p>

<p>He might have fallen from his saddle; or somebody perhaps lifted
him, for all he knew.  In the glare of torches he found himself
lying on a moving stretcher.  After that he felt straw under him;
and vaguely wondered why it did not catch fire from his body,
which surely now was but a mass of smouldering flame.</p>

<p>For days the fever wasted him&mdash;not entirely, for at intervals
he heard cannon, and always the interminable picket firing; and
he heard bugles, too, and recognised the various summons.  But
it was no use trying to obey them&mdash;no use trying to find his legs. 
He could not get up without his legs&mdash;he laughed weakly at the
thought; then, drowsy, indifferent, decided that they had been
shot away, but could not remember when; and it bothered him a
good deal.</p>

<p>Other things bothered him; he was convinced that his mother was
in the room.  At intervals he was aware of Hallam's handsome face,
cut out like a paper picture from <em>Harper's Weekly</em> and
pasted flat on the tent wall.  Also there were too many fire zouaves
around his bed&mdash;if it was a bed, this vague vibrating hammock
he occupied.  It was much more like a hollow nook inside a gigantic
pendulum which swung eternally to and fro until it swung him into
senselessness&mdash;or aroused him with fierce struggles to escape.
But his mother's slender hand sometimes arrested the maddening
motion, or&mdash;and this was curiously restful&mdash;she cleverly transferred
him to a cradle, which she rocked, leaning close over him.  Only
she kept him wrapped up too warmly.</p>

<p>And after a long while there came a day when his face became
cooler, and his skin grew wet with sweat; and on that day he partly
unclosed his eyes and saw Colonel Arran sitting beside him.</p>

<p>Surprised, he attempted to sit up, but not a muscle of his body
obeyed him, and he lay there stupid, inert, hollow eyes fixed
meaninglessly on his superior, who spoke cautiously.</p>

<p>"Berkley, do you know me?"</p>

<p>His lips twitched a voiceless affirmative.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran said: "You are going to get well, now. . . .  Get
well quickly, because&mdash;the regiment misses you. . . .  What is
it you desire to say?  Make the effort if you wish."</p>

<p>Berkley's sunken eyes remained focussed on space; he was trying
to consider.  Then they turned painfully toward Colonel Arran
again.</p>

<p>"Ailsa Paige?" he whispered.</p>

<p>The other said quietly: "She is at the base hospital near Azalea.
I have seen her.  She is well. . . .  I did not tell her you were
ill.  She could not have left anyway. . . .  Matters are not going
well with the army, Berkley."</p>

<p>"Whipped?"  His lips barely formed the question.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran's careworn features flushed.</p>

<p>"The army has been withdrawing from the Peninsula.  It is the
commander-in-chief who has been defeated&mdash;not the Army of the
Potomac."</p>

<p>"Back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly we shall go back.  This rebellion seems to be
taking more time to extinguish than the people and the national
authorities supposed it would require.  But no man must doubt
our ultimate success.  I do not doubt it.  I never shall.  You
must not.  It will all come right in the end."</p>

<p>"Regiment?" whispered Berkley.</p>

<p>"The regiment is in better shape, Berkley.  Our remounts have
arrived; our wounded are under shelter, and comfortable.  We need
rest, and we're getting it here at Azalea, although they shell
us every day.  We ought to be in good trim in a couple of weeks.
You'll be in the saddle long before that.  Your squadron has become
very proud of you; all the men in the regiment have inquired about
you.  Private Burgess spends his time off duty under the oak trees
out yonder watching your window like a dog. . . .  <em>I&mdash;</em>ah&mdash;may
say to you, Berkley, that you&mdash;ah&mdash;have become a credit to the
regiment.  Personally&mdash;and as your commanding officer &mdash;I
wish you to understand that I am gratified by your conduct.  I
have said so in my official reports."</p>

<p>Berkley's sunken eyes had reverted to the man beside him.  After
a moment his lips moved again in soundless inquiry.</p>

<p>Colonel Arran replied: "The Zouaves were very badly cut up; Major
Lent was wounded by a sabre cut.  He is nearly well now.  Colonel
Craig and his son were not hurt.  The Zouaves are in cantonment
about a mile to the rear.  Both Colonel Craig and his son have
been here to see you&mdash;" he hesitated, rose, stood a moment undecided.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Craig&mdash;the wife of Colonel Craig&mdash;has been here.  Her plantation,
Paigecourt, is in this vicinity I believe.  She has requested
the medical authorities to send you to her house for your convalescence. 
Do you wish to go?"</p>

<p>The hollow-eyed, heavily bandaged face looked up at him from
the straw; and Colonel Arran looked down at it, lips aquiver.</p>

<p>"Berkley&mdash;if you go there, I shall not see you again until you
return to the regiment.  <em>I&mdash;" </em>suddenly his gray face
began to twitch again&mdash;and he set his jaw savagely to control
it.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said. . .  "I wish&mdash;some day&mdash;you could try to
think less harshly of me.  I am a&mdash;very&mdash;lonely man."</p>

<p>Berkley closed his eyes, but whether from weakness or sullen
resentment the older man could not know.  He stood looking down
wistfully at the boy for a moment, then turned and went heavily
away with blurred eyes that did not recognise the woman in bonnet
and light summer gown who was entering the hospital tent.  As
he stood aside to let her pass he heard his name pronounced, in
a cold, decisive voice; and, passing his gloved hand across his
eyes to clear them, recognised Celia Craig.</p>

<p>"Colonel Arran," she said coolly, "is it necessa'y fo' me to
request yo' permission befo' I am allowed to move Philip Berkley
to my own house?"</p>

<p>"No, madam.  The brigade surgeon is in charge.  But I think I
can secure for you the necessary authority to do so if you wish."</p>

<p>She thanked him haughtily, and passed on; and he turned and walked
out, impassive, silent, a stoop to his massive shoulders which
had already become characteristic.</p>

<p>And that evening Berkley lay at Paigecourt in the chintz-hung
chamber where, as a girl, his mother had often slept, dreaming
the dreams that haunt young hearts when the jasmine fragrance
grows heavier in the stillness and the magnolia's snowy chalice
is offered to the moon, and the thrush sings in the river thickets,
and the fire-fly's lamp drifts through the fairy woods.</p>

<p>Celia told him this on the third day, late in the afternoon&mdash;so
late that the westering sun was already touching the crests of
the oak woods, and all the thickets had turned softly purple like
the bloom on a plum; the mounting scent of phlox from the garden
was growing sweeter, and the bats fluttered and dipped and soared
in the calm evening sky.</p>

<p>She had been talking of his mother when she was Constance Paige
and wore a fillet over her dark ringlets and rode to hounds at
ten with the hardest riders in all Prince Clarence County.</p>

<p>"And this was her own room, Phil; nothing in it has been moved,
nothing changed; this is the same bird and garland chintz, matching
the same wall-paper; this is the same old baid with its fo' ca'ved
columns and its faded canopy, the same gilt mirror where she looked
and saw reflected there the loveliest face in all the valley.
. . . A child's face, Phil&mdash;even a child's face when she drew
aside her bridal veil to look. . . .  Ah &mdash;God&mdash;" She sighed,
looking down at her clasped hands, "if youth but knew&mdash;if youth
but knew!"</p>

<p>He lay silent, the interminable rattle of picket firing in his
ears, his face turned toward the window.  Through it he could
see green grass, a magnolia in bloom, and a long flawless spray
of Cherokee roses pendant from the gallery.</p>

<p>Celia sighed, waited for him to speak, sighed again, and picked
up the Baltimore newspaper to resume her reading if he desired.</p>

<p>Searching the columns listlessly, she scanned the headings, glanced
over the letter press in silence, then turned the crumpled page.
Presently she frowned.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, Philip; they say that there is yellow fever
among the Yankee troops in Louisiana.  It would be like them to
bring that horror into the Ca'linas and Virginia&#11834;"</p>

<p>He turned his head suddenly, partly rose from where he lay; and
she caught her breath and bent swiftly over him, placing one hand
on his arm and gently forcing him down upon the-pillow again.</p>

<p>"Fo'give me, dear," she faltered.  "I forgot what I was reading&#11834;"</p>

<p>He said, thoughtfully: "Did you ever hear exactly how my mother
died, Celia? . . .  But I know you never did. . . .  And I think
I had better tell you."</p>

<p>"She died in the fever camp at Silver Bayou, when you were a
little lad," whispered Celia.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Philip!  What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"You don't know how my mother died," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Phil, we had the papers&mdash;and the Governor of Louisiana wrote
us himse'f&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know what he wrote and what the papers published was not true.
I'll tell you how she died.  When I was old enough to take care
of myself I went to Silver Bayou. . . .  Many people in that town
had died; some still survived.  I found the parish records.  I
found one of the camp doctors who remembered that accursed year
of plague&mdash;an old man, withered, indifferent, sleeping his days
away on the rotting gallery of his tumble-down house.  <em>He</em>
knew. . . . And I found some of the militia still surviving; and
one among them retained a confused memory of my mother&mdash;among
the horrors of that poisonous year&#11834;"</p>

<p>He lay silent, considering; then: "I was old enough to remember,
but not old enough to understand what I understood later. . .
.  Do you want to know how my mother died?"</p>

<p>Celia's lips moved in amazed assent.</p>

<p>"Then I will tell you. . . .  They had guards north, east, and
west of us.  They had gone mad with fright; the whole land was
quarantined against us; musket, flintlock, shotgun, faced us through
the smoke of their burning turpentine.  I was only a little lad,
but the horror of it I have never forgotten, nor my mother's terror&mdash;not
for herself, for me."</p>

<p>He lay on his side, thin hands clasped, looking not at Celia
but beyond her at the dreadful scene his fancy was painting on
the wall of his mother's room:</p>

<p>"Often, at night, we heard the shots along the dead line.  Once
they murdered a man behind our water garden.  Our negroes moaned
and sobbed all day, all night, helpless, utterly demoralised. 
Two were shot swimming; one came back dying from snake bite. 
I saw him dead on the porch.</p>

<p>"I saw men fall down in the street with the black vomit&mdash;women,
also&mdash;and once I saw two little children lying dead against a
garden wall in St. Catharine's Alley.  I was young, but I remember."</p>

<p>A terrible pallor came into his wan face.</p>

<p>"And I remember my mother," he said; "and her pleading with the
men who came to the house to let her send me across the river
where there was no fever.  I remember her saying that it was murder
to imprison children there in Silver Bayou; that I was perfectly
well so far.  They refused.  Soldiers came and went.  Their captain
died; others died, we heard.  Then my mother's maid, Alice, an
octoroon, died on the East Gallery.  And the quarters went insane
that day.</p>

<p>"When night came an old body-servant of my grandfather scratched
at mother's door.  I heard him.  I thought it was Death.  I was
half dead with terror when mother awoke and whispered to me to
dress in the dark and to make no sound.</p>

<p>"I remember it perfectly&mdash;remember saying: 'I won't go if you
don't, mother.  I'd rather be with you.'  And I remember her saying:
'You shall not stay here to die when you are perfectly well. 
Trust mother, darling; Jerry will take you to Sainte Jacqueline
in a boat.'</p>

<p>"And after that it is vaguer&mdash;the garden, the trench dug under
the north wall&mdash;and how mother and I, in deadly fear of moccasins,
down on all fours, crept after Jerry along the ditch to the water's
edge&#11834;"</p>

<p>His face whitened again; he lay silent for a while, crushing
his wasted hands together.</p>

<p>"Celia, they fired on us from the levee.  After that I don't
know; I never knew what happened.  But that doctor at Silver Bayou
said that I was found a mile below in a boat with the first marks
of the plague yellowing my skin.  Celia, they never found my mother's
body.  It is not true that she died of fever at Silver Bayou. 
She fell under the murderous rifles of the levee guard&mdash;gave her
life trying to save me from that pest-stricken prison.  Jerry's
body was found stranded in the mud twenty miles below.  He had
been shot through the body. . . .  And now you know how my mother
died."</p>

<p>He raised himself on one elbow, watching Celia's shocked white
face for a moment or two, then wearily turned toward the window
and sank back on his pillows.</p>

<p>In the still twilight, far away through the steady fusillade
from the outposts, he heard the dull boom-booming of cannon, and
the heavy shocks of the great guns aboard the Union gun-boats. 
But it sounded very far off; a mocking-bird sang close under his
window; the last rosy bar faded from the fleecy cloud bank in
the east. Night came abruptly&mdash;the swift Southern darkness quickly
emblazoned with stars; and the whip-poor-wills began their ghostly
calling; and the spectres of the mist crept stealthily inland.</p>

<p>"Celia?"</p>

<p>Her soft voice answered from the darkness near him.</p>

<p>He said: "I knew this was her room before you told me.  I have
seen her several times."</p>

<p>"Good God, Phil!" she faltered, "what are you saying?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. . . .  I saw her the night I came here."</p>

<p>After a long silence Celia rose and lighted a candle.  Holding
it a little above her pallid face she glided to his bedside and
looked down at him.  After a moment, bending, she touched his
face with her palm; then her cool finger-tips brushed the quiet
pulse at his wrist.</p>

<p>"Have I any fever?"</p>

<p>"No, Phil."</p>

<p>"I thought not. . . .  I saw mother's face a few moments ago
in that mirror behind you."</p>

<p>Celia sank down on the bed's edge, the candle trembling in her
hand.  Then, slowly, she turned her head and looked over her shoulder,
moving cautiously, until her fascinated eyes found the glass behind
her.  The mirror hung there reflecting the flowered wall opposite;
a corner of the bed; nothing else.</p>

<p>He said in an even voice;</p>

<p>"From the first hour that you brought me into this room, she
has been here.  I knew it instantly. . . .  The first day she
was behind those curtains&mdash;was there a long while.  I knew she
was there; I watched the curtains, expecting her to step out. 
I waited all day, not understanding that <em>I&mdash;</em>that it was
better that I should speak.  I fell asleep about dusk.  She came
out then and sat where you are sitting."</p>

<p>"It was a dream, Phil.  It was fever.  Try to realise what you
are saying!"</p>

<p>"I do.  The next evening I lay watching; and I saw a figure reflected
in the mirror.  It was not yet dusk.  Celia, in the sunset light
I saw her standing by the curtains.  But it was star-light before
she came to the bed and looked down at me.</p>

<p>"I said very quietly: 'Mother dear!'  <em>Then</em> she spoke
to me; and I knew she was speaking, but I could not hear her voice.
. . .  It was that way while she stood beside me &mdash;I could
not hear her, Celia.  I could not hear what she was saying.  It
was no spirit I saw&mdash;no phantom from the dead there by my bed,
no ghost&mdash;no restless wraith, grave-driven through the night. 
I believe she is living.  She knows I believe it. . . .  As you
sat here, a moment ago, reading to me, I saw her reflected for
a moment in the mirror behind you, passing into the room beyond. 
Her hair is perfectly white, Celia&mdash;or," he said vaguely to himself,
"was it something she wore?&mdash;like the bandeaux of the Sisters
of Charity&#11834;"</p>

<p>The lighted candle fell from Celia's nerveless fingers and rolled
over and over across the floor, trailing a smoking wick.  Berkley's
hand steadied her trembling arm.</p>

<p>"Why are you frightened?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing dead about what I saw."</p>

<p>"I c-can't he'p myse'f," stammered Celia; "you say such frightful
things to me&mdash;you tell me that they happen in my own house&mdash;in
<em>her</em> own room &mdash;How can I be calm?  How can I believe
such things of&mdash;of Constance Berkley&mdash;of yo' daid mother&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said dully.</p>

<p>The star-light sparkled on the silver candle-stick where it lay
on the floor in a little pool of wax.  Quivering all over, Celia
stooped to lift, relight it, and set it on the table.  And, over
her shoulder, he saw a slim shape enter the doorway.</p>

<p>"Mother dear?" he whispered.</p>

<p>And Celia turned with a cry and stood swaying there in the rays
of the candle.</p>

<p>But it was only a Sister of Charity&mdash;a slim, childish figure
under the wide white head-dress&mdash;who had halted, startled at Celia's
cry. She was looking for the Division Medical Director, and the
sentries had misinformed her&mdash;and she was very sorry, very deeply
distressed to have frightened anybody&mdash;but the case was urgent&mdash;a
Sister shot near the picket line on Monday; and authority to send
her North was, what she had come to seek.  Because the Sister
had lost her mind completely, had gone insane, and no longer knew
them, knew nobody, not even herself, nor the hospital, nor the
doctors, nor even that she lay on a battle-field.  And she was
saying strange and dreadful things about herself and about people
nobody had ever heard of. . . .  Could anybody tell her where
the Division Medical Director could be found?</p>

<p>It was not yet daybreak when Berkley awoke in his bed to find
lights in the room and medical officers passing swiftly hither
and thither, the red flames from their candles blowing smokily
in the breezy doorways.</p>

<p>The picket firing along the river had not ceased.  At the same
instant he felt the concussion of heavy guns shaking his bed. 
The lawn outside the drawn curtains resounded with the hurrying
clatter of waggons, the noise of pick and spade and crack of hammer
and mallet.</p>

<p>He drew himself to a sitting posture.  A regimental surgeon passing
through the room glanced at him humorously, saying: "You've got
a pretty snug berth here, son.  How does it feel to sleep in a
real bed?" And, extinguishing his candle, he went away through
the door without waiting for any answer.</p>

<p>Berkley turned toward the window, striving to reach the drawn
curtains.  And at length he managed to part them, but it was all
dark outside.  Yet the grounds were evidently crowded with waggons
and men; he recognised sounds which indicated that tents were
being erected, drains and sinks dug; the rattle of planks and
boards were significant of preparation for the construction of
"shebangs."</p>

<p>Farther away on the dark highway he could hear the swift gallop
of cavalry and the thudding clank of light batteries, all passing
in perfect darkness.  Then, leaning closer to the sill, he gazed
between the curtains far into the southwest; and saw the tall
curve of Confederate shells traced in whirling fire far down the
river, the awful glare of light as the enormous guns on the Union
warships replied.</p>

<p>Celia, her lovely hair over her shoulders, a scarf covering her
night-dress, came in carrying a lighted candle; and instantly
a voice from outside the window bade her extinguish the light
or draw the curtain.</p>

<p>She looked at Berkley in a startled manner, blew out the flame,
and came around between his bed and the window, drawing the curtains
entirely aside.</p>

<p>"General Claymore's staff has filled eve'y room in the house
except yours and mine," she said in her gentle, bewildered way. 
"There's a regiment &mdash;Curt's Zouaves&mdash;encamped befo' the
west quarters, and a battery across the drive, and all the garden
is full of their horses and caissons."</p>

<p>"Poor little Celia," he said, reaching out to touch her hand,
and drawing her to the bed's edge, where she sat down helplessly.</p>

<p>"The Yankee officers are all over the house," she repeated. "They're
up in the cupola with night-glasses now.  They are ve'y polite. 
Curt took off his riding boots and went to sleep on my bed&mdash;and
oh he is so dirty!&mdash;my darling Curt' my own husband!&mdash;too dirty
to touch!  I could cry just to look at his uniform, all black
and stained and the gold entirely gone from one sleeve!  And Stephen!&mdash;oh,
Phil, some mise'ble barber has shaved the heads of all the Zouaves,
and Steve is perfectly disfigured!&mdash;the poor, dear boy"&mdash;she laughed
hysterically&mdash;"he had a hot bath and I've been mending the rags
that he and Curt call unifo'ms&mdash;and I found clean flannels fo'
them both in the attic&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> does all this mean&mdash;all this camping outside?"
he interrupted gently.</p>

<p>"Curt doesn't know.  The camps and hospitals west of us have
been shelled, and all the river roads are packed full of ambulances
and stretchers going east."</p>

<p>"Where is my regiment?"</p>

<p>"The Lancers rode away yesterday with General Stoneman&mdash;all except
haidqua'ters and one squadron&mdash;yours, I think&mdash;and they are acting
escort to General Sykes at the overseers house beyond the oak
grove.  Your colonel is on his staff, I believe."</p>

<p>He lay silent, watching the burning fuses of the shells as they
soared up into the night, whirling like fiery planets on their
axes, higher, higher, mounting through majestic altitudes to the
pallid stars, then, curving, falling faster, faster, till their
swift downward glare split the darkness into broad sheets of light.</p>

<p>"Phil," she whispered, "I think there is a house on fire across
the river!"</p>

<p>Far away in the darkness rows of tiny windows in an unseen mansion
had suddenly become brilliantly visible.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it must be Mr. Ruffin's house," she said in an awed voice.
"Oh, Phil!  It <em>is</em>!  Look!  It's all on fire&mdash;it's&mdash;oh,
see the flames on the roof! This is terrible&mdash;terrible&mdash;" She
caught her breath.</p>

<p>"Phil! There's another house on fire!  Do you see&mdash;do you <em>see</em>!
It's Ailsa's house &mdash;Marye-mead!  Oh, how could they set
it on fire&mdash;how could they have the heart to burn that sweet old
place!"</p>

<p>"Is that Marye-mead?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It <em>must</em> be.  That's where it ought to stand&mdash;and&mdash;oh! 
oh! it's all on fire, Phil, all on fire!"</p>

<p>"Shells from the gun-boats," he muttered, watching the entire
sky turn crimson as the flames burst into fury, lighting up clumps
of trees and outhouses.  And, as they looked, the windows of another
house began to kindle ominously; little tongues of fire fluttered
over a distant cupola, leaped across to a gallery, ran up in vinelike
tendrils which flowered into flame, veining everything in a riotous
tangle of brilliancy.  And through the kindling darkness the sinister
boom&mdash;boom! of the guns never ceased, and the shells continued
to mount, curve, and fall, streaking the night with golden incandescence.</p>

<p>Outside the gates, at the end of the cedar-lined avenue, where
the highway passes, the tumult was increasing every moment amid
shouts, cracking of whips, the jingle and clash of traces and
metallic racket of wheels.  The house, too, resounded with the
heavy hurried tread of army boots trampling up and down stairs
and crossing the floors above in every direction.</p>

<p>In the summer kitchen loud-voiced soldiers were cooking; there
came the clatter of plates from the dining-room, the odour of
hot bread and frying pork.</p>

<p>"All my negroes except old Peter and a quadroon maid have gone
crazy," said Celia hopelessly.  "I had them so comfo'tably qua'tered
and provided foh! &mdash;Cary, the ove'seer, would have looked
after them while the war lasts&mdash;but the sight of the blue uniforms
unbalanced them, and they swa'med to the river, where the contraband
boats were taking runaways. . . .  Such foolish creatures!  They
were ve'y happy here and quite safe and well treated. . . .  And
everyone has deserted, old and young!&mdash;toting their bundles and
baskets on their silly haids&mdash;every negro on Paigecourt plantation,
every servant in this house except Peter and Sadie has gone with
the contrabands . . .  I'm sure I don't know what these soldiers
are cooking in the kitchen.  I expect they'll end by setting the
place afire, and I told Curt so, but he can't he'p it, and I can't. 
It's ve'y hard to see the house turned out of the windows, and
the lawns and gardens cut to pieces by hoofs and wheels, but I'm
only too thankful that Curt can find shelter under this roof,
and nothing matters any mo' as long as he and Stephen are alive
and well."</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard from Ailsa yet?" asked Berkley in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Phil!  I'm certainly worried.  She was expecting to go on
board some hospital boat at the landing the day befo' your regiment
arrived.  I haven't set eyes on her since.  A gun-boat was to
take one of the Commission's steamers to Fortress Monroe, and
all that day the fleet kept on firing at our&mdash;at the Confederate
batteries over the river"&mdash;she corrected herself wearily&mdash;"and
I was so afraid, that Ailsa's steamer would try to get out&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  There are so many, many boats at the landing,
and there's been so much firing, and nobody seems to know what
is happening or where anybody is. . . .  And I don't know where
Ailsa is, and I've been ve'y mise'ble because they say some volunteer
nurses have been killed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to tell you, Phil&mdash;until you were better&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tell me what?" he managed to say, though a terrible fear was
stiffening his lips and throat.</p>

<p>She said dully: "They get shot sometimes.  You remember yo'se'f
what that Sister of Charity said last night.  I heard Ailsa cautioning
Letty&mdash;the little nurse, Miss Lynden&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know.  What else?"</p>

<p>Celia's underlip quivered: "Nothing, only Ailsa told me that
she was ordered to the field hospital fo' duty befo' she went
aboard the commission boat&mdash;and she never came back&mdash;and there
was a battle all that day&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is that all?" he demanded, rising on one elbow.  "Is there anything
else you are concealing?"</p>

<p>"No, Phil.  I'd tell you if there was.  Perhaps I'm foolish to
be so nervous&mdash;but I don't know&mdash;that Sister of Charity struck
by a bullet&mdash;and to think of Ailsa out there under fire&mdash;"  She
closed her eyes and sat shivering in the gray chill of the dawn,
the tears silently stealing over her pale cheeks.  Berkley stared
out of the window at a confused and indistinct mass of waggons
and tents and moving men, but the light was still too dim to distinguish
uniforms; and presently Celia leaned forward and drew the curtains.</p>

<p>Then she turned and took Berkley's hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Phil, dear," she said softly, "I suspect how it is with you
and Ailsa.  Am I indiscreet to speak befo' you give me any warrant?"</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>"The child certainly is in love with you.  A blind woman could
divine that," continued Celia wistfully.  "I am glad, Phil, because
I believe you are as truly devoted to her as she is to you.  And
when the time comes&mdash;if God spares you both&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," he said quietly, "there is no future before
us."</p>

<p>She coloured in consternation.  "Wh&mdash;why I certainly supposed&mdash;believed&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Celia!"</p>

<p>"W-what, dear?"</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>know</em> I cannot marry?"</p>

<p>"Why not, Philip?"</p>

<p>"Could I marry Ailsa Craig unless I first told her that my father
and my mother were never married?" he said steadily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Philip!" she cried, tears starting to her eyes again, "do
you think that would weigh with a girl who is so truly and unselfishly
in love with you?"</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said wearily.  "I'd take <em>that</em>
chance now.  But do you think me disloyal enough to confess to
any woman on earth what my mother, if she were living, would sacrifice
her very life to conceal?"</p>

<p>He bent his head, supporting it in his hands, speaking as though
to himself:</p>

<p>"I believe that the brain is the vehicle, not the origin of thought. 
I believe a brain becomes a mind only when an immortality exterior
to ourselves animates it.  And this is what is called the soul.
. . .  Whatever it is, it is what I saw&mdash;or what that <em>something</em>,
exterior to my body, recognised.</p>

<p>"Perhaps these human eyes of mine did not see her.  Something
that belongs to me saw the immortal visitor; something, that is
the vital part of me, saw, recognised, and was recognised."</p>

<p>For a long while they sat there, silent; the booming guns shook
the window; the clatter and uproar of the passing waggon train
filled their ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly the house rocked under the stunning crash of a huge
gun. Celia sprang to her feet, caught at the curtain as another
terrific blast shivered the window-panes and filled the room with
acrid dust.</p>

<p>Through the stinging clouds of powdered plaster Colonel Craig
entered the room, hastily pulling on his slashed coat as he came.</p>

<p>"There's a fort in the rear of us&mdash;don't be frightened, Celia. 
I think they must be firing at&#11834;"</p>

<p>His voice was drowned in the thunder of another gun; Celia made
her way to him, hid her face on his breast as the room shook again
and the plaster fell from the ceiling, filling the room with blinding
dust.</p>

<p>"Oh, Curt," she gasped, "this is dreadful.  Philip cannot stay
here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Better pull the sheets over his head," said her husband, meeting
Berkley's eyes with a ghost of a smile.  "It won't last long;
and there are no rebel batteries that can reach Paigecourt." 
He kissed her.  "How are you feeling, dear?  I'm trying to arrange
for you to go North on the first decent transport&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I want to stay with you, Curt," she pleaded, tightening her
arms around his neck.  "Can't I stay as long as my husband and
son are here?  I don't wish to go&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You can't stay," he said gently.  "There is no immediate danger
here at Paigecourt, but the army is turning this landing into
a vast pest hole.  It's deadly unhealthy.  I wish you to go home
just as soon as I can secure transportation&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And let them burn Paigecourt?  Who is there to look after&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We'll have to take such chances, Celia.  The main thing is for
you to pack up and go home as soon as you possibly can. . . . 
I've got to go out now.  I'll try to come back to-night.  The
General understands that it's your house, and that you are my
wife; and there's a guard placed and a Union flag hung out from
the gallery&#11834;"</p>

<p>She looked up quickly; a pink flush stained her neck and forehead.</p>

<p>"I would not use that wicked flag to protect myse'f," she said
quietly&mdash;"nor to save this house, either, Curt.  It's only fo'
you and Phil that I care what happens to anything now&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then go North, you bad little rebel!" whispered her husband,
drawing her into his arms.  "Paige and Marye have been deserted
long enough; and you've seen sufficient of this war&mdash;plenty to
last your lifetime&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I saw Ailsa's house burn," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Marye-mead.  When?"</p>

<p>"This mo'ning, Curt.  Phil thinks it was the shells from the
gun-boats.  It can't be he'ped now; it's gone.  So is Edmund Ruffin's. 
And I wish I knew where that child, Ailsa, is.  I'm that frightened
and mise'ble, Curt&#11834;"</p>

<p>An orderly suddenly appeared at the door; her husband kissed
her and hurried away.  The outer door swung wide, letting in a
brassy clangour of bugles and a roll of drums, which softened
when the door closed with a snap.</p>

<p>It opened again abruptly, and a thin, gray-garbed figure came
in, hesitated, and Celia turned, staring through her tears:</p>

<p>"Miss Lynden!" she exclaimed.  "Is Ailsa here?"</p>

<p>Berkley sat up and leaned forward, looking at her intently from
the mass of bandages.</p>

<p>"Letty!" he said, "where is Mrs. Paige?"</p>

<p>Celia had caught the girl's hands in hers, and was searching
her thin white face with anxious eyes; and Letty shook her head
and looked wonderingly at Berkley.</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened to her," she said.  "A Sister of Mercy
was wounded in the field hospital near Azalea, and they sent for
Mrs. Paige to fill her place temporarily.  And," looking from
Celia to Berkley, "she is well and unhurt.  The fighting is farther
west now.  Mrs. Paige heard yesterday that the 8th Lancers were
encamped near Paigecourt and asked me to find Mr. Berkley&mdash;and
deliver a letter&#11834;"</p>

<p>She smiled, drew from her satchel a letter, and, disengaging
her other hand from Celia's, went over to the bed and placed it
in Berkley's hands.</p>

<p>"She is quite well," repeated Letty reassuringly; and, to Celia:
"She sends her love to you and to your husband and son, and wishes
to know how they are and where their regiment is stationed."</p>

<p>"You sweet little thing!" said Celia, impulsively taking her
into her arms and kissing her pale face.  "My husband and my son
are safe and well, thank God, and my cousin, Phil Berkley, is
convalescent, and you may tell my sister-in-law that we all were
worried most to death at not hearing from her.  And now I'm going
to get you a cup of broth&mdash;you poor little white-faced child! 
How did you ever get here?"</p>

<p>"Our ambulance brought me.  We had sick men to send North.  Ailsa
couldn't leave, so she asked me to come."</p>

<p>She accepted a chair near the bed.  Celia went away to prepare
some breakfast with the aid of old Peter and Sadie, her maid. 
And as soon as she left the room Letty sprang to her feet and
went straight to Berkley.</p>

<p>"I did not tell the entire truth," she said in a low, excited
voice.  "I heard your regiment was here; Ailsa learned it from
me. I was coming anyway to see you."</p>

<p>"To see me, Letty?" he repeated, surprised and smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, losing what little colour remained in her cheeks.
"I am in&mdash;in much&mdash;anxiety&mdash;to know&mdash;what to do."</p>

<p>"Can <em>I</em> help you?"</p>

<p>She looked wistfully at him; the tears rushed into her eyes;
she dropped on her knees at his bedside and hid her face on his
hands.</p>

<p>"Letty &mdash;Letty!" he said in astonishment, "what on earth
has happened?"</p>

<p>She looked up, lips quivering, striving to meet his gaze through
her tears.</p>

<p>"Dr. Benton is here. . . .  He&mdash;he has asked me to&mdash;marry him."</p>

<p>Berkley lay silent, watching her intently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know &mdash;I know," she sobbed.  "I can't, can I?  I
should have to tell him&mdash;and he would never speak to me again&mdash;never
write to me&mdash;never be what he has been all these months! &mdash;I
know I cannot marry him.  I came to tell you&mdash;to ask&mdash;but it's
no use&mdash;no use.  I knew what you would say&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Letty!  Wait a moment&#11834;"</p>

<p>She rose, controlling herself with a desperate effort.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Mr. Berkley; I didn't mean to break down; but I'm
so tired&mdash;and&mdash;I wanted you &mdash;I needed to hear you tell me
what was right. . . .  But I knew already.  Even if I were&mdash;were
treacherous enough to marry him &mdash;I know he would find me
out. . . .  I can't get away from it &mdash;I can't seem to get
away.  Yesterday, in camp, the 20th Cavalry halted&mdash;and there
was John Casson! &mdash;And I nearly dropped dead beside Dr. Benton&mdash;oh
the punishment for what I did!&mdash;the awful punishment!&mdash;and Casson
stared at me and said: 'My Lord, Letty! is that you?'"</p>

<p>She buried her burning cheeks in her hands.</p>

<p>"I did not lie to him.  I offered him my hand; and perhaps he
saw the agony in my face, for he didn't say anything about the
Canterbury, but he took off his forage cap and was pleasant and
kind.  And he and Dr. Benton spoke to each other until the bugles
sounded for the regiment to mount."</p>

<p>She flung her slender arm out in a tragic gesture toward the
horizon.  "The world is not wide enough to hide in," she said
in a heart-breaking voice.  "I thought it was&mdash;but there is no
shelter&mdash;no place&mdash;no place in all the earth!"</p>

<p>"Letty," he said slowly, "if your Dr. Benton is the man I think
he is&mdash;and I once knew him well enough to judge&mdash;he is the only
man on earth fit to hear the confession you have made this day
to me."</p>

<p>She looked at him, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I advise you to love him and marry him.  Tell him about yourself
if you choose; or don't tell him.  There is a vast amount of nonsense
talked about the moral necessity of turning one's self inside
out the moment one comes to marry.  Let me tell you, few men can
do it; and their fiancees survive the shock.  So, few men are
asses enough to try it.  As for women, few have any confessions
to make.  A few have.  You are one."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>"But I wouldn't if I were you.  If ever any man or woman took
the chance of salvation and made the most of it, that person is
you! And I'm going to tell you that I wouldn't hesitate to marry
you if I loved you."</p>

<p>"W-what!"</p>

<p>He laughed.  "Not one second!  It's a good partnership for any
plan.  Don't be afraid that you can't meet men on their own level.
You're above most of us now; and you're mounting steadily.  There,
that's my opinion of you&mdash;that you're a good woman, and a charming
one; and Benton is devilish lucky to get you. . . .  Come here,
Letty."</p>

<p>She went to him as though dazed; and he took both her hands in
his.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," he said, "that I have seen you, day after day,
intimately associated with the woman I love?  Can you understand
now that I am telling the truth when I say, let the past bury
its ghosts; and go on living as you have lived from the moment
that your chance came to live nobly.  I know what you have made
of yourself.  I know what the chances were against you.  You are
a better woman to-day than many who will die untempted.  And you
shall not doubt it, Letty.  What a soul is born into is often
fine and noble; what a soul makes of itself is beyond all praise.</p>

<p>"Choose your own way; tell him or not; but if you love him, give
yourself to him.  Whether or not you tell him, he will want you&mdash;as
I would&mdash;as any man would. . . .  Now you must smile at me, Letty."</p>

<p>She turned toward him a face, pallid, enraptured, transfigured
with an inward radiance that left him silent&mdash;graver after that
swift glimpse of a soul exalted.</p>

<p>She said slowly: "You and Ailsa have been God's own messengers
to me. . . .  I shall tell Dr. Benton. . . .  If he still wishes
it, I will marry him.  It will be for him to ask&mdash;after he knows
all."</p>

<p>Celia entered, carrying the breakfast on a tray.</p>

<p>"Curt's Zouaves have stolen ev'y pig, but I found bacon and po'k
in the cellar," she said, smilingly.  "Oh, dear! the flo' is in
such a mess of plaster!  Will you sit on the aidge of the bed,
Miss Lynden, and he'p my cousin eat this hot co'n pone?"</p>

<p>So the napkin was spread over the sheets, and pillows tucked
behind Berkley; and Celia and Letty fed him, and Letty drank her
coffee and thankfully ate her bacon and corn pone, telling them
both, between bites, how it had been with her and with Ailsa since
the great retreat set in, swamping all hospitals with the sick
and wounded of an unbeaten but disheartened army, now doomed to
decimation by disease.</p>

<p>"It was dreadful," she said.  "We could hear the firing for miles
and miles, and nobody knew what was happening.  But all the northern
papers said it was one great victory after another, and we believed
them.  All the regimental bands at the Landing played; and everybody
was so excited.  We all expected to hear that our army was in
Richmond."</p>

<p>Celia reddened to the ears, and her lips tightened, but she said
nothing; and Letty went on, unconscious of the fiery emotions
awaking in Celia's breast:</p>

<p>"Everybody was so cheerful and happy in the hospital&mdash;all those
poor sick soldiers," she said, "and everybody was beginning to
plan to go home, thinking the war had nearly ended.  I thought
so, too, and I was so glad.  And then, somehow, people began to
get uneasy; and the first stragglers appeared. . . .  Oh, it did
seem incredible at first; we wouldn't believe that the siege of
Richmond had been abandoned."</p>

<p>She smiled drearily.  "I've found out that it is very easy to
believe what you want to believe in this world. . . .  Will you
have some more broth, Mr. Berkley?"</p>

<p>Before he could answer the door opened and a red zouave came
in, carrying his rifle and knapsack.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said in an awed voice, "Jimmy Lent is dead!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>He looked stupidly around the room, resting his eyes on Letty
and Berkley, then dropped heavily onto a chair.</p>

<p>"Jim's dead," he repeated vacantly.  "He only arrived here yesterday&mdash;transferred
from his militia to McDunn's battery.  And now he's dead.  Some
one had better write to Camilla.  I'm afraid to. . . .  A shell
hit him last night&mdash;oh&mdash;he's all torn to pieces&mdash;and Major Lent
doesn't know it, either. . . .  Father let me come; we're ordered
across the river; good-bye, mother&mdash;"  He rose and put his arms
around her.</p>

<p>"You'll write to Camilla, won't you?" he said.  "Tell her I love
her.  I didn't know it until just a few minutes ago.  But I do,
mother.  I'd like to marry her.  Tell her not to cry too much.
Jimmy was playing cards, they say, and a big shell fell inside
the redoubt.   Philip &mdash;I think you knew Harry Sayre?  Transferred
from the 7th to the Zouaves as lieutenant in the 5th company?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Was he killed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, yes; everybody in the shebang except Arthur Wye was
all torn to pieces.  Tommy Atherton, too; you knew him, of course&mdash;5th
Zouaves.  He happened in&mdash;just visiting Arthur Wye.  They were
all playing cards in a half finished bomb-proof. . . .  Mother,
you <em>will</em> write to Camilla, won't you, dear?  Good-bye&mdash;good-bye,
Phil&mdash;and Miss Lynden!"  He caught his mother in his arms for
a last hug, wrenched himself free, and ran back across the hall,
bayonet and canteen clanking.</p>

<p>"Oh, why are they sending Curt's regiment across the river?"
wailed Celia, following to the window.  "Look at them, Phil! 
Can you see? The road is full of Zouaves&mdash;there's a whole regiment
of them in blue, too.  The batteries are all harnessed up; do
you think there's going to be another battle?  I don't know why
they want to fight any mo'!" she exclaimed in sudden wrath and
anguish.  "I don't understand why they are not willing to leave
the South alone. My husband will be killed, and my only son&mdash;like
Jimmy Lent&mdash;if they don't ever stop this wicked fighting&#11834;"</p>

<p>The roar of a heavy gun buried the room in plaster dust.  Letty
calmly lifted the tray from the bed and set it on a table.  Then
very sweetly and with absolute composure she took leave of Celia
and of Berkley.  They saw her climb into an ambulance which was
drawn up on the grass.</p>

<p>Then Berkley opened the letter that Letty had brought him:</p>

<p>"This is just a hurried line to ask you a few questions.  Do
you know a soldier named Arthur Wye?  He is serving now as artilleryman
in the 10th N. Y. Flying Battery, Captain McDunn.  Are you acquainted
with a lieutenant in the 5th Zouaves, named Cortlandt? I believe
he is known to his intimates as Billy or 'Pop' Cortlandt. Are
they trustworthy and reliable men?  Where did you meet Miss Lynden
and how long have you known her?  Please answer immediately.</p>

<p>  "<em>AILSA PAIGE</em>."</p>

<p>Wondering, vaguely uneasy, he read and re-read this note, so
unlike Ailsa, so brief, so disturbing in its direct coupling of
the people in whose company he had first met Letty Lynden. . .
.  Yet, on reflection, he dismissed apprehension, Ailsa was too
fine a character to permit any change in her manner to humiliate
Letty even if, by hazard, knowledge of the unhappy past had come
to her concerning the pretty, pallid nurse of Sainte Ursula.</p>

<p>As for Arthur Wye and Billy Cortlandt, they were incapable of
anything contemptible or malicious.</p>

<p>He asked Celia for a pencil and paper, and, propped on his pillows,
he wrote:</p>

<p>"My darling, I don't exactly understand your message, but I guess
it's all right.  To answer it:</p>

<p>"Billy Cortlandt and Arthur Wye are old New York friends of mine.
Their words are better than other people's bonds.  Letty Lynden
is a sweet, charming girl.  I regret that I have not known her
years longer than I have.  I am sending this in haste to catch
Letty's ambulance just departing, though still blocked by artillery
passing the main road.  Can you come? I love you.</p>

<p>  "<em>PHILIP BERKLEY</em>."</p>

<p>Celia sent her coloured man running after the ambulance.  He
caught it just as it started on.  Berkley, from his window, saw
the servant deliver his note to Letty.</p>

<p>He had not answered the two questions concerning Letty.  He could
not.  So he had evaded them.</p>

<p>Preoccupied, still conscious of the lingering sense of uneasiness,
he turned on his pillows and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>An enormous cloud of white smoke rose curling from the river,
another, another; and boom! boom!  boom! came the solid thunder
of cannon.  The gunboats at the Landing were opening fire; cavalry
were leading their horses aboard transports; and far down the
road the sun glistened on a long column of scarlet, where the
3rd Zouaves were marching to their boats.</p>

<p>The sharpshooters had already begun to trouble them.  Their officers
ordered them to lie down while awaiting their turn to embark. 
After a while many of the men sat up on the ground to stretch
and look about them, Stephen among the others.  And a moment later
a conoidal bullet struck him square in the chest and knocked him
flat in the dirt among his comrades.</p>
