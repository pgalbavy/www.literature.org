Hail, Muse! et cetera.<br/>
&mdash;We left Juan sleeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,<br/>
And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest<br/>
To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,<br/>
Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,<br/>
And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!

</p>
<p>
O, Love! what is it in this world of ours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why<br/>
With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made thy best interpreter a sigh?<br/>
As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And place them on their breast&mdash;but place to die&mdash;<br/>
Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish<br/>
Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

</p>
<p>
In her first passion woman loves her lover,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the others all she loves is love,<br/>
Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fits her loosely&mdash;like an easy glove,<br/>
As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One man alone at first her heart can move;<br/>
She then prefers him in the plural number,<br/>
Not finding that the additions much encumber.

</p>
<p>
I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted<br/>
(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After a decent time must be gallanted;<br/>
Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;<br/>
Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,<br/>
But those who have ne'er end with only one.

</p>
<p>
'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human frailty, folly, also crime,<br/>
That love and marriage rarely can combine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they both are born in the same clime;<br/>
Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad, sour, sober beverage&mdash;by time<br/>
Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour<br/>
Down to a very homely household savour.

</p>
<p>
There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between their present and their future state;<br/>
A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is used until the truth arrives too late&mdash;<br/>
Yet what can people do, except despair?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same things change their names at such a rate;<br/>
For instance&mdash;passion in a lover 's glorious,<br/>
But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.

</p>
<p>
Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They sometimes also get a little tired<br/>
(But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same things cannot always be admired,<br/>
Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That both are tied till one shall have expired.<br/>
Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning<br/>
Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.

</p>
<p>
There 's doubtless something in domestic doings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;<br/>
Romances paint at full length people's wooings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But only give a bust of marriages;<br/>
For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:<br/>
Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,<br/>
He would have written sonnets all his life?

</p>
<p>
All tragedies are finish'd by a death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All comedies are ended by a marriage;<br/>
The future states of both are left to faith,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For authors fear description might disparage<br/>
The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;<br/>
So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,<br/>
They say no more of Death or of the Lady.

</p>
<p>
The only two that in my recollection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are<br/>
Dante and Milton, and of both the affection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar<br/>
Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):<br/>
But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve<br/>
Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

</p>
<p>
Some persons say that Dante meant theology<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Beatrice, and not a mistress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I,<br/>
Although my opinion may require apology,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deem this a commentator's fantasy,<br/>
Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;<br/>
I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics<br/>
Meant to personify the mathematics.

</p>
<p>
Haidee and Juan were not married, but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,<br/>
Chaste reader, then, in any way to put<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame on me, unless you wish they were;<br/>
Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The book which treats of this erroneous pair,<br/>
Before the consequences grow too awful;<br/>
'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.

</p>
<p>
Yet they were happy,&mdash;happy in the illicit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgence of their innocent desires;<br/>
But more imprudent grown with every visit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;<br/>
When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in the beginning, ere one tires;<br/>
Thus she came often, not a moment losing,<br/>
Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.

</p>
<p>
Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,<br/>
For into a prime minister but change<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;<br/>
But he, more modest, took an humbler range<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life, and in an honester vocation<br/>
Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,<br/>
And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

</p>
<p>
The good old gentleman had been detain'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By winds and waves, and some important captures;<br/>
And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,<br/>
By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His prisoners, dividing them like chapters<br/>
In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,<br/>
And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

</p>
<p>
Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold<br/>
To his Tunis correspondents, save one man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);<br/>
The rest&mdash;save here and there some richer one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserved for future ransom&mdash;in the hold<br/>
Were link'd alike, as for the common people he<br/>
Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.

</p>
<p>
The merchandise was served in the same way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;<br/>
Except some certain portions of the prey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light classic articles of female want,<br/>
French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Guitars and castanets from Alicant,<br/>
All which selected from the spoil he gathers,<br/>
Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.

</p>
<p>
A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,<br/>
He chose from several animals he saw&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,<br/>
Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;<br/>
These to secure in this strong blowing weather,<br/>
He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

</p>
<p>
Then having settled his marine affairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Despatching single cruisers here and there,<br/>
His vessel having need of some repairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shaped his course to where his daughter fair<br/>
Continued still her hospitable cares;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,<br/>
And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,<br/>
His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

</p>
<p>
And there he went ashore without delay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no custom-house nor quarantine<br/>
To ask him awkward questions on the way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the time and place where he had been:<br/>
He left his ship to be hove down next day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With orders to the people to careen;<br/>
So that all hands were busy beyond measure,<br/>
In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.

</p>
<p>
Arriving at the summit of a hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,<br/>
He stopp'd.<br/>
&mdash;What singular emotions fill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!<br/>
With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With love for many, and with fears for some;<br/>
All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,<br/>
And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.

</p>
<p>
The approach of home to husbands and to sires,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After long travelling by land or water,<br/>
Most naturally some small doubt inspires&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A female family 's a serious matter<br/>
(None trusts the sex more, or so much admires&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);<br/>
Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,<br/>
And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.

</p>
<p>
An honest gentleman at his return<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;<br/>
Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;<br/>
The odds are that he finds a handsome urn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To his memory&mdash;and two or three young misses<br/>
Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,&mdash;<br/>
And that his Argus&mdash;bites him by the breeches.

</p>
<p>
If single, probably his plighted fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;<br/>
But all the better, for the happy pair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,<br/>
He may resume his amatory care<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As cavalier servente, or despise her;<br/>
And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,<br/>
Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.

</p>
<p>
And oh! ye gentlemen who have already<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some chaste liaison of the kind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I mean<br/>
An honest friendship with a married lady&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing of this sort ever seen<br/>
To last&mdash;of all connections the most steady,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)&mdash;<br/>
Yet for all that keep not too long away,<br/>
I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.

</p>
<p>
Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less experience of dry land than ocean,<br/>
On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion<br/>
Of the true reason of his not being sad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that of any other strong emotion;<br/>
He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,<br/>
But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.

</p>
<p>
He saw his white walls shining in the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His garden trees all shadowy and green;<br/>
He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant dog-bark; and perceived between<br/>
The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen<br/>
Of arms (in the East all arm)&mdash;and various dyes<br/>
Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.

</p>
<p>
And as the spot where they appear he nears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,<br/>
He hears&mdash;alas! no music of the spheres,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!<br/>
A melody which made him doubt his ears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;<br/>
A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,<br/>
A most unoriental roar of laughter.

</p>
<p>
And still more nearly to the place advancing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending rather quickly the declivity,<br/>
Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Midst other indications of festivity,<br/>
Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he<br/>
Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,<br/>
To which the Levantines are very partial.

</p>
<p>
And further on a group of Grecian girls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,<br/>
Were strung together like a row of pearls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having<br/>
Down her white neck long floating auburn curls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The least of which would set ten poets raving);<br/>
Their leader sang&mdash;and bounded to her song,<br/>
With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.

</p>
<p>
And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Small social parties just begun to dine;<br/>
Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,<br/>
And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above them their dessert grew on its vine,<br/>
The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er<br/>
Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.

</p>
<p>
A band of children, round a snow-white ram,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;<br/>
While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers<br/>
His sober head, majestically tame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers<br/>
His brow, as if in act to butt, and then<br/>
Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.

</p>
<p>
Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,<br/>
Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,<br/>
The innocence which happy childhood blesses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;<br/>
So that the philosophical beholder<br/>
Sigh'd for their sakes&mdash;that they should e'er grow older.

</p>
<p>
Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,<br/>
Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,<br/>
Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,<br/>
Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,<br/>
Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).

</p>
<p>
Here was no lack of innocent diversion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the imagination or the senses,<br/>
Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;<br/>
But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perceiving in his absence such expenses,<br/>
Dreading that climax of all human ills,<br/>
The inflammation of his weekly bills.

</p>
<p>
Ah! what is man? what perils still environ<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiest mortals even after dinner&mdash;<br/>
A day of gold from out an age of iron<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;<br/>
Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;<br/>
Lambro's reception at his people's banquet<br/>
Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.

</p>
<p>
He&mdash;being a man who seldom used a word<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise<br/>
(In general he surprised men with the sword)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter&mdash;had not sent before to advise<br/>
Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long he paused to re-assure his eyes<br/>
In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,<br/>
To find so much good company invited.

</p>
<p>
He did not know (alas! how men will lie)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That a report (especially the Greeks)<br/>
Avouch'd his death (such people never die),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put his house in mourning several weeks,&mdash;<br/>
But now their eyes and also lips were dry;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,<br/>
Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,<br/>
She now kept house upon her own account.

</p>
<p>
Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;<br/>
The servants all were getting drunk or idling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A life which made them happy beyond measure.<br/>
Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;<br/>
'T was wonderful how things went on improving,<br/>
While she had not one hour to spare from loving.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew into a passion, and in fact<br/>
There was no mighty reason to be pleased;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,<br/>
The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach his people to be more exact,<br/>
And that, proceeding at a very high rate,<br/>
He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.

</p>
<p>
You 're wrong.<br/>
&mdash;He was the mildest manner'd man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:<br/>
With such true breeding of a gentleman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never could divine his real thought;<br/>
No courtier could, and scarcely woman can<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gird more deceit within a petticoat;<br/>
Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,<br/>
He was so great a loss to good society.

</p>
<p>
Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,<br/>
With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boded no good, whatever it express'd,<br/>
He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd<br/>
His question, much too merry to divine<br/>
The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,

</p>
<p>
And without turning his facetious head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,<br/>
Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'<br/>
A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'<br/>
'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!&mdash;pooh!-<br/>
You mean our master&mdash;not the old, but new.'

</p>
<p>
These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They thus address'd&mdash;and Lambro's visage fell&mdash;<br/>
And o'er his eye a momentary gloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell<br/>
The expression, and endeavouring to resume<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile, requested one of them to tell<br/>
The name and quality of his new patron,<br/>
Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.

</p>
<p>
'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is, nor whence he came&mdash;and little care;<br/>
But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;<br/>
And if you are not satisfied with that,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct your questions to my neighbour there;<br/>
He 'll answer all for better or for worse,<br/>
For none likes more to hear himself converse.'

</p>
<p>
I said that Lambro was a man of patience,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,<br/>
Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;<br/>
He bore these sneers against his near relations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,<br/>
The insults, too, of every servile glutton,<br/>
Who all the time was eating up his mutton.

</p>
<p>
Now in a person used to much command&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bid men come, and go, and come again&mdash;<br/>
To see his orders done, too, out of hand&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the word was death, or but the chain&mdash;<br/>
It may seem strange to find his manners bland;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet such things are, which I can not explain,<br/>
Though doubtless he who can command himself<br/>
Is good to govern&mdash;almost as a Guelf.

</p>
<p>
Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never in his real and serious mood;<br/>
Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;<br/>
With him it never was a word and blow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,<br/>
But in his silence there was much to rue,<br/>
And his one blow left little work for two.

</p>
<p>
He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On to the house, but by a private way,<br/>
So that the few who met him hardly heeded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So little they expected him that day;<br/>
If love paternal in his bosom pleaded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,<br/>
But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,<br/>
This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.

</p>
<p>
If all the dead could now return to life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,<br/>
For instance, if a husband or his wife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Nuptial examples are as good as any),<br/>
No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The present weather would be much more rainy&mdash;<br/>
Tears shed into the grave of the connection<br/>
Would share most probably its resurrection.

</p>
<p>
He enter'd in the house no more his home,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing to human feelings the most trying,<br/>
And harder for the heart to overcome,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;<br/>
To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And round its once warm precincts palely lying<br/>
The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,<br/>
Beyond a single gentleman's belief.

</p>
<p>
He enter'd in the house&mdash;his home no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For without hearts there is no home; and felt<br/>
The solitude of passing his own door<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,<br/>
There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt<br/>
Over the innocence of that sweet child,<br/>
His only shrine of feelings undefiled.

</p>
<p>
He was a man of a strange temperament,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,<br/>
Moderate in all his habits, and content<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With temperance in pleasure, as in food,<br/>
Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For something better, if not wholly good;<br/>
His country's wrongs and his despair to save her<br/>
Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.

</p>
<p>
The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardness by long habitude produced,<br/>
The dangerous life in which he had grown old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercy he had granted oft abused,<br/>
The sights he was accustom'd to behold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,<br/>
Had cost his enemies a long repentance,<br/>
And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.

</p>
<p>
But something of the spirit of old Greece<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,<br/>
Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His predecessors in the Colchian days;<br/>
T is true he had no ardent love for peace&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:<br/>
Hate to the world and war with every nation<br/>
He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.

</p>
<p>
Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd<br/>
Its power unconsciously full many a time,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A taste seen in the choice of his abode,<br/>
A love of music and of scenes sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd<br/>
Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,<br/>
Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.

</p>
<p>
But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On that beloved daughter; she had been<br/>
The only thing which kept his heart unclosed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;<br/>
A lonely pure affection unopposed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There wanted but the loss of this to wean<br/>
His feelings from all milk of human kindness,<br/>
And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.

</p>
<p>
The cubless tigress in her jungle raging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;<br/>
The ocean when its yeasty war is waging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is awful to the vessel near the rock;<br/>
But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fury being spent by its own shock,<br/>
Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire<br/>
Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.

</p>
<p>
It is a hard although a common case<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To find our children running restive&mdash;they<br/>
In whom our brightest days we would retrace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,<br/>
Just as old age is creeping on apace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,<br/>
They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,<br/>
But in good company&mdash;the gout or stone.

</p>
<p>
Yet a fine family is a fine thing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Provided they don't come in after dinner);<br/>
'T is beautiful to see a matron bring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);<br/>
Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).<br/>
A lady with her daughters or her nieces<br/>
Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.

</p>
<p>
Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood within his hall at eventide;<br/>
Meantime the lady and her lover sate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At wassail in their beauty and their pride:<br/>
An ivory inlaid table spread with state<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before them, and fair slaves on every side;<br/>
Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,<br/>
Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.

</p>
<p>
The dinner made about a hundred dishes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamb and pistachio nuts&mdash;in short, all meats,<br/>
And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,<br/>
Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The beverage was various sherbets<br/>
Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,<br/>
Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.

</p>
<p>
These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,<br/>
And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In small fine China cups, came in at last;<br/>
Gold cups of filigree made to secure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand from burning underneath them placed,<br/>
Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd<br/>
Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.

</p>
<p>
The hangings of the room were tapestry, made<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of velvet panels, each of different hue,<br/>
And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And round them ran a yellow border too;<br/>
The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,<br/>
Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,<br/>
From poets, or the moralists their betters.

</p>
<p>
These Oriental writings on the wall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite common in those countries, are a kind<br/>
Of monitors adapted to recall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind<br/>
The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And took his kingdom from him: You will find,<br/>
Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,<br/>
There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.

</p>
<p>
A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A genius who has drunk himself to death,<br/>
A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)&mdash;<br/>
But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are things that really take away the breath,&mdash;<br/>
And show that late hours, wine, and love are able<br/>
To do not much less damage than the table.

</p>
<p>
Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;<br/>
Their sofa occupied three parts complete<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the apartment&mdash;and appear'd quite new;<br/>
The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew<br/>
A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,<br/>
Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.

</p>
<p>
Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats<br/>
And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,<br/>
And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's<br/>
To say, by degradation) mingled there<br/>
As plentiful as in a court, or fair.

</p>
<p>
There was no want of lofty mirrors, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables, most of ebony inlaid<br/>
With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,<br/>
Fretted with gold or silver:&mdash;by command,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater part of these were ready spread<br/>
With viands and sherbets in ice&mdash;and wine&mdash;<br/>
Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.

</p>
<p>
Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore two jelicks&mdash;one was of pale yellow;<br/>
Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;<br/>
With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,<br/>
And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,<br/>
Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.

</p>
<p>
One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lockless&mdash;so pliable from the pure gold<br/>
That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;<br/>
So beautiful&mdash;its very shape would charm;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,<br/>
The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin<br/>
That e'er by precious metal was held in.

</p>
<p>
Around, as princess of her father's land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A like gold bar above her instep roll'd<br/>
Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold<br/>
Below her breast was fasten'd with a band<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;<br/>
Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd<br/>
About the prettiest ankle in the world.

</p>
<p>
Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun<br/>
Dyes with his morning light,&mdash;and would conceal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her person if allow'd at large to run,<br/>
And still they seem resentfully to feel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun<br/>
Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began<br/>
To offer his young pinion as her fan.

</p>
<p>
Round her she made an atmosphere of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,<br/>
They were so soft and beautiful, and rife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all we can imagine of the skies,<br/>
And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too pure even for the purest human ties;<br/>
Her overpowering presence made you feel<br/>
It would not be idolatry to kneel.

</p>
<p>
Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(It is the country's custom), but in vain;<br/>
For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,<br/>
And in their native beauty stood avenged:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again<br/>
The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for<br/>
They could not look more rosy than before.

</p>
<p>
The henna should be deeply dyed to make<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;<br/>
She had no need of this, day ne'er will break<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:<br/>
The eye might doubt if it were well awake,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was so like a vision; I might err,<br/>
But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly<br/>
'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'

</p>
<p>
Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But a white baracan, and so transparent<br/>
The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like small stars through the milky way apparent;<br/>
His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't<br/>
Surmounted as its clasp&mdash;a glowing crescent,<br/>
Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.

</p>
<p>
And now they were diverted by their suite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,<br/>
Which made their new establishment complete;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:<br/>
His verses rarely wanted their due feet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for his theme&mdash;he seldom sung below it,<br/>
He being paid to satirize or flatter,<br/>
As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'

</p>
<p>
He praised the present, and abused the past,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversing the good custom of old days,<br/>
An Eastern anti-jacobin at last<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise&mdash;<br/>
For some few years his lot had been o'ercast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By his seeming independent in his lays,<br/>
But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha<br/>
With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.

</p>
<p>
He was a man who had seen many changes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And always changed as true as any needle;<br/>
His polar star being one which rather ranges,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not the fix'd&mdash;he knew the way to wheedle:<br/>
So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),<br/>
He lied with such a fervour of intention&mdash;<br/>
There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.

</p>
<p>
But he had genius,&mdash;when a turncoat has it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care<br/>
That without notice few full moons shall pass it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even good men like to make the public stare:&mdash;<br/>
But to my subject&mdash;let me see&mdash;what was it?-<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O!&mdash;the third canto&mdash;and the pretty pair&mdash;<br/>
Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode<br/>
Of living in their insular abode.

</p>
<p>
Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In company a very pleasant fellow,<br/>
Had been the favourite of full many a mess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;<br/>
And though his meaning they could rarely guess,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow<br/>
The glorious meed of popular applause,<br/>
Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.

</p>
<p>
But now being lifted into high society,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And having pick'd up several odds and ends<br/>
Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,<br/>
That, without any danger of a riot, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might for long lying make himself amends;<br/>
And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,<br/>
Agree to a short armistice with truth.

</p>
<p>
He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew the self-loves of the different nations;<br/>
And having lived with people of all ranks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had something ready upon most occasions&mdash;<br/>
Which got him a few presents and some thanks.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He varied with some skill his adulations;<br/>
To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece<br/>
Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.

</p>
<p>
Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave the different nations something national;<br/>
'T was all the same to him&mdash;'God save the king,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:<br/>
His muse made increment of any thing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the high lyric down to the low rational:<br/>
If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder<br/>
Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?

</p>
<p>
In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In England a six canto quarto tale;<br/>
In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last war&mdash;much the same in Portugal;<br/>
In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);<br/>
In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'<br/>
In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:

</p>
<p>
<em>THE ISLES OF GREECE</em>.

</p>
<p>
The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br/>
Where grew the arts of war and peace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!<br/>
Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br/>
But all, except their sun, is set.

</p>
<p>
The Scian and the Teian muse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero's harp, the lover's lute,<br/>
Have found the fame your shores refuse;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their place of birth alone is mute<br/>
To sounds which echo further west<br/>
Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'

</p>
<p>
The mountains look on Marathon&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Marathon looks on the sea;<br/>
And musing there an hour alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I dream'd that Greece might still be free;<br/>
For standing on the Persians' grave,<br/>
I could not deem myself a slave.

</p>
<p>
A king sate on the rocky brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;<br/>
And ships, by thousands, lay below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And men in nations;&mdash;all were his!<br/>
He counted them at break of day&mdash;<br/>
And when the sun set where were they?

</p>
<p>
And where are they? and where art thou,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My country? On thy voiceless shore<br/>
The heroic lay is tuneless now&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroic bosom beats no more!<br/>
And must thy lyre, so long divine,<br/>
Degenerate into hands like mine?

</p>
<p>
'T is something, in the dearth of fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though link'd among a fetter'd race,<br/>
To feel at least a patriot's shame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as I sing, suffuse my face;<br/>
For what is left the poet here?<br/>
For Greeks a blush&mdash;for Greece a tear.

</p>
<p>
Must we but weep o'er days more blest?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we but blush?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Our fathers bled.<br/>
Earth! render back from out thy breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A remnant of our Spartan dead!<br/>
Of the three hundred grant but three,<br/>
To make a new Thermopylae!

</p>
<p>
What, silent still? and silent all?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! no;&mdash;the voices of the dead<br/>
Sound like a distant torrent's fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And answer, 'Let one living head,<br/>
But one arise,&mdash;we come, we come!'<br/>
'T is but the living who are dumb.

</p>
<p>
In vain&mdash;in vain: strike other chords;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill high the cup with Samian wine!<br/>
Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shed the blood of Scio's vine!<br/>
Hark! rising to the ignoble call&mdash;<br/>
How answers each bold Bacchanal!

</p>
<p>
You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<br/>
Of two such lessons, why forget<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobler and the manlier one?<br/>
You have the letters Cadmus gave&mdash;<br/>
Think ye he meant them for a slave?

</p>
<p>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not think of themes like these!<br/>
It made Anacreon's song divine:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He served&mdash;but served Polycrates&mdash;<br/>
A tyrant; but our masters then<br/>
Were still, at least, our countrymen.

</p>
<p>
The tyrant of the Chersonese<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was freedom's best and bravest friend;<br/>
That tyrant was Miltiades!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O! that the present hour would lend<br/>
Another despot of the kind!<br/>
Such chains as his were sure to bind.

</p>
<p>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,<br/>
Exists the remnant of a line<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as the Doric mothers bore;<br/>
And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,<br/>
The Heracleidan blood might own.

</p>
<p>
Trust not for freedom to the Franks&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a king who buys and sells;<br/>
In native swords, and native ranks,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hope of courage dwells;<br/>
But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,<br/>
Would break your shield, however broad.

</p>
<p>
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our virgins dance beneath the shade&mdash;<br/>
I see their glorious black eyes shine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But gazing on each glowing maid,<br/>
My own the burning tear-drop laves,<br/>
To think such breasts must suckle slaves

</p>
<p>
Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nothing, save the waves and I,<br/>
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There, swan-like, let me sing and die:<br/>
A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine&mdash;<br/>
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!

</p>
<p>
Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;<br/>
If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in these times he might have done much worse:<br/>
His strain display'd some feeling&mdash;right or wrong;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And feeling, in a poet, is the source<br/>
Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,<br/>
And take all colours&mdash;like the hands of dyers.

</p>
<p>
But words are things, and a small drop of ink,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces<br/>
That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses<br/>
Instead of speech, may form a lasting link<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces<br/>
Frail man, when paper&mdash;even a rag like this,<br/>
Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.

</p>
<p>
And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His station, generation, even his nation,<br/>
Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In chronological commemoration,<br/>
Some dull <em>MS. </em>oblivion long has sank,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or graven stone found in a barrack's station<br/>
In digging the foundation of a closet,<br/>
May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.

</p>
<p>
And glory long has made the sages smile;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind&mdash;<br/>
Depending more upon the historian's style<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than on the name a person leaves behind:<br/>
Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The present century was growing blind<br/>
To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,<br/>
Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.

</p>
<p>
Milton 's the prince of poets&mdash;so we say;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little heavy, but no less divine:<br/>
An independent being in his day&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;<br/>
But, his life falling into Johnson's way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine<br/>
Was whipt at college&mdash;a harsh sire&mdash;odd spouse,<br/>
For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.

</p>
<p>
All these are, certes, entertaining facts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;<br/>
Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);<br/>
Like Cromwell's pranks;&mdash;but although truth exacts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These amiable descriptions from the scribes,<br/>
As most essential to their hero's story,<br/>
They do not much contribute to his glory.

</p>
<p>
All are not moralists, like Southey, when<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'<br/>
Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;<br/>
Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;<br/>
When he and Southey, following the same path,<br/>
Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).

</p>
<p>
Such names at present cut a convict figure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The very Botany Bay in moral geography;<br/>
Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are good manure for their more bare biography.<br/>
Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any since the birthday of typography;<br/>
A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'<br/>
Writ in a manner which is my aversion.

</p>
<p>
He there builds up a formidable dyke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between his own and others' intellect;<br/>
But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,<br/>
Are things which in this century don't strike<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The public mind,&mdash;so few are the elect;<br/>
And the new births of both their stale virginities<br/>
Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.

</p>
<p>
But let me to my story: I must own,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have any fault, it is digression&mdash;<br/>
Leaving my people to proceed alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While I soliloquize beyond expression;<br/>
But these are my addresses from the throne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which put off business to the ensuing session:<br/>
Forgetting each omission is a loss to<br/>
The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.

</p>
<p>
I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(We 've not so good a word, but have the thing<br/>
In that complete perfection which ensures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An epic from Bob Southey every spring),<br/>
Form not the true temptation which allures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring<br/>
Some fine examples of the epopee,<br/>
To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.

</p>
<p>
We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,&mdash;<br/>
To show with what complacency he creeps,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.<br/>
He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ocean?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;No, of air; and then he makes<br/>
Another outcry for 'a little boat,'<br/>
And drivels seas to set it well afloat.

</p>
<p>
If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'<br/>
Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pray Medea for a single dragon?<br/>
Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,<br/>
And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,<br/>
Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?

</p>
<p>
'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?<br/>
That trash of such sort not alone evades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss<br/>
Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sense and song above your graves may hiss&mdash;<br/>
The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'<br/>
Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!

</p>
<p>
T' our tale.<br/>
&mdash;The feast was over, the slaves gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;<br/>
The Arab lore and poet's song were done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every sound of revelry expired;<br/>
The lady and her lover, left alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;&mdash;<br/>
Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,<br/>
That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!

</p>
<p>
Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft<br/>
Have felt that moment in its fullest power<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,<br/>
While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,<br/>
And not a breath crept through the rosy air,<br/>
And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.

</p>
<p>
Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!<br/>
Ave Maria! may our spirits dare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!<br/>
Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove&mdash;<br/>
What though 't is but a pictured image?&mdash;strike&mdash;<br/>
That painting is no idol,&mdash;'t is too like.

</p>
<p>
Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In nameless print&mdash;that I have no devotion;<br/>
But set those persons down with me to pray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shall see who has the properest notion<br/>
Of getting into heaven the shortest way;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My altars are the mountains and the ocean,<br/>
Earth, air, stars,&mdash;all that springs from the great Whole,<br/>
Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.

</p>
<p>
Sweet hour of twilight!&mdash;in the solitude<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pine forest, and the silent shore<br/>
Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,<br/>
To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore<br/>
And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,<br/>
How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!

</p>
<p>
The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,<br/>
Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;<br/>
The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng<br/>
Which learn'd from this example not to fly<br/>
From a true lover,&mdash;shadow'd my mind's eye.

</p>
<p>
O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,<br/>
To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;<br/>
Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,<br/>
Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;<br/>
Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.

</p>
<p>
Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who sail the seas, on the first day<br/>
When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way<br/>
As the far bell of vesper makes him start,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;<br/>
Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?<br/>
Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!

</p>
<p>
When Nero perish'd by the justest doom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,<br/>
Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,<br/>
Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void<br/>
Of feeling for some kindness done, when power<br/>
Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.

</p>
<p>
But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any such like sovereign buffoons,<br/>
To do with the transactions of my hero,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More than such madmen's fellow man&mdash;the moon's?<br/>
Sure my invention must be down at zero,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'<br/>
Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please<br/>
To dub the last of honours in degrees).

</p>
<p>
I feel this tediousness will never do&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is being too epic, and I must cut down<br/>
(In copying) this long canto into two;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They 'll never find it out, unless I own<br/>
The fact, excepting some experienced few;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then as an improvement 't will be shown:<br/>
I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is<br/>
From Aristotle passim.<br/>
&mdash;See poietikes.
