<p>TO</p>

<p><em>LIONEL PHILLIPS</em></p>

<p>  Time, they say, must the best of us capture,   And travel and
battle and gems and gold   No more can kindle the ancient rapture,  
For even the youngest of hearts grows old.   But in you, I think,
the boy is not over;   So take this medley of ways and wars  
As the gift of a friend and a fellow-lover   Of the fairest country
under the stars.</p>
