"The black will never understand the white, nor the white the black, as long
as black is black and white is white."
<P>
So said Captain Woodward. We sat in the parlor of Charley Roberts' pub in
Apia, drinking long Abu Hameds compounded and shared with us by the aforesaid
Charley Roberts, who claimed the recipe direct from Stevens, famous for having
invented the Abu Hamed at a time when he was spurred on by Nile thirst--the
Stevens who was responsible for "With Kitchener to Kartoun," and who passed
out at the siege of Ladysmith.
<P>
Captain Woodward, short and squat, elderly, burned by forty years of tropic
sun, and with the most beautiful liquid brown eyes I ever saw in a man, spoke
from a vast experience. The crisscross of scars on his bald pate bespoke a
tomahawk intimacy with the black, and of equal intimacy was the advertisement,
front and rear, on the right side of his neck, where an arrow had at one time
entered and been pulled clean through. As he explained, he had been in a hurry
on that occasion--the arrow impeded his running--and he felt that he could not
take the time to break off the head and pull out the shaft the way it had come
in. At the present moment he was commander of the SAVAII, the big steamer that
recruited labor from the westward for the German plantations on Samoa.
<P>
"Half the trouble is the stupidity of the whites," said Roberts, pausing to
take a swig from his glass and to curse the Samoan bar-boy in affectionate
terms. "If the white man would lay himself out a bit to understand the
workings of the black man's mind, most of the messes would be avoided."
<P>
"I've seen a few who claimed they understood niggers," Captain Woodward
retorted, "and I always took notice that they were the first to be kai-kai'd
(eaten). Look at the missionaries in New Guinea and the New Hebrides--the
martyr isle of Erromanga and all the rest. Look at the Austrian expedition
that was cut to pieces in the Solomons, in the bush of Guadalcanar. And look
at the traders themselves, with a score of years' experience, making their
brag that no nigger would ever get them, and whose heads to this day are
ornamenting the rafters of the canoe houses. There was old Johnny
Simons--twenty-six years on the raw edges of Melanesia, swore he knew the
niggers like a book and that they'd never do for him, and he passed out at
Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia, had his head sawed off by a black Mary (woman) and
an old nigger with only one leg, having left the other leg in the mouth of a
shark while diving for dynamited fish. There was Billy Watts, horrible
reputation as a nigger killer, a man to scare the devil. I remember lying at
Cape Little, New Ireland you know, when the niggers stole half a case of
trade-tobacco--cost him about three dollars and a half. In retaliation he
turned out, shot six niggers, smashed up their war canoes and burned two
villages. And it was at Cape Little, four years afterward, that he was jumped
along with fifty Buku boys he had with him fishing bï¿½che-de-mer. In five
minutes they were all dead, with the exception of three boys who got away in a
canoe. Don't talk to me about understanding the nigger. The white man's
mission is to farm the world, and it's a big enough job cut out for him. What
time has he got left to understand niggers anyway?"
<P>
"Just so," said Roberts. "And somehow it doesn't seem necessary, after all, to
understand the niggers. In direct proportion to the white man's stupidity is
his success in farming the world--"
<P>
"And putting the fear of God into the nigger's heart," Captain Woodward
blurted out. "Perhaps you're right, Roberts. Perhaps it's his stupidity that
makes him succeed, and surely one phase of his stupidity is his inability to
understand the niggers. But there's one thing sure, the white has to run the
niggers whether he understands them or not. It's inevitable. It's fate."
<P>
"And of course the white man is inevitable--it's the niggers' fate," Roberts
broke in. "Tell the white man there's pearl shell in some lagoon infested by
ten-thousand howling cannibals, and he'll head there all by his lonely, with
half a dozen kanaka divers and a tin alarm clock for chronometer, all packed
like sardines on a commodious, five-ton ketch. Whisper that there's a gold
strike at the North Pole, and that same inevitable white-skinned creature will
set out at once, armed with pick and shovel, a side of bacon, and the latest
patent rocker--and what's more, he'll get there. Tip it off to him that
there's diamonds on the red-hot ramparts of hell, and Mr. White Man will storm
the ramparts and set old Satan himself to pick-and-shovel work.  That's what
comes of being stupid and inevitable."
<P>
"But I wonder what the black man must think of the--the inevitableness," I
said.
<P>
Captain Woodward broke into quiet laughter. His eyes had a reminiscent gleam.
<P>
"I'm just wondering what the niggers of Malu thought and still must be
thinking of the one inevitable white man we had on board when we visited them
in the DUCHESS," he explained.
<P>
Roberts mixed three more Abu Hameds.
<P>
"That was twenty years ago. Saxtorph was his name. He was certainly the most
stupid man I ever saw, but he was as inevitable as death. There was only one
thing that chap could do, and that was shoot. I remember the first time I ran
into him--right here in Apia, twenty years ago. That was before your time,
Roberts. I was sleeping at Dutch Henry's hotel, down where the market is now.
Ever heard of him? He made a tidy stake smuggling arms in to the rebels, sold
out his hotel, and was killed in Sydney just six weeks afterward in a saloon
row.
<P>
"But Saxtorph. One night I'd just got to sleep, when a couple of cats began to
sing in the courtyard. It was out of bed and up window, water jug in hand. But
just then I heard the window of the next room go up. Two shots were fired, and
the window was closed. I fail to impress you with the celerity of the
transaction. Ten seconds at the outside. Up went the window, bang bang went
the revolver, and down went the window. Whoever it was, he had never stopped
to see the effect of his shots. He knew. Do you follow me?--he KNEW. There was
no more cat concert, and in the morning there lay the two offenders, stone
dead. It was marvelous to me. It still is marvelous. First, it was starlight,
and Saxtorph shot without drawing a bead; next, he shot so rapidly that the
two reports were like a double report; and finally, he knew he had hit his
marks without looking to see.
<P>
<P>
"Two days afterward he came on board to see me. I was mate, then, on the
Duchess, a whacking big one-hundred-and fifty-ton schooner, a blackbirder. And
let me tell you that blackbirders were blackbirders in those days. There
weren't any government protection for US, either. It was rough work, give and
take, if we were finished, and nothing said, and we ran niggers from every
south sea island they didn't kick us off from. Well, Saxtorph came on board,
John Saxtorph was the name he gave. He was a sandy little man, hair sandy,
complexion sandy, and eyes sandy, too. Nothing striking about him. His soul
was as neutral as his color scheme. He said he was strapped and wanted to ship
on board. Would go cabin boy, cook, supercargo, or common sailor. Didn't know
anything about any of the billets, but said that he was willing to learn. I
didn't want him, but his shooting had so impressed me that I took him as
common sailor, wages three pounds per month.
<P>
"He was willing to learn all right, I'll say that much. But he was
constitutionally unable to learn anything. He could no more box the compass
than I could mix drinks like Roberts here. And as for steering, he gave me my
first gray hairs. I never dared risk him at the wheel when we were running in
a big sea, while full-and-by and close-and-by were insoluble mysteries.
Couldn't ever tell the difference between a sheet and a tackle, simply
couldn't. The fore-throat-jig and the jib-jig were all one to him. Tell him to
slack off the mainsheet, and before you know it, he'd drop the peak. He fell
overboard three times, and he couldn't swim. But he was always cheerful, never
seasick, and he was the most willing man I ever knew. He was an
uncommunicative soul. Never talked about himself. His history, so far as we
were concerned, began the day he signed on the DUCHESS. Where he learned to
shoot, the stars alone can tell. He was a Yankee--that much we knew from the
twang in his speech. And that was all we ever did know.
<P>
"And now we begin to get to the point. We had bad luck in the New Hebrides,
only fourteen boys for five weeks, and we ran up before the southeast for the
Solomons. 'malaita, then as now, was good recruiting ground, and we ran into
Malu, on the northwestern corner. There's a shore reef and an outer reef, and
a mighty nervous anchorage; but we made it all right and fired off our
dynamite as a signal to the niggers to come down and be recruited. In three
days we got not a boy. The niggers came off to us in their canoes by hundreds,
but they only laughed when we showed them beads and calico and hatchets and
talked of the delights of plantation work in Samoa.
<P>
"On the fourth day there came a change. Fifty-odd boys signed on and were
billeted in the main-hold, with the freedom of the deck, of course. And of
course, looking back, this wholesale signing on was suspicious, but at the
time we thought some powerful chief had removed the ban against recruiting.
The morning of the fifth day our two boats went ashore as usual--one to cover
the other, you know, in case of trouble. And, as usual, the fifty niggers on
board were on deck, loafing, talking, smoking, and sleeping.  Saxtorph and
myself, along with four other sailors, were all that were left on board. The
two boats were manned with Gilbert Islanders. In the one were the captain, the
supercargo, and the recruiter. In the other, which was the covering boat and
which lay off shore a hundred yards, was the second mate. Both boats were
well-armed, though trouble was little expected.
<P>
"Four of the sailors, including Saxtorph, were scraping the poop rail. The
fifth sailor, rifle in hand, was standing guard by the water-tank just for'ard
of the mainmast. I was for'ard, putting in the finishing licks on a new jaw
for the fore-gaff. I was just reaching for my pipe where I had laid it down,
when I heard a shot from shore. I straightened up to look. Something struck me
on the back of the head, partially stunning me and knocking me to the deck.
'my first thought was that something had carried away aloft; but even as I
went down, and before I struck the deck, I heard the devil's own tattoo of
rifles from the boats, and twisting sidewise, I caught a glimpse of the sailor
who was standing guard. Two big niggers were holding his arms, and a third
nigger from behind was braining him with a tomahawk.
<P>
"I can see it now, the water-tank, the mainmast, the gang hanging on to him,
the hatchet descending on the back of his head, and all under the blazing
sunlight. I was fascinated by that growing vision of death. The tomahawk
seemed to take a horribly long time to come down. I saw it land, and the man's
legs give under him as he crumpled. The niggers held him up by sheer strength
while he was hacked a couple of times more. Then I got two more hacks on the
head and decided that I was dead. So did the brute that was hacking me. I was
too helpless to move, and I lay there and watched them removing the sentry's
head. I must say they did it slick enough. They were old hands at the
business.
<P>
"The rifle firing from the boats had ceased, and I made no doubt that they
were finished off and that the end had come to everything. It was only a
matter of moments when they would return for my head. They were evidently
taking the heads from the sailors aft. Heads are valuable on Malaita,
especially white heads. They have the place of honor in the canoe houses of
the salt-water natives. What particular decorative effect the bushmen get out
of them I didn't know, but they prize them just as much as the salt-water
crowd.
<P>
"I had a dim notion of escaping, and I crawled on hands and knees to the
winch, where I managed to drag myself to my feet. From there I could look aft
and see three heads on top the cabin--the heads of three sailors I had given
orders to for months. The niggers saw me standing, and started for me. I
reached for my revolver, and found they had taken it. I can't say that I was
scared. I've been near to death several times, but it never seemed easier than
right then. I was half-stunned, and nothing seemed to matter.
<P>
"The leading nigger had armed himself with a cleaver from the galley, and he
grimaced like an ape as he prepared to slice me down. But the slice was never
made. He went down on the deck all of a heap, and I saw the blood gush from
his mouth. In a dim way I heard a rifle go off and continue to go off. Nigger
after nigger went down. 'my senses began to clear, and I noted that there was
never a miss. Every time that the rifle went off a nigger dropped. I sat down
on deck beside the winch and looked up. Perched in the crosstrees was
Saxtorph. How he had managed it I can't imagine, for he had carried up with
him two Winchesters and I don't know how many bandoliers of ammunition; and he
was now doing the one only thing in this world that he was fitted to do.
<P>
"I've seen shooting and slaughter, but I never saw anything like that. I sat
by the winch and watched the show. I was weak and faint, and it seemed to be
all a dream. Bang, bang, bang, bang, went his rifle, and thud, thud, thud,
thud, went the niggers to the deck. It was amazing to see them go down. After
their first rush to get me, when about a dozen had dropped, they seemed
paralyzed; but he never left off pumping his gun. By this time canoes and the
two boats arrived from shore, armed with Sniders, and with Winchesters which
they had captured in the boats. The fusillade they let loose on Saxtorph was
tremendous. Luckily for him the niggers are only good at close range. They are
not used to putting the gun to their shoulders. They wait until they are right
on top of a man, and then they shoot from the hip. When his rifle got too hot,
Saxtorph changed off. That had been his idea when he carried two rifles up
with him.
<P>
"The astounding thing was the rapidity of his fire. Also, he never made a
miss. If ever anything was inevitable, that man was. It was the swiftness of
it that made the slaughter so appalling. The niggers did not have time to
think. When they did manage to think, they went over the side in a rush,
capsizing the canoes of course. Saxtorph never let up. The water was covered
with them, and plump, plump, plump, he dropped his bullets into them. Not a
single miss, and I could hear distinctly the thud of every bullet as it buried
in human flesh.
<P>
"The niggers spread out and headed for the shore, swimming. The water was
carpeted with bobbing heads, and I stood up, as in a dream, and watched it
all--the bobbing heads and the heads that ceased to bob. Some of the long
shots were magnificent. Only one man reached the beach, but as he stood up to
wade ashore, Saxtorph got him. It was beautiful. And when a couple of niggers
ran down to drag him out of the water, Saxtorph got them, too.
<P>
"I thought everything was over then, when I heard the rifle go off again. A
nigger had come out of the cabin companion on the run for the rail and gone
down in the middle of it. The cabin must have been full of them. I counted
twenty. They came up one at a time and jumped for the rail. But they never got
there. It reminded me of trapshooting. A black body would pop out of the
companion, bang would go Saxtorph's rifle, and down would go the black body.
Of course, those below did not know what was happening on deck, so they
continued to pop out until the last one was finished off.
<P>
"Saxtorph waited a while to make sure, and then came down on deck. He and I
were all that were left of the DUCHESS'S complement, and I was pretty well to
the bad, while he was helpless now that the shooting was over. Under my
direction he washed out my scalp wounds and sewed them up. A big drink of
whiskey braced me to make an effort to get out. There was nothing else to do.
All the rest were dead. We tried to get up sail, Saxtorph hoisting and I
holding the turn. He was once more the stupid lubber. He couldn't hoist worth
a cent, and when I fell in a faint, it looked all up with us.
<P>
"When I came to, Saxtorph was sitting helplessly on the rail, waiting to ask
me what he should do. I told him to overhaul the wounded and see if there were
any able to crawl. He gathered together six. One, I remember, had a broken
leg; but Saxtorph said his arms were all right. I lay in the shade, brushing
the flies off and directing operations, while Saxtorph bossed his hospital
gang. I'll be blessed if he didn't make those poor niggers heave at every rope
on the pin-rails before he found the halyards. One of them let go the rope in
the midst of the hoisting and slipped down to the deck dead; but Saxtorph
hammered the others and made them stick by the job. When the fore and main
were up, I told him to knock the shackle out of the anchor chain and let her
go. I had had myself helped aft to the wheel, where I was going to make a
shift at steering. I can't guess how he did it, but instead of knocking the
shackle out, down went the second anchor, and there we were doubly moored.
<P>
"In the end he managed to knock both shackles out and raise the staysail and
jib, and the Duchess filled away for the entrance.  Our decks were a
spectacle. Dead and dying niggers were everywhere. They were wedged away some
of them in the most inconceivable places. The cabin was full of them where
they had crawled off the deck and cashed in. I put Saxtorph and his graveyard
gang to work heaving them overside, and over they went, the living and the
dead. The sharks had fat pickings that day.  Of course our four murdered
sailors went the same way. Their heads, however, we put in a sack with
weights, so that by no chance should they drift on the beach and fall into the
hands of the niggers.
<P>
"Our five prisoners I decided to use as crew, but they decided otherwise. They
watched their opportunity and went over the side. Saxtorph got two in mid-air
with his revolver, and would have shot the other three in the water if I
hadn't stopped him.  I was sick of the slaughter, you see, and besides, they'd
helped work the schooner out. But it was mercy thrown away, for the sharks got
the three of them.
<P>
"I had brain fever or something after we got clear of the land.  Anyway, the
DUCHESS lay hove to for three weeks, when I pulled myself together and we
jogged on with her to Sydney. Anyway those niggers of Malu learned the
everlasting lesson that it is not good to monkey with a white man. In their
case, Saxtorph was certainly inevitable."
<P>
Charley Roberts emitted a long whistle and said:
<P>
"Well I should say so. But whatever became of Saxtorph?"
<P>
"He drifted into seal hunting and became a crackerjack. For six years he was
high line of both the Victoria and San Francisco fleets. The seventh year his
schooner was seized in Bering Sea by a Russian cruiser, and all hands, so the
talk went, were slammed into the Siberian salt mines. At least I've never
heard of him since."
<P>
"Farming the world," Roberts muttered. "Farming the world. Well here's to
them. Somebody's got to do it--farm the world, I mean."
<P>
Captain Woodward rubbed the criss-crosses on his bald head.
<P>
"I've done my share of it," he said. "Forty years now. This will be my last
trip. Then I'm going home to stay."
<P>
"I'll wager the wine you don't," Roberts challenged. "You'll die in the
harness, not at home."
<P>
Captain Woodward promptly accepted the bet, but personally I think Charley
Roberts has the best of it.
