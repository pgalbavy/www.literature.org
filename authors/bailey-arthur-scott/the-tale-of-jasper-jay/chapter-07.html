<p>THERE was one sport of which Jasper Jay was over-fond. He loved to
imitate the calls of other birds; and Jasper was such a good mimic that
he often deceived his neighbors by his tricks.
</p>
<p>It was not pleasant for a sober, elderly bird-gentleman to come home at
night from a hard day's work and have his wife accuse him of idling away
his time.
</p><p>"You can't deny it--for I could hear you laughing in the woods!" she
might say.
</p><p>And it was not always an easy task to convince her that what she had
heard was nobody but that noisy rascal, Jasper Jay, playing a trick on
her.
</p><p>Nor did Jasper limit his droll teasing to his own neighbors. Sometimes
he hid in a tree near the farm buildings and frightened the hens by
making a sound exactly like a certain red-shouldered hawk, who lived in
the low woods along Black Creek, where frogs were plentiful. A fierce
scream of "_Kee-you! kee-you!<u>" was quite enough to alarm an old hen
with a big family of young chickens. Though she might know well enough
that the red-shouldered hawk seldom made a meal of poultry, preferring
frogs and field-mice above all other food, it was only natural that she
shouldn't care to take any chances. The haste with which a nervous
mother-hen called her family into the chicken house when she heard that
cry of "</u>Kee-you! kee-you!_" always amused Jasper Jay, for he never
tired of the game.
</p><p>Surprising as it may seem, now and then Jasper's hawk-call deceived even
Farmer Green himself. And sometimes he would step into the kitchen and
take his old gun off the hooks on the wall above the wide fireplace and
hurry outside again in the hope of getting a shot at Mr. Hawk. It
happened at last that in some way Mr. Red-shouldered Hawk heard of this
trick of Jasper's. And that old gossip, Mr. Crow, warned Jasper Jay that
he had better be careful.
</p><p>"Mr. Hawk says that you are giving him a bad name with Farmer Green,"
Mr. Crow told Jasper one day. "Farmer Green calls him 'that old
hen-hawk,' and, of course, it's not very pleasant for Mr. Hawk to have
somebody looking for him with a gun. I know what the feeling is like,
myself," said old Mr. Crow. "Believe me, it's enough to make one most
uncomfortable!"
</p><p>But Jasper Jay only shrieked with laughter.
</p><p>"You'll sing a different song if Mr. Hawk catches you," Mr. Crow
snapped.
</p><p>And that made Jasper Jay scream all the louder. Then he stopped laughing
and said "_Caw! caw!_" in a husky voice so like Mr. Crow's own that the
old gentleman spluttered and fumed and all but chased Jasper out of the
woods where they were sitting at the time.
</p><p>They never did get along well together--old Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay.
They were cousins, you know. But that fact did not help matters at all.
Perhaps they knew too much about each other.
</p><p>"Don't worry about me!" said Jasper Jay at last.
</p><p>"Very well!" Mr. Crow replied stiffly. "But remember--I've warned you!"
he croaked. And then he flew away to his nest in a tall elm, overlooking
the cornfield.
