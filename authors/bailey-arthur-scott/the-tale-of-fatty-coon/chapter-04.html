<p>Fatty Coon was very fond of squirrels. And you may think it strange when
I tell you that not one of the squirrels anywhere around Blue Mountain
was the least bit fond of Fatty Coon. But when I say that Fatty Coon was
fond of squirrels, I mean that he liked to eat them. So of course you
will understand now why the squirrels did not care for Fatty at all. In
fact, they usually kept just as far away from him as they could.
</p>
<p>It was easy, in the daytime, for the squirrels to keep out of Fatty's
way, when he wandered through the tree-tops, for the squirrels were much
sprier than Fatty. But at night--ah! that was a very different matter.
For Fatty Coon's eyes were even sharper in the dark than they were in
the daylight; but the poor squirrels were just as blind as you are when
you are safely tucked in bed and the light is put out.
</p><p>Yes--when the squirrels were in bed at night, up in their nests in the
trees, they could see very little. And you couldn't say they were SAFE
in bed, because they never knew when Fatty Coon, or his mother, or his
brother, or one of his sisters, or some cousin of his, might come along
and catch them before they knew it.
</p><p>Fatty thought it great sport to hunt squirrels at night. Whenever he
tried it he usually managed to get a good meal. And after he had almost
forgotten about the fright the goshawk had given him in the tall hemlock
he began to roam through the tree-tops every night in search of
squirrels and sleeping birds.
</p><p>But a night came at last when Fatty was well punished for hunting
squirrels. He had climbed half-way to the top of a big chestnut tree,
when he spied a hole in the trunk. He rather thought that some squirrels
lived inside that hole. And as he listened for a few seconds he could
hear something moving about inside. Yes! Fatty was sure that there was a
squirrel in there--probably several squirrels.
</p><p>Fatty Coon's eyes turned green. It was a way they had, whenever he was
about to eat anything, or whenever he played with his brother Blackie,
or Fluffy and Cutey, his sisters; or whenever he was frightened. And now
Fatty was so sure that he was going to have a fine lunch that his eyes
turned as green as a cat's. He reached a paw inside the hole and felt
all around.
</p><p>WOW! Fatty gave a cry; and he pulled his paw out much faster than he had
put it in. Something had given him a cruel dig. And in a jiffy Fatty saw
what that "something" was. It was a grumpy old tramp coon, whom Fatty
had never seen before.
</p><p>"What do you mean, you young rascal, by disturbing me like this?" the
ragged stranger cried.
</p><p>"Please, sir, I never knew it was you," Fatty stammered.
</p><p>"Never knew it was me! Who did you think it was?"
</p><p>"A--a squirrel!" Fatty said faintly. And he whimpered a little, because
his paw hurt him.
</p><p>"Ho, ho! That's a good one! That's a good joke!" The tramp coon laughed
heartily. And then he scowled so fiercely that poor Fatty nearly tumbled
out of the tree. "You go home," he said to Fatty. "And don't you let me
catch you around here again. You hear?"
</p><p>"Yes, sir!" Fatty said. And home he went. And you may be sure that he
let THAT tree alone after that. He never went near it again.
